He is given a ship which can make the trip from colony to colony almost instantaneously. The technology used in the ship has been kept secret because it could give rise to interstellar war if one colony decided to conquer others. However, the isolated populations are also affected by genetic drift resulting in a decline in their societies.\nThe first planet he visits has been completely destroyed, the second is a gerontocratic travesty of a democracy, and the third is a repressive matriarchy. On the way he picks up companions Helena and Bernie.\nThe next planet they visit is supposed to be Earth, but it turns out not to be; not only are its planetary statistics different from Earth's, but it is populated by a race of almost-identical people called Joneses. This planet, also called Jones, is ruled by a cult of total conformity in all areas of life, including genetic phenotype. Ross discovers that the equation whose meaning he has been seeking refers to the loss of unfixed genes in a small population, which explains the degeneracy of the planets he has visited. Dr. Sam Jones learns that he has been worshiping an equation on genetic drift, and joins the little band.\nThey sort out their navigational problem and finally make it to Earth, which is a civilisation of morons protected by a small minority of hidden geniuses, like the situation in \"The Marching Morons\". Ross realises that the problem with all the degenerate worlds is their isolation; luckily he has the FTL drive and so sets about rectifying the problem by bringing them together.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfProject Gutenberg's Search the Sky, by Frederik Pohl and C.

From where he stood on the height of the Ramp, he could see\nthe Yards, the spires of Halsey City ten kilometers away\u00e2\u0080\u0094and the\ntumble-down gray acres of Ghost Town between.\n\nRoss wrinkled his nose. He wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t a man given to brooding, but the scent\nof decay had saturated his nostrils that morning. He had tossed and\nturned all the night, wrestling with a decision. And he had got up\nearly, so early that the only thing that made sense was to walk to work.\n\nAnd that meant walking through Ghost Town. He hadn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t done that in a long\ntime, not since childhood. Ghost Town was a wonderful place to play.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTag,\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cFollow My Fuehrer,\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cSenators and President\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u0094all the ancient\ngames took on new life when you could dodge and turn among crumbling\nruins, dart down unmarked lanes, gallop through sagging shacks where you\nmight stir out a screeching, unexpected recluse.\n\nBut it was clear that\u00e2\u0080\u0094in the fifteen years between childhood games and a\ntroubled man\u00e2\u0080\u0099s walk to work\u00e2\u0080\u0094Ghost Town had grown.\n\nEverybody knew that! Ask the right specialists, and they\u00e2\u0080\u0099d tell you how\nmuch and how fast. An acre a year, a street a month, a block a week, the\nspecialists would twinkle at you, convinced that the acre, street, block\nwas under control, since they could measure it.\n\nAsk the right specialists and they would tell you why it was happening.\nOne answer per specialist, with an ironclad guarantee that there would\nbe no overlapping of replies. \u00e2\u0080\u009cA purely psychological phenomenon, Mr.\nRoss. A vibration of the pendulum toward greater municipal compactness,\na huddling, a mature recognition of the facts of interdependence,\nbasically a step forward....\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cA purely biological phenomenon, Mr. Ross. Falling birth rate due to\nbiochemical deficiency of trace elements processed out of our planetary\ndiet. Fortunately the situation has been recognized in time and my bill\nbefore the Chamber will provide....\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cA purely technological problem, Mr. Ross. Maintenance of a sprawling\ncity is inevitably less efficient than that of a compact unit.\nInevitably there has been a drift back to the central areas and the\nconvenience of air-conditioned walkways, winterized plazas....\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nYes. It was a purely psychological-biological-technological-\neducational-demographic problem, and it was basically a step forward.\n\nRoss wondered how many Ghost Towns lay corpselike on the surface of\nHalsey\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Planet. Decay, he thought. Decay.\n\nBut it had nothing to do with his problem, the problem that had kept him\nawake all the night, the problem that blighted the view before him now.\n\nThe trading bell clanged. The day\u00e2\u0080\u0099s work began.\n\nFor Ross it might be his last day\u00e2\u0080\u0099s work at the Yards.\n\n                  *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe walked slowly from the ramp to the offices of the Oldham Trading\nCorporation. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMorning, Ross boy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d his breezy young boss greeted him.\nCharles Oldham IV\u00e2\u0080\u0099s father had always taken a paternal attitude toward\nhis help, and Charles Oldham IV was not going to change anything that\nDaddy had done. He shook Ross\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hand at the door of the suite and\napologized because they hadn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t been able to find a new secretary for him\nyet. They\u00e2\u0080\u0099d been looking for two weeks, but the three applicants they\nhad been able to dredge up had all been hopeless. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the damn\nChamber,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Charles Oldham IV, winsomely gesturing with his hands to\nshow how helpless men of affairs were against the blundering\ninterference of Government. \u00e2\u0080\u009cDamn labor shortage is nothing but a damn\nartificial scarcity crisis. Daddy saw it; he knew it was coming.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nRoss almost told him he was quitting, but held back. Maybe it was\nbecause he didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to spoil Oldham\u00e2\u0080\u0099s day with bad news, right on top\nof the opening bell. Or maybe it was because, in spite of a sleepless\nnight, he still wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t quite sure.\n\nThe morning\u00e2\u0080\u0099s work helped him to become sure. It was the same monotonous\ngrind.\n\nThree freighters had arrived at dawn from Halsey\u00e2\u0080\u0099s third moon, but none\nof them was any affair of his. There was an export shipment of jewelry\nand watches to be attended to, but the ship was not to take off for\nanother week. It scarcely classified as urgent. Ross worked on the\nmanifests for a couple of hours, stared through his window for an hour,\nand then it was time for lunch.\n\nLittle Marconi hailed him as he passed through the traders\u00e2\u0080\u0099 lounge.\n\nOf all the juniors on the Exchange, Marconi was the one Ross found\neasiest to take. He was lean and dark where Ross was solid and fair;\nworse, he stood four ranks above Ross in seniority. But, since Ross\nworked for Oldham, and Marconi worked for Haarland\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, the difference\ncould be waived in social intercourse.\n\nRoss suspected that, to Marconi as to him, trading was only a job\u00e2\u0080\u0094a dull\none, and not a crusade. And he knew that Marconi\u00e2\u0080\u0099s reading was not\nconfined to bills of lading. \u00e2\u0080\u009cLunch?\u00e2\u0080\u009d asked Marconi. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSure,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ross said.\nAnd he knew he\u00e2\u0080\u0099d probably spill his secret to the little man from\nHaarland\u00e2\u0080\u0099s.\n\nThe skyroom was crowded\u00e2\u0080\u0094comparatively. All eight of the usual tables\nwere taken; they pushed on into the roped-off area by the windows and\nfound a table overlooking the Yards. Marconi blew dust off his chair.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBeen a long time since this was used,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he grumbled. \u00e2\u0080\u009cDrink?\u00e2\u0080\u009d He raised\nhis eyebrows when Ross nodded. It made a break; Marconi was the one\nusually who had a drink with lunch, Ross never touched it.\n\nWhen the drinks came, each of them said to the other in perfect\nsynchronism: \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got something to tell you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThey looked startled\u00e2\u0080\u0094then laughed. \u00e2\u0080\u009cGo ahead,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Ross.\n\nThe little man didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even argue. Rapturously he drew a photo out of his\npocket.\n\nGod, thought Ross wearily, Lurline again! He studied the picture with a\nshow of interest. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNew snap?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he asked brightly. \u00e2\u0080\u009cLovely girl\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d Then he\nnoticed the inscription: _To my fiance, with crates of love._ \u00e2\u0080\u009cWell!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he\nsaid, \u00e2\u0080\u009cFiance, is it? Congratulations, Marconi!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMarconi was almost drooling on the photo. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNext month,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said happily.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cA big, big wedding. For keeps, Ross\u00e2\u0080\u0094for keeps. With children!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nRoss made an expression of polite surprise. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t say!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all down in black and white! She agrees to have two children in\nthe first five years\u00e2\u0080\u0094no permissive clause, a straight guarantee. Fifteen\nhundred annual allowance per child. And, Ross, do you know what? Her\nlawyer told her right in front of me that she ought to ask for three\nthousand, and she told him, \u00e2\u0080\u0098No, Mr. Turek. I happen to be in love.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 How\ndo you like that, Ross?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cA girl in a million,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ross said feebly. His private thoughts were that\nMarconi had been gaffed and netted like a sugar perch. Lurline was of\nthe Old Landowners, who didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t own anything much but land these days,\nand Marconi was an undersized nobody who happened to make a very good\nliving. Sure she happened to be in love. Smartest thing she could be. Of\ncourse, promising to have children sounded pretty special; but the\npapers were full of those things every day. Marconi could reliably be\ncounted on to hang himself. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099d promise her breakfast in bed every\nthird week end, or the maid that he couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t possibly find on the labor\nmarket, and the courts would throw all the promises on both sides out of\nthe contract as a matter of simple equity. But the marriage would stick,\nall right.\n\nMarconi had himself a final moist, fatuous sigh and returned the photo\nto his pocket. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd now,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he asked brightly, craning his neck for the\nwaiter, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s your news?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nRoss sipped his drink, staring out at the nuzzling freighters in their\nhemispherical slips. He said abruptly, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI might be on one of those next\nweek. Fallon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s got a purser\u00e2\u0080\u0099s berth open.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMarconi forgot the waiter and gaped. \u00e2\u0080\u009cQuitting?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got to do something!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ross exploded. His own voice scared him;\nthere was a knife blade of hysteria in the sound of it. He gripped the\nedge of the table and forced himself to be calm and deliberate.\n\nMarconi said tardily, \u00e2\u0080\u009cEasy, Ross.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cEasy! You\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve said it, Marconi: \u00e2\u0080\u0098Easy.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Everything\u00e2\u0080\u0099s so damned easy and\nso damned boring that I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m just about ready to blow! I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got to do\nsomething,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he repeated. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m getting nowhere! I push papers around and\nthen I push them back again. You know what happens next. You get soft\nand paunchy. You find yourself going by the book instead of by your\nhead. You\u00e2\u0080\u0099re covered, if you go by the book\u00e2\u0080\u0094no matter what happens. And\nyou might just as well be dead!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNow, Ross\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNow, hell!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ross flared. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMarconi, I swear I think there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s something\nwrong with me! Look, take Ghost Town for instance. Ever wonder why\nnobody lives there, except a couple of crazy old hermits?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Ghost Town,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Marconi explained. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s deserted.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd why is it deserted? What happened to the people who used to live\nthere?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMarconi shook his head. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou need a vacation, son,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said\nsympathetically. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat was a long time ago. Hundreds of years, maybe.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut where did the people go?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ross persisted desperately. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAll of the\ncity was inhabited hundreds of years ago\u00e2\u0080\u0094the city was twice as big as it\nis now. How come?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMarconi shrugged. \u00e2\u0080\u009cDunno.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nRoss collapsed. \u00e2\u0080\u009cDon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know. You don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know, nobody knows.\nOnly thing is, I care! I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m curious. Marconi, I get\u00e2\u0080\u0094well, moody.\nDepressed. I get to worrying about crazy things. Ghost Town, for one.\nAnd why can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t they find a secretary for me? And am I really different\nfrom everybody else or do I just think so\u00e2\u0080\u0094and doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t that mean that I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m\ninsane?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe laughed. Marconi said warmly, \u00e2\u0080\u009cRoss, you aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t the only one; don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\never think you are. I went through it myself. Found the answer, too. You\nwait, Ross.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe paused. Ross said suspiciously, \u00e2\u0080\u009cYeah?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMarconi tapped the breast pocket with the photo of Lurline. \u00e2\u0080\u009cShe\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll come\nalong,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said.\n\nRoss managed not to sneer in his face. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNo,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said wearily. \u00e2\u0080\u009cLook, I\ndon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t advertise it, but I was married once. I was eighteen, it lasted\nfor a year and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m the one who walked out. Flat-fee settlement; it took\nme five years to pay off the loan, but I never regretted it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMarconi began gravely, \u00e2\u0080\u009cSexual incompatibility\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nRoss cut him off with an impatient gesture. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIn that department,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he\nsaid, \u00e2\u0080\u009cit so happens she was a genius. But\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nRoss shrugged. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI must have been crazy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said shortly. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI kept\nthinking that she was half-dead, dying on the vine like the rest of\nHalsey\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Planet. And I must still be crazy, because I still think so.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe little man involuntarily felt his breast pocket. He said gently,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMaybe you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been working too hard.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cToo hard!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ross laughed, a curious blend of true humor and\nself-disgust. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWell,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he admitted, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI need a change, anyhow. I might as\nwell be on a longliner. At least I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d have my spree to look back on.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Marconi said, so violently that Ross slopped the drink he was\nlifting to his mouth.\n\nRoss looked hard at the little man\u00e2\u0080\u0094hard and speculatively. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, then,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nhe said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt was just a figure of speech, of course. But tell me\nsomething, won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you, Marconi?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTell you what?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTell me why such a violent reaction to the word \u00e2\u0080\u0098longliner.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 I want to\nknow.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHell, Ross,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the little man grumbled, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou know what a longliner is.\nGutter-scrapings for crews; nothing for a man like you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI want to know more,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ross insisted. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen I ask you what a longliner\nis, what the crew do with themselves for two or three centuries, you\nchange the subject. You always change the subject! Maybe you know\nsomething I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know. I want to know what it is, and this time the\nsubject doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get changed. You don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get off the hook until I find\nout.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He took a sip of his drink and leaned back. \u00e2\u0080\u009cTell me about\nlongliners,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve never seen one coming in; it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been fifteen\nyears or so since that bucket from Sirius IV, hasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t it? But you were on\nthe job then.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMarconi was no longer a man in love or one of the few people whom Ross\nconsidered to be wholly alive\u00e2\u0080\u0094like him. He was a hard-eyed little\nstranger with a stubborn mouth and an ingratiating veneer. In short he\nwas again a trader, and a good one.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll tell you anything I know,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Marconi declared positively, and\ninsincerely. \u00e2\u0080\u009cTend to that fellow first though, will you?\u00e2\u0080\u009d He pointed to\na uniformed Yards messenger whose eye had just alighted on Ross. The man\nthreaded his way, stumbling, through the tables and laid a sealed\nenvelope down in the puddle left by Ross\u00e2\u0080\u0099s drink.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSorry, sir,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said crisply, wiped off the envelope with his\nhandkerchief and, for lagniappe, wiped the puddle off the table into\nRoss\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lap.\n\nSpeechless, Ross signed for the envelope on a red-tabbed slip marked\nURGENT * PRIORITY * RUSH. The messenger saluted, almost putting his own\neye out, and left, crashing into tables and chairs.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHalf-dead,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ross muttered, following him with his eyes. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHow the devil\ndo they stay alive at all?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMarconi said, unsmiling, \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou\u00e2\u0080\u0099re taking this kick pretty seriously,\nRoss. I admit he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a little clumsy, but\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut nothing,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Ross. \u00e2\u0080\u009cDon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t try to tell me you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know\nsomething\u00e2\u0080\u0099s wrong, Marconi! He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a bumbling incompetent, and half his\ngeneration is just like him.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He looked bitterly at the envelope and\ndropped it on the table again. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMore manifests,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI swear I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll\nstart throwing tableware if I have to check another bill of lading.\nBrighten my day, Marconi; tell me about the longliners. You\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not off\nthe hook yet, you know.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMarconi signaled for another drink. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAll right,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMarconi tells\nall about longliners. They\u00e2\u0080\u0099re ships. They go from the planet of one star\nto the planet of another star. It takes a long time, because stars are\nmany light-years apart and rocket ships cannot travel as fast as light.\nEinstein said so\u00e2\u0080\u0094whoever he was. Do we start with the Sirius IV ship? I\nwas around when it came in, all right. Fifteen years ago, and Halsey\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nPlanet is still enjoying the benefits of it. And so is Leverett and Sons\nTrading Corporation. They did fine on flowers from seeds that bucket\nbrought, they did fine on sugar perch from eggs that bucket brought.\nI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve never had it myself. Raw fish for dessert! But some people swear by\nit\u00e2\u0080\u0094at five shields a portion. They can have it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe hook, Marconi,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ross reminded grimly.\n\nTrader Marconi laughed amiably. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSorry. Well, what else? Pictures and\nmusic, but I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not much on them. I do read, though, and as a reader I\nsay, God bless that bucket from Sirius IV. We never had a novelist like\nMorris Halliday on this planet\u00e2\u0080\u0094or an essayist like Jay Waring. Let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nsee, there have been eight Halliday novels off the microfilms so far,\nand I think Leverett still has a couple in the vaults. Leverett must\nbe\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMarconi. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to hear about Leverett and Sons. Or Morris\nHalliday, or Waring. I want to hear about longliners.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m trying to tell you,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Marconi said sullenly, the mask down.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not. You\u00e2\u0080\u0099re telling me that the longline ships go from one\nstellar system to another with merchandise. I know that.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThen what do you want?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be difficult, Marconi. I want to know the facts. All about\nlongliners. The big hush-hush. The candid explanations that explain\nnothing\u00e2\u0080\u0094except that a starship is a starship. I know that they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re\nclosed-system, multigeneration jobs; a group of people get in on Sirius\nIV and their great-great-great-great-grandchildren come giggling and\nstumbling out on Halsey\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Planet. I know that every couple of\ngenerations your firm\u00e2\u0080\u0094and mine, for that matter\u00e2\u0080\u0094builds one with profits\nthat would be taxed off anyway and slings it out, stocked with seeds and\nfilm and sound tape and patent designs and manufacturing specifications\nfor every new gimmick on the market, in the hope that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be back long\nafter we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re dead with a similar cargo to enrich your firm\u00e2\u0080\u0099s and my\nfirm\u00e2\u0080\u0099s then-current owners. Sounds silly\u00e2\u0080\u0094but, as I say, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tax money\nanyhow. I know that your firm and mine staff the ships with half a dozen\nbums of each sex, who are loaded aboard with a dandy case of delirium\ntremens, contracted from spending their bounty money the only way they\nknow how. And that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just about all I know. Take it from there, Marconi.\nAnd be specific.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe little man shrugged irritably. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat gag\u00e2\u0080\u0099s beginning to wear thin,\nRoss,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he complained. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat do you want me to tell you\u00e2\u0080\u0094the number of\nwelds in Bulkhead 47 of \u00e2\u0080\u0098Starship 74\u00e2\u0080\u0099? What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the difference? As you\nsaid, a starship is a starship is a longliner. Without them the\ninhabited solar systems would have no means of contact or commerce. What\nelse is there to say?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nRoss looked suddenly lost. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0094don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cDon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you know,\nMarconi?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMarconi hesitated, and for a moment Ross was sure he did know\u00e2\u0080\u0094knew\nsomething, at any rate, something that might be an answer to the doubts\nand nagging inconsistencies that were bothering him. But then Marconi\nshrugged and looked at his watch and ordered another drink.\n\nBut there was something wrong. Ross felt himself in the position of a\ndiagnostician whose patient willfully refuses to tell where it hurts.\nThe planet was sick\u00e2\u0080\u0094but wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t admit it. Sick? Dying! Maybe he was on\nthe wrong track entirely. Maybe the starships had nothing to do with it.\nMaybe there was nothing that Marconi knew that would fit a piece into\nthe puzzle and make the answer come out all clear\u00e2\u0080\u0094but Ghost Town\ncontinued to grow acre by acre, year by year. And Oldham still hadn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\nfound him a secretary capable of writing her own name.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAccording to the historians, everything fits nicely into place,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ross\nsaid, dubiously. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey say we came here ourselves in longliners once,\nMarconi. Our ancestors under some man named Halsey colonized this place,\nfourteen hundred years ago. According to the longliners that come in\nfrom other stars, their ancestors colonized wherever they came from in\nstarships from a place called Earth. Where is this Earth, Marconi?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMarconi said succinctly, \u00e2\u0080\u009cLook in the star charts. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s there.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, but\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut, hell,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Marconi said in annoyance. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat in the world has got into\nyou, Ross? Earth is a planet like any other planet. The starship Halsey\ncolonized in was a starship like any other starship\u00e2\u0080\u0094only bigger. I\nguess, that is\u00e2\u0080\u0094I wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t there. After all, what are the longliners but\ncolonists? They happen to be going to planets that are already\ninhabited, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all. So a starship is nothing new or even very\ninteresting, and this is beginning to bore me, and you ought to read\nyour urgent-priority-rush message.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nRoss felt repentant\u00e2\u0080\u0094knowing that that was just how Trader Marconi wanted\nhim to feel. He said slowly, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m sorry if I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m being a nuisance,\nMarconi. You know how it is when you feel stale and restless. I know all\nthe stories\u00e2\u0080\u0094but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s so damned hard to believe them. The famous\ncolonizing ships. They must have been absolutely gigantic to take any\nreasonable number of people on a closed-circuit, multigeneration ride.\nWe can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t build them that big now!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo reason to.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut we couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t if we had to. Imagine shooting those things all over\nthe Galaxy. How many inhabited planets in the charts\u00e2\u0080\u0094five hundred? A\nthousand? Think of the technology, Marconi. What became of it?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t need that sort of technology any more,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Marconi explained.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat job is done. Now we concentrate on more important things. Learning\nto live with each other. Developing our own planet. Increasing our\nunderstanding of social factors and demographic\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nRoss was laughing at last. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, Marconi,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said at last, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat takes\ncare of that! We sure have figured out how to handle the social factors,\nall right. Every year there are fewer of them to handle. Pretty soon\nwe\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll all be dead, and then the problem can be marked \u00e2\u0080\u0098solved.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMarconi laughed too\u00e2\u0080\u0094eagerly, as if he\u00e2\u0080\u0099d been waiting for the chance. He\nsaid, \u00e2\u0080\u009cNow that that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s settled, are you going to open your message? Are\nyou at least going to have some lunch?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe Yards messenger stumbled up to their table again, this time with an\nenvelope for Marconi. He looked sharply at Ross\u00e2\u0080\u0099s unopened envelope and\nsaid nothing, pointedly. Ross guiltily picked it up and tore it open.\nYou could act like a sulky child in front of a friend, but strangers\ndidn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t understand.\n\nThe message was from his office. RADAR REPORTS HIGH VELOCITY SPACECRAFT\nON AUTOCONTROLS. FIRST APPROXIMATION TRAJECTORY INDICATES INTERSTELLAR\nORIGIN. PROBABLE ETA YARDS 1500. NO RADIO MESSAGES RECEIVED. DON\u00e2\u0080\u0099T HAVE\nTO TELL YOU TO GET ON THIS IMMEDIATELY AND GIVE IT YOUR BEST. OLDHAM.\n\nRoss looked at Marconi, whose expression was perturbed. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBet I know what\nyour message says,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he offered with an uneasy quaver in his voice.\n\nMarconi said: \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll bet you do. Oldham\u00e2\u0080\u0099s radar setup on Sunward always\nhas been better than Haarland\u00e2\u0080\u0099s. Better location. Man, you are in\ntrouble! Let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s get out there and hope nobody\u00e2\u0080\u0099s missed you so far.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThey grabbed sandwiches from the snack bar on the way out and munched\nthem while the Yards jeep took them to the ready line. Skirting the\nfreighters in their pits, slipping past the enormous overhaul sheds,\nthey saw excited debates going on. Twice they were passed by Yards\nvehicles heading toward the landing area. Halfway to the line they heard\nthe recall sirens warning everybody and everything out of the ten seared\nacres surrounded by homing and Ground-Controlled Approach radars. That\nwas where the big ones were landed.\n\nThe ready line was jammed when they got there. Ships from one or another\nof the five moons that circled Halsey\u00e2\u0080\u0099s planet were common; the moons\nwere the mines. Even the weekly liner and freighters from the colony on\nSunward, the planet next in from Halsey\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, were routine to the Yards\nworkers. But to anybody an interstellar ship was a sensation, a\nonce-or-twice-in-a-lifetime thrill.\n\nProtocols were uncertain. Traders argued about the first crack at the\nstrangers and their goods. A dealer named Aalborg said the only fair\nsystem would be to give every trade there an equal opportunity to do\nbusiness\u00e2\u0080\u0094in alphabetical order. Everybody agreed that under no\ncircumstances should the man from Leverett and Sons be allowed to\ntrade\u00e2\u0080\u0094everybody, except the man from Leverett and Sons. He pointed out\nthat his firm was the logical choice because it had more and fresher\nexperience in handling interstellar goods than any other....\n\nThey almost mobbed him.\n\nIt wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t merely money that filled the atmosphere with electric tingles.\nThe glamor of time-travel was on them. The crew aboard that ship were\ntravelers of time as well as space. The crew that had launched the ship\nwas dust. The crew that served it now had never seen a planet.\n\nThere was even some humility in the crowd. There were thoughtful ones\namong them who reflected that it was not, after all, a very great feat\nto hitch a rocket to a shell and lob it across a few million miles to a\nneighboring planet. It was eclipsed by the tremendous deed whose climax\nthey were about to witness. The thoughtful ones shrugged and sighed as\nthey thought that even the starship booming down toward Halsey\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nPlanet\u00e2\u0080\u0094fitted with the cleverest air replenishers and the most\nmiraculously efficient waste converters\u00e2\u0080\u0094was only a counter in the game\nwhose great rule was the mass-energy formulation of the legendary\nEinstein: that there is no way to push a material object past the speed\nof light.\n\nA report swept the field that left men reeling in its wake. Radar Track\nconfirmed that the ship was of unfamiliar pattern. All hope that it\nmight be a starship launched from this very spot on the last leg of a\nstupefying round trip was officially dead. The starship was foreign.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWonder what they have?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Marconi muttered.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTrader!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ross sneered ponderously. He was feeling better; the weight of\ndepression had been lifted for the time being, either by his confession\nor the electric atmosphere. If every day were like this, he thought\nvaguely....\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLet\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not kid each other,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Marconi was saying exuberantly. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is an\nevent, man! Where are they from, what are they peddling? Do I get a good\ncut at their wares? It could be fifty thousand shields for me in\ncommission alone. Lurline and I could build a tower house on Great Blue\nLake with that kind of money, with a whole floor for her parents! Ross,\nyou just don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know what it is to really be in love. Everything\nchanges.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nA jeep roared up and slammed to a stop; Ross blinked and yelled: \u00e2\u0080\u009cHere\nit comes!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThey watched the ground-controlled approach with the interest of\nsemiprofessionals and concealed their rising excitement with shop talk.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhups! There goes the high-power job into action.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Marconi pointed as a\nhuge dish antenna swiveled ponderously on its mast. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSeems the\nmedium-output dishes can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t handle her.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMaybe the high-power dish can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t either. She might be just plain shot.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cStandard, sealed GCA doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get shot, my young friend. Not in a\nneon-atmosphere tank it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMaybe along about the fifth generation they forgot what it was and cut\nit open with an acetylene torch to see what was inside.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBad luck for us in that case, Ross.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The ship steadied on a due-west\ncourse and flashed across the heavens and over the horizon.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSomebody decided a braking ellipse or two was in order. What about line\nof sight?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo sweat. The GCA jockey\u00e2\u0080\u0094and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d bet it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Delafield himself\u00e2\u0080\u0094pushes a\nbutton that hooks him into the high-power dish at every rocket field on\nHalsey\u00e2\u0080\u0099s. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been all thought out. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a potential fortune aboard\nthat longliner and Fields Administration wants its percentage for\nservicing and accommodating.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWonder what they have?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI already asked that one, Ross.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSo you did.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThey lapsed into silence until the rocket boomed in again from the east,\nhigh and slow. The big dish swiveled abruptly and began tracking again.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll try to bring her down this time. Yes! There go fore and\nstabilizing jets.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nFlame jutted from the silvery speck high in the blue; its apparent speed\nslowed to a crawl. It vanished for a second as steering jets turned her\nslowly endwise. They caught sight of the stern jets when they blasted\nfor the descent.\n\nIt was uneventful\u00e2\u0080\u0094just the landing of a very, very big rocket. When a\nlanding is successful it is like every other successful landing ever\nmade.\n\nBut the action that the field whirled into immediately following the\nlanding was far from routine. The bullhorns roared that all traders,\nwipers, rubbernecks, and visitors were to get behind the ready lines and\nstay there. All Class-Three-and-higher Field personnel were to take\nstations for longliner clearance. The weapons and decontamination\nparties were to take their stations immediately. Captain Delafield would\nissue all future orders and don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t let any of the traders talk you out of\nit, men. Captain Delafield would issue all future orders.\n\nRoss watched in considerable surprise as Field men working with drilled\nprecision broke out half a dozen sleek, needle-nosed guns from an\ninnocent-looking bay of the warehouse and manhandled them into position.\nFrom another bay a large pressure tank was hauled and backed against the\nlock of the starship. Ross could see the station medic bustlingly\nsupervise that, and the hosing of white gunk onto the juncture between\ntank and ship.\n\nDelafield crossed the stretch from the GCA complex to the tank, vanished\ninto it through a pressure-fitted door and that was that. The tank had\nno windows.\n\nRoss said to Marconi, wonderingly: \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all this about? There was Doc\nGibbons handling the pressure tank, there was Chunk Blaney rolling out a\nGod-damned cannon I never knew was there\u00e2\u0080\u0094how many more little secrets\nare there that I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know about?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMarconi grinned. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey have gun drill once a month, my young friend, and\nthey never say a word about it. Let the right rabble-rouser get hold of\nthe story and he might sail into office on a platform of \u00e2\u0080\u0098Keep the\nbug-eyed monsters off of Halsey\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Planet.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 You have to have reasonable\nprecautions, military and medical, though\u00e2\u0080\u0094and this is the straight\ngoods\u00e2\u0080\u0094there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s never been any trouble of either variety.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe conversation died and there was a long, boring hour of nothing. At\nlast Delafield appeared again. One of the decontamination party ran up\nin a jeep with a microphone.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll it be?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ross demanded. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAlphabetic order? Or just a rush?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe announcement floored him. \u00e2\u0080\u009cRepresentative of the Haarland Trading\nCorporation please report to the decontamination tank.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe representative of the Haarland Trading Corporation was Marconi.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHell,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ross said bitterly. \u00e2\u0080\u009cGood luck with them, whoever they are.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMarconi brooded for a moment and then said gruffly, \u00e2\u0080\u009cCome on along.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou mean it?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSure. Uh\u00e2\u0080\u0094naturally, Ross, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll give me your word not to make any\ncommercial offers or inquiries without my permission.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh. Naturally.\u00e2\u0080\u009d They started across the field and were checked through\nthe ready line, Marconi cheerfully presenting his identification and\nvouching for Ross.\n\nCaptain Delafield, at the tank, snapped, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat are you doing here, Ross?\nYou\u00e2\u0080\u0099re Oldham\u00e2\u0080\u0099s man. I distinctly said\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy responsibility, Captain. Will that do it?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Marconi asked.\n\nDelafield snapped, \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be your fundament if Haarland hears about it.\nActually it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the damnedest situation\u00e2\u0080\u0094they _asked_ for Haarland\u00e2\u0080\u0099s.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMarconi looked frightened and his hand involuntarily went to his breast\npocket. He swallowed and asked, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhere are they from?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nDelafield grimaced and said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cHome.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMarconi exploded, \u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, no!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all I can get out of them. I suppose their trajectory can be\nanalyzed, and there must be books. We haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t been in the ship yet.\nNobody goes in until it gets sprayed, rayed, dusted, and busted down\ninto its component parts. Too many places for nasty little mutant\nbacteria and viruses to lurk.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSure, Captain. \u00e2\u0080\u0098Home,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 eh? They\u00e2\u0080\u0099re pretty simple?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHappy little morons. Fifteen of them, ranging in age from one month to\nwhat looks like a hundred and twenty. All they know is \u00e2\u0080\u0098home\u00e2\u0080\u0099 and \u00e2\u0080\u0098we\nwish to see the representative of the Haarland Trading Corporation.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\nFirst the old woman said it. Then the next in line\u00e2\u0080\u0094he must be about a\nhundred\u00e2\u0080\u0094said it. Then a pair of identical twins, fifty-year-old women,\nsaid it in chorus. Then the rest of them on down to the month-old baby,\nand I swear to God he tried to say it. Well, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re the Haarland Trading\nCorporation. Go on in.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\n\n..... 2\n\n\nTHEY were all naked. Why not? There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no weather in a space ship. All of\nthem laughed when Ross and Marconi came in through the lock except the\nbaby, who was nursing at the breast of a handsome woman. Their laughter\nwas what attracted Ross immediately. Cheerful\u00e2\u0080\u0094no meanness in it. The\nhappy yelping of puppies at play with a red rubber bone.\n\nA stab went through him as the pleasure in their simple happiness turned\nto recollection and recognition. His wife of a decade ago.... Ross\nstudied them with amazement, expecting to find her features in their\nfeatures, her figure in theirs. And failed. Yet they reminded him\ninescapably of his miserable year with that half-a-woman, but they were\nphysically no kin of hers. They were just cheerful laughers who he knew\nwere less than human.\n\nThe cheerful laughers exposed unblemished teeth in all their mouths,\nincluding that of the hundred-and-twenty-year-old matriarch. Why not? If\nyou put calcium and fluorides into a closed system, they stay there.\n\nThe old woman stopped laughing at them long enough to say to Marconi,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe wish to see the representative of the Haarland\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, I know. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m the representative of the Haarland Trading\nCorporation. Welcome to Halsey\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Planet. May I ask what your name is,\nma\u00e2\u0080\u0099am?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMa,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said genially.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cPleased to meet you, Ma. My name\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Marconi.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMa said, bewildered, \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou just said you were the representative of the\nHaarland Trading\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, Ma, but that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all right. Let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s say that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s my other name. Two\nnames\u00e2\u0080\u0094understand?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe laughed at the idea of two names, wonderingly.\n\nMarconi pressed, \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the name of this gentleman?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t Gentleman. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Sonny.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nSonny was a hundred years old.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cPleased to meet you, Sonny. And your name, sir?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSonny,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said a redheaded man of eighty or thereabouts.\n\nThe identical-twin women were named The Kids. The baby was named Him.\nThe rest of the troop were named Girl, Ma, or Sonny. After introductions\nRoss noticed that Him had been passed to another Ma who was placidly\nsuckling him. She had milk; it dribbled from the corner of the baby\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nmouth. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t another baby left in the ship, is there?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ross asked\nin alarm.\n\nThey laughed and the Ma suckling the baby said: \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere was, but she\ndied. Mostly they do when you put them into the box after they get born.\nMa here was lucky. Her Him didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t die.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cPut them in the box? What box? Why?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMarconi was nudging him fiercely in the ribs. He ignored it.\n\nThey laughed amiably at his ignorance and explained that the box was the\nbox, and that you put your newborn babies into it because you put your\nnewborn babies into it.\n\nA beep tone sounded from the ship.\n\nMa said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe have to go back now, The Representative of the Haarland\nTrading Corporation Marconi.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat for?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMa said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cAt regular intervals signaled by a tone of six hundred cycles\nand an intermittent downward shifting of the ship lights from standard\nillumination frequency to a signal frequency of 420 millimicrons, ship\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\noperating personnel take up positions at the control boards for\nrecalibration of ship-working meters and instruments against the battery\nof standard masters. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be right back.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThey trooped through the hatch, leaving Ross and Marconi staring at each\nother in the decontamination tank.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ross said slowly, \u00e2\u0080\u009cat last I know why the Longliner Departments\nhave their little secrets. \u00e2\u0080\u0098The box.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 I say it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s murder.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBe reasonable,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Marconi told him\u00e2\u0080\u0094but his own face was white under the\nglaring germicidal lamps. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t let them increase without limit or\nthey\u00e2\u0080\u0099d all die. And before they died there\u00e2\u0080\u0099d be cannibalism. Which do\nyou prefer?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLetting kids be born and then snuffing them out if a computer decides\nthey\u00e2\u0080\u0099re the wrong sex or over the quota is inhuman.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t say I like it, Ross. But it works.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSo do pills!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cPills are a private matter. A person might privately decide not to take\nhers. The box is a public matter and the group outnumbers and overrules\na mother who decides not to use it. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s your question of\neffectiveness answered, but there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s another point. Those people are\nsane, Ross. Preposterously naive, but sane! Saner than childless women\nor sour old bachelors we both know who never had to love anything small\nand helpless, and so come to love nobody but themselves. They\u00e2\u0080\u0099re sane.\nPartly because the women get a periodic biochemical shakeup called\npregnancy that their biochemical balance is designed to mesh with.\nPartly because the men find tenderness and protectiveness in themselves\ntoward the pregnant women. Mostly, I think, because\u00e2\u0080\u0094it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s something to\ndo.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCan you imagine the awful monotony of life in the ship? The work is\nsheer rote and repetition. They can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t read or watch screentapes. They\nwere born in the ship, and the books and screentapes are meaningless\nbecause they know nothing to compare them with. The only change they see\nis each other, aging toward death. Frequent pregnancies are a Godsend to\nthem. They compare and discuss them; they wonder who the fathers are;\nthey make bets of rations; the men brag and keep score. The girls look\nforward to their first and their last. The jokes they make up about\nthem! The way they speculate about twins! The purgative fear, even,\nkeeps them sane.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd then,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ross said, \u00e2\u0080\u009c\u00e2\u0080\u0098the box.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nStaring straight ahead at the ship\u00e2\u0080\u0099s port Marconi echoed: \u00e2\u0080\u009cYes. \u00e2\u0080\u0098The\nbox.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 If there were another way\u00e2\u0080\u0094but there isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n                  *       *       *       *       *\n\nHis breezy young boss, Charles Oldham IV, was not pleased with what Ross\nhad to report.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAsked for Haarland!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he repeated unbelievingly. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThose dummies didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\nknow where they were going or where they were from, but they knew enough\nto ask for Haarland.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He slammed a ruler on his desk and yelled:\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGod-damn it!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMr. Oldham!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ross protested, aghast. For a superior to lose his temper\npublicly was unthinkable; it covered you with embarrassment.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cManners be God-damned too!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Oldham screamed, breaking up fast. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat do\nyou know about the state of our books? What do you know about the\noverhead I inherited from my loving father? What the hell do you know\nabout the downcurve in sales?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThese fluctuations\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ross began soothingly.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cFluctuations be God-damned! I know a fluctuation when I see one, and I\nknow a long-term downtrend when I see one. And that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re riding,\nright into bankruptcy, fellow. And now these God-damned dummies blow in\nfrom nowhere with a consignment exclusively for Haarland\u00e2\u0080\u0094I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know\nwhy I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get to hell out of this stupid business and go live in a\nshack on Great Blue Lake and let the planet go ahead and rot.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nRoss\u00e2\u0080\u0099s horror at the unseemly outburst was eclipsed by his interest at\nnoting how similarly he and Oldham had been thinking. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSir,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he\nventured, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve had something on my mind for a while\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt can wait,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Oldham growled, collecting himself with a visible effort.\nSo there went his chance to resign. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat about customs? I know Haarland\nhasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t got enough cash to lay out. Who has?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nRoss said glibly: \u00e2\u0080\u009cUsual arrangement, sir. They turn an estimated\ntwenty-five per cent of the cargo over to the port authority for\nauction, the receipts to be in full discharge of their import tax. And I\nsuppose they enter protective bids. They aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t wasting any\ntime\u00e2\u0080\u0094auction\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 2100 tonight.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou handle it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Oldham muttered. \u00e2\u0080\u009cDon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t go over one hundred thousand\nshields. Diversify the purchases as much as possible. And try to sneak\nsome advance information out of the dummies if you get a chance.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, sir,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ross said. As he left he saw Oldham taking a plastic bottle\nfrom a wall cabinet.\n\nAnd that, thought Ross as he rode to the Free Port, was the first crack\nhe had ever seen in the determined optimism of the trading firm\u00e2\u0080\u0099s top\nlevel. They were optimists and they were idealists, at least to hear\nthem tell it. Interplanetary trading was a cause and a mission; the\ntraders kept the flame of commerce alight. Perhaps, thought Ross, they\nhad been able to indulge in the hypocrisy of idealism only so long as a\npopulation upcurve assured them of an expanding market. Perhaps now that\nbirths were flattening out\u00e2\u0080\u0094some said the dirty word \u00e2\u0080\u009cdeclining\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u0094they all\nwould drop their optimistic creed in favor of fang-and-claw competition\nfor the favors of the dwindling pool of consumers.\n\nAnd that, Ross thought gloomily, was the way he\u00e2\u0080\u0099d go himself if he\nstayed on: junior trader, to senior trader, to master trader, growing\nevery year more paranoidally suspicious of his peers, less scrupulous in\nthe chase of the shield....\n\nBut he was getting out, of course. The purser\u00e2\u0080\u0099s berth awaited. And then,\nperhaps, the awful depressions he had been enduring would lift off him.\nHe thought of the master traders he knew: his own man Oldham, none too\nhappy in the hereditary business; Leverett, still smug and fat with his\nterrific windfall of the Sirius IV starship fifteen years ago; Marconi\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nboss Haarland\u00e2\u0080\u0094Haarland broke the sequence all to hell. It just wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\npossible to think of Haarland being driven by avarice and fear. He was\nthe oldest of them all, but there was more zest and drive in his\nparchment body than in the rest of them combined.\n\nIn the auction hall Ross found a seat near the velvet ropes. One of the\nprofessional bidders lounging against a wall flicked him an almost\nimperceptible signal, and he answered with another. That was that; he\nhad his man, and a good one. They had often worked together in the\ncommodity pits, but not so often or so exclusively that the bidder would\nbe instantly known as his.\n\nInside the enclosure Marconi, seated at a bare table, labored over a\nsheaf of papers with one of the \u00e2\u0080\u009cSonnies\u00e2\u0080\u009d from the ship. Sonny was\nwriggling in coveralls, the first clothes he had ever worn. Ross saw\nthey hadn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t been able to get shoes onto him.\n\nWho else did he know? Captain Delafield was sitting somberly within the\nenclosure; Win Fraley, the hottest auctioneer on the Port, was studying\na list, his lips moving. Every trading firm was represented; the heads\nof the smaller firms were there in person, not daring to delegate the\nbidding job. Plenty of Port personnel, just there for the excitement of\nthe first longliner in fifteen years, even though it was well after\nclose of the business day.\n\nThe goods were in sealed cases against the back wall as usual. Ross\ncould only tell that some of them were perforated and therefore ought to\ncontain living animals. Only the one Sonny from the starship crew was\nthere; presumably the rest were back on the ship. He wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be able to\nfollow Oldham\u00e2\u0080\u0099s orders to snoop out the nature of the freight from them.\nWell, damn Oldham; damn even the auction, Ross thought to himself. His\nmood of gloom did not lift.\n\nThe auction was a kind of letdown. All that turmoil and bustle,\nconcentrated in a tiny arc around the velvet ropes, contrasted\nunpleasantly with the long, vacant rows of dusty seats that stretched to\nthe back of the hall. Maybe a couple of centuries ago Ross would have\nenjoyed the auction more. But now all it made him think of was the thing\nhe had been brooding about for a night and a day, the slow emptying of\nthe planet, the....\n\nDecay.\n\nBut, as usual, no one else seemed to notice or to care.\n\nCaptain Delafield consulted his watch and stood up. He rapped the table.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIn accordance with the rules of the Trade Commission and the\nappropriate governing statutes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he droned, \u00e2\u0080\u009ccertain merchandise will\nnow be placed on public auction. The Haarland Trading Corporation,\nconsignee, agrees and consents to divest itself of merchandise from\nConsignment 97-W amounting by estimate of the customs authorities to\ntwenty-five per cent of the total value of all merchandise in said\nconsignment. All receipts of this auction are to be entered as excise\nduties paid by the consignee on said merchandise, said receipts to\nconstitute payment in full on excise on Consignment 97-W. The clerk will\nrecord; if any person here present wishes to enter an objection let him\ndo so thank you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He glanced at a slip of paper in his hand. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am\nrequested to inform you that the Haarland Trading Corporation has\nentered with the clerk a protective bid of five thousand shields on each\nitem.\u00e2\u0080\u009d There was a rustle in the hall. Five thousand shields was a lot\nof money. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYour auctioneer, Win Fraley,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Captain Delafield, and sat\ndown in the first row of seats.\n\nThe auctioneer took a long, slow swallow of water, his eyes gleaming\nabove the glass at the audience. Theatrically he tossed the glass to an\nassistant, smacked his hands together and grinned. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWell,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he boomed\ngenially, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have to tell you gentlemen that somebody\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to\nget rich tonight. Who knows\u00e2\u0080\u0094maybe it\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be you? But you can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t make money\nwithout spending money, so without any further ado, let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s get started. I\nhave here,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he rapped out briskly, \u00e2\u0080\u009cItem Number One. Now you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know\nand I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know exactly what Item Number One contains, but I can tell\nyou this, they wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have sent it two hundred and thirty-one lights\nif they didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think it was worth something. Let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s get this started with\na rush, folks, and I mean with a big bid to get in the right mood. After\nall, the more you spend here the less you have to pay in taxes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he\nlaughed. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou ready? Here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the dope. Item Number One\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d His assistant\nslapped a carton at the extreme left of the line. \u00e2\u0080\u009c\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0094weight two hundred\nand fifteen grams, net; fifteen cubic centimeters; one microfilm reel\nincluded. Reminds me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he reminisced, \u00e2\u0080\u009cof an item just about that size\non the Sirius IV shipment. Turned out to be Maryjane seeds, and I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\nsuppose I have to tell anybody here how much Mr. Leverett made out of\nMaryjanes; I bet every one of us has been smoking them ever since. What\ndo you say, Mr. Leverett? You did all right last time\u00e2\u0080\u0094want to say ten\nthousand as a first big bid on Item Number One? Nine thousand? Do I\nhear\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0094?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nOne of the smaller traders, not working through a professional bidder,\nnot even decently delegating the work to a junior, bid seventy-five\nhundred shields. Like the spokesmen for the other big traders, Ross sat\non his hands during the early stages. Let the small fry give themselves\na thrill and drop out. The big firms knew to a fraction of a shield how\nmuch the small ones could afford to bid on a blind purchase, and the\neasiest way to handle them was to let them spend their budgets in a\nhurry. Of course the small traders knew all this, and their strategy,\nwhen they could manage it, was to hold back as long as possible. It was\na matter of sensing emotion rather than counting costs; of recognizing\nthe fraction of a second in which a little fellow made up his mind to\nacquire an item and bidding him up\u00e2\u0080\u0094of knowing when he\u00e2\u0080\u0099d gone his limit\nand letting him have it at a ruinous price. It was an art, and Ross,\ndespising it, knew that he did it very, very well.\n\nHe yawned and pretended to read a magazine while the first six items\nwent on the block; the little traders seemed desperate enough to force\nthe price up without help. He bid on Item Seven partly to squeeze a runt\ntrader and partly to test his liaison with his professional bidder. It\nwas perfect; the pro caught his signal\u00e2\u0080\u0094a bored inspection of his\nfingernails\u00e2\u0080\u0094while seeming to peek clumsily at the man from Leverett\u00e2\u0080\u0099s.\n\nRoss let the next two pass and then acquired three items in rapid\nsuccession. The fever had spread to most of the bidders by then; they\nwere starting at ten thousand and up. One or two of the early birds had\nspent their budgets and were leaving, looking sandbagged\u00e2\u0080\u0094as indeed they\nhad been. Ross signaled \u00e2\u0080\u009ctake five\u00e2\u0080\u009d to his professional and strolled out\nfor a cup of coffee.\n\nOn the way back he stopped for a moment outside the hall to look at the\nstars and breathe. There were the familiar constellations\u00e2\u0080\u0094The Plowman,\nthe Rocket Fleet, Marilyn Monroe. He stood smoking a cigarette and\nyearning toward them until somebody moved in the darkness near him.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNice night, Ross,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the man said gloomily.\n\nIt was Captain Delafield. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, hello, sir,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ross said, the world\ndescending around him again like a too-substantial curtain. \u00e2\u0080\u009cTaking a\nbreather?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHad to,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the captain growled. \u00e2\u0080\u009cTen more minutes in that place and I\nwould have thrown. Damned money-grabbing traders. No offense, Ross; just\nthat I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t see how you stand the life. Seems to have got worse in my\ntime. Much worse. You high-rollers goading the pee-wees into shooting\ntheir wads\u00e2\u0080\u0094it didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t use to be like that. Gallantry. Not stomping a\ndowned man. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t see how you stand it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t stand it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ross said quietly. \u00e2\u0080\u009cCaptain Delafield, you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\nknow\u00e2\u0080\u0094I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m so sick to death of the life I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m leading and the work I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m doing\nthat I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d do anything to get away. Mr. Fallon offered me a purser\u00e2\u0080\u0099s spot\non his ship; I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been thinking about it very seriously.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cPurser? A dirty job. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nothing to do except when you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re in port,\nand then there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s so much to do that you never get to see the planet. I\ndon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t recommend it, Ross.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nRoss grunted, thinking. If even the purser\u00e2\u0080\u0099s berth was no way out, what\nwas left for him? Sixty more years of waiting for a starship and\nscheming how to make a profit from its contents? Sixty more years\nwatching Ghost Town grow by nibbles on Halsey City, watching the traders\nwax in savagery as they battled for the ever-diminishing pool of\nconsumers, watching obscene comedies like Lurline of the Old Landowners\ngraciously consenting to wed Marconi of the New Nobodies? He said\nwearily: \u00e2\u0080\u009cThen what shall I do, Captain? Rot here with the rest of the\nplanet?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nDelafield shrugged, suprisingly gentle. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou feel it too, Ross? I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m glad\nto hear it. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not sensitive, thank God, but I know they talk about me.\nThey say I quit the space-going fleet as soon as I had a chance to grab\noff the port captaincy. They\u00e2\u0080\u0099re right; I did. Because I was frightened.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cFrightened? You?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Delafield\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ribbons for a dozen heroic rescues\ngleamed in the light that escaped from the hall.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSure, Ross.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He flicked the ribbons. \u00e2\u0080\u009cEach one of these means I and my\nmen pulled some people out of a jam they got into because of somebody\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\ndamned stupidity or slow reflexes or defective memory. No; I withdraw\nthat. The \u00e2\u0080\u0098Thetis\u00e2\u0080\u0099 got stove in because of mechanical failure, but all\nthe rest were human error. There got to be too many for me; I want to\nenjoy my old age.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cReady to face that if you become a purser? I can tell you that if you\ndon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t like it here you won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be happy on Sunward and you won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t like the\nmoons. And you most especially and particularly won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t like being a\npurser. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the same job you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re doing now, but it pays less, offers you\na six-by-eight cubicle to work and live in, and gives you nothing\nresembling a future to aim at. Now if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll excuse me I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d better get\nback inside. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve enjoyed our talk.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nRoss followed the captain gloomily. Nothing had changed inside; Ross\nlounged in the doorway inconspicuously picking up the eye of his bidder.\nMarconi was gone from the enclosure. Ross looked around hopefully and\nfound his friend in agitated conversation with an unrecognizable but\nalso agitated man at the back of the hall. Ross drifted over. Heads were\nturning in the front rows. As Ross got within range he heard a couple of\nphrases. \u00e2\u0080\u009c\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0094in the ship. Mr. Haarland specially asked for you. Please,\nMr. Marconi!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, hell,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Marconi said disgustedly. \u00e2\u0080\u009cGo on. Tell him I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be there.\nBut how he expects me to take care of things here and\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d He trailed off\nas he caught sight of Ross.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTrouble?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ross asked.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNot exactly. The hell with it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Marconi stared indecisively at the\nauctioneer for a moment. He said obscurely, \u00e2\u0080\u009cTaking your life isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\nenough; he wants more. And I thought I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d be able to see Lurline tonight.\nExcuse me, Ross. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got to get over to the ship.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He hurried out.\n\nRoss looked wonderingly after him, caught the eye of his bidder, and\nwent back to work. By the time the auction was over and dawn was\nbreaking in the west, Oldham Trading had bought nine lots of\nmerchandise: three breathing, five flowering, and one a roll of\nmicrofilm. Ross took his prizes to the office where Charles Oldham was\nwaiting, much the better for a few drinks and a long nap.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHow much?\u00e2\u0080\u009d demanded Oldham. Evidently they were both supposed to ignore\nhis hysteria of the night before.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cFifty-seven thousand,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ross said dully.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cFor nine lots? Good man! With any kind of luck at all\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d And Oldham\nbabbled on and on. He wanted Ross to stay and view the microfilm\nprojection, stand by for a report from a zoologist and a botanist on the\nliving acquisitions. He pleaded weariness and Oldham became conciliatory\nto the wonderful young up-and-comer who had bid in the merchandise at a\nwhopping bargain price.\n\nRoss dragged himself from the building, into a cab, and home. Morosely\nundressing he lit a cigarette and brooded: well, that was it. What you\u00e2\u0080\u0099d\nbeen waiting for since you were a junior apprentice. The starship came,\nyou had the alien prizes in your hands and you realized they were as\ntawdry as the cheap gimcracks you export every week to Sunward.\n\nHe stared out the window, over Ghost Town, to the Field. The sun was\nhigh over the surrounding mountains; he imagined he could pick out the\nreflected glimmer from the starship a dozen miles away. Marconi at least\ngot to examine the ship. Marconi might be there now; he\u00e2\u0080\u0099d been headed\nthat way when Ross saw him last. And evidently not enjoying it much.\nRoss wondered vaguely if anybody really enjoyed anything. He stubbed out\nhis cigarette.\n\nAs he fell asleep he was remembering what Delafield had told him about\nthe moons and the planet ports. His dreams were of the cities of other\nplanets, and every one of them was populated by aloof Delafields and\navaricious Oldhams.\n\n\n\n\n..... 3\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWAKE up, Ross,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Marconi was saying, joggling him. \u00e2\u0080\u009cCome on, wake up.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nRoss thrust himself up on an elbow and opened his eyes. He said with a\ntongue the size of his forearm in a dust-lined mouth: \u00e2\u0080\u009cWha\u00e2\u0080\u0099 time is it?\nWha\u00e2\u0080\u0099 the hell are you doing here, for that matter?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s around noon. You\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve slept for three hours; you can get up.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cUh.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ross automatically reached for a cigarette. The smoke got in his\neyes and he rubbed them; it dehydrated and seared what little healthy\ntissue appeared to be left in his mouth. But it woke him up a little.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat are you doing here?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he demanded.\n\nMarconi\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hand was involuntarily on his breast pocket again, the one in\nwhich he carried Lurline\u00e2\u0080\u0099s picture. He said harshly: \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou want a job?\nTopside? Better than purser?\u00e2\u0080\u009d He wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t meeting Ross\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eye. His gaze\nroved around the apartment and lighted on a coffee maker. He filled it\nand snapped it on. \u00e2\u0080\u009cGet dressed, will you?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he demanded.\n\nRoss sat up. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s this all about, Marconi? What do you want, anyway?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMarconi, for his own reasons, became violently angry. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou\u00e2\u0080\u0099re the\ndamnedest question-asker I ever did meet, Ross. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m trying to do you a\nfavor.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat favor?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ross asked suspiciously.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll find out. You\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been bellyaching to me long enough about how\ndull your poor little life is. Well, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m offering you a chance to do\nsomething big and different. And what do you do? You crawfish. Are you\ninterested or aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you? I told you: It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a space job, and a big one.\nBigger than being a purser for Fallon. Bigger than you can imagine.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nRoss began to struggle into his clothes, no more than half\ncomprehending, but stimulated by the magic words. He asked, puzzling\nsleepily over what Marconi had said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat are you sore about?\u00e2\u0080\u009d His\nguess was that Lurline had broken a date\u00e2\u0080\u0094but it seemed to be the wrong\ntime of day for that.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNothing,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Marconi said grumpily. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOnly I have my own life to live.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He\npoured two cups of coffee. He wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t answer questions while they\nsipped the scalding stuff. But somehow Ross was not surprised when,\ndownstairs, Marconi headed his car along the winding road through Ghost\nTown that led to the Yards.\n\nEvery muscle of Ross\u00e2\u0080\u0099s body was stiff and creaky; another six hours of\nsleep would have been a wonderful thing. But as they drove through the\nrutted streets of Ghost Town he began to feel alive again. He stared out\nthe window at the flashing ruins, piecing together the things Marconi\nhad said.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWatch it!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he yelled, and Marconi swerved the car around a tumbled\nwall. Ross was shaking, but Marconi only drove faster. This was crazy!\nYou didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t race through Ghost Town as though you were on the pleasure\nparkways around the Great Blue Lake; it wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t safe. The buildings had\nto fall over from time to time\u00e2\u0080\u0094nobody, certainly, bothered to keep them\nin repair. And nobody bothered to pick up the pieces when they fell,\neither, until the infrequent road-mending teams made their rounds.\n\nBut at last they were out of Ghost Town, on the broad highway from\nHalsey City to the port. The administration building and car park was\njust ahead.\n\nIt was there that Marconi spoke again. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m assuming, Ross, that you\nweren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t snowing me when you said you wanted thrills, chills, and change\ngalore.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not the way I put it. But I wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t snowing you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll get them. Come on.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe led Ross across the field to the longliner, past a gaggle of\nlaughing, chattering Sonnies and Mas. He ignored them.\n\nThe longliner was a giant of a ship, a blunt torpedo a hundred meters\ntall. It had no ports\u00e2\u0080\u0094naturally enough; the designers of the ship\ncertainly didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t find any reason for its idiot crew to look out into\nspace, and landings and takeoffs would be remote-controlled. Two hundred\nyears old it was; but its metal was as bright, its edges as sharp, as\nthe newest of the moon freighters at the other end of the hardstand. Two\nhundred years\u00e2\u0080\u0094a long trip, but an almost unimaginably long distance that\ntrip covered. For the star that spawned it was undoubtedly almost as far\naway as light would travel in two centuries\u00e2\u0080\u0099 time. At 186,000 miles per\nsecond, sixty seconds in a minute, sixty minutes in an hour. Ross\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nimagination gave up the task. It was far.\n\nHe stared about him in fascination as they entered the ship. He gaped at\nsterile, gray-walled cubicles, each of which contained the same chair\nand cot\u00e2\u0080\u0094no screen or projector for longliners. Ross remembered his rash\nwords of the day before about shipping out on a longliner, and\nshuddered.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHere we are,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Marconi stopping before a closed door. He knocked\nand entered.\n\nIt was a cubicle like the others, but there were reels stacked on the\nfloor and a projector. Sitting on the cot in a just-awakened attitude\nwas old man Haarland himself. Beady-eyed, Ross thought. Watchful.\n\nHaarland asked: \u00e2\u0080\u009cRoss?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, sir,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Marconi said. There was tension in his voice and attitude.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDo you want me to stay, sir?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHaarland growled: \u00e2\u0080\u009cGood God, no. You can get out. Sit down, Ross.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nRoss sat down. Marconi, carefully looking neither to right or left, went\nout and closed the door. Haarland stretched, scratched, and yawned. He\nsaid: \u00e2\u0080\u009cRoss, Marconi tells me you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re quite a fellow. Sincere, competent,\na good man to give a tough job to. Namely, his.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cJunior-Fourth Trader?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ross asked, bewildered.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cA little more dramatic than that\u00e2\u0080\u0094but we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll come to the details in a\nminute. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m told you were ready to quit Oldham for a purser\u00e2\u0080\u0099s berth.\nThat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ethical. Would you consider it unethical to quit Oldham for\nHaarland?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes\u00e2\u0080\u0094I think I would.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGlad to hear it! What if the work had absolutely nothing to do with\ntrading and never brings you into a competitive situation with Oldham?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ross scratched his jaw. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, I think that would be all right.\nBut a Junior Fourth\u00e2\u0080\u0099s job, Mr. Haarland\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d The floor bucked and surged\nunder him. He gasped, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat was that?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBlastoff, I imagine,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Haarland said calmly. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re taking off. Better\nlie down.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nRoss flopped to the floor. It was no time to argue, not with the\nfirst-stage pumps thundering and the preheaters roaring their threat of\nan imminent four-G thrust.\n\nIt came like thunder, slapping Ross against the floor plates as though\nhe were glued to them. He felt every tiny wrinkle in every weld he lay\non, and one arm had fallen across a film reel. He heaved, and succeeded\nin levering it off the reel. It thwacked to the floor as though sandbags\nwere stacked meters-high atop it.\n\nBlackout came very soon.\n\nHe awoke in free fall. He was orbiting aimlessly about the cubicle.\n\nHaarland was strapped to the cot, absorbed in manipulating the portable\nprojector, trying to thread a free-floating film. Ross bumped against\nthe old man; Haarland abstractedly shoved him off.\n\nHe careened from a bulkhead and flailed for a grip.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Haarland, looking up. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAwake?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, awake!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ross said bitterly. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat is all this? Where are we?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe old man said formally, \u00e2\u0080\u009cPlease forgive my cavalier treatment of you.\nYou must not blame your friend Marconi; he had no idea that I was\nplanning an immediate blastoff with you. I had an assignment for him\nwhich he\u00e2\u0080\u0094he preferred not to accept. Not to mince words, Ross, he quit.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cQuit his job?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe old man shook his head. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, Ross. Quit much more than the job of\nworking for me. He quit on an assignment which is\u00e2\u0080\u0094I am sorry if it\nsounds melodramatic\u00e2\u0080\u0094absolutely vital to the human race.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He suddenly\nfrowned. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0094I think,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he added weakly. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBear with me, Ross. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll try to\nexplain as I go along. But, you see, Marconi left me in the lurch. I\nneeded him and he failed me. He felt that you would be glad to take it\non, and he told me something about you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Haarland glowered at Ross and\nsaid, with a touch of bitterness, \u00e2\u0080\u009cA recommendation from Marconi, at\nthis particular point, is hardly any recommendation at all. But I\nhaven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t much choice\u00e2\u0080\u0094and, besides, I took the liberty of calling that\npompous young fool you work for.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMister Haarland!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ross cried, outraged. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOldham may not be any prize\nbut really\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, you know he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a fool. But he had a lot to say about you. Enough so\nthat, if you want the assignment, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s yours. As to the nature of the\nassignment itself\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d Haarland hesitated, then said briskly, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe\nassignment itself has to do with a message my organization received via\nthis longliner. Yes, a message. You\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll see. It has also to do with\ncertain facts I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve found in its log which, if I can ever get this damned\nthing working\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0094There we are.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe had succeeded in threading the film.\n\nHe snapped on the projector. On the screen appeared a densely packed\nblock of numerals, rolling up and being replaced by new lines as fast as\nthe eye could take them in. Haarland said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cNotice anything?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nRoss swallowed. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf that stuff is supposed to mean anything to me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he\ndeclared, \u00e2\u0080\u009cit doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHaarland frowned. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut Marconi said\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0094Well, never mind.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He snapped off\nthe projector. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat was the ship\u00e2\u0080\u0099s log, Ross. It doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t matter if you\ncan\u00e2\u0080\u0099t read it; you wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t, I suppose, have had much call for that sort\nof thing working for Oldham. It is a mathematical description of the\nrouting of this ship, from the time it was space-launched until it\narrived here yesterday. It took a long time, Ross. The reason that it\ntook a long time is partly that it came from far away. But, even more,\nthere is another reason. We were not this ship\u00e2\u0080\u0099s destination! Not the\noriginal destination. We weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even the first alternate\u00e2\u0080\u0094or the second\nalternate. To be exact, Ross, we were the seventh choice for this ship.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nRoss let go of his stanchion, floated a yard, and flailed back to it.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ridiculous, Mr. Haarland,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he protested. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBesides, what has all\nthis to do with\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBear with an old man,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Haarland, with an amused gleam in his eye.\n\nThere was very little he could do but bear with him, Ross thought\nsourly. \u00e2\u0080\u009cGo on,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said.\n\nHaarland said professorially, \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is conceivable, of course, that a\nplanet might be asleep at the switch. We could believe it, I suppose, if\nit seemed that the first-choice planet somehow didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t pick the ship up\nwhen this longliner came into radar range. In that event, of course, it\nwould orbit once or twice on automatics, and then select for its first\nalternate target\u00e2\u0080\u0094which it did. It might be a human failure in the GCA\nstation\u00e2\u0080\u0094once.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He nodded earnestly. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOnce, Ross. Not six times. No\nplanet passes up a trading ship.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMr. Haarland,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ross exploded, \u00e2\u0080\u009cit seems to me that you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re contradicting\nyourself all over the place. Did six planets pass this ship up or didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\nsix planets pass this ship up? Which is it? And why would anybody pass a\nlongliner up anyhow?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHaarland asked, \u00e2\u0080\u009cSuppose the planets were vacant?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ross was shaken. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s silly! I mean, even I know that the\nstar charts show which planets are inhabited and which aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd suppose the star charts are wrong. Suppose the planets have become\nvacant. The people have died off, perhaps; their culture decayed.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nDecay. Death and decay.\n\nRoss was silent for a long time. He took a deep breath. He said at last,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSorry. I won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t interrupt again.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHaarland\u00e2\u0080\u0099s expression was a weft of triumph and relief. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSix planets\npassed this ship up. Remember Leverett\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ship fifteen years ago? Three\nplanets passed that one before it came to us. Nine different planets,\nall listed on the traditional star charts as inhabited, civilized,\nequipped with GCA radars, and everything else needed. Nine planets out\nof communication, Ross.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nDecay, thought Ross. Aloud he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cTell me why.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHaarland shook his head. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNo,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said strongly, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI want you to tell me.\nI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll tell you what I can. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll tell you the message that this ship\nbrought to me. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll tell you all I know, all I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve told Marconi that he\nisn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t man enough to use, and the things that Marconi will never learn,\nas well. But why nine planets that used to be pretty much like our own\nplanet are now out of communication, that you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have to tell me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nForward rockets boomed; the braking blasts hurled Ross against the\nforward bulkhead. Haarland rummaged under the cot for space suits. He\nflung one at Ross.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cPut it on,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he ordered. \u00e2\u0080\u009cCome to the airlock. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll show you what you\ncan use to find out the answers.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He slid into the pressure suit, dived\nweightless down the corridor, Ross zooming after.\n\nThey stood in the airlock, helmets sealed. Wordlessly Haarland opened\nthe pet cocks, heaved on the lock door. He gestured with an arm.\n\nFloating alongside them was a ship, a ship like none Ross had ever seen\nbefore.\n\n\n\n\n..... 4\n\n\nPICTURE Leif\u00e2\u0080\u0099s longboat bobbing in the swells outside Ambrose Light,\nwhile the twentieth-century liners steam past; a tiny, ancient thing,\nrelated to the new giants only as the Eohippus resembles the horse.\n\nThe ship that Haarland revealed was fully as great a contrast. Ross knew\nspaceships as well as any grounder could, both the lumbering interplanet\nfreighters and the titanic longliners. But the ship that swung around\nHalsey\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Planet was a midget (fueled rocket ships must be huge); its\njets were absurdly tiny, clearly incapable of blasting away from\nplanetary gravity; its entire hull length was unbroken and sheer (did\nthe pilot dare fly blind?).\n\nThe coupling connections were being rigged between the ships. \u00e2\u0080\u009cCome\naboard,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Haarland, spryly wriggling through the passage. Ross,\nswallowing his astonishment, followed.\n\nThe ship was tiny indeed. When Ross and Haarland, clutching handholds,\nwere drifting weightlessly in its central control cabin, they very\nnearly filled it. There was one other cabin, Ross saw; and the two\ncompartments accounted for a good nine-tenths of the cubage of the ship.\nWhere that left space for the combustion chambers and the fuel tanks,\nthe crew quarters, and the cargo holds, Ross could not imagine. He said:\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAll right, Mr. Haarland. Talk.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHaarland grinned toothily, his expression eerie in the flickering violet\nlight that issued from a gutter around the cabin\u00e2\u0080\u0099s wall.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is a spaceship, Ross. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a pretty old one\u00e2\u0080\u0094fourteen hundred\nyears, give or take a little. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not much to look at, compared with\nthe up-to-date models you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re used to, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s got a few features that\nyou won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t find on the new ones. For one thing, Ross, it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t use\nrockets.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He hesitated. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAsk me what it does use,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he admitted, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand I\ncan\u00e2\u0080\u0099t tell you. I know the name, because I read it: nucleophoretic\ndrive. What nucleophoresis is and how it works, I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t say. They call\nit the Wesley Effect, and the tech manual says something about squared\nmiles of acceleration. Does that mean anything to you? No. How could it?\nBut it works, Ross. It works well enough so that this little ship will\nget you where you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going very quickly. The stars, Ross\u00e2\u0080\u0094it will take\nyou to the stars. Faster than light. What the top speed is I have no\nidea; but there is a ship\u00e2\u0080\u0099s log here, too. And it has a three-month\nentry\u00e2\u0080\u0094three months, Ross!\u00e2\u0080\u0094in which this little ship explored the solar\nsystems of fourteen stars.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWide-eyed, Ross held motionless. Haarland paused. \u00e2\u0080\u009cFourteen hundred\nyears,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he repeated. \u00e2\u0080\u009cFourteen hundred years this ship has been floating\nout here. And for all that time, the longliners have been crawling from\nstar to star, while little hidden ships like this one could have carried\na thousand times as much goods a million times faster. Maybe the time\nhas come to get the ships out of hiding. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know. I want to find\nout; I want you to find out for me. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be specific, Ross. I need a\npilot. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m too old, and Marconi turned it down. Someone has to go out\nthere\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d he gestured to the blind hull and the unseen stars beyond\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009cand\nfind out why nine planets are out of communication. Will you do it?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nRoss opened his mouth to speak, and a thousand questions competed for\nutterance. But what he said, barely aloud, was only: \u00e2\u0080\u009cYes.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe far-off stars\u00e2\u0080\u0094more than a thousand million of them in our galaxy\nalone. By far the greatest number of them drifted alone through space,\nor with only a stellar companion as utterly unlivable by reason of heat\nand crushing gravity as themselves. Fewer than one in a million had a\nfamily of planets, and most even of those could never become a home for\nhuman life.\n\nBut out of a thousand million, any fraction may be a very large number,\nand the number of habitable planets was in the hundreds.\n\nRoss had seen the master charts of the inhabited universe often enough\nto recognize the names as Haarland mentioned them: Tau Ceti II, Earth,\nthe eight inhabitable worlds of Capella. But to realize that this\nship\u00e2\u0080\u0094this ship!\u00e2\u0080\u0094had touched down on each of them, and on a hundred more,\nwas beyond astonishment; it was a dream thing, impossible but\nunquestioned.\n\nThrough Haarland\u00e2\u0080\u0099s burning, old eyes, Ross looked back through fourteen\ncenturies, to the time when this ship was a scout vessel for a\ncolonizing colossus. The lumbering giant drove slowly through space on\nits one-way trip from the planet that built it\u00e2\u0080\u0094was it semi-mythical\nEarth? The records were not clear\u00e2\u0080\u0094while the tiny scout probed each star\nand solar system as it drew within range. While the mother ship was\ncovering a few hundred million miles, the scout might flash across\nparsecs to scan half a dozen worlds. And when the scout came back with\nword of a planet where humans could survive, they christened it with the\nname of the scout\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pilot, and the chartroom labored, and the ship\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nofficers gave orders, and the giant\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nose swerved through a half a\ndegree and began its long, slow deceleration.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy slow?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ross demanded. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy not use the faster-than-light drive for\nthe big ships?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHaarland grimaced. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got to answer that one for you sooner or\nlater,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut let me make it later. Anyway, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what this\nship was: a faster-than-light scout ship for a real longliner. What\nhappened to the longliner the records don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show; my guess is the\ncolonists cannibalized it to get a start in constructing homes for\nthemselves. But the scout ship was exempted. The captain of the\nexpedition had it put in an orbit out here, and left alone. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been\nused a little bit, now and then\u00e2\u0080\u0094my great-grandfather\u00e2\u0080\u0099s father went clear\nto 40 Eridani when my great-grandfather was a little boy, but by and\nlarge it has been left alone. It had to be, Ross. For one thing, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\ndangerous to the man who pilots it. For another, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dangerous to\u00e2\u0080\u0094the\nGalaxy.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHaarland\u00e2\u0080\u0099s view was anthropomorphic; the danger was not to the immense\nand uncaring galaxy, but to the sparse fester of life that called itself\nhumanity.\n\nWhen the race abandoned Earth, it was a gesture of revulsion. Behind\nthem they left a planet that had decimated itself in wars; ahead lay a\ncosmos that, in all their searches, had revealed no truly sentient life.\n\nEarth was a crippled world, the victim of its playing with nuclear\nfission and fusion. But the techniques that gave them a\nfaster-than-light drive gave them as well a weapon that threatened solar\nsystems, not cities; that could detonate a sun as readily as uranium\ncould destroy a building. The child with his forbidden matches was now\nsitting atop a munitions dump; the danger was no longer a seared hand or\nblinded eye, but annihilation.\n\nAnd the decision had been made: secrecy. By what condign struggles the\nsecrecy had been enforced, the secrecy itself concealed. But it had\nworked. Once the radiating colonizers had reached their goals, the\nnucleophoretic effect had been obliterated from their records and,\nexcept for a single man on each planet, from their minds.\n\nWhy the single man? Why not bury it entirely?\n\nHaarland said slowly, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere was always the chance that something would\ngo wrong, you see. And\u00e2\u0080\u0094it has.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nRoss said hesitantly, \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou mean the nine planets that have gone out of\ncommunication?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHaarland nodded. He hesitated. \u00e2\u0080\u009cDo you understand it now?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he asked.\n\nRoss shook his head dizzily. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m trying,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis little ship\u00e2\u0080\u0094it\ntravels faster than light. It has been circling out here\u00e2\u0080\u0094how long?\nFourteen hundred years? And you kept it secret\u00e2\u0080\u0094you and your ancestors\nbefore you because you were afraid it might be used in war?\u00e2\u0080\u009d He was\nfrowning.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNot \u00e2\u0080\u0098afraid\u00e2\u0080\u0099 it would be used,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Haarland corrected gently. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe knew it\nwould be used.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nRoss grimaced. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, why tell me about it now? Do you expect me to keep\nit secret all the rest of my life?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI think you would,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Haarland said soberly.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut suppose I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t? Suppose I blabbed all over the Galaxy, and it was\nused in war?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHaarland\u00e2\u0080\u0099s face was suddenly, queerly gray. He said, almost to himself,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt seems that there are things worse than war.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Abruptly he smiled.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLet\u00e2\u0080\u0099s find Ma.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThey returned through the coupling and searched the longliner for the\nold woman. A Sonny told them, \u00e2\u0080\u009cMa usually hangs around the meter room.\nLikes to see them blinking.\u00e2\u0080\u009d And there they found her.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHello, Haarland,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she smiled, flashing her superb teeth. \u00e2\u0080\u009cDid you find\nwhat you were looking for?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cPerfect, Ma. I want to talk to you under the seal.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe looked at Ross. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHim?\u00e2\u0080\u009d she asked.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI vouch for him,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Haarland said gravely. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWesley.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe answered, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe limiting velocity is C.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut C^2 is not a velocity,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Haarland said. He turned to Ross. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSorry\nto make a mystery,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he apologized. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a recognition formula. It\nidentifies one member of what we call the Wesley families, or its\nmessenger, to another. And these people are messengers. They were\ndispatched a couple of centuries ago by a Wesley family whose ship, for\nsome reason, no longer could be used. Why?\u00e2\u0080\u0094I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know why. Try your\nluck, maybe you can figure it out. Ma, tell us the history again.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe knitted her brows and began to chant slowly:\n\n          \u00e2\u0080\u009cIn great-grandfather\u00e2\u0080\u0099s time the target was Clyde,\n          Rocketry firm and ores on the side.\n          If we hadn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t of seen them direct we\u00e2\u0080\u0099d of missed \u00e2\u0080\u0099em;\n          There wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t a blip from the whole damn system.\n              That was the first.\n          Before great-grandfather\u00e2\u0080\u0099s day was done\n          We cut the orbit of Cyrnus One.\n          The contact there was Trader McCue,\n          But the sons o\u00e2\u0080\u0099 bitches missed us too.\n              That was the second.\n          My grandpa lived to see the green\n          Of Target Three through the high-powered screen.\n          But where in hell was Builder Carruthers?\n          They let us go by like all the others.\n              That was the\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMa,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Haarland. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThanks very much, but would you skip to the last\none?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMa grinned.\n\n            The Haarland Trading Corp. was last\n            With the fuel down low and going fast.\n            I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m glad it was me who saw the day\n            When they brought us down on GCA.\n            I told him the message; he called it a mystery,\n            But anyway this is the end of the history.\n                And it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s about time!\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe message, please,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Haarland said broodingly.\n\nMa took a deep breath and rattled off: \u00e2\u0080\u009cL-sub-T equals L-sub-zero e to\nthe minus-T-over-two-N.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nRoss gaped. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the message?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cUsed to be more to it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ma said cheerfully \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all there is now,\nthough. The darn thing doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t rhyme or anything. I guess that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the\nmost important part. Anyway, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the hardest.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not as bad as it seems,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Haarland told Ross. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve asked around.\nIt makes a very little sense.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt does?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, up to a point,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Haarland qualified. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt seems to be a formula in\ngenetics. The notation is peculiar, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all explained, of course.\nIt has something to do with gene loss. Now, maybe that means something\nand maybe it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t. But I know something that does mean something:\nsome member of a Wesley Family a couple of hundred years ago thought it\nwas important enough to want to get it across to other Wesley families.\nSomething\u00e2\u0080\u0099s happening. Let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s find out what it is, Ross.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The old man\nsuddenly buried his face in his hands. In a cracked voice he mumbled,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGene loss and war. Gene loss or war. God, I wish somebody would take\nthis right out of my hands\u00e2\u0080\u0094or that I could drop with a heart attack this\nminute. You ever think of war, Ross?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShocked and embarrassed, Ross mumbled some kind of answer. One might\nthink of war, good breeding taught, but one never talked about it.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou should,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the old man said hoarsely. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWar is what this\nfaster-than-light secrecy and identification rigmarole is all about.\nRight now war is impossible\u00e2\u0080\u0094between solar systems, anyhow, and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nwhat counts. A planet might just barely manage to fit an invading\nmultigeneration expedition at gigantic cost, but it never would. The\nfruits of victory\u00e2\u0080\u0094loot, political domination, maybe slaves\u00e2\u0080\u0094would never\ncome back to the fitters of the expedition but to their remote\ndescendants. A firm will take a flyer on a commercial deal like that,\nbut no nation would accept a war on any such basis\u00e2\u0080\u0094because a conqueror\nis a man, and men die. With F-T-L\u00e2\u0080\u0094faster-than-light travel\u00e2\u0080\u0094they might\ninvade Curnus or Azor or any of those other tempting dots on the master\nmaps. Why not? Take the marginal population, hop them up with patriotic\nfervor and lust for booty, and ship them off to pillage and destroy.\nThere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s at least a fifty per cent chance of coming out ahead on the\ninvestment, isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t there? Much more attractive deal commercially speaking\nthan our present longliners.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nRoss had never seen a war. The last on Halsey\u00e2\u0080\u0099s planet had been the\nPeninsular Rebellion about a century and a half ago. Some half a million\nconstitutional psychopathic inferiors had started themselves an ideal\nsociety with theocratic trimmings in a remote and unfruitful corner of\nthe planet. Starved and frustrated by an unrealistic moral creed they\nfinally exploded to devastate their neighboring areas and were quickly\nquarantined by a radioactive zone. They disintegrated internally,\nmassacred their priesthood, and were permitted to disperse. It was\nregarded as a shameful episode by every dweller on the planet. It wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\na subject for popular filmreels; if you wanted to find out about the\nPeninsular Rebellion you went through many successive library doors and\nsigned your name on lists, and were sternly questioned as to your age\nand scholarly qualifications and reasons for sniffing around such an\nunsavory mess.\n\nRoss therefore had not the slightest comprehension of Haarland\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nanxiety. He told him so.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI hope you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re right,\u00e2\u0080\u009d was all the old man would say. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI hope you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\nlearn worse.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n                  *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe rest was work.\n\nHe had the Yard worker\u00e2\u0080\u0099s familiarity with conventional rocketry, which\nsaved him some study of the fine-maneuvering apparatus of the F-T-L\ncraft\u00e2\u0080\u0094but not much. For a week under Haarland\u00e2\u0080\u0099s merciless drilling he\njetted the ship about its remote area of space, far from the commerce\nlanes, until the old man grudgingly pronounced himself satisfied.\n\nThere were skull-busting sessions with the Wesley drive, or rather with\na first derivative of it, an insane-looking object which you could\nvaguely describe as a fan-shaped slide rule taller than a man. There\nwere twenty-seven main tracks, analogues of the twenty-seven main\ngeodesics of Wesley Space\u00e2\u0080\u0094whatever they were and whatever that was. Your\ncursor settings on the main tracks depended on a thirty-two step\ncomputation based on the apparent magnitudes of the twenty-seven nearest\ncelestial bodies above a certain mass which varied according to yet\nanother lengthy relationship. Then, having cleared the preliminaries out\nof the way, you began to solve for your actual setting on the F-T-L\ndrive controls.\n\nSomehow he mastered it, while Haarland, driving himself harder than he\ndrove the youth who was to be his exploring eyes and ears, coached him\nand cursed him and\u00e2\u0080\u0094somehow!\u00e2\u0080\u0094kept his own complicated affairs going back\non Halsey\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Planet. When Ross had finally got the theory of the Wesley\nDrive in some kind of order in his mind, and had learned all there was\nto learn about the other worlds, and had cut his few important ties with\nHalsey\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Planet, he showed up in Haarland\u00e2\u0080\u0099s planet-based office for a\nfinal, repetitive briefing.\n\nMarconi was there.\n\nHe had trouble meeting Ross\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eyes, but his handclasp was firm and his\nvoice warmly friendly\u00e2\u0080\u0094and a little envious. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe very best, Ross,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he\nsaid. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0094I wish\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d He hesitated and stammered. He said, in a flood,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDamn it, I should be going! Do a good job, Ross\u00e2\u0080\u0094and I hope you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\nhate me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d And he left while Ross, disturbed, went in to see old man\nHaarland.\n\nHaarland spared no time for sentiment. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou\u00e2\u0080\u0099re cleared for space\nflight,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he growled. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAccording to the visa, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to Sunward\u00e2\u0080\u0094in\ncase anyone asks you between here and the port. Actually, let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hear\nwhere you _are_ going.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nRoss said promptly, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am going on a mission of exploration and\nreconnaissance. My first proposed destination is Ragansworld; second\nGemser, third Azor. If I cannot make contact with any of these three\nplanets, I will select planets at random from the master charts until I\nfind some Wesley Drive families somewhere. The contacts for the first\nthree planets are: On Ragansworld, Foley Associates; on Gemser, the\nFranklin Foundation; on Azor, Cavallo Machine Tool Company. F-T-L\ncontacts on other planets are listed in the appendix to the master\ncharts. The co-ordinates for Ragansworld are\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSkip the co-ordinates,\u00e2\u0080\u009d mumbled Haarland, rubbing his eyes. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat do\nyou do when you get in contact with a Wesley Drive family?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nRoss hesitated and licked his lips. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0094well, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a little hard\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDammit,\u00e2\u0080\u009d roared Haarland, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve told you a _thousand_ times\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYessir, I know. All I meant was I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t exactly understand what I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m\nlooking for.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIf I knew what you were to look for,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Haarland rasped, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have\nto send you out looking! Can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you get it through your thick head?\n_Something_ is wrong. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know what. Maybe I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m crazy for bothering\nabout it\u00e2\u0080\u0094heaven knows, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got troubles enough right here\u00e2\u0080\u0094but we\nHaarlands have a tradition of service, and maybe it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s so old that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve\nkind of forgotten just what it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all about. But it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not so old that\nI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve forgotten the family tradition. If I had a son, he\u00e2\u0080\u0099d be doing this.\nI counted on Marconi to be my son; now all I have left is you. And\nthat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s little enough, heaven knows,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he finished bitterly.\n\nRoss, wounded, said by rote: \u00e2\u0080\u009cOn landing, I will attempt at once to make\ncontact with the local Wesley Drive family, using the recognition codes\ngiven me. I will report to them on all the data at hand and suggest the\nneed for action.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHaarland stood up. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAll right,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSorry I snapped at you. Come\non; I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll go up to the ship with you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd that was the way it happened. Ross found himself in the longliner,\nthen with Haarland in the tiny, ancient, faster-than-light ship which\nhad once been tender to the ship that colonized Halsey\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Planet. He\nfound himself shaking hands with a red-eyed, suddenly-old Haarland,\nwatching him crawl through the coupling to the longliner, watching the\nlongliner blast away.\n\nHe found himself setting up the F-T-L course and throwing in the drive.\n\n\n\n\n..... 5\n\n\nROSS was lucky. The second listed inhabited planet was still inhabited.\n\nHe had not quite stopped shuddering from the first when the approach\nradar caught him. The first planet was given in the master charts as\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cRagansworld. Pop. 900,000,000; diam. 9400 m.; mean orbit 0.8 AU,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and\nits co-ordinates went on to describe it as the fourth planet of a small\nG-type sun. There had been some changes made: the co-ordinates now\nintersected well inside a bright and turbulent gas cloud.\n\nIt appeared that suppressing the F-T-L drive had not quite annihilated\nwar.\n\nBut the second planet, Gemser\u00e2\u0080\u0094there, he was sure, was a world where\nnothing was seriously awry.\n\nHe left the ship mumbling a name to himself: \u00e2\u0080\u009cFranklin Foundation.\u00e2\u0080\u009d And\nhe was greeted by a corporal\u00e2\u0080\u0099s guard of dignified and ceremonially\ndressed men; they smiled at him, welcomed him, shook his hand, and\ninvited him to what seemed to be the local equivalent of the\nadministration building. He noticed disapprovingly that they didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t seem\nto go in for the elaborate decontamination procedures of Halsey\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nPlanet, but perhaps, he thought, they had bred disease-resistance into\ntheir bloodlines. Certainly the four men in his guide party seemed hale\nand well-preserved, though the youngest of them was not less than sixty.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI would like,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cto be put in touch with the Franklin\nFoundation, please.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCome right in here,\u00e2\u0080\u009d beamed one of the four, and another said:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t worry about a thing.\u00e2\u0080\u009d They held the door for him, and he walked\ninto a small and sybaritically furnished room. The second man said,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cJust a few questions. Where are you from?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nRoss said simply, \u00e2\u0080\u009cHalsey\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Planet,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and waited.\n\nNothing happened, except that all four men nodded comprehendingly, and\nthe questioner made a mark on a sheet of paper. Ross amplified,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cFifty-three light years away. You know\u00e2\u0080\u0094another star.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCertainly,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the man said briskly. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYour name?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nRoss told him, but with a considerable feeling of deflation. He thought\nwryly of his own feelings about the longlines and the far stars; he\nremembered the stir and community excitement that a starship meant back\nhome. Still, Ross told himself. Halsey\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Planet might be just a back\neddy in the main currents of civilization. Quite possibly on another\nworld\u00e2\u0080\u0094this one, for instance\u00e2\u0080\u0094travelers from the stars were a\ncommonplace. The field hadn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t seemed overly busy, though; and there was\nnothing resembling a spaceship. Unless\u00e2\u0080\u0094he thought with a sudden sense of\nshock\u00e2\u0080\u0094those rusting hulks clumped together at the edge of the field had\nonce been spaceships. But that was hardly likely, he reassured himself.\nYou just don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t let spaceships rust.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSex?\u00e2\u0080\u009d the man asked, and \u00e2\u0080\u009cAge?\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cEducation?\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cMarital status?\u00e2\u0080\u009d The\nquestions went on for more time than Ross quite understood; and they\nseemed far from relevant questions for the most part; and some of them\nwere hard questions to answer. \u00e2\u0080\u009cTau quotient?\u00e2\u0080\u009d for instance; Ross\nblinked and said, with an edge to his voice:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know what a tau quotient is.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cPut him down as zero,\u00e2\u0080\u009d one of the men advised, and the interlocutor\nnodded happily.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWorking-with-others rating?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he asked, beaming.\n\nRoss said with controlled irritation, \u00e2\u0080\u009cLook, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know anything about\nthese ratings. Will you take me to somebody who can put me in touch with\nthe Franklin Foundation?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe man who was sitting next to him patted him gently on the shoulder.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cJust answer the questions,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said comfortably. \u00e2\u0080\u009cEverything will be\nall right.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nRoss flared, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe hell everything will\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nSomething with electrified spikes in it hit him on the back of the neck.\n\nRoss yelled and ducked away; the man next to him returned a little rod\nto his pocket. He smiled at Ross. \u00e2\u0080\u009cDon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t feel bad,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said\nsympathetically. \u00e2\u0080\u009cGo ahead now, answer the questions.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nRoss shook his head dazedly. The pain was already leaving his neck, but\nhe felt nauseated by the suddenness and sharpness of it; he could not\nremember any pain quite like that in his life. He stood up waveringly\nand said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWait a minute, now\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThis time it was the man on the other side, and the pain was about twice\nas sharp. Ross found himself on the floor, looking up through a haze.\nThe man on his right kept the rod in his hand, and the expression on his\nface, while in no way angry, was stern. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBad boy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said tenderly.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you want to answer the questions?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nRoss gasped, \u00e2\u0080\u009cGod damn it, all I want is to see somebody! Keep your\ndirty hands off me, you old fools!\u00e2\u0080\u009d And that was a mistake, as he\nlearned in the blessedly few minutes before he passed out completely\nunder the little rods held by the gentle but determined men.\n\nHe answered all the questions\u00e2\u0080\u0094bound to a chair, with two of the men\nbehind him, when he had regained consciousness. He answered every one.\nThey only had to hit him twice.\n\nWhen they untied him the next morning, Ross had caught on to the local\nfolkways quite well. The fatherly fellow who released him said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cFollow\nme,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and stood back, smiling but with one hand on one of the little\nrods. And Ross was careful to say:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, sir!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThey rode in a three-wheeled car, and entered a barracks-like building.\nRoss was left alone next to a bed in a dormitory with half a hundred\nbeds. \u00e2\u0080\u009cJust wait here,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the man said, smiling. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe rest of your group\nis out at their morning session now. When they come in for lunch you can\njoin them. They\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll show you what to do.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nRoss didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have too long to wait. He spent the time in conjecture as\nconfused as it was fruitless; he had obviously done something wrong, but\njust what was it?\n\nIf he had had twice as long he would have got no farther toward an\nanswer than he was: nowhere. But a noise outside ended his speculations.\nHe glanced toward the curiously shaped door\u00e2\u0080\u0094all the doors on this planet\nseemed to be rectangular. A girl of about eighteen was peering inside.\n\nShe stared at Ross and said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cOh!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Then she disappeared. There were\nfootsteps and whispers, and more heads appeared and blinked at him and\nwere jerked back.\n\nRoss stood up in wretched apprehension. All of a sudden he was fourteen\nyears old again, and entering a new school where the old hands were\ngiggling and whispering about the new boy. He swore sullenly to himself.\n\nA new face appeared, halted for an inspection of Ross, and walked\nconfidently in. The man was a good forty years old, Ross thought;\nperhaps a kind of overseer in this institution\u00e2\u0080\u0094whatever kind of\ninstitution it was. He approached Ross at a sedate pace, and he was\nfollowed through the door in single file by a couple score men and\nwomen. They ranged in age, Ross thought wonderingly, from the leader\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nforty down to the late teens of the girl who had first peered in the\ndoor, and now was at the end of the procession.\n\nThe leader said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cHow old are you?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy, uh\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ross figured confusedly: this planet\u00e2\u0080\u0099s annual orbital period\nwas roughly forty per cent longer than his own; fourteen into his age,\nmultiplied by ten, making his age in their local calculations....\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m nineteen of your years old, about. And a half.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes. And what can you do?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLook here, sir. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been through all this once. Why don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you go and\nask those gentlemen who brought me here? And can anybody tell me where\nthe Franklin Foundation is?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe fortyish fellow, with a look of outrage, slapped Ross across the\nmouth. Ross knocked him down with a roundhouse right.\n\nA girl yelled, \u00e2\u0080\u009cGood for you, Junior!\u00e2\u0080\u009d and jumped like a wildcat onto a\nslim, gray-haired lady, clawing, and slapping. The throng dissolved\nimmediately into a wild melee. Ross, busily fighting off the fortyish\nfellow and a couple of his stocky buddies, noted only that the scrap was\nyouth against age, whatever it meant.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHow _dare_ you?\u00e2\u0080\u009d a voice thundered, and the rioters froze.\n\nA decrepit wreck was standing in the doorway, surrounded by three or\nfour gerontological textbook cases only a little less spavined than he.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGlory,\u00e2\u0080\u009d a girl muttered despairingly. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt would be the minister.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat is the meaning of this brawl?\u00e2\u0080\u009d rolled from the wreck\u00e2\u0080\u0099s shriveled\nlips in a rich basso\u00e2\u0080\u0094no; rolled, Ross noted, from a flat perforated\nplate on his chest. There was a small, flesh-colored mike slung before\nhis lips. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWho is responsible here?\u00e2\u0080\u009d asked the golden basso.\n\nRoss\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fortyish assailant said humbly: \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am, sir. This new fellow\nhere\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cManners! Speak when you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re spoken to.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAbjectly: \u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, sir. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m sorry, sir.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSilly fools!\u00e2\u0080\u009d the senile wreck hectored them. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m going to take no\nofficial notice of this since I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m merely passing through. Luckily for\nyou this is no formal inspection. But you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve lost your lunch hour with\nyour asinine pranks. Now get back to your work and never let me hear of\na disgraceful incident like this again from Junior Unit Twenty-Three.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe swept out with his retinue. Ross noted that some of the younger girls\nwere crying and that the older men and women were glaring at him\nmurderously.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll teach you manners, you pup,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the foreman-type said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou go on\nthe dye vats this afternoon. Any more trouble and you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll miss a few\nmeals.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nRoss told him: \u00e2\u0080\u009cJust keep your hands off me, mister.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe foreman-type expanded into a beam of pleasure. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI thought you\u00e2\u0080\u0099d be\nsensible,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cEverybody to the plant, now!\u00e2\u0080\u009d He collared a pretty\ngirl of about Ross\u00e2\u0080\u0099s age. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHelena here is working out a bit of insolence\non the dye vats herself. She\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll show you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The girl stood with downcast\neyes. Ross liked her face and wondered about her figure. Whatever it was\nlike, it was covered from neck to knee by a loose shirt. But the older\nwomen wore fitted clothes.\n\nThe foreman-type led a grand procession through the door. Helena told\nRoss: \u00e2\u0080\u009cI guess you\u00e2\u0080\u0099d better get in front of me in line. I go here\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d She\nslipped in deftly, and Ross understood a little more of what went on\nhere. The procession was in order of age.\n\nHe had determined to drift for a day or two\u00e2\u0080\u0094not that he seemed to have\nmuch choice. The Franklin Foundation, supposedly having endured a good\nmany years, would last another week while he explored the baffling mores\nof this place and found out how to circumvent them and find his way to\nthe keepers of F-T-L on this world. Nobody would go anywhere with his\nown ship\u00e2\u0080\u0094not without first running up a setting for the Wesley Drive!\n\nThe line filed into a factory whose like Ross had never before seen. He\nhad a fair knowledge of and eye for industrial processes; it was clear\nthat the place was an electric-cable works. But why was the concrete\nfloor dangerously cracked and sloppily patched? Why was the big\nenameling oven rumbling and stinking? Why were the rolling mills in a\nfar corner unsupplied with guards and big, easy-to-hit emergency\ncutoffs? Why was the light bad and the air full of lint? Why did the\npickling tank fume and make the workers around it cough hackingly? Most\npointed of all, why did the dye vats to which Helena led him stink and\nslop over?\n\nThere were grimy signs everywhere, including the isolated bay where\nbraiding cord was dyed the standard code colors. The signs said things\nlike: AGE IS A PRIVILEGE AND NOT A RIGHT. AGE MUST BE EARNED BY WORK.\nGRATITUDE IS THE INDEX OF YOUR PROGRESS TO MATURITY.\n\nHelena said girlishly as she took his arm and hooked him out of the\nmoving line: \u00e2\u0080\u009cHere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Stinkville. Believe me, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not going to talk back\nagain. After all, one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s maturity is measured by one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s acceptance of\none\u00e2\u0080\u0099s environment, isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t it?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYeah,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Ross. \u00e2\u0080\u009cListen, Helena, have you ever heard of a place\ncalled the Franklin Foundation?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cFirst you climb up here\u00e2\u0080\u0094golly! I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even know your\nname.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cRoss.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAll right, Ross. First you climb up here and make sure the yarn\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nrunning over the rollers right; sometimes it gets twisted around and\nthen it breaks. Then you take one of the thermometers from the wall and\nyou check the vat temperature. It says right on the thermometers what it\nshould be for the different colors. If it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s off you turn that gas tap up\nor down, just a little. Then you check the wringer rolls where the yarn\ncomes out. Watch your fingers when you do! The yarn comes in different\nthicknesses on the same thread so you have to adjust the wringer rolls\nso too much dye doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get squeezed out. You can tell by the color; it\nshouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be lighter after it goes through the rolls. But the yarn\nshouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t come through sloppy and drip dye on the floor while it travels\nto the bobbin\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThere was some more, equally uncomplicated. He took the yellow and green\nvats; she took the red and blue. They had worked in the choking stench\nand heat for perhaps three hours before Ross finished one temperature\ncheck and descended to adjust a gas tap. He found Helena, spent and\ngasping, on the floor, hidden from the rest of the shop by the bulky\ntanks.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHeat knock you out?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he asked briskly. \u00e2\u0080\u009cDon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t try to talk. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll tote\nyou over by the wall away from the burners. Maybe we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll catch a little\nbreeze from the windows there.\u00e2\u0080\u009d She nodded weakly.\n\nHe picked her up without too much trouble, carried her three yards or so\nto the wall, still isolated from the rest of the shop. She was ripely\ncurved under that loose shirt, he learned. He set her down easily,\ncrouching himself, and did not take his hands away.\n\nIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been a long time, he thought\u00e2\u0080\u0094and she was responding! Whether she\nknew it or not, there was a drowsy smile on her face and her body moved\na little against his hands, pleasurably. She was breathing harder.\n\nRoss did the sensible thing and kissed her.\n\nWildcat!\n\nRoss reeled back from her fright and anger, his face copiously\nscratched. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m dreadfully sorry,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he sputtered. \u00e2\u0080\u009cPlease accept my\nsincerest\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe flare-up of rage ended; she was sobbing bitterly, leaning against\nthe wall, wailing that nobody had ever treated her like that before,\nthat she\u00e2\u0080\u0099d be set back three years if he told anybody, that she was a\ngood, self-controlled girl and he had no _right_ to treat her that way,\nand what kind of degenerate was he, not yet twenty and going around\nkissing girls when _everybody_ knew you went crazy from it.\n\nHe soothed her\u00e2\u0080\u0094from a distance. Her sobbing dropped to a bilious croon\nas she climbed the ladder to the yellow vat, tears still on her face,\nand checked its temperature.\n\nRoss, wondering if he were already crazy from too much kissing of girls,\nmechanically resumed his duties. But she had responded. And how long had\nthey been working? And wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t this shift ever going to end?\n\nAll the shifts ended in time. But there was a catch to it: There was\nalways another shift. After the afternoon shift on the dye vats came\ndinner\u00e2\u0080\u0094porridge!\u00e2\u0080\u0094and then came the evening shift on the dye vats, and\nthen sleep. The foreman was lenient, though; he let Ross off the vats\nafter the end of the second day. Then it was kitchen orderly, and only\ntwo shifts a day. And besides, you got plenty to eat.\n\nBut it was a long, long way, Ross thought sardonically to himself, from\nthe shining pictures he had painted to himself back on Halsey\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Planet.\nRoss the explorer, Ross the hero, Ross the savior of humanity....\n\nRoss, the semipermanent KP.\n\nHe had to admit it to himself: The expedition thus far had been a bust.\nNot only was it perfectly clear that there no longer was a Franklin\nFoundation on Gemser, but more had been lost than time and effort. For\nRoss himself, he silently admitted, was as close to lost as he ever\nwanted to be. He was, in effect, a prisoner, in a prison from which\nthere was no easy escape as long as he was cursed with youthfulness....\n\nOf course, the implications of that were that there was a perfectly easy\nescape in time. All he had to do was get old enough to matter, on this\ninsane planet. Ninety, maybe. And then he would be perfectly free to\ntotter out to the spaceport, dragoon a squad of juniors into lifting him\ninto the ship, and take off....\n\nHelena was some help. But only psychologically; she was pleasant\ncompany, but neither she nor anyone else in the roster of forty-eight to\nwhom he was permitted to speak had ever heard of the Franklin\nFoundation, or F-T-L travel, or anything. Helena said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWait for\nHoliday. Maybe one of the grownups will tell you then?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHoliday?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ross slid back and scratched his shoulder blades against the\ncorner of his bed. Helena was sprawled on the floor, half watching a\nprojected picture on the screen at the end of the dormitory.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes. You\u00e2\u0080\u0099re lucky, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s only eight days off. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s when Dobermann\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nshe pointed to the foreman\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009cgraduates; he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the only one this year. And\nwe all move up a step, and the new classes come in, and then we all get\neverything we want. Well, pretty near,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she amended. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t do\nanything _bad_. But you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll see; it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nice.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThen the picture ended, and it was calisthenics time, and then lights\nout. Forty-eight men and women on their forty-eight bunks\u00e2\u0080\u0094the honor\nsystem appeared to work beautifully; there had been no signs of sex play\nthat Ross had been able to see\u00e2\u0080\u0094slept the sleep of the innocent. While\nRoss, the forty-ninth, lay staring into the dark with rising hope.\n\nIn the kitchen the next morning he got more information from Helena.\nHoliday seemed to be a cross between saturnalia and Boy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Week; for one\nday of the year the elders slightly relaxed their grip on the reins. On\nthat day alone one could Speak Before Being Spoken To, Interrupt One\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nElders, even Leave the Room without Being Excused.\n\nWhee, Ross thought sourly. But still....\n\nThe foreman, Dobermann, once you learned how to handle him, wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\nsuch a bad guy. Ross, studying his habits, learned the proper\napproach and used it. Dobermann\u00e2\u0080\u0099s commonest complaint was of\nirresponsibility\u00e2\u0080\u0094irresponsibility when some thirty-year-old junior\nwas caught sneaking into line ahead of his proper place,\nirresponsibility when Ross forgot to make his bed before stumbling\nout in the dark to his kitchen shift, one awful case of\nirresponsibility when Helena thoughtlessly poured cold water into\nthe cooking vat while it was turned on. There was a sizzle, a\ncrackle, and a puff of steam, and Helena was weeping over a broken\nheating element.\n\nDobermann came storming over, and Ross saw his chance. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat is very\nirresponsible of you, Helena,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said coldly, back to Dobermann but\nentirely conscious of his presence. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf Junior Unit Twenty-Three was all\nas irresponsible as you, it would reflect badly on Mr. Dobermann. You\ndon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know how lucky you are that Mr. Dobermann is so kind to you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHelena\u00e2\u0080\u0099s weeping dried up instantly; she gave Ross one furious glance,\nand lowered her eyes before Dobermann. Dobermann nodded approvingly to\nRoss as he waded into Helena; it was a memorable tirade, but Ross heard\nonly part of it. He was looking at the cooking vat; it was a\nsimple-minded bit of construction, a spiral of resistance wire around a\nceramic core. The core had cracked and one end of the wire was loose; if\nit could be reconnected, the cracked core shouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t matter much\u00e2\u0080\u0094the wire\nwas covered with insulation anyhow. He looked up and opened his mouth to\nsay something, then remembered and merely stood looking brightly\nattentive.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009c\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0094looks like you want to go back to the vats,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the foreman was\nfinishing. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, Helena, if that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what you want we can make you happy.\nThis time you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be by yourself, too; you won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have Ross to help you\nout when the going\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rough. Will she, Ross?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, sir,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ross said immediately. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSir?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nDobermann looked back at him, frowning. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI think I can fix this,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ross said modestly.\n\nDobermann\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eyes bulged. \u00e2\u0080\u009cFix it?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, sir. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s only a loose wire. Back where I come from, we all\nlearned how to take care of things like that when we were still in\nschool. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just a matter of\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNow, hold on, Ross\u00e2\u0080\u009d; the foreman howled. \u00e2\u0080\u009cTampering with a machine is\nbad enough, but if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to turn out to be a liar, too, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re\ngoing just too far! School, indeed! You know perfectly well, Ross, that\neven I won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be ready for school until after Holiday. Ross, I knew you\nwere a troublemaker, knew it the first day I set eyes on you. School!\nWell, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll see how you like the school I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m going to send you to!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe vats weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t so bad the second time. Even though the porridge was\ncold for two days, until somebody got around to delivering a different\nthough equally worn-out cooking vat.\n\nHelena passed out from the heat three times. And when, on the third\ntime, Ross, goaded beyond endurance, kissed her again, there were no\nhysterics.\n\n\n\n\n..... 6\n\n\nFROM birth to puberty you were an infant. From puberty to Dobermann\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nage, a junior. For ten years after that you went to school, learning the\nthings you had neither the need nor the right to know before.\n\nAnd then you were Of Age.\n\nBeing Of Age meant much, much more than voting, Ross found out. For one\nthing, it meant freedom to marry\u00e2\u0080\u0094after the enforced sexlessness of the\njunior years and the directed breeding via artificial insemination of\nthe Scholars. It meant a healthy head start on seniority, which carried\nwith it all offices and all power.\n\nIt meant freedom.\n\nAs a bare beginning, it meant the freedom to command any number of\njuniors or scholars. On Ross\u00e2\u0080\u0099s last punitive day in the dye vats, a\nhappy ancient commandeered the entire staff to help set shrubs in his\nfront lawn\u00e2\u0080\u0094a good dozen acres of careful landscaping it was, and the\nprettiest sight Ross had seen on this ugly planet.\n\nWhen they got back to the dye vats, the yellow and blue had boiled over,\nand broken strands of yarn had fouled all the bobbins. Dobermann\nraged\u00e2\u0080\u0094at the juniors.\n\nBut then Dobermann\u00e2\u0080\u0099s raging came to an end forever. It was the night\nbefore Holiday, and there was a pretty ceremony as he packed his kit and\ngot ready to turn Junior Unit Twenty-three over to his successor.\nEveryone was scrubbed, and though a certain amount of license in regard\nto neatness was allowed between dinner and lights out, each bunk was\nmade and carefully smoothed free of wrinkles. After half an hour of\nfidgety waiting, Dobermann called\u00e2\u0080\u0094needlessly\u00e2\u0080\u0094for attention, and the\nminister came in with his ancient retinue.\n\nThe rich mechanical voice boomed out from his breastplate: \u00e2\u0080\u009cJunior\nDobermann, today you are a man!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nDobermann stood with his head bowed, silent and content. Junior Unit\nTwenty-Three chanted antiphonally: \u00e2\u0080\u009cGood-by, Junior Dobermann!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe retinue took three steps forward, and the minister boomed, \u00e2\u0080\u009cBeauty\ncomes with age. Age is beauty!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd the chorus: \u00e2\u0080\u009cOld heads are wisest!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ross, standing as straight as\nany of them, faked the words with his lips and tongue, and wondered how\nmany repetitions had drilled those sentiments into Junior Unit\nTwenty-Three.\n\nThere were five more chants, and five responses, and then the minister\nand his court of four were standing next to Dobermann. Breathing heavily\nfrom his exertions, the minister reached behind him and took a book from\nthe hands of the nearest of his retinue. He said, panting, \u00e2\u0080\u009cScholar\nDobermann, in the Book lies the words of the Fathers. Read them and\nlearn.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe chorus cried thrice, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Word of the Fathers Is Law.\u00e2\u0080\u009d And then the\nminister touched Dobermann\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hand, and in solemn silence, left.\n\nAs soon as the elders had gone, the juniors flocked around Dobermann to\nwish him well. There was excited laughter in the congratulations, and a\ntouch of apprehension too: Dobermann, with all his faults, was a known\nquantity, and the members of Junior Unit Twenty-Three were beginning to\nlook a little fearfully at the short, redheaded youth who, from the next\nday on, would be Dobermann\u00e2\u0080\u0099s successor.\n\nRoss promised himself: He can be good or bad, a blessing or a problem.\nBut he won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be _my_ problem. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m getting out of here tomorrow!\n\nHoliday.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fun,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Helena told him enthusiastically. \u00e2\u0080\u009cFirst you get up\nearly to get the voting out of the way\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cVoting?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSure. Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t they vote where you come from? I thought everybody voted.\nThat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s democracy, like we have it here.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe sardonically quoted one of the omnipresent wall signs: \u00e2\u0080\u009cTHE HAPPINESS\nOF THE MAJORITY MEANS THE HAPPINESS OF THE MINORITY.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He had often\nwondered what, if anything, it meant. But Helena solemnly nodded.\n\nThey were whispering from their adjoining cots by dim, false dawn\nfiltering through the windows on Holiday morning. They were not the only\nwhisperers. Things were relaxing already.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cRoss,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Helena said.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI thought maybe you might not know. On Holiday if you, ah, want to do\nthat again you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have to wait until I faint. Ah, of course you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\ndo it right out in the open.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Overcome by her own daring she buried her\nhead under the coarse blanket.\n\nFine, thought Ross wearily. Once a year\u00e2\u0080\u0094or did Holiday come once a\nyear?\u00e2\u0080\u0094the kids were allowed to play \u00e2\u0080\u009cSpin The Bottle.\u00e2\u0080\u009d No doubt their\nelders thought it was too cute for words: mere tots of thirty and\nthirty-five childishly and innocently experimenting with sex. Of course\nit would be discreetly supervised so that nobody would Get In Trouble.\n\nHe was quite sure Helena\u00e2\u0080\u0099s last two faints had been unconvincing\nphonies.\n\n                  *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe wake-up whistle blew at last. The chattering members of Junior Unit\nTwenty-Three dawdled while they dressed, and the new foreman indulgently\npassed out shabby, smutted ribbons which the girls tied in their hair.\nThey had sugar on their mush for breakfast, and Ross\u00e2\u0080\u0099s stomach came near\nturning as he heard burbles of gratitude at the feast.\n\nWith pushing and a certain amount of inexpert horseplay they formed a\ncolumn of fours and hiked from the hall\u00e2\u0080\u0094from the whole factory complex,\nindeed, along a rubberized highway.\n\nOnce you got out of the factory area things became pleasanter by the\nmile. Hortatory roadside signs thinned out and vanished. Stinking\nmiddens of industrial waste were left behind. And then the landscape was\nrolling, sodded acres with the road pleasantly springy underfoot, the\nair clean and crisp.\n\nThey oohed and aahed at houses glimpsed occasionally in the\ndistance\u00e2\u0080\u0094always rambling, one-story affairs that looked spanking-new.\n\nOnce a car overhauled them on the highway and slowed to a crawl. It was\na huge thing, richly upholstered within. A pair of grimlooking youths\nwere respectively chauffeur and footman; the passenger waved at the\ntroop from Junior Twenty-Three and grinned out of a fantastic landscape\nof wrinkles. Ross gaped. Had he thought the visiting minister was old?\nThis creature, male or female, was _old_.\n\nAfter the car sped on, to the cheers of the marchers, there was happy\ntwittering speculation. Junior Twenty-Three didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t recognize the Citizen\nwho had graciously waved to them, but they thought he\u00e2\u0080\u0094or she?\u00e2\u0080\u0094was\nwonderful. So dignified, so distinguished, so learned, so gracious, so\ndemocratic!\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t it sweet of him?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Helena burbled. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m sure he must be\nsomebody important connected with the voting, otherwise he\u00e2\u0080\u0099d just vote\nfrom home.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nRoss\u00e2\u0080\u0099s feet were beginning to hurt when they reached the suburban\ncenter. To the best of his recollection, they were no more than eight or\nten kilos from the field and his starship. Backtrack on the road to the\nsuburban center about three kilos, take the fork to the right, and that\nwould be that.\n\nJunior Twenty-Three reached a pitch of near-ecstasy marveling at the\nlow, spacious buildings of the center. Through sweeping, transparent\nwindows they saw acres of food and clothing in the shopping center; the\nDrive-In Theater was an architectural miracle. The Civic Center almost\nfinished them off, with its statue of Equal Justice Under the Law (a\ndignified beldame whose chin and nose almost met, leaning on a\ngem-crusted crutch) and Civic Virtue (in a motorized wheelchair equipped\nwith an emergency oxygen tent, Lindbergh-Carrel auxiliary blood pump and\nan artificial kidney).\n\nMerry oldsters were everywhere in their cars and wheelchairs, gaily\nwaving at the kids. Only one untoward incident marred their prevoting\ntour of inspection. A thick-headed young man mistakenly called out a\ncheerful: \u00e2\u0080\u009cLife and wisdom, ma\u00e2\u0080\u0099am!\u00e2\u0080\u009d to a beaming oldster.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMa\u00e2\u0080\u0099am, is it?\u00e2\u0080\u009d the oldster roared through his throat mike and amplifier\nin an unmistakable baritone. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll ma\u00e2\u0080\u0099am you, you wise punk!\u00e2\u0080\u009d He spun\nhis wheelchair on a decishield, threw it into high and roared down on\nthe offender, running him over. The boy covered himself as well as he\ncould while the raging old man backed over him again and ran over him\nagain. His ordeal ended when the oldster collapsed forward in the chair,\nhanging from his safety belt.\n\nThe boy got up with tire marks on him and groaned: \u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, lord! I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve hurt\nhim.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He appealed hysterically: \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll I do? Is he dead?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnother Senior Citizen buzzed up and snapped: \u00e2\u0080\u009cCut in his L-C heart, you\nbooby!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe boy turned on the Lindbergh-Carrel pump, trembling. The white-faced\njuniors of Twenty-Three watched as the tubes to the oldster\u00e2\u0080\u0099s left arm\nthrobbed and pulsed. A massive sigh went up when the old man\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eyes\nopened and he sat up groggily. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat happened?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou died again, Sherrington,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the other elder. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThird time this\nweek\u00e2\u0080\u0094good thing there was a responsible person around. Now get over to\nthe medical center this minute and have a complete checkup. Hear me?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, Dad,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Sherrington said weakly. He rolled off in low gear.\n\nHis father turned to the youngster who stood vacantly rubbing the tire\nmarks on his face. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSince it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Holiday,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he grated, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll let this pass.\nOn any other day I would have seen to it that you were set back fifteen\nyears for your disgraceful negligence.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nRoss knew by then what that meant, and shuddered with the rest. It\namounted to a death sentence, did fifteen additional years of the\ngrinding toil and marginal diet of a junior.\n\nSomewhat dampened they proceeded to the Hall of Democracy, a glittering\nplace replete with slogans, statues, and heroic portraits of the heroic\naged. Twenty-Three huddled together as it joined with a stream of\njuniors from the area\u00e2\u0080\u0099s other factory units. Most of them were larger\nthan the cable works; many of them, apparently, involved more wearing\nand hazardous occupations. Some groups coughed incessantly and were\nred-eyed from the irritation of some chemical. Others must have been\nheavy-manual-labor specialists. They were divided into the hale, whose\nmuscles bulged amazingly, and the dying\u00e2\u0080\u0094men and women who obviously\ncould not take the work but who were doing it anyway.\n\nThey seated themselves at long benches, with push buttons at each\nstation. Helena, next to him, explained the system to Ross. Voting was\nuniversal and simultaneous, in all the Halls of Democracy around the\nplanet and from all the homes of the Senior Citizens who did not choose\nto vote from a Hall. Simultaneously the votes were counted at a central\nstation and the results were flashed to screens in the Centers and\nhomes. She said a number of enthusiastic things about Democracy while\nRoss studied a sheet on which the candidates and propositions were\nlisted.\n\nThe names meant nothing to him. He noted only that each of three\ncandidates for Chief of State was one hundred thirty years old, that\neach of three candidates for First Assistant Chief was one hundred and\ntwenty-seven years old, and so on. Obviously the nominating conventions\nby agreement named candidates of the same age for each office to keep it\na contest.\n\nProposition One read: \u00e2\u0080\u009cTo dismantle seven pediatric centers and apply\nthe salvage value to the construction of, and the funds no longer\nrequired for their maintenance to the maintenance of, a new wing of the\nGerontological Center, said wing to be devoted to basic research in the\nextension of human life.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nProposition Two was worse. Ross didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t bother to read the rest of them.\nHe whispered hoarsely to Helena, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat next?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSsh!\u00e2\u0080\u009d She pointed to a screen at the front of the Hall. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nstarting.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nA Senior Citizen of a very high rank (his face was entirely hidden by an\noxygen mask) was speaking from the screen. There was what seemed to be a\nritual speech of invocation, then he got down to business. \u00e2\u0080\u009cCitizens,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nhe said through his throat mike, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbehold Democracy in Action! I give you\nthree candidates for Chief of State\u00e2\u0080\u0094look them over, and make up your\nminds. First, Citizen Raphael Flexner, age one century, three decades,\nseven months, ten days.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Senior Citizen Flexner rolled on screen, spoke\nbriefly through his throat mike and rolled off. The first speaker said\nagain, \u00e2\u0080\u009cBehold Democracy in Action! See now Citizen Sheridan Farnsworth,\nage one century, three decades, ten months, forty-two days.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Applause\nboomed louder; some of the younger juniors yelled hysterically and\ndrummed their heels on the floor.\n\nHelena was panting with excitement, eyes bright on the screen. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIsn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t it\n_wonderful_?\u00e2\u0080\u009d she gasped ecstatically. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, look at _him_!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHim\u00e2\u0080\u009d was the third candidate, and the first oldster Ross had seen whose\ngocart was a wheeled stretcher. Prone and almost invisible through the\nclusters of tubing and chromed equipment, Senior Citizen Immanuel\nAppleby acknowledged his introduction\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009cAge one century, three decades,\neleven months and five days!\u00e2\u0080\u009d The crowd went mad; Helena broke from\nRoss\u00e2\u0080\u0099s side and joined a long yelling snake dance through the corridors.\n\nRoss yelled experimentally as protective coloration, then found himself\nyelling because everybody was yelling, because he couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t help it. By\nthe time the speaker on the screen began to call for order, Ross was\nstanding on top of the voting bench and screaming his head off.\n\nHelena, weeping with excitement, tugged at his leg. \u00e2\u0080\u009cVote now, Ross,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nshe begged, and all over the hall the cry was \u00e2\u0080\u009cVote! Vote!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nRoss reached out for the voting buttons. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat do we do now?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he asked\nHelena.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cPush the button marked \u00e2\u0080\u0098Appleby,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 of course. Hurry!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut why Appleby?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ross objected. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat fellow Flexner, for instance\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHush, Ross! Somebody might be listening.\u00e2\u0080\u009d There was sickening fright on\nHelena\u00e2\u0080\u0099s face. \u00e2\u0080\u009cDidn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you hear? We _have_ to vote for the best man.\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Oldest Is Bestest,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 you know. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what Democracy _means_, the\nfreedom of choice. They read us the ages, and we choose which is oldest.\nNow please, Ross, hurry before somebody starts asking questions!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe voting was over, and the best man had won in every case. It was a\ntriumph for informed public opinion. The mob poured out of the hall in\nhappy-go-lucky order, all precedences and formalities suspended for\nHoliday.\n\nHelena grasped Ross firmly by the arm. The crowd was spreading over the\nquiet acres surrounding the Center, each little cluster heedlessly\nintent on a long-planned project of its own. Under the pressure of\nHelena\u00e2\u0080\u0099s arm, Ross found himself swerving toward a clump of shrubbery.\n\nHe said violently, \u00e2\u0080\u009cNo! That is, I mean I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m sorry, Helena, but I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got\nsomething to do.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe stared at him with shock in her eyes. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOn Holiday?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOn Holiday. Truly, Helena, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m sorry. Look, what you said last\nnight\u00e2\u0080\u0094from now till tomorrow morning, I can do what I want, right?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nSullenly, \u00e2\u0080\u009cYes. I _thought_, Ross, that I _knew_ what\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOkay.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He jerked his arm away, feeling like all of the hundred possible\nkinds of a skunk. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSee you around,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said over his shoulder. He did\nnot look back.\n\nThree kilos back, he told himself firmly, then the right-hand fork in\nthe road. And not more than a dozen kilos, at the most, to the\nspaceport. He could do it in a couple of hours.\n\nOne thing had been established for certain: If ever there had been a\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cFranklin Foundation\u00e2\u0080\u009d on this planet, it was gone for good now.\nDismantled, no doubt, to provide building materials for an eartrumpet\nplant. No doubt the little F-T-L ship that the Franklin Foundation was\nsupposed to cover for was still swinging in an orbit within easy range\nof the spaceport; but the chance that anybody would ever find it, or use\nit if found, was pretty close to zero. If they bothered to maintain a\nradar watch at all\u00e2\u0080\u0094any other watch than the fully automatic one set to\nrespond only to highvelocity interstellar ships\u00e2\u0080\u0094and if anyone ever took\ntime to look at the radar plot, no doubt the F-T-L ship was charted. As\nan asteroid, satellite, derelict or \u00e2\u0080\u009cbody of unknown origin.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Certainly\nno one of these smug oldsters would take the trouble to investigate.\n\nThe only problem to solve on this planet was how to get off it\u00e2\u0080\u0094fast.\n\nOn the road ahead of him was what appeared to be a combination sex orgy\nand free-for-all. It rolled in a yelling, milling mob of half a hundred\nexcited juniors across the road toward him, then swerved into the fields\nas a cluster of screaming women broke free and ran, and the rest of the\ncrowd roared after them.\n\nRoss quickened his step. If he ever did get off this planet, it would\nhave to be today; he was not fool enough to think that any ordinary day\nwould give him the freedom to poke around the spaceport\u00e2\u0080\u0099s defenses. And\nit would be just his luck, he thought bitterly, to get involved in a\ngang fight on the way to the port.\n\nThere was a squeal of tires behind him, and a little vehicle screeched\nto a halt. Ross threw up a defensive arm in automatic reflex.\n\nBut it was only Helena, awkwardly fumbling open the door of the car.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGet in,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said sourly. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve spoiled _my_ Holiday. Might as well\ndo what _you_ want to do.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n                  *       *       *       *       *\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s that?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHelena looked where he was pointing, and shrugged. \u00e2\u0080\u009cGuard box,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she\nguessed. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHow would I know? Nobody\u00e2\u0080\u0099s in it, anyhow.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nRoss nodded. They had abandoned the car and were standing outside a\nlong, seamless fence that surrounded the spaceport. The main gates were\nclosed and locked; a few hundred feet to the right was a smaller gate\nwith a sort of pillbox, but that had every appearance of being locked\ntoo.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAll right,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Ross. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSee that shed with the boxes outside it? Over\nwe go.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe shed was right up against the fence; the metal boxes gave a sort of\nrough and just barely climbable foothold. Helena was easy enough to lift\nto the top of the shed; Ross, grunting, managed to clamber after her.\n\nThey looked down at the ground on the other side, a dozen feet away.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have to come along,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ross told her.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just _like_ you!\u00e2\u0080\u009d she flared. \u00e2\u0080\u009cCast me aside\u00e2\u0080\u0094trample on me!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAll right, all right.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ross looked around, but neither junior nor elder\nwas anywhere in sight. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHang by your hands and then drop,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he advised\nher. \u00e2\u0080\u009cGet moving before somebody shows up.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOn Holiday?\u00e2\u0080\u009d she asked bitterly. She squirmed over the narrow top of\nthe fence, legs dangling, let herself down as far as she could, and let\ngo. Ross watched anxiously, but she got up quickly enough and moved to\none side.\n\nRoss plopped down next to her, knocking the wind out of himself. He got\nup dizzily.\n\nHis ship, in lonesome quiet, was less than a quarter of a mile away.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLet\u00e2\u0080\u0099s go,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ross panted, and clutched her hand. They skirted another\nshed and were in the clear, running as fast as they could.\n\nAlmost in the clear.\n\nRoss heard the whine of the little scooter before he felt the blow, but\nit was too late. He sprawled on the ground, dragging Helena after him.\n\nA Senior Citizen with a long-handled rod of the sort Ross remembered all\ntoo well was scowling down at them. \u00e2\u0080\u009cChildren,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he rumbled through his\nbreast-speaker in a voice of awful disgust, \u00e2\u0080\u009cis this the way to act on\nHoliday?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHelena, gibbering in terror, was beyond words. Ross croaked, \u00e2\u0080\u009cSorry,\nsir. We\u00e2\u0080\u0094we were just\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nCrash! The rod came down again, and every muscle in Ross\u00e2\u0080\u0099s body\nconvulsed. He rolled helplessly away, the elder following him. Crash!\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe give you Holiday,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the elder boomed, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d crash \u00e2\u0080\u009c\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0094you act like\nanimals. Terrible! Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you know that freedom of play on Holiday\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d\ncrash \u00e2\u0080\u009c\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0094is the most sacred right of every junior\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d crash \u00e2\u0080\u009c\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0094and heaven\nhelp you\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d crash \u00e2\u0080\u009c\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0094if you abuse it!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe wrenching punishment and the caressing voice stopped together. Ross\nlay blinking into the terrible silence that followed. He became\nconscious of Helena\u00e2\u0080\u0099s weeping, and forced his head to turn to look at\nher.\n\nShe was standing behind the elder\u00e2\u0080\u0099s scooter, a length of wire in her\nhand. The senior lay slumped against his safety strap. \u00e2\u0080\u009cRoss!\u00e2\u0080\u009d she\nmoaned. \u00e2\u0080\u009cRoss, what have I done? _I turned him off!_\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe stood up, coughing and retching. No one else was in sight, only the\ntwo of them and the silent, slack form of the old man. He grabbed her\narm. \u00e2\u0080\u009cCome on,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said fuzzily, and started toward the starship.\n\nShe hung back, mumbling to herself, her eyes saucers. She was in a state\nof grievous shock, it was clear.\n\nRoss hesitated, rubbing his back. He knew that she might never pull out\nof it. Even if she did, she was certain to be a frightful handicap. But\nit was crystal-clear that she had declared herself on his side. Even if\nthe elder could be revived, the punishment in store for Helena would be\nawful to contemplate....\n\nCome what may, he was now responsible for Helena.\n\nHe towed her to the starship. She climbed in docilely enough, sat\nstaring blankly as he sealed ship and sent it blasting off the face of\nthe planet.\n\n                  *       *       *       *       *\n\nShe didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t speak until they were well into deep space. Then the blank\nstare abruptly clouded and she exploded in a fit of tears. Ross said\nineffectually, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere, there.\u00e2\u0080\u009d It had no effect; until, in its own time,\nthe storm ended.\n\nHelena said hoarsely, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWh-what do I do now?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy, I guess you come right along with me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ross said heartily, cursing\nhis luck.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s that?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhere? You mean, where?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ross scratched his head. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s see.\nFrankly, Helena, your planet was quite a disappointment to me. I had\nhoped\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0094Well, no matter. I suppose the best thing to do is to look up the\nnext planet on the list.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat list?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nRoss hesitated, then shrugged and plunged into the explanation. All\nabout the longliners and the message and faster-than-light travel and\nthe Wesley Families\u00e2\u0080\u0094and none of it, while he was talking, seemed\nconvincing at all. But perhaps Helena was less critical; or perhaps\nHelena simply did not care. She listened attentively and made no\ncomment. She only said, at the end, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the name of the next\nplanet?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe consulted the master charts. Haarland\u00e2\u0080\u0099s listing showed a place called\nAzor, conveniently near at hand in the strange geodesics of the Wesley\nEffect, where the far galaxies might be near at hand in the warped\nspace-lines, and the void just beyond the viewplates be infinitely\ndistant. The F-T-L family of Azor was named Cavallo; when last heard\nfrom, they had been builders of machine tools.\n\nRoss told Helena about it. She shrugged and watched curiously as he\nbegan to set up the F-T-L problem on the huge board.\n\n\n\n\n..... 7\n\n\nTHEY were well within detection range of Azor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s radar, if any, and yet\nthere had been no beeping signal that the planet\u00e2\u0080\u0099s GCA had taken over\nand would pilot them down. Another blank? He studied the surface of the\nworld under his highest magnification and saw no signs that it had been\ndevastated by war. There were cities\u00e2\u0080\u0094intact, as far as he could tell,\nbut not very attractive. The design ran to huge, gloomy piles that\nmounted toward central towers.\n\nAzor was a big world which showed not much water and a great deal of\nblack rock. It was the fifth of its system and reportedly had colonized\nits four adjacent neighbors and their moons.\n\nHis own search radar pinged. The signal was followed at once by a\nguarded voice from his ship-to-ship communicator: \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat ship are you? Do\nyou receive me? The band is 798.44.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe hastily dialed the frequency on his transmitter and called, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\nreceive you. We are a vessel from outside your solar system, home planet\nHalsey. We want to contact a family named Cavallo of the planet Azor\nbelieved to be engaged in building machine tools. Can you help us?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou are a male?\u00e2\u0080\u009d the voice asked cautiously. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIn command or simply the\ncommunicator?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m a male and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m in command of this vessel.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe voice said: \u00e2\u0080\u009cThen sheer off this system and go elsewhere, my\nfriend.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat is this? Who are you?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy name does not matter. I happen to be on watch aboard the prison\norbital station \u00e2\u0080\u0098Minerva.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Get going, my friend, before the planetary\nGCA picks you up.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nPrison orbital station? A very sensible idea. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThanks for the advice,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nhe parried. \u00e2\u0080\u009cCan you tell me anything about the Cavallo family?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI have heard of them. My friend, your time is running out. If you do\nnot sheer off very soon they will land you. And I judge from the tone of\nyour voice that it will not be long before you join the rest of us\ncriminals aboard \u00e2\u0080\u0098Minerva.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 It is not pleasant here. Good-by.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWait, please!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ross had no intention at all of committing any crimes\nthat would land him aboard a prison hulk, and he had every intention of\nfulfilling his mission. \u00e2\u0080\u009cTell me about the Cavallo family\u00e2\u0080\u0094and why you\nexpect me to get in trouble on Azor.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe time is running out, my friend, but\u00e2\u0080\u0094the Cavallo family of machine\ntool builders is located in Novj Grad. And the crime of which all of us\naboard \u00e2\u0080\u0098Minerva\u00e2\u0080\u0099 were convicted is conspiracy to advocate equality of\nthe sexes. Now go!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe carrier-wave hum of the communicator died, but immediately there was\nanother electronic noise to fill the cabin\u00e2\u0080\u0094the beep of a GCA radar\ntaking over the sealed landing controls of the craft.\n\nHelena had been listening with very little comprehension. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWho was your\nfriend, Ross?\u00e2\u0080\u009d she asked. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhere are we?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI think,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ross said, \u00e2\u0080\u009che _was_ my friend. And I think we are\u00e2\u0080\u0094in\ntrouble.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe ship began to jet tentative bursts of reaction mass, nosing toward\nthe big, gloomy planet.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all right,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Helena said comfortably. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAt least they won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know I\ndisconnected a Senior Citizen.\u00e2\u0080\u009d She thought a moment. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t, will\nthey? I mean, the Senior Citizens here won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know about the Senior\nCitizens there, will they?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe tried to break it to her gently as the ship picked up speed. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHelena,\nit\u00e2\u0080\u0099s possible that the old people here won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be Senior Citizens\u00e2\u0080\u0094not in\nyour planet\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sense. They may just be old people, with no special\nauthority over young people. I think, in fact, that we may find you\noutranking older people who happen to be males.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe took it as a joke. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou are funny, Ross. Old means Senior, doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\nit? And Senior means better, wiser, abler, and in charge, doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t it?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll see,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said thoughtfully as the main reaction drive cut in.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll see very shortly.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n                  *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe spaceport was bustling, busy, and efficient. Ross marveled at the\nspeed and dexterity with which the anonymous ground operator whipped his\nship into a braking orbit and set it down. And he stared enviously at\nthe crawling clamshells on treads, bigger than houses, that cupped\naround his ship; the ship was completely and hermetically surrounded,\nand bathed in a mist of germicides and prophylactic rays.\n\nA helmeted figure riding a little platform on the inside of one of the\nclamshells turned a series of knobs, climbed down, and rapped on the\nship\u00e2\u0080\u0099s entrance port.\n\nRoss opened it diffidently, and almost strangled in the antiseptic\nfumes. Helena choked and wheezed behind him as the figure threw back its\nhelmet and said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the captain?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI am he,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Ross meticulously. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI would like to be put in touch with\nthe Cavallo Machine-Tool Company of Novj Grad.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe figure shook its long hair loose, which provided Ross with the\nnecessary clue: it was a woman. Not a very attractive-looking woman, for\nshe wore no makeup; but by the hair, by the brows and by the smoothness\nof her chin, a woman all the same. She said coldly, \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re the\ncaptain, who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s that?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHelena said in a small voice, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m Helena, from Junior Unit\nTwenty-Three.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIndeed.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Suddenly the woman smiled. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, come ashore, dear,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she\nsaid. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou must be tired from your trip. Both of you come ashore,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she\nadded graciously.\n\nShe led the way out of the clamshells to a waiting closed car. Azor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nsun had an unpleasant bluish cast to it, not a type-G at all; Ross\nthought that the lighting made the woman look uglier than she really had\nto be. Even Helena looked pinched and bloodless, which he knew well was\nnot the case at all.\n\nAll around them was activity. Whatever this planet\u00e2\u0080\u0099s faults, it was not\na stagnant home for graybeards. Ross, craning, saw nothing that was\nshoddy, nothing that would have looked out of place in the best-equipped\nport of Halsey\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Planet. And the reception lounge, or whatever it was,\nthat the woman took them to was a handsome and prettily furnished\nconstruction. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSome lunch?\u00e2\u0080\u009d the woman asked, directing her attention to\nHelena. \u00e2\u0080\u009cA cup of tribrew, maybe? Let me have the boy bring some.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nHelena looked to Ross for signals, and Ross, gritting his teeth, nodded\nto her to agree. Too young the last time, too male this time; was there\never going to be a planet where he mattered to anyone?\n\nHe said desperately, \u00e2\u0080\u009cMadam, forgive my interruption, but this lady and\nmyself need urgently to get in touch with the Cavallo company. Is this\nNovj Grad?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe woman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pale brows arched. She said, with an effort, \u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, it is\nnot.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThen can you tell us where Novj Grad is?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ross persisted. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf they have\na spaceport, we can hop over there in our ship\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe woman gasped something that sounded like, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWell!\u00e2\u0080\u009d She stood up and\nsaid pointedly to Helena, \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll excuse me, I have something to\nattend to.\u00e2\u0080\u009d And swept out.\n\nHelena stared wide-eyed at Ross. \u00e2\u0080\u009cShe must\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been a real Senior\nCitizen, huh?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNot exactly,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Ross despairingly. \u00e2\u0080\u009cLook, Helena, things are\ndifferent here. I need your help.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHelp?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, help!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he bellowed. \u00e2\u0080\u009cGet a grip on yourself, girl. Remember what I\ntold you about the planet I came from? It was different from yours,\nremember? The old people were just like anybody else.\u00e2\u0080\u009d She giggled in\nembarrassment. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey were!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he yelled. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd they are here, too. Old\npeople, young people, doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t matter. On my planet, the richest people\nwere\u00e2\u0080\u0094well, never mind. On this planet, women are the bosses. Get it?\nWomen are like elders. So you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have to take over, Helena.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe was looking at him with a puzzled frown. She objected, \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut if women\nare\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThey are. Never mind about that part of it now; just remember that for\nthe purposes of getting along here, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to be my boss. You tell\nme what to do. You talk to everybody. And what you have to say to them\nis this: You must get to Novj Grad immediately, and talk to a\nhigh-ranking member of the Cavallo Machine-Tool Company. Clear? Once we\nget there, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll take over; everything will be under control then.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He\nadded prayerfully, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI hope.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHelena blinked at him. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m going to be your boss?\u00e2\u0080\u009d she asked.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s right.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLike an elder bosses a junior? And it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s legal?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nRoss started to repeat, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s right,\u00e2\u0080\u009d impatiently again. But there was\na peculiar look in Helena\u00e2\u0080\u0099s round eyes. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHelena!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said warningly.\n\nShe was all concern. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy, what is it, Ross?\u00e2\u0080\u009d she asked solicitously.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou look upset. Just leave everything to me, dear.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n                  *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey got started on the way to Novj Grad\u00e2\u0080\u0094not in their ship (the woman\nhad said there was no spaceport in Novj Grad), and not alone, so that\nRoss could not confirm his unhappy opinion of Helena\u00e2\u0080\u0099s inner thoughts.\nBut at least they were on their way to Novj Grad in the Azorian\nequivalent of a chartered aircraft, with Helena chatting happily with\nthe female pilot, and Ross sitting uncomfortably on a narrow,\nupholstered strip behind.\n\nEverything he saw in Azor confirmed his first impressions. The planet\nwas busy and prosperous. Nobody seemed to be doing anything very\nproductive, he thought, but somehow everything seemed to get done.\nAutomatic machinery, he guessed; if women were to have any chance of\ngaining the upper hand on a planet, most of the hard physical work would\nhave to be fairly well mechanized anyhow. And particularly on this\nplanet. They had been flying for six hours, at a speed he guessed to be\nnot much below that of sound, and fully half of the territory they\npassed over was bare, black rock.\n\nThe ship began losing altitude, and the pilot, who had been curled up in\na relaxed position, totally ignoring the aircraft, glanced at her\ninstrument panel. \u00e2\u0080\u009cComing in for a landing,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she warned. \u00e2\u0080\u009cDon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t distract\nme right now, dear, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got a thousand things to do.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t seem to be doing any of them, Ross thought disapprovingly;\nall she did was watch varicolored lights blink on and off. But no doubt\nthe ship landing, too, was as automatic as the piloting.\n\nHelena turned and leaned back to Ross. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re coming in for a landing,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nshe relayed.\n\nRoss said sourly, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI heard.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHelena gave him a look of reprimand and forgiveness. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m hungry,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she\nmused.\n\nThe pilot turned from her controls. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou can get something at the\nairport,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she offered eagerly. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll show you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHelena looked at Ross. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWould you like something?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBut the pilot frowned. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t believe there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s any place for men,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she\nsaid disapprovingly. \u00e2\u0080\u009cPerhaps we can get something sent out for him if\nyou like. Although, really, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s probably against the rules, you know.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nRoss started to say with great dignity, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThank you, but that won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be\nnecessary.\u00e2\u0080\u009d But he didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t quite get it out. The ship came in for its\nlanding. There was an enormous jolt and a squawk of alarm bells and\nflashing lights. The ship careened crazily, and stopped.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, darn,\u00e2\u0080\u009d complained the pilot mildly. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s always doing that. Come\non, dear, let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s get something to eat. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll come back for _him_ later.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd Ross was left alone to stare apprehensively at the unceasingly\nflashing lights and to listen to the strident alarms for three-quarters\nof an hour.\n\nHis luck was in, though. The ship didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t explode. And eventually a\npallid young man in a greasy apron appeared with a tray of sandwiches\nand a vacuum jug.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cUp here, boy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ross called.\n\nHe gaped through the port. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou mean come in?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSure. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all right.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe young man put down the tray. Something in the way he looked at it\nprompted Ross to invite him: \u00e2\u0080\u009cHave some with me? More here than I can\nhandle.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThanks; I believe I will. I, uh, was supposed to take my break after I\nbrought you this stuff.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He poured steaming brew into the cup that\ncovered the jug, politely pushed it to Ross and swigged from the jug\nhimself. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou\u00e2\u0080\u0099re with the starship?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he asked, around a mouthful of\nsandwich.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes. I\u00e2\u0080\u0094the captain, that is\u00e2\u0080\u0094wants to contact an outfit called Cavallo\nMachine-Tool. You know where they are?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSure. Biggest firm on the south side. Fifteen Street; you can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t miss\nthem. The captain\u00e2\u0080\u0094is she the lady who was with Pilot Breuer?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe youngster\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eyes widened. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou mean you were in space\u00e2\u0080\u0094alone\u00e2\u0080\u0094with a\nlady?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nRoss nodded and chewed.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd she didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\u00e2\u0080\u0094uh\u00e2\u0080\u0094there wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\u00e2\u0080\u0094well\u00e2\u0080\u0094any problem?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Ross. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou have much trouble with that kind of thing?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe boy winced. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve asked once I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve asked a hundred times for a\ntransfer. Oh, those jet pilots! I used to work in a roadside truck stop.\nI know truckers are supposed to be rough and tough; maybe they are. But\nyou can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t tell me that deep down a trucker isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t a lady. When you tell\nthem no, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s that. But a pilot\u00e2\u0080\u0094it just eggs them on. Azor City today,\nNovj Grad tomorrow\u00e2\u0080\u0094what do they care?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nRoss was fascinated and baffled. It seemed to him that they should care\nand care plenty. Back where he came from, it was the woman who paid and\nhe couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t imagine any cultural setup which could alter that biological\nfact. He asked cautiously: \u00e2\u0080\u009cHave you ever been\u00e2\u0080\u0094in trouble?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe boy stiffened and looked disapproving. Then he said with a sigh: \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\nmight as well tell you. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all over the station anyway; they call me\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Bernie the Pullover.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Yes. Twice. Pilots both times. I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t seem to\nsay no\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d He took another long pull from the jug and a savage bite from\na second sandwich.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m sure,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ross said numbly, \u00e2\u0080\u009cit wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t your fault.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTry telling that to the judge,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Bernie the Pullover said bitterly. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe\npilot speaks her piece, the medic puts the blood group tests in\nevidence, the doctor and cr\u00c3\u00a8che director depose that the child was born\nand is still living. Then the judge says, without even looking up,\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Paternity judgment to the plaintiff, defendant ordered to pay one\nthousand credits annual support, let this be a warning to you, young\nman, next case.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 I shouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have joined you and eaten your sandwiches,\nbut the fact is I was hungry. I had to sell my meal voucher yesterday to\nmeet my payment. Miss three payments and\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d He jerked his thumb\nheavenward.\n\nRoss thought and realized that the thumb must indicate the orbiting\nprison hulk \u00e2\u0080\u009cMinerva.\u00e2\u0080\u009d It _was_ the man who paid here.\n\nHe demanded: \u00e2\u0080\u009cHow did all this happen?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBernie, having admitted his hunger, had stopped stalling and seized a\nthird sandwich. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAll what?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he asked indistinctly.\n\nRoss thought hard and long. He realized first that he could probably\nnever explain what he meant to Bernie, and second that if he did they\u00e2\u0080\u0099d\nprobably both wind up aboard \u00e2\u0080\u009cMinerva\u00e2\u0080\u009d for conspiracy to advocate\nequality. He shifted his ground. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOf course everybody agrees on the\nnatural superiority of women,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut people seem to differ from\nplanet to planet as to the reasons. What do they say here on Azor?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh\u00e2\u0080\u0094nothing special or fancy. Just the common-sense, logical thing.\nThey\u00e2\u0080\u0099re smaller, for one thing, and haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t got the muscles of men, so\nthey\u00e2\u0080\u0099re natural supervisors. They accumulate money as a matter of course\nbecause men die younger and women are the beneficiaries. Then, women\nhave a natural aptitude for all the interesting jobs. I saw a broadcast\nabout that just the other night. The biggest specialist on the planet in\nvocational aptitude. I forget her name, but she proved it conclusively.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe looked at the empty platter before them. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got to go now. Thanks\nfor everything.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe pleasure was mine.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ross watched his undernourished figure head for\nthe station. He swore a little, and then buckled down to some hard\nthinking. Helena was his key to this world. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099d have to have a long\nskull-session or two with her; he couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be constantly prompting her\nor there would be serious trouble. She would be the front and he would\nbe the very inconspicuous brains of the outfit, trailing humbly behind.\nBut was she capable of absorbing a brand-new, rather complicated\nconcept? She seemed to be, he told himself uncomfortably, in love with\nhim. That would help considerably....\n\nHelena and Pilot Breuer showed up, walking with a languor that suggested\na large and pleasant meal disposed of. Helena\u00e2\u0080\u0099s first words disposed\nwith shocking speed of Ross\u00e2\u0080\u0099s doubts that she was able to acquire a\nbrand-new sociological concept. They were: \u00e2\u0080\u009cAh, there you are, my dear.\nDid the boy bring you something or other to eat?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes. Thanks. Very thoughtful of you,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said pointedly, with one eye\non Breuer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s reaction. There was none; he seemed to have struck the right\nnote.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cPilot Breuer,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Helena blandly, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthinks I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d enjoy an evening doing\nthe town with her and a few friends.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut the Cavallo people\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cRoss,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said gently, \u00e2\u0080\u009cdon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t _nag_.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe shut up. And thought: wait until I get her out into space. _If_ I get\nher out into space. She\u00e2\u0080\u0099d be a damned fool to leave this wacked-up\nculture....\n\nBreuer was saying, with an altogether too-innocent air, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099d better get\nyou two settled in a hotel for the night; then I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll pick up Helena and a\nfew friends and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll show her what old Novj Grad has to offer in the\nway of night life. Can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have her batting around the universe saying\nAzor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sidewalks are rolled up at 2100, can we? And then she can do her\ntrading or whatever it is with Cavallo bright and early tomorrow, eh?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nRoss realized that he was being jollied out of an attack of the sulks.\nHe didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t like it.\n\n                  *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe hotel was small and comfortable, with a bar crowded by roistering\npilots and their dates. The glimpses Ross got of social life on Azor\nadded up to a damnably unfair picture. It was the man who paid. Breuer\nroguishly tested the mattress in their room, nudging Helena, and then\nannounced, \u00e2\u0080\u009cGet settled, kids, while I visit the bar.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWhen the door rolled shut behind her Ross said furiously: \u00e2\u0080\u009cLook, you!\nProtective mimicry\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fine up to a point, but let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not forget what this\nmission is all about. We seem to be suckered into spending the night,\nbut by hell tomorrow morning bright and early we find those Cavallo\npeople\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Helena said soothingly. \u00e2\u0080\u009cDon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be angry, Ross. I promise I\nwon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be out late, and she really did insist.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI suppose so,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he grumbled. \u00e2\u0080\u009cJust remember it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no pleasure trip.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNot for you, perhaps,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she smiled sweetly.\n\nHe let it drop there, afraid to push the matter.\n\nBreuer returned in about ten minutes with a slight glow on. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all\nfixed,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she told Helena. \u00e2\u0080\u009cGot a swell crowd lined up. Table at Virgin\nWillie\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\u00e2\u0080\u0094oops!\u00e2\u0080\u009d She glanced at Ross. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNo harm in it, of course,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she\nsaid. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnything you want, Ross, just dial service. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s on my account. I\nfixed it with the desk.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThanks.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThey left, and Ross went grumpily to bed.\n\n                  *       *       *       *       *\n\nA secretive rustle in the room awoke him. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHelena?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he asked drowsily.\n\nPilot Breuer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s voice giggled drunkenly, \u00e2\u0080\u009cNope. Helena\u00e2\u0080\u0099s passed out at\nVirgin Willie\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, kind of the way I figured she would be on triple\nantigravs. Had my eye on you since Azor City, baby. You gonna be nice to\nme?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGet out of here!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ross hissed furiously. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOut of here or I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll yell like\nhell.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSo yell,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she giggled. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI got the house dick fixed. They know me here,\nbaby\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe fumbled for the bedside light and snapped it on. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll pitch you\nright through the door,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he announced. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd if you give me any more lip\nI won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t bother to open it before I do.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe hiccupped and said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cA spirited lad. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the way I like \u00e2\u0080\u0099em.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nWith one hand she drew a nasty-looking little pistol. With the other she\npulled a long zipper and stepped out of her pilot\u00e2\u0080\u0099s coveralls.\n\nRoss gulped. There were three ways to play this, the smart way, the\nstupid way, and the way that all of a sudden began to look attractive.\nHe tried the stupid way.\n\nHe got the pistol barrel alongside his ear for his pains. \u00e2\u0080\u009cDon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t jump\nme,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Pilot Breuer giggled. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe boys that\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve tried to take this gun away\nfrom me are stretched end to end from here to Azor City. By me, baby.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nRoss blinked through a red-spotted haze. He took a deep breath and got\nsmart. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou\u00e2\u0080\u0099re pretty tough,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said admiringly.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, sure.\u00e2\u0080\u009d She kicked the coveralls across the room and moved in on\nhim. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBaby,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said caressingly, \u00e2\u0080\u009cif I seem to sort of forget myself\nin the next couple of minutes, don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get any ideas. I _never_ let go of\nmy gun. Move over.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSure,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ross said hollowly. This, he told himself disgustedly, was the\ndamnedest, silliest, ridiculousest....\n\nThere was a furious hiccup from the door. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSo!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Helena said venomously,\npushing the door wide and almost falling to the floor. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSo!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nRoss flailed out of the bed, kicking the pistol out of Pilot Breuer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nhand in the process. He cried enthusiastically, \u00e2\u0080\u009cHelena, dear!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you \u00e2\u0080\u0098Helena-dear\u00e2\u0080\u0099 me!\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, moving in and kicking the door\nshut behind her. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI leave you alone for one little minute, and what\nhappens? And _you_!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSorry,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Pilot Breuer muttered, climbing into her coveralls. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWrong\nroom. Must\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve had one anti-grav too many.\u00e2\u0080\u009d She licked her lips\napprehensively, zipping her coveralls and sidling toward the door. With\none hand on the knob, she said diffidently, \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf I could have my gun\nback\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0094? No, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re right! I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll get it tomorrow.\u00e2\u0080\u009d She got through the\ndoor just ahead of a lamp.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHussy!\u00e2\u0080\u009d spat Helena. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd you, Ross\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nIt was the last straw. As Ross lurched toward her he regretted only one\nthing: that he didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have a hairbrush.\n\nPilot Breuer had been right. Nobody paid any attention to the noise.\n\n                  *       *       *       *       *\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, Ross.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Helena had hardly touched her breakfast; she sat with her\neyes downcast.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009c\u00e2\u0080\u0098Yes, Ross\u00e2\u0080\u0099,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he mimicked bitterly. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt better be \u00e2\u0080\u0098Yes, Ross.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 This\nplace may look all right to you, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s trouble. You don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to\nfind yourself stuck here all your life, do you? Then do what I tell\nyou.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, Ross.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe pushed the remains of his food away. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, the hell with it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said\ndispiritedly. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI wish I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d never started out on this fool\u00e2\u0080\u0099s errand. And I\ndouble damn well wish I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d left you in the dye vats.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, Ro\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0094I mean, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m glad you didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t, Ross,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said in a small voice.\n\nHe stood up and patted her shoulder absently. \u00e2\u0080\u009cCome on,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwe\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve\ngot to get over to the Cavallo place. I wish you had let me talk to them\non the phone.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe said reasonably, \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut you said\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI know what I said. When we get there, remember that I do the talking.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThey walked through green-lit streets, filled with proud-looking women\nand sad-eyed men. The Cavallo Machine-Tool Corporation was only a few\nintersections away, by the map the desk clerk had drawn for Helena; they\nfound it without trouble. It was a smallish sort of building for a\nfactory, Ross thought, but perhaps that was how factories went on Azor.\nBesides, it was well constructed and beautifully landscaped with the\npurplish lawns these people seemed to prefer.\n\nHelena led him through the door, as was right and proper. She said to\nthe busy little bald-headed man who seemed to be the receptionist,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re expected. Miss Cavallo, please.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCertainly, Ma\u00e2\u0080\u0099am,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said with a gap-toothed smile, and worked a\ncombination of rods and buttons on the desk beside him. In a moment, he\nsaid, \u00e2\u0080\u009cGo right in. Three up and four over; can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t miss it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThey passed through a noisy territory of machines where metal was\nsliced, spun, hacked, and planed; no one seemed to be paying any\nattention to them. Ross wondered who had built the machines, and had a\nsudden flash of realization as to where those builders were now: On\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMinerva,\u00e2\u0080\u009d staring at the unattainable free sky.\n\nMiss Cavallo was a motherly type with a large black cigar. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSit right\ndown,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said heartily. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou, too, young man. Tell me what we in\nCavallo Company can do for you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHelena opened her mouth, but Ross stopped her with a gesture. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nenough,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said quietly. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll take over. Miss Cavallo,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he declaimed\nfrom memory, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhat follows is under the seal.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIs it indeed! What do you know,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said.\n\nRoss said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWesley.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMiss Cavallo slapped her thigh admiringly. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSon of a gun,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said\nadmiringly. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHow this takes me back\u00e2\u0080\u0094those long-ago childhood days,\nlearning these things at my mother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s knee. Let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s see. Uh\u00e2\u0080\u0094the limiting\nvelocity is C.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut C^2 is not a velocity,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ross finished triumphantly. And, from the\nheart, \u00e2\u0080\u009cMiss Cavallo, you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t begin to know how happy this makes me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMiss Cavallo reached over and pumped his hand, then Helena\u00e2\u0080\u0099s. To the\ngirl she said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got a right to be a proud woman, believe me. The\nway he got through it, without a single stumble! Never saw anything like\nit in my life. Well, just tell me what I can do for you, now that that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nover.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nRoss took a deep, deep breath. He said earnestly, \u00e2\u0080\u009cA great deal. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\nknow where to begin. You see, it all goes back to Halsey\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Planet, where\nI come from. This, uh, this ship came in, a longliner, and it got some\nof us a little worried because, well, it seemed that some of the planets\nwere no longer in communication. We\u00e2\u0080\u0094uh, Miss Cavallo?\u00e2\u0080\u009d She was smiling\npleasantly enough, but Ross had the crazy feeling that he just wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\ngetting through to her.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGo right ahead,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she boomed. \u00e2\u0080\u009cGod knows, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got nothing against men\nin business; that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s old-fashioned prejudice. Take your time. I won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\nbite you. Get on with your proposition, young man.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t exactly a proposition,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ross said weakly. All of a sudden the\nwords seemed hard to find. What did you say to a potential partner in\nthe salvation of the human race when she just nodded and blew cigar\nsmoke at you?\n\nHe made an effort. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHalsey\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Planet was the seventh alternate\ndestination for this ship, and so we figured\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0094That is, Miss Cavallo, it\nkind of looked like there was some sort of trouble. So Mr. Haarland\u00e2\u0080\u0094he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nthe one who has the F-T-L secret on Halsey, like you do here on Azor\u00e2\u0080\u0094he\npassed it on to me, of course\u00e2\u0080\u0094well, he asked me to, well, sort of take a\nlook around.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He stopped. The words by then were just barely audible\nanyhow; and Miss Cavallo had been looking furtively at her watch.\n\nMiss Cavallo shrugged sympathetically to Helena. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey\u00e2\u0080\u0099re all like that\nunder the skin, aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t they?\u00e2\u0080\u009d she observed ambiguously. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, if men\ncould take our jobs away from us, what would we do? Stay home and mind\nthe kids?\u00e2\u0080\u009d She roared and poked a box of cigars at Helena.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNow,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said briskly, \u00e2\u0080\u009clet\u00e2\u0080\u0099s get down to cases. I really enjoyed\nhearing those lines from you, young man, and I want you to know that I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m\nprepared to help you in any possible way because of them. Open a line of\ncredit, speed up deliveries, send along some of our technical people to\nhelp you get set up\u00e2\u0080\u0094anything. Now, what can I do for you? Turret lathes?\nGrinders? Screw machines?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMiss Cavallo,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ross said desperately, \u00e2\u0080\u009cdon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you know anything about\nthe faster-than-light secret?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe said impatiently, \u00e2\u0080\u009cOf course I do, young man. Said the responses,\ndidn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t I? There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no call for that item, though.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to _buy_ one,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ross cried. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI have one. Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you realize\nthat the human race is in danger? Populations are dying out or going out\nof communication all over the galaxy. Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you want to do something\nabout it before we all go under?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMiss Cavallo dropped all traces of a smile. Her face was like flint as\nshe stood up and pointed to the window. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYoung man,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said icily,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009ctake a look out there. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the Cavallo Machine-Tool Company. Does\nthat look as if we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going under?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI know, but Clyde, Cyrnus One, Ragansworld\u00e2\u0080\u0094at least a dozen planets I\ncan name\u00e2\u0080\u0094are _gone_. Didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you ever think that you might be next?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMiss Cavallo kept her voice level, but only with a visible effort.\n\nShe said flatly, \u00e2\u0080\u009cNo. Never. Young man, I have plenty to do right here\non Azor without bothering my head about those places you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re talking\nabout. Seventy-five years ago there was another fellow just like you;\nFlarney, some name like that; my grandmother told me about him. He came\nbustling in here causing trouble, with that old silly jingle about\nWesley and C-square and so on, with some cock-and-bull story about a\nplanet that was starving to death, stirring up a lot of commotion. Well,\nhe wound up on \u00e2\u0080\u0098Minerva,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 because he wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t take no for an answer.\nWatch out that you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t do the same.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe marched majestically to the door. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd now,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cif you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve\nwasted quite enough of my time, kindly leave.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\n\n..... 8\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSTUPID old bat,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ross muttered. They were walking aimlessly down\nFifteen Street, the nicely-landscaped machine tool works behind them.\n\nHelena said timidly: \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou really shouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t talk that way, Ross. She _is_\nolder than you, after all. Old heads are\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009c\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0094wisest,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he wearily agreed. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAlso the most conservative. Also the\nmost rigidly inflexible; also the most firmly closed to the reception of\nnew ideas. With one exception.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe reeled under the triple blasphemy and then faintly asked: \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nthe exception?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nRoss became aware that they were not alone. Their very manner of\nwalking, he a little ahead, obviously leading the way, was drawing\nunfavorable attention from passers-by. Nothing organized or even\ndefinite\u00e2\u0080\u0094just looks ranging from puzzled distaste to anger. He said,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSomebody named Haarland. Never mind,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and in a lower voice: \u00e2\u0080\u009cStraighten\nup. Step out a little ahead of me. Scowl.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe managed it all except the scowl. The expression on her face got some\nstupefied looks from other pedestrians, but nothing worse.\n\nHelena said loudly and plaintively: \u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t like it here after all,\nRoss. Can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t we get away from all these women?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShould the impulse seize you, placard ancient Brooklyn with twenty-four\nsheets proclaiming the Dodgers to be cellar-dwelling bums. Mount a\ndetergent box and inform a crowd of Altairians that they are degenerate\nslith-fondlers if you must. Announce in a crowded Cephean bar room that\nSadkia Revall is no better than she should be. From these situations you\nhave some chance of emerging intact. But never, never pronounce the word\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cwomen\u00e2\u0080\u009d as Helena pronounced it on Fifteen Street, Novj Grad, Azor.\n\nThe mob took only seconds to form.\n\nRoss and Helena found themselves with their backs to the glass doors of\na food store. The handful of women who had actually heard the remark\nwere all talking to them simultaneously, with fist-shaking. Behind them\nstood as many as a dozen women who knew only that something had happened\nand that there were comfortably outnumbered victims available. The noise\nwas deafening, and Helena began to cry. Ross first wondered if he could\nbring himself to knock down a woman; then realized after studying the\nhulking virago in their foreground that he might bring himself to try\nbut probably would not succeed.\n\nShe seemed to be accusing Helena of masquerading, of advocating\nequality, of uttering obscenely antisocial statements in the public\nroad, to the affront of all decent-minded girls.\n\nThere was violence in the air. Ross was on the point of blocking a\nroundhouse right when the glass doors opened behind them. The small\ndiversion distracted the imbecile collective brain of the mob.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going on here?\u00e2\u0080\u009d a suety voice demanded. \u00e2\u0080\u009cLadies, may I please\nget through?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nIt was a man trying to emerge from the food shop with a double armful of\ncartons. He was a great fat slob, quite hairless, and smelling\npowerfully of kitchen. He wore the gravy-spotted whites of any cook\nanywhere.\n\nThe virago said to him, \u00e2\u0080\u009cKeep out of this, Willie. This fellow here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a\nmasquerader. The thing I heard him say\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0094!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Helena wept. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe cook stooped to look into her face and turned on the mob. \u00e2\u0080\u009cShe\nisn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said definitely. \u00e2\u0080\u009cShe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a lady from another system. She was\nslopping up triple antigravs at my place last night with a gang of jet\npilots.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t prove a thing!\u00e2\u0080\u009d the virago yelled.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMadam,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the cook said wearily, \u00e2\u0080\u009cafter her third antigrav I had to trip\nher up and crown her. She was about to climb the bar and corner my\nbarman.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nRoss looked at her fixedly. She stopped crying and nervously cleared her\nthroat.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSo if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll just let us through,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the cook bustled, seizing the\npsychological moment of doubt. His enormous belly bulldozed a lane for\nthem. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBeg pardon. Excuse us. Madam, will you\u00e2\u0080\u0094thank you. Beg pardon\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe lynchers were beginning to drift away, embarrassed. The party had\ncollapsed. \u00e2\u0080\u009cFaster,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the cook hissed at them. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBeg pardon\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d And they\nwere in the clear and well down the street.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThank you, Sir,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Helena said humbly.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cJust \u00e2\u0080\u0098Willie\u00e2\u0080\u0099, _if_ you please,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the fat man said.\n\nOne hand descended on Ross\u00e2\u0080\u0099s shoulder and another on Helena\u00e2\u0080\u0099s. They both\nbelonged to the virago. She spun them around, glaring. \u00e2\u0080\u009c_I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m_ not\nsatisfied with the brush-off,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she snapped. \u00e2\u0080\u009cExactly what did you mean\nby that remark you made?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHelena wailed, \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just that you and all these other women here seem\nso _young_.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe virago\u00e2\u0080\u0099s granite face softened. She let go and tucked in a strand of\nsteel-wool hair. \u00e2\u0080\u009cDid you really think so, dear?\u00e2\u0080\u009d she asked, beaming.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m sorry I got excited. A wee bit jealous, were you? Well,\nwe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re broad-minded here in Novj Grad.\u00e2\u0080\u009d She patted Helena\u00e2\u0080\u0099s arm and\nwalked off, smiling and jaunty.\n\nVirgin Willie led off and they followed him. Ross\u00e2\u0080\u0099s knees were shaky.\nThe virago had not known that to Helena \u00e2\u0080\u009cyoung\u00e2\u0080\u009d meant \u00e2\u0080\u009cstupid.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe cook absently acknowledged smiles and nods as they walked. He was,\nobviously, a character. Between salutes he delivered a low-voiced,\nrapid-fire reaming to Ross and Helena. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSilly stunt. Didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you hear\nabout the riots? Supposed to be arms caches somewhere here on the south\nside. Everybody\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nerves absolutely ragged. Somebody gets smashed up in\ntraffic, they blame it on us. Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t care _where_ you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re from. Watch it\nnext time.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe will, Willie,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Helena said contritely. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd I think you run an\nawfully nice restaurant.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYeah,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Ross, looking at her.\n\nWillie muttered, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI guess you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re clear. You still staying at that hot\npilot\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hangout? This is where we say good-by, then. You turn left.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe waddled on down the street. Helena said instantly, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t remember\na thing, Ross.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOkay,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t remember a thing.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe looked relieved and said brightly, \u00e2\u0080\u009cSo let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s get back to the hotel.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOkay,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. Climbed the bar and tried to corner the.... Halfway to\nthe hotel he slowed, then stopped, and said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI just thought of\nsomething. Maybe we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not staying there any more. After last night why\nshould Breuer carry us on her tab? I thought we\u00e2\u0080\u0099d have some money to\ncarry us from the Cavallos by now\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe ship?\u00e2\u0080\u009d she asked in a small voice.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAcross the continent. Hell! Maybe Breuer forgave and forgot. Let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s try,\nanyway.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThey never got as far as the hotel. When they reached the square it\nstood on, there was a breathless rush and Bernie stood before them,\npanting and holding a hand over his chest. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIn here,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he gasped, and\nnodded at a shopfront that announced hot brew. Ross thoughtlessly\nstarted first through the door and caught Bernie\u00e2\u0080\u0099s look of alarm. He\nopened the door for Helena, who went through smiling nervously.\n\nThey settled at a small table in an empty corner in stiff silence. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve\nbeen walking around that square all morning,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Bernie said, with a cowed\nlook at Helena.\n\nRoss told her: \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis young man and I had a talk yesterday at the plane\nwhile you were eating. What is it, Bernie?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe still couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t believe that he was doing it, but Bernie said in a\nscared whisper: \u00e2\u0080\u009cWanted to head you off and warn you. Breuer was down at\nthe field cafe this morning, talking loud to the other hot-shots. She\nsaid you\u00e2\u0080\u0094both of you\u00e2\u0080\u0094talked equality. Said she got up with a hangover\nand you were gone. But she said there\u00e2\u0080\u0099d be six policewomen waiting in\nyour room when you got back.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He leaned forward on the table. Ross\nremembered that he had been forced to sell his ration card.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHere comes the waiter,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said softly. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOrder something for all of us.\nWe have a little money. And thanks, Bernie.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHelena asked, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat do we _do_?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe eat,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ross said practically. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThen we think. Shut up; let Bernie\norder.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n                  *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey ate; and then they thought. Nothing much seemed to come from all\nthe thinking, though.\n\nThey were a long, long way from the spaceship. Ross commandeered all of\nHelena\u00e2\u0080\u0099s leftover cash. It was almost, not quite, enough for one person\nto get halfway back to Azor City. He and Bernie turned out their pockets\nand added everything they had, including pawnable valuables. That\nhelped. It made the total almost enough for one person to get\nthree-quarters of the way back.\n\nIt didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t help enough.\n\nRoss said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cBernie, what would happen if we, well, stole something?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBernie shrugged. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s against the law, of course. They probably\nwouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t prosecute, though.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThey wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNot if they can prove egalitarianism on you. Stealing\u00e2\u0080\u0099s against the\nlaw; preaching equality is against the _state_. You get the maximum\npenalty for that.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHelena choked on her drink, but Ross merely nodded. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSo we might as well\ntake a chance,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThanks, Bernie. We won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t bother you any more.\nYou\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll forget you heard this, won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe hell I will!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Bernie squawked. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re getting out of here, I\nwant to go with you! You aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t leaving _me_ behind!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut Bernie\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ross started. He was interrupted by the manager, a\nbattleship-class female with a mighty prow, who came scowling toward\nthem.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cPipe down,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she ordered coarsely. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis place is for decent people; we\ndon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want no disturbances here. If you can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t act decent, get out.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAwk,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Helena as Ross kicked her under the table. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI mean, yes\nma\u00e2\u0080\u0099am. Sorry if we were talking too loud.\u00e2\u0080\u009d They watched the manager walk\naway in silence.\n\nAs soon as she was fairly away, Ross hissed, \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s out of the question,\nBernie. You might be jumping from the frying-pan into the fire.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBernie asked, startled, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe what?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe\u00e2\u0080\u0094never mind, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just an expression where I come from. It means you\nmight get out of this place and find yourself somewhere worse. We don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\nknow where we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going next; you might wish to God you were back here\nwithin the next three days.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll take that chance,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Bernie said earnestly. \u00e2\u0080\u009cLook, Ross, I played\nsquare with you. I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have to stick my neck out and warn you. How\nabout giving me a break too?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHelena interrupted, \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s right, Ross. After all, we owe him that much,\ndon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t we? I mean, if a person does that much for a person, a person\nought to\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, shut up.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ross glared at both of them. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou two seem to think this\nis a game,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said bitterly. \u00e2\u0080\u009cLet me set you straight, both of you. It\nisn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t. More hangs on what happens to me than either of you realize. The\nfate of the human race, for instance.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHelena flashed a look at Bernie. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOf _course_, Ross,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said\nsoothingly. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBoth of us know that, don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t we, Bernie?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBernie stammered, \u00e2\u0080\u009cSure\u00e2\u0080\u0094sure we do, Ross.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He rubbed his ankle. He went\non, \u00e2\u0080\u009cHonest, Ross, I want to get the hell away from Azor once and for\nall. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t care _where_ you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going. Anything would be better than\nthis place and the damned female bloodsuckers that\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe stopped, petrified. His eyes, looking over Ross\u00e2\u0080\u0099s shoulder, were\nenormous.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGo on, sonny,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said a rich female voice from behind Ross. \u00e2\u0080\u009cDon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t let me\nand the lieutenant stop you just when you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going good.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n                  *       *       *       *       *\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt must have been that damn manager,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Bernie said for the fifteenth\ntime.\n\nRoss uncrossed his legs painfully and tried lying on the floor on his\nside. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the difference?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he asked. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey got us; we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re in the jug.\nAnd face it: somebody would have caught us sooner or later, and we might\nhave wound up in a worse jail than this one.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He shifted uncomfortably.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIf that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s possible, I mean. Why don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t they at least have beds in these\nplaces?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Bernie immediately, \u00e2\u0080\u009csome do. The jails in Azor City and\nNuevo Reykjavik have beds; Novj Grad, Eleanor, and Milo don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t. I mean,\nthat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what they tell me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he added virtuously.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSure,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ross growled. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, what do they tell you usually happens\nnext?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBernie spread his hands. \u00e2\u0080\u009cDifferent things. First there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a hearing.\nThat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all over by now. Then an indictment and trial. Maybe that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nstarted already; sometimes they get it in on the same day as the\nhearing, sometimes not. Then\u00e2\u0080\u0094tomorrow sometime, most likely\u00e2\u0080\u0094comes the\nsentencing. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll know about that, though, because we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be there. The\nlaw\u00e2\u0080\u0099s very strict on that\u00e2\u0080\u0094they always have you in the court for\nsentencing.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nRoss cried, \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou mean the trial might be going on right now without us?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOf course. What else? Think they\u00e2\u0080\u0099d take a chance on having the\nprisoners creating a disturbance during the trial?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nRoss groaned and turned his face to the wall. For this, he thought, he\nhad come the better part of a hundred light years; for this he had left\na comfortable job with a brilliant future. He spent a measurable period\nof time cursing the memory of old Haarland and his double-jointed,\npersuasive tongue.\n\nBack in the days of Ross\u00e2\u0080\u0099s early teens he had seen a good many\nsituations like this in the tri-dis, and the hero had never failed to\nextricate himself by a simple exercise of superhuman strength,\nintellect, and ingenuity. That, Ross told himself, was just what he\nneeded now. The trouble was, he didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have them.\n\nAll he had was the secret of faster-than-light travel. And, here on Azor\nas on the planet of the graybeards, it had laid a king-sized egg. Women,\nRoss thought bitterly, women were basically inward-directed and\nself-seeking; trust them with the secret of F-T-L; make them, like the\nCavallos, custodians of a universe-racking truth; and see the secret\nlost or embalmed in sterile custom. What, he silently demanded of\nhimself, did the greatest of scientific discoveries mean to a biological\nbaby-foundry? How could any female\u00e2\u0080\u0094no single member of which class had\never painted a great picture, written a great book, composed a great\nsonata, or discovered a great scientific truth\u00e2\u0080\u0094appreciate the ultimate\nimportance of the F-T-L drive? It was like entrusting a first-folio\nShakespeare to a broody hen; the shredded scraps would be made into a\nnest. For the egg came first. Motherhood was all.\n\nThat explained it, of course. That, Ross told himself moodily, explained\neverything except why the F-T-L secret had fallen into apparently equal\nor worse desuetude on such planets as Gemsel, Clyde, Cyrnus One,\nRagansworld, Tau Ceti II, Capella\u00e2\u0080\u0099s family of eight, and perhaps a\nhundred others.\n\nRagansworld was gone entirely, drowned in a planetary nebula.\n\nThe planet of the graybeard had gone to seed; nothing new, nothing not\nhallowed by tradition had a chance in its decrepit social order.\n\nHis home, Halsey\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Planet, was rapidly, calmly, inevitably depopulating\nitself.\n\nAnd Azor had fallen into a rigid, self-centered matriarchal order that\nonly an act of God could break.\n\nWas there a pattern? Were there any similarities?\n\nRoss searched desperately in his mind; but without result. The image of\nHelena kept intruding itself between him and his thoughts. Was he\ngetting sentimental about that sweet little chucklehead? Who, he hastily\nadded, had come near to criminally assaulting him, who had climbed\nthe....\n\nHe turned to the little waiter and demanded: \u00e2\u0080\u009cWill she\u00e2\u0080\u0094Helena\u00e2\u0080\u0094be on the\norbital station with us if we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re all convicted?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHmm\u00e2\u0080\u0094no, I should think not. As a responsible person, she gets the\nsupreme penalty.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nRoss numbly asked after a long pause, \u00e2\u0080\u009cHow? Nothing\u00e2\u0080\u0094painful?\u00e2\u0080\u009d It was\nhard to think of Helena dangling grotesquely at a rope\u00e2\u0080\u0099s end or jolting\nas she sat strapped in a large, ugly chair. But there were things he had\nheard of which were horribly worse.\n\nBernie had been watching him. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m sorry,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the little man said soberly.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s up to the judge. She\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a foreigner, so they may consider that an\nextenuating circumstance and place some quick-acting poison aboard for\nher to take. Otherwise it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s slow starvation.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nA faint, irrational hope had begun to dawn in Ross\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mind. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAboard what?\nExactly how does it work?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThey\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll put her aboard some hulk with the rockets disabled, fire it off\ninto space\u00e2\u0080\u0094and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s that. I suppose they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll use the ship she came\nin\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nRoss was frantically searching his pockets. He had a stylus. \u00e2\u0080\u009cGot any\npaper?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he briskly demanded of Bernie.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, but\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0094?\u00e2\u0080\u009d The waiter blankly passed over an order book. Ross\nsprawled on the floor and began to scribble: \u00e2\u0080\u009cNever mind how or why this\nworks. Do it. You saw me work the big fan-shaped computer in the center\nroom and you can do it too. Find the master star maps in the chart room.\nLook up the co-ordinates of Halsey\u00e2\u0080\u0099s System. Set these co-ordinates on\nthe twenty-seven dials marked Proximate Mass. Take the readings on the\nwindows above the dials and set them on the cursors of the computer\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nHe scribbled furiously, from time to time forcing himself deliberately\nto slow down as the writing became an unreadable scrawl. He filled the\nruled fronts of the order pages and then the backs\u00e2\u0080\u0094perhaps ten thousand\nclosely-written words, and not one of them wasted. Haarland\u00e2\u0080\u0099s precise\ninstructions, mercilessly drilled into him, flowed out again.\n\nHe flung the stylus down at last and read through the book again,\nignoring the gaping Bernie. It was all there, as far as he could tell.\nGrant her a lot of luck and more brains than he privately credited her\nwith, and she had a fighting chance of winding up within radar range of\nHalsey\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Planet. GCA could take her down from there; an annoying\nship-like object hanging on the radarscopes would provoke a\nreconnaissance.\n\nShe knew absolutely nothing about F-T-L or the Wesley drive, but\nthen\u00e2\u0080\u0094neither did he. That fact itself was no handicap.\n\nHe might rot on \u00e2\u0080\u009cMinerva,\u00e2\u0080\u009d but some word might get back to Haarland. And\nso would the ship. And Helena would not perish miserably in a drifting\nhulk.\n\nBernie saw the mysterious job was ended and dared to ask, \u00e2\u0080\u009cA letter?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ross said jubilantly. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBy God, if things break right they won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\nget her. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s like this\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe happily began to explain that his F-T-L ship\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rockets were only\nauxiliaries for fine maneuvering, but he counted on the court not\nknowing that. If he and Helena could persuade....\n\nAs he went on the look on Bernie\u00e2\u0080\u0099s face changed very slowly from hope to\npity to politely-simulated interest. Correspondingly Ross\u00e2\u0080\u0099s accounting\nbecame labored and faulty. The pauses became longer and at last he broke\noff, filled with self-contempt at his folly. He said bitterly, \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou\ndon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll work.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, no!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Bernie protested with too much heartiness. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI could see she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nawfully mechanically-minded for a woman, even if it wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be polite\nto say so. Sure it\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll work, Ross. Sure!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe hell it would.\n\nAt least he had disposed of a few hours. And\u00e2\u0080\u0094perhaps some bungling\nsetting would explode the ship, or end a Wesley Jump in the heart of a\nwhite dwarf star\u00e2\u0080\u0094sudden annihilation, whiffing Helena out of existence\nbefore her body could realize that it had died, before the beginning of\napprehension could darken happy absorption with a task she thought would\nbring her to safety.\n\nFor that reason alone he had to carry the scheme through.\n\n                  *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe courtroom was a chintzy place bright with spring flowers. Ross and\nHelena looked numbly at one another from opposite corners while the\nprevious order of business was cleared from the docket. A wedding.\n\nThe judge, unexpectedly sweet-faced and slender though gray, obviously\ntook such parts of her work seriously. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMarylyn and Kent,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she was\nsaying earnestly to the happy couple, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI suppose you know my reputation.\nI lecture people a bit before I tie the knot. Evidently it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not such a\nbad idea because my marriages turn out well. Last week in Eleanor one of\nmy girls was arrested and reprimanded for gross infidelity and a couple\nof years ago right here in Novj Grad one of my boys got five hundred\nlashes for nonsupport. Let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hope it did them some good, but the cases\nwere unusual. My people, I like to think, know their rights and\nresponsibilities when they walk out of my court, and I think the record\nbears me out.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMarylyn, you have chosen to share part of your life with this man. You\nintend to bear his children. This should not be because your animal\nappetites have overcome you and you can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t win his consent in any other\nway but because you know, down deep in your womanly heart, that you can\nmake him happy. Never forget this. If you should thoughtlessly conceive\nby some other man, don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t tell him. He would only brood. Be thrifty,\nMarylyn. I have seen more marriages broken up by finances than any other\nreason. If your husband earns a hundred Eleanors a week, spend only that\nand no more. If he makes _fifty_ Eleanors a week spend only that and no\nmore. Honorable poverty is preferable to debt. And, from a practical\nstandpoint, if you spend more than your husband earns he will be jailed\nfor debt sooner or later, with resulting loss to your own pocket.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cKent, you have accepted the proposal of this woman. I see by your\ndossier that you got in just under the wire. In your income group the\nantibachelor laws would have caught up with you in one more week. I must\nsay I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t like the look of it, but I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll give you the benefit of the\ndoubt. I want to talk to you about the meaning of marriage. Not just the\nwage assignment, not just the insurance policy, not just the waiver of\npaternity and copulation \u00e2\u0080\u0098rights\u00e2\u0080\u0099, so-called. Those, as a good citizen,\nyou will abide by automatically\u00e2\u0080\u0094Heaven help you if you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t. But there\nis more to marriage than that. The honor you have been done by this\nwoman who sees you as desirable and who wishes to make you happy over\nthe years is not a sterile legalism. Marriage is like a rocket, I\nsometimes think. The brute, unreasoning strength of the main jets\nrepresenting the husband\u00e2\u0080\u0099s share and the delicate precise steering and\nstabilizing jets the wife\u00e2\u0080\u0099s. We have all of us seen too many marriages\ncrash to the ground like a rocket when these roles were reversed. It is\nnot reasonable to expect the wife to provide the drive\u00e2\u0080\u0094that is, the\nincome. It is not reasonable to expect the husband to provide the\nsteering\u00e2\u0080\u0094that is, the direction of the personal and household\nexpenditures. So much for the material side of things. On the spiritual\nside, I have little to say. The laws are most explicit; see that you\nobey them\u00e2\u0080\u0094and if you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t, you had better pray that you wind up in some\ncourt other than mine. I have no patience with the obsolete doctrine\nthat there is such a legal entity as seduction by female, despite the\nmouthings of certain so-called jurists who disgrace the bench of a\ncertain nearby city.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHaving heard these things, Marylyn and Kent, step forward and join\nhands.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThey did. The ceremony was short and simple; the couple then walked from\nthe courtroom under the beaming smile of the judge.\n\nA burly guard next to Ross pointed at the groom. \u00e2\u0080\u009cLook,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said\nsentimentally. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s crying. Cute!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t blame the poor sucker,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ross flared, and then, being a man of\nconscience, wondered suddenly if that was why, on Halsey\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Planet, women\ncried at weddings.\n\nA clerk called: \u00e2\u0080\u009cDear, let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s have those egalitarians front and center,\nplease. Her honor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s terribly rushed.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHelena was escorted forward from one side, while Ross and Bernie were\njostled to the fore from the other. The judge turned from the happy\ncouple. As she looked down at the three of them the smile that curved\nher lips turned into something quite different. Ross, quailing, suddenly\nrealized that he had seen just that expression once before. It was when\nhe was very, very young, when a friend of his mother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s had come bustling\ninto the kitchen where he was playing, just after she had smelled, and\njust before she had seen, the long-dead rat he had fetched up from the\nabandoned cellar across the street.\n\nWhile the clerk was reading the orders and indictment, the judge\u00e2\u0080\u0099s stare\nnever wavered. And when the clerk had finished, the judge\u00e2\u0080\u0099s silent stare\nremained, for a long, terrible time.\n\nIn the quietest of voices, the judge said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cSo.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nRoss caught a flicker of motion out of the corner of his eye. He turned\njust in time to see Bernie, knees buckling, slip white-faced and\nunconscious to the floor. The guards rushed forward, but the judge\nraised a peremptory hand. \u00e2\u0080\u009cLeave him alone,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she ordered soberly. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is\nkinder. Defendants, you are charged with the gravest of crimes. Have you\nanything to say before sentence is passed on you?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nRoss tried to force words\u00e2\u0080\u0094any words, to protest, to plead, to\nvilify\u00e2\u0080\u0094through his clogged throat. All he managed was a croaking sound;\nand Helena, by his side, nudged him sharply to silence. He turned to her\nsharply, and realized that this was the best chance he\u00e2\u0080\u0099d be likely to\nget. He clutched at her, rolled up his eyes, slumped to the floor in as\nclose an imitation of Bernie\u00e2\u0080\u0099s swoon as he could manage.\n\nThe judge was visibly annoyed, and this time she didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t stop the\nattendants when they rushed in to kick him erect. But he had the\nconsolation of seeing a flash of understanding cross Helena\u00e2\u0080\u0099s face, and\nher hand dart to a pocket with the paper he had handed her. In the\nconfusion no one saw.\n\nThe rest of the courtroom scene was kaleidoscopic in Ross\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nrecollection. The only part he remembered clearly was the judge\u00e2\u0080\u0099s voice\nas she said to him and Bernie, \u00e2\u0080\u009c\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0094for the rest of your lives, as long as\nAlmighty God shall, in Her infinite wisdom, permit you the breath of\nlife, be banished from Azor and all of its allied worlds to the prison\nhulk in \u00e2\u0080\u0098Orbit Minerva.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd they were hustled out as the judge, even more wrathful than before,\nturned to pronounce sentence on Helena.\n\n\n\n\n..... 9\n\n\nTHE guard spat disgustedly. \u00e2\u0080\u009cFine lot of wrecks we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re getting,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she\ncomplained. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNot like the old days. They used to send real men here.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nShe glowered at Ross and Bernie, holding their commitment papers loosely\nin her hand. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd for treason, too!\u00e2\u0080\u009d she added. \u00e2\u0080\u009cUsed to be it took guts\nto commit a crime against the state.\u00e2\u0080\u009d She shook her head, then made a\nnoise of distaste and scribbled initials on the commitment papers. She\nhanded them back to the pilot who had brought them up from Azor, who\ngrinned, waved, and got out of there. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAll right,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the guard, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwe\nhave to take what we get. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have to put you two on construction;\nyou\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll never stand up under hard work. Keep your noses clean, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nall. Up at 0500; breakfast till 0510; work detail till 1950; dinner and\nrecreation till 2005; then lights out. Miss a formation and you miss a\nmeal. Miss two, and you get punishment detail. Nobody misses three.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nRoss and Bernie found themselves sharing a communal cell. They had all\nof five minutes to look around and get oriented; then they were out on\ntheir first work detail.\n\nIt wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t so bad as it sounded. Their shiftmates were a couple of dozen\nragged-looking wrecks, half-heartedly assembling a sort of meccano-toy\nwall out of sheets of perforated steel and clip-spring bolts. All the\nparts seemed well worn; some of the bolts hardly closed. It took Ross\nthe better part of his first detail, whispering when the guards were\nlooking the other way, to find out why. Their half of the prisoners were\nConstruction; the other half was Demolition. What Construction in the\nmorning put up, Demolition in the evening tore down. Neither side was\nanxious to set any speed records, and the guards without exception were\ntoo bored to care.\n\nWith any kind of luck, Ross found, he could hope eventually to get a\nreal job\u00e2\u0080\u0094manning the \u00e2\u0080\u009cMinerva\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\u00e2\u0080\u009d radar, signal, or generating\nfacilities, working in the kitchens or service shops, perhaps even as an\norderly in the guard quarters. (Although Ross quite by accident chanced\nto see a guard\u00e2\u0080\u0099s orderly as he passed through a corridor near the work\narea, a handkerchief held daintily to his nose. And though the orderly\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nclothing was neat and his plump cheeks indicated good eating, the\nhaunted expression in his eyes made Ross think twice.)\n\nThe one thing he could not do, according to the testimony of every man\nhe spoke to, was escape.\n\nThe fifth time Ross got that answer, the guard had stepped out of the\nroom. Ross took the opportunity to thrash the thing through. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he\ndemanded. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBack where I come from we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got lots of prisons. I never\nheard of one nobody escaped from.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe other prisoner laughed shortly. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNow you have,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cGo ahead,\ntry. Every one of us has tried, one time or another. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s only one\nthing stopping you\u00e2\u0080\u0094there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no place to go. You can get past the guards\neasy enough\u00e2\u0080\u0094they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re lazy, when they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not either drunk or boy-chasing.\nYou can roam around \u00e2\u0080\u0098Minerva\u00e2\u0080\u0099 all you like. You can even get to the\nspacelock, and if you want to you can walk right through it. But not in\na spacesuit, because there aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t any on board. And not into the tender\nthat brings us up from Azor, because you aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t built right.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nRoss looked puzzled. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNot built right?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s right. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s telescreens and remote-control locks built into\nthat tender. The pilot brings you up, but once she couples with\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Minerva\u00e2\u0080\u0099 the controls lock. And the only way they get unlocked is when\nthree women, in three different substations down on Azor, push the RC\nreleases. And they don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t do that until they look in their screens, and\nsee that everybody who has turned up in the tender has stripped down to\nnothing at all, and every one of them is by-God female. Any further\nquestions?\u00e2\u0080\u009d He grinned wryly. \u00e2\u0080\u009cDon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even think about plastic surgery,\nif that happens to cross your mind,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe have two men here who\ntried it. You don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have much equipment here; you can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t do a neat enough\njob.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nRoss gulped. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHadn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t given it a thought,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he assured the other man. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou\ncan\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even hide away in a trunk or something?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe prisoner shook his head. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t any trunks. Everything\u00e2\u0080\u0099s one\nway\u00e2\u0080\u0094Azor to \u00e2\u0080\u0098Minerva\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u0094except pilots and guards. No men ever go back.\nWhen you die, you go out the lock\u00e2\u0080\u0094without a ship. Same with everything\nelse that they want to get rid of.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nRoss thought hard. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat if they\u00e2\u0080\u0094well, what if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re sent up here and\nall, and then some new evidence turns up and you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re found innocent?\nDon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t they send you back then?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cFound innocent?\u00e2\u0080\u009d The man looked at Ross pityingly. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMan, you _are_ new.\nHey,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he called. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHey, Chuck! This guy wants to know what happens if\nthey find out back on Azor that he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s innocent!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nChuck exploded into laughter. Wiping his eyes, he walked over to Ross.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThanks,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he grinned. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHaven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t had a good laugh in fifteen years.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t see that that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s so funny,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ross said defensively. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAfter all,\nthe judge can make a mistake, none of us is per\u00e2\u0080\u0094awk!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cShut up!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Chuck hissed, holding a hand over Ross\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mouth. \u00e2\u0080\u009cDo you want\nto get us all in _real_ trouble? Some of these guys would rat to the\nguards for an extra hunk of bread! The judges never make a mistake.\u00e2\u0080\u009d And\nhis lips formed the silent word: \u00e2\u0080\u009cOfficially.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe let go of Ross and stood back, but didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t walk away. He scratched his\nhead. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSay,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou ask some stupid questions. Where are you\nfrom, anyhow?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nRoss said bitterly, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the use? You won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t believe me. I happen to\nbe from a place called Halsey\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Planet, which is a good long distance\nfrom here. About as far as light will travel in two hundred years, if\nthat gives you an idea. I came here in an F-T-L\u00e2\u0080\u0094that is, a\nfaster-than-light ship. You don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know what that is, of course, but I\ndid. It was a mistake, I admit it. But here I am.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nSomewhat to Ross\u00e2\u0080\u0099s surprise, Chuck didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t laugh again. He looked\ndubious, and he scratched his head some more, but he didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t laugh. To\nthe other prisoner he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat do you think, Sam?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nSam shrugged. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSo maybe we were wrong,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he observed.\n\nRoss demanded, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWrong about what?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Chuck said hesitantly, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a guy here named Flarney. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a\npretty old son-of-a-gun by now, must be at least ninety, and he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been\nhere a good long time. Dunno how long. But he talks crazy, just like\nyou. No offense,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he added, \u00e2\u0080\u009cit\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just that we all thought he\u00e2\u0080\u0099d gone\nspace-happy. But maybe we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re wrong. Unless\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d his eyes narrowed \u00e2\u0080\u009cunless\nthe two of you are both space-happy, or trying to kid us, or something.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nRoss said urgently, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI swear, Chuck, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no such thing. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s true.\nWho\u00e2\u0080\u0099s this Flarney? Where does he say he came from?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWho can make sense out of what he says? All I know is, he talked a lot\nabout something faster than light. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s crazy; that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s like saying\nslower than dark, or bigger than green, or something. But I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know,\nmaybe it means something.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBelieve me, Chuck, it does! Where is this man\u00e2\u0080\u0094can I see him?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nChuck looked uncertain. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, sure. That is, you can see him all right.\nBut it isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t going to do you a whole hell of a lot of good, because he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\ndead. Died yesterday; they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to pitch him out into space sometime\ntoday.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nSam said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is when Whitker flips. One week without his old pal\nFlarney and he\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll begin to look funny. Two weeks and he starts acting\nfunny. Three and he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s talking funny and the guards begin to crack down.\nI give him a month to get shot down and heaved through the locker.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nOld pal? Ross demanded, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWho\u00e2\u0080\u0099s this Whitker? Where can I get in touch\nwith him?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHim and Flarney were both latrine orderlies. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s where they put the\nfeeble old men, mopping and polishing. Number Two head, any hour of the\nday or night. Old buzzard has his racket\u00e2\u0080\u0094we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re supposed to get a hank of\ncellosponge per man per day, but he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s always \u00e2\u0080\u0098fresh out\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u0094unless you slip\nhim your saccharine ration every once in a while.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nRoss asked the way to Number Two head and the routine. But it was an\nhour before he could bring himself to ask the hulking guard for\npermission.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSure, sonny,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she boomed. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll show you the way. Need any help?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, thanks, ma\u00e2\u0080\u0099am,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said hastily, and she roared with laughter. So\ndid the members of the construction gang; it must have been an ancient\ngag. He hurried on his way thinking dark and bloody thoughts.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhitker?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he asked a tottering ancient who nodded and drowsed amid the\nfacilities of the head.\n\nThe old man looked up blearily and squeaked: \u00e2\u0080\u009cFresh out. Fresh out. You\nshould\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve saved some from yesterday.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all right. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m a new man here. I want to ask you about your\nfriend Flarney\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWhitker bowed his head and began to cry noiselessly.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m sorry, Mr. Whitker. I heard. But there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s something we can do about\nit\u00e2\u0080\u0094maybe. Flarney was a faster-than-light man. He must have told you\nthat. So am I. Ross, from Halsey\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Planet.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe hadn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t the faintest idea as to whether any of this was getting\nthrough to the ancient.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt seems Flarney and I were both on the same mission, finding out how\nand why planets were dropping out of communication. You and he used to\ntalk a lot, they tell me. Did he ever tell you anything about that?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWhitker looked up and squeaked dimly. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, yes. All the time. I humored\nhim. He was an old man, you know. And now he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dead.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The tears leaked\nfrom his rheumy eyes and traced the sad furrows beside his nose.\n\nWas he getting through? \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat did he _say_, Mr. Whitker? About\nfaster-than-light?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe old man said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cL-sub-T equals L-sub-zero e to the minus\nT-over-two-N.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThat damned formula again! \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut what does it mean, Mr. Whitker? What did\nhe say it meant?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ross softly urged.\n\nThe old man looked surprised. \u00e2\u0080\u009cGenes?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he asked himself hazily.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGenerations? I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t remember. But you go to Earth, young man. Flarney\nsaid _they\u00e2\u0080\u0099d_ know, and know what to do about it, too, which is more\nthan he did. His very words, young man!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nRoss didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t dare stay longer. Furthermore he suspected that the old\nman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s attention span had been exhausted. He started from the room with a\nmuttered thanks, and was stopped at the door by Whitker\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hand on his\nshoulder.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou\u00e2\u0080\u0099re a good boy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Whitker squeaked. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHere.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nRoss found himself walking down the corridor with an enormous wad of\ncellosponge in his hand.\n\nThe bunks were hard, but that didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t matter. Dormitories were the\noutermost layer of the hulk, pseudogravity varies inversely as the\nfourth power of the distance, and the field generator was conventionally\nlocated near \u00e2\u0080\u009cMinerva\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\u00e2\u0080\u009d center. When your relative weight is\none-quarter normal you can sleep deliciously on a gravel driveway. This\nwas the dormitory\u00e2\u0080\u0099s only attractive feature. Otherwise it was too many\nsteel slabs, tiered and spotted too close, too many unwashed males, too\nmuch weary snoring. The only things in short supply were headroom and\nair.\n\nNot everybody slept. Insomniacs turned and grunted; those who had given\nup the struggle talked from bunk to bunk in considerately low tones.\n\nBernie muttered from a third-tier bunk facing Ross\u00e2\u0080\u0099s: \u00e2\u0080\u009cI wonder if she\nmade it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nRoss knew what he meant. \u00e2\u0080\u009cUnlikeliest thing in the world,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut\nI think she went fast and never knew what hit her.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He thought of the\nformula and \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey\u00e2\u0080\u0099d know on Earth\u00e2\u0080\u0094and know what to do about it too.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nEarth the enigma, from which all planetary peoples were supposed to be\nderived. Earth\u00e2\u0080\u0094the dot on the traditional master charts, Earth\u00e2\u0080\u0094from\nwhich and to which no longliners ever seemed to travel. Haarland had\ntold him no F-T-L ship had in recent centuries ever reported again after\nsetting out for Earth. Another world sunk in barbarism? But Flarney had\nsaid\u00e2\u0080\u0094no; that was not data. That was the confused recollections of a\nvery old man, possibly based on the confused recollections of another\nvery old man. Perhaps it had got mixed up with the semilegendary origin\nstory.\n\nPoor sweet Helena! He hoped it had happened fast, that she had been\nthinking of some pleasant prospect on Halsey\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Planet. In her na\u00c3\u00afve way\nshe\u00e2\u0080\u0099d think it just around the corner, a mere matter of following\ninstructions....\n\n                  *       *       *       *       *\n\nSo thought Ross, the pessimist.\n\nIn his gloom he had forgotten that this was exactly what it was. In his\nsnobbishness he never realized that he was guilty of the most frightful\narrogance in assuming that what he could do, she could not. In his\nignorance he was not aware that since navigation began, every new\ninstrument, every technique, has drawn the shuddery warnings of savants\nthat uneducated skippers, working by rote, could not be expected to\nmaster these latest fruits of science\u00e2\u0080\u0094or that uneducated skippers since\nnavigation began have cheerfully adopted new instruments and techniques\nat the drop of a hat and that never once have the shuddery warnings been\njustified by the facts.\n\nUp the aisle somebody was saying in a low, argumentative tone, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI saw\nthe drum myself. Naturally it was marked Dulsheen Creme, but the guards\nhere never did give a damn whether their noses were dull or bright\nenough to flag down a freighter and I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve suddenly\nchanged. It was booze, I tell you. Fifty liters of it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGawd! The hangovers tomorrow.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll all have to watch our steps. I hope they don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t do anything worse\nthan getting quietly drunk in their quarters. Those foot-kissing\norderlies\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll get a workout, but who cares what happens to an orderly?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThey haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t been on a real tear since I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been here.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLucky you. Let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hope they don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t bust loose tonight. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a break in\nthe monotony, sure\u00e2\u0080\u0094but those girls play rough. Five prisoners died last\ntime.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThey beat them up?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOne of them.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat about the others? Oh! Oh, Gawd\u00e2\u0080\u0094fifty liters, you said?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBernie began to whimper: \u00e2\u0080\u009cNot again! Not those plug-uglies! I swear I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll\nthrow myself through the spacelock if they make a pass at me. Ross,\nisn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t there anything we can do?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSeems not, Bernie. Maybe they won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t come in. Or if they do, maybe\nthey\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll pass you by. There certainly isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t any place to hide.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nA raucous female voice roared through the annunciator: \u00e2\u0080\u009cBed check five\nminutes, boys. Anybody got any li\u00e2\u0080\u0099l thing to do down the hall, better do\nit now. See you lay-terrr!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Hiccup and drunken giggle.\n\nFor the first time in his life Ross suddenly and spontaneously acted\nlike a tri-di hero, with the exception that he felt like a silly ass\nthrough it all.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGot an idea,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he muttered. \u00e2\u0080\u009cGet out of your bunk.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He pulled the wad of\ncellosponge, old Whitker\u00e2\u0080\u0099s present, from his pocket and yanked it in\nhalf, one for him and one for Bernie.\n\nThe Pullover said faintly: \u00e2\u0080\u009cThanks, but I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have to\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nRoss didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t bother to answer. He was carefully fluffing the stuff out to\nits maximum dimensions. He unzipped his coveralls and began wadding them\nwith cellosponge.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI get it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Bernard said softly. He stepped out of his one-piece garment\nand followed suit. In less than a minute they had creditable dummies\nlying on their bunks.\n\nThe others watched their activity with emotions ranging between awe and\nenvy. One giant of a man proclaimed grimly to whoever cared to listen:\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThese are a couple of smart guys. I wish them luck. And I want you guys\nto know that I will personally break the back of any sneaking rat who\ntips off a guard about this.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSure, Ox. Sure,\u00e2\u0080\u009d came a muted chorus.\n\nArranged in a fetal sleeping position, face down, the dummies astonished\neven their creators. It would take a lucky look in a fair light to note\nthat the heads were earless, fibrous globes.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThey\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll do,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ross snapped. \u00e2\u0080\u009cCome on, Bernie.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThey walked quietly from the dormitory in their singlet underwear toward\nthe dormitory latrine\u00e2\u0080\u0094and past it. Into the corridor. Through a doorless\nopening into a storeroom piled with crates of rations. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll do,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nRoss said quietly. They ducked into a small cavern formed by sloppy\nissuing of stock and hunched down.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe dummies will fool the bed check. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s only a sweep with a\nhundred-line TV system. If the guards do raid the dormitory tonight\nwe\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have to count on them ignoring the dummies or thinking they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re a\njoke or being too busy with other things to care. They\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be drunk,\nafter all. Then in the morning things\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be plenty disorganized. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll\nbe able to sneak back into formation\u00e2\u0080\u0094and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be that for a matter of\nyears. They can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t often bribe the pilots with enough to guarantee a real\nripsnorting drunk. Now try and get some sleep. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nothing more we\ncan do.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThey actually did doze off for a couple of hours, and then were awakened\nby drunken war whoops.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s them!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Bernie wailed.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cShut up. They\u00e2\u0080\u0099re heading for the dormitory. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re safe.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSafe!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Bernie echoed derisively. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSafe until when?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nRoss threatened him with the side of his hand and Bernie was quiet,\nthough his lips were mumbling soundlessly. The guards lurched giggling\npast and Ross said:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll sneak into the lockroom. There won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be anybody there tonight; at\nleast we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll get a night\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sleep.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBig deal,\u00e2\u0080\u009d grumbled Bernie, but he followed, complaining inarticulately\nto himself. Ross thought tiredly: All this work for a night\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sleep! And\nsaw, half-formed, the dreadful procession of days and nights and years\nahead....\n\nThey reached the lockroom and stumbled in breathlessly.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDearie!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Two guards, playing a card game on the floor with a ring of\nempty bottles around them, looked up in drunken delight. \u00e2\u0080\u009cDearie!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nrepeated the bigger of the two. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAngela, _look_ what _we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve_ got!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nRoss said stupidly. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut you shouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be here\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe guard made a clumsy pass at fluffing up her back hair and giggled.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDuty comes first, dearie. Angela, just lock that door, will you?\u00e2\u0080\u009d The\nother guard scrambled unevenly to her feet and weaved over to the door.\nIt was locked before Ross or Bernie could move.\n\nThe big guard stood up too, leering at Bernie. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWow!\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNew\nmerchandise. Just be patient, dearie. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got a little something to\nattend to in a couple of minutes, but we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have _lots_ of time after\nthat.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThen things began to happen rapidly. There was Angela the guard,\ninarticulate, falling-down drunk; she waved bonelessly at a brightly\nflickering light on the far side of the lockroom. There was the other\nguard, reaching out for Bernie with one hand, pawing at a bottle with\nthe other. There was Ross, a paralyzed spectator.\n\nAnd there was Bernie.\n\nBernie\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eyes bulged wide as the guard came toward him. He babbled\nhysterically, \u00e2\u0080\u009cNo! Nonononono! I said I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d kill myself and I\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe stiff-armed the big guard and leaped for the lock door. Ross suddenly\ncame to life. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBernie!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he bellowed. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHold it! Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t jump!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBut it was too late. The one guard sprawling, the other staggering\nhelplessly across the floor, Bernie was clear. He scrabbled at the\nlockwheels, spun them open. Ross tensed himself for the sudden, awful\nrush of expanding air; he leaped after Bernie just as Bernie flung the\nlock door open and jumped.\n\nRoss jumped after.\n\nThere was no rush of air. They were not in space. Around them was no\nripping, sucking void, no flaming backdrop of stars; around them were\nsix walls and a Wesley board, and Helena peering at them wide-eyed and\ndelighted.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell!\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009c_That_ was fast!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n                  *       *       *       *       *\n\nRoss said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHelena, hanging from the acceleration loops, smiled maternally. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, it\nwas nothing,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cRoss don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you think we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re far enough away\nyet?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nRoss said hopelessly, \u00e2\u0080\u009cAll right,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and cut the drive. The starship hung\nin space in the limbo between stars. Azor, \u00e2\u0080\u009cMinerva,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and the rest were\nlight-years behind, far out of range of challenge.\n\nHelena wriggled free from the loops and rubbed her arms where the\nretaining straps had gripped them. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAfter all,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said demurely, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou\n_told_ me how to run the ship, and _really_, Ross, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not quite\n_stupid_.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nRoss said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut what, Ross? It isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t as if I were some sort of brainless little\nthing that had never run a machine in her life. My goodness, Ross\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d She\nwrinkled her nose. \u00e2\u0080\u009c_You_ should remember. All those days in the dye\nvats? Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you think I had to learn a little something about machines\n_there_?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nRoss swore incredulously. To compare those clumsy constructs of wheels\nand rollers with the subtle subelectronic flows of the Wesley force\u00e2\u0080\u0094and\nto make it work! He said, unbelievingly, \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd the \u00e2\u0080\u0098Minerva\u00e2\u0080\u0099 helped you\nvector in? They gave you the co-ordinates and radared your course?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCertainly.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Helena turned to Bernie, who was staring dazedly around\nhim. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAre you all right, dear?\u00e2\u0080\u009d she asked.\n\nRoss turned his back on them and faced the Wesley Christmas tree of\ncontrols. Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t question it, he told himself; take a miracle for what it\nis. God wanted you out of \u00e2\u0080\u009cMinerva\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u0094and God moves in most mysterious\nways His wonders to perform.\n\nAnyway, they had to get going. When the court had exiled Helena in the\nstarship they had gone through the customary rituals; not only was\neverything that looked like a weapon gone, along with all but a teacup\nof fuel for the auxiliary jets, but the food locker was stripped\nentirely. He put everything else out of his mind and began to calculate\na setting.\n\nBernie said over his shoulder, \u00e2\u0080\u009cHome, huh? That place you call Halsey\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nPlanet?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nRoss shook his head. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNot this time. I got this far and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m still alive;\nmaybe I can finish the job. Anyway, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll try. The first solid suggestion\nI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve had ever since I took off was what that half-witted old moron\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d He\nignored a little gasp from Helena. \u00e2\u0080\u009c\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0094said back on \u00e2\u0080\u0098Minerva.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 If Flarney\nhad lived, he would have gone there; we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll go there now.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He finished\nmanipulating the calculator and began to set it up on the board. He\nsaid, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe name of the place is\u00e2\u0080\u0094Earth.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\n\n..... 10\n\n\nIT took Ross a while to learn a lesson, but when he learned it, it\nstuck. This time, he promised himself, _no spaceport_.\n\nThey sneaked into the solar system that held fabulous old Earth from far\noutside the ecliptic, where the chance of radar detection was least;\nthey came to a relative dead halt millions of miles from the planet and\ncautiously scanned the surrounding volume of space with their own radar.\n\nNo ships seemed to be in space. Earth\u00e2\u0080\u0099s solar system turned out to be a\ntrivial affair, only five planets, scarcely a half-dozen moons among\nthem. None of the planets except Earth itself was anything like\ninhabitable.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHold tight,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Ross grimly, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not so good at this fine\nnavigation.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He cautiously applied power along a single vector; the\nstarship leaped and bucked. He corrected with another; and the distant\nsun swelled in their view plates with frightening rapidity. The alarm\nbeeps bleated furiously, and the automatic cutoff restored all controls\nto neutral.\n\nRoss, sweating, picked himself up from the floor and staggered back to\nthe panel. Helena said carefully, \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou\u00e2\u0080\u0099re doing _fine_, Ross, but if\nyou\u00e2\u0080\u0099d like _me_ to take over for a minute\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nRoss swallowed his pride and stood back. After one wide-eyed stare of\nshock\u00e2\u0080\u0094she wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even calculating!\u00e2\u0080\u0094he gripped the loops and closed his\neyes and waited for death.\n\nThere was a punishing bump and his eyes flew open. Helena was looking at\nhim apologetically. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou would have done it better,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she lied, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut\nanyway we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re down.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nRoss lied, \u00e2\u0080\u009cOf course, but I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m glad you had the practice. Where\u00e2\u0080\u0094uh,\nwhere are we?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHelena silently showed him the radar plot. Earth, it seemed, had a\nconfusing multiplicity of continents; they were on one in the northern\nhemisphere, a large one as Earth\u00e2\u0080\u0099s continents went, and smack in the\nmiddle of it. It was night on their side of Earth just then; and, by the\nplot, a largish city was only a dozen or so miles away.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOkay,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Ross wearily, \u00e2\u0080\u009clanding party away. Helena, you stay here\nwhile Bernie and I\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHelena said simply, \u00e2\u0080\u009cNo.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nRoss stared at her a minute, then shrugged. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAll right. Then Bernie will\nstay while\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI will not!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Bernie.\n\nClearly it was time for a showdown. Ross roared: \u00e2\u0080\u009cWho\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the captain\nhere, anyway?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou are,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Helena said promptly. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAs long as I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have to stay here\nalone.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYeah,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Bernie.\n\nRoss said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cOh.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He thought for a while and then said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all\ngo.\u00e2\u0080\u009d They thought it was a wonderful idea.\n\nEarth wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t a very unusual planet\u00e2\u0080\u0094lots of green sand and purple\nvegetation. Either the master star chart was wrong or the gravity meter\nwas off; the former, strangely enough, gave Earth\u00e2\u0080\u0099s gravity as 1.000000\nand the latter as 0.8952, a whopping ten per cent discrepancy. Further,\nthe principal inert gas in Earth\u00e2\u0080\u0099s atmosphere was, according to the\nmaster chart\u00e2\u0080\u0099s planetary supplement, nitrogen; and according to the\nship\u00e2\u0080\u0099s instruments was indubitably neon. A terrific aurora polaris\ndisplay constantly flickering in the northern sky bore that out.\n\nBut the gap between the chart and the facts didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t particularly worry\nRoss as they swung along overland. So the chart was off, or perhaps\nthings had changed. This was\u00e2\u0080\u0094according to Flarney via Whitker\u00e2\u0080\u0094the place\nwhere people knew about the formula, where his questions would be\nanswered. After this, he thought happily, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s off to Halsey\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Planet\nand an unspecified glorious future, revered as the savior of humanity\ninstead of a lousy Yards clerk pushing invoices around. And Helena, he\nthought sentimentally....\n\nHe turned to smile at her and found she and Bernie were giggling.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cListen, you two!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Captain Ross roared. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHaven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you learned anything\nyet? What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the good of us exploring if we stroll along with our silly\nheads in the clouds, not paying attention? Do you realize that this\nplace may be as dangerous as Azor or worse?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cRoss\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d Helena said.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t interrupt! What this outfit needs is some discipline\u00e2\u0080\u0094tightening\nup. You two have got to accept your responsibilities. Keep alert! Be on\nthe lookout! Any single thing out of the ordinary may be a deathtrap.\nWatch for\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHelena was looking not at Ross but over his shoulder. Bernie was making\nstrangled noises and pointing.\n\nRoss turned. Behind him stood a mechanical monstrosity vaguely\nrecognizable as a heavily-armed truck, its motor faintly humming. A man\nleaned darkly from the cab and transfixed them to the ground with a\npowerful spotlight. From the dazzling circle of light his voice came,\nhasty and furtive. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThought it was two women and a man, but I guess\nyou\u00e2\u0080\u0099re the ones. Ugh, those faces on you! Yes, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re the ones. Get in.\nFast.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe light blinked out. When their eyes adjusted to the dimmer\nillumination of the stars and the aurora display they saw a side door in\nthe body of the truck standing open. Too, one of the long, slim gun\nbarrels with which the truck seemed copiously supplied swiveled to cover\nthem.\n\nRoss stupidly read aloud a sign on the truck: \u00e2\u0080\u009cJones Floor-Cover\nCompany. Finest Tile on Jones. Wall-to-Wall a Specialty. \u00e2\u0080\u0098Rugs Fit For a\nJones\u00e2\u0080\u0099.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYeah,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the man said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYeah, yeah. Just don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t try to buy any. Get in,\nfor Jones\u00e2\u0080\u0099 sake! If I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d of known you were half-wits I wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t of taken\nthis job for a million Joneses, cash. Get in!\u00e2\u0080\u009d His voice was hysterical\nand the gun covering them moved ominously. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf this is a frame\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d he\nbegan to shrill.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGet in,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ross said shakily to the others. They climbed in and the door\nslammed violently and automatically. Helena began to cry in a\npreoccupied sort of way and Bernie began a long, mumbling inventory of\nhis own mental weaknesses for ever getting involved in this\ncrackbrained, imbecilic, feeble-minded....\n\nThere were windows in the truck body and Ross turned from one to\nanother. He saw the guns on the cab telescope into stubs, the stubs fold\ninto the mounts, the mounts smoothly descend flush with the sheet metal.\nHe saw the cursing driver manipulate a dozen levers as the car began to\nglide across the green sand, purple-dotted with vegetation. Finally,\nthrough the rear window, he saw three figures racing across the sand\nwaving their arms, rapidly being left behind. All he could make out was\nthat they seemed to be two women and a man.\n\nHelena was wailing softly, \u00e2\u0080\u009c\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0094and I am _not_ ugly and just because we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re\nyoung and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re strangers isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t any reason to go around insulting\npeople\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nFrom Bernie: \u00e2\u0080\u009c\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0094fatheaded, goggly-eyed, no-browed, slobber-lipped,\ndim-witted\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cShut up,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ross said softly. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBefore I bang both your heads together.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThey stared.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThank you. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got to think. What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s this spot we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re in? What can we\ndo about it? I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have any F-T-L contact name for Earth and obviously\nthis fellow picked us up by mistake. I saw two women and a man\u00e2\u0080\u0094remember\nwhat he said?\u00e2\u0080\u0094just now trying to catch up with us. He seems to be some\nkind of criminal. Otherwise why a disguised gun-carrier? Why floor\ncoverings \u00e2\u0080\u0098but don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t try to buy any\u00e2\u0080\u0099? And Jones seems to be the name of\nthe local political subdivision, the name of the local deity and the\ncurrency. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s important. It points to a rigid one-man\ndictatorship\u00e2\u0080\u0094Jones, of course, or possibly his dynasty. What course of\naction should we take? Kick it around. Helena, what do you think?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe shouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have said we were ugly,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she pouted. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIsn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t _that_\nimportant?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWomen!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ross said grimly. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll kindly forget the trivial affront\nto your vanity perhaps we can figure something out.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHelena said stubbornly: \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut he _shouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t_. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not. What if they\njust _think_ we are because they all look alike and we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t look like\nthem?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nRoss collapsed. After a long pause during which he tried and almost\nfailed to control his temper he said slowly: \u00e2\u0080\u009cThank you, Helena. You\u00e2\u0080\u0099re\nwrong, of course, but it was a contribution. You see, you can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t build up\nsuch a wild, far-fetched theory from the few facts available.\u00e2\u0080\u009d His voice\nwas beginning to choke with anger. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t reasonable and it isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\nreally any help. In fact it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the God-damndest stupidest imitation of\nreasoning I have ever\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCity,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Bernard croaked, pointing. The jolting ride had become smoother,\nand gliding past the windows were green tiled buildings and street\nlights.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cFine,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ross said bitterly. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe had a few clear minutes to think and now\nwe find they were wasted by the crackpot dissertation of a female and my\nreasonable attempt to show her the elements of logical thinking.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He put\nhis head in his hands and tried to ignore them, tried to reason it out.\nBut the truck made a couple of sharp turns and jolted to a stop.\n\nThe door opened and the voice of their driver said, again from behind a\nflashlight\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dazzling circle: \u00e2\u0080\u009cOut. Walk ahead of me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThey did, into a fair-sized, well-lighted room with eight people in it\nwhom they studied in amazement. Every one of the eight was exactly the\nsame height\u00e2\u0080\u0094six feet. Every one had straight red hair of exactly the\nsame shade, sprouting from an identical hairline. Every one had\nprecisely the same build\u00e2\u0080\u0094gangling but broad-shouldered. Their sixteen\neyes were the identical blue under sixteen identical eyebrows. Head to\ntoe, they were duplicates. One of them spoke\u00e2\u0080\u0094in exactly the same voice\nas the truckdriver\u00e2\u0080\u0099s.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSo you want to be Joneses, do you?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAbsolutely impossible.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut we took their money.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGive it back. Reasonable changes, yes, but look at them!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t give it back. Look what we spent already. Anyway, Sam,\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d It\nsounded like \u00e2\u0080\u009cSam\u00e2\u0080\u009d to Ross. \u00e2\u0080\u009c\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0094anyway, Sam, look at some of the work\nyou\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve done already. You can do it. I doubt if anybody else could, but\nyou can.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nRoss felt his eyes crossing, and gave up the effort of trying to tell\nwhich Jones was speaking to which. Even the clothing was nearly\nidentical\u00e2\u0080\u0094purple pantaloons, scarlet jacket, black cummerbund sash,\nblack shoes. Then he noticed that Third-from-the-left Jones\u00e2\u0080\u0094the one who\nseemed to be named Sam\u00e2\u0080\u0094wore a frilly shirt of white under the scarlet\njacket. Only a lacy edge showed at the open collar; but where his was\nwhite, the others were all muted pastels of pink and green.\n\nSam said coldly, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI know nobody else can do it. Anybody else! Who else\n_is_ there?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nA Jones with a frill of chartreuse pursed his lips. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWell,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said\nthoughtfully, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Northside Tim Jones\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNorthside Tim Jones,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Sam mimicked. \u00e2\u0080\u009cEight of his jobs are in the\nstockade right now! Paraffin, for Jones\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sake\u00e2\u0080\u0094he still uses paraffin to\nmold a face!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI know, Sam, but after all, these people need help. If you won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t do it\nfor them, what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s left?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nSam shrugged morosely. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWell\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. Then he shook his head, sighed,\nand came forward to look at the three travelers. With an expression of\nrevulsion he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cStrip.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nRoss hesitated. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHold it!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said sharply to Helena, already half out\nof her coveralls. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSir, there may have been some mistake. Would you mind\nexplaining just what you propose to do?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe usual thing,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Sam said irritably. \u00e2\u0080\u009cFix your hair, build up your\nframes, level you off at standard Jones height. The works. Though I must\nsay,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he added bitterly, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI never saw such unpromising specimens in my\nlife. How the Jones have you managed to stay out of trouble this long?\nWhose garrets have you been hiding in?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nRoss licked his lips. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou mean,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou want to make us look\nmore like you gentlemen, is that it?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009c_I_ want!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Sam repeated in bafflement. Over his shoulder he roared,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBen, what kind of creeps are you saddling me with?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBen, looking worried, said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cHoly Jones, Sam, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get it either. It\nwas a perfectly normal deal. This guy came up to me in Jones\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Joint and\nmade a pitch. He knew the setup all right, and he had the money with\nhim. Six hundred Joneses, cold cash; and it wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t funny money, either.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nHis face clouded. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI did think, though,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he mentioned, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat he said two\nwomen and one man. But Paul Jones picked them up right at the\nrendezvous, so it must\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been the right ones.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe glowered suspiciously at Ross and the others. \u00e2\u0080\u009cCome to think of it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nhe said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cmaybe not. Tell you what, Sam, you just sit tight here for\ntwenty minutes or so.\u00e2\u0080\u009d And he hurried out of the room.\n\nOne of the other Joneses said curtly, \u00e2\u0080\u009cSit down.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ross, Bernie, and\nHelena found chairs lined up against a wall; they sat. A different Jones\nrummaged in a stack of papers on a table; he handed something to each of\nthem. \u00e2\u0080\u009cRelax,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he advised. Obediently the three spacefarers opened the\nmagazines he gave them. When they were settled, most of the Joneses,\nafter a whispered conference, went out. The one that was left said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cNo\ntalking. If we made a mistake, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re sorry. Meanwhile, you do what\nyou\u00e2\u0080\u0099re told.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nRoss found that his magazine was called _By Jones_; it seemed to be a\nperiodical devoted to entertaining news and gossip of sports, fashion,\nand culture. He stared at an article headed \u00e2\u0080\u009cBe Glad the People\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Police\nAre Watching YOU!\u00e2\u0080\u009d, but the words made little sense. He tried to think;\nbut somehow he couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t find a point at which to grasp the flickering\nmass of impressions that were circling through his brain. Nothing seemed\nto make a great deal of sense any more; and Ross suddenly realized that\nhe was very, very tired.\n\nHis mind an utter blank, he sat and waited.\n\nIt was twenty minutes and a bit more. Then the door flew open and half a\ndozen Joneses burst in. Even at first sight, Ross could tell that three\nof them were newcomers. For one thing, two were women; and the third,\nthough red-haired, tall and gangling, had a nose a full centimeter\nshorter than any of the others, and his hair was crisply curled.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAll right, you Peepeece!\u00e2\u0080\u009d snarled the first Jones. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou found what you\nwere looking for\u00e2\u0080\u0094now try to get out!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHelena did the talking. It wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t Ross\u00e2\u0080\u0099s idea, but when her heel\ncrunched down on his instep he was too startled to object, and from then\non he didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get a chance to get a word in edgewise.\n\nHe had to admit that her act was getting across with the audience. Long\nbefore she had finished reporting their meeting, their flight to Azor,\nthe escape from \u00e2\u0080\u009cMinerva,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and the flight here, most of the Joneses had\nput their guns away, and all were showing signs of stupefaction. \u00e2\u0080\u009c\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0094And\nthen,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she finished, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwe saw this truck, and that very good-looking man\npicked us up. And so we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re here on Earth; and, honest to goodness,\nthat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the exact truth.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThere was silence while the Joneses looked at each other. Then the\nplastic-surgeon-type Jones, Sam with the white shirt front, stepped\nforward. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHold still, my dear,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he ordered. Helena bravely stood rigid\nwhile the surgeon raked searchingly through the roots of her hair,\npeered into her eyes, expertly traced the configuration of her ribs.\n\nHe stepped back, shaken. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOne thing is for sure,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he told the others,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cthey\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not Peepeece. Not with those bones. They\u00e2\u0080\u0099d never get in.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBen Jones beat his forehead and moaned. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHow do I get into these\nthings?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he demanded.\n\nOne of the female Joneses said shrilly, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t expect anything like\nthis. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re honest Jones-fearing Joneses and\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cShut up!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ben Jones roared. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat about the other two, Sam? They all\nright too?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, for Jones\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sake, Ben,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Sam said disgustedly, \u00e2\u0080\u009cjust look at them,\nwill you? Do you think the police would take in a five-inch height\ndeviation like that one\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d he pointed to Bernie\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009cor a half-bald\nscarecrow like that?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ross, stung, opened his mouth to object; but\nswiftly closed it again. Nobody was paying much attention to him,\nanyhow, except as Exhibit A.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSo what do we do?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ben demanded.\n\nSam shrugged. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe first thing we do,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said wearily, \u00e2\u0080\u009cis to take care\nof our, uh, clients here. We get them out of the way, and then we decide\nwhat to do next.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He looked around at the other Joneses. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf you three\nwill come this way,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwe\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll finish up your job and get you back\nhome. I needn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t remind you, of course, that if you should happen to\nmention anything you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen here tonight to the Peepeece it would\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nHis voice was cut off by the closing door before Ross could catch the\nnature of the threat.\n\nBen Jones stayed behind, scowling to himself. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou people got any\nJoneses?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he demanded abruptly.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou mean money? Not any at all,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Helena said honestly. Ross could have\nkicked her.\n\nBen Jones growled deep in his throat. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAlways it happens to me!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he\ncomplained. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI suppose we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to have to feed you, too.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Helena said diffidently, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwe haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t eaten in a long time\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBen Jones swore to his god, whose name was Jones, but he stepped to the\ndoor and ordered food. When it came it was surprisingly good; each of\nthe three, with their diverse backgrounds, found it delicious. While\nthey were eating, Ben Jones sat watching them, refreshing himself from\ntime to time with a greenish bubbling liquid out of a jug. He offered\nsome to Ross; who clutched his throat as though he\u00e2\u0080\u0099d swallowed molten\nsteel.\n\nBen Jones guffawed till his eyes ran. \u00e2\u0080\u009cFirst taste of Jones\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Juice,\nhey? Kind of gets right down inside, doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t it?\u00e2\u0080\u009d He wiped his eyes,\nthen sobered. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI guess you people are all right,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he admitted. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m\ngoing to do with you I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know. I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t take you to Earth, and I\ncan\u00e2\u0080\u0099t keep you here, and I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t throw you out on the street\u00e2\u0080\u0094the\nPeepeece would have you in the stockade in ten minutes.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nRoss, startled, said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cAren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t we on Earth?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNaw,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ben Jones said disgustedly. \u00e2\u0080\u009cDidn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you hear me? You\u00e2\u0080\u0099re on Jones,\nhalfway between Jones\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Forks and Jonesgrad. But you came pretty close,\nat that. Earth\u00e2\u0080\u0099s about fifty miles out the Jones Pike past Jonesgrad,\nturn right at Jonesboro Minor.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nRoss said bewilderedly, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe planet Earth is fifty miles along the\nPike?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNot a planet,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ben Jones said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an old city, kind of. Nobody lives\nthere any more; the Peepeece don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t permit it. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve never been there, but\nthey say it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s kind of, you know, different. Some of the buildings\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d he\nseemed actually to be blushing\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009care as much as fifteen, twenty stories\nhigh; and the walls aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even all green. Excuse me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he added, looking\nat Helena.\n\nSam Jones returned and said to Ben, \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all right. All finished.\nTrivial alterations. Maybe they could have gone along for the rest of\ntheir lives on wigs and pads\u00e2\u0080\u0094but we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t tell them that, do we? And\nanyway now they won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t worry. Healy Jones, the older man, for instance.\nVery bright fellow, but it seems he was working as a snathe-handler\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\napprentice. Afraid to take the master\u00e2\u0080\u0099s test, afraid to change his line\nof work\u00e2\u0080\u0094might be noticed and questioned.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He heaved a tremendous sigh\nand poured himself a tremendous slug of the green fluid. Ben Jones gave\nRoss a cynical wink and shrug.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLook at my hand!\u00e2\u0080\u009d the surgeon exploded. It was shaking. He gulped the\nJones Juice and poured himself another. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNothing physical,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNeurosis. The subconscious coldly counting up my crimes and coldly\nimposing and executing sentence. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m a surgeon, so my hand trembles.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He\ndrank. \u00e2\u0080\u009cJones is not mocked,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said broodingly. \u00e2\u0080\u009cJones is not mocked.\nThink those three are going to be happy? Think they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to be\nfolded in Jones\u00e2\u0080\u0099s bosom just because they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re Joneses externally now? No.\nWatch them five years, ten years. Maybe they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll sentence themselves to\nbe hateful, vitriol-tempered lice and wonder why nobody loves them.\nMaybe they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll sentence themselves to penal servitude and wonder why\neverybody pushes them around, why they haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t the guts to hit\nback\u00e2\u0080\u0094Jones is not mocked,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he told the jug of green liquid, ignoring the\nothers, and drank again.\n\nBen Jones said softly to them, \u00e2\u0080\u009cCome on,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and led them into an adjoining\nroom furnished with sleeping pads. He said apologetically, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe doctor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nnerves are shot tonight. Trouble is, he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s too Jones-fearing. Me, I can\ntake it or leave it alone.\u00e2\u0080\u009d His laugh had a little too much bravado in\nit. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a little bit of nonJones in the best of us, I always\nsay\u00e2\u0080\u0094but not to the doctor. And not when he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hitting the Jones juice.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nHe shrugged cynically and said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat the hell? L-sub-T equals\nL-sub-zero e to the minus T-over-two-N.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nRoss had him by his shirt frill. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSay that again!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBen Jones shoved him away. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the matter with you, boy?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m sorry. Would you please repeat that formula? What you said?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he\nhastily amended when the word \u00e2\u0080\u009cformula\u00e2\u0080\u009d obviously failed to register.\n\nBen Jones repeated the formula wonderingly.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat does it mean?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ross demanded. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been chasing the damned thing\nacross the Galaxy.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He hastily filled Ben Jones in on its previous\nappearances.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ben Jones said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cit means what it says, of course. I mean, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nobvious, isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t it?\u00e2\u0080\u009d He studied their faces and added uncertainly, \u00e2\u0080\u009cIsn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\nit?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat does it mean to _you_, Ben?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ross asked softly.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy, what it means to anybody, pal. Right\u00e2\u0080\u0099s right, wrong\u00e2\u0080\u0099s wrong, Jones\nis in his Heaven, conform or else\u00e2\u0080\u0094it means morality, man. What else\ncould it mean?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nRoss then proceeded to make an unmannerly nuisance of himself. He\ngrilled their involuntary host mercilessly, shrugging aside all\nattempted diversions of the talk into what they were going to do with\nthe three visitors. He ignored protestations that Ben was no\nJonesologist, Jones knew, and drilled in. By the time Ben Jones\nexploded, stamped out, and locked them in for the night, he had elicited\nthe following:\n\nEverybody knew the formula; they were taught it at their mother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s knee.\nIt was recited antiphonally before and after Jones Meetings. Ben knew it\nwas right, of course, and some day he was going to get right with Jones\nand live up to it, but not just yet, because if he didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t make money in\nthe prosthesis racket somebody else would. The formula was everywhere:\non the lintels of public buildings, hanging in classrooms, and on the\nbedroom walls of the most Jones-fearing old ladies where they could see\nits comforting message last thing at night and first thing in the\nmorning.\n\nFrom a book? Well yes, he guessed so; sure it was in the Book of\nJoneses, but who could say whether that was where it started. Most\npeople thought it was just Handed Down. Way back during the war\u00e2\u0080\u0094what\nwar? The War of the Joneses, of course! Anyway, in the war the last of\nthe holdouts against the formula had been destroyed. No, he didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know\nanything about the war. No, not his grandfather\u00e2\u0080\u0099s time or his\ngrandfather\u00e2\u0080\u0099s grandfather\u00e2\u0080\u0099s time. Long ago, that war was. Maybe there\nwere records in the old museum in Earth. The city, of course, not some\ndamn planet he never heard of!\n\nAfter Ben Jones slammed out and the room darkened Helena and Bernie\nexchanged comforting words from adjoining sleeping pads, to Ross\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nintense displeasure. They fell asleep and at last he fell asleep still\nchurning over the problem.\n\nWhen he woke he found that evidently the doctor, Sam Jones, had stumbled\nin during the night and passed out on the pad next to him. The white\nfrill was stiff and green with dried Jones Juice. Helena and Bernie\nstill slept. He tried the door.\n\nIt was locked, but there was a tantalizing hum of voices beyond it. He\nput his ear to the cold steel. The fruits of his eavesdropping were\nscanty but alarming.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009c\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0094cut \u00e2\u0080\u0099em down mumble found someplace mumble.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009c\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0094mumble never killed yet mumble prosthesis racket.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009c\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0094Jones\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sake, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s their lives or mumble mumble time to get scared\nmumble Peepeece are you?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd then apparently the speakers moved out of range. Ross was cold with\nsweat, and there was an abnormal hollow in the pit of his stomach that\nbreakfast would never fill.\n\nHe spun around as a Jones voice croaked painfully: \u00e2\u0080\u009cHear anything good,\nstranger?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe surgeon, looking very dilapidated, was sitting up and regarding him\nthrough bloodshot eyes. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey\u00e2\u0080\u0099re talking about killing us,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said\nshortly.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThey are not really intelligent,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Sam Jones said wearily. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey were\njust bright enough to entangle me to the point where I had to work for\nthem\u00e2\u0080\u0094and to keep me copiously supplied with that green stuff I haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\nthe intelligence to use in moderation.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nRoss said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cHow\u00e2\u0080\u0099d you like to break away from this?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nSam Jones mutely extended his hand. It trembled like a leaf. He said,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cFor his own inscrutable reason, Jones grants me steadiness of hand\nduring an operation designed to frustrate his grand design. He then\noverwhelms me with a titanic thirst for oblivion to my shame.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no design,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ross said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOr if there is, luckily this planet is\na trifling part of it. I have never heard of such arrogant pip-squeakery\nin my life. You flyspecks in your shabby corner of the Galaxy think your\nown fouled-up mess is the pattern of universal life. You\u00e2\u0080\u0099re wrong! I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve\nseen life elsewhere and I know it isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe doctor passed his trembling hand over his eyes. \u00e2\u0080\u009cJones is not\nmocked,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he croaked. \u00e2\u0080\u009cL-sub-T equals L-sub-zero e to the minus\nT-over-two-N. You can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fight _that_, stranger. You can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fight that.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nRoss realized he was silently crying behind his covering hand.\n\nHe said, much more gently, \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nothing you have to fight. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nsomething you have to understand.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He told Sam Jones of his two previous\nencounters with the formula. The doctor looked up, his eyes full of\nwonder. Ross said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cHow would you like to be free, doctor? Free of your\nshaking hands, free of your guilt, free of these killers? How would you\nlike to know the truth?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe doctor said faintly, \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf I dared\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nRoss pressed, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe museum in Earth city. Get me records, facts, anything\nabout the War of the Joneses. If there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s any meaning to the formula\nit\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have to lie in that. It seems there was a battle about its\ninterpretation and we know who won. Let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s find out what the other side\nsaid. Get me in there.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He was thinking of the disgraceful war of\nfanaticism that had marred his own planet\u00e2\u0080\u0099s history. The doctor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s weak\nJones jaw was firming up, though his eyes were still haunted. \u00e2\u0080\u009cStall\nyour killer friends, doctor,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ross urged. \u00e2\u0080\u009cTell them you can use us for\nexperiments that\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll cut the cost of the operations. That ought to bring\nthem around. And get me the facts!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTo be free,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the doctor said wistfully. He said after a pause, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll\ntry. But\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d And rapped a code series on the steel door.\n\n\n\n\n..... 11\n\n\nTHE doctor said with weak belligerence, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWho do you think I am? Jones? I\n_had_ to leave your friends behind. I had enough trouble getting those\nhoods to let me take _you_ along. After all, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not a miracle-worker.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nRoss said sullenly, \u00e2\u0080\u009cOkay, okay.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He glowered out of the car window and\nspat out a tendril of red hair that had come loose from the fringe\nsurrounding his mouth. The trouble with a false beard was that it\nitched, worse than the real article, worse than any torment Ross had\never known. But at least Ross, externally and at extreme range, was\nenough of a Jones to pass a casual glance.\n\nAnd what would Helena and Bernie be thinking now? He hadn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t had a chance\nto whisper to them; they\u00e2\u0080\u0099d been just waking when the doctor dragged him\nout. Ross put that problem out of his mind; there were problems enough\nright on hand.\n\nHe cautiously felt his red wig to see if it was on straight. The doctor\ndidn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t seem to look away from his driving, but he said: \u00e2\u0080\u009cLeave it alone.\nThat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the first thing the Peepeece look for, somebody who obviously\nisn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t sure if his hair is still on or not. It won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t come off.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cUmph,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Ross. The road was getting worse, it seemed; they had\npassed no houses for several miles now. They rounded a rutted turn, and\nahead was a sign.\n\n                                 STOP!\n                         RESTRICTED AREA AHEAD\n                      WARNING: THIS ROAD IS MINED\n                       NO TRAFFIC ALLOWED! DETOUR\n              \u00e2\u0080\u009cTrespassers beyond this point will be shot\n                 without further notice.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Decree #404-5\n                          People\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Commissariat of\n                           Culture and Solidarity.\n\nThe doctor spat contemptuously out the window and roared past. Ross\nsaid, \u00e2\u0080\u009cHey!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, relax,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the doctor. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just the Cultureniks. Nobody pays\nany attention to _them_.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nRoss swallowed and sat as lightly as possible on the green leather\ncushion of the car. By the time they had gone a quarter of a mile, he\nbegan to feel a little reassured that the doctor knew what he was\ntalking about. Then the doctor swerved sharply to miss a rusted hulk and\nalmost skidded off the road. He swore and manhandled the wheel until\nthey were back on the straightaway.\n\nWhite lipped, Ross asked, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat was that?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCar,\u00e2\u0080\u009d grunted the doctor. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHit a mine. Silly fools!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nRoss squawked, \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut you said\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cShut up,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the doctor ordered tensely. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat was weeks ago; they haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\nhad a chance to lay new mines since then.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Pause. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI hope.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe car roared on. Ross closed his eyes, limply abandoning himself to\nwhat was in store. But if it was bad to see what was going on, the\nroaring, swerving, jolting race was ten times worse with his eyes\nclosed. He opened them again in time to see another sign flash past,\ngone before he could read it.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat was that?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he demanded.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the difference?\u00e2\u0080\u009d the doctor grunted. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWant to go back?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, no\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ross thought for a moment. \u00e2\u0080\u009cDo we have to go this fast,\nthough?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIf we want to get there. Crossed a Peepeece radar screen ten miles\nback; they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be chasing us by now.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, I see,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ross said weakly. \u00e2\u0080\u009cLook, Doc, tell me one thing\u00e2\u0080\u0094why do they\nmake this place so hard to get to?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTabu area,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the doctor said shortly. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNot allowed.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy not allowed?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBecause it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not allowed. Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want people poking through the old\nrecords.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy not just put the old records in a safe place\u00e2\u0080\u0094or burn the damn\nthings up?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBecause they didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s why. Shut up! Expect me to tell you why the\nPeepeece do anything? They don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know themselves. It isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t Jonesly to\ndestroy, I guess.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nRoss shut up. He leaned against the window, letting the air rush over\nhis head. They were moving through forest, purplish squatty trees with\nlong, rustling leaves. The sky overhead was crisp and cool looking; it\nwas still early morning. Ross exhaled a long breath. Back on Halsey\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nPlanet he would be getting up about now, rising out of a soft, warm bed,\ntaking his leisurely time about breakfast, climbing into a comfortable\ncar to make his way to the spaceport where he was safe, respected, and\nat home.... Damn Haarland!\n\nAt least, Ross thought, some sort of a pattern was beginning to shape\nup. The planets were going out of communication each for its own reason;\nbut wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t there a basic reason-for-the-reasons that was the same in\neach case? Wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t there some overall design\u00e2\u0080\u0094some explanation that\ncovered all the facts, pointed to a way out?\n\nHe sat up straight as they approached a string of little signs. He\nscanned them worriedly as they rolled past.\n\n                 \u00e2\u0080\u009cWorkers, Peasants, Joneses all\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n                 \u00e2\u0080\u009cBy these presents know ye\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n                 \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t stop in spite of all\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n                 \u00e2\u0080\u009cTHIS to hell will blow ye!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDuck!\u00e2\u0080\u009d the doctor yelled, crouching down in the seat and guiding the\ncareening car with one hand. Ross, startled, followed his example, but\nnot before he saw that \u00e2\u0080\u009cTHIS\u00e2\u0080\u009d was an automatic, radar-actuated\nrapid-fire gun mounted a few yards past the last sign. There was a\nstuttering roar from the gun and a splatter of metal against the armored\nsides of the car. The doctor sat up again as soon as the burst had hit;\nevidently only one was to be feared. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYah, yah,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he jeered at the absent\nbuilders of the gun. \u00e2\u0080\u009cLousy fifty-millimeters can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t punch their way\nthrough a tin can!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nRoss, gasping, got up just in time to see the last sign in the series:\n\n               \u00e2\u0080\u009cBy order of People\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Democratic Council\n                Of Arts & Sciences, Small Arms Division.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe said wildly, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even write a poem properly. Did you notice\nthe first and third line rhyme-words?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nSurprisingly, the doctor glanced at him and laughed with a note of\nrespect. He took a hand off the wheel to pat Ross on the shoulder.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll make a Jones yet, my boy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he promised. \u00e2\u0080\u009cDon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t worry about these\nthings; I told you this place was restricted. This stuff isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t worth\nbothering about.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nRoss found that he was able to smile. There was a point, he realized\nwith astonishment, where courage came easily; it was the only thing\nleft. He sat up straighter and breathed the air more deeply. Then it\nhappened.\n\nThey rounded another curve; the doctor slammed on the brakes. Suspended\noverhead across the road was a single big sign:\n\n                           THAT\u00e2\u0080\u0099S ALL, JONES!\n                           \u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0094PEOPLE\u00e2\u0080\u0099S POLICE\n\nThe car bucked, slewed around, and skidded. The wheels locked, but not\nin time to keep it from sliding into the pit, road wide and four feet\ndeep, that was dug in front of them.\n\nRoss heard the axles crack and the tires blow; but the springing of the\ncar was equal to the challenge. He was jarred clear in the air and\ntumbled to the floor in a heap; but no bones were broken.\n\nPainfully he pushed the door open and crawled out. The doctor limped\nafter and the two of them stood on the edge of the pit, looking at the\nruin of their car.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat one,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the doctor, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwas worth bothering about.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He motioned\nRoss to silence and cocked an ear. Was there a distant roaring sound,\nlike another car following on the road they had traveled? Ross wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\nsure; but the doctor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s expression convinced him. \u00e2\u0080\u009cPeepeece,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said\nbriefly. \u00e2\u0080\u009cFrom here on it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s on foot. They won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t follow beyond here; but\nlet\u00e2\u0080\u0099s get out of sight. They\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll by-Jones _shoot_ beyond here if they see\nus!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nRoss stared unbelievingly. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is Earth?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he asked.\n\nThe doctor fanned himself and blew. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, looking around\ncuriously. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHeard a lot about it, but I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve never been here before,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he\nexplained. \u00e2\u0080\u009cFunny-looking, isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t it?\u00e2\u0080\u009d He nudged Ross, indicating a\nshattered concrete structure beside them on the road. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNotice that toll\nbooth?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he whispered slyly. \u00e2\u0080\u009cEight sides!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nRoss said wearily, \u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, mighty funny! Look, Doc, why don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you sort of\nwander around by yourself for a while? That big thing up ahead is the\nmuseum you were talking about, isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t it?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe doctor squinted. His eyes were unnaturally bright, and his breathing\nwas fast, but he was making an attempt to seem casual in the presence of\nthese manifold obscenities of design. He licked his lips. \u00e2\u0080\u009c_Round\npillars_,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he marveled. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy, yes, I think that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the museum. You go on\nup there, like you say. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll, uh, sort of see what there is to see.\nJones, yes!\u00e2\u0080\u009d He staggered off, staring from ribald curbing to\nscatological wall in an orgy of prurience.\n\nRoss sighed and walked through the deserted, weed-grown streets to the\nstone building that bore on its cracked lintel the one surviving word,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cEarth.\u00e2\u0080\u009d This was all wrong, he was almost certain; Earth _had_ to be a\nplanet, not a city. But still....\n\nThe museum had to have the answers.\n\nOn its moldering double doors was a large lead seal. He read: \u00e2\u0080\u009cSurplus\nInformation Repository. Access denied to unauthorized personnel.\u00e2\u0080\u009d But\nthe seal had been forced by somebody; one of the doors swung free,\ncreaking.\n\nRoss invoked the forcer of the door. If _he_ could do it....\n\nHe went in and stumbled over a skeleton, presumably that of the last\nentrant. The skull had been crushed by a falling beam. There was some\nsort of mechanism involved\u00e2\u0080\u0094a trigger, a spring, a release hook. All had\nrusted badly, and the spring had lost its tension over the years. A\ncentury? Two? Five? Ross prayed that any similar mantraps had likewise\nrusted solid, and cautiously inched through the dismal hall of the\nplace, ready for a backward leap at the first whisper of a concealed\nmechanism in action.\n\nIt was unnecessary. The place was\u00e2\u0080\u0094dead.\n\nExploring room after room, he realized slowly that he was stripping off\nhistory in successive layers. The first had been the booby-trapped road,\nlackadaisically planned to ensure that mere inquisitiveness would be\ndiscouraged. There had been no real denial of access, for there was\nalmost no possibility that anybody would care to visit the place.\n\nNext, the seal and the mantraps. An earlier period. Somebody had once\nsaid: \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis episode is closed. This history is determined. We have all\nreached agreement. Only a dangerous or frivolous meddler would seek to\nrake over these dead ashes.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd then, prying into the museum, Ross found the era during which\nagreement had been reached, during which it still was necessary to\ninsist and demonstrate and cajole.\n\nThe outer rooms and open shelves were testimonials to Jones. There were\nbooks of Jonesology\u00e2\u0080\u0094ingenious, persuasive books divided usually into\nthree sections. Human Jonesology would be a painstaking effort to\ndetermine the exact physical and mental tolerances of a Jones.\nAnatomical atlases minutely gave femur lengths, cranial angles, eye\ncolor to an angstrom, hair thickness to a micron. Moral Jonesology\ntreated of the dangers of deviating from these physical and more elastic\nmental specifications. (Here the formula appeared again, repeatedly\ninvoked but never explained. Already it was a truism.) And Sacred\nJonesology was a series of assertions concerning the nature of The Jones\nin whose image all other Joneses were created.\n\nSubdivisions of the open shelves held works on Geographical Jonesology\n(the distribution across the planet of Joneses) and similar works.\n\nRoss went looking for a lower layer of history and found it in a bale of\ncrumbling pamphlets. \u00e2\u0080\u009cComrades, We Must Now Proceed to Consolidate Our\nVictory\u00e2\u0080\u009d; \u00e2\u0080\u009cUltra-Jonesism, An Infantile Political Disorder\u00e2\u0080\u009d; \u00e2\u0080\u009cOn The\nFallacy of \u00e2\u0080\u0098Jonesism In One Country\u00e2\u0080\u0099.\u00e2\u0080\u009d These Ross devoured. They added\nup to the tale of a savage political battle among the victors of a\ngreater war. Clemency was advocated and condemned; extermination of the\nopposition was casually mentioned; the Cultural Faction and the\nBiological Faction had obviously been long locked in a death struggle.\nAcross the face of each pamphlet stood a similar logotype: the formula.\nIt was enigmatically mentioned in one pamphlet, which almost\nincomprehensibly advanced the claims of the Biological faction to\nsupremacy among the Joneses United: \u00e2\u0080\u009cLet us never forget, comrades, that\nthe initiation of the great struggle was not caused by our will or by\nthe will of our sincere and valiant opponents, the Culturists. The\ninexorable law of nature, L_{T}=L_{O}e-^{T\/2N}, was the begetter of that\nholocaust from which our planet has emerged purified\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWas it now?\n\nThe entrance to a musty, airless wing had once been bricked up. The\nmortar was crumbling and a few bricks had fallen. Above the arched\ndoorway a sign said Military Archives. On the floor was a fallen metal\nplaque whose inscription said simply Dead Storage. He kicked the loose\nbricks down and stepped through.\n\nThat was it. The place was lightless, except for the daylight filtering\nthrough the violated archway. Ross hauled maps and orders and period\nnewspapers and military histories and handbooks into the corridor in\narmfuls and spread them on the floor. It took only minutes for him to\nrealize that he had his answer. He ran into the street and shouted for\nthe doctor.\n\nTogether they pored over the papers, occasionally reading aloud choice\nbits, wonderingly.\n\nThe simplest statement of the problem they found was in the paper-backed\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy We Fight\u00e2\u0080\u009d pamphlet issued for the enlisted men of the Provisional\nNorth Continent Government Army.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat is a Jones?\u00e2\u0080\u009d the pamphlet asked rhetorically. \u00e2\u0080\u009cA Jones is just a\nhuman being, the same as you and I. Dismiss rumors that a Jones is\nsupernatural or unkillable with a laugh when you hear them. They arose\nbecause of the extraordinary resemblance of one Jones to another.\nPutting a bullet through one Jones in a skirmish and seeing another one\nrise up and come at you with a bayonet is a chilling experience; in the\nconfusion of battle it may seem that the dead Jones rose and attacked.\nBut this is not the case. Never let the rumor pass unchallenged, and\nnever fail to report habitual rumor-mongers.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHow did the Joneses get that way? Many of you were too young when this\nlong war began to be aware of the facts. Since then, wartime disruption\nof education and normal communications facilities has left you in the\ndark. This is the authoritative statement in simple language that\nexplains why we fight.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThis planet was colonized, presumably from the quasi-legendary planet\nEarth. (The famous Earth Archives Building, incidentally, is supposed to\nderive its puzzling name from this fact.) It is presumed that the number\nof colonists was originally small, probably in the hundreds. Though the\nnumber of human beings on the planet increased enormously as the\ngenerations passed, genetically the population remained small. The same\nones (heredity units) were combined and reshuffled in varying\ncombinations, but no new ones were added. Now, it is a law of genetics\nthat in small populations, variations tend to smooth out and every\nmember of the population tends to become like every other member.\nSo-called unfixed genes are lost as the generations pass; the end\nproduct of this process would theoretically be a population in which\nevery member had exactly the same genes as every other member. This is a\npractical impossibility, but the Joneses whom we fight are a tragic\ndemonstration of the fact that the process need not be pushed to its\nultimate extreme to dislocate the life of a planet and cause endless\nmisery to its dwellers.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cFrom our very earliest records there have been Joneses. It is theorized\nthat this gangling redheaded type was well represented aboard the\noriginal colonizing ship, but some experts believe one Jones type and\nthe workings of chance would be sufficient to produce the unhappy\nsituation of type-dominance.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSome twenty-five years ago Joneses were everywhere among us and not, as\nnow, withdrawn to South Continent and organized into a ruthless\naggressor nation. They made up about thirty per cent of the population\nand had become a closely knit organization devoted to mutual help. They\nheld the balance of political power in every election from the municipal\nto the planetary level and virtually monopolized production and finance.\nThere were fanatics and rabble-rousers among them who readily exploited\na rising tide of discontent over a series of curbing laws, finally\npushed through by a planetary majority, united at last in self-defense\nagainst the rapacity and ruthless self-interest of the Joneses.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Joneses withdrew en masse to South Continent. Some sincerely wished\nthem well; others scoffed at the secession as a sulky and childish\ngesture. Only a handful of citizens guessed the terrible truth, and were\nlaughed at for their pains. Five years after their withdrawal the\nJoneses returned across the Vandemeer Peninsula and the war had begun.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cA final word. There has been much loose talk among the troops about the\nslogan of the Joneses, which goes L_{T}=L_{O}e-^{T\/2N}. Some uninformed\npeople actually believe it is an invocation which gives the Joneses\nsupernatural power and invulnerability. It is not. It is merely an\nancient and well-known formula in genetics which quantitatively\ndescribes the loss of unfixed genes from a population. By mouthing this\nformula, the Joneses are simply expressing in a compact way their\nruthless determination that all genes except theirs shall disappear from\nthe planet and the Joneses alone survive. In the formula L_{T} means the\nnumber of genes after the lapse of T years, L_{O} means the original\nnumber of genes, e means the base of the natural system of logarithms\nand N means number of generations.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe surgeon said slowly and with wonder: \u00e2\u0080\u009cSo _that_ was my God!\u00e2\u0080\u009d He\nstretched out his hands before him. The fingers were rock-steady.\n\nRoss left him and paced the corridor uneasily. Fine. Now he knew. Lost\ngenes in genetically small populations. On Halsey\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Planet, some\nfertility gene, no doubt. On Azor, a male-sex-linked gene that provides\nmen with the backbone required to come out ahead in the incessant war of\nthe genders? Bernie was a gutless character. Here, all too many genes\ndetermining somatotype. On the planets that had dropped out of\ncommunication, who knew? Scientific-thought genes? Sex-drive-determining\ngenes?\n\nOne thing was clear: any gene-loss was bad for the survival of a\nplanetary colony. Evolution had\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0094on Earth\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0094worked out in a billion\ntrial-and-error years a working mechanism, man. Man exhibited a vast\nrange of variation, which was why he survived almost any conceivable\ncatastrophe.\n\nReduce man to a single type and he is certain to succumb, sooner or\nlater, to the inevitable disaster that his one type cannot cope with.\n\nThe problem, now stated clearly, was bigger than he had dreamed. And now\nhe knew only the problem\u00e2\u0080\u0094not the solution.\n\nGo to Earth.\n\nWell, he had tried. There had been no flaw in his calculations, no\nfailure in setting up the Wesley panel. Yet\u00e2\u0080\u0094this was Jones, not Earth;\nthe city was only a city, not the planet that the star charts logged.\nAnd the planet, beyond all other considerations, was less like Earth\nthan any conceivable chart error could account for. Gravitation, wrong;\natmosphere, wrong; flora and fauna, wrong.\n\nSo. Eliminate the impossible, and what remains, however unlikely, is\ntrue. So there had been a flaw in his calculations. And the way to check\nthat, once and for all, was to get back to the starship.\n\nRoss wheeled and went back into the book room. \u00e2\u0080\u009cDoc,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he called, \u00e2\u0080\u009chow do\nwe get out of here?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe answer was: on their bellies. They trudged through the forest for\nhours, skirting the road, hiding whenever a suspicious noise gave\nwarning that someone might be in the vicinity. The Peepeece knew they\nwere in the woods; there was no doubt of that. And as soon as they got\npast the tabu area, they had to crawl.\n\nIt was well past dark before Ross and the doctor, scratched and aching,\ngot to the tiny hamlet of Jonesie-on-the-Pike. By the light from the one\nwindow in the village that gave any signs of life, the doctor took a\nsingle horrified look at Ross and shuddered. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou wait here,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he\nordered. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHide under a bush or something\u00e2\u0080\u0094your beard rubbed off.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nRoss watched the doctor rap on the door and be admitted. He couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\nhear the conversation that followed, but he saw the doctor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hand go to\nhis pocket, then clasp the hand of the figure in the doorway. That was\nthe language all the galaxy understood, Ross realized; he only hoped\nthat the householder was an honest man\u00e2\u0080\u0094i. e., one who would stay bribed,\ninstead of informing the Peepeece on them. It was beyond doubt that\ntheir descriptions had long since been broadcast; the road must have\nbeen lined with TV scanners on the way in.\n\nThe door opened again, and the doctor walked briskly out. He strode out\ninto the street, walked half a dozen paces down the road, and waited for\nRoss to catch up with him. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOkay,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the doctor whispered. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll pick\nus up in half an hour, down the road about a quarter of a mile. Let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\ngo.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat about the man you were talking to?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ross asked. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t he turn us\nin?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe doctor chuckled. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI gave him a drink of Jones\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Juice out of my\nprivate stock,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, he won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t turn anybody in, at least not\nuntil he wakes up.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nRoss nodded invisibly in the dark. He had a thought, and suppressed it.\nBut it wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t stay down. Cautiously he let it seep through his\nsubconscious again, and looked it over from every angle.\n\nNo, there wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t any doubt of it. Things were definitely looking up!\n\n                  *       *       *       *       *\n\nBen Jones roared, \u00e2\u0080\u009cJust what the hell do you think you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re doing, Doc?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe doctor pushed Ross through the doorway and turned to face the other\nJones. He asked mildly, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou heard me!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ben Jones blustered. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI let you out with this one, and\nmaybe I made a mistake at that. But I by-Jones don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t intend to let you\nget out of here with all three of them. What are you trying to get away\nwith anyhow?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe doctor didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t change his mild expression. He took a short, unhurried\nstep forward. _Smack._\n\nBen Jones reeled back from the slap, his mouth open, hand to his face.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHey!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he squawked.\n\nThe doctor said levelly, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m telling you this just one time, Ben.\n_Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t cross me._ You\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got the guns, but I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got these.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He held up\nhis spread hands. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou can shoot me, I won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t deny that. But you can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\nmake me do your dirty work for you. From now on things go my way\u00e2\u0080\u0094with\nthese three people, with my own life, with the bootleg plastic surgery\nwe do to keep you in armored cars. Or else there won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t _be_ any plastic\nsurgery.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBen Jones swallowed, and Ross could see the man fighting himself. He\nsaid after a moment, \u00e2\u0080\u009cNo reason to act sore, Doc. Haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t we always got\nalong? The only thing is, maybe you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t realize how dangerous these\nthree\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cShut up,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the doctor. \u00e2\u0080\u009cRight, boys?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe other two Joneses in the room shuffled and looked uncomfortable. One\nof them said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cDon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get mad, Ben, but it kind of looks as if he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nright. We and the doc had a little talk before you got here. It figures,\nyou have to admit it. He does the work; we ought to let him have\nsomething to say about it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe look that Ben Jones gave him was pure poison, but the man stood up\nto it, and in a minute Ben Jones looked away. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSure,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said distantly.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou go right ahead, Doc. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll talk this over again later on, when\nwe\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve all had a chance to cool off.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe doctor nodded coldly and followed Ross out. Helena and Bernie,\nsuitably Jonesified for the occasion, were already in the car; Ross and\nthe doctor jumped in with them, and they drove away. Now that the strain\nwas relaxed a bit the doctor was panting, but there was a grin on his\nlips. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSon-of-a-Jones,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said happily, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been waiting five years\nfor this day!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nRoss asked, \u00e2\u0080\u009cIs it all right? They won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t chase after us?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, not Ben Jones. He has his own way of handling things. Now if we\nwere stupid enough to go back there, after he had a chance to talk to\nthe others without me around, that would be something different. But we\naren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t going back.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nRoss\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eyes widened. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNot even you, Doc?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cEspecially not me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The doctor concentrated on his driving. Presently:\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIf I take you to the rendezvous, can you find your ship from there?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he\nasked.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSure,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Ross confidently. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd Doc\u00e2\u0080\u0094welcome to our party.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n                  *       *       *       *       *\n\nSpace had never looked better.\n\nThey hung half a million miles off Jones, and Ross fumbled irritatedly\nwith the Wesley panel while the other three stood around and made\nhelpful suggestions. He set up the integrals for Earth just as he had\nset them up once before; the plot came out the same. He transferred the\ncomputations to the controls and checked it against the record in the\nlog. The same. The ship should have gone straight as a five-dimensional\ngeodesic arrow to the planet Earth.\n\nInstead, he found by cross-checking the star atlas, it had gone in\nalmost the other direction entirely, to the planet of Jones.\n\nHe threw his pencil across the room and swore. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he\ncomplained.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s probably broken, Ross,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Helena told him seriously. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou know how\nmachines are. They\u00e2\u0080\u0099re _always_ doing something funny just when you least\nexpect it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nRoss bit down hard on his answer to that. Bernie contributed his morsel,\nand even Dr. Sam Jones, whose race had lost even the memory of\nspaceflight, had a suggestion. Ross swore at them all, then took time to\nswear at the board, at the starship, at Haarland, at Wesley, and most of\nall at himself.\n\nHelena turned her back pointedly. She said to Bernie, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe way Ross acts\nsometimes you\u00e2\u0080\u0099d honestly think he was the _only_ one who\u00e2\u0080\u0099d _ever_ run\nthis thing. Why, my goodness, I _know_ you can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t _rely_ on that silly\nboard! Didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t I have just exactly the same experience with it myself?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nRoss gritted his teeth and doggedly started all over again with the\ncomputations for Earth. Then he did a slow double-take.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHelena,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he whispered. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat experience did you have?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy, just the same as now! Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you _remember_, Ross? When you and\nBernie were in jail and I had to come rescue you?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat happened?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ross shouted.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy goodness, Ross don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t _yell_ at me! There was that silly light\nflashing all the time. It was driving me out of my _mind_. Well, I knew\n_perfectly_ well that I wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t going to get anywhere if it was going to\nact like _that_, so I just\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nRoss, eyes glazed, robotlike, lifted the cover off the main Wesley unit.\nDown at the socket of the alarm signal, shorting out two delicately\nmachined helices that were a basic part of the Wesley drive, wedged\nbetween an eccentric vernier screw and a curious crystalline lattice,\nwas\u00e2\u0080\u0094the hairpin.\n\nHe picked it out and stared at it unbelievingly. He marveled, \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt says\nin the manual, \u00e2\u0080\u0098On no account should any alterations be made in any part\nof the Wesley driving assembly by any technician under a C-Twelve\nrating.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 She didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t like the alarm going off. So she fixed it. With a\nhairpin.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHelena giggled and appealed to Bernie. \u00e2\u0080\u009cDoesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t he _kill_ you?\u00e2\u0080\u009d she\nasked.\n\nRoss\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eyes were glazed and his hands worked convulsively. \u00e2\u0080\u009cKill,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he\nmuttered, advancing on Helena. \u00e2\u0080\u009cKill, kill, kill\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHelp!\u00e2\u0080\u009d she screamed.\n\nThe two men managed to subdue Ross with the aid of a needle from Dr.\nJones\u00e2\u0080\u0099s kit-pocket.\n\nHelena was in tears and tried to explain to the others: \u00e2\u0080\u009cJust for no\nreason at _all_\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe got only icy stares. After a while she sulkily began setting up the\nWesley board for the Earth jump.\n\n\n\n\n..... 12\n\n\nROSS awoke, clearheaded and alert. Helena and Bernie were looking at him\napprehensively.\n\nHe understood and said grudgingly, \u00e2\u0080\u009cSorry I flipped. I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mean to\nscare you. Everything seemed to go black\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThey smothered him with relieved protestations that they understood\nperfectly and Helena wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t stick hairpins into the Wesley Drive ever\nagain. Even if the ship hadn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t blown up. Even if she had rescued the men\nfrom \u00e2\u0080\u009cMinerva.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnyway,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said happily, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re off Earth. At least, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s _supposed_\nto be Earth, according to the charts.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe unkinked himself and studied the planet through a vision screen at\nits highest magnification. The apparent distance was one mile; nothing\nwas hidden from him.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGolly,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, impressed. \u00e2\u0080\u009cScience! Makes you realize what backward\ngropers we were.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nObviously they had it, down there on the pleasant, cloud-flecked, green\nand blue planet. Science! White, towering cities whose spires were laced\nby flying bridges\u00e2\u0080\u0094and inexplicably decorated with something that looked\nlike cooling fins. Huge superstreamlined vehicles lazily coursing the\nroads and skies. Long, linked-pontoon cities slowly heaving on the\nbreasts of the oceans. Science!\n\nRoss said reverently, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re here. Flarney was right. Helena, Bernie,\nDoc\u00e2\u0080\u0094maybe this is the parent planet of us all and maybe it isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t. But\nthe people who built those cities _must_ know all the answers. Helena,\nwill you please land us?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSure, Ross. Shall I look for a spaceport?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nRoss frowned. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOf course. Do you think _these_ people are savages? We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll\ngo in openly and take our problem to them. Besides, imagine the radar\nsetup they must have! We\u00e2\u0080\u0099d never sneak through even if we wanted to.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHelena casually fingered the controls; there was the sickening swoop\ncharacteristic of her ship-handling, several times repeated. As she\njerked them wildly across the planet\u00e2\u0080\u0099s orbit she explained over her\nshoulder, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI had the darnedest time finding a really big spaceport on\nthat little radar thing\u00e2\u0080\u0094oops!\u00e2\u0080\u0094but there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a nice-looking one near that\ncoastal city. Whee! That was close! There was one\u00e2\u0080\u0094sorry, Ross\u00e2\u0080\u0094on a big\nlake inland, but I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t like\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0094Now everybody be very quiet. This is the\nhard part and I have to concentrate.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nRoss hung on.\n\nHelena landed the ship with her usual timber-shivering crash. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNow,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she\nsaid briskly, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwe\u00e2\u0080\u0099d better allow a little time for it to cool down. This\n_is_ nice, isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t it?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nRoss dragged himself, bruised, from the floor. He had to agree. It was\nnice. The landing field, rimmed by gracious, light buildings (with the\ncooling fins), was dotted with great, silvery ships. They didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t, Ross\nthought with a twinge of irritation, seem to be space vessels, though;\nleave it to Helena to get them down at some local airport! Still\u00e2\u0080\u0094the\nships also, he noticed, were liberally studded with the fins. He peered\nat them with puzzlement and a rising sense of excitement. Certainly they\nhad a function, and that function could only be some sort of energy\nreceptor. Could it be\u00e2\u0080\u0094dared he imagine that it was the long-dreamed-of\ncosmic energy tap? What a bonus that would be to bring back with him!\nAnd what other marvels might this polished technology have to give\nthem....\n\nBernie distracted him. He said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cHey, Ross. Here comes somebody.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBut even Bernie\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tone was awed. A magnificent vehicle was crawling\ntoward them across the field. It was long, low, bullet-shaped\u00e2\u0080\u0094and with\ncooling fins. Multiple plates of silvery metal contrasted with a glossy\nblack finish. All about its periphery was a lacy pattern of intricate\ncrumples and crinkles of metal, as though its skirts had been crushed\nand rumpled. Ross sighed and marveled: What a production problem these\npeople had solved, stamping those forms out between dies.\n\nThen he saw the faces of the passengers.\n\nHe drew in his breath sharply. Godlike. Two men whose brows were cliffs\nof alabaster, whose chins were strong with the firmness of steady,\nflamelike wisdom. Two women whose calm, lovely features made the heart\nwithin him melt and course.\n\nThe vehicle stopped ten yards from the open spacelock of the ship. From\nits tip gushed upward a ten-foot fountain of sparks that flashed the\ngamut of the rainbow. Simultaneously one of the godlike passengers\ntouched the wheel, and there was a sweet, piercing, imperative summons\nlike a hundred strings and brasses in unison.\n\nHelena whispered, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey want us to come out. Ross\u00e2\u0080\u0094Ross\u00e2\u0080\u0094I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t face\n_them_!\u00e2\u0080\u009d She buried her face in her hands.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSteady,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said gravely. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey\u00e2\u0080\u0099re only human.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nRoss gripped that belief tightly; he hardly dared permit himself to\nthink, even for a second, that perhaps these people were no longer\nmerely human. Hoarsely he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe need their help. Maybe we should\nsend Doc Jones out first. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the oldest of us, and he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the only one\nyou could call a scientist; he can talk to them. Where is he?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nA raucous Jones voice bellowed through the domed control room: \u00e2\u0080\u009cWho\nwansh ol\u00e2\u0080\u0099 doc, hargh? Who wansh goo\u00e2\u0080\u0099 ol\u00e2\u0080\u0099 doc?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nGood old doc staggered into the room, obviously loaded to the gills by a\nvery enjoyable backslide. He began to sing:\n\n      \u00e2\u0080\u009cIn A. J. seven thirty-two a Jones from Jones\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Valley, He\n      wandered into Jones\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Town to hold a Jonesist Rally. He shocked\n      the gents and ladies both; his talk was most disturbing; He spoke\n      of seven-sided doors and purple-colored curbing\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nJones\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eyes focused on Helena. He flushed. \u00e2\u0080\u009c\u00e2\u0080\u0099m deeply sorry,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he\nmumbled. \u00e2\u0080\u009cUnf\u00e2\u0080\u0099rgivable vulgararrity. Mom\u00e2\u0080\u0099ntarily f\u00e2\u0080\u0099rgot ladies were\npresent.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAgain that sweet summons sounded.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cPull yourself together, doctor,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ross begged. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is Earth. The\npeople seem\u00e2\u0080\u0094very advanced. Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t disgrace us. Please!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nJones\u00e2\u0080\u0099s face went pale and perspiration broke out. \u00e2\u0080\u009c\u00e2\u0080\u0099Scuse me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he\nmumbled, and staggered out again.\n\nRoss closed the door on him and said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll leave him. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be all\nright; nothing\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to happen here.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He took a deep breath. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll\nall go out,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said.\n\nUnconsciously Ross and Helena drew closer together and joined hands.\nThey walked together down the unfolding ramp and approached the vehicle.\n\nOne of the coolly lovely women scrutinized them and turned to the man\nbeside her. She remarked melodiously, \u00e2\u0080\u009cYuhsehtheybebems!\u00e2\u0080\u009d, and laughed a\nsilvery tinkle.\n\nPanic gripped Ross for a long moment. A thing he had never considered,\nbut a thing which he should have realized would be inevitable. Of\ncourse! These folk\u00e2\u0080\u0094older and incomparably more advanced than the rest of\nthe peoples in the universe\u00e2\u0080\u0094would have evolved out of the common\nlanguage into a speech of their own, deliberately or naturally rebuilt\nto handle the speed, subtlety, and power of their thoughts.\n\nBut perhaps the older speech was merely disused and not lost.\n\nHe said formally, quaking: \u00e2\u0080\u009cPeople of Earth, we are strangers from\nanother star. We throw ourselves on your mercy and ask for your\ngenerosity. Our problem is summed up in the genetic law L-sub-T equals\nL-sub-zero e to the minus T-over-two-N. Of course\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nOne of the men was laughing. Ross broke off.\n\nThe man smiled: \u00e2\u0080\u009cWha\u00e2\u0080\u0099s that again?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThey understood! He repeated the formula, slowly, and would have\nexplained further, but the man cut him off.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMath,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the man smiled. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe don\u00e2\u0080\u0099 use that stuff no more. I got a lab\nassistant, maybe he uses it sometimes.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThey were beyond mathematics! They had broken through into some mode of\nsymbolic reasoning that must be as far beyond mathematics as math was\nbeyond primitive languages!\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSir,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said eagerly, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou must be a scientist. May I ask you to\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGet in,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he smiled. Gigantic doors unfolded from the vehicle.\nThought-reading? Had the problem been snatched from his brain even\nbefore he stated it? Mutely he gestured at Helena and Bernie. Jones\nwould be all right where he was for several hours if Ross was any judge\nof blackouts. And you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t quibble with demigods.\n\nThe man, the scientist, did something to a glittering control panel that\nwas, literally, more complex than the Wesley board back on the starship.\nNoise filled the vehicle\u00e2\u0080\u0094noise that Ross identified as music for a\nmoment. It was a starkly simple music whose skeleton was three thumps\nand a crash, three thumps and a crash. Then followed an antiphonal\nchant\u00e2\u0080\u0094a clear tenor demanding in a monotone: \u00e2\u0080\u009cIs this your car?\u00e2\u0080\u009d and a\ntremendous chorally-shouted: \u00e2\u0080\u009cNO!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nToo deep for him, Ross thought forlornly as the car swerved around and\nsped off. His eyes wandered over the control board and fixed on the\nlargest of its dials, where a needle crawled around from a large forty\nto a large fifty and a red sixty, proportional to the velocity of the\nvehicle. Unable to concentrate because of the puzzling music, unable to\nconverse, he wondered what the units of time and space were that gave\nreadings of fifty and sixty for their very low rate of speed\u00e2\u0080\u0094hardly more\nthan a brisk walk, when you noticed the slow passage of objects outside.\nBut there seemed to be a whistle of wind that suggested high\nspeed\u00e2\u0080\u0094perhaps an effect peculiar to the cooling-fin power system,\nhowever it worked. He tried to shout a question at the driver, but it\ndidn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get through. The driver smiled, patted his arm and returned to\nhis driving.\n\nThey nosed past a building\u00e2\u0080\u0094cooling fins\u00e2\u0080\u0094and Ross almost screamed when he\nsaw what was on the other side: a curve of highway jammed solid with\nvehicles that were traveling at blinding speed. And the driver wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\nstopping.\n\nRoss closed his eyes and jammed his feet against the floorboards waiting\nfor the crash which, somehow, didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t come. When he opened his eyes they\nwere in the traffic and the needle on the speedometer quivered at 275.\nHe blew a great breath and thought admiringly: reflexes to match their\nsuperb intellects, of course. There _couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t_ have been a crash.\n\nJust then, across the safety island in the opposing lane, there was a\ncrash.\n\nThe very brief flash of vision Ross was allowed told him, incredibly,\nthat a vehicle had attempted to enter the lane going the wrong way, with\nthe consequences you\u00e2\u0080\u0099d expect. He watched, goggle-eyed, as the effects\nof the crash rippled down the line of oncoming traffic. The squeal of\nbrakes and rending of metal was audible even above the thumping music:\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIs this your car?\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cNO!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThereafter, as they drove, the opposing lane was motionless, but not\nsilent. The piercing blasts of strings and trumpets rose to the heavens\nfrom each vehicle, as did the brilliant pyrotechnic jets. A call for\nhelp, Ross theorized. The music was beginning to make his head ache. It\nhad been going on for at least ten minutes. Suddenly, blessedly, it\nchanged. There was a great fanfare of trombones in major thirds that\nseemed to go on forever, but didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t quite. At the end of forever, the\nsame tenor chanted: \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou got a Roadmeister?\u00e2\u0080\u009d and the chorus roared:\n\u00e2\u0080\u009c_YES!_\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nRoss realized forlornly that the music must contain values and\nsubtleties which his coarser senses and undeveloped esthetic background\ncould not grasp. But he wished it would stop. It was making him miss all\nthe scenery. After perhaps the fifteenth repetition of the Roadmeister\nmotif, it ended; the driver, with a look of deep satisfaction, did\nsomething to the control board that turned off a subsequent voice before\nit could get out more than a syllable.\n\nHe turned to Ross and yelled above the suddenly-noticeable rush of air,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTalk-talk-talk,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and gave a whimsical shrug.\n\nDuring the moment his attention wandered from the road, his vehicle\nrammed the one ahead, decelerated sharply and was rammed by the one\nbehind, accelerated and rammed the one ahead again and then fell back\ninto place.\n\nRoss suddenly realized that he knew what had caused those crumples and\ncrinkles around the periphery of the car.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSubtle,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the driver yelled. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIndirection. Sneak it in.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ross screamed.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe commersh,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the driver yelled.\n\nIt meant nothing to Ross, and he felt miserable because it meant\nnothing. He studied the roadside unhappily and almost beamed when he saw\na sign coming up. Not advertising, of course, he thought. Perhaps some\naustere reminder of a whole man\u00e2\u0080\u0099s duty to the race and himself, some\nnoble phrase that summed up the wisdom of a great thinker....\n\nBut the sign\u00e2\u0080\u0094and it had cooling fins\u00e2\u0080\u0094declared:\n\n                         BE SMUG! SMOKE SMOGS!\n\nAnd the next one urged:\n\n                          BEAT YOUR SISTER\n                          CHEAT YOUR BROTHER\n                          BUT SEND SOME SMOGS\n                          TO DEAR OLD MOTHER.\n\nIt said it on four signs which, apparently alerted by radar, zinged in\nsuccession along a roadside track even with the vehicle.\n\nThere were more. And worse. They were coming to a city.\n\nTurmoil and magnificence! White pylons, natty belts of green, lacy\nbridges, the roaring traffic, nimble-skipping pedestrians waving at the\ncars and calling\u00e2\u0080\u0094greetings? It sounded like \u00e2\u0080\u009cSuvvabih! Suvvabih!\nBassa-bassa!\u00e2\u0080\u009d The shops were packed and radiant, dazzling. Ross wondered\nfleetingly how one parked here, and then found out. A car pulled from\nthe curb and a hundred cars converged on the spot, shrilling their sweet\nmessage and spouting their gay sparkles. Theirs too! There were a pair\nof jolting crashes as it shouldered two other vehicles aside and parked,\ntwo wheels over the curb and on the sidewalk.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSuvvabih-bassa!\u00e2\u0080\u009d shouted drivers, and the man beside Ross gaily\nrepeated the cry. The vehicle\u00e2\u0080\u0099s doors opened and they climbed out into\nthe quick tempo of the street.\n\nIt was loud with a melodious babble from speaker horns visible\neverywhere. The driver yelled cheerfully at Ross: \u00e2\u0080\u009cC\u00e2\u0080\u0099mon. Party.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He\nfollowed, dazed and baffled, assailed by sudden doubts and\ncontradictions.\n\n                  *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was a party, all right\u00e2\u0080\u0094twenty floors up a shimmering building in a\nlarge, handsome room whose principal decorative motif seemed to be\ncooling fins.\n\nPerhaps twenty couples were assembled; they turned and applauded as they\nmade their appearance.\n\nThe vehicle driver, standing grandly at the head of a short flight of\nstairs leading to the room, proclaimed: \u00e2\u0080\u009cI got these rocket flyers like\non the piece of paper you guys read me. Right off the field. Twenny\npoints. How about that?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nA tall, graying man with a noble profile hurried up and beamed: \u00e2\u0080\u009cGood\nshow, Joe. I knew we could count on you to try for the high-point combo.\nYou was always a real sport. You got the fish?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSure we got the fish.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Joe turned and said to one of the lovely ladies,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cElna, show him the fish.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe unwrapped a ten-pound swordfish and proudly held it up while Ross,\nBernie, and Helena stared wildly.\n\nThe profile took the fish and poked it. \u00e2\u0080\u009cReal enough, Joe. You done\ngreat. Now if the rocket flyers here are okay you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re okay. Then you got\ntwenny points and the prize.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou\u00e2\u0080\u0099re a rocket flyer, ain\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you, Buster?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nRoss realized he was being addressed. He croaked: \u00e2\u0080\u009cMen of Earth, we come\nfrom a far-distant star in search of\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe profile said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cJust a minute, Buster. _Just_ a minute. You ain\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\nfrom Earth?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe come from a far-distant star in search of\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cStick to the point, Buster. You ain\u00e2\u0080\u0099t a rocket flyer from Earth? None\nof you?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ross said. He furtively pinched himself. It hurt. Therefore he\nmust be awake. Or crazy.\n\nThe profile was sorrowfully addressing a downcast Joe. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou should of\nasked them, Joe. You really should of. Now you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even get the three\npoints for the swordfish, because you went an\u00e2\u0080\u0099 tried for the combo. It\nreely is a pity. Din\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you ask them at all?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nJoe blustered, \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe did say sump\u00e2\u0080\u0099m, but I figured a rocket flyer was a\nrocket flyer, and they come out of a rocket.\u00e2\u0080\u009d His lower lip was\ntrembling. Both of the ladies of his party were crying openly. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\ntried,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Joe said, and began to blubber. Ross moved away from him in\nhorrified disgust.\n\nThe profile shook its head, turned and announced: \u00e2\u0080\u009cOwing to a\nunfortunate mistake, the search group of Dr. Joseph Mulcahy, Sc.D.,\nPh.D., got disqualified for the combination. They on\u00e2\u0080\u0099y got three points.\nSo that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all the groups in an\u00e2\u0080\u0099 who got the highest?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI got fifteen! I got fifteen!\u00e2\u0080\u009d screamed a gorgeous brunette in a\ntransport of joy. \u00e2\u0080\u009cA manhole cover from the museum an\u00e2\u0080\u0099 a las\u00e2\u0080\u0099 month\n_Lipreaders Digest_ an\u00e2\u0080\u0099 a steering wheel from a police car! I got\nfifteen!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe others clustered about her, chattering. Ross said to the profile\nmechanically: \u00e2\u0080\u009cMan of Earth, we come from a far-distant star in search\nof\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSure, Buster,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the profile. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSure. Too bad. But you should of told\nJoe. You don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have to go. You an\u00e2\u0080\u0099 your friends have a drink. Mix. Have\nfun. I gotta go give the prize now.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He hurried off.\n\nA passing blonde, stacked, said to Ross: \u00e2\u0080\u009cHel-looo, baldy. Wanna see my\noperation?\u00e2\u0080\u009d He began to shake his head and felt Helena\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fingers close\nlike steel on his arm. The blonde sniffed and passed on.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll operate her,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Helena said, and then: \u00e2\u0080\u009cRoss, what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s _wrong_ with\neverybody? They act so young, even the old people!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cFollow me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, and began to circulate through the party, trailing\nBernie and a frankly terrified Helena, button-holing and confronting and\ndemanding and cajoling. Nothing worked. He was greeted with amused\ntolerance and invited to have a drink and asked what he thought of the\nlatest commersh with its tepid trumpets. Nobody gave a damn that he was\nfrom a far-distant star except Joe, who sullenly watched them wander and\nfinally swaggered up to Ross.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI figured something out,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said grimly. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou made me lose.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He\nbrought up a roundhouse right, and Ross saw the stars and heard the\nbirdies.\n\n                  *       *       *       *       *\n\nBernie and Helena brought him to on the street. He found he had been\nwalking for some five minutes with a blanked-out mind. They told him he\nhad been saying over and over again, \u00e2\u0080\u009cMen of Earth, I come from a\nfar-distant star.\u00e2\u0080\u009d It had got them ejected from the party.\n\nHelena was crying with anger and frustration; she had also got a nasty\nscare when one of the vehicles had swerved up onto the sidewalk and\nalmost crushed the three of them against the building wall.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she wailed, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m hungry and we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know where the ship is and\nI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got to sit down and\u00e2\u0080\u0094and go someplace.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSo do I,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Bernie said weakly.\n\nSo did Ross. He said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cLet\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just go into this restaurant. I know we\nhave no money\u00e2\u0080\u0094don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t nag me please, Helena. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll order, eat, not pay,\nand get arrested.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He held up his hand at the protests. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI said, get\narrested. The smartest thing we could do. Obviously somebody\u00e2\u0080\u0099s running\nthis place\u00e2\u0080\u0094and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not the stoops we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen. The quickest way I know\nof to get to whoever\u00e2\u0080\u0099s in charge is to get in trouble. And once they see\nus we can explain everything.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nIt made sense to them. Unfortunately the first restaurant they tried was\ncoin-operated\u00e2\u0080\u0094from the front door on. So were the second to seventh.\nRoss tried to talk Bernie into slugging a pedestrian so they could all\nbe jugged for disturbing the peace, but failed.\n\nHelena noted at last that the women\u00e2\u0080\u0099s wear shops had live attendants\nwho, presumably, would object to trouble. They marched into one of the\ngaudy places, each took a dress from a rack and methodically tore them\nto pieces.\n\nA saleslady approached them dithering and asked tremulously: \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat for\ndid you do that? Din\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you like the dresses?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell yes, very much,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Helena began apologetically. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut you see, the\nfact is\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cShuddup!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ross told her. He said to the saleslady: \u00e2\u0080\u009cNo. We hated them.\nWe hate every dress here. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to tear up every dress in the\nplace. Why don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you call the police?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said vaguely. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAll right,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and vanished into the rear of the\nstore. She returned after a minute and said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe wants to know your\nnames.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cJust say \u00e2\u0080\u0098three desperate strangers,\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ross told her.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh. Thank you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d She vanished again.\n\nThe police arrived in five minutes or so. An excited elder man with many\nstripes on his arms strode up to them excitedly as they stood among the\nshredded ruins of the dresses. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhere\u00e2\u0080\u0099d they go?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he demanded. \u00e2\u0080\u009cDidja\nsee what they looked like?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re them. We three. We tore these dresses up. You\u00e2\u0080\u0099d better take them\nalong for evidence.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the cop said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOkay. Go on into the wagon. And no funny business,\nhear me?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThey offered no funny business. In the wagon Ross expounded on his theme\nthat there must be directing intelligences and that they must be at the\ntop. Helena was horribly depressed because she had never been arrested\nbefore and Bernie was almost jaunty. Something about him suggested that\nhe felt at home in a patrol wagon.\n\nIt stopped and the elderly stripe-wearer opened the door for them. Ross\nlooked on the busy street for anything resembling a station house and\nfound none.\n\nThe cop said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cOkay, you people. Get going. An\u00e2\u0080\u0099 let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have no\ntrouble or I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll run you in.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nRoss yelled in outrage, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is a frame-up! You have no right to turn\nus loose. We demand to be arrested and tried!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWise guy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d sneered the cop, climbed into the wagon and drove off.\n\nThey stood forlornly as the crowd eddied and swirled around them. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere\nwas a plate of sandwiches at that party,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Helena recalled wistfully.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd a ladies\u00e2\u0080\u0099 room.\u00e2\u0080\u009d She began to cry. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf only you hadn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t acted so\ndarn superior, Ross! I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll bet they would have let us have all the\nsandwiches we wanted.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBernie said unexpectedly, \u00e2\u0080\u009cShe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s right. Watch me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe buttonholed a pedestrian and said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cDuh.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYeah?\u00e2\u0080\u009d asked the pedestrian with kindly interest.\n\nBernie concentrated and said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cDuh. I yam losted. I yam broke. I losted\nall my money. Gimme some money, mister, please?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe pedestrian beamed and said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat is real tough luck, buddy. If I\ngive you some money will you send it to me when you get some more? Here\nis my name wrote on a card.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBernie said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cSure, mister. I will send the money to you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThen,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the pedestrian, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI will give you some money because you\nwill send it back to me. Good luck, buddy.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBernie, with quiet pride, showed them a piece of paper that bore the\ninteresting legend Twenty Dollars.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLet\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eat,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ross said, awed.\n\nA machine on a restaurant door changed the bill for a surprising heap of\ncoins and they swaggered in, making beelines for the modest twin doors\nat the rear of the place. Close up the doors were not very modest, but\nafter the initial shock Ross realized that there must be many on this\nplanet who could not read at all. The washroom attendant, for instance,\nwho collected the \u00e2\u0080\u009cdimes\u00e2\u0080\u009d and unlocked the booths. \u00e2\u0080\u009cDime\u00e2\u0080\u009d seemed to be\nhis total vocabulary.\n\nBy comparison the machines in the restaurant proper were intelligent.\nThe three of them ate and ate and ate. Only after coffee did they spare\na thought for Dr. Sam Jones, who should about then be awakening with a\nmurderous hangover aboard the starship.\n\nThinking about him did not mean they could think of anything to do.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s in trouble,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Bernie said. \u00e2\u0080\u009c_We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re_ in trouble. First things\nfirst.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat trouble?\u00e2\u0080\u009d asked Helena brightly. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou got twenty dollars by asking\nfor it and I suppose you can get plenty more. And I think we wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\nhave got thrown out of that party if\u00e2\u0080\u0094ah\u00e2\u0080\u0094_we_ hadn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t gone swaggering\naround talking as if we knew everything. Maybe these people here aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\nvery bright\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nRoss snorted.\n\nHelena went on doggedly, \u00e2\u0080\u009c\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0094not _very_ bright, but they certainly can\ntell when somebody\u00e2\u0080\u0099s brighter than they are. And naturally they don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\nlike it. Would you like it? It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s like a really old person talking to a\nreally young person about nothing but age. But here when you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re bright\nyou make everybody feel bad every time you open your mouth.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSo,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ross said impatiently, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwe can go on begging and drifting. But\nthat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not what we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re here for. The answer is supposed to be on Earth.\nObviously none of the people we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen could possibly know anything\nabout genetics. Obviously they can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t keep this machine civilization\ngoing without guidance. There must be people of normal intelligence\naround. In the government, is my guess.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Helena, but she wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t say why. She just thought not.\n\nThe inconclusive debate ended with them on the street again. Bernie, who\nseemed to enjoy it, begged a hundred dollars. Ross, who didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t, got\neleven dollars in singles and a few threats of violence for acting like\na wise guy. Helena got no money and three indecent proposals before Ross\nindignantly took her out of circulation.\n\nThey found a completely automatic hotel at nightfall. Ross tried to\ninspect Helena\u00e2\u0080\u0099s room for comfort and safety, but was turned back at the\nthreshold by a staggering jolt of electricity. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMechanical house dick,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nhe muttered, picking himself up from the floor. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWell,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said to her\nsourly, \u00e2\u0080\u009cit\u00e2\u0080\u0099s safe. Good night.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd later in the gents\u00e2\u0080\u0099 room, to Bernie: \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou\u00e2\u0080\u0099d think the damn-fool\nmachine could be adjusted so that a person with perfectly innocent\nintentions could visit a lady\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSure,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Bernie soothingly, \u00e2\u0080\u009csure. Say, Ross, frankly, is this Earth\nexactly what you expected it to be?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe attendant moved creakily across the floor and said hopefully,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDime?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\n\n..... 13\n\n\nTHEIR second day on the bum they accumulated a great deal of change and\ncrowded into a telephone booth. The plan was to try to locate their\nstarship and find out what, if anything, could be done for Sam Jones.\n\nAn automatic Central conferred with an automatic Information and decided\nthat they wanted the Captain of the Port, Baltimore Rocket Field.\n\nThey got the Port Captain on the wire and Ross asked after the starship.\nThe captain asked, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWho wan\u00e2\u0080\u0099sta know, huh?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nRoss realized he had overdone it and shoved Bernie at the phone. Bernie\nsnorted and guggled and finally got out that he jus\u00e2\u0080\u0099 wannit ta know. The\ncaptain warmed up immediately and said oh, sure, the funny-lookin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 ship,\nit was still there all right.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHow about the fella that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s in it?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou mean the funny-lookin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 fella? He went someplace.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe went someplace? What place?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSomeplace. He went away, like. I din\u00e2\u0080\u0099t see him go, mister. I got plenty\nto do without I should watch out for every dummy that comes along.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cT\u00e2\u0080\u0099anks,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Bernie hopelessly at Ross\u00e2\u0080\u0099s signal.\n\nThey walked the street, deep in thought. Helena sobbed, \u00e2\u0080\u009cLet\u00e2\u0080\u0099s _leave_\nhim here, Ross. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t like this place.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBernie growled, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the difference, Ross? He can get a snootful just\nas easy here as anywhere else\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo! It isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t the Doc, don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you see? But this is the place we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re\nlooking for. All the answers we need are here; we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got to get them.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBernie stepped around two tussling men on the ground, ineffectually\nthumping each other over a chocolate-covered confection. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYeah,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said\nshortly.\n\n                  *       *       *       *       *\n\nHelena said: \u00e2\u0080\u009cIsn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t that a silly way to put up a big sign like that?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nRoss looked up. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMy God,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. A gigantic metal sign with the\nlegend, _Buy Smogs_\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0094_You Can SMOKE Them_, was being hoisted across the\nstreet ahead. The street was nominally closed to traffic by cheerfully\ninattentive men with red flags; a mobile boom hoist was doing the work,\nand quite obviously doing it wrong. The angle of the boom arm with the\nvertical was far too great for stability; the block-long sign was\ntipping the too-light body of the hoisting engine on its treads....\n\nRoss made a flash calculation: when the sign fell, as fall it inevitably\nwould, perhaps two hundred people who had wandered uncaringly past the\nwarning flags would be under it.\n\nThere was a sudden aura of blue light around the engine body.\n\nIt tipped back to stability. The boom angle decreased, and the engine\ncrawled forward to take up the horizontal difference.\n\nThe blue light went out.\n\nHelena choked and coughed and babbled, \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut Ross, it _couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t_ have\nbecause\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nRoss said: \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s them!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWho?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nExcitedly: \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe people behind all this! The people who built the cities\nand put up the buildings and designed the machines. The people who have\nthe answers! Come on, Bernie. I just seem to antagonize these people\u00e2\u0080\u0094I\nwant you to ask the boom operator what happened.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe boom operator cheerfully explained that nah, it was just somep\u00e2\u0080\u0099n\nthat happened. Nah, nobody did nothin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 to make it happen. It was in case\nif anything went wrong, like. You know?\n\nThey retired and regrouped their forces.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cFoolproof machines,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ross said slowly. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd I mean really _fool_ proof.\nFriends, I was wrong, I admit it; I thought that those buildings and\ncars were something super-special, and they turned out to be just silly\ngimcracks. But not this blue light thing. That boom _had_ to fall.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBernie shrugged rebelliously. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSo what? So they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got some kinds of\nmachines you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have on Halsey\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Planet?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cA different order of machines, Bernie! Believe me, that blue light was\nsomething as far from any safety device I ever heard of as the starships\nare from oxcarts. When we find the people who designed them\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSuppose they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re all dead?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nRoss winced. He said determinedly, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll find them.\u00e2\u0080\u009d They returned to\ntheir begging and were recognized one day by the gray-haired profile of\nthe party. He didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t remember just who they were or where they were from\nor where he had met them, but he enthusiastically invited them to yet\nanother party. He told them he was Hennery Matson, owner of an airline.\n\nRoss asked about accidents and blue lights. Matson jovially said some o\u00e2\u0080\u0099\nhis pilots talked about them things but he din\u00e2\u0080\u0099t bother his head none.\nYa get these planes from the field, see, an\u00e2\u0080\u0099 they got all kinds of\ngadgets on them. Come on to the party!\n\nThey went, because Hennery promised them another guest\u00e2\u0080\u0094Sanford Eisner,\nwho was a wealthy aircraft manufacturer. But he din\u00e2\u0080\u0099t bother his head\nnone either; them rockets was hard to make, you had to feed the\npatterns, like, into the master jigs just so, and, boy!, if you got \u00e2\u0080\u0099em\nin backwards it was a _mess_. Wheredja get the patterns? Look, mister,\nwe _always_ had the patterns, an\u00e2\u0080\u0099 don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t spoil the party, will ya?\n\nThe party was a smasher. They all woke with headaches on Matson\u00e2\u0080\u0099s deep\nliving room rug.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou did fine, Ross,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Helena softly assured him. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNobody would have\nguessed you were any smarter than anybody else here. There wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t a bit\nof trouble.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nRoss seemed to have a hiatus in his memory.\n\nThe importance of the hiatus faded as time passed. There was a general\nmove toward the automatic dispensing bar. It seemed to be regulated by a\ntime clock; no matter what you dialed first thing in the morning, it\nruthlessly poured a double rye with Worcestershire and tabasco and\nplopped a fair imitation of a raw egg into the concoction. It helped!\n\nAlong about noon something clicked in the bar\u00e2\u0080\u0099s innards. Guests long\nsince surfeited with the prairie oysters joyously dialed martinis and\nmanhattans and the day\u00e2\u0080\u0099s serious drinking began.\n\nRoss fuzzily tried to trace the bar\u00e2\u0080\u0099s supply. There were nickel pipes\nthat led Heaven knew where. Some vast depot of fermentation tanks and\nstills? Fed grain and cane by crawling harvest-monsters? Grain and cane\nplanted from seed the harvest-monsters carefully culled from the crop\nfor the plow-and-drag-and-drill-and-fertilize-and-cultivate monsters?\n\nHis head was beginning to ache again. A jovial martini-drinker who had\nsomething to do with a bank\u00e2\u0080\u0094a _bank!_\u00e2\u0080\u0094roared, \u00e2\u0080\u009cHey, fellas! I got a idea\nwhat we can do! Less go on over to _my_ place!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nSo they all went, and that disposed of another day.\n\n                  *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt blended into a dream of irresponsible childhood. When your clothes\ngrew shabby you helped yourself to something that fit from your host of\nthe moment\u00e2\u0080\u0099s wardrobe. When you grew tired of one host you switched to\nanother. They seldom remembered you from day to day, and they never\nasked questions.\n\nTheir sex was uninhibited and most of the women were more or less\npregnant most of the time. They fought and sulked and made up and\ngiggled and drank and ate and slept. All of the men had jobs, and all of\nthem, once in a while, would remember and stagger over to a phone and\nmake a call to an automatic receptionist to find out if everything was\ngoing all right with their jobs. It always was. They loved their\nchildren and tolerated anything from them, except shrewd inquisitiveness\nwhich drew a fast bust in the teeth from the most indulgent daddy or\nadoring mommy. They loved their friends and their guests, as long as\nthey weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t wise guys, and tolerated anything from them\u00e2\u0080\u0094as long as they\nweren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t wise guys.\n\nDid it last a day, a week, a month?\n\nRoss didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know. The only things that were really bothering Ross were,\nfirst, nobody wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t tell him nothin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 about the blue lights and,\nsecond, that Bernie, he was actin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 like a wise guy.\n\nThere came a morning when it ended as it had begun: on somebody\u00e2\u0080\u0099s living\nroom rug with a headache pounding between his eyes. Helena was sobbing\nsoftly, and that wise guy, Bernie, was tugging at him.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLea\u00e2\u0080\u0099 me alone,\u00e2\u0080\u009d ordered Captain Ross without opening his eyes. Wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\nlet a man get his rest. What did he have to bring them along for,\nanyway? Should have left them where he found them, not brought them to\nthis place Earth where they could act like a couple of wise guys and\nkeep getting in his way every time he came close to the blue-light\npeople, the intelligent people, the people with the answers to\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0094to\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\nHe lay there, trying to remember what the question was.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009c\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0094_have_ to get him out of here,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Helena\u00e2\u0080\u0099s voice with a touch of\nhysteria.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009c\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0094go back and get that fellow Haarland,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Bernie\u00e2\u0080\u0099s voice, equally\ntense. Ross contemplated the fragments of conversation he had caught,\nignoring what the two were saying to him. Haarland, he thought fuzzily,\n_that_ wise guy....\n\nBernie had him on his feet. \u00e2\u0080\u009cLeggo,\u00e2\u0080\u009d ordered Ross, but Bernie was\ntenacious. He stumbled along and found himself in the men\u00e2\u0080\u0099s room of the\napartment. The tired-looking attendant appeared from nowhere and Bernie\nsaid something to him. The attendant rummaged in his chest and found\nsomething that Bernie put into a fizzy drink.\n\nRoss sniffed at it suspiciously. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWassit?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he asked.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cPlease, Ross, drink it. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll sober you up. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got to get out of\nhere\u00e2\u0080\u0094we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going nuts, Helena and me. This has been going on for weeks!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNope. Gotta find a blue light,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ross said obstinately, swaying.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut you aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t finding it, Ross. You aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t doing anything except get\ndrunk and pass out and wake up and get drunk. Come on, drink the drink.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nRoss impatiently dashed it to the floor. Bernie sighed. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAll right,\nRoss,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said wearily. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHelena can run the ship; we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re taking off.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGo \u00e2\u0080\u0099head.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGood-by, Ross. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going back to Halsey\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Planet, where you came\nfrom. Maybe Haarland can tell us what to do.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGo \u00e2\u0080\u0099head. _That_ wise guy!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ross sneered.\n\nThe attendant was watching dubiously as Bernie slammed out and Ross\npeered at himself in a mirror. \u00e2\u0080\u009cDime?\u00e2\u0080\u009d the attendant asked in his tired\nvoice. Ross gave him one and went back to the party.\n\nSomehow it was not much fun.\n\nHe shuffled back to the bar. The boilermaker didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t taste too good. He\nset it down and glowered around the room. The party was back in swing\nalready; Helena and Bernie were nowhere in sight. Let them go, then....\n\nHe drank, but only when he reminded himself to. This party had become a\ncostume ball; one of the men lurched out of the room and staggered back\nguffawing. \u00e2\u0080\u009cLooka him!\u00e2\u0080\u009d one of the women shrieked. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe got a woman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hat\non! Horace, you get the craziest kinda ideas!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nRoss glowered. He suddenly realized that, while he wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t exactly sober,\nhe wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t drunk either. Those soreheads, they had to go and spoil the\nparty....\n\nHe began abruptly to get less drunk yet. Back to Halsey\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Planet, they\nsaid? Ask Haarland what to do, they said? Leave him here\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0094?\n\nHe was cold sober.\n\nHe found a telephone. The automatic Central checked the automatic\nInformation and got him the Captain of the Port, Baltimore Rocket Field.\nThe Captain was helpful and sympathetic; caught by the tense note in\nRoss\u00e2\u0080\u0099s voice when he told him who wannit to know, the Captain said,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGee, buddy, if I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d of known I woulda stopped them. Stoled your ship, is\nthat what they done? They could get arrested for that. You could call\nthe cops an\u00e2\u0080\u0099 maybe they could do something\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nRoss didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t bother to explain. He hung up.\n\nThe party was no fun at all. He left it.\n\nRoss walked along the street, hating himself. He couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t hate Helena\nand Bernie; they had done the right thing. It had been his fault, all\nthe way down the line. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099d been acting like a silly child; he\u00e2\u0080\u0099d had a\njob of work to do, and he let himself be sidetracked by a crazy round of\ndrinking and parties.\n\nOf course, he told himself, something had been accomplished. Somebody\nhad built the machines\u00e2\u0080\u0094not the happy morons he had been playing with.\nSomebody had invented whatever it was that flared with blue light and\nrepaired the idiot errors the morons made. Somebody, somewhere.\n\nWhere?\n\nWell, he had some information. All negative. At the parties had been\nsoldiers and politicians and industrialists and clergy and entertainers\nand, heaven save the mark, scientists. And none of them had had the wit\nto do more than push the Number Three Button when the Green Light A\nblinked, by rote. None of them could have given him the answer to the\nquestion that threatened to end human domination over the cosmos; none\nof them would have known what the words meant.\n\nMaybe\u00e2\u0080\u0094Ross made himself face it\u00e2\u0080\u0094maybe there was no answer. Maybe even if\nhe found the intellects that lurked beneath the surface on this ancient\nplanet, they could not or would not tell him what he wanted to know.\nMaybe the intellects didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t exist.\n\nMaybe he was all wrong in all of his assumptions; maybe he was wasting\nhis time. But, he told himself wryly, he had fixed it for himself that\ntime was all he had left. He might as well waste it. He might as well go\nright on looking....\n\nA migrant party was staggering down the street toward him, a score of\npersons going from one host\u00e2\u0080\u0099s home to another. He crossed to avoid them.\nThey were singing drunkenly.\n\nRoss looked at them with the distaste of the recently reformed. One of\nthe voices raised in song caught his ear:\n\n      \u00e2\u0080\u009c\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0094bobbed his nose and dyed it rose, and kissed his lady fair, And\n      sat her down on a cushion brown in a seven-legged chair. \u00e2\u0080\u0098By\n      Jones,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he said, \u00e2\u0080\u0098my shoes are red, and so\u00e2\u0080\u0099s my overcoat, And with\n      buttons nine in a zigzag line, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDoc!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ross bellowed. \u00e2\u0080\u009cDoc Jones! For God\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sake, come over here!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThey got rid of the rest of Doctor Sam Jones\u00e2\u0080\u0099s party, and Ross sobered\nthe doctor up in an all-night restaurant. It wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t hard; the doctor had\nhad plenty of practice.\n\nRoss filled him in, carefully explaining why Bernie and Helena had left\nhim. Doc Jones filled Ross in. He didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have much to tell. He had come\nto in the ship, waited around until he got hungry, fallen into a\nconversation with a rocket pilot on the field\u00e2\u0080\u0094and that was how _his_\nround of parties had begun.\n\nLike Ross, Doc, in his soberer moments, had come to the conclusion that\nEarth was run by person or persons unseen. He had learned little that\nRoss hadn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t found out or deduced. The blue lights had bothered him, too;\nhe\u00e2\u0080\u0099d asked the pilot about it, and found out about what Ross had\u00e2\u0080\u0094there\nappeared to be some sort of built-in safety device which kept the\ninevitable accidents from becoming unduly fatal. How they worked, he\ndidn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\nBut he had an idea.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt sounds a little ridiculous, I admit,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, embarrassed. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut I\nthink it might work. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a radio program.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cA radio program?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI said it sounded ridiculous. They call it, \u00e2\u0080\u0098What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Biting You,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 and\none of the fellows was telling me about it. It seems that you can appear\nbefore the panel on the program with any sort of problem, any sort at\nall, and they guarantee to solve it for you. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s some sort of bond\nposted\u00e2\u0080\u0094I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know much about the details, but this man assured me that\nthe bond was only a formality; they never failed. Of course,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Doc\nfinished, hearing his own proposal with a touch of doubt, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know\nwhether they ever had any problem like this before, but\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYeah,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Ross. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat have we got to lose?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThey got into the program. It took the techniques of a doubler on an\narmy chow line and a fair amount of brute strength, but they got to the\nhead of the queue at the studio and wedged themselves inside. Doc came\nclose to throttling the man who prowled through the studio audience,\nselecting the lucky few who would get on stage\u00e2\u0080\u0094but they got on.\n\nThe theme music swelled majestically around them, and a chorus crooned,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Biting You\u00e2\u0080\u0094Hunh?\u00e2\u0080\u009d It was repeated three times, with crashing\ncymbals under the \u00e2\u0080\u009cHunh?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nRoss listened to the beginning of the program and cursed himself for\nbeing persuaded into such a harebrained tactic. But, he had to admit,\nthe program offered the only possibility in sight. The central figure\nwas a huge, jovially grinning figure of papier-m\u00c3\u00a2ch\u00c3\u00a9, smoking a Smog and\nbillowing smoke rings at the audience. An announcer, for some obscure\nreason in blackface, interviewed the disturbed derelicts who came before\nSmiley Smog, the papier-m\u00c3\u00a2ch\u00c3\u00a9 figure, and propounded their problems to\nSmiley in a sort of doggerel. And in doggerel the answers came back.\n\nThe first person to go up before Smiley was a woman, clearly in her last\nmonth of pregnancy. The announcer introduced her to the audience and\nbegged for a real loud holler of hello for this poor mizzuble li\u00e2\u0080\u0099l girl.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAwright, honey,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou just step right up here an\u00e2\u0080\u0099 let ol\u00e2\u0080\u0099\nUncle Smiley take care of your troubles for you. Less go, now. What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nBitin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 You?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cUh,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she sobbed, \u00e2\u0080\u009cit\u00e2\u0080\u0099s like I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m gonna have a baby.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHoddya like that!\u00e2\u0080\u009d the announcer screamed. \u00e2\u0080\u009cShe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s gonna have a _baby!_\nWhaddya say to that, folks?\u00e2\u0080\u009d The audience shrieked hysterically.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAwright, honey,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the announcer said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSo you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re gonna have a baby, so\nwhat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s bitin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 you about that?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s my husband,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the woman sniffled. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t like kids. We got eight\nalready,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she explained. \u00e2\u0080\u009cJack, he says if we have one more kid he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\ngonna take off an\u00e2\u0080\u0099 marry somebody else.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s gonna marry somebody else!\u00e2\u0080\u009d the announcer howled. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHoddya like\nthat, folks?\u00e2\u0080\u009d There was a tempest of boos. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAwright, now,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the announcer\nsaid, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou just sit there, honey, while I tell ol\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Uncle Smiley about\nthis. Ya ready? Listen:\n\n               \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s bitin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 this lady is plain to see:\n                Her husband don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want no more family!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe huge figure\u00e2\u0080\u0099s head rotated on a concealed hinge to look down on the\nwoman. From a squawk-box deep in Smiley\u00e2\u0080\u0099s papier-m\u00c3\u00a2ch\u00c3\u00a9 belly, a weary\nvoice declaimed:\n\n               \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf one more baby is your husband\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dread,\n                Cross him up, lady. Have twins instead!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe audience roared its approval. The announcer asked anxiously, \u00e2\u0080\u009cYa get\nit? When ya get inta the hospital, like, ya jus\u00e2\u0080\u0099 tell the nurse ya want\nto take _two_ kids home with you. See?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe grateful woman staggered away. Ross gave Doc a poisonous look.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat else is there to do?\u00e2\u0080\u009d the doctor hissed. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAll right, perhaps this\nwon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t work out\u00e2\u0080\u0094but let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s try!\u00e2\u0080\u009d He half rose, and staggered against the\nman next to him, who was already starting toward the announcer. \u00e2\u0080\u009cGo on,\nRoss,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Doc hissed venomously, blocking off the other man.\n\nRoss went. What else was there to do?\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s biting me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said belligerently before the announcer could put\nhim through the preliminaries, \u00e2\u0080\u009cis simply this: L-sub-T equals\nL-sub-zero e to the minus-T-over-two-N.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nDead silence in the studio. The announcer quavered, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWh-what was that\nagain, buddy?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI said,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ross repeated firmly, \u00e2\u0080\u009cL-sub-T equals L-sub-zero e to the\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNow, wait a minute, buddy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the announcer ordered. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe never had no\nstuff like that on _this_ program before. Whaddya, some kind of a wise\nguy?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThere might have been violence; the conditions were right for it. But\nUncle Smiley Smog saved the day.\n\nThe papier-m\u00c3\u00a2ch\u00c3\u00a9 figure puffed a blinding series of smoke rings at Ross.\nFrom its molded torso, the weary voice said:\n\n         \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re looking for counsel sagacious and wise,\n          The price is ten cents. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s right under your eyes.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThey left the studio in a storm of animosity.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMaybe we could have collected the forfeit,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Doc said hopefully.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMaybe we could have collected some lumps,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ross growled. \u00e2\u0080\u009cGot any more\nideas?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe doctor sipped his coffee. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNo,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he admitted. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI wonder\u00e2\u0080\u0094No, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\nsuppose that means anything.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat jingle? Sure it means something, Doc. It means I should have had\nmy head examined for letting you talk me into that performance.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe doctor said rebelliously, \u00e2\u0080\u009cMaybe I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m wrong, Ross, but I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t see\nthat you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve had any ideas than panned out much better.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nRoss got up. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAll right,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he admitted. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m sorry if I gave you a hard\ntime. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all this coffee and all the liquor underneath it; I swear, if\nI ever get back to a civilized planet I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m going on a solid diet for a\nmonth.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThey headed for the room marked \u00e2\u0080\u009cGents,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ross sullenly quiet, Doc\nthoughtfully quiet.\n\nDoc said reflectively, \u00e2\u0080\u009c\u00e2\u0080\u0098The price is ten cents.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Ross, could that mean\na paper that we could buy on a newsstand, maybe?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYeah,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ross said in irritation. \u00e2\u0080\u009cLook, Doc, don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t give it another\nthought. There must be some way to straighten this thing out; I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll think\nof it. Let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just make believe that whole asinine radio program never\nhappened.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The attendant materialized and offered Ross a towel.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDime?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said wearily.\n\nRoss fished absently in his pocket. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe thing that bothers me, Doc,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he\nsaid, \u00e2\u0080\u009cis that I know there are intelligent people somewhere around. I\neven know what they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re doing, I bet. They\u00e2\u0080\u0099re doing exactly what I tried\nto do: acted as stupid as anybody else, or stupider. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d make a guess,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nhe said, warming up, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat if we could just make a statistical analysis\nof the whole planet and find the absolute stupidest-seeming people of\nthe lot, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099d\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe ran out of breath all at once. His eyes bulged.\n\nHe looked at the men\u00e2\u0080\u0099s-room attendant, and at the ten-cent piece in his\nown hand.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he breathed.\n\nThe attendant\u00e2\u0080\u0099s face suddenly seemed to come to life. In a voice that\nwas abruptly richer and deeper than before, the man said: \u00e2\u0080\u009cYes. You had\nto find us yourself, you know.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\n\n..... 14\n\n\nTHERE was a home base, a gigantic island called Australia, to which they\ntook Ross and Doc Jones in a little car that sprouted no wings and\nflashed no rockets, but flew.\n\nThey lived underground there, invisible to goggling passengers and\ncrewmen aboard the \u00e2\u0080\u009crockets.\u00e2\u0080\u009d (They weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t rockets. They were\nturbo-jets. But it made the children happy to think that they had\nrockets, so iron filings were added to the hot jet stream, and they\nsparkled in magnificent display.)\n\nThere they were born, and there they spent strange childhoods, learning\nsuch things as psychodynamics and teleportation. By the time they were\neight months or so old they thought it amusing to converse of Self and\nthe Meaning of Meaning. By eighteen months a dozen infants would chat in\n_terza rima_. But by the age of two they had put such toys behind them\nwith a sigh of pleasant regret. They would revert to them only for such\npurposes as love-making or choral funeral addresses.\n\nThey were then of an age to begin their work.\n\nThey were born there, and trained there for terrible tasks. And they\ndied there, at whatever risk. For that they would not surrender: their\nright to die among their own.\n\nBut their lives between cradle and grave, those they gave away.\n\nNursemaids? What else can one call them?\n\nThey explained it patiently to Ross and the doctor.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe pattern emerged clearly in the twentieth century. Swarming slums\nabrawl with children, children, children everywhere. Walk down a Chicago\nSouthside street, and walk away with the dazed impression that all the\nworld was pregnant. Walk through pretty, pleasant Evanston, and find the\nimpression wrong. Those who lived in Evanston were reasonable people.\nThey waited and thought. Being reasonable, they saved and planned. Being\nreasonable, they resorted to gadgets or chemicals or continence.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cA woman of the period had some three hundred and ninety opportunities\nto conceive a child. In the slums and the hills they took advantage of\nas many of them as they might. But around the universities, in the\nneighborhoods of the well-educated and the well-to-do, what was the\nscore?\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cFirst, education, until the age of twenty. This left two hundred and\nninety-nine opportunities. Then, for perhaps five years, shared work;\nthe car, the mortgage, the furniture, that two salaries would pay off\nearlier than one. Two hundred and thirty-four opportunities were left.\nSome of them were seized: a spate of childbearing perhaps would come\nnext. But subtract a good ten years more at the end of the cycle, for\nthe years when a child would be simply too, late\u00e2\u0080\u0094too late for fashion,\ntoo late for companionship with the first-born. We started with three\nhundred and ninety opportunities. We have, perhaps, one hundred and\nforty-four left.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIs that the roster complete? No. There is the battle of the budget: No,\nnot right now, not until the summer place is paid for. And more. The\nvisits from the mothers-in-law, the quarterly tax payments, the\ncountry-club liaisons and the furtive knives behind the brownstone\nfronts and what becomes of fertility\u00e2\u0080\u0094they have all been charted. But\nthese are superfluous. The ratio 390:144 points out the inevitable. As\nthree hundred and ninety outweighs one hundred and forty-four, so the\ngenes of the slovenly and heedless outweigh the thoughtful and slow to\nact.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe tampered with the inevitable.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe planet teemed and burst. The starships went forth. The strong,\nbright, quick ones went out in the ships. Two sorts were left: The\nstrong ones who were not bright, the bright ones who were not strong.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe are the prisoners of the planet. We cannot leave.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe children\u00e2\u0080\u0094the witless ones outside\u00e2\u0080\u0094can leave. But who would have\nthem?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nRoss peered into the shifting shadows. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou are the\nmasters of the planet\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009c_Masters?_ We are slaves! Fully alive only here where we are born and\ndie. Abstracted and as witless as they when we are among _them_\u00e2\u0080\u0094well we\nmight be. For each of us, square miles to stand guard over. Our minds\nroving across the traps we dare not ignore, ready to leap out and\nstraighten these children\u00e2\u0080\u0099s toppling walls of blocks, ready to warn the\nchild that sharp things cut and hot things burn. The blue lights\u00e2\u0080\u0094did you\nthink they were machines?\u00e2\u0080\u009d They were _us_!\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou\u00e2\u0080\u0099re torturing yourselves!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ross exploded. \u00e2\u0080\u009cLet them die.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLet\u00e2\u0080\u0094ten\u00e2\u0080\u0094billion\u00e2\u0080\u0094children\u00e2\u0080\u0094die? We are not such monsters.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nRoss was humbled before their tragedy. Diffidently he spoke of Halsey\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nPlanet, Ragansworld, Azor, Jones. He warmed to the task and was growing,\nhe thought, eloquent when their smiles left him standing ashamed.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t understand,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, almost weeping.\n\nThe voice corrected him: \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou do. But you do not\u00e2\u0080\u0094yet\u00e2\u0080\u0094know that you do.\nConsider the facts:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYour planet. Sterile and slowly dying.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe planets you have seen. One sterile because it is imprisoned by\nancients, one sterile under an in-driven matriarchal custom, one sterile\nbecause all traces of divergence have been wiped out.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cEarth. Split into an incurable dichotomy\u00e2\u0080\u0094the sterility of brainless\nhealth, the sterility of sick intellect.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHumanity, then, imprisoned in a thousand sterile tubes, cut off each\nfrom the other, dying. We feared war, and so we isolated the members\nwith a wall of time. We have found something worse to fear. What if the\nwalls are cracked?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCrack the walls? How? Is it too late?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nSomehow the image of Helena was before him.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIs it too late?\u00e2\u0080\u009d they gently mocked. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSurely you know. How? Perhaps you\nwill ask her.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe image of Helena was blushing.\n\nRoss\u00e2\u0080\u0099s heart leaped. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAs simple as that?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cFor you, yes. For others there will be lives spent over the lathes and\nmilling machines, eyes gone blind in calculating and refining\ntrajectories, daring ones lost screaming in the hearts of stars, or\ngibbering with hunger and pain as the final madness closes down on them,\nstranded between galaxies. There will be martyrs to undergo the worst\nmartyrdom of all\u00e2\u0080\u0094which is to say, they will never know of it. They will\nbe unhappy traders and stock-chasers, grinding their lives to smooth\ndull blanks against the wearying routine so that the daring ones may go\nforth to the stars. But for you\u00e2\u0080\u0094you have seen the answer.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOld blood runs thin. Thin blood runs cold. Cold blood dies. Let the\nwalls crack.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThere was a murmuring in the shadows that Ross could not hear. Then the\nvoice again, saying a sort of good-by.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe have had a great deal of experience with children, so we know that\nthey must not be told too much. There is nothing more you need be told.\nYou will go back now\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nRoss dared interrupt. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut our ship\u00e2\u0080\u0094the others have taken it away\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAgain the soundless laughter. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe ship has not been taken far. Did you\nthink we would leave you stranded here?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nRoss peered hard into the shadows. But only the shadows were there, and\nthen he and Jones were in the shadows no longer.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cRoss!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Helena was hysterical with joy. Even Bernie was stammering and\nshaking his head incredulously. \u00e2\u0080\u009cRoss, dearest! We thought\u00e2\u0080\u0094And the ship\nacted all _funny_, and then it landed here and there just wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t anybody\naround, and I couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t make it go again\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt will go now,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ross promised. It did. They sealed ship; he took the\ncontrols; and they hung in space, looking back on a blue-green planet\nwith a single moon.\n\nThere were questions; but Ross put an end to questions. He said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re\ngoing back to Halsey\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Planet. Haarland wanted an answer. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve found\nit; we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll bring it to him. The F-T-L families have kept their secret too\nwell. No wars between the planets\u00e2\u0080\u0094but stagnation worse than wars. And\nHaarland\u00e2\u0080\u0099s answer is this: He will be the first of the F-T-L traders.\nHe\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll build F-T-L ships, and he\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll carelessly let their secrets be\nstolen. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll bridge the galaxy with F-T-L transports; and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll pack\nthe ships with a galaxy of crews! New genes for old; hybrid vigor for\ndreary decay!\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDo you see it?\u00e2\u0080\u009d His voice was ringing loud; Helena\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eyes on him were\nadoring. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMate Jones to Azor, Halsey\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Planet to Earth. Smash the\nsmooth, declining curve! Cross the strains, and then breed them back.\nLet mankind become genetically wild again instead of rabbits isolated in\ntheir sterile hutches!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nExultantly he set up the combinations for Halsey\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Planet on the Wesley\nboard.\n\nHelena was beside him, proud and close, as he threw in the drive.\n\n\n\n\n                           ABOUT THE AUTHORS\n\n\nTHE SPACE MERCHANTS was not only one of the best-reviewed\nscience-fiction novels in 1953, it was one of the most widely reviewed.\nFavorable notices appeared in journals ranging from _Printer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Ink_ to\nscience-fiction magazines, from _Tide_ magazine to the great national\ndailies. That novel firmly established Messrs. Pohl and Kornbluth as a\nteam, although they had collaborated before under pen names and had\nestablished reputations singly. Their new novel, SEARCH THE SKY, has the\nsame wit, the same passages of genuinely beautiful writing and\u00e2\u0080\u0094what is\nmost important and most characteristic\u00e2\u0080\u0094the same underlying concern for\nhuman beings, whether they are on future Madison Avenues or in the outer\ngalaxies.\n\nThis is Mr. Kornbluth\u00e2\u0080\u0099s seventh published novel. Two were written in\ncollaboration with Judith Merril under the pen name \u00e2\u0080\u009cCyril Judd\u00e2\u0080\u009d; one\nwas the notable TAKEOFF (Doubleday, 1952); one was not science fiction;\none was his last collaborative effort with Mr. Pohl; and his most recent\nwas THE SYNDIC (Doubleday, 1953). Mr. Kornbluth, still under thirty, now\nlives in an upstate New York farmhouse with his wife and child where he\ndevotes himself to writing.\n\nThis is Mr. Pohl\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sixth published book. Two of them were reprint\ncollections which he edited and two others were the now-celebrated first\nand second volumes of STAR SCIENCE FICTION STORIES, collections of new\nstories published by Ballantine Books. At 34, Mr. Pohl lives in a large\nold house on the Jersey shore\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009cfive rooms for me, four for my wife and\ntwo apiece for the children.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He has three more books forthcoming in\n1953: two anthologies and his first solo novel.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n                           TRANSCRIBER\u00e2\u0080\u0099S NOTE\n\n\nRepeated instances of the title in the front of the book have been\nreduced.\n\nPunctuation has been normalized.

It\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\nfrom people in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\ngenerations.

The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org\/donate\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org\/donate\n\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\nvolunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\nedition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n\n","id":1360,"split":"test"}
