Ramona is referred to as illegitimate in some summaries of the novel, but chapter 3 of the novel says that Ramona's parents were married by a priest in the San Gabriel Mission. Se\u00f1ora Moreno has raised Ramona as part of the family, giving her every luxury, but only because Ramona's foster mother had requested it as her dying wish. Because of Ramona's mixed Native American heritage, Moreno does not love her. That love is reserved for her only child, Felipe Moreno, whom she adores. Se\u00f1ora Moreno considers herself a Mexican, although California has recently been taken over by the United States. She hates the Americans, who have cut up her huge rancho after disputing her claim to it.\nSe\u00f1ora Moreno delays the sheep shearing, a major event on the rancho, awaiting the arrival of a group of Native Americans from Temecula whom she always hires for that work. She is also awaiting a priest, Father Salvierderra, from Santa Barbara. She arranges for the priest so that the Native American workers can worship and make confession in her chapel, rather than leaving the rancho. Ramona falls in love with Alessandro, a young Native American sheepherder and the son of Pablo Assis, the chief of the tribe. Se\u00f1ora Moreno is outraged, because although Ramona is half-Native American, the Se\u00f1ora does not want her to marry a Native American. Ramona realizes that Se\u00f1ora Moreno has never loved her and she and Alessandro elope.\nAlessandro and Ramona have a daughter, and travel around Southern California trying to find a place to settle. In the aftermath of the war, Alessandro's tribe was driven off their land, marking the beginning of European-American settlement in California. They endure misery and hardship, for the Americans who buy their land also demand their houses and their farm tools. Greedy Americans drive them off from several homesteads, and they cannot find a permanent community that is not threatened by encroachment of United States settlers. They finally move up into the San Bernardino Mountains. Alessandro slowly loses his mind, due to the constant humiliation. He loves Ramona fiercely, and regrets having taken her away from relative comfort in return for \"bootless\" wandering. Their daughter \"Eyes of the Sky\" dies because a white doctor would not go to their homestead to treat her. They have another daughter, named Ramona, but Alessandro still suffers. One day he rides off with the horse of an American, who follows him and shoots him, although he knew that Alessandro was mentally unbalanced.\nRamona was missing from the rancho for two years. Felipe Moreno finds the widowed Ramona and they go back to Se\u00f1ora Moreno's estate with Ramona's child. Felipe has always loved her and finds her more beautiful than ever. Although Ramona still loves Alessandro, she marries Felipe and they have several more children together, although Ramona and Alessandro's daughter always remains their favorite.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg EBook of Ramona, by Helen Hunt Jackson\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

The Fates had seemed to combine to\nput it off. In the first place, Felipe Moreno had been ill. He was the\nSenora's eldest son, and since his father's death had been at the head\nof his mother's house. Without him, nothing could be done on the ranch,\nthe Senora thought. It had been always, \"Ask Senor Felipe,\" \"Go to Senor\nFelipe,\" \"Senor Felipe will attend to it,\" ever since Felipe had had the\ndawning of a beard on his handsome face.\n\nIn truth, it was not Felipe, but the Senora, who really decided all\nquestions from greatest to least, and managed everything on the place,\nfrom the sheep-pastures to the artichoke-patch; but nobody except the\nSenora herself knew this. An exceedingly clever woman for her day and\ngeneration was Senora Gonzaga Moreno,--as for that matter, exceedingly\nclever for any day and generation; but exceptionally clever for the day\nand generation to which she belonged. Her life, the mere surface of it,\nif it had been written, would have made a romance, to grow hot and\ncold over: sixty years of the best of old Spain, and the wildest of New\nSpain, Bay of Biscay, Gulf of Mexico, Pacific Ocean,--the waves of them\nall had tossed destinies for the Senora. The Holy Catholic Church had\nhad its arms round her from first to last; and that was what had brought\nher safe through, she would have said, if she had ever said anything\nabout herself, which she never did,--one of her many wisdoms. So quiet,\nso reserved, so gentle an exterior never was known to veil such an\nimperious and passionate nature, brimful of storm, always passing\nthrough stress; never thwarted, except at peril of those who did it;\nadored and hated by turns, and each at the hottest. A tremendous force,\nwherever she appeared, was Senora Moreno; but no stranger would suspect\nit, to see her gliding about, in her scanty black gown, with her rosary\nhanging at her side, her soft dark eyes cast down, and an expression of\nmingled melancholy and devotion on her face. She looked simply like a\nsad, spiritual-minded old lady, amiable and indolent, like her race, but\nsweeter and more thoughtful than their wont. Her voice heightened this\nmistaken impression. She was never heard to speak either loud or fast.\nThere was at times even a curious hesitancy in her speech, which came\nnear being a stammer, or suggested the measured care with which people\nspeak who have been cured of stammering. It made her often appear as if\nshe did not known her own mind; at which people sometimes took heart;\nwhen, if they had only known the truth, they would have known that the\nspeech hesitated solely because the Senora knew her mind so exactly that\nshe was finding it hard to make the words convey it as she desired, or\nin a way to best attain her ends.\n\nAbout this very sheep-shearing there had been, between her and the head\nshepherd, Juan Canito, called Juan Can for short, and to distinguish him\nfrom Juan Jose, the upper herdsman of the cattle, some discussions which\nwould have been hot and angry ones in any other hands than the Senora's.\n\nJuan Canito wanted the shearing to begin, even though Senor Felipe were\nill in bed, and though that lazy shepherd Luigo had not yet got back\nwith the flock that had been driven up the coast for pasture.\n\"There were plenty of sheep on the place to begin with,\" he said one\nmorning,--\"at least a thousand;\" and by the time they were done, Luigo\nwould surely be back with the rest; and as for Senor Felipe's being in\nbed, had not he, Juan Canito, stood at the packing-bag, and handled the\nwool, when Senor Felipe was a boy? Why could he not do it again? The\nSenora did not realize how time was going; there would be no shearers\nto be hired presently, since the Senora was determined to have none\nbut Indians. Of course, if she would employ Mexicans, as all the other\nranches in the valley did, it would be different; but she was resolved\nupon having Indians,--\"God knows why,\" he interpolated surlily, under\nhis breath.\n\n\"I do not quite understand you, Juan,\" interrupted Senora Moreno at the\nprecise instant the last syllable of this disrespectful ejaculation had\nescaped Juan's lips; \"speak a little louder. I fear I am growing deaf in\nmy old age.\"\n\nWhat gentle, suave, courteous tones! and the calm dark eyes rested on\nJuan Canito with a look to the fathoming of which he was as unequal\nas one of his own sheep would have been. He could not have told why he\ninstantly and involuntarily said, \"Beg your pardon, Senora.\"\n\n\"Oh, you need not ask my pardon, Juan,\" the Senora replied with\nexquisite gentleness; \"it is not you who are to blame, if I am deaf. I\nhave fancied for a year I did not hear quite as well as I once did.\nBut about the Indians, Juan; did not Senor Felipe tell you that he\nhad positively engaged the same band of shearers we had last autumn,\nAlessandro's band from Temecula? They will wait until we are ready for\nthem. Senor Felipe will send a messenger for them. He thinks them the\nbest shearers in the country. He will be well enough in a week or two,\nhe thinks, and the poor sheep must bear their loads a few days longer.\nAre they looking well, do you think, Juan? Will the crop be a good one?\nGeneral Moreno used to say that you could reckon up the wool-crop to a\npound, while it was on the sheep's backs.\"\n\n\"Yes, Senora,\" answered the mollified Juan; \"the poor beasts look\nwonderfully well considering the scant feed they have had all winter.\nWe'll not come many pounds short of our last year's crop, if any.\nThough, to be sure, there is no telling in what case that--Luigo will\nbring his flock back.\"\n\nThe Senora smiled, in spite of herself, at the pause and gulp with which\nJuan had filled in the hiatus where he had longed to set a contemptuous\nepithet before Luigo's name.\n\nThis was another of the instances where the Senora's will and Juan\nCanito's had clashed and he did not dream of it, having set it all down\nas usual to the score of young Senor Felipe.\n\nEncouraged by the Senora's smile, Juan proceeded: \"Senor Felipe can see\nno fault in Luigo, because they were boys together; but I can tell him,\nhe will rue it, one of these mornings, when he finds a flock of sheep\nworse than dead on his hands, and no thanks to anybody but Luigo. While\nI can have him under my eye, here in the valley, it is all very well;\nbut he is no more fit to take responsibility of a flock, than one of\nthe very lambs themselves. He'll drive them off their feet one day, and\nstarve them the next; and I've known him to forget to give them water.\nWhen he's in his dreams, the Virgin only knows what he won't do.\"\n\nDuring this brief and almost unprecedented outburst of Juan's the\nSenora's countenance had been slowly growing stern. Juan had not seen\nit. His eyes had been turned away from her, looking down into the\nupturned eager face of his favorite collie, who was leaping and\ngambolling and barking at his feet.\n\n\"Down, Capitan, down!\" he said in a fond tone, gently repulsing him;\n\"thou makest such a noise the Senora can hear nothing but thy voice.\"\n\n\"I heard only too distinctly, Juan Canito,\" said the Senora in a sweet\nbut icy tone. \"It is not well for one servant to backbite another.\nIt gives me great grief to hear such words; and I hope when Father\nSalvierderra comes, next month, you will not forget to confess this sin\nof which you have been guilty in thus seeking to injure a fellow-being.\nIf Senor Felipe listens to you, the poor boy Luigo will be cast out\nhomeless on the world some day; and what sort of a deed would that be,\nJuan Canito, for one Christian to do to another? I fear the Father will\ngive you penance, when he hears what you have said.\"\n\n\"Senora, it is not to harm the lad,\" Juan began, every fibre of his\nfaithful frame thrilling with a sense of the injustice of her reproach.\n\nBut the Senora had turned her back. Evidently she would hear no more\nfrom him then. He stood watching her as she walked away, at her usual\nslow pace, her head slightly bent forward, her rosary lifted in her left\nhand, and the fingers of the right hand mechanically slipping the beads.\n\n\"Prayers, always prayers!\" thought Juan to himself, as his eyes followed\nher. \"If they'll take one to heaven, the Senora'll go by the straight\nroad, that's sure! I'm sorry I vexed her. But what's a man to do, if\nhe's the interest of the place at heart, I'd like to know. Is he to\nstand by, and see a lot of idle mooning louts run away with everything?\nAh, but it was an ill day for the estate when the General died,--an ill\nday! an ill day! And they may scold me as much as they please, and set\nme to confessing my sins to the Father; it's very well for them, they've\ngot me to look after matters. Senor Felipe will do well enough when he's\na man, maybe; but a boy like him! Bah!\" And the old man stamped his\nfoot with a not wholly unreasonable irritation, at the false position in\nwhich he felt himself put.\n\n\"Confess to Father Salvierderra, indeed!\" he muttered aloud. \"Ay, that\nwill I. He's a man of sense, if he is a priest,\"--at which slip of the\ntongue the pious Juan hastily crossed himself,--\"and I'll ask him to\ngive me some good advice as to how I'm to manage between this young boy\nat the head of everything, and a doting mother who thinks he has the\nwisdom of a dozen grown men. The Father knew the place in the olden\ntime. He knows it's no child's play to look after the estate even now,\nmuch smaller as it is! An ill day when the old General died, an ill\nday indeed, the saints rest his soul!\" Saying this, Juan shrugged his\nshoulders, and whistling to Capitan, walked towards the sunny veranda of\nthe south side of the kitchen wing of the house, where it had been for\ntwenty odd years his habit to sit on the long bench and smoke his pipe\nof a morning. Before he had got half-way across the court-yard, however,\na thought struck him. He halted so suddenly that Capitan, with the quick\nsensitiveness of his breed, thought so sudden a change of purpose could\nonly come from something in connection with sheep; and, true to his\ninstinct of duty, pricked up his ears, poised himself for a full run,\nand looked up in his master's face waiting for explanation and signal.\nBut Juan did not observe him.\n\n\"Ha!\" he said, \"Father Salvierderra comes next month, does he? Let's\nsee. To-day is the 25th. That's it. The sheep-shearing is not to come\noff till the Father gets here. Then each morning it will be mass in the\nchapel, and each night vespers; and the crowd will be here at least\ntwo days longer to feed, for the time they will lose by that and by\nthe confessions. That's what Senor Felipe is up to. He's a pious lad.\nI recollect now, it was the same way two years ago. Well, well, it is a\ngood thing for those poor Indian devils to get a bit of religion now and\nthen; and it's like old times to see the chapel full of them kneeling,\nand more than can get in at the door; I doubt not it warms the Senora's\nheart to see them all there, as if they belonged to the house, as\nthey used to: and now I know when it's to be, I have only to make my\narrangements accordingly. It is always in the first week of the month\nthe Father gets here. Yes; she said, 'Senor Felipe will be well enough\nin a week or two, he thinks.' Ha! ha! It will be nearer two; ten days or\nthereabouts. I'll begin the booths next week. A plague on that Luigo for\nnot being back here. He's the best hand I have to cut the willow boughs\nfor the roofs. He knows the difference between one year's growth and\nanother's; I'll say that much for him, spite of the silly dreaming head\nhe's got on his shoulders.\"\n\nJuan was so pleased with his clearing up in his mind as to Senor\nFelipe's purpose about the time of the sheep-shearing, that it put him\nin good humor for the day,--good humor with everybody, and himself most\nof all. As he sat on the low bench, his head leaning back against the\nwhitewashed wall, his long legs stretched out nearly across the whole\nwidth of the veranda, his pipe firm wedged in the extreme left corner\nof his mouth, his hands in his pockets, he was the picture of placid\ncontent. The troop of youngsters which still swarmed around the kitchen\nquarters of Senora Moreno's house, almost as numerous and inexplicable\nas in the grand old days of the General's time, ran back and forth\nacross Juan's legs, fell down between them, and picked themselves up by\nhelp of clutches at his leather trousers, all unreproved by Juan, though\nloudly scolded and warned by their respective mothers from the kitchen.\n\n\"What's come to Juan Can to be so good-natured to-day?\" saucily asked\nMargarita, the youngest and prettiest of the maids, popping her head out\nof a window, and twitching Juan's hair. He was so gray and wrinkled\nthat the maids all felt at ease with him. He seemed to them as old as\nMethuselah; but he was not really so old as they thought, nor they so\nsafe in their tricks. The old man had hot blood in his veins yet, as the\nunder-shepherds could testify.\n\n\"The sight of your pretty face, Senorita Margarita,\" answered Juan\nquickly, cocking his eye at her, rising to his feet, and making a mock\nbow towards the window.\n\n\"He! he! Senorita, indeed!\" chuckled Margarita's mother, old Marda the\ncook. \"Senor Juan Canito is pleased to be merry at the doors of his\nbetters;\" and she flung a copper saucepan full of not over-clean water\nso deftly past Juan's head, that not a drop touched him, and yet he had\nthe appearance of having been ducked. At which bit of sleight-of-hand\nthe whole court-yard, young and old, babies, cocks, hens, and turkeys,\nall set up a shout and a cackle, and dispersed to the four corners of\nthe yard as if scattered by a volley of bird-shot. Hearing the racket,\nthe rest of the maids came running,--Anita and Maria, the twins, women\nforty years old, born on the place the year after General Moreno brought\nhome his handsome young bride; their two daughters, Rosa and Anita the\nLittle, as she was still called, though she outweighed her mother; old\nJuanita, the oldest woman in the household, of whom even the Senora was\nsaid not to know the exact age or history; and she, poor thing, could\ntell nothing, having been silly for ten years or more, good for nothing\nexcept to shell beans: that she did as fast and well as ever, and was\nnever happy except she was at it. Luckily for her, beans are the one\ncrop never omitted or stinted on a Mexican estate; and for sake of old\nJuanita they stored every year in the Moreno house, rooms full of beans\nin the pod (tons of them, one would think), enough to feed an army. But\nthen, it was like a little army even now, the Senora's household; nobody\never knew exactly how many women were in the kitchen, or how many men\nin the fields. There were always women cousins, or brother's wives or\nwidows or daughters, who had come to stay, or men cousins, or sister's\nhusbands or sons, who were stopping on their way up or down the valley.\nWhen it came to the pay-roll, Senor Felipe knew to whom he paid wages;\nbut who were fed and lodged under his roof, that was quite another\nthing. It could not enter into the head of a Mexican gentleman to make\neither count or account of that. It would be a disgraceful niggardly\nthought.\n\nTo the Senora it seemed as if there were no longer any people about the\nplace. A beggarly handful, she would have said, hardly enough to do the\nwork of the house, or of the estate, sadly as the latter had dwindled.\nIn the General's day, it had been a free-handed boast of his that never\nless than fifty persons, men, women and children, were fed within his\ngates each day; how many more, he did not care, nor know. But that time\nhad indeed gone, gone forever; and though a stranger, seeing the sudden\nrush and muster at door and window, which followed on old Marda's\nletting fly the water at Juan's head, would have thought, \"Good heavens,\ndo all those women, children, and babies belong in that one house!\" the\nSenora's sole thought, as she at that moment went past the gate, was,\n\"Poor things! how few there are left of them! I am afraid old Marda has\nto work too hard. I must spare Margarita more from the house to help\nher.\" And she sighed deeply, and unconsciously held her rosary nearer to\nher heart, as she went into the house and entered her son's bedroom. The\npicture she saw there was one to thrill any mother's heart; and as it\nmet her eye, she paused on the threshold for a second,--only a second,\nhowever; and nothing could have astonished Felipe Moreno so much as to\nhave been told that at the very moment when his mother's calm voice was\nsaying to him, \"Good morning, my son, I hope you have slept well, and\nare better,\" there was welling up in her heart a passionate ejaculation,\n\"O my glorious son! The saints have sent me in him the face of his\nfather! He is fit for a kingdom!\"\n\nThe truth is, Felipe Moreno was not fit for a kingdom at all. If he had\nbeen, he would not have been so ruled by his mother without ever finding\nit out. But so far as mere physical beauty goes, there never was a\nking born, whose face, stature, and bearing would set off a crown or a\nthrone, or any of the things of which the outside of royalty is made up,\nbetter than would Felipe Moreno's. And it was true, as the Senora said,\nwhether the saints had anything to do with it or not, that he had the\nface of his father. So strong a likeness is seldom seen. When Felipe\nonce, on the occasion of a grand celebration and procession, put on the\ngold-wrought velvet mantle, gayly embroidered short breeches fastened at\nthe knee with red ribbons, and gold-and-silver-trimmed sombrero, which\nhis father had worn twenty-five years before, the Senora fainted at her\nfirst look at him,--fainted and fell; and when she opened her eyes, and\nsaw the same splendid, gayly arrayed, dark-bearded man, bending over her\nin distress, with words of endearment and alarm, she fainted again.\n\n\"Mother, mother mia,\" cried Felipe, \"I will not wear them if it makes\nyou feel like this! Let me take them off. I will not go to their cursed\nparade;\" and he sprang to his feet, and began with trembling fingers to\nunbuckle the sword-belt.\n\n\"No, no, Felipe,\" faintly cried the Senora, from the ground. \"It is my\nwish that you wear them;\" and staggering to her feet, with a burst of\ntears, she rebuckled the old sword-belt, which her fingers had so many\ntimes--never unkissed--buckled, in the days when her husband had bade\nher farewell and gone forth to the uncertain fates of war. \"Wear\nthem!\" she cried, with gathering fire in her tones, and her eyes dry\nof tears,--\"wear them, and let the American hounds see what a Mexican\nofficer and gentleman looked like before they had set their base,\nusurping feet on our necks!\" And she followed him to the gate, and stood\nerect, bravely waving her handkerchief as he galloped off, till he was\nout of sight. Then with a changed face and a bent head she crept slowly\nto her room, locked herself in, fell on her knees before the Madonna at\nthe head of her bed, and spent the greater part of the day praying that\nshe might be forgiven, and that all heretics might be discomfited. From\nwhich part of these supplications she derived most comfort is easy to\nimagine.\n\nJuan Canito had been right in his sudden surmise that it was for Father\nSalvierderra's coming that the sheep-shearing was being delayed, and not\nin consequence of Senor Felipe's illness, or by the non-appearance of\nLuigo and his flock of sheep. Juan would have chuckled to himself still\nmore at his perspicacity, had he overheard the conversation going on\nbetween the Senora and her son, at the very time when he, half asleep\non the veranda, was, as he would have called it, putting two and two\ntogether and convincing himself that old Juan was as smart as they were,\nand not to be kept in the dark by all their reticence and equivocation.\n\n\"Juan Can is growing very impatient about the sheep-shearing,\" said\nthe Senora. \"I suppose you are still of the same mind about it,\nFelipe,--that it is better to wait till Father Salvierderra comes? As\nthe only chance those Indians have of seeing him is here, it would seem\na Christian duty to so arrange it, if it be possible; but Juan is very\nrestive. He is getting old, and chafes a little, I fancy, under your\ncontrol. He cannot forget that you were a boy on his knee. Now I, for my\npart, am like to forget that you were ever anything but a man for me to\nlean on.\"\n\nFelipe turned his handsome face toward his mother with a beaming smile\nof filial affection and gratified manly vanity. \"Indeed, my mother, if\nI can be sufficient for you to lean on, I will ask nothing more of the\nsaints;\" and he took his mother's thin and wasted little hands, both at\nonce, in his own strong right hand, and carried them to his lips as a\nlover might have done. \"You will spoil me, mother,\" he said, \"you make\nme so proud.\"\n\n\"No, Felipe, it is I who am proud,\" promptly replied the mother; \"and I\ndo not call it being proud, only grateful to God for having given me\na son wise enough to take his father's place, and guide and protect me\nthrough the few remaining years I have to live. I shall die content,\nseeing you at the head of the estate, and living as a Mexican gentleman\nshould; that is, so far as now remains possible in this unfortunate\ncountry. But about the sheep-shearing, Felipe. Do you wish to have it\nbegun before the Father is here? Of course, Alessandro is all ready\nwith his band. It is but two days' journey for a messenger to bring\nhim. Father Salvierderra cannot be here before the 10th of the month. He\nleaves Santa Barbara on the 1st, and he will walk all the way,--a good\nsix days' journey, for he is old now and feeble; then he must stop\nin Ventura for a Sunday, and a day at the Ortega's ranch, and at the\nLopez's,--there, there is a christening. Yes, the 10th is the very\nearliest that he can be here,--near two weeks from now. So far as your\ngetting up is concerned, it might perhaps be next week. You will be\nnearly well by that time.\"\n\n\"Yes, indeed,\" laughed Felipe, stretching himself out in the bed and\ngiving a kick to the bedclothes that made the high bedposts and the\nfringed canopy roof shake and creak; \"I am well now, if it were not for\nthis cursed weakness when I stand on my feet. I believe it would do me\ngood to get out of doors.\"\n\nIn truth, Felipe had been hankering for the sheep-shearing himself. It\nwas a brisk, busy, holiday sort of time to him, hard as he worked in it;\nand two weeks looked long to wait.\n\n\"It is always thus after a fever,\" said his mother. \"The weakness lasts\nmany weeks. I am not sure that you will be strong enough even in two\nweeks to do the packing; but, as Juan Can said this morning, he stood\nat the packing-bag when you were a boy, and there was no need of waiting\nfor you for that!\"\n\n\"He said that, did he!\" exclaimed Felipe, wrathfully. \"The old man is\ngetting insolent. I'll tell him that nobody will pack the sacks but\nmyself, while I am master here; and I will have the sheep-shearing when\nI please, and not before.\"\n\n\"I suppose it would not be wise to say that it is not to take place till\nthe Father comes, would it?\" asked the Senora, hesitatingly, as if the\nthing were evenly balanced in her mind. \"The Father has not that hold\non the younger men he used to have, and I have thought that even in\nJuan himself I have detected a remissness. The spirit of unbelief is\nspreading in the country since the Americans are running up and down\neverywhere seeking money, like dogs with their noses to the ground! It\nmight vex Juan if he knew that you were waiting only for the Father.\nWhat do you think?\"\n\n\"I think it is enough for him to know that the sheep-shearing waits for\nmy pleasure,\" answered Felipe, still wrathful, \"and that is the end of\nit.\" And so it was; and, moreover, precisely the end which Senora Moreno\nhad had in her own mind from the beginning; but not even Juan Canito\nhimself suspected its being solely her purpose, and not her son's. As\nfor Felipe, if any person had suggested to him that it was his mother,\nand not he, who had decided that the sheep-shearing would be better\ndeferred until the arrival of Father Salvierderra from Santa Barbara,\nand that nothing should be said on the ranch about this being the real\nreason of the postponing, Felipe would have stared in astonishment, and\nhave thought that person either crazy or a fool.\n\nTo attain one's ends in this way is the consummate triumph of art. Never\nto appear as a factor in the situation; to be able to wield other men,\nas instruments, with the same direct and implicit response to will that\none gets from a hand or a foot,--this is to triumph, indeed: to be as\nnearly controller and conqueror of Fates as fate permits. There have\nbeen men prominent in the world's affairs at one time and another, who\nhave sought and studied such a power and have acquired it to a\ngreat degree. By it they have manipulated legislators, ambassadors,\nsovereigns; and have grasped, held, and played with the destinies\nof empires. But it is to be questioned whether even in these notable\ninstances there has ever been such marvellous completeness of success\nas is sometimes seen in the case of a woman in whom the power is an\ninstinct and not an attainment; a passion rather than a purpose.\nBetween the two results, between the two processes, there is just that\ndifference which is always to be seen between the stroke of talent and\nthe stroke of genius.\n\nSenora Moreno's was the stroke of genius.\n\n\n\n\nII\n\nTHE Senora Moreno's house was one of the best specimens to be found\nin California of the representative house of the half barbaric, half\nelegant, wholly generous and free-handed life led there by Mexican men\nand women of degree in the early part of this century, under the rule of\nthe Spanish and Mexican viceroys, when the laws of the Indies were still\nthe law of the land, and its old name, \"New Spain,\" was an ever-present\nlink and stimulus to the warmest memories and deepest patriotisms of its\npeople.\n\nIt was a picturesque life, with more of sentiment and gayety in it, more\nalso that was truly dramatic, more romance, than will ever be seen\nagain on those sunny shores. The aroma of it all lingers there still;\nindustries and inventions have not yet slain it; it will last out its\ncentury,--in fact, it can never be quite lost, so long as there is left\nstanding one such house as the Senora Moreno's.\n\nWhen the house was built, General Moreno owned all the land within a\nradius of forty miles,--forty miles westward, down the valley to the\nsea; forty miles eastward, into the San Fernando Mountains; and good\nforty miles more or less along the coast. The boundaries were not very\nstrictly defined; there was no occasion, in those happy days, to reckon\nland by inches. It might be asked, perhaps, just how General Moreno\nowned all this land, and the question might not be easy to answer. It\nwas not and could not be answered to the satisfaction of the United\nStates Land Commission, which, after the surrender of California,\nundertook to sift and adjust Mexican land titles; and that was the\nway it had come about that the Senora Moreno now called herself a poor\nwoman. Tract after tract, her lands had been taken away from her; it\nlooked for a time as if nothing would be left. Every one of the claims\nbased on deeds of gift from Governor Pio Fico, her husband's most\nintimate friend, was disallowed. They all went by the board in one\nbatch, and took away from the Senora in a day the greater part of\nher best pasture-lands. They were lands which had belonged to the\nBonaventura Mission, and lay along the coast at the mouth of the valley\ndown which the little stream which ran past her house went to the sea;\nand it had been a great pride and delight to the Senora, when she was\nyoung, to ride that forty miles by her husband's side, all the way on\ntheir own lands, straight from their house to their own strip of shore.\nNo wonder she believed the Americans thieves, and spoke of them always\nas hounds. The people of the United States have never in the least\nrealized that the taking possession of California was not only a\nconquering of Mexico, but a conquering of California as well; that the\nreal bitterness of the surrender was not so much to the empire which\ngave up the country, as to the country itself which was given up.\nProvinces passed back and forth in that way, helpless in the hands of\ngreat powers, have all the ignominy and humiliation of defeat, with none\nof the dignities or compensations of the transaction.\n\nMexico saved much by her treaty, spite of having to acknowledge herself\nbeaten; but California lost all. Words cannot tell the sting of such\na transfer. It is a marvel that a Mexican remained in the country;\nprobably none did, except those who were absolutely forced to it.\n\nLuckily for the Senora Moreno, her title to the lands midway in the\nvalley was better than to those lying to the east and the west, which\nhad once belonged to the missions of San Fernando and Bonaventura;\nand after all the claims, counter-claims, petitions, appeals, and\nadjudications were ended, she still was left in undisputed possession of\nwhat would have been thought by any new-comer into the country to be a\nhandsome estate, but which seemed to the despoiled and indignant Senora\na pitiful fragment of one. Moreover, she declared that she should never\nfeel secure of a foot of even this. Any day, she said, the United States\nGovernment might send out a new Land Commission to examine the decrees\nof the first, and revoke such as they saw fit. Once a thief, always a\nthief. Nobody need feel himself safe under American rule. There was\nno knowing what might happen any day; and year by year the lines of\nsadness, resentment, anxiety, and antagonism deepened on the Senora's\nfast aging face.\n\nIt gave her unspeakable satisfaction, when the Commissioners, laying out\na road down the valley, ran it at the back of her house instead of\npast the front. \"It is well,\" she said. \"Let their travel be where it\nbelongs, behind our kitchens; and no one have sight of the front doors\nof our houses, except friends who have come to visit us.\" Her enjoyment\nof this never flagged. Whenever she saw, passing the place, wagons\nor carriages belonging to the hated Americans, it gave her a distinct\nthrill of pleasure to think that the house turned its back on them. She\nwould like always to be able to do the same herself; but whatever she,\nby policy or in business, might be forced to do, the old house, at any\nrate, would always keep the attitude of contempt,--its face turned away.\n\nOne other pleasure she provided herself with, soon after this road was\nopened,--a pleasure in which religious devotion and race antagonism were\nso closely blended that it would have puzzled the subtlest of priests to\ndecide whether her act were a sin or a virtue. She caused to be set\nup, upon every one of the soft rounded hills which made the beautiful\nrolling sides of that part of the valley, a large wooden cross; not a\nhill in sight of her house left without the sacred emblem of her faith.\n\"That the heretics may know, when they go by, that they are on the\nestate of a good Catholic,\" she said, \"and that the faithful may be\nreminded to pray. There have been miracles of conversion wrought on the\nmost hardened by a sudden sight of the Blessed Cross.\"\n\nThere they stood, summer and winter, rain and shine, the silent, solemn,\noutstretched arms, and became landmarks to many a guideless traveller\nwho had been told that his way would be by the first turn to the left\nor the right, after passing the last one of the Senora Moreno's crosses,\nwhich he couldn't miss seeing. And who shall say that it did not\noften happen that the crosses bore a sudden message to some idle\nheart journeying by, and thus justified the pious half of the Senora's\nimpulse? Certain it is, that many a good Catholic halted and crossed\nhimself when he first beheld them, in the lonely places, standing out in\nsudden relief against the blue sky; and if he said a swift short prayer\nat the sight, was he not so much the better?\n\nThe house, was of adobe, low, with a wide veranda on the three sides of\nthe inner court, and a still broader one across the entire front, which\nlooked to the south. These verandas, especially those on the inner\ncourt, were supplementary rooms to the house. The greater part of the\nfamily life went on in them. Nobody stayed inside the walls, except when\nit was necessary. All the kitchen work, except the actual cooking, was\ndone here, in front of the kitchen doors and windows. Babies slept,\nwere washed, sat in the dirt, and played, on the veranda. The women said\ntheir prayers, took their naps, and wove their lace there. Old Juanita\nshelled her beans there, and threw the pods down on the tile floor,\ntill towards night they were sometimes piled up high around her, like\ncorn-husks at a husking. The herdsmen and shepherds smoked there,\nlounged there, trained their dogs there; there the young made love, and\nthe old dozed; the benches, which ran the entire length of the walls,\nwere worn into hollows, and shone like satin; the tiled floors also were\nbroken and sunk in places, making little wells, which filled up in times\nof hard rains, and were then an invaluable addition to the children's\nresources for amusement, and also to the comfort of the dogs, cats, and\nfowls, who picked about among them, taking sips from each.\n\nThe arched veranda along the front was a delightsome place. It must\nhave been eighty feet long, at least, for the doors of five large rooms\nopened on it. The two westernmost rooms had been added on, and made four\nsteps higher than the others; which gave to that end of the veranda the\nlook of a balcony, or loggia. Here the Senora kept her flowers; great\nred water-jars, hand-made by the Indians of San Luis Obispo Mission,\nstood in close rows against the walls, and in them were always growing\nfine geraniums, carnations, and yellow-flowered musk. The Senora's\npassion for musk she had inherited from her mother. It was so strong\nthat she sometimes wondered at it; and one day, as she sat with Father\nSalvierderra in the veranda, she picked a handful of the blossoms, and\ngiving them to him, said, \"I do not know why it is, but it seems to me\nif I were dead I could be brought to life by the smell of musk.\"\n\n\"It is in your blood, Senora,\" the old monk replied. \"When I was last in\nyour father's house in Seville, your mother sent for me to her room,\nand under her window was a stone balcony full of growing musk, which so\nfilled the room with its odor that I was like to faint. But she said\nit cured her of diseases, and without it she fell ill. You were a baby\nthen.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" cried the Senora, \"but I recollect that balcony. I recollect\nbeing lifted up to a window, and looking down into a bed of blooming\nyellow flowers; but I did not know what they were. How strange!\"\n\n\"No. Not strange, daughter,\" replied Father Salvierderra. \"It would have\nbeen stranger if you had not acquired the taste, thus drawing it in with\nthe mother's milk. It would behoove mothers to remember this far more\nthan they do.\"\n\nBesides the geraniums and carnations and musk in the red jars, there\nwere many sorts of climbing vines,--some coming from the ground, and\ntwining around the pillars of the veranda; some growing in great bowls,\nswung by cords from the roof of the veranda, or set on shelves against\nthe walls. These bowls were of gray stone, hollowed and polished,\nshining smooth inside and out. They also had been made by the Indians,\nnobody knew how many ages ago, scooped and polished by the patient\ncreatures, with only stones for tools.\n\nAmong these vines, singing from morning till night, hung the\nSenora's canaries and finches, half a dozen of each, all of different\ngenerations, raised by the Senora. She was never without a young\nbird-family on hand; and all the way from Bonaventura to Monterey, it\nwas thought a piece of good luck to come into possession of a canary or\nfinch of Senora Moreno's 'raising.\n\nBetween the veranda and the river meadows, out on which it looked, all\nwas garden, orange grove, and almond orchard; the orange grove always\ngreen, never without snowy bloom or golden fruit; the garden never\nwithout flowers, summer or winter; and the almond orchard, in early\nspring, a fluttering canopy of pink and white petals, which, seen from\nthe hills on the opposite side of the river, looked as if rosy sunrise\nclouds had fallen, and become tangled in the tree-tops. On either hand\nstretched away other orchards,--peach, apricot, pear, apple pomegranate;\nand beyond these, vineyards. Nothing was to be seen but verdure or\nbloom or fruit, at whatever time of year you sat on the Senora's south\nveranda.\n\nA wide straight walk shaded by a trellis so knotted and twisted with\ngrapevines that little was to be seen of the trellis wood-work, led\nstraight down from the veranda steps, through the middle of the garden,\nto a little brook at the foot of it. Across this brook, in the shade\nof a dozen gnarled old willow-trees, were set the broad flat stone\nwashboards on which was done all the family washing. No long dawdling,\nand no running away from work on the part of the maids, thus close to\nthe eye of the Senora at the upper end of the garden; and if they had\nknown how picturesque they looked there, kneeling on the grass, lifting\nthe dripping linen out of the water, rubbing it back and forth on the\nstones, sousing it, wringing it, splashing the clear water in each\nother's faces, they would have been content to stay at the washing day\nin and day out, for there was always somebody to look on from above.\nHardly a day passed that the Senora had not visitors. She was still\na person of note; her house the natural resting-place for all who\njourneyed through the valley; and whoever came, spent all of his time,\nwhen not eating, sleeping, or walking over the place, sitting with the\nSenora on the sunny veranda. Few days in winter were cold enough, and\nin summer the day must be hot indeed to drive the Senora and her friends\nindoors. There stood on the veranda three carved oaken chairs, and a\ncarved bench, also of oak, which had been brought to the Senora for safe\nkeeping by the faithful old sacristan of San Luis Rey, at the time of\nthe occupation of that Mission by the United States troops, soon after\nthe conquest of California. Aghast at the sacrilegious acts of the\nsoldiers, who were quartered in the very church itself, and amused\nthemselves by making targets of the eyes and noses of the saints'\nstatues, the sacristan, stealthily, day by day and night after night,\nbore out of the church all that he dared to remove, burying some\narticles in cottonwood copses, hiding others in his own poor little\nhovel, until he had wagon-loads of sacred treasures. Then, still more\nstealthily, he carried them, a few at a time, concealed in the bottom of\na cart, under a load of hay or of brush, to the house of the Senora, who\nfelt herself deeply honored by his confidence, and received everything\nas a sacred trust, to be given back into the hands of the Church again,\nwhenever the Missions should be restored, of which at that time all\nCatholics had good hope. And so it had come about that no bedroom in the\nSenora's house was without a picture or a statue of a saint or of the\nMadonna; and some had two; and in the little chapel in the garden the\naltar was surrounded by a really imposing row of holy and apostolic\nfigures, which had looked down on the splendid ceremonies of the San\nLuis Rey Mission, in Father Peyri's time, no more benignly than they\nnow did on the humbler worship of the Senora's family in its diminished\nestate. That one had lost an eye, another an arm, that the once\nbrilliant colors of the drapery were now faded and shabby, only enhanced\nthe tender reverence with which the Senora knelt before them, her eyes\nfilling with indignant tears at thought of the heretic hands which\nhad wrought such defilement. Even the crumbling wreaths which had been\nplaced on some of the statues' heads at the time of the last ceremonial\nat which they had figured in the Mission, had been brought away with\nthem by the devout sacristan, and the Senora had replaced each one,\nholding it only a degree less sacred than the statue itself.\n\nThis chapel was dearer to the Senora than her house. It had been built\nby the General in the second year of their married life. In it her four\nchildren had been christened, and from it all but one, her handsome\nFelipe, had been buried while they were yet infants. In the General's\ntime, while the estate was at its best, and hundreds of Indians living\nwithin its borders, there was many a Sunday when the scene to be\nwitnessed there was like the scenes at the Missions,--the chapel full of\nkneeling men and women; those who could not find room inside kneeling\non the garden walks outside; Father Salvierderra, in gorgeous\nvestments, coming, at close of the services, slowly down the aisle, the\nclose-packed rows of worshippers parting to right and left to let him\nthrough, all looking up eagerly for his blessing, women giving him\nofferings of fruit or flowers, and holding up their babies that he might\nlay his hands on their heads. No one but Father Salvierderra had ever\nofficiated in the Moreno chapel, or heard the confession of a Moreno. He\nwas a Franciscan, one of the few now left in the country; so revered and\nbeloved by all who had come under his influence, that they would wait\nlong months without the offices of the Church, rather than confess\ntheir sins or confide their perplexities to any one else. From this\ndeep-seated attachment on the part of the Indians and the older Mexican\nfamilies in the country to the Franciscan Order, there had grown up,\nnot unnaturally, some jealousy of them in the minds of the later-come\nsecular priests, and the position of the few monks left was not wholly a\npleasant one. It had even been rumored that they were to be forbidden\nto continue longer their practice of going up and down the country,\nministering everywhere; were to be compelled to restrict their labors\nto their own colleges at Santa Barbara and Santa Inez. When something\nto this effect was one day said in the Senora Moreno's presence, two\nscarlet spots sprang on her cheeks, and before she bethought herself,\nshe exclaimed, \"That day, I burn down my chapel!\"\n\nLuckily, nobody but Felipe heard the rash threat, and his exclamation of\nunbounded astonishment recalled the Senora to herself.\n\n\"I spoke rashly, my son,\" she said. \"The Church is to be obeyed always;\nbut the Franciscan Fathers are responsible to no one but the Superior of\ntheir own order; and there is no one in this land who has the authority\nto forbid their journeying and ministering to whoever desires their\noffices. As for these Catalan priests who are coming in here, I cannot\nabide them. No Catalan but has bad blood in his veins!\"\n\nThere was every reason in the world why the Senora should be thus warmly\nattached to the Franciscan Order. From her earliest recollections the\ngray gown and cowl had been familiar to her eyes, and had represented\nthe things which she was taught to hold most sacred and dear. Father\nSalvierderra himself had come from Mexico to Monterey in the same ship\nwhich had brought her father to be the commandante of the Santa Barbara\nPresidio; and her best-beloved uncle, her father's eldest brother, was\nat that time the Superior of the Santa Barbara Mission. The sentiment\nand romance of her youth were almost equally divided between the\ngayeties, excitements, adornments of the life at the Presidio, and the\nceremonies and devotions of the life at the Mission. She was famed as\nthe most beautiful girl in the country. Men of the army, men of the\nnavy, and men of the Church, alike adored her. Her name was a toast\nfrom Monterey to San Diego. When at last she was wooed and won by Felipe\nMoreno, one of the most distinguished of the Mexican Generals, her\nwedding ceremonies were the most splendid ever seen in the country.\nThe right tower of the Mission church at Santa Barbara had been just\ncompleted, and it was arranged that the consecration of this tower\nshould take place at the time of her wedding, and that her wedding feast\nshould be spread in the long outside corridor of the Mission building.\nThe whole country, far and near, was bid. The feast lasted three days;\nopen tables to everybody; singing, dancing, eating, drinking, and making\nmerry. At that time there were long streets of Indian houses stretching\neastward from the Mission; before each of these houses was built a booth\nof green boughs. The Indians, as well as the Fathers from all the other\nMissions, were invited to come. The Indians came in bands, singing songs\nand bringing gifts. As they appeared, the Santa Barbara Indians went\nout to meet them, also singing, bearing gifts, and strewing seeds on\nthe ground, in token of welcome. The young Senora and her bridegroom,\nsplendidly clothed, were seen of all, and greeted, whenever they\nappeared, by showers of seeds and grains and blossoms. On the third\nday, still in their wedding attire, and bearing lighted candles in their\nhands, they walked with the monks in a procession, round and round the\nnew tower, the monks chanting, and sprinkling incense and holy water\non its walls, the ceremony seeming to all devout beholders to give a\nblessed consecration to the union of the young pair as well as to the\nnewly completed tower. After this they journeyed in state, accompanied\nby several of the General's aids and officers, and by two Franciscan\nFathers, up to Monterey, stopping on their way at all the Missions, and\nbeing warmly welcomed and entertained at each.\n\nGeneral Moreno was much beloved by both army and Church. In many of the\nfrequent clashings between the military and the ecclesiastical powers\nhe, being as devout and enthusiastic a Catholic as he was zealous and\nenthusiastic a soldier, had had the good fortune to be of material\nassistance to each party. The Indians also knew his name well, having\nheard it many times mentioned with public thanksgivings in the Mission\nchurches, after some signal service he had rendered to the Fathers\neither in Mexico or Monterey. And now, by taking as his bride the\ndaughter of a distinguished officer, and the niece of the Santa Barbara\nSuperior, he had linked himself anew to the two dominant powers and\ninterests of the country.\n\nWhen they reached San Luis Obispo, the whole Indian population turned\nout to meet them, the Padre walking at the head. As they approached the\nMission doors the Indians swarmed closer and closer and still closer,\ntook the General's horse by the head, and finally almost by actual force\ncompelled him to allow himself to be lifted into a blanket, held high\nup by twenty strong men; and thus he was borne up the steps, across\nthe corridor, and into the Padre's room. It was a position ludicrously\nundignified in itself, but the General submitted to it good-naturedly.\n\n\"Oh, let them do it, if they like,\" he cried, laughingly, to Padre\nMartinez, who was endeavoring to quiet the Indians and hold them back.\n\"Let them do it. It pleases the poor creatures.\"\n\nOn the morning of their departure, the good Padre, having exhausted all\nhis resources for entertaining his distinguished guests, caused to\nbe driven past the corridors, for their inspection, all the poultry\nbelonging to the Mission. The procession took an hour to pass. For\nmusic, there was the squeaking, cackling, hissing, gobbling, crowing,\nquacking of the fowls, combined with the screaming, scolding, and\nwhip-cracking of the excited Indian marshals of the lines. First came\nthe turkeys, then the roosters, then the white hens, then the black, and\nthen the yellow, next the ducks, and at the tail of the spectacle\nlong files of geese, some strutting, some half flying and hissing in\nresentment and terror at the unwonted coercions to which they were\nsubjected. The Indians had been hard at work all night capturing,\nsorting, assorting, and guarding the rank and file of their novel\npageant. It would be safe to say that a droller sight never was seen,\nand never will be, on the Pacific coast or any other. Before it was done\nwith, the General and his bride had nearly died with laughter; and the\nGeneral could never allude to it without laughing almost as heartily\nagain.\n\nAt Monterey they were more magnificently feted; at the Presidio, at the\nMission, on board Spanish, Mexican, and Russian ships lying in harbor,\nballs, dances, bull-fights, dinners, all that the country knew of\nfestivity, was lavished on the beautiful and winning young bride. The\nbelles of the coast, from San Diego up, had all gathered at Monterey for\nthese gayeties, but not one of them could be for a moment compared to\nher. This was the beginning of the Senora's life as a married woman.\nShe was then just twenty. A close observer would have seen even then,\nunderneath the joyous smile, the laughing eye, the merry voice, a look\nthoughtful, tender, earnest, at times enthusiastic. This look was the\nreflection of those qualities in her, then hardly aroused, which made\nher, as years developed her character and stormy fates thickened around\nher life, the unflinching comrade of her soldier husband, the passionate\nadherent of the Church. Through wars, insurrections, revolutions,\ndownfalls, Spanish, Mexican, civil, ecclesiastical, her standpoint,\nher poise, remained the same. She simply grew more and more proudly,\npassionately, a Spaniard and a Moreno; more and more stanchly and\nfierily a Catholic, and a lover of the Franciscans.\n\nDuring the height of the despoiling and plundering of the Missions,\nunder the Secularization Act, she was for a few years almost beside\nherself. More than once she journeyed alone, when the journey was by\nno means without danger, to Monterey, to stir up the Prefect of\nthe Missions to more energetic action, to implore the governmental\nauthorities to interfere, and protect the Church's property. It\nwas largely in consequence of her eloquent entreaties that Governor\nMicheltorena issued his bootless order, restoring to the Church all the\nMissions south of San Luis Obispo. But this order cost Micheltorena his\npolitical head, and General Moreno was severely wounded in one of the\nskirmishes of the insurrection which drove Micheltorena out of the\ncountry.\n\nIn silence and bitter humiliation the Senora nursed her husband back\nto health again, and resolved to meddle no more in the affairs of her\nunhappy country and still more unhappy Church. As year by year she\nsaw the ruin of the Missions steadily going on, their vast properties\nmelting away, like dew before the sun, in the hands of dishonest\nadministrators and politicians, the Church powerless to contend with the\nunprincipled greed in high places, her beloved Franciscan Fathers driven\nfrom the country or dying of starvation at their posts, she submitted\nherself to what, she was forced to admit, seemed to be the inscrutable\nwill of God for the discipline and humiliation of the Church. In a sort\nof bewildered resignation she waited to see what further sufferings\nwere to come, to fill up the measure of the punishment which, for some\nmysterious purpose, the faithful must endure. But when close upon\nall this discomfiture and humiliation of her Church followed the\ndiscomfiture and humiliation of her country in war, and the near and\nevident danger of an English-speaking people's possessing the land,\nall the smothered fire of the Senora's nature broke out afresh. With\nunfaltering hands she buckled on her husband's sword, and with dry eyes\nsaw him go forth to fight. She had but one regret, that she was not the\nmother of sons to fight also.\n\n\"Would thou wert a man, Felipe,\" she exclaimed again and again in tones\nthe child never forgot. \"Would thou wert a man, that thou might go also\nto fight these foreigners!\"\n\nAny race under the sun would have been to the Senora less hateful than\nthe American. She had scorned them in her girlhood, when they came\ntrading to post after post. She scorned them still. The idea of being\nforced to wage a war with pedlers was to her too monstrous to be\nbelieved. In the outset she had no doubt that the Mexicans would win in\nthe contest.\n\n\"What!\" she cried, \"shall we who won independence from Spain, be beaten\nby these traders? It is impossible!\"\n\nWhen her husband was brought home to her dead, killed in the last fight\nthe Mexican forces made, she said icily, \"He would have chosen to die\nrather than to have been forced to see his country in the hands of\nthe enemy.\" And she was almost frightened at herself to see how this\nthought, as it dwelt in her mind, slew the grief in her heart. She had\nbelieved she could not live if her husband were to be taken away from\nher; but she found herself often glad that he was dead,--glad that he\nwas spared the sight and the knowledge of the things which happened;\nand even the yearning tenderness with which her imagination pictured\nhim among the saints, was often turned into a fierce wondering whether\nindignation did not fill his soul, even in heaven, at the way things\nwere going in the land for whose sake he had died.\n\nOut of such throes as these had been born the second nature which made\nSenora Moreno the silent, reserved, stern, implacable woman they knew,\nwho knew her first when she was sixty. Of the gay, tender, sentimental\ngirl, who danced and laughed with the officers, and prayed and confessed\nwith the Fathers, forty years before, there was small trace left now,\nin the low-voiced, white-haired, aged woman, silent, unsmiling,\nplacid-faced, who manoeuvred with her son and her head shepherd alike,\nto bring it about that a handful of Indians might once more confess\ntheir sins to a Franciscan monk in the Moreno chapel.\n\n\n\n\nIII\n\nJUAN CANITO and Senor Felipe were not the only members of the Senora's\nfamily who were impatient for the sheep-shearing. There was also Ramona.\nRamona was, to the world at large, a far more important person than the\nSenora herself. The Senora was of the past; Ramona was of the present.\nFor one eye that could see the significant, at times solemn, beauty of\nthe Senora's pale and shadowed countenance, there were a hundred that\nflashed with eager pleasure at the barest glimpse of Ramona's face; the\nshepherds, the herdsmen, the maids, the babies, the dogs, the poultry,\nall loved the sight of Ramona; all loved her, except the Senora. The\nSenora loved her not; never had loved her, never could love her; and\nyet she had stood in the place of mother to the girl ever since her\nchildhood, and never once during the whole sixteen years of her life had\nshown her any unkindness in act. She had promised to be a mother to her;\nand with all the inalienable stanchness of her nature she fulfilled the\nletter of her promise. More than the bond lay in the bond; but that was\nnot the Senora's fault.\n\nThe story of Ramona the Senora never told. To most of the Senora's\nacquaintances now, Ramona was a mystery. They did not know--and no one\never asked a prying question of the Senora Moreno--who Ramona's parents\nwere, whether they were living or dead, or why Ramona, her name not\nbeing Moreno, lived always in the Senora's house as a daughter, tended\nand attended equally with the adored Felipe. A few gray-haired men and\nwomen here and there in the country could have told the strange story\nof Ramona; but its beginning was more than a half-century back, and much\nhad happened since then. They seldom thought of the child. They knew she\nwas in the Senora Moreno's keeping, and that was enough. The affairs of\nthe generation just going out were not the business of the young people\ncoming in. They would have tragedies enough of their own presently; what\nwas the use of passing down the old ones? Yet the story was not one to\nbe forgotten; and now and then it was told in the twilight of a summer\nevening, or in the shadows of vines on a lingering afternoon, and all\nyoung men and maidens thrilled who heard it.\n\nIt was an elder sister of the Senora's,--a sister old enough to be wooed\nand won while the Senora was yet at play,--who had been promised in\nmarriage to a young Scotchman named Angus Phail. She was a beautiful\nwoman; and Angus Phail, from the day that he first saw her standing in\nthe Presidio gate, became so madly her lover, that he was like a man\nbereft of his senses. This was the only excuse ever to be made for\nRamona Gonzaga's deed. It could never be denied, by her bitterest\naccusers, that, at the first, and indeed for many months, she told Angus\nshe did not love him, and could not marry him; and that it was only\nafter his stormy and ceaseless entreaties, that she did finally promise\nto become his wife. Then, almost immediately, she went away to Monterey,\nand Angus set sail for San Blas. He was the owner of the richest line\nof ships which traded along the coast at that time; the richest stuffs,\ncarvings, woods, pearls, and jewels, which came into the country, came\nin his ships. The arrival of one of them was always an event; and\nAngus himself, having been well-born in Scotland, and being wonderfully\nwell-mannered for a seafaring man, was made welcome in all the best\nhouses, wherever his ships went into harbor, from Monterey to San Diego.\n\nThe Senorita Ramona Gonzaga sailed for Monterey the same day and hour\nher lover sailed for San Blas. They stood on the decks waving signals to\neach other as one sailed away to the south, the other to the north.\nIt was remembered afterward by those who were in the ship with the\nSenorita, that she ceased to wave her signals, and had turned her face\naway, long before her lover's ship was out of sight. But the men of the\n\"San Jose\" said that Angus Phail stood immovable, gazing northward,\ntill nightfall shut from his sight even the horizon line at which the\nMonterey ship had long before disappeared from view.\n\nThis was to be his last voyage. He went on this only because his honor\nwas pledged to do so. Also, he comforted himself by thinking that he\nwould bring back for his bride, and for the home he meant to give her,\ntreasures of all sorts, which none could select so well as he. Through\nthe long weeks of the voyage he sat on deck, gazing dreamily at the\nwaves, and letting his imagination feed on pictures of jewels, satins,\nvelvets, laces, which would best deck his wife's form and face. When\nhe could not longer bear the vivid fancies' heat in his blood, he would\npace the deck, swifter and swifter, till his steps were like those\nof one flying in fear; at such times the men heard him muttering and\nwhispering to himself, \"Ramona! Ramona!\" Mad with love from the first\nto the last was Angus Phail; and there were many who believed that if he\nhad ever seen the hour when he called Ramona Gonzaga his own, his reason\nwould have fled forever at that moment, and he would have killed either\nher or himself, as men thus mad have been known to do. But that hour\nnever came. When, eight months later, the \"San Jose\" sailed into the\nSanta Barbara harbor, and Angus Phail leaped breathless on shore, the\nsecond man he met, no friend of his, looking him maliciously in\nthe face, said. \"So, ho! You're just too late for the wedding! Your\nsweetheart, the handsome Gonzaga girl, was married here, yesterday, to a\nfine young officer of the Monterey Presidio!\"\n\nAngus reeled, struck the man a blow full in the face, and fell on the\nground, foaming at the mouth. He was lifted and carried into a house,\nand, speedily recovering, burst with the strength of a giant from the\nhands of those who were holding him, sprang out of the door, and ran\nbareheaded up the road toward the Presidio. At the gate he was stopped\nby the guard, who knew him.\n\n\"Is it true?\" gasped Angus.\n\n\"Yes, Senor,\" replied the man, who said afterward that his knees shook\nunder him with terror at the look on the Scotchman's face. He feared he\nwould strike him dead for his reply. But, instead, Angus burst into\na maudlin laugh, and, turning away, went staggering down the street,\nsinging and laughing.\n\nThe next that was known of him was in a low drinking-place, where he was\nseen lying on the floor, dead drunk; and from that day he sank lower and\nlower, till one of the commonest sights to be seen in Santa Barbara was\nAngus Phail reeling about, tipsy, coarse, loud, profane, dangerous.\n\n\"See what the Senorita escaped!\" said the thoughtless. \"She was quite\nright not to have married such a drunken wretch.\"\n\nIn the rare intervals when he was partially sober, he sold all he\npossessed,--ship after ship sold for a song, and the proceeds squandered\nin drinking or worse. He never had a sight of his lost bride. He did not\nseek it; and she, terrified, took every precaution to avoid it, and soon\nreturned with her husband to Monterey.\n\nFinally Angus disappeared, and after a time the news came up from Los\nAngeles that he was there, had gone out to the San Gabriel Mission,\nand was living with the Indians. Some years later came the still more\nsurprising news that he had married a squaw,--a squaw with several\nIndian children,--had been legally married by the priest in the San\nGabriel Mission Church. And that was the last that the faithless Ramona\nGonzaga ever heard of her lover, until twenty-five years after her\nmarriage, when one day he suddenly appeared in her presence. How he\nhad gained admittance to the house was never known; but there he stood\nbefore her, bearing in his arms a beautiful babe, asleep. Drawing\nhimself up to the utmost of his six feet of height, and looking at her\nsternly, with eyes blue like steel, he said: \"Senora Ortegna, you once\ndid me a great wrong. You sinned, and the Lord has punished you. He has\ndenied you children. I also have done a wrong; I have sinned, and the\nLord has punished me. He has given me a child. I ask once more at your\nhands a boon. Will you take this child of mine, and bring it up as a\nchild of yours, or of mine, ought to be brought up?\"\n\nThe tears were rolling down the Senora Ortegna's cheeks. The Lord\nhad indeed punished her in more ways than Angus Phail knew. Her\nchildlessness, bitter as that had been, was the least of them.\nSpeechless, she rose, and stretched out her arms for the child. He\nplaced it in them. Still the child slept on, undisturbed.\n\n\"I do not know if I will be permitted,\" she said falteringly; \"my\nhusband--\"\n\n\"Father Salvierderra will command it. I have seen him,\" replied Angus.\n\nThe Senora's face brightened. \"If that be so, I hope it can be as you\nwish,\" she said. Then a strange embarrassment came upon her, and looking\ndown upon the infant, she said inquiringly, \"But the child's mother?\"\n\nAngus's face turned swarthy red. Perhaps, face to face with this gentle\nand still lovely woman he had once so loved, he first realized to the\nfull how wickedly he had thrown away his life. With a quick wave of\nhis hand, which spoke volumes, he said: \"That is nothing. She has other\nchildren, of her own blood. This is mine, my only one, my daughter. I\nwish her to be yours; otherwise, she will be taken by the Church.\"\n\nWith each second that she felt the little warm body's tender weight in\nher arms, Ramona Ortegna's heart had more and more yearned towards the\ninfant. At these words she bent her face down and kissed its cheek. \"Oh,\nno! not to the Church! I will love it as my own,\" she said.\n\nAngus Phail's face quivered. Feelings long dead within him stirred in\ntheir graves. He gazed at the sad and altered face, once so beautiful,\nso dear. \"I should hardly have known you, Senora!\" burst from him\ninvoluntarily.\n\nShe smiled piteously, with no resentment. \"That is not strange. I hardly\nknow myself,\" she whispered. \"Life has dealt very hardly with me.\nI should not have known you either--Angus.\" She pronounced his name\nhesitatingly, half appealingly. At the sound of the familiar syllables,\nso long unheard, the man's heart broke down. He buried his face in his\nhands, and sobbed out: \"O Ramona, forgive me! I brought the child here,\nnot wholly in love; partly in vengeance. But I am melted now. Are you\nsure you wish to keep her? I will take her away if you are not.\"\n\n\"Never, so long as I live, Angus,\" replied Senora Ortegna. \"Already I\nfeel that she is a mercy from the Lord. If my husband sees no offence in\nher presence, she will be a joy in my life. Has she been christened?\"\n\nAngus cast his eyes down. A sudden fear smote him. \"Before I had thought\nof bringing her to you,\" he stammered, \"at first I had only the thought\nof giving her to the Church. I had had her christened by\"--the words\nrefused to leave his lips--\"the name--Can you not guess, Senora, what\nname she bears?\"\n\nThe Senora knew. \"My own?\" she said.\n\nAngus bowed his head. \"The only woman's name that my lips ever spoke\nwith love,\" he said, reassured, \"was the name my daughter should bear.\"\n\n\"It is well,\" replied the Senora. Then a great silence fell between\nthem. Each studied the other's face, tenderly, bewilderedly. Then by a\nsimultaneous impulse they drew nearer. Angus stretched out both his arms\nwith a gesture of infinite love and despair, bent down and kissed the\nhands which lovingly held his sleeping child.\n\n\"God bless you, Ramona! Farewell! You will never see me more,\" he cried,\nand was gone.\n\nIn a moment more he reappeared on the threshold of the door, but only to\nsay in a low tone, \"There is no need to be alarmed if the child does not\nwake for some hours yet. She has had a safe sleeping-potion given her.\nIt will not harm her.\"\n\nOne more long lingering look into each other's faces, and the two\nlovers, so strangely parted, still more strangely met, had parted again,\nforever. The quarter of a century which had lain between them had been\nbridged in both their hearts as if it were but a day. In the heart\nof the man it was the old passionate adoring love reawakening;\na resurrection of the buried dead, to full life, with lineaments\nunchanged. In the woman it was not that; there was no buried love to\ncome to such resurrection in her heart, for she had never loved Angus\nPhail. But, long unloved, ill-treated, heartbroken, she woke at that\nmoment to the realization of what manner of love it had been which she\nhad thrown away in her youth; her whole being yearned for it now, and\nAngus was avenged.\n\nWhen Francis Ortegna, late that night, reeled, half-tipsy, into\nhis wife's room, he was suddenly sobered by the sight which met his\neyes,--his wife kneeling by the side of the cradle, in which lay,\nsmiling in its sleep, a beautiful infant.\n\n\"What in the devil's name,\" he began; then recollecting, he muttered:\n\"Oh, the Indian brat! I see! I wish you joy, Senora Ortegna, of your\nfirst child!\" and with a mock bow, and cruel sneer, he staggered by,\ngiving the cradle an angry thrust with his foot as he passed.\n\nThe brutal taunt did not much wound the Senora. The time had long since\npassed when unkind words from her husband could give her keen pain. But\nit was a warning not lost upon her new-born mother instinct, and from\nthat day the little Ramona was carefully kept and tended in apartments\nwhere there was no danger of her being seen by the man to whom the sight\nof her baby face was only a signal for anger and indecency.\n\nHitherto Ramona Ortegna had, so far as was possible, carefully concealed\nfrom her family the unhappiness of her married life. Ortegna's\ncharacter was indeed well known; his neglect of his wife, his shameful\ndissipations of all sorts, were notorious in every port in the country.\nBut from the wife herself no one had even heard so much as a syllable of\ncomplaint. She was a Gonzaga, and she knew how to suffer in silence, But\nnow she saw a reason for taking her sister into her confidence. It was\nplain to her that she had not many years to live; and what then would\nbecome of the child? Left to the tender mercies of Ortegna, it was only\ntoo certain what would become of her. Long sad hours of perplexity the\nlonely woman passed, with the little laughing babe in her arms, vainly\nendeavoring to forecast her future. The near chance of her own death had\nnot occurred to her mind when she accepted the trust.\n\nBefore the little Ramona was a year old, Angus Phail died. An Indian\nmessenger from San Gabriel brought the news to Senora Ortegna. He\nbrought her also a box and a letter, given to him by Angus the day\nbefore his death. The box contained jewels of value, of fashions a\nquarter of a century old. They were the jewels which Angus had bought\nfor his bride. These alone remained of all his fortune. Even in the\nlowest depths of his degradation, a certain sentiment had restrained him\nfrom parting with them. The letter contained only these words: \"I send\nyou all I have to leave my daughter. I meant to bring them myself this\nyear. I wished to kiss your hands and hers once more. But I am dying.\nFarewell.\"\n\nAfter these jewels were in her possession, Senora Ortegna rested not\ntill she had persuaded Senora Moreno to journey to Monterey, and had\nput the box into her keeping as a sacred trust. She also won from her a\nsolemn promise that at her own death she would adopt the little\nRamona. This promise came hard from Senora Moreno. Except for Father\nSalvierderra's influence, she had not given it. She did not wish any\ndealings with such alien and mongrel blood, \"If the child were pure\nIndian, I would like it better,\" she said. \"I like not these crosses. It\nis the worst, and not the best of each, that remains.\"\n\nBut the promise once given, Senora Ortegna was content. Well she knew\nthat her sister would not lie, nor evade a trust. The little Ramona's\nfuture was assured. During the last years of the unhappy woman's life\nthe child was her only comfort. Ortegna's conduct had become so openly\nand defiantly infamous, that he even flaunted his illegitimate relations\nin his wife's presence; subjecting her to gross insults, spite of her\nhelpless invalidism. This last outrage was too much for the Gonzaga\nblood to endure; the Senora never afterward left her apartment, or spoke\nto her husband. Once more she sent for her sister to come; this time, to\nsee her die. Every valuable she possessed, jewels, laces, brocades, and\ndamasks, she gave into her sister's charge, to save them from falling\ninto the hands of the base creature that she knew only too well would\nstand in her place as soon as the funeral services had been said over\nher dead body.\n\nStealthily, as if she had been a thief, the sorrowing Senora Moreno\nconveyed her sister's wardrobe, article by article, out of the house, to\nbe sent to her own home. It was the wardrobe of a princess. The Ortegnas\nlavished money always on the women whose hearts they broke; and never\nceased to demand of them that they should sit superbly arrayed in their\nlonely wretchedness.\n\nOne hour after the funeral, with a scant and icy ceremony of farewell\nto her dead sister's husband, Senora Moreno, leading the little\nfour-year-old Ramona by the hand, left the house, and early the next\nmorning set sail for home.\n\nWhen Ortegna discovered that his wife's jewels and valuables of all\nkinds were gone, he fell into a great rage, and sent a messenger off,\npost-haste, with an insulting letter to the Senora Moreno, demanding\ntheir return. For answer, he got a copy of his wife's memoranda of\ninstructions to her sister, giving all the said valuables to her in\ntrust for Ramona; also a letter from Father Salvierderra, upon reading\nwhich he sank into a fit of despondency that lasted a day or two, and\ngave his infamous associates considerable alarm, lest they had lost\ntheir comrade. But he soon shook off the influence, whatever it was, and\nsettled back into his old gait on the same old high-road to the devil.\nFather Salvierderra could alarm him, but not save him.\n\nAnd this was the mystery of Ramona. No wonder the Senora Moreno never\ntold the story. No wonder, perhaps, that she never loved the child. It\nwas a sad legacy, indissolubly linked with memories which had in them\nnothing but bitterness, shame, and sorrow from first to last.\n\nHow much of all this the young Ramona knew or suspected, was locked in\nher own breast. Her Indian blood had as much proud reserve in it as was\never infused into the haughtiest Gonzaga's veins. While she was yet a\nlittle child, she had one day said to the Senora Moreno, \"Senora, why\ndid my mother give me to the Senora Ortegna?\"\n\nTaken unawares, the Senora replied hastily: \"Your mother had nothing\nwhatever to do with it. It was your father.\"\n\n\"Was my mother dead?\" continued the child.\n\nToo late the Senora saw her mistake. \"I do not know,\" she replied; which\nwas literally true, but had the spirit of a lie in it. \"I never saw your\nmother.\"\n\n\"Did the Senora Ortegna ever see her?\" persisted Ramona.\n\n\"No, never,\" answered the Senora, coldly, the old wounds burning at the\ninnocent child's unconscious touch.\n\nRamona felt the chill, and was silent for a time, her face sad, and her\neyes tearful. At last she said, \"I wish I knew if my mother was dead.\"\n\n\"Why?\" asked the Senora.\n\n\"Because if she is not dead I would ask her why she did not want me to\nstay with her.\"\n\nThe gentle piteousness of this reply smote the Senora's conscience.\nTaking the child in her arms, she said, \"Who has been talking to you of\nthese things, Ramona?\"\n\n\"Juan Can,\" she replied.\n\n\"What did he say?\" asked the Senora, with a look in her eye which boded\nno good to Juan Canito.\n\n\"It was not to me he said it, it was to Luigo; but I heard him,\"\nanswered Ramona, speaking slowly, as if collecting her various\nreminiscences on the subject. \"Twice I heard him. He said that my mother\nwas no good, and that my father was bad too.\" And the tears rolled down\nthe child's cheeks.\n\nThe Senora's sense of justice stood her well in place of tenderness,\nnow. Caressing the little orphan as she had never before done, she said,\nwith an earnestness which sank deep into the child's mind, \"Ramona must\nnot believe any such thing as that. Juan Can is a bad man to say it.\nHe never saw either your father or your mother, and so he could know\nnothing about them. I knew your father very well. He was not a bad man.\nHe was my friend, and the friend of the Senora Ortegna; and that was the\nreason he gave you to the Senora Ortegna, because she had no child of\nher own. And I think your mother had a good many.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" said Ramona, relieved, for the moment, at this new view of the\nsituation,--that the gift had been not as a charity to her, but to the\nSenora Ortegna. \"Did the Senora Ortegna want a little daughter very\nmuch?\"\n\n\"Yes, very much indeed,\" said the Senora, heartily and with fervor. \"She\nhad grieved many years because she had no child.\"\n\nSilence again for a brief space, during which the little lonely heart,\ngrappling with its vague instinct of loss and wrong, made wide thrusts\ninto the perplexities hedging it about, and presently electrified the\nSenora by saying in a half-whisper, \"Why did not my father bring me to\nyou first? Did he know you did not want any daughter?\"\n\nThe Senora was dumb for a second; then recovering herself, she said:\n\"Your father was the Senora Ortegna's friend more than he was mine. I\nwas only a child, then.\"\n\n\"Of course you did not need any daughter when you had Felipe,\" continued\nRamona, pursuing her original line of inquiry and reflection without\nnoticing the Senora's reply. \"A son is more than a daughter; but most\npeople have both,\" eying the Senora keenly, to see what response this\nwould bring.\n\nBut the Senora was weary and uncomfortable with the talk. At the very\nmention of Felipe, a swift flash of consciousness of her inability\nto love Ramona had swept through her mind. \"Ramona,\" she said firmly,\n\"while you are a little girl, you cannot understand any of these things.\nWhen you are a woman, I will tell you all that I know myself about your\nfather and your mother. It is very little. Your father died when you\nwere only two years old. All that you have to do is to be a good child,\nand say your prayers, and when Father Salvierderra comes he will be\npleased with you. And he will not be pleased if you ask troublesome\nquestions. Don't ever speak to me again about this. When the proper time\ncomes I will tell you myself.\"\n\nThis was when Ramona was ten. She was now nineteen. She had never again\nasked the Senora a question bearing on the forbidden subject. She had\nbeen a good child and said her prayers, and Father Salvierderra had been\nalways pleased with her, growing more and more deeply attached to her\nyear by year. But the proper time had not yet come for the Senora to\ntell her anything more about her father and mother. There were few\nmornings on which the girl did not think, \"Perhaps it may be to-day\nthat she will tell me.\" But she would not ask. Every word of that\nconversation was as vivid in her mind as it had been the day it\noccurred; and it would hardly be an exaggeration to say that during\nevery day of the whole nine years had deepened in her heart the\nconviction which had prompted the child's question, \"Did he know that\nyou did not want any daughter?\"\n\nA nature less gentle than Ramona's would have been embittered, or at\nleast hardened, by this consciousness. But Ramona's was not. She never\nput it in words to herself. She accepted it, as those born deformed seem\nsometimes to accept the pain and isolation caused by their deformity,\nwith an unquestioning acceptance, which is as far above resignation, as\nresignation is above rebellious repining.\n\nNo one would have known, from Ramona's face, manner, or habitual\nconduct, that she had ever experienced a sorrow or had a care. Her face\nwas sunny, she had a joyous voice, and never was seen to pass a human\nbeing without a cheerful greeting, to highest and lowest the same. Her\nindustry was tireless. She had had two years at school, in the Convent\nof the Sacred Heart at Los Angeles, where the Senora had placed her\nat much personal sacrifice, during one of the hardest times the Moreno\nestate had ever seen. Here she had won the affection of all the Sisters,\nwho spoke of her habitually as the \"blessed child.\" They had taught her\nall the dainty arts of lace-weaving, embroidery, and simple fashions\nof painting and drawing, which they knew; not overmuch learning out of\nbooks, but enough to make her a passionate lover of verse and romance.\nFor serious study or for deep thought she had no vocation. She was a\nsimple, joyous, gentle, clinging, faithful nature, like a clear brook\nrippling along in the sun,--a nature as unlike as possible to the\nSenora's, with its mysterious depths and stormy, hidden currents.\n\nOf these Ramona was dimly conscious, and at times had a tender,\nsorrowful pity for the Senora, which she dared not show, and could only\nexpress by renewed industry, and tireless endeavor to fulfil every duty\npossible in the house. This gentle faithfulness was not wholly lost on\nSenora Moreno, though its source she never suspected; and it won no new\nrecognition from her for Ramona, no increase of love.\n\nBut there was one on whom not an act, not a look, not a smile of all\nthis graciousness was thrown away. That one was Felipe. Daily more and\nmore he wondered at his mother's lack of affection for Ramona. Nobody\nknew so well as he how far short she stopped of loving her. Felipe knew\nwhat it meant, how it felt, to be loved by the Senora Moreno. But Felipe\nhad learned while he was a boy that one sure way to displease his mother\nwas to appear to be aware that she did not treat Ramona as she treated\nhim. And long before he had become a man he had acquired the habit of\nkeeping to himself most of the things he thought and felt about his\nlittle playmate sister,--a dangerous habit, out of which were slowly\nripening bitter fruits for the Senora's gathering in later years.\n\n\n\n\nIV\n\nIT was longer even than the Senora had thought it would be, before\nFather Salvierderra arrived. The old man had grown feeble during the\nyear that she had not seen him, and it was a very short day's journey\nthat he could make now without too great fatigue. It was not only his\nbody that had failed. He had lost heart; and the miles which would have\nbeen nothing to him, had he walked in the companionship of hopeful and\nhappy thoughts, stretched out wearily as he brooded over sad memories\nand still sadder anticipations,--the downfall of the Missions, the loss\nof their vast estates, and the growing power of the ungodly in the land.\nThe final decision of the United States Government in regard to the\nMission-lands had been a terrible blow to him. He had devoutly believed\nthat ultimate restoration of these great estates to the Church was\ninevitable. In the long vigils which he always kept when at home at the\nFranciscan Monastery in Santa Barbara, kneeling on the stone pavement\nin the church, and praying ceaselessly from midnight till dawn, he had\noften had visions vouchsafed him of a new dispensation, in which the\nMission establishments should be reinstated in all their old splendor\nand prosperity, and their Indian converts again numbered by tens of\nthousands.\n\nLong after every one knew that this was impossible, he would narrate\nthese visions with the faith of an old Bible seer, and declare that they\nmust come true, and that it was a sin to despond. But as year after year\nhe journeyed up and down the country, seeing, at Mission after Mission,\nthe buildings crumbling into ruin, the lands all taken, sold, resold,\nand settled by greedy speculators; the Indian converts disappearing,\ndriven back to their original wildernesses, the last traces of the noble\nwork of his order being rapidly swept away, his courage faltered, his\nfaith died out. Changes in the manners and customs of his order itself,\nalso, were giving him deep pain. He was a Franciscan of the same type as\nFrancis of Assisi. To wear a shoe in place of a sandal, to take money in\na purse for a journey, above all to lay aside the gray gown and cowl for\nany sort of secular garment, seemed to him wicked. To own comfortable\nclothes while there were others suffering for want of them--and\nthere were always such--seemed to him a sin for which one might not\nundeservedly be smitten with sudden and terrible punishment. In vain the\nBrothers again and again supplied him with a warm cloak; he gave it away\nto the first beggar he met: and as for food, the refectory would have\nbeen left bare, and the whole brotherhood starving, if the supplies had\nnot been carefully hidden and locked, so that Father Salvierderra could\nnot give them all away. He was fast becoming that most tragic yet often\nsublime sight, a man who has survived, not only his own time, but\nthe ideas and ideals of it. Earth holds no sharper loneliness: the\nbitterness of exile, the anguish of friendlessness at their utmost,\nare in it; and yet it is so much greater than they, that even they seem\nsmall part of it.\n\nIt was with thoughts such as these that Father Salvierderra drew near\nthe home of the Senora Moreno late in the afternoon of one of those\nmidsummer days of which Southern California has so many in spring. The\nalmonds had bloomed and the blossoms fallen; the apricots also, and the\npeaches and pears; on all the orchards of these fruits had come a filmy\ntint of green, so light it was hardly more than a shadow on the gray.\nThe willows were vivid light green, and the orange groves dark and\nglossy like laurel. The billowy hills on either side the valley were\ncovered with verdure and bloom,--myriads of low blossoming plants, so\nclose to the earth that their tints lapped and overlapped on each other,\nand on the green of the grass, as feathers in fine plumage overlap each\nother and blend into a changeful color.\n\nThe countless curves, hollows, and crests of the coast-hills in Southern\nCalifornia heighten these chameleon effects of the spring verdure; they\nare like nothing in nature except the glitter of a brilliant lizard in\nthe sun or the iridescent sheen of a peacock's neck.\n\nFather Salvierderra paused many times to gaze at the beautiful picture.\nFlowers were always dear to the Franciscans. Saint Francis himself\npermitted all decorations which could be made of flowers. He classed\nthem with his brothers and sisters, the sun, moon, and stars,--all\nmembers of the sacred choir praising God.\n\nIt was melancholy to see how, after each one of these pauses, each fresh\ndrinking in of the beauty of the landscape and the balmy air, the old\nman resumed his slow pace, with a long sigh and his eyes cast down.\nThe fairer this beautiful land, the sadder to know it lost to the\nChurch,--alien hands reaping its fulness, establishing new customs,\nnew laws. All the way down the coast from Santa Barbara he had seen,\nat every stopping-place, new tokens of the settling up of the\ncountry,--farms opening, towns growing; the Americans pouring in, at\nall points, to reap the advantages of their new possessions. It was\nthis which had made his journey heavy-hearted, and made him feel, in\napproaching the Senora Moreno's, as if he were coming to one of the last\nsure strongholds of the Catholic faith left in the country.\n\nWhen he was within two miles of the house, he struck off from the\nhighway into a narrow path that he recollected led by a short-cut\nthrough the hills, and saved nearly a third of the distance. It was\nmore than a year since he had trod this path, and as he found it growing\nfainter and fainter, and more and more overgrown with the wild mustard,\nhe said to himself, \"I think no one can have passed through here this\nyear.\"\n\nAs he proceeded he found the mustard thicker and thicker. The wild\nmustard in Southern California is like that spoken of in the New\nTestament, in the branches of which the birds of the air may rest.\nComing up out of the earth, so slender a stem that dozens can find\nstarting-point in an inch, it darts up, a slender straight shoot, five,\nten, twenty feet, with hundreds of fine feathery branches locking\nand interlocking with all the other hundreds around it, till it is an\ninextricable network like lace. Then it bursts into yellow bloom still\nfiner, more feathery and lacelike. The stems are so infinitesimally\nsmall, and of so dark a green, that at a short distance they do not\nshow, and the cloud of blossom seems floating in the air; at times it\nlooks like golden dust. With a clear blue sky behind it, as it is often\nseen, it looks like a golden snow-storm. The plant is a tyrant and a\nnuisance,--the terror of the farmer; it takes riotous possession of a\nwhole field in a season; once in, never out; for one plant this year, a\nmillion the next; but it is impossible to wish that the land were freed\nfrom it. Its gold is as distinct a value to the eye as the nugget gold\nis in the pocket.\n\nFather Salvierderra soon found himself in a veritable thicket of these\ndelicate branches, high above his head, and so interlaced that he could\nmake headway only by slowly and patiently disentangling them, as one\nwould disentangle a skein of silk. It was a fantastic sort of dilemma,\nand not unpleasing. Except that the Father was in haste to reach his\njourney's end, he would have enjoyed threading his way through\nthe golden meshes. Suddenly he heard faint notes of singing. He\npaused,--listened. It was the voice of a woman. It was slowly drawing\nnearer, apparently from the direction in which he was going. At\nintervals it ceased abruptly, then began again; as if by a sudden but\nbrief interruption, like that made by question and answer. Then, peering\nahead through the mustard blossoms, he saw them waving and bending, and\nheard sounds as if they were being broken. Evidently some one entering\non the path from the opposite end had been caught in the fragrant\nthicket as he was. The notes grew clearer, though still low and sweet\nas the twilight notes of the thrush; the mustard branches waved more and\nmore violently; light steps were now to be heard. Father Salvierderra\nstood still as one in a dream, his eyes straining forward into the\ngolden mist of blossoms. In a moment more came, distinct and clear to\nhis ear, the beautiful words of the second stanza of Saint Francis's\ninimitable lyric, \"The Canticle of the Sun:\"\n\n\"Praise be to thee, O Lord, for all thy creatures, and especially for\nour brother the Sun,--who illuminates the day, and by his beauty and\nsplendor shadows forth unto us thine.\"\n\n\"Ramona!\" exclaimed the Father, his thin cheeks flushing with pleasure.\n\"The blessed child!\" And as he spoke, her face came into sight, set in\na swaying frame of the blossoms, as she parted them lightly to right and\nleft with her hands, and half crept, half danced through the loop-hole\nopenings thus made. Father Salvierderra was past eighty, but his blood\nwas not too old to move quicker at the sight of this picture. A man must\nbe dead not to thrill at it. Ramona's beauty was of the sort to be best\nenhanced by the waving gold which now framed her face. She had just\nenough of olive tint in her complexion to underlie and enrich her skin\nwithout making it swarthy. Her hair was like her Indian mother's, heavy\nand black, but her eyes were like her father's, steel-blue. Only those\nwho came very near to Ramona knew, however, that her eyes were blue, for\nthe heavy black eyebrows and long black lashes so shaded and shadowed\nthem that they looked black as night. At the same instant that Father\nSalvierderra first caught sight of her face, Ramona also saw him, and\ncrying out joyfully, \"Ah, Father, I knew you would come by this path,\nand something told me you were near!\" she sprang forward, and sank on\nher knees before him, bowing her head for his blessing. In silence he\nlaid his hands on her brow. It would not have been easy for him to speak\nto her at that first moment. She had looked to the devout old monk, as\nshe sprang through the cloud of golden flowers, the sun falling on\nher bared head, her cheeks flushed, her eyes shining, more like an\napparition of an angel or saint, than like the flesh-and-blood maiden\nwhom he had carried in his arms when she was a babe.\n\n\"We have been waiting, waiting, oh, so long for you, Father!\" she said,\nrising. \"We began to fear that you might be ill. The shearers have been\nsent for, and will be here tonight, and that was the reason I felt so\nsure you would come. I knew the Virgin would bring you in time for mass\nin the chapel on the first morning.\"\n\nThe monk smiled half sadly. \"Would there were more with such faith as\nyours, daughter,\" he said. \"Are all well on the place?\"\n\n\"Yes, Father, all well,\" she answered. \"Felipe has been ill with a\nfever; but he is out now, these ten days, and fretting for--for your\ncoming.\"\n\nRamona had like to have said the literal truth,--\"fretting for the\nsheep-shearing,\" but recollected herself in time.\n\n\"And the Senora?\" said the Father.\n\n\"She is well,\" answered Ramona, gently, but with a slight change of\ntone,--so slight as to be almost imperceptible; but an acute observer\nwould have always detected it in the girl's tone whenever she spoke of\nthe Senora Moreno. \"And you,--are you well yourself, Father?\" she asked\naffectionately, noting with her quick, loving eye how feebly the old\nman walked, and that he carried what she had never before seen in his\nhand,--a stout staff to steady his steps. \"You must be very tired with\nthe long journey on foot.\"\n\n\"Ay, Ramona, I am tired,\" he replied. \"Old age is conquering me. It will\nnot be many times more that I shall see this place.\"\n\n\"Oh, do not say that, Father,\" cried Ramona; \"you can ride, when it\ntires you too much to walk. The Senora said, only the other day, that\nshe wished you would let her give you a horse; that it was not right for\nyou to take these long journeys on foot. You know we have hundreds of\nhorses. It is nothing, one horse,\" she added, seeing the Father slowly\nshake his head.\n\n\"No;\" he said, \"it is not that. I could not refuse anything at the hands\nof the Senora. But it was the rule of our order to go on foot. We\nmust deny the flesh. Look at our beloved master in this land, Father\nJunipero, when he was past eighty, walking from San Diego to Monterey,\nand all the while a running ulcer in one of his legs, for which most men\nwould have taken to a bed, to be healed. It is a sinful fashion that\nis coming in, for monks to take their ease doing God's work. I can no\nlonger walk swiftly, but I must walk all the more diligently.\"\n\nWhile they were talking, they had been slowly moving forward, Ramona\nslightly in advance, gracefully bending the mustard branches, and\nholding them down till the Father had followed in her steps. As they\ncame out from the thicket, she exclaimed, laughing, \"There is Felipe, in\nthe willows. I told him I was coming to meet you, and he laughed at me.\nNow he will see I was right.\"\n\nAstonished enough, Felipe, hearing voices, looked up, and saw Ramona and\nthe Father approaching. Throwing down the knife with which he had been\ncutting the willows, he hastened to meet them, and dropped on his knees,\nas Ramona had done, for the monk's blessing. As he knelt there, the wind\nblowing his hair loosely off his brow, his large brown eyes lifted in\ngentle reverence to the Father's face, and his face full of affectionate\nwelcome, Ramona thought to herself, as she had thought hundreds of times\nsince she became a woman, \"How beautiful Felipe is! No wonder the Senora\nloves him so much! If I had been beautiful like that she would have\nliked me better.\" Never was a little child more unconscious of her own\nbeauty than Ramona still was. All the admiration which was expressed\nto her in word and look she took for simple kindness and good-will.\nHer face, as she herself saw it in her glass, did not please her. She\ncompared her straight, massive black eyebrows with Felipe's, arched and\ndelicately pencilled, and found her own ugly. The expression of gentle\nrepose which her countenance wore, seemed to her an expression of\nstupidity. \"Felipe looks so bright!\" she thought, as she noted his\nmobile changing face, never for two successive seconds the same. \"There\nis nobody like Felipe.\" And when his brown eyes were fixed on her, as\nthey so often were, in a long lingering gaze, she looked steadily back\ninto their velvet depths with an abstracted sort of intensity which\nprofoundly puzzled Felipe. It was this look, more than any other one\nthing, which had for two years held Felipe's tongue in leash, as it\nwere, and made it impossible for him to say to Ramona any of the loving\nthings of which his heart had been full ever since he could remember.\nThe boy had spoken them unhesitatingly, unconsciously; but the man found\nhimself suddenly afraid. \"What is it she thinks when she looks into my\neyes so?\" he wondered. If he had known that the thing she was usually\nthinking was simply, \"How much handsomer brown eyes are than blue!\nI wish my eyes were the color of Felipe's!\" he would have perceived,\nperhaps, what would have saved him sorrow, if he had known it, that a\ngirl who looked at a man thus, would be hard to win to look at him as a\nlover. But being a lover, he could not see this. He saw only enough to\nperplex and deter him.\n\nAs they drew near the house, Ramona saw Margarita standing at the gate\nof the garden. She was holding something white in her hands, looking\ndown at it, and crying piteously. As she perceived Ramona, she made an\neager leap forward, and then shrank back again, making dumb signals\nof distress to her. Her whole attitude was one of misery and entreaty.\nMargarita was, of all the maids, most beloved by Ramona. Though they\nwere nearly of the same age, it had been Margarita who first had charge\nof Ramona; the nurse and her charge had played together, grown up\ntogether, become women together, and were now, although Margarita never\npresumed on the relation, or forgot to address Ramona as Senorita, more\nlike friends than like mistress and maid.\n\n\"Pardon me, Father,\" said Ramona. \"I see that Margarita there is in\ntrouble. I will leave Felipe to go with you to the house. I will be with\nyou again in a few moments.\" And kissing his hand, she flew rather than\nran across the field to the foot of the garden.\n\nBefore she reached the spot, Margarita had dropped on the ground and\nburied her face in her hands. A mass of crumpled and stained linen lay\nat her feet.\n\n\"What is it? What has happened, Margarita mia?\" cried Ramona, in the\naffectionate Spanish phrase. For answer, Margarita removed one wet hand\nfrom her eyes, and pointed with a gesture of despair to the crumpled\nlinen. Sobs choked her voice, and she buried her face again in her\nhands.\n\nRamona stooped, and lifted one corner of the linen. An involuntary cry\nof dismay broke from her, at which Margarita's sobs redoubled, and\nshe gasped out, \"Yes, Senorita, it is totally ruined! It can never be\nmended, and it will be needed for the mass to-morrow morning. When I saw\nthe Father coming by your side, I prayed to the Virgin to let me die.\nThe Senora will never forgive me.\"\n\nIt was indeed a sorry sight. The white linen altar-cloth, the cloth\nwhich the Senora Moreno had with her own hands made into one solid front\nof beautiful lace of the Mexican fashion, by drawing out part of the\nthreads and sewing the remainder into intricate patterns, the\ncloth which had always been on the altar, when mass was said, since\nMargarita's and Ramona's earliest recollections,--there it lay, torn,\nstained, as if it had been dragged through muddy brambles. In silence,\naghast, Ramona opened it out and held it up. \"How did it happen,\nMargarita?\" she whispered, glancing in terror up towards the house.\n\n\"Oh, that is the worst of it, Senorita!\" sobbed the girl. \"That is the\nworst of it! If it were not for that, I would not be so afraid. If it\nhad happened any other way, the Senora might have forgiven me; but she\nnever will. I would rather die than tell her;\" and she shook from head\nto foot.\n\n\"Stop crying, Margarita!\" said Ramona, firmly, \"and tell me all about\nit. It isn't so bad as it looks. I think I can mend it.\"\n\n\"Oh, the saints bless you!\" cried Margarita, looking up for the first\ntime. \"Do you really think you can mend it, Senorita? If you will mend\nthat lace, I'll go on my knees for you all the rest of my life!\"\n\nRamona laughed in spite of herself. \"You'll serve me better by keeping\non your feet,\" she said merrily; at which Margarita laughed too, through\nher tears. They were both young.\n\n\"Oh, but Senorita,\" Margarita began again in a tone of anguish, her\ntears flowing afresh, \"there is not time! It must be washed and ironed\nto-night, for the mass to-morrow morning, and I have to help at the\nsupper. Anita and Rosa are both ill in bed, you know, and Maria has gone\naway for a week. The Senora said if the Father came to-night I must help\nmother, and must wait on table. It cannot be done. I was just going\nto iron it now, and I found it--so--It was in the artichoke-patch, and\nCapitan, the beast, had been tossing it among the sharp pricks of the\nold last year's seeds.\"\n\n\"In the artichoke-patch!\" ejaculated Ramona. \"How under heavens did it\nget there?\"\n\n\"Oh, that was what I meant, Senorita, when I said she never would\nforgive me. She has forbidden me many times to hang anything to dry on\nthe fence there; and if I had only washed it when she first told me, two\ndays ago, all would have been well. But I forgot it till this afternoon,\nand there was no sun in the court to dry it, and you know how the sun\nlies on the artichoke-patch, and I put a strong cloth over the fence,\nso that the wood should not pierce the lace, and I did not leave it more\nthan half an hour, just while I said a few words to Luigo, and there\nwas no wind; and I believe the saints must have fetched it down to the\nground to punish me for my disobedience.\"\n\nRamona had been all this time carefully smoothing out the torn places,\n\"It is not so bad as it looks,\" she said; \"if it were not for the hurry,\nthere would be no trouble in mending it. But I will do it the best I\ncan, so that it will not show, for to-morrow, and then, after the Father\nis gone, I can repair it at leisure, and make it just as good as new.\nI think I can mend it and wash it before dark,\" and she glanced at the\nsun. \"Oh, yes, there are good three hours of daylight yet. I can do it.\nYou put the irons on the fire, to have them hot, to iron it as soon\nas it is partly dried. You will see it will not show that anything has\nhappened to it.\"\n\n\"Will the Senora know?\" asked poor Margarita, calmed and reassured, but\nstill in mortal terror.\n\nRamona turned her steady glance full on Margarita's face. \"You would not\nbe any happier if she were deceived, do you think?\" she said gravely.\n\n\"O Senorita, after it is mended? If it really does not show?\" pleaded\nthe girl.\n\n\"I will tell her myself, and not till after it is mended,\" said Ramona;\nbut she did not smile.\n\n\"Ah, Senorita,\" said Margarita, deprecatingly, \"you do not know what it\nis to have the Senora displeased with one.\"\n\n\"Nothing can be so bad as to be displeased with one's self,\" retorted\nRamona, as she walked swiftly away to her room with the linen rolled up\nunder her arm. Luckily for Margarita's cause, she met no one on the way.\nThe Senora had welcomed Father Salvierderra at the foot of the veranda\nsteps, and had immediately closeted herself with him. She had much to\nsay to him,--much about which she wished his help and counsel, and much\nwhich she wished to learn from him as to affairs in the Church and in\nthe country generally.\n\nFelipe had gone off at once to find Juan Canito, to see if everything\nwere ready for the sheep-shearing to begin on the next day, if the\nshearers arrived in time; and there was very good chance of their coming\nin by sundown this day, Felipe thought, for he had privately instructed\nhis messenger to make all possible haste, and to impress on the Indians\nthe urgent need of their losing no time on the road.\n\nIt had been a great concession on the Senora's part to allow the\nmessenger to be sent off before she had positive intelligence as to the\nFather's movements. But as day after day passed and no news came, even\nshe perceived that it would not do to put off the sheep-shearing much\nlonger, or, as Juan Canito said, \"forever.\" The Father might have fallen\nill; and if that were so, it might very easily be weeks before they\nheard of it, so scanty were the means of communication between the\nremote places on his route of visitation. The messenger had therefore\nbeen sent to summon the Temecula shearers, and Senora had resigned\nherself to the inevitable; piously praying, however, morning and night,\nand at odd moments in the day, that the Father might arrive before the\nIndians did. When she saw him coming up the garden-walk, leaning on\nthe arm of her Felipe, on the afternoon of the very day which was the\nearliest possible day for the Indians to arrive, it was not strange that\nshe felt, mingled with the joy of her greeting to her long-loved friend\nand confessor, a triumphant exultation that the saints had heard her\nprayers.\n\nIn the kitchen all was bustle and stir. The coming of any guest into the\nhouse was a signal for unwonted activities there,--even the coming of\nFather Salvierderra, who never knew whether the soup had force-meat\nballs in it or not, old Marda said; and that was to her the last extreme\nof indifference to good things of the flesh. \"But if he will not eat,\nhe can see,\" she said; and her pride for herself and for the house was\nenlisted in setting forth as goodly an array of viands as her larder\nafforded, She grew suddenly fastidious over the size and color of the\ncabbages to go into the beef-pot, and threw away one whole saucepan full\nof rice, because Margarita had put only one onion in instead of two.\n\n\"Have I not told you again and again that for the Father it is always\ntwo onions?\" she exclaimed. \"It is the dish he most favors of all; and\nit is a pity too, old as he is. It makes him no blood. It is good beef\nhe should take now.\"\n\nThe dining-room was on the opposite side of the courtyard from the\nkitchen, and there was a perpetual procession of small messengers going\nback and forth between the rooms. It was the highest ambition of each\nchild to be allowed to fetch and carry dishes in the preparation of\nthe meals at all times; but when by so doing they could perchance get a\nglimpse through the dining-room door, open on the veranda, of strangers\nand guests, their restless rivalry became unmanageable. Poor Margarita,\nbetween her own private anxieties and her multiplied duties of helping\nin the kitchen, and setting the table, restraining and overseeing her\narmy of infant volunteers, was nearly distraught; not so distraught,\nhowever, but that she remembered and found time to seize a lighted\ncandle in the kitchen, run and set it before the statue of Saint Francis\nof Paula in her bedroom, hurriedly whispering a prayer that the lace\nmight be made whole like new. Several times before the afternoon had\nwaned she snatched a moment to fling herself down at the statue's feet\nand pray her foolish little prayer over again. We think we are quite\nsure that it is a foolish little prayer, when people pray to have torn\nlace made whole. But it would be hard to show the odds between asking\nthat, and asking that it may rain, or that the sick may get well. As the\ngrand old Russian says, what men usually ask for, when they pray to God,\nis, that two and two may not make four. All the same he is to be pitied\nwho prays not. It was only the thought of that candle at Saint Francis's\nfeet, which enabled Margarita to struggle through this anxious and\nunhappy afternoon and evening.\n\nAt last supper was ready,--a great dish of spiced beef and cabbage in\nthe centre of the table; a tureen of thick soup, with force-meat balls\nand red peppers in it; two red earthen platters heaped, one with the\nboiled rice and onions, the other with the delicious frijoles (beans)\nso dear to all Mexican hearts; cut-glass dishes filled with hot stewed\npears, or preserved quinces, or grape jelly; plates of frosted cakes of\nvarious sorts; and a steaming silver teakettle, from which went up an\naroma of tea such as had never been bought or sold in all California,\nthe Senora's one extravagance and passion.\n\n\"Where is Ramona?\" asked the Senora, surprised and displeased, as she\nentered the dining-room, \"Margarita, go tell the Senorita that we are\nwaiting for her.\"\n\nMargarita started tremblingly, with flushed face, towards the door. What\nwould happen now! \"O Saint Francis,\" she inwardly prayed, \"help us this\nonce!\"\n\n\"Stay,\" said Felipe. \"Do not call Senorita Ramona.\" Then, turning to his\nmother, \"Ramona cannot come. She is not in the house. She has a duty to\nperform for to-morrow,\" he said; and he looked meaningly at his mother,\nadding, \"we will not wait for her.\"\n\nMuch bewildered, the Senora took her seat at the head of the table in a\nmechanical way, and began, \"But--\" Felipe, seeing that questions were to\nfollow, interrupted her: \"I have just spoken with her. It is impossible\nfor her to come;\" and turning to Father Salvierderra, he at once engaged\nhim in conversation, and left the baffled Senora to bear her unsatisfied\ncuriosity as best she could.\n\nMargarita looked at Felipe with an expression of profound gratitude,\nwhich he did not observe, and would not in the least have understood;\nfor Ramona had not confided to him any details of the disaster. Seeing\nhim under her window, she had called cautiously to him, and said: \"Dear\nFelipe, do you think you can save me from having to come to supper? A\ndreadful accident has happened to the altar-cloth, and I must mend it\nand wash it, and there is barely time before dark. Don't let them call\nme; I shall be down at the brook, and they will not find me, and your\nmother will be displeased.\"\n\nThis wise precaution of Ramona's was the salvation of everything, so far\nas the altar-cloth was concerned. The rents had proved far less serious\nthan she had feared; the daylight held out till the last of them was\nskilfully mended; and just as the red beams of the sinking sun came\nstreaming through the willow-trees at the foot of the garden, Ramona,\ndarting down the garden, had reached the brook, and kneeling on the\ngrass, had dipped the linen into the water.\n\nHer hurried working over the lace, and her anxiety, had made her cheeks\nscarlet. As she ran down the garden, her comb had loosened and her hair\nfallen to her waist. Stopping only to pick up the comb and thrust it in\nher pocket, she had sped on, as it would soon be too dark for her to see\nthe stains on the linen, and it was going to be no small trouble to get\nthem out without fraying the lace.\n\nHer hair in disorder, her sleeves pinned loosely on her shoulders, her\nwhole face aglow with the earnestness of her task, she bent low over\nthe stones, rinsing the altar-cloth up and down in the water, anxiously\nscanning it, then plunging it in again.\n\nThe sunset beams played around her hair like a halo; the whole place was\naglow with red light, and her face was kindled into transcendent beauty.\nA sound arrested her attention. She looked up. Forms, dusky black\nagainst the fiery western sky, were coming down the valley. It was the\nband of Indian shearers. They turned to the left, and went towards the\nsheep sheds and booths. But there was one of them that Ramona did not\nsee. He had been standing for some minutes concealed behind a large\nwillow-tree a few rods from the place where Ramona was kneeling. It was\nAlessandro, son of Pablo Assis, captain of the shearing band. Walking\nslowly along in advance of his men, he had felt a light, as from a\nmirror held in the sun, smite his eyes. It was the red sunbeam on the\nglittering water where Ramona knelt. In the same second he saw Ramona.\n\nHe halted, as wild creatures of the forest halt at a sound; gazed;\nwalked abruptly away from his men, who kept on, not noticing his\ndisappearance. Cautiously he moved a few steps nearer, into the shelter\nof a gnarled old willow, from behind which he could gaze unperceived on\nthe beautiful vision,--for so it seemed to him.\n\nAs he gazed, his senses seemed leaving him, and unconsciously he spoke\naloud; \"Christ! What shall I do!\"\n\n\n\n\nV\n\nTHE room in which Father Salvierderra always slept when at the Senora\nMoreno's house was the southeast corner room. It had a window to the\nsouth and one to the east. When the first glow of dawn came in the sky,\nthis eastern window was lit up as by a fire. The Father was always on\nwatch for it, having usually been at prayer for hours. As the first ray\nreached the window, he would throw the casement wide open, and standing\nthere with bared head, strike up the melody of the sunrise hymn sung in\nall devout Mexican families. It was a beautiful custom, not yet wholly\nabandoned. At the first dawn of light, the oldest member of the family\narose, and began singing some hymn familiar to the household. It was the\nduty of each person hearing it to immediately rise, or at least sit up\nin bed, and join in the singing. In a few moments the whole family would\nbe singing, and the joyous sounds pouring out from the house like\nthe music of the birds in the fields at dawn. The hymns were usually\ninvocations to the Virgin, or to the saint of the day, and the melodies\nwere sweet and simple.\n\nOn this morning there was another watcher for the dawn besides Father\nSalvierderra. It was Alessandro, who had been restlessly wandering about\nsince midnight, and had finally seated himself under the willow-trees by\nthe brook, at the spot where he had seen Ramona the evening before. He\nrecollected this custom of the sunrise hymn when he and his band were\nat the Senora's the last year, and he had chanced then to learn that the\nFather slept in the southeast room. From the spot where he sat, he could\nsee the south window of this room. He could also see the low eastern\nhorizon, at which a faint luminous line already showed. The sky was like\namber; a few stars still shone faintly in the zenith. There was not\na sound. It was one of those rare moments in which one can without\ndifficulty realize the noiseless spinning of the earth through space.\nAlessandro knew nothing of this; he could not have been made to believe\nthat the earth was moving. He thought the sun was coming up apace,\nand the earth was standing still,--a belief just as grand, just as\nthrilling, so far as all that goes, as the other: men worshipped the sun\nlong before they found out that it stood still. Not the most reverent\nastronomer, with the mathematics of the heavens at his tongue's end,\ncould have had more delight in the wondrous phenomenon of the dawn, than\ndid this simple-minded, unlearned man.\n\nHis eyes wandered from the horizon line of slowly increasing light, to\nthe windows of the house, yet dark and still. \"Which window is hers?\nWill she open it when the song begins?\" he thought. \"Is it on this side\nof the house? Who can she be? She was not here last year. Saw the saints\never so beautiful a creature!\"\n\nAt last came the full red ray across the meadow. Alessandro sprang to\nhis feet. In the next second Father Salvierderra flung up his south\nwindow, and leaning out, his cowl thrown off, his thin gray locks\nstreaming back, began in a feeble but not unmelodious voice to sing,--\n\n     \"O beautiful Queen,\n     Princess of Heaven.\"\n\nBefore he had finished the second line, a half-dozen voices had joined\nin,--the Senora, from her room at the west end of the veranda, beyond\nthe flowers; Felipe, from the adjoining room; Ramona, from hers, the\nnext; and Margarita and other of the maids already astir in the wings of\nthe house. As the volume of melody swelled, the canaries waked, and the\nfinches and the linnets in the veranda roof. The tiles of this roof were\nlaid on bundles of tule reeds, in which the linnets delighted to build\ntheir nests. The roof was alive with them,--scores and scores, nay\nhundreds, tame as chickens; their tiny shrill twitter was like the\ntuning of myriads of violins.\n\n     \"Singers at dawn\n     From the heavens above\n     People all regions;\n     Gladly we too sing,\"\n\ncontinued the hymn, the birds corroborating the stanza. Then men's\nvoices joined in,--Juan and Luigo, and a dozen more, walking slowly up\nfrom the sheepfolds. The hymn was a favorite one, known to all.\n\n     \"Come, O sinners,\n     Come, and we will sing\n     Tender hymns\n     To our refuge,\"\n\nwas the chorus, repeated after each of the five verses of the hymn.\n\nAlessandro also knew the hymn well. His father, Chief Pablo, had been\nthe leader of the choir at the San Luis Rey Mission in the last years of\nits splendor, and had brought away with him much of the old choir music.\nSome of the books had been written by his own hand, on parchment. He not\nonly sang well, but was a good player on the violin. There was not at\nany of the Missions so fine a band of performers on stringed instruments\nas at San Luis Rey. Father Peyri was passionately fond of music, and\nspared no pains in training all the neophytes under his charge who\nshowed any special talent in that direction. Chief Pablo, after the\nbreaking up of the Mission, had settled at Temecula, with a small band\nof his Indians, and endeavored, so far as was in his power, to keep\nup the old religious services. The music in the little chapel of the\nTemecula Indians was a surprise to all who heard it.\n\nAlessandro had inherited his father's love and talent for music, and\nknew all the old Mission music by heart. This hymn to the\n\n     \"Beautiful Queen,\n     Princess of Heaven,\"\n\nwas one of his special favorites; and as he heard verse after verse\nrising, he could not forbear striking in.\n\nAt the first notes of this rich new voice, Ramona's voice ceased in\nsurprise; and, throwing up her window, she leaned out, eagerly looking\nin all directions to see who it could be. Alessandro saw her, and sang\nno more.\n\n\"What could it have been? Did I dream it?\" thought Ramona, drew in her\nhead, and began to sing again.\n\nWith the next stanza of the chorus, the same rich barytone notes. They\nseemed to float in under all the rest, and bear them along, as a great\nwave bears a boat. Ramona had never heard such a voice. Felipe had\na good tenor, and she liked to sing with him, or to hear him; but\nthis--this was from another world, this sound. Ramona felt every note of\nit penetrating her consciousness with a subtle thrill almost like pain.\nWhen the hymn ended, she listened eagerly, hoping Father Salvierderra\nwould strike up a second hymn, as he often did; but he did not this\nmorning; there was too much to be done; everybody was in a hurry to\nbe at work: windows shut, doors opened; the sounds of voices from all\ndirections, ordering, questioning, answering, began to be heard. The sun\nrose and let a flood of work-a-day light on the whole place.\n\nMargarita ran and unlocked the chapel door, putting up a heartfelt\nthanksgiving to Saint Francis and the Senorita, as she saw the snowy\naltar-cloth in its place, looking, from that distance at least, as good\nas new.\n\nThe Indians and the shepherds, and laborers of all sorts, were coming\ntowards the chapel. The Senora, with her best black silk handkerchief\nbound tight around her forehead, the ends hanging down each side of her\nface, making her look like an Assyrian priestess, was descending the\nveranda steps, Felipe at her side; and Father Salvierderra had already\nentered the chapel before Ramona appeared, or Alessandro stirred from\nhis vantage-post of observation at the willows.\n\nWhen Ramona came out from the door she bore in her hands a high silver\nurn filled with ferns. She had been for many days gathering and hoarding\nthese. They were hard to find, growing only in one place in a rocky\ncanon, several miles away.\n\nAs she stepped from the veranda to the ground, Alessandro walked slowly\nup the garden-walk, facing her. She met his eyes, and, without knowing\nwhy, thought, \"That must be the Indian who sang.\" As she turned to the\nright and entered the chapel, Alessandro followed her hurriedly, and\nknelt on the stones close to the chapel door. He would be near when she\ncame out. As he looked in at the door, he saw her glide up the aisle,\nplace the ferns on the reading-desk, and then kneel down by Felipe in\nfront of the altar. Felipe turned towards her, smiling slightly, with a\nlook as of secret intelligence.\n\n\"Ah, Senor Felipe has married. She is his wife,\" thought Alessandro, and\na strange pain seized him. He did not analyze it; hardly knew what it\nmeant. He was only twenty-one. He had not thought much about women. He\nwas a distant, cold boy, his own people of the Temecula village said.\nIt had come, they believed, of learning to read, which was always bad.\nChief Pablo had not done his son any good by trying to make him like\nwhite men. If the Fathers could have stayed, and the life at the Mission\nhave gone on, why, Alessandro could have had work to do for the Fathers,\nas his father had before him. Pablo had been Father Peyri's right-hand\nman at the Mission; had kept all the accounts about the cattle; paid the\nwages; handled thousands of dollars of gold every month. But that was\n\"in the time of the king;\" it was very different now. The Americans\nwould not let an Indian do anything but plough and sow and herd cattle.\nA man need not read and write, to do that.\n\nEven Pablo sometimes doubted whether he had done wisely in teaching\nAlessandro all he knew himself. Pablo was, for one of his race, wise and\nfar-seeing. He perceived the danger threatening his people on all sides.\nFather Peyri, before he left the country, had said to him: \"Pablo, your\npeople will be driven like sheep to the slaughter, unless you keep them\ntogether. Knit firm bonds between them; band them into pueblos; make\nthem work; and above all, keep peace with the whites. It is your only\nchance.\"\n\nMost strenuously Pablo had striven to obey Father Peyri's directions. He\nhad set his people the example of constant industry, working steadily in\nhis fields and caring well for his herds. He had built a chapel in his\nlittle village, and kept up forms of religious service there. Whenever\nthere were troubles with the whites, or rumors of them, he went from\nhouse to house, urging, persuading, commanding his people to keep the\npeace. At one time when there was an insurrection of some of the Indian\ntribes farther south, and for a few days it looked as if there would\nbe a general Indian war, he removed the greater part of his band, men,\nwomen, and children driving their flocks and herds with them, to\nLos Angeles, and camped there for several days, that they might be\nidentified with the whites in case hostilities became serious.\n\nBut his labors did not receive the reward that they deserved. With every\nday that the intercourse between his people and the whites increased,\nhe saw the whites gaining, his people surely losing ground, and his\nanxieties deepened. The Mexican owner of the Temecula valley, a friend\nof Father Peyri's, and a good friend also of Pablo's, had returned\nto Mexico in disgust with the state of affairs in California, and was\nreported to be lying at the point of death. This man's promise to Pablo,\nthat he and his people should always live in the valley undisturbed,\nwas all the title Pablo had to the village lands. In the days when the\npromise was given, it was all that was necessary. The lines marking off\nthe Indians' lands were surveyed, and put on the map of the estate. No\nMexican proprietor ever broke faith with an Indian family or village,\nthus placed on his lands.\n\nBut Pablo had heard rumors, which greatly disquieted him, that such\npledges and surveyed lines as these were corning to be held as of no\nvalue, not binding on purchasers of grants. He was intelligent enough\nto see that if this were so, he and his people were ruined. All these\nperplexities and fears he confided to Alessandro; long anxious hours the\nfather and son spent together, walking back and forth in the village, or\nsitting in front of their little adobe house, discussing what could be\ndone. There was always the same ending to the discussion,--a long sigh,\nand, \"We must wait, we can do nothing.\"\n\nNo wonder Alessandro seemed, to the more ignorant and thoughtless young\nmen and women of his village, a cold and distant lad. He was made old\nbefore his time. He was carrying in his heart burdens of which they\nknew nothing. So long as the wheat fields came up well, and there was\nno drought, and the horses and sheep had good pasture, in plenty, on the\nhills, the Temecula people could be merry, go day by day to their easy\nwork, play games at sunset, and sleep sound all night. But Alessandro\nand his father looked beyond. And this was the one great reason why\nAlessandro had not yet thought about women, in way of love; this,\nand also the fact that even the little education he had received was\nsufficient to raise a slight barrier, of which he was unconsciously\naware, between him and the maidens of the village. If a quick, warm\nfancy for any one of them ever stirred in his veins, he found himself\nsoon, he knew not how, cured of it. For a dance, or a game, or a\nfriendly chat, for the trips into the mountains after acorns, or to the\nmarshes for grasses and reeds, he was their good comrade, and they were\nhis; but never had the desire to take one of them for his wife, entered\ninto Alessandro's mind. The vista of the future, for him, was filled\nfull by thoughts which left no room for love's dreaming; one purpose and\none fear filled it,--the purpose to be his father's worthy successor,\nfor Pablo was old now, and very feeble; the fear, that exile and ruin\nwere in store for them all.\n\nIt was of these things he had been thinking as be walked alone, in\nadvance of his men, on the previous night, when he first saw Ramona\nkneeling at the brook. Between that moment and the present, it seemed\nto Alessandro that some strange miracle must have happened to him. The\npurposes and the fears had alike gone. A face replaced them; a vague\nwonder, pain, joy, he knew not what, filled him so to overflowing that\nhe was bewildered. If he had been what the world calls a civilized man,\nhe would have known instantly and would have been capable of weighing,\nanalyzing, and reflecting on his sensations at leisure. But he was not\na civilized man; he had to bring to bear on his present situation only\nsimple, primitive, uneducated instincts and impulses. If Ramona had been\na maiden of his own people or race, he would have drawn near to her as\nquickly as iron to the magnet. But now, if he had gone so far as to even\nthink of her in such a way, she would have been, to his view, as far\nremoved from him as was the morning star beneath whose radiance he had\nthat morning watched, hoping for sight of her at her window. He did not,\nhowever, go so far as to thus think of her. Even that would have\nbeen impossible. He only knelt on the stones outside the chapel door,\nmechanically repeating the prayers with the rest, waiting for her to\nreappear. He had no doubt, now, that she was Senor Felipe's wife; all\nthe same he wished to kneel there till she came out, that he might see\nher face again. His vista of purpose, fear, hope, had narrowed now down\nto that,--just one more sight of her. Ever so civilized, he could hardly\nhave worshipped a woman better. The mass seemed to him endlessly long.\nUntil near the last, he forgot to sing; then, in the closing of the\nfinal hymn, he suddenly remembered, and the clear deep-toned voice\npealed out, as before, like the undertone of a great sea-wave, sweeping\nalong.\n\nRamona heard the first note, and felt again the same thrill. She was as\nmuch a musician born as Alessandro himself. As she rose from her knees,\nshe whispered to Felipe: \"Felipe, do find out which one of the Indians\nit is has that superb voice. I never heard anything like it.\"\n\n\"Oh, that is Alessandro,\" replied Felipe, \"old Pablo's son. He is a\nsplendid fellow. Don't you recollect his singing two years ago?\"\n\n\"I was not here,\" replied Ramona; \"you forget.\"\n\n\"Ah, yes, so you were away; I had forgotten,\" said Felipe. \"Well, he\nwas here. They made him captain of the shearing-band, though he was only\ntwenty, and he managed the men splendidly. They saved nearly all their\nmoney to carry home, and I never knew them do such a thing before.\nFather Salvierderra was here, which might have had something to do with\nit; but I think it was quite as much Alessandro. He plays the violin\nbeautifully. I hope he has brought it along. He plays the old San Luis\nRey music. His father was band-master there.\"\n\nRamona's eyes kindled with pleasure. \"Does your mother like it, to have\nhim play?\" she asked.\n\nFelipe nodded. \"We'll have him up on the veranda tonight,\" he said.\n\nWhile this whispered colloquy was going on, the chapel had emptied,\nthe Indians and Mexicans all hurrying out to set about the day's work.\nAlessandro lingered at the doorway as long as he dared, till he was\nsharply called by Juan Canito, looking back: \"What are you gaping at\nthere, you Alessandro! Hurry, now, and get your men to work. After\nwaiting till near midsummer for this shearing, we'll make as quick work\nof it as we can. Have you got your best shearers here?\"\n\n\"Ay, that I have,\" answered Alessandro; \"not a man of them but can shear\nhis hundred in a day, There is not such a band as ours in all San Diego\nCounty; and we don't turn out the sheep all bleeding, either; you'll see\nscarce a scratch on their sides.\"\n\n\"Humph.\" retorted Juan Can. \"'Tis a poor shearer, indeed, that draws\nblood to speak of. I've sheared many a thousand sheep in my day, and\nnever a red stain on the shears. But the Mexicans have always been famed\nfor good shearers.\"\n\nJuan's invidious emphasis on the word \"Mexicans\" did not escape\nAlessandro. \"And we Indians also,\" he answered, good-naturedly,\nbetraying no annoyance; \"but as for these Americans, I saw one at work\nthe other day, that man Lomax, who settled near Temecula, and upon my\nfaith, Juan Can, I thought it was a slaughter-pen, and not a shearing.\nThe poor beasts limped off with the blood running.\"\n\nJuan did not see his way clear at the moment to any fitting rejoinder to\nthis easy assumption, on Alessandro's part, of the equal superiority\nof Indians and Mexicans in the sheep-shearing art; so, much vexed, with\nanother \"Humph!\" he walked away; walked away so fast, that he lost the\nsight of a smile on Alessandro's face, which would have vexed him still\nfurther.\n\nAt the sheep-shearing sheds and pens all was stir and bustle. The\nshearing shed was a huge caricature of a summerhouse,--a long, narrow\nstructure, sixty feet long by twenty or thirty wide, all roof and\npillars; no walls; the supports, slender rough posts, as far apart\nas was safe, for the upholding of the roof, which was of rough planks\nloosely laid from beam to beam. On three sides of this were the\nsheep-pens filled with sheep and lambs.\n\nA few rods away stood the booths in which the shearers' food was to be\ncooked and the shearers fed. These were mere temporary affairs, roofed\nonly by willow boughs with the leaves left on. Near these, the Indians\nhad already arranged their camp; a hut or two of green boughs had\nbeen built, but for the most part they would sleep rolled up in their\nblankets, on the ground. There was a brisk wind, and the gay colored\nwings of the windmill blew furiously round and round, pumping out into\nthe tank below a stream of water so swift and strong, that as the men\ncrowded around, wetting and sharpening their knives, they got well\nspattered, and had much merriment, pushing and elbowing each other into\nthe spray.\n\nA high four-posted frame stood close to the shed; in this, swung from\nthe four corners, hung one of the great sacking bags in which the\nfleeces were to be packed. A big pile of bags lay on the ground at the\nfoot of the posts. Juan Can eyed them with a chuckle. \"We'll fill more\nthan those before night, Senor Felipe,\" he said. He was in his element,\nJuan Can, at shearing times. Then came his reward for the somewhat\nmonotonous and stupid year's work. The world held no better feast for\nhis eyes than the sight of a long row of big bales of fleece, tied,\nstamped with the Moreno brand, ready to be drawn away to the mills.\n\"Now, there is something substantial,\" he thought; \"no chance of wool\ngoing amiss in market!\"\n\nIf a year's crop were good, Juan's happiness was assured for the next\nsix months. If it proved poor, he turned devout immediately, and\nspent the next six months calling on the saints for better luck, and\nredoubling his exertions with the sheep.\n\nOn one of the posts of the shed short projecting slats were nailed, like\nhalf-rounds of a ladder. Lightly as a rope-walker Felipe ran up these,\nto the roof, and took his stand there, ready to take the fleeces and\npack them in the bag as fast as they should be tossed up from below.\nLuigo, with a big leathern wallet fastened in front of him, filled with\nfive-cent pieces, took his stand in the centre of the shed. The thirty\nshearers, running into the nearest pen, dragged each his sheep into\nthe shed, in a twinkling of an eye had the creature between his knees,\nhelpless, immovable, and the sharp sound of the shears set in. The\nsheep-shearing had begun. No rest now. Not a second's silence from the\nbleating, baa-ing, opening and shutting, clicking, sharpening of shears,\nflying of fleeces through the air to the roof, pressing and stamping\nthem down in the bales; not a second's intermission, except the hour of\nrest at noon, from sunrise till sunset, till the whole eight thousand\nof the Senora Moreno's sheep were shorn. It was a dramatic spectacle. As\nsoon as a sheep was shorn, the shearer ran with the fleece in his\nhand to Luigo, threw it down on a table, received his five-cent piece,\ndropped it in his pocket, ran to the pen, dragged out another sheep, and\nin less than five minutes was back again with a second fleece. The shorn\nsheep, released, bounded off into another pen, where, light in the head\nno doubt from being three to five pounds lighter on their legs, they\ntrotted round bewilderedly for a moment, then flung up their heels and\ncapered for joy.\n\nIt was warm work. The dust from the fleeces and the trampling feet\nfilled the air. As the sun rose higher in the sky the sweat poured off\nthe men's faces; and Felipe, standing without shelter on the roof, found\nout very soon that he had by no means yet got back his full strength\nsince the fever. Long before noon, except for sheer pride, and for\nthe recollection of Juan Canito's speech, he would have come down and\nyielded his place to the old man. But he was resolved not to give up,\nand he worked on, though his face was purple and his head throbbing.\nAfter the bag of fleeces is half full, the packer stands in it, jumping\nwith his full weight on the wool, as he throws in the fleeces, to\ncompress them as much as possible. When Felipe began to do this, he\nfound that he had indeed overrated his strength. As the first cloud of\nthe sickening dust came up, enveloping his head, choking his breath,\nhe turned suddenly dizzy, and calling faintly, \"Juan, I am ill,\" sank\nhelpless down in the wool. He had fainted. At Juan Canito's scream of\ndismay, a great hubbub and outcry arose; all saw instantly what had\nhappened. Felipe's head was hanging limp over the edge of the bag, Juan\nin vain endeavoring to get sufficient foothold by his side to lift him.\nOne after another the men rushed up the ladder, until they were all\nstanding, a helpless, excited crowd, on the roof, one proposing one\nthing, one another. Only Luigo had had the presence of mind to run to\nthe house for help. The Senora was away from home. She had gone with\nFather Salvierderra to a friend's house, a half-day's journey off.\nBut Ramona was there. Snatching all she could think of in way of\nrestoratives, she came flying back with Luigo, followed by every servant\nof the establishment, all talking, groaning, gesticulating, suggesting,\nwringing their hands,--as disheartening a Babel as ever made bad matters\nworse.\n\nReaching the shed, Ramona looked up to the roof bewildered. \"Where is\nhe?\" she cried. The next instant she saw his head, held in Juan Canito's\narms, just above the edge of the wool-bag. She groaned, \"Oh, how will he\never be lifted out!\"\n\n\"I will lift him, Senora,\" cried Alessandro, coming to the front, \"I am\nvery strong. Do not be afraid; I will bring him safe down.\" And swinging\nhimself down the ladder, he ran swiftly to the camp, and returned,\nbringing in his hands blankets. Springing quickly to the roof again,\nhe knotted the blankets firmly together, and tying them at the middle\naround his waist, threw the ends to his men, telling them to hold him\nfirm. He spoke in the Indian tongue as he was hurriedly doing this,\nand Ramona did not at first understand his plan. But when she saw\nthe Indians move a little back from the edge of the roof, holding the\nblankets firm grasped, while Alessandro stepped out on one of the narrow\ncross-beams from which the bag swung, she saw what he meant to do. She\nheld her breath. Felipe was a slender man; Alessandro was much heavier,\nand many inches taller. Still, could any man carry such a burden safely\non that narrow beam! Ramona looked away, and shut her eyes, through\nthe silence which followed. It was only a few moments; but it seemed an\neternity before a glad murmur of voices told her that it was done, and\nlooking up, she saw Felipe lying on the roof, unconscious, his face\nwhite, his eyes shut. At this sight, all the servants broke out afresh,\nweeping and wailing, \"He is dead! He is dead!\"\n\nRamona stood motionless, her eyes fixed on Felipe's face. She, too,\nbelieved him dead; but her thought was of the Senora.\n\n\"He is not dead,\" cried Juan Canito, who had thrust his hand under\nFelipe's shirt. \"He is not dead. It is only a faint.\"\n\nAt this the first tears rolled down Ramona's face. She looked piteously\nat the ladder up and down which she had seen Alessandro run as if it\nwere an easy indoor staircase. \"If I could only get up there!\" she said,\nlooking from one to another. \"I think I can;\" and she put one foot on\nthe lower round.\n\n\"Holy Virgin!\" cried Juan Can, seeing her movement. \"Senorita! Senorita!\ndo not attempt it. It is not too easy for a man. You will break your\nneck. He is fast coming to his senses.\"\n\nAlessandro caught the words. Spite of all the confusion and terror of\nthe scene, his heart heard the word, \"Senorita.\" Ramona was not the\nwife of Felipe, or of any man. Yet Alessandro recollected that he had\naddressed her as Senora, and she did not seem surprised. Coming to the\nfront of the group he said, bending forward, \"Senorita!\" There must\nhave been something in the tone which made Ramona start. The simple word\ncould not have done it. \"Senorita,\" said Alessandro, \"it will be nothing\nto bring Senor Felipe down the ladder. He is, in my arms, no more\nthan one of the lambs yonder. I will bring him down as soon as he is\nrecovered. He is better here till then. He will very soon be himself\nagain. It was only the heat.\" Seeing that the expression of anxious\ndistress did not grow less on Ramona's face, he continued, in a tone\nstill more earnest, \"Will not the Senorita trust me to bring him safe\ndown?\"\n\nRamona smiled faintly through her tears. \"Yes,\" she said, \"I will trust\nyou. You are Alessandro, are you not?\"\n\n\"Yes, Senorita,\" he answered, greatly surprised, \"I am Alessandro.\"\n\n\n\n\nVI\n\nA BAD beginning did not make a good ending of the Senora Moreno's\nsheep-shearing this year. One as superstitiously prejudiced against\nRoman Catholic rule as she was in favor of it, would have found, in the\nway things fell out, ample reason for a belief that the Senora was\nbeing punished for having let all the affairs of her place come to a\nstandstill, to await the coming of an old monk. But the pious Senora,\nlooking at the other side of the shield, was filled with gratitude\nthat, since all this ill luck was to befall her, she had the good Father\nSalvierderra at her side to give her comfort and counsel.\n\nIt was not yet quite noon of the first day, when Felipe fainted and fell\nin the wool; and it was only a little past noon of the third, when\nJuan Canito, who, not without some secret exultation, had taken Senor\nFelipe's place at the packing, fell from the cross-beam to the ground,\nand broke his right leg,--a bad break near the knee; and Juan Canito's\nbones were much too old for fresh knitting. He would never again be able\nto do more than hobble about on crutches, dragging along the useless\nleg. It was a cruel blow to the old man. He could not be resigned to\nit. He lost faith in his saints, and privately indulged in blasphemous\nberatings and reproaches of them, which would have filled the Senora\nwith terror, had she known that such blasphemies were being committed\nunder her roof.\n\n\"As many times as I have crossed that plank, in my day!\" cried Juan;\n\"only the fiends themselves could have made me trip; and there was that\nwhole box of candles I paid for with my own money last month, and burned\nto Saint Francis in the chapel for this very sheep-shearing! He may sit\nin the dark, for all me, to the end of time! He is no saint at all! What\nare they for, if not to keep us from harm when we pray to them? I'll\npray no more. I believe the Americans are right, who laugh at us.\" From\nmorning till night, and nearly from night till morning, for the leg\nached so he slept little, poor Juan groaned and grumbled and swore, and\nswore and grumbled and groaned. Taking care of him was enough, Margarita\nsaid, to wear out the patience of the Madonna herself. There was no\npleasing him, whatever you did, and his tongue was never still a minute.\nFor her part, she believed that it must be as he said, that the fiends\nhad pushed him off the plank, and that the saints had had their reasons\nfor leaving him to his fate. A coldness and suspicion gradually grew up\nin the minds of all the servants towards him. His own reckless language,\ncombined with Margarita's reports, gave the superstitious fair ground\nfor believing that something had gone mysteriously wrong, and that the\nDevil was in a fair way to get his soul, which was very hard for the old\nman, in addition to all the rest he had to bear. The only alleviation he\nhad for his torments, was in having his fellow-servants, men and women,\ndrop in, sit by his pallet, and chat with him, telling him all that was\ngoing on; and when by degrees they dropped off, coming more and more\nseldom, and one by one leaving off coming altogether, it was the one\ndrop that overflowed his cup of misery; and he turned his face to the\nwall, left off grumbling, and spoke only when he must.\n\nThis phase frightened Margarita even more than the first. Now, she\nthought, surely the dumb terror and remorse of one who belongs to the\nDevil had seized him, and her hands trembled as she went through the\nneedful ministrations for him each day. Three months, at least, the\ndoctor, who had come from Ventura to set the leg, had said he must lie\nstill in bed and be thus tended. \"Three months!\" sighed Margarita. \"If I\nbe not dead or gone crazy myself before the end of that be come!\"\n\nThe Senora was too busy with Felipe to pay attention or to give thought\nto Juan. Felipe's fainting had been the symptom and beginning of a\nfierce relapse of the fever, and he was lying in his bed, tossing and\nraving in delirium, always about the wool.\n\n\"Throw them faster, faster! That's a good fleece; five pounds more; a\nround ton in those bales. Juan! Alessandro! Captain!--Jesus, how this\nsun burns my head!\"\n\nSeveral times he had called \"Alessandro\" so earnestly, that Father\nSalvierderra advised bringing Alessandro into the room, to see if by any\nchance there might have been something in his mind that he wished to say\nto him. But when Alessandro stood by the bedside, Felipe gazed at\nhim vacantly, as he did at all the others, still repeating, however,\n\"Alessandro! Alessandro!\"\n\n\"I think perhaps he wants Alessandro to play on his violin,\" sobbed out\nRamona. \"He was telling me how beautifully Alessandro played, and said\nhe would have him up on the veranda in the evening to play to us.\"\n\n\"We might try it,\" said Father Salvierderra. \"Have you your violin here,\nAlessandro?\"\n\n\"Alas, no, Father,\" replied Alessandro, \"I did not bring it.\"\n\n\"Perhaps it would do him good it you were to sing, then,\" said Ramona.\n\"He was speaking of your voice also.\"\n\n\"Oh, try, try.\" said the Senorita, turning to Alessandro. \"Sing\nsomething low and soft.\"\n\nAlessandro walked from the bed to the open window, and after thinking\nfor a moment, began a slow strain from one of the masses.\n\nAt the first note, Felipe became suddenly quiet, evidently listening. An\nexpression of pleasure spread over his feverish face. He turned his head\nto one side, put his hand under his cheek and closed his eyes. The three\nwatching him looked at each other in astonishment.\n\n\"It is a miracle,\" said Father Salvierderra. \"He will sleep.\"\n\n\"It was what he wanted!\" whispered Ramona.\n\nThe Senora spoke not, but buried her face in the bedclothes for a\nsecond; then lifting it, she gazed at Alessandro as if she were praying\nto a saint. He, too, saw the change in Felipe, and sang lower and lower,\ntill the notes sounded as if they came from afar; lower and lower,\nslower; finally they ceased, as if they died away lost in distance. As\nthey ceased, Felipe opened his eyes.\n\n\"Oh, go on, go on!\" the Senora implored in a whisper shrill with\nanxiety. \"Do not stop!\"\n\nAlessandro repeated the strain, slow, solemn; his voice trembled; the\nair in the room seemed stifling, spite of the open window; he felt\nsomething like terror, as he saw Felipe evidently sinking to sleep by\nreason of the notes of his voice. There had been nothing in Alessandro's\nhealthy outdoor experience to enable him to understand such a\nphenomenon. Felipe breathed more and more slowly, softly, regularly;\nsoon he was in a deep sleep. The singing stopped; Felipe did not stir.\n\n\"Can I go?\" whispered Alessandro.\n\n\"No, no.\" replied the Senora, impatiently. \"He may wake any minute.\"\n\nAlessandro looked troubled, but bowed his head submissively, and\nremained standing by the window. Father Salvierderra was kneeling on\none side of the bed, the Senora at the other, Ramona at the foot,--all\npraying; the silence was so great that the slight sounds of the rosary\nbeads slipping against each other seemed loud. In a niche in the wall,\nat the head of the bed, stood a statue of the Madonna, on the other side\na picture of Santa Barbara. Candles were burning before each. The long\nwicks smouldered and died down, sputtering, then flared up again as\nthe ends fell into the melted wax. The Senora's eyes were fixed on the\nMadonna. The Father's were closed. Ramona gazed at Felipe with tears\nstreaming down her face as she mechanically told her beads.\n\n\"She is his betrothed, no doubt,\" thought Alessandro. \"The saints will\nnot let him die;\" and Alessandro also prayed. But the oppression of the\nscene was too much for him. Laying his hand on the low window-sill, he\nvaulted over it, saying to Ramona, who turned her head at the sound,\n\"I will not go away, Senorita, I will be close under the window, if he\nawakes.\"\n\nOnce in the open air, he drew a long breath, and gazed bewilderedly\nabout him, like one just recovering consciousness after a faint. Then\nhe threw himself on the ground under the window, and lay looking up into\nthe sky. Capitan came up, and with a low whine stretched himself out at\nfull length by his side. The dog knew as well as any other one of the\nhouse that danger and anguish were there.\n\nOne hour passed, two, three; still no sound from Felipe's room.\nAlessandro rose, and looked in at the window. The Father and the Senora\nhad not changed their attitudes; their lips were yet moving in prayer.\nBut Ramona had yielded to her fatigue; slipped from her knees into a\nsitting posture, with her head leaning against the post of the bedstead,\nand fallen asleep. Her face was swollen and discolored by weeping, and\nheavy circles under her eyes told how tired she was. For three days and\nnights she had scarcely rested, so constant were the demands on her.\nBetween Felipe's illness and Juan Can's, there was not a moment without\nsomething to be done, or some perplexing question to be settled, and\nabove all, and through all, the terrible sorrow. Ramona was broken down\nwith grief at the thought of Felipe's death. She had never known till\nshe saw him lying there delirious, and as she in her inexperience\nthought, dying, how her whole life was entwined with his. But now, at\nthe very thought of what it would be to live without him, her heart\nsickened. \"When he is buried, I will ask Father Salvierderra to take\nme away. I never can live here alone,\" she said to herself, never for a\nmoment perceiving that the word \"alone\" was a strange one to have come\ninto her mind in the connection. The thought of the Senora did not enter\ninto her imaginations of the future which so smote her with terror. In\nthe Senora's presence, Ramona always felt herself alone.\n\nAlessandro stood at the window, his arms folded, leaning on the sill,\nhis eyes fixed on Ramona's face and form. To any other than a lover's\neyes she had not looked beautiful now; but to Alessandro she looked more\nbeautiful than the picture of Santa Barbara on the wall beyond. With a\nlover's instinct he knew the thoughts which had written such lines\non her face in the last three days. \"It will kill her if he dies,\"\nhe thought, \"if these three days have made her look like that.\" And\nAlessandro threw himself on the ground again, his face down. He did not\nknow whether it were an hour or a day that he had lain there, when he\nheard Father Salvierderra's voice speaking his name. He sprang up, to\nsee the old monk standing in the window, tears running down his cheeks.\n\"God be praised,\" he said, \"the Senor Felipe will get well. A sweat has\nbroken out on his skin; he still sleeps, but when he wakes he will be in\nhis right mind. The strength of the fever is broken. But, Alessandro, we\nknow not how to spare you. Can you not let the men go without you, and\nremain here? The Senora would like to have you remain in Juan Can's\nplace till he is about. She will give you the same wages he had. Would\nit not be a good thing for you, Alessandro? You cannot be sure of\nearning so much as that for the next three months, can you?\"\n\nWhile the Father was speaking, a tumult had been going on in\nAlessandro's breast. He did not know by name any of the impulses which\nwere warring there, tearing him in twain, as it were, by their pulling\nin opposite directions; one saying \"Stay!\" and the other saying \"Go!\"\nHe would not have known what any one meant, who had said to him, \"It\nis danger to stay; it is safety to fly.\" All the same, he felt as if he\ncould do neither.\n\n\"There is another shearing yet, Father,\" he began, \"at the Ortega's\nranch. I had promised to go to them as soon as I had finished here, and\nthey have been wroth enough with us for the delay already. It will not\ndo to break the promise, Father.\"\n\nFather Salvierderra's face fell. \"No, my son, certainly not,\" he said;\n\"but could no one else take your place with the band?\"\n\nHearing these words, Ramona came to the window, and leaning out,\nwhispered, \"Are you talking about Alessandro's staying? Let me come\nand talk to him. He must not go.\" And running swiftly through the hall,\nacross the veranda, and down the steps, she stood by Alessandro's side\nin a moment. Looking up in his face pleadingly, she said: \"We can't let\nyou go, Alessandro. The Senor will pay wages to some other to go in your\nplace with the shearers. We want you to stay here in Juan Can's place\ntill he is well. Don't say you can't stay! Felipe may need you to sing\nagain, and what would we do then? Can't you stay?\"\n\n\"Yes, I can stay, Senorita,\" answered Alessandro, gravely. \"I will stay\nso long as you need me.\"\n\n\"Oh, thank you, Alessandro!\" Ramona cried. \"You are good, to stay. The\nSenora will see that it is no loss to you;\" and she flew back to the\nhouse.\n\n\"It is not for the wages, Senorita,\" Alessandro began; but Ramona\nwas gone. She did not hear him, and he turned away with a sense of\nhumiliation. \"I don't want the Senorita to think that it was the money\nkept me,\" he said, turning to Father Salvierderra. \"I would not leave\nthe band for money; it is to help, because they are in trouble, Father.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, son. I understand that,\" replied the monk, who had known\nAlessandro since he was a little fellow playing in the corridors of San\nLuis Rey, the pet of all the Brothers there. \"That is quite right of\nyou, and the Senora will not be insensible of it. It is not for such\nthings that money can pay. They are indeed in great trouble now, and\nonly the two women in the house; and I must soon be going on my way\nNorth again.\"\n\n\"Is it sure that Senor Felipe will get well?\" asked Alessandro.\n\n\"I think so,\" replied Father Salvierderra. \"These relapses are always\nworse than the first attack; but I have never known one to die, after\nhe had the natural sweat to break from the skin, and got good sleep. I\ndoubt not he will be in his bed, though, for many days, and there will\nbe much to be seen to. It was an ill luck to have Juan Can laid up,\ntoo, just at this time. I must go and see him; I hear he is in most\nrebellious frame of mind, and blasphemes impiously.\"\n\n\"That does he!\" said Alessandro. \"He swears the saints gave him over to\nthe fiends to push him off the plank, and he'll have none of them from\nthis out! I told him to beware, or they might bring him to worse things\nyet if he did not mend his speech of them.\"\n\nSighing deeply as they walked along, the monk said: \"It is but a sign\nof the times. Blasphemers are on the highway. The people are being\ncorrupted. Keeps your father the worship in the chapel still, and does a\npriest come often to the village?\"\n\n\"Only twice a year,\" replied Alessandro; \"and sometimes for a funeral,\nif there is money enough to pay for the mass. But my father has the\nchapel open, and each Sunday we sing what we know of the mass; and the\npeople are often there praying.\"\n\n\"Ay, ay! Ever for money!\" groaned Father Salvierderra, not heeding the\nlatter part of the sentence. \"Ever for money! It is a shame. But that it\nwere sure to be held as a trespass, I would go myself to Temecula once\nin three months; but I may not. The priests do not love our order.\"\n\n\"Oh, if you could, Father,\" exclaimed Alessandro, \"it would make my\nfather very glad! He speaks often to me of the difference he sees\nbetween the words of the Church now and in the days of the Mission. He\nis very sad, Father, and in great fear about our village. They say the\nAmericans, when they buy the Mexicans' lands, drive the Indians away as\nif they were dogs; they say we have no right to our lands. Do you think\nthat can be so, Father, when we have always lived on them, and the\nowners promised them to us forever?\"\n\nFather Salvierderra was silent a long time before replying, and\nAlessandro watched his face anxiously. He seemed to be hesitating for\nwords to convey his meaning. At last he said: \"Got your father any\nnotice, at any time since the Americans took the country,--notice to\nappear before a court, or anything about a title to the land?\"\n\n\"No, Father,\" replied Alessandro.\n\n\"There has to be some such paper, as I understand their laws,\" continued\nthe monk; \"some notice, before any steps can be taken to remove Indians\nfrom an estate. It must be done according to the law, in the courts. If\nyou have had no such notice, you are not in danger.\"\n\n\"But, Father,\" persisted Alessandro, \"how could there be a law to take\naway from us the land which the Senor Valdez gave us forever?\"\n\n\"Gave he to you any paper, any writing to show it?\"\n\n\"No, no paper; but it is marked in red lines on the map. It was marked\noff by Jose Ramirez, of Los Angeles, when they marked all the boundaries\nof Senor Valdez's estate. They had many instruments of brass and wood to\nmeasure with, and a long chain, very heavy, which I helped them carry.\nI myself saw it marked on the map. They all slept in my father's\nhouse,--Senor Valdez, and Ramirez, and the man who made the measures. He\nhired one of our men to carry his instruments, and I went to help, for I\nwished to see how it was done; but I could understand nothing, and Jose\ntold me a man must study many years to learn the way of it. It seemed to\nme our way, by the stones, was much better. But I know it is all marked\non the map, for it was with a red line; and my father understood it, and\nJose Ramirez and Senor Valdez both pointed to it with their finger, and\nthey said, 'All this here is your land, Pablo, always.' I do not think\nmy father need fear, do you?\"\n\n\"I hope not,\" replied Father Salvierderra, cautiously; \"but since the\nway that all the lands of the Missions have been taken away, I have\nsmall faith in the honesty of the Americans. I think they will take all\nthat they can. The Church has suffered terrible loss at their hands.\"\n\n\"That is what my father says,\" replied Alessandro. \"He says, 'Look at\nSan Luis Rey! Nothing but the garden and orchard left, of all their vast\nlands where they used to pasture thirty thousand sheep. If the Church\nand the Fathers could not keep their lands, what can we Indians do?'\nThat is what my father says.\"\n\n\"True, true!\" said the monk, as he turned into the door of the room\nwhere Juan Can lay on his narrow bed, longing yet fearing to see Father\nSalvierderra's face coming in. \"We are all alike helpless in their\nhands, Alessandro. They possess the country, and can make what laws they\nplease. We can only say, 'God's will be done,'\" and he crossed himself\ndevoutly, repeating the words twice.\n\nAlessandro did the same, and with a truly devout spirit, for he was full\nof veneration for the Fathers and their teachings; but as he walked on\ntowards the shearing-shed he thought: \"Then, again, how can it be God's\nwill that wrong be done? It cannot be God's will that one man should\nsteal from another all he has. That would make God no better than a\nthief, it looks to me. But how can it happen, if it is not God's will?\"\n\nIt does not need that one be educated, to see the logic in this formula.\nGenerations of the oppressed and despoiled, before Alessandro, had\ngrappled with the problem in one shape or another.\n\nAt the shearing-shed, Alessandro found his men in confusion and\nill-humor. The shearing had been over and done by ten in the morning,\nand why were they not on their way to the Ortega's? Waiting all day,--it\nwas now near sunset,--with nothing to do, and still worse with not\nmuch of anything to eat, had made them all cross; and no wonder. The\neconomical Juan Can, finding that the work would be done by ten, and\nsupposing they would be off before noon, had ordered only two sheep\nkilled for them the day before, and the mutton was all gone, and old\nMarda, getting her cue from Juan, had cooked no more frijoles than the\nfamily needed themselves; so the poor shearers had indeed had a sorry\nday of it, in no wise alleviated either by the reports brought from time\nto time that their captain was lying on the ground, face down, under\nSenor Felipe's window, and must not be spoken to.\n\nIt was not a propitious moment for Alessandro to make the announcement\nof his purpose to leave the band; but he made a clean breast of it in\nfew words, and diplomatically diverted all resentment from himself by\nsetting them immediately to voting for a new captain to take his place\nfor the remainder of the season.\n\n\"Very well!\" they said hotly; \"captain for this year, captain for next,\ntoo!\" It wasn't so easy to step out and in again of the captaincy of the\nshearers!\n\n\"All right,\" said Alessandro; \"please yourselves! It is all the same\nto me. But here I am going to stay for the present. Father Salvierderra\nwishes it.\"\n\n\"Oh, if the Father wishes it, that is different.\" \"Ah, that alters\nthe case!\" \"Alessandro is right!\" came up in confused murmur from the\nappeased crowd. They were all good Catholics, every one of the Temecula\nmen, and would never think of going against the Father's orders. But\nwhen they understood that Alessandro's intention was to remain until\nJuan Canito's leg should be well enough for him to go about again, fresh\ngrumblings began. That would not do. It would be all summer. Alessandro\nmust be at home for the Saint Juan's Day fete, in midsummer,--no doing\nanything without Alessandro then. What was he thinking of? Not of the\nmidsummer fete, that was certain, when he promised to stay as long as\nthe Senorita Ramona should need him. Alessandro had remembered nothing\nexcept the Senorita's voice, while she was speaking to him. If he had\nhad a hundred engagements for the summer, he would have forgotten\nthem all. Now that he was reminded of the midsummer fete, it must be\nconfessed he was for a moment dismayed at the recollection; for that was\na time, when, as he well knew, his father could not do without his help.\nThere were sometimes a thousand Indians at this fete, and disorderly\nwhites took advantage of the occasion to sell whisky and encourage all\nsorts of license and disturbance. Yes, Alessandro's clear path of duty\nlay at Temecula when that fete came off. That was certain.\n\n\"I will manage to be at home then,\" he said. \"If I am not through here\nby that time, I will at least come for the fete. That you may depend\non.\"\n\nThe voting for the new captain did not take long. There was, in fact,\nbut one man in the band fit for the office. That was Fernando, the only\nold man in the band; all the rest were young men under thirty, or boys.\nFernando had been captain for several years, but had himself begged,\ntwo years ago, that the band would elect Alessandro in his place. He was\ngetting old, and he did not like to have to sit up and walk about the\nfirst half of every night, to see that the shearers were not gambling\naway all their money at cards; he preferred to roll himself up in his\nblanket at sunset and sleep till dawn the next morning. But just for\nthese few remaining weeks he had no objection to taking the office\nagain. And Alessandro was right, entirely right, in remaining; they\nought all to see that, Fernando said; and his word had great weight with\nthe men.\n\nThe Senora Moreno, he reminded them, had always been a good friend\nof theirs, and had said that so long as she had sheep to shear, the\nTemecula shearers should do it; and it would be very ungrateful now if\nthey did not do all they could to help her in her need.\n\nThe blankets were rolled up, the saddles collected, the ponies caught\nand driven up to the shed, when Ramona and Margarita were seen coming at\nfull speed from the house.\n\n\"Alessandro! Alessandro!\" cried Ramona, out of breath, \"I have only just\nnow heard that the men have had no dinner to-day. I am ashamed; but you\nknow it would not have happened except for the sickness in the house.\nEverybody thought they were going away this morning. Now they must have\na good supper before they go. It is already cooking. Tell them to wait.\"\n\nThose of the men who understood the Spanish language, in which Ramona\nspoke, translated it to those who did not, and there was a cordial\noutburst of thanks to the Senorita from all lips. All were only too\nready to wait for the supper. Their haste to begin on the Ortega\nsheep-shearing had suddenly faded from their minds. Only Alessandro\nhesitated.\n\n\"It is a good six hours' ride to Ortega's,\" he said to the men. \"You'll\nbe late in, if you do not start now.\"\n\n\"Supper will be ready in an hour,\" said Ramona. \"Please let them stay;\none hour can't make any difference.\"\n\nAlessandro smiled. \"It will take nearer two, Senorita, before they are\noff,\" he said; \"but it shall be as you wish, and many thanks to you,\nSenorita, for thinking of it.\"\n\n\"Oh, I did not think of it myself,\" said Ramona. \"It was Margarita,\nhere, who came and told me. She knew we would be ashamed to have the\nshearers go away hungry. I am afraid they are very hungry indeed,\" she\nadded ruefully. \"It must be dreadful to go a whole day without anything\nto eat; they had their breakfast soon after sunrise, did they not?\"\n\n\"Yes, Senorita,\" answered Alessandro, \"but that is not long; one can do\nwithout food very well for one day. I often do.\"\n\n\"Often.\" exclaimed Ramona; \"but why should you do that?\" Then suddenly\nbethinking herself, she said in her heart, \"Oh, what a thoughtless\nquestion! Can it be they are so poor as that?\" And to save Alessandro\nfrom replying, she set off on a run for the house, saying, \"Come, come,\nMargarita, we must go and help at the supper.\"\n\n\"Will the Senorita let me help, too,\" asked Alessandro, wondering at his\nown boldness,--\"if there is anything I can do?\"\n\n\"Oh, no,\" she cried, \"there is not. Yes, there is, too. You can help\ncarry the things down to the booth; for we are short of hands now, with\nJuan Can in bed, and Luigo gone to Ventura for the doctor. You and some\nof your men might carry all the supper over. I'll call you when we are\nready.\"\n\nThe men sat down in a group and waited contentedly, smoking, chatting,\nand laughing. Alessandro walked up and down between the kitchen and\nthe shed. He could hear the sounds of rattling dishes, jingling spoons,\nfrying, pouring water. Savory smells began to be wafted out. Evidently\nold Marda meant to atone for the shortcoming of the noon. Juan Can, in\nhis bed, also heard and smelled what was going on. \"May the fiends get\nme,\" he growled, \"if that wasteful old hussy isn't getting up a feast\nfor those beasts of Indians! There's mutton and onions, and peppers\nstewing, and potatoes, I'll be bound, and God knows what else, for\nbeggars that are only too thankful to get a handful of roasted wheat or\na bowl of acorn porridge at home. Well, they'll have to say they\nwere well feasted at the Moreno's,--that's one comfort. I wonder if\nMargarita'll think I am worthy of tasting that stew! San Jose! but it\nsmells well! Margarita! Margarita!\" he called at top of his lungs; but\nMargarita did not hear. She was absorbed in her duties in the kitchen;\nand having already taken Juan at sundown a bowl of the good broth which\nthe doctor had said was the only sort of food he must eat for two weeks,\nshe had dismissed him from her mind for the night. Moreover, Margarita\nwas absent-minded to-night. She was more than half in love with the\nhandsome Alessandro, who, when he had been on the ranch the year\nbefore, had danced with her, and said many a light pleasant word to her,\nevenings, as a young man may; and what ailed him now, that he seemed,\nwhen he saw her, as if she were no more than a transparent shade,\nthrough which he stared at the sky behind her, she did not know. Senor\nFelipe's illness, she thought, and the general misery and confusion,\nhad perhaps put everything else out of his head; but now he was going\nto stay, and it would be good fun having him there, if only Senor Felipe\ngot well, which he seemed likely to do. And as Margarita flew about,\nhere, there, and everywhere, she cast frequent glances at the tall\nstraight figure pacing up and down in the dusk outside.\n\nAlessandro did not see her. He did not see anything. He was looking off\nat the sunset, and listening. Ramona had said, \"I will call you when we\nare ready.\" But she did not do as she said. She told Margarita to call.\n\n\"Run, Margarita,\" she said. \"All is ready now; see if Alessandro is in\nsight. Call him to come and take the things.\"\n\nSo it was Margarita's voice, and not Ramona's, that called \"Alessandro!\nAlessandro! the supper is ready.\"\n\nBut it was Ramona who, when Alessandro reached the doorway, stood there\nholding in her arms a huge smoking platter of the stew which had so\nroused poor Juan Can's longings; and it was Ramona who said, as she gave\nit into Alessandro's hands, \"Take care, Alessandro, it is very full. The\ngravy will run over if you are not careful. You are not used to waiting\non table;\" and as she said it, she smiled full into Alessandro's\neyes,--a little flitting, gentle, friendly smile, which went near to\nmaking him drop the platter, mutton, gravy, and all, then and there, at\nher feet.\n\nThe men ate fast and greedily, and it was not, after all, much more than\nan hour, when, full fed and happy, they were mounting their horses to\nset off. At the last moment Alessandro drew one of them aside. \"Jose,\"\nhe said, \"whose horse is the faster, yours or Antonio's?\"\n\n\"Mine,\" promptly replied Jose. \"Mine, by a great deal. I will run\nAntonio any day he likes.\"\n\nAlessandro knew this as well before asking as after. But Alessandro was\nlearning a great many things in these days, among other things a little\ndiplomacy. He wanted a man to ride at the swiftest to Temecula and back.\nHe knew that Jose's pony could go like the wind. He also knew that there\nwas a perpetual feud of rivalry between him and Antonio, in matter of\nthe fleetness of their respective ponies. So, having chosen Jose for\nhis messenger, he went thus to work to make sure that he would urge his\nhorse to its utmost speed.\n\nWhispering in Jose's ear a few words, he said, \"Will you go? I will pay\nyou for the time, all you could earn at the shearing.\"\n\n\"I will go,\" said Jose, elated. \"You will see me back tomorrow by\nsundown.\"\n\n\"Not earlier?\" asked Alessandro. \"I thought by noon.\"\n\n\"Well, by noon be it, then,\" said Jose. \"The horse can do it.\"\n\n\"Have great care!\" said Alessandro.\n\n\"That will I,\" replied Jose; and giving his horse's sides a sharp punch\nwith his knees, set off at full gallop westward.\n\n\"I have sent Jose with a message to Temecula,\" said Alessandro, walking\nup to Fernando. \"He will be back here tomorrow noon, and join you at the\nOrtega's the next morning.\"\n\n\"Back here by noon to-morrow!\" exclaimed Fernando. \"Not unless he kills\nhis horse!\"\n\n\"That was what he said,\" replied Alessandro, nonchalantly.\n\n\"Easy enough, too!\" cried Antonio, riding up on his little dun mare.\n\"I'd go in less time than that, on this mare. Jose's is no match for\nher, and never was. Why did you not send me, Alessandro?\"\n\n\"Is your horse really faster than Jose's?\" said Alessandro. \"Then I wish\nI had sent you. I'll send you next time.\"\n\n\n\n\nVII\n\nIT was strange to see how quickly and naturally Alessandro fitted into\nhis place in the household. How tangles straightened out, and rough\nplaces became smooth, as he quietly took matters in hand. Luckily, old\nJuan Can had always liked him, and felt a great sense of relief at the\nnews of his staying on. Not a wholly unselfish relief, perhaps, for\nsince his accident Juan had not been without fears that he might lose\nhis place altogether; there was a Mexican he knew, who had long\nbeen scheming to get the situation, and had once openly boasted at\na fandango, where he was dancing with Anita, that as soon as that\nsuperannuated old fool, Juan Canito, was out of the way, he meant to\nbe the Senora Moreno's head shepherd himself. To have seen this man in\nauthority on the place, would have driven Juan out of his mind.\n\nBut the gentle Alessandro, only an Indian,--and of course the Senora\nwould never think of putting an Indian permanently in so responsible a\nposition on the estate,--it was exactly as Juan would have wished; and\nhe fraternized with Alessandro heartily from the outset; kept him in\nhis room by the hour, giving him hundreds of long-winded directions and\nexplanations about things which, if only he had known it, Alessandro\nunderstood far better than he did.\n\nAlessandro's father had managed the Mission flocks and herds at San Luis\nRey for twenty years; few were as skilful as he; he himself owned nearly\nas many sheep as the Senora Moreno; but this Juan did not know. Neither\ndid he realize that Alessandro, as Chief Pablo's son, had a position\nof his own not without dignity and authority. To Juan, an Indian was\nan Indian, and that was the end of it. The gentle courteousness of\nAlessandro's manner, his quiet behavior, were all set down in Juan's\nmind to the score of the boy's native amiability and sweetness. If Juan\nhad been told that the Senor Felipe himself had not been more carefully\ntrained in all precepts of kindliness, honorable dealing, and polite\nusage, by the Senora, his mother, than had Alessandro by his father, he\nwould have opened his eyes wide. The standards of the two parents\nwere different, to be sure; but the advantage could not be shown to be\nentirely on the Senora's side. There were many things that Felipe knew,\nof which Alessandro was profoundly ignorant; but there were others\nin which Alessandro could have taught Felipe; and when it came to the\nthings of the soul, and of honor, Alessandro's plane was the higher\nof the two. Felipe was a fair-minded, honorable man, as men go; but\ncircumstances and opportunity would have a hold on him they could never\nget on Alessandro. Alessandro would not lie; Felipe might. Alessandro\nwas by nature full of veneration and the religious instinct; Felipe had\nbeen trained into being a good Catholic. But they were both singularly\npure-minded, open-hearted, generous-souled young men, and destined, by\nthe strange chance which had thus brought them into familiar relations,\nto become strongly attached to each other. After the day on which\nthe madness of Felipe's fever had been so miraculously soothed and\ncontrolled by Alessandro's singing, he was never again wildly delirious.\nWhen he waked in the night from that first long sleep, he was, as Father\nSalvierderra had predicted, in his right mind; knew every one, and asked\nrational questions. But the over-heated and excited brain did not\nfor some time wholly resume normal action. At intervals he wandered,\nespecially when just arousing from sleep; and, strangely enough, it\nwas always for Alessandro that he called at these times, and it seemed\nalways to be music that he craved. He recollected Alessandro's having\nsung to him that first night. \"I was not so crazy as you all thought,\"\nhe said. \"I knew a great many of the things I said, but I couldn't help\nsaying them; and I heard Ramona ask Alessandro to sing; and when he\nbegan, I remember I thought the Virgin had reached down and put her hand\non my head and cooled it.\"\n\nOn the second evening, the first after the shearers had left,\nAlessandro, seeing Ramona in the veranda, went to the foot of the steps,\nand said, \"Senorita, would Senor Felipe like to have me play on the\nviolin to him tonight?\"\n\n\"Why, whose violin have you got?\" exclaimed Ramona, astonished.\n\n\"My own, Senorita.\"\n\n\"Your own! I thought you said you did not bring it.\"\n\n\"Yes, Senorita, that is true; but I sent for it last night, and it is\nhere.\"\n\n\"Sent to Temecula and back already!\" cried Ramona.\n\n\"Yes, Senorita. Our ponies are swift and strong. They can go a hundred\nmiles in a day, and not suffer. It was Jose brought it, and he is at the\nOrtega's by this time.\"\n\nRamona's eyes glistened. \"I wish I could have thanked him,\" she said.\n\"You should have let me know. He ought to have been paid for going.\"\n\n\"I paid him, Senorita; he went for me,\" said Alessandro, with a shade of\nwounded pride in the tone, which Ramona should have perceived, but did\nnot, and went on hurting the lover's heart still more.\n\n\"But it was for us that you sent for it, Alessandro; the Senora would\nrather pay the messenger herself.\"\n\n\"It is paid, Senorita. It is nothing. If the Senor Felipe wishes to hear\nthe violin, I will play;\" and Alessandro walked slowly away.\n\nRamona gazed after him. For the first time, she looked at him with no\nthought of his being an Indian,--a thought there had surely been no need\nof her having, since his skin was not a shade darker than Felipe's;\nbut so strong was the race feeling, that never till that moment had she\nforgotten it.\n\n\"What a superb head, and what a walk!\" she thought. Then, looking more\nobservantly, she said: \"He walks as if he were offended. He did not\nlike my offering to pay for the messenger. He wanted to do it for dear\nFelipe. I will tell Felipe, and we will give him some present when he\ngoes away.\"\n\n\"Isn't he splendid, Senorita?\" came in a light laughing tone from\nMargarita's lips close to her ear, in the fond freedom of their\nrelation. \"Isn't he splendid? And oh, Senorita, you can't think how he\ndances! Last year I danced with him every night; he has wings on his\nfeet, for all he is so tall and big.\"\n\nThere was a coquettish consciousness in the girl's tone, that was\nsuddenly, for some unexplained reason, exceedingly displeasing to\nRamona. Drawing herself away, she spoke to Margarita in a tone she had\nnever before in her life used. \"It is not fitting to speak like that\nabout young men. The Senora would be displeased if she heard you,\" she\nsaid, and walked swiftly away leaving poor Margarita as astounded as if\nshe had got a box on the ear.\n\nShe looked after Ramona's retreating figure, then after Alessandro's.\nShe had heard them talking together just before she came up. Thoroughly\nbewildered and puzzled, she stood motionless for several seconds,\nreflecting; then, shaking her head, she ran away, trying to dismiss the\nharsh speech from her mind. \"Alessandro must have vexed the Senorita,\"\nshe thought, \"to make her speak like that to me.\" But the incident was\nnot so easily dismissed from Margarita's thoughts. Many times in the\nday it recurred to her, still a bewilderment and a puzzle, as far from\nsolution as ever. It was a tiny seed, whose name she did not dream of;\nbut it was dropped in soil where it would grow some day,--forcing-house\nsoil, and a bitter seed; and when it blossomed, Ramona would have an\nenemy.\n\nAll unconscious, equally of Margarita's heart and her own, Ramona\nproceeded to Felipe's room. Felipe was sleeping, the Senora sitting by\nhis side, as she had sat for days and nights,--her dark face looking\nthinner and more drawn each day; her hair looking even whiter, if that\ncould be; and her voice growing hollow from faintness and sorrow.\n\n\"Dear Senora,\" whispered Ramona, \"do go out for a few moments while he\nsleeps, and let me watch,--just on the walk in front of the veranda. The\nsun is still lying there, bright and warm. You will be ill if you do not\nhave air.\"\n\nThe Senora shook her head. \"My place is here,\" she answered, speaking in\na dry, hard tone. Sympathy was hateful to the Senora Moreno; she wished\nneither to give it nor take it. \"I shall not leave him. I do not need\nthe air.\"\n\nRamona had a cloth-of-gold rose in her hand. The veranda eaves were now\nshaded with them, hanging down like a thick fringe of golden tassels. It\nwas the rose Felipe loved best. Stooping, she laid it on the bed, near\nFelipe's head. \"He will like to see it when he wakes,\" she said.\n\nThe Senora seized it, and flung it far out in the room. \"Take it away!\nFlowers are poison when one is ill,\" she said coldly. \"Have I never told\nyou that?\"\n\n\"No, Senora,\" replied Ramona, meekly; and she glanced involuntarily at\nthe saucer of musk which the Senora kept on the table close to Felipe's\npillow.\n\n\"The musk is different,\" said the Senora, seeing the glance. \"Musk is a\nmedicine; it revives.\"\n\nRamona knew, but she would have never dared to say, that Felipe hated\nmusk. Many times he had said to her how he hated the odor; but his\nmother was so fond of it, that it must always be that the veranda and\nthe house would be full of it. Ramona hated it too. At times it made her\nfaint, with a deadly faintness. But neither she nor Felipe would have\nconfessed as much to the Senora; and if they had, she would have thought\nit all a fancy.\n\n\"Shall I stay?\" asked Ramona, gently.\n\n\"As you please,\" replied the Senora. The simple presence of Ramona irked\nher now with a feeling she did not pretend to analyze, and would\nhave been terrified at if she had. She would not have dared to say\nto herself, in plain words: \"Why is that girl well and strong, and my\nFelipe lying here like to die! If Felipe dies, I cannot bear the sight\nof her. What is she, to be preserved of the saints!\"\n\nBut that, or something like it, was what she felt whenever Ramona\nentered the room; still more, whenever she assisted in ministering to\nFelipe. If it had been possible, the Senora would have had no hands but\nher own do aught for her boy. Even tears from Ramona sometimes irritated\nher. \"What does she know about loving Felipe! He is nothing to her!\"\nthought the Senora, strangely mistaken, strangely blind, strangely\nforgetting how feeble is the tie of blood in the veins by the side of\nlove in the heart.\n\nIf into this fiery soul of the Senora's could have been dropped one\nsecond's knowledge of the relative positions she and Ramona already\noccupied in Felipe's heart, she would, on the spot, have either died\nherself or have slain Ramona, one or the other. But no such knowledge\nwas possible; no such idea could have found entrance into the Senora's\nmind. A revelation from Heaven of it could hardly have reached even her\nears. So impenetrable are the veils which, fortunately for us all, are\nforever held by viewless hands between us and the nearest and closest of\nour daily companions.\n\nAt twilight of this day Felipe was restless and feverish again. He had\ndozed at intervals all day long, but had had no refreshing sleep.\n\n\"Send for Alessandro,\" he said. \"Let him come and sing to me.\"\n\n\"He has his violin now; he can play, if you would like that better,\"\nsaid Ramona; and she related what Alessandro had told her of the\nmessenger's having ridden to Temecula and back in a night and half a\nday, to bring it.\n\n\"I wanted to pay the man,\" she said; \"I knew of course your mother would\nwish to reward him. But I fancy Alessandro was offended. He answered me\nshortly that it was paid, and it was nothing.\"\n\n\"You couldn't have offended him more,\" said Felipe. \"What a pity! He is\nas proud as Lucifer himself, that Alessandro. You know his father has\nalways been the head of their band; in fact, he has authority over\nseveral bands; General, they call it now, since they got the title from\nthe Americans; they used to call it Chief., and until Father Peyri left\nSan Luis Rey, Pablo was in charge of all the sheep, and general steward\nand paymaster. Father Peyri trusted him with everything; I've heard he\nwould leave boxes full of uncounted gold in Pablo's charge to pay off\nthe Indians. Pablo reads and writes, and is very well off; he has as\nmany sheep as we have, I fancy!\"\n\n\"What!\" exclaimed Ramona, astonished. \"They all look as if they were\npoor.\"\n\n\"Oh, well, so they are,\" replied Felipe, \"compared with us; but one\nreason is, they share everything with each other. Old Pablo feeds and\nsupports half his village, they say. So long as he has anything, he will\nnever see one of his Indians hungry.\"\n\n\"How generous!\" warmly exclaimed Ramona; \"I think they are better than\nwe are, Felipe!\"\n\n\"I think so, too,\" said Felipe. \"That's what I have always said. The\nIndians are the most generous people in the world. Of course they have\nlearned it partly from us; but they were very much so when the Fathers\nfirst came here. You ask Father Salvierderra some day. He has read\nall Father Junipero's and Father Crespi's diaries, and he says it is\nwonderful how the wild savages gave food to every one who came.\"\n\n\"Felipe, you are talking too much,\" said the Senora's voice, in the\ndoorway; and as she spoke she looked reproachfully at Ramona. If she\nhad said in words, \"See how unfit you are to be trusted with Felipe. No\nwonder I do not leave the room except when I must!\" her meaning could\nnot have been plainer. Ramona felt it keenly, and not without some\nmisgiving that it was deserved.\n\n\"Oh, dear Felipe, has it hurt you?\" she said timidly; and to the Senora,\n\"Indeed, Senora, he has been speaking but a very few moments, very low.\"\n\n\"Go call Alessandro, Ramona, will you?\" said Felipe. \"Tell him to bring\nhis violin. I think I will go to sleep if he plays.\"\n\nA long search Ramona had for Alessandro. Everybody had seen him a few\nminutes ago, but nobody knew where he was now. Kitchens, sheepfolds,\nvineyards, orchards, Juan Can's bedchamber,--Ramona searched them all\nin vain. At last, standing at the foot of the veranda steps, and looking\ndown the garden, she thought she saw figures moving under the willows by\nthe washing-stones.\n\n\"Can he be there?\" she said. \"What can he be doing there? Who is it with\nhim?\" And she walked down the path, calling, \"Alessandro! Alessandro!\"\n\nAt the first sound, Alessandro sprang from the side of his companion,\nand almost before the second syllables had been said, was standing face\nto face with Ramona.\n\n\"Here I am, Senorita. Does Senor Felipe want me? I have my violin here.\nI thought perhaps he would like to have me play to him in the twilight.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Ramona, \"he wishes to hear you. I have been looking\neverywhere for you.\" As she spoke, she was half unconsciously peering\nbeyond into the dusk, to see whose figure it was, slowly moving by the\nbrook.\n\nNothing escaped Alessandro's notice where Ramona was concerned. \"It is\nMargarita,\" he said instantly. \"Does the Senorita want her? Shall I run\nand call her?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Ramona, again displeased, she knew not why, nor in fact knew\nshe was displeased; \"no, I was not looking for her. What is she doing\nthere?\"\n\n\"She is washing,\" replied Alessandro, innocently.\n\n\"Washing at this time of day!\" thought Ramona, severely. \"A mere\npretext. I shall watch Margarita. The Senora would never allow this sort\nof thing.\" And as she walked back to the house by Alessandro's side,\nshe meditated whether or no she would herself speak to Margarita on the\nsubject in the morning.\n\nMargarita, in the mean time, was also having her season of reflections\nnot the pleasantest. As she soused her aprons up and down in the water,\nshe said to herself, \"I may as well finish them now I am here. How\nprovoking! I've no more than got a word with him, than she must come,\ncalling him away. And he flies as if he was shot on an arrow, at\nthe first word. I'd like to know what's come over the man, to be so\ndifferent. If I could ever get a good half-hour with him alone, I'd soon\nfind out. Oh, but his eyes go through me, through and through me! I\nknow he's an Indian, but what do I care for that. He's a million times\nhandsomer than Senor Felipe. And Juan Jose said the other day he'd make\nenough better head shepherd than old Juan Can, if Senor Felipe'd only\nsee it; and why shouldn't he get to see it, if Alessandro's here\nall summer?\" And before the aprons were done, Margarita had a fine\nair-castle up: herself and Alessandro married, a nice little house,\nchildren playing in the sunshine below the artichoke-patch, she herself\nstill working for the Senora. \"And the Senorita will perhaps marry Senor\nFelipe,\" she added, her thoughts moving more hesitatingly. \"He worships\nthe ground she walks on. Anybody with quarter of a blind eye can see\nthat; but maybe the Senora would not let him. Anyhow, Senor Felipe is\nsure to have a wife, and so and so.\" It was an innocent, girlish castle,\nbuilt of sweet and natural longings, for which no maiden, high or\nlow, need blush; but its foundations were laid in sand, on which would\npresently beat such winds and floods as poor little Margarita never\ndreamed of.\n\nThe next day Margarita and Ramona both went about their day's business\nwith a secret purpose in their hearts. Margarita had made up her mind\nthat before night she would, by fair means or foul, have a good long\ntalk with Alessandro. \"He was fond enough of me last year, I know,\"\nshe said to herself, recalling some of the dances and the good-night\nleave-takings at that time. \"It's because he is so put upon by everybody\nnow. What with Juan Can in one bed sending for him to prate to him about\nthe sheep, and Senor Felipe in another sending for him to fiddle him to\nsleep, and all the care of the sheep, it's a wonder he's not out of his\nmind altogether. But I'll find a chance, or make one, before this day's\nsun sets. If I can once get a half-hour with him, I'm not afraid after\nthat; I know the way it is with men!\" said the confident Margarita,\nwho, truth being told, it must be admitted, did indeed know a great\ndeal about the way it is with men, and could be safely backed, in a fair\nfield, with a fair start, against any girl of her age and station in\nthe country. So much for Margarita's purpose, at the outset of a day\ndestined to be an eventful one in her life.\n\nRamona's purpose was no less clear. She had decided, after some\nreflection, that she would not speak to the Senora about Margarita's\nhaving been under the willows with Alessandro in the previous evening,\nbut would watch her carefully and see whether there were any farther\nsigns of her attempting to have clandestine interviews with him.\n\nThis course she adopted, she thought, chiefly because of her affection\nfor Margarita, and her unwillingness to expose her to the Senora's\ndispleasure, which would be great, and terrible to bear. She was also\naware of an unwillingness to bring anything to light which would reflect\never so lightly upon Alessandro in the Senora's estimation. \"And he is\nnot really to blame,\" thought Ramona, \"if a girl follows him about and\nmakes free with him. She must have seen him at the willows, and gone\ndown there on purpose to meet him, making a pretext of the washing. For\nshe never in this world would have gone to wash in the dark, as he must\nhave known, if he were not a fool. He is not the sort of person, it\nseems to me, to be fooling with maids. He seems as full of grave thought\nas Father Salvierderra. If I see anything amiss in Margarita to-day, I\nshall speak to her myself, kindly but firmly, and tell her to conduct\nherself more discreetly.\"\n\nThen, as the other maiden's had done, Ramona's thoughts, being\nconcentrated on Alessandro, altered a little from their first key, and\ngrew softer and more imaginative; strangely enough, taking some of the\nphrases, as it were, out of the other maiden's mouth.\n\n\"I never saw such eyes as Alessandro has,\" she said. \"I wonder any girl\nshould make free with him. Even I myself, when he fixes his eyes on me,\nfeel a constraint. There is something in them like the eyes of a saint,\nso solemn, yet so mild. I am sure he is very good.\"\n\nAnd so the day opened; and if there were abroad in the valley that day\na demon of mischief, let loose to tangle the skeins of human affairs,\nthings could not have fallen out better for his purpose than they did;\nfor it was not yet ten o'clock of the morning, when Ramona, sitting at\nher embroidery in the veranda, half hid behind the vines, saw Alessandro\ngoing with his pruning-knife in his hand towards the artichoke-patch at\nthe east of the garden, and joining the almond orchard. \"I wonder\nwhat he is going to do there,\" she thought. \"He can't be going to cut\nwillows;\" and her eyes followed him till he disappeared among the trees.\n\nRamona was not the only one who saw this. Margarita, looking from the\neast window of Father Salvierderra's room, saw the same thing. \"Now's\nmy chance!\" she said; and throwing a white reboso coquettishly over her\nhead, she slipped around the corner of the house. She ran swiftly in the\ndirection in which Alessandro had gone. The sound of her steps reached\nRamona, who, lifting her eyes, took in the whole situation at a glance.\nThere was no possible duty, no possible message, which would take\nMargarita there. Ramona's cheeks blazed with a disproportionate\nindignation. But she bethought herself, \"Ah, the Senora may have sent\nher to call Alessandro!\" She rose, went to the door of Felipe's room,\nand looked in. The Senora was sitting in the chair by Felipe's bed,\nwith her eyes closed. Felipe was dozing. The Senora opened her eyes, and\nlooked inquiringly at Ramona.\n\n\"Do you know where Margarita is?\" said Ramona.\n\n\"In Father Salvierderra's room, or else in the kitchen helping Marda,\"\nreplied the Senora, in a whisper. \"I told her to help Marda with the\npeppers this morning.\"\n\nRamona nodded, returned to the veranda, and sat down to decide on\nher course of action. Then she rose again, and going to Father\nSalvierderra's room, looked in. The room was still in disorder.\nMargarita had left her work there unfinished. The color deepened on\nRamona's cheeks. It was strange how accurately she divined each process\nof the incident. \"She saw him from this window,\" said Ramona, \"and has\nrun after him. It is shameful. I will go and call her back, and let her\nsee that I saw it all. It is high time that this was stopped.\"\n\nBut once back in the veranda, Ramona halted, and seated herself in her\nchair again. The idea of seeming to spy was revolting to her.\n\n\"I will wait here till she comes back,\" she said, and took up her\nembroidery. But she could not work. As the minutes went slowly by, she\nsat with her eyes fixed on the almond orchard, where first Alessandro\nand then Margarita had disappeared. At last she could bear it no longer.\nIt seemed to her already a very long time. It was not in reality very\nlong,--a half hour or so, perhaps; but it was long enough for Margarita\nto have made great headway, as she thought, in her talk with Alessandro,\nand for things to have reached just the worst possible crisis at which\nthey could have been surprised, when Ramona suddenly appeared at the\norchard gate, saying in a stern tone, \"Margarita, you are wanted in the\nhouse!\" At a bad crisis, indeed, for everybody concerned. The picture\nwhich Ramona had seen, as she reached the gate, was this: Alessandro,\nstanding with his back against the fence, his right hand hanging\nlistlessly down, with the pruning-knife in it, his left hand in the hand\nof Margarita, who stood close to him, looking up in his face, with a\nhalf-saucy, half-loving expression. What made bad matters worse, was,\nthat at the first sight of Ramona, Alessandro snatched his hand from\nMargarita's, and tried to draw farther off from her, looking at her with\nan expression which, even in her anger, Ramona could not help seeing was\none of disgust and repulsion. And if Ramona saw it, how much more did\nMargarita! Saw it, as only a woman repulsed in presence of another woman\ncan see and feel. The whole thing was over in the twinkling of an eye;\nthe telling it takes double, treble the time of the happening. Before\nAlessandro was fairly aware what had befallen, Ramona and Margarita\nwere disappearing from view under the garden trellis,--Ramona walking in\nadvance, stately, silent, and Margarita following, sulky, abject in her\ngait, but with a raging whirlwind in her heart.\n\nIt had taken only the twinkling of an eye, but it had told Margarita the\ntruth. Alessandro too.\n\n\"My God.\" he said, \"the Senorita thought me making love to that girl.\nMay the fiends get her! The Senorita looked at me as if I were a dog. How\ncould she think a man would look at a woman after he had once seen her!\nAnd I can never, never speak to her to tell her! Oh, this cannot be\nborne!\" And in his rage Alessandro threw his pruning-knife whirling\nthrough the air so fiercely, it sank to the hilt in one of the old\nolive-trees. He wished he were dead. He was minded to flee the place.\nHow could he ever look the Senorita in the face again!\n\n\"Perdition take that girl!\" he said over and over in his helpless\ndespair. An ill outlook for Margarita after this; and the girl had not\ndeserved it.\n\nIn Margarita's heart the pain was more clearly defined. She had seen\nRamona a half-second before Alessandro had; and dreaming no special\nharm, except a little confusion at being seen thus standing with\nhim,--for she would tell the Senorita all about it when matters had gone\na little farther,--had not let go of Alessandro's hand. But the next\nsecond she had seen in his face a look; oh, she would never forget it,\nnever! That she should live to have had any man look at her like that!\nAt the first glimpse of the Senorita, all the blood in his body seemed\nrushing into his face, and he had snatched his hand away,--for it was\nMargarita herself that had taken his hand, not he hers,--had snatched\nhis hand away, and pushed her from him, till she had nearly fallen. All\nthis might have been borne, if it had been only a fear of the Senorita's\nseeing them, which had made him do it. But Margarita knew a great deal\nbetter than that. That one swift, anguished, shame-smitten, appealing,\nworshipping look on Alessandro's face, as his eyes rested on Ramona, was\nlike a flash of light into Margarita's consciousness. Far better than\nAlessandro himself, she now knew his secret. In her first rage she did\nnot realize either the gulf between herself and Ramona, or that between\nRamona and Alessandro. Her jealous rage was as entire as if they had\nall been equals together. She lost her head altogether, and there was\nembodied insolence in the tone in which she said presently, \"Did the\nSenorita want me?\"\n\nTurning swiftly on her, and looking her full in the eye, Ramona said:\n\"I saw you go to the orchard, Margarita, and I knew what you went for. I\nknew that you were at the brook last night with Alessandro. All I wanted\nof you was, to tell you that if I see anything more of this sort, I\nshall speak to the Senora.\"\n\n\"There is no harm,\" muttered Margarita, sullenly. \"I don't know what the\nSenorita means.\"\n\n\"You know very well, Margarita,\" retorted Ramona. \"You know that the\nSenora permits nothing of the kind. Be careful, now, what you do.\" And\nwith that the two separated, Ramona returning to the veranda and her\nembroidery, and Margarita to her neglected duty of making the good\nFather's bed. But each girl's heart was hot and unhappy; and Margarita's\nwould have been still hotter and unhappier, had she heard the words\nwhich were being spoken on the veranda a little later.\n\nAfter a few minutes of his blind rage at Margarita, himself, and fate\ngenerally, Alessandro, recovering his senses, had ingeniously persuaded\nhimself that, as the Senora's; and also the Senorita's servant, for the\ntime being, he owed it to them to explain the situation in which he had\njust been found. Just what he was to say he did not know; but no sooner\nhad the thought struck him, than he set off at full speed for the house,\nhoping to find Ramona on the veranda, where he knew she spent all her\ntime when not with Senor Felipe.\n\nWhen Ramona saw him coming, she lowered her eyes, and was absorbed in\nher embroidery. She did not wish to look at him.\n\nThe footsteps stopped. She knew he was standing at the steps. She would\nnot look up. She thought if she did not, he would go away. She did not\nknow either the Indian or the lover nature. After a time, finding the\nconsciousness of the soundless presence intolerable, she looked up, and\nsurprised on Alessandro's face a gaze which had, in its long interval\nof freedom from observation, been slowly gathering up into it all the\npassion of the man's soul, as a burning-glass draws the fire of the\nsun's rays. Involuntarily a low cry burst from Ramona's lips, and she\nsprang to her feet.\n\n\"Ah! did I frighten the Senorita? Forgive. I have been waiting here a\nlong time to speak to her. I wished to say--\"\n\nSuddenly Alessandro discovered that he did not know what he wished to\nsay.\n\nAs suddenly, Ramona discovered that she knew all he wished to say. But\nshe spoke not, only looked at him searchingly.\n\n\"Senorita,\" he began again, \"I would never be unfaithful to my duty to\nthe Senora, and to you.\"\n\n\"I believe you, Alessandro,\" said Ramona. \"It is not necessary to say\nmore.\"\n\nAt these words a radiant joy spread over Alessandro's face. He had not\nhoped for this. He felt, rather than heard, that Ramona understood him.\nHe felt, for the first time, a personal relation between himself and\nher.\n\n\"It is well,\" he said, in the brief phrase so frequent with his people.\n\"It is well.\" And with a reverent inclination of his head, he walked\naway. Margarita, still dawdling surlily over her work in Father\nSalvierderra's room, heard Alessandro's voice, and running to discover\nto whom he was speaking, caught these last, words. Peering from behind\na curtain, she saw the look with which he said them; saw also the\nexpression on Ramona's face as she listened.\n\nMargarita clenched her hands. The seed had blossomed. Ramona had an\nenemy.\n\n\"Oh, but I am glad Father Salvierderra has gone!\" said the girl,\nbitterly. \"He'd have had this out of me, spite of everything. I haven't\ngot to confess for a year, maybe; and much can happen in that time.\"\n\nMuch, indeed!\n\n\n\n\nVIII\n\nFELIPE gained but slowly. The relapse was indeed, as Father Salvierderra\nhad said, worse than the original attack. Day after day he lay with\nlittle apparent change; no pain, but a weakness so great that it was\nalmost harder to bear than sharp suffering would have been. Nearly every\nday Alessandro was sent for to play or sing to him. It seemed to be the\nonly thing that roused him from his half lethargic state. Sometimes he\nwould talk with Alessandro on matters relative to the estate, and show\nfor a few moments something like his old animation; but he was soon\ntired, and would close his eyes, saying: \"I will speak with you again\nabout this, Alessandro; I am going to sleep now. Sing.\"\n\nThe Senora, seeing Felipe's enjoyment of Alessandro's presence, soon\ncame to have a warm feeling towards him herself; moreover, she greatly\nliked his quiet reticence. There was hardly a surer road to the Senora's\nfavor, for man or woman, than to be chary of speech and reserved\nin demeanor. She had an instinct of kinship to all that was silent,\nself-contained, mysterious, in human nature. The more she observed\nAlessandro, the more she trusted and approved him. Luckily for Juan Can,\nhe did not know how matters were working in his mistress's mind. If he\nhad, he would have been in a fever of apprehension, and would have got\nat swords' points with Alessandro immediately. On the contrary, all\nunaware of the real situation of affairs, and never quite sure that the\nMexican he dreaded might not any day hear of his misfortune, and appear,\nasking for the place, he took every opportunity to praise Alessandro to\nthe Senora. She never visited his bedside that he had not something to\nsay in favor of the lad, as he called him.\n\n\"Truly, Senora,\" he said again and again, \"I do marvel where the lad\ngot so much knowledge, at his age. He is like an old hand at the sheep\nbusiness. He knows more than any shepherd I have,--a deal more; and it\nis not only of sheep. He has had experience, too, in the handling of\ncattle. Juan Jose has been beholden to him more than once, already, for\na remedy of which he knew not. And such modesty, withal. I knew not that\nthere were such Indians; surely there cannot be many such.\"\n\n\"No, I fancy not,\" the Senora would reply, absently. \"His father is a\nman of intelligence, and has trained his son well.\"\n\n\"There is nothing he is not ready to do,\" continued Alessandro's\neulogist. \"He is as handy with tools as if he had been 'prenticed to a\ncarpenter. He has made me a new splint for my leg, which was a relief\nlike salve to a wound, so much easier was it than before. He is a good\nlad,--a good lad.\"\n\nNone of these sayings of Juan's were thrown away on the Senora. More and\nmore closely she watched Alessandro; and the very thing which Juan\nhad feared, and which he had thought to avert by having Alessandro his\ntemporary substitute, was slowly coming to pass. The idea was working\nin the Senora's mind, that she might do a worse thing than engage this\nyoung, strong, active, willing man to remain permanently in her employ.\nThe possibility of an Indian's being so born and placed that he would\nhesitate about becoming permanently a servant even to the Senora Moreno,\ndid not occur to her. However, she would do nothing hastily. There would\nbe plenty of time before Juan Can's leg was well. She would study the\nyoung man more. In the mean time, she would cause Felipe to think of the\nidea, and propose it.\n\nSo one day she said to Felipe: \"What a voice that Alessandro has,\nFelipe. We shall miss his music sorely when he goes, shall we not?\"\n\n\"He's not going!\" exclaimed Felipe, startled.\n\n\"Oh, no, no; not at present. He agreed to stay till Juan Can was\nabout again; but that will be not more than six weeks now, or eight, I\nsuppose. You forget how time has flown while you have been lying here\nill, my son.\"\n\n\"True, true!\" said Felipe. \"Is it really a month already?\" and he\nsighed.\n\n\"Juan Can tells me that the lad has a marvellous knowledge for one of\nhis years,\" continued the Senora. \"He says he is as skilled with cattle\nas with sheep; knows more than any shepherd we have on the place. He\nseems wonderfully quiet and well-mannered. I never saw an Indian who had\nsuch behavior.\"\n\n\"Old Pablo is just like him,\" said Felipe. \"It was natural enough,\nliving so long with Father Peyri. And I've seen other Indians, too, with\na good deal the same manner as Alessandro. It's born in them.\"\n\n\"I can't bear the idea of Alessandro's going away. But by that time you\nwill be well and strong,\" said the Senora; \"you would not miss him then,\nwould you?\"\n\n\"Yes, I would, too!\" said Felipe, pettishly. He was still weak enough to\nbe childish. \"I like him about me. He's worth a dozen times as much as\nany man we've got. But I don't suppose money could hire him to stay on\nany ranch.\"\n\n\"Were you thinking of hiring him permanently?\" asked the Senora, in a\nsurprised tone. \"I don't doubt you could do so if you wished. They are\nall poor, I suppose; he would not work with the shearers if he were not\npoor.\"\n\n\"Oh, it isn't that,\" said Felipe, impatiently. \"You can't understand,\nbecause you've never been among them. But they are just as proud as we\nare. Some of them, I mean; such men as old Pablo. They shear sheep for\nmoney just as I sell wool for money. There isn't so much difference.\nAlessandro's men in the band obey him, and all the men in the village\nobey Pablo, just as implicitly as my men here obey me. Faith, much more\nso!\" added Felipe, laughing. \"You can't understand it, mother, but it's\nso. I am not at all sure I could offer Alessandro Assis money enough to\ntempt him to stay here as my servant.\"\n\nThe Senora's nostrils dilated in scorn. \"No, I do not understand it,\"\nshe said. \"Most certainly I do not understand it. Of what is it that\nthese noble lords of villages are so proud? their ancestors,--naked\nsavages less than a hundred years ago? Naked savages they themselves\ntoo, to-day, if we had not come here to teach and civilize them. The\nrace was never meant for anything but servants. That was all the Fathers\never expected to make of them,--good, faithful Catholics, and contented\nlaborers in the fields. Of course there are always exceptional\ninstances, and I think, myself, Alessandro is one. I don't believe,\nhowever, he is so exceptional, but that if you were to offer him, for\ninstance, the same wages you pay Juan Can, he would jump at the chance\nof staying on the place.\"\n\n\"Well, I shall think about it,\" said Felipe. \"I'd like nothing better\nthan to have him here always. He's a fellow I heartily like. I'll think\nabout it.\"\n\nWhich was all the Senora wanted done at present.\n\nRamona had chanced to come in as this conversation was going on. Hearing\nAlessandro's name she seated herself at the window, looking out, but\nlistening intently. The month had done much for Alessandro with\nRamona, though neither Alessandro nor Ramona knew it. It had done\nthis much,--that Ramona knew always when Alessandro was near, that she\ntrusted him, and that she had ceased to think of him as an Indian any\nmore than when she thought of Felipe, she thought of him as a Mexican.\nMoreover, seeing the two men frequently together, she had admitted to\nherself, as Margarita had done before her, that Alessandro was far the\nhandsomer man of the two. This Ramona did not like to admit, but she\ncould not help it.\n\n\"I wish Felipe were as tall and strong as Alessandro,\" she said to\nherself many a time. \"I do not see why he could not have been. I wonder\nif the Senora sees how much handsomer Alessandro is.\"\n\nWhen Felipe said that he did not believe he could offer Alessandro Assis\nmoney enough to tempt him to stay on the place, Ramona opened her lips\nsuddenly, as if to speak, then changed her mind, and remained silent.\nShe had sometimes displeased the Senora by taking part in conversations\nbetween her and her son.\n\nFelipe saw the motion, but he also thought it wiser to wait till after\nhis mother had left the room, before he asked Ramona what she was on the\npoint of saying. As soon as the Senora went out, he said, \"What was it,\nRamona, you were going to say just now?\"\n\nRamona colored. She had decided not to say it.\n\n\"Tell me, Ramona,\" persisted Felipe. \"You were going to say something\nabout Alessandro's staying; I know you were.\"\n\nRamona did not answer. For the first time in her life she found herself\nembarrassed before Felipe.\n\n\"Don't you like Alessandro?\" said Felipe.\n\n\"Oh, yes!\" replied Ramona, with instant eagerness. \"It was not that at\nall. I like him very much;\" But then she stopped.\n\n\"Well, what is it, then? Have you heard anything on the place about his\nstaying?\"\n\n\"Oh, no, no; not a word!\" said Ramona. \"Everybody understands that he is\nhere only till Juan Can gets well. But you said you did not believe you\ncould offer him money enough to tempt him to stay.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Felipe, inquiringly, \"I do not. Do you?\"\n\n\"I think he would like to stay,\" said Ramona, hesitatingly. \"That was\nwhat I was going to say.\"\n\n\"What makes you think so?\" asked Felipe.\n\n\"I don't know,\" Ramona said, still more hesitatingly. Now that she had\nsaid it, she was sorry. Felipe looked curiously at her. Hesitancy like\nthis, doubts, uncertainty as to her impressions, were not characteristic\nof Ramona. A flitting something which was far from being suspicion\nor jealousy, and yet was of kin to them both, went through Felipe's\nmind,--went through so swiftly that he was scarce conscious of it; if\nhe had been, he would have scorned himself. Jealous of an Indian\nsheep-shearers Impossible! Nevertheless, the flitting something left a\ntrace, and prevented Felipe from forgetting the trivial incident; and\nafter this, it was certain that Felipe would observe Ramona more closely\nthan he had done; would weigh her words and actions; and if she should\nseem by a shade altered in either, would watch still more closely.\nMeshes were closing around Ramona. Three watchers of her every look and\nact,--Alessandro in pure love, Margarita in jealous hate, Felipe in love\nand perplexity. Only the Senora observed her not. If she had,\nmatters might have turned out very differently, for the Senora was\nclear-sighted, rarely mistaken in her reading of people's motives, never\nlong deceived; but her observing and discriminating powers were not in\nfocus, so far as Ramona was concerned. The girl was curiously outside of\nthe Senora's real life. Shelter, food, clothes, all external needs, in\nso far as her means allowed, the Senora would, without fail, provide for\nthe child her sister had left in her hands as a trust; but a personal\nrelation with her, a mother's affection, or even interest and\nacquaintance, no. The Senora had not that to give. And if she had it\nnot, was she to blame? What could she do? Years ago Father Salvierderra\nhad left off remonstrating with her on this point. \"Is there more I\nshould do for the child? Do you see aught lacking, aught amiss?\" the\nSenora would ask, conscientiously, but with pride. And the Father, thus\ninquired of, could not point out a duty which had been neglected.\n\n\"You do not love her, my daughter,\" he said.\n\n\"No.\" Senora Moreno's truthfulness was of the adamantine order. \"No, I\ndo not. I cannot. One cannot love by act of will.\"\n\n\"That is true,\" the Father would say sadly; \"but affection may be\ncultivated.\"\n\n\"Yes, if it exists,\" was the Senora's constant answer. \"But in this case\nit does not exist. I shall never love Ramona. Only at your command, and\nto save my sister a sorrow, I took her. I will never fail in my duty to\nher.\"\n\nIt was of no use. As well say to the mountain, \"Be cast into the sea,\"\nas try to turn the Senora's heart in any direction whither it did not of\nitself tend. All that Father Salvierderra could do, was to love Ramona\nthe more himself, which he did heartily, and more and more each year,\nand small marvel at it; for a gentler, sweeter maiden never drew breath\nthan this same Ramona, who had been all these years, save for Felipe,\nlonely in the Senora Moreno's house.\n\nThree watchers of Ramona now. If there had been a fourth, and that\nfourth herself, matters might have turned out differently. But how\nshould Ramona watch? How should Ramona know? Except for her two years at\nschool with the nuns, she had never been away from the Senora's house.\nFelipe was the only young man she had known,--Felipe, her brother since\nshe was five years old.\n\nThere were no gayeties in the Senora Moreno's home. Felipe, when he\nneeded them, went one day's journey, or two, or three, to get them; went\nas often as he liked. Ramona never went. How many times she had longed\nto go to Santa Barbara, or to Monterey, or Los Angeles; but to have\nasked the Senora's permission to accompany her on some of her now\ninfrequent journeys to these places would have required more courage\nthan Ramona possessed. It was now three years since she left the convent\nschool, but she was still as fresh from the hands of the nuns as on the\nday when, with loving tears, they had kissed her in farewell. The few\nromances and tales and bits of verse she had read were of the most\ninnocent and old-fashioned kind, and left her hardly less childlike than\nbefore. This childlikeness, combined with her happy temperament, had\nkept her singularly contented in her monotonous life. She had fed the\nbirds, taken care of the flowers, kept the chapel in order, helped in\nlight household work, embroidered, sung, and, as the Senora eight\nyears before had bade her do, said her prayers and pleased Father\nSalvierderra.\n\nBy processes strangely unlike, she and Alessandro had both been kept\nstrangely free from thoughts of love and of marriage,--he by living in\nthe shadow, and she by living in the sun; his heart and thoughts filled\nwith perplexities and fears, hers filled by a placid routine of light\nand easy tasks, and the outdoor pleasures of a child.\n\nAs the days went on, and Felipe still remained feeble, Alessandro\nmeditated a bold stroke. Each time that he went to Felipe's room to sing\nor to play, he felt himself oppressed by the air. An hour of it made him\nuncomfortable. The room was large, and had two windows, and the door was\nnever shut; yet the air seemed to Alessandro stifling.\n\n\"I should be as ill as the Senor Felipe, if I had to stay in that room,\nand a bed is a weakening thing, enough to pull the strongest man down,\"\nsaid Alessandro to Juan Can one day. \"Do you think I should anger them\nif I asked them to let me bring Senor Felipe out to the veranda and put\nhim on a bed of my making? I'd wager my head I'd put him on his feet in\na week.\"\n\n\"And if you did that, you might ask the Senora for the half of the\nestate, and get it, lad,\" replied Juan, Seeing the hot blood darkening\nin Alessandro's face at his words, he hastened to add, \"Do not be so\nhot-blooded. I meant not that you would ask any reward for doing it; I\nwas only thinking what joy it would be to the Senora to see Senor Felipe\non his feet again. It has often crossed my thoughts that if he did not\nget up from this sickness the Senora would not be long behind him. It is\nbut for him that she lives. And who would have the estate in that case,\nI have never been able to find out.\"\n\n\"Would it not be the Senorita?\" asked Alessandro.\n\nJuan Can laughed an ugly laugh. \"Ha, ha! Let the Senora hear you say\nthat!\" he said. \"Faith, it will be little the Senorita gets more\nthan enough for her bread, may be, out of the Moreno estate. Hark ye,\nAlessandro; if you will not tell, I will tell you the story of the\nSenorita. You know she is not of the Moreno blood; is no relation of\ntheirs.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Alessandro; \"Margarita has said to me that the Senorita\nRamona was only the foster-child of the Senora Moreno.\"\n\n\"Foster-child!\" repeated Juan Can, contemptuously, \"there is something\nto the tale I know not, nor ever could find out; for when I was in\nMonterey the Ortegna house was shut, and I could not get speech of any\nof their people. But this much I know, that it was the Senora Ortegna\nthat had the girl first in keeping; and there was a scandalous tale\nabout her birth.\"\n\nIf Juan Can's eyes had not been purblind with old age, he would have\nseen that in Alessandro's face which would have made him choose his\nwords more carefully. But he went on: \"It was after the Senora Ortegna\nwas buried, that our Senora returned, bringing this child with her; and\nI do assure you, lad, I have seen the Senora look at her many a time as\nif she wished her dead. And it is a shame, for she was always as fair\nand good a child as the saints ever saw. But a stain on the blood, a\nstain on the blood, lad, is a bitter thing in a house. This much I know,\nher mother was an Indian. Once when I was in the chapel, behind the big\nSaint Joseph there, I overheard the Senora say as much. She was talking\nto Father Salvierderra, and she said, 'If the child had only the one\nblood in her veins, it would be different. I like not these crosses with\nIndians.'\"\n\nIf Alessandro had been civilized, he would at this word \"Indian\" have\nbounded to his feet. Being Alessandro, he stood if possible stiller than\nbefore, and said in a low voice, \"How know you it was the mother that\nwas the Indian?\"\n\nJuan laughed again, maliciously: \"Ha, it is the Ortegna face she has;\nand that Ortegna, why, he was the scandal byword of the whole coast.\nThere was not a decent woman would have spoken to him, except for his\nwife's sake.\"\n\n\"But did you not say that it was in the Senora Ortegna's keeping that\nthe child was?\" asked Alessandro, breathing harder and faster each\nmoment now; stupid old Juan Can so absorbed in relish of his gossip,\nthat he noticed nothing.\n\n\"Ay, ay. So I said,\" he went on; \"and so it was. There be such saints,\nyou know; though the Lord knows if she had been minded to give shelter\nto all her husband's bastards, she might have taken lease of a church to\nhold them. But there was a story about a man's coming with this infant\nand leaving it in the Senora's room; and she, poor lady, never having\nhad a child of her own, did warm to it at first sight, and kept it with\nher to the last; and I wager me, a hard time she had to get our Senora\nto take the child when she died; except that it was to spite Ortegna, I\nthink our Senora would as soon the child had been dead.\"\n\n\"Has she not treated her kindly?\" asked Alessandro, in a husky voice.\n\nJuan Can's pride resented this question. \"Do you suppose the Senora\nMoreno would do an unkindness to one under her roof?\" he asked loftily.\n\"The Senorita has been always, in all things, like Senor Felipe himself.\nIt was so that she promised the Senora Ortegna, I have heard.\"\n\n\"Does the Senorita know all this?\" asked Alessandro.\n\nJuan Can crossed himself. \"Saints save us, no!\" he exclaimed. \"I'll not\nforget, to my longest day, what it cost me, once I spoke in her hearing,\nwhen she was yet small. I did not know she heard; but she went to the\nSenora, asking who was her mother. And she said I had said her mother\nwas no good, which in faith I did, and no wonder. And the Senora came to\nme, and said she, 'Juan Canito, you have been a long time in our house;\nbut if ever I hear of your mentioning aught concerning the Senorita\nRamona, on this estate or anywhere else in the country, that day you\nleave my service!'--And you'd not do me the ill-turn to speak of it,\nAlessandro, now?\" said the old man, anxiously. \"My tongue runs away with\nme, lying here on this cursed bed, with nothing to do,--an active man\nlike me.\"\n\n\"No, I'll not speak of it, you may be assured,\" said Alessandro, walking\naway slowly.\n\n\"Here! Here!\" called Juan. \"What about that plan you had for making a\nbed for Senor Felipe on the verandah Was it of raw-hide you meant?\"\n\n\"Ah, I had forgotten,\" said Alessandro, returning. \"Yes, that was it.\nThere is great virtue in a raw-hide, tight stretched; my father says\nthat it is the only bed the Fathers would ever sleep on, in the Mission\ndays. I myself like the ground even better; but my father sleeps always\non the rawhide. He says it keeps him well. Do you think I might speak of\nit to the Senora?\"\n\n\"Speak of it to Senor Felipe himself,\" said Juan. \"It will be as he\nsays. He rules this place now, from beginning to end; and it is but\nyesterday I held him on my knee. It is soon that the old are pushed to\nthe wall, Alessandro.\"\n\n\"Nay, Juan Canito,\" replied Alessandro, kindly. \"It is not so. My father\nis many years older than you are, and he rules our people to-day as\nfirmly as ever. I myself obey him, as if I were a lad still.\"\n\n\"What else, then, but a lad do you call yourself, I wonder?\" thought\nJuan; but he answered, \"It is not so with us. The old are not held in\nsuch reverence.\"\n\n\"That is not well,\" replied Alessandro. \"We have been taught\ndifferently. There is an old man in our village who is many, many years\nolder than my father. He helped to carry the mortar at the building of\nthe San Diego Mission, I do not know how many years ago. He is long past\na hundred years of age. He is blind and childish, and cannot walk; but\nhe is cared for by every one. And we bring him in our arms to every\ncouncil, and set him by my father's side. He talks very foolishly\nsometimes, but my father will not let him be interrupted. He says\nit brings bad luck to affront the aged. We will presently be aged\nourselves.\"\n\n\"Ay, ay!\" said Juan, sadly. \"We must all come to it. It is beginning to\nlook not so far off to me!\"\n\nAlessandro stared, no less astonished at Juan Can's unconscious\nrevelation of his standard of measurement of years than Juan had been\nat his. \"Faith, old man, what name dost give to yourself to-day!\" he\nthought; but went on with the topic of the raw-hide bed. \"I may not so\nsoon get speech with Senor Felipe,\" he said. \"It is usually when he is\nsleepy that I go to play for him or to sing. But it makes my heart heavy\nto see him thus languishing day by day, and all for lack of the air and\nthe sun, I do believe, indeed, Juan.\"\n\n\"Ask the Senorita, then,\" said Juan. \"She has his ear at all times.\"\n\nAlessandro made no answer. Why was it that it did not please him,--this\nsuggestion of speaking to Ramona of his plan for Felipe's welfare? He\ncould not have told; but he did not wish to speak of it to her.\n\n\"I will speak to the Senora,\" he said; and as luck would have it, at\nthat moment the Senora stood in the doorway, come to ask after Juan\nCan's health.\n\nThe suggestion of the raw-hide bed struck her favorably. She herself\nhad, in her youth, heard much of their virtues, and slept on them.\n\"Yes,\" she said, \"they are good. We will try it. It was only yesterday\nthat Senor Felipe was complaining of the bed he lies on; and when he\nwas well, he thought nothing could be so good; he brought it here, at a\ngreat price, for me, but I could not lie on it. It seemed as if it would\nthrow me off as soon as I lay down; it is a cheating device, like all\nthese innovations the Americans have brought into the country. But Senor\nFelipe till now thought it a luxury; now he tosses on it, and says it is\nthrowing him all the time.\"\n\nAlessandro smiled, in spite of his reverence for the Senora. \"I once lay\ndown on one myself, Senora,\" he said, \"and that was what I said to my\nfather. It was like a wild horse under me, making himself ready to buck.\nI thought perhaps the invention was of the saints, that men should not\nsleep too long.\"\n\n\"There is a pile of raw-hides,\" said Juan, \"well cured, but not too\nstiff; Juan Jose was to have sent them off to-day to be sold; one of\nthose will be just right. It must not be too dry.\"\n\n\"The fresher the better,\" said Alessandro, \"so it have no dampness.\nShall I make the bed, Senora?\" he asked, \"and will the Senora permit\nthat I make it on the veranda? I was just asking Juan Can if he thought\nI might be so bold as to ask you to let me bring Senor Felipe into the\nouter air. With us, it is thought death to be shut up in walls, as he\nhas been so long. Not till we are sure to die, do we go into the dark\nlike that.\"\n\nThe Senora hesitated. She did not share Alessandro's prejudice in favor\nof fresh air.\n\n\"Night and day both?\" she said. \"Surely it is not well to sleep out in\nthe night?\"\n\n\"That is the best of all, Senora,\" replied Alessandro, earnestly. \"I beg\nthe Senora to try it. If Senor Felipe have not mended greatly after the\nfirst night he had so slept, then Alessandro will be a liar.\"\n\n\"No, only mistaken,\" said the Senora, gently. She felt herself greatly\ndrawn to this young man by his devotion, as she thought, of Felipe.\n\"When I die and leave Felipe here,\" she had more than once said to\nherself, \"it would be a great good to him to have such a servant as this\non the place.\"\n\n\"Very well, Alessandro,\" she replied; \"make the bed, and we will try it\nat once.\"\n\nThis was early in the forenoon. The sun was still high in the west,\nwhen Ramona, sitting as usual in the veranda, at her embroidery, saw\nAlessandro coming, followed by two men, bearing the raw-hide bed.\n\n\"What can that be?\" she said. \"Some new invention of Alessandro's, but\nfor what?\"\n\n\"A bed for the Senor Felipe, Senorita,\" said Alessandro, running lightly\nup the steps. \"The Senora has given permission to place it here on the\nveranda, and Senor Felipe is to lie here day and night; and it will be\na marvel in your eyes how he will gain strength. It is the close room\nwhich is keeping him weak now; he has no illness.\"\n\n\"I believe that is the truth, Alessandro,\" exclaimed Ramona; \"I have\nbeen thinking the same thing. My head aches after I am in that room but\nan hour, and when I come here I am well. But the nights too, Alessandro?\nIs it not harmful to sleep out in the night air?\"\n\n\"Why, Senorita?\" asked Alessandro, simply.\n\nAnd Ramona had no answer, except, \"I do not know; I have always heard\nso.\"\n\n\"My people do not think so,\" replied Alessandro; \"unless it is cold,\nwe like it better. It is good, Senorita, to look up at the sky in the\nnight.\"\n\n\"I should think it would be,\" cried Ramona. \"I never thought of it. I\nshould like to do it.\"\n\nAlessandro was busy, with his face bent down, arranging the bedstead in\na sheltered corner of the veranda. If his face had been lifted, Ramona\nwould have seen a look on it that would have startled her more than\nthe one she had surprised a few days previous, after the incident with\nMargarita. All day there had been coming and going in Alessandro's brain\na confused procession of thoughts, vague yet intense. Put in words,\nthey would have been found to be little more than ringing changes on\nthis idea: \"The Senorita Ramona has Indian blood in her veins. The\nSenorita Ramona is alone. The Senora loves her not. Indian blood! Indian\nblood!\" These, or something like them, would have been the words; but\nAlessandro did not put them in words. He only worked away on the rough\nposts for Senor Felipe's bedstead, hammered, fitted, stretched the\nraw-hide and made it tight and firm, driving every nail, striking every\nblow, with a bounding sense of exultant strength, as if there were\nsuddenly all around him a new heaven and a new earth.\n\nNow, when he heard Ramona say suddenly in her girlish, eager tone, \"It\nmust be; I never thought of it; I should like to try it,\" these vague\nconfused thoughts of the day, and the day's bounding sense of exultant\nstrength, combined in a quick vision before Alessandro's eyes,--a vision\nof starry skies overhead, Ramona and himself together, looking up to\nthem. But when he raised his head, all he said was, \"There, Senorita!\nThat is all firm, now. If Senor Felipe will let me lay him an this bed,\nhe will sleep as he has not slept since he fell ill.\"\n\nRamona ran eagerly into Felipe's room, \"The bed is all ready on the\nveranda,\" she exclaimed. \"Shall Alessandro come in and carry you out?\"\n\nFelipe looked up, startled. The Senora turned on Ramona that expression\nof gentle, resigned displeasure, which always hurt the girl's sensitive\nnature far worse than anger. \"I had not spoken to Felipe yet of the\nchange, Ramona,\" she said. \"I supposed that Alessandro would have\ninformed me when the bed was ready; I am sorry you came in so suddenly.\nFelipe is still very weak, you see.\"\n\n\"What is it? What is it?\" exclaimed Felipe, impatiently.\n\nAs soon as it was explained to him, he was like a child in his haste to\nbe moved.\n\n\"That's just what I needed!\" he exclaimed. \"This cursed bed racks every\nbone in my body, and I have longed for the sun more than ever a thirsty\nman longed for water. Bless you, Alessandro,\" he went on, seeing\nAlessandro in the doorway. \"Come here, and take me up in those long arms\nof yours, and carry me quick. Already I feel myself better.\"\n\nAlessandro lifted him as if he were a baby; indeed, it was but a light\nburden now, Felipe's wasted body, for a man much less strong than\nAlessandro to lift.\n\nRamona, chilled and hurt, ran in advance, carrying pillows and blankets.\nAs she began to arrange them on the couch, the Senora took them from her\nhands, saying, \"I will arrange them myself;\" and waved Ramona away.\n\nIt was a little thing. Ramona was well used to such. Ordinarily it would\nhave given her no pain she could not conceal. But the girl's nerves were\nnot now in equilibrium. She had had hard work to keep back her tears\nat the first rebuff. This second was too much. She turned, and walked\nswiftly away, the tears rolling down her cheeks.\n\nAlessandro saw it; Felipe saw it.\n\nTo Felipe the sight was, though painful, not a surprise. He knew but\ntoo well how often his mother hurt Ramona. All he thought now, in his\nweakness, was, \"Alas! what a pity my mother does not love Ramona!\"\n\nTo Alessandro the sight was the one drop too much in the cup. As he\nstooped to lay Felipe on the bed, he trembled so that Felipe looked up,\nhalf afraid.\n\n\"Am I still so heavy, Alessandro?\" he said smiling.\n\n\"It is not your weight, Senor Felipe,\" answered Alessandro, off guard,\nstill trembling, his eyes following Ramona.\n\nFelipe saw. In the next second, the eyes of the two young men met.\nAlessandro's fell before Felipe's. Felipe gazed on, steadily, at\nAlessandro.\n\n\"Ah!\" he said; and as he said it, he closed his eyes, and let his head\nsink back into the pillow.\n\n\"Is that comfortable? Is that right?\" asked the Senora, who had seen\nnothing.\n\n\"The first comfortable moment I have had, mother,\" said Felipe. \"Stay,\nAlessandro, I want to speak to you as soon as I am rested. This move has\nshaken me up a good deal. Wait.\"\n\n\"Yes, Senor,\" replied Alessandro, and seated himself on the veranda\nsteps.\n\n\"If you are to stay, Alessandro,\" said the Senora, \"I will go and look\nafter some matters that need my attention. I feel always at ease about\nSenor Felipe when you are with him. You will stay till I come back?\"\n\n\"Yes, Senora,\" said Alessandro, in a tone cold as the Senora's own had\nbeen to Ramona. He was no longer in heart the Senora Moreno's servant.\nIn fact, he was at that very moment revolving confusedly in his mind\nwhether there could be any possibility of his getting away before the\nexpiration of the time for which he had agreed to stay.\n\nIt was a long time before Felipe opened his eyes. Alessandro thought he\nwas asleep.\n\nAt last Felipe spoke. He had been watching Alessandro's face for some\nminutes. \"Alessandro,\" he said.\n\nAlessandro sprang to his feet, and walked swiftly to the bedside. He did\nnot know what the next word might be. He felt that the Senor Felipe had\nseen straight into his heart in that one moment's look, and Alessandro\nwas preparing for anything.\n\n\"Alessandro,\" said Felipe, \"my mother has been speaking to me about your\nremaining with us permanently. Juan Can is now very old, and after this\naccident will go on crutches the rest of his days, poor soul! We are in\ngreat need of some man who understands sheep, and the care of the place\ngenerally.\"\n\nAs he spoke, he watched Alessandro's face closely. Swift changing\nexpressions passed over it. Surprise predominated. Felipe misunderstood\nthe surprise. \"I knew you would be surprised,\" he said. \"I told my\nmother that you would not think of it; that you had stayed now only\nbecause we were in trouble.\"\n\nAlessandro bowed his head gratefully. This recognition from Felipe gave\nhim pleasure.\n\n\"Yes, Senor,\" he said, \"that was it. I told Father Salvierderra it was\nnot for the wages. But my father and I have need of all the money we can\nearn. Our people are very poor, Senor. I do not know whether my father\nwould think I ought to take the place you offer me, or not, Senor. It\nwould be as he said. I will ask him.\"\n\n\"Then you would be willing to take it?\" asked Felipe.\n\n\"Yes, Senor, if my father wished me to take it,\" replied Alessandro,\nlooking steadily and gravely at Felipe; adding, after a second's\npause, \"if you are sure that you desire it, Senor Felipe, it would be a\npleasure to me to be of help to you.\"\n\nAnd yet it was only a few moments ago that Alessandro had been turning\nover in his mind the possibility of leaving the Senora Moreno's service\nimmediately. This change had not been a caprice, not been an impulse\nof passionate desire to remain near Ramona; it had come from a sudden\nconsciousness that the Senor Felipe would be his friend. And Alessandro\nwas not mistaken.\n\n\n\n\nIX\n\nWHEN the Senora came back to the veranda, she found Felipe asleep,\nAlessandro standing at the foot of the bed, with his arms crossed on his\nbreast, watching him. As the Senora drew near, Alessandro felt again the\nsame sense of dawning hatred which had seized him at her harsh speech to\nRamona. He lowered his eyes, and waited to be dismissed.\n\n\"You can go now, Alessandro,\" said the Senora. \"I will sit here. You\nare quite sure that it will be safe for Senor Felipe to sleep here all\nnight?\"\n\n\"It will cure him before many nights,\" replied Alessandro, still without\nraising his eyes, and turning to go.\n\n\"Stay,\" said the Senora. Alessandro paused. \"It will not do for him to\nbe alone here in the night, Alessandro.\"\n\nAlessandro had thought of this, and had remembered that if he lay on\nthe veranda floor by Senor Felipe's side, he would also lie under the\nSenorita's window.\n\n\"No, Senora,\" he replied. \"I will lie here by his side. That was what I\nhad thought, if the Senora is willing.\"\n\n\"Thank you, Alessandro,\" said the Senora, in a tone which would have\nsurprised poor Ramona, still sitting alone in her room, with sad eyes.\nShe did not know the Senora could speak thus sweetly to any one but\nFelipe. \"Thank you! You are kind. I will have a bed made for you.\"\n\n\"Oh, no.\" cried Alessandro; \"if the Senora will excuse me, I could not\nlie on a bed. A raw-hide like Senor Felipe's, and my blanket, are all I\nwant. I could not lie on any bed.\"\n\n\"To be sure,\" thought the Senora; \"what was I thinking of! How the\nboy makes one forget he is an Indian! But the floor is harder than the\nground, Alessandro,\" she said kindly.\n\n\"No, Senora,\" he said, \"it is all one; and to-night I will not sleep.\nI will watch Senor Felipe, in case there should be a wind, or he should\nwake and need something.\"\n\n\"I will watch him myself till midnight,\" said the Senora. \"I should feel\neasier to see how he sleeps at first.\"\n\nIt was the balmiest of summer nights, and as still as if no living thing\nwere on the earth. There was a full moon, which shone on the garden, and\non the white front of the little chapel among the trees. Ramona, from\nher window, saw Alessandro pacing up and down the walk. She had seen him\nspread down the raw-hide by Felipe's bed, and had seen the Senora take\nher place in one of the big carved chairs. She wondered if they were\nboth going to watch; she wondered why the Senora would never let her sit\nup and watch with Felipe.\n\n\"I am not of any use to anybody,\" she thought sadly. She dared not\ngo out and ask any questions about the arrangements for the night. At\nsupper the Senora had spoken to her only in the same cold and distant\nmanner which always made her dumb and afraid. She had not once seen\nFelipe alone during the day. Margarita, who, in the former times,--ah,\nhow far away those former times looked now!--had been a greater comfort\nto Ramona than she realized,--Margarita now was sulky and silent, never\ncame into Ramona's presence if she could help it, and looked at her\nsometimes with an expression which made Ramona tremble, and say to\nherself, \"She hates me; She has always hated me since that morning.\"\n\nIt had been a long, sad day to Ramona; and as she sat in her window\nleaning her head against the sash, and looked at Alessandro pacing up\nand down, she felt for the first time, and did not shrink from it nor in\nany wise disavow or disguise it to herself, that she was glad he loved\nher. More than this she did not think; beyond this she did not go.\nHer mind was not like Margarita's, full of fancies bred of freedom in\nintercourse with men. But distinctly, tenderly glad that Alessandro\nloved her, and distinctly, tenderly aware how well he loved her, she\nwas, as she sat at her window this night, looking out into the moonlit\ngarden; after she had gone to bed, she could still hear his slow,\nregular steps on the garden-walk, and the last thought she had, as she\nfell asleep, was that she was glad Alessandro loved her.\n\nThe moon had been long set, and the garden, chapel-front, trees, vines,\nwere all wrapped in impenetrable darkness, when Ramona awoke, sat up in\nher bed, and listened. All was so still that the sound of Felipe's low,\nregular breathing came in through her open window. After hearkening to\nit for a few moments, she rose noiselessly from her bed, and creeping to\nthe window parted the curtains and looked out; noiselessly, she thought;\nbut it was not noiselessly enough to escape Alessandro's quick ear;\nwithout a sound, he sprang to his feet, and stood looking at Ramona's\nwindow.\n\n\"I am here, Senorita,\" he whispered. \"Do you want anything?\"\n\n\"Has he slept all night like this?\" she whispered back.\n\n\"Yes, Senorita. He has not once moved.\"\n\n\"How good!\" said Ramona. \"How good!\"\n\nThen she stood still; she wanted to speak again to Alessandro, to hear\nhim speak again, but she could think of no more to say. Because she\ncould not, she gave a little sigh.\n\nAlessandro took one swift step towards the window. \"May the saints bless\nyou, Senorita,\" he whispered fervently.\n\n\"Thank you, Alessandro,\" murmured Ramona, and glided back to her bed,\nbut not to sleep. It lacked not much of dawn; as the first faint light\nfiltered through the darkness, Ramona heard the Senora's window open.\n\n\"Surely she will not strike up the hymn and wake Felipe,\" thought\nRamona; and she sprang again to the window to listen. A few low words\nbetween the Senora and Alessandro, and then the Senora's window closed\nagain, and all was still.\n\n\"I thought she would not have the heart to wake him,\" said Ramona to\nherself. \"The Virgin would have had no pleasure in our song, I am sure;\nbut I will say a prayer to her instead;\" and she sank on her knees at\nthe head of her bed, and began saying a whispered prayer. The footfall\nof a spider in Ramona's room had not been light enough to escape the\near of that watching lover outside. Again Alessandro's tall figure arose\nfrom the floor, turning towards Ramona's window; and now the darkness\nwas so far softened to dusk, that the outline of his form could be seen.\nRamona felt it rather than saw it, and stopped praying. Alessandro was\nsure he had heard her voice.\n\n\"Did the Senorita speak?\" he whispered, his face close at the curtain.\nRamona, startled, dropped her rosary, which rattled as it fell on the\nwooden floor.\n\n\"No, no, Alessandro,\" she said, \"I did not speak.\" And she trembled,\nshe knew not why. The sound of the beads on the floor explained to\nAlessandro what had been the whispered words he heard.\n\n\"She was at her prayers,\" he thought, ashamed and sorry. \"Forgive me,\"\nhe whispered, \"I thought you called;\" and he stepped back to the outer\nedge of the veranda, and seated himself on the railing. He would lie\ndown no more. Ramona remained on her knees, gazing at the window.\nThrough the transparent muslin curtain the dawning light came slowly,\nsteadily, till at last she could see Alessandro distinctly. Forgetful\nof all else, she knelt gazing at him. The rosary lay on the floor,\nforgotten. Ramona would not finish that prayer, that day. But her heart\nwas full of thanksgiving and gratitude, and the Madonna had a better\nprayer than any in the book.\n\nThe sun was up, and the canaries, finches, and linnets had made the\nveranda ring with joyous racket, before Felipe opened his eyes. The\nSenora had come and gone and come again, looking at him anxiously, but\nhe stirred not. Ramona had stolen timidly out, glancing at Alessandro\nonly long enough to give him one quick smile, and bent over Felipe's\nbed, holding her breath, he lay so still.\n\n\"Ought he to sleep so long?\" she whispered.\n\n\"Till the noon, it may be,\" answered Alessandro; \"and when he wakes, you\nwill see by his eye that he is another man.\"\n\nIt was indeed so. When Felipe first looked about him, he laughed\noutright with pure pleasure. Then catching sight of Alessandro at the\nsteps, he called, in a stronger voice than had yet been heard from him,\n\"Alessandro, you are a famous physician. Why couldn't that fool from\nVentura have known as much? With all his learning, he had had me in the\nnext world before many days, except for you. Now, Alessandro, breakfast!\nI'm hungry. I had forgotten what the thought of food was like to a\nhungry stomach. And plenty! plenty!\" he called, as Alessandro ran toward\nthe kitchen. \"Bring all they have.\"\n\nWhen the Senora saw Felipe bolstered up in the bed, his eye bright,\nhis color good, his voice clear, eating heartily like his old self,\nshe stood like a statue in the middle of the veranda for a moment; then\nturning to Alessandro, she said chokingly, \"May Heaven reward you!\" and\ndisappeared abruptly in her own room. When she came out, her eyes\nwere red. All day she moved and spoke with a softness unwonted, indeed\ninconceivable. She even spoke kindly and without constraint to Ramona.\nShe felt like one brought back from the dead.\n\nAfter this, a new sort of life began for them all. Felipe's bed on\nthe veranda was the rallying point for everything and everybody.. The\nservants came to look up at him, and wish him well, from the garden-walk\nbelow. Juan Can, when he first hobbled out on the stout crutches\nAlessandro had made him of manzanita wood, dragged himself all the way\nround the house, to have a look at Senor Felipe and a word with him. The\nSenora sat there, in the big carved chair, looking like a sibyl with her\nblack silk banded head-dress severely straight across her brow, and her\nlarge dark eyes gazing out, past Felipe, into the far south sky. Ramona\nlived there too, with her embroidery or her book, sitting on cushions on\nthe floor in a corner, or at the foot of Felipe's bed, always so placed,\nhowever,--if anybody had noticed, but nobody did,--so placed that she\ncould look at Felipe without looking full at the Senora's chair, even if\nthe Senora were not in it.\n\nHere also came Alessandro many times a day,--sometimes sent for,\nsometimes of his own accord. He was freely welcome. When he played or\nsang he sat on the upper step of the stairs leading down to the garden.\nHe also had a secret, which he thought all his own, in regard to the\npositions he chose. He sat always, when Ramona was there, in the spot\nwhich best commanded a view of her face. The secret was not all his own.\nFelipe knew it. Nothing was escaping Felipe in these days. A bomb-shell\nexploding at their feet would not have more astonished the different\nmembers of this circle, the Senora, Ramona, Alessandro, than it would\nto have been made suddenly aware of the thoughts which were going on in\nFelipe's mind now, from day to day, as he lay there placidly looking at\nthem all.\n\nIt is probable that if Felipe had been in full health and strength when\nthe revelation suddenly came to him that Alessandro loved Ramona, and\nthat Ramona might love Alessandro, he would have been instantly filled\nwith jealous antagonism. But at the time when this revelation came, he\nwas prostrate, feeble, thinking many times a day that he must soon die;\nit did not seem to Felipe that a man could be so weak as he was, and\never again be strong and well. Side by side with these forebodings of\nhis own death, always came the thought of Ramona. What would become of\nher, if he were gone? Only too well he knew that the girl's heart would\nbe broken; that she could not live on alone with his mother. Felipe\nadored his mother; but he understood her feeling about Ramona.\n\nWith his feebleness had also come to Felipe, as is often the case in\nlong illnesses, a greater clearness of perception. Ramona had ceased to\npuzzle him. He no longer asked himself what her long, steady look into\nhis eyes meant. He knew. He saw it mean that as a sister she loved him,\nhad always loved him, and could love him in no other way. He wondered a\nlittle at himself that this gave him no more pain; only a sort of sweet,\nmournful tenderness towards her. It must be because he was so soon going\nout of the world, he thought. Presently he began to be aware that a new\nquality was coming into his love for her. He himself was returning\nto the brother love which he had had for her when they were children\ntogether, and in which he had felt no change until he became a man and\nRamona a woman. It was strange what a peace fell upon Felipe when this\nwas finally clear and settled in his mind. No doubt he had had more\nmisgiving and fear about his mother in the matter than he had ever\nadmitted to himself; perhaps also the consciousness of Ramona's\nunfortunate birth had rankled at times; but all this was past now.\nRamona was his sister. He was her brother. What course should he pursue\nin the crisis which he saw drawing near? How could he best help Ramona?\nWhat would be best for both her and Alessandro? Long before the thought\nof any possible union between himself and Ramona had entered into\nAlessandro's mind, still longer before it had entered into Ramona's to\nthink of Alessandro as a husband, Felipe had spent hours in forecasting,\nplotting, and planning for them. For the first time in his life he felt\nhimself in the dark as to his mother's probable action. That any concern\nas to Ramona's personal happiness or welfare would influence her, he\nknew better than to think for a moment. So far as that was concerned,\nRamona might wander out the next hour, wife of a homeless beggar,\nand his mother would feel no regret. But Ramona had been the adopted\ndaughter of the Senora Ortegna, bore the Ortegna name, and had lived as\nfoster-child in the house of the Morenos. Would the Senora permit such a\none to marry an Indian?\n\nFelipe doubted. The longer he thought, the more he doubted. The more\nhe watched, the more he saw that the question might soon have to be\ndecided. Any hour might precipitate it. He made plan after plan for\nforestalling trouble, for preparing his mother; but Felipe was by nature\nindolent, and now he was, in addition, feeble. Day after day slipped by.\nIt was exceedingly pleasant on the veranda. Ramona was usually with him;\nhis mother was gentler, less sad, than he had ever seen her. Alessandro\nwas always at hand, ready for any service,--in the field, in the\nhouse,--his music a delight, his strength and fidelity a repose, his\npersonal presence always agreeable. \"If only my mother could think\nit,\" reflected Felipe, \"it would be the best thing, all round, to have\nAlessandro stay here as overseer of the place, and then they might be\nmarried. Perhaps before the summer is over she will come to see it so.\"\n\nAnd the delicious, languid, semi-tropic summer came hovering over the\nvalley. The apricots turned golden, the peaches glowed, the grapes\nfilled and hardened, like opaque emeralds hung thick under the canopied\nvines. The garden was a shade brown, and the roses had all fallen; but\nthere were lilies, and orange-blossoms, and poppies, and carnations, and\ngeraniums in the pots, and musk,--oh, yes, ever and always musk. It was\nlike an enchanter's spell, the knack the Senora had of forever keeping\nrelays of musk to bloom all the year; and it was still more like an\nenchanter's spell, that Felipe would never confess that he hated it.'\nBut the bees liked it, and the humming-birds,--the butterflies also;\nand the air was full of them. The veranda was a quieter place now as the\nseason's noon grew near. The linnets were all nesting, and the finches\nand the canaries too; and the Senora spent hours, every day, tirelessly\nfeeding the mothers. The vines had all grown and spread out to their\nthickest; no need any longer of the gay blanket Alessandro had pinned up\nthat first morning to keep the sun off Felipe's head.\n\nWhat was the odds between a to-day and a to-morrow in such a spot\nas this? \"To-morrow,\" said Felipe, \"I will speak to my mother,\" and\n\"to-morrow,\" and \"to-morrow;\" but he did not.\n\nThere was one close observer of these pleasant veranda days that Felipe\nknew nothing about. That was Margarita. As the girl came and went about\nher household tasks, she was always on the watch for Alessandro, on the\nwatch for Ramona. She was biding her time. Just what shape her revenge\nwas going to take, she did not know. It was no use plotting. It must be\nas it fell out; but that the hour and the way for her revenge would come\nshe never doubted.\n\nWhen she saw the group on the veranda, as she often did, all listening\nto Alessandro's violin, or to his singing, Alessandro himself now at his\nease and free in the circle, as if he had been there always, her anger\nwas almost beyond bounds.\n\n\"Oh, ho! like a member of the family; quite so!\" she sneered. \"It is new\ntimes when a head shepherd spends his time with the ladies of the house,\nand sits in their presence like a guest who is invited! We shall see; we\nshall see what comes of all this!\" And she knew not which she hated the\nmore of the two, Alessandro or Ramona.\n\nSince the day of the scene at the artichoke-field she had never spoken\nto Alessandro, and had avoided, so far as was possible, seeing him. At\nfirst Alessandro was sorry for this, and tried to be friendly with her.\nAs soon as he felt assured that the incident had not hurt him at all in\nthe esteem of Ramona, he began to be sorry for Margarita. \"A man should\nnot be rude to any maiden,\" he thought; and he hated to remember how he\nhad pushed Margarita from him, and snatched his hand away, when he\nhad in the outset made no objection to her taking it. But Margarita's\nresentment was not to be appeased. She understood only too clearly how\nlittle Alessandro's gentle advances meant, and she would none of them.\n\"Let him go to his Senorita,\" she said bitterly, mocking the reverential\ntone in which she had overheard him pronounce the word. \"She is fond\nenough of him, if only the fool had eyes to see it. She'll be ready to\nthrow herself at his head before long, if this kind of thing keeps up.\n'It is not well to speak thus freely of young men, Margarita!' Ha,\nha! Little I thought that day which way the wind set in my mistress's\ntemper! I'll wager she reproves me no more, under this roof or any\nother! Curse her! What did she want of Alessandro, except to turn his\nhead, and then bid him go his way!\"\n\nTo do Margarita justice, she never once dreamed of the possibility of\nRamona's wedding Alessandro. A clandestine affair, an intrigue of more\nor less intensity, such as she herself might have carried on with any\none of the shepherds,--this was the utmost stretch of Margarita's angry\nimaginations in regard to her young mistress's liking for Alessandro.\nThere was not, in her way of looking at things, any impossibility of\nsuch a thing as that. But marriage! It might be questioned whether that\nidea would have been any more startling to the Senora herself than to\nMargarita.\n\nLittle had passed between Alessandro and Ramona which Margarita did not\nknow. The girl was always like a sprite,--here, there, everywhere, in\nan hour, and with eyes which, as her mother often told her, saw on all\nsides of her head. Now, fired by her new purpose, new passion, she moved\nswifter than ever, and saw and heard even more, There were few hours of\nany day when she did not know to a certainty where both Alessandro and\nRamona were; and there had been few meetings between them which she had\nnot either seen or surmised.\n\nIn the simple life of such a household as the Senora's, it was not\nstrange that this was possible; nevertheless, it argued and involved\nuntiring vigilance on Margarita's part. Even Felipe, who thought\nhimself, from his vantage-post of observation on the veranda, and from\nhis familiar relation with Ramona, well informed of most that happened,\nwould have been astonished to hear all that Margarita could have\ntold him. In the first days Ramona herself had guilelessly told him\nmuch,--had told him how Alessandro, seeing her trying to sprinkle and\nbathe and keep alive the green ferns with which she had decorated the\nchapel for Father Salvierderra's coming, had said: \"Oh, Senorita, they\nare dead! Do not take trouble with them! I will bring you fresh ones;\"\nand the next morning she had found, lying at the chapel door, a pile of\nsuch ferns as she had never before seen; tall ones, like ostrich-plumes,\nsix and eight feet high; the feathery maidenhair, and the gold fern, and\nthe silver, twice as large as she ever had found them. The chapel was\nbeautiful, like a conservatory, after she had arranged them in vases and\naround the high candlesticks.\n\nIt was Alessandro, too, who had picked up in the artichoke-patch all\nof the last year's seed-vessels which had not been trampled down by the\ncattle, and bringing one to her, had asked shyly if she did not think\nit prettier than flowers made out of paper. His people, he said, made\nwreaths of them. And so they were, more beautiful than any paper flowers\nwhich ever were made,--great soft round disks of fine straight threads\nlike silk, with a kind of saint's halo around them of sharp, stiff\npoints, glossy as satin, and of a lovely creamy color. It was the\nstrangest thing in the world nobody had ever noticed them as they lay\nthere on the ground. She had put a great wreath of them around Saint\nJoseph's head, and a bunch in the Madonna's hand; and when the Senora\nsaw them, she exclaimed in admiration, and thought they must have been\nmade of silk and satin.\n\nAnd Alessandro had brought her beautiful baskets, made by the Indian\nwomen at Pala, and one which had come from the North, from the Tulare\ncountry; it had gay feathers woven in with the reeds,--red and yellow,\nin alternate rows, round and round. It was like a basket made out of a\nbright-colored bird.\n\nAnd a beautiful stone bowl Alessandro had brought her, glossy black,\nthat came all the way from Catalina Island; a friend of Alessandro's got\nit. For the first few weeks it had seemed as if hardly a day passed\nthat there was not some new token to be chronicled of Alessandro's\nthoughtfulness and good-will. Often, too, Ramona had much to tell that\nAlessandro had said,--tales of the old Mission days that he had heard\nfrom his father; stories of saints, and of the early Fathers, who were\nmore like saints than like men, Alessandro said,--Father Junipero, who\nfounded the first Missions, and Father Crespi, his friend. Alessandro's\ngrandfather had journeyed with Father Crespi as his servant, and many a\nmiracle he had with his own eyes seen Father Crespi perform. There was a\ncup out of which the Father always took his chocolate for breakfast,--a\nbeautiful cup, which was carried in a box, the only luxury the Father\nhad; and one morning it was broken, and everybody was in terror and\ndespair. \"Never mind, never mind,\" said the Father; \"I will make it\nwhole;\" and taking the two pieces in his hands, he held them tight\ntogether, and prayed over them, and they became one solid piece again,\nand it was used all through the journey, just as before.\n\nBut now, Ramona never spoke voluntarily of Alessandro. To Felipe's\nsometimes artfully put questions or allusions to him, she made brief\nreplies, and never continued the topic; and Felipe had observed another\nthing: she now rarely looked at Alessandro. When he was speaking to\nothers she kept her eyes on the ground. If he addressed her, she\nlooked quickly up at him, but lowered her eyes after the first glance.\nAlessandro also observed this, and was glad of it. He understood it. He\nknew how differently she could look in his face in the rare moments when\nthey were alone together. He fondly thought he alone knew this; but he\nwas mistaken. Margarita knew. She had more than once seen it.\n\nIt had happened more than once that he had found Ramona at the willows\nby the brook, and had talked with her there. The first time it happened,\nit was a chance; after that never a chance again, for Alessandro went\noften seeking the spot, hoping to find her. In Ramona's mind too, not\navowed, but half consciously, there was, if not the hope of seeing him\nthere, at least the memory that it was there they had met. It was a\npleasant spot,--cool and shady even at noon, and the running water\nalways full of music. Ramona often knelt there of a morning, washing out\na bit of lace or a handkerchief; and when Alessandro saw her, it went\nhard with him to stay away. At such moments the vision returned to him\nvividly of that first night when, for the first second, seeing her face\nin the sunset glow, he had thought her scarce mortal. It was not that\nhe even now thought her less a saint; but ah, how well he knew her to\nbe human! He had gone alone in the dark to this spot many a time, and,\nlying on the grass, put his hands into the running water, and played\nwith it dreamily, thinking, in his poetic Indian fashion, thoughts like\nthese: \"Whither have gone the drops that passed beneath her hands, just\nhere? These drops will never find those in the sea; but I love this\nwater!\"\n\nMargarita had seen him thus lying, and without dreaming of the refined\nsentiment which prompted his action, had yet groped blindly towards it,\nthinking to herself: \"He hopes his Senorita will come down to him there.\nA nice place it is for a lady to meet her lover, at the washing-stones!\nIt will take swifter water than any in that brook, Senorita Ramona, to\nwash you white in the Senora's eyes, if ever she come upon you there\nwith the head shepherd, making free with him, may be! Oh, but if that\ncould only happen, I'd die content!\" And the more Margarita watched,\nthe more she thought it not unlikely that it might turn out so. It was\noftener at the willows than anywhere else that Ramona and Alessandro\nmet; and, as Margarita noticed with malicious satisfaction, they talked\neach time longer, each time parted more lingeringly. Several times it\nhad happened to be near supper-time; and Margarita, with one eye on\nthe garden-walk, had hovered restlessly near the Senora, hoping to be\nordered to call the Senorita to supper.\n\n\"If but I could come on them of a sudden, and say to her as she did to\nme, 'You are wanted in the house'! Oh, but it would do my soul good! I'd\nsay it so it would sting like a lash laid on both their faces! It will\ncome! It will come! It will be there that she'll be caught one of these\nfine times she's having! I'll wait! It will come!\"\n\n\n\n\nX\n\nIT came. And when it came, it fell out worse for Ramona than Margarita's\nmost malicious hopes had pictured; but Margarita had no hand in it. It\nwas the Senora herself.\n\nSince Felipe had so far gained as to be able to be dressed, sit in his\nchair on the veranda, and walk about the house and garden a little,\nthe Senora, at ease in her mind about him, had resumed her old habit of\nlong, lonely walks on the place. It had been well said by her servants,\nthat there was not a blade of grass on the estate that the Senora had\nnot seen. She knew every inch of her land. She had a special purpose\nin walking over it now. She was carefully examining to see whether she\ncould afford to sell to the Ortegas a piece of pasture-land which they\ngreatly desired to buy, as it joined a pasturage tract of theirs. This\nbit of land lay farther from the house than the Senora realized, and it\nhad taken more time than she thought it would, to go over it; and it was\nalready sunset on this eventful day, when, hurrying home, she turned\noff from the highway into the same shortcut path in which Father\nSalvierderra had met Ramona in the spring. There was no difficulty now\nin getting through the mustard tangle. It was parched and dry, and had\nbeen trampled by cattle. The Senora walked rapidly, but it was\ndusky twilight when she reached the willows; so dusky that she saw\nnothing--and she stepped so lightly on the smooth brown path that she\nmade no sound--until suddenly, face to face with a man and a woman\nstanding locked in each other's arms, she halted, stepped back a pace,\ngave a cry of surprise, and, in the same second, recognized the faces of\nthe two, who, stricken dumb, stood apart, each gazing into her face with\nterror.\n\nStrangely enough, it was Ramona who spoke first. Terror for herself had\nstricken her dumb; terror for Alessandro gave her a voice.\n\n\"Senora,\" she began.\n\n\"Silence! Shameful creature!\" cried the Senora. \"Do not dare to speak!\nGo to your room!\"\n\nRamona did not move.\n\n\"As for you,\" the Senora continued, turning to Alessandro, \"you,\"--she\nwas about to say, \"You are discharged from my service from this hour,\"\nbut recollecting herself in time, said,--\"you will answer to Senor\nFelipe. Out of my sight!\" And the Senora Moreno actually, for once in\nher life beside herself with rage, stamped her foot on the ground. \"Out\nof my sight!\" she repeated.\n\nAlessandro did not stir, except to turn towards Ramona with an inquiring\nlook. He would run no risk of doing what she did not wish. He had no\nidea what she would think it best to do in this terrible dilemma.\n\n\"Go, Alessandro,\" said Ramona, calmly, still looking the Senora full in\nthe eye. Alessandro obeyed; before the words had left her lips, he had\nwalked away.\n\nRamona's composure, and Alessandro's waiting for further orders than her\nown before stirring from the spot, were too much for Senora Moreno. A\nwrath, such as she had not felt since she was young, took possession of\nher. As Ramona opened her lips again, saying, \"Senora,\" the Senora did a\nshameful deed; she struck the girl on the mouth, a cruel blow.\n\n\"Speak not to me!\" she cried again; and seizing her by the arm, she\npushed rather than dragged her up the garden-walk.\n\n\"Senora, you hurt my arm,\" said Ramona, still in the same calm voice.\n\"You need not hold me. I will go with you. I am not afraid.\"\n\nWas this Ramona? The Senora, already ashamed, let go the arm, and\nstared in the girl's face. Even in the twilight she could see upon it\nan expression of transcendent peace, and a resolve of which no one would\nhave thought it capable. \"What does this mean?\" thought the Senora,\nstill weak, and trembling all over, from rage. \"The hussy, the\nhypocrite!\" and she seized the arm again.\n\nThis time Ramona did not remonstrate, but submitted to being led like\na prisoner, pushed into her own room, the door slammed violently and\nlocked on the outside.\n\nAll of which Margarita saw. She had known for an hour that Ramona\nand Alessandro were at the willows, and she had been consumed with\nimpatience at the Senora's prolonged absence. More than once she had\ngone to Felipe, and asked with assumed interest if he were not hungry,\nand if he and the Senorita would not have their supper.\n\n\"No, no, not till the Senora returns,\" Felipe had answered. He, too,\nhappened this time to know where Ramona and Alessandro were. He knew\nalso where the Senora had gone, and that she would be late home; but he\ndid not know that there would be any chance of her returning by way of\nthe willows at the brook; if he had known it, he would have contrived to\nsummon Ramona.\n\nWhen Margarita saw Ramona shoved into her room by the pale and trembling\nSenora, saw the key turned, taken out, and dropped into the Senora's\npocket, she threw her apron over her head, and ran into the back porch.\nAlmost a remorse seized her. She remembered in a flash how often Ramona\nhad helped her in times gone by,--sheltered her from the Senora's\ndispleasure. She recollected the torn altar-cloth. \"Holy Virgin! what\nwill be done to her now?\" she exclaimed, under her breath. Margarita\nhad never conceived of such an extremity as this. Disgrace, and a sharp\nreprimand, and a sundering of all relations with Alessandro,--this was\nall Margarita had meant to draw down on Ramona's head. But the Senora\nlooked as if she might kill her.\n\n\"She always did hate her, in her heart,\" reflected Margarita; \"she\nshan't starve her to death, anyhow. I'll never stand by and see that.\nBut it must have been something shameful the Senora saw, to have brought\nher to such a pass as this;\" and Margarita's jealousy again got the\nbetter of her sympathy. \"Good enough for her. No more than she deserved.\nAn honest fellow like Alessandro, that would make a good husband for any\ngirl!\" Margarita's short-lived remorse was over. She was an enemy again.\n\nIt was an odd thing, how identical were Margarita's and the Senora's\nview and interpretation of the situation. The Senora looking at it from\nabove, and Margarita looking at it from below, each was sure, and they\nwere both equally sure, that it could be nothing more nor less than a\ndisgraceful intrigue. Mistress and maid were alike incapable either of\nconjecturing or of believing the truth.\n\nAs ill luck would have it,--or was it good luck?--Felipe also had\nwitnessed the scene in the garden-walk. Hearing voices, he had looked\nout of his window, and, almost doubting the evidence of his senses, had\nseen his mother violently dragging Ramona by the arm,--Ramona pale, but\nstrangely placid; his mother with rage and fury in her white face. The\nsight told its own tale to Felipe. Smiting his forehead with his hand,\nhe groaned out: \"Fool that I was, to let her be surprised; she has come\non them unawares; now she will never, never forgive it!\" And Felipe\nthrew himself on his bed, to think what should be done. Presently he\nheard his mother's voice, still agitated, calling his name. He remained\nsilent, sure she would soon seek him in his room. When she entered, and,\nseeing him on the bed, came swiftly towards him, saying, \"Felipe, dear,\nare you ill?\" he replied in a feeble voice, \"No, mother, only tired a\nlittle to-night;\" and as she bent over him, anxious, alarmed, he threw\nhis arms around her neck and kissed her warmly. \"Mother mia!\" he said\npassionately, \"what should I do without you?\" The caress, the loving\nwords, acted like oil on the troubled waters. They restored the Senora\nas nothing else could. What mattered anything, so long as she had her\nadoring and adorable son! And she would not speak to him, now that he\nwas so tired, of this disgraceful and vexing matter of Alessandro. It\ncould wait till morning. She would send him his supper in his room, and\nhe would not miss Ramona, perhaps.\n\n\"I will send your supper here, Felipe,\" she said; \"you must not\noverdo; you have been walking too much. Lie still.\" And kissing him\naffectionately, she went to the dining-room, where Margarita, vainly\ntrying to look as if nothing had happened, was standing, ready to serve\nsupper. When the Senora entered, with her countenance composed, and in\nher ordinary tones said, \"Margarita, you can take Senor Felipe's supper\ninto his room; he is lying down, and will not get up; he is tired,\"\nMargarita was ready to doubt if she had not been in a nightmare dream.\nHad she, or had she not, within the last half-hour, seen the Senora,\nshaking and speechless with rage, push the Senorita Ramona into her\nroom, and lock her up there? She was so bewildered that she stood still\nand gazed at the Senora, with her mouth wide open.\n\n\"What are you staring at, girl?\" asked the Senora, so sharply that\nMargarita jumped.\n\n\"Oh, nothing, nothing, Senora! And the Senorita, will she come to\nsupper? Shall I call her?\" she said.\n\nThe Senora eyed her. Had she seen? Could she have seen? The Senora\nMoreno was herself again. So long as Ramona was under her roof, no\nmatter what she herself might do or say to the girl, no servant should\ntreat her with disrespect, or know that aught was wrong.\n\n\"The Senorita is not well,\" she said coldly. \"She is in her room. I\nmyself will take her some supper later, if she wishes it. Do not disturb\nher.\" And the Senora returned to Felipe.\n\nMargarita chuckled inwardly, and proceeded to clear the table she had\nspread with such malicious punctuality two short hours before. In those\ntwo short hours how much had happened!\n\n\"Small appetite for supper will our Senorita have, I reckon,\" said the\nbitter Margarita, \"and the Senor Alessandro also! I'm curious to see how\nhe will carry himself.\"\n\nBut her curiosity was not gratified. Alessandro came not to the kitchen.\nThe last of the herdsmen had eaten and gone; it was past nine o'clock,\nand no Alessandro. Slyly Margarita ran out and searched in some of the\nplaces where she knew he was in the habit of going; but Alessandro\nwas not to be found. Once she brushed so near his hiding-place that he\nthought he was discovered, and was on the point of speaking, but\nluckily held his peace, and she passed on. Alessandro was hid behind the\ngeranium clump at the chapel door; sitting on the ground, with his knees\ndrawn up to his chin, watching Ramona's window. He intended to stay\nthere all night. He felt that he might be needed: if Ramona wanted him,\nshe would either open her window and call, or would come out and go down\nthrough the garden-walk to the willows. In either case, he would see her\nfrom the hiding-place he had chosen. He was racked by his emotions; mad\nwith joy one minute, sick at heart with misgiving the next. Ramona loved\nhim. She had told him so. She had said she would go away with him and\nbe his wife. The words had but just passed her lips, at that dreadful\nmoment when the Senora appeared in their presence. As he lived the scene\nover again, he re-experienced the joy and the terror equally.\n\nWhat was not that terrible Senora capable of doing? Why did she look\nat him and at Ramona with such loathing scorn? Since she knew that the\nSenorita was half Indian, why should she think it so dreadful a thing\nfor her to marry an Indian man? It did not once enter into Alessandro's\nmind, that the Senora could have had any other thought, seeing them as\nshe did, in each other's arms. And again what had he to give to Ramona?\nCould she live in a house such as he must live in,--live as the Temecula\nwomen lived? No! for her sake he must leave his people; must go to some\ntown, must do--he knew not what--something to earn more money. Anguish\nseized him as he pictured to himself Ramona suffering deprivations. The\nmore he thought of the future in this light, the more his joy faded and\nhis fear grew. He had never had sufficient hope that she could be his,\nto look forward thus to the practical details of life; he had only gone\non loving, and in a vague way dreaming and hoping; and now,--now, in\na moment, all had been changed; in a moment he had spoken, and she had\nspoken, and such words once spoken, there was no going back; and he had\nput his arms around her, and felt her head on his shoulder, and kissed\nher! Yes, he, Alessandro, had kissed the Senorita Ramona, and she had\nbeen glad of it, and had kissed him on the lips, as no maiden kisses a\nman unless she will wed with him,--him, Alessandro! Oh, no wonder the\nman's brain whirled, as he sat there in the silent darkness, wondering,\nafraid, helpless; his love wrenched from him, in the very instant of\ntheir first kiss,--wrenched from him, and he himself ordered, by one who\nhad the right to order him, to begone! What could an Indian do against a\nMoreno!\n\nWould Felipe help him? Ay, there was Felipe! That Felipe was his\nfriend, Alessandro knew with a knowledge as sure as the wild partridge's\ninstinct for the shelter of her brood; but could Felipe move the Senora?\nOh, that terrible Senora! What would become of them?\n\nAs in the instant of drowning, men are said to review in a second the\nwhole course of their lives, so in this supreme moment of Alessandro's\nlove there flashed through his mind vivid pictures of every word and act\nof Ramona's since he first knew her. He recollected the tone in which\nshe had said, and the surprise with which he heard her say it, at the\ntime of Felipe's fall, \"You are Alessandro, are you not?\" He heard again\nher soft-whispered prayers the first night Felipe slept on the veranda.\nHe recalled her tender distress because the shearers had had no dinner;\nthe evident terribleness to her of a person going one whole day without\nfood. \"O God! will she always have food each day if she comes with me?\"\nhe said. And at the bare thought he was ready to flee away from her\nforever. Then he recalled her look and her words only a few hours ago,\nwhen he first told her he loved her; and his heart took courage. She\nhad said, \"I know you love me, Alessandro, and I am glad of it,\" and had\nlifted her eyes to his, with all the love that a woman's eyes can carry;\nand when he threw his arms around her, she had of her own accord come\ncloser, and laid one hand on his shoulder, and turned her face to his.\nAh, what else mattered! There was the whole world; if she loved him like\nthis, nothing could make them wretched; his love would be enough for\nher,--and for him hers was an empire.\n\nIt was indeed true, though neither the Senora nor Margarita would have\nbelieved it, that this had been the first word of love ever spoken\nbetween Alessandro and Ramona, the first caress ever given, the first\nmoment of unreserve. It had come about, as lovers' first words, first\ncaresses, are so apt to do, unexpectedly, with no more premonition, at\nthe instant, than there is of the instant of the opening of a flower.\nAlessandro had been speaking to Ramona of the conversation Felipe had\nheld with him in regard to remaining on the place, and asked her if she\nknew of the plan.\n\n\"Yes,\" she said; \"I heard the Senora talking about it with Felipe, some\ndays ago.\"\n\n\"Was she against my staying?\" asked Alessandro, quickly.\n\n\"I think not,\" said Ramona, \"but I am not sure. It is not easy to be\nsure what the Senora wishes, till afterward. It was Felipe that proposed\nit.\"\n\nThis somewhat enigmatical statement as to the difficulty of knowing the\nSenora's wishes was like Greek to Alessandro's mind.\n\n\"I do not understand, Senorita,\" he said. \"What do you mean by\n'afterward'?\"\n\n\"I mean,\" replied Ramona, \"that the Senora never says she wishes\nanything; she says she leaves everything to Felipe to decide, or to\nFather Salvierderra. But I think it is always decided as she wishes to\nhave it, after all. The Senora is wonderful, Alessandro; don't you think\nso?\"\n\n\"She loves Senor Felipe very much,\" was Alessandro's evasive reply.\n\n\"Oh, yes,\" exclaimed Ramona. \"You do not begin to know how much. She\ndoes not love any other human being. He takes it all. She hasn't any\nleft. If he had died, she would have died too. That is the reason she\nlikes you so much; she thinks you saved Felipe's life. I mean, that\nis one reason,\" added Ramona, smiling, and looking up confidingly at\nAlessandro, who smiled back, not in vanity, but honest gratitude that\nthe Senorita was pleased to intimate that he was not unworthy of the\nSenora's regard.\n\n\"I do not think she likes me,\" he said. \"I cannot tell why; but I do\nnot think she likes any one in the world. She is not like any one I ever\nsaw, Senorita.\"\n\n\"No,\" replied Ramona, thoughtfully. \"She is not. I am, oh, so afraid of\nher, Alessandro! I have always been, ever since I was a little girl. I\nused to think she hated me; but now I think she does not care one way or\nthe other, if I keep out of her way.\"\n\nWhile Ramona spoke these words, her eyes were fixed on the running\nwater at her feet. If she had looked up, and seen the expression in\nAlessandro's eyes as he listened, the thing which was drawing near would\nhave drawn near faster, would have arrived at that moment; but she did\nnot look up. She went on, little dreaming how hard she was making it for\nAlessandro.\n\n\"Many's the time I've come down here, at night, to this brook, and\nlooked at it, and wished it was a big river, so I could throw myself\nin, and be carried away out to the sea, dead. But it is a fearful sin,\nFather Salvierderra says, to take one's own life; and always the next\nmorning, when the sun came out, and the birds sang, I've been glad\nenough I had not done it. Were you ever so unhappy as that, Alessandro?\"\n\n\"No, Senorita, never,\" replied Alessandro; \"and it is thought a great\ndisgrace, among us, to kill one's self. I think I could never do it.\nBut, oh, Senorita, it is a grief to think of your being unhappy. Will\nyou always be so? Must you always stay here?\"\n\n\"Oh, but I am not always unhappy!\" said Ramona, with her sunny little\nlaugh. \"Indeed, I am generally very happy. Father Salvierderra says that\nif one does no sin, one will be always happy, and that it is a sin not\nto rejoice every hour of the day in the sun and the sky and the work\nthere is to do; and there is always plenty of that.\" Then, her face\nclouding, she continued: \"I suppose I shall always stay here. I have no\nother home; you know I was the Senora's sister's adopted child. She died\nwhen I was little, and the Senora kindly took me. Father Salvierderra\nsays I must never forget to be grateful to her for all she has done for\nme, and I try not to.\"\n\nAlessandro eyed her closely. The whole story, as Juan Can had told it to\nhim, of the girl's birth, was burning in his thoughts. How he longed to\ncry out, \"O my loved one, they have made you homeless in your home. They\ndespise you. The blood of my race is in your veins; come to me; come to\nme! be surrounded with love!\" But he dared not. How could he dare?\n\nSome strange spell seemed to have unloosed Ramona's tongue to-night.\nShe had never before spoken to Alessandro of her own personal history or\nburdens; but she went on: \"The worst thing is, Alessandro, that she will\nnot tell me who my mother was; and I do not know if she is alive or not,\nor anything about her. Once I asked the Senora, but she forbade me ever\nto ask her again. She said she herself would tell me when it was proper\nfor me to know. But she never has.\"\n\nHow the secret trembled on Alessandro's lips now. Ramona had never\nseemed so near, so intimate, so trusting. What would happen if he were\nto tell her the truth? Would the sudden knowledge draw her closer to\nhim, or repel her?\n\n\"Have you never asked her again?\" he said.\n\nRamona looked up astonished. \"No one ever disobeyed the Senora,\" she\nsaid quickly.\n\n\"I would!\" exclaimed Alessandro.\n\n\"You may think so,\" said Ramona, \"but you couldn't. When you tried, you\nwould find you couldn't. I did ask Father Salvierderra once.\"\n\n\"What did he say?\" asked Alessandro, breathless.\n\n\"The same thing. He said I must not ask; I was not old enough. When the\ntime came, I would be told,\" answered Ramona, sadly. \"I don't see what\nthey can mean by the time's coming. What do you suppose they meant?\"\n\n\"I do not know the ways of any people but my own, Senorita,\" replied\nAlessandro. \"Many things that your people do, and still more that these\nAmericans do, are to me so strange, I know nothing what they mean.\nPerhaps they do not know who was your mother?\"\n\n\"I am sure they do,\" answered Ramona, in a low tone, as if the words\nwere wrung from her. \"But let us talk about something else, Alessandro;\nnot about sad things, about pleasant things. Let us talk about your\nstaying here.\"\n\n\"Would it be truly a pleasure to the Senorita Ramona, if I stayed?\" said\nAlessandro.\n\n\"You know it would,\" answered Ramona, frankly, yet with a tremor in her\nvoice, which Alessandro felt. \"I do not see what we could any of us do\nwithout you. Felipe says he shall not let you go.\"\n\nAlessandro's face glowed. \"It must be as my father says, Senorita,\" he\nsaid. \"A messenger came from him yesterday, and I sent him back with a\nletter telling him what the Senor Felipe had proposed to me, and asking\nhim what I should do. My father is very old, Senorita, and I do not see\nhow he can well spare me. I am his only child, and my mother died years\nago. We live alone together in our house, and when I am away he is very\nlonely. But he would like to have me earn the wages, I know, and I hope\nhe will think it best for me to stay. There are many things we want to\ndo for the village; most of our people are poor, and can do little more\nthan get what they need to eat day by day, and my father wishes to see\nthem better off before he dies. Now that the Americans are coming in all\naround us, he is afraid and anxious all the time. He wants to get a big\nfence built around our land, so as to show where it is; but the people\ncannot take much time to work on the fence; they need all their time to\nwork for themselves and their families. Indians have a hard time to live\nnow, Senorita. Were you ever in Temecula?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Ramona. \"Is it a large town?\"\n\nAlessandro sighed. \"Dear Senorita, it is not a town; it is only a little\nvillage not more than twenty houses in all, and some of those are built\nonly of tule. There is a chapel, and a graveyard. We built an adobe wall\naround the graveyard last year. That my father said we would do, before\nwe built the fence round the village.\"\n\n\"How many people are there in the village?\" asked Ramona.\n\n\"Nearly two hundred, when they are all there; but many of them are away\nmost of the time. They must go where they can get work; they are\nhired by the farmers, or to do work on the great ditches, or to go as\nshepherds; and some of them take their wives and children with them. I\ndo not believe the Senorita has ever seen any very poor people.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, I have, Alessandro, at Santa Barbara. There were many poor\npeople there, and the Sisters used to give them food every week.\"\n\n\"Indians?\" said Alessandro.\n\nRamona colored. \"Yes,\" she said, \"some of them were, but not like your\nmen, Alessandro. They were very different; miserable looking; they could\nnot read nor write, and they seemed to have no ambition.\"\n\n\"That is the trouble,\" said Alessandro, \"with so many of them; it is\nwith my father's people, too. They say, 'What is the use?' My father\ngets in despair with them, because they will not learn better. He gives\nthem a great deal, but they do not seem to be any better off for it.\nThere is only one other man in our village who can read and write,\nbesides my father and me, Senorita; and yet my father is all the time\nbegging them to come to his house and learn of him. But they say they\nhave no time; and indeed there is much truth in that, Senorita. You see\neverybody has troubles, Senorita.\"\n\nRamona had been listening with sorrowful face. All this was new to her.\nUntil to-night, neither she nor Alessandro had spoken of private and\npersonal matters.\n\n\"Ah, but these are real troubles,\" she said. \"I do not think mine were\nreal troubles at all. I wish I could do something for your people,\nAlessandro. If the village were only near by, I could teach them, could\nI not? I could teach them to read. The Sisters always said, that to\nteach the ignorant and the poor was the noblest work one could do. I\nwish I could teach your people. Have you any relatives there\nbesides your father? Is there any one in the village that you--love,\nAlessandro?\"\n\nAlessandro was too much absorbed in thoughts of his people, to observe\nthe hesitating emphasis with which Ramona asked this question.\n\n\"Yes, Senorita, I love them all. They are like my brothers and sisters,\nall of my father's people,\" he said; \"and I am unhappy about them all\nthe time.\"\n\nDuring the whole of this conversation Ramona had had an undercurrent of\nthought going on, which was making her uneasy. The more Alessandro said\nabout his father and his people, the more she realized that he was held\nto Temecula by bonds that would be hard to break, the more she feared\nhis father would not let him remain away from home for any length of\ntime. At the thought of his going away, her very heart sickened. Taking\na sudden step towards him, she said abruptly, \"Alessandro, I am afraid\nyour father will not give his consent to your staying here.\"\n\n\"So am I, Senorita,\" he replied sadly.\n\n\"And you would not stay if he did not approve of it, of course,\" she\nsaid.\n\n\"How could I, Senorita?\"\n\n\"No,\" she said, \"it would not be right;\" but as she said these words,\nthe tears filled her eyes.\n\nAlessandro saw them. The world changed in that second. \"Senorita!\nSenorita Ramona!\" he cried, \"tears have come in your eyes! O Senorita,\nthen you will not be angry if I say that I love you!\" and Alessandro\ntrembled with the terror and delight of having said the words.\n\nHardly did he trust his palpitating senses to be telling him true the\nwords that followed, quick, firm, though only in a whisper,--\"I know\nthat you love me, Alessandro, and I am glad of it!\" Yes, this was\nwhat the Senorita Ramona was saying! And when he stammered, \"But you,\nSenorita, you do not--you could not--\" \"Yes, Alessandro, I do--I love\nyou!\" in the same clear, firm whisper; and the next minute Alessandro's\narms were around Ramona, and he had kissed her, sobbing rather than\nsaying, \"O Senorita, do you mean that you will go with me? that you\nare mine? Oh, no, beloved Senorita, you cannot mean that!\" But he was\nkissing her. He knew she did mean it; and Ramona, whispering, \"Yes,\nAlessandro, I do mean it; I will go with you,\" clung to him with her\nhands, and kissed him, and repeated it, \"I will go with you, I love\nyou.\" And then, just then, came the Senora's step, and her sharp cry\nof amazement, and there she stood, no more than an arm's-length away,\nlooking at them with her indignant, terrible eyes.\n\nWhat an hour this for Alessandro to be living over and over, as he\ncrouched in the darkness, watching! But the bewilderment of his emotions\ndid not dull his senses. As if stalking deer in a forest, he listened\nfor sounds from the house. It seemed strangely still. As the darkness\ndeepened, it seemed still stranger that no lamps were lit. Darkness in\nthe Senora's room, in the Senorita's; a faint light in the dining-room,\nsoon put out,--evidently no supper going on there. Only from under\nFelipe's door streamed a faint radiance; and creeping close to the\nveranda, Alessandro heard voices fitfully talking,--the Senora's and\nFelipe's; no word from Ramona. Piteously he fixed his eyes on her\nwindow; it was open, but the curtains tight drawn; no stir, no sound.\nWhere was she? What had been done to his love? Only the tireless caution\nand infinite patience of his Indian blood kept Alessandro from going\nto her window. But he would imperil nothing by acting on his own\nresponsibility. He would wait, if it were till daylight, till his\nlove made a sign. Certainly before long Senor Felipe would come to his\nveranda bed, and then he could venture to speak to him. But it was near\nmidnight when the door of Felipe's room opened, and he and his mother\ncame out, still speaking in low tones. Felipe lay down on his couch; his\nmother, bending over, kissed him, bade him good-night, and went into her\nown room.\n\nIt had been some time now since Alessandro had left off sleeping on the\nveranda floor by Felipe's side. Felipe was so well it was not needful.\nBut Felipe felt sure he would come to-night, and was not surprised\nwhen, a few minutes after the Senora's door closed, he heard a low voice\nthrough the vines, \"Senor Felipe?\"\n\n\"Hush, Alessandro,\" whispered Felipe. \"Do not make a sound. To-morrow\nmorning early I will see you, behind the little sheepfold. It is not\nsafe to talk here.\"\n\n\"Where is the Senorita?\" Alessandro breathed rather than said.\n\n\"In her room,\" answered Felipe.\n\n\"Well?\" said Alessandro.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Felipe, hoping he was not lying; and this was all Alessandro\nhad to comfort himself with, through his long night of watching. No, not\nall; one other thing comforted him,--the notes of two wood-doves, that\nat intervals he heard, cooing to each other; just the two notes, the\ncall and the answer, \"Love?\" \"Here.\" \"Love?\" \"Here,\"--and long intervals\nof silence between. Plain as if written on a page was the thing they\ntold.\n\n\"That is what my Ramona is like,\" thought he, \"the gentle wood-dove. If\nshe is my wife my people will call her Majel, the Wood-Dove.\"\n\n\n\n\nXI\n\nWHEN the Senora bade Felipe good-night, she did not go to bed. After\nclosing her door, she sat down to think what should be done about\nRamona. It had been a hard task she had set herself, talking all the\nevening with Felipe without alluding to the topic uppermost in her mind.\nBut Felipe was still nervous and irritable. She would not spoil his\nnight's rest, she thought, by talking of disagreeable things. Moreover,\nshe was not clear in her own mind what she wished to have done about\nAlessandro. If Ramona were to be sent away to the nuns, which was the\nonly thing the Senora could think of as yet, there would be no reason\nfor discharging Alessandro. And with him the Senora was by no means\nready to part, though in her first anger she had been ready to dismiss\nhim on the spot. As she pursued her reflections, the whole situation\ncleared itself in her mind; so easily do affairs fall into line, in the\nplottings and plannings of an arbitrary person, who makes in his formula\nno allowance for a human element which he cannot control.\n\nRamona should be sent in disgrace to the Sisters' School, to be a\nservant there for the rest of her life. The Senora would wash her hands\nof her forever. Even Father Salvierderra himself could not expect\nher any longer to keep such a shameless creature under her roof. Her\nsister's written instructions had provided for the possibility of just\nsuch a contingency. Going to a secret closet in the wall, behind a\nlife-size statue of Saint Catharine, the Senora took out an iron box,\nbattered and rusty with age, and set it on the bed. The key turned with\ndifficulty in the lock. It was many years since the Senora had opened\nthis box. No one but herself knew of its existence. There had been many\ntimes in the history of the Moreno house when the price of the contents\nof that box would have averted loss and misfortune; but the Senora no\nmore thought of touching the treasure than if it had been guarded by\nangels with fiery swords. There they lay, brilliant and shining even in\nthe dim light of the one candle,--rubies, emeralds, pearls, and yellow\ndiamonds. The Senora's lip curled as she looked at them. \"Fine dowry,\ntruly, for a creature like this!\" she said. \"Well I knew in the\nbeginning no good would come of it; base begotten, base born, she has\nbut carried out the instincts of her nature. I suppose I may be grateful\nthat my own son was too pure to be her prey!\" \"To be given to my adopted\ndaughter, Ramona Ortegna, on her wedding day,\"--so the instructions\nran,--\"if she weds worthily and with your approval. Should such a\nmisfortune occur, which I do not anticipate, as that she should prove\nunworthy, then these jewels, and all I have left to her of value, shall\nbe the property of the Church.\"\n\n\"No mention as to what I am to do with the girl herself if she proves\nunworthy,\" thought the Senora, bitterly; \"but the Church is the place\nfor her; no other keeping will save her from the lowest depths of\ndisgrace. I recollect my sister said that Angus had at first intended to\ngive the infant to the Church. Would to God he had done so, or left it\nwith its Indian mother!\" and the Senora rose, and paced the floor. The\npaper of her dead sister's handwriting fell at her feet. As she walked,\nher long skirt swept it rustling to and fro. She stooped, picked it up,\nread it again, with increasing bitterness. No softness at the memory of\nher sister's love for the little child; no relenting. \"Unworthy!\" Yes,\nthat was a mild word to apply to Ramona, now. It was all settled;\nand when the girl was once out of the house, the Senora would breathe\neasier. She and Felipe would lead their lives together, and Felipe would\nwed some day. Was there a woman fair enough, good enough, for Felipe to\nwed? But he must wed; and the place would be gay with children's voices,\nand Ramona would be forgotten.\n\nThe Senora did not know how late it was. \"I will tell her to-night,\" she\nsaid. \"I will lose no time; and now she shall hear who her mother was!\"\n\nIt was a strange freak of just impulse in the Senora's angry soul, which\nmade her suddenly remember that Ramona had had no supper, and led her\nto go to the kitchen, get a jug of milk and some bread, and take them\nto the room. Turning the key cautiously, that Felipe might not hear, she\nopened the door and glided in. No voice greeted her; she held her candle\nhigh up; no Ramona in sight; the bed was empty. She glanced at the\nwindow. It was open. A terror seized the Senora; fresh anger also. \"She\nhas run off with Alessandro,\" she thought, \"What horrible disgrace.\"\nStanding motionless, she heard a faint, regular breathing from the other\nside of the bed. Hastily crossing the room, she saw a sight which had\nmelted a heart that was only ice; but the Senora's was stone toward\nRamona. There lay Ramona on the floor, her head on a pillow at the feet\nof the big Madonna which stood in the corner. Her left hand was under\nher cheek, her right arm flung tight around the base of the statue. She\nwas sound asleep. Her face was wet with tears. Her whole attitude was\nfull of significance. Even helpless in sleep, she was one who had taken\nrefuge in sanctuary. This thought had been distinct in the girl's mind\nwhen she found herself, spite of all her woe and terror, growing sleepy.\n\"She won't dare to hurt me at the Virgin's feet,\" she had said; \"and\nthe window is open. Felipe would hear if I called; and Alessandro will\nwatch.\" And with a prayer on her lips she fell asleep.\n\nIt was Felipe's nearness more than the Madonna's, which saved her from\nbeing roused to hear her doom. The Senora stood for some moments\nlooking at her, and at the open window. With a hot rush of disgraceful\nsuspicions, she noted what she had never before thought of, that\nAlessandro, through all his watching with Felipe, had had close access\nto Ramona's window. \"Shameful creature!\" she repeated to herself. \"And\nshe can sleep! It is well she prayed, if the Virgin will hear such!\" and\nshe turned away, first setting down the jug of milk and the bread on a\ntable. Then, with a sudden and still more curious mingling of justness\nin her wrath, she returned, and lifting the coverlet from the bed,\nspread it over Ramona, covering her carefully from head to foot. Then\nshe went out and again locked the door.\n\nFelipe, from his bed, heard and divined all, but made no sound. \"Thank\nGod, the poor child is asleep!\" he said; \"and my poor dear mother feared\nto awake me by speaking to her! What will become of us all to-morrow!\"\nAnd Felipe tossed and turned, and had barely fallen into an uneasy\nsleep, when his mother's window opened, and she sang the first line of\nthe sunrise hymn. Instantly Ramona joined, evidently awake and ready;\nand no sooner did the watching Alessandro hear the first note of her\nvoice, than he struck in; and Margarita, who had been up for an hour,\nprowling, listening, peering, wondering, her soul racked between her\njealousy and her fears,--even Margarita delayed not to unite; and\nFelipe, too, sang feebly; and the volume of the song went up as rounded\nand melodious as if all hearts were at peace and in harmony, instead of\nbeing all full of sorrow, confusion, or hatred. But there was no one of\nthem all who was not the better for the singing; Ramona and Alessandro\nmost of all.\n\n\"The saints be praised,\" said Alessandro. \"There is my wood-dove's\nvoice. She can sing!\" And, \"Alessandro was near. He watched all night. I\nam glad he loves me,\" said Ramona.\n\n\"To hear those two voices.\" said the Senora; \"would one suppose they\ncould sing like that? Perhaps it is not so bad as I think.\"\n\nAs soon as the song was done, Alessandro ran to the sheepfold, where\nFelipe had said he would see him. The minutes would be like years to\nAlessandro till he had seen Felipe.\n\nRamona, when she waked and found herself carefully covered, and bread\nand milk standing on the table, felt much reassured. Only the Senora's\nown hand had done this, she felt sure, for she had heard her the\nprevious evening turn the key in the lock, then violently take it out;\nand Ramona knew well that the fact of her being thus a prisoner would be\nknown to none but the Senora herself. The Senora would not set servants\nto gossiping. She ate her bread and milk thankfully, for she was very\nhungry. Then she set her room in order, said her prayers, and sat down\nto wait. For what? She could not imagine; in truth, she did not much\ntry. Ramona had passed now into a country where the Senora did not rule.\nShe felt little fear. Felipe would not see her harmed, and she was going\naway presently with Alessandro. It was wonderful what peace and freedom\nlay in the very thought. The radiance on her face of these two new-born\nemotions was the first thing the Senora observed as she opened the door,\nand slowly, very slowly, eyeing Ramona with a steady look, entered the\nroom. This joyous composure on Ramona's face angered the Senora, as it\nhad done before, when she was dragging her up the garden-walk. It seemed\nto her like nothing less than brazen effrontery, and it changed the\nwhole tone and manner of her address.\n\nSeating herself opposite Ramona, but at the farthest side of the room,\nshe said, in a tone scornful and insulting, \"What have you to say for\nyourself?\"\n\nReturning the Senora's gaze with one no less steady, Ramona spoke in the\nsame calm tone in which she had twice the evening before attempted to\nstay the Senora's wrath. This time, she was not interrupted.\n\n\"Senora,\" she said slowly, \"I tried to tell you last night, but you\nwould not hear me. If you had listened, you would not have been so\nangry. Neither Alessandro nor I have done anything wrong, and we were\nnot ashamed. We love each other, and we are going to be married, and go\naway. I thank you, Senora, for all you have done for me; I am sure\nyou will be a great deal happier when I am away;\" and Ramona looked\nwistfully, with no shade of resentment, into the Senora's dark, shrunken\nface. \"You have been very good to do so much for a girl you did not\nlove. Thank you for the bread and milk last night. Perhaps I can go away\nwith Alessandro to-day. I do not know what he will wish. We had only\njust that minute spoken of being married, when you found us last night.\"\n\nThe Senora's face was a study during the few moments that it took to say\nthese words. She was dumb with amazement. Instantaneously, on the\nfirst sense of relief that the disgrace had not been what she supposed,\nfollowed a new wrath, if possible hotter than the first; not so much\nscorn, but a bitterer anger. \"Marry! Marry that Indian!\" she cried, as\nsoon as she found voice. \"You marry an Indian? Never! Are you mad? I\nwill never permit it.\"\n\nRamona looked anxiously at her. \"I have never disobeyed you, Senora,\"\nshe said, \"but this is different from all other things; you are not my\nmother. I have promised to marry Alessandro.\"\n\nThe girl's gentleness deceived the Senora.\n\n\"No,\" she said icily, \"I am not your mother; but I stand in a mother's\nplace to you. You were my sister's adopted child, and she gave you to\nme. You cannot marry without my permission, and I forbid you ever to\nspeak again of marrying this Indian.\"\n\nThe moment had come for the Senora Moreno to find out, to her surprise\nand cost, of what stuff this girl was made,--this girl, who had\nfor fourteen years lived by her side, docile, gentle, sunny, and\nuncomplaining in her loneliness. Springing to her feet, and walking\nswiftly till she stood close face to face with the Senora, who, herself\nstartled by the girl's swift motion, had also risen to her feet, Ramona\nsaid, in a louder, firmer voice: \"Senora Moreno, you may forbid me\nas much as you please. The whole world cannot keep me from marrying\nAlessandro. I love him. I have promised, and I shall keep my word.\" And\nwith her young lithe arms straight down at her sides, her head thrown\nback, Ramona flashed full in the Senora's face a look of proud defiance.\nIt was the first free moment her soul had ever known. She felt herself\nbuoyed up as by wings in air. Her old terror of the Senora fell from her\nlike a garment thrown off.\n\n\"Pshaw!\" said the Senora, contemptuously, half amused, in spite of her\nwrath, by the girl's, as she thought, bootless vehemence, \"you talk like\na fool. Do you not know that I can shut you up in the nunnery to-morrow,\nif I choose?\"\n\n\"No, you cannot!\" replied Ramona.\n\n\"Who, then, is to hinder me.\" said the Senora, insolently.\n\n\"Alessandro!\" answered Ramona, proudly.\n\n\"Alessandro!\" the Senora sneered. \"Alessandro! Ha! a beggarly Indian, on\nwhom my servants will set the dogs, if I bid them! Ha, ha!\"\n\nThe Senora's sneering tone but roused Ramona more. \"You would never\ndare!\" she cried; \"Felipe would not permit it!\" A most unwise retort for\nRamona.\n\n\"Felipe!\" cried the Senora, in a shrill voice. \"How dare you pronounce\nhis name! He will none of you, from this hour! I forbid him to speak to\nyou. Indeed, he will never desire to set eyes on you when he hears the\ntruth.\"\n\n\"You are mistaken, Senora,\" answered Ramona, more gently. \"Felipe is\nAlessandro's friend, and--mine,\" she added, after a second's pause.\n\n\"So, ho! the Senorita thinks she is all-powerful in the house of\nMoreno!\" cried the Senora. \"We will see! we will see! Follow me,\nSenorita Ramona!\" And throwing open the door, the Senora strode out,\nlooking back over her shoulder.\n\n\"Follow me!\" she cried again sharply, seeing that Ramona hesitated; and\nRamona went; across the passage-way leading to the dining-room, out into\nthe veranda, down the entire length of it, to the Senora's room,--the\nSenora walking with a quick, agitated step, strangely unlike her usual\ngait; Ramona walking far slower than was her habit, and with her eyes\nbent on the ground. As they passed the dining-room door, Margarita,\nstanding just inside, shot at Ramona a vengeful, malignant glance.\n\n\"She would help the Senora against me in anything,\" thought Ramona; and\nshe felt a thrill of fear, such as the Senora with all her threats had\nnot stirred.\n\nThe Senora's windows were open. She closed them both, and drew the\ncurtains tight. Then she locked the door, Ramona watching her every\nmovement.\n\n\"Sit down in that chair,\" said the Senora, pointing to one near the\nfireplace. A sudden nervous terror seized Ramona.\n\n\"I would rather stand, Senora,\" she said.\n\n\"Do as I bid you.\" said the Senora, in a husky tone; and Ramona obeyed.\nIt was a low, broad armchair, and as she sank back into it, her senses\nseemed leaving her. She leaned her head against the back and closed\nher eyes. The room swam. She was roused by the Senora's strong\nsmelling-salts held for her to breathe, and a mocking taunt from the\nSenora's iciest voice: \"The Senorita does not seem so over-strong as she\ndid a few moments back!\"\n\nRamona tried to reason with herself; surely no ill could happen to her,\nin this room, within call of the whole house. But an inexplicable terror\nhad got possession of her; and when the Senora, with a sneer on her\nface, took hold of the Saint Catharine statue, and wheeling it half\naround, brought into view a door in the wall, with a big iron key in the\nkeyhole, which she proceeded to turn, Ramona shook with fright. She had\nread of persons who had been shut up alive in cells in the wall, and\nstarved to death. With dilating eyes she watched the Senora, who, all\nunaware of her terror, was prolonging it and intensifying it by her\nevery act. First she took out the small iron box, and set it on a table.\nThen, kneeling, she drew out from an inner recess in the closet a large\nleather-covered box, and pulled it, grating and scraping along the\nfloor, till it stood in front of Ramona. All this time she spoke no\nword, and the cruel expression of her countenance deepened each moment.\nThe fiends had possession of the Senora Moreno this morning, and no\nmistake. A braver heart than Ramona's might have indeed been fearful, at\nbeing locked up alone with a woman who looked like that.\n\nFinally, she locked the door and wheeled the statue back into its place.\nRamona breathed freer. She was not, after all, to be thrust into\nthe wall closet and left to starve. She gazed with wonder at the old\nbattered boxes. What could it all mean?\n\n\"Senorita Ramona Ortegna,\" began the Senora, drawing up a chair, and\nseating herself by the table on which stood the iron box, \"I will now\nexplain to you why you will not marry the Indian Alessandro.\"\n\nAt these words, this name, Ramona was herself again,--not her old self,\nher new self, Alessandro's promised wife. The very sound of his name,\neven on an enemy's tongue, gave her strength. The terrors fled away.\nShe looked up, first at the Senora, then at the nearest window. She was\nyoung and strong; at one bound, if worst came to worst, she could leap\nthrough the window, and fly for her life, calling on Alessandro.\n\n\"I shall marry the Indian Alessandro, Senora Moreno,\" she said, in a\ntone as defiant, and now almost as insolent, as the Senora's own.\n\nThe Senora paid no heed to the words, except to say, \"Do not interrupt\nme again. I have much to tell you;\" and opening the box, she lifted out\nand placed on the table tray after tray of jewels. The sheet of written\npaper lay at the bottom of the box.\n\n\"Do you see this paper, Senorita Ramona?\" she asked, holding it up.\nRamona bowed her head. \"This was written by my sister, the Senora\nOrtegna, who adopted you and gave you her name. These were her final\ninstructions to me, in regard to the disposition to be made of the\nproperty she left to you.\"\n\nRamona's lips parted. She leaned forward, breathless, listening, while\nthe Senora read sentence after sentence. All the pent-up pain, wonder,\nfear of her childhood and her girlhood, as to the mystery of her birth,\nswept over her anew, now. Like one hearkening for life or death, she\nlistened. She forgot Alessandro. She did not look at the jewels. Her\neyes never left the Senora's face. At the close of the reading, the\nSenora said sternly, \"You see, now, that my sister left to me the entire\ndisposition of everything belonging to you.\"\n\n\"But it hasn't said who was my mother,\" cried Ramona. \"Is that all there\nis in the paper?\"\n\nThe Senora looked stupefied. Was the girl feigning? Did she care nothing\nthat all these jewels, almost a little fortune, were to be lost to her\nforever?\n\n\"Who was your mother?\" she exclaimed, scornfully, \"There was no need to\nwrite that down. Your mother was an Indian. Everybody knew that!\"\n\nAt the word \"Indian,\" Ramona gave a low cry.\n\nThe Senora misunderstood it. \"Ay,\" she said, \"a low, common Indian. I\ntold my sister, when she took you, the Indian blood in your veins would\nshow some day; and now it has come true.\"\n\nRamona's cheeks were scarlet. Her eyes flashed. \"Yes, Senora Moreno,\"\nshe said, springing to her feet; \"the Indian blood in my veins shows\nto-day. I understand many things I never understood before. Was it\nbecause I was an Indian that you have always hated me?\"\n\n\"You are not an Indian, and I have never hated you,\" interrupted the\nSenora.\n\nRamona heeded her not, but went on, more and more impetuously. \"And if\nI am an Indian, why do you object to my marrying Alessandro? Oh, I am\nglad I am an Indian! I am of his people. He will be glad!\" The words\npoured like a torrent out of her lips. In her excitement she came closer\nand closer to the Senora. \"You are a cruel woman,\" she said. \"I did not\nknow it before; but now I do. If you knew I was an Indian, you had no\nreason to treat me so shamefully as you did last night, when you saw me\nwith Alessandro. You have always hated me. Is my mother alive'? Where\ndoes she live? Tell me; and I will go to her to-day. Tell me! She will\nbe glad that Alessandro loves me!\"\n\nIt was a cruel look, indeed, and a crueller tone, with which the Senora\nanswered: \"I have not the least idea who your mother was, or if she is\nstill alive, Nobody ever knew anything about her,--some low, vicious\ncreature, that your father married when he was out of his senses, as you\nare now, when you talk of marrying Alessandro!\"\n\n\"He married her, then?\" asked Ramona, with emphasis. \"How know you that,\nSenora Moreno?\"\n\n\"He told my sister so,\" replied the Senora, reluctantly. She grudged the\ngirl even this much of consolation.\n\n\"What was his name?\" asked Ramona.\n\n\"Phail; Angus Phail,\" the Senora replied almost mechanically. She found\nherself strangely constrained by Ramona's imperious earnestness, and she\nchafed under it. The tables were being turned on her, she hardly knew\nhow. Ramona seemed to tower in stature, and to have the bearing of\nthe one in authority, as she stood before her pouring out passionate\nquestion after question. The Senora turned to the larger box, and opened\nit. With unsteady hands she lifted out the garments which for so many\nyears had rarely seen the light. Shawls and ribosos of damask, laces,\ngowns of satin, of velvet. As the Senora flung one after another on the\nchairs, it was a glittering pile of shining, costly stuffs. Ramona's\neyes rested on them dreamily.\n\n\"Did my adopted mother wear all these?\" she asked, lifting in her hand a\nfold of lace, and holding it up to the light, in evident admiration.\n\nAgain the Senora misconceived her. The girl seemed not insensible to the\nvalue and beauty of this costly raiment. Perhaps she would be lured by\nit.\n\n\"All these are yours, Ramona, you understand, on your wedding day, if\nyou marry worthily, with my permission,\" said the Senora, in a voice\na shade less cold than had hitherto come from her lips. \"Did you\nunderstand what I read you?\"\n\nThe girl did not answer. She had taken up in her hand a ragged, crimson\nsilk handkerchief, which, tied in many knots, lay in one corner of the\njewel-box.\n\n\"There are pearls in that,\" said the Senora; \"that came with the things\nyour father sent to my sister when he died.\"\n\nRamona's eyes gleamed. She began untying the knots. The handkerchief was\nold, the knots tied tight, and undisturbed for years. As she reached the\nlast knot, and felt the hard stones, she paused. \"This was my father's,\nthen.\" she said.\n\n\"Yes,\" said the Senora, scornfully. She thought she had detected a new\nbaseness in the girl. She was going to set up a claim to all which had\nbeen her father's property. \"They were your father's, and all these\nrubies, and these yellow diamonds;\" and she pushed the tray towards her.\n\nRamona had untied the last knot. Holding the handkerchief carefully\nabove the tray, she shook the pearls out. A strange, spicy fragrance\ncame from the silk. The pearls fell in among the rubies, rolling right\nand left, making the rubies look still redder by contrast with their\nsnowy whiteness.\n\n\"I will keep this handkerchief,\" she said, thrusting it as she spoke,\nby a swift resolute movement into her bosom. \"I am very glad to have one\nthing that belonged to my father. The jewels, Senora, you can give to\nthe Church, if Father Salvierderra thinks that is right. I shall marry\nAlessandro;\" and still keeping one hand in her bosom where she had\nthrust the handkerchief, she walked away and seated herself again in her\nchair.\n\nFather Salvierderra! The name smote the Senora like a spear-thrust,\nThere could be no stronger evidence of the abnormal excitement under\nwhich she had been laboring for the last twenty-four hours, than the\nfact that she had not once, during all this time, thought to ask herself\nwhat Father Salvierderra would say, or might command, in this crisis.\nHer religion and the long habit of its outward bonds had alike gone from\nher in her sudden wrath against Ramona. It was with a real terror that\nshe became conscious of this.\n\n\"Father Salvierderra?\" she stammered; \"he has nothing to do with it.\"\n\nBut Ramona saw the change in the Senora's face, at the word, and\nfollowed up her advantage. \"Father Salvierderra has to do with\neverything,\" she said boldly. \"He knows Alessandro, He will not forbid\nme to marry him, and if he did--\" Ramona stopped. She also was smitten\nwith a sudden terror at the vista opening before her,--of a disobedience\nto Father Salvierderra.\n\n\"And if he did,\" repeated the Senora, eyeing Ramona keenly, \"would you\ndisobey him?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Ramona.\n\n\"I will tell Father Salvierderra what you say,\" retorted the Senora,\nsarcastically, \"that he may spare himself the humiliation of laying any\ncommands on you, to be thus disobeyed.\"\n\nRamona's lip quivered, and her eyes filled with the tears which no other\nof the Senora's taunts had been strong enough to bring. Dearly she\nloved the old monk; had loved him since her earliest recollection. His\ndispleasure would be far more dreadful to her than the Senora's. His\nwould give her grief; the Senora's, at utmost, only terror.\n\nClasping her hands, she said, \"Oh, Senora, have mercy! Do not say that\nto the Father!\"\n\n\"It is my duty to tell the Father everything that happens in my family,\"\nanswered the Senora, chillingly. \"He will agree with me, that if you\npersist in this disobedience you will deserve the severest punishment. I\nshall tell him all;\" and she began putting the trays back in the box.\n\n\"You will not tell him as it really is, Senora,\" persisted Ramona. \"I\nwill tell him myself.\"\n\n\"You shall not see him! I will take care of that!\" cried the Senora, so\nvindictively that Ramona shuddered.\n\n\"I will give you one more chance,\" said the Senora, pausing in the\nact of folding up one of the damask gowns. \"Will you obey me? Will you\npromise to have nothing more to do with this Indian?\"\n\n\"Never, Senora,\" replied Ramona; \"never!\"\n\n\"Then the consequences be on your own head,\" cried the Senora. \"Go to\nyour room! And, hark! I forbid you to speak of all this to Senor Felipe.\nDo you hear?\"\n\nRamona bowed her head. \"I hear,\" she said; and gliding out of the room,\nclosed the door behind her, and instead of going to her room, sped like\na hunted creature down the veranda steps, across the garden, calling in\na low tone, \"Felipe! Felipe! Where are you, Felipe?\"\n\n\n\n\nXII\n\nTHE little sheepfold, or corral, was beyond the artichoke-patch, on that\nsouthern slope whose sunshine had proved so disastrous a temptation to\nMargarita in the matter of drying the altar-cloth. It was almost like a\nterrace, this long slope; and the sheepfold, being near the bottom,\nwas wholly out of sight of the house. This was the reason Felipe had\nselected it as the safest spot for his talk with Alessandro.\n\nWhen Ramona reached the end of the trellised walk in the garden, she\nhalted and looked to the right and left. No one was in sight. As she\nentered the Senora's room an hour before, she had caught a glimpse of\nsome one, she felt almost positive it was Felipe, turning off in the\npath to the left, leading down to the sheepfold. She stood irresolute\nfor a moment, gazing earnestly down this path. \"If the saints would only\ntell me where he is!\" she said aloud. She trembled as she stood there,\nfearing each second to hear the Senora's voice calling her. But fortune\nwas favoring Ramona, for once; even as the words passed her lips, she\nsaw Felipe coming slowly up the bank. She flew to meet him. \"Oh, Felipe,\nFelipe!\" she began.\n\n\"Yes, dear, I know it all,\" interrupted Felipe; \"Alessandro has told\nme.\"\n\n\"She forbade me to speak to you, Felipe,\" said Ramona, \"but I could not\nbear it. What are we to do? Where is Alessandro?\"\n\n\"My mother forbade you to speak to me!\" cried Felipe, in a tone of\nterror. \"Oh, Ramona, why did you disobey her? If she sees us talking,\nshe will be even more displeased. Fly back to your room. Leave it all to\nme. I will do all that I can.\"\n\n\"But, Felipe,\" began Ramona, wringing her hands in distress.\n\n\"I know! I know!\" said Felipe; \"but you must not make my mother any more\nangry. I don't know what she will do till I talk with her. Do go back to\nyour room! Did she not tell you to stay there?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" sobbed Ramona, \"but I cannot. Oh, Felipe, I am so afraid! Do help\nus! Do you think you can? You won't let her shut me up in the convent,\nwill you, Felipe? Where is Alessandro? Why can't I go away with him this\nminute? Where is he? Dear Felipe, let me go now.\"\n\nFelipe's face was horror-stricken. \"Shut you in the convent!\" he gasped.\n\"Did she say that? Ramona, dear, fly back to your room. Let me talk\nto her. Fly, I implore you. I can't do anything for you if she sees me\ntalking with you now;\" and he turned away, and walked swiftly down the\nterrace.\n\nRamona felt as if she were indeed alone in the world. How could she\ngo back into that house! Slowly she walked up the garden-path again,\nmeditating a hundred wild plans of escape. Where, where was Alessandro?\nWhy did he not appear for her rescue? Her heart failed her; and when\nshe entered her room, she sank on the floor in a paroxysm of hopeless\nweeping. If she had known that Alessandro was already a good half-hour's\njourney on his way to Temecula, galloping farther and farther away from\nher each moment, she would have despaired indeed.\n\nThis was what Felipe, after hearing the whole story, had counselled him\nto do. Alessandro had given him so vivid a description of the Senora's\nface and tone, when she had ordered him out of her sight, that Felipe\nwas alarmed. He had never seen his mother angry like that. He could not\nconceive why her wrath should have been so severe. The longer he talked\nwith Alessandro, the more he felt that it would be wiser for him to be\nout of sight till the first force of her anger had been spent. \"I will\nsay that I sent you,\" said Felipe, \"so she cannot feel that you have\ncommitted any offence in going. Come back in four days, and by that time\nit will be all settled what you shall do.\"\n\nIt went hard with Alessandro to go without seeing Ramona; but it did not\nneed Felipe's exclamation of surprise, to convince him that it would be\nfoolhardy to attempt it. His own judgment had told him that it would be\nout of the question.\n\n\"But you will tell her all, Senor Felipe? You will tell her that it is\nfor her sake I go?\" the poor fellow said piteously, gazing into Felipe's\neyes as if he would read his inmost soul.\n\n\"I will, indeed, Alessandro; I will,\" replied Felipe; and he held his\nhand out to Alessandro, as to a friend and equal. \"You may trust me to\ndo all I can do for Ramona and for you.\"\n\n\"God bless you, Senor Felipe,\" answered Alessandro, gravely, a slight\ntrembling of his voice alone showing how deeply he was moved.\n\n\"He's a noble fellow,\" said Felipe to himself, as he watched Alessandro\nleap on his horse, which had been tethered near the corral all\nnight,--\"a noble fellow! There isn't a man among all my friends who\nwould have been manlier or franker than he has been in this whole\nbusiness. I don't in the least wonder that Ramona loves him. He's a\nnoble fellow! But what is to be done! What is to be done!\"\n\nFelipe was sorely perplexed. No sharp crisis of disagreement had ever\narisen between him and his mother, but he felt that one was coming\nnow. He was unaware of the extent of his influence over her. He doubted\nwhether he could move her very far. The threat of shutting Ramona up in\nthe convent terrified him more than he liked to admit to himself. Had\nshe power to do that? Felipe did not know. She must believe that she\nhad, or she would not have made the threat. Felipe's whole soul revolted\nat the cruel injustice of the idea.\n\n\"As if it were a sin for the poor girl to love Alessandro!\" he said.\n\"I'd help her to run away with him, if worse comes to worst. What can\nmake my mother feel so!\" And Felipe paced back and forth till the sun\nwas high, and the sharp glare and heat reminded him that he must seek\nshelter; then he threw himself down under the willows. He dreaded to\ngo into the house. His instinctive shrinking from the disagreeable, his\ndisposition to put off till another time, held him back, hour by hour.\nThe longer he thought the situation over, the less he knew how to broach\nthe subject to his mother; the more uncertain he felt whether it would\nbe wise for him to broach it at all. Suddenly he heard his name called.\nIt was Margarita, who had been sent to call him to dinner. \"Good\nheavens! dinner already!\" he cried, springing to his feet.\n\n\"Yes, Senor,\" replied Margarita, eyeing him observantly. She had seen\nhim talking with Alessandro, had seen Alessandro galloping away down\nthe river road. She had also gathered much from the Senora's look,\nand Ramona's, as they passed the dining-room door together soon after\nbreakfast. Margarita could have given a tolerably connected account of\nall that had happened within the last twenty-four hours to the chief\nactors in this tragedy which had so suddenly begun in the Moreno\nhousehold. Not supposed to know anything, she yet knew nearly all; and\nher every pulse was beating high with excited conjecture and wonder as\nto what would come next.\n\nDinner was a silent and constrained meal,--Ramona absent, the fiction of\nher illness still kept up; Felipe embarrassed, and unlike himself; the\nSenora silent, full of angry perplexity. At her first glance in Felipe's\nface, she thought to herself, \"Ramona has spoken to him. When and how\ndid she do it?\" For it had been only a few moments after Ramona had left\nher presence, that she herself had followed, and, seeing the girl in her\nown room, had locked the door as before, and had spent the rest of the\nmorning on the veranda within hands' reach of Ramona's window. How,\nwhen, and where had she contrived to communicate with Felipe? The longer\nthe Senora studied over this, the angrier and more baffled she felt; to\nbe outwitted was even worse to her than to be disobeyed. Under her very\neyes, as it were, something evidently had happened, not only against\nher will, but which she could not explain. Her anger even rippled out\ntowards Felipe, and was fed by the recollection of Ramona's unwise\nretort, \"Felipe would not let you!\" What had Felipe done or said to make\nthe girl so sure that he would be on her side and Alessandro's? Was it\ncome to this, that she, the Senora Moreno, was to be defied in her own\nhouse by children and servants!\n\nIt was with a tone of severe displeasure that she said to Felipe, as\nshe rose from the dinner-table, \"My son, I would like to have some\nconversation with you in my room, if you are at leisure.\"\n\n\"Certainly, mother,\" said Felipe, a load rolling off his mind at her\nhaving thus taken the initiative, for which he lacked courage; and\nwalking swiftly towards her, he attempted to put his arm around her\nwaist, as it was his affectionate habit frequently to do. She repulsed\nhim gently, but bethinking herself, passed her hand through his arm,\nand leaning on it heavily as she walked, said: \"This is the most fitting\nway, my son. I must lean more and more heavily on you each year now. Age\nis telling on me fast. Do you not find me greatly changed, Felipe, in\nthe last year?\"\n\n\"No, madre mia,\" replied Felipe, \"indeed I do not. I see not that you\nhave changed in the last ten years.\" And he was honest in this. His\neyes did not note the changes so clear to others, and for the best of\nreasons. The face he saw was one no one else ever beheld; it was kindled\nby emotion, transfigured by love, whenever it was turned towards him.\n\nThe Senora sighed deeply as she answered: \"That must be because you so\nlove me, Felipe. I myself see the changes even day by day. Troubles\ntell on me as they did not when I was younger. Even within the last\ntwenty-four hours I seem to myself to have aged frightfully;\" and she\nlooked keenly at Felipe as she seated herself in the arm-chair where\npoor Ramona had swooned a few hours before. Felipe remained standing\nbefore her, gazing, with a tender expression, upon her features, but\nsaying nothing.\n\n\"I see that Ramona has told you all!\" she continued, her voice hardening\nas she spoke. What a fortunate wording of her sentence!\n\n\"No, mother; it was not Ramona, it was Alessandro, who told me this\nmorning, early,\" Felipe answered hastily, hurrying on, to draw the\nconversation as far away from Ramona as possible. \"He came and spoke to\nme last night after I was in bed; but I told him to wait till morning,\nand then I would hear all he had to say.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" said the Senora, relieved. Then, as Felipe remained silent, she\nasked, \"And what did he say?\"\n\n\"He told me all that had happened.\"\n\n\"All!\" said the Senora, sneeringly. \"Do you suppose that he told you\nall?\"\n\n\"He said that you had bidden him begone out of your sight,\" said Felipe,\n\"and that he supposed he must go. So I told him to go at once. I thought\nyou would prefer not to see him again.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" said the Senora again, startled, gratified that Felipe had so\npromptly seconded her action, but sorry that Alessandro had gone. \"Ah, I\ndid not know whether you would think it best to discharge him at once\nor not; I told him he must answer to you. I did not know but you might\ndevise some measures by which he could be retained on the estate.\"\n\nFelipe stared. Could he believe his ears? This did not sound like the\nrelentless displeasure he had expected. Could Ramona have been dreaming?\nIn his astonishment, he did not weigh his mother's words carefully; he\ndid not carry his conjecture far enough; he did not stop to make sure\nthat retaining Alessandro on the estate might not of necessity bode any\ngood to Ramona; but with his usual impetuous ardor, sanguine, at the\nfirst glimpse of hope, that all was well, he exclaimed joyfully, \"Ah,\ndear mother, if that could only be done, all would be well;\" and, never\nnoting the expression of his mother's face, nor pausing to take breath,\nhe poured out all he thought and felt on the subject.\n\n\"That is just what I have been hoping for ever since I saw that he and\nRamona were growing so fond of each other. He is a splendid fellow, and\nthe best hand we have ever had on the place. All the men like him; he\nwould make a capital overseer; and if we put him in charge of the whole\nestate, there would not be any objection to his marrying Ramona. That\nwould give them a good living here with us.\"\n\n\"Enough!\" cried the Senora, in a voice which fell on Felipe's ears\nlike a voice from some other world,--so hollow, so strange. He stopped\nspeaking, and uttered an ejaculation of amazement. At the first words\nhe had uttered, the Senora had fixed her eyes on the floor,--a habit of\nhers when she wished to listen with close attention. Lifting her eyes\nnow, fixing them full on Felipe, she regarded him with a look which not\nall his filial reverence could bear without resentment. It was nearly as\nscornful as that with which she had regarded Ramona. Felipe colored.\n\n\"Why do you look at me like that, mother?\" he exclaimed. \"What have I\ndone?\"\n\nThe Senora waved her hand imperiously. \"Enough!\" she reiterated. \"Do not\nsay any more. I wish to think for a few moments;\" and she fixed her eyes\non the floor again.\n\nFelipe studied her countenance. A more nearly rebellious feeling than\nhe had supposed himself capable of slowly arose in his heart. Now he for\nthe first time perceived what terror his mother must inspire in a girl\nlike Ramona.\n\n\"Poor little one!\" he thought. \"If my mother looked at her as she did at\nme just now, I wonder she did not die.\"\n\nA great storm was going on in the Senora's bosom. Wrath against Ramona\nwas uppermost in it. In addition to all else, the girl had now been the\ncause, or at least the occasion, of Felipe's having, for the first time\nin his whole life, angered her beyond her control.\n\n\"As if I had not suffered enough by reason of that creature,\" she\nthought bitterly to herself, \"without her coming between me and Felipe!\"\n\nBut nothing could long come between the Senora and Felipe. Like a fresh\nlava-stream flowing down close on the track of its predecessor, came the\nrush of the mother's passionate love for her son close on the passionate\nanger at his words.\n\nWhen she lifted her eyes they were full of tears, which it smote Felipe\nto see. As she gazed at him, they rolled down her cheeks, and she said\nin trembling tones: \"Forgive me, my child; I had not thought anything\ncould make me thus angry with you. That shameless creature is costing us\ntoo dear. She must leave the house.\"\n\nFelipe's heart gave a bound; Ramona had not been mistaken, then. A\nbitter shame seized him at his mother's cruelty. But her tears made him\ntender; and it was in a gentle, even pleading voice that he replied:\n\"I do not see, mother, why you call Ramona shameless. There is nothing\nwrong in her loving Alessandro.\"\n\n\"I found her in his arms!\" exclaimed the Senora.\n\n\"I know,\" said Felipe; \"Alessandro told me that he had just at that\ninstant told her he loved her, and she had said she loved him, and would\nmarry him, just as you came up.\"\n\n\"Humph!\" retorted the Senora; \"do you think that Indian would have dared\nto speak a word of love to the Senorita Ramona Ortegna, if she had not\nconducted herself shamelessly? I wonder that he concerned himself to\nspeak about marriage to her at all.\"\n\n\"Oh, mother! mother!\" was all that Felipe could say to this. He was\naghast. He saw now, in a flash, the whole picture as it lay in his\nmother's mind, and his heart sank within him. \"Mother!\" he repeated, in\na tone which spoke volumes.\n\n\"Ay,\" she continued, \"that is what I say. I see no reason why he\nhesitated to take her, as he would take any Indian squaw, with small\nceremony of marrying.\"\n\n\"Alessandro would not take any woman that way any quicker than I would,\nmother,\" said Felipe courageously; \"you do him injustice.\" He longed\nto add, \"And Ramona too,\" but he feared to make bad matters worse by\npleading for her at present.\n\n\"No, I do not,\" said the Senora; \"I do Alessandro full justice. I\nthink very few men would have behaved as well as he has under the same\ntemptation. I do not hold him in the least responsible for all that has\nhappened. It is all Ramona's fault.\"\n\nFelipe's patience gave way. He had not known, till now, how very closely\nthis pure and gentle girl, whom he had loved as a sister in his boyhood,\nand had come near loving as a lover in his manhood, had twined herself\naround his heart. He could not remain silent another moment, and hear\nher thus wickedly accused.\n\n\"Mother!\" he exclaimed, in a tone which made the Senora look up at him\nin sudden astonishment. \"Mother, I cannot help it if I make you very\nangry; I must speak; I can't bear to hear you say such things of Ramona.\nI have seen for a long time that Alessandro loved the very ground under\nher feet; and Ramona would not have been a woman if she had not seen it\ntoo! She has seen it, and has felt it, and has come to love him with all\nher soul, just as I hope some woman will love me one of these days. If I\nam ever loved as well as she loves Alessandro, I shall be lucky. I think\nthey ought to be married; and I think we ought to take Alessandro on to\nthe estate, so that they can live here. I don't see anything disgraceful\nin it, nor anything wrong, nor anything but what was perfectly natural.\nYou know, mother, it isn't as if Ramona really belonged to our family;\nyou know she is half Indian.\" A scornful ejaculation from his mother\ninterrupted him here; but Felipe hurried on, partly because he was borne\nout of himself at last by impetuous feeling, partly that he dreaded to\nstop, because if he did, his mother would speak; and already he felt\na terror of what her next words might be. \"I have often thought about\nRamona's future, mother. You know a great many men would not want to\nmarry her, just because she is half Indian. You, yourself, would never\nhave given your consent to my marrying her, if I had wanted to.\" Again\nan exclamation from the Senora, this time more of horror than of scorn.\nBut Felipe pressed on. \"No, of course you would not, I always knew that;\nexcept for that, I might have loved her myself, for a sweeter girl\nnever drew breath in this God's earth.\" Felipe was reckless now; having\nentered on this war, he would wage it with every weapon that lay within\nhis reach; if one did not tell, another might. \"You have never loved\nher. I don't know that you have ever even liked her; I don't think you\nhave. I know, as a little boy, I always used to see how much kinder you\nwere to me than to her, and I never could understand it. And you are\nunjust to her now. I've been watching her all summer; I've seen her and\nAlessandro together continually. You know yourself, mother, he has been\nwith us on the veranda, day after day, just as if he were one of the\nfamily. I've watched them by the hour, when I lay there so sick; I\nthought you must have seen it too. I don't believe Alessandro has ever\nlooked or said or done a thing I wouldn't have done in his place; and I\ndon't believe Ramona has ever looked, said, or done a thing I would not\nbe willing to have my own sister do!\" Here Felipe paused. He had made\nhis charge; like a young impetuous general, massing all his forces at\nthe onset; he had no reserves. It is not the way to take Gibraltars.\n\nWhen he paused, literally breathless, he had spoken so fast,--and even\nyet Felipe was not quite strong, so sadly had the fever undermined his\nconstitution,--the Senora looked at him interrogatively, and said in\na now composed tone: \"You do not believe that Ramona has done anything\nthat you would not be willing to have your own sister do? Would you be\nwilling that your own sister should marry Alessandro?\"\n\nClever Senora Moreno! During the few moments that Felipe had been\nspeaking, she had perceived certain things which it would be beyond her\npower to do; certain others that it would be impolitic to try to do.\nNothing could possibly compensate her for antagonizing Felipe. Nothing\ncould so deeply wound her, as to have him in a resentful mood towards\nher; or so weaken her real control of him, as to have him feel that she\narbitrarily overruled his preference or his purpose. In presence of her\nimperious will, even her wrath capitulated and surrendered. There would\nbe no hot words between her and her son. He should believe that he\ndetermined the policy of the Moreno house, even in this desperate\ncrisis.\n\nFelipe did not answer. A better thrust was never seen on any field than\nthe Senora's question. She repeated it, still more deliberately, in her\nwonted gentle voice. The Senora was herself again, as she had not been\nfor a moment since she came upon Alessandro and Ramona at the brook.\nHow just and reasonable the question sounded, as she repeated it slowly,\nwith an expression in her eyes, of poising and weighing matters. \"Would\nyou be willing that your own sister should marry Alessandro?\"\n\nFelipe was embarrassed. He saw whither he was being led. He could give\nbut one answer to this question. \"No, mother,\" he said, \"I should not;\nbut--\"\n\n\"Never mind buts,\" interrupted his mother; \"we have not got to those\nyet;\" and she smiled on Felipe,--an affectionate smile, but it somehow\ngave him a feeling of dread. \"Of course I knew you could make but one\nanswer to my question. If you had a sister, you would rather see her\ndead than married to any one of these Indians.\"\n\nFelipe opened his lips eagerly, to speak. \"Not so,\" he said.\n\n\"Wait, dear!\" exclaimed his mother. \"One thing at a time, I see how full\nyour loving heart is, and I was never prouder of you as my son than when\nlistening just now to your eloquent defence of Ramona, Perhaps you\nmay be right and I wrong as to her character and conduct. We will not\ndiscuss those points.\" It was here that the Senora had perceived some\nthings that it would be out of her power to do. \"We will not discuss\nthose, because they do not touch the real point at issue. What it is\nour duty to do by Ramona, in such a matter as this, does not turn on\nher worthiness or unworthiness. The question is, Is it right for you\nto allow her to do what you would not allow your own sister to do?\" The\nSenora paused for a second, noted with secret satisfaction how puzzled\nand unhappy Felipe looked; then, in a still gentler voice, she went on,\n\"You surely would not think that right, my son, would you?\" And now the\nSenora waited for an answer.\n\n\"No, mother,\" came reluctantly from Felipe's lips. \"I suppose not;\nbut--\"\n\n\"I was sure my own son could make no other reply,\" interrupted the\nSenora. She did not wish Felipe at present to do more than reply to\nher questions. \"Of course it would not be right for us to let Ramona\ndo anything which we would not let her do if she were really of our own\nblood. That is the way I have always looked at my obligation to her. My\nsister intended to rear her as her own daughter. She had given her her\nown name. When my sister died, she transferred to me all her right and\nresponsibility in and for the child. You do not suppose that if your\naunt had lived, she would have ever given her consent to her adopted\ndaughter's marrying an Indian, do you?\"\n\nAgain the Senora paused for a reply, and again the reluctant Felipe\nsaid, in a low tone, \"No, I suppose she would not.\"\n\n\"Very well. Then that lays a double obligation on us. It is not only\nthat we are not to permit Ramona to do a thing which we would consider\ndisgraceful to one of our own blood; we are not to betray the trust\nreposed in us by the only person who had a right to control her, and who\ntransferred that trust to us. Is not that so?\"\n\n\"Yes, mother,\" said the unhappy Felipe.\n\nHe saw the meshes closing around him. He felt that there was a flaw\nsomewhere in his mother's reasoning, but he could not point it out;\nin fact, he could hardly make it distinct to himself. His brain was\nconfused. Only one thing he saw clearly, and that was, that after all\nhad been said and done, Ramona would still marry Alessandro. But it was\nevident that it would never be with his mother's consent. \"Nor with mine\neither, openly, the way she puts it. I don't see how it can be; and yet\nI have promised Alessandro to do all I could for him. Curse the luck,\nI wish he had never set foot on the place!\" said Felipe in his heart,\ngrowing unreasonable, and tired with the perplexity.\n\nThe Senora continued: \"I shall always blame myself bitterly for having\nfailed to see what was going on. As you say, Alessandro has been with\nus a great deal since your illness, with his music, and singing, and one\nthing and another; but I can truly say that I never thought of Ramona's\nbeing in danger of looking upon him in the light of a possible lover,\nany more than of her looking thus upon Juan Canito, or Luigo, or any\nother of the herdsmen or laborers. I regret it more than words can\nexpress, and I do not know what we can do, now that it has happened.\"\n\n\"That's it, mother! That's it!\" broke in Felipe. \"You see, you see it is\ntoo late now.\"\n\nThe Senora went on as if Felipe had not spoken. \"I suppose you would\nreally very much regret to part with Alessandro, and your word is in a\nway pledged to him, as you had asked him if he would stay on the place,\nOf course, now that all this has happened, it would be very unpleasant\nfor Ramona to stay here, and see him continually--at least for a time,\nuntil she gets over this strange passion she seems to have conceived\nfor him. It will not last. Such sudden passions never do.\" The Senora\nartfully interpolated, \"What should you think, Felipe, of having her go\nback to the Sisters' school for a time? She was very happy there.\"\n\nThe Senora had strained a point too far. Felipe's self-control suddenly\ngave way, and as impetuously as he had spoken in the beginning, he spoke\nagain now, nerved by the memory of Ramona's face and tone as she had\ncried to him in the garden, \"Oh, Felipe, you won't let her shut me up\nin the convent, will you?\" \"Mother!\" he cried, \"you would never do that.\nYou would not shut the poor girl up in the convent!\"\n\nThe Senora raised her eyebrows in astonishment. \"Who spoke of shutting\nup?\" she said. \"Ramona has already been there at school. She might go\nagain. She is not too old to learn. A change of scene and occupation is\nthe best possible cure for a girl who has a thing of this sort to get\nover. Can you propose anything better, my son? What would you advise?\"\nAnd a third time the Senora paused for an answer.\n\nThese pauses and direct questions of the Senora's were like nothing\nin life so much as like that stage in a spider's processes when,\nwithdrawing a little way from a half-entangled victim, which still\nsupposes himself free, it rests from its weaving, and watches the victim\nflutter. Subtle questions like these, assuming, taking for granted as\nsettled, much which had never been settled at all, were among the best\nweapons in the Senora's armory. They rarely failed her.\n\n\"Advise!\" cried Felipe, excitedly. \"Advise! This is what I advise--to\nlet Ramona and Alessandro marry. I can't help all you say about our\nobligations. I dare say you're right; and it's a cursedly awkward\ncomplication for us, anyhow, the way you put it.\"\n\n\"Yes, awkward for you, as the head of our house,\" interrupted the\nSenora, sighing. \"I don't quite see how you would face it.\"\n\n\"Well, I don't propose to face it,\" continued Felipe, testily. \"I don't\npropose to have anything to do with it, from first to last. Let her go\naway with him, if she wants to.'\n\n\"Without our consent?\" said the Senora, gently.\n\n\"Yes, without it, if she can't go with it; and I don't see, as you have\nstated it, how we could exactly take any responsibility about marrying\nher to Alessandro. But for heaven's sake, mother, let her go! She will\ngo, any way. You haven't the least idea how she loves Alessandro, or how\nhe loves her. Let her go!\"\n\n\"Do you really think she would run away with him, if it came to that?\"\nasked the Senora, earnestly. \"Run away and marry him, spite of our\nrefusing to consent to the marriage?\"\n\n\"I do,\" said Felipe.\n\n\"Then it is your opinion, is it, that the only thing left for us to do,\nis to wash our hands of it altogether, and leave her free to do what she\npleases?\"\n\n\"That's just what I do think, mother,\" replied Felipe, his heart growing\nlighter at her words. \"That's just what I do think. We can't prevent\nit, and it is of no use to try. Do let us tell them they can do as they\nlike.\"\n\n\"Of course, Alessandro must leave us, then,\" said the Senora. \"They\ncould not stay here.\"\n\n\"I don't see why!\" said Felipe, anxiously.\n\n\"You will, my son, if you think a moment. Could we possibly give a\nstronger indorsement to their marriage than by keeping them here? Don't\nyou see that would be so?\"\n\nFelipe's eyes fell. \"Then I suppose they couldn't be married here,\neither,\" he said.\n\n\"What more could we do than that, for a marriage that we heartily\napproved of, my son?\"\n\n\"True, mother;\" and Felipe clapped his hand to his forehead. \"But then\nwe force them to run away!\"\n\n\"Oh, no.\" said the Senora, icily. \"If they go, they will go of their\nown accord. We hope they will never do anything so foolish and wrong. If\nthey do, I suppose we shall always be held in a measure responsible for\nnot having prevented it. But if you think it is not wise, or of no use\nto attempt that, I do not see what there is to be done.\"\n\nFelipe did not speak. He felt discomfited; felt as if he had betrayed\nhis friend Alessandro, his sister Ramona; as if a strange complication,\nnetwork of circumstances, had forced him into a false position; he did\nnot see what more he could ask, what more could be asked, of his mother;\nhe did not see, either, that much less could have been granted to\nAlessandro and Ramona; he was angry, wearied, perplexed.\n\nThe Senora studied his face. \"You do not seem satisfied, Felipe dear,\"\nshe said tenderly. \"As, indeed, how could you be in this unfortunate\nstate of affairs? But can you think of anything different for us to do?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Felipe, bitterly. \"I can't, that's the worst of it. It is\njust turning Ramona out of the house, that's all.\"\n\n\"Felipe! Felipe!\" exclaimed the Senora, \"how unjust you are to yourself!\nYou know you would never do that! You know that she has always had a\nhome here as if she were a daughter; and always will have, as long as\nshe wishes it. If she chooses to turn her back on it, and go away, is\nit our fault? Do not let your pity for this misguided girl blind you to\nwhat is just to yourself and to me. Turn Ramona out of the house! You\nknow I promised my sister to bring her up as my own child; and I have\nalways felt that my son would receive the trust from me, when I died.\nRamona has a home under the Moreno roof so long as she will accept it.\nIt is not just, Felipe, to say that we turn her out;\" and tears stood in\nthe Senora's eyes.\n\n\"Forgive me, dear mother,\" cried the unhappy Felipe. \"Forgive me for\nadding one burden to all you have to bear. Truth is, this miserable\nbusiness has so distraught my senses, I can't seem to see anything as it\nis. Dear mother, it is very hard for you. I wish it were done with.\"\n\n\"Thanks for your precious sympathy, my Felipe,\" replied the Senora. \"If\nit were not for you, I should long ago have broken down beneath my cares\nand burdens. But among them all, have been few so grievous as this. I\nfeel myself and our home dishonored. But we must submit. As you say,\nFelipe, I wish it were done with. It would be as well, perhaps, to send\nfor Ramona at once, and tell her what we have decided. She is no doubt\nin great anxiety; we will see her here.\"\n\nFelipe would have greatly preferred to see Ramona alone; but as he knew\nnot how to bring this about he assented to his mother's suggestion.\n\nOpening her door, the Senora walked slowly down the passage-way,\nunlocked Ramona's door, and said: \"Ramona, be so good as to come to my\nroom. Felipe and I have something to say to you.\"\n\nRamona followed, heavy-hearted. The words, \"Felipe and I,\" boded no\ngood.\n\n\"The Senora has made Felipe think just as she does herself,\" thought\nRamona. \"Oh, what will become of me!\" and she stole a reproachful,\nimploring look at Felipe. He smiled back in a way which reassured her;\nbut the reassurance did not last long.\n\n\"Senorita Ramona Ortegna,\" began the Senora. Felipe shivered. He had had\nno conception that his mother could speak in that way. The words seemed\nto open a gulf between Ramona and all the rest of the world, so cold\nand distant they sounded,--as the Senora might speak to an intruding\nstranger.\n\n\"Senorita Ramona Ortegna,\" she said, \"my son and I have been discussing\nwhat it is best for us to do in the mortifying and humiliating position\nin which you place us by your relation with the Indian Alessandro. Of\ncourse you know--or you ought to know--that it is utterly impossible\nfor us to give our consent to your making such a marriage; we should be\nfalse to a trust, and dishonor our own family name, if we did that.\"\n\nRamona's eyes dilated, her cheeks paled; she opened her lips, but no\nsound came from them; she looked toward Felipe, and seeing him with\ndowncast eyes, and an expression of angry embarrassment on his face,\ndespair seized her. Felipe had deserted their cause. Oh, where, where\nwas Alessandro! Clasping her hands, she uttered a low cry,--a cry that\ncut Felipe to the heart. He was finding out, in thus being witness of\nRamona's suffering, that she was far nearer and dearer to him than he\nhad realized. It would have taken very little, at such moments as these,\nto have made Felipe her lover again; he felt now like springing to her\nside, folding his arms around her, and bidding his mother defiance. It\ntook all the self-control he could gather, to remain silent, and trust\nto Ramona's understanding him later.\n\nRamona's cry made no break in the smooth, icy flow of the Senora's\nsentences. She gave no sign of having heard it, but continued: \"My son\ntells me that he thinks our forbidding it would make no difference; that\nyou would go away with the man all the same. I suppose he is right in\nthinking so, as you yourself told me that even if Father Salvierderra\nforbade it, you would disobey him. Of course, if this is your\ndetermination, we are powerless. Even if I were to put you in the\nkeeping of the Church, which is what I am sure my sister, who adopted\nyou as her child, would do, if she were alive, you would devise some\nmeans of escape, and thus bring a still greater and more public scandal\non the family. Felipe thinks that it is not worth while to attempt to\nbring you to reason in that way; and we shall therefore do nothing. I\nwish to impress it upon you that my son, as head of this house, and I,\nas my sister's representative, consider you a member of our own family.\nSo long as we have a home for ourselves, that home is yours, as it\nalways has been. If you choose to leave it, and to disgrace yourself and\nus by marrying an Indian, we cannot help ourselves.\"\n\nThe Senora paused. Ramona did not speak. Her eyes were fixed on the\nSenora's face, as if she would penetrate to her inmost soul; the girl\nwas beginning to recognize the Senora's true nature; her instincts and\nher perceptions were sharpened by love.\n\n\"Have you anything to say to me or to my son?\" asked the Senora.\n\n\"No, Senora,\" replied Ramona; \"I do not think of anything more to say\nthan I said this morning. Yes,\" she added, \"there is. Perhaps I shall\nnot speak with you again before I go away. I thank you once more for\nthe home you have given me for so many years. And you too, Felipe,\" she\ncontinued, turning towards Felipe, her face changing, all her pent-up\naffection and sorrow looking out of her tearful eyes,--\"you too, dear\nFelipe. You have always been so good to me. I shall always love you as\nlong as I live;\" and she held out both her hands to him. Felipe took\nthem in his, and was about to speak, when the Senora interrupted\nhim. She did not intend to have any more of this sort of affectionate\nfamiliarity between her son and Ramona.\n\n\"Are we to understand that you are taking your leave now?\" she said. \"Is\nit your purpose to go at once?\"\n\n\"I do not know, Senora,\" stammered Ramona; \"I have not seen Alessandro;\nI have not heard--\" And she looked up in distress at Felipe, who\nanswered compassionately,--\n\n\"Alessandro has gone.\"\n\n\"Gone!\" shrieked Ramona. \"Gone! not gone, Felipe!\"\n\n\"Only for four days,\" replied Felipe. \"To Temecula. I thought it would\nbe better for him to be away for a day or two. He is to come back\nimmediately. Perhaps he will be back day after to-morrow.\"\n\n\"Did he want to go? What did he go for? Why didn't you let me go with\nhim? Oh, why, why did he go?\" cried Ramona.\n\n\"He went because my son told him to go,\" broke in the Senora, impatient\nof this scene, and of the sympathy she saw struggling in Felipe's\nexpressive features. \"My son thought, and rightly, that the sight of him\nwould be more than I could bear just now; so he ordered him to go away,\nand Alessandro obeyed.\"\n\nLike a wounded creature at bay, Ramona turned suddenly away from Felipe,\nand facing the Senora, her eyes resolute and dauntless spite of the\nstreaming tears, exclaimed, lifting her right hand as she spoke, \"You\nhave been cruel; God will punish you!\" and without waiting to see what\neffect her words had produced, without looking again at Felipe, she\nwalked swiftly out of the room.\n\n\"You see,\" said the Senora, \"you see she defies us.\"\n\n\"She is desperate,\" said Felipe. \"I am sorry I sent Alessandro away.\"\n\n\"No, my son,\" replied the Senora, \"you were wise, as you always are.\nIt may bring her to her senses, to have a few days' reflection in\nsolitude.\"\n\n\"You do not mean to keep her locked up, mother, do you?\" cried Felipe.\n\nThe Senora turned a look of apparently undisguised amazement on him.\n\"You would not think that best, would you? Did you not say that all we\ncould do, was simply not to interfere with her in any way? To wash our\nhands, so far as is possible, of all responsibility about her?\"\n\n\"Yes, yes,\" said the baffled Felipe; \"that was what I said. But,\nmother--\" He stopped. He did not know what he wanted to say.\n\nThe Senora looked tenderly at him, her face full of anxious inquiry.\n\n\"What is it, Felipe dear? Is there anything more you think I ought to\nsay or do?\" she asked.\n\n\"What is it you are going to do, mother?\" said Felipe. \"I don't seem to\nunderstand what you are going to do.\"\n\n\"Nothing, Felipe! You have entirely convinced me that all effort would\nbe thrown away. I shall do nothing,\" replied the Senora. \"Nothing\nwhatever.\"\n\n\"Then as long as Ramona is here, everything will be just as it always\nhas been?\" said Felipe.\n\nThe Senora smiled sadly. \"Dear Felipe, do you think that possible? A\ngirl who has announced her determination to disobey not only you and\nme, but Father Salvierderra, who is going to bring disgrace both on the\nMoreno and the Ortegna name,--we can't feel exactly the same towards her\nas we did before, can we?\"\n\nFelipe made an impatient gesture. \"No, of course not. But I mean, is\neverything to be just the same, outwardly, as it was before?\"\n\n\"I supposed so,\" said the Senora. \"Was not that your idea? We must try\nto have it so, I think. Do not you?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" groaned Felipe, \"if we can!\"\n\n\n\n\nXIII\n\nTHE Senora Moreno had never before been so discomfited as in this matter\nof Ramona and Alessandro. It chafed her to think over her conversation\nwith Felipe; to recall how far the thing she finally attained was from\nthe thing she had in view when she began. To have Ramona sent to the\nconvent, Alessandro kept as overseer of the place, and the Ortegna\njewels turned into the treasury of the Church,--this was the plan she\nhad determined on in her own mind. Instead of this, Alessandro was not\nto be overseer on the place; Ramona would not go to the convent: she\nwould be married to Alessandro, and they would go away together; and\nthe Ortegna jewels,--well, that was a thing to be decided in the future;\nthat should be left to Father Salvierderra to decide. Bold as the Senora\nwas, she had not quite the courage requisite to take that question\nwholly into her own hands.\n\nOne thing was clear, Felipe must not be consulted in regard to them. He\nhad never known of them, and need not now. Felipe was far too much in\nsympathy with Ramona to take a just view of the situation. He would be\nsure to have a quixotic idea of Ramona's right of ownership. It was not\nimpossible that Father Salvierderra might have the same feeling. If so,\nshe must yield; but that would go harder with her than all the rest.\nAlmost the Senora would have been ready to keep the whole thing a secret\nfrom the Father, if he had not been at the time of the Senora Ortegna's\ndeath fully informed of all the particulars of her bequest to her\nadopted child. At any rate, it would be nearly a year before the Father\ncame again, and in the mean time she would not risk writing about it.\nThe treasure was as safe in Saint Catharine's keeping as it had been all\nthese fourteen years; it should still lie hidden there. When Ramona went\naway with Alessandro, she would write to Father Salvierderra, simply\nstating the facts in her own way, and telling him that all further\nquestions must wait for decision until they met.\n\nAnd so she plotted and planned, and mapped out the future in her\ntireless weaving brain, till she was somewhat soothed for the partial\nfailure of her plans.\n\nThere is nothing so skilful in its own defence as imperious pride. It\nhas an ingenious system of its own, of reprisals,--a system so ingenious\nthat the defeat must be sore indeed, after which it cannot still\nfind some booty to bring off! And even greater than this ingenuity at\nreprisals is its capacity for self-deception. In this regard, it outdoes\nvanity a thousandfold. Wounded vanity knows when it is mortally hurt;\nand limps off the field, piteous, all disguises thrown away. But pride\ncarries its banner to the last; and fast as it is driven from one field\nunfurls it in another, never admitting that there is a shade less honor\nin the second field than in the first, or in the third than in the\nsecond; and so on till death. It is impossible not to have a certain\nsort of admiration for this kind of pride. Cruel, those who have it, are\nto all who come in their way; but they are equally cruel to themselves,\nwhen pride demands the sacrifice. Such pride as this has led many a\nforlorn hope, on the earth, when all other motives have died out of\nmen's breasts; has won many a crown, which has not been called by its\ntrue name.\n\nBefore the afternoon was over, the Senora had her plan, her chart of\nthe future, as it were, all reconstructed; the sting of her discomfiture\nsoothed; the placid quiet of her manner restored; her habitual\noccupations also, and little ways, all resumed. She was going to do\n\"nothing\" in regard to Ramona. Only she herself knew how much that\nmeant; how bitterly much! She wished she were sure that Felipe also\nwould do \"nothing;\" but her mind still misgave her about Felipe.\nUnpityingly she had led him on, and entangled him in his own words,\nstep by step, till she had brought him to the position she wished him to\ntake. Ostensibly, his position and hers were one, their action a unit;\nall the same, she did not deceive herself as to his real feeling about\nthe affair. He loved Ramona. He liked Alessandro. Barring the question\nof family pride, which he had hardly thought of till she suggested\nit, and which he would not dwell on apart from her continuing to press\nit,--barring this, he would have liked to have Alessandro marry Ramona\nand remain on the place. All this would come uppermost in Felipe's\nmind again when he was removed from the pressure of her influence.\nNevertheless, she did not intend to speak with him on the subject again,\nor to permit him to speak to her. Her ends would be best attained\nby taking and keeping the ground that the question of their\nnon-interference having been settled once for all, the painful topic\nshould never be renewed between them. In patient silence they must await\nRamona's action; must bear whatever of disgrace and pain she chose to\ninflict on the family which had sheltered her from her infancy till now.\n\nThe details of the \"nothing\" she proposed to do, slowly arranged\nthemselves in her mind. There should be no apparent change in Ramona's\nposition in the house. She should come and go as freely as ever; no\nwatch on her movements; she should eat, sleep, rise up and sit down\nwith them, as before; there should be not a word, or act, that Felipe's\nsympathetic sensitiveness could construe into any provocation to Ramona\nto run away. Nevertheless, Ramona should be made to feel, every moment\nof every hour, that she was in disgrace; that she was with them, but not\nof them; that she had chosen an alien's position, and must abide by it.\nHow this was to be done, the Senora did not put in words to herself, but\nshe knew very well. If anything would bring the girl to her senses, this\nwould. There might still be a hope, the Senora believed, so little did\nshe know Ramona's nature, or the depth of her affection for Alessandro,\nthat she might be in this manner brought to see the enormity of the\noffence she would commit if she persisted in her purpose. And if she did\nperceive this, confess her wrong, and give up the marriage,--the Senora\ngrew almost generous and tolerant in her thoughts as she contemplated\nthis contingency,--if she did thus humble herself and return to her\nrightful allegiance to the Moreno house, the Senora would forgive her,\nand would do more for her than she had ever hitherto done. She would\ntake her to Los Angeles and to Monterey; would show her a little more\nof the world; and it was by no means unlikely that there might thus come\nabout for her a satisfactory and honorable marriage. Felipe should see\nthat she was not disposed to deal unfairly by Ramona in any way, if\nRamona herself would behave properly.\n\nRamona's surprise, when the Senora entered her room just before supper,\nand, in her ordinary tone, asked a question about the chili which was\ndrying on the veranda, was so great, that she could not avoid showing it\nboth in her voice and look.\n\nThe Senora recognized this immediately, but gave no sign of having done\nso, continuing what she had to say about the chili, the hot sun, the\nturning of the grapes, etc., precisely as she would have spoken to\nRamona a week previous. At least, this was what Ramona at first thought;\nbut before the sentences were finished, she had detected in the Senora's\neye and tone the weapons which were to be employed against her. The\nemotion of half-grateful wonder with which she had heard the first words\nchanged quickly to heartsick misery before they were concluded; and\nshe said to herself: \"That's the way she is going to break me down, she\nthinks! But she can't do it. I can bear anything for four days; and the\nminute Alessandro comes, I will go away with him.\" This train of thought\nin Ramona's mind was reflected in her face. The Senora saw it, and\nhardened herself still more. It was to be war, then. No hope of\nsurrender. Very well. The girl had made her choice.\n\nMargarita was now the most puzzled person in the household. She had\noverheard snatches of the conversation between Felipe and his mother and\nRamona, having let her curiosity get so far the better of her discretion\nas to creep to the door and listen. In fact, she narrowly escaped\nbeing caught, having had barely time to begin her feint of sweeping the\npassage-way, when Ramona, flinging the door wide open, came out,\nafter her final reply to the Senora, the words of which Margarita had\ndistinctly heard: \"God will punish you.\"\n\n\"Holy Virgin! how dare she say that to the Senora?\" ejaculated\nMargarita, under her breath; and the next second Ramona rushed by, not\neven seeing her. But the Senora's vigilant eyes, following Ramona,\nsaw her; and the Senora's voice had a ring of suspicion in it, as she\ncalled, \"How comes it you are sweeping the passage-way at this hour of\nthe day, Margarita?\"\n\nIt was surely the devil himself that put into Margarita's head the quick\nlie which she instantaneously told. \"There was early breakfast, Senora,\nto be cooked for Alessandro, who was setting off in haste, and my mother\nwas not up, so I had it to cook.\"\n\nAs Margarita said this, Felipe fixed his eyes steadily upon her. She\nchanged color. Felipe knew this was a lie. He had seen Margarita peering\nabout among the willows while he was talking with Alessandro at the\nsheepfold; he had seen Alessandro halt for a moment and speak to her as\nhe rode past,--only for a moment; then, pricking his horse sharply, he\nhad galloped off down the valley road. No breakfast had Alessandro had\nat Margarita's hands, or any other's, that morning. What could have been\nMargarita's motive for telling this lie?\n\nBut Felipe had too many serious cares on his mind to busy himself long\nwith any thought of Margarita or her fibs. She had said the first thing\nwhich came into her head, most likely, to shelter herself from the\nSenora's displeasure; which was indeed very near the truth, only there\nwas added a spice of malice against Alessandro. A slight undercurrent of\njealous antagonism towards him had begun to grow up among the servants\nof late; fostered, if not originated, by Margarita's sharp sayings as to\nhis being admitted to such strange intimacy with the family.\n\nWhile Felipe continued ill, and was so soothed to rest by his music,\nthere was no room for cavil. It was natural that Alessandro came and\nwent as a physician might. But after Felipe had recovered, why should\nthis freedom and intimacy continue? More than once there had been sullen\nmutterings of this kind on the north veranda, when all the laborers\nand servants were gathered there of an evening, Alessandro alone being\nabsent from the group, and the sounds of his voice or his violin coming\nfrom the south veranda, where the family sat.\n\n\"It would be a good thing if we too had a bit of music now and then,\"\nJuan Canito would grumble; \"but the lad's chary enough of his bow on\nthis side the house.\"\n\n\"Ho! we're not good enough for him to play to!\" Margarita would reply;\n\"'Like master, like servant,' is a good proverb sometimes, but not\nalways. But there's a deal going on, on the veranda yonder, besides\nfiddling!\" and Margarita's lips would purse themselves up in an\nexpression of concentrated mystery and secret knowledge, well fitted to\ndraw from everybody a fire of questions, none of which, however, would\nshe answer. She knew better than to slander the Senorita Ramona, or to\nsay a word even reflecting upon her unfavorably. Not a man or a woman\nthere would have borne it. They all had loved Ramona ever since she came\namong them as a toddling baby. They petted her then, and idolized her\nnow. Not one of them whom she had not done good offices for,--nursed\nthem, cheered them, remembered their birthdays and their saints'-days.\nTo no one but her mother had Margarita unbosomed what she knew, and what\nshe suspected; and old Marda, frightened at the bare pronouncing of such\nwords, had terrified Margarita into the solemnest of promises never,\nunder any circumstances whatever, to say such things to any other member\nof the family. Marda did not believe them. She could not. She believed\nthat Margarita's jealousy had imagined all.\n\n\"And the Senora; she'd send you packing off this place in an hour,\nand me too, long's I've lived here, if ever she was to know of you\nblackening the Senorita. An Indian, too! You must be mad, Margarita!\"\n\nWhen Margarita, in triumph, had flown to tell her that the Senora had\njust dragged the Senorita Ramona up the garden-walk, and shoved her into\nher room and locked the door, and that it was because she had caught her\nwith Alessandro at the washing-stones, Marda first crossed herself in\nsheer mechanical fashion at the shock of the story, and then cuffed\nMargarita's ears for telling her.\n\n\"I'll take the head off your neck, if you say that aloud again!\nWhatever's come to the Senora! Forty years I've lived under this roof,\nand I never saw her lift a hand to a living creature yet. You're out of\nyour senses, child!\" she said, all the time gazing fearfully towards the\nroom.\n\n\"You'll see whether I am out of my senses or not,\" retorted Margarita,\nand ran back to the dining-room. And after the dining-room door was\nshut, and the unhappy pretence of a supper had begun, old Marda had\nherself crept softly to the Senorita's door and listened, and heard\nRamona sobbing as if her heart would break. Then she knew that what\nMargarita had said must be true, and her faithful soul was in sore\nstraits what to think. The Senorita misdemean herself! Never! Whatever\nhappened, it was not that! There was some horrible mistake somewhere.\nKneeling at the keyhole, she had called cautiously to Ramona, \"Oh, my\nlamb, what is it?\" But Ramona had not heard her, and the danger was too\ngreat of remaining; so scrambling up with difficulty from her rheumatic\nknees, the old woman had hobbled back to the kitchen as much in the dark\nas before, and, by a curiously illogical consequence, crosser than ever\nto her daughter. All the next day she watched for herself, and could\nnot but see that all appearances bore out Margarita's statements.\nAlessandro's sudden departure had been a tremendous corroboration of the\nstory. Not one of the men had had an inkling of it; Juan Canito, Luigo,\nboth alike astonished; no word left, no message sent; only Senor Felipe\nhad said carelessly to Juan Can, after breakfast: \"You'll have to look\nafter things yourself for a few days, Juan. Alessandro has gone to\nTemecula.\"\n\n\"For a few days!\" exclaimed Margarita, sarcastically, when this was\nrepeated to her. \"That's easy said! If Alessandro Assis is seen here\nagain, I'll eat my head! He's played his last tune on the south veranda,\nI wager you.\"\n\nBut when at supper-time of this same eventful day the Senora was heard,\nas she passed the Senorita's door, to say in her ordinary voice, \"Are\nyou ready for supper, Ramona?\" and Ramona was seen to come out and walk\nby the Senora's side to the dining-room; silent, to be sure,--but then\nthat was no strange thing, the Senorita always was more silent in the\nSenora's presence,--when Marda, standing in the court-yard, feigning to\nbe feeding her chickens, but keeping a close eye on the passage-ways,\nsaw this, she was relieved, and thought: \"It's only a dispute there has\nbeen. There will be disputes in families sometimes. It is none of our\naffair. All is settled now.\"\n\nAnd Margarita, standing in the dining-room, when she saw them all\ncoming in as usual,--the Senora, Felipe, Ramona,--no change, even to\nher scrutinizing eye, in anybody's face, was more surprised than she had\nbeen for many a day; and began to think again, as she had more than\nonce since this tragedy began, that she must have dreamed much that she\nremembered.\n\nBut surfaces are deceitful, and eyes see little. Considering its\ncomplexity, the fineness and delicacy of its mechanism, the results\nattainable by the human eye seem far from adequate to the expenditure\nput upon it. We have flattered ourselves by inventing proverbs of\ncomparison in matter of blindness,--\"blind as a bat,\" for instance. It\nwould be safe to say that there cannot be found in the animal kingdom\na bat, or any other creature, so blind in its own range of circumstance\nand connection, as the greater majority of human beings are in the\nbosoms of their families. Tempers strain and recover, hearts break and\nheal, strength falters, fails, and comes near to giving way altogether,\nevery day, without being noted by the closest lookers-on.\n\nBefore night of this second day since the trouble had burst like a\nstorm-cloud on the peaceful Moreno household, everything had so resumed\nthe ordinary expression and routine, that a shrewder observer and\nreasoner than Margarita might well be excused for doubting if any\nserious disaster could have occurred to any one. Senor Felipe sauntered\nabout in his usual fashion, smoking his cigarettes, or lay on his bed in\nthe veranda, dozing. The Senora went her usual rounds of inspection, fed\nher birds, spoke to every one in her usual tone, sat in her carved chair\nwith her hands folded, gazing out on the southern sky. Ramona busied\nherself with her usual duties, dusted the chapel, put fresh flowers\nbefore all the Madonnas, and then sat down at her embroidery. Ramona had\nbeen for a long time at work on a beautiful altar-cloth for the chapel.\nIt was to have been a present to the Senora. It was nearly done. As she\nheld up the frame in which it was stretched, and looked at the delicate\ntracery of the pattern, she sighed. It had been with a mingled feeling\nof interest and hopelessness that she had for months been at work on it,\noften saying to herself, \"She won't care much for it, beautiful as it\nis, just because I did it; but Father Salvierderra will be pleased when\nhe sees it.\"\n\nNow, as she wove the fine threads in and out, she thought: \"She will\nnever let it be used on the altar. I wonder if I could any way get it to\nFather Salvierderra, at Santa Barbara. I would like to give it to him.\nI will ask Alessandro. I'm sure the Senora would never use it, and it\nwould be a shame to leave it here. I shall take it with me.\" But as she\nthought these things, her face was unruffled. A strange composure had\nsettled on Ramona. \"Only four days; only four days; I can bear anything\nfor four days!\" these words were coming and going in her mind like\nrefrains of songs which haunt one's memory and will not be still. She\nsaw that Felipe looked anxiously at her, but she answered his inquiring\nlooks always with a gentle smile. It was evident that the Senora did\nnot intend that she and Felipe should have any private conversation;\nbut that did not so much matter. After all, there was not so much to be\nsaid. Felipe knew all. She could tell him nothing; Felipe had acted for\nthe best, as he thought, in sending Alessandro away till the heat of the\nSenora's anger should have spent itself.\n\nAfter her first dismay at suddenly learning that Alessandro had gone,\nhad passed, she had reflected that it was just as well. He would come\nback prepared to take her with him. How, or where, she did not know;\nbut she would go with no questions. Perhaps she would not even bid the\nSenora good-by; she wondered how that would arrange itself, and how far\nAlessandro would have to take her, to find a priest to marry them. It\nwas a terrible thing to have to do, to go out of a home in such a way:\nno wedding--no wedding clothes--no friends--to go unmarried, and journey\nto a priest's house, to have the ceremony performed; \"but it is not my\nfault,\" said Ramona to herself; \"it is hers. She drives me to do it. If\nit is wrong, the blame will be hers. Father Salvierderra would gladly\ncome here and marry us, if she would send for him. I wish we could go to\nhim, Alessandro and I; perhaps we can. I would not be afraid to ride so\nfar; we could do it in two days.\" The more Ramona thought of this, the\nmore it appeared to her the natural thing for them to do. \"He will be on\nour side, I know he will,\" she thought. \"He always liked Alessandro, and\nhe loves me.\"\n\nIt was strange how little bitterness toward the Senora was in the girl's\nmind; how comparatively little she thought of her. Her heart was too\nfull of Alessandro and of their future; and it had never been Ramona's\nhabit to dwell on the Senora in her thoughts. As from her childhood up\nshe had accepted the fact of the Senora's coldness toward her, so now\nshe accepted her injustice and opposition as part of the nature of\nthings, and not to be altered.\n\nDuring all these hours, during the coming and going of these crowds\nof fears, sorrows, memories, anticipations in Ramona's heart, all that\nthere was to be seen to the eye was simply a calm, quiet girl, sitting\non the veranda, diligently working at her lace-frame. Even Felipe was\ndeceived by her calmness, and wondered what it meant,--if it could be\nthat she was undergoing the change that his mother had thought possible,\nand designated as coming \"to her senses.\" Even Felipe did not know the\nsteadfast fibre of the girl's nature; neither did he realize what a bond\nhad grown between her and Alessandro. In fact, he sometimes wondered of\nwhat this bond had been made. He had himself seen the greater part\nof their intercourse with each other; nothing could have been farther\nremoved from anything like love-making. There had been no crisis\nof incident, or marked moments of experience such as in Felipe's\nimaginations of love were essential to the fulness of its growth. This\nis a common mistake on the part of those who have never felt love's true\nbonds. Once in those chains, one perceives that they are not of the sort\nfull forged in a day. They are made as the great iron cables are made,\non which bridges are swung across the widest water-channels,--not of\nsingle huge rods, or bars, which would be stronger, perhaps, to look\nat, but of myriads of the finest wires, each one by itself so fine, so\nfrail, it would barely hold a child's kite in the wind: by hundreds,\nhundreds of thousands of such, twisted, re-twisted together, are made\nthe mighty cables, which do not any more swerve from their place in the\nair, under the weight and jar of the ceaseless traffic and tread of two\ncities, than the solid earth swerves under the same ceaseless weight and\njar. Such cables do not break.\n\nEven Ramona herself would have found it hard to tell why she thus loved\nAlessandro; how it began, or by what it grew. It had not been a sudden\nadoration, like his passion for her; it was, in the beginning, simply\na response; but now it was as strong a love as his,--as strong, and as\nunchangeable. The Senora's harsh words had been like a forcing-house air\nto it, and the sudden knowledge of the fact of her own Indian descent\nseemed to her like a revelation, pointing out the path in which destiny\ncalled her to walk. She thrilled with pleasure at the thought of the joy\nwith which Alessandro would hear this,--the joy and the surprise. She\nimagined to herself, in hundreds of ways, the time, place, and phrase in\nwhich she would tell him. She could not satisfy herself as to the best;\nas to which would give keenest pleasure to him and to her. She would\ntell him, as soon as she saw him; it should be her first word of\ngreeting. No! There would be too much of trouble and embarrassment then.\nShe would wait till they were far away, till they were alone, in the\nwilderness; and then she would turn to him, and say, \"Alessandro, my\npeople are your people!\" Or she would wait, and keep her secret until\nshe had reached Temecula, and they had begun their life there, and\nAlessandro had been astonished to see how readily and kindly she took\nto all the ways of the Indian village; and then, when he expressed\nsome such emotion, she would quietly say, \"But I too am an Indian,\nAlessandro!\"\n\nStrange, sad bride's dreams these; but they made Ramona's heart beat\nwith happiness as she dreamed them.\n\n\n\n\nXIV\n\nTHE first day had gone, it was near night of the second, and not a word\nhad passed between Felipe and Ramona, except in the presence of the\nSenora. It would have been beautiful to see, if it had not been so cruel\na thing, the various and devious methods by which the Senora had brought\nthis about. Felipe, oddly enough, was more restive under it than Ramona.\nShe had her dreams. He had nothing but his restless consciousness that\nhe had not done for her what he hoped; that he must seem to her to have\nbeen disloyal; this, and a continual wonder what she could be planning\nor expecting which made her so placid, kept Felipe in a fever of unrest,\nof which his mother noted every sign, and redoubled her vigilance.\n\nFelipe thought perhaps he could speak to Ramona in the night, through\nher window. But the August heats were fierce now; everybody slept with\nwide-open windows; the Senora was always wakeful; if she should chance\nto hear him thus holding secret converse with Ramona, it would indeed\nmake bad matters worse. Nevertheless, he decided to try it. At the first\nsound of his footsteps on the veranda floor, \"My son, are you ill? Can I\ndo anything?\" came from the Senora's window. She had not been asleep at\nall. It would take more courage than Felipe possessed, to try that plan\nagain; and he lay on his veranda bed, this afternoon, tossing about with\nsheer impatience at his baffled purpose. Ramona sat at the foot of the\nbed, taking the last stitches in the nearly completed altar-cloth. The\nSenora sat in her usual seat, dozing, with her head thrown back. It\nwas very hot; a sultry south-wind, with dust from the desert, had been\nblowing all day, and every living creature was more or less prostrated\nby it.\n\nAs the Senora's eyes closed, a sudden thought struck Felipe. Taking\nout a memorandum-book in which he kept his accounts, he began rapidly\nwriting. Looking up, and catching Ramona's eye, he made a sign to her\nthat it was for her. She glanced apprehensively at the Senora. She was\nasleep. Presently Felipe, folding the note, and concealing it in his\nhand, rose, and walked towards Ramona's window, Ramona terrifiedly\nwatching him; the sound of Felipe's steps roused the Senora, who sat\nup instantly, and gazed about her with that indescribable expression\npeculiar to people who hope they have not been asleep, but know they\nhave. \"Have I been asleep?\" she asked.\n\n\"About one minute, mother,\" answered Felipe, who was leaning, as he\nspoke, against Ramona's open window, his arms crossed behind him.\nStretching them out, and back and forth a few times, yawning idly, he\nsaid, \"This heat is intolerable!\" Then he sauntered leisurely down the\nveranda steps into the garden-walk, and seated himself on the bench\nunder the trellis there.\n\nThe note had been thrown into Ramona's room. She was hot and cold with\nfear lest she might not be able to get it unobserved. What if the\nSenora were to go first into the room! She hardly dared look at her. But\nfortune is not always on the side of tyrants. The Senora was fast dozing\noff again, relieved that Felipe was out of speaking distance of Ramona.\nAs soon as her eyes were again shut, Ramona rose to go. The Senora\nopened her eyes. Ramona was crossing the threshold of the door; she was\ngoing into the house. Good! Still farther away from Felipe.\n\n\"Are you going to your room, Ramona?\" said the Senor.\n\n\"I was,\" replied Ramona, alarmed. \"Did you want me here?\"\n\n\"No,\" said the Senora; and she closed her eyes again.\n\nIn a second more the note was safe in Ramona's hands.\n\n\"Dear Ramona,\" Felipe had written, \"I am distracted because I cannot\nspeak with you alone. Can you think of any way? I want to explain things\nto you. I am afraid you do not understand. Don't be unhappy. Alessandro\nwill surely be back in four days. I want to help you all I can, but you\nsaw I could not do much. Nobody will hinder your doing what you please;\nbut, dear, I wish you would not go away from us!\"\n\nTearing the paper into small fragments, Ramona thrust them into her\nbosom, to be destroyed later. Then looking out of the window, and seeing\nthat the Senora was now in a sound sleep, she ventured to write a reply\nto Felipe, though when she would find a safe opportunity to give it to\nhim, there was no telling. \"Thank you, dear Felipe. Don't be anxious. I\nam not unhappy. I understand all about it. But I must go away as soon as\nAlessandro comes.\" Hiding this also safe in her bosom, she went back to\nthe veranda. Felipe rose, and walked toward the steps. Ramona, suddenly\nbold, stooped, and laid her note on the second step. Again the tired\neyes of the Senora opened. They had not been shut five minutes; Ramona\nwas at her work; Felipe was coming up the steps from the garden. He\nnodded laughingly to his mother, and laid his finger on his lips. All\nwas well. The Senora dozed again. Her nap had cost her more than she\nwould ever know. This one secret interchange between Felipe and Ramona\nthen, thus making, as it were, common cause with each other as against\nher, and in fear of her, was a step never to be recalled,--a step whose\nsignificance could scarcely be overestimated. Tyrants, great and\nsmall, are apt to overlook such possibilities as this; to forget the\nmomentousness which the most trivial incident may assume when forced\ninto false proportions and relations. Tyranny can make liars and cheats\nout of the honestest souls. It is done oftener than any except close\nstudents of human nature realize. When kings and emperors do this, the\nworld cries out with sympathy, and holds the plotters more innocent than\nthe tyrant who provoked the plot. It is Russia that stands branded in\nmen's thoughts, and not Siberia.\n\nThe Senora had a Siberia of her own, and it was there that Ramona was\nliving in these days. The Senora would have been surprised to know how\nlittle the girl felt the cold. To be sure, it was not as if she had ever\nfelt warmth in the Senora's presence; yet between the former chill and\nthis were many degrees, and except for her new life, and new love, and\nhope in the thought of Alessandro, Ramona could not have borne it for a\nday.\n\nThe fourth day came; it seemed strangely longer than the others had.\nAll day Ramona watched and listened. Felipe, too; for, knowing what\nAlessandro's impatience would be, he had, in truth, looked for him on\nthe previous night. The horse he rode was a fleet one, and would have\nmade the journey with ease in half the time. But Felipe reflected that\nthere might be many things for Alessandro to arrange at Temecula. He\nwould doubtless return prepared to take Ramona back with him, in case\nthat proved the only alternative left them. Felipe grew wretched as\nhis fancy dwelt on the picture of Ramona's future. He had been in the\nTemecula village. He knew its poverty; the thought of Ramona there was\nmonstrous, To the indolent, ease-loving Felipe it was incredible that a\ngirl reared as Ramona had been, could for a moment contemplate leading\nthe life of a poor laboring man's wife. He could not conceive of love's\nmaking one undertake any such life. Felipe had much to learn of love.\nNight came; no Alessandro. Till the darkness settled down, Ramona sat,\nwatching the willows. When she could no longer see, she listened. The\nSenora, noting all, also listened. She was uneasy as to the next stage\nof affairs, but she would not speak. Nothing should induce her to swerve\nfrom the line of conduct on which she had determined. It was the full of\nthe moon. When the first broad beam of its light came over the hill, and\nflooded the garden and the white front of the little chapel, just as it\nhad done on that first night when Alessandro watched with Felipe on the\nveranda, Ramona pressed her face against the window-panes, and gazed out\ninto the garden. At each flickering, motion of the shadows she saw the\nform of a man approaching. Again and again she saw it. Again and again\nthe breeze died, and the shadow ceased. It was near morning before,\nweary, sad, she crept to bed; but not to sleep. With wide-open, anxious\neyes, she still watched and listened. Never had the thought once crossed\nher mind that Alessandro might not come at the time Felipe had said. In\nher childlike simplicity she had accepted this as unquestioningly as\nshe had accepted other facts in her life. Now that he did not come,\nunreasoning and unfounded terror took possession of her, and she asked\nherself continually, \"Will he ever come! They sent him away; perhaps he\nwill be too proud to come back!\" Then faith would return, and saying to\nherself, \"He would never, never forsake me; he knows I have no one in\nthe whole world but him; he knows how I love him,\" she would regain\ncomposure, and remind herself of the many detentions which might have\nprevented his coming at the time set. Spite of all, however, she was\nheavy at heart; and at breakfast her anxious eyes and absent look were\nsad to see. They hurt Felipe. Too well he knew what it meant. He also\nwas anxious. The Senora saw it in his face, and it vexed her. The girl\nmight well pine, and be mortified if her lover did not appear. But why\nshould Felipe disquiet himself? The Senora disliked it. It was a bad\nsymptom. There might be trouble ahead yet. There was, indeed, trouble\nahead,--of a sort the Senora's imaginings had not pictured.\n\nAnother day passed; another night; another, and another. One week now\nsince Alessandro, as he leaped on his horse, had grasped Felipe's hand,\nand said: \"You will tell the Senorita; you will make sure that she\nunderstands why I go; and in four days I will be back.\" One week, and he\nhad not come. The three who were watching and wondering looked covertly\ninto each other's faces, each longing to know what the others thought.\n\nRamona was wan and haggard. She had scarcely slept. The idea had taken\npossession of her that Alessandro was dead. On the sixth and seventh\ndays she had walked each afternoon far down the river road, by which he\nwould be sure to come; down the meadows, and by the cross-cut, out\nto the highway; at each step straining her tearful eyes into the\ndistance,--the cruel, blank, silent distance. She had come back\nafter dark, whiter and more wan than she went out. As she sat at the\nsupper-table, silent, making no feint of eating, only drinking glass\nafter glass of milk, in thirsty haste, even Margarita pitied her. But\nthe Senora did not. She thought the best thing which could happen, would\nbe that the Indian should never come back. Ramona would recover from it\nin a little while; the mortification would be the worst thing, but even\nthat, time would heal. She wondered that the girl had not more pride\nthan to let her wretchedness be so plainly seen. She herself would have\ndied before she would go about with such a woe-begone face, for a whole\nhousehold to see and gossip about.\n\nOn the morning of the eighth day, Ramona, desperate, waylaid Felipe, as\nhe was going down the veranda steps. The Senora was in the garden, and\nsaw them; but Ramona did not care. \"Felipe!\" she cried, \"I must, I must\nspeak to you! Do you think Alessandro is dead? What else could keep him\nfrom coming?\" Her lips were dry, her cheeks scarlet, her voice husky.\nA few more days of this, and she would be in a brain fever, Felipe\nthought, as he looked compassionately at her.\n\n\"Oh, no, no, dear! Do not think that!\" he replied. \"A thousand things\nmight have kept him.\"\n\n\"Ten thousand things would not! Nothing could!\" said Ramona. \"I know he\nis dead. Can't you send a messenger, Felipe, and see?\"\n\nThe Senora was walking toward them. She overheard the last words.\nLooking toward Felipe, no more regarding Ramona than if she had not been\nwithin sight or hearing, the Senora said, \"It seems to me that would not\nbe quite consistent with dignity. How does it strike you, Felipe' If\nyou thought best, we might spare a man as soon as the vintage is done, I\nsuppose.\"\n\nRamona walked away. The vintage would not be over for a week. There\nwere several vineyards yet which had not been touched; every hand on the\nplace was hard at work, picking the grapes, treading them out in tubs,\nemptying the juice into stretched raw-hides swung from cross-beams in\na long shed. In the willow copse the brandy-still was in full blast; it\ntook one man to watch it; this was Juan Can's favorite work; for reasons\nof his own he liked best to do it alone; and now that he could no longer\ntread grapes in the tubs, he had a better chance for uninterrupted work\nat the still. \"No ill but has its good,\" he thought sometimes, as he lay\ncomfortably stretched out in the shade, smoking his pipe day after day,\nand breathing the fumes of the fiery brandy.\n\nAs Ramona disappeared in the doorway, the Senora, coming close to\nFelipe, and laying her hand on his arm, said in a confidential tone,\nnodding her head in the direction in which Ramona had vanished: \"She\nlooks badly, Felipe. I don't know what we can do. We surely cannot send\nto summon back a lover we do not wish her to marry, can we? It is very\nperplexing. Most unfortunate, every way. What do you think, my son?\"\nThere was almost a diabolical art in the manner in which the Senora\ncould, by a single phrase or question, plant in a person's mind the\nprecise idea she wished him to think he had originated himself.\n\n\"No; of course we can't send for him,\" replied Felipe, angrily; \"unless\nit is to send him to marry her; I wish he had never set foot on the\nplace. I am sure I don't know what to do. Ramona's looks frighten me. I\nbelieve she will die.\"\n\n\"I cannot wish Alessandro had never set foot on the place,\" said the\nSenora, gently, \"for I feel that I owe your life to him, my Felipe; and\nhe is not to blame for Ramona's conduct. You need not fear her dying,\nShe may be ill; but people do not die of love like hers for Alessandro.\"\n\n\"Of what kind do they die, mother?\" asked Felipe, impatiently.\n\nThe Senora looked reproachfully at him. \"Not often of any,\" she said;\n\"but certainly not of a sudden passion for a person in every way beneath\nthem, in position, in education, in all points which are essential to\ncongeniality of tastes or association of life.\"\n\nThe Senora spoke calmly, with no excitement, as if she were discussing\nan abstract case. Sometimes, when she spoke like this, Felipe for\nthe moment felt as if she were entirely right, as if it were really a\ndisgraceful thing in Ramona to have thus loved Alessandro. It could not\nbe gainsaid that there was this gulf, of which she spoke. Alessandro was\nundeniably Ramona's inferior in position, education, in all the external\nmatters of life; but in nature, in true nobility of soul, no! Alessandro\nwas no man's inferior in these; and in capacity to love,--Felipe\nsometimes wondered whether he had ever known Alessandro's equal in that.\nThis thought had occurred to him more than once, as from his sick-bed he\nhad, unobserved, studied the expression with which Alessandro gazed at\nRamona. But all this made no difference in the perplexity of the present\ndilemma, in the embarrassment of his and his mother's position now. Send\na messenger to ask why Alessandro did not return! Not even if he had\nbeen an accepted and publicly recognized lover, would Felipe do that!\nRamona ought to have more pride. She ought of herself to know that. And\nwhen Felipe, later in the day, saw Ramona again, he said as much to her.\nHe said it as gently as he could; so gently that she did not at first\ncomprehend his idea. It was so foreign, so incompatible with her faith,\nhow could she?\n\nWhen she did understand, she said slowly: \"You mean that it will not do\nto send to find out if Alessandro is dead, because it will look as if I\nwished him to marry me whether he wished it or not?\" and she fixed her\neyes on Felipe's, with an expression he could not fathom.\n\n\"Yes, dear,\" he answered, \"something like that, though you put it\nharshly.\"\n\n\"Is it not true,\" she persisted, \"that is what you mean?\"\n\nReluctantly Felipe admitted that it was.\n\nRamona was silent for some moments; then she said, speaking still\nmore slowly, \"If you feel like that, we had better never talk about\nAlessandro again. I suppose it is not possible that you should know, as\nI do, that nothing but his being dead would keep him from coming\nback. Thanks, dear Felipe;\" and after this she did not speak again of\nAlessandro.\n\nDays went by; a week. The vintage was over. The Senora wondered if\nRamona would now ask again for a messenger to go to Temecula. Almost\neven the Senora relented, as she looked into the girl's white and wasted\nface, as she sat silent, her hands folded in her lap, her eyes fixed on\nthe willows. The altar-cloth was done, folded and laid away. It would\nnever hang in the Moreno chapel. It was promised, in Ramona's mind, to\nFather Salvierderra. She had resolved to go to him; if he, a feeble old\nman, could walk all the way between Santa Barbara and their home, she\ncould surely do the same. She would not lose the way. There were not\nmany roads; she could ask. The convent, the bare thought of which\nhad been so terrible to Ramona fourteen days ago, when the Senora had\nthreatened her with it, now seemed a heavenly refuge, the only shelter\nshe craved. There was a school for orphans attached to the convent at\nSan Juan Bautista, she knew; she would ask the Father to let her go\nthere, and she would spend the rest of her life in prayer, and in\nteaching the orphan girls. As hour after hour she sat revolving this\nplan, her fancy projected itself so vividly into the future, that she\nlived years of her life. She felt herself middle-aged, old. She saw the\nprocession of nuns, going to vespers, leading the children by the hand;\nherself wrinkled and white-haired, walking between two of the little\nones. The picture gave her peace. As soon as she grew a little stronger,\nshe would set off on her journey to the Father; she could not go just\nyet, she was too weak; her feet trembled if she did but walk to the foot\nof the garden. Alessandro was dead; there could be no doubt of that.\nHe was buried in that little walled graveyard of which he had told\nher. Sometimes she thought she would try to go there and see his grave,\nperhaps see his father; if Alessandro had told him of her, the old man\nwould be glad to see her; perhaps, after all, her work might lie there,\namong Alessandro's people. But this looked hard: she had not courage for\nit; shelter and rest were what she wanted,--the sound of the Church's\nprayers, and the Father's blessing every day. The convent was the best.\n\nShe thought she was sure that Alessandro was dead; but she was not, for\nshe still listened, still watched. Each day she walked out on the river\nroad, and sat waiting till dusk. At last came a day when she could not\ngo; her strength failed her. She lay all day on her bed. To the Senora,\nwho asked frigidly if she were ill, she answered: \"No, Senora, I do not\nthink I am ill, I have no pain, but I cannot get up. I shall be better\nto-morrow.\"\n\n\"I will send you strong broth and a medicine,\" the Senora said; and sent\nher both by the hands of Margarita, whose hatred and jealousy broke down\nat the first sight of Ramona's face on the pillow; it looked so much\nthinner and sharper there than it had when she was sitting up. \"Oh,\nSenorita! Senorita!\" she cried, in a tone of poignant grief, \"are you\ngoing to die? Forgive me, forgive me!\"\n\n\"I have nothing to forgive you, Margarita,\" replied Ramona, raising\nherself on her elbow, and lifting her eyes kindly to the girl's face\nas she took the broth from her hands. \"I do not know why you ask me to\nforgive you.\"\n\nMargarita flung herself on her knees by the bed, in a passion of\nweeping. \"Oh, but you do know, Senorita, you do know! Forgive me!\"\n\n\"No, I know nothing,\" replied Ramona; \"but if you know anything, it is\nall forgiven. I am not going to die, Margarita. I am going away,\" she\nadded, after a second's pause. Her inmost instinct told her that she\ncould trust Margarita now. Alessandro being dead, Margarita would no\nlonger be her enemy, and Margarita could perhaps help her. \"I am going\naway, Margarita, as soon as I feel a little stronger. I am going to a\nconvent; but the Senora does not know. You will not tell?\"\n\n\"No, Senorita!\" whispered Margarita,--thinking in her heart, \"Yes, she\nis going away, but it will be with the angels.\"--\"No, Senorita, I will\nnot tell. I will do anything you want me to.\"\n\n\"Thanks, Margarita mia,\" replied Ramona. \"I thought you would;\" and she\nlay back on her pillow, and closed her eyes, looking so much more like\ndeath than like life that Margarita's tears flowed faster than before,\nand she ran to her mother, sobbing out, \"Mother, mother! the Senorita is\nill to death. I am sure she is. She has taken to her bed; and she is as\nwhite as Senor Felipe was at the worst of the fever.\"\n\n\"Ay,\" said old Marda, who had seen all this for days back; \"ay, she has\nwasted away, this last week, like one in a fever, sure enough; I have\nseen it. It must be she is starving herself to death.\"\n\n\"Indeed, she has not eaten for ten days,--hardly since that day;\"\nand Margarita and her mother exchanged looks. It was not necessary to\nfurther define the day.\n\n\"Juan Can says he thinks he will never be seen here again,\" continued\nMargarita.\n\n\"The saints grant it, then,\" said Marda, hotly, \"if it is he has cost\nthe Senorita all this! I am that turned about in my head with it all,\nthat I've no thoughts to think; but plain enough it is, he is mixed up\nwith whatever 'tis has gone wrong.\"\n\n\"I could tell what it is,\" said Margarita, her old pertness coming\nuppermost for a moment; \"but I've got no more to say, now the Senorita's\nlying on her bed, with the face she's got. It's enough to break your\nheart to look at her. I could just go down on my knees to her for all\nI've said; and I will, and to Saint Francis too! She's going to be with\nhim before long; I know she is.\"\n\n\"No,\" said the wiser, older Marda. \"She is not so ill as you think. She\nis young. It's the heart's gone out of her; that's all. I've been that\nway myself. People are, when they're young.\"\n\n\"I'm young!\" retorted Margarita. \"I've never been that way.\"\n\n\"There's many a mile to the end of the road, my girl,\" said Marda,\nsignificantly; \"and 'It's ill boasting the first day out,' was a proverb\nwhen I was your age!\"\n\nMarda had never been much more than half-way fond of this own child\nof hers. Their natures were antagonistic. Traits which, in Margarita's\nfather, had embittered many a day of Marda's early married life, were\nperpetually cropping out in Margarita, making between the mother and\ndaughter a barrier which even parental love was not always strong enough\nto surmount. And, as was inevitable, this antagonism was constantly\nleading to things which seemed to Margarita, and in fact were, unjust\nand ill-founded.\n\n\"She's always flinging out at me, whatever I do,\" thought Margarita.\n\"I know one thing; I'll never tell her what the Senorita's told me;\nnever,--not till after she's gone.\"\n\nA sudden suspicion flashed into Margarita's mind. She seated herself on\nthe bench outside the kitchen door, to wrestle with it. What if it were\nnot to a convent at all, but to Alessandro, that the Senorita meant to\ngo! No; that was preposterous. If it had been that, she would have gone\nwith him in the outset. Nobody who was plotting to run away with a lover\never wore such a look as the Senorita wore now. Margarita dismissed the\nthought; yet it left its trace. She would be more observant for having\nhad it; her resuscitated affection far her young mistress was not yet\nso strong that it would resist the assaults of jealousy, if that passion\nwere to be again aroused in her fiery soul. Though she had never been\ndeeply in love with Alessandro herself, she had been enough so, and\nshe remembered him vividly enough, to feel yet a sharp emotion of\ndispleasure at the recollection of his devotion to the Senorita. Now\nthat the Senorita seemed to be deserted, unhappy, prostrated, she had no\nroom for anything but pity for her; but let Alessandro come on the stage\nagain, and all would be changed. The old hostility would return. It was\nbut a dubious sort of ally, after all, that Ramona had so unexpectedly\nsecured in Margarita. She might prove the sharpest of broken reeds.\n\nIt was sunset of the eighteenth day since Alessandro's departure. Ramona\nhad lain for four days well-nigh motionless on her bed. She herself\nbegan to think she must be going to die. Her mind seemed to be vacant of\nall thought. She did not even sorrow for Alessandro's death; she seemed\ntorpid, body and soul. Such prostrations as these are Nature's enforced\nrests. It is often only by help of them that our bodies tide over\ncrises, strains, in which, if we continued to battle, we should be\nslain.\n\nAs Ramona lay half unconscious,--neither awake nor yet asleep,--on this\nevening, she was suddenly aware of a vivid impression produced upon her;\nit was not sound, it was not sight. She was alone; the house was still\nas death; the warm September twilight silence reigned outside, She sat\nup in her bed, intent--half alarmed--half glad--bewildered--alive. What\nhad happened? Still there was no sound, no stir. The twilight was fast\ndeepening; not a breath of air moving. Gradually her bewildered senses\nand faculties awoke from their long-dormant condition; she looked around\nthe room; even the walls seemed revivified; she clasped her hands, and\nleaped from the bed. \"Alessandro is not dead!\" she said aloud; and she\nlaughed hysterically. \"He is not dead!\" she repeated. \"He is not dead!\nHe is somewhere near!\"\n\nWith quivering hands she dressed, and stole out of the house. After\nthe first few seconds she found herself strangely strong; she did not\ntremble; her feet trod firm on the ground. \"Oh, miracle!\" she thought,\nas she hastened down the garden-walk; \"I am well again! Alessandro is\nnear!\" So vivid was the impression, that when she reached the willows\nand found the spot silent, vacant, as when she had last sat there,\nhopeless, broken-hearted, she experienced a revulsion of disappointment.\n\"Not here!\" she cried; \"not here!\" and a swift fear shook her. \"Am I\nmad? Is it this way, perhaps, people lose their senses, when they are as\nI have been!\"\n\nBut the young, strong blood was running swift in her veins. No! this\nwas no madness; rather a newly discovered power; a fulness of sense; a\nrevelation. Alessandro was near.\n\nSwiftly she walked down the river road. The farther she went, the keener\ngrew her expectation, her sense of Alessandro's nearness. In her present\nmood she would have walked on and on, even to Temecula itself, sure that\nshe was at each step drawing nearer to Alessandro.\n\nAs she approached the second willow copse, which lay perhaps a quarter\nof a mile west of the first, she saw the figure of a man, standing,\nleaning against one of the trees. She halted. It could not be\nAlessandro. He would not have paused for a moment so near the house\nwhere he was to find her. She was afraid to go on. It was late to meet\na stranger in this lonely spot. The figure was strangely still; so still\nthat, as she peered through the dusk, she half fancied it might be an\noptical illusion. She advanced a few steps, hesitatingly, then stopped.\nAs she did so, the man advanced a few steps, then stopped. As he came\nout from the shadows of the trees, she saw that he was of Alessandro's\nheight. She quickened her steps, then suddenly stopped again. What did\nthis mean? It could not be Alessandro. Ramona wrung her hands in agony\nof suspense. An almost unconquerable instinct urged her forward; but\nterror held her back. After standing irresolute for some minutes, she\nturned to walk back to the house, saying, \"I must not run the risk of\nits being a stranger. If it is Alessandro, he will come.\"\n\nBut her feet seemed to refuse to move in the opposite direction. Slower\nand slower she walked for a few paces, then turned again. The man had\nreturned to his former place, and stood as at first, leaning against the\ntree.\n\n\"It may be a messenger from him,\" she said; \"a messenger who has been\ntold not to come to the house until after dark.\"\n\nHer mind was made up. She quickened her pace to a run. A few moments\nmore brought her so near that she could see distinctly. It was--yes, it\nwas Alessandro. He did not see her. His face was turned partially away,\nhis head resting against the tree; he must be ill. Ramona flew, rather\nthan ran. In a moment more, Alessandro had heard the light steps,\nturned, saw Ramona, and, with a cry, bounded forward, and they were\nclasped in each other's arms before they had looked in each other's\nfaces. Ramona spoke first. Disengaging herself gently, and looking\nup, she began: \"Alessandro--\" But at the first sight of his face she\nshrieked. Was this Alessandro, this haggard, emaciated, speechless man,\nwho gazed at her with hollow eyes, full of misery, and no joy! \"O God,\"\ncried Ramona, \"You have been ill! you are ill! My God, Alessandro, what\nis it?\"\n\nAlessandro passed his hand slowly over his forehead, as if trying to\ncollect his thoughts before speaking, all the while keeping his eyes\nfixed on Ramona, with the same anguished look, convulsively holding both\nher hands in his.\n\n\"Senorita,\" he said, \"my Senorita!\" Then he stopped. His tongue seemed\nto refuse him utterance; and this voice,--this strange, hard, unresonant\nvoice,--whose voice was it? Not Alessandro's.\n\n\"My Senorita,\" he began again, \"I could not go without one sight of your\nface; but when I was here, I had not courage to go near the house. If\nyou had not come, I should have gone back without seeing you.\"\n\nRamona heard these words in fast-deepening terror, What did they mean?\nHer look seemed to suggest a new thought to Alessandro.\n\n\"Heavens, Senorita!\" he cried, \"have you not heard? Do you not know what\nhas happened?\"\n\n\"I know nothing, love,\" answered Ramona. \"I have heard nothing since\nyou went away. For ten days I have been sure you were dead; but to-night\nsomething told me that you were near, and I came to meet you.\"\n\nAt the first words of Ramona's sentence, Alessandro threw his arms\naround her again. As she said \"love,\" his whole frame shook with\nemotion.\n\n\"My Senorita!\" he whispered, \"my Senorita! how shall I tell you! How\nshall I tell you!\"\n\n\"What is there to tell, Alessandro?\" she said. \"I am afraid of nothing,\nnow that you are here, and not dead, as I thought.\"\n\nBut Alessandro did not speak. It seemed impossible. At last, straining\nher closer to his breast, he cried: \"Dearest Senorita! I feel as if\nI should die when I tell you,--I have no home; my father is dead;\nmy people are driven out of their village. I am only a beggar now,\nSenorita; like those you used to feed and pity in Los Angeles convent!\"\nAs he spoke the last words, he reeled, and, supporting himself against\nthe tree, added: \"I am not strong, Senorita; we have been starving.\"\n\nRamona's face did not reassure him. Even in the dusk he could see its\nlook of incredulous horror. He misread it.\n\n\"I only came to look at you once more,\" he continued. \"I will go now.\nMay the saints bless you, my Senorita, always. I think the Virgin sent\nyou to me to-night. I should never have seen your face if you had not\ncome.\"\n\nWhile he was speaking, Ramona had buried her face in his bosom. Lifting\nit now, she said, \"Did you mean to leave me to think you were dead,\nAlessandro?\"\n\n\"I thought that the news about our village must have reached you,\" he\nsaid, \"and that you would know I had no home, and could not come, to\nseem to remind you of what you had said. Oh, Senorita, it was little\nenough I had before to give you! I don't know how I dared to believe\nthat you could come to be with me; but I loved you so much, I had\nthought of many things I could do; and--\" lowering his voice and\nspeaking almost sullenly--\"it is the saints, I believe, who have\npunished me thus for having resolved to leave my people, and take all I\nhad for myself and you. Now they have left me nothing;\" and he groaned.\n\n\"Who?\" cried Ramona. \"Was there a battle? Was your father killed?\" She\nwas trembling with horror.\n\n\"No,\" answered Alessandro. \"There was no battle. There would have been,\nif I had had my way; but my father implored me not to resist. He said it\nwould only make it worse for us in the end. The sheriff, too, he begged\nme to let it all go on peaceably, and help him keep the people quiet. He\nfelt terribly to have to do it. It was Mr. Rothsaker, from San Diego. We\nhad often worked for him on his ranch. He knew all about us. Don't you\nrecollect, Senorita, I told you about him,--how fair he always was, and\nkind too? He has the biggest wheat-ranch in Cajon; we've harvested miles\nand miles of wheat for him. He said he would have rather died, almost,\nthan have had it to do; but if we resisted, he would have to order his\nmen to shoot. He had twenty men with him. They thought there would be\ntrouble; and well they might,--turning a whole village full of men and\nwomen and children out of their houses, and driving them off like foxes.\nIf it had been any man but Mr. Rothsaker, I would have shot him dead,\nif I had hung for it; but I knew if he thought we must go, there was no\nhelp for us.\"\n\n\"But, Alessandro,\" interrupted Ramona, \"I can't understand. Who was it\nmade Mr. Rothsaker do it? Who has the land now?\"\n\n\"I don't know who they are,\" Alessandro replied, his voice full of\nanger and scorn. \"They're Americans--eight or ten of them. They all got\ntogether and brought a suit, they call it, up in San Francisco; and it\nwas decided in the court that they owned all our land. That was all Mr.\nRothsaker could tell about it. It was the law, he said, and nobody could\ngo against the law.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" said Ramona, \"that's the way the Americans took so much of the\nSenora's land away from her. It was in the court up in San Francisco;\nand they decided that miles and miles of her land, which the General\nhad always had, was not hers at all. They said it belonged to the United\nStates Government.\"\n\n\"They are a pack of thieves and liars, every one of them!\" cried\nAlessandro. \"They are going to steal all the land in this country; we\nmight all just as well throw ourselves into the sea, and let them have\nit. My father had been telling me this for years. He saw it coming; but\nI did not believe him. I did not think men could be so wicked; but he\nwas right. I am glad he is dead. That is the only thing I have to be\nthankful for now. One day I thought he was going to get well, and I\nprayed to the Virgin not to let him. I did not want him to live. He\nnever knew anything clear after they took him out of his house. That was\nbefore I got there. I found him sitting on the ground outside. They said\nit was the sun that had turned him crazy; but it was not. It was his\nheart breaking in his bosom. He would not come out of his house, and\nthe men lifted him up and carried him out by force, and threw him on the\nground; and then they threw out all the furniture we had; and when he\nsaw them doing that, he put his hands up to his head, and called out,\n'Alessandro! Alessandro!' and I was not there! Senorita, they said it\nwas a voice to make the dead hear, that he called with; and nobody\ncould stop him. All that day and all the night he kept on calling. God!\nSenorita, I wonder I did not die when they told me! When I got there,\nsome one had built up a little booth of tule over his head, to keep the\nsun off. He did not call any more, only for water, water. That was what\nmade them think the sun had done it. They did all they could; but it was\nsuch a dreadful time, nobody could do much; the sheriff's men were in\ngreat hurry; they gave no time. They said the people must all be off in\ntwo days. Everybody was running hither and thither. Everything out of\nthe houses in piles on the ground. The people took all the roofs off\ntheir houses too. They were made of the tule reeds; so they would do\nagain. Oh, Senorita, don't ask me to tell you any more! It is like\ndeath. I can't!\"\n\nRamona was crying bitterly. She did not know what to say. What was love,\nin face of such calamity? What had she to give to a man stricken like\nthis.'\n\n\"Don't weep, Senorita,\" said Alessandro, drearily. \"Tears kill one, and\ndo no good.\"\n\n\"How long did your father live?\" asked Ramona, clasping her arms closer\naround his neck. They were sitting on the ground now, and Ramona,\nyearning over Alessandro, as if she were the strong one and he the one\nto be sheltered, had drawn his head to her bosom, caressing him as if\nhe had been hers for years. Nothing could have so clearly shown his\nenfeebled and benumbed condition, as the manner in which he received\nthese caresses, which once would have made him beside himself with joy.\nHe leaned against her breast as a child might.\n\n\"He! He died only four days ago. I stayed to bury him, and then I came\naway. I have been three days on the way; the horse, poor beast, is\nalmost weaker than I. The Americans took my horse,\" Alessandro said.\n\n\"Took your horse!\" cried Ramona, aghast. \"Is that the law, too?\"\n\n\"So Mr. Rothsaker told me. He said the judge had said he must take\nenough of our cattle and horses to pay all it had cost for the suit up\nin San Francisco. They didn't reckon the cattle at what they were worth,\nI thought; but they said cattle were selling very low now. There were\nnot enough in all the village to pay it, so we had to make it up in\nhorses; and they took mine. I was not there the day they drove the\ncattle away, or I would have put a ball into Benito's head before any\nAmerican should ever have had him to ride. But I was over in Pachanga\nwith my father. He would not stir a step for anybody but me; so I led\nhim all the way; and then after he got there he was so ill I never left\nhim a minute. He did not know me any more, nor know anything that had\nhappened. I built a little hut of tule, and he lay on the ground till he\ndied. When I put him in his grave, I was glad.\"\n\n\"In Temecula?\" asked Ramona.\n\n\"In Temecula.\" exclaimed Alessandro, fiercely. \"You don't seem to\nunderstand, Senorita. We have no right in Temecula, not even to our\ngraveyard full of the dead. Mr. Rothsaker warned us all not to be\nhanging about there; for he said the men who were coming in were a\nrough set, and they would shoot any Indian at sight, if they saw him\ntrespassing on their property.\"\n\n\"Their property!\" ejaculated Ramona.\n\n\"Yes; it is theirs,\" said Alessandro, doggedly. \"That is the law.\nThey've got all the papers to show it. That is what my father always\nsaid,--if the Senor Valdez had only given him a paper! But they never\ndid in those days. Nobody had papers. The American law is different.\"\n\n\"It's a law of thieves!\" cried Ramona.\n\n\"Yes, and of murderers too,\" said Alessandro. \"Don't you call my father\nmurdered just as much as if they had shot him? I do! and, O Senorita,\nmy Senorita, there was Jose! You recollect Jose, who went for my violin?\nBut, my beloved one, I am killing you with these terrible things! I will\nspeak no more.\"\n\n\"No, no, Alessandro. Tell me all, all. You must have no grief I do not\nshare. Tell me about Jose,\" cried Ramona, breathlessly.\n\n\"Senorita, it will break your heart to hear. Jose was married a year\nago. He had the best house in Temecula, next to my father's. It was the\nonly other one that had a shingled roof. And he had a barn too, and that\nsplendid horse he rode, and oxen, and a flock of sheep. He was at home\nwhen the sheriff came. A great many of the men were away, grapepicking.\nThat made it worse. But Jose was at home; for his wife had a little baby\nonly a few weeks old, and the child seemed sickly and not like to live,\nand Jose would not leave it. Jose was the first one that saw the sheriff\nriding into the village, and the band of armed men behind him, and Jose\nknew what it meant. He had often talked it over with me and with my\nfather, and now he saw that it had come; and he went crazy in one\nminute, and fell on the ground all froth at his mouth. He had had a fit\nlike that once before; and the doctor said if he had another, he would\ndie. But he did not. They picked him up, and presently he was better;\nand Mr. Rothsaker said nobody worked so well in the moving the first\nday as Jose did. Most of the men would not lift a hand. They sat on the\nground with the women, and covered up their faces, and would not see.\nBut Jose worked; and, Senorita, one of the first things he did, was to\nrun with my father's violin to the store, to Mrs. Hartsel, and ask her\nto hide it for us; Jose knew it was worth money. But before noon the\nsecond day he had another fit, and died in it,--died right in his own\ndoor, carrying out some of the things; and after Carmena--that's his\nwife's name--saw he was dead, she never spoke, but sat rocking back\nand forth on the ground, with the baby in her arms. She went over to\nPachanga at the same time I did with my father. It was a long procession\nof us.\"\n\n\"Where is Pachanga?\" asked Ramona.\n\n\"About three miles from Temecula, a little sort of canon. I told\nthe people they'd better move over there; the land did not belong to\nanybody, and perhaps they could make a living there. There isn't any\nwater; that's the worst of it.\"\n\n\"No water!\" cried Ramona.\n\n\"No running water. There is one little spring, and they dug a well by it\nas soon as they got there; so there was water to drink, but that is all.\nI saw Carmena could hardly keep up, and I carried the baby for her on\none arm, while I led my father with the other hand; but the baby cried,\nso she took it back. I thought then it wouldn't live the day out; but\nit did live till the morning of the day my father died. Just a few hours\nbefore he died, Carmena came along with the baby rolled up in her shawl,\nand sat down by me on the ground, and did not speak. When I said, 'How\nis the little one?' she opened her shawl and showed it to me, dead.\n'Good, Carmena!' said I. 'It is good! My father is dying too. We will\nbury them together.' So she sat by me all that morning, and at night\nshe helped me dig the graves. I wanted to put the baby on my father's\nbreast; but she said, no, it must have a little grave. So she dug it\nherself; and we put them in; and she never spoke, except that once. She\nwas sitting there by the grave when I came away. I made a cross of two\nlittle trees with the boughs chopped off, and set it up by the graves.\nSo that is the way our new graveyard was begun,--my father and the\nlittle baby; it is the very young and the very old that have the blessed\nfortune to die. I cannot die, it seems!\"\n\n\"Where did they bury Jose?\" gasped Ramona.\n\n\"In Temecula,\" said Alessandro. \"Mr. Rothsaker made two of his men dig\na grave in our old graveyard for Jose. But I think Carmena will go at\nnight and bring his body away. I would! But, my Senorita, it is very\ndark, I can hardly see your beloved eyes. I think you must not stay\nlonger. Can I go as far as the brook with you, safely, without being\nseen? The saints bless you, beloved, for coming. I could not have lived,\nI think, without one more sight of your face;\" and, springing to his\nfeet, Alessandro stood waiting for Ramona to move. She remained\nstill. She was in a sore strait. Her heart held but one impulse, one\ndesire,--to go with Alessandro; nothing was apparently farther from\nhis thoughts than this. Could she offer to go? Should she risk laying a\nburden on him greater than he could bear? If he were indeed a beggar, as\nhe said, would his life be hindered or helped by her? She felt herself\nstrong and able. Work had no terrors for her; privations she knew\nnothing of, but she felt no fear of them.\n\n\"Alessandro!\" she said, in a tone which startled him.\n\n\"My Senorita!\" he said tenderly.\n\n\"You have never once called me Ramona.\"\n\n\"I cannot, Senorita!\" he replied.\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"I do not know. I sometimes think 'Ramona,'\" he added faintly; \"but not\noften. If I think of you by any other name than as my Senorita, it is\nusually by a name you never heard.\"\n\n\"What is it?\" exclaimed Ramona, wonderingly.\n\n\"An Indian word, my dearest one, the name of the bird you are like,--the\nwood-dove. In the Luiseno tongue that is Majel; that was what I thought\nmy people would have called you, if you had come to dwell among us. It\nis a beautiful name, Senorita, and is like you.\"\n\nAlessandro was still standing. Ramona rose; coming close to him, she\nlaid both her hands on his breast, and her head on her hands, and said:\n\"Alessandro, I have something to tell you. I am an Indian. I belong to\nyour people.\"\n\nAlessandro's silence astonished her. \"You are surprised,\" she said. \"I\nthought you would be glad.\"\n\n\"The gladness of it came to me long ago, my Senorita,\" he said. \"I knew\nit!\"\n\n\"How?\" cried Ramona. \"And you never told me, Alessandro!\"\n\n\"How could I?\" he replied. \"I dared not. Juan Canito, it was told me.\"\n\n\"Juan Canito!\" said Ramona, musingly. \"How could he have known?\" Then in\na few rapid words she told Alessandro all that the Senora had told her.\n\"Is that what Juan Can said?\" she asked.\n\n\"All except the father's name,\" stammered Alessandro.\n\n\"Who did he say was my father?\" she asked.\n\nAlessandro was silent.\n\n\"It matters not,\" said Ramona. \"He was wrong. The Senora, of course,\nknew. He was a friend of hers, and of the Senora Ortegna, to whom he\ngave me. But I think, Alessandro, I have more of my mother than of my\nfather.\"\n\n\"Yes, you have, my Senorita,\" replied Alessandro, tenderly. \"After I\nknew it, I then saw what it was in your face had always seemed to me\nlike the faces of my own people.\"\n\n\"Are you not glad, Alessandro?\"\n\n\"Yes, my Senorita.\"\n\nWhat more should Ramona say? Suddenly her heart gave way; and without\npremeditation, without resolve, almost without consciousness of what\nshe was doing, she flung herself on Alessandro's breast, and cried: \"Oh,\nAlessandro, take me with you! take me with you! I would rather die than\nhave you leave me again!\"\n\n\n\n\nXV\n\nALESSANDRO'S first answer to this cry of Ramona's was a tightening of\nhis arms around her; closer and closer he held her, till it was almost\npain; she could hear the throbs of his heart, but he did not speak.\nThen, letting his arms fall, taking her hand in his, he laid it on\nhis forehead reverently, and said, in a voice which was so husky and\ntrembling she could barely understand his words: \"My Senorita knows that\nmy life is hers. She can ask me to go into the fire or into the sea, and\nneither the fire nor the sea would frighten me; they would but make\nme glad for her sake. But I cannot take my Senorita's life to throw it\naway. She is tender; she would die; she cannot lie on the earth for a\nbed, and have no food to eat. My Senorita does not know what she says.\"\n\nHis solemn tone; this third-person designation, as if he were speaking\nof her, not with her, almost as if he were thinking aloud to God rather\nthan speaking to her, merely calmed and strengthened, did not deter\nRamona. \"I am strong; I can work too, Alessandro. You do not know. We\ncan both work. I am not afraid to lie on the earth; and God will give us\nfood,\" she said.\n\n\"That was what I thought, my Senorita, until now. When I rode away\nthat morning, I had it in my thoughts, as you say, that if you were not\nafraid, I would not be; and that there would at least always be food,\nand I could make it that you should never suffer; but, Senorita, the\nsaints are displeased. They do not pray for us any more. It is as my\nfather said, they have forsaken us. These Americans will destroy us all.\nI do not know but they will presently begin to shoot us and poison\nus, to get us all out of the country, as they do the rabbits and the\ngophers; it would not be any worse than what they have done. Would not\nyou rather be dead, Senorita, than be as I am to-day?\"\n\nEach word he spoke but intensified Ramona's determination to share\nhis lot. \"Alessandro,\" she interrupted, \"there are many men among your\npeople who have wives, are there not?\"\n\n\"Yes, Senorita!\" replied Alessandro, wonderingly.\n\n\"Have their wives left them and gone away, now that this trouble has\ncome?\"\n\n\"No, Senorita.\" still more wonderingly; \"how could they?\"\n\n\"They are going to stay with them, help them to earn money, try to make\nthem happier, are they not?\"\n\n\"Yes, Senorita.\" Alessandro began to see whither these questions tended.\nIt was not unlike the Senora's tactics, the way in which Ramona narrowed\nin her lines of interrogation.\n\n\"Do the women of your people love their husbands very much?\"\n\n\"Very much, Senorita.\" A pause. It was very dark now. Alessandro could\nnot see the hot currents running swift and red over Ramona's face; even\nher neck changed color as she asked her last question. \"Do you think any\none of them loves her husband more than I love you, Alessandro?\"\n\nAlessandro's arms were again around her, before the words were done.\nWere not such words enough to make a dead man live? Almost; but not\nenough to make such a love as Alessandro's selfish. Alessandro was\nsilent.\n\n\"You know there is not one!\" said Ramona, impetuously.\n\n\"Oh, it is too much!\" cried Alessandro, throwing his arms up wildly.\nThen, drawing her to him again, he said, the words pouring out\nbreathless: \"My Senorita, you take me to the door of heaven, but I dare\nnot go in. I know it would kill you, Senorita, to live the life we must\nlive. Let me go, dearest Senorita; let me go! It had been better if you\nhad never seen me.\"\n\n\"Do you know what I was going to do, Alessandro, if you had not come?\"\nsaid Ramona. \"I was going to run away from the Senora's house, all\nalone, and walk all the way to Santa Barbara, to Father Salvierderra,\nand ask him to put me in the convent at San Juan Bautista; and that is\nwhat I will do now if you leave me!\"\n\n\"Oh, no, no, Senorita, my Senorita, you will not do that! My beautiful\nSenorita in the convent! No, no!\" cried Alessandro, greatly agitated.\n\n\"Yes, if you do not let me come with you, I shall do it. I shall set out\nto-morrow.\"\n\nHer words carried conviction to Alessandro's soul. He knew she would do\nas she said. \"Even that would not be so dreadful as to be hunted like a\nwild beast, Senorita; as you may be, if you come with me.\"\n\n\"When I thought you were dead, Alessandro, I did not think the convent\nwould be dreadful at all. I thought it would be peace; and I could do\ngood, teaching the children. But if I knew you were alive, I could never\nhave peace; not for one minute have peace, Alessandro! I would rather\ndie, than not be where you are. Oh, Alessandro, take me with you!\"\n\nAlessandro was conquered. \"I will take you, my most beloved Senorita,\"\nhe said gravely,--no lover's gladness in his tone, and his voice was\nhollow; \"I will take you. Perhaps the saints will have mercy on you,\neven if they have forsaken me and my people!\"\n\n\"Your people are my people, dearest; and the saints never forsake any\none who does not forsake them. You will be glad all our lives long,\nAlessandro,\" cried Ramona; and she laid her head on his breast in solemn\nsilence for a moment, as if registering a vow.\n\nWell might Felipe have said that he would hold himself fortunate if any\nwoman ever loved him as Ramona loved Alessandro.\n\nWhen she lifted her head, she said timidly, now that she was sure, \"Then\nyou will take your Ramona with you, Alessandro?\"\n\n\"I will take you with me till I die; and may the Madonna guard you, my\nRamona,\" replied Alessandro, clasping her to his breast, and bowing\nhis head upon hers. But there were tears in his eyes, and they were not\ntears of joy; and in his heart he said, as in his rapturous delight when\nhe first saw Ramona bending over the brook under the willows he had said\naloud, \"My God! what shall I do!\"\n\nIt was not easy to decide on the best plan of procedure now. Alessandro\nwished to go boldly to the house, see Senor Felipe, and if need be the\nSenora. Ramona quivered with terror at the bare mention of it. \"You do\nnot know the Senora, Alessandro,\" she cried, \"or you would never think\nof it. She has been terrible all this time. She hates me so that she\nwould kill me if she dared. She pretends that she will do nothing to\nprevent my going away; but I believe at the last minute she would throw\nme in the well in the court-yard, rather than have me go with you.\"\n\n\"I would never let her harm you,\" said Alessandro. \"Neither would Senor\nFelipe.\"\n\n\"She turns Felipe round her finger as if he were soft wax,\" answered\nRamona. \"She makes him of a hundred minds in a minute, and he can't help\nhimself. Oh, I think she is in league with the fiends, Alessandro! Don't\ndare to come near the house; I will come here as soon as every one is\nasleep. We must go at once.\"\n\nRamona's terrors overruled Alessandro's judgment, and he consented to\nwait for her at the spot where they now stood. She turned back twice to\nembrace him again. \"Oh, my Alessandro, promise me that you will not stir\nfrom this place till I come,\" she said.\n\n\"I will be here when you come,\" he said.\n\n\"It will not be more than two hours,\" she said, \"or three, at the\nutmost. It must be nine o'clock now.\"\n\nShe did not observe that Alessandro had evaded the promise not to leave\nthe spot. That promise Alessandro would not have given. He had something\nto do in preparation for this unexpected flight of Ramona. In her\ninnocence, her absorption in her thoughts of Alessandro and of love, she\nhad never seemed to consider how she would make this long journey.\nAs Alessandro had ridden towards Temecula, eighteen days ago, he had\npictured himself riding back on his fleet, strong Benito, and bringing\nAntonio's matchless little dun mare for Ramona to ride. Only eighteen\nshort days ago; and as he was dreaming that very dream, he had looked up\nand seen Antonio on the little dun mare, galloping towards him like the\nwind, the overridden creature's breath coming from her like pants of\na steam-engine, and her sides dripping blood, where Antonio, who loved\nher, had not spared the cruel spurs; and Antonio, seeing him, had\nuttered a cry, and flinging himself off, came with a bound to his side,\nand with gasps between his words told him. Alessandro could not remember\nthe words, only that after them he set his teeth, and dropping the\nbridle, laid his head down between Benito's ears, and whispered to him;\nand Benito never stopped, but galloped on all that day, till he came\ninto Temecula; and there Alessandro saw the roofless houses, and\nthe wagons being loaded, and the people running about, the women and\nchildren wailing; and then they showed him the place where his father\nlay on the ground, under the tule, and jumping off Benito he let him go,\nand that was the last he ever saw of him. Only eighteen days ago! And\nnow here he was, under the willows,--the same copse where he first\nhalted, at his first sight of Ramona; and it was night, dark night, and\nRamona had been there, in his arms; she was his; and she was going back\npresently to go away with him,--where! He had no home in the wide world\nto which to take her,--and this poor beast he had ridden from Temecula,\nhad it strength enough left to carry her? Alessandro doubted. He had\nhimself walked more than half the distance, to spare the creature, and\nyet there had been good pasture all the way; but the animal had been too\nlong starved to recover quickly. In the Pachanga canon, where they had\nfound refuge, the grass was burned up by the sun, and the few horses\ntaken over there had suffered wretchedly; some had died. But Alessandro,\neven while his arms were around Ramona, had revolved in his mind a\nproject he would not have dared to confide to her. If Baba, Ramona's own\nhorse, was still in the corral, Alessandro could without difficulty\nlure him out. He thought it would be no sin. At any rate, if it were,\nit could not be avoided. The Senorita must have a horse, and Baba had\nalways been her own; had followed her about like a dog ever since he\ncould run; in fact, the only taming he had ever had, had been done by\nRamona, with bread and honey. He was intractable to others; but Ramona\ncould guide him by a wisp of his silky mane. Alessandro also had nearly\nas complete control over him; for it had been one of his greatest\npleasures, during the summer, when he could not see Ramona, to caress\nand fondle her horse, till Baba knew and loved him next to his young\nmistress. If only Baba were in the corral, all would be well. As soon as\nthe sound of Ramona's footsteps had died away, Alessandro followed with\nquick but stealthy steps; keeping well down in the bottom, below the\nwillows, he skirted the terrace where the artichoke-patch and the\nsheepfolds lay, and then turned up to approach the corral from the\nfarther side. There was no light in any of the herdsmen's huts. They\nwere all asleep. That was good. Well Alessandro knew how sound they\nslept; many a night while he slept there with them he had walked twice\nover their bodies as they lay stretched on skins on the floor,--out\nand in without rousing them. If only Baba would not give a loud whinny.\nleaning on the corral-fence, Alessandro gave a low, hardly audible\nwhistle. The horses were all in a group together at the farther end of\nthe corral. At the sound there was a slight movement in the group; and\none of them turned and came a pace or two toward Alessandro.\n\n\"I believe that is Baba himself,\" thought Alessandro; and he made\nanother low sound. The horse quickened his steps; then halted, as if he\nsuspected some mischief.\n\n\"Baba,\" whispered Alessandro. The horse knew his name as well as any\ndog; knew Alessandro's voice too; but the sagacious creature seemed\ninstinctively to know that here was an occasion for secrecy and caution.\nIf Alessandro whispered, he, Baba, would whisper back; and it was little\nmore than a whispered whinny which he gave, as he trotted quickly to the\nfence, and put his nose to Alessandro's face, rubbing and kissing and\ngiving soft whinnying sighs.\n\n\"Hush! hush! Baba,\" whispered Alessandro, as if he were speaking to a\nhuman being. \"Hush!\" and he proceeded cautiously to lift off the upper\nrails and bushes of the fence. The horse understood instantly; and as\nsoon as the fence was a little lowered, leaped over it and stood still\nby Alessandro's side, while he replaced the rails, smiling to himself,\nspite of his grave anxiety, to think of Juan Can's wonder in the morning\nas to how Baba had managed to get out of the corral.\n\nThis had taken only a few moments. It was better luck than Alessandro\nhad hoped for; emboldened by it, he began to wonder if he could not get\nthe saddle too. The saddles, harnesses, bridles, and all such things\nhung on pegs in an open barn, such as is constantly to be seen in\nSouthern California; as significant a testimony, in matter of climate,\nas any Signal Service Report could be,--a floor and a roof; no walls,\nonly corner posts to hold the roof. Nothing but summerhouses on a large\nscale are the South California barns. Alessandro stood musing. The\nlonger he thought, the greater grew his desire for that saddle.\n\n\"Baba, if only you knew what I wanted of you, you'd lie down on the\nground here and wait while I got the saddle. But I dare not risk leaving\nyou. Come, Baba!\" and he struck down the hill again, the horse following\nhim softly. When he got down below the terrace, he broke into a run,\nwith his hand in Baba's mane, as if it were a frolic; and in a few\nmoments they were safe in the willow copse, where Alessandro's poor pony\nwas tethered. Fastening Baba with the same lariat, Alessandro patted him\non the neck, pressed his face to his nose, and said aloud, \"Good Baba,\nstay here till the Senorita comes.\" Baba whinnied.\n\n\"Why shouldn't he know the Senorita's name! I believe he does!\" thought\nAlessandro, as he turned and again ran swiftly back to the corral. He\nfelt strong now,--felt like a new man. Spite of all the terror, joy\nthrilled him. When he reached the corral, all was yet still. The horses\nhad not moved from their former position. Throwing himself flat on the\nground, Alessandro crept on his breast from the corral to the barn,\nseveral rods' distance. This was the most hazardous part of his\nadventure; every other moment he paused, lay motionless for some\nseconds, then crept a few paces more. As he neared the corner where\nRamona's saddle always hung, his heart beat. Sometimes, of a warm night,\nLuigo slept on the barn floor. If he were there to-night, all was lost.\nGroping in the darkness, Alessandro pulled himself up on the post, felt\nfor the saddle, found it, lifted it, and in a trice was flat on the\nground again, drawing the saddle along after him. Not a sound had he\nmade, that the most watchful of sheep-dogs could hear.\n\n\"Ha, old Capitan, caught you napping this time!\" said Alessandro to\nhimself, as at last he got safe to the bottom of the terrace, and,\nspringing to his feet, bounded away with the saddle on his shoulders.\nIt was a weight for a starving man to carry, but he felt it not, for\nthe rejoicing he had in its possession. Now his Senorita would go in\ncomfort. To ride Baba was to be rocked in a cradle. If need be, Baba\nwould carry them both, and never know it; and it might come to that,\nAlessandro thought, as he knelt by the side of his poor beast, which was\nstretched out on the ground exhausted; Baba standing by, looking down in\nscornful wonder at this strange new associate.\n\n\"The saints be praised!\" thought Alessandro, as he seated himself to\nwait. \"This looks as if they would not desert my Senorita.\"\n\nThoughts whirled in his brain. Where should they go first? What would be\nbest? Would they be pursued? Where could they hide? Where should he seek\na new home?\n\nIt was bootless thinking, until Ramona was by his side. He must lay\neach plan before her. She must decide. The first thing was to get to\nSan Diego, to the priest, to be married. That would be three days' hard\nride; five for the exhausted Indian pony. What should they eat on\nthe ways Ah! Alessandro bethought him of the violin at Hartsel's. Mr.\nHartsel would give him money on that; perhaps buy it. Then Alessandro\nremembered his own violin. He had not once thought of it before. It lay\nin its case on a table in Senor Felipe's room when he came away, Was it\npossible? No, of course it could not be possible that the Senorita would\nthink to bring it. What would she bring? She would be wise, Alessandro\nwas sure.\n\nHow long the hours seemed as he sat thus plotting and conjecturing; more\nand more thankful, as each hour went by, to see the sky still clouded,\nthe darkness dense. \"It must have been the saints, too, that brought me\non a night when there was no moon,\" he thought; and then he said again,\ndevout and simple-minded man that he was. \"They mean to protect my\nSenorita; they will let me take care of her.\"\n\nRamona was threading a perilous way, through great difficulties. She had\nreached her room unobserved, so far as she could judge. Luckily for her,\nMargarita was in bed with a terrible toothache, for which her mother had\ngiven her a strong sleeping-draught. Margarita was disposed of. If she\nhad not been, Ramona would never have got away, for Margarita would have\nknown that she had been out of the house for two hours, and would have\nwatched to see what it meant.\n\nRamona came in through the court-yard; she dared not go by the veranda,\nsure that Felipe and his mother were sitting there still, for it was not\nlate.\n\nAs she entered her room, she heard them talking. She closed one of her\nwindows, to let them know she was there. Then she knelt at the Madonna's\nfeet, and in an inaudible whisper told her all she was going to do, and\nprayed that she would watch over her and Alessandro, and show them where\nto go.\n\n\"I know she will! I am sure she will!\" whispered Ramona to herself as\nshe rose from her knees.\n\nThen she threw herself on her bed, to wait till the Senora and Felipe\nshould be asleep. Her brain was alert, clear. She knew exactly what she\nwished to do. She had thought that all out, more than two weeks ago,\nwhen she was looking for Alessandro hour by hour.\n\nEarly in the summer Alessandro had given to her, as curiosities, two\nof the large nets which the Indian women use for carrying all sorts of\nburdens. They are woven out of the fibres of a flax-like plant, and\nare strong as iron. The meshes being large, they are very light; are\ngathered at each end, and fastened to a band which goes around the\nforehead. In these can be carried on the back, with comparative ease,\nheavier loads than could be lifted in any other way. Until Ramona\nrecollected these, she had been perplexed to know how she should carry\nthe things which she had made up her mind it would be right for her to\ntake,--only a few; simply necessaries; one stuff gown and her shawls;\nthe new altar-cloth, and two changes of clothes; that would not be a\ngreat deal; she had a right to so much, she thought, now that she\nhad seen the jewels in the Senora's keeping. \"I will tell Father\nSalvierderra exactly what I took,\" she thought, \"and ask him if it was\ntoo much.\" She did not like to think that all these clothes she must\ntake had been paid for with the Senora Moreno's money.\n\nAnd Alessandro's violin. Whatever else she left, that must go. What\nwould life be to Alessandro without a violin! And if they went to Los\nAngeles, he might earn money by playing at dances. Already Ramona had\ndevised several ways by which they could both earn money.\n\nThere must be also food for the journey. And it must be good food, too;\nwine for Alessandro. Anguish filled her heart as she recalled how gaunt\nhe looked. \"Starving,\" he said they had been. Good God! Starving! And\nshe had sat down each day at loaded tables, and seen, each day, good\nfood thrown to the dogs to eat.\n\nIt was long before the Senora went to her room; and long after that\nbefore Felipe's breathing had become so deep and regular that Ramona\ndared feel sure that he was asleep. At last she ventured out. All was\ndark; it was past midnight.\n\n\"The violin first!\" she said; and creeping into the dining-room, and\nthrough the inner door to Felipe's room, she brought it out, rolled it\nin shawl after shawl, and put it in the net with her clothes. Then she\nstole out, with this net on her back, \"like a true Indian woman as I\nam,\" she said, almost gayly, to herself,--through the court-yard, around\nthe southeast corner of the house, past the garden, down to the willows,\nwhere she laid down her load, and went back for the second.\n\nThis was harder. Wine she was resolved to have and bread and cold\nmeat. She did not know so well where to put her hand on old Marda's\npossessions as on her own, and she dared not strike a light. She made\nseveral journeys to the kitchen and pantry before she had completed her\nstore. Wine, luckily, she found in the dining-room,--two full bottles;\nalso milk, which she poured into a leathern flask which hung on the wall\nin the veranda.\n\nNow all was ready. She leaned from her window, and listened to Felipe's\nbreathing. \"How can I go without bidding him good-by?\" she said. \"How\ncan I?\" and she stood irresolute.\n\n\"Dear Felipe! Dear Felipe! He has always been so good to me! He has done\nall he could for me. I wish I dared kiss him. I will leave a note for\nhim.\"\n\nTaking a pencil and paper, and a tiny wax taper, whose light\nwould hardly be seen across a room, she slipped once more into the\ndining-room, knelt on the floor behind the door, lighted her taper, and\nwrote:--\n\n\"DEAR FELIPE,--Alessandro has come, and I am going away with him\nto-night. Don't let anything be done to us, if you can help it. I don't\nknow where we are going. I hope, to Father Salvierderra. I shall love\nyou always. Thank you, dear Felipe, for all your kindness.\n\n\"RAMONA.\"\n\nIt had not taken a moment. She blew out her taper, and crept back into\nher room. Felipe's bed was now moved close to the wall of the house.\nFrom her window she could reach its foot. Slowly, cautiously, she\nstretched out her arm and dropped the little paper on the coverlet, just\nover Felipe's feet. There was a risk that the Senora would come out in\nthe morning, before Felipe awaked, and see the note first; but that risk\nshe would take.\n\n\"Farewell, dear Felipe!\" she whispered, under her breath, as she turned\nfrom the window.\n\nThe delay had cost her dear. The watchful Capitan, from his bed at the\nupper end of the court, had half heard, half scented, something strange\ngoing on. As Ramona stepped out, he gave one short, quick bark, and came\nbounding down.\n\n\"Holy Virgin, I am lost!\" thought Ramona; but, crouching on the ground,\nshe quickly opened her net, and as Capitan came towards her, gave him a\npiece of meat, fondling and caressing him. While he ate it, wagging his\ntail, and making great demonstrations of joy, she picked up her load\nagain, and still fondling him, said, \"Come on, Capitan!\" It was her last\nchance. If he barked again, somebody would be waked; if he went by her\nside quietly, she might escape. A cold sweat of terror burst on her\nforehead as she took her first step cautiously. The dog followed. She\nquickened her pace; he trotted along, still smelling the meat in the\nnet. When she reached the willows, she halted, debating whether she\nshould give him a large piece of meat, and try to run away while he was\neating it, or whether she should let him go quietly along. She decided\non the latter course; and, picking up her other net, walked on. She was\nsafe now. She turned, and looked back towards the house; all was dark\nand still. She could hardly see its outline. A great wave of emotion\nswept over her. It was the only home she had ever known. All she\nhad experienced of happiness, as well as of bitter pain, had been\nthere,--Felipe, Father Salvierderra, the servants, the birds, the\ngarden, the dear chapel! Ah, if she could have once more prayed in the\nchapel! Who would put fresh flowers and ferns in the chapel now? How\nFelipe would miss her, when he knelt before the altar! For fourteen\nyears she had knelt by his side. And the Senora,--the hard, cold Senora!\nShe would alone be glad. Everybody else would be sorry. \"They will all\nbe sorry I have gone,--all but the Senora! I wish it had been so that I\ncould have bidden them all good-by, and had them all bid me good-by, and\nwish us good fortune!\" thought the gentle, loving girl, as she drew a\nlong sigh, and, turning her back on her home, went forward in the path\nshe had chosen.\n\nShe stooped and patted Capitan on the head. \"Will you come with me,\nCapitan?\" she said; and Capitan leaped up joyfully, giving two or three\nshort, sharp notes of delight. \"Good Capitan, come! They will not\nmiss him out of so many,\" she thought, \"and it will always seem like\nsomething from home, as long as I have Capitan.\"\n\nWhen Alessandro first saw Ramona's figure dimly in the gloom, drawing\nslowly nearer, he did not recognize it, and he was full of apprehension\nat the sight. What stranger could it be, abroad in these lonely meadows\nat this hour of the night? Hastily he led the horses farther back into\nthe copse, and hid himself behind a tree, to watch. In a few moments\nmore he thought he recognized Capitan, bounding by the side of this\nbent and slow-moving figure. Yet this was surely an Indian woman toiling\nalong under a heavy load. But what Indian woman would have so superb a\ncollie as Capitan? Alessandro strained his eyes through the darkness.\nPresently he saw the figure halt,--drop part of its burden.\n\n\"Alessandro!\" came in a sweet, low call.\n\nHe bounded like a deer, crying, \"My Senorita! my Senorita! Can that be\nyou? To think that you have brought these heavy loads!\"\n\nRamona laughed. \"Do you remember the day you showed me how the Indian\nwomen carried so much on their backs, in these nets? I did not think\nthen I would use it so soon. But it hurts my forehead, Alessandro. It\nisn't the weight, but the strings cut. I couldn't have carried them much\nfarther!\"\n\n\"Ah, you had no basket to cover the head,\" replied Alessandro, as he\nthrew up the two nets on his shoulders as if they had been feathers. In\ndoing so, he felt the violin-case.\n\n\"Is it the violin?\" he cried. \"My blessed one, where did you get it?\"\n\n\"Off the table in Felipe's room,\" she answered. \"I knew you would rather\nhave it than anything else. I brought very little, Alessandro; it seemed\nnothing while I was getting it; but it is very heavy to carry. Will\nit be too much for the poor tired horse? You and I can walk. And see,\nAlessandro, here is Capitan. He waked up, and I had to bring him, to\nkeep him still. Can't he go with us?\"\n\nCapitan was leaping up, putting his paws on Alessandro's breast,\nlicking his face, yelping, doing all a dog could do, to show welcome and\naffection.\n\nAlessandro laughed aloud. Ramona had not more than two or three times\nheard him do this. It frightened her. \"Why do you laugh, Alessandro?\"\nshe said.\n\n\"To think what I have to show you, my Senorita,\" he said. \"Look here;\"\nand turning towards the willows, he gave two or three low whistles, at\nthe first note of which Baba came trotting out of the copse to the end\nof his lariat, and began to snort and whinny with delight as soon as he\nperceived Ramona.\n\nRamona burst into tears. The surprise was too great.\n\n\"Are you not glad, Senorita?\" cried Alessandro, aghast. \"Is it not your\nown horse? If you do not wish to take him, I will lead him back. My pony\ncan carry you, if we journey very slowly. But I thought it would be joy\nto you to have Baba.\"\n\n\"Oh, it is! it is!\" sobbed Ramona, with her head on Baba's neck. \"It is\na miracle,--a miracle. How did he come here? And, the saddle too!\" she\ncried, for the first time observing that. \"Alessandro,\" in an awe-struck\nwhisper, \"did the saints send him? Did you find him here?\" It would have\nseemed to Ramona's faith no strange thing, had this been so.\n\n\"I think the saints helped me to bring him,\" answered Alessandro,\nseriously, \"or else I had not done it so easily. I did but call, near\nthe corral-fence, and he came to my hand, and leaped over the rails at\nmy word, as quickly as Capitan might have done. He is yours, Senorita.\nIt is no harm to take him?\"\n\n\"Oh, no!\" answered Ramona. \"He is more mine than anything else I had;\nfor it was Felipe gave him to me when he could but just stand on his\nlegs; he was only two days old; and I have fed him out of my hand every\nday till now; and now he is five. Dear Baba, we will never be parted,\nnever!\" and she took his head in both her hands, and laid her cheek\nagainst it lovingly.\n\nAlessandro was busy, fastening the two nets on either side of the\nsaddle. \"Baba will never know he has a load at all; they are not so\nheavy as my Senorita thought,\" he said. \"It was the weight on the\nforehead, with nothing to keep the strings from the skin, which gave her\npain.\"\n\nAlessandro was making all haste. His hands trembled. \"We must make all\nthe speed we can, dearest Senorita,\" he said, \"for a few hours. Then we\nwill rest. Before light, we will be in a spot where we can hide safely\nall day. We will journey only by night, lest they pursue us.\"\n\n\"They will not,\" said Ramona. \"There is no danger. The Senora said she\nshould do nothing. 'Nothing!'\" she repeated, in a bitter tone. \"That is\nwhat she made Felipe say, too. Felipe wanted to help us. He would have\nliked to have you stay with us; but all he could get was, that she would\ndo 'nothing!' But they will not follow us. They will wish never to hear\nof me again. I mean, the Senora will wish never to hear of me. Felipe\nwill be sorry. Felipe is very good, Alessandro.\"\n\nThey were all ready now,--Ramona on Baba, the two packed nets swinging\nfrom her saddle, one on either side. Alessandro, walking, led his tired\npony. It was a sad sort of procession for one going to be wed, but\nRamona's heart was full of joy.\n\n\"I don't know why it is, Alessandro,\" she said; \"I should think I\nwould be afraid, but I have not the least fear,--not the least; not of\nanything that can come, Alessandro,\" she reiterated with emphasis. \"Is\nit not strange?\"\n\n\"Yes, Senorita,\" he replied solemnly, laying his hand on hers as he\nwalked close at her side. \"It is strange. I am afraid,--afraid for you,\nmy Senorita! But it is done, and we will not go back; and perhaps the\nsaints will help you, and will let me take care of you. They must love\nyou, Senorita; but they do not love me, nor my people.\"\n\n\"Are you never going to call me by my name?\" asked Ramona. \"I hate your\ncalling me Senorita. That was what the Senora always called me when she\nwas displeased.\"\n\n\"I will never speak the word again!\" cried Alessandro. \"The saints\nforbid I should speak to you in the words of that woman!\"\n\n\"Can't you say Ramona?\" she asked.\n\nAlessandro hesitated. He could not have told why it seemed to him\ndifficult to say Ramona.\n\n\"What was that other name, you said you always thought of me by?\" she\ncontinued. \"The Indian name,--the name of the dove?\"\n\n\"Majel,\" he said. \"It is by that name I have oftenest thought of you\nsince the night I watched all night for you, after you had kissed me,\nand two wood-doves were calling and answering each other in the dark;\nand I said to myself, that is what my love is like, the wood-dove: the\nwood-dove's voice is low like hers, and sweeter than any other sound in\nthe earth; and the wood-dove is true to one mate always--\" He stopped.\n\n\"As I to you, Alessandro,\" said Ramona, leaning from her horse, and\nresting her hand on Alessandro's shoulder.\n\nBaba stopped. He was used to knowing by the most trivial signs what his\nmistress wanted; he did not understand this new situation; no one had\never before, when Ramona was riding him, walked by his side so close\nthat he touched his shoulders, and rested his hand in his mane. If it\nhad been anybody else than Alessandro, Baba would not have permitted it\neven now. But it must be all right, since Ramona was quiet; and now she\nhad stretched out her hand and rested it on Alessandro's shoulder.\nDid that mean halt for a moment? Baba thought it might, and acted\naccordingly; turning his head round to the right, and looking back to\nsee what came of it.\n\nAlessandro's arms around Ramona, her head bent down to his, their lips\ntogether,--what could Baba think? As mischievously as if he had been\na human being or an elf, Baba bounded to one side and tore the lovers\napart. They both laughed, and cantered on,--Alessandro running; the poor\nIndian pony feeling the contagion, and loping as it had not done for\nmany a day.\n\n\"Majel is my name, then,\" said Ramona, \"is it? It is a sweet sound, but\nI would like it better Majella. Call me Majella.\"\n\n\"That will be good,\" replied Alessandro, \"for the reason that never\nbefore had any one the same name. It will not be hard for me to say\nMajella. I know not why your name of Ramona has always been hard to my\ntongue.\"\n\n\"Because it was to be that you should call me Majella,\" said Ramona.\n\"Remember, I am Ramona no longer. That also was the name the Senora\ncalled me by--and dear Felipe too,\" she added thoughtfully. \"He would\nnot know me by my new name. I would like to have him always call\nme Ramona. But for all the rest of the world I am Majella,\nnow,--Alessandro's Majel!\"\n\n\n\n\nXVI\n\nAFTER they reached the highway, and had trotted briskly on for a mile,\nAlessandro suddenly put out his hand, and taking Baba by the rein, began\nturning him round and round in the road.\n\n\"We will not go any farther in the road,\" he said, \"but I must conceal\nour tracks here. We will go backwards for a few paces.\" The obedient\nBaba backed slowly, half dancing, as if he understood the trick; the\nIndian pony, too, curvetted awkwardly, then by a sudden bound under\nAlessandro's skilful guidance, leaped over a rock to the right, and\nstood waiting further orders. Baba followed, and Capitan; and there was\nno trail to show where they had left the road.\n\nAfter trotting the pony round and round again in ever-widening circles,\ncantering off in one direction after another, then backing over the\ntracks for a few moments, Ramona docilely following, though much\nbewildered as to what it all meant, Alessandro said: \"I think now they\nwill never discover where we left the road. They will ride along, seeing\nour tracks plain, and then they will be so sure that we would have kept\nstraight on, that they will not notice for a time; and when they do,\nthey will never be able to see where the trail ended. And now my Majella\nhas a very hard ride before her. Will she be afraid?\"\n\n\"Afraid.\" laughed Ramona. \"Afraid,--on Baba, and with you!\"\n\nBut it was indeed a hard ride. Alessandro had decided to hide for\nthe day in a canon he knew, from which a narrow trail led direct to\nTemecula,--a trail which was known to none but Indians. Once in this\ncanon, they would be safe from all possible pursuit. Alessandro did not\nin the least share Ramona's confidence that no effort would be made to\novertake them. To his mind, it appeared certain that the Senora would\nnever accept the situation without making an attempt to recover at least\nthe horse and the dog. \"She can say, if she chooses, that I have stolen\none of her horses,\" he thought to himself bitterly; \"and everybody would\nbelieve her. Nobody would believe us, if we said it was the Senorita's\nown horse.\"\n\nThe head of the canon was only a couple of miles from the road; but it\nwas in a nearly impenetrable thicket of chaparral, where young oaks had\ngrown up so high that their tops made, as it were, a second stratum of\nthicket. Alessandro had never ridden through it; he had come up on foot\nonce from the other side, and, forcing his way through the tangle had\nfound, to his surprise, that he was near the highway. It was from this\ncanon that he had brought the ferns which it had so delighted Ramona\nto arrange for the decoration of the chapel. The place was filled with\nthem, growing almost in tropical luxuriance; but this was a mile or so\nfarther down, and to reach that spot from above, Alessandro had had to\nlet himself down a sheer wall of stone. The canon at its head was little\nmore than a rift in the rocks, and the stream which had its rise in\nit was only a trickling spring at the beginning. It was this precious\nwater, as well as the inaccessibility of the spot, which had decided\nAlessandro to gain the place at all hazards and costs. But a wall of\ngranite would not have seemed a much more insuperable obstacle than did\nthis wall of chaparral, along which they rode, vainly searching for a\nbreak in it. It appeared to Alessandro to have thickened and knit even\nsince the last spring. At last they made their way down a small side\ncanon,--a sort of wing to the main canon; a very few rods down this, and\nthey were as hidden from view from above as if the earth had swallowed\nthem. The first red tints of the dawn were coming. From the eastern\nhorizon to the zenith, the whole sky was like a dappled crimson fleece.\n\n\"Oh, what a lovely place.\" exclaimed Ramona. \"I am sure this was not a\nhard ride at all, Alessandro! Is this where we are to stay?\"\n\nAlessandro turned a compassionate look upon her. \"How little does the\nwood-dove know of rough places!\" he said. \"This is only the beginning;\nhardly is it even the beginning.\"\n\nFastening his pony to a bush, he reconnoitred the place, disappearing\nfrom sight the moment he entered the chaparral in any direction.\nReturning at last, with a grave face, he said, \"Will Majella let me\nleave her here for a little time? There is a way, but I can find it only\non foot. I will not be gone long. I know it is near.\"\n\nTears came into Ramona's eyes. The only thing she dreaded was the losing\nsight of Alessandro. He gazed at her anxiously. \"I must go, Majella,\" he\nsaid with emphasis. \"We are in danger here.\"\n\n\"Go! go! Alessandro,\" she cried. \"But, oh, do not be long!\"\n\nAs he disappeared in the thicket, the tough boughs crackling and\nsnapping before him, it seemed to Ramona that she was again alone in the\nworld. Capitan, too, bounded after Alessandro, and did not return at her\ncall. All was still. Ramona laid her head on Baba's neck. The moments\nseemed hours. At last, just as the yellow light streamed across the\nsky, and the crimson fleeces turned in one second to gold, she heard\nAlessandro's steps, the next moment saw his face. It was aglow with joy.\n\n\"I have found the trail!\" he exclaimed; \"but we must climb up again out\nof this; and it is too light. I like it not.\"\n\nWith fear and trembling they urged their horses up and out into the open\nagain, and galloped a half-mile farther west, still keeping as close\nto the chaparral thicket as possible. Here Alessandro, who led the way,\nsuddenly turned into the very thicket itself; no apparent opening; but\nthe boughs parted and closed, and his head appeared above them;\nstill the little pony was trotting bravely along. Baba snorted\nwith displeasure as he plunged into the same bristling pathway. The\nthick-set, thorny branches smote Ramona's cheeks. What was worse, they\ncaught the nets swung on Baba's sides; presently these were held fast,\nand Baba began to rear and kick. Here was a real difficulty. Alessandro\ndismounted, cut the strings, and put both the packages securely on the\nback of his own pony. \"I will walk,\" he said. \"It was only a little way\nlonger I would have ridden. I shall lead Baba, where it is narrow.\"\n\n\"Narrow,\" indeed. It was from sheer terror, soon, that Ramona shut her\neyes. A path, it seemed to her only a hand's-breadth wide,--a stony,\ncrumbling path,--on the side of a precipice, down which the stones\nrolled, and rolled, and rolled, echoing, far out of sight, as they\npassed; at each step the beasts took, the stones rolled and fell. Only\nthe yucca-plants, with their sharp bayonet-leaves, had made shift to\nkeep foothold on this precipice. Of these there were thousands; and\ntheir tall flower-stalks, fifteen, twenty feet high, set thick with the\nshining, smooth seed-cups, glistened like satin chalices in the sun.\nBelow--hundreds of feet below--lay the canon bottom, a solid bed of\nchaparral, looking soft and even as a bed of moss. Giant sycamore-trees\nlifted their heads, at intervals, above this; and far out in the plain\nglistened the loops of the river, whose sources, unknown to the world,\nseen of but few human eyes, were to be waters of comfort to these\nfugitives this day.\n\nAlessandro was cheered. The trail was child's play to him. At the first\ntread of Baba's dainty steps on the rolling stones, he saw that the\nhorse was as sure-footed as an Indian pony. In a few short hours, now,\nthey would be all at rest. He knew where, under a sycamore-clump, there\nwas running water, clear as crystal, and cold,--almost colder than one\ncould drink,--and green grass too; plenty for two days' feed for the\nhorses, or even three; and all California might be searched over in vain\nfor them, once they were down this trail. His heart full of joy at these\nthoughts, he turned, to see Ramona pallid, her lips parted, her eyes\nfull of terror. He had forgotten that her riding had hitherto been\nonly on the smooth ways of the valley and the plain, There she was so\nfearless, that he had had no misgiving about her nerves here; but she\nhad dropped the reins, was clutching Baba's mane with both hands, and\nsitting unsteadily in her saddle. She had been too proud to cry out; but\nshe was nearly beside herself with fright. Alessandro halted so suddenly\nthat Baba, whose nose was nearly on his shoulder, came to so sharp a\nstop that Ramona uttered a cry. She thought he had lost his footing.\n\nAlessandro looked at her in dismay. To dismount on that perilous trail\nwas impossible; moreover, to walk there would take more nerve than to\nride. Yet she looked as if she could not much longer keep her seat.\n\n\"Carita,\" he cried, \"I was stupid not to have told you how narrow the\nway is; but it is safe. I can run in it. I ran all this way with the\nferns on my back I brought for you.\"\n\n\"Oh, did you?\" gasped Ramona, diverted, for the moment, from her\ncontemplation of the abyss, and more reassured by that change of her\nthoughts than she could have been by anything else. \"Did you? It is\nfrightful, Alessandro. I never heard of such a trail. I feel as if I\nwere on a rope in the air. If I could get down and go on my hands and\nknees, I think I would like it better. Could I?\"\n\n\"I would not dare to have you get off, just here, Majella,\" answered\nAlessandro, sorrowfully. \"It is dreadful to me to see you suffer so; I\nwill go very slowly. Indeed, it is safe; we all came up here, the whole\nband, for the sheep-shearing,--old Fernando on his horse all the way.\"\n\n\"Really,\" said Ramona, taking comfort at each word, \"I will try not to\nbe so silly. Is it far, dearest Alessandro?\"\n\n\"Not much more as steep as this, dear, nor so narrow; but it will be an\nhour yet before we stop.\"\n\nBut the worst was over for Ramona now, and long before they reached the\nbottom of the precipice she was ready to laugh at her fears; only,\nas she looked back at the zigzag lines of the path over which she had\ncome,--little more than a brown thread, they seemed, flung along the\nrock,--she shuddered.\n\nDown in the bottom of the canon it was still the dusky gloaming when\nthey arrived. Day came late to this fairy spot. Only at high noon did\nthe sun fairly shine in. As Ramona looked around her, she uttered an\nexclamation of delight, which satisfied Alessandro. \"Yes,\" he said,\n\"when I came here for the ferns, I wished to myself many times that you\ncould see it. There is not in all this country so beautiful a place.\nThis is our first home, my Majella,\" he added, in a tone almost solemn;\nand throwing his arms around her, he drew her to his breast, with the\nfirst feeling of joy he had experienced.\n\n\"I wish we could live here always,\" cried Ramona.\n\n\"Would Majella be content?\" said Alessandro.\n\n\"Very,\" she answered.\n\nHe sighed. \"There would not be land enough, to live here,\" he said.\n\"If there were, I too would like to stay here till I died, Majella, and\nnever see the face of a white man again!\" Already the instinct of the\nhunted and wounded animal to seek hiding, was striving in Alessandro's\nblood. \"But there would be no food. We could not live here.\" Ramona's\nexclamation had set Alessandro to thinking, however. \"Would Majella be\ncontent to stay here three days now?\" he asked. \"There is grass enough\nfor the horses for that time. We should be very safe here; and I fear\nvery much we should not be safe on any road. I think, Majella, the\nSenora will send men after Baba.\"\n\n\"Baba!\" cried Ramona, aghast at the idea. \"My own horse! She would not\ndare to call it stealing a horse, to take my own Baba!\" But even as\nshe spoke, her heart misgave her. The Senora would dare anything; would\nmisrepresent anything; only too well Ramona knew what the very mention\nof the phrase \"horse-stealing\" meant all through the country. She looked\npiteously at Alessandro. He read her thoughts.\n\n\"Yes, that is it, Majella,\" he said. \"If she sent men after Baba, there\nis no knowing what they might do. It would not do any good for you to\nsay he was yours. They would not believe you; and they might take me\ntoo, if the Senora had told them to, and put me into Ventura jail.\"\n\n\"She's just wicked enough to do it!\" cried Ramona. \"Let us not stir out\nof this spot, Alessandro,--not for a week! Couldn't we stay a week? By\nthat time she would have given over looking for us.\"\n\n\"I am afraid not a week. There is not feed for the horses; and I do not\nknow what we could eat. I have my gun, but there is not much, now, to\nkill.\"\n\n\"But I have brought meat and bread, Alessandro,\" said Ramona, earnestly,\n\"and we could eat very little each day, and make it last!\" She was like\na child, in her simplicity and eagerness. Every other thought was for\nthe time being driven out of her mind by the terror of being pursued.\nPursuit of her, she knew, would not be in the Senora's plan; but the\nreclaiming of Baba and Capitan, that was another thing. The more Ramona\nthought of it, the more it seemed to her a form of vengeance which would\nbe likely to commend itself to the Senora's mind. Felipe might possibly\nprevent it. It was he who had given Baba to her. He would feel that\nit would be shameful to recall or deny the gift. Only in Felipe lay\nRamona's hope.\n\nIf she had thought to tell Alessandro that in her farewell note\nto Felipe she had said that she supposed they were going to Father\nSalvierderra, it would have saved both her and Alessandro much\ndisquietude. Alessandro would have known that men pursuing them, on that\nsupposition, would have gone straight down the river road to the sea,\nand struck northward along the coast. But it did not occur to Ramona to\nmention this; in fact, she hardly recollected it after the first day.\nAlessandro had explained to her his plan, which was to go by way of\nTemecula to San Diego, to be married there by Father Gaspara, the priest\nof that parish, and then go to the village or pueblo of San Pasquale,\nabout fifteen miles northwest of San Diego. A cousin of Alessandro's\nwas the head man of this village, and had many times begged him to come\nthere to live; but Alessandro had steadily refused, believing it to\nbe his duty to remain at Temecula with his father. San Pasquale was\na regularly established pueblo, founded by a number of the Indian\nneophytes of the San Luis Rey Mission at the time of the breaking up\nof that Mission. It was established by a decree of the Governor of\nCalifornia, and the lands of the San Pasquale Valley given to it. A\npaper recording this establishment and gift, signed by the Governor's\nown hand, was given to the Indian who was the first Alcalde of the\npueblo. He was Chief Pablo's brother. At his death the authority passed\ninto the hands of his son, Ysidro, the cousin of whom Alessandro had\nspoken.\n\n\"Ysidro has that paper still,\" Alessandro said, \"and he thinks it\nwill keep them their village. Perhaps it will; but the Americans are\nbeginning to come in at the head of the valley, and I do not believe,\nMajella, there is any safety anywhere. Still, for a few years we can\nperhaps stay there. There are nearly two hundred Indians in the valley;\nit is much better than Temecula, and Ysidro's people are much better off\nthan ours were. They have splendid herds of cattle and horses, and large\nwheat-fields. Ysidro's house stands under a great fig-tree; they say it\nis the largest fig-tree in the country.\"\n\n\"But, Alessandro,\" cried Ramona, \"why do you think it is not safe there,\nif Ysidro has the paper? I thought a paper made it all right.\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" replied Alessandro. \"Perhaps it may be; but I have got\nthe feeling now that nothing will be of any use against the Americans. I\ndon't believe they will mind the paper.\"\n\n\"They didn't mind the papers the Senora had for all that land of hers\nthey took away,\" said Ramona, thoughtfully. \"But Felipe said that was\nbecause Pio Pico was a bad man, and gave away lands he had no right to\ngive away.\"\n\n\"That's just it,\" said Alessandro. \"Can't they say that same thing about\nany governor, especially if he has given lands to us? If the Senora\ncouldn't keep hers, with Senor Felipe to help her, and he knows all\nabout the law, and can speak the American language, what chance is there\nfor us? We can't take care of ourselves any better than the wild beasts\ncan, my Majella. Oh, why, why did you come with me? Why did I let you?\"\n\nAfter such words as these, Alessandro would throw himself on the ground,\nand for a few moments not even Ramona's voice would make him look up. It\nwas strange that the gentle girl, unused to hardship, or to the thought\nof danger, did not find herself terrified by these fierce glooms and\napprehensions of her lover. But she was appalled by nothing. Saved from\nthe only thing in life she had dreaded, sure that Alessandro lived, and\nthat he would not leave her, she had no fears. This was partly from\nher inexperience, from her utter inability to conceive of the things\nAlessandro's imagination painted in colors only too true; but it was\nalso largely due to the inalienable loyalty and quenchless courage of\nher soul,--qualities in her nature never yet tested; qualities of\nwhich she hardly knew so much as the name, but which were to bear her\nsteadfast and buoyant through many sorrowful years.\n\nBefore nightfall of this their first day in the wilderness, Alessandro\nhad prepared for Ramona a bed of finely broken twigs of the manzanita\nand ceanothus, both of which grew in abundance all through the canon.\nAbove these he spread layers of glossy ferns, five and six feet long;\nwhen it was done, it was a couch no queen need have scorned. As Ramona\nseated herself on it, she exclaimed: \"Now I shall see how it feels to\nlie and look up at the stars at night! Do you recollect, Alessandro,\nthe night you put Felipe's bed on the veranda, when you told me how\nbeautiful it was to lie at night out of doors and look up at the stars?\"\n\nIndeed did Alessandro remember that night,--the first moment he had ever\ndared to dream of the Senorita Ramona as his own. \"Yes, I remember it,\nmy Majella,\" he answered slowly; and in a moment more added, \"That was\nthe day Juan Can had told me that your mother was of my people; and that\nwas the night I first dared in my thoughts to say that perhaps you might\nsome day love me.\"\n\n\"But where are you going to sleep, Alessandro?\" said Ramona, seeing that\nhe spread no more boughs. \"You have made yourself no bed.\"\n\nAlessandro laughed. \"I need no bed,\" he said. \"We think it is on our\nmother's lap we lie, when we lie on the ground. It is not hard, Majella.\nIt is soft, and rests one better than beds. But to-night I shall not\nsleep. I will sit by this tree and watch.\"\n\n\"Why, what are you afraid of?\" asked Ramona.\n\n\"It may grow so cold that I must make a fire for Majella,\" he answered.\n\"It sometimes gets very cold before morning in these canons; so I shall\nfeel safer to watch to-night.\"\n\nThis he said, not to alarm Ramona. His real reason for watching was,\nthat he had seen on the edge of the stream tracks which gave him\nuneasiness. They were faint and evidently old; but they looked like the\ntracks of a mountain lion. As soon as it was dark enough to prevent the\ncurl of smoke from being seen from below, he would light a fire, and\nkeep it blazing all night, and watch, gun in hand, lest the beast\nreturn.\n\n\"But you will be dead, Alessandro, if you do not sleep. You are not\nstrong,\" said Ramona, anxiously.\n\n\"I am strong now, Majella,\" answered Alessandro. And indeed he did\nalready look like a renewed man, spite of all his fatigue and anxiety.\n\"I am no longer weak; and to-morrow I will sleep, and you shall watch.\"\n\n\"Will you lie on the fern-bed then?\" asked Ramona, gleefully.\n\n\"I would like the ground better,\" said honest Alessandro.\n\nRamona looked disappointed. \"That is very strange,\" she said. \"It is\nnot so soft, this bed of boughs, that one need fear to be made tender by\nlying on it,\" she continued, throwing herself down; \"but oh, how sweet,\nhow sweet it smells!\"\n\n\"Yes, there is spice-wood in it,\" he answered. \"I put it in at the head,\nfor Majella's pillow.\"\n\nRamona was very tired, and she was happy. All night long she slept\nlike a child. She did not hear Alessandro's steps. She did not hear\nthe crackling of the fire he lighted. She did not hear the barking of\nCapitan, who more than once, spite of all Alessandro could do to quiet\nhim, made the canon echo with sharp, quick notes of warning, as he heard\nthe stealthy steps of wild creatures in the chaparral. Hour after hour\nshe slept on. And hour after hour Alessandro sat leaning against a huge\nsycamore-trunk, and watched her. As the fitful firelight played over her\nface, he thought he had never seen it so beautiful, Its expression of\ncalm repose insensibly soothed and strengthened him. She looked like a\nsaint, he thought; perhaps it was as a saint of help and guidance, the\nVirgin was sending her to him and his people. The darkness deepened,\nbecame blackness; only the red gleams from the fire broke it, in swaying\nrifts, as the wind makes rifts in black storm-clouds in the heavens.\nWith the darkness, the stillness also deepened. Nothing broke that,\nexcept an occasional motion of Baba or the pony, or an alert signal from\nCapitan; then all seemed stiller than ever. Alessandro felt as if God\nhimself were in the canon. Countless times in his life before he had\nlain in lonely places under the sky and watched the night through, but\nhe never felt like this. It was ecstasy, and yet it was pain. What was\nto come on the morrow, and the next morrow, and the next, and the next,\nall through the coming years? What was to come to this beloved and\nloving woman who lay there sleeping, so confident, so trustful, guarded\nonly by him,--by him, Alessandro, the exile, fugitive, homeless man?\n\nBefore the dawn, wood-doves began their calling. The canon was full\nof them, no two notes quite alike, it seemed to Alessandro's sharpened\nsense; pair after pair, he fancied that he recognized, speaking and\nreplying, as did the pair whose voices had so comforted him the night he\nwatched under the geranium hedge by the Moreno chapel,--\"Love?\" \"Here!\"\n\"Love?\" \"Here!\" They comforted him still more now. \"They too have only\neach other,\" he thought, as he bent his eyes lovingly on Ramona's face.\n\nIt was dawn, and past dawn, on the plains, before it was yet morning\ntwilight in the canon; but the birds in the upper boughs' of the\nsycamores caught the tokens of the coming day, and began to twitter in\nthe dusk. Their notes fell on Ramona's sleeping ear, like the familiar\nsound of the linnets in the veranda-thatch at home, and waked her\ninstantly. Sitting up bewildered, and looking about her, she exclaimed,\n\"Oh, is it morning already, and so dark? The birds can see more sky than\nwe! Sing, Alessandro,\" and she began the hymn:--\n\n\"'Singers at dawn From the heavens above People all regions; Gladly we\ntoo sing.'\"\n\nNever went up truer invocation, from sweeter spot.\n\n\"Sing not so loud, my Majel,\" whispered Alessandro, as her voice went\ncarolling like a lark's in the pure ether. \"There might be hunters near\nwho would hear;\" and he joined in with low and muffled tones.\n\nAs she dropped her voice at this caution, it seemed even sweeter than\nbefore:--\n\n     \"'Come, O sinners,\n     Come, and we will sing\n     Tender hymns\n     To our refuge,'\"\n\n\"Ah, Majella, there is no sinner here, except me!\" said Alessandro. \"My\nMajella is like one of the Virgin's own saints.\" And indeed he might\nhave been forgiven the thought as he gazed at Ramona, sitting there in\nthe shimmering light, her face thrown out into relief by the gray wall\nof fern-draped rock behind her; her splendid hair, unbound, falling in\ntangled masses to her waist; her cheeks flushed, her face radiant with\ndevout and fervent supplication, her eyes uplifted to the narrow belt of\nsky overhead, where filmy vapors were turning to gold, touched by a sun\nshe could not see.\n\n\"Hush, my love,\" she breathed rather than said. \"That would be a sin, if\nyou really thought it.\n\n     'O beautiful Queen,\n     Princess of Heaven,'\"\n\nshe continued, repeating the first lines of the song; and then, sinking\non her knees, reached out one hand for Alessandro's, and glided, almost\nwithout a break in the melodious sound, into a low recitative of the\nmorning-prayers. Her rosary was of fine-chased gold beads, with an ivory\ncrucifix; a rare and precious relic of the Missions' olden times. It\nhad belonged to Father Peyri himself, was given by him to Father\nSalvierderra, and by Father Salvierderra to the \"blessed child,\" Ramona,\nat her confirmation. A warmer token of his love and trust he could not\nhave bestowed upon her, and to Ramona's religious and affectionate\nheart it had always seemed a bond and an assurance, not only of Father\nSalvierderra's love, but of the love and protection of the now sainted\nPeyri.\n\nAs she pronounced the last words of her trusting prayer, and slipped the\nlast of the golden beads along on its string, a thread of sunlight\nshot into the canon through a deep narrow gap in its rocky eastern\ncrest,--shot in for a second, no more; fell aslant the rosary, lighted\nit; by a flash as if of fire, across the fine-cut facets of the beads,\non Ramona's hands, and on the white face of the ivory Christ. Only a\nflash, and it was gone! To both Ramona and Alessandro it came like an\nomen,--like a message straight from the Virgin. Could she choose better\nmessenger,--she, the compassionate one, the loving woman in heaven;\nmother of the Christ to whom they prayed, through her,--mother, for\nwhose sake He would regard their least cry,--could she choose better\nmessenger, or swifter, than the sunbeam, to say that she heard and would\nhelp them in these sore straits.\n\nPerhaps there were not, in the whole great world, at that moment to be\nfound, two souls who were experiencing so vivid a happiness as thrilled\nthe veins of these two friendless ones, on their knees, alone in the\nwilderness, gazing half awe-stricken at the shining rosary.\n\n\n\n\nXVII\n\nBEFORE the end of their second day in the canon, the place had become to\nRamona so like a friendly home, that she dreaded to leave its shelter.\nNothing is stronger proof of the original intent of Nature to do more\nfor man than the civilization in its arrogance will long permit her to\ndo, than the quick and sure way in which she reclaims his affection,\nwhen by weariness, idle chance, or disaster, he is returned, for an\ninterval, to her arms. How soon he rejects the miserable subterfuges of\nwhat he had called habits; sheds the still more miserable pretences of\nsuperiority, makeshifts of adornment, and chains of custom! \"Whom the\ngods love, die young,\" has been too long carelessly said. It is not\ntrue, in the sense in which men use the words. Whom the gods love, dwell\nwith nature; if they are ever lured away, return to her before they are\nold. Then, however long they live before they die, they die young. Whom\nthe gods love, live young--forever.\n\nWith the insight of a lover added to the instinct of the Indian,\nAlessandro saw how, hour by hour, there grew in Ramona's eyes the wonted\nlook of one at home; how she watched the shadows, and knew what they\nmeant.\n\n\"If we lived here, the walls would be sun-dials for us, would they not?\"\nshe said, in a tone of pleasure. \"I see that yon tall yucca has gone in\nshadow sooner than it did yesterday.\"\n\nAnd, \"What millions of things grow here, Alessandro! I did not know\nthere were so many. Have they all names? The nuns taught us some names;\nbut they were hard, and I forgot them, We might name them for ourselves,\nif we lived here. They would be our relations.\"\n\nAnd, \"For one year I should lie and look up at the sky, my Alessandro,\nand do nothing else. It hardly seems as if it would be a sin to do\nnothing for a year, if one gazed steadily at the sky all the while.\"\n\nAnd, \"Now I know what it is I have always seen in your face, Alessandro.\nIt is the look from the sky. One must be always serious and not unhappy,\nbut never too glad, I think, when he lives with nothing between him and\nthe sky, and the saints can see him every minute.\"\n\nAnd, \"I cannot believe that it is but two days I have lived in the\nair, Alessandro. This seems to me the first home I have ever had. Is it\nbecause I am Indian, Alessandro, that it gives me such joy?\"\n\nIt was strange how many more words Ramona spoke than Alessandro, yet how\nfull she felt their intercourse to be. His silence was more than silent;\nit was taciturn. Yet she always felt herself answered. A monosyllable\nof Alessandro's, nay, a look, told what other men took long sentences to\nsay, and said less eloquently.\n\nAfter long thinking over this, she exclaimed, \"You speak as the trees\nspeak, and like the rock yonder, and the flowers, without saying\nanything!\"\n\nThis delighted Alessandro's very heart. \"And you, Majella,\" he\nexclaimed; \"when you say that, you speak in the language of our people;\nyou are as we are.\"\n\nAnd Ramona, in her turn, was made happy by his words,--happier than she\nwould have been made by any other praise or fondness.\n\nAlessandro found himself regaining all his strength as if by a miracle.\nThe gaunt look had left his face. Almost it seemed that its contour was\nalready fuller. There is a beautiful old Gaelic legend of a Fairy who\nwooed a Prince, came again and again to him, and, herself invisible to\nall but the Prince, hovered in the air, sang loving songs to draw him\naway from the crowd of his indignant nobles, who heard her voice and\nsummoned magicians to rout her by all spells and enchantments at their\ncommand. Finally they succeeded in silencing her and driving her off;\nbut as she vanished from the Prince's sight she threw him an apple,--a\nmagic golden apple. Once having tasted of this, he refused all other\nfood. Day after day, night after night, he ate only this golden apple;\nand yet, morning after morning, evening after evening, there lay the\ngolden fruit, still whole and shining, as if he had not fed upon it;\nand when the Fairy came the next time, the Prince leaped into her magic\nboat, sailed away with her, and never was seen in his kingdom again. It\nwas only an allegory, this legend,--a beautiful allegory, and true,--of\nlove and lovers. The food on which Alessandro was, hour by hour, now\ngrowing strong, was as magic and invisible as Prince Connla's apple, and\njust as strength-giving.\n\n\"My Alessandro, how is it you look so well, so soon?\" said Ramona,\nstudying his countenance with loving care. \"I thought that night you\nwould die. Now you look nearly strong as ever; your eyes shine, and your\nhand is not hot! It is the blessed air; it has cured you, as it cured\nFelipe of the fever.\"\n\n\"If the air could keep me well, I had not been ill, Majella,\" replied\nAlessandro. \"I had been under no roof except the tule-shed, till I saw\nyou. It is not the air;\" and he looked at her with a gaze that said the\nrest.\n\nAt twilight of the third day, when Ramona saw Alessandro leading up\nBaba, saddled ready for the journey, the tears filled her eyes. At noon\nAlessandro had said to her: \"To-night, Majella, we must go. There is not\ngrass enough for another day. We must go while the horses are strong. I\ndare not lead them any farther down the canon to graze, for there is\na ranch only a few miles lower. To-day I found one of the man's cows\nfeeding near Baba.\"\n\nRamona made no remonstrance. The necessity was too evident; but the\nlook on her face gave Alessandro a new pang. He, too, felt as if exiled\nafresh in leaving the spot. And now, as he led the horses slowly up, and\nsaw Ramona sitting in a dejected attitude beside the nets in which were\nagain carefully packed their small stores, his heart ached anew. Again\nthe sense of his homeless and destitute condition settled like an\nunbearable burden on his soul. Whither and to what was he leading his\nMajella?\n\nBut once in the saddle, Ramona recovered cheerfulness. Baba was in\nsuch gay heart, she could not be wholly sad. The horse seemed fairly\nrollicking with satisfaction at being once more on the move. Capitan,\ntoo, was gay. He had found the canon dull, spite of its refreshing\nshade and cool water. He longed for sheep. He did not understand this\ninactivity. The puzzled look on his face had made Ramona laugh more than\nonce, as he would come and stand before her, wagging his tail and fixing\nhis eyes intently on her face, as if he said in so many words, \"What\nin the world are you about in this canon, and do not you ever intend to\nreturn home? Or if you will stay here, why not keep sheep? Do you not\nsee that I have nothing to do?\"\n\n\"We must ride all night, Majella,\" said Alessandro, \"and lose no time.\nIt is a long way to the place where we shall stay to-morrow.\"\n\n\"Is it a canon?\" asked Ramona, hopefully.\n\n\"No,\" he replied, \"not a canon; but there are beautiful oak-trees. It\nis where we get our acorns for the winter. It is on the top of a high\nhill.\"\n\n\"Will it be safe there?\" she asked.\n\n\"I think so,\" he replied; \"though not so safe as here. There is no such\nplace as this in all the country.\"\n\n\"And then where shall we go next?\" she asked.\n\n\"That is very near Temecula,\" he said. \"We must go into Temecula, dear\nMajella. I must go to Mr. Hartsel's. He is friendly. He will give me\nmoney for my father's violin. If it were not for that, I would never go\nnear the place again.\"\n\n\"I would like to see it, Alessandro,\" she said gently.\n\n\"Oh, no, no, Majella!\" he cried; \"you would not. It is terrible; the\nhouses all unroofed,--all but my father's and Jose's. They were\nshingled roofs; they will be just the same; all the rest are only walls.\nAntonio's mother threw hers down; I don't know how the old woman ever\nhad the strength; they said she was like a fury. She said nobody should\never live in those walls again; and she took a pole, and made a great\nhole in one side, and then she ran Antonio's wagon against it with all\nher might, till it fell in. No, Majella. It will be dreadful.\"\n\n\"Wouldn't you like to go into the graveyard again, Alessandro?\" she said\ntimidly.\n\n\"The saints forbid!\" he said solemnly. \"I think it would make me a\nmurderer to stand in that graveyard! If I had not you, my Majel, I\nshould kill some white man when I came out. Oh, do not speak of it!\" he\nadded, after a moment's silence; \"it takes the strength all out of my\nblood again, Majella. It feels as if I should die!\"\n\nAnd the word \"Temecula\" was not mentioned between them again until dusk\nthe next day, when, as they were riding slowly along between low, wooded\nhills, they suddenly came to an opening, a green, marshy place, with\na little thread of trickling water, at which their horses stopped, and\ndrank thirstily; and Ramona, looking ahead, saw lights twinkling in the\ndistance. \"Lights, Alessandro, lights!\" she exclaimed, pointing to them.\n\n\"Yes, Majella,\" he replied, \"it is Temecula,\" and springing off his pony\nhe came to her side, and putting both his hands on hers, said: \"I have\nbeen thinking, for a long way back, Carita, what is to be done here. I\ndo not know. What does Majella think will be wise? If men have been sent\nout to pursue us, they may be at Hartsel's. His store is the place where\neverybody stops, everybody goes. I dare not have you go there, Majella;\nyet I must go. The only way I can get any money is from Mr. Hartsel.\"\n\n\"I must wait somewhere while you go!\" said Ramona, her heart beating as\nshe gazed ahead into the blackness of the great plain. It looked vast as\nthe sea. \"That is the only safe thing, Alessandro.\"\n\n\"I think so too,\" he said; \"but, oh, I am afraid for you; and will not\nyou be afraid?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" she replied, \"I am afraid. But it is not so dangerous as the\nother.\"\n\n\"If anything were to happen to me, and I could not come back to you,\nMajella, if you give Baba his reins he will take you safe home,--he and\nCapitan.\"\n\nRamona shrieked aloud. She had not thought of this possibility.\nAlessandro had thought of everything. \"What could happen?\" she cried.\n\n\"I mean if the men were there, and if they took me for stealing the\nhorse,\" he said.\n\n\"But you would not have the horse with you,\" she said. \"How could they\ntake you?\"\n\n\"That mightn't make any difference,\" replied Alessandro. \"They might\ntake me, to make me tell where the horse was.\"\n\n\"Oh, Alessandro,\" sobbed Ramona, \"what shall we do!\" Then in another\nsecond, gathering her courage, she exclaimed, \"Alessandro, I know what\nI will do. I will stay in the graveyard. No one will come there. Shall I\nnot be safest there?\"\n\n\"Holy Virgin! would my Majel stay there?\" exclaimed Alessandro.\n\n\"Why not?\" she said. \"It is not the dead that will harm us. They would\nall help us if they could. I have no fear. I will wait there while you\ngo; and if you do not come in an hour, I will come to Mr. Hartsel's\nafter you. If there are men of the Senora's there, they will know me;\nthey will not dare to touch me. They will know that Felipe would punish\nthem. I will not be afraid. And if they are ordered to take Baba, they\ncan have him; we can walk when the pony is tired.\"\n\nHer confidence was contagious. \"My wood-dove has in her breast the heart\nof the lion,\" said Alessandro, fondly. \"We will do as she says. She\nis wise;\" and he turned their horses' heads in the direction of the\ngraveyard. It was surrounded by a low adobe wall, with one small gate\nof wooden paling. As they reached it, Alessandro exclaimed, \"The thieves\nhave taken the gate!\"\n\n\"What could they have wanted with that?\" said Ramona\n\n\"To burn,\" he said doggedly, \"It was wood; but it was very little. They\nmight have left the graves safe from wild beasts and cattle!\"\n\nAs they entered the enclosure, a dark figure rose from one of the\ngraves. Ramona started.\n\n\"Fear nothing,\" whispered Alessandro. \"It must be one of our people. I\nam glad; now you will not be alone. It is Carmena, I am sure. That was\nthe corner where they buried Jose. I will speak to her;\" and leaving\nRamona at the gate, he went slowly on, saying in a low voice, in\nthe Luiseno language, \"Carmena, is that you? Have no fear. It is I,\nAlessandro!\"\n\nIt was Carmena. The poor creature, nearly crazed with grief, was\nspending her days by her baby's grave in Pachanga, and her nights by her\nhusband's in Temecula. She dared not come to Temecula by day, for the\nAmericans were there, and she feared them. After a short talk with her,\nAlessandro returned, leading her along. Bringing her to Ramona's side,\nhe laid her feverish hand in Ramona's, and said: \"Majella, I have told\nher all. She cannot speak a word of Spanish, but she is very glad, she\nsays, that you have come with me, and she will stay close by your side\ntill I come back.\"\n\nRamona's tender heart ached with desire to comfort the girl; but all\nshe could do was to press her hand in silence. Even in the darkness she\ncould see the hollow, mournful eyes and the wasted cheek. Words are less\nneedful to sorrow than to joy. Carmena felt in every fibre how Ramona\nwas pitying her. Presently she made a gentle motion, as if to draw her\nfrom the saddle. Ramona bent down and looked inquiringly into her face.\nAgain she drew her gently with one hand, and with the other pointed to\nthe corner from which she had come. Ramona understood. \"She wants to\nshow me her husband's grave,\" she thought. \"She does not like to be away\nfrom it. I will go with her.\"\n\nDismounting, and taking Baba's bridle over her arm, she bowed her head\nassentingly, and still keeping firm hold of Carmena's hand, followed\nher. The graves were thick, and irregularly placed, each mound marked\nby a small wooden cross. Carmena led with the swift step of one who knew\neach inch of the way by heart. More than once Ramona stumbled and nearly\nfell, and Baba was impatient and restive at the strange inequalities\nunder his feet. When they reached the corner, Ramona saw the fresh-piled\nearth of the new grave. Uttering a wailing cry, Carmena, drawing Ramona\nto the edge of it, pointing down with her right hand, then laid both\nhands on her heart, and gazed at Ramona piteously. Ramona burst into\nweeping, and again clasping Carmena's hand, laid it on her own breast,\nto show her sympathy. Carmena did not weep. She was long past that;\nand she felt for the moment lifted out of herself by the sweet, sudden\nsympathy of this stranger,--this girl like herself, yet so different,\nso wonderful, so beautiful, Carmena was sure she must be. Had the saints\nsent her from heaven to Alessandro? What did it mean? Carmena's bosom\nwas heaving with the things she longed to say and to ask; but all she\ncould do was to press Ramona's hand again and again, and occasionally\nlay her soft cheek upon it.\n\n\"Now, was it not the saints that put it into my head to come to the\ngraveyard?\" thought Ramona. \"What a comfort to this poor heart-broken\nthing to see Alessandro! And she keeps me from all fear. Holy Virgin!\nbut I had died of terror here all alone. Not that the dead would harm\nme; but simply from the vast, silent plain, and the gloom.\"\n\nSoon Carmena made signs to Ramona that they would return to the gate.\nConsiderate and thoughtful, she remembered that Alessandro would expect\nto find them there. But it was a long and weary watch they had, waiting\nfor Alessandro to come.\n\nAfter leaving them, and tethering his pony, he had struck off at a\nquick run for Hartsel's, which was perhaps an eighth of a mile from the\ngraveyard. His own old home lay a little to the right. As he drew near,\nhe saw a light in its windows. He stopped as if shot. \"A light in our\nhouse!\" he exclaimed; and he clenched his hands. \"Those cursed robbers\nhave gone into it to live already!\" His blood seemed turning to fire.\nRamona would not have recognized the face of her Alessandro now. It was\nfull of implacable vengeance. Involuntarily he felt for his knife. It\nwas gone. His gun he had left inside the graveyard, leaning against the\nwall. Ah! in the graveyard! Yes, and there also was Ramona waiting for\nhim. Thoughts of vengeance fled. The world held now but one work, one\nhope, one passion, for him. But he would at least see who were these\ndwellers in his father's house. A fierce desire to see their faces\nburned within him. Why should he thus torture himself? Why, indeed? But\nhe must. He would see the new home-life already begun on the grave of\nhis. Stealthily creeping under the window from which the light shone, he\nlistened. He heard children's voices; a woman's voice; at intervals the\nvoice of a man, gruff and surly; various household sounds also. It was\nevidently the supper-hour. Cautiously raising himself till his eyes were\non a level with the lowest panes in the window, he looked in.\n\nA table was set in the middle of the floor, and there were sitting at it\na man, woman, and two children. The youngest, little more than a baby,\nsat in its high chair, drumming with a spoon on the table, impatient for\nits supper. The room was in great confusion,--beds made on the floor,\nopen boxes half unpacked, saddles and harness thrown down in the\ncorners; evidently there were new-comers into the house. The window\nwas open by an inch. It had warped, and would not shut down. Bitterly\nAlessandro recollected how he had put off from day to day the planing\nof that window to make it shut tight. Now, thanks to the crack, he could\nhear all that was said. The woman looked weary and worn. Her face was a\nsensitive one, and her voice kindly; but the man had the countenance\nof a brute,--of a human brute. Why do we malign the so-called brute\ncreation, making their names a unit of comparison for base traits which\nnever one of them possessed?\n\n\"It seems as if I never should get to rights in this world!\" said the\nwoman. Alessandro understood enough English to gather the meaning of\nwhat she said. He listened eagerly. \"When will the next wagon get here?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" growled her husband. \"There's been a slide in that\ncursed canon, and blocked the road. They won't be here for several days\nyet. Hain't you got stuff enough round now? If you'd clear up what's\nhere now, then 'twould be time enough to grumble because you hadn't got\neverything.\"\n\n\"But, John,\" she replied, \"I can't clear up till the bureau comes, to\nput the things away in, and the bedstead. I can't seem to do anything.\"\n\n\"You can grumble, I take notice,\" he answered. \"That's about all you\nwomen are good for, anyhow. There was a first-rate raw-hide bedstead\nin here. If Rothsaker hadn't been such a fool's to let those dogs of\nIndians carry off all their truck, we might have had that!\"\n\nThe woman looked at him reproachfully, but did not speak for a moment.\nThen her cheeks flushed, and seeming unable to repress the speech, she\nexclaimed, \"Well, I'm thankful enough he did let the poor things take\ntheir furniture. I'd never have slept a wink an that bedstead, I know,\nif it had ha' been left here. It's bad enough to take their houses this\nway!\"\n\n\"Oh, you shut up your head for a blamed fool, will you!\" cried the man.\nHe was half drunk, his worst and most dangerous state. She glanced at\nhim half timorously, half indignantly, and turning to the children,\nbegan feeding the baby. At that second the other child looked up, and\ncatching sight of the outline of Alessandro's head, cried out, \"There's\na man there! There, at the window!\"\n\nAlessandro threw himself flat on the ground, and held his breath. Had\nhe imperilled all, brought danger on himself and Ramona, by yielding to\nthis mad impulse to look once more inside the walls of his home? With\na fearful oath, the half-drunken man exclaimed, \"One of those damned\nIndians, I expect. I've seen several hangin' round to-day. We'll have to\nshoot two or three of 'em yet, before we're rid of 'em!\" and he took his\ngun down from the pegs above the fireplace, and went to the door with it\nin his hand.\n\n\"Oh, don't fire, father, don't.\" cried the woman. \"They'll come and\nmurder us all in our sleep if you do! Don't fire!\" and she pulled him\nback by the sleeve.\n\nShaking her off, with another oath, he stepped across the threshold, and\nstood listening, and peering into the darkness. Alessandro's heart beat\nlike a hammer in his breast. Except for the thought of Ramona, he would\nhave sprung on the man, seized his gun, and killed him.\n\n\"I don't believe it was anybody, after all, father,\" persisted the\nwoman. \"Bud's always seein' things. I don't believe there was anybody\nthere. Come in; supper's gettin' all cold.\"\n\n\"Well, I'll jest fire, to let 'em know there's powder 'n shot round\nhere,\" said the fiend. \"If it hits any on 'em roamin' round, he won't\nknow what hurt him;\" and levelling his gun at random, with his drunken,\nunsteady hand he fired. The bullet whistled away harmlessly into\nthe empty darkness. Hearkening a few moments, and hearing no cry, he\nhiccuped, \"Mi-i-issed him that time,\" and went in to his supper.\n\nAlessandro did not dare to stir for a long time. How he cursed his own\nfolly in having brought himself into this plight! What needless pain of\nwaiting he was inflicting on the faithful one, watching for him in that\ndesolate and fearful place of graves! At last he ventured,--sliding\nalong on his belly a few inches at a time, till, several rods from the\nhouse, he dared at last to spring to his feet and bound away at full\nspeed for Hartsel's.\n\nHartsel's was one of those mongrel establishments to be seen nowhere\nexcept in Southern California. Half shop, half farm, half tavern, it\ngathered up to itself all the threads of the life of the whole region.\nIndians, ranchmen, travellers of all sorts, traded at Hartsel's, drank\nat Hartsel's, slept at Hartsel's. It was the only place of its kind\nwithin a radius of twenty miles; and it was the least bad place of its\nkind within a much wider radius.\n\nHartsel was by no means a bad fellow--when he was sober; but as that\ncondition was not so frequent as it should have been, he sometimes came\nnear being a very bad fellow indeed. At such times everybody was afraid\nof him,--wife, children, travellers, ranchmen, and all. \"It was only a\nquestion of time and occasion,\" they said, \"Hartsel's killing somebody\nsooner or later;\" and it looked as if the time were drawing near\nfast. But, out of his cups, Hartsel was kindly, and fairly truthful;\nentertaining, too, to a degree which held many a wayfarer chained to his\nchair till small hours of the morning, listening to his landlord's talk.\nHow he had drifted from Alsace to San Diego County, he could hardly have\ntold in minute detail himself, there had been so many stages and phases\nof the strange journey; but he had come to his last halt now. Here, in\nthis Temecula, he would lay his bones. He liked the country. He liked\nthe wild life, and, for a wonder, he liked the Indians. Many a good word\nhe spoke for them to travellers who believed no good of the race, and\nevidently listened with polite incredulity when he would say, as he\noften did: \"I've never lost a dollar off these Indians yet. They do all\ntheir trading with me. There's some of them I trust as high's a hundred\ndollars. If they can't pay this year, they'll pay next; and if they die,\ntheir relations will pay their debts for them, a little at a time, till\nthey've got it all paid off. They'll pay in wheat, or bring a steer,\nmaybe, or baskets or mats the women make; but they'll pay. They're\nhonester 'n the general run of Mexicans about paying; I mean Mexicans\nthat are as poor's they are.\"\n\nHartsel's dwelling-house was a long, low adobe building, with still\nlower flanking additions, in which were bedrooms for travellers, the\nkitchen, and storerooms. The shop was a separate building, of rough\nplanks, a story and a half high, the loft of which was one great\ndormitory well provided with beds on the floor, but with no other\narticle of bedroom furniture. They who slept in this loft had no\nfastidious standards of personal luxury. These two buildings, with some\nhalf-dozen out-houses of one sort and another, stood in an enclosure\nsurrounded by a low white picket fence, which gave to the place a\ncertain home-like look, spite of the neglected condition of the ground,\nwhich was bare sand, or sparsely tufted with weeds and wild grass. A few\nplants, parched and straggling, stood in pots and tin cans around the\ndoor of the dwelling-house. One hardly knew whether they made the place\nlook less desolate or more so. But they were token of a woman's\nhand, and of a nature which craved something more than the unredeemed\nwilderness around her afforded.\n\nA dull and lurid light streamed out from the wide-open door of the\nstore. Alessandro drew cautiously near. The place was full of men, and\nhe heard loud laughing and talking. He dared not go in. Stealing around\nto the rear, he leaped the fence, and went to the other house and opened\nthe kitchen door. Here he was not afraid. Mrs. Hartsel had never any but\nIndian servants in her employ. The kitchen was lighted only by one\ndim candle. On the stove were sputtering and hissing all the pots and\nfrying-pans it would hold. Much cooking was evidently going on for the\nmen who were noisily rollicking in the other house.\n\nSeating himself by the fire, Alessandro waited. In a few moments Mrs.\nHartsel came hurrying back to her work. It was no uncommon experience to\nfind an Indian quietly sitting by her fire. In the dim light she did not\nrecognize Alessandro, but mistook him, as he sat bowed over, his head in\nhis hands, for old Ramon, who was a sort of recognized hanger-on of the\nplace, earning his living there by odd jobs of fetching and carrying,\nand anything else he could do.\n\n\"Run, Ramon,\" she said, \"and bring me more wood; this cotton wood is so\ndry, it burns out like rotten punk; I'm off my feet to-night, with all\nthese men to cook for;\" then turning to the table, she began cutting\nher bread, and did not see how tall and unlike Ramon was the man who\nsilently rose and went out to do her bidding. When, a few moments later,\nAlessandro re-entered, bringing a huge armful of wood, which it would\nhave cost poor old Ramon three journeys at least to bring, and throwing\nit down, on the hearth, said, \"Will that be enough, Mrs. Hartsel?\"\nshe gave a scream of surprise, and dropped her knife. \"Why, who--\" she\nbegan; then, seeing his face, her own lighting up with pleasure, she\ncontinued, \"Alessandro! Is it you? Why, I took you in the dark for old\nRamon! I thought you were in Pachanga.\"\n\n\"In Pachanga!\" Then as yet no one had come from the Senora Moreno's to\nHartsel's in search of him and the Senorita Ramona! Alessandro's heart\nfelt almost light in his bosom, From the one immediate danger he had\ndreaded, they were safe; but no trace of emotion showed on his face, and\nhe did not raise his eyes as he replied; \"I have been in Pachanga. My\nfather is dead. I have buried him there.\"\n\n\"Oh, Alessandro! Did he die?\" cried the kindly woman, coming closer to\nAlessandro, and laying her hand on his shoulder. \"I heard he was sick.\"\nShe paused; she did not know what to say. She had suffered so at the\ntime of the ejectment of the Indians, that it had made her ill. For two\ndays she had kept her doors shut and her windows close curtained, that\nshe need not see the terrible sights. She was not a woman of many words.\nShe was a Mexican, but there were those who said that some Indian blood\nran in her veins. This was not improbable; and it seemed more than ever\nprobable now, as she stood still by Alessandro's side, her hand on his\nshoulder, her eyes fixed in distress on his face. How he had altered!\nHow well she recollected his lithe figure, his alert motion, his superb\nbearing, his handsome face, when she last saw him in the spring!\n\n\"You were away all summer, Alessandro?\" she said at last, turning back\nto her work.\n\n\"Yes,\" he said: \"at the Senora Moreno's.\"\n\n\"So I heard,\" she said. \"That is a fine great place, is it not? Is her\nson grown a fine man? He was a lad when I saw him. He went through here\nwith a drove of sheep once.\"\n\n\"Ay, he is a man now,\" said Alessandro, and buried his face in his hands\nagain.\n\n\"Poor fellow! I don't wonder he does not want to speak,\" thought Mrs.\nHartsel. \"I'll just let him alone;\" and she spoke no more for some\nmoments.\n\nAlessandro sat still by the fire. A strange apathy seemed to have seized\nhim; at last he said wearily: \"I must be going now. I wanted to see Mr.\nHartsel a minute, but he seems to be busy in the store.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" she said, \"a lot of San Francisco men; they belong to the company\nthat's coming in here in the valley; they've been here two days. Oh,\nAlessandro,\" she continued, bethinking herself, \"Jim's got your violin\nhere; Jose brought it.\"\n\n\"Yes, I know it,\" answered Alessandro. \"Jose told me; and that was one\nthing I stopped for.\"\n\n\"I'll run and get it,\" she exclaimed.\n\n\"No,\" said Alessandro, in a slow, husky voice. \"I do not want it. I\nthought Mr. Hartsel might buy it. I want some money. It was not mine; it\nwas my father's. It is a great deal better than mine. My father said it\nwould bring a great deal of money. It is very old.\"\n\n\"Indeed it is,\" she replied; \"one of those men in there was looking at\nit last night. He was astonished at it, and he would not believe Jim\nwhen he told him about its having come from the Mission.\"\n\n\"Does he play? Will he buy it?\" cried Alessandro.\n\n\"I don't know; I'll call Jim,\" she said; and running out she looked in\nat the other door, saying, \"Jim! Jim!\"\n\nAlas, Jim was in no condition to reply. At her first glance in his face,\nher countenance hardened into an expression of disgust and defiance.\nReturning to the kitchen, she said scornfully, disdaining all disguises,\n\"Jim's drunk. No use your talking to him to-night. Wait till morning.\"\n\n\"Till morning!\" A groan escaped from Alessandro, in spite of himself. \"I\ncan't!\" he cried. \"I must go on to-night.\"\n\n\"Why, what for?\" exclaimed Mrs. Hartsel, much astonished. For one brief\nsecond Alessandro revolved in his mind the idea of confiding everything\nto her; only for a second, however. No; the fewer knew his secret and\nRamona's, the better.\n\n\"I must be in San Diego to-morrow,\" he said.\n\n\"Got work there?\" she said.\n\n\"Yes; that is, in San Pasquale,\" he said; \"and I ought to have been\nthere three days ago.\"\n\nMrs. Hartsel mused. \"Jim can't do anything to-night,\" she said; \"that's\ncertain. You might see the man yourself, and ask him if he'd buy it.\"\n\nAlessandro shook his head. An invincible repugnance withheld him.\nHe could not face one of these Americans who were \"coming in\" to his\nvalley. Mrs. Hartsel understood.\n\n\"I'll tell you, Alessandro,\" said the kindly woman, \"I'll give you what\nmoney you need to-night, and then, if you say so, Jim'll sell the violin\nto-morrow, if the man wants it, and you can pay me back out of that, and\nwhen you're along this way again you can have the rest. Jim'll make as\ngood a trade for you's he can. He's a real good friend to all of you,\nAlessandro, when he's himself.\"\n\n\"I know it, Mrs. Hartsel. I'd trust Mr. Hartsel more than any other man\nin this country,\" said Alessandro. \"He's about the only white man I do\ntrust!\"\n\nMrs. Hartsel was fumbling in a deep pocket in her under-petticoat.\nGold-piece after gold-piece she drew out. \"Humph! Got more'n I thought\nI had,\" she said. \"I've kept all that's been paid in here to-day, for I\nknew Jim'd be drunk before night.\"\n\nAlessandro's eyes fastened on the gold. How he longed for an abundance\nof those little shining pieces for his Majella! He sighed as Mrs.\nHartsel counted them out on the table,--one, two, three, four, bright\nfive-dollar pieces.\n\n\"That is as much as I dare take,\" said Alessandro, when she put down\nthe fourth. \"Will you trust me for so much?\" he added sadly. \"You know I\nhave nothing left now. Mrs. Hartsel, I am only a beggar, till I get some\nwork to do.\"\n\nThe tears came into Mrs. Hartsel's eyes. \"It's a shame!\" she said,--\"a\nshame, Alessandro! Jim and I haven't thought of anything else, since it\nhappened. Jim says they'll never prosper, never. Trust you? Yes, indeed.\nJim and I'd trust you, or your father, the last day of our lives.\"\n\n\"I'm glad he is dead,\" said Alessandro, as he knotted the gold into\nhis handkerchief and put it into his bosom. \"But he was murdered, Mrs.\nHartsel,--murdered, just as much as if they had fired a bullet into\nhim.\"\n\n\"That's true.\" she exclaimed vehemently. \"I say so too; and so was Jose.\nThat's just what I said at the time,--that bullets would not be half so\ninhuman!\"\n\nThe words had hardly left her lips, when the door from the dining-room\nburst open, and a dozen men, headed by the drunken Jim, came stumbling,\nlaughing, reeling into the kitchen.\n\n\"Where's supper! Give us our supper! What are you about with your Indian\nhere? I'll teach you how to cook ham!\" stammered Jim, making a lurch\ntowards the stove. The men behind caught him and saved him. Eyeing the\ngroup with scorn, Mrs. Hartsel, who had not a cowardly nerve in her\nbody, said: \"Gentlemen, if you will take your seats at the table, I will\nbring in your supper immediately. It is all ready.\"\n\nOne or two of the soberer ones, shamed by her tone, led the rest back\ninto the dining-room, where, seating themselves, they began to pound the\ntable and swing the chairs, swearing, and singing ribald songs.\n\n\"Get off as quick as you can, Alessandro,\" whispered Mrs. Hartsel, as\nshe passed by him, standing like a statue, his eyes, full of hatred and\ncontempt, fixed on the tipsy group. \"You'd better go. There's no knowing\nwhat they'll do next.\"\n\n\"Are you not afraid?\" he said in a low tone.\n\n\"No!\" she said. \"I'm used to it. I can always manage Jim. And Ramon's\nround somewhere,--he and the bull-pups; if worse comes to worse, I can\ncall the dogs. These San Francisco fellows are always the worst to get\ndrunk. But you'd better get out of the way!\"\n\n\"And these are the men that have stolen our lands, and killed my father,\nand Jose, and Carmena's baby!\" thought Alessandro, as he ran swiftly\nback towards the graveyard. \"And Father Salvierderra says, God is good.\nIt must be the saints no longer pray to Him for us!\"\n\nBut Alessandro's heart was too full of other thoughts, now, to dwell\nlong on past wrongs, however bitter. The present called him too\nloudly. Putting his hand in his bosom, and feeling the soft, knotted\nhandkerchief, he thought: \"Twenty dollars! It is not much! But it will\nbuy food for many days for my Majella and for Baba!\"\n\n\n\n\nXVIII\n\nEXCEPT for the reassuring help of Carmena's presence by her side, Ramona\nwould never have had courage to remain during this long hour in the\ngraveyard. As it was, she twice resolved to bear the suspense no longer,\nand made a movement to go. The chance of Alessandro's encountering at\nHartsel's the men sent in pursuit of him and of Baba, loomed in her\nthoughts into a more and more frightful danger each moment she reflected\nupon it. It was a most unfortunate suggestion for Alessandro to have\nmade. Her excited fancy went on and on, picturing the possible scenes\nwhich might be going on almost within stone's-throw of where she was\nsitting, helpless, in the midnight darkness,--Alessandro seized, tied,\ntreated as a thief, and she, Ramona, not there to vindicate him, to\nterrify the men into letting him go. She could not bear it; she would\nride boldly to Hartsel's door. But when she made a motion as if she\nwould go, and said in the soft Spanish, of which Carmena knew no word,\nbut which yet somehow conveyed Ramona's meaning, \"I must go! It is too\nlong! I cannot wait here!\" Carmena had clasped her hand tighter, and\nsaid in the San Luiseno tongue, of which Ramona knew no word, but which\nyet somehow conveyed Carmena's meaning, \"O beloved lady, you must not\ngo! Waiting is the only safe thing. Alessandro said, to wait here. He\nwill come.\" The word \"Alessandro\" was plain. Yes, Alessandro had said,\nwait; Carmena was right. She would obey, but it was a fearful ordeal. It\nwas strange how Ramona, who felt herself preternaturally brave, afraid\nof nothing, so long as Alessandro was by her side, became timorous and\nwretched the instant he was lost to her sight. When she first heard his\nsteps coming, she quivered with terror lest they might not be his. The\nnext second she knew; and with a glad cry, \"Alessandro! Alessandro!\" she\nbounded to him, dropping Baba's reins.\n\nSighing gently, Carmena picked up the reins, and stood still, holding\nthe horse, while the lovers clasped each other with breathless words.\n\"How she loves Alessandro!\" thought the widowed Carmena. \"Will they\nleave him alive to stay with her? It is better not to love!\" But there\nwas no bitter envy in her mind for the two who were thus blest while she\nwent desolate. All of Pablo's people had great affection for Alessandro.\nThey had looked forward to his being over them in his father's place.\nThey knew his goodness, and were proud of his superiority to themselves.\n\n\"Majella, you tremble,\" said Alessandro, as he threw his arms around\nher. \"You have feared! Yet you were not alone.\" He glanced at Carmena's\nmotionless figure, standing by Baba.\n\n\"No, not alone, dear Alessandro, but it was so long!\" replied Ramona;\n\"and I feared the men had taken you, as you feared. Was there any one\nthere?\"\n\n\"No! No one has heard anything. All was well. They thought I had just\ncome from Pachanga,\" he answered.\n\n\"Except for Carmena, I should have ridden after you half an hour ago,\"\ncontinued Ramona. \"But she told me to wait.\"\n\n\"She told you!\" repeated Alessandro. \"How did you understand her\nspeech?\"\n\n\"I do not know. Was it not a strange thing?\" replied Ramona. \"She spoke\nin your tongue, but I thought I understood her, Ask her if she did not\nsay that I must not go; that it was safer to wait; that you had so said,\nand you would soon come.\"\n\nAlessandro repeated the words to Carmena. \"Did you say that?\" he asked.\n\n\"Yes,\" answered Carmena.\n\n\"You see, then, she has understood the Luiseno words,\" he said\ndelightedly. \"She is one of us.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Carmena, gravely, \"she is one of us.\" Then, taking Ramona's\nhand in both of her own for farewell, she repeated, in a tone as of dire\nprophecy, \"One of us, Alessandro! one of us!\" And as she gazed after\ntheir retreating forms, almost immediately swallowed and lost in the\ndarkness, she repeated the words again to herself,--\"One of us! one of\nus! Sorrow came to me; she rides to meet it!\" and she crept back to her\nhusband's grave, and threw herself down, to watch till the dawn.\n\nThe road which Alessandro would naturally have taken would carry them\ndirectly by Hartsel's again. But, wishing to avoid all risk of meeting\nor being seen by any of the men on the place, he struck well out to\nthe north, to make a wide circuit around it. This brought them past\nthe place where Antonio's house had stood. Here Alessandro halted, and\nputting his hand on Baba's rein, walked the horses close to the pile of\nruined walls. \"This was Antonio's house, Majella,\" he whispered. \"I wish\nevery house in the valley had been pulled down like this. Old Juana was\nright. The Americans are living in my father's house, Majella,\" he went\non, his whisper growing thick with rage. \"That was what kept me so long.\nI was looking in at the window at them eating their supper. I thought I\nshould go mad, Majella. If I had had my gun, I should have shot them all\ndead!\"\n\nAn almost inarticulate gasp was Ramona's first reply to this. \"Living in\nyour house!\" she said. \"You saw them?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" he said; \"the man, and his wife, and two little children; and the\nman came out, with his gun, on the doorstep, and fired it. They thought\nthey heard something moving, and it might be an Indian; so he fired.\nThat was what kept me so long.\"\n\nJust at this moment Baba tripped over some small object on the ground.\nA few steps farther, and he tripped again. \"There is something caught\nround his foot, Alessandro,\" said Ramona. \"It keeps moving.\"\n\nAlessandro jumped off his horse, and kneeling down, exclaimed, \"It's a\nstake,--and the lariat fastened to it. Holy Virgin! what--\" The rest of\nhis ejaculation was inaudible. The next Ramona knew, he had run swiftly\non, a rod or two. Baba had followed, and Capitan and the pony; and there\nstood a splendid black horse, as big as Baba, and Alessandro talking\nunder his breath to him, and clapping both his hands over the horse's\nnose, to stop him, as often as he began whinnying; and it seemed hardly\na second more before he had his saddle off the poor little Indian pony,\nand striking it sharply on its sides had turned it free, had saddled\nthe black horse, and leaping on his back, said, with almost a sob in his\nvoice: \"My Majella, it is Benito, my own Benito. Now the saints indeed\nhave helped us! Oh, the ass, the idiot, to stake out Benito with such a\nstake as that! A jack rabbit had pulled it up. Now, my Majella, we will\ngallop! Faster! faster! I will not breathe easy till we are out of this\ncursed valley. When we are once in the Santa Margarita Canon, I know a\ntrail they will never find!\"\n\nLike the wind galloped Benito,--Alessandro half lying on his back,\nstroking his forehead, whispering to him, the horse snorting with joy:\nwhich were gladder of the two, horse or man, could not be said. And\nneck by neck with Benito came Baba. How the ground flew away under their\nfeet! This was companionship, indeed, worthy of Baba's best powers.\nNot in all the California herds could be found two superber horses\nthan Benito and Baba. A wild, almost reckless joy took possession of\nAlessandro. Ramona was half terrified as she heard him still talking,\ntalking to Benito. For an hour they did not draw rein. Both Benito\nand Alessandro knew every inch of the ground. Then, just as they had\ndescended into the deepest part of the canon, Alessandro suddenly reined\nsharply to the left, and began climbing the precipitous wall. \"Can you\nfollow, dearest Majella?\" he cried.\n\n\"Do you suppose Benito can do anything that Baba cannot?\" she retorted,\npressing on closely.\n\nBut Baba did not like it. Except for the stimulus of Benito ahead, he\nwould have given Ramona trouble.\n\n\"There is only a little, rough like this, dear,\" called Alessandro, as\nhe leaped a fallen tree, and halted to see how Baba took it. \"Good!\" he\ncried, as Baba jumped it like a deer. \"Good! Majella! We have got the\ntwo best horses in the country. You'll see they are alike, when daylight\ncomes. I have often wondered they were so much alike. They would go\ntogether splendidly.\"\n\nAfter a few rods of this steep climbing they came out on the top of\nthe canon's south wall, in a dense oak forest comparatively free from\nunderbrush. \"Now,\" said Alessandro, \"I can go from here to San Diego by\npaths that no white man knows. We will be near there before daylight.\"\n\nAlready the keen salt air of the ocean smote their faces. Ramona drank\nit in with delight. \"I taste salt in the air, Alessandro,\" she cried.\n\n\"Yes, it is the sea,\" he said. \"This canon leads straight to the sea. I\nwish we could go by the shore, Majella. It is beautiful there. When it\nis still, the waves come as gently to the land as if they were in play;\nand you can ride along with your horse's feet in the water, and the\ngreen cliffs almost over your head; and the air off the water is like\nwine in one's head.\"\n\n\"Cannot we go there?\" she said longingly. \"Would it not be safe?\"\n\n\"I dare not,\" he answered regretfully. \"Not now, Majella; for on the\nshore-way, at all times, there are people going and coming.\"\n\n\"Some other time, Alessandro, we can come, after we are married, and\nthere is no danger?\" she asked.\n\n\"Yes, Majella,\" he replied; but as he spoke the words, he thought, \"Will\na time ever come when there will be no danger?\"\n\nThe shore of the Pacific Ocean for many miles north of San Diego is a\nsuccession of rounding promontories, walling the mouths of canons, down\nmany of which small streams make to the sea. These canons are green and\nrich at bottom, and filled with trees, chiefly oak. Beginning as little\nmore than rifts in the ground, they deepen and widen, till at their\nmouths they have a beautiful crescent of shining beach from an eighth to\na quarter of a mile long, The one which Alessandro hoped to reach\nbefore morning was not a dozen miles from the old town of San Diego, and\ncommanded a fine view of the outer harbor. When he was last in it, he\nhad found it a nearly impenetrable thicket of young oak-trees. Here, he\nbelieved, they could hide safely all day, and after nightfall ride into\nSan Diego, be married at the priest's house, and push on to San Pasquale\nthat same night. \"All day, in that canon, Majella can look at the sea,\"\nhe thought; \"but I will not tell her now, for it may be the trees have\nbeen cut down, and we cannot be so close to the shore.\"\n\nIt was near sunrise when they reached the place. The trees had not been\ncut down. Their tops, seen from above, looked like a solid bed of moss\nfilling in the canon bottom. The sky and the sea were both red. As\nRamona looked down into this soft green pathway, it seemed, leading out\nto the wide and sparkling sea, she thought Alessandro had brought her\ninto a fairy-land.\n\n\"What a beautiful world!\" she cried; and riding up so close to Benito\nthat she could lay her hand on Alessandro's, she said solemnly: \"Do you\nnot think we ought to be very happy, Alessandro, in such a beautiful\nworld as this? Do you think we might sing our sunrise hymn here?\"\n\nAlessandro glanced around. They were alone on the breezy open; it was\nnot yet full dawn; great masses of crimson vapor were floating upward\nfrom the hills behind San Diego. The light was still burning in the\nlight-house on the promontory walling the inner harbor, but in a few\nmoments more it would be day. \"No, Majella, not here.\" he said. \"We must\nnot stay. As soon as the sun rises, a man or a horse may be seen on this\nupper coast-line as far as eye can reach. We must be among the trees\nwith all the speed we can make.\"\n\nIt was like a house with a high, thick roof of oak tree-tops, the\nshelter they found. No sun penetrated it; a tiny trickle of water still\nremained, and some grass along its rims was still green, spite of the\nlong drought,--a scanty meal for Baba and Benito, but they ate it with\nrelish in each other's company.\n\n\"They like each other, those two,\" said Ramona, laughing, as she watched\nthem. \"They will be friends.\"\n\n\"Ay,\" said Alessandro, also smiling. \"Horses are friends, like men, and\ncan hate each other, like men, too. Benito would never see Antonio's\nmare, the little yellow one, that he did not let fly his heels at her;\nand she was as afraid, at sight of him, as a cat is at a dog. Many a\ntime I have laughed to see it.\"\n\n\"Know you the priest at San Diego?\" asked Ramona.\n\n\"Not well,\" replied Alessandro. \"He came seldom to Temecula when I was\nthere; but he is a friend of Indians. I know he came with the men from\nSan Diego at the time when there was fighting, and the whites were in\ngreat terror; and they said, except for Father Gaspara's words, there\nwould not have been a white man left alive in Pala. My father had sent\nall his people away before that fight began. He knew it was coming, but\nhe would have nothing to do with it. He said the Indians were all crazy.\nIt was no use. They would only be killed themselves. That is the worst\nthing, my Majella. The stupid Indians fight and kill, and then what can\nwe do? The white men think we are all the same. Father Gaspara has never\nbeen to Pala, I heard, since that time. There goes there now the\nSan Juan Capistrano priest. He is a bad man. He takes money from the\nstarving poor.\"\n\n\"A priest!\" ejaculated Ramona, horror-stricken.\n\n\"Ay! a priest!\" replied Alessandro. \"They are not all good,--not like\nFather Salvierderra.\"\n\n\"Oh, if we could but have gone to Father Salvierderra!\" exclaimed\nRamona, involuntarily.\n\nAlessandro looked distressed. \"It would have been much more danger,\nMajella,\" he said, \"and I had no knowledge of work I could do there.\"\n\nHis look made Ramona remorseful at once. How cruel to lay one\nfeather-weight of additional burden on this loving man. \"Oh, this is\nmuch better, really,\" she said. \"I did not mean what I said. It is only\nbecause I have always loved Father Salvierderra so. And the Senora will\ntell him what is not true. Could we not send him a letter, Alessandro?\"\n\n\"There is a Santa Inez Indian I know,\" replied Alessandro, \"who comes\ndown with nets to sell, sometimes, to Temecula. I know not if he goes\nto San Diego. If I could get speech with him, he would go up from Santa\nInez to Santa Barbara for me, I am sure; for once he lay in my father's\nhouse, sick for many weeks, and I nursed him, and since then he is\nalways begging me to take a net from him, whenever he comes. It is not\ntwo days from Santa Inez to Santa Barbara.\"\n\n\"I wish it were the olden time now, Alessandro,\" sighed Ramona, \"when\nthe men like Father Salvierderra had all the country. Then there would\nbe work for all, at the Missions. The Senora says the Missions were like\npalaces, and that there were thousands of Indians in every one of them;\nthousands and thousands, all working so happy and peaceful.\"\n\n\"The Senora does not know all that happened at the Missions,\" replied\nAlessandro. \"My father says that at some of them were dreadful things,\nwhen bad men had power. Never any such things at San Luis Rey. Father\nPeyri was like a father to all his Indians. My father says that they\nwould all of them lie down in a fire for him, if he had commanded it.\nAnd when he went away, to leave the country, when his heart was broken,\nand the Mission all ruined, he had to fly by night, Majella, just as you\nand I have done; for if the Indians had known it, they would have risen\nup to keep him. There was a ship here in San Diego harbor, to sail for\nMexico, and the Father made up his mind to go in it; and it was over\nthis same road we have come, my Majella, that he rode, and by night; and\nmy father was the only one he trusted to know it. My father came with\nhim; they took the swiftest horses, and they rode all night, and my\nfather carried in front of him, on the horse, a box of the sacred things\nof the altar, very heavy. And many a time my father has told me the\nstory, how they got to San Diego at daybreak, and the Father was rowed\nout to the ship in a little boat; and not much more than on board was\nhe, my father standing like one dead on the shore, watching, he loved\nhim so, when, lo! he heard a great crying, and shouting, and trampling\nof horses' feet, and there came galloping down to the water's edge three\nhundred of the Indians from San Luis Rey, who had found out that the\nFather had gone to San Diego to take ship, and they had ridden all night\non his track, to fetch him back. And when my father pointed to the ship,\nand told them he was already on board, they set up a cry fit to bring\nthe very sky down; and some of them flung themselves into the sea, and\nswam out to the ship, and cried and begged to be taken on board and go\nwith him. And Father Peyri stood on the deck, blessing them, and\nsaying farewell, with the tears running on his face; and one of the\nIndians--how they never knew--made shift to climb up on the chains\nand ropes, and got into the ship itself; and they let him stay, and\nhe sailed away with the Father. And my father said he was all his life\nsorry that he himself had not thought to do the same thing; but he\nwas like one dumb and deaf and with no head, he was so unhappy at the\nFather's going.\"\n\n\"Was it here, in this very harbor?\" asked Ramona, in breathless\ninterest, pointing out towards the blue water of which they could see a\nbroad belt framed by their leafy foreground arch of oak tops.\n\n\"Ay, just there he sailed,--as that ship goes now,\" he exclaimed, as a\nwhite-sailed schooner sailed swiftly by, going out to sea. \"But the ship\nlay at first inside the bar; you cannot see the inside harbor from here.\nIt is the most beautiful water I have ever seen, Majella. The two high\nlands come out like two arms to hold it and keep it safe, as if they\nloved it.\"\n\n\"But, Alessandro,\" continued Ramona, \"were there really bad men at the\nother Missions? Surely not the Franciscan Fathers?\"\n\n\"Perhaps not the Fathers themselves, but the men under them. It was\ntoo much power, Majella. When my father has told me how it was, it has\nseemed to me I should not have liked to be as he was. It is not right\nthat one man should have so much power. There was one at the San Gabriel\nMission; he was an Indian. He had been set over the rest; and when a\nwhole band of them ran away one time, and went back into the mountains,\nhe went after them; and he brought back a piece of each man's ear; the\npieces were strung on a string; and he laughed, and said that was to\nknow them by again,--by their clipped ears. An old woman, a Gabrieleno,\nwho came over to Temecula, told me she saw that. She lived at the\nMission herself. The Indians did not all want to come to the Missions;\nsome of them preferred to stay in the woods, and live as they always\nhad lived; and I think they had a right to do that if they preferred,\nMajella. It was stupid of them to stay and be like beasts, and not know\nanything; but do you not think they had the right?\"\n\n\"It is the command to preach the gospel to every creature,\" replied the\npious Ramona. \"That is what Father Salvierderra said was the reason\nthe Franciscans came here. I think they ought to have made the Indians\nlisten. But that was dreadful about the ears, Alessandro. Do you believe\nit?\"\n\n\"The old woman laughed when she told it,\" he answered. \"She said it was\na joke; so I think it was true. I know I would have killed the man who\ntried to crop my ears that way.\"\n\n\"Did you ever tell that to Father Salvierderra?\" asked Ramona.\n\n\"No, Majella. It would not be polite,\" said Alessandro.\n\n\"Well, I don't believe it,\" replied Ramona, in a relieved tone. \"I don't\nbelieve any Franciscan ever could have permitted such things.\"\n\nThe great red light in the light-house tower had again blazed out,\nand had been some time burning before Alessandro thought it prudent to\nresume their journey. The road on which they must go into old San Diego,\nwhere Father Gaspara lived, was the public road from San Diego to San\nLuis Rey, and they were almost sure to meet travellers on it.\n\nBut their fleet horses bore them so well, that it was not late when they\nreached the town. Father Gaspara's house was at the end of a long, low\nadobe building, which had served no mean purpose in the old Presidio\ndays, but was now fallen into decay; and all its rooms except those\noccupied by the Father, had been long uninhabited. On the opposite\nside of the way, in a neglected, weedy open, stood his chapel,--a\npoverty-stricken little place, its walls imperfectly whitewashed,\ndecorated by a few coarse pictures and by broken sconces of\nlooking-glass, rescued in their dilapidated condition from the\nMission buildings, now gone utterly to ruin. In these had been put\nhandle-holders of common tin, in which a few cheap candles dimly lighted\nthe room. Everything about it was in unison with the atmosphere of the\nplace,--the most profoundly melancholy in all Southern California. Here\nwas the spot where that grand old Franciscan, Padre Junipero Serra,\nbegan his work, full of the devout and ardent purpose to reclaim the\nwilderness and its peoples to his country and his Church; on this very\nbeach he went up and down for those first terrible weeks, nursing\nthe sick, praying with the dying, and burying the dead, from the\npestilence-stricken Mexican ships lying in the harbor. Here he baptized\nhis first Indian converts, and founded his first Mission. And the only\ntraces now remaining of his heroic labors and hard-won successes were a\npile of crumbling ruins, a few old olive-trees and palms; in less than\nanother century even these would be gone; returned into the keeping of\nthat mother, the earth, who puts no head-stones at the sacredest of her\ngraves.\n\nFather Gaspara had been for many years at San Diego. Although not a\nFranciscan, having, indeed, no especial love for the order, he had been\nfrom the first deeply impressed by the holy associations of the place.\nHe had a nature at once fiery and poetic; there were but three things he\ncould have been,--a soldier, a poet, or a priest. Circumstances had made\nhim a priest; and the fire and the poetry which would have wielded the\nsword or kindled the verse, had he found himself set either to fight or\nto sing, had all gathered into added force in his priestly vocation.\nThe look of a soldier he had never quite lost,--neither the look nor the\ntread; and his flashing dark eyes, heavy black hair and beard, and\nquick elastic step, seemed sometimes strangely out of harmony with his\npriest's gown. And it was the sensitive soul of the poet in him which\nhad made him withdraw within himself more and more, year after year, as\nhe found himself comparatively powerless to do anything for the hundreds\nof Indians that he would fain have seen gathered once more, as of old,\ninto the keeping of the Church. He had made frequent visits to them in\ntheir shifting refuges, following up family after family, band after\nband, that he knew; he had written bootless letter after letter to the\nGovernment officials of one sort and another, at Washington. He had made\nequally bootless efforts to win some justice, some protection for them,\nfrom officials nearer home; he had endeavored to stir the Church itself\nto greater efficiency in their behalf. Finally, weary, disheartened,\nand indignant with that intense, suppressed indignation which the poetic\ntemperament alone can feel, he had ceased,--had said, \"It is of no use;\nI will speak no word; I am done; I can bear no more!\" and settling down\ninto the routine of his parochial duties to the little Mexican and Irish\ncongregation of his charge in San Diego, he had abandoned all effort to\ndo more for the Indians than visit their chief settlements once or twice\na year, to administer the sacraments. When fresh outrages were brought\nto his notice, he paced his room, plucked fiercely at his black beard,\nwith ejaculations, it is to be feared, savoring more of the camp than\nthe altar; but he made no effort to do anything. Lighting his pipe, he\nwould sit down on the old bench in his tile-paved veranda, and smoke\nby the hour, gazing out on the placid water of the deserted harbor,\nbrooding, ever brooding, over the wrongs he could not redress.\n\nA few paces off from his door stood the just begun walls of a fine\nbrick church, which it had been the dream and pride of his heart to\nsee builded, and full of worshippers. This, too, had failed. With San\nDiego's repeatedly vanishing hopes and dreams of prosperity had gone\nthis hope and dream of Father Gaspara's. It looked, now, as if it\nwould be indeed a waste of money to build a costly church on this site.\nSentiment, however sacred and loving towards the dead, must yield to\nthe demands of the living. To build a church on the ground where Father\nJunipero first trod and labored, would be a work to which no Catholic\ncould be indifferent; but there were other and more pressing claims to\nbe met first. This was right. Yet the sight of these silent walls, only\na few feet high, was a sore one to Father Gaspara,--a daily cross, which\nhe did not find grow lighter as he paced up and down his veranda, year\nin and year out, in the balmy winter and cool summer of that magic\nclimate.\n\n\"Majella, the chapel is lighted; but that is good!\" exclaimed\nAlessandro, as they rode into the silent plaza. \"Father Gaspara must\nbe there;\" and jumping off his horse, he peered in at the uncurtained\nwindow. \"A marriage, Majella,--a marriage!\" he cried, hastily returning.\n\"This, too, is good fortune. We need not to wait long.\"\n\nWhen the sacristan whispered to Father Gaspara that an Indian couple had\njust come in, wishing to be married, the Father frowned. His supper was\nwaiting; he had been out all day, over at the old Mission olive-orchard,\nwhere he had not found things to his mind; the Indian man and wife whom\nhe hired to take care of the few acres the Church yet owned there had\nbeen neglecting the Church lands and trees, to look after their own. The\nFather was vexed, tired, and hungry, and the expression with which he\nregarded Alessandro and Ramona, as they came towards him, was one of the\nleast prepossessing of which his dark face was capable. Ramona, who had\nnever knelt to any priest save the gentle Father Salvierderra, and who\nhad supposed that all priests must look, at least, friendly, was shocked\nat the sight of the impatient visage confronting her. But, as his first\nglance fell on Ramona, Father Gaspara's expression changed.\n\n\"What is all this!\" he thought; and as quick as he thought it, he\nexclaimed, in a severe tone, looking at Ramona, \"Woman, are you an\nIndian?\"\n\n\"Yes, Father,\" answered Ramona, gently. \"My mother was an Indian.\"\n\n\"Ah! half-breed!\" thought Father Gaspara. \"It is strange how sometimes\none of the types will conquer, and sometimes another! But this is no\ncommon creature;\" and it was with a look of new interest and sympathy\non his face that he proceeded with the ceremony,--the other couple, a\nmiddle-aged Irishman, with his more than middle-aged bride, standing\nquietly by, and looking on with a vague sort of wonder in their ugly,\nimpassive faces, as if it struck them oddly that Indians should marry.\n\nThe book of the marriage-records was kept in Father Gaspara's own rooms,\nlocked up and hidden even from his old housekeeper. He had had bitter\nreason to take this precaution. It had been for more than one man's\ninterest to cut leaves out of this old record, which dated back to 1769,\nand had many pages written full in the hand of Father Junipero himself.\n\nAs they came out of the chapel, Father Gaspara leading the way, the\nIrish couple shambling along shamefacedly apart from each other,\nAlessandro, still holding Ramona's hand in his, said, \"Will you ride,\ndear? It is but a step.\"\n\n\"No, thanks, dear Alessandro, I would rather walk,\" she replied; and\nAlessandro slipping the bridles of the two horses over his left arm,\nthey walked on. Father Gaspara heard the question and answer, and was\nstill more puzzled.\n\n\"He speaks as a gentleman speaks to a lady,\" he mused. \"What does it\nmean? Who are they?\"\n\nFather Gaspara was a well-born man, and in his home in Spain had been\nused to associations far superior to any which he had known in his\nCalifornian life, A gentle courtesy of tone and speech, such as that\nwith which Alessandro had addressed Ramona, was not often heard in\nhis parish. When they entered his house, he again regarded them both\nattentively. Ramona wore on her head the usual black shawl of the\nMexican women. There was nothing distinctive, to the Father's eye, in\nher figure or face. In the dim light of the one candle,--Father Gaspara\nallowed himself no luxuries,--the exquisite coloring of her skin and the\ndeep blue of her eyes were not to be seen. Alessandro's tall figure\nand dignified bearing were not uncommon. The Father had seen many as\nfine-looking Indian men. But his voice was remarkable, and he spoke\nbetter Spanish than was wont to be heard from Indians.\n\n\"Where are you from?\" said the Father, as he held his pen poised in\nhand, ready to write their names in the old raw-hide-bound book.\n\n\"Temecula, Father,\" replied Alessandro.\n\nFather Gaspara dropped his pen. \"The village the Americans drove out the\nother day?\" he cried.\n\n\"Yes, Father.\"\n\nFather Gaspara sprang from his chair, took refuge from his excitement,\nas usual, in pacing the floor. \"Go! go! I'm done with you! It's all\nover,\" he said fiercely to the Irish bride and groom, who had given him\ntheir names and their fee, but were still hanging about irresolute, not\nknowing if all were ended or not. \"A burning shame! The most dastardly\nthing I have seen yet in this land forsaken of God!\" cried the Father.\n\"I saw the particulars of it in the San Diego paper yesterday.\" Then,\ncoming to a halt in front of Alessandro, he exclaimed: \"The paper said\nthat the Indians were compelled to pay all the costs of the suit; that\nthe sheriff took their cattle to do it. Was that true?\"\n\n\"Yes, Father,\" replied Alessandro.\n\nThe Father strode up and down again, plucking at his beard. \"What are\nyou going to do?\" he said. \"Where have you all gone? There were two\nhundred in your village the last time I was there.\"\n\n\"Some have gone over into Pachanga,\" replied Alessandro, \"some to San\nPasquale, and the rest to San Bernardino.\"\n\n\"Body of Jesus! man! But you take it with philosophy!\" stormed Father\nGaspara.\n\nAlessandro did not understand the word \"philosophy,\" but he knew what\nthe Father meant. \"Yes, Father,\" he said doggedly. \"It is now twenty-one\ndays ago. I was not so at first. There is nothing to be done.\"\n\nRamona held tight to Alessandro's hand. She was afraid of this fierce,\nblack-bearded priest, who dashed back and forth, pouring out angry\ninvectives.\n\n\"The United States Government will suffer for it!\" he continued. \"It is\na Government of thieves and robbers! God will punish them. You will see;\nthey will be visited with a curse,--a curse in their borders; their sons\nand their daughters shall be desolate! But why do I prate in these vain\nwords? My son, tell me your names again;\" and he seated himself once\nmore at the table where the ancient marriage-record lay open.\n\nAfter writing Alessandro's name, he turned to Ramona. \"And the woman's?\"\nhe said.\n\nAlessandro looked at Ramona. In the chapel he had said simply,\n\"Majella.\" What name should he give more?\n\nWithout a second's hesitation, Ramona answered, \"Majella. Majella Phail\nis my name.\"\n\nShe pronounced the word \"Phail,\" slowly. It was new to her. She had\nnever seen it written; as it lingered on her lips, the Father, to\nwhom also it was a new word, misunderstood it, took it to be in two\nsyllables, and so wrote it.\n\nThe last step was taken in the disappearance of Ramona. How should any\none, searching in after years, find any trace of Ramona Ortegna, in the\nwoman married under the name of \"Majella Fayeel\"?\n\n\"No, no! Put up your money, son,\" said Father Gaspara, as Alessandro\nbegan to undo the knots of the handkerchief in which his gold was tied.\n\"Put up your money. I'll take no money from a Temecula Indian. I would\nthe Church had money to give you. Where are you going now?\"\n\n\"To San Pasquale, Father.\"\n\n\"Ah! San Pasquale! The head man there has the old pueblo paper,\" said\nFather Gaspara. \"He was showing it to me the other day. That will, it\nmay be, save you there. But do not trust to it, son. Buy yourself a\npiece of land as the white man buys his. Trust to nothing.\"\n\nAlessandro looked anxiously in the Father's face. \"How is that, Father?\"\nhe said. \"I do not know.\"\n\n\"Well, their rules be thick as the crabs here on the beach,\" replied\nFather Gaspara; \"and, faith, they appear to me to be backwards of motion\nalso, like the crabs: but the lawyers understand. When you have picked\nout your land, and have the money, come to me, and I will go with you\nand see that you are not cheated in the buying, so far as I can tell;\nbut I myself am at my wit's ends with their devices. Farewell, son!\nFarewell, daughter!\" he said, rising from his chair. Hunger was again\ngetting the better of sympathy in Father Gaspara, and as he sat down\nto his long-deferred supper, the Indian couple faded from his mind; but\nafter supper was over, as he sat smoking his pipe on the veranda, they\nreturned again, and lingered in his thoughts,--lingered strangely, it\nseemed to him; he could not shake off the impression that there was\nsomething unusual about the woman. \"I shall hear of them again, some\nday,\" he thought. And he thought rightly.\n\n\n\n\nXIX\n\nAFTER leaving Father Gaspara's door, Alessandro and Ramona rode slowly\nthrough the now deserted plaza, and turned northward, on the river road,\nleaving the old Presidio walls on their right. The river was low, and\nthey forded it without difficulty.\n\n\"I have seen this river so high that there was no fording it for many\ndays,\" said Alessandro; \"but that was in spring.\"\n\n\"Then it is well we came not at that time,\" said Ramona, \"All the times\nhave fallen out well for us, Alessandro,--the dark nights, and the\nstreams low; but look! as I say it, there comes the moon!\" and she\npointed to the fine threadlike arc of the new moon, just visible in the\nsky. \"Not big enough to do us any harm, however,\" she added. \"But, dear\nAlessandro, do you not think we are safe now?\"\n\n\"I know not, Majella, if ever we may be safe; but I hope so. I have been\nall day thinking I had gone foolish last night, when I told Mrs. Hartsel\nthat I was on my way to San Pasquale. But if men should come there\nasking for us, she would understand, I think, and keep a still tongue.\nShe would keep harm from us if she could.\"\n\nTheir way from San Diego to San Pasquale lay at first along a high mesa,\nor table-land, covered with low shrub growths; after some ten or twelve\nmiles of this, they descended among winding ridges, into a narrow\nvalley,--the Poway valley. It was here that the Mexicans made one of\ntheir few abortive efforts to repel the American forces.\n\n\"Here were some Americans killed, in a fight with the Mexicans,\nMajella,\" said Alessandro. \"I myself have a dozen bullets which I picked\nup in the ground about here. Many a time I have looked at them and\nthought if there should come another war against the Americans, I\nwould fire them again, if I could. Does Senor Felipe think there is\nany likelihood that his people will rise against them any more? If they\nwould, they would have all the Indians to help them, now. It would be a\nmercy if they might be driven out of the land, Majella.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" sighed Majella. \"But there is no hope. I have heard the Senora\nspeak of it with Felipe. There is no hope. They have power, and great\nriches, she said. Money is all that they think of. To get money, they\nwill commit any crime, even murder. Every day there comes the news of\ntheir murdering each other for gold. Mexicans kill each other only for\nhate, Alessandro,--for hate, or in anger; never for gold.\"\n\n\"Indians, also,\" replied Alessandro. \"Never one Indian killed another,\nyet, for money. It is for vengeance, always. For money! Bah! Majella,\nthey are dogs!\"\n\nRarely did Alessandro speak with such vehemence; but this last outrage\non his people had kindled in his veins a fire of scorn and hatred\nwhich would never die out. Trust in an American was henceforth to him\nimpossible. The name was a synonym for fraud and cruelty.\n\n\"They cannot all be so bad, I think, Alessandro,\" said Ramona. \"There\nmust be some that are honest; do you not think so?\"\n\n\"Where are they, then,\" he cried fiercely,--\"the ones who are good?\nAmong my people there are always some that are bad; but they are in\ndisgrace. My father punished them, the whole people punished them. If\nthere are Americans who are good, who will not cheat and kill, why do\nthey not send after these robbers and punish them? And how is it that\nthey make laws which cheat? It was the American law which took Temecula\naway from us, and gave it to those men! The law was on the side of the\nthieves. No, Majella, it is a people that steals! That is their name,--a\npeople that steals, and that kills for money. Is not that a good name\nfor a great people to bear, when they are like the sands in the sea,\nthey are so many?\"\n\n\"That is what the Senora says,\" answered Ramona. \"She says they are all\nthieves; that she knows not, each day, but that on the next will come\nmore of them, with new laws, to take away more of her land. She had once\nmore than twice what she has now, Alessandro.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" he replied; \"I know it. My father has told me. He was with Father\nPeyri at the place, when General Moreno was alive. Then all was his to\nthe sea,--all that land we rode over the second night, Majella.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" she said, \"all to the sea! That is what the Senora is ever\nsaying: 'To the sea!' Oh, the beautiful sea! Can we behold it from San\nPasquale, Alessandro?\"\n\n\"No, my Majella, it is too far. San Pasquale is in the valley; it has\nhills all around it like walls. But it is good. Majella will love it;\nand I will build a house, Majella. All the people will help me. That is\nthe way with our people. In two days it will be done. But it will be a\npoor place for my Majella,\" he said sadly. Alessandro's heart was ill at\nease. Truly a strange bride's journey was this; but Ramona felt no fear.\n\n\"No place can be so poor that I do not choose it, if you are there,\nrather than the most beautiful place in the world where you are not,\nAlessandro,\" she said.\n\n\"But my Majella loves things that are beautiful,\" said Alessandro. \"She\nhas lived like a queen.\"\n\n\"Oh, Alessandro,\" merrily laughed Ramona, \"how little you know of\nthe way queens live! Nothing was fine at the Senora Moreno's, only\ncomfortable; and any house you will build, I can make as comfortable\nas that was; it is nothing but trouble to have one so large as the\nSenora's. Margarita used to be tired to death, sweeping all those\nrooms in which nobody lived except the blessed old San Luis Rey saints.\nAlessandro, if we could have had just one statue, either Saint Francis\nor the Madonna, to bring back to our house! That is what I would like\nbetter than all other things in the world. It is beautiful to sleep with\nthe Madonna close to your bed. She speaks often to you in dreams.\"\n\nAlessandro fixed serious, questioning eyes on Ramona as she uttered\nthese words. When she spoke like this, he felt indeed as if a being of\nsome other sphere had come to dwell by his side. \"I cannot find how to\nfeel towards the saints as you do, my Majella,\" he said. \"I am afraid of\nthem. It must be because they love you, and do not love us. That is what\nI believe, Majella. I believe they are displeased with us, and no longer\nmake mention of us in heaven. That is what the Fathers taught that the\nsaints were ever doing,--praying to God for us, and to the Virgin and\nJesus. It is not possible, you see, that they could have been praying\nfor us, and yet such things have happened, as happened in Temecula. I do\nnot know how it is my people have displeased them.\"\n\n\"I think Father Salvierderra would say that it is a sin to be afraid of\nthe saints, Alessandro,\" replied Ramona, earnestly. \"He has often told\nme that it was a sin to be unhappy; and that withheld me many times from\nbeing wretched because the Senora would not love me. And, Alessandro,\"\nshe went on, growing more and more fervent in tone, \"even if nothing but\nmisfortune comes to people, that does not prove that the saints do not\nlove them; for when the saints were on earth themselves, look what they\nsuffered: martyrs they were, almost all of them. Look at what holy\nSaint Catharine endured, and the blessed Saint Agnes. It is not by what\nhappens to us here in this world that we can tell if the saints love us,\nor if we will see the Blessed Virgin.\"\n\n\"How can we tell, then?\" he asked.\n\n\"By what we feel in our hearts, Alessandro,\" she replied; \"just as I\nknew all the time, when you did not come,--I knew that you loved me.\nI knew that in my heart; and I shall always know it, no matter what\nhappens. If you are dead, I shall know that you love me. And you,--you\nwill know that I love you, the same.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Alessandro, reflectively, \"that is true. But, Majella, it is\nnot possible to have the same thoughts about a saint as about a person\nthat one has seen, and heard the voice, and touched the hand.\"\n\n\"No, not quite,\" said Ramona; \"not quite, about a saint; but one can\nfor the Blessed Virgin, Alessandro! I am sure of that. Her statue, in my\nroom at the Senora's, has been always my mother. Ever since I was little\nI have told her all I did. It was she helped me to plan what I should\nbring away with us. She reminded me of many things I had forgotten,\nexcept for her.\"\n\n\"Did you hear her speak?\" said Alessandro, awe-stricken.\n\n\"Not exactly in words; but just the same as in words,\" replied Ramona,\nconfidently. \"You see when you sleep in the room with her, it is very\ndifferent from what it is if you only see her in a chapel. Oh, I could\nnever be very unhappy with her in my room!\"\n\n\"I would almost go and steal it for you, Majella,\" cried Alessandro,\nwith sacrilegious warmth.\n\n\"Holy Virgin!\" cried Ramona, \"never speak such a word. You would be\nstruck dead if you laid your hand on her! I fear even the thought was a\nsin.\"\n\n\"There was a small figure of her in the wall of our house,\" said\nAlessandro. \"It was from San Luis Rey. I do not know what became of\nit,--if it were left behind, or if they took it with my father's things\nto Pachanga. I did not see it there. When I go again, I will look.\"\n\n\"Again!\" cried Ramona. \"What say you? You go again to Pachanga? You will\nnot leave me, Alessandro?\"\n\nAt the bare mention of Alessandro's leaving her, Ramona's courage always\nvanished. In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, she was transformed\nfrom the dauntless, confident, sunny woman, who bore him up as it were\non wings of hope and faith, to a timid, shrinking, despondent child,\ncrying out in alarm, and clinging to the hand.\n\n\"After a time, dear Majella, when you are wonted to the place, I must\ngo, to fetch the wagon and the few things that were ours. There is the\nraw-hide bed which was Father Peyri's, and he gave to my father. Majella\nwill like to lie on that. My father believed it had great virtue.\"\n\n\"Like that you made for Felipe?\" she asked.\n\n\"Yes; but it is not so large. In those days the cattle were not so\nlarge as they are now: this is not so broad as Senor Felipe's. There\nare chairs, too, from the Mission, three of them, one almost as fine\nas those on your veranda at home. They were given to my father. And\nmusic-books,--beautiful parchment books! Oh, I hope those are not lost,\nMajella! If Jose had lived, he would have looked after it all. But in\nthe confusion, all the things belonging to the village were thrown into\nwagons together, and no one knew where anything was. But all the people\nknew my father's chairs and the books of the music. If the Americans did\nnot steal them, everything will be safe. My people do not steal.\nThere was never but one thief in our village, and my father had him so\nwhipped, he ran away and never came back. I heard he was living in San\nJacinto, and was a thief yet, spite of all that whipping he had. I think\nif it is in the blood to be a thief, not even whipping will take it out,\nMajella.\"\n\n\"Like the Americans,\" she said, half laughing, but with tears in the\nvoice. \"Whipping would not cure them.\"\n\nIt wanted yet more than an hour of dawn when they reached the crest of\nthe hill from which they looked down on the San Pasquale valley. Two\nsuch crests and valleys they had passed; this was the broadest of the\nthree valleys, and the hills walling it were softer and rounder of\ncontour than any they had yet seen. To the east and northeast lay ranges\nof high mountains, their tops lost in the clouds. The whole sky was\novercast and gray.\n\n\"If it were spring, this would mean rain,\" said Alessandro; \"but it\ncannot rain, I think, now.\"\n\n\"No!\" laughed Ramona, \"not till we get our house done. Will it be of\nadobe, Alessandro?\"\n\n\"Dearest Majella, not yet! At first it must be of the tule. They are\nvery comfortable while it is warm, and before winter I will build one of\nadobe.\"\n\n\"Two houses! Wasteful Alessandro! If the tule house is good, I shall not\nlet you, Alessandro, build another.\"\n\nRamona's mirthful moments bewildered Alessandro. To his slower\ntemperament and saddened nature they seemed preternatural; as if she\nwere all of a sudden changed into a bird, or some gay creature outside\nthe pale of human life,--outside and above it.\n\n\"You speak as the birds sing, my Majella,\" he said slowly. \"It was well\nto name you Majel; only the wood-dove has not joy in her voice, as you\nhave. She says only that she loves and waits.\"\n\n\"I say that, too, Alessandro!\" replied Ramona, reaching out both her\narms towards him.\n\nThe horses were walking slowly, and very close side by side. Baba and\nBenito were now such friends they liked to pace closely side by side;\nand Baba and Benito were by no means without instinctive recognitions of\nthe sympathy between their riders. Already Benito knew Ramona's voice,\nand answered it with pleasure; and Baba had long ago learned to stop\nwhen his mistress laid her hand on Alessandro's shoulder. He stopped\nnow, and it was long minutes before he had the signal to go on again.\n\n\"Majella! Majella!\" cried Alessandro, as, grasping both her hands in\nhis, he held them to his cheeks, to his neck, to his mouth, \"if the\nsaints would ask Alessandro to be a martyr for Majella's sake, like\nthose she was telling of, then she would know if Alessandro loved her!\nBut what can Alessandro do now? What, oh, what? Majella gives all;\nAlessandro gives nothing!\" and he bowed his forehead on her hands,\nbefore he put them back gently on Baba's neck.\n\nTears filled Ramona's eyes. How should she win this saddened man, this\ndistrusting lover, to the joy which was his desert? \"Alessandro can\ndo one thing,\" she said, insensibly falling into his mode of\nspeaking,--\"one thing for his Majella: never, never say that he has\nnothing to give her. When he says that, he makes Majella a liar; for\nshe has said that he is all the world to her,--he himself all the world\nwhich she desires. Is Majella a liar?\"\n\nBut it was even now with an ecstasy only half joy, the other half\nanguish, that Alessandro replied: \"Majella cannot lie. Majella is like\nthe saints. Alessandro is hers.\"\n\nWhen they rode down into the valley, the whole village was astir. The\nvintage-time had nearly passed; everywhere were to be seen large, flat\nbaskets of grapes drying in the sun. Old women and children were turning\nthese, or pounding acorns in the deep stone bowls; others were beating\nthe yucca-stalks, and putting them to soak in water; the oldest women\nwere sitting on the ground, weaving baskets. There were not many men in\nthe village now; two large bands were away at work,--one at the autumn\nsheep-shearing, and one working on a large irrigating ditch at San\nBernardino.\n\nIn different directions from the village slow-moving herds of goats or\nof cattle could be seen, being driven to pasture on the hills; some men\nwere ploughing; several groups were at work building houses of bundles\nof the tule reeds.\n\n\"These are some of the Temecula people,\" said Alessandro; \"they\nare building themselves new houses here. See those piles of bundles\ndarker-colored than the rest. Those are their old roofs they brought\nfrom Temecula. There, there comes Ysidro!\" he cried joyfully, as a man,\nwell-mounted, who had been riding from point to point in the village,\ncame galloping towards them. As soon as Ysidro recognized Alessandro, he\nflung himself from his horse. Alessandro did the same, and both running\nswiftly towards each other till they met, they embraced silently.\nRamona, riding up, held out her hand, saying, as she did so, \"Ysidro?\"\n\nPleased, yet surprised, at this confident and assured greeting, Ysidro\nsaluted her, and turning to Alessandro, said in their own tongue, \"Who\nis this woman whom you bring, that has heard my name?\"\n\n\"My wife!\" answered Alessandro, in the same tongue. \"We were married\nlast night by Father Gaspara. She comes from the house of the Senora\nMoreno. We will live in San Pasquale, if you have land for me, as you\nhave said.\"\n\nWhat astonishment Ysidro felt, he showed none. Only a grave and\ncourteous welcome was in his face and in his words as he said, \"It\nis well. There is room. You are welcome.\" But when he heard the soft\nSpanish syllables in which Ramona spoke to Alessandro, and Alessandro,\ntranslating her words to him, said, \"Majel speaks only in the Spanish\ntongue, but she will learn ours,\" a look of disquiet passed over his\ncountenance. His heart feared for Alessandro, and he said, \"Is she,\nthen, not Indian? Whence got she the name of Majel?\"\n\nA look of swift intelligence from Alessandro reassured him. \"Indian on\nthe mother's side!\" said Alessandro, \"and she belongs in heart to our\npeople. She is alone, save for me. She is one blessed of the Virgin,\nYsidro. She will help us. The name Majel I have given her, for she is\nlike the wood-dove; and she is glad to lay her old name down forever, to\nbear this new name in our tongue.\"\n\nAnd this was Ramona's introduction to the Indian village,--this and her\nsmile; perhaps the smile did most. Even the little children were not\nafraid of her. The women, though shy, in the beginning, at sight of her\nnoble bearing, and her clothes of a kind and quality they associated\nonly with superiors, soon felt her friendliness, and, what was more,\nsaw by her every word, tone, look, that she was Alessandro's. If\nAlessandro's, theirs. She was one of them. Ramona would have been\nprofoundly impressed and touched, could she have heard them speaking\namong themselves about her; wondering how it had come about that she,\nso beautiful, and nurtured in the Moreno house, of which they all knew,\nshould be Alessandro's loving wife. It must be, they thought in their\nsimplicity, that the saints had sent it as an omen of good to the Indian\npeople. Toward night they came, bringing in a hand-barrow the most aged\nwoman in the village to look at her. She wished to see the beautiful\nstranger before the sun went down, they said, because she was now so old\nshe believed each night that before morning her time would come to die.\nThey also wished to hear the old woman's verdict on her. When Alessandro\nsaw them coming, he understood, and made haste to explain it to Ramona.\nWhile he was yet speaking, the procession arrived, and the aged woman in\nher strange litter was placed silently on the ground in front of Ramona,\nwho was sitting under Ysidro's great fig-tree. Those who had borne her\nwithdrew, and seated themselves a few paces off. Alessandro spoke\nfirst. In a few words he told the old woman of Ramona's birth, of their\nmarriage, and of her new name of adoption; then he said, \"Take her hand,\ndear Majella, if you feel no fear.\"\n\nThere was something scarcely human in the shrivelled arm and hand\noutstretched in greeting; but Ramona took it in hers with tender\nreverence: \"Say to her for me, Alessandro,\" she said, \"that I bow down\nto her great age with reverence, and that I hope, if it is the will of\nGod that I live on the earth so long as she has, I may be worthy of such\nreverence as these people all feel for her.\"\n\nAlessandro turned a grateful look on Ramona as he translated this\nspeech, so in unison with Indian modes of thought and feeling. A murmur\nof pleasure rose from the group of women sitting by. The aged woman made\nno reply; her eyes still studied Ramona's face, and she still held her\nhand.\n\n\"Tell her,\" continued Ramona, \"that I ask if there is anything I can do\nfor her. Say I will be her daughter if she will let me.\"\n\n\"It must be the Virgin herself that is teaching Majella what to say,\"\nthought Alessandro, as he repeated this in the San Luiseno tongue.\n\nAgain the women murmured pleasure, but the old woman spoke not. \"And say\nthat you will be her son,\" added Ramona.\n\nAlessandro said it. It was perhaps for this that the old woman had\nwaited. Lifting up her arm, like a sibyl, she said: \"It is well; I am\nyour mother. The winds of the valley shall love you, and the grass shall\ndance when you come. The daughter looks on her mother's face each day. I\nwill go;\" and making a sign to her bearers, she was lifted, and carried\nto her house.\n\nThe scene affected Ramona deeply. The simplest acts of these people\nseemed to her marvellously profound in their meanings. She was not\nherself sufficiently educated or versed in life to know why she was so\nmoved,--to know that such utterances, such symbolisms as these, among\nprimitive peoples, are thus impressive because they are truly and\ngrandly dramatic; but she was none the less stirred by them, because she\ncould not analyze or explain them.\n\n\"I will go and see her every day,\" she said; \"she shall be like my\nmother, whom I never saw.\"\n\n\"We must both go each day,\" said Alessandro. \"What we have said is a\nsolemn promise among my people; it would not be possible to break it.\"\n\nYsidro's home was in the centre of the village, on a slightly rising\nground; it was a picturesque group of four small houses, three of tule\nreeds and one of adobe,--the latter a comfortable little house of two\nrooms, with a floor and a shingled roof, both luxuries in San Pasquale.\nThe great fig-tree, whose luxuriance and size were noted far and near\nthroughout the country, stood half-way down the slope; but its boughs\nshaded all three of the tule houses. On one of its lower branches was\nfastened a dove-cote, ingeniously made of willow wands, plastered with\nadobe, and containing so many rooms that the whole tree seemed sometimes\na-flutter with doves and dovelings. Here and there, between the houses,\nwere huge baskets, larger than barrels, woven of twigs, as the eagle\nweaves its nest, only tighter and thicker. These were the outdoor\ngranaries; in these were kept acorns, barley, wheat, and corn. Ramona\nthought them, as well she might, the prettiest things she ever saw.\n\n\"Are they hard to make?\" she asked. \"Can you make them, Alessandro? I\nshall want many.\"\n\n\"All you want, my Majella,\" replied Alessandro. \"We will go together to\nget the twigs; I can, I dare say, buy some in the village. It is only\ntwo days to make a large one.\"\n\n\"No. Do not buy one,\" she exclaimed. \"I wish everything in our house\nto be made by ourselves.\" In which, again, Ramona was unconsciously\nstriking one of the keynotes of pleasure in the primitive harmonies of\nexistence.\n\nThe tule house which stood nearest to the dove-cote was, by a lucky\nchance, now empty. Ysidro's brother Ramon, who had occupied it, having\ngone with his wife and baby to San Bernardino, for the winter, to work;\nthis house Ysidro was but too happy to give to Alessandro till his own\nshould be done. It was a tiny place, though it was really two houses\njoined together by a roofed passage-way. In this passage-way the tidy\nJuana, Ramon's wife, kept her few pots and pans, and a small stove.\nIt looked to Ramona like a baby-house. Timidly Alessandro said: \"Can\nMajella live in this small place for a time? It will not be very long;\nthere are adobes already made.\"\n\nHis countenance cleared as Ramona replied gleefully, \"I think it will be\nvery comfortable, and I shall feel as if we were all doves together in\nthe dove-cote!\"\n\n\"Majel!\" exclaimed Alessandro; and that was all he said.\n\nOnly a few rods off stood the little chapel; in front of it swung on\na cross-bar from two slanting posts an old bronze bell which had once\nbelonged to the San Diego Mission. When Ramona read the date, \"1790,\" on\nits side, and heard that it was from the San Diego Mission church it had\ncome, she felt a sense of protection in its presence.\n\n\"Think, Alessandro,\" she said; \"this bell, no doubt, has rung many times\nfor the mass for the holy Father Junipero himself. It is a blessing to\nthe village. I want to live where I can see it all the time. It will be\nlike a saint's statue in the house.\"\n\nWith every allusion that Ramona made to the saints' statues,\nAlessandro's desire to procure one for her deepened. He said nothing;\nbut he revolved it in his mind continually. He had once gone with his\nshearers to San Fernando, and there he had seen in a room of the old\nMission buildings a dozen statues of saints huddled in dusty confusion.\nThe San Fernando church was in crumbled ruins, and such of the church\nproperties as were left there were in the keeping of a Mexican not\nover-careful, and not in the least devout. It would not trouble him to\npart with a saint or two, Alessandro thought, and no irreverence to\nthe saint either; on the contrary, the greatest of reverence, since\nthe statue was to be taken from a place where no one cared for it, and\nbrought into one where it would be tenderly cherished, and worshipped\nevery day. If only San Fernando were not so far away, and the wooden\nsaints so heavy! However, it should come about yet. Majella should\nhave a saint; nor distance nor difficulty should keep Alessandro from\nprocuring for his Majel the few things that lay within his power. But he\nheld his peace about it. It would be a sweeter gift, if she did not know\nit beforehand. He pleased himself as subtly and secretly as if he had\ncome of civilized generations, thinking how her eyes would dilate, if\nshe waked up some morning and saw the saint by her bedside; and how sure\nshe would be to think, at first, it was a miracle,--his dear, devout\nMajella, who, with all her superior knowledge, was yet more credulous\nthan he. All her education had not taught her to think, as he, untaught,\nhad learned, in his solitude with nature.\n\nBefore Alessandro had been two days in San Pasquale, he had heard of a\npiece of good-fortune which almost passed his belief, and which startled\nhim for once out of his usual impassive demeanor.\n\n\"You know I have a herd of cattle of your father's, and near a hundred\nsheep?\" said Ysidro.\n\n\"Holy Virgin!\" cried Alessandro, \"you do not mean that! How is that?\nThey told me all our stock was taken by the Americans.\"\n\n\"Yes, so it was, all that was in Temecula,\" replied Ysidro; \"but in the\nspring your father sent down to know if I would take a herd for him up\ninto the mountains, with ours, as he feared the Temecula pasture would\nfall short, and the people there, who could not leave, must have their\ncattle near home; so he sent a herd over,--I think, near fifty head;\nand many of the cows have calved; and he sent, also, a little flock of\nsheep,--a hundred, Ramon said; he herded them with ours all summer, and\nhe left a man up there with them. They will be down next week. It is\ntime they were sheared.\"\n\nBefore he had finished speaking, Alessandro had vanished, bounding like\na deer. Ysidro stared after him; but seeing him enter the doorway of the\nlittle tule hut, he understood, and a sad smile passed over his face. He\nwas not yet persuaded that this marriage of Alessandro's would turn out\na blessing. \"What are a handful of sheep to her!\" he thought.\n\nBreathless, panting, Alessandro burst into Ramona's presence. \"Majella!\nmy Majella! There are cattle--and sheep,\" he cried. \"The saints be\npraised! We are not like the beggars, as I said.\"\n\n\"I told you that God would give us food, dear Alessandro,\" replied\nRamona, gently.\n\n\"You do not wonder! You do not ask!\" he cried, astonished at her calm.\n\"Does Majella think that a sheep or a steer can come down from the\nskies?\"\n\n\"Nay, not as our eyes would see,\" she answered; \"but the holy ones who\nlive in the skies can do anything they like on the earth. Whence came\nthese cattle, and how are they ours?\"\n\nWhen he told her, her face grew solemn. \"Do you remember that night in\nthe willows,\" she said, \"when I was like one dying, because you would\nnot bring me with you? You had no faith that there would be food. And\nI told you then that the saints never forsook those who loved them, and\nthat God would give food. And even at that moment, when you did not know\nit, there were your cattle and your sheep feeding in the mountains,\nin the keeping of God! Will my Alessandro believe after this?\" and she\nthrew her arms around his neck and kissed him.\n\n\"It is true,\" said Alessandro. \"I will believe, after this, that the\nsaints love my Majella.\"\n\nBut as he walked at a slower pace back to Ysidro, he said to himself:\n\"Majella did not see Temecula. What would she have said about the\nsaints, if she had seen that, and seen the people dying for want of\nfood? It is only for her that the saints pray. They are displeased with\nmy people.\"\n\n\n\n\nXX\n\nONE year, and a half of another year, had passed. Sheep-shearings and\nvintages had been in San Pasquale; and Alessandro's new house, having\nbeen beaten on by the heavy spring rains, looked no longer new. It stood\non the south side of the valley,--too far, Ramona felt, from the blessed\nbell; but there had not been land enough for wheat-fields any nearer,\nand she could see the chapel, and the posts, and, on a clear day, the\nbell itself. The house was small. \"Small to hold so much joy,\" she said,\nwhen Alessandro first led her to it, and said, deprecatingly, \"It is\nsmall, Majella,--too small;\" and he recollected bitterly, as he spoke,\nthe size of Ramona's own room at the Senora's house. \"Too small,\" he\nrepeated.\n\n\"Very small to hold so much joy, my Alessandro,\" she laughed; \"but quite\nlarge enough to hold two persons.\"\n\nIt looked like a palace to the San Pasquale people, after Ramona had\narranged their little possessions in it; and she herself felt rich as\nshe looked around her two small rooms. The old San Luis Rey chairs\nand the raw-hide bedstead were there, and, most precious of all, the\nstatuette of the Madonna. For this Alessandro had built a niche in the\nwall, between the head of the bed and the one window. The niche was deep\nenough to hold small pots in front of the statuette; and Ramona kept\nconstantly growing there wild-cucumber plants, which wreathed and\nre-wreathed the niche till it looked like a bower. Below it hung her\ngold rosary and the ivory Christ; and many a woman of the village, when\nshe came to see Ramona, asked permission to go into the bedroom and say\nher prayers there; so that it finally came to be a sort of shrine for\nthe whole village.\n\nA broad veranda, as broad as the Senora's, ran across the front of the\nlittle house. This was the only thing for which Ramona had asked. She\ncould not quite fancy life without a veranda, and linnets in the thatch.\nBut the linnets had not yet come. In vain Ramona strewed food for them,\nand laid little trains of crumbs to lure them inside the posts; they\nwould not build nests inside. It was not their way in San Pasquale. They\nlived in the canons, but this part of the valley was too bare of trees\nfor them. \"In a year or two more, when we have orchards, they will\ncome,\" Alessandro said.\n\nWith the money from that first sheep-shearing, and from the sale of part\nof his cattle, Alessandro had bought all he needed in the way of farming\nimplements,--a good wagon and harnesses, and a plough. Baba and Benito,\nat first restive and indignant, soon made up their minds to work. Ramona\nhad talked to Baba about it as she would have talked to a brother. In\nfact, except for Ramona's help, it would have been a question whether\neven Alessandro could have made Baba work in harness. \"Good Baba!\"\nRamona said, as she slipped piece after piece of the harness over his\nneck,--\"Good Baba, you must help us; we have so much work to do, and\nyou are so strong! Good Baba, do you love me?\" and with one hand in his\nmane, and her cheek, every few steps, laid close to his, she led Baba up\nand down the first furrows he ploughed.\n\n\"My Senorita!\" thought Alessandro to himself, half in pain, half in\npride, as, running behind with the unevenly jerked plough, he watched\nher laughing face and blowing hair,--\"my Senorita!\"\n\nBut Ramona would not run with her hand in Baba's mane this winter. There\nwas a new work for her, indoors. In a rustic cradle, which Alessandro\nhad made, under her directions, of the woven twigs, like the great\noutdoor acorn-granaries, only closer woven, and of an oval shape, and\nlifted from the floor by four uprights of red manzanita stems,--in\nthis cradle, on soft white wool fleeces, covered with white homespun\nblankets, lay Ramona's baby, six months old, lusty, strong, and\nbeautiful, as only children born of great love and under healthful\nconditions can be. This child was a girl, to Alessandro's delight; to\nRamona's regret,--so far as a loving mother can feel regret connected\nwith her firstborn. Ramona had wished for an Alessandro; but the\ndisappointed wish faded out of her thoughts, hour by hour, as she gazed\ninto her baby-girl's blue eyes,--eyes so blue that their color was the\nfirst thing noticed by each person who looked at her.\n\n\"Eyes of the sky,\" exclaimed Ysidro, when he first saw her.\n\n\"Like the mother's,\" said Alessandro; on which Ysidro turned an\nastonished look upon Ramona, and saw for the first time that her eyes,\ntoo, were blue.\n\n\"Wonderful!\" he said. \"It is so. I never saw it;\" and he wondered in his\nheart what father it had been, who had given eyes like those to one born\nof an Indian mother.\n\n\"Eyes of the sky,\" became at once the baby's name in the village; and\nAlessandro and Ramona, before they knew it, had fallen into the way of\nso calling her. But when it came to the christening, they demurred. The\nnews was brought to the village, one Saturday, that Father Gaspara would\nhold services in the valley the next day, and that he wished all the\nnew-born babes to be brought for christening. Late into the night,\nAlessandro and Ramona sat by their sleeping baby and discussed what\nshould be her name. Ramona wondered that Alessandro did not wish to name\nher Majella.\n\n\"No! Never but one Majella,\" he said, in a tone which gave Ramona a\nsense of vague fear, it was so solemn.\n\nThey discussed \"Ramona,\" \"Isabella.\" Alessandro suggested Carmena. This\nhad been his mother's name.\n\nAt the mention of it Ramona shuddered, recollecting the scene in\nthe Temecula graveyard. \"Oh, no, no! Not that!\" she cried. \"It is\nill-fated;\" and Alessandro blamed himself for having forgotten her only\nassociation with the name.\n\nAt last Alessandro said: \"The people have named her, I think, Majella.\nWhatever name we give her in the chapel, she will never be called\nanything but 'Eyes of the Sky,' in the village.\"\n\n\"Let that name be her true one, then,\" said Ramona. And so it was\nsettled; and when Father Gaspara took the little one in his arms,\nand made the sign of the cross on her brow, he pronounced with some\ndifficulty the syllables of the Indian name, which meant \"Blue Eyes,\" or\n\"Eyes of the Sky.\"\n\nHeretofore, when Father Gaspara had come to San Pasquale to say mass, he\nhad slept at Lomax's, the store and post-office, six miles away, in the\nBernardo valley. But Ysidro, with great pride, had this time ridden to\nmeet him, to say that his cousin Alessandro, who had come to live in the\nvalley, and had a good new adobe house, begged that the Father would do\nhim the honor to stay with him.\n\n\"And indeed, Father,\" added Ysidro, \"you will be far better lodged and\nfed than in the house of Lomax. My cousin's wife knows well how all\nshould be done.\"\n\n\"Alessandro! Alessandro!\" said the Father, musingly. \"Has he been long\nmarried?\"\n\n\"No, Father,\" answered Ysidro. \"But little more than two years. They\nwere married by you, on their way from Temecula here.\"\n\n\"Ay, ay. I remember,\" said Father Gaspara. \"I will come;\" and it was\nwith no small interest that he looked forward to meeting again the\ncouple that had so strongly impressed him.\n\nRamona was full of eager interest in her preparations for entertaining\nthe priest. This was like the olden time; and as she busied herself with\nher cooking and other arrangements, the thought of Father Salvierderra\nwas much in her mind. She could, perhaps, hear news of him from Father\nGaspara. It was she who had suggested the idea to Alessandro; and when\nhe said, \"But where will you sleep yourself, with the child, Majella,\nif we give our room to the Father? I can lie on the floor outside; but\nyou?\"--\"I will go to Ysidro's, and sleep with Juana,\" she replied. \"For\ntwo nights, it is no matter; and it is such shame to have the Father\nsleep in the house of an American, when we have a good bed like this!\"\n\nSeldom in his life had Alessandro experienced such a sense of\ngratification as he did when he led Father Gaspara into his and Ramona's\nbedroom. The clean whitewashed walls, the bed neatly made, with broad\nlace on sheets and pillows, hung with curtains and a canopy of bright\nred calico, the old carved chairs, the Madonna shrine in its bower of\ngreen leaves, the shelves on the walls, the white-curtained window,--all\nmade up a picture such as Father Gaspara had never before seen in\nhis pilgrimages among the Indian villages. He could not restrain an\nejaculation of surprise. Then his eye falling on the golden rosary, he\nexclaimed, \"Where got you that?\"\n\n\"It is my wife's,\" replied Alessandro, proudly. \"It was given to her by\nFather Salvierderra.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" said the Father. \"He died the other day.\"\n\n\"Dead! Father Salvierderra dead!\" cried Alessandro. \"That will be a\nterrible blow. Oh, Father, I implore you not to speak of it in her\npresence. She must not know it till after the christening. It will make\nher heart heavy, so that she will have no joy.\"\n\nFather Gaspara was still scrutinizing the rosary and crucifix. \"To be\nsure, to be sure,\" he said absently; \"I will say nothing of it; but this\nis a work of art, this crucifix; do you know what you have here? And\nthis,--is this not an altar-cloth?\" he added, lifting up the beautiful\nwrought altar-cloth, which Ramona, in honor of his coming, had pinned on\nthe wall below the Madonna's shrine.\n\n\"Yes, Father, it was made for that. My wife made it. It was to be a\npresent to Father Salvierderra; but she has not seen him, to give it to\nhim. It will take the light out of the sun for her, when first she hears\nthat he is dead.\"\n\nFather Gaspara was about to ask another question, when Ramona appeared\nin the doorway, flushed with running. She had carried the baby over to\nJuana's and left her there, that she might be free to serve the Father's\nsupper.\n\n\"I pray you tell her not,\" said Alessandro, under his breath; but it\nwas too late. Seeing the Father with her rosary in his hand, Ramona\nexclaimed:--\n\n\"That, Father, is my most sacred possession. It once belonged to Father\nPeyri, of San Luis Rey, and he gave it to Father Salvierderra, who gave\nit to me, Know you Father Salvierderra? I was hoping to hear news of him\nthrough you.\"\n\n\"Yes, I knew him,--not very well; it is long since I saw him,\" stammered\nFather Gaspara. His hesitancy alone would not have told Ramona\nthe truth; she would have set that down to the secular priest's\nindifference, or hostility, to the Franciscan order; but looking at\nAlessandro, she saw terror and sadness on his face. No shadow there\never escaped her eye. \"What is it, Alessandro?\" she exclaimed. \"Is it\nsomething about Father Salvierderra? Is he ill?\"\n\nAlessandro shook his head. He did not know what to say. Looking from\none to the other, seeing the confused pain in both their faces, Ramona,\nlaying both her hands on her breast, in the expressive gesture she had\nlearned from the Indian women, cried out in a piteous tone: \"You will\nnot tell me! You do not speak! Then he is dead!\" and she sank on her\nknees.\n\n\"Yes, my daughter, he is dead,\" said Father Gaspara, more tenderly than\nthat brusque and warlike priest often spoke. \"He died a month ago, at\nSanta Barbara. I am grieved to have brought you tidings to give you\nsuch sorrow. But you must not mourn for him. He was very feeble, and he\nlonged to die, I heard. He could no longer work, and he did not wish to\nlive.\"\n\nRamona had buried her face in her hands. The Father's words were only\na confused sound in her ears. She had heard nothing after the words, \"a\nmonth ago.\" She remained silent and motionless for some moments; then\nrising, without speaking a word, or looking at either of the men, she\ncrossed the room and knelt down before the Madonna. By a common impulse,\nboth Alessandro and Father Gaspara silently left the room. As they stood\ntogether outside the door, the Father said, \"I would go back to Lomax's\nif it were not so late. I like not to be here when your wife is in such\ngrief.\"\n\n\"That would but be another grief, Father,\" said Alessandro. \"She has\nbeen full of happiness in making ready for you. She is very strong of\nsoul. It is she who makes me strong often, and not I who give strength\nto her.\"\n\n\"My faith, but the man is right,\" thought Father Gaspara, a half-hour\nlater, when, with a calm face, Ramona summoned them to supper. He did\nnot know, as Alessandro did, how that face had changed in the half-hour.\nIt wore a look Alessandro had never seen upon it. Almost he dreaded to\nspeak to her.\n\nWhen he walked by her side, later in the evening, as she went across the\nvalley to Fernando's house, he ventured to mention Father Salvierderra's\nname. Ramona laid her hand on his lips. \"I cannot talk about him yet,\ndear,\" she said. \"I never believed that he would die without giving us\nhis blessing. Do not speak of him till to-morrow is over.\"\n\nRamona's saddened face smote on all the women's hearts as they met her\nthe next morning. One by one they gazed, astonished, then turned away,\nand spoke softly among themselves. They all loved her, and half revered\nher too, for her great kindness, and readiness to teach and to help\nthem. She had been like a sort of missionary in the valley ever since\nshe came, and no one had ever seen her face without a smile. Now she\nsmiled not. Yet there was the beautiful baby in its white dress, ready\nto be christened; and the sun shone, and the bell had been ringing\nfor half an hour, and from every corner of the valley the people were\ngathering, and Father Gaspara, in his gold and green cassock, was\npraying before the altar; it was a joyous day in San Pasquale. Why did\nAlessandro and Ramona kneel apart in a corner, with such heart-stricken\ncountenances, not even looking glad when their baby laughed, and reached\nup her hands? Gradually it was whispered about what had happened. Some\none had got it from Antonio, of Temecula, Alessandro's friend. Then\nall the women's faces grew sad too. They all had heard of Father\nSalvierderra, and many of them had prayed to the ivory Christ in\nRamona's room, and knew that he had given it to her.\n\nAs Ramona passed out of the chapel, some of them came up to her, and\ntaking her hand in theirs, laid it on their hearts, speaking no word.\nThe gesture was more than any speech could have been.\n\nWhen Father Gaspara was taking leave, Ramona said, with quivering lips,\n\"Father, if there is anything you know of Father Salvierderra's last\nhours, I would be grateful to you for telling me.\"\n\n\"I heard very little,\" replied the Father, \"except that he had been\nfeeble for some weeks; yet he would persist in spending most of the\nnight kneeling on the stone floor in the church, praying.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" interrupted Ramona; \"that he always did.\"\n\n\"And the last morning,\" continued the Father, \"the Brothers found him\nthere, still kneeling on the stone floor, but quite powerless to move;\nand they lifted him, and carried him to his room, and there they found,\nto their horror, that he had had no bed; he had lain on the stones; and\nthen they took him to the Superior's own room, and laid him in the bed,\nand he did not speak any more, and at noon he died.\"\n\n\"Thank you very much, Father,\" said Ramona, without lifting her eyes\nfrom the ground; and in the same low, tremulous tone, \"I am glad that I\nknow that he is dead.\"\n\n\"Strange what a hold those Franciscans got on these Indians!\" mused\nFather Gaspara, as he rode down the valley. \"There's none of them would\nlook like that if I were dead, I warrant me! There,\" he exclaimed, \"I\nmeant to have asked Alessandro who this wife of his is! I don't believe\nshe is a Temecula Indian. Next time I come, I will find out. She's had\nsome schooling somewhere, that's plain. She's quite superior to the\ngeneral run of them. Next time I come, I will find out about her.\"\n\n\"Next time!\" In what calendar are kept the records of those next times\nwhich never come? Long before Father Gaspara visited San Pasquale again,\nAlessandro and Ramona were far away, and strangers were living in their\nhome.\n\nIt seemed to Ramona in after years, as she looked back over this life,\nthat the news of Father Salvierderra's death was the first note of\nthe knell of their happiness. It was but a few days afterward, when\nAlessandro came in one noon with an expression on his face that\nterrified her; seating himself in a chair, he buried his face in his\nhands, and would neither look up nor speak; not until Ramona was near\ncrying from his silence, did he utter a word. Then, looking at her with\na ghastly face, he said in a hollow voice, \"It has begun!\" and buried\nhis face again. Finally Ramona's tears wrung from him the following\nstory:\n\nYsidro, it seemed, had the previous year rented a canon, at the head of\nthe valley, to one Doctor Morong. It was simply as bee-pasture that the\nDoctor wanted it, he said. He put his hives there, and built a sort of\nhut for the man whom he sent up to look after the honey. Ysidro did not\nneed the land, and thought it a good chance to make a little money. He\nhad taken every precaution to make the transaction a safe one; had gone\nto San Diego, and got Father Gaspara to act as interpreter for him, in\nthe interview with Morong; it had been a written agreement, and the rent\nagreed upon had been punctually paid. Now, the time of the lease having\nexpired, Ysidro had been to San Diego to ask the Doctor if he wished\nto renew it for another year; and the Doctor had said that the land was\nhis, and he was coming out there to build a house, and live.\n\nYsidro had gone to Father Gaspara for help, and Father Gaspara had had\nan angry interview with Doctor Morong; but it had done no good. The\nDoctor said the land did not belong to Ysidro at all, but to the United\nStates Government; and that he had paid the money for it to the agents\nin Los Angeles, and there would very soon come papers from Washington,\nto show that it was his. Father Gaspara had gone with Ysidro to a lawyer\nin San Diego, and had shown to his lawyer Ysidro's paper,--the old one\nfrom the Mexican Governor of California, establishing the pueblo of San\nPasquale, and saying how many leagues of land the Indians were to have;\nbut the lawyer had only laughed at Father Gaspara for believing that\nsuch a paper as that was good for anything. He said that was all very\nwell when the country belonged to Mexico, but it was no good now; that\nthe Americans owned it now; and everything was done by the American law\nnow, not by the Mexican law any more.\n\n\"Then we do not own any land in San Pasquale at all,\" said Ysidro. \"Is\nthat what it means?\"\n\nAnd the lawyer had said, he did not know how it would be with the\ncultivated land, and the village where the houses were,--he could\nnot tell about that; but he thought it all belonged to the men at\nWashington.\n\nFather Gaspara was in such rage, Ysidro said, that he tore open his gown\non his breast, and he smote himself, and he said he wished he were a\nsoldier, and no priest, that he might fight this accursed United States\nGovernment; and the lawyer laughed at him, and told him to look after\nsouls,--that was his business,--and let the Indian beggars alone! \"Yes,\nthat was what he said,--'the Indian beggars!' and so they would be all\nbeggars, presently.\"\n\nAlessandro told this by gasps, as it were; at long intervals. His voice\nwas choked; his whole frame shook. He was nearly beside himself with\nrage and despair.\n\n\"You see, it is as I said, Majella. There is no place safe. We can do\nnothing! We might better be dead!\"\n\n\"It is a long way off, that canon Doctor Morong had,\" said Ramona,\npiteously. \"It wouldn't do any harm, his living there, if no more came.\"\n\n\"Majella talks like a dove, and not like a woman,\" said Alessandro,\nfiercely. \"Will there be one to come, and not two? It is the beginning.\nTo-morrow may come ten more, with papers to show that the land is\ntheirs. We can do nothing, any more than the wild beasts. They are\nbetter than we.\"\n\nFrom this day Alessandro was a changed man. Hope had died in his bosom.\nIn all the village councils,--and they were many and long now, for the\nlittle community had been plunged into great anxiety and distress\nby this Doctor Morong's affair,--Alessandro sat dumb and gloomy. To\nwhatever was proposed, he had but one reply: \"It is of no use. We can do\nnothing.\"\n\n\"Eat your dinners to-day, to-morrow we starve,\" he said one night,\nbitterly, as the council broke up. When Ysidro proposed to him that\nthey should journey to Los Angeles, where Father Gaspara had said the\nheadquarters of the Government officers were, and where they could learn\nall about the new laws in regard to land, Alessandro laughed at him.\n\"What more is it, then, which you wish to know, my brother, about the\nAmerican laws?\" he said. \"Is it not enough that you know they have made\na law which will take the land from Indians; from us who have owned\nit longer than any can remember; land that our ancestors are buried\nin,--will take that land and give it to themselves, and say it is\ntheirs? Is it to hear this again said in your face, and to see the man\nlaugh who says it, like the lawyer in San Diego, that you will journey\nto Los Angeles? I will not go!\"\n\nAnd Ysidro went alone. Father Gaspara gave him a letter to the Los\nAngeles priest, who went with him to the land-office, patiently\ninterpreted for him all he had to say, and as patiently interpreted\nall that the officials had to say in reply. They did not laugh, as\nAlessandro in his bitterness had said. They were not inhuman, and\nthey felt sincere sympathy for this man, representative of two hundred\nhard-working, industrious people, in danger of being turned out of house\nand home. But they were very busy; they had to say curtly, and in few\nwords, all there was to be said: the San Pasquale district was certainly\nthe property of the United States Government, and the lands were in\nmarket, to be filed on, and bought, according to the homestead laws,\nThese officials had neither authority nor option in the matter. They\nwere there simply to carry out instructions, and obey orders.\n\nYsidro understood the substance of all this, though the details were\nbeyond his comprehension. But he did not regret having taken the\njourney; he had now made his last effort for his people. The Los Angeles\npriest had promised that he would himself write a letter to Washington,\nto lay the case before the head man there, and perhaps something would\nbe done for their relief. It seemed incredible to Ysidro, as, riding\nalong day after day, on his sad homeward journey, he reflected on the\nsubject,--it seemed incredible to him that the Government would permit\nsuch a village as theirs to be destroyed. He reached home just at\nsunset; and looking down, as Alessandro and Ramona had done on the\nmorning of their arrival, from the hillcrests at the west end of the\nvalley, seeing the broad belt of cultivated fields and orchards, the\npeaceful little hamlet of houses, he groaned. \"If the people who make\nthese laws could only see this village, they would never turn us out,\nnever! They can't know what is being done. I am sure they can't know.\"\n\n\"What did I tell you?\" cried Alessandro, galloping up on Benito, and\nreining him in so sharply he reared and plunged. \"What did I tell you?\nI saw by your face, many paces back, that you had come as you went, or\nworse! I have been watching for you these two days. Another American\nhas come in with Morong in the canon; they are making corrals; they will\nkeep stock. You will see how long we have any pasture-lands in that end\nof the valley. I drive all my stock to San Diego next week. I will sell\nit for what it will bring,--both the cattle and the sheep. It is no use.\nYou will see.\"\n\nWhen Ysidro began to recount his interview with the land-office\nauthorities, Alessandro broke in fiercely: \"I wish to hear no more of\nit. Their names and their speech are like smoke in my eyes and my nose.\nI think I shall go mad, Ysidro. Go tell your story to the men who are\nwaiting to hear it, and who yet believe that an American may speak\ntruth!\"\n\nAlessandro was as good as his word. The very next week he drove all\nhis cattle and sheep to San Diego, and sold them at great loss. \"It\nis better than nothing,\" he said. \"They will not now be sold by the\nsheriff, like my father's in Temecula.\" The money he got, he took to\nFather Gaspara. \"Father,\" he said huskily. \"I have sold all my stock. I\nwould not wait for the Americans to sell it for me, and take the money.\nI have not got much, but it is better than nothing. It will make that we\ndo not starve for one year. Will you keep it for me, Father? I dare not\nhave it in San Pasquale. San Pasquale will be like Temecula,--it may be\nto-morrow.\"\n\nTo the Father's suggestion that he should put the money in a bank in San\nDiego, Alessandro cried: \"Sooner would I throw it in the sea yonder! I\ntrust no man, henceforth; only the Church I will trust. Keep it for me,\nFather, I pray you,\" and the Father could not refuse his imploring tone.\n\n\"What are your plans now?\" he asked.\n\n\"Plans!\" repeated Alessandro,--\"plans, Father! Why should I make plans?\nI will stay in my house so long as the Americans will let me. You saw\nour little house, Father!\" His voice broke as he said this. \"I have\nlarge wheat-fields; if I can get one more crop off them, it will be\nsomething; but my land is of the richest in the valley, and as soon as\nthe Americans see it, they will want it. Farewell, Father. I thank you\nfor keeping my money, and for all you said to the thief Morong. Ysidro\ntold me. Farewell.\" And he was gone, and out of sight on the swift\ngalloping Benito, before Father Gaspara bethought himself.\n\n\"And I remembered not to ask who his wife was. I will look back at the\nrecord,\" said the Father. Taking down the old volume, he ran his eye\nback over the year. Marriages were not so many in Father Gaspara's\nparish, that the list took long to read. The entry of Alessandro's\nmarriage was blotted. The Father had been in haste that night.\n\"Alessandro Assis. Majella Fa--\" No more could be read. The name meant\nnothing to Father Gaspara. \"Clearly an Indian name,\" he said to himself;\n\"yet she seemed superior in every way. I wonder where she got it.\"\n\nThe winter wore along quietly in San Pasquale. The delicious soft rains\nset in early, promising a good grain year. It seemed a pity not to get\nin as much wheat as possible; and all the San Pasquale people went early\nto ploughing new fields,--all but Alessandro.\n\n\"If I reap all I have, I will thank the saints,\" he said. \"I will plough\nno more land for the robbers.\" But after his fields were all planted,\nand the beneficent rains still kept on, and the hills all along the\nvalley wall began to turn green earlier than ever before was known,\nhe said to Ramona one morning, \"I think I will make one more field of\nwheat. There will be a great yield this year. Maybe we will be left\nunmolested till the harvest is over.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, and for many more harvests, dear Alessandro!\" said Ramona,\ncheerily. \"You are always looking on the black side.\"\n\n\"There is no other but the black side, Majella,\" he replied. \"Strain my\neyes as I may, on all sides all is black. You will see. Never any more\nharvests in San Pasquale for us, after this. If we get this, we are\nlucky. I have seen the white men riding up and down in the valley, and\nI found some of their cursed bits of wood with figures on them set up\non my land the other day; and I pulled them up and burned them to ashes.\nBut I will plough one more field this week; though, I know not why it\nis, my thoughts go against it even now. But I will do it; and I will not\ncome home till night, Majella, for the field is too far to go and come\ntwice. I shall be the whole day ploughing.\" So saying, he stooped and\nkissed the baby, and then kissing Ramona, went out.\n\nRamona stood at the door and watched him as he harnessed Benito and Baba\nto the plough. He did not once look back at her; his face seemed full of\nthought, his hands acting as it were mechanically. After he had gone\na few rods from the house, he stopped, stood still for some minutes\nmeditatingly, then went on irresolutely, halted again, but finally went\non, and disappeared from sight among the low foothills to the east.\nSighing deeply, Ramona turned back to her work. But her heart was too\ndisquieted. She could not keep back the tears.\n\n\"How changed is Alessandro!\" she thought. \"It terrifies me to see him\nthus. I will tell the Blessed Virgin about it;\" and kneeling before the\nshrine, she prayed fervently and long. She rose comforted, and\ndrawing the baby's cradle out into the veranda, seated herself at her\nembroidery. Her skill with her needle had proved a not inconsiderable\nsource of income, her fine lace-work being always taken by San Diego\nmerchants, and at fairly good prices.\n\nIt seemed to her only a short time that she had been sitting thus, when,\nglancing up at the sun, she saw it was near noon; at the same moment\nshe saw Alessandro approaching, with the horses. In dismay, she thought,\n\"There is no dinner! He said he would not come!\" and springing up, was\nabout to run to meet him, when she observed that he was not alone.\nA short, thick-set man was walking by his side; they were talking\nearnestly. It was a white man. What did it bode? Presently they stopped.\nShe saw Alessandro lift his hand and point to the house, then to the\ntule sheds in the rear. He seemed to be talking excitedly; the white\nman also; they were both speaking at once. Ramona shivered with fear.\nMotionless she stood, straining eye and ear; she could hear nothing,\nbut the gestures told much. Had it come,--the thing Alessandro had said\nwould come? Were they to be driven out,--driven out this very day, when\nthe Virgin had only just now seemed to promise her help and protection?\n\nThe baby stirred, waked, began to cry. Catching the child up to her\nbreast, she stilled her by convulsive caresses. Clasping her tight in\nher arms, she walked a few steps towards Alessandro, who, seeing her,\nmade an imperative gesture to her to return. Sick at heart, she went\nback to the veranda and sat down to wait.\n\nIn a few moments she saw the white man counting out money into\nAlessandro's hand; then he turned and walked away, Alessandro still\nstanding as if rooted to the spot, gazing into the palm of his hand,\nBenito and Baba slowly walking away from him unnoticed; at last he\nseemed to rouse himself as from a trance, and picking up the horses'\nreins, came slowly toward her. Again she started to meet him; again\nhe made the same authoritative gesture to her to return; and again she\nseated herself, trembling in every nerve of her body. Ramona was now\nsometimes afraid of Alessandro. When these fierce glooms seized him,\nshe dreaded, she knew not what. He seemed no more the Alessandro she had\nloved.\n\nDeliberately, lingeringly, he unharnessed the horses and put them in\nthe corral. Then still more deliberately, lingeringly, he walked to the\nhouse; walked, without speaking, past Ramona, into the door. A lurid\nspot on each cheek showed burning red through the bronze of his skin.\nHis eyes glittered. In silence Ramona followed him, and saw him draw\nfrom his pocket a handful of gold-pieces, fling them on the table, and\nburst into a laugh more terrible than any weeping,--a laugh which wrung\nfrom her instantly, involuntarily, the cry, \"Oh, my Alessandro! my\nAlessandro! What is it? Are you mad?\"\n\n\"No, my sweet Majel,\" he exclaimed, turning to her, and flinging his\narms round her and the child together, drawing them so close to his\nbreast that the embrace hurt,--\"no, I am not mad; but I think I shall\nsoon be! What is that gold? The price of this house, Majel, and of the\nfields,--of all that was ours in San Pasquale! To-morrow we will go out\ninto the world again. I will see if I can find a place the Americans do\nnot want!\"\n\nIt did not take many words to tell the story. Alessandro had not been\nploughing more than an hour, when, hearing a strange sound, he looked\nup and saw a man unloading lumber a few rods off'. Alessandro stopped\nmidway in the furrow and watched him. The man also watched Alessandro.\nPresently he came toward him, and said roughly, \"Look here! Be off, will\nyou? This is my land. I'm going to build a house here.\"\n\nAlessandro had replied, \"This was my land yesterday. How comes it yours\nto-day?\"\n\nSomething in the wording of this answer, or something in Alessandro's\ntone and bearing, smote the man's conscience, or heart, or what stood\nto him in the place of conscience and heart, and he said: \"Come, now, my\ngood fellow, you look like a reasonable kind of a fellow; you just clear\nout, will you, and not make me any trouble. You see the land's mine.\nI've got all this land round here;\" and he waved his arm, describing a\ncircle; \"three hundred and twenty acres, me and my brother together, and\nwe're coming in here to settle. We got our papers from Washington last\nweek. It's all right, and you may just as well go peaceably, as make a\nfuss about it. Don't you see?\"\n\nYes, Alessandro saw. He had been seeing this precise thing for months.\nMany times, in his dreams and in his waking thoughts, he had lived over\nscenes similar to this. An almost preternatural calm and wisdom seemed\nto be given him now.\n\n\"Yes, I see, Senor,\" he said. \"I am not surprised. I knew it would come;\nbut I hoped it would not be till after harvest. I will not give you any\ntrouble, Senor, because I cannot. If I could, I would. But I have\nheard all about the new law which gives all the Indians' lands to the\nAmericans. We cannot help ourselves. But it is very hard, Senor.\" He\npaused.\n\nThe man, confused and embarrassed, astonished beyond expression at\nbeing met in this way by an Indian, did not find words come ready to his\ntongue. \"Of course, I know it does seem a little rough on fellows like\nyou, that are industrious, and have done some work on the land. But you\nsee the land's in the market; I've paid my money for it.\"\n\n\"The Senor is going to build a house?\" asked Alessandro.\n\n\"Yes,\" the man answered. \"I've got my family in San Diego, and I want to\nget them settled as soon as I can. My wife won't feel comfortable till\nshe's in her own house. We're from the States, and she's been used to\nhaving everything comfortable.\"\n\n\"I have a wife and child, Senor,\" said Alessandro, still in the same\ncalm, deliberate tone; \"and we have a very good house of two rooms. It\nwould save the Senor's building, if he would buy mine.\"\n\n\"How far is it?\" said the man. \"I can't tell exactly where the\nboundaries of my land are, for the stakes we set have been pulled up.\"\n\n\"Yes, Senor, I pulled them up and burned them. They were on my land,\"\nreplied Alessandro. \"My house is farther west than your stakes; and I\nhave large wheat-fields there, too,--many acres, Senor, all planted.\"\n\nHere was a chance, indeed. The man's eyes gleamed. He would do the\nhandsome thing. He would give this fellow something for his house and\nwheat-crops. First he would see the house, however; and it was for\nthat purpose he had walked back with Alessandro, When he saw the neat\nwhitewashed adobe, with its broad veranda, the sheds and corrals all\nin good order, he instantly resolved to get possession of them by fair\nmeans or foul.\n\n\"There will be three hundred dollars' worth of wheat in July, Senor, you\ncan see for yourself; and a house so good as that, you cannot build for\nless than one hundred dollars. What will you give me for them?\"\n\n\"I suppose I can have them without paying you for them, if I choose,\"\nsaid the man, insolently.\n\n\"No, Senor,\" replied Alessandro.\n\n\"What's to hinder, then, I'd like to know!\" in a brutal sneer. \"You\nhaven't got any rights here, whatever, according to law.\"\n\n\"I shall hinder, Senor,\" replied Alessandro. \"I shall burn down the\nsheds and corrals, tear down the house; and before a blade of the wheat\nis reaped, I will burn that.\" Still in the same calm tone.\n\n\"What'll you take?\" said the man, sullenly.\n\n\"Two hundred dollars,\" replied Alessandro.\n\n\"Well, leave your plough and wagon, and I'll give it to you,\" said the\nman; \"and a big fool I am, too. Well laughed at, I'll be, do you know\nit, for buying out an Indian!\"\n\n\"The wagon, Senor, cost me one hundred and thirty dollars in San Diego.\nYou cannot buy one so good for less. I will not sell it. I need it to\ntake away my things in. The plough you may have. That is worth twenty.\"\n\n\"I'll do it,\" said the man; and pulling out a heavy buckskin pouch, he\ncounted out into Alessandro's hand two hundred dollars in gold.\n\n\"Is that all right?\" he said, as he put down the last piece.\n\n\"That is the sum I said, Senor,\" replied Alessandro. \"Tomorrow, at noon,\nyou can come into the house.\"\n\n\"Where will you go?\" asked the man, again slightly touched by\nAlessandro's manner. \"Why don't you stay round here? I expect you could\nget work enough; there are a lot of farmers coming in here; they'll want\nhands.\"\n\nA fierce torrent of words sprang to Alessandro's lips, but he choked\nthem back. \"I do not know where I shall go, but I will not stay here,\"\nhe said; and that ended the interview.\n\n\"I don't know as I blame him a mite for feeling that way,\" thought the\nman from the States, as he walked slowly back to his pile of lumber. \"I\nexpect I should feel just so myself.\"\n\nAlmost before Alessandro had finished this tale, he began to move\nabout the room, taking down, folding up, opening and shutting lids; his\nrestlessness was terrible to see. \"By sunrise, I would like to be off,\"\nhe said. \"It is like death, to be in the house which is no longer ours.\"\nRamona had spoken no words since her first cry on hearing that terrible\nlaugh. She was like one stricken dumb. The shock was greater to her than\nto Alessandro. He had lived with it ever present in his thoughts for a\nyear. She had always hoped. But far more dreadful than the loss of her\nhome, was the anguish of seeing, hearing, the changed face, changed\nvoice, of Alessandro. Almost this swallowed up the other. She obeyed\nhim mechanically, working faster and faster as he grew more and more\nfeverish in his haste. Before sundown the little house was dismantled;\neverything, except the bed and the stove, packed in the big wagon.\n\n\"Now, we must cook food for the journey,\" said Alessandro.\n\n\"Where are we going?\" said the weeping Ramona.\n\n\"Where?\" ejaculated Alessandro, so scornfully that it sounded like\nimpatience with Ramona, and made her tears flow afresh. \"Where? I know\nnot, Majella! Into the mountains, where the white men come not! At\nsunrise we will start.\"\n\nRamona wished to say good-by to their friends. There were women in the\nvillage that she tenderly loved. But Alessandro was unwilling. \"There\nwill be weeping and crying, Majella; I pray you do not speak to one. Why\nshould we have more tears? Let us disappear. I will say all to Ysidro.\nHe will tell them.\"\n\nThis was a sore grief to Ramona. In her heart she rebelled against it,\nas she had never yet rebelled against an act of Alessandro's; but she\ncould not distress him. Was not his burden heavy enough now?\n\nWithout a word of farewell to any one, they set off in the gray dawn,\nbefore a creature was stirring in the village,--the wagon piled high;\nRamona, her baby in her arms, in front; Alessandro walking. The load was\nheavy. Benito and Baba walked slowly. Capitan, unhappy, looking first at\nRamona's face, then at Alessandro's, walked dispiritedly by their side.\nHe knew all was wrong.\n\nAs Alessandro turned the horses into a faintly marked road leading in a\nnortheasterly direction, Ramona said with a sob, \"Where does this road\nlead, Alessandro?\"\n\n\"To San Jacinto,\" he said. \"San Jacinto Mountain. Do not look back,\nMajella! Do not look back!\" he cried, as he saw Ramona, with streaming\neyes, gazing back towards San Pasquale. \"Do not look back! It is gone!\nPray to the saints now, Majella! Pray! Pray!\"\n\n\n\n\nXXI\n\nTHE Senora Moreno was dying. It had been a sad two years in the Moreno\nhouse. After the first excitement following Ramona's departure had\ndied away, things had settled down in a surface similitude of their old\nroutine. But nothing was really the same. No one was so happy as before.\nJuan Canito was heart-broken. There had been set over him the very\nMexican whose coming to the place he had dreaded. The sheep had not done\nwell; there had been a drought; many had died of hunger,--a thing for\nwhich the new Mexican overseer was not to blame, though it pleased Juan\nto hold him so, and to say from morning till night that if his leg had\nnot been broken, or if the lad Alessandro had been there, the wool-crop\nwould have been as big as ever. Not one of the servants liked this\nMexican; he had a sorry time of it, poor fellow; each man and woman on\nthe place had or fancied some reason for being set against him; some\nfrom sympathy with Juan Can, some from idleness and general impatience;\nMargarita, most of all, because he was not Alessandro. Margarita,\nbetween remorse about her young mistress and pique and disappointment\nabout Alessandro, had become a very unhappy girl; and her mother,\ninstead of comforting or soothing her, added to her misery by\ncontinually bemoaning Ramona's fate. The void that Ramona had left in\nthe whole household seemed an irreparable one; nothing came to fill it;\nthere was no forgetting; every day her name was mentioned by some one;\nmentioned with bated breath, fearful conjecture, compassion, and regret.\nWhere had she vanished? Had she indeed gone to the convent, as she said,\nor had she fled with Alessandro?\n\nMargarita would have given her right hand to know. Only Juan Can felt\nsure. Very well Juan Can knew that nobody but Alessandro had the wit and\nthe power over Baba to lure him out of that corral, \"and never a rail\nout of its place.\" And the saddle, too! Ay, the smart lad! He had done\nthe best he could for the Senorita; but, Holy Virgin! what had got into\nthe Senorita to run off like that, with an Indian,--even Alessandro!\nThe fiends had bewitched her. Tirelessly Juan Can questioned every\ntraveller, every wandering herder he saw. No one knew anything of\nAlessandro, beyond the fact that all the Temecula Indians had been\ndriven out of their village, and that there was now not an Indian in the\nvalley. There was a rumor that Alessandro and his father had both\ndied; but no one knew anything certainly. The Temecula Indians had\ndisappeared, that was all there was of it,--disappeared, like any wild\ncreatures, foxes or coyotes, hunted down, driven out; the valley was rid\nof them. But the Senorita! She was not with these fugitives. That could\nnot be! Heaven forbid!\n\n\"If I'd my legs, I'd go and see for myself.\" said Juan Can. \"It would\nbe some comfort to know even the worst. Perdition take the Senora, who\ndrove her to it! Ay, drove her to it! That's what I say, Luigo.\" In some\nof his most venturesome wrathy moments he would say: \"There's none\nof you know the truth about the Senorita but me! It's a hard hand the\nSenora's reared her with, from the first. She's a wonderful woman, our\nSenora! She gets power over one.\"\n\nBut the Senora's power was shaken now. More changed than all else in the\nchanged Moreno household, was the relation between the Senora Moreno and\nher son Felipe. On the morning after Ramona's disappearance, words had\nbeen spoken by each which neither would ever forget. In fact, the Senora\nbelieved that it was of them she was dying, and perhaps that was not far\nfrom the truth; the reason that forces could no longer rally in her to\nrepel disease, lying no doubt largely in the fact that to live seemed no\nlonger to her desirable.\n\nFelipe had found the note Ramona had laid on his bed. Before it was yet\ndawn he had waked, and tossing uneasily under the light covering had\nheard the rustle of the paper, and knowing instinctively that it was\nfrom Ramona, had risen instantly to make sure of it. Before his mother\nopened her window, he had read it. He felt like one bereft of his senses\nas he read. Gone! Gone with Alessandro! Stolen away like a thief in the\nnight, his dear, sweet little sister! Ah, what a cruel shame! Scales\nseemed to drop from Felipe's eyes as he lay motionless, thinking of\nit. A shame! a cruel shame! And he and his mother were the ones who had\nbrought it on Ramona's head, and on the house of Moreno. Felipe felt\nas if he had been under a spell all along, not to have realized this.\n\"That's what I told my mother!\" he groaned,--\"that it drove her to\nrunning away! Oh, my sweet Ramona! what will become of her? I will go\nafter them, and bring them back;\" and Felipe rose, and hastily dressing\nhimself, ran down the veranda steps, to gain a little more time to\nthink. He returned shortly, to meet his mother standing in the doorway,\nwith pale, affrighted face.\n\n\"Felipe!\" she cried, \"Ramona is not here.\"\n\n\"I know it,\" he replied in an angry tone. \"That is what I told you we\nshould do,--drive her to running away with Alessandro!\"\n\n\"With Alessandro!\" interrupted the Senora.\n\n\"Yes,\" continued Felipe,--\"with Alessandro, the Indian! Perhaps you\nthink it is less disgrace to the names of Ortegna and Moreno to have her\nrun away with him, than to be married to him here under our roof! I\ndo not! Curse the day, I say, when I ever lent myself to breaking the\ngirl's heart! I am going after them, to fetch them back!\"\n\nIf the skies had opened and rained fire, the Senora had hardly less\nquailed and wondered than she did at these words; but even for fire from\nthe skies she would not surrender till she must.\n\n\"How know you that it is with Alessandro?\" she said.\n\n\"Because she has written it here!\" cried Felipe, defiantly holding\nup his little note. \"She left this, her good-by to me. Bless her! She\nwrites like a saint, to thank me for all my goodness to her,--I, who\ndrove her to steal out of my house like a thief!\"\n\nThe phrase, \"my house,\" smote the Senora's ear like a note from some\nother sphere, which indeed it was,--from the new world into which Felipe\nhad been in an hour born. Her cheeks flushed, and she opened her lips to\nreply; but before she had uttered a word, Luigo came running round\nthe corner, Juan Can hobbling after him at a miraculous pace on his\ncrutches. \"Senor Felipe! Senor Felipe! Oh, Senora!\" they cried. \"Thieves\nhave been here in the night! Baba is gone,--Baba, and the Senorita's\nsaddle.\"\n\nA malicious smile broke over the Senora's countenance, and turning to\nFelipe, she said in a tone--what a tone it was! Felipe felt as if\nhe must put his hands to his ears to shut it out; Felipe would never\nforget,--\"As you were saying, like a thief in the night!\"\n\nWith a swifter and more energetic movement than any had ever before seen\nSenor Felipe make, he stepped forward, saying in an undertone to his\nmother, \"For God's sake, mother, not a word before the men!--What is\nthat you say, Luigo? Baba gone? We must see to our corral. I will come\ndown, after breakfast, and look at it;\" and turning his back on them, he\ndrew his mother by a firm grasp, she could not resist, into the house.\n\nShe gazed at him in sheer, dumb wonder.\n\n\"Ay, mother,\" he said, \"you may well look thus in wonder; I have been no\nman, to let my foster-sister, I care not what blood were in her veins,\nbe driven to this pass! I will set out this day, and bring her back.\"\n\n\"The day you do that, then, I lie in this house dead!\" retorted the\nSenora, at white heat. \"You may rear as many Indian families as you\nplease under the Moreno roof, I will at least have my grave!\" In spite\nof her anger, grief convulsed her; and in another second she had\nburst into tears, and sunk helpless and trembling into a chair. No\ncounterfeiting now. No pretences. The Senora Moreno's heart broke within\nher, when those words passed her lips to her adored Felipe. At the\nsight, Felipe flung himself on his knees before her; he kissed the aged\nhands as they lay trembling in her lap. \"Mother mia,\" he cried, \"you\nwill break my heart if you speak like that! Oh, why, why do you command\nme to do what a man may not? I would die for you, my mother; but how can\nI see my sister a homeless wanderer in the wilderness?\"\n\n\"I suppose the man Alessandro has something he calls a home,\" said the\nSenora, regaining herself a little. \"Had they no plans? Spoke she not in\nher letter of what they would do?\"\n\n\"Only that they would go to Father Salvierderra first,\" he replied.\n\n\"Ah!\" The Senora reflected. At first startled, her second thought was\nthat this would be the best possible thing which could happen. \"Father\nSalvierderra will counsel them what to do,\" she said. \"He could no doubt\nestablish them in Santa Barbara in some way. My son, when you reflect,\nyou will see the impossibility of bringing them here. Help them in any\nway you like, but do not bring them here.\" She paused. \"Not until I am\ndead, Felipe! It will not be long.\"\n\nFelipe bowed his head in his mother's lap. She laid her hands on his\nhair, and stroked it with passionate tenderness. \"My Felipe!\" she said.\n\"It was a cruel fate to rob me of you at the last!\"\n\n\"Mother! mother!\" he cried in anguish. \"I am yours,--wholly, devotedly\nyours! Why do you torture me thus?\"\n\n\"I will not torture you more,\" she said wearily, in a feeble tone. \"I\nask only one thing of you; let me never hear again the name of that\nwretched girl, who has brought all this woe on our house; let her name\nnever be spoken on this place by man, woman, or child. Like a thief in\nthe night! Ay, a horse-thief!\"\n\nFelipe sprang to his feet.\n\n\"Mother.\" he said, \"Baba was Ramona's own; I myself gave him to her as\nsoon as he was born!\"\n\nThe Senora made no reply. She had fainted. Calling the maids, in terror\nand sorrow Felipe bore her to her bed, and she did not leave it for many\ndays. She seemed hovering between life and death. Felipe watched over\nher as a lover might; her great mournful eyes followed his every motion.\nShe spoke little, partly because of physical weakness, partly from\ndespair. The Senora had got her death-blow. She would die hard. It would\ntake long. Yet she was dying, and she knew it.\n\nFelipe did not know it. When he saw her going about again, with a step\nonly a little slower than before, and with a countenance not so much\nchanged as he had feared, he thought she would be well again, after a\ntime. And now he would go in search of Ramona. How he hoped he should\nfind them in Santa Barbara! He must leave them there, or wherever he\nshould find them; never again would he for a moment contemplate the\npossibility of bringing them home with him. But he would see them; help\nthem, if need be. Ramona should not feel herself an outcast, so long as\nhe lived.\n\nWhen he said, agitatedly, to his mother, one night, \"You are so\nstrong now, mother, I think I will take a journey; I will not be away\nlong,--not over a week,\" she understood, and with a deep sigh replied:\n\"I am not strong; but I am as strong as I shall ever be. If the journey\nmust be taken, it is as well done now.\"\n\nHow was the Senora changed!\n\n\"It must be, mother,\" said Felipe, \"or I would not leave you. I will set\noff before sunrise, so I will say farewell tonight.\"\n\nBut in the morning, at his first step, his mother's window opened, and\nthere she stood, wan, speechless, looking at him. \"You must go, my son?\"\nshe asked at last.\n\n\"I must, mother!\" and Felipe threw his arms around her, and kissed her\nagain and again. \"Dearest mother! Do smile! Can you not?\"\n\n\"No, my son, I cannot. Farewell. The saints keep you. Farewell.\" And she\nturned, that she might not see him go.\n\nFelipe rode away with a sad heart, but his purpose did not falter.\nFollowing straight down the river road to the sea, he then kept up along\nthe coast, asking here and there, cautiously, if persons answering to\nthe description of Alessandro and Ramona had been seen. No one had seen\nany such persons.\n\nWhen, on the night of the second day, he rode up to the Santa Barbara\nMission, the first figure he saw was the venerable Father Salvierderra\nsitting in the corridor. As Felipe approached, the old man's face beamed\nwith pleasure, and he came forward totteringly, leaning on a staff in\neach hand. \"Welcome, my son!\" he said. \"Are all well? You find me very\nfeeble just now; my legs are failing me sorely this autumn.\"\n\nDismay seized on Felipe at the Father's first words. He would not have\nspoken thus, had he seen Ramona. Barely replying to the greeting, Felipe\nexclaimed: \"Father, I come seeking Ramona. Has she not been with you?\"\n\nFather Salvierderra's face was reply to the question. \"Ramona!\" he\ncried. \"Seeking Ramona! What has befallen the blessed child?\"\n\nIt was a bitter story for Felipe to tell; but he told it, sparing\nhimself no shame. He would have suffered less in the telling, had he\nknown how well Father Salvierderra understood his mother's character,\nand her almost unlimited power over all persons around her. Father\nSalvierderra was not shocked at the news of Ramona's attachment for\nAlessandro. He regretted it, but he did not think it shame, as the\nSenora had done. As Felipe talked with him, he perceived even more\nclearly how bitter and unjust his mother had been to Alessandro.\n\n\"He is a noble young man,\" said Father Salvierderra. \"His father was one\nof the most trusted of Father Peyri's assistants. You must find them,\nFelipe. I wonder much they did not come to me. Perhaps they may yet\ncome. When you find them, bear them my blessing, and say that I wish\nthey would come hither. I would like to give them my blessing before\nI die. Felipe, I shall never leave Santa Barbara again. My time draws\nnear.\"\n\nFelipe was so full of impatience to continue his search, that he hardly\nlistened to the Father's words. \"I will not tarry,\" he said. \"I cannot\nrest till I find her. I will ride back as far as Ventura to-night.\"\n\n\"You will send me word by a messenger, when you find them,\" said the\nFather. \"God grant no harm has befallen them. I will pray for them,\nFelipe;\" and he tottered into the church.\n\nFelipe's thoughts, as he retraced his road, were full of bewilderment\nand pain. He was wholly at loss to conjecture what course Alessandro and\nRamona had taken, or what could have led them to abandon their intention\nof going to Father Salvierderra. Temecula seemed the only place, now, to\nlook for them; and yet from Temecula Felipe had heard, only a few days\nbefore leaving home, that there was not an Indian left in the valley.\nBut he could at least learn there where the Indians had gone. Poor as\nthe clew seemed, it was all he had. Cruelly Felipe urged his horse\non his return journey. He grudged an hour's rest to himself or to the\nbeast; and before he reached the head of the Temecula canon the creature\nwas near spent. At the steepest part he jumped off and walked, to save\nher strength. As he was toiling slowly up a narrow, rocky pass, he\nsuddenly saw an Indian's head peering over the ledge. He made signs\nto him to come down. The Indian turned his head, and spoke to some one\nbehind; one after another a score of figures rose. They made signs to\nFelipe to come up. \"Poor things!\" he thought; \"they are afraid.\" He\nshouted to them that his horse was too tired to climb that wall; but if\nthey would come down, he would give them money, holding up a gold-piece.\nThey consulted among themselves; presently they began slowly descending,\nstill halting at intervals, and looking suspiciously at him. He held\nup the gold again, and beckoned. As soon as they could see his face\ndistinctly, they broke into a run. That was no enemy's face.\n\nOnly one of the number could speak Spanish. On hearing this man's reply\nto Felipe's first question, a woman, who had listened sharply and caught\nthe word Alessandro, came forward, and spoke rapidly in the Indian\ntongue.\n\n\"This woman has seen Alessandro,\" said the man.\n\n\"Where?\" said Felipe, breathlessly.\n\n\"In Temecula, two weeks ago,\" he said.\n\n\"Ask her if he had any one with him,\" said Felipe.\n\n\"No,\" said the woman. \"He was alone.\"\n\nA convulsion passed over Felipe's face. \"Alone!\" What did this mean! He\nreflected. The woman watched him. \"Is she sure he was alone; there was\nno one with him?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Was he riding a big black horse?\"\n\n\"No, a white horse,\" answered the woman, promptly. \"A small white\nhorse.\"\n\nIt was Carmena, every nerve of her loyal nature on the alert to baffle\nthis pursuer of Alessandro and Ramona. Again Felipe reflected. \"Ask her\nif she saw him for any length of time; how long she saw him.\"\n\n\"All night,\" he answered. \"He spent the night where she did.\"\n\nFelipe despaired. \"Does she know where he is now?\" he asked.\n\n\"He was going to San Luis Obispo, to go in a ship to Monterey.\"\n\n\"What to do?\"\n\n\"She does not know.\"\n\n\"Did he say when he would come back?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"When?\"\n\n\"Never! He said he would never set foot in Temecula again.\"\n\n\"Does she know him well?\"\n\n\"As well as her own brother.\"\n\nWhat more could Felipe ask? With a groan, wrung from the very depths of\nhis heart, he tossed the man a gold-piece; another to the woman. \"I am\nsorry,\" he said. \"Alessandro was my friend. I wanted to see him;\" and he\nrode away, Carmena's eyes following him with a covert gleam of triumph.\n\nWhen these last words of his were interpreted to her, she started, made\nas if she would run after him, but checked herself. \"No,\" she thought.\n\"It may be a lie. He may be an enemy, for all that. I will not tell.\nAlessandro wished not to be found. I will not tell.\"\n\nAnd thus vanished the last chance of succor for Ramona; vanished in a\nmoment; blown like a thistledown on a chance breath,--the breath of a\nloyal, loving friend, speaking a lie to save her.\n\nDistraught with grief, Felipe returned home. Ramona had been very\nill when she left home. Had she died, and been buried by the lonely,\nsorrowing Alessandro? And was that the reason Alessandro was going away\nto the North, never to return? Fool that he was, to have shrunk from\nspeaking Ramona's name to the Indians! He would return, and ask again.\nAs soon as he had seen his mother, he would set off again, and never\ncease searching till he had found either Ramona or her grave. But when\nFelipe entered his mother's presence, his first look in her face told\nhim that he would not leave her side again until he had laid her at rest\nin the tomb.\n\n\"Thank God! you have come, Felipe,\" she said in a feeble voice. \"I had\nbegun to fear you would not come in time to say farewell to me. I am\ngoing to leave you, my son;\" and the tears rolled down her cheeks.\n\nThough she no longer wished to live, neither did she wish to die,--this\npoor, proud, passionate, defeated, bereft Senora. All the consolations\nof her religion seemed to fail her. She had prayed incessantly, but got\nno peace. She fixed her imploring eyes on the Virgin's face and on the\nsaints; but all seemed to her to wear a forbidding look. \"If Father\nSalvierderra would only come!\" she groaned. \"He could give me peace. If\nonly I can live till he comes again!\"\n\nWhen Felipe told her of the old man's feeble state, and that he would\nnever again make the journey, she turned her face to the wall and wept.\nNot only for her own soul's help did she wish to see him: she wished\nto put into his hands the Ortegna jewels. What would become of them? To\nwhom should she transfer the charge? Was there a secular priest\nwithin reach that she could trust? When her sister had said, in her\ninstructions, \"the Church,\" she meant, as the Senora Moreno well knew,\nthe Franciscans. The Senora dared not consult Felipe; yet she must. Day\nby day these fretting anxieties and perplexities wasted her strength,\nand her fever grew higher and higher. She asked no questions as to the\nresult of Felipe's journey, and he dared not mention Ramona's name. At\nlast he could bear it no longer, and one day said, \"Mother, I found no\ntrace of Ramona. I have not the least idea where she is. The Father had\nnot seen her or heard of her. I fear she is dead.\"\n\n\"Better so,\" was the Senora's sole reply; and she fell again into still\ndeeper, more perplexed thought about the hidden treasure. Each day she\nresolved, \"To-morrow I will tell Felipe;\" and when to-morrow came,\nshe put it off again. Finally she decided not to do it till she found\nherself dying. Father Salvierderra might yet come once more, and\nthen all would be well. With trembling hands she wrote him a letter,\nimploring him to be brought to her, and sent it by messenger, who was\nempowered to hire a litter and four men to bring the Father gently and\ncarefully all the way. But when the messenger reached Santa Barbara,\nFather Salvierderra was too feeble to be moved; too feeble even\nto write. He could write only by amanuensis, and wrote, therefore,\nguardedly, sending her his blessing, and saying that he hoped her\nfoster-child might yet be restored to the keeping of her friends. The\nFather had been in sore straits of mind, as month after month had passed\nwithout tidings of his \"blessed child.\"\n\nSoon after this came the news that the Father was dead. This dealt the\nSenora a terrible blow. She never left her bed after it. And so the year\nhad worn on; and Felipe, mourning over his sinking and failing mother,\nand haunted by terrible fears about the lost Ramona, had been tortured\nindeed.\n\nBut the end drew near, now. The Senora was plainly dying. The Ventura\ndoctor had left off coming, saying that he could do no more; nothing\nremained but to give her what ease was possible; in a day or two more\nall would be over. Felipe hardly left her bedside. Rarely was mother so\nloved and nursed by son. No daughter could have shown more tenderness\nand devotion. In the close relation and affection of these last days,\nthe sense of alienation and antagonism faded from both their hearts.\n\n\"My adorable Felipe!\" she would murmur. \"What a son hast thou been!\"\nAnd, \"My beloved mother! How shall I give you up?\" Felipe would reply,\nbowing his head on her hands,--so wasted now, so white, so weak; those\nhands which had been cruel and strong little more than one short year\nago. Ah, no one could refuse to forgive the Senora now! The gentle\nRamona, had she seen her, had wept tears of pity. Her eyes wore at times\na look almost of terror. It was the secret. How should she speak it?\nWhat would Felipe say? At last the moment came. She had been with\ndifficulty roused from a long fainting; one more such would be the\nlast, she knew,--knew even better than those around her. As she regained\nconsciousness, she gasped, \"Felipe! Alone!\"\n\nHe understood, and waved the rest away.\n\n\"Alone!\" she said again, turning her eyes to the door.\n\n\"Leave the room,\" said Felipe; \"all--wait outside;\" and he closed the\ndoor on them. Even then the Senora hesitated. Almost was she ready to\ngo out of life leaving the hidden treasure to its chance of discovery,\nrather than with her own lips reveal to Felipe what she saw now, saw\nwith the terrible, relentless clear-sightedness of death, would make\nhim, even after she was in her grave, reproach her in his thoughts.\n\nBut she dared not withhold it. It must be said. Pointing to the statue\nof Saint Catharine, whose face seemed, she thought, to frown unforgiving\nupon her, she said, \"Felipe--behind that statue--look!\"\n\nFelipe thought her delirious, and said tenderly, \"Nothing is there,\ndearest mother. Be calm. I am here.\"\n\nNew terror seized the dying woman. Was she to be forced to carry\nthe secret to the grave? to be denied this late avowal? \"No! no!\nFelipe--there is a door there--secret door. Look! Open! I must tell\nyou!\"\n\nHastily Felipe moved the statue. There was indeed the door, as she had\nsaid.\n\n\"Do not tell me now, mother dear. Wait till you are stronger,\" he said.\nAs he spoke, he turned, and saw, with alarm, his mother sitting upright\nin the bed, her right arm outstretched, her hand pointing to the door,\nher eyes in a glassy stare, her face convulsed. Before a cry could pass\nhis lips, she had fallen back. The Senora Moreno was dead.\n\nAt Felipe's cry, the women waiting in the hall hurried in, wailing\naloud as their first glance showed them all was over. In the confusion,\nFelipe, with a pale, set face, pushed the statue back into its place.\nEven then a premonition of horror swept over him. What was he, the son,\nto find behind that secret door, at sight of which his mother had died\nwith that look of anguished terror in her eyes? All through the sad\nduties of the next four days Felipe was conscious of the undercurrent\nof this premonition. The funeral ceremonies were impressive. The little\nchapel could not hold the quarter part of those who came, from far and\nnear. Everybody wished to do honor to the Senora Moreno. A priest from\nVentura and one from San Luis Obispo were there. When all was done, they\nbore the Senora to the little graveyard on the hillside, and laid her by\nthe side of her husband and her children; silent and still at last,\nthe restless, passionate, proud, sad heart! When, the night after the\nfuneral, the servants saw Senor Felipe going into his mother's room,\nthey shuddered, and whispered, \"Oh, he must not! He will break his\nheart, Senor Felipe! How he loved her!\"\n\nOld Marda ventured to follow him, and at the threshold said: \"Dear Senor\nFelipe, do not! It is not good to go there! Come away!\"\n\nBut he put her gently by, saying, \"I would rather be here, good Marda;\"\nand went in and locked the door.\n\nIt was past midnight when he came out. His face was stern. He had buried\nhis mother again. Well might the Senora have dreaded to tell to Felipe\nthe tale of the Ortegna treasure. Until he reached the bottom of the\njewel-box, and found the Senora Ortegna's letter to his mother, he was\nin entire bewilderment at all he saw. After he had read this letter, he\nsat motionless for a long time, his head buried in his hands. His soul\nwas wrung.\n\n\"And she thought that shame, and not this!\" he said bitterly.\n\nBut one thing remained for Felipe now, If Ramona lived, he would find\nher, and restore to her this her rightful property. If she were dead, it\nmust go to the Santa Barbara College.\n\n\"Surely my mother must have intended to give it to the Church,\" he said.\n\"But why keep it all this time? It is this that has killed her. Oh,\nshame! oh, disgrace!\" From the grave in which Felipe had buried his\nmother now, was no resurrection.\n\nReplacing everything as before in the safe hiding-place, he sat down and\nwrote a letter to the Superior of the Santa Barbara College, telling\nhim of the existence of these valuables, which in certain contingencies\nwould belong to the College. Early in the morning he gave this letter to\nJuan Canito, saying: \"I am going away, Juan, on a journey. If anything\nhappens to me, and I do not return, send this letter by trusty messenger\nto Santa Barbara.\"\n\n\"Will you be long away, Senor Felipe?\" asked the old man, piteously.\n\n\"I cannot tell, Juan,\" replied Felipe. \"It may be only a short time; it\nmay be long. I leave everything in your care. You will do all according\nto your best judgment, I know. I will say to all that I have left you in\ncharge.\"\n\n\"Thanks, Senor Felipe! Thanks!\" exclaimed Juan, happier than he had been\nfor two years. \"Indeed, you may trust me! From the time you were a boy\ntill now, I have had no thought except for your house.\"\n\nEven in heaven the Senora Moreno had felt woe as if in hell, had she\nknown the thoughts with which her Felipe galloped this morning out of\nthe gateway through which, only the day before, he had walked weeping\nbehind her body borne to burial.\n\n\"And she thought this no shame to the house of Moreno!\" he said. \"My\nGod!\"\n\n\n\n\nXXII\n\nDURING the first day of Ramona's and Alessandro's sad journey they\nscarcely spoke. Alessandro walked at the horses' heads, his face sunk on\nhis breast, his eyes fixed on the ground. Ramona watched him in anxious\nfear. Even the baby's voice and cooing laugh won from him no response.\nAfter they were camped for the night, she said, \"Dear Alessandro, will\nyou not tell me where we are going?\"\n\nIn spite of her gentleness, there was a shade of wounded feeling in her\ntone. Alessandro flung himself on his knees before her, and cried: \"My\nMajella! my Majella! it seems to me I am going mad! I cannot tell what\nto do. I do not know what I think; all my thoughts seem whirling round\nas leaves do in brooks in the time of the spring rains. Do you think I\ncan be going mad? It was enough to make me!\"\n\nRamona, her own heart wrung with fear, soothed him as best she could.\n\"Dear Alessandro,\" she said, \"let us go to Los Angeles, and not live\nwith the Indians any more. You could get work there. You could play at\ndances sometimes; there must be plenty of work. I could get more sewing\nto do, too. It would be better, I think.\"\n\nHe looked horror-stricken at the thought. \"Go live among the white\npeople!\" he cried. \"What does Majella think would become of one Indian,\nor two, alone among whites? If they will come to our villages and drive\nus out a hundred at a time, what would they do to one man alone? Oh,\nMajella is foolish!\"\n\n\"But there are many of your people at work for whites at San Bernardino\nand other places,\" she persisted. \"Why could not we do as they do?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" he said bitterly, \"at work for whites; so they are, Majella has\nnot seen. No man will pay an Indian but half wages; even long ago, when\nthe Fathers were not all gone, and tried to help the Indians, my father\nhas told me that it was the way only to pay an Indian one-half that a\nwhite man or a Mexican had. It was the Mexicans, too, did that, Majella.\nAnd now they pay the Indians in money sometimes, half wages; sometimes\nin bad flour, or things he does not want; sometimes in whiskey; and if\nhe will not take it, and asks for his money, they laugh, and tell him to\ngo, then. One man in San Bernardino last year, when an Indian would not\ntake a bottle of sour wine for pay for a day's work, shot him in the\ncheek with his pistol, and told him to mind how he was insolent any\nmore! Oh, Majella, do not ask me to go work in the towns! I should kill\nsome man, Majella, if I saw things like that.\"\n\nRamona shuddered, and was silent. Alessandro continued: \"If Majella\nwould not be afraid, I know a place, high up on the mountain, where\nno white man has ever been, or ever will be. I found it when I was\nfollowing a bear. The beast led me up. It was his home; and I said then,\nit was a fit hiding-place for a man. There is water, and a little green\nvalley. We could live there; but it would be no more than to live,, it\nis very small, the valley. Majella would be afraid?\"\n\n\"Yes, Alessandro, I would be afraid, all alone on a high mountain. Oh,\ndo not let us go there! Try something else first, Alessandro. Is there\nno other Indian village you know?\"\n\n\"There is Saboba,\" he said, \"at foot of the San Jacinto Mountain; I had\nthought of that. Some of my people went there from Temecula; but it is\na poor little village, Majella. Majella would not like to live in it.\nNeither do I believe it will long be any safer than San Pasquale. There\nwas a kind, good old man who owned all that valley,--Senor Ravallo; he\nfound the village of Saboba there when he came to the country. It is one\nof the very oldest of all; he was good to all Indians, and he said they\nshould never be disturbed, never. He is dead; but his three sons have\nthe estate yet, and I think they would keep their father's promise to\nthe Indians. But you see, to-morrow, Majella, they may die, or go back\nto Mexico, as Senor Valdez did, and then the Americans will get it, as\nthey did Temecula. And there are already white men living in the valley.\nWe will go that way, Majella. Majella shall see. If she says stay, we\nwill stay.\"\n\nIt was in the early afternoon that they entered the broad valley of San\nJacinto. They entered it from the west. As they came in, though the sky\nover their heads was overcast and gray, the eastern and northeastern\npart of the valley was flooded with a strange light, at once ruddy and\ngolden. It was a glorious sight. The jagged top and spurs of San Jacinto\nMountain shone like the turrets and posterns of a citadel built of\nrubies. The glow seemed preternatural.\n\n\"Behold San Jacinto!\" cried Alessandro.\n\nRamona exclaimed in delight. \"It is an omen!\" she said. \"We are going\ninto the sunlight, out of the shadow;\" and she glanced back at the west,\nwhich was of a slaty blackness.\n\n\"I like it not!\" said Alessandro. \"The shadow follows too fast!\"\n\nIndeed it did. Even as he spoke, a fierce wind blew from the north, and\ntearing off fleeces from the black cloud, sent them in scurrying masses\nacross the sky. In a moment more, snow-flakes began to fall.\n\n\"Holy Virgin!\" cried Alessandro. Too well he knew what it meant. He\nurged the horses, running fast beside them. It was of no use. Too much\neven for Baba and Benito to make any haste, with the heavily loaded\nwagon.\n\n\"There is an old sheep-corral and a hut not over a mile farther, if we\ncould but reach it!\" groaned Alessandro. \"Majella, you and the child\nwill freeze.\"\n\n\"She is warm on my breast,\" said Ramona; \"but, Alessandro, what ice in\nthis wind! It is like a knife at my back!\"\n\nAlessandro uttered another ejaculation of dismay. The snow was fast\nthickening; already the track was covered. The wind lessened.\n\n\"Thank God, that wind no longer cuts as it did,\" said Ramona, her teeth\nchattering, clasping the baby closer and closer.\n\n\"I would rather it blew than not,\" said Alessandro; \"it will carry the\nsnow before it. A little more of this, and we cannot see, any more than\nin the night.\"\n\nStill thicker and faster fell the snow; the air was dense; it was, as\nAlessandro had said, worse than the darkness of night,--this strange\nopaque whiteness, thick, choking, freezing one's breath. Presently\nthe rough jolting of the wagon showed that they were off the road. The\nhorses stopped; refused to go on.\n\n\"We are lost, if we stay here!\" cried Alessandro. \"Come, my Benito,\ncome!\" and he took him by the head, and pulled him by main force back\ninto the road, and led him along. It was terrible. Ramona's heart sank\nwithin her. She felt her arms growing numb; how much longer could she\nhold the baby safe? She called to Alessandro. He did not hear her; the\nwind had risen again; the snow was being blown in masses; it was like\nmaking headway among whirling snow-drifts.\n\n\"We will die,\" thought Ramona. \"Perhaps it is as well!\" And that was the\nlast she knew, till she heard a shouting, and found herself being shaken\nand beaten, and heard a strange voice saying, \"Sorry ter handle yer so\nrough, ma'am, but we've got ter git yer out ter the fire!\"\n\n\"Fire!\" Were there such things as fire and warmth? Mechanically she put\nthe baby into the unknown arms that were reaching up to her, and tried\nto rise from her seat; but she could not move.\n\n\"Set still! set still!\" said the strange voice. \"I'll jest carry the\nbaby ter my wife, an' come back fur you. I allowed yer couldn't git up\non yer feet;\" and the tall form disappeared. The baby, thus vigorously\ndisturbed from her warm sleep, began to cry.\n\n\"Thank God!\" said Alessandro, at the plunging horses' heads. \"The child\nis alive! Majella!\" he called.\n\n\"Yes, Alessandro,\" she answered faintly, the gusts sweeping her voice\nlike a distant echo past him.\n\nIt was a marvellous rescue. They had been nearer the old sheep-corral\nthan Alessandro had thought; but except that other storm-beaten\ntravellers had reached it before them, Alessandro had never found it.\nJust as he felt his strength failing him, and had thought to himself,\nin almost the same despairing words as Ramona, \"This will end all our\ntroubles,\" he saw a faint light to the left. Instantly he had turned the\nhorses' heads towards it. The ground was rough and broken, and more than\nonce he had been in danger of overturning the wagon; but he had pressed\non, shouting at intervals for help. At last his call was answered, and\nanother light appeared; this time a swinging one, coming slowly towards\nhim,--a lantern, in the hand of a man, whose first words, \"Wall,\nstranger, I allow yer inter trouble,\" were as intelligible to Alessandro\nas if they had been spoken in the purest San Luiseno dialect.\n\nNot so, to the stranger, Alessandro's grateful reply in Spanish.\n\n\"Another o' these no-'count Mexicans, by thunder!\" thought Jeff Hyer to\nhimself. \"Blamed ef I'd lived in a country all my life, ef I wouldn't\nknow better'n to git caught out in such weather's this!\" And as he put\nthe crying babe into his wife's arms, he said half impatiently, \"Ef I'd\nknowed 't wuz Mexicans, Ri, I wouldn't ev' gone out ter 'um. They're\nmore ter hum 'n I am, 'n these yer tropicks.\"\n\n\"Naow, Jeff, yer know yer wouldn't let ennythin' in shape ev a human\ncreetur go perishin' past aour fire sech weather's this,\" replied the\nwoman, as she took the baby, which recognized the motherly hand at its\nfirst touch, and ceased crying.\n\n\"Why, yer pooty, blue-eyed little thing!\" she exclaimed, as she looked\ninto the baby's face. \"I declar, Jos, think o' sech a mite's this bein'\naout'n this weather. I'll jest warm up some milk for it this minnit.\"\n\n\"Better see't th' mother fust, Ri,\" said Jeff, leading, half carrying,\nRamona into the hut. \"She's nigh abaout froze stiff!\"\n\nBut the sight of her baby safe and smiling was a better restorative for\nRamona than anything else, and in a few moments she had fully recovered.\nIt was in a strange group she found herself. On a mattress, in the\ncorner of the hut, lay a young man apparently about twenty-five, whose\nbright eyes and flushed cheeks told but too plainly the story of his\ndisease. The woman, tall, ungainly, her face gaunt, her hands hardened\nand wrinkled, gown ragged, shoes ragged, her dry and broken light hair\nwound in a careless, straggling knot in her neck, wisps of it flying\nover her forehead, was certainly not a prepossessing figure. Yet spite\nof her careless, unkempt condition, there was a certain gentle dignity\nin her bearing, and a kindliness in her glance, which won trust and\nwarmed hearts at once. Her pale blue eyes were still keen-sighted; and\nas she fixed them on Ramona, she thought to herself, \"This ain't no\ncommon Mexican, no how.\" \"Be ye movers?\" she said.\n\nRamona stared. In the little English she knew, that word was not\nincluded. \"Ah, Senora,\" she said regretfully, \"I cannot talk in the\nEnglish speech; only in Spanish.\"\n\n\"Spanish, eh? Yer mean Mexican? Jos, hyar, he kin talk thet. He can't\ntalk much, though; 'tain't good fur him; his lungs is out er kilter.\nThet's what we're bringin' him hyar fur,--fur warm climate! 'pears\nlike it, don't it?\" and she chuckled grimly, but with a side glance of\nineffable tenderness at the sick man. \"Ask her who they be, Jos,\" she\nadded.\n\nJos lifted himself on his elbow, and fixing his shining eyes on Ramona,\nsaid in Spanish, \"My mother asks if you are travellers?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Ramona. \"We have come all the way from San Diego. We are\nIndians.\"\n\n\"Injuns!\" ejaculated Jos's mother. \"Lord save us, Jos! Hev we reelly\ntook in Injuns? What on airth--Well, well, she's fond uv her baby's enny\nwhite woman! I kin see thet; an', Injun or no Injun, they've got to stay\nnaow. Yer couldn't turn a dog out 'n sech weather's this. I bet thet\nbaby's father wuz white, then. Look at them blue eyes.\"\n\nRamona listened and looked intently, but could understand nothing.\nAlmost she doubted if the woman were really speaking English. She had\nnever before heard so many English sentences without being able to\nunderstand one word. The Tennessee drawl so altered even the commonest\nwords, that she did not recognize them. Turning to Jos, she said gently,\n\"I know very little English. I am so sorry I cannot understand. Will it\ntire you to interpret to me what your mother said?\"\n\nJos was as full of humor as his mother. \"She wants me to tell her what\nyou wuz sayin',\" he said, \"I allow, I'll only tell her the part on't\nshe'll like best.--My mother says you can stay here with us till the\nstorm is over,\" he said to Ramona.\n\nSwifter than lightning, Ramona had seized the woman's hand and carried\nit to her heart, with an expressive gesture of gratitude and emotion.\n\"Thanks! thanks! Senora!\" she cried.\n\n\"What is it she calls me, Jos?\" asked his mother.\n\n\"Senora,\" he replied. \"It only means the same as lady.\"\n\n\"Shaw, Jos! You tell her I ain't any lady. Tell her everybody round\nwhere we live calls me 'Aunt Ri,' or 'Mis Hyer;' she kin call me\nwhichever she's a mind to. She's reel sweet-spoken.\"\n\nWith some difficulty Jos explained his mother's disclaimer of the title\nof Senora, and the choice of names she offered to Ramona.\n\nRamona, with smiles which won both mother and son, repeated after him\nboth names, getting neither exactly right at first trial, and finally\nsaid, \"I like 'Aunt Ri' best; she is so kind, like aunt, to every one.\"\n\n\"Naow, ain't thet queer, Jos,\" said Aunt Ri, \"aout here 'n thes\nwilderness to ketch sumbody sayin' thet,--jest what they all say ter\nhum? I donno's I'm enny kinder'n ennybody else. I don't want ter see\nennybody put upon, nor noways sufferin', ef so be's I kin help; but thet\nain't ennythin' stronary, ez I know. I donno how ennybody could feel\nenny different.\"\n\n\"There's lots doos, mammy,\" replied Jos, affectionately. \"Yer'd find out\nfast enuf, ef yer went raound more. There's mighty few's good's you air\nter everybody.\"\n\nRamona was crouching in the corner by the fire, her baby held close to\nher breast. The place which at first had seemed a haven of warmth, she\nnow saw was indeed but a poor shelter against the fearful storm which\nraged outside. It was only a hut of rough boards, carelessly knocked\ntogether for a shepherd's temporary home. It had been long unused, and\nmany of the boards were loose and broken. Through these crevices, at\nevery blast of the wind, the fine snow swirled. On the hearth were\nburning a few sticks of wood, dead cottonwood branches, which Jef Hyer\nhad hastily collected before the storm reached its height. A few more\nsticks lay by the hearth. Aunt Ri glanced at them anxiously. A poor\nprovision for a night in the snow. \"Be ye warm, Jos?\" she asked.\n\n\"Not very, mammy,\" he said; \"but I ain't cold, nuther; an' thet's\nsomethin'.\"\n\nIt was the way in the Hyer family to make the best of things; they had\nalways possessed this virtue to such an extent, that they suffered\nfrom it as from a vice. There was hardly to be found in all Southern\nTennessee a more contented, shiftless, ill-bestead family than theirs.\nBut there was no grumbling. Whatever went wrong, whatever was lacking,\nit was \"jest like aour luck,\" they said, and did nothing, or next to\nnothing, about it. Good-natured, affectionate, humorous people; after\nall, they got more comfort out of life than many a family whose surface\nconditions were incomparably better than theirs. When Jos, their oldest\nchild and only son, broke down, had hemorrhage after hemorrhage, and\nthe doctor said the only thing that could save him was to go across the\nplains in a wagon to California, they said, \"What good luck 'Lizy was\nmarried last year! Now there ain't nuthin' ter hinder sellin' the farm\n'n goin' right off.\" And they sold their little place for half it was\nworth, traded cattle for a pair of horses and a covered wagon, and set\noff, half beggared, with their sick boy on a bed in the bottom of the\nwagon, as cheery as if they were rich people on a pleasure-trip. A pair\nof steers \"to spell\" the horses, and a cow to give milk for Jos, they\ndrove before them; and so they had come by slow stages, sometimes\ncamping for a week at a time, all the way from Tennessee to the San\nJacinto Valley. They were rewarded. Jos was getting well. Another six\nmonths, they thought, would see him cured; and it would have gone hard\nwith any one who had tried to persuade either Jefferson or Maria Hyer\nthat they were not as lucky a couple as could be found. Had they not\nsaved Joshua, their son?\n\nNicknames among this class of poor whites in the South seem singularly\nlike those in vogue in New England. From totally opposite motives, the\nlazy, easy-going Tennesseean and the hurry-driven Vermonter cut down all\ntheir family names to the shortest. To speak three syllables where one\nwill answer, seems to the Vermonter a waste of time; to the Tennesseean,\nquite too much trouble. Mrs. Hyer could hardly recollect ever having\nheard her name, \"Maria,\" in full; as a child, and until she was married,\nshe was simply \"Ri;\" and as soon as she had a house of her own, to\nbecome a centre of hospitality and help, she was adopted by common\nconsent of the neighborhood, in a sort of titular and universal\naunt-hood, which really was a much greater tribute and honor than she\ndreamed. Not a man, woman, or child, within her reach, that did not call\nher or know of her as \"Aunt Ri.\"\n\n\"I donno whether I'd best make enny more fire naow or not,\" she said\nreflectively; \"ef this storm's goin' to last till mornin', we'll come\nshort o' wood, thet's clear.\" As she spoke, the door of the hut burst\nopen, and her husband staggered in, followed by Alessandro, both covered\nwith snow, their arms full of wood. Alessandro, luckily, knew of a\nlittle clump of young cottonwood-trees in a ravine, only a few rods from\nthe house; and the first thing he had thought of, after tethering the\nhorses in shelter between the hut and the wagons, was to get wood. Jeff,\nseeing him take a hatchet from the wagon, had understood, got his own,\nand followed; and now there lay on the ground enough to keep them warm\nfor hours. As soon as Alessandro had thrown down his load, he darted to\nRamona, and kneeling down, looked anxiously into the baby's face, then\ninto hers; then he said devoutly, \"The saints be praised, my Majella! It\nis a miracle!\"\n\nJos listened in dismay to this ejaculation. \"Ef they ain't Catholics!\"\nhe thought. \"What kind o' Injuns be they I wonder. I won't tell mammy\nthey're Catholics; she'd feel wuss'n ever. I don't care what they be.\nThet gal's got the sweetest eyes'n her head ever I saw sence I wuz\nborn.\"\n\nBy help of Jos's interpreting, the two families soon became well\nacquainted with each other's condition and plans; and a feeling of\nfriendliness, surprising under the circumstances, grew up between them.\n\n\"Jeff,\" said Aunt Ri,--\"Jeff, they can't understand a word we say,\nso't's no harm done, I s'pose, to speak afore 'em, though't don't seem\nhardly fair to take advantage o' their not knowin' any language but\ntheir own; but I jest tell you thet I've got a lesson'n the subjeck uv\nInjuns. I've always hed a reel mean feelin' about 'em; I didn't want ter\ncome nigh 'em, nor ter hev 'em come nigh me. This woman, here, she's ez\nsweet a creetur's ever I see; 'n' ez bound up 'n thet baby's yer could\nask enny woman to be; 'n' 's fur thet man, can't yer see, Jeff, he jest\nworships the ground she walks on? Thet's a fact, Jeff. I donno's ever I\nsee a white man think so much uv a woman; come, naow, Jeff, d' yer think\nyer ever did yerself?\"\n\nAunt Ri was excited. The experience was, to her, almost incredible. Her\nideas of Indians had been drawn from newspapers, and from a book or two\nof narratives of massacres, and from an occasional sight of vagabond\nbands or families they had encountered in their journey across the\nplains. Here she found herself sitting side by side in friendly\nintercourse with an Indian man and Indian woman, whose appearance and\nbehavior were attractive; towards whom she felt herself singularly\ndrawn.\n\n\"I'm free to confess, Jos,\" she said, \"I wouldn't ha' bleeved it. I\nhain't seen nobody, black, white, or gray, sence we left hum, I've took\nto like these yere folks. An' they're real dark; 's dark's any nigger in\nTennessee; 'n' he's pewer Injun; her father wuz white, she sez, but she\ndon't call herself nothin' but an Injun, the same's he is. D' yer\nnotice the way she looks at him, Jos? Don't she jest set a store by thet\nfeller? 'N' I don't blame her.\"\n\nIndeed, Jos had noticed. No man was likely to see Ramona with Alessandro\nwithout perceiving the rare quality of her devotion to him. And now\nthere was added to this devotion an element of indefinable anxiety which\nmade its vigilance unceasing. Ramona feared for Alessandro's reason.\nShe had hardly put it into words to herself, but the terrible fear dwelt\nwith her. She felt that another blow would be more than he could bear.\n\nThe storm lasted only a few hours. When it cleared, the valley was a\nsolid expanse of white, and the stars shone out as if in an Arctic sky.\n\n\"It will be all gone by noon to-morrow,\" said Alessandro to Jos, who was\ndreading the next day.\n\n\"Not really!\" he said.\n\n\"You will see,\" said Alessandro. \"I have often known it thus. It is like\ndeath while it lasts; but it is never long.\"\n\nThe Hyers were on their way to some hot springs on the north side of the\nvalley. Here they proposed to camp for three months, to try the waters\nfor Jos. They had a tent, and all that was necessary for living in their\nprimitive fashion. Aunt Ri was looking forward to the rest with great\nanticipation; she was heartily tired of being on the move. Her husband's\nanticipations were of a more stirring nature. He had heard that there\nwas good hunting on San Jacinto Mountain. When he found that Alessandro\nknew the region thoroughly, and had been thinking of settling there, he\nwas rejoiced, and proposed to him to become his companion and guide\nin hunting expeditions. Ramona grasped eagerly at the suggestion;\ncompanionship, she was sure, would do Alessandro good,--companionship,\nthe outdoor life, and the excitement of hunting, of which he was fond.\nThis hot-spring canon was only a short distance from the Saboba village,\nof which they had spoken as a possible home; which she had from the\nfirst desired to try. She no longer had repugnance to the thought of an\nIndian village; she already felt a sense of kinship and shelter with any\nIndian people. She had become, as Carmena had said, \"one of them.\"\n\nA few days saw the two families settled,--the Hyers in their tent and\nwagon, at the hot springs, and Alessandro and Ramona, with the baby, in\na little adobe house in the Saboba village. The house belonged to an\nold Indian woman who, her husband having died, had gone to live with\na daughter, and was very glad to get a few dollars by renting her own\nhouse. It was a wretched place; one small room, walled with poorly made\nadobe bricks, thatched with tule, no floor, and only one window. When\nAlessandro heard Ramona say cheerily, \"Oh, this will do very well, when\nit is repaired a little,\" his face was convulsed, and he turned away;\nbut he said nothing. It was the only house to be had in the village,\nand there were few better. Two months later, no one would have known it.\nAlessandro had had good luck in hunting. Two fine deerskins covered the\nearth floor; a third was spread over the bedstead; and the horns, hung\non the walls, served for hooks to hang clothes upon. The scarlet calico\ncanopy was again set up over the bed, and the woven cradle, on its red\nmanzanita frame, stood near. A small window in the door, and one more\ncut in the walls, let in light and air. On a shelf near one of these\nwindows stood the little Madonna, again wreathed with vines as in San\nPasquale.\n\nWhen Aunt Ri first saw the room, after it was thus arranged, she put\nboth arms akimbo, and stood in the doorway, her mouth wide open, her\neyes full of wonder. Finally her wonder framed itself in an ejaculation:\n\"Wall, I allow yer air fixed up!\"\n\nAunt Ri, at her best estate, had never possessed a room which had\nthe expression of this poor little mud hut of Ramona's. She could not\nunderstand it. The more she studied the place, the less she understood\nit. On returning to the tent, she said to Jos: \"It beats all ever I\nsee, the way thet Injun woman's got fixed up out er nothin'. It ain't no\nmore'n a hovel, a mud hovel, Jos, not much bigger'n this yer tent, fur\nall three on 'em, an' the bed an' the stove an' everythin'; an' I vow,\nJos, she's fixed it so't looks jest like a parlor! It beats me, it does.\nI'd jest like you to see it.\"\n\nAnd when Jos saw it, and Jeff, they were as full of wonder as Aunt Ri\nhad been. Dimly they recognized the existence of a principle here which\nhad never entered into their life. They did not know it by name, and\nit could not have been either taught, transferred, or explained to the\ngood-hearted wife and mother who had been so many years the affectionate\ndisorderly genius of their home. But they felt its charm; and when,\none day, after the return of Alessandro and Jeff from a particularly\nsuccessful hunt, the two families had sat down together to a supper\nof Ramona's cooking,--stewed venison and artichokes, and frijoles with\nchili,--their wonder was still greater.\n\n\"Ask her if this is Injun style of cooking, Jos,\" said Aunt Ri. \"I never\nthought nothin' o' beans; but these air good, 'n' no mistake!\"\n\nRamona laughed. \"No; it is Mexican,\" she said. \"I learned to cook from\nan old Mexican woman.\"\n\n\"Wall, I'd like the receipt on't; but I allow I shouldn't never git the\ntime to fuss with it,\" said Aunt Ri; \"but I may's well git the rule,\nnaow I'm here.\"\n\nAlessandro began to lose some of his gloom. He had earned money. He\nhad been lifted out of himself by kindly companionship; he saw Ramona\ncheerful, the little one sunny; the sense of home, the strongest passion\nAlessandro possessed, next to his love for Ramona, began again to awake\nin him. He began to talk about building a house. He had found things in\nthe village better than he feared. It was but a poverty-stricken little\nhandful, to be sure; still, they were unmolested; the valley was large;\ntheir stock ran free; the few white settlers, one at the upper end and\ntwo or three on the south side, had manifested no disposition to crowd\nthe Indians; the Ravallo brothers were living on the estate still,\nand there was protection in that, Alessandro thought. And Majella was\ncontent. Majella had found friends. Something, not quite hope, but akin\nto it, began to stir in Alessandro's heart. He would build a house;\nMajella should no longer live in this mud hut. But to his surprise, when\nhe spoke of it, Ramona said no; they had all they needed, now. Was not\nAlessandro comfortable? She was. It would be wise to wait longer before\nbuilding.\n\nRamona knew many things that Alessandro did not. While he had been away\non his hunts, she had had speech with many a one he never saw. She had\ngone to the store and post-office several times, to exchange baskets or\nlace for flour, and she had heard talk there which disquieted her. She\ndid not believe that Saboba was safe. One day she had heard a man say,\n\"If there is a drought we shall have the devil to pay with our stock\nbefore winter is over.\" \"Yes,\" said another; \"and look at those damned\nIndians over there in Saboba, with water running all the time in their\nvillage! It's a shame they should have that spring!\"\n\nNot for worlds would Ramona have told this to Alessandro. She kept it\nlocked in her own breast, but it rankled there like a ceaseless warning\nand prophecy. When she reached home that day she went down to the spring\nin the centre of the village, and stood a long time looking at the\nbubbling water. It was indeed a priceless treasure; a long irrigating\nditch led from it down into the bottom, where lay the cultivated\nfields,--many acres in wheat, barley, and vegetables. Alessandro himself\nhad fields there from which they would harvest all they needed for the\nhorses and their cow all winter, in case pasturage failed. If the whites\ntook away this water, Saboba would be ruined. However, as the spring\nbegan in the very heart of the village, they could not take it without\ndestroying the village. \"And the Ravallos would surely never let that be\ndone,\" thought Ramona. \"While they live, it will not happen.\"\n\nIt was a sad day for Ramona and Alessandro when the kindly Hyers pulled\nup their tent-stakes and left the valley. Their intended three months\nhad stretched into six, they had so enjoyed the climate, and the waters\nhad seemed to do such good to Jos. But, \"We ain't rich folks, yer know,\nnot by a long ways, we ain't,\" said Aunt Ri; \"an' we've got pretty nigh\ndown to where Jeff an' me's got to begin airnin' suthin'. Ef we kin git\nsettled 'n some o' these towns where there's carpenterin' to be done.\nJeff, he's a master hand to thet kind o' work, though yer mightn't\nthink it; 'n I kin airn right smart at weavin'; jest give me a good\ncarpet-loom, 'n I won't be beholden to nobody for vittles. I jest du\nlove weavin'. I donno how I've contented myself this hull year, or nigh\nabout a year, without a loom. Jeff, he sez to me once, sez he, 'Ri, do\nyer think yer'd be contented in heaven without yer loom?' an' I was free\nto say I didn't know's I should.\"\n\n\"Is it hard?\" cried Ramona. \"Could I learn to do it?\" It was wonderful\nwhat progress in understanding and speaking English Ramona had made in\nthese six months. She now understood nearly all that was said directly\nto her, though she could not follow general and confused conversation.\n\n\"Wall, 'tis, an' 'tain't,\" said Aunt Ri. \"I don't s'pose I'm much of a\njedge; fur I can't remember when I fust learned it. I know I set in\nthe loom to weave when my feet couldn't reach the floor; an' I don't\nremember nothin' about fust learnin' to spool 'n' warp. I've tried to\nteach lots of folks; an' sum learns quick, an' some don't never learn;\nit's jest 's 't strikes 'em. I should think, naow, thet you wuz one o'\nthe kind could turn yer hands to anythin'. When we get settled in San\nBernardino, if yer'll come down thar, I'll teach yer all I know, 'n' be\nglad ter. I donno's 't 's goin' to be much uv a place for carpet-weavin'\nthough, anywheres raound 'n this yer country; not but what thar's plenty\no' rags, but folks seems to be wearin' 'em; pooty gen'ral wear, I sh'd\nsay. I've seen more cloes on folks' backs hyar, thet wan't no more'n fit\nfor carpet-rags, than any place ever I struck. They're drefful sheftless\nlot, these yere Mexicans; 'n' the Injuns is wuss. Naow when I say\nInjuns, I don't never mean yeow, yer know thet. Yer ain't ever seemed to\nme one mite like an Injun.\"\n\n\"Most of our people haven't had any chance,\" said Ramona. \"You wouldn't\nbelieve if I were to tell you what things have been done to them; how\nthey are robbed, and cheated, and turned out of their homes.\"\n\nThen she told the story of Temecula, and of San Pasquale, in Spanish, to\nJos, who translated it with no loss in the telling. Aunt Ri was aghast;\nshe found no words to express her indignation.\n\n\"I don't bleeve the Guvvermunt knows anything about it.\" she said. \"Why,\nthey take folks up, n'n penetentiarize 'em fur life, back 'n Tennessee,\nfur things thet ain't so bad's thet! Somebody ought ter be sent ter tell\n'em 't Washington what's goin' on hyar.\"\n\n\"I think it's the people in Washington that have done it,\" said Ramona,\nsadly. \"Is it not in Washington all the laws are made?\"\n\n\"I bleeve so!\" said Aunt Ri, \"Ain't it, Jos? It's Congress ain't 't,\nmakes the laws?\"\n\n\"I bleeve so.\" said Jos. \"They make some, at any rate. I donno's they\nmake 'em all.\"\n\n\"It is all done by the American law,\" said Ramona, \"all these things;\nnobody can help himself; for if anybody goes against the law he has to\nbe killed or put in prison; that was what the sheriff told Alessandro,\nat Temecula. He felt very sorry for the Temecula people, the sheriff\ndid; but he had to obey the law himself. Alessandro says there isn't any\nhelp.\"\n\nAunt Ri shook her head. She was not convinced. \"I sh'll make a business\no' findin' out abaout this thing yit,\" she said. \"I think yer hain't got\nthe rights on't yit. There's cheatin' somewhere!\"\n\n\"It's all cheating.\" said Ramona; \"but there isn't any help for it, Aunt\nRi. The Americans think it is no shame to cheat for money.\"\n\n\"I'm an Ummeriken!\" cried Aunt Ri; \"an' Jeff Hyer, and Jos! We're\nUmmerikens! 'n' we wouldn't cheat nobody, not ef we knowed it, not\nout er a doller. We're pore, an' I allus expect to be, but we're above\ncheatin'; an' I tell you, naow, the Ummeriken people don't want any o'\nthis cheatin' done, naow! I'm going to ask Jeff haow 'tis. Why, it's a\nburnin' shame to any country! So 'tis! I think something oughter be done\nabaout it! I wouldn't mind goin' myself, ef thar wan't anybody else!\"\n\nA seed had been sown in Aunt Ri's mind which was not destined to die for\nwant of soil. She was hot with shame and anger, and full of impulse to\ndo something. \"I ain't nobody,\" she said; \"I know thet well enough,--I\nain't nobody nor nothin'; but I allow I've got suthin' to say abaout the\ncountry I live in, 'n' the way things hed oughter be; or 't least Jeff\nhez; 'n' thet's the same thing. I tell yer, Jos, I ain't goin' to rest,\nnor ter give yeou 'n' yer father no rest nuther, till yeou find aout\nwhat all this yere means she's been tellin' us.\"\n\nBut sharper and closer anxieties than any connected with rights to lands\nand homes were pressing upon Alessandro and Ramona. All summer the baby\nhad been slowly drooping; so slowly that it was each day possible for\nRamona to deceive herself, thinking that there had been since yesterday\nno loss, perhaps a little gain; but looking back from the autumn to the\nspring, and now from the winter to the autumn, there was no doubt that\nshe had been steadily going down. From the day of that terrible chill\nin the snow-storm, she had never been quite well, Ramona thought. Before\nthat, she was strong, always strong, always beautiful and merry, Now her\npinched little face was sad to see, and sometimes for hours she made a\nfeeble wailing cry without any apparent cause. All the simple remedies\nthat Aunt Ri had known, had failed to touch her disease; in fact,\nAunt Ri from the first had been baffled in her own mind by the child's\nsymptoms. Day after day Alessandro knelt by the cradle, his hands\nclasped, his face set. Hour after hour, night and day, indoors and out,\nhe bore her in his arms, trying to give her relief. Prayer after prayer\nto the Virgin, to the saints, Ramona had said; and candles by the dozen,\nthough money was now scant, she had burned before the Madonna; all in\nvain. At last she implored Alessandro to go to San Bernardino and see a\ndoctor. \"Find Aunt Ri,\" she said; \"she will go with you, with Jos, and\ntalk to him; she can make him understand. Tell Aunt Ri she seems just as\nshe did when they were here, only weaker and thinner.\"\n\nAlessandro found Aunt Ri in a sort of shanty on the outskirts of San\nBernardino. \"Not to rights yit,\" she said,--as if she ever would be.\nJeff had found work; and Jos, too, had been able to do a little on\npleasant days. He had made a loom and put up a loom-house for his\nmother,--a floor just large enough to hold the loom, rough walls, and\na roof; one small square window,--that was all; but if Aunt Ri had\nbeen presented with a palace, she would not have been so well pleased.\nAlready she had woven a rag carpet for herself, was at work on one for\na neighbor, and had promised as many more as she could do before spring;\nthe news of the arrival of a rag-carpet weaver having gone with despatch\nall through the lower walks of San Bernardino life. \"I wouldn't hev\nbleeved they hed so many rags besides what they're wearin',\" said Aunt\nRi, as sack after sack appeared at her door. Already, too, Aunt Ri\nhad gathered up the threads of the village life; in her friendly,\nimpressionable way she had come into relation with scores of people, and\nknew who was who, and what was what, and why, among them all, far better\nthan many an old resident of the town.\n\nWhen she saw Benito galloping up to her door, she sprang down from\nher high stool at the loom, and ran bareheaded to the gate, and before\nAlessandro had dismounted, cried: \"Ye're jest the man I wanted; I've\nbeen tryin' to 'range it so's we could go down 'n' see yer, but Jeff\ncouldn't leave the job he's got; an' I'm druv nigh abaout off my feet,\n'n' I donno when we'd hev fetched it. How's all? Why didn't yer come in\nther wagon 'n' fetch 'em 'long? I've got heaps ter tell yer. I allowed\nyer hadn't got the rights o' all them things. The Guvvermunt ain't on\nthe side o' the thieves, as yer said. I knowed they couldn't be,' an'\nthey've jest sent out a man a purpose to look after things fur yer,--to\ntake keer o' the Injuns 'n' nothin' else. That's what he's here fur. He\ncome last month; he's a reel nice man. I seen him 'n' talked with him a\nspell, last week; I'm gwine to make his wife a rag carpet. 'N' there's\na doctor, too, to 'tend ter yer when ye're sick, 'n' the Guvvermunt pays\nhim; yer don't hev to pay nothin'; 'n' I tell yeow, thet's a heap o'\nsavin', to git yer docterin' fur nuthin'!\"\n\nAunt Ri was out of breath. Alessandro had not understood half she said.\nHe looked about helplessly for Jos. Jos was away. In his broken English\nhe tried to explain what Ramona had wished her to do.\n\n\"Doctor! Thet's jest what I'm tellin' yer! There is one here's paid by\nthe Guvvermunt to 'tend to the Injuns thet's sick. I'll go 'n' show yer\nter his house. I kin tell him jest how the baby is. P'r'aps he'll drive\ndown 'n' see her!\"\n\nAh! if he would! What would Majella say, should she see him enter the\ndoor bringing a doctor!\n\nLuckily Jos returned in time to go with them to the doctor's house as\ninterpreter. Alessandro was bewildered. He could not understand this new\nphase of affairs, Could it be true? As they walked along, he listened\nwith trembling, half-incredulous hope to Jos's interpretation of Aunt\nRi's voluble narrative.\n\nThe doctor was in his office. To Aunt Ri's statement of Alessandro's\nerrand he listened indifferently, and then said, \"Is he an Agency\nIndian?\"\n\n\"A what?\" exclaimed Aunt Ri.\n\n\"Does he belong to the Agency? Is his name on the Agency books?\"\n\n\"No,\" said she; \"he never heern uv any Agency till I wuz tellin' him,\njest naow. We knoo him, him 'n' her, over 'n San Jacinto. He lives in\nSaboba. He's never been to San Bernardino sence the Agent come aout.\"\n\n\"Well, is he going to put his name down on the books?\" said the doctor,\nimpatiently. \"You ought to have taken him to the Agent first.\"\n\n\"Ain't you the Guvvermunt doctor for all Injuns?\" asked Aunt Ri,\nwrathfully. \"Thet's what I heerd.\"\n\n\"Well, my good woman, you hear a great deal, I expect, that isn't true;\"\nand the doctor laughed coarsely but not ill-naturedly, Alessandro all\nthe time studying his face with the scrutiny of one awaiting life and\ndeath; \"I am the Agency physician, and I suppose all the Indians will\nsooner or later come in and report themselves to the Agent; you'd better\ntake this man over there. What does he want now?\"\n\nAunt Ri began to explain the baby's case. Cutting her short, the doctor\nsaid, \"Yes, yes, I understand. I'll give him something that will\nhelp her;\" and going into an inner room, he brought out a bottle of\ndark-colored liquid, wrote a few lines of prescription, and handed it to\nAlessandro, saying, \"That will do her good, I guess.\"\n\n\"Thanks, Senor, thanks,\" said Alessandro.\n\nThe doctor stared. \"That's the first Indian's said 'Thank you' in this\noffice,\" he said. \"You tell the Agent you've brought him a rara avis.\"\n\n\"What's that, Jos?\" said Aunt Ri, as they went out.\n\n\"Donno!\" said Jos. \"I don't like thet man, anyhow, mammy. He's no good.\"\n\nAlessandro looked at the bottle of medicine like one in a dream. Would\nit make the baby well? Had it indeed been given to him by that great\nGovernment in Washington? Was he to be protected now? Could this man,\nwho had been sent out to take care of Indians, get back his San Pasquale\nfarm for him? Alessandro's brain was in a whirl.\n\nFrom the doctor's office they went to the Agent's house. Here, Aunt Ri\nfelt herself more at home.\n\n\"I've brought ye thet Injun I wuz tellin' ye uv,\" she said, with a wave\nof her hand toward Alessandro. \"We've ben ter ther doctor's to git some\nmetcen fur his baby. She's reel sick, I'm afeerd.\"\n\nThe Agent sat down at his desk, opened a large ledger, saying as he did\nso, \"The man's never been here before, has he?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Aunt Ri.\n\n\"What is his name?\"\n\nJos gave it, and the Agent began to write it in the book. \"Stop him.\"\ncried Alessandro, agitatedly to Jos. \"Don't let him write, till I know\nwhat he puts my name in his book for!\"\n\n\"Wait,\" said Jos. \"He doesn't want you to write his name in that book.\nHe wants to know what it's put there for.\"\n\nWheeling his chair with a look of suppressed impatience, yet trying\nto speak kindly, the Agent said: \"There's no making these Indians\nunderstand anything. They seem to think if I have their names in my\nbook, it gives me some power over them.\"\n\n\"Wall, don't it?\" said the direct-minded Aunt Ri. \"Hain't yer got any\npower over 'em? If yer hain't got it over them, who have yer got it\nover? What yer goin' to do for 'em?\"\n\nThe Agent laughed in spite of himself. \"Well, Aunt Ri,\"--she was already\n\"Aunt Ri\" to the Agent's boys,--\"that's just the trouble with this\nAgency. It is very different from what it would be if I had all my\nIndians on a reservation.\"\n\nAlessandro understood the words \"my Indians.\" He had heard them before.\n\n\"What does he mean by his Indians, Jos?\" he asked fiercely. \"I will not\nhave my name in his book if it makes me his.\"\n\nWhen Jos reluctantly interpreted this, the Agent lost his temper.\n\"That's all the use there is trying to do anything with them! Let him\ngo, then, if he doesn't want any help from the Government!\"\n\n\"Oh, no, no.\" cried Aunt Ri. \"Yeow jest explain it to Jos, an' he'll\nmake him understand.\"\n\nAlessandro's face had darkened. All this seemed to him exceedingly\nsuspicious. Could it be possible that Aunt Ri and Jos, the first whites\nexcept Mr. Hartsel he had ever trusted, were deceiving him? No; that was\nimpossible. But they themselves might be deceived. That they were simple\nand ignorant, Alessandro well knew. \"Let us go!\" he said. \"I do not wish\nto sign any paper.\"\n\n\"Naow don't be a fool, will yeow? Yeow ain't signin' a thing!\" said Aunt\nRi. \"Jos, yeow tell him I say there ain't anythin' a bindin' him, hevin'\nhis name 'n' thet book, It's only so the Agent kin know what Injuns\nwants help, 'n' where they air. Ain't thet so?\" she added, turning to\nthe Agent. \"Tell him he can't hev the Agency doctor, ef he ain't on the\nAgency books.\"\n\nNot have the doctor? Give up this precious medicine which might save his\nbaby's life? No! he could not do that. Majella would say, let the name\nbe written, rather than that.\n\n\"Let him write the name, then,\" said Alessandro, doggedly; but he went\nout of the room feeling as if he had put a chain around his neck.\n\n\n\n\nXXIII\n\nTHE medicine did the baby no good. In fact, it did her harm. She was too\nfeeble for violent remedies. In a week, Alessandro appeared again at the\nAgency doctor's door. This time he had come with a request which to\nhis mind seemed not unreasonable. He had brought Baba for the doctor to\nride. Could the doctor then refuse to go to Saboba? Baba would carry\nhim there in three hours, and it would be like a cradle all the way.\nAlessandro's name was in the Agency books. It was for this he had\nwritten it,--for this and nothing else,--to save the baby's life. Having\nthus enrolled himself as one of the Agency Indians, he had a claim on\nthis the Agency doctor. And that his application might be all in due\nform, he took with him the Agency interpreter. He had had a misgiving,\nbefore, that Aunt Ri's kindly volubility had not been well timed. Not\none unnecessary word, was Alessandro's motto.\n\nTo say that the Agency doctor was astonished at being requested to ride\nthirty miles to prescribe for an ailing Indian baby, would be a mild\nstatement of the doctor's emotion. He could hardly keep from laughing,\nwhen it was made clear to him that this was what the Indian father\nexpected.\n\n\"Good Lord!\" he said, turning to a crony who chanced to be lounging in\nthe office. \"Listen to that beggar, will you? I wonder what he thinks\nthe Government pays me a year for doctoring Indians!\"\n\nAlessandro listened so closely it attracted the doctor's attention. \"Do\nyou understand English?\" he asked sharply.\n\n\"A very little, Senor,\" replied Alessandro.\n\nThe doctor would be more careful in his speech, then. But he made it\nmost emphatically clear that the thing Alessandro had asked was not\nonly out of the question, but preposterous. Alessandro pleaded. For the\nchild's sake he could do it. The horse was at the door; there was no\nsuch horse in San Bernardino County; he went like the wind, and one\nwould not know he was in motion, it was so easy. Would not the doctor\ncome down and look at the horse? Then he would see what it would be like\nto ride him.\n\n\"Oh, I've seen plenty of your Indian ponies,\" said the doctor. \"I know\nthey can run.\"\n\nAlessandro lingered. He could not give up this last hope. The tears came\ninto his eyes. \"It is our only child, Senor,\" he said. \"It will take you\nbut six hours in all. My wife counts the moments till you come! If the\nchild dies, she will die.\"\n\n\"No! no!\" The doctor was weary of being importuned. \"Tell the man it\nis impossible! I'd soon have my hands full, if I began to go about the\ncountry this way. They'd be sending for me down to Agua Caliente next,\nand bringing up their ponies to carry me.\"\n\n\"He will not go?\" asked Alessandro.\n\nThe interpreter shook his head. \"He cannot,\" he said.\n\nWithout a word Alessandro left the room. Presently he returned. \"Ask him\nif he will come for money?\" he said. \"I have gold at home. I will pay\nhim, what the white men pay him.\"\n\n\"Tell him no man of any color could pay me for going sixty miles!\" said\nthe doctor.\n\nAnd Alessandro departed again, walking so slowly, however, that he heard\nthe coarse laugh, and the words, \"Gold! Looked like it, didn't he?\"\nwhich followed his departure from the room.\n\nWhen Ramona saw him returning alone, she wrung her hands. Her heart\nseemed breaking. The baby had lain in a sort of stupor since noon;\nshe was plainly worse, and Ramona had been going from the door to the\ncradle, from the cradle to the door, for an hour, looking each moment\nfor the hoped-for aid. It had not once crossed her mind that the doctor\nwould not come. She had accepted in much fuller faith than Alessandro\nthe account of the appointment by the Government of these two men to\nlook after the Indians' interests. What else could their coming mean,\nexcept that, at last, the Indians were to have justice? She thought,\nin her simplicity, that the doctor must have died, since Alessandro was\nriding home alone.\n\n\"He would not come!\" said Alessandro, as he threw himself off his horse,\nwearily.\n\n\"Would not!\" cried Ramona. \"Would not! Did you not say the Government\nhad sent him to be the doctor for Indians?\"\n\n\"That was what they said,\" he replied. \"You see it is a lie, like the\nrest! But I offered him gold, and he would not come then. The child must\ndie, Majella!\"\n\n\"She shall not die!\" cried Ramona. \"We will carry her to him!\" The\nthought struck them both as an inspiration. Why had they not thought of\nit before? \"You can fasten the cradle on Baba's back, and he will go so\ngently, she will think it is but play; and I will walk by her side, or\nyou, all the way!\" she continued. \"And we can sleep at Aunt Ri's house.\nOh, why, why did we not do it before? Early in the morning we will\nstart.\"\n\nAll through the night they sat watching the little creature. If they had\never seen death, they would have known that there was no hope for the\nchild. But how should Ramona and Alessandro know?\n\nThe sun rose bright and warm. Before it was up, the cradle was ready,\ningeniously strapped on Baba's back. When the baby was placed in it, she\nsmiled. \"The first smile she has given for days,\" cried Ramona. \"Oh, the\nair itself will do good to her! Let me walk by her first! Come, Baba!\nDear Baba!\" and Ramona stepped almost joyfully by the horse's side,\nAlessandro riding Benito. As they paced along, their eyes never leaving\nthe baby's face, Ramona said, in a low tone, \"Alessandro, I am almost\nafraid to tell you what I have done. I took the little Jesus out of the\nMadonna's arms and hid it! Did you never hear, that if you do that, the\nMadonna will grant you anything, to get him back again in her arms' Did\nyou ever hear of it?\"\n\n\"Never!\" exclaimed Alessandro, with horror in his tone. \"Never, Majella!\nHow dared you?\"\n\n\"I dare anything now!\" said Ramona. \"I have been thinking to do it for\nsome days, and to tell her she could not have him any more till she gave\nme back the baby well and strong; but I knew I could not have courage to\nsit and look at her all lonely without him in her arms, so I did not do\nit. But now we are to be away, I thought, that is the time; and I told\nher, 'When we come back with our baby well, you shall have your little\nJesus again, too; now, Holy Mother, you go with us, and make the doctor\ncure our baby!' Oh, I have heard, many times, women tell the Senora they\nhad done this, and always they got what they wanted. Never will she let\nthe Jesus be out of her arms more than three weeks before she will\ngrant any prayer one can make. It was that way she brought you to me,\nAlessandro. I never before told you. I was afraid. I think she had\nbrought you sooner, but I could keep the little Jesus hid from her only\nat night. In the day I could not, because the Senora would see. So she\ndid not miss him so much; else she had brought you quicker.\"\n\n\"But, Majella,\" said the logical Alessandro, \"it was because I could not\nleave my father that I did not come. As soon as he was buried, I came.\"\n\n\"If it had not been for the Virgin, you would never have come at all,\"\nsaid Ramona, confidently.\n\nFor the first hour of this sad journey it seemed as if the child were\nreally rallying; the air, the sunlight, the novel motion, the smiling\nmother by her side, the big black horses she had already learned to\nlove, all roused her to an animation she had not shown for days. But\nit was only the last flicker of the expiring flame. The eyes drooped,\nclosed; a strange pallor came over the face. Alessandro saw it first.\nHe was now walking, Ramona riding Benito. \"Majella!\" he cried, in a tone\nwhich told her all.\n\nIn a second she was at the baby's side, with a cry which smote the\ndying child's consciousness. Once more the eyelids lifted; she knew her\nmother; a swift spasm shook the little frame; a convulsion as of\nagony swept over the face, then it was at peace. Ramona's shrieks were\nheart-rending. Fiercely she put Alessandro away from her, as he strove\nto caress her. She stretched her arms up towards the sky. \"I have killed\nher! I have killed her!\" she cried. \"Oh, let me die!\"\n\nSlowly Alessandro turned Baba's head homeward again.\n\n\"Oh, give her to me! Let her lie on my breast! I will hold her warm!\"\ngasped Ramona.\n\nSilently Alessandro laid the body in her arms. He had not spoken since\nhis first cry of alarm, If Ramona had looked at him, she would have\nforgotten her grief for her dead child. Alessandro's face seemed turned\nto stone.\n\nWhen they reached the house, Ramona, laying the child on the bed, ran\nhastily to a corner of the room, and lifting the deerskin, drew from its\nhiding-place the little wooden Jesus. With tears streaming, she laid it\nagain in the Madonna's arms, and flinging herself on her knees, sobbed\nout prayers for forgiveness. Alessandro stood at the foot of the bed,\nhis arms folded, his eyes riveted on the child. Soon he went out, still\nwithout speaking. Presently Ramona heard the sound of a saw. She groaned\naloud, and her tears flowed faster: Alessandro was making the baby's\ncoffin. Mechanically she rose, and, moving like one half paralyzed,\nshe dressed the little one in fresh white clothes for the burial; then\nlaying her in the cradle, she spread over it the beautiful lace-wrought\naltar-cloth. As she adjusted its folds, her mind was carried back to the\ntime when she embroidered it, sitting on the Senora's veranda; the song\nof the finches, the linnets; the voice and smile of Felipe; Alessandro\nsitting on the steps, drawing divine music from his violin. Was that\nshe,--that girl who sat there weaving the fine threads in the beautiful\naltar-cloth? Was it a hundred years ago? Was it another world? Was it\nAlessandro yonder, driving those nails into a coffin? How the blows\nrang, louder and louder! The air seemed deafening full of sound. With\nher hands pressed to her temples, Ramona sank to the floor. A merciful\nunconsciousness set her free, for an interval, from her anguish.\n\nWhen she opened her eyes, she was lying on the bed. Alessandro had\nlifted her and laid her there, making no effort to rouse her. He thought\nshe would die too; and even that thought did not stir him from his\nlethargy. When she opened her eyes, and looked at him, he did not speak.\nShe closed them. He did not move. Presently she opened them again. \"I\nheard you out there,\" she said.\n\n\"Yes,\" he replied. \"It is done.\" And he pointed to a little box of rough\nboards by the side of the cradle.\n\n\"Is Majella ready to go to the mountain now?\" he asked.\n\n\"Yes, Alessandro, I am ready,\" she said.\n\n\"We will hide forever,\" he said.\n\n\"It makes no difference,\" she replied.\n\nThe Saboba women did not know what to think of Ramona now. She had never\ncome into sympathetic relations with them, as she had with the women of\nSan Pasquale. Her intimacy with the Hyers had been a barrier the Saboba\npeople could not surmount. No one could be on such terms with whites,\nand be at heart an Indian, they thought; so they held aloof from Ramona.\nBut now in her bereavement they gathered round her. They wept at sight\nof the dead baby's face, lying in its tiny white coffin. Ramona had\ncovered the box with white cloth, and the lace altar-cloth thrown over\nit fell in folds to the floor. \"Why does not this mother weep? Is she\nlike the whites, who have no heart?\" said the Saboba mothers among\nthemselves; and they were embarrassed before her, and knew not what\nto say. Ramona perceived it, but had no life in her to speak to them.\nBenumbing terrors, which were worse than her grief, were crowding\nRamona's heart now. She had offended the Virgin; she had committed a\nblasphemy: in one short hour the Virgin had punished her, had smitten\nher child dead before her eyes. And now Alessandro was going mad; hour\nby hour Ramona fancied she saw changes in him. What form would the\nVirgin's vengeance take next? Would she let Alessandro become a raging\nmadman, and finally kill both himself and her? That seemed to Ramona\nthe most probable fate in store for them. When the funeral was over, and\nthey returned to their desolate home, at the sight of the empty cradle\nRamona broke down.\n\n\"Oh, take me away, Alessandro! Anywhere! I don't care where! anywhere,\nso it is not here!\" she cried.\n\n\"Would Majella be afraid, now, on the high mountain, the place I told\nher of?\" he said.\n\n\"No!\" she replied earnestly. \"No! I am afraid of nothing! Only take me\naway!\"\n\nA gleam of wild delight flitted across Alessandro's face. \"It is well,\"\nhe said. \"My Majella, we will go to the mountain; we will be safe\nthere.\"\n\nThe same fierce restlessness which took possession of him at San\nPasquale again showed itself in his every act. His mind was unceasingly\nat work, planning the details of their move and of the new life. He\nmentioned them one after another to Ramona. They could not take both\nhorses; feed would be scanty there, and there would be no need of two\nhorses. The cow also they must give up. Alessandro would kill her, and\nthe meat, dried, would last them for a long time. The wagon he hoped\nhe could sell; and he would buy a few sheep; sheep and goats could live\nwell in these heights to which they were going. Safe at last! Oh, yes,\nvery safe; not only against whites, who, because the little valley was\nso small and bare, would not desire it, but against Indians also. For\nthe Indians, silly things, had a terror of the upper heights of San\nJacinto; they believed the Devil lived there, and money would not hire\none of the Saboba Indians to go so high as this valley which Alessandro\nhad discovered. Fiercely he gloated over each one of these features\nof safety in their hiding-place. \"The first time I saw it, Majella,--I\nbelieve the saints led me there,--I said, it is a hiding-place. And\nthen I never thought I would be in want of such,--of a place to keep my\nMajella safe! safe! Oh, my Majel!\" And he clasped her to his breast with\na terrifying passion.\n\nFor an Indian to sell a horse and wagon in the San Jacinto valley was\nnot an easy thing, unless he would give them away. Alessandro had hard\nwork to give civil answers to the men who wished to buy Benito and the\nwagon for quarter of their value. He knew they would not have dared to\nso much as name such prices to a white man. Finally Ramona, who had felt\nunconquerable misgivings as to the wisdom of thus irrevocably parting\nfrom their most valuable possessions, persuaded him to take both horses\nand wagon to San Bernardino, and offer them to the Hyers to use for the\nwinter.\n\nIt would be just the work for Jos, to keep him in the open air, if\nhe could get teaming to do; she was sure he would be thankful for the\nchance. \"He is as fond of the horses as we are ourselves, Alessandro,\"\nshe said. \"They would be well cared for; and then, if we did not like\nliving on the mountain, we could have the horses and wagon again when we\ncame down, or Jos could sell them for us in San Bernardino. Nobody could\nsee Benito and Baba working together, and not want them.\"\n\n\"Majella is wiser than the dove!\" cried Alessandro. \"She has seen what\nis the best thing to do. I will take them.\"\n\nWhen he was ready to set off, he implored Ramona to go with him; but\nwith a look of horror she refused. \"Never,\" she cried, \"one step on that\naccursed road! I will never go on that road again unless it is to be\ncarried, as we brought her, dead.\"\n\nNeither did Ramona wish to see Aunt Ri. Her sympathy would be\nintolerable, spite of all its affectionate kindliness. \"Tell her I love\nher,\" she said, \"but I do not want to see a human being yet; next year\nperhaps we will go down,--if there is any other way besides that road.\"\n\nAunt Ri was deeply grieved. She could not understand Ramona's feeling.\nIt rankled deep. \"I allow I'd never hev bleeved it uv her, never,\" she\nsaid. \"I shan't never think she wuz quite right 'n her head, to do 't!\nI allow we shan't never set eyes on ter her, Jos. I've got jest thet\nfeelin' abaout it. 'Pears like she'd gone klar out 'er this yer world\ninter anuther.\"\n\nThe majestic bulwark of San Jacinto Mountain looms in the southern\nhorizon of the San Bernardino valley. It was in full sight from the door\nof the little shanty in which Aunt Ri's carpet-loom stood. As she sat\nthere hour after hour, sometimes seven hours to the day, working the\nheavy treadle, and slipping the shuttle back and forth, she gazed with\ntender yearnings at the solemn, shining summit. When sunset colors smote\nit, it glowed like fire; on cloudy days, it was lost in the clouds.\n\n\"'Pears like 'twas next door to heaven, up there, Jos,\" Aunt Ri would\nsay. \"I can't tell yer the feelin' 't comes over me, to look up 't it,\never sence I knowed she wuz there. 'T shines enuf to put yer eyes aout,\nsometimes; I allow 'tain't so light's thet when you air into 't; 't\ncan't be; ther couldn't nobody stan' it, ef 't wuz. I allow 't must be\nlike bein' dead, Jos, don't yer think so, to be livin' thar? He sed ther\ncouldn't nobody git to 'em. Nobody ever seed the place but hisself. He\nfound it a huntin'. Thar's water thar, 'n' thet's abaout all thar is,\nfur's I cud make aout; I allow we shan't never see her agin.\"\n\nThe horses and the wagon were indeed a godsend to Jos. It was the very\nthing he had been longing for; the only sort of work he was as yet\nstrong enough to do, and there was plenty of it to be had in San\nBernardino. But the purchase of a wagon suitable for the purpose was at\npresent out of their power; the utmost Aunt Ri had hoped to accomplish\nwas to have, at the end of a year, a sufficient sum laid up to buy one.\nThey had tried in vain to exchange their heavy emigrant-wagon for one\nsuitable for light work. \"'Pears like I'd die o' shame,\" said Aunt Ri,\n\"sometimes when I ketch myself er thinkin' what luck et's ben to Jos, er\ngettin' thet Injun's hosses an' waggin. But ef Jos keeps on, airnin' ez\nmuch ez he hez so fur, he's goin' ter pay the Injun part on 't, when he\ncums. I allow ter Jos 'tain't no more'n fair. Why, them hosses, they'll\ndew good tew days' work'n one. I never see sech hosses; 'n' they're jest\nlike kittens; they've ben drefful pets, I allow. I know she set all the\nworld, 'n' more tew, by thet nigh one. He wuz hern, ever sence she wuz a\nchild. Pore thing,--'pears like she hedn't hed no chance!\"\n\nAlessandro had put off, from day to day, the killing of the cow. It went\nhard with him to slaughter the faithful creature, who knew him, and came\ntowards him at the first sound of his voice. He had pastured her, since\nthe baby died, in a canon about three miles northeast of the village,--a\nlovely green canon with oak-trees and a running brook. It was here that\nhe had thought of building his house if they had stayed in Saboba. But\nAlessandro laughed bitterly to himself now, as he recalled that dream.\nAlready the news had come to Saboba that a company had been formed for\nthe settling up of the San Jacinto valley; the Ravallo brothers had sold\nto this company a large grant of land. The white ranchmen in the valley\nwere all fencing in their lands; no more free running of stock. The\nSaboba people were too poor to build miles of fencing; they must soon\ngive up keeping stock; and the next thing would be that they would be\ndriven out, like the people of Temecula. It was none too soon that he\nhad persuaded Majella to flee to the mountain. There, at least, they\ncould live and die in peace,--a poverty-stricken life, and the loneliest\nof deaths; but they would have each other. It was well the baby had\ndied; she was saved all this misery. By the time she had grown to be\na woman, if she had lived, there would be no place in all the country\nwhere an Indian could find refuge. Brooding over such thoughts as\nthese, Alessandro went up into the canon one morning. It must be done.\nEverything was ready for their move; it would take many days to carry\neven their few possessions up the steep mountain trail to their new\nhome; the pony which had replaced Benito and Baba could not carry a\nheavy load. While this was being done, Ramona would dry the beef which\nwould be their supply of meat for many months. Then they would go.\n\nAt noon he came down with the first load of the meat, and Ramona began\ncutting it into long strips, as is the Mexican fashion of drying.\nAlessandro returned for the remainder. Early in the afternoon, as Ramona\nwent to and fro about her work, she saw a group of horsemen riding from\nhouse to house, in the upper part of the village; women came running out\nexcitedly from each house as the horsemen left it; finally one of them\ndarted swiftly up the hill to Ramona. \"Hide it! hide it!\" she cried,\nbreathless; \"hide the meat! It is Merrill's men, from the end of the\nvalley. They have lost a steer, and they say we stole it. They found the\nplace, with blood on it, where it was killed; and they say we did it.\nOh, hide the meat! They took all that Fernando had; and it was his own,\nthat he bought; he did not know anything about their steer!\"\n\n\"I shall not hide it!\" cried Ramona, indignantly. \"It is our own cow.\nAlessandro killed it to-day.\"\n\n\"They won't believe you!\" said the woman, in distress. \"They'll take it\nall away. Oh, hide some of it!\" And she dragged a part of it across the\nfloor, and threw it under the bed, Ramona standing by, stupefied.\n\nBefore she had spoken again, the forms of the galloping riders darkened\nthe doorway; the foremost of them, leaping off his horse, exclaimed:\n\"By God! here's the rest of it. If they ain't the damnedest impudent\nthieves! Look at this woman, cutting it up! Put that down, will you?\nWe'll save you the trouble of dryin' our meat for us, besides killin'\nit! Fork over, now, every bit you've got, you--\" And he called Ramona by\na vile epithet.\n\nEvery drop of blood left Ramona's face. Her eyes blazed, and she came\nforward with the knife uplifted in her hand. \"Out of my house, you dogs\nof the white color!\" she said. \"This meat is our own; my husband killed\nthe creature but this morning.\"\n\nHer tone and bearing surprised them. There were six of the men, and they\nhad all swarmed into the little room.\n\n\"I say, Merrill,\" said one of them, \"hold on; the squaw says her husband\nonly jest killed it to-day. It might be theirs.\"\n\nRamona turned on him like lightning. \"Are you liars, you all,\" she\ncried, \"that you think I lie? I tell you the meat is ours; and there is\nnot an Indian in this village would steal cattle!\"\n\nA derisive shout of laughter from all the men greeted this speech; and\nat that second, the leader, seeing the mark of blood where the Indian\nwoman had dragged the meat across the ground, sprang to the bed, and\nlifting the deerskin, pointed with a sneer to the beef hidden there.\n\"Perhaps, when you know Injun's well's I do,\" he said, \"you won't be for\nbelievin' all they say! What's she got it hid under the bed for, if it\nwas their own cow?\" and he stooped to drag the meat out. \"Give us a hand\nhere, Jake!\"\n\n\"If you touch it, I will kill you!\" cried Ramona, beside herself with\nrage; and she sprang between the men, her uplifted knife gleaming.\n\n\"Hoity-toity!\" cried Jake, stepping back; \"that's a handsome squaw when\nshe's mad! Say, boys, let's leave her some of the meat. She wasn't to\nblame; of course, she believes what her husband told her.\"\n\n\"You go to grass for a soft-head, you Jake!\" muttered Merrill, as he\ndragged the meat out from beneath the bed.\n\n\"What is all this?\" said a deep voice in the door; and Ramona, turning,\nwith a glad cry, saw Alessandro standing there, looking on, with an\nexpression which, even in her own terror and indignation, gave her a\nsense of dread, it was so icily defiant. He had his hand on his gun.\n\"What is all this?\" he repeated. He knew very well.\n\n\"It's that Temecula man,\" said one of the men, in a low tone, to\nMerrill. \"If I'd known 't was his house, I wouldn't have let you come\nhere. You're up the wrong tree, sure!\"\n\nMerrill dropped the meat he was dragging over the floor, and turned to\nconfront Alessandro's eyes. His countenance fell. Even he saw that\nhe had made a mistake. He began to speak. Alessandro interrupted him.\nAlessandro could speak forcibly in Spanish. Pointing to his pony, which\nstood at the door with a package on its back, the remainder of the meat\nrolled in the hide, he said: \"There is the remainder of the beef.\nI killed the creature this morning, in the canon. I will take Senor\nMerrill to the place, if he wishes it. Senor Merrill's steer was killed\ndown in the willows yonder, yesterday.\"\n\n\"That's so!\" cried the men, gathering around him. \"How did you know? Who\ndid it?\"\n\nAlessandro made no reply. He was looking at Ramona. She had flung her\nshawl over her head, as the other woman had done, and the two were\ncowering in the corner, their faces turned away. Ramona dared not look\non; she felt sure Alessandro would kill some one. But this was not the\ntype of outrage that roused Alessandro to dangerous wrath. He even felt\na certain enjoyment in the discomfiture of the self-constituted posse\nof searchers for stolen goods. To all their questions in regard to the\nstolen steer, he maintained silence. He would not open his lips. At\nlast, angry, ashamed, with a volley of coarse oaths at him for his\nobstinacy, they rode away. Alessandro went to Ramona's side. She was\ntrembling. Her hands were like ice.\n\n\"Let us go to the mountain to-night!\" she gasped. \"Take me where I need\nnever see a white face again!\"\n\nA melancholy joy gleamed in Alessandro's eyes. Ramona, at last, felt as\nhe did.\n\n\"I would not dare to leave Majella there alone, while there is no\nhouse,\" he said; \"and I must go and come many times, before all the\nthings can be carried.\"\n\n\"It will be less danger there than here, Alessandro,\" said Ramona,\nbursting into violent weeping as she recalled the insolent leer with\nwhich the man Jake had looked at her. \"Oh! I cannot stay here!\"\n\n\"It will not be many days, my Majel. I will borrow Fernando's pony, to\ntake double at once; then we can go sooner.\"\n\n\"Who was it stole that man's steer?\" said Ramona. \"Why did you not tell\nthem? They looked as if they would kill you.\"\n\n\"It was that Mexican that lives in the bottom, Jose Castro. I myself\ncame on him, cutting the steer up. He said it was his; but I knew very\nwell, by the way he spoke, he was lying. But why should I tell? They\nthink only Indians will steal cattle. I can tell them, the Mexicans\nsteal more.\"\n\n\"I told them there was not an Indian in this village would steal\ncattle,\" said Ramona, indignantly.\n\n\"That was not true, Majella,\" replied Alessandro, sadly. \"When they\nare very hungry, they will steal a heifer or steer. They lose many\nthemselves, and they say it is not so much harm to take one when they\ncan get it. This man Merrill, they say, branded twenty steers for his\nown, last spring, when he knew they were Saboba cattle!\"\n\n\"Why did they not make him give them up?\" cried Ramona.\n\n\"Did not Majella see to-day why they can do nothing? There is no help\nfor us, Majella, only to hide; that is all we can do!\"\n\nA new terror had entered into Ramona's life; she dared not tell it to\nAlessandro; she hardly put it into words in her thoughts. But she was\nhaunted by the face of the man Jake, as by a vision of evil, and on one\npretext and another she contrived to secure the presence of some one of\nthe Indian women in her house whenever Alessandro was away. Every day\nshe saw the man riding past. Once he had galloped up to the open door,\nlooked in, spoken in a friendly way to her, and ridden on. Ramona's\ninstinct was right. Jake was merely biding his time. He had made up his\nmind to settle in the San Jacinto valley, at least for a few years, and\nhe wished to have an Indian woman come to live with him and keep his\nhouse. Over in Santa Ysabel, his brother had lived in that way with an\nIndian mistress for three years; and when he sold out, and left Santa\nYsabel, he had given the woman a hundred dollars and a little house for\nherself and her child. And she was not only satisfied, but held herself,\nin consequence of this temporary connection with a white man, much above\nher Indian relatives and friends. When an Indian man had wished to marry\nher, she had replied scornfully that she would never marry an Indian;\nshe might marry another white man, but an Indian,--never. Nobody had\nheld his brother in any less esteem for this connection; it was quite\nthe way in the country. And if Jake could induce this handsomest squaw\nhe had ever seen, to come and live with him in a smaller fashion, he\nwould consider himself a lucky man, and also think he was doing a good\nthing for the squaw. It was all very clear and simple in his mind;\nand when, seeing Ramona walking alone in the village one morning, he\novertook her, and walking by her side began to sound her on the\nsubject, he had small misgivings as to the result. Ramona trembled as he\napproached her. She walked faster, and would not look at him; but he, in\nhis ignorance, misinterpreted these signs egregiously.\n\n\"Are you married to your husband?\" he finally said. \"It is but a poor\nplace he gives you to live in. If you will come and live with me, you\nshall have the best house in the valley, as good as the Ravallos';\nand--\" Jake did not finish his sentence. With a cry which haunted\nhis memory for years, Ramona sprang from his side as if to run; then,\nhalting suddenly, she faced him, her eyes like javelins, her breath\ncoming fast. \"Beast!\" she said, and spat towards him; then turned and\nfled to the nearest house, where she sank on the floor and burst into\ntears, saying that the man below there in the road had been rude to her.\nYes, the women said, he was a bad man; they all knew it. Of this Ramona\nsaid no word to Alessandro. She dared not; she believed he would kill\nJake.\n\nWhen the furious Jake confided to his friend Merrill his repulse, and\nthe indignity accompanying it, Merrill only laughed at him, and said: \"I\ncould have told you better than to try that woman. She's married, fast\nenough. There's plenty you can get, though, if you want 'em. They're\nfirst-rate about a house, and jest's faithful's dogs. You can trust 'em\nwith every dollar you've got.\"\n\nFrom this day, Ramona never knew an instant's peace or rest till she\nstood on the rim of the refuge valley, high on San Jacinto. Then, gazing\naround, looking up at the lofty pinnacles above, which seemed to pierce\nthe sky, looking down upon the world,--it seemed the whole world,\nso limitless it stretched away at her feet,--feeling that infinite\nunspeakable sense of nearness to Heaven, remoteness from earth which\ncomes only on mountain heights, she drew in a long breath of delight,\nand cried: \"At last! at last, Alessandro! Here we are safe! This is\nfreedom! This is joy!\"\n\n\"Can Majella be content?\" he asked.\n\n\"I can almost be glad, Alessandro!\" she cried, inspired by the glorious\nscene. \"I dreamed not it was like this!\"\n\nIt was a wondrous valley. The mountain seemed to have been cleft to\nmake it. It lay near midway to the top, and ran transversely on the\nmountain's side, its western or southwestern end being many feet lower\nthan the eastern. Both the upper and lower ends were closed by piles of\nrocks and tangled fallen trees; the rocky summit of the mountain itself\nmade the southern wall; the northern was a spur, or ridge, nearly\nvertical, and covered thick with pine-trees. A man might roam years\non the mountain and not find this cleft. At the upper end gushed out\na crystal spring, which trickled rather than ran, in a bed of marshy\ngreen, the entire length of the valley, disappeared in the rocks at the\nlower end, and came out no more; many times Alessandro had searched for\nit lower down, but could find no trace of it. During the summer, when\nhe was hunting with Jeff, he had several times climbed the wall and\ndescended it on the inner side, to see if the rivulet still ran; and, to\nhis joy, had found it the same in July as in January. Drought could not\nharm it, then. What salvation in such a spring! And the water was pure\nand sweet as if it came from the skies.\n\nA short distance off was another ridge or spur of the mountain, widening\nout into almost a plateau. This was covered with acorn-bearing oaks; and\nunder them were flat stones worn into hollows, where bygone generations\nof Indians had ground the nuts into meal. Generations long bygone\nindeed, for it was not in the memory of the oldest now living, that\nIndians had ventured so high up as this on San Jacinto. It was held to\nbe certain death to climb to its summit, and foolhardy in the extreme to\ngo far up its sides.\n\nThere was exhilaration in the place. It brought healing to both\nAlessandro and Ramona. Even the bitter grief for the baby's death was\nsoothed. She did not seem so far off, since they had come so much nearer\nto the sky. They lived at first in a tent; no time to build a house,\ntill the wheat and vegetables were planted. Alessandro was surprised,\nwhen he came to the ploughing, to see how much good land he had. The\nvalley thrust itself, in inlets and coves, into the very rocks of its\nsouthern wall; lovely sheltered nooks these were, where he hated to\nwound the soft, flower-filled sward with his plough. As soon as the\nplanting was done, he began to fell trees for the house. No mournful\ngray adobe this time, but walls of hewn pine, with half the bark left\non; alternate yellow and brown, as gay as if glad hearts had devised it.\nThe roof, of thatch, tule, and yucca-stalks, double laid and thick,\nwas carried out several feet in front of the house, making a sort of\nbower-like veranda, supported by young fir-tree stems, left rough. Once\nmore Ramona would sit under a thatch with birds'-nests in it. A little\ncorral for the sheep, and a rough shed for the pony, and the home was\ncomplete: far the prettiest home they had ever had. And here, in the\nsunny veranda, when autumn came, sat Ramona, plaiting out of fragrant\nwillow twigs a cradle. The one over which she had wept such bitter tears\nin the valley, they had burned the night before they left their Saboba\nhome. It was in early autumn she sat plaiting this cradle. The ground\naround was strewn with wild grapes drying; the bees were feasting on\nthem in such clouds that Ramona rose frequently from her work to drive\nthem away, saying, as she did so, \"Good bees, make our honey from\nsomething else; we gain nothing if you drain our grapes for it; we want\nthese grapes for the winter;\" and as she spoke, her imagination sped\nfleetly forward to the winter, The Virgin must have forgiven her, to\ngive her again the joy of a child in her arms. Ay, a joy! Spite of\npoverty, spite of danger, spite of all that cruelty and oppression could\ndo, it would still be a joy to hold her child in her arms.\n\nThe baby was born before winter came. An old Indian woman, the same\nwhose house they had hired in Saboba, had come up to live with Ramona.\nShe was friendless now, her daughter having died, and she thankfully\ncame to be as a mother to Ramona. She was ignorant and feeble but Ramona\nsaw in her always the picture of what her own mother might perchance\nbe, wandering, suffering, she knew not what or where; and her yearning,\nfilial instinct found sad pleasure in caring for this lonely, childless,\naged one.\n\nRamona was alone with her on the mountain at the time of the baby's\nbirth. Alessandro had gone to the valley, to be gone two days; but\nRamona felt no fear. When Alessandro returned, and she laid the child in\nhis arms, she said with a smile, radiant once more, like the old smiles,\n\"See, beloved! The Virgin has forgiven me; she has given us a daughter\nagain!\"\n\nBut Alessandro did not smile. Looking scrutinizingly into the baby's\nface, he sighed, and said, \"Alas, Majella, her eyes are like mine, not\nyours!\"\n\n\"I am glad of it,\" cried Ramona. \"I was glad the first minute I saw it.\"\n\nHe shook his head. \"It is an ill fate to have the eyes of Alessandro,\"\nhe said. \"They look ever on woe;\" and he laid the baby back on Ramona's\nbreast, and stood gazing sadly at her.\n\n\"Dear Alessandro,\" said Ramona, \"it is a sin to always mourn. Father\nSalvierderra said if we repined under our crosses, then a heavier cross\nwould be laid on us. Worse things would come.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" he said. \"That is true. Worse things will come.\" And he walked\naway, with his head sunk deep on his breast.\n\n\n\n\nXXIV\n\nTHERE was no real healing for Alessandro. His hurts had gone too deep.\nHis passionate heart, ever secretly brooding on the wrongs he had borne,\nthe hopeless outlook for his people in the future, and most of all on\nthe probable destitution and suffering in store for Ramona, consumed\nitself as by hidden fires. Speech, complaint, active antagonism, might\nhave saved him; but all these were foreign to his self-contained,\nreticent, repressed nature. Slowly, so slowly that Ramona could not tell\non what hour or what day her terrible fears first changed to an even\nmore terrible certainty, his brain gave way, and the thing, in dread\nof which he had cried out the morning they left San Pasquale, came upon\nhim. Strangely enough, and mercifully, now that it had really come,\nhe did not know it. He knew that he suddenly came to his consciousness\nsometimes, and discovered himself in strange and unexplained situations;\nhad no recollection of what had happened for an interval of time, longer\nor shorter. But he thought it was only a sort of sickness; he did not\nknow that during those intervals his acts were the acts of a madman;\nnever violent, aggressive, or harmful to any one; never destructive.\nIt was piteous to see how in these intervals his delusions were always\nshaped by the bitterest experiences of his life. Sometimes he fancied\nthat the Americans were pursuing him, or that they were carrying off\nRamona, and he was pursuing them. At such times he would run with maniac\nswiftness for hours, till he fell exhausted on the ground, and slowly\nregained true consciousness by exhaustion. At other times he believed\nhe owned vast flocks and herds; would enter any enclosure he saw, where\nthere were sheep or cattle, go about among them, speaking of them to\npassers-by as his own. Sometimes he would try to drive them away; but on\nbeing remonstrated with, would bewilderedly give up the attempt. Once he\nsuddenly found himself in the road driving a small flock of goats, whose\nhe knew not, nor whence he got them. Sitting down by the roadside, he\nburied his head in his hands. \"What has happened to my memory?\" he said.\n\"I must be ill of a fever!\" As he sat there, the goats, of their own\naccord, turned and trotted back into a corral near by, the owner of\nwhich stood, laughing, on his doorsill; and when Alessandro came up,\nsaid goodnaturedly, \"All right, Alessandro! I saw you driving off my\ngoats, but I thought you'd bring 'em back.\"\n\nEverybody in the valley knew him, and knew his condition. It did not\ninterfere with his capacity as a worker, for the greater part of\nthe time. He was one of the best shearers in the region, the best\nhorse-breaker; and his services were always in demand, spite of the risk\nthere was of his having at any time one of these attacks of wandering.\nHis absences were a great grief to Ramona, not only from the loneliness\nin which it left her, but from the anxiety she felt lest his mental\ndisorder might at any time take a more violent and dangerous shape. This\nanxiety was all the more harrowing because she must keep it locked in\nher own breast, her wise and loving instinct telling her that nothing\ncould be more fatal to him than the knowledge of his real condition.\nMore than once he reached home, breathless, panting, the sweat rolling\noff his face, crying aloud, \"The Americans have found us out, Majella!\nThey were on the trail! I baffled them. I came up another way.\" At such\ntimes she would soothe him like a child; persuade him to lie down and\nrest; and when he waked and wondered why he was so tired, she would say,\n\"You were all out of breath when you came in, dear. You must not climb\nso fast; it is foolish to tire one's self so.\"\n\nIn these days Ramona began to think earnestly of Felipe. She believed\nAlessandro might be cured. A wise doctor could surely do something for\nhim. If Felipe knew what sore straits she was in, Felipe would help her.\nBut how could she reach Felipe without the Senora's knowing it? And,\nstill more, how could she send a letter to Felipe without Alessandro's\nknowing what she had written? Ramona was as helpless in her freedom on\nthis mountain eyrie as if she had been chained hand and foot.\n\nAnd so the winter wore away, and the spring. What wheat grew in their\nfields in this upper air! Wild oats, too, in every nook and corner.\nThe goats frisked and fattened, and their hair grew long and silky; the\nsheep were already heavy again with wool, and it was not yet midsummer.\nThe spring rains had been good; the stream was full, and flowers grew\nalong its edges thick as in beds.\n\nThe baby had thrived; as placid, laughing a little thing as if its\nmother had never known sorrow. \"One would think she had suckled pain,\"\nthought Ramona, \"so constantly have I grieved this year; but the Virgin\nhas kept her well.\"\n\nIf prayers could compass it, that would surely have been so; for night\nand day the devout, trusting, and contrite Ramona had knelt before the\nMadonna and told her golden beads, till they were wellnigh worn smooth\nof all their delicate chasing.\n\nAt midsummer was to be a fete in the Saboba village, and the San\nBernardino priest would come there. This would be the time to take the\nbaby down to be christened; this also would be the time to send the\nletter to Felipe, enclosed in one to Aunt Ri, who would send it for her\nfrom San Bernardino. Ramona felt half guilty as she sat plotting what\nshe should say and how she should send it,--she, who had never had in\nher loyal, transparent breast one thought secret from Alessandro since\nthey were wedded. But it was all for his sake. When he was well, he\nwould thank her.\n\nShe wrote the letter with much study and deliberation; her dread of its\nbeing read by the Senora was so great, that it almost paralyzed her pen\nas she wrote. More than once she destroyed pages, as being too sacred a\nconfidence for unloving eyes to read. At last, the day before the fete,\nit was done, and safely hidden away. The baby's white robe, finely\nwrought in open-work, was also done, and freshly washed and ironed.\nNo baby would there be at the fete so daintily wrapped as hers; and\nAlessandro had at last given his consent that the name should be\nMajella. It was a reluctant consent, yielded finally only to please\nRamona; and, contrary to her wont, she had been willing in this instance\nto have her own wish fulfilled rather than his. Her heart was set upon\nhaving the seal of baptism added to the name she so loved; and, \"If I\nwere to die,\" she thought, \"how glad Alessandro would be, to have still\na Majella!\"\n\nAll her preparations were completed, and it was yet not noon. She seated\nherself on the veranda to watch for Alessandro, who had been two days\naway, and was to have returned the previous evening, to make ready for\nthe trip to Saboba. She was disquieted at his failure to return at the\nappointed time. As the hours crept on and he did not come, her anxiety\nincreased. The sun had gone more than an hour past the midheavens before\nhe came. He had ridden fast; she had heard the quick strokes of the\nhorse's hoofs on the ground before she saw him. \"Why comes he riding\nlike that?\" she thought, and ran to meet him. As he drew near, she saw\nto her surprise that he was riding a new horse. \"Why, Alessandro!\" she\ncried. \"What horse is this?\"\n\nHe looked at her bewilderedly, then at the horse. True; it was not his\nown horse! He struck his hand on his forehead, endeavoring to collect\nhis thoughts. \"Where is my horse, then?\" he said.\n\n\"My God! Alessandro,\" cried Ramona. \"Take the horse back instantly. They\nwill say you stole it.\"\n\n\"But I left my pony there in the corral,\" he said. \"They will know I\ndid not mean to steal it. How could I ever have made the mistake? I\nrecollect nothing, Majella. I must have had one of the sicknesses.\"\n\nRamona's heart was cold with fear. Only too well she knew what summary\npunishment was dealt in that region to horse-thieves. \"Oh, let me take\nit back, dear!\" she cried, \"Let me go down with it. They will believe\nme.\"\n\n\"Majella!\" he exclaimed, \"think you I would send you into the fold of\nthe wolf? My wood-dove! It is in Jim Farrar's corral I left my pony. I\nwas there last night, to see about his sheep-shearing in the autumn. And\nthat is the last I know. I will ride back as soon as I have rested. I am\nheavy with sleep.\"\n\nThinking it safer to let him sleep for an hour, as his brain was\nevidently still confused, Ramona assented to this, though a sense of\ndanger oppressed her. Getting fresh hay from the corral, she with her\nown hands rubbed the horse down. It was a fine, powerful black horse;\nAlessandro had evidently urged him cruelly up the steep trail, for\nhis sides were steaming, his nostrils white with foam. Tears stood\nin Ramona's eyes as she did what she could for him. He recognized her\ngood-will, and put his nose to her face. \"It must be because he was\nblack like Benito, that Alessandro took him,\" she thought. \"Oh, Mary\nMother, help us to get the creature safe back!\" she said.\n\nWhen she went into the house, Alessandro was asleep. Ramona glanced\nat the sun. It was already in the western sky. By no possibility could\nAlessandro go to Farrar's and back before dark. She was on the point\nof waking him, when a furious barking from Capitan and the other dogs\nroused him instantly from his sleep, and springing to his feet, he ran\nout to see what it meant. In a moment more Ramona followed,--only a\nmoment, hardly a moment; but when she reached the threshold, it was to\nhear a gun-shot, to see Alessandro fall to the ground, to see, in the\nsame second, a ruffianly man leap from his horse, and standing over\nAlessandro's body, fire his pistol again, once, twice, into the\nforehead, cheek. Then with a volley of oaths, each word of which seemed\nto Ramona's reeling senses to fill the air with a sound like thunder, he\nuntied the black horse from the post where Ramona had fastened him, and\nleaping into his saddle again, galloped away, leading the horse. As he\nrode away, he shook his fist at Ramona, who was kneeling on the ground,\nstriving to lift Alessandro's head, and to stanch the blood flowing\nfrom the ghastly wounds. \"That'll teach you damned Indians to leave\noff stealing our horses!\" he cried, and with another volley of terrible\noaths was out of sight.\n\nWith a calmness which was more dreadful than any wild outcry of grief,\nRamona sat on the ground by Alessandro's body, and held his hands in\nhers. There was nothing to be done for him. The first shot had been\nfatal, close to his heart,--the murderer aimed well; the after-shots,\nwith the pistol, were from mere wanton brutality. After a few seconds\nRamona rose, went into the house, brought out the white altar-cloth, and\nlaid it over the mutilated face. As she did this, she recalled words\nshe had heard Father Salvierderra quote as having been said by Father\nJunipero, when one of the Franciscan Fathers had been massacred by the\nIndians, at San Diego. \"Thank God.\" he said, \"the ground is now watered\nby the blood of a martyr!\"\n\n\"The blood of a martyr!\" The words seemed to float in the air; to\ncleanse it from the foul blasphemies the murderer had spoken. \"My\nAlessandro!\" she said. \"Gone to be with the saints; one of the blessed\nmartyrs; they will listen to what a martyr says.\" His hands were warm.\nShe laid them in her bosom, kissed them again and again. Stretching\nherself on the ground by his side, she threw one arm over him, and\nwhispered in his ear, \"My love, my Alessandro! Oh, speak once to\nMajella! Why do I not grieve more? My Alessandro! Is he not blest\nalready? And soon we will be with him! The burdens were too great. He\ncould not bear them!\" Then waves of grief broke over her, and she sobbed\nconvulsively; but still she shed no tears. Suddenly she sprang to her\nfeet, and looked wildly around. The sun was not many hours high. Whither\nshould she go for help? The old Indian woman had gone away with the\nsheep, and would not be back till dark. Alessandro must not lie there\non the ground. To whom should she go? To walk to Saboba was out of the\nquestion. There was another Indian village nearer,--the village of the\nCahuillas, on one of the high plateaus of San Jacinto. She had once been\nthere. Could she find that trail now? She must try. There was no human\nhelp nearer.\n\nTaking the baby in her arms, she knelt by Alessandro, and kissing him,\nwhispered, \"Farewell, my beloved. I will not be long gone. I go to bring\nfriends.\" As she set off, swiftly running, Capitan, who had been lying\nby Alessandro's side, uttering heart-rending howls, bounded to his feet\nto follow her. \"No, Capitan,\" she said; and leading him back to the\nbody, she took his head in her hands, looked into his eyes, and said,\n\"Capitan, watch here.\" With a whimpering cry, he licked her hands, and\nstretched himself on the ground. He understood, and would obey; but his\neyes followed her wistfully till she disappeared from sight.\n\nThe trail was rough, and hard to find. More than once Ramona stopped,\nbaffled, among the rocky ridges and precipices. Her clothes were torn,\nher face bleeding, from the thorny shrubs; her feet seemed leaden, she\nmade her way so slowly. It was dark in the ravines; as she climbed spur\nafter spur, and still saw nothing but pine forests or bleak opens, her\nheart sank within her. The way had not seemed so long before. Alessandro\nhad been with her; it was a joyous, bright day, and they had lingered\nwherever they liked, and yet the way had seemed short. Fear seized her\nthat she was lost. If that were so, before morning she would be with\nAlessandro; for fierce beasts roamed San Jacinto by night. But for the\nbaby's sake, she must not die. Feverishly she pressed on. At last, just\nas it had grown so dark she could see only a few hand-breadths before\nher, and was panting more from terror than from running, lights suddenly\ngleamed out, only a few rods ahead. It was the Cahuilla village. In a\nfew moments she was there.\n\nIt is a poverty-stricken little place, the Cahuilla village,--a cluster\nof tule and adobe huts, on a narrow bit of bleak and broken ground,\non San Jacinto Mountain; the people are very poor, but are proud\nand high-spirited,--veritable mountaineers in nature, fierce and\nindependent.\n\nAlessandro had warm friends among them, and the news that he had been\nmurdered, and that his wife had run all the way down the mountain, with\nher baby in her arms, for help, went like wild-fire through the place.\nThe people gathered in an excited group around the house where Ramona\nhad taken refuge. She was lying, half unconscious, on a bed. As soon\nas she had gasped out her terrible story, she had fallen forward on the\nfloor, fainting, and the baby had been snatched from her arms just in\ntime to save it. She did not seem to miss the child; had not asked for\nit, or noticed it when it was brought to the bed. A merciful oblivion\nseemed to be fast stealing over her senses. But she had spoken words\nenough to set the village in a blaze of excitement. It ran higher and\nhigher. Men were everywhere mounting their horses,--some to go up and\nbring Alessandro's body down; some organizing a party to go at once to\nJim Farrar's house and shoot him: these were the younger men, friends of\nAlessandro. Earnestly the aged Capitan of the village implored them to\nrefrain from such violence.\n\n\"Why should ten be dead instead of one, my sons?\" he said. \"Will you\nleave your wives and your children like his? The whites will kill us all\nif you lay hands on the man. Perhaps they themselves will punish him.\"\n\nA derisive laugh rose from the group. Never yet within their experience\nhad a white man been punished for shooting an Indian. The Capitan knew\nthat as well as they did. Why did he command them to sit still like\nwomen, and do nothing, when a friend was murdered?\n\n\"Because I am old, and you are young. I have seen that we fight in\nvain,\" said the wise old man. \"It is not sweet to me, any more than to\nyou. It is a fire in my veins; but I am old. I have seen. I forbid you\nto go.\"\n\nThe women added their entreaties to his, and the young men abandoned\ntheir project. But it was with sullen reluctance; and mutterings were\nto be heard, on all sides, that the time would come yet. There was more\nthan one way of killing a man. Farrar would not be long seen in the\nvalley. Alessandro should be avenged.\n\nAs Farrar rode slowly down the mountain, leading his recovered horse, he\nrevolved in his thoughts what course to pursue. A few years before, he\nwould have gone home, no more disquieted at having killed an Indian than\nif he had killed a fox or a wolf. But things were different now. This\nAgent, that the Government had taken it into its head to send out to\nlook after the Indians, had made it hot, the other day, for some fellows\nin San Bernardino who had maltreated an Indian; he had even gone so\nfar as to arrest several liquor-dealers for simply selling whiskey to\nIndians. If he were to take this case of Alessandro's in hand, it might\nbe troublesome. Farrar concluded that his wisest course would be to make\na show of good conscience and fair-dealing by delivering himself up\nat once to the nearest justice of the peace, as having killed a man\nin self-defence, Accordingly he rode straight to the house of a Judge\nWells, a few miles below Saboba, and said that he wished to surrender\nhimself as having committed \"justifiable homicide\" on an Indian, or\nMexican, he did net know which, who had stolen his horse. He told a\nplausible story. He professed not to know the man, or the place; but did\nnot explain how it was, that, knowing neither, he had gone so direct to\nthe spot.\n\nHe said: \"I followed the trail for some time, but when I reached a turn,\nI came into a sort of blind trail, where I lost the track. I think the\nhorse had been led up on hard sod, to mislead any one on the track. I\npushed on, crossed the creek, and soon found the tracks again in soft\nground. This part of the mountain was perfectly unknown to me, and very\nwild. Finally I came to a ridge, from which I looked down on a little\nranch. As I came near the house, the dogs began to bark, just as I\ndiscovered my horse tied to a tree. Hearing the dogs, an Indian, or\nMexican, I could not tell which, came out of the house, flourishing a\nlarge knife. I called out to him, 'Whose horse is that?' He answered\nin Spanish, 'It is mine.' 'Where did you get it?' I asked. 'In San\nJacinto,' was his reply. As he still came towards me, brandishing the\nknife, I drew my gun, and said, 'Stop, or I'll shoot!' He did not stop,\nand I fired; still he did not stop, so I fired again; and as he did not\nfall, I knocked him down with the butt of my gun. After he was down, I\nshot him twice with my pistol.\"\n\nThe duty of a justice in such a case as this was clear. Taking the\nprisoner into custody, he sent out messengers to summon a jury of six\nmen to hold inquest on the body of said Indian, or Mexican; and early\nthe next morning, led by Farrar, they set out for the mountain. When\nthey reached the ranch, the body had been removed; the house was\nlocked; no signs left of the tragedy of the day before, except a few\nblood-stains on the ground, where Alessandro had fallen. Farrar seemed\ngreatly relieved at this unexpected phase of affairs. However, when he\nfound that Judge Wells, instead of attempting to return to the valley\nthat night, proposed to pass the night at a ranch only a few miles\nfrom the Cahuilla village, he became almost hysterical with fright.\nHe declared that the Cahuillas would surely come and murder him in the\nnight, and begged piteously that the men would all stay with him to\nguard him.\n\nAt midnight Judge Wells was roused by the arrival of the Capitan and\nhead men of the Cahuilla village. They had heard of his arrival with his\njury, and they had come to lead them to their village, where the body of\nthe murdered man lay. They were greatly distressed on learning that they\nought not to have removed the body from the spot where the death had\ntaken place, and that now no inquest could be held.\n\nJudge Wells himself, however, went back with them, saw the body, and\nheard the full account of the murder as given by Ramona on her first\narrival. Nothing more could now be learned from her, as she was in high\nfever and delirium; knew no one, not even her baby when they laid it\non her breast. She lay restlessly tossing from side to side, talking\nincessantly, clasping her rosary in her hands, and constantly mingling\nsnatches of prayers with cries for Alessandro and Felipe; the only token\nof consciousness she gave was to clutch the rosary wildly, and sometimes\nhide it in her bosom, if they attempted to take it from her.\n\nJudge Wells was a frontiersman, and by no means sentimentally inclined;\nbut the tears stood in his eyes as he looked at the unconscious Ramona.\n\nFarrar had pleaded that the preliminary hearing might take place\nimmediately; but after this visit to the village, the judge refused his\nrequest, and appointed the trial a week from that day, to give time\nfor Ramona to recover, and appear as a witness. He impressed upon the\nIndians as strongly as he could the importance of having her appear. It\nwas evident that Farrar's account of the affair was false from first to\nlast. Alessandro had no knife. He had not had time to go many steps from\nthe door; the volley of oaths, and the two shots almost simultaneously,\nwere what Ramona heard as she ran to the door. Alessandro could not have\nspoken many words.\n\nThe day for the hearing came. Farrar had been, during the interval, in a\nmerely nominal custody; having been allowed to go about his business,\non his own personal guarantee of appearing in time for the trial. It\nwas with a strange mixture of regret and relief that Judge Wells saw the\nhour of the trial arrive, and not a witness on the ground except Farrar\nhimself. That Farrar was a brutal ruffian, the whole country knew. This\nlast outrage was only one of a long series; the judge would have been\nglad to have committed him for trial, and have seen him get his deserts.\nBut San Jacinto Valley, wild, sparsely settled as it was, had yet as\nfixed standards and criterions of popularity as the most civilized of\ncommunities could show; and to betray sympathy with Indians was more\nthan any man's political head was worth. The word \"justice\" had lost its\nmeaning, if indeed it ever had any, so far as they were concerned. The\nvalley was a unit on that question, however divided it might be upon\nothers. On the whole, the judge was relieved, though it was not without\na bitter twinge, as of one accessory after the deed, and unfaithful to\na friend; for he had known Alessandro well. Yet, on the whole, he was\nrelieved when he was forced to accede to the motion made by Farrar's\ncounsel, that \"the prisoner be discharged on ground of justifiable\nhomicide, no witnesses having appeared against him.\"\n\nHe comforted himself by thinking--what was no doubt true--that even if\nthe case had been brought to a jury trial, the result would have been\nthe same; for there would never have been found a San Diego County jury\nthat would convict a white man of murder for killing an Indian, if\nthere were no witnesses to the occurrence except the Indian wife. But he\nderived small comfort from this. Alessandro's face haunted him, and also\nthe memory of Ramona's, as she lay tossing and moaning in the wretched\nCahuilla hovel. He knew that only her continued illness, or her death,\ncould explain her not having come to the trial. The Indians would have\nbrought her in their arms all the way, if she had been alive and in\npossession of her senses.\n\nDuring the summer that she and Alessandro had lived in Saboba he had\nseen her many times, and had been impressed by her rare quality. His\nchildren knew her and loved her; had often been in her house; his wife\nhad bought her embroidery. Alessandro also had worked for him; and no\none knew better than Judge Wells that Alessandro in his senses was as\nincapable of stealing a horse as any white man in the valley. Farrar\nknew it; everybody knew it. Everybody knew, also, about his strange fits\nof wandering mind; and that when these half-crazed fits came on him,\nhe was wholly irresponsible. Farrar knew this. The only explanation of\nFarrar's deed was, that on seeing his horse spent and exhausted from\nhaving been forced up that terrible trail, he was seized by ungovernable\nrage, and fired on the second, without knowing what he did. \"But he\nwouldn't have done it, if it hadn't been an Indian!\" mused the judge.\n\"He'd ha' thought twice before he shot any white man down, that way.\"\n\nDay after day such thoughts as these pursued the judge, and he could not\nshake them off. An uneasy sense that he owed something to Ramona, or, if\nRamona were dead, to the little child she had left, haunted him. There\nmight in some such way be a sort of atonement made to the murdered,\nunavenged Alessandro. He might even take the child, and bring it up in\nhis own house. That was by no means an uncommon thing in the valley. The\nlonger he thought, the more he felt himself eased in his mind by this\npurpose; and he decided that as soon as he could find leisure he would\ngo to the Cahuilla village and see what could be done.\n\nBut it was not destined that stranger hands should bring succor to\nRamona. Felipe had at last found trace of her. Felipe was on the way.\n\n\n\n\nXXV\n\nEFFECTUALLY misled by the faithful Carmena, Felipe had begun his search\nfor Alessandro by going direct to Monterey. He found few Indians in the\nplace, and not one had ever heard Alessandro's name. Six miles from the\ntown was a little settlement of them, in hiding, in the bottoms of the\nSan Carlos River, near the old Mission. The Catholic priest advised him\nto search there; sometimes, he said, fugitives of one sort and another\ntook refuge in this settlement, lived there for a few months, then\ndisappeared as noiselessly as they had come. Felipe searched there also;\nequally in vain.\n\nHe questioned all the sailors in port; all the shippers. No one had\nheard of an Indian shipping on board any vessel; in fact, a captain\nwould have to be in straits before he would take an Indian in his crew.\n\n\"But this was an exceptionally good worker, this Indian; he could turn\nhis hand to anything; he might have gone as ship's carpenter.\"\n\n\"That might be,\" they said; \"nobody had ever heard of any such thing,\nhowever;\" and very much they all wondered what it was that made the\nhandsome, sad Mexican gentleman so anxious to find this Indian.\n\nFelipe wasted weeks in Monterey. Long after he had ceased to hope, he\nlingered. He felt as if he would like to stay till every ship that had\nsailed out of Monterey in the last three years had returned. Whenever he\nheard of one coming into harbor, he hastened to the shore, and closely\nwatched the disembarking. His melancholy countenance, with its eager,\nsearching look, became a familiar sight to every one; even the children\nknew that the pale gentleman was looking for some one he could not find.\nWomen pitied him, and gazed at him tenderly, wondering if a man could\nlook like that for anything save the loss of a sweetheart. Felipe made\nno confidences. He simply asked, day after day, of every one he met, for\nan Indian named Alessandro Assis.\n\nFinally he shook himself free from the dreamy spell of the place,\nand turned his face southward again. He went by the route which the\nFranciscan Fathers used to take, when the only road on the California\ncoast was the one leading from Mission to Mission. Felipe had heard\nFather Salvierderra say that there were in the neighborhood of each of\nthe old Missions Indian villages, or families still living. He thought\nit not improbable that, from Alessandro's father's long connection with\nthe San Luis Rey Mission, Alessandro might be known to some of these\nIndians. He would leave no stone unturned; no Indian village unsearched;\nno Indian unquestioned.\n\nSan Juan Bautista came first; then Soledad, San Antonio, San Miguel, San\nLuis Obispo, Santa Inez; and that brought him to Santa Barbara. He\nhad spent two months on the journey. At each of these places he found\nIndians; miserable, half-starved creatures, most of them. Felipe's heart\nached, and he was hot with shame, at their condition. The ruins of the\nold Mission buildings were sad to see, but the human ruins were sadder.\nNow Felipe understood why Father Salvierderra's heart had broken, and\nwhy his mother had been full of such fierce indignation against the\nheretic usurpers and despoilers of the estates which the Franciscans\nonce held. He could not understand why the Church had submitted,\nwithout fighting, to such indignities and robberies. At every one of the\nMissions he heard harrowing tales of the sufferings of those Fathers who\nhad clung to their congregations to the last, and died at their posts.\nAt Soledad an old Indian, weeping, showed him the grave of Father\nSarria, who had died there of starvation. \"He gave us all he had, to the\nlast,\" said the old man. \"He lay on a raw-hide on the ground, as we did;\nand one morning, before he had finished the mass, he fell forward at the\naltar and was dead. And when we put him in the grave, his body was only\nbones, and no flesh; he had gone so long without food, to give it to\nus.\"\n\nAt all these Missions Felipe asked in vain for Alessandro. They knew\nvery little, these northern Indians, about those in the south, they\nsaid. It was seldom one from the southern tribes came northward. They\ndid not understand each other's speech. The more Felipe inquired, and\nthe longer he reflected, the more he doubted Alessandro's having ever\ngone to Monterey. At Santa Barbara he made a long stay. The Brothers\nat the College welcomed him hospitably. They had heard from Father\nSalvierderra the sad story of Ramona, and were distressed, with Felipe,\nthat no traces had been found of her. It grieved Father Salvierderra to\nthe last, they said; he prayed for her daily, but said he could not get\nany certainty in his spirit of his prayers being heard. Only the day\nbefore he died, he had said this to Father Francis, a young Brazilian\nmonk, to whom he was greatly attached.\n\nIn Felipe's overwrought frame of mind this seemed to him a terrible\nomen; and he set out on his journey with a still heavier heart\nthan before. He believed Ramona was dead, buried in some unknown,\nunconsecrated spot, never to be found; yet he would not give up the\nsearch. As he journeyed southward, he began to find persons who had\nknown of Alessandro; and still more, those who had known his father, old\nPablo. But no one had heard anything of Alessandro's whereabouts since\nthe driving out of his people from Temecula; there was no knowing where\nany of those Temecula people were now. They had scattered \"like a flock\nof ducks,\" one Indian said,--\"like a flock of ducks after they are\nfired into. You'd never see all those ducks in any one place again. The\nTemecula people were here, there, and everywhere, all through San Diego\nCounty. There was one Temecula man at San Juan Capistrano, however. The\nSenor would better see him. He no doubt knew about Alessandro. He was\nliving in a room in the old Mission building. The priest had given it\nto him for taking care of the chapel and the priest's room, and a little\nrent besides. He was a hard man, the San Juan Capistrano priest; he\nwould take the last dollar from a poor man.\"\n\nIt was late at night when Felipe reached San Juan Capistrano; but he\ncould not sleep till he had seen this man. Here was the first clew he\nhad gained. He found the man, with his wife and children, in a large\ncorner room opening on the inner court of the Mission quadrangle. The\nroom was dark and damp as a cellar; a fire smouldered in the enormous\nfireplace; a few skins and rags were piled near the hearth, and on these\nlay the woman, evidently ill. The sunken tile floor was icy cold to the\nfeet; the wind swept in at a dozen broken places in the corridor side\nof the wall; there was not an article of furniture. \"Heavens!\" thought\nFelipe, as he entered, \"a priest of our Church take rent for such a hole\nas this!\"\n\nThere was no light in the place, except the little which came from the\nfire. \"I am sorry I have no candle, Senor,\" said the man, as he came\nforward. \"My wife is sick, and we are very poor.\"\n\n\"No matter,\" said Felipe, his hand already at his purse. \"I only want to\nask you a few questions. You are from Temecula, they tell me.\"\n\n\"Yes, Senor,\" the man replied in a dogged tone,--no man of Temecula\ncould yet hear the word without a pang,--\"I was of Temecula.\"\n\n\"I want to find one Alessandro Assis who lived there. You knew him, I\nsuppose,\" said Felipe, eagerly.\n\nAt this moment a brand broke in the smouldering fire, and for one second\na bright blaze shot up; only for a second, then all was dark again. But\nthe swift blaze had fallen on Felipe's face, and with a start which\nhe could not control, but which Felipe did not see, the Indian had\nrecognized him. \"Ha, ha!\" he thought to himself. \"Senor Felipe Moreno,\nyou come to the wrong house asking for news of Alessandro Assis!\"\n\nIt was Antonio,--Antonio, who had been at the Moreno sheep-shearing;\nAntonio, who knew even more than Carmena had known, for he knew what a\nmarvel and miracle it seemed that the beautiful Senorita from the Moreno\nhouse should have loved Alessandro, and wedded him; and he knew that on\nthe night she went away with him, Alessandro had lured out of the corral\na beautiful horse for her to ride. Alessandro had told him all about\nit,--Baba, fiery, splendid Baba, black as night, with a white star in\nhis forehead. Saints! but it was a bold thing to do, to steal such a\nhorse as that, with a star for a mark; and no wonder that even now,\nthough near three years afterwards, Senor Felipe was in search of him.\nOf course it could be only the horse he wanted. Ha! much help might he\nget from Antonio!\n\n\"Yes, Senor, I knew him,\" he replied.\n\n\"Do you know where he is now?\"\n\n\"No, Senor.\"\n\n\"Do you know where he went, from Temecula?\"\n\n\"No, Senor.\"\n\n\"A woman told me he went to Monterey. I have been there looking for\nhim.\"\n\n\"I heard, too, he had gone to Monterey.\"\n\n\"Where did you see him last?\"\n\n\"In Temecula.\"\n\n\"Was he alone?\"\n\n\"Yes, Senor.\"\n\n\"Did you ever hear of his being married?\"\n\n\"No, Senor.\"\n\n\"Where are the greater part of the Temecula people now?\"\n\n\"Like this, Senor,\" with a bitter gesture, pointing to his wife. \"Most\nof us are beggars. A few here, a few there. Some have gone to Capitan\nGrande, some way down into Lower California.\"\n\nWearily Felipe continued his bootless questioning. No suspicion that the\nman was deceiving him crossed his mind. At last, with a sigh, he\nsaid, \"I hoped to have found Alessandro by your means. I am greatly\ndisappointed.\n\n\"I doubt not that, Senor Felipe Moreno,\" thought Antonio. \"I am sorry,\nSenor,\" he said.\n\nIt smote his conscience when Felipe laid in his hand a generous\ngold-piece, and said, \"Here is a bit of money for you. I am sorry to see\nyou so poorly off.\"\n\nThe thanks which he spoke sounded hesitating and gruff, so remorseful\ndid he feel. Senor Felipe had always been kind to them. How well they\nhad fared always in his house! It was a shame to lie to him; yet the\nfirst duty was to Alessandro. It could not be avoided. And thus a second\ntime help drifted away from Ramona.\n\nAt Temecula, from Mrs. Hartsel, Felipe got the first true intelligence\nof Alessandro's movements; but at first it only confirmed his worst\nforebodings. Alessandro had been at Mrs. Hartsel's house; he had been\nalone, and on foot; he was going to walk all the way to San Pasquale,\nwhere he had the promise of work.\n\nHow sure the kindly woman was that she was telling the exact truth.\nAfter long ransacking of her memory and comparing of events, she fixed\nthe time so nearly to the true date, that it was to Felipe's mind a\nterrible corroboration of his fears. It was, he thought, about a week\nafter Ramona's flight from home that Alessandro had appeared thus,\nalone, on foot, at Mrs. Hartsel's. In great destitution, she said; and\nshe had lent him money on the expectation of selling his violin; but\nthey had never sold it; there it was yet. And that Alessandro was dead,\nshe had no more doubt than that she herself was alive; for else, he\nwould have come back to pay her what he owed. The honestest fellow that\never lived, was Alessandro. Did not the Senor Moreno think so? Had he\nnot found him so always? There were not many such Indians as Alessandro\nand his father. If there had been, it would have been better for their\npeople. \"If they'd all been like Alessandro, I tell you,\" she said, \"it\nwould have taken more than any San Diego sheriff to have put them out of\ntheir homes here.\"\n\n\"But what could they do to help themselves, Mrs. Hartsel?\" asked Felipe.\n\"The law was against them. We can't any of us go against that. I myself\nhave lost half my estate in the same way.\"\n\n\"Well, at any rate they wouldn't have gone without fighting!\" she said.\n\"'If Alessandro had been here!' they all said.\"\n\nFelipe asked to see the violin. \"But that is not Alessandro's,\" he\nexclaimed. \"I have seen his.\"\n\n\"No!\" she said. \"Did I say it was his? It was his father's. One of the\nIndians brought it in here to hide it with us at the time they were\ndriven out. It is very old, they say, and worth a great deal of money,\nif you could find the right man to buy it. But he has not come along\nyet. He will, though. I am not a bit afraid but that we'll get our money\nback on it. If Alessandro was alive, he'd have been here long before\nthis.\"\n\nFinding Mrs. Hartsel thus friendly, Felipe suddenly decided to tell\nher the whole story. Surprise and incredulity almost overpowered her at\nfirst. She sat buried in thought for some minutes; then she sprang\nto her feet, and cried: \"If he's got that girl with him, he's hiding\nsomewhere. There's nothing like an Indian to hide; and if he is hiding,\nevery other Indian knows it, and you just waste your breath asking any\nquestions of any of them. They will die before they will tell you one\nthing. They are as secret as the grave. And they, every one of them,\nworshipped Alessandro. You see they thought he would be over them, after\nPablo, and they were all proud of him because he could read and\nwrite, and knew more than most of them. If I were in your place,\" she\ncontinued, \"I would not give it up yet. I should go to San Pasquale. Now\nit might just be that she was along with him that night he stopped here,\nhid somewhere, while he came in to get the money. I know I urged him to\nstay all night, and he said he could not do it. I don't know, though,\nwhere he could possibly have left her while he came here.\"\n\nNever in all her life had Mrs. Hartsel been so puzzled and so astonished\nas now. But her sympathy, and her confident belief that Alessandro might\nyet be found, gave unspeakable cheer to Felipe.\n\n\"If I find them, I shall take them home with me, Mrs. Hartsel,\" he said\nas he rode away; \"and we will come by this road and stop to see you.\"\nAnd the very speaking of the words cheered him all the way to San\nPasquale.\n\nBut before he had been in San Pasquale an hour, he was plunged into a\nperplexity and disappointment deeper than he had yet felt. He found the\nvillage in disorder, the fields neglected, many houses deserted, the\nremainder of the people preparing to move away. In the house of Ysidro,\nAlessandro's kinsman, was living a white family,--the family of a man\nwho had pre-empted the greater part of the land on which the village\nstood. Ysidro, profiting by Alessandro's example, when he found\nthat there was no help, that the American had his papers from the\nland-office, in all due form, certifying that the land was his, had\ngiven the man his option of paying for the house or having it burned\ndown. The man had bought the house; and it was only the week before\nFelipe arrived, that Ysidro had set off, with all his goods and\nchattels, for Mesa Grande. He might possibly have told the Senor more,\nthe people said, than any one now in the village could; but even Ysidro\ndid not know where Alessandro intended to settle. He told no one. He\nwent to the north. That was all they knew.\n\nTo the north! That north which Felipe thought he had thoroughly\nsearched. He sighed at the word. The Senor could, if he liked, see the\nhouse in which Alessandro had lived. There it was, on the south side of\nthe valley, just in the edge of the foothills; some Americans lived in\nit now. Such a good ranch Alessandro had; the best wheat in the valley.\nThe American had paid Alessandro something for it,--they did not know\nhow much; but Alessandro was very lucky to get anything. If only they\nhad listened to him. He was always telling them this would come. Now it\nwas too late for most of them to get anything for their farms. One man\nhad taken the whole of the village lands, and he had bought Ysidro's\nhouse because it was the best; and so they would not get anything. They\nwere utterly disheartened, broken-spirited.\n\nIn his sympathy for them, Felipe almost forgot his own distresses.\n\"Where are you going?\" he asked of several.\n\n\"Who knows, Senor?\" was their reply. \"Where can we go? There is no\nplace.\"\n\nWhen, in reply to his questions in regard to Alessandro's wife, Felipe\nheard her spoken of as \"Majella,\" his perplexity deepened. Finally he\nasked if no one had ever heard the name Ramona.\n\n\"Never.\"\n\nWhat could it mean? Could it be possible that this was another\nAlessandro than the one of whom he was in search? Felipe bethought\nhimself of a possible marriage-record. Did they know where Alessandro\nhad married this wife of his, of whom every word they spoke seemed both\nlike and unlike Ramona?\n\nYes. It was in San Diego they had been married, by Father Gaspara.\n\nHoping against hope, the baffled Felipe rode on to San Diego; and here,\nas ill-luck would have it, he found, not Father Gaspara, who would at\nhis first word have understood all, but a young Irish priest, who had\nonly just come to be Father Gaspara's assistant. Father Gaspara was\naway in the mountains, at Santa Ysabel. But the young assistant would do\nequally well, to examine the records. He was courteous and kind; brought\nout the tattered old book, and, looking over his shoulder, his breath\ncoming fast with excitement and fear, there Felipe read, in Father\nGaspara's hasty and blotted characters, the fatal entry of the names,\n\"Alessandro Assis and Majella Fa--\"\n\nHeart-sick, Felipe went away. Most certainly Ramona would never have\nbeen married under any but her own name. Who, then, was this woman whom\nAlessandro Assis had married in less than ten days from the night on\nwhich Ramona had left her home? Some Indian woman for whom he felt\ncompassion, or to whom he was bound by previous ties? And where, in what\nlonely, forever hidden spot, was the grave of Ramona?\n\nNow at last Felipe felt sure that she was dead. It was useless searching\nfarther. Yet, after he reached home, his restless conjectures took one\nmore turn, and he sat down and wrote a letter to every priest between\nSan Diego and Monterey, asking if there were on his books a record of\nthe marriage of one Alessandro Assis and Ramona Ortegna.\n\nIt was not impossible that there might be, after all, another Alessandro\nAssis, The old Fathers, in baptizing their tens of thousands of Indian\nconverts, were sore put to it to make out names enough. There might\nhave been another Assis besides old Pablo, and of Alessandros there were\ndozens everywhere.\n\nThis last faint hope also failed. No record anywhere of an Alessandro\nAssis, except in Father Gaspara's book.\n\nAs Felipe was riding out of San Pasquale, he had seen an Indian man and\nwoman walking by the side of mules heavily laden. Two little children,\ntwo young or too feeble to walk, were so packed in among the bundles\nthat their faces were the only part of them in sight. The woman was\ncrying bitterly. \"More of these exiles. God help the poor creatures!\"\nthought Felipe; and he pulled out his purse, and gave the woman a piece\nof gold. She looked up in as great astonishment as if the money had\nfallen from the skies. \"Thanks! Thanks, Senor!\" she exclaimed; and the\nman coming up to Felipe said also, \"God reward you, Senor! That is more\nmoney than I had in the world! Does the Senor know of any place where I\ncould get work?\"\n\nFelipe longed to say, \"Yes, come to my estate; there you shall have\nwork!\" In the olden time he would have done it without a second thought,\nfor both the man and the woman had good faces,--were young and strong.\nBut the pay-roll of the Moreno estate was even now too long for\nits dwindled fortunes. \"No, my man, I am sorry to say I do not,\" he\nanswered. \"I live a long way from here. Where were you thinking of\ngoing?\"\n\n\"Somewhere in San Jacinto,\" said the man. \"They say the Americans have\nnot come in there much yet. I have a brother living there. Thanks,\nSenor; may the saints reward you!\"\n\n\"San Jacinto!\" After Felipe returned home, the name haunted his\nthoughts. The grand mountain-top bearing that name he had known well\nin many a distant horizon. \"Juan Can,\" he said one day, \"are there many\nIndians in San Jacinto?\"\n\n\"The mountain?\" said Juan Can.\n\n\"Ay, I suppose, the mountain,\" said Felipe. \"What else is there?\"\n\n\"The valley, too,\" replied Juan. \"The San Jacinto Valley is a fine,\nbroad valley, though the river is not much to be counted on. It is\nmostly dry sand a good part of the year. But there is good grazing.\nThere is one village of Indians I know in the valley; some of the\nSan Luis Rey Indians came from there; and up on the mountain is a big\nvillage; the wildest Indians in all the country live there. Oh, they are\nfierce, Senor!\"\n\nThe next morning Felipe set out for San Jacinto. Why had no one\nmentioned, why had he not himself known, of these villages? Perhaps\nthere were yet others he had not heard of. Hope sprang in Felipe's\nimpressionable nature as easily as it died. An hour, a moment, might see\nhim both lifted up and cast down. When he rode into the sleepy little\nvillage street of San Bernardino, and saw, in the near horizon, against\nthe southern sky, a superb mountain-peak, changing in the sunset lights\nfrom turquoise to ruby, and from ruby to turquoise again, he said to\nhimself, \"She is there! I have found her!\"\n\nThe sight of the mountain affected him, as it had always affected Aunt\nRi, with an indefinable, solemn sense of something revealed, yet hidden.\n\"San Jacinto?\" he said to a bystander, pointing to it with his whip.\n\n\"Yes, Senor,\" replied the man. As he spoke, a pair of black horses came\nwhirling round the corner, and he sprang to one side, narrowly escaping\nbeing knocked down. \"That Tennessee fellow'll run over somebody yet,\nwith those black devils of his, if he don't look out,\" he muttered, as\nhe recovered his balance.\n\nFelipe glanced at the horses, then driving his spurs deep into his\nhorse's sides, galloped after them. \"Baba! by God!\" he cried aloud in\nhis excitement and forgetful of everything, he urged his horse faster,\nshouting as he rode, \"Stop that man! Stop that man with the black\nhorses!\"\n\nJos, hearing his name called on all sides, reined in Benito and Baba\nas soon as he could, and looked around in bewilderment to see what had\nhappened. Before he had time to ask any questions, Felipe had overtaken\nhim, and riding straight to Baba's head, had flung himself from his own\nhorse and taken Baba by the rein, crying, \"Baba! Baba!\" Baba knew his\nvoice, and began to whinny and plunge. Felipe was nearly unmanned. For\nthe second, he forgot everything. A crowd was gathering around them. It\nhad never been quite clear to the San Bernardino mind that Jos's title\nto Benito and Baba would bear looking into; and it was no surprise,\ntherefore, to some of the on-lookers, to hear Felipe cry in a loud\nvoice, looking suspiciously at Jos, \"How did you get him?\"\n\nJos was a wag, and Jos was never hurried. The man did not live, nor\ncould the occasion arrive, which would quicken his constitutional drawl.\nBefore even beginning his answer he crossed one leg over the other and\ntook a long, observant look at Felipe; then in a pleasant voice he said:\n\"Wall, Senor,--I allow yer air a Senor by yer color,--it would take\nright smart uv time tew tell yeow haow I cum by thet hoss, 'n' by the\nother one tew. They ain't mine, neither one on 'em.\"\n\nJos's speech was as unintelligible to Felipe as it had been to Ramona,\nJos saw it, and chuckled.\n\n\"Mebbe 't would holp yer tew understand me ef I wuz tew talk Mexican,\"\nhe said, and proceeded to repeat in tolerably good Spanish the sum and\nsubstance of what he had just said, adding: \"They belong to an Indian\nover on San Jacinto; at least, the off one does; the nigh one's his\nwife's; he wouldn't ever call thet one anything but hers. It had been\nhers ever sence she was a girl, they said, I never saw people think so\nmuch of hosses as they did.\"\n\nBefore Jos had finished speaking, Felipe had bounded into the wagon,\nthrowing his horse's reins to a boy in the crowd, and crying, \"Follow\nalong with my horse, will you? I must speak to this man.\"\n\nFound! Found,--the saints be praised,--at last! How should he tell this\nman fast enough? How should he thank him enough?\n\nLaying his hand on Jos's knee, he cried: \"I can't explain to you; I\ncan't tell you. Bless you forever,--forever! It must be the saints led\nyou here!\"\n\n\"Oh, Lawd!\" thought Jos; \"another o' them 'saint' fellers! I allow not,\nSenor,\" he said, relapsing into Tennesseean. \"It wur Tom Wurmsee led me;\nI wuz gwine ter move his truck fur him this arternoon.\"\n\n\"Take me home with you to your house,\" said Felipe, still trembling with\nexcitement; \"we cannot talk here in the street. I want to hear all\nyou can tell me about them. I have been searching for them all over\nCalifornia.\"\n\nJos's face lighted up. This meant good fortune for that gentle, sweet\nRamona, he was sure. \"I'll take you straight there,\" he said; \"but first\nI must stop at Tom's. He will be waiting for me.\"\n\nThe crowd dispersed, disappointed; cheated out of their anticipated\nscene of an arrest for horse-stealing. \"Good for you, Tennessee!\" and,\n\"Fork over that black horse, Jos!\" echoed from the departing groups.\nSensations were not so common in San Bernardino that they could afford\nto slight so notable an occasion as this.\n\nAs Jos turned the corner into the street where he lived, he saw his\nmother coming at a rapid run towards them, her sun-bonnet half off her\nhead, her spectacles pushed up in her hair.\n\n\"Why, thar's mammy!\" he exclaimed. \"What ever hez gone wrong naow?\"\n\nBefore he finished speaking, she saw the black horses, and snatching\nher bonnet from her head waved it wildly, crying, \"Yeow Jos! Jos, hyar!\nStop! I wuz er comin' ter hunt yer!\"\n\nBreathlessly she continued talking, her words half lost in the sound\nof the wheels. Apparently she did not see the stranger sitting by Jos's\nside. \"Oh, Jos, thar's the terriblest news come! Thet Injun Alessandro's\ngot killed; murdered; jest murdered, I say; 'tain't no less. Thar wuz an\nInjun come down from ther mounting with a letter to the Agent.\"\n\n\"Good God! Alessandro killed!\" burst from Felipe's lips in a\nheart-rending voice.\n\nJos looked bewilderedly from his mother to Felipe; the complication was\nalmost beyond him. \"Oh, Lawd!\" he gasped. Turning to Felipe, \"Thet's\nmammy,\" he said. \"She wuz real fond o' both on 'em.\" Turning to his\nmother, \"This hyar's her brother,\" he said. \"He jest knowed me by Baba,\nhyar on ther street. He's been huntin' 'em everywhar.\"\n\nAunt Ri grasped the situation instantly. Wiping her streaming eyes, she\nsobbed out: \"Wall, I'll allow, arter this, thar is sech a thing ez a\nProvidence, ez they call it. 'Pears like ther couldn't ennythin' less\nbrung yer hyar jest naow. I know who yer be; ye're her brother Feeleepy,\nain't yer? Menny's ther time she's tolt me about yer! Oh, Lawd! How air\nwe ever goin' to git ter her? I allow she's dead! I allow she'd never\nlive arter seein' him shot down dead! He tolt me thar couldn't nobody\ngit up thar whar they'd gone; no white folks, I mean. Oh, Lawd, Lawd!\"\n\nFelipe stood paralyzed, horror-stricken. He turned in despair to Jos.\n\"Tell me in Spanish,\" he said. \"I cannot understand.\"\n\nAs Jos gradually drew out the whole story from his mother's excited and\nincoherent speech, and translated it, Felipe groaned aloud, \"Too late!\nToo late!\" He too felt, as Aunt Ri had, that Ramona never could have\nsurvived the shock of seeing her husband murdered. \"Too late! Too late!\"\nhe cried, as he staggered into the house. \"She has surely died of the\nsight.\"\n\n\"I allow she didn't die, nuther,\" said Jos; \"not ser long ez she hed\nthet young un to look arter!\"\n\n\"Yer air right, Jos!\" said Aunt Ri. \"I allow yer air right. Thar\ncouldn't nothin' kill her, short er wild beasts, ef she hed ther baby\n'n her arms! She ain't dead, not ef the baby ez erlive, I allow. Thet's\nsome comfort.\"\n\nFelipe sat with his face buried in his hands. Suddenly looking up, he\nsaid, \"How far is it?\"\n\n\"Thirty miles 'n' more inter the valley, where we wuz,\" said Jos; \"'n'\nthe Lawd knows how fur 'tis up on ter the mounting, where they wuz\nlivin'. It's like goin' up the wall uv a house, goin' up San Jacinto\nMounting, daddy sez. He wuz thar huntin' all summer with Alessandro.\"\n\nHow strange, how incredible it seemed, to hear Alessandro's name thus\nfamiliarly spoken,--spoken by persons who had known him so recently, and\nwho were grieving, grieving as friends, to hear of his terrible death!\nFelipe felt as if he were in a trance. Rousing himself, he said, \"We\nmust go. We must start at once. You will let me have the horses?\"\n\n\"Wall, I allow yer've got more right ter 'em 'n--\" began Jos,\nenergetically, forgetting himself; then, dropping Tennesseean, he\ncompleted in Spanish his cordial assurances that the horses were at\nFelipe's command.\n\n\"Jos! He's got ter take me!\" cried Aunt Ri. \"I allow I ain't never gwine\nter set still hyar, 'n' thet girl inter sech trouble; 'n' if so be\nez she is reely dead, thar's the baby. He hadn't orter go alone by\nhisself.\"\n\nFelipe was thankful, indeed, for Aunt Ri's companionship, and expressed\nhimself in phrases so warm, that she was embarrassed.\n\n\"Yeow tell him, Jos,\" she said, \"I can't never git used ter bein' called\nSenory. Yeow tell him his' sister allers called me Aunt Ri, 'n' I jest\nwish he would. I allow me 'n' him'll git along all right. 'Pears like\nI'd known him all my days, jest ez 't did with her, arter the fust.\nI'm free to confess I take more ter these Mexicans than I do ter these\nlow-down, driven Yankees, ennyhow,--a heap more; but I can't stand\nbein' Senory'd! Yeow tell him, Jos. I s'pose thar's a word for 'aunt' in\nMexican, ain't there? 'Pears like thar couldn't be no langwedge 'thout\nsech a word! He'll know what it means! I'd go off with him a heap easier\nef he'd call me jest plain Aunt Ri, ez I'm used ter, or Mis Hyer, either\nun on 'em; but Aunt Ri's the nateralest.\"\n\nJos had some anxiety about his mother's memory of the way to San\nJacinto. She laughed.\n\n\"Don't yeow be a mite oneasy,\" she said. \"I bet yeow I'd go clean back\nter the States ther way we cum. I allow I've got every mile on 't 'n\nmy hed plain's a turnpike. Yeow nor yer dad, neiry one on yer, couldn't\nbegin to do 't. But what we air gwine ter do, fur gettin' up the\nmounting, thet's another thing. Thet's more 'n I dew know. But thar'll\nbe a way pervided, Jos, sure's yeow're bawn. The Lawd ain't gwine to get\nhisself hindered er holpin' Ramony this time; I ain't a mite afeerd.\"\n\nFelipe could not have found a better ally. The comparative silence\nenforced between them by reason of lack of a common vehicle for their\nthoughts was on the whole less of a disadvantage than would have at\nfirst appeared. They understood each other well enough for practical\npurposes, and their unity in aim, and in affection for Ramona, made a\nbond so strong, it could not have been enhanced by words.\n\nIt was past sundown when they left San Bernardino, but a full moon made\nthe night as good as day for their journey. When it first shone out,\nAunt Ri, pointing to it, said curtly, \"Thet's lucky.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Felipe, who did not know either of the words she had\nspoken, \"it is good. It shows to us the way.\"\n\n\"Thar, naow, say he can't understand English!\" thought Aunt Ri.\n\nBenito and Baba travelled as if they knew the errand on which they were\nhurrying. Good forty miles they had gone without flagging once, when\nAunt Ri, pointing to a house on the right hand of the road, the only one\nthey had seen for many miles, said: \"We'll hev to sleep hyar. I donno\nthe road beyant this. I allow they're gone ter bed; but they'll hev to\ngit up 'n' take us in. They're used ter doin' it. They dew consid'able\nbusiness keepin' movers. I know 'em. They're reel friendly fur the kind\no' people they air. They're druv to death. It can't be far frum their\ntime to git up, ennyhow. They're up every mornin' uv thar lives long\nafore daylight, a feedin' their stock, an' gittin' ready fur the day's\nwork. I used ter hear 'em 'n' see 'em, when we wuz campin' here. The\nfust I saw uv it, I thought somebody wuz sick in the house, to git 'em\nup thet time o' night; but arterwards we found out 't wan't nothin' but\nthar reggerlar way. When I told dad, sez I, 'Dad, did ever yer hear\nsech a thing uz gittin' up afore light to feed stock?' 'n' ter feed\ntheirselves tew. They'd their own breakfast all clared away, 'n' dishes\nwashed, too, afore light; 'n' prayers said beside; they're Methodys,\nterrible pious. I used ter tell dad they talked a heap about believin'\nin God; I don't allow but what they dew believe in God, tew, but\nthey don't worship Him so much's they worship work; not nigh so much.\nBelievin' 'n' worshippin' 's tew things. Yeow wouldn't see no sech\ndoin's in Tennessee. I allow the Lawd meant some time fur sleepin'; 'n'\nI'm satisfied with his times o' lightin' up. But these Merrills air reel\nnice folks, fur all this I've ben tellin' yer!--Lawd! I don't believe\nhe's understood a word I've said, naow!\" thought Aunt Ri to herself,\nsuddenly becoming aware of the hopeless bewilderment on Felipe's face.\n\"'Tain't much use sayin' anything more'n plain yes 'n' no, between folks\nthet can't understand each other's langwedge; 'n' s' fur's thet goes, I\nallow thar ain't any gret use'n the biggest part o' what's sed between\nfolks thet doos!\"\n\nWhen the Merrill family learned Felipe's purpose of going up the\nmountain to the Cahuilla village, they attempted to dissuade him from\ntaking his own horses. He would kill them both, high-spirited horses\nlike those, they said, if he took them over that road. It was a cruel\nroad. They pointed out to him the line where it wound, doubling and\ntacking on the sides of precipices, like a path for a goat or chamois.\nAunt Ri shuddered at the sight, but said nothing.\n\n\"I'm gwine whar he goes,\" she said grimly to herself. \"I ain't a gwine\nter back daown naow; but I dew jest wish Jeff Hyer wuz along.\"\n\nFelipe himself disliked what he saw and heard of the grade. The road\nhad been built for bringing down lumber, and for six miles it was at\nperilous angles. After this it wound along on ridges and in ravines till\nit reached the heart of a great pine forest, where stood a saw-mill.\nPassing this, it plunged into still darker, denser woods, some fifteen\nmiles farther on, and then came out among vast opens, meadows, and\ngrassy foot-hills, still on the majestic mountain's northern or eastern\nslopes. From these, another steep road, little more than a trail, led\nsouth, and up to the Cahuilla village. A day and a half's hard journey,\nat the shortest, it was from Merrill's; and no one unfamiliar with the\ncountry could find the last part of the way without a guide. Finally\nit was arranged that one of the younger Merrills should go in this\ncapacity, and should also take two of his strongest horses, accustomed\nto the road. By the help of these the terrible ascent was made without\ndifficulty, though Baba at first snorted, plunged, and resented the\nhumiliation of being harnessed with his head at another horse's tail.\n\nExcept for their sad errand, both Felipe and Aunt Ri would have\nexperienced a keen delight in this ascent. With each fresh lift on the\nprecipitous terraces, the view off to the south and west broadened,\nuntil the whole San Jacinto Valley lay unrolled at their feet. The pines\nwere grand; standing, they seemed shapely columns; fallen, the upper\ncurve of their huge yellow disks came above a man's head, so massive was\ntheir size. On many of them the bark had been riddled from root to top,\nas by myriads of bullet-holes. In each hole had been cunningly stored\naway an acorn,--the woodpeckers' granaries.\n\n\"Look at thet, naow!\" exclaimed the observant Aunt Ri; \"an' thar's\nfolk's thet sez dumb critters ain't got brains. They ain't noways dumb\nto each other, I notice; an' we air dumb aourselves when we air ketched\nwith furriners. I allow I'm next door to dumb myself with this hyar\nMexican I'm er travellin' with.\"\n\n\"That's so!\" replied Sam Merrill. \"When we fust got here, I thought I'd\nha' gone clean out o' my head tryin' to make these Mexicans sense my\nmeanin'; my tongue was plaguy little use to me. But now I can talk their\nlingo fust-rate; but pa, he can't talk to 'em nohow; he hain't learned\nthe fust word; 'n' he's ben here goin' on two years longer'n we have.\"\n\nThe miles seemed leagues to Felipe. Aunt Ri's drawling tones, as she\nchatted volubly with young Merrill, chafed him. How could she chatter!\nBut when he thought this, it would chance that in a few moments more he\nwould see her clandestinely wiping away tears, and his heart would warm\nto her again.\n\nThey slept at a miserable cabin in one of the clearings, and at early\ndawn pushed on, reaching the Cahuilla village before noon. As their\ncarriage came in sight, a great running to and fro of people was to be\nseen. Such an event as the arrival of a comfortable carriage drawn by\nfour horses had never before taken place in the village. The agitation\ninto which the people had been thrown by the murder of Alessandro had\nby no means subsided; they were all on the alert, suspicious of each new\noccurrence. The news had only just reached the village that Farrar had\nbeen set at liberty, and would not be punished for his crime, and the\nflames of indignation and desire for vengeance, which the aged Capitan\nhad so much difficulty in allaying in the outset, were bursting forth\nagain this morning. It was therefore a crowd of hostile and lowering\nfaces which gathered around the carriage as it stopped in front of the\nCapitan's house.\n\nAunt Ri's face was a ludicrous study of mingled terror, defiance, and\ncontempt. \"Uv all ther low-down, no-'count, beggarly trash ever I laid\neyes on,\" she said in a low tone to Merrill, \"I allow these yere air the\nwust! But I allow they'd flatten us all aout in jest abaout a minnit,\nif they wuz to set aout tew! Ef she ain't hyar, we air in a scrape, I\nallow.\"\n\n\"Oh, they're friendly enough,\" laughed Merrill. \"They're all stirred\nup, now, about the killin' o' that Injun; that's what makes 'em look\nso fierce. I don't wonder! 'Twas a derned mean thing Jim Farrar did, a\nfirin' into the man after he was dead. I don't blame him for killin'\nthe cuss, not a bit; I'd have shot any man livin' that 'ad taken a good\nhorse o' mine up that trail. That's the only law we stock men've got\nout in this country. We've got to protect ourselves. But it was a mean,\nlow-lived trick to blow the feller's face to pieces after he was dead;\nbut Jim's a rough feller, 'n' I expect he was so mad, when he see his\nhorse, that he didn't know what he did.\"\n\nAunt Ri was half paralyzed with astonishment at this speech. Felipe had\nleaped out of the carriage, and after a few words with the old Capitan,\nhad hurried with him into his house. Felipe had evidently forgotten that\nshe was still in the carriage. His going into the house looked as if\nRamona was there. Aunt Ri, in all her indignation and astonishment, was\nconscious of this train of thought running through her mind; but not\neven the near prospect of seeing Ramona could bridle her tongue now,\nor make her defer replying to the extraordinary statements she had just\nheard. The words seemed to choke her as she began. \"Young man,\" she\nsaid, \"I donno much abaout yeour raisin'. I've heered yeour folks wuz\ngreat on religion. Naow, we ain't, Jeff 'n' me; we warn't raised thet\nway; but I allow ef I wuz ter hear my boy, Jos,--he's jest abaout yeour\nage, 'n' make tew, though he's narrerer chested,--ef I should hear him\nsay what yeou've jest said, I allow I sh'd expect to see him struck by\nlightnin'; 'n' I sh'dn't think he hed got more 'n his deserts, I allow I\nsh'dn't!\"\n\nWhat more Aunt Ri would have said to the astounded Merrill was never\nknown, for at that instant the old Capitan, returning to the door,\nbeckoned to her; and springing from her seat to the ground, sternly\nrejecting Sam's offered hand, she hastily entered the house. As she\ncrossed the threshold, Felipe turned an anguished face toward her, and\nsaid, \"Come, speak to her.\" He was on his knees by a wretched pallet on\nthe floor. Was that Ramona,--that prostrate form; hair dishevelled, eyes\nglittering, cheeks scarlet, hands playing meaninglessly, like the hands\nof one crazed, with a rosary of gold beads? Yes, it was Ramona; and\nit was like this she had lain there now ten days; and the people had\nexhausted all their simple skill for her in vain.\n\nAunt Ri burst into tears. \"Oh, Lawd!\" she said. \"Ef I had some 'old man'\nhyar, I'd bring her aout er thet fever! I dew bleeve I seed some on 't\ngrowin' not more'n er mile back.\" And without a second look, or another\nword, she ran out of the door, and springing into the carriage, said,\nspeaking faster than she had been heard to speak for thirty years: \"Yeow\njest turn raound 'n' drive me back a piece, the way we come. I allow\nI'll git a weed thet'll break thet fever. Faster, faster! Run yer\nhosses. 'Tain't above er mile back, whar I seed it,\" she cried, leaning\nout, eagerly scrutinizing each inch of the barren ground. \"Stop! Here\n'tis!\" she cried. \"I knowed I smelt the bitter on 't somewhars along\nhyar;\" and in a few minutes more she had a mass of the soft, shining,\ngray, feathery leaves in her hands, and was urging the horses fiercely\non their way back. \"This'll cure her, ef ennything will,\" she said, as\nshe entered the room again; but her heart sank as she saw Ramona's eyes\nroving restlessly over Felipe's face, no sign of recognition in them.\n\"She's bad,\" she said, her lips trembling; \"but, 'never say die!' ez\nallers our motto; 'tain't never tew late fur ennything but oncet, 'n'\nyer can't tell when thet time's come till it's past 'n' gone.\"\n\nSteaming bowls of the bitterly odorous infusion she held at Ramona's\nnostrils; with infinite patience she forced drop after drop of it\nbetween the unconscious lips; she bathed the hands and head, her own\nhands blistered by the heat. It was a fight with death; but love and\nlife won. Before night Ramona was asleep.\n\nFelipe and Aunt Ri sat by her, strange but not uncongenial watchers,\neach taking heart from the other's devotion. All night long Ramona\nslept. As Felipe watched her, he remembered his own fever, and how she\nhad knelt by his bed and prayed there. He glanced around the room. In a\nniche in the mud wall was a cheap print of the Madonna, one candle just\nsmouldering out before it. The village people had drawn heavily on their\npoverty-stricken stores, keeping candles burning for Alessandro and\nRamona during the past ten days. The rosary had slipped from Ramona's\nhold; taking it cautiously in his hand, Felipe went to the Madonna's\npicture, and falling on his knees, began to pray as simply as if he were\nalone. The Indians, standing on the doorway, also fell on their knees,\nand a low-whispered murmur was heard.\n\nFor a moment Aunt Ri looked at the kneeling figures with contempt. \"Oh,\nLawd!\" she thought, \"the pore heathen, prayin' ter a picter!\" Then a\nsudden revulsion seized her. \"I allow I ain't gwine ter be the unly one\nout er the hull number thet don't seem to hev nothin' ter pray ter; I\nallow I'll jine in prayer, tew, but I shan't say mine ter no picter!\"\nAnd Aunt Ri fell on her knees; and when a young Indian woman by her side\nslipped a rosary into her hand, Aunt Ri did not repulse it, but hid it\nin the folds of her gown till the prayers were done. It was a moment and\na lesson Aunt Ri never forgot.\n\n\n\n\nXXVI\n\nTHE Capitan's house faced the east. Just as day broke, and the light\nstreamed in at the open door, Ramona's eyes unclosed. Felipe and Aunt\nRi were both by her side. With a look of bewildered terror, she gazed at\nthem.\n\n\"Thar, thar, naow! Yer jest shet yer eyes 'n' go right off ter sleep\nagin, honey,\" said Aunt Ri, composedly, laying her hand on Ramona's\neyelids, and compelling them down. \"We air hyar, Feeleepy 'n' me, 'n'\nwe air goin' ter stay. I allow yer needn't be afeerd o' nothin'. Go ter\nsleep, honey.\"\n\nThe eyelids quivered beneath Aunt Ri's fingers. Tears forced their way,\nand rolled slowly down the cheeks. The lips trembled; the voice strove\nto speak, but it was only like the ghost of a whisper, the faint\nquestion that came,--\"Felipe?\"\n\n\"Yes, dear! I am here, too,\" breathed Felipe; \"go to sleep. We will not\nleave you!\"\n\nAnd again Ramona sank away into the merciful sleep which was saving her\nlife.\n\n\"Ther longer she kin sleep, ther better,\" said Aunt Ri, with a sigh,\ndeep-drawn like a groan. \"I allow I dread ter see her reely come to.\n'T'll be wus'n the fust; she'll hev ter live it all over again!\"\n\nBut Aunt Ri did not know what forces of fortitude had been gathering\nin Ramona's soul during these last bitter years. Out of her gentle\nconstancy had been woven the heroic fibre of which martyrs are made;\nthis, and her inextinguishable faith, had made her strong, as were\nthose of old, who \"had trial of cruel mocking, wandering about, being\ndestitute, afflicted, tormented, wandered in deserts and in mountains,\nand in dens and caves of the earth.\"\n\nWhen she waked the second time, it was with a calm, almost beatific\nsmile that she gazed on Felipe, and whispered, \"How did you find me,\ndear Felipe?\" It was rather by the motions of her lips than by any\nsound that he knew the words. She had not yet strength enough to make an\naudible sound. When they laid her baby on her breast, she smiled again,\nand tried to embrace her, but was too weak. Pointing to the baby's eyes,\nshe whispered, gazing earnestly at Felipe, \"Alessandro.\" A convulsion\npassed over her face as she spoke the word, and the tears flowed.\n\nFelipe could not speak. He glanced helplessly at Aunt Ri, who promptly\nresponded: \"Naow, honey, don't yeow talk. 'Tain't good fur ye; 'n'\nFeeleepy 'n' me, we air in a powerful hurry ter git yer strong 'n'\nwell, 'n' tote ye out er this--\" Aunt Ri stopped. No substantive in her\nvocabulary answered her need at that moment. \"I allow ye kin go 'n a\nweek, ef nothin' don't go agin ye more'n I see naow; but ef yer git ter\ntalkin', thar's no tellin' when yer'll git up. Yeow jest shet up, honey.\nWe'll look arter everythin'.\"\n\nFeebly Ramona turned her grateful, inquiring eyes on Felipe. Her lips\nframed the words, \"With you?\"\n\n\"Yes, dear, home with me,\" said Felipe, clasping her hand in his. \"I\nhave been searching for you all this time.\"\n\nAn anxious look came into the sweet face. Felipe knew what it meant. How\noften he had seen it in the olden time. He feared to shock her by the\nsudden mention of the Senora's death; yet that would harm her less than\ncontinued anxiety. \"I am alone, dear Ramona,\" he whispered. \"There is no\none now but you, my sister, to take care of me. My mother has been dead\na year.\"\n\nThe eyes dilated, then filled with sympathetic tears. \"Dear Felipe!\"\nshe sighed; but her heart took courage. Felipe's phrase was like one\ninspired; another duty, another work, another loyalty, waiting for\nRamona. Not only her child to live for, but to \"take care of Felipe\"!\nRamona would not die! Youth, a mother's love, a sister's affection and\nduty, on the side of life,--the battle was won, and won quickly, too.\n\nTo the simple Cahuillas it seemed like a miracle; and they looked on\nAunt Ri's weather-beaten face with something akin to a superstitious\nreverence. They themselves were not ignorant of the value of the herb\nby means of which she had wrought the marvellous cure; but they had made\nrepeated experiments with it upon Ramona, without success. It must be\nthat there had been some potent spell in Aunt Ri's handling. They would\nhardly believe her when, in answer to their persistent questioning, she\nreiterated the assertion that she had used nothing except the hot water\nand \"old man,\" which was her name for the wild wormwood; and which,\nwhen explained to them, impressed them greatly, as having no doubt some\nsignificance in connection with the results of her preparation of the\nleaves.\n\nRumors about Felipe ran swiftly throughout the region. The presence in\nthe Cahuilla village of a rich Mexican gentleman who spent gold like\nwater, and kept mounted men riding day and night, after everything,\nanything, he wanted for his sick sister, was an event which in the\natmosphere of that lonely country loomed into colossal proportions. He\nhad travelled all over California, with four horses, in search of her.\nHe was only waiting till she was well, to take her to his home in the\nsouth; and then he was going to arrest the man who had murdered her\nhusband, and have him hanged,--yes, hanged! Small doubt about that;\nor, if the law cleared him, there was still the bullet. This rich Senor\nwould see him shot, if rope were not to be had. Jim Farrar heard these\ntales, and quaked in his guilty soul. The rope he had small fear of, for\nwell he knew the temper of San Diego County juries and judges; but the\nbullet, that was another thing; and these Mexicans were like Indians in\ntheir vengeance. Time did not tire them, and their memories were long.\nFarrar cursed the day he had let his temper get the better of him on\nthat lonely mountainside; how much the better, nobody but he himself\nknew,--nobody but he and Ramona: and even Ramona did not know the bitter\nwhole. She knew that Alessandro had no knife, and had gone forward with\nno hostile intent; but she knew nothing beyond that. Only the murderer\nhimself knew that the dialogue which he had reported to the judge and\njury, to justify his act, was an entire fabrication of his own, and\nthat, instead of it, had been spoken but four words by Alessandro, and\nthose were, \"Senor, I will explain;\" and that even after the first shot\nhad pierced his lungs, and the blood was choking in his throat, he had\nstill run a step or two farther, with his hand uplifted deprecatingly,\nand made one more effort to speak before he fell to the ground dead.\nCallous as Farrar was, and clear as it was in his mind that killing an\nIndian was no harm, he had not liked to recall the pleading anguish in\nAlessandro's tone and in his face as he fell. He had not liked to recall\nthis, even before he heard of this rich Mexican brother-in-law who\nhad appeared on the scene; and now, he found the memories still more\nunpleasant. Fear is a wonderful goad to remorse. There was another\nthing, too, which to his great wonder had been apparently overlooked by\neverybody; at least, nothing had been said about it; but the bearing of\nit on his case, if the case were brought up a second time and minutely\ninvestigated, would be most unfortunate. And this was, that the only\nclew he had to the fact of Alessandro's having taken his horse, was that\nthe poor, half-crazed fellow had left his own well-known gray pony in\nthe corral in place of the horse he took. A strange thing, surely, for a\nhorse-thief to do! Cold sweat burst out on Farrar's forehead, more\nthan once, as he realized how this, coupled with the well-known fact\nof Alessandro's liability to attacks of insanity, might be made to tell\nagainst him, if he should be brought to trial for the murder. He was\nas cowardly as he was cruel: never yet were the two traits separate\nin human nature; and after a few days of this torturing suspense and\napprehension, he suddenly resolved to leave the country, if not forever,\nat least for a few years, till this brother-in-law should be out of the\nway. He lost no time in carrying out his resolution; and it was well\nhe did not, for it was only three days after he had disappeared, that\nFelipe walked into Judge Wells's office, one morning, to make inquiries\nrelative to the preliminary hearing which had been held there in the\nmatter of the murder of the Indian, Alessandro Assis, by James Farrar.\nAnd when the judge, taking down his books, read to Felipe his notes of\nthe case, and went on to say, \"If Farrar's testimony is true, Ramona's,\nthe wife's, must be false,\" and \"at any rate, her testimony would not be\nworth a straw with any jury,\" Felipe sprang to his feet, and cried, \"She\nof whom you speak is my foster-sister; and, by God, Senor, if I can find\nthat man, I will shoot him as I would a dog! And I'll see, then, if a\nSan Diego County jury will hang me for ridding the country of such a\nbrute!\" and Felipe would have been as good as his word. It was a wise\nthing Farrar had done in making his escape.\n\nWhen Aunt Ri heard that Farrar had fled the country, she pushed up\nher spectacles and looked reflectively at her informant. It was young\nMerrill. \"Fled ther country, hez he?\" she said. \"Wall, he kin flee ez\nmany countries ez he likes, an' 't won't dew him no good. I know yeow\nfolks hyar don't seem ter think killin' an Injun's enny murder, but I\nsay 'tis; an' yeow'll all git it brung home ter yer afore yer die: ef\n'tain't brung one way, 't'll be anuther; yeow jest mind what I say, 'n'\ndon't yeow furgit it. Naow this miser'ble murderer, this Farrar, thet's\nlighted out er hyar, he's nothin' more'n a skunk, but he's got the Lawd\narter him, naow. It's jest's well he's gawn; I never did b'leeve in\nhangin'. I never could. It's jest tew men dead 'stead o' one. I don't\nwant to see no man hung, no marter what he's done, 'n' I don't want to\nsee no man shot down, nuther, no marter what he's done; 'n' this hyar\nFeeleepy, he's thet highstrung, he'd ha' shot thet Farrar, any minnit,\nquicker'n lightnin', ef he'd ketched him; so it's better all raound\nhe's lit aout. But I tell yeow, naow, he hain't made much by goin'! Thet\nInjun he murdered 'll foller him night 'n' day, till he dies, 'n' long\narter; he'll wish he wuz dead afore he doos die, I allow he will, naow.\nHe'll be jest like a man I knowed back in Tennessee. I wa'n't but a\nmite then, but I never forgot it. 'Tis a great country fur gourds, East\nTennessee is, whar I wuz raised; 'n' thar wuz two houses, 'n' a fence\nbetween 'em, 'n' these gourds a runnin' all over the fence; 'n' one o'\nther childun picked one o' them gourds, an' they fit abaout it; 'n' then\nthe women took it up,--ther childun's mothers, yer know,--'n' they got\nfightin' abaout it; 'n' then 't the last the men took it up, 'n' they\nfit; 'n' Rowell he got his butcher-knife, 'n' he ground it up, 'n' he\npicked a querril with Claiborne, 'n' he cut him inter pieces. They hed\nhim up for 't, 'n' somehow they clared him. I don't see how they ever\ndid, but they put 't off, 'n' put 't off, 'n' 't last they got him free;\n'n' he lived on thar a spell, but he couldn't stan' it; 'peared like\nhe never hed no peace; 'n' he came over ter our 'us, 'n' sed he,\n'Jake,'--they allers called daddy 'Jake,' or 'Uncle Jake,'--'Jake,' sed\nhe, 'I can't stan' it, livin' hyar.' 'Why,' sez daddy, 'the law o' the\ncountry's clar'd ye.' 'Yes,' sez he, 'but the law o' God hain't; 'n'\nI've got Claiborne allers with me. Thar ain't any path so narrer, but\nhe's a walkin' in it, by my side, all day; 'n' come night, I sleep with\nhim ter one side, 'n' my wife 't other; 'n' I can't stan' it.' Them's\nther very words I heered him say, 'n' I wuzn't ennythin' but a mite, but\nI didn't furgit it. Wall, sir, he went West, way aout hyar to Californy,\n'n' he couldn't stay thar nuther, 'n' he came back hum agin; 'n' I wuz\nbigger then, a gal grown, 'n' daddy sez to him,--I heern him,--'Wal,'\nsez he, 'did Claiborne foller yer?' 'Yes,' sez he, 'he follered me. I'll\nnever git shet o' him in this world. He's allers clost to me everywhar.'\nYer see, 'twas jest his conscience er whippin' him. Thet's all 't wuz.\n'T least, thet's all I think 't wuz; though thar wuz those thet said\n't wuz Claiborne's ghost. 'N' thet'll be the way 't 'll be with this\nmiser'ble Farrar. He'll live ter wish he'd let hisself be hanged er\nshot, er erry which way, ter git out er his misery.\"\n\nYoung Merrill listened with unwonted gravity to Aunt Ri's earnest words.\nThey reached a depth in his nature which had been long untouched; a\nstratum, so to speak, which lay far beneath the surface. The character\nof the Western frontiersman is often a singular accumulation of such\nstrata,--the training and beliefs of his earliest days overlain by\nsuccessions of unrelated and violent experiences, like geological\ndeposits. Underneath the exterior crust of the most hardened and\nruffianly nature often remains--its forms not yet quite fossilized--a\nrealm full of the devout customs, doctrines, religious influences, which\nthe boy knew, and the man remembers, By sudden upheaval, in some great\ncatastrophe or struggle in his mature life, these all come again into\nthe light. Assembly Catechism definitions, which he learned in his\nchildhood, and has not thought of since, ring in his ears, and he is\nthrown into all manner of confusions and inconsistencies of feeling and\nspeech by this clashing of the old and new man within him. It was much\nin this way that Aunt Ri's words smote upon young Merrill. He was not\nmany years removed from the sound of a preaching of the straitest New\nEngland Calvinism. The wild frontier life had drawn him in and under, as\nin a whirlpool; but he was New Englander yet at heart.\n\n\"That's so, Aunt Ri!\" he exclaimed. \"That's so! I don't s'pose a man\nthat's committed murder 'll ever have any peace in this world, nor in\nthe next nuther, without he repents; but ye see this horse-stealin'\nbusiness is different. 'Tain't murder to kill a hoss-thief, any way you\ncan fix it; everybody admits that. A feller that's caught horse-stealin'\nhad ought to be shot; and he will be, too, I tell you, in this country!\"\n\nA look of impatient despair spread over Aunt Ri's face. \"I hain't no\npatience left with yer,\" she said, \"er talkin' abaout stealin' hosses ez\nef hosses wuz more'n human bein's! But lettin' thet all go, this Injun,\nhe wuz crazy. Yer all knowed it. Thet Farrar knowed it. D'yer think ef\nhe'd ben stealin' the hoss, he'd er left his own hoss in the corral,\nsame ez, yer might say, leavin' his kyerd to say 't wuz he done it; 'n'\nthe hoss er tied in plain sight 'n front uv his house fur ennybody ter\nsee?\"\n\n\"Left his own horse, so he did!\" retorted Merrill. \"A poor, miserable,\nknock-kneed old pony, that wa'n't worth twenty dollars; 'n' Jim's horse\nwas worth two hundred, 'n' cheap at that.\"\n\n\"Thet ain't nuther here nor thar in what we air sayin',\" persisted Aunt\nRi. \"I ain't a speakin' on 't ez a swap er hosses. What I say is, he\nwa'n't tryin' to cover 't up thet he'd tuk the hoss. We air sum used ter\nhoss-thieves in Tennessee; but I never heered o' one yit thet left\nhis name fur a refference berhind him, ter show which road he tuk, 'n'\nfastened ther stolen critter ter his front gate when he got hum! I allow\nme 'n' yeow hedn't better say anythin' much more on ther subjeck, fur I\nallow we air bound to querril ef we dew;\" and nothing that Merrill said\ncould draw another word out of Aunt Ri in regard to Alessandro's death.\nBut there was another subject on which she was tireless, and her speech\neloquent. It was the kindness and goodness of the Cahuilla people. The\nlast vestige of her prejudice against Indians had melted and gone, in\nthe presence of their simple-hearted friendliness. \"I'll never hear a\nword said agin 'em, never, ter my longest day,\" she said. \"The way the\npore things hed jest stripped theirselves, to git things fur Ramony,\nbeat all ever I see among white folks, 'n' I've ben raound more'n most.\n'N' they wa'n't lookin' fur no pay, nuther; fur they didn't know, till\nFeeleepy 'n' me cum, thet she had any folks ennywhar, 'n' they'd ha'\ntaken care on her till she died, jest the same. The sick allers ez took\ncare on among them, they sed, 's long uz enny on em hez got a thing\nleft. Thet's ther way they air raised; I allow white folks might take a\nlesson on 'em, in thet; 'n' in heaps uv other things tew. Oh, I'm done\ntalkin' again Injuns, naow, don't yeow furgit it! But I know, fur all\nthet, 't won't make any difference; 'pears like there cuddn't nobody\nb'leeve ennythin' 'n this world 'thout seein' 't theirselves. I wuz thet\nway tew; I allow I hain't got no call ter talk; but I jest wish the hull\nworld could see what I've seen! Thet's all!\"\n\nIt was a sad day in the village when Ramona and her friends departed.\nHeartily as the kindly people rejoiced in her having found such a\nprotector for herself and her child, and deeply as they felt Felipe's\nand Aunt Ri's good-will and gratitude towards them, they were yet\nconscious of a loss,--of a void. The gulf between them and the rest of\nthe world seemed defined anew, their sense of isolation deepened, their\nhopeless poverty emphasized. Ramona, wife of Alessandro, had been as\ntheir sister,--one of them; as such, she would have had share in all\ntheir life had to offer. But its utmost was nothing, was but hardship\nand deprivation; and she was being borne away from it, like one rescued,\nnot so much from death, as from a life worse than death.\n\nThe tears streamed down Ramona's face as she bade them farewell. She\nembraced again and again the young mother who had for so many days\nsuckled her child, even, it was said, depriving her own hardier babe\nthat Ramona's should not suffer. \"Sister, you have given me my child,\"\nshe cried; \"I can never thank you; I will pray for you all my life.\"\n\nShe made no inquiries as to Felipe's plans. Unquestioningly, like a\nlittle child, she resigned herself into his hands. A power greater than\nhers was ordering her way; Felipe was its instrument. No other voice\nspoke to guide her. The same old simplicity of acceptance which had\ncharacterized her daily life in her girlhood, and kept her serene\nand sunny then,--serene under trials, sunny in her routine of little\nduties,--had kept her serene through all the afflictions, and calm,\nif not sunny, under all the burdens of her later life; and it did not\ndesert her even now.\n\nAunt Ri gazed at her with a sentiment as near to veneration as her dry,\nhumorous, practical nature was capable of feeling. \"I allow I donno but\nI sh'd cum ter believin' in saints tew,\" she said, \"ef I wuz ter live\n'long side er thet gal. 'Pears like she wuz suthin' more 'n human. 'T\nbeats me plum out, ther way she takes her troubles. Thar's sum would\nsay she hedn't no feelin'; but I allow she hez more 'n most folks. I kin\nsee, 'tain't thet. I allow I didn't never expect ter think 's well uv\nprayin' to picters, 'n' strings er beads, 'n' sech; but ef 't 's thet\nkeeps her up ther way she's kept up, I allow thar's more in it 'n\nit's hed credit fur. I ain't gwine ter say enny more agin it' nor agin\nInjuns. 'Pears like I'm gittin' heaps er new idears inter my head, these\ndays. I'll turn Injun, mebbe, afore I git through!\"\n\nThe farewell to Aunt Ri was hardest of all. Ramona clung to her as to a\nmother. At times she felt that she would rather stay by her side than go\nhome with Felipe; then she reproached herself for the thought, as for a\ntreason and ingratitude. Felipe saw the feeling, and did not wonder at\nit. \"Dear girl,\" he thought; \"it is the nearest she has ever come to\nknowing what a mother's love is like!\" And he lingered in San Bernardino\nweek after week, on the pretence that Ramona was not yet strong enough\nto bear the journey home, when in reality his sole motive for staying\nwas his reluctance to deprive her of Aunt Ri's wholesome and cheering\ncompanionship.\n\nAunt Ri was busily at work on a rag carpet for the Indian Agent's wife.\nShe had just begun it, had woven only a few inches, on that dreadful\nmorning when the news of Alessandro's death reached her. It was of her\nfavorite pattern, the \"hit-er-miss\" pattern, as she called it; no set\nstripes or regular alternation of colors, but ball after ball of the\nindiscriminately mixed tints, woven back and forth, on a warp of a\nsingle color. The constant variety in it, the unexpectedly harmonious\nblending of the colors, gave her delight, and afforded her a subject,\ntoo, of not unphilosophical reflection.\n\n\"Wall,\" she said, \"it's called ther 'hit-er-miss' pattren; but it's\n'hit' oftener'n 'tis 'miss.' Thar ain't enny accountin' fur ther way\nther breadths'll come, sometimes; 'pears like 't wuz kind er magic, when\nthey air sewed tergether; 'n' I allow thet's ther way it's gwine ter\nbe with heaps er things in this life. It's jest a kind er 'hit-er-miss'\npattren we air all on us livin' on; 'tain't much use tryin' ter reckon\nhow 't 'll come aout; but the breadths doos fit heaps better 'n yer'd\nthink; come ter sew 'em, 'tain't never no sech colors ez yer thought\n't wuz gwine ter be; but it's allers pooty, allers; never see a\n'hit-er-miss' pattren 'n my life yit, thet wa'n't pooty. 'N' ther wa'n't\nnever nobody fetched me rags, 'n' hed 'em all planned aout, 'n' jest\nther way they wanted ther warp, 'n' jest haow ther stripes wuz ter come,\n'n' all, thet they wa'n't orful diserpynted when they cum ter see 't\ndone. It don't never look's they thought 't would, never! I larned thet\nlesson airly; 'n' I allers make 'em write aout on a paper, jest ther\nwedth er every stripe, 'n' each er ther colors, so's they kin see it's\nwhat they ordered; 'r else they'd allers say I hedn't wove 't's I wuz\ntold ter. I got ketched thet way oncet! I allow ennybody's a bawn fool\ngits ketched twice runnin' ther same way. But fur me, I'll take ther\n'hit-er-miss' pattren, every time, sir, straight along.\"\n\nWhen the carpet was done, Aunt Ri took the roll in her own independent\narms, and strode with it to the Agent's house. She had been biding the\ntime when she should have this excuse for going there. Her mind was\nburdened with questions she wished to ask, information she wished to\ngive, and she chose an hour when she knew she would find the Agent\nhimself at home.\n\n\"I allow yer heered why I wuz behind time with this yere carpet,\" she\nsaid; \"I wuz up ter San Jacinto Mounting, where thet Injun wuz murdered.\nWe brung his widder 'n' ther baby daown with us, me 'n' her brother.\nHe's tuk her home ter his house ter live. He's reel well off.\"\n\nYes, the Agent had heard this; he had wondered why the widow did not\ncome to see him; he had expected to hear from her.\n\n\"Wall, I did hent ter her thet p'raps yer could dew something, ef she\nwuz ter tell yer all abaout it; but she allowed thar wa'n't enny use in\ntalkin'. Ther jedge, he sed her witnessin' wouldn't be wuth nuthin' to\nno jury; 'n' thet wuz what I wuz a wantin' to ask yeow, ef thet wuz so.\"\n\n\"Yes, that is what the lawyers here told me,\" said the Agent. \"I was\ngoing to have the man arrested, but they said it would be folly to bring\nthe case to trial. The woman's testimony would not be believed.\"\n\n\"Yeow've got power ter git a man punished fur sellin' whiskey to Injuns,\nI notice,\" broke in Aunt Ri; \"hain't yer? I see yeour man 'n' the\nmarshal here arrestin' 'em pooty lively last month; they sed 'twas yeour\ndoin'; yeow was a gwine ter prossacute every livin' son o' hell--them\nwuz thar words--thet sold whiskey ter Injuns.\"\n\n\"That's so!\" said the Agent. \"So I am; I am determined to break up this\nvile business of selling whiskey to Indians. It is no use trying to do\nanything for them while they are made drunk in this way; it's a sin and\na shame.\"\n\n\"Thet's so, I allow ter yeow,\" said Aunt Ri. \"Thar ain't any gainsayin'\nthet. But ef yeow've got power ter git a man put in jail fur sellin'\nwhiskey 't 'n Injun, 'n' hain't got power to git him punished ef he goes\n'n' kills thet Injun, 't sems ter me thar's suthin' cur'us abaout thet.\"\n\n\"That is just the trouble in my position here, Aunt Ri,\" he said. \"I\nhave no real power over my Indians, as I ought to have.\"\n\n\"What makes yer call 'em yeour Injuns?\" broke in Aunt Ri.\n\nThe Agent colored. Aunt Ri was a privileged character, but her logical\nmethod of questioning was inconvenient.\n\n\"I only mean that they are under my charge,\" he said. \"I don't mean that\nthey belong to me in any way.\"\n\n\"Wall, I allow not,\" retorted Aunt Ri, \"enny more 'n I dew. They air\nairnin' their livin', sech 's 'tis, ef yer kin call it a livin'. I've\nbeen 'mongst 'em, naow, they hyar last tew weeks, 'n' I allow I've had\nmy eyes opened ter some things. What's thet docter er yourn, him thet\nthey call the Agency doctor,--what's he got ter do?\"\n\n\"To attend to the Indians of this Agency when they are sick,\" replied\nthe Agent, promptly.\n\n\"Wall, thet's what I heern; thet's what yeow sed afore, 'n' thet's why\nAlessandro, the Injun thet wuz murdered,--thet's why he put his name\ndown 'n yeour books, though 't went agin him orful ter do it. He wuz\nhigh-spereted, 'n' 'd allers took keer er hisself; but he'd ben druv out\ner fust one place 'n' then another, tell he'd got clar down, 'n' pore;\n'n' he jest begged thet doctor er yourn to go to see his little gal, 'n'\nthe docter wouldn't; 'n' more'n thet, he laughed at him fur askin.' 'N'\nthey set the little thing on the hoss ter bring her here, 'n' she died\nafore they'd come a mile with her; 'n' 't wuz thet, on top er all the\nrest druv Alessandro crazy. He never hed none er them wandrin' spells\ntill arter thet. Naow I allow thet wa'n't right eh thet docter. I\nwouldn't hev no sech docter's thet raound my Agency, ef I wuz yeow.\nPr'aps yer never heered uv thet. I told Ramony I didn't bleeve yer\nknowed it, or ye'd hev made him go.\"\n\n\"No, Aunt Ri,\" said the Agent; \"I could not have done that; he is only\nrequired to doctor such Indians as come here.\"\n\n\"I allow, then, thar ain't any gret use en hevin' him at all,\" said Aunt\nRi; \"'pears like thar ain't more'n a harndful uv Injuns raound here. I\nexpect he gits well paid?\" and she paused for an answer. None came. The\nAgent did not feel himself obliged to reveal to Aunt Ri what salary\nthe Government paid the San Bernardino doctor for sending haphazard\nprescriptions to Indians he never saw.\n\nAfter a pause Aunt Ri resumed: \"Ef it ain't enny offence ter yeow, I\nallow I'd like ter know jest what 'tis yeow air here ter dew fur these\nInjuns. I've got my feelin's considdable stirred up, bein' among 'em\n'n' knowing this hyar one, thet's ben murdered. Hev ye got enny power to\ngiv' 'em ennything,--food or sech? They air powerful pore, most on 'em.\"\n\n\"I have had a little fund for buying supplies for them in times\nof special suffering;\" replied the Agent, \"a very little; and the\nDepartment has appropriated some money for wagons and ploughs; not\nenough, however, to supply every village; you see these Indians are in\nthe main self-supporting.\"\n\n\"Thet's jest it,\" persisted Aunt Ri. \"Thet's what I've ben seein'; 'n'\nthet's why I want so bad ter git at what 'tis the Guvvermunt means ter\nhev yeow dew fur 'em. I allow ef yeow ain't ter feed 'em, an' ef yer\ncan't put folks inter jail fur robbin' 'n' cheatin' 'em, not ter say\nkillin' 'em,--ef yer can't dew ennythin' more 'n keep 'em from gettin'\nwhiskey, wall, I'm free ter say--\" Aunt Ri paused; she did not wish to\nseem to reflect on the Agent's usefulness, and so concluded her sentence\nvery differently from her first impulse,--\"I'm free ter say I shouldn't\nlike ter stan' in yer shoes.\"\n\n\"You may very well say that, Aunt Ri,\" laughed the Agent, complacently.\n\"It is the most troublesome Agency in the whole list, and the least\nsatisfactory.\"\n\n\"Wall, I allow it mought be the least satisfyin',\" rejoined the\nindefatigable Aunt Ri; \"but I donno whar the trouble comes in, ef so\nbe's thar's no more kin be done than yer wuz er tellin'.\" And she looked\nhonestly puzzled.\n\n\"Look there, Aunt Ri!\" said he, triumphantly, pointing to a pile of\nbooks and papers. \"All those to be gone through with, and a report to be\nmade out every month, and a voucher to be sent for every lead-pencil I\nbuy. I tell you I work harder than I ever did in my life before, and for\nless pay.\"\n\n\"I allow yer hev hed easy times afore, then,\" retorted Aunt Ri,\ngood-naturedly satirical, \"ef yeow air plum tired doin' thet!\" And she\ntook her leave, not a whit clearer in her mind as to the real nature and\nfunction of the Indian Agency than she was in the beginning.\n\nThrough all of Ramona's journey home she seemed to herself to be in a\ndream. Her baby in her arms; the faithful creatures, Baba and Benito,\ngayly trotting along at a pace so swift that the carriage seemed\ngliding; Felipe by her side,--the dear Felipe,--his eyes wearing the\nsame bright and loving look as of old,--what strange thing was it which\nhad happened to her to make it all seem unreal? Even the little one\nin her arms,--she too, seemed unreal! Ramona did not know it, but\nher nerves were still partially paralyzed. Nature sends merciful\nanaesthetics in the shocks which almost kill us. In the very sharpness\nof the blow sometimes lies its own first healing. It would be long\nbefore Ramona would fully realize that Alessandro was dead. Her worst\nanguish was yet to come.\n\nFelipe did not know and could not have understood this; and it was with\na marvelling gratitude that he saw Ramona, day after day, placid,\nalways ready with a smile when he spoke to her. Her gratitude for each\nthoughtfulness of his smote him like a reproach; all the more that he\nknew her gentle heart had never held a thought of reproach in it towards\nhim. \"Grateful to me!\" he thought. \"To me, who might have spared her all\nthis woe if I had been strong!\"\n\nNever would Felipe forgive himself,--no, not to the day of his death.\nHis whole life should be devoted to her and her child; but what a\npitiful thing was that to render!\n\nAs they drew near home, he saw Ramona often try to conceal from him that\nshe had shed tears. At last he said to her: \"Dearest Ramona, do not fear\nto weep before me. I would not be any constraint on you. It is better\nfor you to let the tears come freely, my sister. They are healing to\nwounds.\"\n\n\"I do not think so, Felipe,\" replied Ramona. \"Tears are only selfish and\nweak. They are like a cry because we are hurt. It is not possible always\nto keep them back; but I am ashamed when I have wept, and think also\nthat I have sinned, because I have given a sad sight to others. Father\nSalvierderra always said that it was a duty to look happy, no matter how\nmuch we might be suffering.\"\n\n\"That is more than human power can do!\" said Felipe.\n\n\"I think not,\" replied Ramona. \"If it were, Father Salvierderra would\nnot have commanded it. And do you not recollect, Felipe, what a smile\nhis face always wore? and his heart had been broken for many, many years\nbefore he died. Alone, in the night, when he prayed, he used to weep,\nfrom the great wrestling he had with God, he told me; but we never\nsaw him except with a smile. When one thinks in the wilderness, alone,\nFelipe, many things become clear. I have been learning, all these years\nin the wilderness, as if I had had a teacher. Sometimes I almost thought\nthat the spirit of Father Salvierderra was by my side putting thoughts\ninto my mind. I hope I can tell them to my child when she is old enough.\nShe will understand them quicker than I did, for she has Alessandro's\nsoul; you can see that by her eyes. And all these things of which I\nspeak were in his heart from his childhood. They belong to the air and\nthe sky and the sun, and all trees know them.\"\n\nWhen Ramona spoke thus of Alessandro, Felipe marvelled in silence. He\nhimself had been afraid to mention Alessandro's name; but Ramona spoke\nit as if he were yet by her side. Felipe could not fathom this. There\nwere to be many things yet which Felipe could not fathom in this lovely,\nsorrowing, sunny sister of his.\n\nWhen they reached the house, the servants, who had been on the watch\nfor days, were all gathered in the court-yard, old Marda and Juan Can\nheading the group; only two absent,--Margarita and Luigo. They had been\nmarried some months before, and were living at the Ortegas ranch, where\nLuigo, to Juan Can's scornful amusement, had been made head shepherd.\n\nOn all sides were beaming faces, smiles, and glad cries of greeting.\nUnderneath these were affectionate hearts quaking with fear lest the\nhome-coming be but a sad one after all. Vaguely they knew a little of\nwhat their dear Senorita had been through since she left them; it seemed\nthat she must be sadly altered by so much sorrow, and that it would\nbe terrible to her to come back to the place so full of painful\nassociations. \"And the Senora gone, too,\" said one of the outdoor hands,\nas they were talking it over; \"it's not the same place at all that it\nwas when the Senora was here.\"\n\n\"Humph!\" muttered Juan Can, more consequential and overbearing than\never, for this year of absolute control of the estate. \"Humph! that's\nall you know. A good thing the Senora died when she did, I can tell you!\nWe'd never have seen the Senorita back here else; I can tell you that,\nmy man! And for my part, I'd much rather be under Senor Felipe and the\nSenorita than under the Senora, peace to her ashes! She had her day.\nThey can have theirs now.\"\n\nWhen these loving and excited retainers saw Ramona--pale, but with her\nown old smile on her face--coming towards them with her babe in her\narms, they broke into wild cheering, and there was not a dry eye in the\ngroup.\n\nSingling out old Marda by a glance, Ramona held out the baby towards\nher, and said in her old gentle, affectionate voice, \"I am sure you will\nlove my baby, Marda!\"\n\n\"Senorita! Senorita! God bless you, Senorita!\" they cried; and closed\nup their ranks around the baby, touching her, praising her, handing her\nfrom one to another.\n\nRamona stood for a few seconds watching them; then she said, \"Give her\nto me, Marda. I will myself carry her into the house;\" and she moved\ntoward the inner door.\n\n\"This way, dear; this way,\" cried Felipe. \"It is Father Salvierderra's\nroom I ordered to be prepared for you, because it is so sunny for the\nbaby!\"\n\n\"Thanks, kind Felipe!\" cried Ramona, and her eyes said more than her\nwords. She knew he had divined the one thing she had most dreaded in\nreturning,--the crossing again the threshold of her own room. It would\nbe long now before she would enter that room. Perhaps she would never\nenter it. How tender and wise of Felipe!\n\nYes; Felipe was both tender and wise, now. How long would the wisdom\nhold the tenderness in leash, as he day after day looked upon the face\nof this beautiful woman,--so much more beautiful now than she had been\nbefore her marriage, that Felipe sometimes, as he gazed at her, thought\nher changed even in feature? But in this very change lay a spell which\nwould for a long time surround her, and set her as apart from lover's\nthoughts as if she were guarded by a cordon of viewless spirits. There\nwas a rapt look of holy communion on her face, which made itself felt by\nthe dullest perception, and sometimes overawed even where it attracted.\nIt was the same thing which Aunt Ri had felt, and formulated in her own\nhumorous fashion. But old Marda put it better, when, one day, in reply\nto a half-terrified, low-whispered suggestion of Juan Can, to the effect\nthat it was \"a great pity that Senor Felipe hadn't married the Senorita\nyears ago,--what if he were to do it yet?\" she said, also under her\nbreath. \"It is my opinion he'd as soon think of Saint Catharine herself!\nNot but that it would be a great thing if it could be!\"\n\nAnd now the thing that the Senora had imagined to herself so often\nhad come about,--the presence of a little child in her house, on the\nveranda, in the garden, everywhere; the sunny, joyous, blest presence.\nBut how differently had it come! Not Felipe's child, as she proudly\nhad pictured, but the child of Ramona: the friendless, banished\nRamona returned now into full honor and peace as the daughter of the\nhouse,--Ramona, widow of Alessandro. If the child had been Felipe's own,\nhe could not have felt for it a greater love. From the first, the little\nthing had clung to him as only second to her mother. She slept hours in\nhis arms, one little hand hid in his dark beard, close to his lips,\nand kissed again and again when no one saw. Next to Ramona herself in\nFelipe's heart came Ramona's child; and on the child he could lavish the\nfondness he felt that he could never dare to show to the mother, Month\nby month it grew clearer to Felipe that the mainsprings of Ramona's\nlife were no longer of this earth; that she walked as one in constant\nfellowship with one unseen. Her frequent and calm mention of Alessandro\ndid not deceive him. It did not mean a lessening grief: it meant an\nunchanged relation.\n\nOne thing weighed heavily on Felipe's mind,--the concealed treasure. A\nsense of humiliation withheld him, day after day, from speaking of\nit. But he could have no peace until Ramona knew it. Each hour that he\ndelayed the revelation he felt himself almost as guilty as he had held\nhis mother to be. At last he spoke. He had not said many words, before\nRamona interrupted him. \"Oh, yes!\" she said. \"I knew about those things;\nyour mother told me. When we were in such trouble, I used to wish\nsometimes we could have had a few of the jewels. But they were all given\nto the Church. That was what the Senora Ortegna said must be done with\nthem if I married against your mother's wishes.\"\n\nIt was with a shame-stricken voice that Felipe replied: \"Dear Ramona,\nthey were not given to the Church. You know Father Salvierderra died;\nand I suppose my mother did not know what to do with them. She told me\nabout them just as she was dying.\"\n\n\"But why did you not give them to the Church, dear?\" asked Ramona,\nsimply.\n\n\"Why?\" cried Felipe. \"Because I hold them to be yours, and yours only.\nI would never have given them to the Church, until I had sure proof that\nyou were dead and had left no children.\"\n\nRamona's eyes were fixed earnestly on Felipe's face. \"You have not read\nthe Senora Ortegna's letter?\" she said.\n\n\"Yes, I have,\" he replied, \"every word of it.\"\n\n\"But that said I was not to have any of the things if I married against\nthe Senora Moreno's will.\"\n\nFelipe groaned. Had his mother lied? \"No, dear,\" he said, \"that was not\nthe word. It was, if you married unworthily.\"\n\nRamona reflected. \"I never recollected the words,\" she said. \"I was\ntoo frightened; but I thought that was what it meant. I did not marry\nunworthily. Do you feel sure, Felipe, that it would be honest for me to\ntake them for my child?\"\n\n\"Perfectly,\" said Felipe.\n\n\"Do you think Father Salvierderra would say I ought to keep them?\"\n\n\"I am sure of it, dear.\"\n\n\"I will think about it, Felipe. I cannot decide hastily. Your mother did\nnot think I had any right to them, if I married Alessandro. That was\nwhy she showed them to me. I never knew of them till then. I took one\nthing,--a handkerchief of my father's. I was very glad to have it;\nbut it got lost when we went from San Pasquale. Alessandro rode back a\nhalf-day's journey to find it for me; but it had blown away. I grieved\nsorely for it.\"\n\nThe next day Ramona said to Felipe: \"Dear Felipe, I have thought it all\nover about those jewels. I believe it will be right for my daughter to\nhave them. Can there be some kind of a paper written for me to sign, to\nsay that if she dies they are all to be given to the Church,--to Father\nSalvierderra's College, in Santa Barbara? That is where I would rather\nhave them go.\"\n\n\"Yes, dear,\" said Felipe; \"and then we will put them in some safer\nplace. I will take them to Los Angeles when I go. It is wonderful no one\nhas stolen them all these years!\"\n\nAnd so a second time the Ortegna jewels were passed on, by a written\nbequest, into the keeping of that mysterious, certain, uncertain thing\nwe call the future, and delude our selves with the fancy that we\ncan have much to do with its shaping.\n\n          *****\n\nLife ran smoothly in the Moreno household,--smoothly to the eye. Nothing\ncould be more peaceful, fairer to see, than the routine of its days,\nwith the simple pleasures, light tasks, and easy diligence of all.\nSummer and winter were alike sunny, and had each its own joys. There was\nnot an antagonistic or jarring element; and, flitting back and forth,\nfrom veranda to veranda, garden to garden, room to room, equally at\nhome and equally welcome everywhere, there went perpetually, running,\nfrisking, laughing, rejoicing, the little child that had so strangely\ndrifted into this happy shelter,--the little Ramona. As unconscious of\naught sad or fateful in her destiny as the blossoms with which it was\nher delight to play, she sometimes seemed to her mother to have been\nfrom the first in some mysterious way disconnected from it, removed, set\nfree from all that could ever by any possibility link her to sorrow.\n\nRamona herself bore no impress of sorrow; rather her face had now an\nadded radiance. There had been a period, soon after her return, when\nshe felt that she for the first time waked to the realization of her\nbereavement; when every sight, sound, and place seemed to cry out,\nmocking her with the name and the memory of Alessandro. But she wrestled\nwith this absorbing grief as with a sin; setting her will steadfastly\nto the purposes of each day's duty, and, most of all, to the duty of\njoyfulness. She repeated to herself Father Salvierderra's sayings, till\nshe more than knew them by heart; and she spent long hours of the night\nin prayer, as it had been his wont to do.\n\nNo one but Felipe dreamed of these vigils and wrestlings. He knew them;\nand he knew, too, when they ceased, and the new light of a new\nvictory diffused itself over Ramona's face: but neither did the first\ndishearten, nor the latter encourage him. Felipe was a clearer-sighted\nlover now than he had been in his earlier youth. He knew that into the\nworld where Ramona really lived he did not so much as enter; yet her\nevery act, word, look, was full of loving thoughtfulness of and for\nhim, loving happiness in his companionship. And while this was so, all\nFelipe's unrest could not make him unhappy.\n\nThere were other causes entering into this unrest besides his yearning\ndesire to win Ramona for his wife. Year by year the conditions of life\nin California were growing more distasteful to him. The methods, aims,\nstandards of the fast incoming Americans were to him odious. Their\nboasted successes, the crowding of colonies, schemes of settlement and\ndevelopment,--all were disagreeable and irritating. The passion for\nmoney and reckless spending of it, the great fortunes made in one hour,\nthrown away in another, savored to Felipe's mind more of brigandage and\ngambling than of the occupations of gentlemen. He loathed them. Life\nunder the new government grew more and more intolerable to him; both his\nhereditary instincts and prejudices, and his temperament, revolted.\nHe found himself more and more alone in the country. Even the Spanish\ntongue was less and less spoken. He was beginning to yearn for\nMexico,--for Mexico, which he had never seen, yet yearned for like an\nexile. There he might yet live among men of his own race and degree,\nand of congenial beliefs and occupations. Whenever he thought of this\nchange, always came the quick memory of Ramona. Would she be willing\nto go? Could it be that she felt a bond to this land, in which she had\nknown nothing but sufferings.\n\nAt last he asked her. To his unutterable surprise, Ramona cried:\n\"Felipe! The saints be praised! I should never have told you. I did not\nthink that you could wish to leave this estate. But my most beautiful\ndream for Ramona would be, that she should grow up in Mexico.\"\n\nAnd as she spoke, Felipe understood by a lightning intuition, and\nwondered that he had not foreknown it, that she would spare her daughter\nthe burden she had gladly, heroically borne herself, in the bond of\nrace.\n\nThe question was settled. With gladness of heart almost more than he\ncould have believed possible, Felipe at once communicated with some rich\nAmerican proprietors who had desired to buy the Moreno estate. Land in\nthe valley had so greatly advanced in value, that the sum he received\nfor it was larger than he had dared to hope; was ample for the\nrealization of all his plans for the new life in Mexico. From the hour\nthat this was determined, and the time for their sailing fixed, a new\nexpression came into Ramona's face. Her imagination was kindled. An\nuntried future beckoned,--a future which she would embrace and conquer\nfor her daughter. Felipe saw the look, felt the change, and for the\nfirst time hoped. It would be a new world, a new life; why not a new\nlove? She could not always be blind to his devotion; and when she saw\nit, could she refuse to reward it? He would be very patient, and wait\nlong, he thought. Surely, since he had been patient so long without\nhope, he could be still more patient now that hope had dawned! But\npatience is not hope's province in breasts of lovers. From the day when\nFelipe first thought to himself, \"She will yet be mine,\" it grew harder,\nand not easier, for him to refrain from pouring out his love in words.\nHer tender sisterliness, which had been such balm and comfort to him,\ngrew at times intolerable; and again and again her gentle spirit\nwas deeply disquieted with the fear that she had displeased him, so\nstrangely did he conduct himself.\n\nHe had resolved that nothing should tempt him to disclose to her his\npassion and its dreams, until they had reached their new home. But there\ncame a moment which mastered him, and he spoke.\n\nIt was in Monterey. They were to sail on the morrow; and had been on\nboard the ship to complete the last arrangements. They were rowed back\nto shore in a little boat. A full moon shone. Ramona sat bareheaded in\nthe end of the boat, and the silver radiance from the water seemed to\nfloat up around her, and invest her as with a myriad halos. Felipe gazed\nat her till his senses swam; and when, on stepping from the boat, she\nput her hand in his, and said, as she had said hundreds of times before,\n\"Dear Felipe, how good you are!\" he clasped her hands wildly, and cried,\n\"Ramona, my love! Oh, can you not love me?\"\n\nThe moonlight was bright as day. They were alone on the shore. Ramona\ngazed at him for one second, in surprise. Only for a second; then she\nknew all. \"Felipe! My brother!\" she cried, and stretched out her hands\nas if in warning.\n\n\"No! I am not your brother!\" he cried. \"I will not be your brother! I\nwould rather die!\"\n\n\"Felipe!\" cried Ramona again. This time her voice recalled him to\nhimself. It was a voice of terror and of pain.\n\n\"Forgive me, my sweet one!\" he exclaimed. \"I will never say it again.\nBut I have loved you so long--so long!\"\n\nRamona's head had fallen forward on her breast, her eyes fixed on the\nshining sands; the waves rose and fell, rose and fell, at her feet\ngently as sighs. A great revelation had come to Ramona. In this supreme\nmoment of Felipe's abandonment of all disguises, she saw his whole\npast life in a new light. Remorse smote her. \"Dear Felipe,\" she said,\nclasping her hands, \"I have been very selfish. I did not know--\"\n\n\"Of course you did not, love,\" said Felipe. \"How could you? But I have\nnever loved any one else. I have always loved you. Can you not learn to\nlove me? I did not mean to tell you for a long time yet. But now I have\nspoken; I cannot hide it any more.\"\n\nRamona drew nearer to him, still with her hands clasped. \"I have always\nloved you,\" she said. \"I love no other living man; but, Felipe,\"--her\nvoice sank to a solemn whisper,--\"do you not know, Felipe, that part of\nme is dead,--dead? can never live again? You could not want me for your\nwife, Felipe, when part of me is dead!\"\n\nFelipe threw his arms around her. He was beside himself with joy. \"You\nwould not say that if you did not think you could be my wife,\" he cried.\n\"Only give yourself to me, my love, I care not whether you call yourself\ndead or alive!\"\n\nRamona stood quietly in his arms. Ah, well for Felipe that he did not\nknow, never could know, the Ramona that Alessandro had known. This\ngentle, faithful, grateful Ramona, asking herself fervently now if she\nwould do her brother a wrong, yielding up to him what seemed to her only\nthe broken fragment of a life; weighing his words, not in the light of\npassion, but of calmest, most unselfish action,--ah, how unlike was she\nto that Ramona who flung herself on Alessandro's breast, crying, \"Take\nme with you! I would rather die than have you leave me!\"\n\nRamona had spoken truth. Part of her was dead. But Ramona saw now, with\ninfallible intuition, that even as she had loved Alessandro, so Felipe\nloved her. Could she refuse to give Felipe happiness, when he had saved\nher, saved her child? What else now remained for them, these words\nhaving been spoken? \"I will be your wife, dear Felipe,\" she said,\nspeaking solemnly, slowly, \"if you are sure it will make you happy, and\nif you think it is right.\"\n\n\"Right!\" ejaculated Felipe, mad with the joy unlooked for so soon.\n\"Nothing else would be right! My Ramona, I will love you so, you will\nforget you ever said that part of you was dead!\"\n\nA strange look which startled Felipe swept across Ramona's face; it\nmight have been a moonbeam. It passed. Felipe never saw it again.\n\nGeneral Moreno's name was still held in warm remembrance in the city of\nMexico, and Felipe found himself at once among friends. On the day after\ntheir arrival he and Ramona were married in the cathedral, old Marda\nand Juan Can, with his crutches, kneeling in proud joy behind them.\nThe story of the romance of their lives, being widely rumored, greatly\nenhanced the interest with which they were welcomed. The beautiful young\nSenora Moreno was the theme of the city; and Felipe's bosom thrilled\nwith pride to see the gentle dignity of demeanor by which she was\ndistinguished in all assemblages. It was indeed a new world, a new life.\nRamona might well doubt her own identity. But undying memories stood\nlike sentinels in her breast. When the notes of doves, calling to each\nother, fell on her ear, her eyes sought the sky, and she heard a voice\nsaying, \"Majella!\" This was the only secret her loyal, loving heart had\nkept from Felipe. A loyal, loving heart indeed it was,--loyal, loving,\nserene. Few husbands so blest as the Senor Felipe Moreno.\n\nSons and daughters came to bear his name. The daughters were all\nbeautiful; but the most beautiful of them all, and, it was said, the\nmost beloved by both father and mother, was the eldest one: the one\nwho bore the mother's name, and was only step-daughter to the\nSenor,--Ramona,--Ramona, daughter of Alessandro the Indian.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Ramona, by Helen Hunt Jackson\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK RAMONA ***\n\n***** This file should be named 2802.txt or 2802.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/2\/8\/0\/2802\/\n\nProduced by David Reed\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http:\/\/www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http:\/\/pglaf.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":976,"split":"train"}
