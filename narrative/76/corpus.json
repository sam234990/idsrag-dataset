Crawfurd grows up in Kirkcaple, by the North Sea, where he first encounters the antagonist, Laputa, performing a ritual on the beach. Crawfurd's father dies, and he goes to work as a shopkeeper in a place called Blaauwildebeestefontein.\nCrawfurd comes into contact with a Portuguese man, Henriques, and again with Laputa, and he gradually learns of illegal diamond smuggling and of a planned rising of the native people of the region, including the Zulu people and the Swazi people, led by Laputa. Laputa's skill as a preacher allows him to inspire many tribes across the region to follow him, and he invokes the legend of Prester John and positions himself as the rightful heir and leader who can rise up against colonial rule. Crawfurd learns more about this after meeting Captain Arcoll, who leads the colonialist army and police.\nUsing information learnt from having overheard the conversation of Laputa and Henriques, Crawfurd infiltrates the cave where the tribal leaders are gathering and witnesses Laputa commencing the rising, wearing the necklet of Prester John, which legitimises his leadership. Crawfurd is captured, but having managed to relay a message to Captain Arcoll, escapes during an ambush and steals the necklet from the hands of Henriques, who is trying to steal it for himself. After running all night, Crawfurd is climbing a ravine in the escarpment up to the plateau above the berg when he is captured again. But he manages first to hide the necklet, which is made of priceless rubies.\nAfter being taken to Laputa's new base, Crawfurd escapes immediate punishment by offering Laputa his knowledge of the location of the necklet in exchange for sparing his life. Laputa, who needs the necklet in order to convince his followers, but has not told anyone of its loss, goes alone with Crawfurd to search for the necklet. In the ravine, Crawfurd narrowly escapes once again and steals Laputa's horse to take him to Arcoll's headquarters.\nWith Laputa separated from his army, Arcoll's forces are able to quell the leaderless uprising. Meanwhile, Crawfurd returns to the cave, where he finds the treacherous Henriques dead outside, having been strangled by Laputa. Entering the cave, Crawfurd meets Laputa, who by now knows that all his plans have failed. Laputa destroys a rock bridge giving access to the cave, and then commits suicide by jumping into an underground river chasm.\nCrawfurd makes a daring escape by climbing a cascade up and out of the cave. He rejoins Arcoll and is instrumental in bringing about the disarmament of the native uprising and the subsequent peace. With Arcoll's help he is rewarded with a large portion of the treasure hidden in the cave and eventually returns to Scotland a rich man.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg EBook of Prester John, by John Buchan\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

Little I\nknew at the time how big the moment was with destiny, or how often that\nface seen in the fitful moonlight would haunt my sleep and disturb my\nwaking hours.  But I mind yet the cold grue of terror I got from it, a\nterror which was surely more than the due of a few truant lads breaking\nthe Sabbath with their play.\n\nThe town of Kirkcaple, of which and its adjacent parish of Portincross\nmy father was the minister, lies on a hillside above the little bay of\nCaple, and looks squarely out on the North Sea.  Round the horns of\nland which enclose the bay the coast shows on either side a battlement\nof stark red cliffs through which a burn or two makes a pass to the\nwater's edge.  The bay itself is ringed with fine clean sands, where we\nlads of the burgh school loved to bathe in the warm weather.  But on\nlong holidays the sport was to go farther afield among the cliffs; for\nthere there were many deep caves and pools, where podleys might be\ncaught with the line, and hid treasures sought for at the expense of\nthe skin of the knees and the buttons of the trousers.  Many a long\nSaturday I have passed in a crinkle of the cliffs, having lit a fire of\ndriftwood, and made believe that I was a smuggler or a Jacobite new\nlanded from France.  There was a band of us in Kirkcaple, lads of my\nown age, including Archie Leslie, the son of my father's session-clerk,\nand Tam Dyke, the provost's nephew.  We were sealed to silence by the\nblood oath, and we bore each the name of some historic pirate or\nsailorman.  I was Paul Jones, Tam was Captain Kidd, and Archie, need I\nsay it, was Morgan himself.  Our tryst was a cave where a little water\ncalled the Dyve Burn had cut its way through the cliffs to the sea.\nThere we forgathered in the summer evenings and of a Saturday afternoon\nin winter, and told mighty tales of our prowess and flattered our silly\nhearts.  But the sober truth is that our deeds were of the humblest,\nand a dozen of fish or a handful of apples was all our booty, and our\ngreatest exploit a fight with the roughs at the Dyve tan-work.\n\nMy father's spring Communion fell on the last Sabbath of April, and on\nthe particular Sabbath of which I speak the weather was mild and bright\nfor the time of year.  I had been surfeited with the Thursday's and\nSaturday's services, and the two long diets of worship on the Sabbath\nwere hard for a lad of twelve to bear with the spring in his bones and\nthe sun slanting through the gallery window.  There still remained the\nservice on the Sabbath evening--a doleful prospect, for the Rev. Mr\nMurdoch of Kilchristie, noted for the length of his discourses, had\nexchanged pulpits with my father.  So my mind was ripe for the proposal\nof Archie Leslie, on our way home to tea, that by a little skill we\nmight give the kirk the slip.  At our Communion the pews were emptied\nof their regular occupants and the congregation seated itself as it\npleased.  The manse seat was full of the Kirkcaple relations of Mr\nMurdoch, who had been invited there by my mother to hear him, and it\nwas not hard to obtain permission to sit with Archie and Tam Dyke in\nthe cock-loft in the gallery.  Word was sent to Tam, and so it happened\nthat three abandoned lads duly passed the plate and took their seats in\nthe cock-loft.  But when the bell had done jowing, and we heard by the\nsounds of their feet that the elders had gone in to the kirk, we\nslipped down the stairs and out of the side door.  We were through the\nchurchyard in a twinkling, and hot-foot on the road to the Dyve Burn.\nIt was the fashion of the genteel in Kirkcaple to put their boys into\nwhat were known as Eton suits--long trousers, cut-away jackets, and\nchimney-pot hats.  I had been one of the earliest victims, and well I\nremember how I fled home from the Sabbath school with the snowballs of\nthe town roughs rattling off my chimney-pot.  Archie had followed, his\nfamily being in all things imitators of mine.  We were now clothed in\nthis wearisome garb, so our first care was to secrete safely our hats\nin a marked spot under some whin bushes on the links. Tam was free from\nthe bondage of fashion, and wore his ordinary best knickerbockers.\nFrom inside his jacket he unfolded his special treasure, which was to\nlight us on our expedition--an evil-smelling old tin lantern with a\nshutter.\n\nTam was of the Free Kirk persuasion, and as his Communion fell on a\ndifferent day from ours, he was spared the bondage of church attendance\nfrom which Archie and I had revolted.  But notable events had happened\nthat day in his church.  A black man, the Rev. John\nSomething-or-other, had been preaching.  Tam was full of the portent.\n'A nagger,' he said, 'a great black chap as big as your father,\nArchie.'  He seemed to have banged the bookboard with some effect, and\nhad kept Tam, for once in his life, awake.  He had preached about the\nheathen in Africa, and how a black man was as good as a white man in\nthe sight of God, and he had forecast a day when the negroes would have\nsomething to teach the British in the way of civilization.  So at any\nrate ran the account of Tam Dyke, who did not share the preacher's\nviews.  'It's all nonsense, Davie.  The Bible says that the children of\nHam were to be our servants.  If I were the minister I wouldn't let a\nnigger into the pulpit.  I wouldn't let him farther than the Sabbath\nschool.'\n\nNight fell as we came to the broomy spaces of the links, and ere we had\nbreasted the slope of the neck which separates Kirkcaple Bay from the\ncliffs it was as dark as an April evening with a full moon can be.  Tam\nwould have had it darker.  He got out his lantern, and after a\nprodigious waste of matches kindled the candle-end inside, turned the\ndark shutter, and trotted happily on.  We had no need of his lighting\ntill the Dyve Burn was reached and the path began to descend steeply\nthrough the rift in the crags.\n\nIt was here we found that some one had gone before us. Archie was great\nin those days at tracking, his ambition running in Indian paths.  He\nwould walk always with his head bent and his eyes on the ground,\nwhereby he several times found lost coins and once a trinket dropped by\nthe provost's wife.  At the edge of the burn, where the path turns\ndownward, there is a patch of shingle washed up by some spate.  Archie\nwas on his knees in a second.  'Lads,' he cried, 'there's spoor here;'\nand then after some nosing, 'it's a man's track, going downward, a big\nman with flat feet.  It's fresh, too, for it crosses the damp bit of\ngravel, and the water has scarcely filled the holes yet.'\n\nWe did not dare to question Archie's woodcraft, but it puzzled us who\nthe stranger could be.  In summer weather you might find a party of\npicnickers here, attracted by the fine hard sands at the burn mouth.\nBut at this time of night and season of the year there was no call for\nany one to be trespassing on our preserves.  No fishermen came this\nway, the lobster-pots being all to the east, and the stark headland of\nthe Red Neb made the road to them by the water's edge difficult.  The\ntan-work lads used to come now and then for a swim, but you would not\nfind a tan-work lad bathing on a chill April night. Yet there was no\nquestion where our precursor had gone.  He was making for the shore.\nTam unshuttered his lantern, and the steps went clearly down the\ncorkscrew path.  'Maybe he is after our cave.  We'd better go cannily.'\n\nThe glim was dowsed--the words were Archie's--and in the best\ncontraband manner we stole down the gully.  The business had suddenly\ntaken an eerie turn, and I think in our hearts we were all a little\nafraid.  But Tam had a lantern, and it would never do to turn back from\nan adventure which had all the appearance of being the true sort.  Half\nway down there is a scrog of wood, dwarf alders and hawthorn, which\nmakes an arch over the path.  I, for one, was glad when we got through\nthis with no worse mishap than a stumble from Tam which caused the\nlantern door to fly open and the candle to go out. We did not stop to\nrelight it, but scrambled down the screes till we came to the long\nslabs of reddish rock which abutted on the beach.  We could not see the\ntrack, so we gave up the business of scouts, and dropped quietly over\nthe big boulder and into the crinkle of cliff which we called our cave.\n\nThere was nobody there, so we relit the lantern and examined our\nproperties.  Two or three fishing-rods for the burn, much damaged by\nweather; some sea-lines on a dry shelf of rock; a couple of wooden\nboxes; a pile of driftwood for fires, and a heap of quartz in which we\nthought we had found veins of gold--such was the modest furnishing of\nour den.  To this I must add some broken clay pipes, with which we made\nbelieve to imitate our elders, smoking a foul mixture of coltsfoot\nleaves and brown paper.  The band was in session, so following our\nritual we sent out a picket.  Tam was deputed to go round the edge of\nthe cliff from which the shore was visible, and report if the coast was\nclear.\n\nHe returned in three minutes, his eyes round with amazement in the\nlantern light.  'There's a fire on the sands,' he repeated, 'and a man\nbeside it.'\n\nHere was news indeed.  Without a word we made for the open, Archie\nfirst, and Tam, who had seized and shuttered his lantern, coming last.\nWe crawled to the edge of the cliff and peered round, and there sure\nenough, on the hard bit of sand which the tide had left by the burn\nmouth, was a twinkle of light and a dark figure.\n\nThe moon was rising, and besides there was that curious sheen from the\nsea which you will often notice in spring.  The glow was maybe a\nhundred yards distant, a little spark of fire I could have put in my\ncap, and, from its crackling and smoke, composed of dry seaweed and\nhalf-green branches from the burnside thickets.  A man's figure stood\nnear it, and as we looked it moved round and round the fire in circles\nwhich first of all widened and then contracted.\n\nThe sight was so unexpected, so beyond the beat of our experience, that\nwe were all a little scared.  What could this strange being want with a\nfire at half-past eight of an April Sabbath night on the Dyve Burn\nsands?  We discussed the thing in whispers behind a boulder, but none\nof us had any solution.  'Belike he's come ashore in a boat,' said\nArchie.  'He's maybe a foreigner.'  But I pointed out that, from the\ntracks which Archie himself had found, the man must have come overland\ndown the cliffs.  Tam was clear he was a madman, and was for\nwithdrawing promptly from the whole business.\n\nBut some spell kept our feet tied there in that silent world of sand\nand moon and sea.  I remember looking back and seeing the solemn,\nfrowning faces of the cliffs, and feeling somehow shut in with this\nunknown being in a strange union.  What kind of errand had brought this\ninterloper into our territory?  For a wonder I was less afraid than\ncurious.  I wanted to get to the heart of the matter, and to discover\nwhat the man was up to with his fire and his circles.\n\nThe same thought must have been in Archie's head, for he dropped on his\nbelly and began to crawl softly seawards.  I followed, and Tam, with\nsundry complaints, crept after my heels.  Between the cliffs and the\nfire lay some sixty yards of _d\u00c3\u00a9bris_ and boulders above the level of all\nbut the high spring tides.  Beyond lay a string of seaweedy pools and\nthen the hard sands of the burnfoot.  There was excellent cover among\nthe big stones, and apart from the distance and the dim light, the man\nby the fire was too preoccupied in his task to keep much look-out\ntowards the land.  I remember thinking he had chosen his place well,\nfor save from the sea he could not be seen.  The cliffs are so undercut\nthat unless a watcher on the coast were on their extreme edge he would\nnot see the burnfoot sands.\n\nArchie, the skilled tracker, was the one who all but betrayed us.  His\nknee slipped on the seaweed, and he rolled off a boulder, bringing down\nwith him a clatter of small stones.  We lay as still as mice, in terror\nlest the man should have heard the noise and have come to look for the\ncause.  By-and-by when I ventured to raise my head above a flat-topped\nstone I saw that he was undisturbed.  The fire still burned, and he was\npacing round it. On the edge of the pools was an outcrop of red\nsandstone much fissured by the sea.  Here was an excellent\nvantage-ground, and all three of us curled behind it, with our eyes\njust over the edge.  The man was not twenty yards off, and I could see\nclearly what manner of fellow he was.  For one thing he was huge of\nsize, or so he seemed to me in the half-light.  He wore nothing but a\nshirt and trousers, and I could hear by the flap of his feet on the\nsand that he was barefoot.\n\nSuddenly Tam Dyke gave a gasp of astonishment.  'Gosh, it's the black\nminister!' he said.\n\nIt was indeed a black man, as we saw when the moon came out of a cloud.\nHis head was on his breast, and he walked round the fire with measured,\nregular steps.  At intervals he would stop and raise both hands to the\nsky, and bend his body in the direction of the moon.  But he never\nuttered a word.\n\n'It's magic,' said Archie.  'He's going to raise Satan.  We must bide\nhere and see what happens, for he'll grip us if we try to go back.  The\nmoon's ower high.'\n\nThe procession continued as if to some slow music.  I had been in no\nfear of the adventure back there by our cave; but now that I saw the\nthing from close at hand, my courage began to ebb.  There was something\ndesperately uncanny about this great negro, who had shed his clerical\ngarments, and was now practising some strange magic alone by the sea.\nI had no doubt it was the black art, for there was that in the air and\nthe scene which spelled the unlawful.  As we watched, the circles\nstopped, and the man threw something on the fire.  A thick smoke rose\nof which we could feel the aromatic scent, and when it was gone the\nflame burned with a silvery blueness like moonlight.  Still no sound\ncame from the minister, but he took something from his belt, and began\nto make odd markings in the sand between the inner circle and the fire.\nAs he turned, the moon gleamed on the implement, and we saw it was a\ngreat knife.\n\nWe were now scared in real earnest.  Here were we, three boys, at night\nin a lonely place a few yards from a savage with a knife. The adventure\nwas far past my liking, and even the intrepid Archie was having qualms,\nif I could judge from his set face. As for Tam, his teeth were\nchattering like a threshing-mill.\n\nSuddenly I felt something soft and warm on the rock at my right hand.\nI felt again, and, lo! it was the man's clothes. There were his boots\nand socks, his minister's coat and his minister's hat.\n\nThis made the predicament worse, for if we waited till he finished his\nrites we should for certain be found by him.  At the same time, to\nreturn over the boulders in the bright moonlight seemed an equally sure\nway to discovery.  I whispered to Archie, who was for waiting a little\nlonger.  'Something may turn up,' he said.  It was always his way.\n\nI do not know what would have turned up, for we had no chance of\ntesting it.  The situation had proved too much for the nerves of Tam\nDyke.  As the man turned towards us in his bowings and bendings, Tam\nsuddenly sprang to his feet and shouted at him a piece of schoolboy\nrudeness then fashionable in Kirkcaple.\n\n'Wha called ye partan-face, my bonny man?'  Then, clutching his\nlantern, he ran for dear life, while Archie and I raced at his heels.\nAs I turned I had a glimpse of a huge figure, knife in hand, bounding\ntowards us.\n\nThough I only saw it in the turn of a head, the face stamped itself\nindelibly upon my mind.  It was black, black as ebony, but it was\ndifferent from the ordinary negro.  There were no thick lips and flat\nnostrils; rather, if I could trust my eyes, the nose was high-bridged,\nand the lines of the mouth sharp and firm.  But it was distorted into\nan expression of such a devilish fury and amazement that my heart\nbecame like water.\n\nWe had a start, as I have said, of some twenty or thirty yards.  Among\nthe boulders we were not at a great disadvantage, for a boy can flit\nquickly over them, while a grown man must pick his way.  Archie, as\never, kept his wits the best of us. 'Make straight for the burn,' he\nshouted in a hoarse whisper; we'll beat him on the slope.'\n\nWe passed the boulders and slithered over the outcrop of red rock and\nthe patches of sea-pink till we reached the channel of the Dyve water,\nwhich flows gently among pebbles after leaving the gully.  Here for the\nfirst time I looked back and saw nothing.  I stopped involuntarily, and\nthat halt was nearly my undoing.  For our pursuer had reached the burn\nbefore us, but lower down, and was coming up its bank to cut us off.\n\nAt most times I am a notable coward, and in these days I was still more\nof one, owing to a quick and easily-heated imagination.  But now I\nthink I did a brave thing, though more by instinct than resolution.\nArchie was running first, and had already splashed through the burn;\nTam came next, just about to cross, and the black man was almost at his\nelbow.  Another second and Tam would have been in his clutches had I\nnot yelled out a warning and made straight up the bank of the burn.\nTam fell into the pool--I could hear his spluttering cry--but he got\nacross; for I heard Archie call to him, and the two vanished into the\nthicket which clothes all the left bank of the gully.  The pursuer,\nseeing me on his own side of the water, followed straight on; and\nbefore I knew it had become a race between the two of us.\n\nI was hideously frightened, but not without hope, for the screes and\nshelves of this right side of the gully were known to me from many a\nday's exploring.  I was light on my feet and uncommonly sound in wind,\nbeing by far the best long-distance runner in Kirkcaple.  If I could\nonly keep my lead till I reached a certain corner I knew of, I could\noutwit my enemy; for it was possible from that place to make a detour\nbehind a waterfall and get into a secret path of ours among the bushes.\nI flew up the steep screes, not daring to look round; but at the top,\nwhere the rocks begin, I had a glimpse of my pursuer. The man could\nrun.  Heavy in build though he was he was not six yards behind me, and\nI could see the white of his eyes and the red of his gums.  I saw\nsomething else--a glint of white metal in his hand.  He still had his\nknife.\n\nFear sent me up the rocks like a seagull, and I scrambled and leaped,\nmaking for the corner I knew of.  Something told me that the pursuit\nwas slackening, and for a moment I halted to look round.  A second time\na halt was nearly the end of me. A great stone flew through the air,\nand took the cliff an inch from my head, half-blinding me with\nsplinters.  And now I began to get angry.  I pulled myself into cover,\nskirted a rock till I came to my corner, and looked back for the enemy.\nThere he was scrambling by the way I had come, and making a prodigious\nclatter among the stones.  I picked up a loose bit of rock and hurled\nit with all my force in his direction.  It broke before it reached him,\nbut a considerable lump, to my joy, took him full in the face.  Then my\nterrors revived.  I slipped behind the waterfall and was soon in the\nthicket, and toiling towards the top.\n\nI think this last bit was the worst in the race, for my strength was\nfailing, and I seemed to hear those horrid steps at my heels.  My heart\nwas in my mouth as, careless of my best clothes, I tore through the\nhawthorn bushes.  Then I struck the path and, to my relief, came on\nArchie and Tam, who were running slowly in desperate anxiety about my\nfate.  We then took hands and soon reached the top of the gully.\n\nFor a second we looked back.  The pursuit had ceased, and far down the\nburn we could hear the sounds as of some one going back to the sands.\n\n'Your face is bleeding, Davie.  Did he get near enough to hit you?'\nArchie asked.\n\n'He hit me with a stone.  But I gave him better.  He's got a bleeding\nnose to remember this night by.'\n\nWe did not dare take the road by the links, but made for the nearest\nhuman habitation.  This was a farm about half a mile inland, and when\nwe reached it we lay down by the stack-yard gate and panted.\n\n'I've lost my lantern,' said Tam.  'The big black brute!  See if I\ndon't tell my father.'\n\n'Ye'll do nothing of the kind,' said Archie fiercely.  'He knows\nnothing about us and can't do us any harm.  But if the story got out\nand he found out who we were, he'd murder the lot of US.'\n\nHe made us swear secrecy, which we were willing enough to do, seeing\nvery clearly the sense in his argument.  Then we struck the highroad\nand trotted back at our best pace to Kirkcaple, fear of our families\ngradually ousting fear of pursuit. In our excitement Archie and I\nforgot about our Sabbath hats, reposing quietly below a whin bush on\nthe links.\n\nWe were not destined to escape without detection.  As ill luck would\nhave it, Mr Murdoch had been taken ill with the stomach-ache after the\nsecond psalm, and the congregation had been abruptly dispersed.  My\nmother had waited for me at the church door, and, seeing no signs of\nher son, had searched the gallery.  Then the truth came out, and, had I\nbeen only for a mild walk on the links, retribution would have\novertaken my truantry.  But to add to this I arrived home with a\nscratched face, no hat, and several rents in my best trousers.  I was\nwell cuffed and sent to bed, with the promise of full-dress\nchastisement when my father should come home in the morning.\n\nMy father arrived before breakfast next day, and I was duly and soundly\nwhipped.  I set out for school with aching bones to add to the usual\ndepression of Monday morning.  At the corner of the Nethergate I fell\nin with Archie, who was staring at a trap carrying two men which was\ncoming down the street. It was the Free Church minister--he had married\na rich wife and kept a horse--driving the preacher of yesterday to the\nrailway station.  Archie and I were in behind a doorpost in a\ntwinkling, so that we could see in safety the last of our enemy. He was\ndressed in minister's clothes, with a heavy fur-coat and a brand new\nyellow-leather Gladstone bag.  He was talking loudly as he passed, and\nthe Free Church minister seemed to be listening attentively.  I heard\nhis deep voice saying something about the 'work of God in this place.'\nBut what I noticed specially--and the sight made me forget my aching\nhinder parts--was that he had a swollen eye, and two strips of\nsticking-plaster on his cheek.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\nFURTH! FORTUNE!\n\nIn this plain story of mine there will be so many wild doings ere the\nend is reached, that I beg my reader's assent to a prosaic digression.\nI will tell briefly the things which happened between my sight of the\nman on the Kirkcaple sands and my voyage to Africa. I continued for\nthree years at the burgh school, where my progress was less notable in\nmy studies than in my sports.  One by one I saw my companions pass out\nof idle boyhood and be set to professions.  Tam Dyke on two occasions\nran off to sea in the Dutch schooners which used to load with coal in\nour port; and finally his father gave him his will, and he was\napprenticed to the merchant service.  Archie Leslie, who was a year my\nelder, was destined for the law, so he left Kirkcaple for an Edinburgh\noffice, where he was also to take out classes at the college.  I\nremained on at school till I sat alone by myself in the highest\nclass--a position of little dignity and deep loneliness.  I had grown a\ntall, square-set lad, and my prowess at Rugby football was renowned\nbeyond the parishes of Kirkcaple and Portincross.  To my father I fear\nI was a disappointment.  He had hoped for something in his son more\nbookish and sedentary, more like his gentle, studious self.\n\nOn one thing I was determined: I should follow a learned profession.\nThe fear of being sent to an office, like so many of my schoolfellows,\ninspired me to the little progress I ever made in my studies.  I chose\nthe ministry, not, I fear, out of any reverence for the sacred calling,\nbut because my father had followed it before me.  Accordingly I was\nsent at the age of sixteen for a year's finishing at the High School of\nEdinburgh, and the following winter began my Arts course at the\nuniversity.\n\nIf Fate had been kinder to me, I think I might have become a scholar.\nAt any rate I was just acquiring a taste for philosophy and the dead\nlanguages when my father died suddenly of a paralytic shock, and I had\nto set about earning a living.\n\nMy mother was left badly off, for my poor father had never been able to\nsave much from his modest stipend.  When all things were settled, it\nturned out that she might reckon on an income of about fifty pounds a\nyear.  This was not enough to live on, however modest the household,\nand certainly not enough to pay for the colleging of a son.  At this\npoint an uncle of hers stepped forward with a proposal.  He was a\nwell-to-do bachelor, alone in the world, and he invited my mother to\nlive with him and take care of his house.  For myself he proposed a\npost in some mercantile concern, for he had much influence in the\ncircles of commerce.  There was nothing for it but to accept\ngratefully.  We sold our few household goods, and moved to his gloomy\nhouse in Dundas Street.  A few days later he announced at dinner that\nhe had found for me a chance which might lead to better things.\n\n'You see, Davie,' he explained, 'you don't know the rudiments of\nbusiness life.  There's no house in the country that would take you in\nexcept as a common clerk, and you would never earn much more than a\nhundred pounds a year all your days.  If you want to better your future\nyou must go abroad, where white men are at a premium.  By the mercy of\nProvidence I met yesterday an old friend, Thomas Mackenzie, who was\nseeing his lawyer about an estate he is bidding for.  He is the head of\none of the biggest trading and shipping concerns in the\nworld--Mackenzie, Mure, and Oldmeadows--you may have heard the name.\nAmong other things he has half the stores in South Africa, where they\nsell everything from Bibles to fish-hooks.  Apparently they like men\nfrom home to manage the stores, and to make a long story short, when I\nput your case to him, he promised you a place.  I had a wire from him\nthis morning confirming the offer.  You are to be assistant storekeeper\nat--' (my uncle fumbled in his pocket, and then read from the yellow\nslip) 'at Blaauwildebeestefontein.  There's a mouthful for you.'\n\nIn this homely way I first heard of a place which was to be the theatre\nof so many strange doings.\n\n'It's a fine chance for you,' my uncle continued.  'You'll only be\nassistant at first, but when you have learned your job you'll have a\nstore of your own.  Mackenzie's people will pay you three hundred\npounds a year, and when you get a store you'll get a percentage on\nsales.  It lies with you to open up new trade among the natives.  I\nhear that Blaauw--something or other, is in the far north of the\nTransvaal, and I see from the map that it is in a wild, hilly country.\nYou may find gold or diamonds up there, and come back and buy\nPortincross House.'  My uncle rubbed his hands and smiled cheerily.\n\nTruth to tell I was both pleased and sad.  If a learned profession was\ndenied me I vastly preferred a veld store to an Edinburgh office stool.\nHad I not been still under the shadow of my father's death I might have\nwelcomed the chance of new lands and new folk.  As it was, I felt the\nloneliness of an exile. That afternoon I walked on the Braid Hills, and\nwhen I saw in the clear spring sunlight the coast of Fife, and\nremembered Kirkcaple and my boyish days, I could have found it in me to\nsit down and cry.\n\nA fortnight later I sailed.  My mother bade me a tearful farewell, and\nmy uncle, besides buying me an outfit and paying my passage money, gave\nme a present of twenty sovereigns. 'You'll not be your mother's son,\nDavie,' were his last words, 'if you don't come home with it multiplied\nby a thousand.'  I thought at the time that I would give more than\ntwenty thousand pounds to be allowed to bide on the windy shores of\nForth.\n\n\nI sailed from Southampton by an intermediate steamer, and went steerage\nto save expense.  Happily my acute homesickness was soon forgotten in\nanother kind of malady.  It blew half a gale before we were out of the\nChannel, and by the time we had rounded Ushant it was as dirty weather\nas ever I hope to see.  I lay mortal sick in my bunk, unable to bear\nthe thought of food, and too feeble to lift my head.  I wished I had\nnever left home, but so acute was my sickness that if some one had\nthere and then offered me a passage back or an immediate landing on\nshore I should have chosen the latter.\n\nIt was not till we got into the fair-weather seas around Madeira that I\nrecovered enough to sit on deck and observe my fellow-passengers.\nThere were some fifty of us in the steerage, mostly wives and children\ngoing to join relations, with a few emigrant artisans and farmers.  I\nearly found a friend in a little man with a yellow beard and\nspectacles, who sat down beside me and remarked on the weather in a\nstrong Scotch accent.  He turned out to be a Mr Wardlaw from Aberdeen,\nwho was going out to be a schoolmaster.  He was a man of good\neducation, who had taken a university degree, and had taught for some\nyears as an under-master in a school in his native town.  But the east\nwinds had damaged his lungs, and he had been glad to take the chance of\na poorly paid country school in the veld.  When I asked him where he\nwas going I was amazed to be told, 'Blaauwildebeestefontein.'\n\nMr Wardlaw was a pleasant little man, with a sharp tongue but a\ncheerful temper.  He laboured all day at primers of the Dutch and\nKaffir languages, but in the evening after supper he would walk with me\non the after-deck and discuss the future.  Like me, he knew nothing of\nthe land he was going to, but he was insatiably curious, and he\naffected me with his interest.  'This place, Blaauwildebeestefontein,'\nhe used to say, 'is among the Zoutpansberg mountains, and as far as I\ncan see, not above ninety miles from the railroad.  It looks from the\nmap a well-watered country, and the Agent-General in London told me it\nwas healthy or I wouldn't have taken the job.  It seems we'll be in the\nheart of native reserves up there, for here's a list of chiefs--'Mpefu,\nSikitola, Majinje, Magata; and there are no white men living to the\neast of us because of the fever.  The name means the \"spring of the\nblue wildebeeste,\" whatever fearsome animal that may be.  It sounds\nlike a place for adventure, Mr Crawfurd.  You'll exploit the pockets of\nthe black men and I'll see what I can do with their minds.' There was\nanother steerage passenger whom I could not help observing because of\nmy dislike of his appearance.  He, too, was a little man, by name\nHenriques, and in looks the most atrocious villain I have ever clapped\neyes on.  He had a face the colour of French mustard--a sort of dirty\ngreen--and bloodshot, beady eyes with the whites all yellowed with\nfever. He had waxed moustaches, and a curious, furtive way of walking\nand looking about him.  We of the steerage were careless in our dress,\nbut he was always clad in immaculate white linen, with pointed, yellow\nshoes to match his complexion.  He spoke to no one, but smoked long\ncheroots all day in the stern of the ship, and studied a greasy\npocket-book. Once I tripped over him in the dark, and he turned on me\nwith a snarl and an oath.  I was short enough with him in return, and\nhe looked as if he could knife me.\n\n'I'll wager that fellow has been a slave-driver in his time,' I told Mr\nWardlaw, who said, 'God pity his slaves, then.'\n\nAnd now I come to the incident which made the rest of the voyage pass\nall too soon for me, and foreshadowed the strange events which were to\ncome.  It was the day after we crossed the Line, and the first-class\npassengers were having deck sports.  A tug-of-war had been arranged\nbetween the three classes, and a half-dozen of the heaviest fellows in\nthe steerage, myself included, were invited to join.  It was a blazing\nhot afternoon, but on the saloon deck there were awnings and a cool\nwind blowing from the bows.  The first-class beat the second easily,\nand after a tremendous struggle beat the steerage also.  Then they\nregaled us with iced-drinks and cigars to celebrate the victory.\n\nI was standing at the edge of the crowd of spectators, when my eye\ncaught a figure which seemed to have little interest in our games.  A\nlarge man in clerical clothes was sitting on a deck-chair reading a\nbook.  There was nothing novel about the stranger, and I cannot explain\nthe impulse which made me wish to see his face.  I moved a few steps up\nthe deck, and then I saw that his skin was black.  I went a little\nfarther, and suddenly he raised his eyes from his book and looked\nround. It was the face of the man who had terrified me years ago on the\nKirkcaple shore.\n\nI spent the rest of the day in a brown study.  It was clear to me that\nsome destiny had prearranged this meeting.  Here was this man\ntravelling prosperously as a first-class passenger with all the\nappurtenances of respectability.  I alone had seen him invoking strange\ngods in the moonlight, I alone knew of the devilry in his heart, and I\ncould not but believe that some day or other there might be virtue in\nthat knowledge.\n\nThe second engineer and I had made friends, so I got him to consult the\npurser's list for the name of my acquaintance. He was down as the Rev.\nJohn Laputa, and his destination was Durban. The next day being Sunday,\nwho should appear to address us steerage passengers but the black\nminister.  He was introduced by the captain himself, a notably pious\nman, who spoke of the labours of his brother in the dark places of\nheathendom. Some of us were hurt in our pride in being made the target\nof a black man's oratory.  Especially Mr Henriques, whose skin spoke of\nthe tar-brush, protested with oaths against the insult. Finally he sat\ndown on a coil of rope, and spat scornfully in the vicinity of the\npreacher.\n\nFor myself I was intensely curious, and not a little impressed.  The\nman's face was as commanding as his figure, and his voice was the most\nwonderful thing that ever came out of human mouth.  It was full and\nrich, and gentle, with the tones of a great organ.  He had none of the\nsquat and preposterous negro lineaments, but a hawk nose like an Arab,\ndark flashing eyes, and a cruel and resolute mouth.  He was black as my\nhat, but for the rest he might have sat for a figure of a Crusader.  I\ndo not know what the sermon was about, though others told me that it\nwas excellent.  All the time I watched him, and kept saying to myself,\n'You hunted me up the Dyve Burn, but I bashed your face for you.'\nIndeed, I thought I could see faint scars on his cheek.\n\nThe following night I had toothache, and could not sleep.  It was too\nhot to breathe under cover, so I got up, lit a pipe, and walked on the\nafter-deck to ease the pain.  The air was very still, save for the\nwhish of water from the screws and the steady beat of the engines.\nAbove, a great yellow moon looked down on me, and a host of pale stars.\n\nThe moonlight set me remembering the old affair of the Dyve Burn, and\nmy mind began to run on the Rev. John Laputa.  It pleased me to think\nthat I was on the track of some mystery of which I alone had the clue.\nI promised myself to search out the antecedents of the minister when I\ngot to Durban, for I had a married cousin there, who might know\nsomething of his doings.  Then, as I passed by the companion-way to the\nlower deck, I heard voices, and peeping over the rail, I saw two men\nsitting in the shadow just beyond the hatch of the hold.\n\nI thought they might be two of the sailors seeking coolness on the open\ndeck, when something in the figure of one of them made me look again.\nThe next second I had slipped back and stolen across the after-deck to\na point just above them.  For the two were the black minister and that\nugly yellow villain, Henriques.\n\nI had no scruples about eavesdropping, but I could make nothing of\ntheir talk.  They spoke low, and in some tongue which may have been\nKaffir or Portuguese, but was in any case unknown to me.  I lay,\ncramped and eager, for many minutes, and was just getting sick of it\nwhen a familiar name caught my ear.  Henriques said something in which\nI caught the word 'Blaauwildebeestefontein.'  I listened intently, and\nthere could be no mistake.  The minister repeated the name, and for the\nnext few minutes it recurred often in their talk.  I went back\nstealthily to bed, having something to make me forget my aching tooth.\nFirst of all, Laputa and Henriques were allies.  Second, the place I\nwas bound for had something to do with their schemes.\n\nI said nothing to Mr Wardlaw, but spent the next week in the assiduous\ntoil of the amateur detective.  I procured some maps and books from my\nfriend, the second engineer, and read all I could about\nBlaauwildebeestefontein.  Not that there was much to learn; but I\nremember I had quite a thrill when I discovered from the chart of the\nship's run one day that we were in the same latitude as that\nuncouthly-named spot.  I found out nothing, however, about Henriques or\nthe Rev. John Laputa.  The Portuguese still smoked in the stern, and\nthumbed his greasy notebook; the minister sat in his deck-chair, and\nread heavy volumes from the ship's library.  Though I watched every\nnight, I never found them again together.\n\nAt Cape Town Henriques went ashore and did not return. The minister did\nnot budge from the ship the three days we lay in port, and, indeed, it\nseemed to me that he kept his cabin.  At any rate I did not see his\ngreat figure on deck till we were tossing in the choppy seas round Cape\nAgulhas. Sea-sickness again attacked me, and with short lulls during\nour stoppages at Port Elizabeth and East London, I lay wretchedly in my\nbunk till we sighted the bluffs of Durban harbour.\n\nHere it was necessary for me to change my ship, for in the interests of\neconomy I was going by sea to Delagoa Bay, and thence by the cheap\nrailway journey into the Transvaal.  I sought out my cousin, who lived\nin a fine house on the Berea, and found a comfortable lodging for the\nthree days of my stay there.  I made inquiries about Mr Laputa, but\ncould hear nothing.  There was no native minister of that name, said my\ncousin, who was a great authority on all native questions.  I described\nthe man, but got no further light.  No one had seen or heard of such a\nbeing, 'unless,' said my cousin, 'he is one of those American Ethiopian\nrascals.'\n\nMy second task was to see the Durban manager of the firm which I had\nundertaken to serve.  He was a certain Mr Colles, a big fat man, who\nwelcomed me in his shirt-sleeves, with a cigar in his mouth.  He\nreceived me pleasantly, and took me home to dinner with him.\n\n'Mr Mackenzie has written about you,' he said.  'I'll be quite frank\nwith you, Mr Crawfurd.  The firm is not exactly satisfied about the way\nbusiness has been going lately at Blaauwildebeestefontein. There's a\ngrand country up there, and a grand opportunity for the man who can\ntake it.  Japp, who is in charge, is an old man now and past his best,\nbut he has been long with the firm, and we don't want to hurt his\nfeelings.  When he goes, which must be pretty soon, you'll have a good\nchance of the place, if you show yourself an active young fellow.'\n\nHe told me a great deal more about Blaauwildebeestefontein, principally\ntrading details.  Incidentally he let drop that Mr Japp had had several\nassistants in the last few years.  I asked him why they had left, and\nhe hesitated.\n\n'It's a lonely place, and they didn't like the life.  You see, there\nare few white men near, and young fellows want society. They\ncomplained, and were moved on.  But the firm didn't think the more of\nthem.'\n\nI told him I had come out with the new schoolmaster.\n\n'Yes,' he said reflectively, 'the school.  That's been vacant pretty\noften lately.  What sort of fellow is this Wardlaw?  Will he stay, I\nwonder?'\n\n'From all accounts,' I said, 'Blaauwildebeestefontein does not seem\npopular.'\n\n'It isn't.  That's why we've got you out from home.  The colonial-born\ndoesn't find it fit in with his idea of comfort.  He wants society, and\nhe doesn't like too many natives.  There's nothing up there but natives\nand a few back-veld Dutchmen with native blood in them.  You fellows\nfrom home are less set on an easy life, or you wouldn't be here.'\n\nThere was something in Mr Colles's tone which made me risk another\nquestion.\n\n'What's the matter with the place?  There must be more wrong with it\nthan loneliness to make everybody clear out.  I have taken on this job,\nand I mean to stick to it, so you needn't be afraid to tell me.'\n\nThe manager looked at me sharply.  'That's the way to talk, my lad.\nYou look as if you had a stiff back, so I'll be frank with you.  There\nis something about the place.  It gives the ordinary man the jumps.\nWhat it is, I don't know, and the men who come back don't know\nthemselves.  I want you to find out for me.  You'll be doing the firm\nan enormous service if you can get on the track of it.  It may be the\nnatives, or it may be the takhaars, or it may be something else.  Only\nold Japp can stick it out, and he's too old and doddering to care about\nmoving.  I want you to keep your eyes skinned, and write privately to\nme if you want any help.  You're not out here for your health, I can\nsee, and here's a chance for you to get your foot on the ladder.\n\n'Remember, I'm your friend,' he said to me again at the garden gate.\n'Take my advice and lie very low.  Don't talk, don't meddle with drink,\nlearn all you can of the native jabber, but don't let on you understand\na word.  You're sure to get on the track of something.  Good-bye, my\nboy,' and he waved a fat hand to me.\n\nThat night I embarked on a cargo-boat which was going round the coast\nto Delagoa Bay.  It is a small world--at least for us far-wandering\nScots.  For who should I find when I got on board but my old friend Tam\nDyke, who was second mate on the vessel?  We wrung each other's hands,\nand I answered, as best I could, his questions about Kirkcaple.  I had\nsupper with him in the cabin, and went on deck to see the moorings cast.\n\nSuddenly there was a bustle on the quay, and a big man with a handbag\nforced his way up the gangway.  The men who were getting ready to cast\noff tried to stop him, but he elbowed his way forward, declaring he\nmust see the captain.  Tam went up to him and asked civilly if he had a\npassage taken.  He admitted he had not, but said he would make it right\nin two minutes with the captain himself.  The Rev. John Laputa, for\nsome reason of his own, was leaving Durban with more haste than he had\nentered it.\n\nI do not know what passed with the captain, but the minister got his\npassage right enough, and Tam was even turned out of his cabin to make\nroom for him.  This annoyed my friend intensely.\n\n'That black brute must be made of money, for he paid through the nose\nfor this, or I'm a Dutchman.  My old man doesn't take to his black\nbrethren any more than I do.  Hang it all, what are we coming to, when\nwe're turning into a blooming cargo boat for niggers?'\n\nI had all too little of Tam's good company, for on the afternoon of the\nsecond day we reached the little town of Lourenco Marques.  This was my\nfinal landing in Africa, and I mind how eagerly I looked at the low,\ngreen shores and the bush-covered slopes of the mainland.  We were\nlanded from boats while the ship lay out in the bay, and Tam came\nashore with me to spend the evening.  By this time I had lost every\nremnant of homesickness.  I had got a job before me which promised\nbetter things than colleging at Edinburgh, and I was as keen to get up\ncountry now as I had been loth to leave England.  My mind being full of\nmysteries, I scanned every Portuguese loafer on the quay as if he had\nbeen a spy, and when Tam and I had had a bottle of Collates in a cafe I\nfelt that at last I had got to foreign parts and a new world.\n\nTam took me to supper with a friend of his, a Scot by the name of\nAitken, who was landing-agent for some big mining house on the Rand.\nHe hailed from Fife and gave me a hearty welcome, for he had heard my\nfather preach in his young days. Aitken was a strong, broad-shouldered\nfellow who had been a sergeant in the Gordons, and during the war he\nhad done secret-service work in Delagoa.  He had hunted, too, and\ntraded up and down Mozambique, and knew every dialect of the Kaffirs.\nHe asked me where I was bound for, and when I told him there was the\nsame look in his eyes as I had seen with the Durban manager.\n\n'You're going to a rum place, Mr Crawfurd,' he said.\n\n'So I'm told.  Do you know anything about it?  You're not the first who\nhas looked queer when I've spoken the name.'\n\n'I've never been there,' he said, 'though I've been pretty near it from\nthe Portuguese side.  That's the funny thing about\nBlaauwildebeestefontein.  Everybody has heard of it, and nobody knows\nit.'\n\n'I wish you would tell me what you have heard.'\n\n'Well, the natives are queer up thereaways.  There's some kind of a\nholy place which every Kaffir from Algoa Bay to the Zambesi and away\nbeyond knows about.  When I've been hunting in the bush-veld I've often\nmet strings of Kaffirs from hundreds of miles distant, and they've all\nbeen going or coming from Blaauwildebeestefontein.  It's like Mecca to\nthe Mohammedans, a place they go to on pilgrimage.  I've heard of an\nold man up there who is believed to be two hundred years old. Anyway,\nthere's some sort of great witch or wizard living in the mountains.'\n\nAitken smoked in silence for a time; then he said, 'I'll tell you\nanother thing.  I believe there's a diamond mine.  I've often meant to\ngo up and look for it.'\n\nTam and I pressed him to explain, which he did slowly after his fashion.\n\n'Did you ever hear of I.D.B.--illicit diamond broking?' he asked me.\n'Well, it's notorious that the Kaffirs on the diamond fields get away\nwith a fair number of stones, and they are bought by Jew and Portuguese\ntraders.  It's against the law to deal in them, and when I was in the\nintelligence here we used to have a lot of trouble with the vermin.\nBut I discovered that most of the stones came from natives in one part\nof the country--more or less round Blaauwildebeestefontein--and I see\nno reason to think that they had all been stolen from Kimberley or the\nPremier.  Indeed some of the stones I got hold of were quite different\nfrom any I had seen in South Africa before.  I shouldn't wonder if the\nKaffirs in the Zoutpansberg had struck some rich pipe, and had the\nsense to keep quiet about it.  Maybe some day I'll take a run up to see\nyou and look into the matter.'\n\nAfter this the talk turned on other topics till Tam, still nursing his\ngrievance, asked a question on his own account. 'Did you ever come\nacross a great big native parson called Laputa?  He came on board as we\nwere leaving Durban, and I had to turn out of my cabin for him.'  Tam\ndescribed him accurately but vindictively, and added that 'he was sure\nhe was up to no good.'\n\nAitken shook his head.  'No, I don't know the man.  You say he landed\nhere?  Well, I'll keep a look-out for him.  Big native parsons are not\nso common.'\n\nThen I asked about Henriques, of whom Tam knew nothing. I described his\nface, his clothes, and his habits.  Aitken laughed uproariously.\n\n'Tut, my man, most of the subjects of his Majesty the King of Portugal\nwould answer to that description.  If he's a rascal, as you think, you\nmay be certain he's in the I.D.B. business, and if I'm right about\nBlaauwildebeestefontein you'll likely have news of him there some time\nor other.  Drop me a line if he comes, and I'll get on to his record.'\n\nI saw Tam off in the boat with a fairly satisfied mind.  I was going to\na place with a secret, and I meant to find it out.  The natives round\nBlaauwildebeestefontein were queer, and diamonds were suspected\nsomewhere in the neighbourhood.\n\nHenriques had something to do with the place, and so had the Rev. John\nLaputa, about whom I knew one strange thing.  So did Tam by the way,\nbut he had not identified his former pursuer, and I had told him\nnothing.  I was leaving two men behind me, Colles at Durban and Aitken\nat Lourenco Marques, who would help me if trouble came.  Things were\nshaping well for some kind of adventure.\n\nThe talk with Aitken had given Tam an inkling of my thoughts.  His last\nwords to me were an appeal to let him know if there was any fun going.\n\n'I can see you're in for a queer job.  Promise to let me hear from you\nif there's going to be a row, and I'll come up country, though I should\nhave to desert the service.  Send us a letter to the agents at Durban\nin case we should be in port.  You haven't forgotten the Dyve Burn,\nDavie?'\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\nBLAAUWILDEBEESTEFONTEIN\n\nThe Pilgrim's Progress had been the Sabbath reading of my boyhood, and\nas I came in sight of Blaauwildebeestefontein a passage ran in my head.\nIt was that which tells how Christian and Hopeful, after many perils of\nthe way, came to the Delectable Mountains, from which they had a\nprospect of Canaan.  After many dusty miles by rail, and a weariful\njourney in a Cape-cart through arid plains and dry and stony gorges, I\nhad come suddenly into a haven of green.  The Spring of the Blue\nWildebeeste was a clear rushing mountain torrent, which swirled over\nblue rocks into deep fern-fringed pools.  All around was a tableland of\nlush grass with marigolds and arum lilies instead of daisies and\nbuttercups.  Thickets of tall trees dotted the hill slopes and patched\nthe meadows as if some landscape-gardener had been at work on them.\nBeyond, the glen fell steeply to the plains, which ran out in a faint\nhaze to the horizon.  To north and south I marked the sweep of the\nBerg, now rising high to a rocky peak and now stretching in a level\nrampart of blue.  On the very edge of the plateau where the road dipped\nfor the descent stood the shanties of Blaauwildebeestefontein. The\nfresh hill air had exhilarated my mind, and the aromatic scent of the\nevening gave the last touch of intoxication.  Whatever serpent might\nlurk in it, it was a veritable Eden I had come to.\n\nBlaauwildebeestefontein had no more than two buildings of civilized\nshape; the store, which stood on the left side of the river, and the\nschoolhouse opposite.  For the rest, there were some twenty native\nhuts, higher up the slope, of the type which the Dutch call _rondavels_.\nThe schoolhouse had a pretty garden, but the store stood bare in a\npatch of dust with a few outhouses and sheds beside it.  Round the door\nlay a few old ploughs and empty barrels, and beneath a solitary blue\ngum was a wooden bench with a rough table.  Native children played in\nthe dust, and an old Kaffir squatted by the wall.\n\nMy few belongings were soon lifted from the Cape-cart, and I entered\nthe shop.  It was the ordinary pattern of up-country store--a bar in\none corner with an array of bottles, and all round the walls tins of\ncanned food and the odds and ends of trade.  The place was empty, and a\ncloud of flies buzzed over the sugar cask.\n\nTwo doors opened at the back, and I chose the one to the right.  I\nfound myself in a kind of kitchen with a bed in one corner, and a\nlitter of dirty plates on the table.  On the bed lay a man, snoring\nheavily.  I went close to him, and found an old fellow with a bald\nhead, clothed only in a shirt and trousers. His face was red and\nswollen, and his breath came in heavy grunts.  A smell of bad whisky\nhung over everything.  I had no doubt that this was Mr Peter Japp, my\nsenior in the store.  One reason for the indifferent trade at\nBlaauwildebeestefontein was very clear to me: the storekeeper was a sot.\n\nI went back to the shop and tried the other door.  It was a bedroom\ntoo, but clean and pleasant.  A little native girl--Zeeta, I found they\ncalled her--was busy tidying it up, and when I entered she dropped me a\ncurtsy.  'This is your room, Baas,' she said in very good English in\nreply to my question. The child had been well trained somewhere, for\nthere was a cracked dish full of oleander blossom on the drawers'-head,\nand the pillow-slips on the bed were as clean as I could wish. She\nbrought me water to wash, and a cup of strong tea, while I carried my\nbaggage indoors and paid the driver of the cart. Then, having cleaned\nmyself and lit a pipe, I walked across the road to see Mr Wardlaw.\n\nI found the schoolmaster sitting under his own fig-tree reading one of\nhis Kaffir primers.  Having come direct by rail from Cape Town, he had\nbeen a week in the place, and ranked as the second oldest white\nresident.\n\n'Yon's a bonny chief you've got, Davie,' were his first words. 'For\nthree days he's been as fou as the Baltic.'\n\nI cannot pretend that the misdeeds of Mr Japp greatly annoyed me.  I\nhad the reversion of his job, and if he chose to play the fool it was\nall in my interest.  But the schoolmaster was depressed at the prospect\nof such company.  'Besides you and me, he's the only white man in the\nplace.  It's a poor look-out on the social side.'\n\nThe school, it appeared, was the merest farce.  There were only five\nwhite children, belonging to Dutch farmers in the mountains.  The\nnative side was more flourishing, but the mission schools at the\nlocations got most of the native children in the neighbourhood.  Mr\nWardlaw's educational zeal ran high.  He talked of establishing a\nworkshop and teaching carpentry and blacksmith's work, of which he knew\nnothing. He rhapsodized over the intelligence of his pupils and\nbemoaned his inadequate gift of tongues.  'You and I, Davie,' he said,\n'must sit down and grind at the business.  It is to the interest of\nboth of us.  The Dutch is easy enough.  It's a sort of kitchen dialect\nyou can learn in a fortnight.  But these native languages are a stiff\njob.  Sesuto is the chief hereabouts, and I'm told once you've got that\nit's easy to get the Zulu.  Then there's the thing the Shangaans\nspeak--Baronga, I think they call it.  I've got a Christian Kaffir\nliving up in one of the huts who comes every morning to talk to me for\nan hour.  You'd better join me.'\n\nI promised, and in the sweet-smelling dust crossed the road to the\nstore.  Japp was still sleeping, so I got a bowl of mealie porridge\nfrom Zeeta and went to bed.\n\n\nJapp was sober next morning and made me some kind of apology.  He had\nchronic lumbago, he said, and 'to go on the bust' now and then was the\nbest cure for it.  Then he proceeded to initiate me into my duties in a\ntone of exaggerated friendliness. 'I took a fancy to you the first time\nI clapped eyes on you,' he said.  'You and me will be good friends,\nCrawfurd, I can see that.  You're a spirited young fellow, and you'll\nstand no nonsense.  The Dutch about here are a slim lot, and the\nKaffirs are slimmer.  Trust no man, that's my motto.  The firm know\nthat, and I've had their confidence for forty years.'\n\nThe first day or two things went well enough.  There was no doubt that,\nproperly handled, a fine trade could be done in\nBlaauwildebeestefontein.  The countryside was crawling with natives,\nand great strings used to come through from Shangaan territory on the\nway to the Rand mines.  Besides, there was business to be done with the\nDutch farmers, especially with the tobacco, which I foresaw could be\nworked up into a profitable export.  There was no lack of money either,\nand we had to give very little credit, though it was often asked for.\nI flung myself into the work, and in a few weeks had been all round the\nfarms and locations.  At first Japp praised my energy, for it left him\nplenty of leisure to sit indoors and drink.  But soon he grew\nsuspicious, for he must have seen that I was in a fair way to oust him\naltogether.  He was very anxious to know if I had seen Colles in\nDurban, and what the manager had said.  'I have letters,' he told me a\nhundred times, 'from Mr Mackenzie himself praising me up to the skies.\nThe firm couldn't get along without old Peter Japp, I can tell you.'  I\nhad no wish to quarrel with the old man, so I listened politely to all\nhe said.  But this did not propitiate him, and I soon found him so\njealous as to be a nuisance.  He was Colonial-born and was always\nairing the fact.  He rejoiced in my rawness, and when I made a blunder\nwould crow over it for hours.  'It's no good, Mr Crawfurd; you new\nchums from England may think yourselves mighty clever, but we men from\nthe Old Colony can get ahead of you every time.  In fifty years you'll\nmaybe learn a little about the country, but we know all about it before\nwe start.'  He roared with laughter at my way of tying a _voorslag_, and\nhe made merry (no doubt with reason) on my management of a horse.  I\nkept my temper pretty well, but I own there were moments when I came\nnear to kicking Mr Japp.\n\nThe truth is he was a disgusting old ruffian.  His character was shown\nby his treatment of Zeeta.  The poor child slaved all day and did two\nmen's work in keeping the household going. She was an orphan from a\nmission station, and in Japp's opinion a creature without rights.\nHence he never spoke to her except with a curse, and used to cuff her\nthin shoulders till my blood boiled.  One day things became too much\nfor my temper. Zeeta had spilled half a glass of Japp's whisky while\ntidying up the room.  He picked up a sjambok, and proceeded to beat her\nunmercifully till her cries brought me on the scene.  I tore the whip\nfrom his hands, seized him by the scruff and flung him on a heap of\npotato sacks, where he lay pouring out abuse and shaking with rage.\nThen I spoke my mind.  I told him that if anything of the sort happened\nagain I would report it at once to Mr Colles at Durban.  I added that\nbefore making my report I would beat him within an inch of his degraded\nlife.  After a time he apologized, but I could see that thenceforth he\nregarded me with deadly hatred.\n\nThere was another thing I noticed about Mr Japp. He might brag about his\nknowledge of how to deal with natives, but to my mind his methods were a\ndisgrace to a white man. Zeeta came in for oaths and blows, but there\nwere other Kaffirs whom he treated with a sort of cringing friendliness.\nA big black fellow would swagger into the shop, and be received by Japp\nas if he were his long-lost brother. The two would collogue for hours;\nand though at first I did not understand the tongue, I could see that it\nwas the white man who fawned and the black man who bullied. Once when\nJapp was away one of these fellows came into the store as if it belonged\nto him, but he went out quicker than he entered. Japp complained\nafterwards of my behaviour. ''Mwanga is a good friend of mine,' he said,\n'and brings us a lot of business. I'll thank you to be civil to him the\nnext time.' I replied very shortly that 'Mwanga or anybody else who did\nnot mend his manners would feel the weight of my boot.\n\n\n\nThe thing went on, and I am not sure that he did not give the Kaffirs\ndrink on the sly.  At any rate, I have seen some very drunk natives on\nthe road between the locations and Blaauwildebeestefontein, and some of\nthem I recognized as Japp's friends.  I discussed the matter with Mr\nWardlaw, who said, 'I believe the old villain has got some sort of\nblack secret, and the natives know it, and have got a pull on him.'\nAnd I was inclined to think he was right.\n\n\nBy-and-by I began to feel the lack of company, for Wardlaw was so full\nof his books that he was of little use as a companion. So I resolved to\nacquire a dog, and bought one from a prospector, who was stony-broke\nand would have sold his soul for a drink.  It was an enormous Boer\nhunting-dog, a mongrel in whose blood ran mastiff and bulldog and\nfoxhound, and Heaven knows what beside.  In colour it was a kind of\nbrindled red, and the hair on its back grew against the lie of the rest\nof its coat.  Some one had told me, or I may have read it, that a back\nlike this meant that a dog would face anything mortal, even to a\ncharging lion, and it was this feature which first caught my fancy.\nThe price I paid was ten shillings and a pair of boots, which I got at\ncost price from stock, and the owner departed with injunctions to me to\nbeware of the brute's temper.  Colin--for so I named him--began his\ncareer with me by taking the seat out of my breeches and frightening Mr\nWardlaw into a tree.  It took me a stubborn battle of a fortnight to\nbreak his vice, and my left arm to-day bears witness to the struggle.\nAfter that he became a second shadow, and woe betide the man who had\ndared to raise his hand to Colin's master.  Japp declared that the dog\nwas a devil, and Colin repaid the compliment with a hearty dislike.\n\nWith Colin, I now took to spending some of my ample leisure in\nexploring the fastnesses of the Berg.  I had brought out a shot-gun of\nmy own, and I borrowed a cheap Mauser sporting rifle from the store.  I\nhad been born with a good eye and a steady hand, and very soon I became\na fair shot with a gun and, I believe, a really fine shot with the\nrifle.  The sides of the Berg were full of quail and partridge and bush\npheasant, and on the grassy plateau there was abundance of a bird not\nunlike our own blackcock, which the Dutch called _korhaan_. But the great\nsport was to stalk bush-buck in the thickets, which is a game in which\nthe hunter is at small advantage.  I have been knocked down by a\nwounded bush-buck ram, and but for Colin might have been badly damaged.\nOnce, in a kloof not far from the Letaba, I killed a fine leopard,\nbringing him down with a single shot from a rocky shelf almost on the\ntop of Colin.  His skin lies by my fireside as I write this tale.  But\nit was during the days I could spare for an expedition into the plains\nthat I proved the great qualities of my dog.  There we had nobler game\nto follow--wildebeest and hartebeest, impala, and now and then a\nkoodoo.  At first I was a complete duffer, and shamed myself in Colin's\neyes.  But by-and-by I learned something of veld-craft: I learned how\nto follow spoor, how to allow for the wind, and stalk under cover.\nThen, when a shot had crippled the beast, Colin was on its track like a\nflash to pull it down.  The dog had the nose of a retriever, the speed\nof a greyhound, and the strength of a bull-terrier.  I blessed the day\nwhen the wandering prospector had passed the store.\n\nColin slept at night at the foot of my bed, and it was he who led me to\nmake an important discovery.  For I now became aware that I was being\nsubjected to constant espionage.  It may have been going on from the\nstart, but it was not till my third month at Blaauwildebeestefontein\nthat I found it out.  One night I was going to bed, when suddenly the\nbristles rose on the dog's back and he barked uneasily at the window.\nI had been standing in the shadow, and as I stepped to the window to\nlook out I saw a black face disappear below the palisade of the\nbackyard.  The incident was trifling, but it put me on my guard.  The\nnext night I looked, but saw nothing.  The third night I looked, and\ncaught a glimpse of a face almost pressed to the pane.  Thereafter I\nput up the shutters after dark, and shifted my bed to a part of the\nroom out of line with the window.\n\nIt was the same out of doors.  I would suddenly be conscious, as I\nwalked on the road, that I was being watched.  If I made as if to walk\ninto the roadside bush there would be a faint rustling, which told that\nthe watcher had retired.  The stalking was brilliantly done, for I\nnever caught a glimpse of one of the stalkers.  Wherever I went--on the\nroad, on the meadows of the plateau, or on the rugged sides of the\nBerg--it was the same.  I had silent followers, who betrayed themselves\nnow and then by the crackling of a branch, and eyes were always looking\nat me which I could not see.  Only when I went down to the plains did\nthe espionage cease.  This thing annoyed Colin desperately, and his\nwalks abroad were one continuous growl. Once, in spite of my efforts,\nhe dashed into the thicket, and a squeal of pain followed.  He had got\nsomebody by the leg, and there was blood on the grass.\n\nSince I came to Blaauwildebeestefontein I had forgotten the mystery I\nhad set out to track in the excitement of a new life and my sordid\ncontest with Japp.  But now this espionage brought back my old\npreoccupation.  I was being watched because some person or persons\nthought that I was dangerous. My suspicions fastened on Japp, but I\nsoon gave up that clue. It was my presence in the store that was a\ndanger to him, not my wanderings about the countryside.  It might be\nthat he had engineered the espionage so as to drive me out of the place\nin sheer annoyance; but I flattered myself that Mr Japp knew me too\nwell to imagine that such a game was likely to succeed.\n\nThe mischief was that I could not make out who the trackers were.  I\nhad visited all the surrounding locations, and was on good enough terms\nwith all the chiefs.  There was 'Mpefu, a dingy old fellow who had\nspent a good deal of his life in a Boer gaol before the war.  There was\na mission station at his place, and his people seemed to me to be well\nbehaved and prosperous. Majinje was a chieftainess, a little girl whom\nnobody was allowed to see.  Her location was a miserable affair, and\nher tribe was yearly shrinking in numbers.  Then there was Magata\nfarther north among the mountains.  He had no quarrel with me, for he\nused to give me a meal when I went out hunting in that direction; and\nonce he turned out a hundred of his young men, and I had a great battue\nof wild dogs.  Sikitola, the biggest of all, lived some distance out in\nthe flats.  I knew less about him; but if his men were the trackers,\nthey must have spent most of their days a weary way from their kraal.\nThe Kaffirs in the huts at Blaauwildebeestefontein were mostly\nChristians, and quiet, decent fellows, who farmed their little gardens,\nand certainly preferred me to Japp.  I thought at one time of riding\ninto Pietersdorp to consult the Native Commissioner.  But I discovered\nthat the old man, who knew the country, was gone, and that his\nsuccessor was a young fellow from Rhodesia, who knew nothing about\nanything.  Besides, the natives round Blaauwildebeestefontein were well\nconducted, and received few official visitations.  Now and then a\ncouple of Zulu policemen passed in pursuit of some minor malefactor,\nand the collector came for the hut-tax; but we gave the Government\nlittle work, and they did not trouble their heads about us.\n\nAs I have said, the clues I had brought out with me to\nBlaauwildebeestefontein began to occupy my mind again; and the more I\nthought of the business the keener I grew.  I used to amuse myself with\nsetting out my various bits of knowledge. There was first of all the\nRev. John Laputa, his doings on the Kirkcaple shore, his talk with\nHenriques about Blaauwildebeestefontein, and his strange behaviour at\nDurban. Then there was what Colles had told me about the place being\nqueer, how nobody would stay long either in the store or the\nschoolhouse.  Then there was my talk with Aitken at Lourenco Marques,\nand his story of a great wizard in the neighbourhood to whom all\nKaffirs made pilgrimages, and the suspicion of a diamond pipe.  Last\nand most important, there was this perpetual spying on myself.  It was\nas clear as daylight that the place held some secret, and I wondered if\nold Japp knew.  I was fool enough one day to ask him about diamonds.\nHe met me with contemptuous laughter.  'There's your ignorant\nBritisher,' he cried.  'If you had ever been to Kimberley you would\nknow the look of a diamond country.  You're as likely to find diamonds\nhere as ocean pearls.  But go out and scrape in the spruit if you like;\nyou'll maybe find some garnets.'\n\nI made cautious inquiries, too, chiefly through Mr Wardlaw, who was\nbecoming a great expert at Kaffir, about the existence of Aitken's\nwizard, but he could get no news.  The most he found out was that there\nwas a good cure for fever among Sikitola's men, and that Majinje, if\nshe pleased, could bring rain.\n\nThe upshot of it all was that, after much brooding, I wrote a letter to\nMr Colles, and, to make sure of its going, gave it to a missionary to\npost in Pietersdorp.  I told him frankly what Aitken had said, and I\nalso told him about the espionage.  I said nothing about old Japp, for,\nbeast as he was, I did not want him at his age to be without a\nlivelihood.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\nMY JOURNEY TO THE WINTER-VELD\n\nA reply came from Colles, addressed not to me but to Japp. It seemed\nthat the old fellow had once suggested the establishment of a branch\nstore at a place out in the plains called Umvelos', and the firm was\nnow prepared to take up the scheme.  Japp was in high good humour, and\nshowed me the letter.  Not a word was said of what I had written about,\nonly the bare details about starting the branch.  I was to get a couple\nof masons, load up two wagons with bricks and timber, and go down to\nUmvelos' and see the store built.  The stocking of it and the\nappointment of a storekeeper would be matter for further\ncorrespondence.  Japp was delighted, for, besides getting rid of me for\nseveral weeks, it showed that his advice was respected by his\nsuperiors.  He went about bragging that the firm could not get on\nwithout him, and was inclined to be more insolent to me than usual in\nhis new self-esteem.  He also got royally drunk over the head of it.\n\nI confess I was hurt by the manager's silence on what seemed to me more\nvital matters.  But I soon reflected that if he wrote at all he would\nwrite direct to me, and I eagerly watched for the post-runner.  No\nletter came, however, and I was soon too busy with preparations to look\nfor one.  I got the bricks and timber from Pietersdorp, and hired two\nDutch masons to run the job.  The place was not very far from\nSikitola's kraal, so there would be no difficulty about native helpers.\nHaving my eyes open for trade, I resolved to kill two birds with one\nstone.  It was the fashion among the old-fashioned farmers on the\nhigh-veld to drive the cattle down into the bush-veld--which they call\nthe winter-veld--for winter pasture.  There is no fear of red-water\nabout that season, and the grass of the plains is rich and thick\ncompared with the uplands.  I discovered that some big droves were\npassing on a certain day, and that the owners and their families were\ntravelling with them in wagons.  Accordingly I had a light _naachtmaal_\nfitted up as a sort of travelling store, and with my two wagons full of\nbuilding material joined the caravan.  I hoped to do good trade in\nselling little luxuries to the farmers on the road and at Umvelos'.\n\nIt was a clear cold morning when we started down the Berg. At first my\nhands were full with the job of getting my heavy wagons down the\nawesome precipice which did duty as a highway.  We locked the wheels\nwith chains, and tied great logs of wood behind to act as brakes.\nHappily my drivers knew their business, but one of the Boer wagons got\na wheel over the edge, and it was all that ten men could do to get it\nback again.\n\nAfter that the road was easier, winding down the side of a slowly\nopening glen.  I rode beside the wagons, and so heavenly was the\nweather that I was content with my own thoughts. The sky was clear\nblue, the air warm, yet with a wintry tonic in it, and a thousand\naromatic scents came out of the thickets. The pied birds called 'Kaffir\nqueens' fluttered across the path. Below, the Klein Labongo churned and\nfoamed in a hundred cascades.  Its waters were no more the clear grey\nof the 'Blue Wildebeeste's Spring,' but growing muddy with its approach\nto the richer soil of the plains.\n\nOxen travel slow, and we outspanned that night half a day's march short\nof Umvelos'.  I spent the hour before sunset lounging and smoking with\nthe Dutch farmers.  At first they had been silent and suspicious of a\nnewcomer, but by this time I talked their taal fluently, and we were\nsoon on good terms. I recall a discussion arising about a black thing\nin a tree about five hundred yards away.  I thought it was an aasvogel,\nbut another thought it was a baboon.  Whereupon the oldest of the\nparty, a farmer called Coetzee, whipped up his rifle and, apparently\nwithout sighting, fired.  A dark object fell out of the branch, and\nwhen we reached it we found it a _baviaan_[1] sure enough, shot through\nthe head.  'Which side are you on in the next war?' the old man asked\nme, and, laughing, I told him 'Yours.'\n\nAfter supper, the ingredients of which came largely from my _naachtmaal_,\nwe sat smoking and talking round the fire, the women and children being\nsnug in the covered wagons.  The Boers were honest companionable\nfellows, and when I had made a bowl of toddy in the Scotch fashion to\nkeep out the evening chill, we all became excellent friends.  They\nasked me how I got on with Japp.  Old Coetzee saved me the trouble of\nanswering, for he broke in with _Skellum_!  _Skellum_![2]  I asked him his\nobjection to the storekeeper, but he would say nothing beyond that he\nwas too thick with the natives.  I fancy at some time Mr Japp had sold\nhim a bad plough.\n\nWe spoke of hunting, and I heard long tales of exploits--away on the\nLimpopo, in Mashonaland, on the Sabi and in the Lebombo.  Then we\nverged on politics, and I listened to violent denunciations of the new\nland tax.  These were old residenters, I reflected, and I might learn\nperhaps something of value.  So very carefully I repeated a tale I said\nI had heard at Durban of a great wizard somewhere in the Berg, and\nasked if any one knew of it.  They shook their heads.  The natives had\ngiven up witchcraft and big medicine, they said, and were more afraid\nof a parson or a policeman than any witch-doctor. Then they were\nstarting on reminiscences, when old Coetzee, who was deaf, broke in and\nasked to have my question repeated.\n\n'Yes,' he said, 'I know.  It is in the Rooirand.  There is a devil\ndwells there.'\n\nI could get no more out of him beyond the fact that there was certainly\na great devil there.  His grandfather and father had seen it, and he\nhimself had heard it roaring when he had gone there as a boy to hunt.\nHe would explain no further, and went to bed.\n\nNext morning, close to Sikitola's kraal, I bade the farmers good-bye,\nafter telling them that there would be a store in my wagon for three\nweeks at Umvelos' if they wanted supplies. We then struck more to the\nnorth towards our destination.  As soon as they had gone I had out my\nmap and searched it for the name old Coetzee had mentioned.  It was a\nvery bad map, for there had been no surveying east of the Berg, and\nmost of the names were mere guesses.  But I found the word 'Rooirand'\nmarking an eastern continuation of the northern wall, and probably set\ndown from some hunter's report.  I had better explain here the chief\nfeatures of the country, for they bulk largely in my story.  The Berg\nruns north and south, and from it run the chief streams which water the\nplain.  They are, beginning from the south, the Olifants, the Groot\nLetaba, the Letsitela, the Klein Letaba, and the Klein Labongo, on\nwhich stands Blaauwildebeestefontein.  But the greatest river of the\nplain, into which the others ultimately flow, is the Groot Labongo,\nwhich appears full-born from some subterranean source close to the\nplace called Umvelos'.  North from Blaauwildebeestefontein the Berg\nruns for some twenty miles, and then makes a sharp turn eastward,\nbecoming, according to my map, the Rooirand.\n\nI pored over these details, and was particularly curious about the\nGreat Labongo.  It seemed to me unlikely that a spring in the bush\ncould produce so great a river, and I decided that its source must lie\nin the mountains to the north.  As well as I could guess, the Rooirand,\nthe nearest part of the Berg, was about thirty miles distant.  Old\nCoetzee had said that there was a devil in the place, but I thought\nthat if it were explored the first thing found would be a fine stream\nof water.\n\nWe got to Umvelos' after midday, and outspanned for our three weeks'\nwork.  I set the Dutchmen to unload and clear the ground for\nfoundations, while I went off to Sikitola to ask for labourers.  I got\na dozen lusty blacks, and soon we had a business-like encampment, and\nthe work went on merrily.  It was rough architecture and rougher\nmasonry.  All we aimed at was a two-roomed shop with a kind of outhouse\nfor stores.  I was architect, and watched the marking out of the\nfoundations and the first few feet of the walls.  Sikitola's people\nproved themselves good helpers, and most of the building was left to\nthem, while the Dutchmen worked at the carpentry.  Bricks ran short\nbefore we got very far, and we had to set to brick-making on the bank\nof the Labongo, and finish off the walls with green bricks, which gave\nthe place a queer piebald look.\n\nI was not much of a carpenter, and there were plenty of builders\nwithout me, so I found a considerable amount of time on my hands.  At\nfirst I acted as shopkeeper in the _naachtmaal_, but I soon cleared out\nmy stores to the Dutch farmers and the natives.  I had thought of going\nback for more, and then it occurred to me that I might profitably give\nsome of my leisure to the Rooirand.  I could see the wall of the\nmountains quite clear to the north, within an easy day's ride.  So one\nmorning I packed enough food for a day or two, tied my sleeping-bag on\nmy saddle, and set off to explore, after appointing the elder of the\nDutchmen foreman of the job in my absence.\n\nIt was very hot jogging along the native path with the eternal\nolive-green bush around me.  Happily there was no fear of losing the\nway, for the Rooirand stood very clear in front, and slowly, as I\nadvanced, I began to make out the details of the cliffs.  At\nluncheon-time, when I was about half-way, I sat down with my Zeiss\nglass--my mother's farewell gift--to look for the valley.  But valley I\nsaw none.  The wall--reddish purple it looked, and, I thought, of\nporphyry--was continuous and unbroken.  There were chimneys and\nfissures, but none great enough to hold a river.  The top was sheer\ncliff; then came loose kranzes in tiers, like the seats in a gallery,\nand, below, a dense thicket of trees.  I raked the whole line for a\nbreak, but there seemed none.  'It's a bad job for me,' I thought, 'if\nthere is no water, for I must pass the night there.' The night was\nspent in a sheltered nook at the foot of the rocks, but my horse and I\nwent to bed without a drink.  My supper was some raisins and biscuits,\nfor I did not dare to run the risk of increasing my thirst.  I had\nfound a great bank of _d\u00c3\u00a9bris_ sloping up to the kranzes, and thick wood\nclothing all the slope.  The grass seemed wonderfully fresh, but of\nwater there was no sign.  There was not even the sandy channel of a\nstream to dig in.\n\nIn the morning I had a difficult problem to face.  Water I must find at\nall costs, or I must go home.  There was time enough for me to get back\nwithout suffering much, but if so I must give up my explorations.  This\nI was determined not to do.  The more I looked at these red cliffs the\nmore eager I was to find out their secret.  There must be water\nsomewhere; otherwise how account for the lushness of the vegetation?\n\nMy horse was a veld pony, so I set him loose to see what he would do.\nHe strayed back on the path to Umvelos'.  This looked bad, for it meant\nthat he did not smell water along the cliff front.  If I was to find a\nstream it must be on the top, and I must try a little mountaineering.\n\nThen, taking my courage in both my hands, I decided.  I gave my pony a\ncut, and set him off on the homeward road.  I knew he was safe to get\nback in four or five hours, and in broad day there was little fear of\nwild beasts attacking him.  I had tied my sleeping bag on to the\nsaddle, and had with me but two pocketfuls of food.  I had also\nfastened on the saddle a letter to my Dutch foreman, bidding him send a\nnative with a spare horse to fetch me by the evening.  Then I started\noff to look for a chimney.\n\nA boyhood spent on the cliffs at Kirkcaple had made me a bold cragsman,\nand the porphyry of the Rooirand clearly gave excellent holds.  But I\nwalked many weary miles along the cliff-foot before I found a feasible\nroad.  To begin with, it was no light task to fight one's way through\nthe dense undergrowth of the lower slopes.  Every kind of thorn-bush\nlay in wait for my skin, creepers tripped me up, high trees shut out\nthe light, and I was in constant fear lest a black _mamba_ might appear\nout of the tangle.  It grew very hot, and the screes above the thicket\nwere blistering to the touch.  My tongue, too, stuck to the roof of my\nmouth with thirst.\n\nThe first chimney I tried ran out on the face into nothingness, and I\nhad to make a dangerous descent.  The second was a deep gully, but so\nchoked with rubble that after nearly braining myself I desisted.  Still\ngoing eastwards, I found a sloping ledge which took me to a platform\nfrom which ran a crack with a little tree growing in it.  My glass\nshowed me that beyond this tree the crack broadened into a clearly\ndefined chimney which led to the top.  If I can once reach that tree, I\nthought, the battle is won. The crack was only a few inches wide, large\nenough to let in an arm and a foot, and it ran slantwise up a\nperpendicular rock.  I do not think I realized how bad it was till I\nhad gone too far to return.  Then my foot jammed, and I paused for\nbreath with my legs and arms cramping rapidly.  I remember that I\nlooked to the west, and saw through the sweat which kept dropping into\nmy eyes that about half a mile off a piece of cliff which looked\nunbroken from the foot had a fold in it to the right.  The darkness of\nthe fold showed me that it was a deep, narrow gully.  However, I had no\ntime to think of this, for I was fast in the middle of my confounded\ncrack.  With immense labour I found a chockstone above my head, and\nmanaged to force my foot free.  The next few yards were not so\ndifficult, and then I stuck once more.\n\nFor the crack suddenly grew shallow as the cliff bulged out above me.\nI had almost given up hope, when I saw that about three feet above my\nhead grew the tree.  If I could reach it and swing out I might hope to\npull myself up to the ledge on which it grew.  I confess it needed all\nmy courage, for I did not know but that the tree might be loose, and\nthat it and I might go rattling down four hundred feet.  It was my only\nhope, however, so I set my teeth, and wriggling up a few inches, made a\ngrab at it.  Thank God it held, and with a great effort I pulled my\nshoulder over the ledge, and breathed freely.\n\nMy difficulties were not ended, but the worst was past.  The rest of\nthe gully gave me good and safe climbing, and presently a very limp and\nweary figure lay on the cliff-top.  It took me many minutes to get back\nmy breath and to conquer the faintness which seized me as soon as the\nneed for exertion was over.\n\nWhen I scrambled to my feet and looked round, I saw a wonderful\nprospect.  It was a plateau like the high-veld, only covered with\nbracken and little bushes like hazels.  Three or four miles off the\nground rose, and a shallow vale opened.  But in the foreground, half a\nmile or so distant, a lake lay gleaming in the sun.\n\nI could scarcely believe my eyes as I ran towards it, and doubts of a\nmirage haunted me.  But it was no mirage, but a real lake, perhaps\nthree miles in circumference, with bracken-fringed banks, a shore of\nwhite pebbles, and clear deep blue water.  I drank my fill, and then\nstripped and swam in the blessed coolness.  After that I ate some\nluncheon, and sunned myself on a flat rock.  'I have discovered the\nsource of the Labongo,' I said to myself.  'I will write to the Royal\nGeographical Society, and they will give me a medal.'\n\nI walked round the lake to look for an outlet.  A fine mountain stream\ncame in at the north end, and at the south end, sure enough, a\nconsiderable river debauched.  My exploring zeal redoubled, and I\nfollowed its course in a delirium of expectation.  It was a noble\nstream, clear as crystal, and very unlike the muddy tropical Labongo at\nUmvelos'.  Suddenly, about a quarter of a mile from the lake, the land\nseemed to grow over it, and with a swirl and a hollow roar, it\ndisappeared into a mighty pot-hole.  I walked a few steps on, and from\nbelow my feet came the most uncanny rumbling and groaning. Then I knew\nwhat old Coetzee's devil was that howled in the Rooirand.\n\nHad I continued my walk to the edge of the cliff, I might have learned\na secret which would have stood me in good stead later.  But the\ndescent began to make me anxious, and I retraced my steps to the top of\nthe chimney whence I had come.  I was resolved that nothing would make\nme descend by that awesome crack, so I kept on eastward along the top\nto look for a better way.  I found one about a mile farther on, which,\nthough far from easy, had no special risks save from the appalling\nlooseness of the _d\u00c3\u00a9bris_.  When I got down at length, I found that it\nwas near sunset.  I went to the place I had bidden my native look for\nme at, but, as I had feared, there was no sign of him.  So, making the\nbest of a bad job, I had supper and a pipe, and spent a very chilly\nnight in a hole among the boulders.\n\nI got up at dawn stiff and cold, and ate a few raisins for breakfast.\nThere was no sign of horses, so I resolved to fill up the time in\nlooking for the fold of the cliff which, as I had seen from the\nhorrible crack of yesterday, contained a gully.  It was a difficult\njob, for to get the sidelong view of the cliff I had to scramble\nthrough the undergrowth of the slopes again, and even a certain way up\nthe kranzes.  At length I got my bearings, and fixed the place by some\ntall trees in the bush.  Then I descended and walked westwards.\n\nSuddenly, as I neared the place, I heard the strangest sound coming\nfrom the rocks.  It was a deep muffled groaning, so eerie and unearthly\nthat for the moment I stood and shivered. Then I remembered my river of\nyesterday.  It must be above this place that it descended into the\nearth, and in the hush of dawn the sound was naturally louder.  No\nwonder old Coetzee had been afraid of devils.  It reminded me of the\nlines in _Marmion_--\n\n     'Diving as if condemned to lave\n     Some demon's subterranean cave,\n     Who, prisoned by enchanter's spell,\n     Shakes the dark rock with groan and yell.'\n\nWhile I was standing awestruck at the sound, I observed a figure moving\ntowards the cliffs.  I was well in cover, so I could not have been\nnoticed.  It was a very old man, very tall, but bowed in the shoulders,\nwho was walking slowly with bent head.  He could not have been thirty\nyards from me, so I had a clear view of his face.  He was a native, but\nof a type I had never seen before.  A long white beard fell on his\nbreast, and a magnificent kaross of leopard skin covered his shoulders.\nHis face was seamed and lined and shrunken, so that he seemed as old as\nTime itself.\n\nVery carefully I crept after him, and found myself opposite the fold\nwhere the gully was.  There was a clear path through the jungle, a path\nworn smooth by many feet.  I followed it through the undergrowth and\nover the screes till it turned inside the fold of the gully.  And then\nit stopped short.  I was in a deep cleft, but in front was a slab of\nsheer rock.  Above, the gully looked darker and deeper, but there was\nthis great slab to pass.  I examined the sides, but they were sheer\nrock with no openings.\n\nHad I had my wits about me, I would have gone back and followed the\nspoor, noting where it stopped.  But the whole thing looked black magic\nto me; my stomach was empty and my enterprise small.  Besides, there\nwas the terrible moaning of the imprisoned river in my ears.  I am\nashamed to confess it, but I ran from that gully as if the devil and\nall his angels had been following me.  Indeed, I did not slacken till I\nhad put a good mile between me and those uncanny cliffs.  After that I\nset out to foot it back.  If the horses would not come to me I must go\nto them.\n\nI walked twenty-five miles in a vile temper, enraged at my Dutchmen, my\nnatives, and everybody.  The truth is, I had been frightened, and my\npride was sore about it.  It grew very hot, the sand rose and choked\nme, the mopani trees with their dull green wearied me, the 'Kaffir\nqueens' and jays and rollers which flew about the path seemed to be\nthere to mock me. About half-way home I found a boy and two horses, and\nroundly I cursed him.  It seemed that my pony had returned right\nenough, and the boy had been sent to fetch me.  He had got half-way\nbefore sunset the night before, and there he had stayed.  I discovered\nfrom him that he was scared to death, and did not dare go any nearer\nthe Rooirand.  It was accursed, he said, for it was an abode of devils,\nand only wizards went near it.  I was bound to admit to myself that I\ncould not blame him. At last I had got on the track of something\ncertain about this mysterious country, and all the way back I wondered\nif I should have the courage to follow it up.\n\n\n[1] Baboon.\n\n[2] Schelm: Rascal.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\nMR WARDLAW HAS A PREMONITION\n\nA week later the building job was finished, I locked the door of the\nnew store, pocketed the key, and we set out for home. Sikitola was\nentrusted with the general care of it, and I knew him well enough to be\nsure that he would keep his people from doing mischief.  I left my\nempty wagons to follow at their leisure and rode on, with the result\nthat I arrived at Blaauwildebeestefontein two days before I was looked\nfor.\n\nI stabled my horse, and went round to the back to see Colin. (I had\nleft him at home in case of fights with native dogs, for he was an ill\nbeast in a crowd.) I found him well and hearty, for Zeeta had been\nlooking after him.  Then some whim seized me to enter the store through\nmy bedroom window.  It was open, and I crawled softly in to find the\nroom fresh and clean from Zeeta's care.  The door was ajar, and,\nhearing voices, I peeped into the shop.\n\nJapp was sitting on the counter talking in a low voice to a big\nnative--the same 'Mwanga whom I had bundled out unceremoniously.  I\nnoticed that the outer door giving on the road was shut, a most unusual\nthing in the afternoon.  Japp had some small objects in his hand, and\nthe two were evidently arguing about a price.  I had no intention at\nfirst of eavesdropping, and was just about to push the door open, when\nsomething in Japp's face arrested me.  He was up to no good, and I\nthought it my business to wait.\n\nThe low tones went on for a little, both men talking in Kaffir, and\nthen Japp lifted up one of the little objects between finger and thumb.\nIt was a small roundish stone about the size of a bean, but even in\nthat half light there was a dull lustre in it.\n\nAt that I shoved the door open and went in.  Both men started as if\nthey had been shot.  Japp went as white as his mottled face permitted.\n'What the--' he gasped, and he dropped the thing he was holding.\n\nI picked it up, and laid it on the counter.  'So,' I said, 'diamonds,\nMr Japp.  You have found the pipe I was looking for.  I congratulate\nyou.'\n\nMy words gave the old ruffian his cue.  'Yes, yes,' he said, 'I have,\nor rather my friend 'Mwanga has.  He has just been telling me about it.'\n\nThe Kaffir looked miserably uncomfortable.  He shifted from one leg to\nthe other, casting longing glances at the closed door.\n\n'I tink I go,' he said.  'Afterwards we will speak more.'\n\nI told him I thought he had better go, and opened the door for him.\nThen I bolted it again, and turned to Mr Japp.\n\n'So that's your game,' I said.  'I thought there was something funny\nabout you, but I didn't know it was I.D.B. you were up to.'\n\nHe looked as if he could kill me.  For five minutes he cursed me with a\nperfection of phrase which I had thought beyond him.  It was no I.D.B.,\nhe declared, but a pipe which 'Mwanga had discovered. 'In this kind of\ncountry?' I said, quoting his own words. 'Why, you might as well expect\nto find ocean pearls as diamonds.  But scrape in the spruit if you\nlike; you'll maybe find some garnets.'\n\nHe choked down his wrath, and tried a new tack.  'What will you take to\nhold your tongue?  I'll make you a rich man if you'll come in with me.'\nAnd then he started with offers which showed that he had been making a\ngood thing out of the traffic.\n\nI stalked over to him, and took him by the shoulder.  'You old\nreprobate,' I roared, 'if you breathe such a proposal to me again, I'll\ntie you up like a sack and carry you to Pietersdorp.'\n\nAt this he broke down and wept maudlin tears, disgusting to witness.\nHe said he was an old man who had always lived honestly, and it would\nbreak his heart if his grey hairs were to be disgraced.  As he sat\nrocking himself with his hands over his face, I saw his wicked little\neyes peering through the slits of his fingers to see what my next move\nwould be.\n\n'See here, Mr Japp,' I said, 'I'm not a police spy, and it's no\nbusiness of mine to inform against you.  I'm willing to keep you out of\ngaol, but it must be on my own conditions.  The first is that you\nresign this job and clear out.  You will write to Mr Colles a letter at\nmy dictation, saying that you find the work too much for you.  The\nsecond is that for the time you remain here the diamond business must\nutterly cease.  If 'Mwanga or anybody like him comes inside the store,\nand if I get the slightest hint that you're back at the trade, in you\ngo to Pietersdorp.  I'm not going to have my name disgraced by being\nassociated with you.  The third condition is that when you leave this\nplace you go clear away.  If you come within twenty miles of\nBlaauwildebeestefontein and I find you, I will give you up.'\n\nHe groaned and writhed at my terms, but in the end accepted them.  He\nwrote the letter, and I posted it.  I had no pity for the old scamp,\nwho had feathered his nest well.  Small wonder that the firm's business\nwas not as good as it might be, when Japp was giving most of his time\nto buying diamonds from native thieves.  The secret put him in the\npower of any Kaffir who traded him a stone.  No wonder he cringed to\nruffians like 'Mwanga.\n\nThe second thing I did was to shift my quarters.  Mr Wardlaw had a\nspare room which he had offered me before, and now I accepted it.  I\nwanted to be no more mixed up with Japp than I could help, for I did\nnot know what villainy he might let me in for.  Moreover, I carried\nZeeta with me, being ashamed to leave her at the mercy of the old\nbully.  Japp went up to the huts and hired a slattern to mind his\nhouse, and then drank heavily for three days to console himself.\n\nThat night I sat smoking with Mr Wardlaw in his sitting-room, where a\nwelcome fire burned, for the nights on the Berg were chilly.  I\nremember the occasion well for the queer turn the conversation took.\nWardlaw, as I have said, had been working like a slave at the Kaffir\ntongues.  I talked a kind of Zulu well enough to make myself\nunderstood, and I could follow it when spoken; but he had real\nscholarship in the thing, and knew all about the grammar and the\ndifferent dialects. Further, he had read a lot about native history,\nand was full of the doings of Tchaka and Mosilikatse and Moshesh, and\nthe kings of old.  Having little to do in the way of teaching, he had\nmade up for it by reading omnivorously.  He used to borrow books from\nthe missionaries, and he must have spent half his salary in buying new\nones.\n\nTo-night as he sat and puffed in his armchair, he was full of stories\nabout a fellow called Monomotapa.  It seems he was a great black\nemperor whom the Portuguese discovered about the sixteenth century.  He\nlived to the north in Mashonaland, and had a mountain full of gold.\nThe Portuguese did not make much of him, but they got his son and\nturned him into a priest.\n\nI told Wardlaw that he was most likely only a petty chief, whose\nexploits were magnified by distance, the same as the caciques in\nMexico.  But the schoolmaster would not accept this.\n\n'He must have been a big man, Davie.  You know that the old ruins in\nRhodesia, called Zimbabwe, were long believed to be Phoenician in\norigin.  I have a book here which tells all about them.  But now it is\nbelieved that they were built by natives.  I maintain that the men who\ncould erect piles like that'--and he showed me a picture--'were\nsomething more than petty chiefs.'\n\nPresently the object of this conversation appeared.  Mr Wardlaw thought\nthat we were underrating the capacity of the native.  This opinion was\nnatural enough in a schoolmaster, but not in the precise form Wardlaw\nput it.  It was not his intelligence which he thought we underrated,\nbut his dangerousness.  His reasons, shortly, were these: There were\nfive or six of them to every white man; they were all, roughly\nspeaking, of the same stock, with the same tribal beliefs; they had\nonly just ceased being a warrior race, with a powerful military\ndiscipline; and, most important, they lived round the rim of the\nhigh-veld plateau, and if they combined could cut off the white man\nfrom the sea.  I pointed out to him that it would only be a matter of\ntime before we opened the road again.  'Ay,' he said, 'but think of\nwhat would happen before then.  Think of the lonely farms and the\nlittle dorps wiped out of the map.  It would be a second and bloodier\nIndian mutiny. 'I'm not saying it's likely,' he went on, 'but I\nmaintain it's possible.  Supposing a second Tchaka turned up, who could\nget the different tribes to work together.  It wouldn't be so very hard\nto smuggle in arms.  Think of the long, unwatched coast in Gazaland and\nTongaland.  If they got a leader with prestige enough to organize a\ncrusade against the white man, I don't see what could prevent a rising.'\n\n'We should get wind of it in time to crush it at the start,' I said.\n\n'I'm not so sure.  They are cunning fellows, and have arts that we know\nnothing about.  You have heard of native telepathy.  They can send news\nover a thousand miles as quick as the telegraph, and we have no means\nof tapping the wires. If they ever combined they could keep it as\nsecret as the grave. My houseboy might be in the rising, and I would\nnever suspect it till one fine morning he cut my throat.'\n\n'But they would never find a leader.  If there was some exiled prince\nof Tchaka's blood, who came back like Prince Charlie to free his\npeople, there might be danger; but their royalties are fat men with top\nhats and old frock-coats, who live in dirty locations.'\n\nWardlaw admitted this, but said that there might be other kinds of\nleaders.  He had been reading a lot about Ethiopianism, which educated\nAmerican negroes had been trying to preach in South Africa.  He did not\nsee why a kind of bastard Christianity should not be the motive of a\nrising.  'The Kaffir finds it an easy job to mix up Christian emotion\nand pagan practice.  Look at Hayti and some of the performances in the\nSouthern States.'\n\nThen he shook the ashes out of his pipe and leaned forward with a\nsolemn face.  'I'll admit the truth to you, Davie.  I'm black afraid.'\n\nHe looked so earnest and serious sitting there with his short-sighted\neyes peering at me that I could not help being impressed.\n\n'Whatever is the matter?' I asked.  'Has anything happened?'\n\nHe shook his head.  'Nothing I can put a name to.  But I have a\npresentiment that some mischief is afoot in these hills.  I feel it in\nmy bones.'\n\nI confess I was startled by these words.  You must remember that I had\nnever given a hint of my suspicions to Mr Wardlaw beyond asking him if\na wizard lived in the neighbourhood--a question anybody might have put.\nBut here was the schoolmaster discovering for himself some mystery in\nBlaauwildebeestefontein.\n\nI tried to get at his evidence, but it was very little.  He thought\nthere were an awful lot of blacks about.  'The woods are full of them,'\nhe said.  I gathered he did not imagine he was being spied on, but\nmerely felt that there were more natives about than could be explained.\n'There's another thing,' he said.  'The native bairns have all left the\nschool.  I've only three scholars left, and they are from Dutch farms.\nI went to Majinje to find out what was up, and an old crone told me the\nplace was full of bad men.  I tell you, Davie, there's something\nbrewing, and that something is not good for us.'\n\nThere was nothing new to me in what Wardlaw had to tell, and yet that\ntalk late at night by a dying fire made me feel afraid for the second\ntime since I had come to Blaauwildebeestefontein.  I had a clue and had\nbeen on the look-out for mysteries, but that another should feel the\nstrangeness for himself made it seem desperately real to me.  Of course\nI scoffed at Mr Wardlaw's fears.  I could not have him spoiling all my\nplans by crying up a native rising for which he had not a scrap of\nevidence.\n\n'Have you been writing to anybody?' I asked him.\n\nHe said that he had told no one, but he meant to, unless things got\nbetter.  'I haven't the nerve for this job, Davie,' he said; 'I'll have\nto resign.  And it's a pity, for the place suits my health fine.  You\nsee I know too much, and I haven't your whinstone nerve and total lack\nof imagination.'\n\nI told him that it was simply fancy, and came from reading too many\nbooks and taking too little exercise.  But I made him promise to say\nnothing to anybody either by word of mouth or letter, without telling\nme first.  Then I made him a rummer of toddy and sent him to bed a\ntrifle comforted.\n\nThe first thing I did in my new room was to shift the bed into the\ncorner out of line with the window.  There were no shutters, so I put\nup an old table-top and jammed it between the window frames.  Also, I\nloaded my shot-gun and kept it by my bedside.  Had Wardlaw seen these\npreparations he might have thought more of my imagination and less of\nmy nerve.  It was a real comfort to me to put out a hand in the\ndarkness and feel Colin's shaggy coat.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\nTHE DRUMS BEAT AT SUNSET\n\nJapp was drunk for the next day or two, and I had the business of the\nstore to myself.  I was glad of this, for it gave me leisure to reflect\nupon the various perplexities of my situation.  As I have said, I was\nreally scared, more out of a sense of impotence than from dread of\nactual danger.  I was in a fog of uncertainty. Things were happening\naround me which I could only dimly guess at, and I had no power to take\none step in defence.  That Wardlaw should have felt the same without\nany hint from me was the final proof that the mystery was no figment of\nmy nerves.  I had written to Colles and got no answer.  Now the letter\nwith Japp's resignation in it had gone to Durban.  Surely some notice\nwould be taken of that.  If I was given the post, Colles was bound to\nconsider what I had said in my earlier letter and give me some\ndirections.  Meanwhile it was my business to stick to my job till I was\nrelieved.\n\nA change had come over the place during my absence.  The natives had\nalmost disappeared from sight.  Except the few families living round\nBlaauwildebeestefontein one never saw a native on the roads, and none\ncame into the store.  They were sticking close to their locations, or\nelse they had gone after some distant business.  Except a batch of\nthree Shangaans returning from the Rand, I had nobody in the store for\nthe whole of one day.  So about four o'clock I shut it up, whistled on\nColin, and went for a walk along the Berg.\n\nIf there were no natives on the road, there were plenty in the bush.  I\nhad the impression, of which Wardlaw had spoken, that the native\npopulation of the countryside had suddenly been hugely increased.  The\nwoods were simply _hotching_ with them.  I was being spied on as before,\nbut now there were so many at the business that they could not all\nconceal their tracks.  Every now and then I had a glimpse of a black\nshoulder or leg, and Colin, whom I kept on the leash, was half-mad with\nexcitement.  I had seen all I wanted, and went home with a preoccupied\nmind.  I sat long on Wardlaw's garden-seat, trying to puzzle out the\ntruth of this spying.\n\nWhat perplexed me was that I had been left unmolested when I had gone\nto Umvelos'.  Now, as I conjectured, the secret of the neighbourhood,\nwhatever it was, was probably connected with the Rooirand.  But when I\nhad ridden in that direction and had spent two days in exploring, no\none had troubled to watch me.  I was quite certain about this, for my\neye had grown quick to note espionage, and it is harder for a spy to\nhide in the spare bush of the flats than in the dense thickets on these\nuplands.\n\nThe watchers, then, did not mind my fossicking round their sacred\nplace.  Why, then, was I so closely watched in the harmless\nneighbourhood of the store?  I thought for a long time before an answer\noccurred to me.  The reason must be that going to the plains I was\ngoing into native country and away from civilization.  But\nBlaauwildebeestefontein was near the frontier.  There must be some dark\nbusiness brewing of which they may have feared that I had an inkling.\nThey wanted to see if I proposed to go to Pietersdorp or Wesselsburg\nand tell what I knew, and they clearly were resolved that I should not.\nI laughed, I remember, thinking that they had forgotten the post-bag.\nBut then I reflected that I knew nothing of what might be happening\ndaily to the post-bag.\n\nWhen I had reached this conclusion, my first impulse was to test it by\nriding straight west on the main road.  If I was right, I should\ncertainly be stopped.  On second thoughts, however, this seemed to me\nto be flinging up the game prematurely, and I resolved to wait a day or\ntwo before acting.\n\nNext day nothing happened, save that my sense of loneliness increased.\nI felt that I was being hemmed in by barbarism, and cut off in a\nghoulish land from the succour of my own kind.  I only kept my courage\nup by the necessity of presenting a brave face to Mr Wardlaw, who was\nby this time in a very broken condition of nerves.  I had often thought\nthat it was my duty to advise him to leave, and to see him safely off,\nbut I shrank from severing myself from my only friend.  I thought, too,\nof the few Dutch farmers within riding distance, and had half a mind to\nvisit them, but they were far off over the plateau and could know\nlittle of my anxieties.\n\nThe third day events moved faster.  Japp was sober and wonderfully\nquiet.  He gave me good-morning quite in a friendly tone, and set to\nposting up the books as if he had never misbehaved in his days.  I was\nso busy with my thoughts that I, too, must have been gentler than\nusual, and the morning passed like a honeymoon, till I went across to\ndinner.\n\nI was just sitting down when I remembered that I had left my watch in\nmy waistcoat behind the counter, and started to go back for it.  But at\nthe door I stopped short.  For two horsemen had drawn up before the\nstore.\n\nOne was a native with what I took to be saddle-bags; the other was a\nsmall slim man with a sun helmet, who was slowly dismounting.\nSomething in the cut of his jib struck me as familiar.  I slipped into\nthe empty schoolroom and stared hard. Then, as he half-turned in\nhanding his bridle to the Kaffir, I got a sight of his face.  It was my\nformer shipmate, Henriques. He said something to his companion, and\nentered the store.\n\nYou may imagine that my curiosity ran to fever-heat.  My first impulse\nwas to march over for my waistcoat, and make a third with Japp at the\ninterview.  Happily I reflected in time that Henriques knew my face,\nfor I had grown no beard, having a great dislike to needless hair.  If\nhe was one of the villains in the drama, he would mark me down for his\nvengeance once he knew I was here, whereas at present he had probably\nforgotten all about me.  Besides, if I walked in boldly I would get no\nnews.  If Japp and he had a secret, they would not blab it in my\npresence.\n\nMy next idea was to slip in by the back to the room I had once lived\nin.  But how was I to cross the road?  It ran white and dry some\ndistance each way in full view of the Kaffir with the horses.  Further,\nthe store stood on a bare patch, and it would be a hard job to get in\nby the back, assuming, as I believed, that the neighbourhood was thick\nwith spies.\n\nThe upshot was that I got my glasses and turned them on the store.  The\ndoor was open, and so was the window.  In the gloom of the interior I\nmade out Henriques' legs.  He was standing by the counter, and\napparently talking to Japp.  He moved to shut the door, and came back\ninside my focus opposite the window.  There he stayed for maybe ten\nminutes, while I hugged my impatience.  I would have given a hundred\npounds to be snug in my old room with Japp thinking me out of the store.\n\nSuddenly the legs twitched up, and his boots appeared above the\ncounter.  Japp had invited him to his bedroom, and the game was now to\nbe played beyond my ken.  This was more than I could stand, so I stole\nout at the back door and took to the thickest bush on the hillside.  My\nnotion was to cross the road half a mile down, when it had dropped into\nthe defile of the stream, and then to come swiftly up the edge of the\nwater so as to effect a back entrance into the store.\n\nAs fast as I dared I tore through the bush, and in about a quarter of\nan hour had reached the point I was making for. Then I bore down to the\nroad, and was in the scrub about ten yards off it, when the clatter of\nhorses pulled me up again. Peeping out I saw that it was my friend and\nhis Kaffir follower, who were riding at a very good pace for the\nplains.  Toilfully and crossly I returned on my tracks to my\nlong-delayed dinner. Whatever the purport of their talk, Japp and the\nPortuguese had not taken long over it.\n\nIn the store that afternoon I said casually to Japp that I had noticed\nvisitors at the door during my dinner hour.  The old man looked me\nfrankly enough in the face.  'Yes, it was Mr Hendricks,' he said, and\nexplained that the man was a Portuguese trader from Delagoa way, who\nhad a lot of Kaffir stores east of the Lebombo Hills.  I asked his\nbusiness, and was told that he always gave Japp a call in when he was\npassing.\n\n'Do you take every man that calls into your bedroom, and shut the\ndoor?' I asked.\n\nJapp lost colour and his lip trembled.  'I swear to God, Mr Crawfurd,\nI've been doing nothing wrong.  I've kept the promise I gave you like\nan oath to my mother.  I see you suspect me, and maybe you've cause,\nbut I'll be quite honest with you.  I have dealt in diamonds before\nthis with Hendricks. But to-day, when he asked me, I told him that that\nbusiness was off.  I only took him to my room to give him a drink.  He\nlikes brandy, and there's no supply in the shop.'\n\nI distrusted Japp wholeheartedly enough, but I was convinced that in\nthis case he spoke the truth. 'Had the man any news?' I asked.\n\n'He had and he hadn't,' said Japp.  'He was always a sullen beggar, and\nnever spoke much.  But he said one queer thing. He asked me if I was\ngoing to retire, and when I told him \"yes,\" he said I had put it off\nrather long.  I told him I was as healthy as I ever was, and he laughed\nin his dirty Portugoose way.  \"Yes, Mr Japp,\" he says, \"but the country\nis not so healthy.\" I wonder what the chap meant.  He'll be dead of\nblackwater before many months, to judge by his eyes.'\n\nThis talk satisfied me about Japp, who was clearly in desperate fear of\noffending me, and disinclined to return for the present to his old\nways.  But I think the rest of the afternoon was the most wretched time\nin my existence.  It was as plain as daylight that we were in for some\ngrave trouble, trouble to which I believed that I alone held any kind\nof clue.  I had a pile of evidence--the visit of Henriques was the last\nbit--which pointed to some great secret approaching its disclosure. I\nthought that that disclosure meant blood and ruin.  But I knew nothing\ndefinite.  If the commander of a British army had come to me then and\nthere and offered help, I could have done nothing, only asked him to\nwait like me.  The peril, whatever it was, did not threaten me only,\nthough I and Wardlaw and Japp might be the first to suffer; but I had a\nterrible feeling that I alone could do something to ward it off, and\njust what that something was I could not tell.  I was horribly afraid,\nnot only of unknown death, but of my impotence to play any manly part.\nI was alone, knowing too much and yet too little, and there was no\nchance of help under the broad sky.  I cursed myself for not writing to\nAitken at Lourenco Marques weeks before.  He had promised to come up,\nand he was the kind of man who kept his word.\n\nIn the late afternoon I dragged Wardlaw out for a walk.  In his\npresence I had to keep up a forced cheerfulness, and I believe the\npretence did me good.  We took a path up the Berg among groves of\nstinkwood and essenwood, where a failing stream made an easy route.  It\nmay have been fancy, but it seemed to me that the wood was emptier and\nthat we were followed less closely.  I remember it was a lovely\nevening, and in the clear fragrant gloaming every foreland of the Berg\nstood out like a great ship above the dark green sea of the bush. When\nwe reached the edge of the plateau we saw the sun sinking between two\nfar blue peaks in Makapan's country, and away to the south the great\nroll of the high veld.  I longed miserably for the places where white\nmen were thronged together in dorps and cities. As we gazed a curious\nsound struck our ears.  It seemed to begin far up in the north--a low\nroll like the combing of breakers on the sand.  Then it grew louder and\ntravelled nearer--a roll, with sudden spasms of harsher sound in it;\nreminding me of the churning in one of the pot-holes of Kirkcaple\ncliffs.  Presently it grew softer again as the sound passed south, but\nnew notes were always emerging.  The echo came sometimes, as it were,\nfrom stark rock, and sometimes from the deep gloom of the forests.  I\nhave never heard an eerier sound.  Neither natural nor human it seemed,\nbut the voice of that world between which is hid from man's sight and\nhearing.\n\nMr Wardlaw clutched my arm, and in that moment I guessed the\nexplanation.  The native drums were beating, passing some message from\nthe far north down the line of the Berg, where the locations were\nthickest, to the great black population of the south.\n\n'But that means war,' Mr Wardlaw cried.\n\n'It means nothing of the kind,' I said shortly.  'It's their way of\nsending news.  It's as likely to be some change in the weather or an\noutbreak of cattle disease.'\n\nWhen we got home I found Japp with a face like grey paper. 'Did you\nhear the drums?'he asked.\n\n'Yes,' I said shortly.  'What about them?'\n\n'God forgive you for an ignorant Britisher,' he almost shouted.  'You\nmay hear drums any night, but a drumming like that I only once heard\nbefore.  It was in '79 in the 'Zeti valley. Do you know what happened\nnext day?  Cetewayo's impis came over the hills, and in an hour there\nwasn't a living white soul in the glen.  Two men escaped, and one of\nthem was called Peter Japp.'\n\n'We are in God's hands then, and must wait on His will,' I said\nsolemnly.\n\nThere was no more sleep for Wardlaw and myself that night. We made the\nbest barricade we could of the windows, loaded all our weapons, and\ntrusted to Colin to give us early news. Before supper I went over to\nget Japp to join us, but found that that worthy had sought help from\nhis old protector, the bottle, and was already sound asleep with both\ndoor and window open.\n\nI had made up my mind that death was certain, and yet my heart belied\nmy conviction, and I could not feel the appropriate mood.  If anything\nI was more cheerful since I had heard the drums.  It was clearly now\nbeyond the power of me or any man to stop the march of events.  My\nthoughts ran on a native rising, and I kept telling myself how little\nthat was probable. Where were the arms, the leader, the discipline?  At\nany rate such arguments put me to sleep before dawn, and I wakened at\neight to find that nothing had happened.  The clear morning sunlight,\nas of old, made Blaauwildebeestefontein the place of a dream.  Zeeta\nbrought in my cup of coffee as if this day were just like all others,\nmy pipe tasted as sweet, the fresh air from the Berg blew as fragrantly\non my brow.  I went over to the store in reasonably good spirits,\nleaving Wardlaw busy on the penitential Psalms.\n\nThe post-runner had brought the mail as usual, and there was one\nprivate letter for me.  I opened it with great excitement, for the\nenvelope bore the stamp of the firm.  At last Colles had deigned to\nanswer.\n\nInside was a sheet of the firm's notepaper, with the signature of\nColles across the top.  Below some one had pencilled these five words:\n\n'_The Blesbok[1] are changing ground._'\n\nI looked to see that Japp had not suffocated himself, then shut up the\nstore, and went back to my room to think out this new mystification.\n\nThe thing had come from Colles, for it was the private notepaper of the\nDurban office, and there was Colles' signature. But the pencilling was\nin a different hand.  My deduction from this was that some one wished\nto send me a message, and that Colles had given that some one a sheet\nof signed paper to serve as a kind of introduction.  I might take it,\ntherefore, that the scribble was Colles' reply to my letter.\n\nNow, my argument continued, if the unknown person saw fit to send me a\nmessage, it could not be merely one of warning. Colles must have told\nhim that I was awake to some danger, and as I was in\nBlaauwildebeestefontein, I must be nearer the heart of things than any\none else.  The message must therefore be in the nature of some\npassword, which I was to remember when I heard it again.\n\nI reasoned the whole thing out very clearly, and I saw no gap in my\nlogic.  I cannot describe how that scribble had heartened me.  I felt\nno more the crushing isolation of yesterday. There were others beside\nme in the secret.  Help must be on the way, and the letter was the\nfirst tidings.\n\nBut how near?--that was the question; and it occurred to me for the\nfirst time to look at the postmark.  I went back to the store and got\nthe envelope out of the waste-paper basket. The postmark was certainly\nnot Durban.  The stamp was a Cape Colony one, and of the mark I could\nonly read three letters, T. R. S.  This was no sort of clue, and I\nturned the thing over, completely baffled.  Then I noticed that there\nwas no mark of the post town of delivery.  Our letters to\nBlaauwildebeestefontein came through Pietersdorp and bore that mark.  I\ncompared the envelope with others.  They all had a circle, and\n'Pietersdorp' in broad black letters.  But this envelope had nothing\nexcept the stamp.\n\nI was still slow at detective work, and it was some minutes before the\nexplanation flashed on me.  The letter had never been posted at all.\nThe stamp was a fake, and had been borrowed from an old envelope.\nThere was only one way in which it could have come.  It must have been\nput in the letter-bag while the postman was on his way from\nPietersdorp.  My unknown friend must therefore be somewhere within\neighty miles of me.  I hurried off to look for the post-runner, but he\nhad started back an hour before.  There was nothing for it but to wait\non the coming of the unknown.\n\nThat afternoon I again took Mr Wardlaw for a walk.  It is an ingrained\nhabit of mine that I never tell anyone more of a business than is\npractically necessary.  For months I had kept all my knowledge to\nmyself, and breathed not a word to a soul. But I thought it my duty to\ntell Wardlaw about the letter, to let him see that we were not\nforgotten.  I am afraid it did not encourage his mind.  Occult messages\nseemed to him only the last proof of a deadly danger encompassing us,\nand I could not shake his opinion.\n\nWe took the same road to the crown of the Berg, and I was confirmed in\nmy suspicion that the woods were empty and the watchers gone.  The\nplace was as deserted as the bush at Umvelos'.  When we reached the\nsummit about sunset we waited anxiously for the sound of drums.  It\ncame, as we expected, louder and more menacing than before.  Wardlaw\nstood pinching my arm as the great tattoo swept down the escarpment,\nand died away in the far mountains beyond the Olifants. Yet it no\nlonger seemed to be a wall of sound, shutting us out from our kindred\nin the West.  A message had pierced the wall.  If the blesbok were\nchanging ground, I believed that the hunters were calling out their\nhounds and getting ready for the chase.\n\n\n[1] A species of buck.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\nCAPTAIN ARCOLL TELLS A TALE\n\nIt froze in the night, harder than was common on the Berg even in\nwinter, and as I crossed the road next morning it was covered with\nrime.  All my fears had gone, and my mind was strung high with\nexpectation.  Five pencilled words may seem a small thing to build hope\non, but it was enough for me, and I went about my work in the store\nwith a reasonably light heart.  One of the first things I did was to\ntake stock of our armoury.  There were five sporting Mausers of a cheap\nmake, one Mauser pistol, a Lee-Speed carbine, and a little\nnickel-plated revolver.  There was also Japp's shot-gun, an old\nhammered breech-loader, as well as the gun I had brought out with me.\nThere was a good supply of cartridges, including a stock for a .400\nexpress which could not be found.  I pocketed the revolver, and\nsearched till I discovered a good sheath-knife.  If fighting was in\nprospect I might as well look to my arms.\n\nAll the morning I sat among flour and sugar possessing my soul in as\nmuch patience as I could command.  Nothing came down the white road\nfrom the west.  The sun melted the rime; the flies came out and buzzed\nin the window; Japp got himself out of bed, brewed strong coffee, and\nwent back to his slumbers.  Presently it was dinner-time, and I went\nover to a silent meal with Wardlaw.  When I returned I must have fallen\nasleep over a pipe, for the next thing I knew I was blinking drowsily\nat the patch of sun in the door, and listening for footsteps.  In the\ndead stillness of the afternoon I thought I could discern a shuffling\nin the dust.  I got up and looked out, and there, sure enough, was some\none coming down the road.\n\nBut it was only a Kaffir, and a miserable-looking object at that.  I\nhad never seen such an anatomy.  It was a very old man, bent almost\ndouble, and clad in a ragged shirt and a pair of foul khaki trousers.\nHe carried an iron pot, and a few belongings were tied up in a dirty\nhandkerchief.  He must have been a _dacha_[1] smoker, for he coughed\nhideously, twisting his body with the paroxysms.  I had seen the type\nbefore--the old broken-down native who had no kin to support him, and\nno tribe to shelter him.  They wander about the roads, cooking their\nwretched meals by their little fires, till one morning they are found\nstiff under a bush.\n\nThe native gave me a good-day in Kaffir, then begged for tobacco or a\nhandful of mealie-meal.\n\nI asked him where he came from.\n\n'From the west, Inkoos,' he said, 'and before that from the south.  It\nis a sore road for old bones.'\n\nI went into the store to fetch some meal, and when I came out he had\nshuffled close to the door.  He had kept his eyes on the ground, but\nnow he looked up at me, and I thought he had very bright eyes for such\nan old wreck.\n\n'The nights are cold, Inkoos,' he wailed, 'and my folk are scattered,\nand I have no kraal.  The aasvogels follow me, and I can hear the\nblesbok.' 'What about the blesbok?' I asked with a start.\n\n'The blesbok are changing ground,' he said, and looked me straight in\nthe face.\n\n'And where are the hunters?' I asked. 'They are here and behind me,' he\nsaid in English, holding out his pot for my meal, while he began to\nedge into the middle of the road.\n\nI followed, and, speaking English, asked him if he knew of a man named\nColles.\n\n'I come from him, young Baas.  Where is your house?  Ah, the school.\nThere will be a way in by the back window?  See that it is open, for\nI'll be there shortly.'  Then lifting up his voice he called down in\nSesuto all manner of blessings on me for my kindness, and went\nshuffling down the sunlit road, coughing like a volcano.\n\nIn high excitement I locked up the store and went over to Mr Wardlaw.\nNo children had come to school that day, and he was sitting idle,\nplaying patience.  'Lock the door,' I said, 'and come into my room.\nWe're on the brink of explanations.'\n\nIn about twenty minutes the bush below the back-window parted and the\nKaffir slipped out.  He grinned at me, and after a glance round, hopped\nvery nimbly over the sill.  Then he examined the window and pulled the\ncurtains.\n\n'Is the outer door shut?' he asked in excellent English.  'Well, get me\nsome hot water, and any spare clothes you may possess, Mr Crawfurd.  I\nmust get comfortable before we begin our _indaba_.[2]  We've the night\nbefore us, so there's plenty of time. But get the house clear, and see\nthat nobody disturbs me at my toilet.  I am a modest man, and sensitive\nabout my looks.'\n\nI brought him what he wanted, and looked on at an amazing\ntransformation.  Taking a phial from his bundle, he rubbed some liquid\non his face and neck and hands, and got rid of the black colouring.\nHis body and legs he left untouched, save that he covered them with\nshirt and trousers from my wardrobe. Then he pulled off a scaly wig,\nand showed beneath it a head of close-cropped grizzled hair.  In ten\nminutes the old Kaffir had been transformed into an active\nsoldierly-looking man of maybe fifty years.  Mr Wardlaw stared as if he\nhad seen a resurrection.\n\n'I had better introduce myself,' he said, when he had taken the edge\noff his thirst and hunger.  'My name is Arcoll, Captain James Arcoll.\nI am speaking to Mr Crawfurd, the storekeeper, and Mr Wardlaw, the\nschoolmaster, of Blaauwildebeestefontein. Where, by the way, is Mr\nPeter Japp?  Drunk?  Ah, yes, it was always his failing.  The quorum,\nhowever, is complete without him.'\n\nBy this time it was about sunset, and I remember I cocked my ear to\nhear the drums beat.  Captain Arcoll noticed the movement as he noticed\nall else. 'You're listening for the drums, but you won't hear them.\nThat business is over here.  To-night they beat in Swaziland and down\ninto the Tonga border.  Three days more, unless you and I, Mr Crawfurd,\nare extra smart, and they'll be hearing them in Durban.'\n\nIt was not till the lamp was lit, the fire burning well, and the house\nlocked and shuttered, that Captain Arcoll began his tale.\n\n'First,' he said, 'let me hear what you know.  Colles told me that you\nwere a keen fellow, and had wind of some mystery here.  You wrote him\nabout the way you were spied on, but I told him to take no notice.\nYour affair, Mr Crawfurd, had to wait on more urgent matters.  Now,\nwhat do you think is happening?' I spoke very shortly, weighing my\nwords, for I felt I was on trial before these bright eyes.  'I think\nthat some kind of native rising is about to commence.'\n\n'Ay,' he said dryly, 'you would, and your evidence would be the spying\nand drumming.  Anything more?'\n\n'I have come on the tracks of a lot of I.D.B. work in the\nneighbourhood.  The natives have some supply of diamonds, which they\nsell bit by bit, and I don't doubt but they have been getting guns with\nthe proceeds.'\n\nHe nodded, 'Have you any notion who has been engaged in the job?'\n\nI had it on my tongue to mention Japp, but forbore, remembering my\npromise.  'I can name one,' I said, 'a little yellow Portugoose, who\ncalls himself Henriques or Hendricks. He passed by here the day before\nyesterday.'\n\nCaptain Arcoll suddenly was consumed with quiet laughter. 'Did you\nnotice the Kaffir who rode with him and carried his saddlebags?  Well,\nhe's one of my men.  Henriques would have a fit if he knew what was in\nthose saddlebags.  They contain my change of clothes, and other odds\nand ends.  Henriques' own stuff is in a hole in the spruit.  A handy\nway of getting one's luggage sent on, eh?  The bags are waiting for me\nat a place I appointed.'  And again Captain Arcoll indulged his sense\nof humour.  Then he became grave, and returned to his examination.\n\n'A rising, with diamonds as the sinews of war, and Henriques as the\nchief agent.  Well and good!  But who is to lead, and what are the\nnatives going to rise about?'\n\n'I know nothing further, but I have made some guesses.'\n\n'Let's hear your guesses,' he said, blowing smoke rings from his pipe.\n\n'I think the main mover is a great black minister who calls himself\nJohn Laputa.'\n\nCaptain Arcoll nearly sprang out of his chair.  'Now, how on earth did\nyou find that out?  Quick, Mr Crawfurd, tell me all you know, for this\nis desperately important.'\n\nI began at the beginning, and told him the story of what happened on\nthe Kirkcaple shore.  Then I spoke of my sight of him on board ship,\nhis talk with Henriques about Blaauwildebeestefontein, and his hurried\ndeparture from Durban.\n\nCaptain Arcoll listened intently, and at the mention of Durban he\nlaughed.  'You and I seem to have been running on lines which nearly\ntouched.  I thought I had grabbed my friend Laputa that night in\nDurban, but I was too cocksure and he slipped off.  Do you know, Mr\nCrawfurd, you have been on the right trail long before me?  When did\nyou say you saw him at his devil-worship?  Seven years ago?  Then you\nwere the first man alive to know the Reverend John in his true colours.\nYou knew seven years ago what I only found out last year.'\n\n'Well, that's my story,' I said.  'I don't know what the rising is\nabout, but there's one other thing I can tell you.  There's some kind\nof sacred place for the Kaffirs, and I've found out where it is.'  I\ngave him a short account of my adventures in the Rooirand.\n\nHe smoked silently for a bit after I had finished.  'You've got the\nskeleton of the whole thing right, and you only want the filling up.\nAnd you found out everything for yourself?  Colles was right; you're\nnot wanting in intelligence, Mr Crawfurd.'\n\nIt was not much of a compliment, but I have never been more pleased in\nmy life.  This slim, grizzled man, with his wrinkled face and bright\neyes, was clearly not lavish in his praise.  I felt it was no small\nthing to have earned a word of commendation.\n\n'And now I will tell you my story,' said Captain Arcoll.  'It is a long\nstory, and I must begin far back.  It has taken me years to decipher\nit, and, remember, I've been all my life at this native business.  I\ncan talk every dialect, and I have the customs of every tribe by heart.\nI've travelled over every mile of South Africa, and Central and East\nAfrica too.  I was in both the Matabele wars, and I've seen a heap of\nother fighting which never got into the papers.  So what I tell you you\ncan take as gospel, for it is knowledge that was not learned in a day.'\n\nHe puffed away, and then asked suddenly, 'Did you ever hear of Prester\nJohn?'\n\n'The man that lived in Central Asia?' I asked, with a reminiscence of a\nstory-book I had as a boy. 'No, no,' said Mr Wardlaw, 'he means the\nKing of Abyssinia in the fifteenth century.  I've been reading all\nabout him.  He was a Christian, and the Portuguese sent expedition\nafter expedition to find him, but they never got there.  Albuquerque\nwanted to make an alliance with him and capture the Holy Sepulchre.'\n\nArcoll nodded.  'That's the one I mean.  There's not very much known\nabout him, except Portuguese legends.  He was a sort of Christian, but\nI expect that his practices were as pagan as his neighbours'.  There is\nno doubt that he was a great conqueror.  Under him and his successors,\nthe empire of Ethiopia extended far south of Abyssinia away down to the\nGreat Lakes.'\n\n'How long did this power last?' I asked wondering to what tale this was\nprologue.\n\n'That's a mystery no scholar has ever been able to fathom. Anyhow, the\ncentre of authority began to shift southward, and the warrior tribes\nmoved in that direction.  At the end of the sixteenth century the chief\nnative power was round about the Zambesi.  The Mazimba and the\nMakaranga had come down from the Lake Nyassa quarter, and there was a\nstrong kingdom in Manicaland.  That was the Monomotapa that the\nPortuguese thought so much of.'\n\nWardlaw nodded eagerly.  The story was getting into ground that he knew\nabout.\n\n'The thing to remember is that all these little empires thought\nthemselves the successors of Prester John.  It took me a long time to\nfind this out, and I have spent days in the best libraries in Europe\nover it.  They all looked back to a great king in the north, whom they\ncalled by about twenty different names.  They had forgotten about his\nChristianity, but they remembered that he was a conqueror.\n\n'Well, to make a long story short, Monomotapa disappeared in time, and\nfresh tribes came down from the north, and pushed right down to Natal\nand the Cape.  That is how the Zulus first appeared.  They brought with\nthem the story of Prester John, but by this time it had ceased to be a\nhistorical memory, and had become a religious cult.  They worshipped a\ngreat Power who had been their ancestor, and the favourite Zulu word\nfor him was Umkulunkulu.  The belief was perverted into fifty different\nforms, but this was the central creed--that Umkulunkulu had been the\nfather of the tribe, and was alive as a spirit to watch over them.\n\n'They brought more than a creed with them.  Somehow or other, some\nfetich had descended from Prester John by way of the Mazimba and Angoni\nand Makaranga.  What it is I do not know, but it was always in the\nhands of the tribe which for the moment held the leadership.  The great\nnative wars of the sixteenth century, which you can read about in the\nPortuguese historians, were not for territory but for leadership, and\nmainly for the possession of this fetich.  Anyhow, we know that the\nZulus brought it down with them.  They called it _Ndhlondhlo_, which\nmeans the Great Snake, but I don't suppose that it was any kind of\nsnake.  The snake was their totem, and they would naturally call their\nmost sacred possession after it.\n\n'Now I will tell you a thing that few know.  You have heard of Tchaka.\nHe was a sort of black Napoleon early in the last century, and he made\nthe Zulus the paramount power in South Africa, slaughtering about two\nmillion souls to accomplish it. Well, he had the fetich, whatever it\nwas, and it was believed that he owed his conquests to it.  Mosilikatse\ntried to steal it, and that was why he had to fly to Matabeleland.  But\nwith Tchaka it disappeared.  Dingaan did not have it, nor Panda, and\nCetewayo never got it, though he searched the length and breadth of the\ncountry for it.  It had gone out of existence, and with it the chance\nof a Kaffir empire.'\n\nCaptain Arcoll got up to light his pipe, and I noticed that his face\nwas grave.  He was not telling us this yarn for our amusement.\n\n'So much for Prester John and his charm,' he said.  'Now I have to take\nup the history at a different point.  In spite of risings here and\nthere, and occasional rows, the Kaffirs have been quiet for the better\npart of half a century.  It is no credit to us.  They have had plenty\nof grievances, and we are no nearer understanding them than our fathers\nwere.  But they are scattered and divided.  We have driven great wedges\nof white settlement into their territory, and we have taken away their\narms.  Still, they are six times as many as we are, and they have long\nmemories, and a thoughtful man may wonder how long the peace will last.\nI have often asked myself that question, and till lately I used to\nreply, \"For ever because they cannot find a leader with the proper\nauthority, and they have no common cause to fight for.\" But a year or\ntwo ago I began to change my mind.\n\n'It is my business to act as chief Intelligence officer among the\nnatives.  Well, one day, I came on the tracks of a curious person.  He\nwas a Christian minister called Laputa, and he was going among the\ntribes from Durban to the Zambesi as a roving evangelist.  I found that\nhe made an enormous impression, and yet the people I spoke to were\nchary of saying much about him.  Presently I found that he preached\nmore than the gospel.  His word was \"Africa for the Africans,\" and his\nchief point was that the natives had had a great empire in the past,\nand might have a great empire again.  He used to tell the story of\nPrester John, with all kinds of embroidery of his own.  You see,\nPrester John was a good argument for him, for he had been a Christian\nas well as a great potentate. 'For years there has been plenty of this\ntalk in South Africa, chiefly among Christian Kaffirs.  It is what they\ncall \"Ethiopianism,\" and American negroes are the chief apostles.  For\nmyself, I always thought the thing perfectly harmless.  I don't care a\nfig whether the native missions break away from the parent churches in\nEngland and call themselves by fancy names.  The more freedom they have\nin their religious life, the less they are likely to think about\npolitics.  But I soon found out that Laputa was none of your flabby\neducated negroes from America, and I began to watch him.\n\n'I first came across him at a revival meeting in London, where he was a\ngreat success.  He came and spoke to me about my soul, but he gave up\nwhen I dropped into Zulu.  The next time I met him was on the lower\nLimpopo, when I had the pleasure of trying to shoot him from a boat.'\nCaptain Arcoll took his pipe from his mouth and laughed at the\nrecollection.\n\n'I had got on to an I.D.B. gang, and to my amazement found the\nevangelist among them.  But the Reverend John was too much for me.  He\nwent overboard in spite of the crocodiles, and managed to swim below\nwater to the reed bed at the side. However, that was a valuable\nexperience for me, for it gave me a clue.\n\n'I next saw him at a Missionary Conference in Cape Town, and after that\nat a meeting of the Geographical Society in London, where I had a long\ntalk with him.  My reputation does not follow me home, and he thought I\nwas an English publisher with an interest in missions.  You see I had\nno evidence to connect him with I.D.B., and besides I fancied that his\nreal game was something bigger than that; so I just bided my time and\nwatched.\n\n'I did my best to get on to his dossier, but it was no easy job.\nHowever, I found out a few things.  He had been educated in the States,\nand well educated too, for the man is a good scholar and a great\nreader, besides the finest natural orator I have ever heard.  There was\nno doubt that he was of Zulu blood, but I could get no traces of his\nfamily.  He must come of high stock, for he is a fine figure of a man.\n'Very soon I found it was no good following him in his excursions into\ncivilization.  There he was merely the educated Kaffir; a great pet of\nmissionary societies, and a favourite speaker at Church meetings.  You\nwill find evidence given by him in Blue-Books on native affairs, and he\ncounted many members of Parliament at home among his correspondents.  I\nlet that side go, and resolved to dog him when on his evangelizing\ntours in the back-veld.\n\n'For six months I stuck to him like a leech.  I am pretty good at\ndisguises, and he never knew who was the broken-down old Kaffir who\nsquatted in the dirt at the edge of the crowd when he spoke, or the\nhalf-caste who called him \"Sir\" and drove his Cape-cart.  I had some\nqueer adventures, but these can wait. The gist of the thing is, that\nafter six months which turned my hair grey I got a glimmering of what\nhe was after.  He talked Christianity to the mobs in the kraals, but to\nthe indunas[3] he told a different story.'\n\nCaptain Arcoll helped himself to a drink.  'You can guess what that\nstory was, Mr Crawfurd.  At full moon when the black cock was blooded,\nthe Reverend John forgot his Christianity. He was back four centuries\namong the Mazimba sweeping down on the Zambesi.  He told them, and they\nbelieved him, that he was the Umkulunkulu, the incarnated spirit of\nPrester John.  He told them that he was there to lead the African race\nto conquest and empire.  Ay, and he told them more: for he has, or says\nhe has, the Great Snake itself, the necklet of Prester John.'\n\nNeither of us spoke; we were too occupied with fitting this news into\nour chain of knowledge.\n\nCaptain Arcoll went on.  'Now that I knew his purpose, I set myself to\nfind out his preparations.  It was not long before I found a mighty\norganization at work from the Zambesi to the Cape.  The great tribes\nwere up to their necks in the conspiracy, and all manner of little\nsects had been taken in.  I have sat at tribal councils and been sworn\na blood brother, and I have used the secret password to get knowledge\nin odd places.  It was a dangerous game, and, as I have said, I had my\nadventures, but I came safe out of it--with my knowledge.\n\n'The first thing I found out was that there was a great deal of wealth\nsomewhere among the tribes.  Much of it was in diamonds, which the\nlabourers stole from the mines and the chiefs impounded.  Nearly every\ntribe had its secret chest, and our friend Laputa had the use of them\nall.  Of course the difficulty was changing the diamonds into coin, and\nhe had to start I.D.B. on a big scale.  Your pal, Henriques, was the\nchief agent for this, but he had others at Mozambique and Johannesburg,\nay, and in London, whom I have on my list.  With the money, guns and\nammunition were bought, and it seems that a pretty flourishing trade\nhas been going on for some time. They came in mostly overland through\nPortuguese territory, though there have been cases of consignments to\nJohannesburg houses, the contents of which did not correspond with the\ninvoice.  You ask what the Governments were doing to let this go on.\nYes, and you may well ask.  They were all asleep.  They never dreamed\nof danger from the natives, and in any case it was difficult to police\nthe Portuguese side.  Laputa knew our weakness, and he staked\neverything on it.\n\n'My first scheme was to lay Laputa by the heels; but no Government\nwould act on my information.  The man was strongly buttressed by public\nsupport at home, and South Africa has burned her fingers before this\nwith arbitrary arrests. Then I tried to fasten I.D.B. on him, but I\ncould not get my proofs till too late.  I nearly had him in Durban, but\nhe got away; and he never gave me a second chance.  For five months he\nand Henriques have been lying low, because their scheme was getting\nvery ripe.  I have been following them through Zululand and Gazaland,\nand I have discovered that the train is ready, and only wants the\nmatch.  For a month I have never been more than five hours behind him\non the trail; and if he has laid his train, I have laid mine also.'\n\nArcoll's whimsical, humorous face had hardened into grimness, and in\nhis eyes there was the light of a fierce purpose. The sight of him\ncomforted me, in spite of his tale.\n\n'But what can he hope to do?' I asked.  'Though he roused every Kaffir\nin South Africa he would be beaten.  You say he is an educated man.  He\nmust know he has no chance in the long run.'\n\n'I said he was an educated man, but he is also a Kaffir.  He can see\nthe first stage of a thing, and maybe the second, but no more.  That is\nthe native mind.  If it was not like that our chance would be the\nworse.'\n\n'You say the scheme is ripe,' I said; 'how ripe?'\n\nArcoll looked at the clock.  'In half an hour's time Laputa will be\nwith 'Mpefu.  There he will stay the night.  To-morrow morning he goes\nto Umvelos' to meet Henriques.  To-morrow evening the gathering begins.'\n\n'One question,' I said.  'How big a man is Laputa?'\n\n'The biggest thing that the Kaffirs have ever produced.  I tell you, in\nmy opinion he is a great genius.  If he had been white he might have\nbeen a second Napoleon.  He is a born leader of men, and as brave as a\nlion.  There is no villainy he would not do if necessary, and yet I\nshould hesitate to call him a blackguard.  Ay, you may look surprised\nat me, you two pragmatical Scotsmen; but I have, so to speak, lived\nwith the man for months, and there's fineness and nobility in him.  He\nwould be a terrible enemy, but a just one.  He has the heart of a poet\nand a king, and it is God's curse that he has been born among the\nchildren of Ham.  I hope to shoot him like a dog in a day or two, but I\nam glad to bear testimony to his greatness.'\n\n'If the rising starts to-morrow,' I asked, 'have you any of his plans?'\n\nHe picked up a map from the table and opened it.  'The first rendezvous\nis somewhere near Sikitola's.  Then they move south, picking up\ncontingents; and the final concentration is to be on the high veld near\nAmsterdam, which is convenient for the Swazis and the Zulus.  After\nthat I know nothing, but of course there are local concentrations along\nthe whole line of the Berg from Mashonaland to Basutoland.  Now, look\nhere. To get to Amsterdam they must cross the Delagoa Bay Railway.\nWell, they won't be allowed to.  If they get as far, they will be\nscattered there.  As I told you, I too have laid my train.  We have the\npolice ready all along the scarp of the Berg. Every exit from native\nterritory is watched, and the frontier farmers are out on commando.  We\nhave regulars on the Delagoa Bay and Natal lines, and a system of field\ntelegraphs laid which can summon further troops to any point.  It has\nall been kept secret, because we are still in the dark ourselves. The\nnewspaper public knows nothing about any rising, but in two days every\nwhite household in South Africa will be in a panic.  Make no mistake,\nMr Crawfurd; this is a grim business. We shall smash Laputa and his\nmen, but it will be a fierce fight, and there will be much good blood\nshed.  Besides, it will throw the country back another half-century.\nWould to God I had been man enough to put a bullet through his head in\ncold blood.  But I could not do it--it was too like murder; and maybe I\nshall never have the chance now.'\n\n'There's one thing puzzles me,' I said.  'What makes Laputa come up\nhere to start with?  Why doesn't he begin with Zululand?'\n\n'God knows!  There's sure to be sense in it, for he does nothing\nwithout reason.  We may know to-morrow.'\n\nBut as Captain Arcoll spoke, the real reason suddenly flashed into my\nmind: Laputa had to get the Great Snake, the necklet of Prester John,\nto give his leadership prestige.  Apparently he had not yet got it, or\nArcoll would have known.  He started from this neighbourhood because\nthe fetich was somewhere hereabouts.  I was convinced that my guess was\nright, but I kept my own counsel.\n\n'To-morrow Laputa and Henriques meet at Umvelos', probably at your new\nstore, Mr Crawfurd.  And so the ball commences.'\n\nMy resolution was suddenly taken.\n\n'I think,' I said, 'I had better be present at the meeting, as\nrepresenting the firm.'\n\nCaptain Arcoll stared at me and laughed.  'I had thought of going\nmyself,' he said.\n\n'Then you go to certain death, disguise yourself as you please.  You\ncannot meet them in the store as I can.  I'm there on my ordinary\nbusiness, and they will never suspect.  If you're to get any news, I'm\nthe man to go.'\n\nHe looked at me steadily for a minute or so.  'I'm not sure that's such\na bad idea of yours.  I would be better employed myself on the Berg,\nand, as you say, I would have little chance of hearing anything.\nYou're a plucky fellow, Mr Crawfurd.  I suppose you understand that the\nrisk is pretty considerable.'\n\n'I suppose I do; but since I'm in this thing, I may as well see it out.\nBesides, I've an old quarrel with our friend Laputa.'\n\n'Good and well,' said Captain Arcoll.  'Draw in your chair to the\ntable, then, and I'll explain to you the disposition of my men.  I\nshould tell you that I have loyal natives in my pay in most tribes, and\ncan count on early intelligence.  We can't match their telepathy; but\nthe new type of field telegraph is not so bad, and may be a trifle more\nreliable.'\n\nTill midnight we pored over maps, and certain details were burned in on\nmy memory.  Then we went to bed and slept soundly, even Mr Wardlaw.  It\nwas strange how fear had gone from the establishment, now that we knew\nthe worst and had a fighting man by our side.\n\n\n[1] Hemp.\n\n[2] Council.\n\n[3] Lesser chiefs.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\nI FALL IN AGAIN WITH THE REVEREND JOHN LAPUTA\n\nOnce, as a boy, I had earnestly desired to go into the army, and had\nhopes of rising to be a great general.  Now that I know myself better,\nI do not think I would have been much good at a general's work.  I\nwould have shirked the loneliness of it, the isolation of\nresponsibility.  But I think I would have done well in a subaltern\ncommand, for I had a great notion of carrying out orders, and a certain\nzest in the mere act of obedience. Three days before I had been as\nnervous as a kitten because I was alone and it was 'up to me,' as\nAmericans say, to decide on the next step.  But now that I was only one\nwheel in a great machine of defence my nervousness seemed to have fled.\nI was well aware that the mission I was bound on was full of risk; but,\nto my surprise, I felt no fear.  Indeed, I had much the same feeling as\na boy on a Saturday's holiday who has planned a big expedition.  One\nthing only I regretted--that Tam Dyke was not with me to see the fun.\nThe thought of that faithful soul, now beating somewhere on the seas,\nmade me long for his comradeship.  As I shaved, I remember wondering if\nI would ever shave again, and the thought gave me no tremors. For once\nin my sober life I was strung up to the gambler's pitch of adventure.\n\nMy job was to go to Umvelos' as if on my ordinary business, and if\npossible find out something of the evening's plan of march.  The\nquestion was how to send back a message to Arcoll, assuming I had any\ndifficulty in getting away.  At first this puzzled us both, and then I\nthought of Colin.  I had trained the dog to go home at my bidding, for\noften when I used to go hunting I would have occasion to visit a kraal\nwhere he would have been a nuisance.  Accordingly, I resolved to take\nColin with me, and, if I got into trouble, to send word by him.\n\nI asked about Laputa's knowledge of our preparations. Arcoll was\ninclined to think that he suspected little.  The police and the\ncommandos had been kept very secret, and, besides, they were moving on\nthe high veld and out of the ken of the tribes.  Natives, he told me,\nwere not good scouts so far as white man's work was concerned, for they\ndid not understand the meaning of what we did.  On the other hand, his\nown native scouts brought him pretty accurate tidings of any Kaffir\nmovements.  He thought that all the bush country of the plain would be\nclosely watched, and that no one would get through without some kind of\npass.  But he thought also that the storekeeper might be an exception,\nfor his presence would give rise to no suspicions.  Almost his last\nwords to me were to come back hell-for-leather if I saw the game was\nhopeless, and in any case to leave as soon as I got any news.  'If\nyou're there when the march begins,' he said, 'they'll cut your throat\nfor a certainty.'  I had all the various police posts on the Berg clear\nin my mind, so that I would know where to make for if the road to\nBlaauwildebeestefontein should be closed.\n\nI said good-bye to Arcoll and Wardlaw with a light heart, though the\nschoolmaster broke down and implored me to think better of it.  As I\nturned down into the gorge I heard the sound of horses' feet far\nbehind, and, turning back, saw white riders dismounting at the dorp.\nAt any rate I was leaving the country well guarded in my rear.\n\nIt was a fine morning in mid-winter, and I was in very good spirits as\nI jogged on my pony down the steep hill-road, with Colin running beside\nme.  A month before I had taken the same journey, with no suspicion in\nmy head of what the future was to bring.  I thought about my Dutch\ncompanions, now with their cattle far out on the plains.  Did they know\nof the great danger, I wondered.  All the way down the glen I saw no\nsign of human presence.  The game-birds mocked me from the thicket; a\nbrace of white _berghaan_ circled far up in the blue; and I had for\npleasant comrade the brawling river.  I dismounted once to drink, and\nin that green haven of flowers and ferns I was struck sharply with a\nsense of folly.  Here were we wretched creatures of men making for each\nother's throats, and outraging the good earth which God had made so\nfair a habitation.\n\nI had resolved on a short cut to Umvelos', avoiding the neighbourhood\nof Sikitola's kraal, so when the river emerged from the glen I crossed\nit and struck into the bush.  I had not gone far before I realized that\nsomething strange was going on. It was like the woods on the Berg a\nweek before.  I had the impression of many people moving in the bush,\nand now and then I caught a glimpse of them.  My first thought was that\nI should be stopped, but soon it appeared that these folk had business\nof their own which did not concern me.  I was conscious of being\nwatched, yet it was clear that the bush folk were not there for the\npurpose of watching me.\n\nFor a little I kept my spirits, but as the hours passed with the same\nuncanny hurrying to and fro all about me my nerves began to suffer.\nWeeks of espionage at Blaauwildebeestefontein had made me jumpy.  These\npeople apparently meant me no ill, and had no time to spare on me, But\nthe sensation of moving through them was like walking on a black-dark\nnight with precipices all around.  I felt odd quiverings between my\nshoulder blades where a spear might be expected to lodge. Overhead was\na great blue sky and a blazing sun, and I could see the path running\nclear before me between the walls of scrub.  But it was like midnight\nto me, a midnight of suspicion and unknown perils.  I began to wish\nheartily I had never come.\n\nI stopped for my midday meal at a place called Taqui, a grassy glade in\nthe bush where a tiny spring of water crept out from below a big stone,\nonly to disappear in the sand.  Here I sat and smoked for half an hour,\nwondering what was going to become of me.  The air was very still, but\nI could hear the rustle of movement somewhere within a hundred yards.\nThe hidden folk were busy about their own ends, and I regretted that I\nhad not taken the road by Sikitola's and seen how the kraals looked.\nThey must be empty now, for the young men were already out on some\nmission.  So nervous I got that I took my pocket-book and wrote down\ncertain messages to my mother, which I implored whoever should find my\nbody to transmit.  Then, a little ashamed of my childishness, I pulled\nmyself together, and remounted.\n\nAbout three in the afternoon I came over a low ridge of bush and saw\nthe corrugated iron roof of the store and the gleam of water from the\nLabongo.  The sight encouraged me, for at any rate it meant the end of\nthis disquieting ride.  Here the bush changed to trees of some size,\nand after leaving the ridge the road plunged for a little into a thick\nshade.  I had forgotten for a moment the folk in the bush, and when a\nman stepped out of the thicket I pulled up my horse with a start.\n\nIt was a tall native, who carried himself proudly, and after a glance\nat me, stalked along at my side.  He wore curious clothes, for he had a\nkind of linen tunic, and around his waist hung a kilt of leopard-skin.\nIn such a man one would have looked for a _ting-kop_,[1] but instead he\nhad a mass of hair, not like a Kaffir's wool, but long and curled like\nsome popular musician's.  I should have been prepared for the face, but\nthe sight of it sent a sudden chill of fright through my veins.  For\nthere was the curved nose, the deep flashing eyes, and the cruel lips\nof my enemy of the Kirkcaple shore.\n\nColin was deeply suspicious and followed his heels growling, but he\nnever turned his head.\n\n'The day is warm, father,' I said in Kaffir.  'Do you go far?'\n\nHe slackened his pace till he was at my elbow.  'But a short way,\nBaas,' he replied in English; 'I go to the store yonder.'\n\n'Well met, then,' said I, 'for I am the storekeeper.  You will find\nlittle in it, for it is newly built and not yet stocked.  I have ridden\nover to see to it.'\n\nHe turned his face to me.  'That is bad news.  I had hoped for food and\ndrink yonder.  I have travelled far, and in the chill nights I desire a\ncover for my head.  Will the Baas allow me to sleep the night in an\nouthouse?'\n\nBy this time I had recovered my nerve, and was ready to play the part I\nhad determined on.  'Willingly,' I said.  'You may sleep in the\nstoreroom if you care.  You will find sacks for bedding, and the place\nis snug enough on a cold night.'\n\nHe thanked me with a grave dignity which I had never seen in any\nKaffir.  As my eye fell on his splendid proportions I forgot all else\nin my admiration of the man.  In his minister's clothes he had looked\nonly a heavily built native, but now in his savage dress I saw how\nnoble a figure he made.  He must have been at least six feet and a\nhalf, but his chest was so deep and his shoulders so massive that one\ndid not remark his height.  He put a hand on my saddle, and I remember\nnoting how slim and fine it was, more like a high-bred woman's than a\nman's.  Curiously enough he filled me with a certain confidence.\n\n'I do not think you will cut my throat,' I said to myself. 'Your game\nis too big for common murder.'\n\nThe store at Umvelos' stood as I had left it.  There was the sjambok I\nhad forgotten still lying on the window sill.  I unlocked the door, and\na stifling smell of new paint came out to meet me.  Inside there was\nnothing but the chairs and benches, and in a corner the pots and pans I\nhad left against my next visit.  I unlocked the cupboard and got out a\nfew stores, opened the windows of the bedroom next door, and flung my\nkaross on the cartel which did duty as bed.  Then I went out to find\nLaputa standing patiently in the sunshine.\n\nI showed him the outhouse where I had said he might sleep. It was the\nlargest room in the store, but wholly unfurnished. A pile of barrels\nand packing-cases stood in the corner, and there was enough sacking to\nmake a sort of bed.\n\n'I am going to make tea,' I said.  'If you have come far you would\nmaybe like a cup?'\n\nHe thanked me, and I made a fire in the grate and put on the kettle to\nboil.  Then I set on the table biscuits, and sardines, and a pot of\njam.  It was my business now to play the fool, and I believe I\nsucceeded to admiration in the part.  I blush to-day to think of the\nstuff I talked.  First I made him sit on a chair opposite me, a thing\nno white man in the country would have done.  Then I told him\naffectionately that I liked natives, that they were fine fellows and\nbetter men than the dirty whites round about.  I explained that I was\nfresh from England, and believed in equal rights for all men, white or\ncoloured.  God forgive me, but I think I said I hoped to see the day\nwhen Africa would belong once more to its rightful masters.\n\nHe heard me with an impassive face, his grave eyes studying every line\nof me.  I am bound to add that he made a hearty meal, and drank three\ncups of strong tea of my brewing.  I gave him a cigar, one of a lot I\nhad got from a Dutch farmer who was experimenting with their\nmanufacture--and all the while I babbled of myself and my opinions.  He\nmust have thought me half-witted, and indeed before long I began to be\nof the same opinion myself.  I told him that I meant to sleep the night\nhere, and go back in the morning to Blaauwildebeestefontein, and then\nto Pietersdorp for stores.  By-and-by I could see that he had ceased to\npay any attention to what I said.  I was clearly set down in his mind\nas a fool.  Instead he kept looking at Colin, who was lying blinking in\nthe doorway, one wary eye cocked on the stranger.\n\n'You have a fine dog,' he observed.\n\n'Yes,' I agreed, with one final effort of mendacity, 'he's fine to look\nat, but he has no grit in him.  Any mongrel from a kraal can make him\nturn tail.  Besides, he is a born fool and can't find his way home.\nI'm thinking of getting rid of him.'\n\nLaputa rose and his eye fell on the dog's back.  I could see that he\nsaw the lie of his coat, and that he did not agree with me.\n\n'The food was welcome, Baas,' he said.  'If you will listen to me I can\nrepay hospitality with advice.  You are a stranger here.  Trouble\ncomes, and if you are wise you will go back to the Berg.'\n\n'I don't know what you mean,' I said, with an air of cheerful idiocy.\n'But back to the Berg I go the first thing in the morning.  I hate\nthese stinking plains.'\n\n'It were wise to go to-night,' he said, with a touch of menace in his\ntone.\n\n'I can't,' I said, and began to sing the chorus of a ridiculous\nmusic-hall song--\n\n     'There's no place like home--but\n     I'm afraid to go home in the dark.'\n\nLaputa shrugged his shoulders, stepped over the bristling Colin, and\nwent out.  When I looked after him two minutes later he had disappeared.\n\n\n[1] The circlet into which, with the aid of gum, Zulu warriors weave\ntheir hair.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\nTHE STORE AT UMVELOS'\n\nI sat down on a chair and laboured to collect my thoughts. Laputa had\ngone, and would return sooner or later with Henriques.  If I was to\nremain alive till morning, both of them must be convinced that I was\nharmless.  Laputa was probably of that opinion, but Henriques would\nrecognize me, and I had no wish to have that yellow miscreant\ninvestigating my character. There was only one way out of it--I must be\nincapably drunk.  There was not a drop of liquor in the store, but I\nfound an old whisky bottle half full of methylated spirits.  With this\nI thought I might raise an atmosphere of bad whisky, and for the rest I\nmust trust to my meagre gifts as an actor.\n\nSupposing I escaped suspicion, Laputa and Henriques would meet in the\nouthouse, and I must find some means of overhearing them.  Here I was\nfairly baffled.  There was no window in the outhouse save in the roof,\nand they were sure to shut and bolt the door.  I might conceal myself\namong the barrels inside; but apart from the fact that they were likely\nto search them before beginning their conference, it was quite certain\nthat they would satisfy themselves that I was safe in the other end of\nthe building before going to the outhouse.\n\nSuddenly I thought of the cellar which we had built below the store.\nThere was an entrance by a trap-door behind the counter, and another in\nthe outhouse.  I had forgotten the details, but my hope was that the\nsecond was among the barrels.  I shut the outer door, prised up the\ntrap, and dropped into the vault, which had been floored roughly with\ngreen bricks.  Lighting match after match, I crawled to the other end\nand tried to lift the door.  It would not stir, so I guessed that the\nbarrels were on the top of it.  Back to the outhouse I went, and found\nthat sure enough a heavy packing-case was standing on a corner.  I\nfixed it slightly open, so as to let me hear, and so arranged the odds\nand ends round about it that no one looking from the floor of the\nouthouse would guess at its existence.  It occurred to me that the\nconspirators would want seats, so I placed two cases at the edge of the\nheap, that they might not be tempted to forage in the interior.\n\nThis done, I went back to the store and proceeded to rig myself out for\nmy part.  The cellar had made me pretty dirty, and I added some new\ndaubs to my face.  My hair had grown longish, and I ran my hands\nthrough it till it stood up like a cockatoo's crest.  Then I cunningly\ndisposed the methylated spirits in the places most likely to smell.  I\nburned a little on the floor, I spilt some on the counter and on my\nhands, and I let it dribble over my coat.  In five minutes I had made\nthe room stink like a shebeen.  I loosened the collar of my shirt, and\nwhen I looked at myself in the cover of my watch I saw a specimen of\ndebauchery which would have done credit to a Saturday night's police\ncell.\n\nBy this time the sun had gone down, but I thought it better to kindle\nno light.  It was the night of the full moon--for which reason, I\nsupposed, Laputa had selected it--and in an hour or two the world would\nbe lit with that ghostly radiance.  I sat on the counter while the\nminutes passed, and I confess I found the time of waiting very trying\nfor my courage.  I had got over my worst nervousness by having\nsomething to do, but whenever I was idle my fears returned.  Laputa had\na big night's work before him, and must begin soon.  My vigil, I told\nmyself, could not be long.\n\nMy pony was stalled in a rough shed we had built opposite the store.  I\ncould hear him shaking his head and stamping the ground above the\ncroaking of the frogs by the Labongo. Presently it seemed to me that\nanother sound came from behind the store--the sound of horses' feet and\nthe rattle of bridles.  It was hushed for a moment, and then I heard\nhuman voices.  The riders had tied up their horses to a tree and were\ncoming nearer.\n\nI sprawled gracefully on the counter, the empty bottle in my hand, and\nmy eyes fixed anxiously on the square of the door, which was filled\nwith the blue glimmer of the late twilight. The square darkened, and\ntwo men peered in.  Colin growled from below the counter, but with one\nhand I held the scruff of his neck.\n\n'Hullo,' I said, 'ish that my black friend?  Awfly shorry, old man, but\nI've f'nish'd th' whisky.  The bo-o-ottle shempty,' and I waved it\nupside down with an imbecile giggle.\n\nLaputa said something which I did not catch.  Henriques laughed an ugly\nlaugh.\n\n'We had better make certain of him,' he said.\n\nThe two argued for a minute, and then Laputa seemed to prevail.  The\ndoor was shut and the key, which I had left in the lock, turned on me.\n\nI gave them five minutes to get to the outhouse and settle to business.\nThen I opened the trap, got into the cellar, and crawled to the other\nend.  A ray of light was coming through the partially raised door.  By\na blessed chance some old bricks had been left behind, and of these I\nmade a footstool, which enabled me to get my back level with the door\nand look out. My laager of barrels was intact, but through a gap I had\nleft I could see the two men sitting on the two cases I had provided\nfor them.  A lantern was set between them, and Henriques was drinking\nout of a metal flask.\n\nHe took something--I could not see what--out of his pocket, and held it\nbefore his companion.\n\n'Spoils of war,' he said.  'I let Sikitola's men draw first blood. They\nneeded it to screw up their courage.  Now they are as wild as Umbooni's.\n\nLaputa asked a question.\n\n'It was the Dutchmen, who were out on the Koodoo Flats with their\ncattle.  Man, it's no good being squeamish.  Do you think you can talk\nover these surly back-veld fools?  If we had not done it, the best of\ntheir horses would now be over the Berg to give warning.  Besides, I\ntell you, Sikitola's men wanted blooding.  I did for the old swine,\nCoetzee, with my own hands.  Once he set his dogs on me, and I don't\nforget an injury.'\n\nLaputa must have disapproved, for Henriques' voice grew high.\n\n'Run the show the way you please,' he cried; 'but don't blame me if you\nmake a hash of it.  God, man, do you think you are going to work a\nrevolution on skim milk?  If I had my will, I would go in and stick a\nknife in the drunken hog next door.'\n\n'He is safe enough,' Laputa replied.  'I gave him the chance of life,\nand he laughed at me.  He won't get far on his road home.'\n\nThis was pleasant hearing for me, but I scarcely thought of myself.  I\nwas consumed with a passion of fury against the murdering yellow devil.\nWith Laputa I was not angry; he was an open enemy, playing a fair game.\nBut my fingers itched to get at the Portugoose--that double-dyed\ntraitor to his race.  As I thought of my kindly old friends, lying\nbutchered with their kinsfolk out in the bush, hot tears of rage came\nto my eyes. Perfect love casteth out fear, the Bible says; but, to\nspeak it reverently, so does perfect hate.  Not for safety and a king's\nransom would I have drawn back from the game.  I prayed for one thing\nonly, that God in His mercy would give me the chance of settling with\nHenriques.\n\nI fancy I missed some of the conversation, being occupied with my own\npassion.  At any rate, when I next listened the two were deep in plans.\nMaps were spread beside them, and Laputa's delicate forefinger was\ntracing a route.  I strained my ears, but could catch only a few names.\nApparently they were to keep in the plains till they had crossed the\nKlein Labongo and the Letaba.  I thought I caught the name of the ford\nof the latter; it sounded like Dupree's Drift.  After that the talk\nbecame plainer, for Laputa was explaining in his clear voice. The force\nwould leave the bush, ascend the Berg by the glen of the Groot Letaba,\nand the first halt would be called at a place called Inanda's Kraal,\nwhere a promontory of the high-veld juts out behind the peaks called\nthe Wolkberg or Cloud Mountains.  All this was very much to the point,\nand the names sunk into my memory like a die into wax.\n\n'Meanwhile,' said Laputa, 'there is the gathering at Ntabakaikonjwa.[1]\nIt will take us three hours' hard riding to get there.'\n\nWhere on earth was Ntabakaikonjwa?  It must be the native name for the\nRooirand, for after all Laputa was not likely to use the Dutch word for\nhis own sacred place.\n\n'Nothing has been forgotten.  The men are massed below the cliffs, and\nthe chiefs and the great indunas will enter the Place of the Snake.\nThe door will be guarded, and only the password will get a man through.\nThat word is \"Immanuel,\" which means, \"God with us.\"'\n\n'Well, when we get there, what happens?' Henriques asked with a laugh.\n'What kind of magic will you spring on us?'\n\nThere was a strong contrast between the flippant tone of the Portugoose\nand the grave voice which answered him.\n\n'The Keeper of the Snake will open the holy place, and bring forth the\nIsetembiso sami.[2]  As the leader of my people, I will assume the\ncollar of Umkulunkulu in the name of our God and the spirits of the\ngreat dead.'\n\n'But you don't propose to lead the march in a necklace of rubies,' said\nHenriques, with a sudden eagerness in his voice.\n\nAgain Laputa spoke gravely, and, as it were, abstractedly.  I heard the\nvoice of one whose mind was fixed on a far horizon.\n\n'When I am acclaimed king, I restore the Snake to its Keeper, and swear\nnever to clasp it on my neck till I have led my people to victory.'\n\n'I see,' said Henriques.  'What about the purification you mentioned?'\n\nI had missed this before and listened earnestly.\n\n'The vows we take in the holy place bind us till we are purged of them\nat Inanda's Kraal.  Till then no blood must be shed and no flesh eaten.\nIt was the fashion of our forefathers.'\n\n'Well, I think you've taken on a pretty risky job,' Henriques said.\n'You propose to travel a hundred miles, binding yourself not to strike\na blow.  It is simply putting yourself at the mercy of any police\npatrol.'\n\n'There will be no patrol,' Laputa replied.  'Our march will be as\nsecret and as swift as death.  I have made my preparations.'\n\n'But suppose you met with opposition,' the Portugoose persisted, 'would\nthe rule hold?'\n\n'If any try to stop us, we shall tie them hand and foot, and carry them\nwith us.  Their fate will be worse than if they had been slain in\nbattle.'\n\n'I see,' said Henriques, whistling through his teeth.  'Well, before we\nstart this vow business, I think I'll go back and settle that\nstorekeeper.'\n\nLaputa shook his head.  'Will you be serious and hear me? We have no\ntime to knife harmless fools.  Before we start for Ntabakaikonjwa I\nmust have from you the figures of the arming in the south.  That is the\none thing which remains to be settled.'\n\nI am certain these figures would have been most interesting, but I\nnever heard them.  My feet were getting cramped with standing on the\nbricks, and I inadvertently moved them.  The bricks came down with a\nrattle, and unfortunately in slipping I clutched at the trap.  This was\ntoo much for my frail prop, and the door slammed down with a great\nnoise.\n\nHere was a nice business for the eavesdropper!  I scurried along the\npassage as stealthily as I could and clambered back into the store,\nwhile I heard the sound of Laputa and Henriques ferreting among the\nbarrels.  I managed to throttle Colin and prevent him barking, but I\ncould not get the confounded trap to close behind me.  Something had\njammed in it, and it remained half a foot open.\n\nI heard the two approaching the door, and I did the best thing that\noccurred to me.  I pulled Colin over the trap, rolled on the top of\nhim, and began to snore heavily as if in a drunken slumber.\n\nThe key was turned, and the gleam of a lantern was thrown on the wall.\nIt flew up and down as its bearer cast the light into the corners.\n\n'By God, he's gone,' I heard Henriques say.  'The swine was listening,\nand he has bolted now.'\n\n'He won't bolt far,' Laputa said.  'He is here.  He is snoring behind\nthe counter.'\n\nThese were anxious moments for me.  I had a firm grip on Colin's\nthroat, but now and then a growl escaped, which was fortunately blended\nwith my snores.  I felt that a lantern was flashed on me, and that the\ntwo men were peering down at the heap on the half-opened trap.  I think\nthat was the worst minute I ever spent, for, as I have said, my courage\nwas not so bad in action, but in a passive game it oozed out of my\nfingers.\n\n'He is safe enough,' Laputa said, after what seemed to me an eternity.\n'The noise was only the rats among the barrels.' I thanked my Maker\nthat they had not noticed the other trap-door. 'All the same I think\nI'll make him safer,' said Henriques.\n\nLaputa seemed to have caught him by the arm.\n\n'Come back and get to business,' he said.  'I've told you I'll have no\nmore murder.  You will do as I tell you, Mr Henriques.'\n\nI did not catch the answer, but the two went out and locked the door.\nI patted the outraged Colin, and got to my feet with an aching side\nwhere the confounded lid of the trap had been pressing.  There was no\ntime to lose for the two in the outhouse would soon be setting out, and\nI must be before them.\n\nWith no better light than a ray of the moon through the window, I wrote\na message on a leaf from my pocket-book.  I told of the plans I had\noverheard, and especially I mentioned Dupree's Drift on the Letaba.  I\nadded that I was going to the Rooirand to find the secret of the cave,\nand in one final sentence implored Arcoll to do justice on the\nPortugoose.  That was all, for I had no time for more.  I carefully\ntied the paper with a string below the collar of the dog.\n\nThen very quietly I went into the bedroom next door--the side of the\nstore farthest from the outhouse.  The place was flooded with\nmoonlight, and the window stood open, as I had left it in the\nafternoon.  As softly as I could I swung Colin over the sill and\nclambered after him.  In my haste I left my coat behind me with my\npistol in the pocket.\n\nNow came a check.  My horse was stabled in the shed, and that was close\nto the outhouse.  The sound of leading him out would most certainly\nbring Laputa and Henriques to the door. In that moment I all but\nchanged my plans.  I thought of slipping back to the outhouse and\ntrying to shoot the two men as they came forth.  But I reflected that,\nbefore I could get them both, one or other would probably shoot me.\nBesides, I had a queer sort of compunction about killing Laputa.  I\nunderstood now why Arcoll had stayed his hand from murder, and I was\nbeginning to be of his opinion on our arch-enemy.\n\nThen I remembered the horses tied up in the bush.  One of them I could\nget with perfect safety.  I ran round the end of the store and into the\nthicket, keeping on soft grass to dull my tread.  There, tied up to a\nmerula tree, were two of the finest beasts I had seen in Africa.  I\nselected the better, an Africander stallion of the _blaauw-schimmel_, or\nblue-roan type, which is famous for speed and endurance.  Slipping his\nbridle from the branch, I led him a little way into the bush in the\ndirection of the Rooirand.\n\nThen I spoke to Colin.  'Home with you,' I said.  'Home, old man, as if\nyou were running down a tsessebe.'[3]\n\nThe dog seemed puzzled.  'Home,' I said again, pointing west in the\ndirection of the Berg.  'Home, you brute.'\n\nAnd then he understood.  He gave one low whine, and cast a reproachful\neye on me and the blue roan.  Then he turned, and with his head down\nset off with great lopes on the track of the road I had ridden in the\nmorning.\n\nA second later and I was in the saddle, riding hell-for-leather for the\nnorth.\n\n\n[1] Literally, 'The Hill which is not to be pointed at'.\n\n[2] Literally, 'Very sacred thing'.\n\n[3] A species of buck, famous for its speed.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\nI GO TREASURE-HUNTING\n\nFor a mile or so I kept the bush, which was open and easy to ride\nthrough, and then turned into the path.  The moon was high, and the\nworld was all a dim dark green, with the track a golden ivory band\nbefore me.  I had looked at my watch before I started, and seen that it\nwas just after eight o'clock.  I had a great horse under me, and less\nthan thirty miles to cover. Midnight should see me at the cave.  With\nthe password I would gain admittance, and there would wait for Laputa\nand Henriques.  Then, if my luck held, I should see the inner workings\nof the mystery which had puzzled me ever since the Kirkcaple shore.  No\ndoubt I should be roughly treated, tied up prisoner, and carried with\nthe army when the march began. But till Inanda's Kraal my life was\nsafe, and before that came the ford of the Letaba.  Colin would carry\nmy message to Arcoll, and at the Drift the tables would be turned on\nLaputa's men.\n\nLooking back in cold blood, it seems the craziest chain of accidents to\ncount on for preservation.  A dozen possibilities might have shattered\nany link of it.  The password might be wrong, or I might never get the\nlength of those who knew it. The men in the cave might butcher me out\nof hand, or Laputa might think my behaviour a sufficient warrant for\nthe breach of the solemnest vow.  Colin might never get to\nBlaauwildebeestefontein, Laputa might change his route of march, or\nArcoll's men might fail to hold the Drift.  Indeed, the other day at\nPortincross I was so overcome by the recollection of the perils I had\ndared and God's goodness towards me that I built a new hall for the\nparish kirk as a token of gratitude.\n\nFortunately for mankind the brain in a life of action turns more to the\nmatter in hand than to conjuring up the chances of the future.\nCertainly it was in no discomfort of mind that I swung along the\nmoonlit path to the north.  Truth to tell, I was almost happy.  The\nfirst honours in the game had fallen to me. I knew more about Laputa\nthan any man living save Henriques; I had my finger on the central\npulse of the rebellion. There was hid treasure ahead of me--a great\nnecklace of rubies, Henriques had said.  Nay, there must be more, I\nargued.  This cave of the Rooirand was the headquarters of the rising,\nand there must be stored their funds--diamonds, and the gold they had\nbeen bartered for.  I believe that every man has deep in his soul a\npassion for treasure-hunting, which will often drive a coward into\nprodigies of valour.  I lusted for that treasure of jewels and gold.\nOnce I had been high-minded, and thought of my duty to my country, but\nin that night ride I fear that what I thought of was my duty to enrich\nDavid Crawfurd.  One other purpose simmered in my head.  I was devoured\nwith wrath against Henriques.  Indeed, I think that was the strongest\nmotive for my escapade, for even before I heard Laputa tell of the vows\nand the purification, I had it in my mind to go at all costs to the\ncave.  I am a peaceable man at most times, but I think I would rather\nhave had the Portugoose's throat in my hands than the collar of Prester\nJohn.\n\nBut behind my thoughts was one master-feeling, that Providence had\ngiven me my chance and I must make the most of it. Perhaps the\nCalvinism of my father's preaching had unconsciously taken grip of my\nsoul.  At any rate I was a fatalist in creed, believing that what was\nwilled would happen, and that man was but a puppet in the hands of his\nMaker.  I looked on the last months as a clear course which had been\nmapped out for me.  Not for nothing had I been given a clue to the\nstrange events which were coming.  It was foreordained that I should go\nalone to Umvelos', and in the promptings of my own fallible heart I\nbelieved I saw the workings of Omnipotence.  Such is our moral\narrogance, and yet without such a belief I think that mankind would\nhave ever been content to bide sluggishly at home.\n\nI passed the spot where on my former journey I had met the horses, and\nknew that I had covered more than half the road. My ear had been alert\nfor the sound of pursuit, but the bush was quiet as the grave.  The man\nwho rode my pony would find him a slow traveller, and I pitied the poor\nbeast bucketed along by an angry rider.  Gradually a hazy wall of\npurple began to shimmer before me, apparently very far off.  I knew the\nramparts of the Rooirand, and let my _schimmel_ feel my knees in his\nribs.  Within an hour I should be at the cliff's foot.\n\nI had trusted for safety to the password, but as it turned out I owed\nmy life mainly to my horse.  For, a mile or so from the cliffs, I came\nto the fringes of a great army.  The bush was teeming with men, and I\nsaw horses picketed in bunches, and a multitude of Cape-carts and light\nwagons.  It was like a colossal gathering for _naachtmaal_[1] at a Dutch\ndorp, but every man was black.  I saw through a corner of my eye that\nthey were armed with guns, though many carried in addition their spears\nand shields.  Their first impulse was to stop me.  I saw guns fly to\nshoulders, and a rush towards the path.  The boldest game was the\nsafest, so I dug my heels into the _schimmel_ and shouted for a passage.\n'Make way!' I cried in Kaffir.  'I bear a message from the Inkulu.[2]\nClear out, you dogs!'\n\nThey recognized the horse, and fell back with a salute.  Had I but\nknown it, the beast was famed from the Zambesi to the Cape.  It was\ntheir king's own charger I rode, and who dared question such a warrant?\nI heard the word pass through the bush, and all down the road I got the\nsalute.  In that moment I fervently thanked my stars that I had got\naway first, for there would have been no coming second for me.\n\nAt the cliff-foot I found a double line of warriors who had the\nappearance of a royal guard, for all were tall men with leopard-skin\ncloaks.  Their rifle-barrels glinted in the moon-light, and the sight\nsent a cold shiver down my back.  Above them, among the scrub and along\nthe lower slopes of the kranzes, I could see further lines with the\nsame gleaming weapons.  The Place of the Snake was in strong hands that\nnight.\n\nI dismounted and called for a man to take my horse.  Two of the guards\nstepped forward in silence and took the bridle.  This left the track to\nthe cave open, and with as stiff a back as I could command, but a sadly\nfluttering heart, I marched through the ranks.\n\nThe path was lined with guards, all silent and rigid as graven images.\nAs I stumbled over the stones I felt that my appearance scarcely fitted\nthe dignity of a royal messenger.  Among those splendid men-at-arms I\nshambled along in old breeches and leggings, hatless, with a dirty\nface, dishevelled hair, and a torn flannel shirt.  My mind was no\nbetter than my body, for now that I had arrived I found my courage\ngone.  Had it been possible I would have turned tail and fled, but the\nboats were burned behind me, and I had no choice.  I cursed my rash\nfolly, and wondered at my exhilaration of an hour ago.  I was going\ninto the black mysterious darkness, peopled by ten thousand cruel foes.\nMy knees rubbed against each other, and I thought that no man had ever\nbeen in more deadly danger.\n\nAt the entrance to the gorge the guards ceased and I went on alone.\nHere there was no moonlight, and I had to feel my way by the sides.  I\nmoved very slowly, wondering how soon I should find the end my folly\ndemanded.  The heat of the ride had gone, and I remember feeling my\nshirt hang clammily on my shoulders.\n\nSuddenly a hand was laid on my breast, and a voice demanded, 'The word?'\n\n'Immanuel,' I said hoarsely.\n\nThen unseen hands took both my arms, and I was led farther into the\ndarkness.  My hopes revived for a second.  The password had proved\ntrue, and at any rate I should enter the cave.\n\nIn the darkness I could see nothing, but I judged that we stopped\nbefore the stone slab which, as I remembered, filled the extreme end of\nthe gorge.  My guide did something with the right-hand wall, and I felt\nmyself being drawn into a kind of passage.  It was so narrow that two\ncould not go abreast, and so low that the creepers above scraped my\nhair.  Something clicked behind me like the turnstile at the gate of a\nshow.\n\nThen we began to ascend steps, still in utter darkness, and a great\nbooming fell on my ear.  It was the falling river which had scared me\non my former visit, and I marvelled that I had not heard it sooner.\nPresently we came out into a gleam of moonlight, and I saw that we were\ninside the gorge and far above the slab.  We followed a narrow shelf on\nits left side (or 'true right', as mountaineers would call it) until we\ncould go no farther.  Then we did a terrible thing.  Across the gorge,\nwhich here was at its narrowest, stretched a slab of stone.  Far, far\nbelow I caught the moonlight on a mass of hurrying waters. This was our\nbridge, and though I have a good head for crags, I confess I grew dizzy\nas we turned to cross it.  Perhaps it was broader than it looked; at\nany rate my guides seemed to have no fear, and strode across it as if\nit was a highway, while I followed in a sweat of fright.  Once on the\nother side, I was handed over to a second pair of guides, who led me\ndown a high passage running into the heart of the mountain.\n\nThe boom of the river sank and rose as the passage twined. Soon I saw a\ngleam of light ahead which was not the moon.  It grew larger, until\nsuddenly the roof rose and I found myself in a gigantic chamber.  So\nhigh it was that I could not make out anything of the roof, though the\nplace was brightly lit with torches stuck round the wall, and a great\nfire which burned at the farther end.  But the wonder was on the left\nside, where the floor ceased in a chasm.  The left wall was one sheet\nof water, where the river fell from the heights into the infinite\ndepth, below.  The torches and the fire made the sheer stream glow and\nsparkle like the battlements of the Heavenly City.  I have never seen\nany sight so beautiful or so strange, and for a second my breath\nstopped in admiration.\n\nThere were two hundred men or more in the chamber, but so huge was the\nplace that they seemed only a little company. They sat on the ground in\na circle, with their eyes fixed on the fire and on a figure which stood\nbefore it.  The glow revealed the old man I had seen on that morning a\nmonth before moving towards the cave.  He stood as if in a trance,\nstraight as a tree, with his arms crossed on his breast.  A robe of\nsome shining white stuff fell from his shoulders, and was clasped round\nhis middle by a broad circle of gold.  His head was shaven, and on his\nforehead was bound a disc of carved gold.  I saw from his gaze that his\nold eyes were blind.\n\n'Who comes?' he asked as I entered.\n\n'A messenger from the Inkulu,' I spoke up boldly.  'He follows soon\nwith the white man, Henriques.'\n\nThen I sat down in the back row of the circle to await events.  I\nnoticed that my neighbour was the fellow 'Mwanga whom I had kicked out\nof the store.  Happily I was so dusty that he could scarcely recognize\nme, but I kept my face turned away from him.  What with the light and\nthe warmth, the drone of the water, the silence of the folk, and my\nmental and physical stress, I grew drowsy and all but slept.\n\n\n[1] The Communion Sabbath.\n\n[2] A title applied only to the greatest chiefs.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI\n\nTHE CAVE OF THE ROOIRAND\n\nI was roused by a sudden movement.  The whole assembly stood up, and\neach man clapped his right hand to his brow and then raised it high.  A\nlow murmur of 'Inkulu' rose above the din of the water.  Laputa strode\ndown the hall, with Henriques limping behind him.  They certainly did\nnot suspect my presence in the cave, nor did Laputa show any ruffling\nof his calm.  Only Henriques looked weary and cross.  I guessed he had\nhad to ride my pony.\n\nThe old man whom I took to be the priest advanced towards Laputa with\nhis hands raised over his head.  A pace before they met he halted, and\nLaputa went on his knees before him.  He placed his hands on his head,\nand spoke some words which I could not understand.  It reminded me, so\nqueer are the tricks of memory, of an old Sabbath-school book I used to\nhave which had a picture of Samuel ordaining Saul as king of Israel.  I\nthink I had forgotten my own peril and was enthralled by the majesty of\nthe place--the wavering torches, the dropping wall of green water,\nabove all, the figures of Laputa and the Keeper of the Snake, who\nseemed to have stepped out of an antique world.\n\nLaputa stripped off his leopard skin till he stood stark, a noble form\nof a man.  Then the priest sprinkled some herbs on the fire, and a thin\nsmoke rose to the roof.  The smell was that I had smelled on the\nKirkcaple shore, sweet, sharp, and strange enough to chill the marrow.\nAnd round the fire went the priest in widening and contracting circles,\njust as on that Sabbath evening in spring.\n\nOnce more we were sitting on the ground, all except Laputa and the\nKeeper.  Henriques was squatting in the front row, a tiny creature\namong so many burly savages.  Laputa stood with bent head in the centre.\n\nThen a song began, a wild incantation in which all joined. The old\npriest would speak some words, and the reply came in barbaric music.\nThe words meant nothing to me; they must have been in some tongue long\nsince dead.  But the music told its own tale.  It spoke of old kings\nand great battles, of splendid palaces and strong battlements, of\nqueens white as ivory, of death and life, love and hate, joy and\nsorrow.  It spoke, too, of desperate things, mysteries of horror long\nshut to the world. No Kaffir ever forged that ritual.  It must have\ncome straight from Prester John or Sheba's queen, or whoever ruled in\nAfrica when time was young.\n\nI was horribly impressed.  Devouring curiosity and a lurking nameless\nfear filled my mind.  My old dread had gone.  I was not afraid now of\nKaffir guns, but of the black magic of which Laputa had the key.\n\nThe incantation died away, but still herbs were flung on the fire, till\nthe smoke rose in a great cloud, through which the priest loomed misty\nand huge.  Out of the smoke-wreaths his voice came high and strange.\nIt was as if some treble stop had been opened in a great organ, as\nagainst the bass drone of the cataract.\n\nHe was asking Laputa questions, to which came answers in that rich\nvoice which on board the liner had preached the gospel of Christ.  The\ntongue I did not know, and I doubt if my neighbours were in better\ncase.  It must have been some old sacred language--Phoenician, Sabaean,\nI know not what--which had survived in the rite of the Snake.\n\nThen came silence while the fire died down and the smoke eddied away in\nwreaths towards the river.  The priest's lips moved as if in prayer: of\nLaputa I saw only the back, and his head was bowed.\n\nSuddenly a rapt cry broke from the Keeper.  'God has spoken,' he cried.\n'The path is clear.  The Snake returns to the House of its Birth.'\n\nAn attendant led forward a black goat, which bleated feebly. With a\nhuge antique knife the old man slit its throat, catching the blood in a\nstone ewer.  Some was flung on the fire, which had burned small and low.\n\n'Even so,' cried the priest, 'will the king quench in blood the\nhearth-fires of his foes.'\n\nThen on Laputa's forehead and bare breast he drew a bloody cross. 'I\nseal thee,' said the voice, 'priest and king of God's people.' The ewer\nwas carried round the assembly, and each dipped his finger in it and\nmarked his forehead.  I got a dab to add to the other marks on my face.\n\n'Priest and king of God's people,' said the voice again, 'I call thee\nto the inheritance of John.  Priest and king was he, king of kings,\nlord of hosts, master of the earth.  When he ascended on high he left\nto his son the sacred Snake, the ark of his valour, to be God's dower\nand pledge to the people whom He has chosen.'\n\nI could not make out what followed.  It seemed to be a long roll of the\nkings who had borne the Snake.  None of them I knew, but at the end I\nthought I caught the name of Tchaka the Terrible, and I remembered\nArcoll's tale.\n\nThe Keeper held in his arms a box of curiously wrought ivory, about two\nfeet long and one broad.  He was standing beyond the ashes, from which,\nin spite of the blood, thin streams of smoke still ascended.  He opened\nit, and drew out something which swung from his hand like a cascade of\nred fire.\n\n'Behold the Snake,' cried the Keeper, and every man in the assembly,\nexcepting Laputa and including me, bowed his head to the ground and\ncried 'Ow.'\n\n'Ye who have seen the Snake,' came the voice, 'on you is the vow of\nsilence and peace.  No blood shall ye shed of man or beast, no flesh\nshall ye eat till the vow is taken from you.  From the hour of midnight\ntill sunrise on the second day ye are bound to God.  Whoever shall\nbreak the vow, on him shall the curse fall.  His blood shall dry in his\nveins, and his flesh shrink on his bones.  He shall be an outlaw and\naccursed, and there shall follow him through life and death the\nAvengers of the Snake.  Choose ye, my people; upon you is the vow.'\n\nBy this time we were all flat on our faces, and a great cry of assent\nwent up.  I lifted my head as much as I dared to see what would happen\nnext.\n\nThe priest raised the necklace till it shone above his head like a halo\nof blood.  I have never seen such a jewel, and I think there has never\nbeen another such on earth.  Later I was to have the handling of it,\nand could examine it closely, though now I had only a glimpse.  There\nwere fifty-five rubies in it, the largest as big as a pigeon's egg, and\nthe least not smaller than my thumbnail.  In shape they were oval, cut\non both sides en cabochon, and on each certain characters were\nengraved. No doubt this detracted from their value as gems, yet the\ncharacters might have been removed and the stones cut in facets, and\nthese rubies would still have been the noblest in the world.  I was no\njewel merchant to guess their value, but I knew enough to see that here\nwas wealth beyond human computation.  At each end of the string was a\ngreat pearl and a golden clasp.  The sight absorbed me to the exclusion\nof all fear.  I, David Crawfurd, nineteen years of age, an\nassistant-storekeeper in a back-veld dorp, was privileged to see a\nsight to which no Portuguese adventurer had ever attained.  There,\nfloating on the smoke-wreaths, was the jewel which may once have burned\nin Sheba's hair. As the priest held the collar aloft, the assembly\nrocked with a strange passion.  Foreheads were rubbed in the dust, and\nthen adoring eyes would be raised, while a kind of sobbing shook the\nworshippers.  In that moment I learned something of the secret of\nAfrica, of Prester John's empire and Tchaka's victories.\n\n'In the name of God,' came the voice, 'I deliver to the heir of John\nthe Snake of John.'\n\nLaputa took the necklet and twined it in two loops round his neck till\nthe clasp hung down over his breast.  The position changed.  The priest\nknelt before him, and received his hands on his head.  Then I knew\nthat, to the confusion of all talk about equality, God has ordained\nsome men to be kings and others to serve.  Laputa stood naked as when\nhe was born. The rubies were dulled against the background of his skin,\nbut they still shone with a dusky fire.  Above the blood-red collar his\nface had the passive pride of a Roman emperor.  Only his great eyes\ngloomed and burned as he looked on his followers.\n\n'Heir of John,' he said, 'I stand before you as priest and king.  My\nkingship is for the morrow.  Now I am the priest to make intercession\nfor my people.'\n\nHe prayed--prayed as I never heard man pray before--and to the God of\nIsrael!  It was no heathen fetich he was invoking, but the God of whom\nhe had often preached in Christian kirks.  I recognized texts from\nIsaiah and the Psalms and the Gospels, and very especially from the two\nlast chapters of Revelation.  He pled with God to forget the sins of\nhis people, to recall the bondage of Zion.  It was amazing to hear\nthese bloodthirsty savages consecrated by their leader to the meek\nservice of Christ.  An enthusiast may deceive himself, and I did not\nquestion his sincerity.  I knew his heart, black with all the lusts of\npaganism.  I knew that his purpose was to deluge the land with blood.\nBut I knew also that in his eyes his mission was divine, and that he\nfelt behind him all the armies of Heaven.\n\n_'Thou hast been a strength to the poor,' said the voice, 'a refuge\nfrom the storm, a shadow from the heat, when the blast of the Terrible\nOnes is as a storm against a wall._\n\n_'Thou shalt bring down the noise of strangers, as the heat in a dry\nplace; the branch of the Terrible Ones shall be brought low._\n\n_'And in this mountain shall the Lord of Hosts make unto all people a\nfeast of fat things, a feast of wines on the lees, of fat things full\nof marrow._\n\n_'And He will destroy in this mountain the face of the covering cast\nover all people, and the vail that is brought over all nations._\n\n_'And the rebuke of His people shall He take away from off all the\nearth; for the Lord hath spoken it.'_\n\nI listened spellbound as he prayed.  I heard the phrases familiar to me\nin my schooldays at Kirkcaple.  He had some of the tones of my father's\nvoice, and when I shut my eyes I could have believed myself a child\nagain.  So much he had got from his apprenticeship to the ministry.  I\nwondered vaguely what the good folks who had listened to him in\nchurches and halls at home would think of him now.  But there was in\nthe prayer more than the supplications of the quondam preacher. There\nwas a tone of arrogant pride, the pride of the man to whom the Almighty\nis only another and greater Lord of Hosts. He prayed less as a\nsuppliant than as an ally.  A strange emotion tingled in my blood, half\nawe, half sympathy.  As I have said, I understood that there are men\nborn to kingship.\n\nHe ceased with a benediction.  Then he put on his leopard-skin cloak\nand kilt, and received from the kneeling chief a spear and shield.  Now\nhe was more king than priest, more barbarian than Christian.  It was as\na king that he now spoke.\n\nI had heard him on board the liner, and had thought his voice the most\nwonderful I had ever met with.  But now in that great resonant hall the\nmagic of it was doubled.  He played upon the souls of his hearers as on\na musical instrument.  At will he struck the chords of pride, fury,\nhate, and mad joy. Now they would be hushed in breathless quiet, and\nnow the place would echo with savage assent.  I remember noticing that\nthe face of my neighbour, 'Mwanga, was running with tears.\n\nHe spoke of the great days of Prester John, and a hundred names I had\nnever heard of.  He pictured the heroic age of his nation, when every\nman was a warrior and hunter, and rich kraals stood in the spots now\ndesecrated by the white man, and cattle wandered on a thousand hills.\nThen he told tales of white infamy, lands snatched from their rightful\npossessors, unjust laws which forced the Ethiopian to the bondage of a\ndespised caste, the finger of scorn everywhere, and the mocking word.\nIf it be the part of an orator to rouse the passion of his hearers,\nLaputa was the greatest on earth.  'What have ye gained from the white\nman?' he cried.  'A bastard civilization which has sapped your manhood;\na false religion which would rivet on you the chains of the slave.  Ye,\nthe old masters of the land, are now the servants of the oppressor.\nAnd yet the oppressors are few, and the fear of you is in their hearts.\nThey feast in their great cities, but they see the writing on the wall,\nand their eyes are anxiously turning lest the enemy be at their gates.'\nI cannot hope in my prosaic words to reproduce that amazing discourse.\nPhrases which the hearers had heard at mission schools now suddenly\nappeared, not as the white man's learning, but as God's message to His\nown.  Laputa fitted the key to the cipher, and the meaning was clear.\nHe concluded, I remember, with a picture of the overthrow of the alien,\nand the golden age which would dawn for the oppressed.  Another\nEthiopian empire would arise, so majestic that the white man everywhere\nwould dread its name, so righteous that all men under it would live in\nease and peace.\n\nBy rights, I suppose, my blood should have been boiling at this\ntreason.  I am ashamed to confess that it did nothing of the sort.  My\nmind was mesmerized by this amazing man.  I could not refrain from\nshouting with the rest.  Indeed I was a convert, if there can be\nconversion when the emotions are dominant and there is no assent from\nthe brain.  I had a mad desire to be of Laputa's party.  Or rather, I\nlonged for a leader who should master me and make my soul his own, as\nthis man mastered his followers.  I have already said that I might have\nmade a good subaltern soldier, and the proof is that I longed for such\na general.\n\nAs the voice ceased there was a deep silence.  The hearers were in a\nsort of trance, their eyes fixed glassily on Laputa's face.  It was the\nquiet of tense nerves and imagination at white-heat.  I had to struggle\nwith a spell which gripped me equally with the wildest savage.  I\nforced myself to look round at the strained faces, the wall of the\ncascade, the line of torches.  It was the sight of Henriques that broke\nthe charm.  Here was one who had no part in the emotion.  I caught his\neye fixed on the rubies, and in it I read only a devouring greed.  It\nflashed through my mind that Laputa had a foe in his own camp, and the\nPrester's collar a votary whose passion was not that of worship.\n\nThe next thing I remember was a movement among the first ranks.  The\nchiefs were swearing fealty.  Laputa took off the collar and called God\nto witness that it should never again encircle his neck till he had led\nhis people to victory.  Then one by one the great chiefs and indunas\nadvanced, and swore allegiance with their foreheads on the ivory box.\nSuch a collection of races has never been seen.  There were tall Zulus\nand Swazis with _ringkops_ and feather head-dresses.  There were men from\nthe north with heavy brass collars and anklets; men with quills in\ntheir ears, and earrings and nose-rings; shaven heads, and heads with\nwonderfully twisted hair; bodies naked or all but naked, and bodies\nadorned with skins and necklets.  Some were light in colour, and some\nwere black as coal; some had squat negro features, and some thin,\nhigh-boned Arab faces.  But in all there was the air of mad enthusiasm.\nFor a day they were forsworn from blood, but their wild eyes and\ntwitching hands told their future purpose.\n\nFor an hour or two I had been living in a dream-world. Suddenly my\nabsorption was shattered, for I saw that my time to swear was coming.\nI sat in the extreme back row at the end nearest the entrance, and\ntherefore I should naturally be the last to go forward.  The crisis was\nnear when I should be discovered, for there was no question of my\nshirking the oath.\n\nThen for the first time since I entered the cave I realized the\nfrightful danger in which I stood.  My mind had been strung so high by\nthe ritual that I had forgotten all else.  Now came the rebound, and\nwith shaky nerves I had to face discovery and certain punishment.  In\nthat moment I suffered the worst terror of my life.  There was much to\ncome later, but by that time my senses were dulled.  Now they had been\nsharpened by what I had seen and heard, my nerves were already\nquivering and my fancy on fire.  I felt every limb shaking as 'Mwanga\nwent forward.  The cave swam before my eyes, heads were multiplied\ngiddily, and I was only dimly conscious when he rose to return.\n\nNothing would have made me advance, had I not feared Laputa less than\nmy neighbours.  They might rend me to pieces, but to him the oath was\ninviolable.  I staggered crazily to my feet, and shambled forwards.  My\neye was fixed on the ivory box, and it seemed to dance before me and\nretreat.\n\nSuddenly I heard a voice--the voice of Henriques--cry, 'By God, a spy!'\nI felt my throat caught, but I was beyond resisting.\n\nIt was released, and I was pinned by the arms.  I must have stood\nvacantly, with a foolish smile, while unchained fury raged round me.  I\nseemed to hear Laputa's voice saying, 'It is the storekeeper.'  His\nface was all that I could see, and it was unperturbed.  There was a\nmocking ghost of a smile about his lips.\n\nMyriad hands seemed to grip me and crush my breath, but above the\nclamour I heard a fierce word of command. After that I fainted.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII\n\nCAPTAIN ARCOLL SENDS A MESSAGE\n\nI once read--I think in some Latin writer--the story of a man who was\ncrushed to a jelly by the mere repeated touch of many thousand hands.\nHis murderers were not harsh, but an infinite repetition of the\ngentlest handling meant death.  I do not suppose that I was very\nbrutally manhandled in the cave. I was trussed up tight and carried out\nto the open, and left in the care of the guards.  But when my senses\nreturned I felt as if I had been cruelly beaten in every part.  The\nraw-hide bonds chafed my wrists and ankle and shoulders, but they were\nthe least part of my aches.  To be handled by a multitude of Kaffirs is\nlike being shaken by some wild animal.  Their skins are insensible to\npain, and I have seen a Zulu stand on a piece of red-hot iron without\nnoticing it till he was warned by the smell of burning hide.  Anyhow,\nafter I had been bound by Kaffir hands and tossed on Kaffir shoulders,\nI felt as if I had been in a scrimmage of mad bulls. I found myself\nlying looking up at the moon.  It was the edge of the bush, and all\naround was the stir of the army getting ready for the road.  You know\nhow a native babbles and chatters over any work he has to do.  It says\nmuch for Laputa's iron hand that now everything was done in silence.  I\nheard the nickering of horses and the jolt of carts as they turned from\nthe bush into the path.  There was the sound of hurried whispering, and\nnow and then a sharp command.  And all the while I lay, staring at the\nmoon and wondering if I was going to keep my reason.\n\nIf he who reads this doubts the discomfort of bonds let him try them\nfor himself.  Let him be bound foot and hand and left alone, and in\nhalf an hour he will be screaming for release. The sense of impotence\nis stifling, and I felt as if I were buried in some landslip instead of\nlying under the open sky, with the night wind fanning my face.  I was\nin the second stage of panic, which is next door to collapse.  I tried\nto cry, but could only raise a squeak like a bat.  A wheel started to\nrun round in my head, and, when I looked at the moon, I saw that it was\nrotating in time.  Things were very bad with me. It was 'Mwanga who\nsaved me from lunacy.  He had been appointed my keeper, and the first I\nknew of it was a violent kick in the ribs.  I rolled over on the grass\ndown a short slope. The brute squatted beside me, and prodded me with\nhis gun-barrel.\n\n'Ha, Baas,' he said in his queer English.  'Once you ordered me out of\nyour store and treated me like a dog.  It is 'Mwanga's turn now.  You\nare 'Mwanga's dog, and he will skin you with a sjambok soon.'\n\nMy wandering wits were coming back to me.  I looked into his bloodshot\neyes and saw what I had to expect.  The cheerful savage went on to\ndiscuss just the kind of beating I should get from him.  My bones were\nto be uncovered till the lash curled round my heart.  Then the jackals\nwould have the rest of me.\n\nThis was ordinary Kaffir brag, and it made me angry.  But I thought it\nbest to go cannily.\n\n'If I am to be your slave,' I managed to say, 'it would be a pity to\nbeat me so hard.  You would get no more work out of me.'\n\n'Mwanga grinned wickedly.  'You are my slave for a day and a night.\nAfter that we kill you--slowly.  You will burn till your legs fall off\nand your knees are on the ground, and then you will be chopped small\nwith knives.'\n\nThank God, my courage and common sense were coming back to me.\n\n'What happens to me to-morrow,' I said, 'is the Inkulu's business, not\nyours.  I am his prisoner.  But if you lift your hand on me to-day so\nas to draw one drop of blood the Inkulu will make short work of you.\nThe vow is upon you, and if you break it you know what happens.'  And I\nrepeated, in a fair imitation of the priest's voice, the terrible curse\nhe had pronounced in the cave.\n\nYou should have seen the change in that cur's face.  I had guessed he\nwas a coward, as he was most certainly a bully, and now I knew it.  He\nshivered, and drew his hand over his eyes.\n\n'Nay, Baas,' he pleaded, 'it was but a joke.  No harm shall come on you\nto-day.  But tomorrow--' and his ugly face grew more cheerful.\n\n'To-morrow we shall see what we shall see,' I said stoically, and a\nloud drum-beat sounded through the camp.\n\nIt was the signal for moving, for in the east a thin pale line of gold\nwas beginning to show over the trees.  The bonds at my knees and ankles\nwere cut, and I was bundled on to the back of a horse.  Then my feet\nwere strapped firmly below its belly. The bridle of my beast was tied\nto 'Mwanga's, so that there was little chance of escape even if I had\nbeen unshackled.\n\nMy thoughts were very gloomy.  So far all had happened as I planned,\nbut I seemed to have lost my nerve, and I could not believe in my\nrescue at the Letaba, while I thought of Inanda's Kraal with sheer\nhorror.  Last night I had looked into the heart of darkness, and the\nsight had terrified me.  What part should I play in the great\npurification?  Most likely that of the Biblical scapegoat.  But the\ndolour of my mind was surpassed by the discomfort of my body.  I was\nbroken with pains and weariness, and I had a desperate headache.  Also,\nbefore we had gone a mile, I began to think that I should split in two.\nThe paces of my beast were uneven, to say the best of it, and the\nbump-bump was like being on the rack.  I remembered that the saints of\nthe Covenant used to journey to prison this way, especially the great\nMr Peden, and I wondered how they liked it.  When I hear of a man doing\na brave deed, I always want to discover whether at the time he was well\nand comfortable in body. That, I am certain, is the biggest ingredient\nin courage, and those who plan and execute great deeds in bodily\nweakness have my homage as truly heroic.  For myself, I had not the\nspirit of a chicken as I jogged along at 'Mwanga's side.  I wished he\nwould begin to insult me, if only to distract my mind, but he kept\nobstinately silent.  He was sulky, and I think rather afraid of me.\n\nAs the sun got up I could see something of the host around me.  I am no\nhand at guessing numbers, but I should put the fighting men I saw at\nnot less than twenty thousand.  Every man of them was on this side his\nprime, and all were armed with good rifles and bandoliers.  There were\nnone of your old roers[1] and decrepit Enfields, which I had seen signs\nof in Kaffir kraals.  These guns were new, serviceable Mausers, and the\nmen who bore them looked as if they knew how to handle them.  There\nmust have been long months of training behind this show, and I\nmarvelled at the man who had organized it.  I saw no field-guns, and\nthe little transport they had was evidently for food only.  We did not\ntravel in ranks like an orthodox column.  About a third of the force\nwas mounted, and this formed the centre.  On each wing the infantry\nstraggled far afield, but there was method in their disorder, for in\nthe bush close ranks would have been impossible.  At any rate we kept\nwonderfully well together, and when we mounted a knoll the whole army\nseemed to move in one piece.  I was well in the rear of the centre\ncolumn, but from the crest of a slope I sometimes got a view in front.\nI could see nothing of Laputa, who was probably with the van, but in\nthe very heart of the force I saw the old priest of the Snake, with his\ntreasure carried in the kind of litter which the Portuguese call a\nmachila, between rows of guards.  A white man rode beside him, whom I\njudged to be Henriques.  Laputa trusted this fellow, and I wondered\nwhy.  I had not forgotten the look on his face while he had stared at\nthe rubies in the cave.  I had a notion that the Portugoose might be an\nunsuspected ally of mine, though for blackguard reasons.\n\nAbout ten o'clock, as far as I could judge by the sun, we passed\nUmvelos', and took the right bank of the Labongo. There was nothing in\nthe store to loot, but it was overrun by Kaffirs, who carried off the\nbenches for firewood.  It gave me an odd feeling to see the remains of\nthe meal at which I had entertained Laputa in the hands of a dozen\nwarriors.  I thought of the long sunny days when I had sat by my\nnachtmaal while the Dutch farmers rode in to trade.  Now these men were\nall dead, and I was on my way to the same bourne.\n\nSoon the blue line of the Berg rose in the west, and through the corner\nof my eye, as I rode, I could see the gap of the Klein Labongo.  I\nwondered if Arcoll and his men were up there watching us.  About this\ntime I began to be so wretched in body that I ceased to think of the\nfuture.  I had had no food for seventeen hours, and I was dropping from\nlack of sleep. The ache of my bones was so great that I found myself\ncrying like a baby.  What between pain and weakness and nervous\nexhaustion, I was almost at the end of my tether, and should have\nfainted dead away if a halt had not been called.  But about midday,\nafter we had crossed the track from Blaauwildebeestefontein to the\nPortuguese frontier, we came to the broad, shallow drift of the Klein\nLabongo.  It is the way of the Kaffirs to rest at noon, and on the\nother side of the drift we encamped. I remember the smell of hot earth\nand clean water as my horse scrambled up the bank.  Then came the smell\nof wood-smoke as fires were lit.  It seemed an age after we stopped\nbefore my feet were loosed and I was allowed to fall over on the\nground. I lay like a log where I fell, and was asleep in ten seconds. I\nawoke two hours later much refreshed, and with a raging hunger.  My\nankles and knees had been tied again, but the sleep had taken the worst\nstiffness out of my joints.  The natives were squatting in groups round\ntheir fires, but no one came near me.  I satisfied myself by straining\nat my bonds that this solitude gave no chance of escape.  I wanted\nfood, and I shouted on 'Mwanga, but he never came.  Then I rolled over\ninto the shadow of a wacht-en-beetje bush to get out of the glare.\n\nI saw a Kaffir on the other side of the bush who seemed to be grinning\nat me.  Slowly he moved round to my side, and stood regarding me with\ninterest.\n\n'For God's sake get me some food,' I said.\n\n'Ja, Baas,' was the answer; and he disappeared for a minute, and\nreturned with a wooden bowl of hot mealie-meal porridge, and a calabash\nfull of water.\n\nI could not use my hands, so he fed me with the blade of his knife.\nSuch porridge without salt or cream is beastly food, but my hunger was\nso great that I could have eaten a vat of it.\n\nSuddenly it appeared that the Kaffir had something to say to me.  As he\nfed me he began to speak in a low voice in English.\n\n'Baas,' he said, 'I come from Ratitswan, and I have a message for you.'\n\nI guessed that Ratitswan was the native name for Arcoll. There was no\none else likely to send a message. 'Ratitswan says,' he went on, \"'Look\nout for Dupree's Drift.\" I will be near you and cut your bonds; then\nyou must swim across when Ratitswan begins to shoot.'\n\nThe news took all the weight of care from my mind.  Colin had got home,\nand my friends were out for rescue.  So volatile is the mood of 19 that\nI veered round from black despair to an unwarranted optimism.  I saw\nmyself already safe, and Laputa's rising scattered.  I saw my hands on\nthe treasure, and Henriques' ugly neck below my heel.\n\n'I don't know your name,' I said to the Kaffir, 'but you are a good\nfellow.  When I get out of this business I won't forget you.'\n\n'There is another message, Baas,' he said.  'It is written on paper in\na strange tongue.  Turn your head to the bush, and see, I will hold it\ninside the bowl, that you may read it.'\n\nI did as I was told, and found myself looking at a dirty half-sheet of\nnotepaper, marked by the Kaffir's thumbs.  Some words were written on\nit in Wardlaw's hand; and, characteristically, in Latin, which was not\na bad cipher.  I read--\n\n'_Henricus de Letaba transeunda apud Duprei vada jam nos certiores\nfecit._'[2]\n\nI had guessed rightly.  Henriques was a traitor to the cause he had\nespoused.  Arcoll's message had given me new heart, but Wardlaw's gave\nme information of tremendous value.  I repented that I had ever\nunderrated the schoolmaster's sense. He did not come out of Aberdeen\nfor nothing.\n\nI asked the Kaffir how far it was to Dupree's Drift, and was told three\nhours' march.  We should get there after the darkening. It seemed he\nhad permission to ride with me instead of 'Mwanga, who had no love for\nthe job.  How he managed this I do not know; but Arcoll's men had their\nown ways of doing things.  He undertook to set me free when the first\nshot was fired at the ford.  Meantime I bade him leave me, to avert\nsuspicion.\n\nThere is a story of one of King Arthur's knights--Sir Percival, I\nthink--that once, riding through a forest, he found a lion fighting\nwith a serpent.  He drew his sword and helped the lion, for he thought\nit was the more natural beast of the two.  To me Laputa was the lion,\nand Henriques the serpent; and though I had no good will to either, I\nwas determined to spoil the serpent's game.  He was after the rubies,\nas I had fancied; he had never been after anything else. He had found\nout about Arcoll's preparations, and had sent him a warning, hoping, no\ndoubt, that, if Laputa's force was scattered on the Letaba, he would\nhave a chance of getting off with the necklace in the confusion.  If he\nsucceeded, he would go over the Lebombo to Mozambique, and whatever\nhappened afterwards in the rising would be no concern of Mr Henriques.\nI determined that he should fail; but how to manage it I could not see.\nHad I had a pistol, I think I would have shot him; but I had no weapon\nof any kind.  I could not warn Laputa, for that would seal my own fate,\neven if I were believed.  It was clear that Laputa must go to Dupree's\nDrift, for otherwise I could not escape; and it was equally clear that\nI must find the means of spoiling the Portugoose's game.\n\nA shadow fell across the sunlight, and I looked up to see the man I was\nthinking of standing before me.  He had a cigarette in his mouth, and\nhis hands in the pockets of his riding-breeches. He stood eyeing me\nwith a curious smile on his face.\n\n'Well, Mr Storekeeper,' he said, 'you and I have met before under\npleasanter circumstances.'\n\nI said nothing, my mind being busy with what to do at the drift.\n\n'We were shipmates, if I am not mistaken,' he said.  'I dare say you\nfound it nicer work smoking on the after-deck than lying here in the\nsun.'\n\nStill I said nothing.  If the man had come to mock me, he would get no\nchange out of David Crawfurd.\n\n'Tut, tut, don't be sulky.  You have no quarrel with me. Between\nourselves,' and he dropped his voice, 'I tried to save you; but you had\nseen rather too much to be safe.  What devil prompted you to steal a\nhorse and go to the cave?  I don't blame you for overhearing us; but if\nyou had had the sense of a louse you would have gone off to the Berg\nwith your news.  By the way, how did you manage it?  A cellar, I\nsuppose.  Our friend Laputa was a fool not to take better precautions;\nbut I must say you acted the drunkard pretty well.'\n\nThe vanity of 19 is an incalculable thing.  I rose to the fly.\n\n'I know the kind of precaution you wanted to take,' I muttered.\n\n'You heard that too?  Well, I confess I am in favour of doing a job\nthoroughly when I take it up.'\n\n'In the Koodoo Flats, for example,' I said.\n\nHe sat down beside me, and laughed softly.  'You heard my little story?\nYou are clever, Mr Storekeeper, but not quite clever enough.  What if I\ncan act a part as well as yourself?' And he thrust his yellow face\nclose to mine.\n\nI saw his meaning, and did not for a second believe him; but I had the\nsense to temporize.\n\n'Do you mean to say that you did not kill the Dutchmen, and did not\nmean to knife me?'\n\n'I mean to say that I am not a fool,' he said, lighting another\ncigarette.\n\n'I am a white man, Mr Storekeeper, and I play the white man's game.\nWhy do you think I am here?  Simply because I was the only man in\nAfrica who had the pluck to get to the heart of this business.  I am\nhere to dish Laputa, and by God I am going to do it.'\n\nI was scarcely prepared for such incredible bluff.  I knew every word\nwas a lie, but I wanted to hear more, for the man fascinated me.\n\n'I suppose you know what will happen to you,' he said, flicking the\nashes from his cigarette.  'To-morrow at Inanda's Kraal, when the vow\nis over, they will give you a taste of Kaffir habits.  Not death, my\nfriend--that would be simple enough--but a slow death with every\nrefinement of horror.  You have broken into their sacred places, and\nyou will be sacrificed to Laputa's god.  I have seen native torture\nbefore, and his own mother would run away shrieking from a man who had\nendured it.'\n\nI said nothing, but the thought made my flesh creep.\n\n'Well,' he went on, 'you're in an awkward plight, but I think I can\nhelp you.  What if I can save your life, Mr Storekeeper? You are\ntrussed up like a fowl, and can do nothing.  I am the only man alive\nwho can help you.  I am willing to do it, too--on my own terms.'\n\nI did not wait to hear those terms, for I had a shrewd guess what they\nwould be.  My hatred of Henriques rose and choked me.  I saw murder and\ntrickery in his mean eyes and cruel mouth.  I could not, to be saved\nfrom the uttermost horror, have made myself his ally.\n\n'Now listen, Mr Portugoose,' I cried.  'You tell me you are a spy.\nWhat if I shout that through the camp?  There will be short shrift for\nyou if Laputa hears it.'\n\nHe laughed loudly.  'You are a bigger fool than I took you for.  Who\nwould believe you, my friend.  Not Laputa.  Not any man in this army.\nIt would only mean tighter bonds for these long legs of yours.'\n\nBy this time I had given up all thought of diplomacy.  'Very well, you\nyellow-faced devil, you will hear my answer.  I would not take my\nfreedom from you, though I were to be boiled alive.  I know you for a\ntraitor to the white man's cause, a dirty I.D.B. swindler, whose name\nis a byword among honest men. By your own confession you are a traitor\nto this idiot rising. You murdered the Dutchmen and God knows how many\nmore, and you would fain have murdered me.  I pray to Heaven that the\nmen whose cause you have betrayed and the men whose cause you would\nbetray may join to stamp the life out of you and send your soul to\nhell. I know the game you would have me join in, and I fling your offer\nin your face.  But I tell you one thing--you are damned yourself. The\nwhite men are out, and you will never get over the Lebombo. From black\nor white you will get justice before many hours, and your carcass will\nbe left to rot in the bush.  Get out of my sight, you swine.'\n\nIn that moment I was so borne up in my passion that I forgot my bonds\nand my grave danger.  I was inspired like a prophet with a sense of\napproaching retribution.  Henriques heard me out; but his smile changed\nto a scowl, and a flush rose on his sallow cheek.\n\n'Stew in your own juice,' he said, and spat in my face.  Then he\nshouted in Kaffir that I had insulted him, and demanded that I should\nbe bound tighter and gagged.\n\nIt was Arcoll's messenger who answered his summons.  That admirable\nfellow rushed at me with a great appearance of savagery.  He made a\npretence of swathing me up in fresh rawhide ropes, but his knots were\nloose and the thing was a farce. He gagged me with what looked like a\npiece of wood, but was in reality a chunk of dry banana.  And all the\nwhile, till Henriques was out of hearing, he cursed me with a noble\ngift of tongues.\n\nThe drums beat for the advance, and once more I was hoisted on my\nhorse, while Arcoll's Kaffir tied my bridle to his own.  A Kaffir\ncannot wink, but he has a way of slanting his eyes which does as well,\nand as we moved on he would turn his head to me with this strange\ngrimace.\n\nHenriques wanted me to help him to get the rubies--that I presumed was\nthe offer he had meant to make.  Well, thought I, I will perish before\nthe jewel reaches the Portuguese's hands. He hoped for a stampede when\nArcoll opposed the crossing of the river, and in the confusion intended\nto steal the casket.  My plan must be to get as near the old priest as\npossible before we reached the ford.  I spoke to my warder and told him\nwhat I wanted.  He nodded, and in the first mile we managed to edge a\ngood way forward.  Several things came to aid us.  As I have said, we\nof the centre were not marching in close ranks, but in a loose column,\nand often it was possible by taking a short cut on rough ground to join\nthe column some distance ahead. There was a vlei, too, which many\ncircumvented, but we swam, and this helped our lead.  In a couple of\nhours we were so near the priest's litter that I could have easily\ntossed a cricket ball on the head of Henriques who rode beside it.\n\nVery soon the twilight of the winter day began to fall.  The far hills\ngrew pink and mulberry in the sunset, and strange shadows stole over\nthe bush.  Still creeping forward, we found ourselves not twenty yards\nbehind the litter, while far ahead I saw a broad, glimmering space of\nwater with a high woody bank beyond.\n\n'Dupree's Drift;' whispered my warder.  'Courage, Inkoos;[3] in an\nhour's time you will be free.'\n\n\n[1] Boer elephant guns.\n\n[2] 'Henriques has already told us about the crossing at Dupree's\nDrift.'\n\n[3] Great chief.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII\n\nTHE DRIFT OF THE LETABA\n\nThe dusk was gathering fast as we neared the stream.  From the stagnant\nreaches above and below a fine white mist was rising, but the long\nshallows of the ford were clear.  My heart was beginning to flutter\nwildly, but I kept a tight grip on myself and prayed for patience.  As\nI stared into the evening my hopes sank.  I had expected, foolishly\nenough, to see on the far bank some sign of my friends, but the tall\nbush was dead and silent.\n\nThe drift slants across the river at an acute angle, roughly S.S.W.  I\ndid not know this at the time, and was amazed to see the van of the\nmarch turn apparently up stream.  Laputa's great voice rang out in some\norder which was repeated down the column, and the wide flanks of the\nforce converged on the narrow cart-track which entered the water.  We\nhad come to a standstill while the front ranks began the passage.\n\nI sat shaking with excitement, my eyes straining into the gloom.  Water\nholds the evening light for long, and I could make out pretty clearly\nwhat was happening.  The leading horsemen rode into the stream with\nLaputa in front.  The ford is not the best going, so they had to pick\ntheir way, but in five or ten minutes they were over.  Then came some\nof the infantry of the flanks, who crossed with the water to their\nwaists, and their guns held high above their heads.  They made a\nportentous splashing, but not a sound came from their throats.  I shall\nnever know how Laputa imposed silence on the most noisy race on earth.\nSeveral thousand footmen must have followed the riders, and disappeared\ninto the far bush.  But not a shot came from the bluffs in front.\n\nI watched with a sinking heart.  Arcoll had failed, and there was to be\nno check at the drift.  There remained for me only the horrors at\nInanda's Kraal.  I resolved to make a dash for freedom, at all costs,\nand was in the act of telling Arcoll's man to cut my bonds, when a\nthought occurred to me.\n\nHenriques was after the rubies, and it was his interest to get Laputa\nacross the river before the attack began.  It was Arcoll's business to\nsplit the force, and above all to hold up the leader. Henriques would\ntell him, and for that matter he must have assumed himself, that Laputa\nwould ride in the centre of the force.  Therefore there would be no\ncheck till the time came for the priest's litter to cross.\n\nIt was well that I had not had my bonds cut.  Henriques came riding\ntowards me, his face sharp and bright as a ferret's. He pulled up and\nasked if I were safe.  My Kaffir showed my strapped elbows and feet,\nand tugged at the cords to prove their tightness.\n\n'Keep him well,' said Henriques, 'or you will answer to Inkulu.\nForward with him now and get him through the water.'  Then he turned\nand rode back.\n\nMy warder, apparently obeying orders, led me out of the column and into\nthe bush on the right hand.  Soon we were abreast of the litter and\nsome twenty yards to the west of it. The water gleamed through the\ntrees a few paces in front.  I could see the masses of infantry\nconverging on the drift, and the churning like a cascade which they\nmade in the passage.\n\nSuddenly from the far bank came an order.  It was Laputa's voice, thin\nand high-pitched, as the Kaffir cries when he wishes his words to carry\na great distance.  Henriques repeated it, and the infantry halted.  The\nriders of the column in front of the litter began to move into the\nstream.\n\nWe should have gone with them, but instead we pulled our horses back\ninto the darkness of the bush.  It seemed to me that odd things were\nhappening around the priest's litter. Henriques had left it, and dashed\npast me so close that I could have touched him.  From somewhere among\nthe trees a pistol-shot cracked into the air.\n\nAs if in answer to a signal the high bluff across the stream burst into\na sheet of fire.  'A sheet of fire' sounds odd enough for scientific\nwarfare.  I saw that my friends were using shot-guns and firing with\nblack powder into the mob in the water. It was humane and it was good\ntactics, for the flame in the grey dusk had the appearance of a heavy\nbattery of ordnance. Once again I heard Henriques' voice.  He was\nturning the column to the right.  He shouted to them to get into cover,\nand take the water higher up.  I thought, too, that from far away I\nheard Laputa.\n\nThese were maddening seconds.  We had left the business of cutting my\nbonds almost too late.  In the darkness of the bush the strips of hide\ncould only be felt for, and my Kaffir had a woefully blunt knife.\nReims are always tough to sever, and mine had to be sawn through.  Soon\nmy arms were free, and I was plucking at my other bonds.  The worst\nwere those on my ankles below the horse's belly.  The Kaffir fumbled\naway in the dark, and pricked my beast so that he reared and struck\nout. And all the while I was choking with impatience, and gabbling\nprayers to myself.\n\nThe men on the other side had begun to use ball-cartridge. I could see\nthrough a gap the centre of the river, and it was filled with a mass of\nstruggling men and horses.  I remember that it amazed me that no shot\nwas fired in return.  Then I remembered the vow, and was still more\namazed at the power of a ritual on that savage horde.\n\nThe column was moving past me to the right.  It was a disorderly rabble\nwhich obeyed Henriques' orders.  Bullets began to sing through the\ntrees, and one rider was hit in the shoulder and came down with a\ncrash.  This increased the confusion, for most of them dismounted and\ntried to lead their horses in the cover.  The infantry coming in from\nthe wings collided with them, and there was a struggle of excited\nbeasts and men in the thickets of thorn and mopani.  And still my\nKaffir was trying to get my ankles loose as fast as a plunging horse\nwould let him. At last I was free, and dropped stiffly to the ground.\nI fell prone on my face with cramp, and when I got up I rolled like a\ndrunk man.  Here I made a great blunder.  I should have left my horse\nwith my Kaffir, and bidden him follow me.  But I was too eager to be\ncautious, so I let it go, and crying to the Kaffir to await me, I ran\ntowards the litter.\n\nHenriques had laid his plans well.  The column had abandoned the\npriest, and by the litter were only the two bearers. As I caught sight\nof them one fell with a bullet in his chest. The other, wild with\nfright, kept turning his head to every quarter of the compass.  Another\nbullet passed close to his head.  This was too much for him, and with a\nyell he ran away.\n\nAs I broke through the thicket I looked to the quarter whence the\nbullets had come.  These, I could have taken my oath, were not fired by\nmy friends on the farther bank.  It was close-quarter shooting, and I\nknew who had done it.  But I saw nobody.  The last few yards of the\nroad were clear, and only out in the water was the struggling shouting\nmass of humanity. I saw a tall man on a big horse plunge into the river\non his way back.  It must be Laputa returning to command the panic.\n\nMy business was not with Laputa but with Henriques.  The old priest in\nthe litter, who had been sleeping, had roused himself, and was looking\nvacantly round him.  He did not look long.  A third bullet, fired from\na dozen yards away, drilled a hole in his forehead.  He fell back dead,\nand the ivory box, which lay on his lap, tilted forward on the ground.\n\nI had no weapon of any kind, and I did not want the fourth bullet for\nmyself.  Henriques was too pretty a shot to trifle with.  I waited\nquietly on the edge of the shade till the Portugoose came out of the\nthicket.  I saw him running forward with a rifle in his hand.  A whinny\nfrom a horse told me that somewhere near his beast was tied up.  It was\nall but dark, but it seemed to me that I could see the lust of greed in\nhis eyes as he rushed to the litter.\n\nVery softly I stole behind him.  He tore off the lid of the box, and\npulled out the great necklace.  For a second it hung in his hands, but\nonly for a second.  So absorbed was he that he did not notice me\nstanding full before him.  Nay, he lifted his head, and gave me the\nfinest chance of my life.  I was something of a boxer, and all my\naccumulated fury went into the blow.  It caught him on the point of the\nchin, and his neck cricked like the bolt of a rifle.  He fell limply on\nthe ground and the jewels dropped from his hand.\n\nI picked them up and stuffed them into my breeches pocket.\n\nThen I pulled the pistol out of his belt.  It was six-chambered, and I\nknew that only three had been emptied.  I remembered feeling\nextraordinarily cool and composed, and yet my wits must have been\nwandering or I would have never taken the course I did.\n\nThe right thing to do--on Arcoll's instructions--was to make for the\nriver and swim across to my friends.  But Laputa was coming back, and I\ndreaded meeting him.  Laputa seemed to my heated fancy omnipresent.  I\nthought of him as covering the whole bank of the river, whereas I might\neasily have crossed a little farther down, and made my way up the other\nbank to my friends.  It was plain that Laputa intended to evade the\npatrol, not to capture it, and there, consequently, I should be safe.\nThe next best thing was to find Arcoll's Kaffir, who was not twenty\nyards away, get some sort of horse, and break for the bush.  Long\nbefore morning we should have been over the Berg and in safety.  Nay,\nif I wanted a mount, there was Henriques' whinnying a few paces off.\n\nInstead I did the craziest thing of all.  With the jewels in one\npocket, and the Portugoose's pistol in the other, I started running\nback the road we had come.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV\n\nI CARRY THE COLLAR OF PRESTER JOHN\n\nI ran till my breath grew short, for some kind of swift motion I had to\nhave or choke.  The events of the last few minutes had inflamed my\nbrain.  For the first time in my life I had seen men die by\nviolence--nay, by brutal murder.  I had put my soul into the blow which\nlaid out Henriques, and I was still hot with the pride of it.  Also I\nhad in my pocket the fetich of the whole black world; I had taken their\nArk of the Covenant, and soon Laputa would be on my trail.  Fear,\npride, and a blind exultation all throbbed in my veins.  I must have\nrun three miles before I came to my sober senses.\n\nI put my ear to the ground, but heard no sound of pursuit. Laputa, I\nargued, would have enough to do for a little, shepherding his flock\nover the water.  He might surround and capture the patrol, or he might\nevade it; the vow prevented him from fighting it.  On the whole I was\nclear that he would ignore it and push on for the rendezvous.  All this\nwould take time, and the business of the priest would have to wait.\nWhen Henriques came to he would no doubt have a story to tell, and the\nscouts would be on my trail.  I wished I had shot the Portugoose while\nI was at the business.  It would have been no murder, but a righteous\nexecution.\n\nMeanwhile I must get off the road.  The sand had been disturbed by an\narmy, so there was little fear of my steps being traced.  Still it was\nonly wise to leave the track which I would be assumed to have taken,\nfor Laputa would guess I had fled back the way to\nBlaauwildebeestefontein.  I turned into the bush, which here was thin\nand sparse like whins on a common.\n\nThe Berg must be my goal.  Once on the plateau I would be inside the\nwhite man's lines.  Down here in the plains I was in the country of my\nenemies.  Arcoll meant to fight on the uplands when it came to\nfighting.  The black man might rage as he pleased in his own flats, but\nwe stood to defend the gates of the hills.  Therefore over the Berg I\nmust be before morning, or there would be a dead man with no tales to\ntell.\n\nI think that even at the start of that night's work I realized the\nexceeding precariousness of my chances.  Some twenty miles of bush and\nswamp separated me from the foot of the mountains.  After that there\nwas the climbing of them, for at the point opposite where I now stood\nthe Berg does not descend sharply on the plain, but is broken into\nfoot-hills around the glens of the Klein Letaba and the Letsitela.\nFrom the spot where these rivers emerge on the flats to the crown of\nthe plateau is ten miles at the shortest.  I had a start of an hour or\nso, but before dawn I had to traverse thirty miles of unknown and\ndifficult country.  Behind me would follow the best trackers in Africa,\nwho knew every foot of the wilderness. It was a wild hazard, but it was\nmy only hope.  At this time I was feeling pretty courageous.  For one\nthing I had Henriques' pistol close to my leg, and for another I still\nthrilled with the satisfaction of having smitten his face.\n\nI took the rubies, and stowed them below my shirt and next my skin.  I\nremember taking stock of my equipment and laughing at the humour of it.\nOne of the heels was almost twisted off my boots, and my shirt and\nbreeches were old at the best and ragged from hard usage.  The whole\noutfit would have been dear at five shillings, or seven-and-six with\nthe belt thrown in.  Then there was the Portugoose's pistol, costing,\nsay, a guinea; and last, the Prester's collar, worth several millions.\n\nWhat was more important than my clothing was my bodily strength.  I was\nstill very sore from the bonds and the jog of that accursed horse, but\nexercise was rapidly suppling my joints.  About five hours ago I had\neaten a filling, though not very sustaining, meal, and I thought I\ncould go on very well till morning.  But I was still badly in arrears\nwith my sleep, and there was no chance of my snatching a minute till I\nwas over the Berg.  It was going to be a race against time, and I swore\nthat I would drive my body to the last ounce of strength.\n\nMoonrise was still an hour or two away, and the sky was bright with\nmyriad stars.  I knew now what starlight meant, for there was ample\nlight to pick my way by.  I steered by the Southern Cross, for I was\naware that the Berg ran north and south, and with that constellation on\nmy left hand I was bound to reach it sooner or later.  The bush closed\naround me with its mysterious dull green shades, and trees, which in\nthe daytime were thin scrub, now loomed like tall timber.  It was very\neerie moving, a tiny fragment of mortality, in that great wide silent\nwilderness, with the starry vault, like an impassive celestial\naudience, watching with many eyes.  They cheered me, those stars.  In\nmy hurry and fear and passion they spoke of the old calm dignities of\nman.  I felt less alone when I turned my face to the lights which were\nslanting alike on this uncanny bush and on the homely streets of\nKirkcaple.\n\nThe silence did not last long.  First came the howl of a wolf, to be\nanswered by others from every quarter of the compass. This serenade\nwent on for a bit, till the jackals chimed in with their harsh bark.  I\nhad been caught by darkness before this when hunting on the Berg, but I\nwas not afraid of wild beasts. That is one terror of the bush which\ntravellers' tales have put too high.  It was true that I might meet a\nhungry lion, but the chance was remote, and I had my pistol.  Once\nindeed a huge animal bounded across the road a little in front of me.\nFor a moment I took him for a lion, but on reflection I was inclined to\nthink him a very large bush-pig.\n\nBy this time I was out of the thickest bush and into a piece of\nparkland with long, waving tambuki grass, which the Kaffirs would burn\nlater.  The moon was coming up, and her faint rays silvered the flat\ntops of the mimosa trees.  I could hear and feel around me the rustling\nof animals.  Once or twice a big buck--an eland or a koodoo--broke\ncover, and at the sight of me went off snorting down the slope.  Also\nthere were droves of smaller game--rhebok and springbok and\nduikers--which brushed past at full gallop without even noticing me.\n\nThe sight was so novel that it set me thinking.  That shy wild things\nshould stampede like this could only mean that they had been thoroughly\nscared.  Now obviously the thing that scared them must be on this side\nof the Letaba.  This must mean that Laputa's army, or a large part of\nit, had not crossed at Dupree's Drift, but had gone up the stream to\nsome higher ford.  If that was so, I must alter my course; so I bore\naway to the right for a mile or two, making a line due north-west.\n\nIn about an hour's time the ground descended steeply, and I saw before\nme the shining reaches of a river.  I had the chief features of the\ncountryside clear in my mind, both from old porings over maps, and from\nArcoll's instructions.  This stream must be the Little Letaba, and I\nmust cross it if I would get to the mountains.  I remembered that\nMajinje's kraal stood on its left bank, and higher up in its valley in\nthe Berg 'Mpefu lived. At all costs the kraals must be avoided.  Once\nacross it I must make for the Letsitela, another tributary of the Great\nLetaba, and by keeping the far bank of that stream I should cross the\nmountains to the place on the plateau of the Wood Bush which Arcoll had\ntold me would be his headquarters.\n\nIt is easy to talk about crossing a river, and looking to-day at the\nslender streak on the map I am amazed that so small a thing should have\ngiven me such ugly tremors.  Yet I have rarely faced a job I liked so\nlittle.  The stream ran yellow and sluggish under the clear moon.  On\nthe near side a thick growth of bush clothed the bank, but on the far\nside I made out a swamp with tall bulrushes.  The distance across was\nno more than fifty yards, but I would have swum a mile more readily in\ndeep water.  The place stank of crocodiles.  There was no ripple to\nbreak the oily flow except where a derelict branch swayed with the\ncurrent.  Something in the stillness, the eerie light on the water, and\nthe rotting smell of the swamp made that stream seem unhallowed and\ndeadly.\n\nI sat down and considered the matter.  Crocodiles had always terrified\nme more than any created thing, and to be dragged by iron jaws to death\nin that hideous stream seemed to me the most awful of endings.  Yet\ncross it I must if I were to get rid of my human enemies.  I remembered\na story of an escaped prisoner during the war who had only the Komati\nRiver between him and safety.  But he dared not enter it, and was\nrecaptured by a Boer commando.  I was determined that such cowardice\nshould not be laid to my charge.  If I was to die, I would at least\nhave given myself every chance of life. So I braced myself as best I\ncould, and looked for a place to enter.\n\nThe veld-craft I had mastered had taught me a few things. One was that\nwild animals drink at night, and that they have regular drinking\nplaces.  I thought that the likeliest place for crocodiles was at or\naround such spots, and, therefore, I resolved to take the water away\nfrom a drinking place.  I went up the bank, noting where the narrow\nbush-paths emerged on the water-side.  I scared away several little\nbuck, and once the violent commotion in the bush showed that I had\nfrightened some bigger animal, perhaps a hartebeest.  Still following\nthe bank I came to a reach where the undergrowth was unbroken and the\nwater looked deeper.\n\nSuddenly--I fear I must use this adverb often, for all the happenings\non that night were sudden--I saw a biggish animal break through the\nreeds on the far side.  It entered the water and, whether wading or\nswimming I could not see, came out a little distance.  Then some sense\nmust have told it of my presence, for it turned and with a grunt made\nits way back.\n\nI saw that it was a big wart-hog, and began to think.  Pig, unlike\nother beasts, drink not at night, but in the daytime. The hog had,\ntherefore, not come to drink, but to swim across. Now, I argued, he\nwould choose a safe place, for the wart-hog, hideous though he is, is a\nwise beast.  What was safe for him would, therefore, in all likelihood\nbe safe for me.\n\nWith this hope to comfort me I prepared to enter.  My first care was\nthe jewels, so, feeling them precarious in my shirt, I twined the\ncollar round my neck and clasped it.  The snake-clasp was no flimsy\ndevice of modern jewellery, and I had no fear but that it would hold.\nI held the pistol between my teeth, and with a prayer to God slipped\ninto the muddy waters.\n\nI swam in the wild way of a beginner who fears cramp.  The current was\nlight and the water moderately warm, but I seemed to go very slowly,\nand I was cold with apprehension.  In the middle it suddenly shallowed,\nand my breast came against a mudshoal.  I thought it was a crocodile,\nand in my confusion the pistol dropped from my mouth and disappeared.\n\nI waded a few steps and then plunged into deep water again. Almost\nbefore I knew, I was among the bulrushes, with my feet in the slime of\nthe bank.  With feverish haste I scrambled through the reeds and up\nthrough roots and undergrowth to the hard soil.  I was across, but,\nalas, I had lost my only weapon.\n\nThe swim and the anxiety had tired me considerably, and though it meant\ndelay, I did not dare to continue with the weight of water-logged\nclothes to impede me.  I found a dry sheltered place in the bush and\nstripped to the skin.  I emptied my boots and wrung out my shirt and\nbreeches, while the Prester's jewels were blazing on my neck.  Here was\na queer counterpart to Laputa in the cave!\n\nThe change revived me, and I continued my way in better form.  So far\nthere had been no sign of pursuit.  Before me the Letsitela was the\nonly other stream, and from what I remembered of its character near the\nBerg I thought I should have little trouble.  It was smaller than the\nKlein Letaba, and a rushing torrent where shallows must be common.\n\nI kept running till I felt my shirt getting dry on my back. Then I\nrestored the jewels to their old home, and found their cool touch on my\nbreast very comforting.  The country was getting more broken as I\nadvanced.  Little kopjes with thickets of wild bananas took the place\nof the dead levels.  Long before I reached the Letsitela, I saw that I\nwas right in my guess.  It ran, a brawling mountain stream, in a narrow\nrift in the bush. I crossed it almost dry-shod on the boulders above a\nlittle fall, stopping for a moment to drink and lave my brow.\n\nAfter that the country changed again.  The wood was now getting like\nthat which clothed the sides of the Berg.  There were tall\ntimber-trees--yellowwood, sneezewood, essenwood, stinkwood--and the\nground was carpeted with thick grass and ferns.  The sight gave me my\nfirst earnest of safety.  I was approaching my own country.  Behind me\nwas heathendom and the black fever flats.  In front were the cool\nmountains and bright streams, and the guns of my own folk.\n\nAs I struggled on--for I was getting very footsore and weary--I became\naware of an odd sound in my rear.  It was as if something were\nfollowing me.  I stopped and listened with a sudden dread.  Could\nLaputa's trackers have got up with me already?  But the sound was not\nof human feet.  It was as if some heavy animal were plunging through\nthe undergrowth. At intervals came the soft pad of its feet on the\ngrass.\n\nIt must be the hungry lion of my nightmare, and Henriques' pistol was\nin the mud of the Klein Letaba!  The only thing was a tree, and I had\nsprung for one and scrambled wearily into the first branches when a\ngreat yellow animal came into the moonlight.\n\nProvidence had done kindly in robbing me of my pistol.  The next minute\nI was on the ground with Colin leaping on me and baying with joy.  I\nhugged that blessed hound and buried my head in his shaggy neck,\nsobbing like a child.  How he had traced me I can never tell.  The\nsecret belongs only to the Maker of good and faithful dogs.\n\nWith him by my side I was a new man.  The awesome loneliness had gone.\nI felt as if he were a message from my own people to take me safely\nhome.  He clearly knew the business afoot, for he padded beside me with\nnever a glance to right or left.  Another time he would have been\nsnowking in every thicket; but now he was on duty, a serious,\nconscientious dog with no eye but for business.\n\nThe moon went down, and the starry sky was our only light. The thick\ngloom which brooded over the landscape pointed to the night being far\ngone.  I thought I saw a deeper blackness ahead which might be the line\nof the Berg.  Then came that period of utter stillness when every bush\nsound is hushed and the world seems to swoon.  I felt almost impious\nhurrying through that profound silence, when not even the leaves\nstirred or a frog croaked.\n\nSuddenly as we came over a rise a little wind blew on the back of my\nhead, and a bitter chill came into the air.  I knew from nights spent\nin the open that it was the precursor of dawn.  Sure enough, as I\nglanced back, far over the plain a pale glow was stealing upwards into\nthe sky.  In a few minutes the pall melted into an airy haze, and above\nme I saw the heavens shot with tremors of blue light.  Then the\nforeground began to clear, and there before me, with their heads still\nmuffled in vapour, were the mountains.\n\nXenophon's Ten Thousand did not hail the sea more gladly than I\nwelcomed those frowning ramparts of the Berg.\n\nOnce again my weariness was eased.  I cried to Colin, and together we\nran down into the wide, shallow trough which lies at the foot of the\nhills.  As the sun rose above the horizon, the black masses changed to\nemerald and rich umber, and the fleecy mists of the summits opened and\nrevealed beyond shining spaces of green.  Some lines of Shakespeare ran\nin my head, which I have always thought the most beautiful of all\npoetry:\n\n     'Night's candles are burned out, and jocund day\n     Walks tiptoe on the misty mountain tops.'\n\nUp there among the clouds was my salvation.  Like the Psalmist, I\nlifted my eyes to the hills from whence came my aid.\n\nHope is a wonderful restorative.  To be near the hills, to smell their\nodours, to see at the head of the glens the lines of the plateau where\nwere white men and civilization--all gave me new life and courage.\nColin saw my mood, and spared a moment now and then to inspect a hole\nor a covert.  Down in the shallow trough I saw the links of a burn, the\nMachudi, which flowed down the glen it was my purpose to ascend. Away\nto the north in the direction of Majinje's were patches of Kaffir\ntillage, and I thought I discerned the smoke from fires. Majinje's\nwomankind would be cooking their morning meal. To the south ran a thick\npatch of forest, but I saw beyond it the spur of the mountain over\nwhich runs the highroad to Wesselsburg.  The clear air of dawn was like\nwine in my blood. I was not free, but I was on the threshold of\nfreedom.  If I could only reach my friends with the Prester's collar in\nmy shirt, I would have performed a feat which would never be forgotten.\nI would have made history by my glorious folly. Breakfastless and\nfootsore, I was yet a proud man as I crossed the hollow to the mouth of\nMachudi's glen.\n\nMy chickens had been counted too soon, and there was to be no hatching.\nColin grew uneasy, and began to sniff up wind.  I was maybe a quarter\nof a mile from the glen foot, plodding through the long grass of the\nhollow, when the behaviour of the dog made me stop and listen.  In that\nstill air sounds carry far, and I seemed to hear the noise of feet\nbrushing through cover.  The noise came both from north and south, from\nthe forest and from the lower course of the Machudi.\n\nI dropped into shelter, and running with bent back got to the summit of\na little bush-clad knoll.  It was Colin who first caught sight of my\npursuers.  He was staring at a rift in the trees, and suddenly gave a\nshort bark.  I looked and saw two men, running hard, cross the grass\nand dip into the bed of the stream.  A moment later I had a glimpse of\nfigures on the edge of the forest, moving fast to the mouth of the\nglen.  The pursuit had not followed me; it had waited to cut me off.\nFool that I was, I had forgotten the wonders of Kaffir telegraphy.  It\nhad been easy for Laputa to send word thirty miles ahead to stop any\nwhite man who tried to cross the Berg.\n\nAnd then I knew that I was very weary.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV\n\nMORNING IN THE BERG\n\nI was perhaps half a mile the nearer to the glen, and was likely to get\nthere first.  And after that?  I could see the track winding by the\nwaterside and then crossing a hill-shoulder which diverted the stream.\nIt was a road a man could scarcely ride, and a tired man would have a\nhard job to climb.  I do not think that I had any hope.  My\nexhilaration had died as suddenly as it had been born.  I saw myself\ncaught and carried off to Laputa, who must now be close on the\nrendezvous at Inanda's Kraal.  I had no weapon to make a fight for it.\nMy foemen were many and untired.  It must be only a matter of minutes\ntill I was in their hands.\n\nMore in a dogged fury of disappointment than with any hope of escape I\nforced my sore legs up the glen.  Ten minutes ago I had been exulting\nin the glories of the morning, and now the sun was not less bright or\nthe colours less fair, but the heart had gone out of the spectator.  At\nfirst I managed to get some pace out of myself, partly from fear and\npartly from anger.  But I soon found that my body had been tried too\nfar. I could plod along, but to save my life I could not have hurried.\nAny healthy savage could have caught me in a hundred yards.\n\nThe track, I remember, was overhung with creepers, and often I had to\nsqueeze through thickets of tree-ferns.  Countless little brooks ran\ndown from the hillside, threads of silver among the green pastures.\nSoon I left the stream and climbed up on the shoulder, where the road\nwas not much better than a precipice.  Every step was a weariness.  I\ncould hardly drag one foot after the other, and my heart was beating\nlike the fanners of a mill, I had spasms of acute sickness, and it took\nall my resolution to keep me from lying down by the roadside.\n\nAt last I was at the top of the shoulder and could look back. There was\nno sign of anybody on the road so far as I could see.  Could I have\nescaped them?  I had been in the shadow of the trees for the first\npart, and they might have lost sight of me and concluded that I had\navoided the glen or tried one of the faces.  Before me, I remember,\nthere stretched the upper glen, a green cup-shaped hollow with the\nsides scarred by ravines. There was a high waterfall in one of them\nwhich was white as snow against the red rocks.  My wits must have been\nshaky, for I took the fall for a snowdrift, and wondered sillily why\nthe Berg had grown so Alpine.\n\nA faint spasm of hope took me into that green cup.  The bracken was as\nthick as on the Pentlands, and there was a multitude of small lovely\nflowers in the grass.  It was like a water-meadow at home, such a place\nas I had often in boyhood searched for moss-cheepers' and corncrakes'\neggs.  Birds were crying round me as I broke this solitude, and one\nsmall buck--a klipspringer--rose from my feet and dashed up one of the\ngullies.  Before me was a steep green wall with the sky blue above it.\nBeyond it was safety, but as my sweat-dimmed eyes looked at it I knew\nthat I could never reach it.\n\nThen I saw my pursuers.  High up on the left side, and rounding the rim\nof the cup, were little black figures.  They had not followed my trail,\nbut, certain of my purpose, had gone forward to intercept me.  I\nremember feeling a puny weakling compared with those lusty natives who\ncould make such good going on steep mountains.  They were certainly no\nmen of the plains, but hillmen, probably some remnants of old Machudi's\ntribe who still squatted in the glen.  Machudi was a blackguard chief\nwhom the Boers long ago smashed in one of their native wars.  He was a\nfierce old warrior and had put up a good fight to the last, till a\nhired impi of Swazis had surrounded his hiding-place in the forest and\ndestroyed him.  A Boer farmer on the plateau had his skull, and used to\ndrink whisky out of it when he was merry.\n\nThe sight of the pursuit was the last straw.  I gave up hope, and my\nintentions were narrowed to one frantic desire--to hide the jewels.\nPatriotism, which I had almost forgotten, flickered up in that crisis.\nAt any rate Laputa should not have the Snake.  If he drove out the\nwhite man, he should not clasp the Prester's rubies on his great neck.\n\nThere was no cover in the green cup, so I turned up the ravine on the\nright side.  The enemy, so far as I could judge, were on the left and\nin front, and in the gully I might find a pot-hole to bury the necklet\nin.  Only a desperate resolution took me through the tangle of juniper\nbushes into the red screes of the gully.  At first I could not find\nwhat I sought.  The stream in the ravine slid down a long slope like a\nmill-race, and the sides were bare and stony.  Still I plodded on,\nhelping myself with a hand on Colin's back, for my legs were numb with\nfatigue.  By-and-by the gully narrowed, and I came to a flat place with\na long pool.  Beyond was a little fall, and up this I climbed into a\nnetwork of tiny cascades.  Over one pool hung a dead tree-fern, and a\nbay from it ran into a hole of the rock. I slipped the jewels far into\nthe hole, where they lay on the firm sand, showing odd lights through\nthe dim blue water. Then I scrambled down again to the flat space and\nthe pool, and looked round to see if any one had reached the edge of\nthe ravine.  There was no sign as yet of the pursuit, so I dropped\nlimply on the shingle and waited.  For I had suddenly conceived a plan.\n\nAs my breath came back to me my wits came back from their wandering.\nThese men were not there to kill me, but to capture me.  They could\nknow nothing of the jewels, for Laputa would never have dared to make\nthe loss of the sacred Snake public.  Therefore they would not suspect\nwhat I had done, and would simply lead me to Laputa at Inanda's Kraal.\nI began to see the glimmerings of a plan for saving my life, and by\nGod's grace, for saving my country from the horrors of rebellion.  The\nmore I thought the better I liked it.  It demanded a bold front, and it\nmight well miscarry, but I had taken such desperate hazards during the\npast days that I was less afraid of fortune.  Anyhow, the choice lay\nbetween certain death and a slender chance of life, and it was easy to\ndecide.\n\nPlaying football, I used to notice how towards the end of a game I\nmight be sore and weary, without a kick in my body; but when I had a\nstraight job of tackling a man my strength miraculously returned.  It\nwas even so now.  I lay on my side, luxuriating in being still, and\nslowly a sort of vigour crept back into my limbs.  Perhaps a half-hour\nof rest was given me before, on the lip of the gully, I saw figures\nappear.  Looking down I saw several men who had come across from the\nopposite side of the valley, scrambling up the stream.  I got to my\nfeet, with Colin bristling beside me, and awaited them with the\nstiffest face I could muster.\n\nAs I expected, they were Machudi's men.  I recognized them by the red\nochre in their hair and their copper-wire necklets. Big fellows they\nwere, long-legged and deep in the chest, the true breed of\nmountaineers.  I admired their light tread on the slippery rock.  It\nwas hopeless to think of evading such men in their own hills.\n\nThe men from the side joined the men in front, and they stood looking\nat me from about twelve yards off.  They were armed only with\nknobkerries, and very clearly were no part of Laputa's army.  This made\ntheir errand plain to me.\n\n'Halt!' I said in Kaffir, as one of them made a hesitating step to\nadvance.  'Who are you and what do you seek?'\n\nThere was no answer, but they looked at me curiously. Then one made a\nmotion with his stick.  Colin gave a growl, and would have been on him\nif I had not kept a hand on his collar. The rash man drew back, and all\nstood stiff and perplexed.\n\n'Keep your hands by your side,' I said, 'or the dog, who has a devil,\nwill devour you.  One of you speak for the rest and tell me your\npurpose.'\n\nFor a moment I had a wild notion that they might be friends, some of\nArcoll's scouts, and out to help me.  But the first words shattered the\nfancy.\n\n'We are sent by Inkulu,' the biggest of them said.  'He bade us bring\nyou to him.'\n\n'And what if I refuse to go?'\n\n'Then, Baas, we must take you to him.  We are under the vow of the\nSnake.'\n\n'Vow of fiddlestick!' I cried.  'Who do you think is the bigger chief,\nthe Inkulu or Ratitswan?  I tell you Ratitswan is now driving Inkulu\nbefore him as a wind drives rotten leaves.  It will be well for you,\nmen of Machudi, to make peace with Ratitswan and take me to him on the\nBerg.  If you bring me to him, I and he will reward you; but if you do\nInkulu's bidding you will soon be hunted like buck out of your hills.'\n\nThey grinned at one another, but I could see that my words had no\neffect.  Laputa had done his business too well.\n\nThe spokesman shrugged his shoulders in the way the Kaffirs have. 'We\nwish you no ill, Baas, but we have been bidden to take you to Inkulu.\nWe cannot disobey the command of the Snake.'\n\nMy weakness was coming on me again, and I could talk no more.  I sat\ndown plump on the ground, almost falling into the pool.  'Take me to\nInkulu,' I stammered with a dry throat, 'I do not fear him;' and I\nrolled half-fainting on my back.\n\nThese clansmen of Machudi were decent fellows.  One of them had some\nKaffir beer in a calabash, which he gave me to drink.  The stuff was\nthin and sickly, but the fermentation in it did me good.  I had the\nsense to remember my need of sleep. 'The day is young,' I said, 'and I\nhave come far.  I ask to be allowed to sleep for an hour.'\n\nThe men made no difficulty, and with my head between Colin's paws I\nslipped into dreamless slumber.\n\nWhen they wakened me the sun was beginning to climb the sky, I judged\nit to be about eight o'clock.  They had made a little fire and roasted\nmealies.  Some of the food they gave me, and I ate it thankfully.  I\nwas feeling better, and I think a pipe would have almost completed my\ncure.\n\nBut when I stood up I found that I was worse than I had thought.  The\ntruth is, I was leg-weary, which you often see in horses, but rarely in\nmen.  What the proper explanation is I do not know, but the muscles\nsimply refuse to answer the direction of the will.  I found my legs\nsprawling like a child's who is learning to walk.\n\n'If you want me to go to the Inkulu, you must carry me,' I said, as I\ndropped once more on the ground.\n\nThe men nodded, and set to work to make a kind of litter out of their\nknobkerries and some old ropes they carried.  As they worked and\nchattered I looked idly at the left bank of the ravine--that is, the\nleft as you ascend it.  Some of Machudi's men had come down there, and,\nthough the place looked sheer and perilous, I saw how they had managed\nit.  I followed out bit by bit the track upwards, not with any thought\nof escape, but merely to keep my mind under control.  The right road\nwas from the foot of the pool up a long shelf to a clump of juniper.\nThen there was an easy chimney; then a piece of good hand-and-foot\nclimbing; and last, another ledge which led by an easy gradient to the\ntop.  I figured all this out as I have heard a condemned man will count\nthe windows of the houses on his way to the scaffold.\n\nPresently the litter was ready, and the men made signs to me to get\ninto it.  They carried me down the ravine and up the Machudi burn to\nthe green walls at its head.  I admired their bodily fitness, for they\nbore me up those steep slopes with never a halt, zigzagging in the\nproper style of mountain transport.  In less than an hour we had topped\nthe ridge, and the plateau was before me.\n\nIt looked very homelike and gracious, rolling in gentle undulations to\nthe western horizon, with clumps of wood in its hollows.  Far away I\nsaw smoke rising from what should be the village of the Iron Kranz.  It\nwas the country of my own people, and my captors behoved to go\ncautiously.  They were old hands at veld-craft, and it was wonderful\nthe way in which they kept out of sight even on the bare ridges.\nArcoll could have taught them nothing in the art of scouting.  At an\nincredible pace they hurried me along, now in a meadow by a stream\nside, now through a patch of forest, and now skirting a green shoulder\nof hill.\n\nOnce they clapped down suddenly, and crawled into the lee of some thick\nbracken.  Then very quietly they tied my hands and feet, and, not\nurgently, wound a dirty length of cotton over my mouth.  Colin was\nmeantime held tight and muzzled with a kind of bag strapped over his\nhead.  To get this over his snapping jaws took the whole strength of\nthe party.  I guessed that we were nearing the highroad which runs from\nthe plateau down the Great Letaba valley to the mining township of\nWesselsburg, away out on the plain.  The police patrols must be on this\nroad, and there was risk in crossing.  Sure enough I seemed to catch a\njingle of bridles as if from some company of men riding in haste.\n\nWe lay still for a little till the scouts came back and reported the\ncoast clear.  Then we made a dart for the road, crossed it, and got\ninto cover on the other side, where the ground sloped down to the\nLetaba glen.  I noticed in crossing that the dust of the highway was\nthick with the marks of shod horses.  I was very near and yet very far\nfrom my own people.\n\nOnce in the rocky gorge of the Letaba we advanced with less care.  We\nscrambled up a steep side gorge and came on to the small plateau from\nwhich the Cloud Mountains rise.  After that I was so tired that I\ndrowsed away, heedless of the bumping of the litter.  We went up and\nup, and when I next opened my eyes we had gone through a pass into a\nhollow of the hills. There was a flat space a mile or two square, and\nall round it stern black ramparts of rock.  This must be Inanda's\nKraal, a strong place if ever one existed, for a few men could defend\nall the approaches.  Considering that I had warned Arcoll of this\nrendezvous, I marvelled that no attempt had been made to hold the\nentrance.  The place was impregnable unless guns were brought up to the\nheights.  I remember thinking of a story I had heard--how in the war\nBeyers took his guns into the Wolkberg, and thereby saved them from our\ntroops.  Could Arcoll be meditating the same exploit?\n\nSuddenly I heard the sound of loud voices, and my litter was dropped\nroughly on the ground.  I woke to clear consciousness in the midst of\npandemonium.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI\n\nINANDA'S KRAAL\n\nThe vow was at an end.  In place of the silent army of yesterday a mob\nof maddened savages surged around me.  They were chanting a wild song,\nand brandishing spears and rifles to its accompaniment.  From their\nbloodshot eyes stared the lust of blood, the fury of conquest, and all\nthe aboriginal passions on which Laputa had laid his spell.  In my mind\nran a fragment from Laputa's prayer in the cave about the 'Terrible\nOnes.' Machudi's men--stout fellows, they held their ground as long as\nthey could--were swept out of the way, and the wave of black savagery\nseemed to close over my head.\n\nI thought my last moment had come.  Certainly it had but for Colin.\nThe bag had been taken from his head, and the fellow of Machudi's had\ndropped the rope round his collar.  In a red fury of wrath the dog\nleaped at my enemies.  Though every man of them was fully armed, they\nfell back, for I have noticed always that Kaffirs are mortally afraid\nof a white man's dog.  Colin had the sense to keep beside me.  Growling\nlike a thunderstorm he held the ring around my litter.\n\nThe breathing space would not have lasted long, but it gave me time to\nget to my feet.  My wrists and feet had been unbound long before, and\nthe rest had cured my leg-weariness. I stood up in that fierce circle\nwith the clear knowledge that my life hung by a hair.\n\n'Take me to Inkulu,' I cried.  'Dogs and fools, would you despise his\norders?  If one hair of my head is hurt, he will flay you alive.  Show\nme the way to him, and clear out of it.'\n\nI dare say there was a break in my voice, for I was dismally\nfrightened, but there must have been sufficient authority to get me a\nhearing.  Machudi's men closed up behind me, and repeated my words with\nflourishes and gestures.  But still the circle held.  No man came\nnearer me, but none moved so as to give me passage.\n\nThen I screwed up my courage, and did the only thing possible.  I\nwalked straight into the circle, knowing well that I was running no\nlight risk.  My courage, as I have already explained, is of little use\nunless I am doing something.  I could not endure another minute of\nsitting still with those fierce eyes on me.\n\nThe circle gave way.  Sullenly they made a road for me, closing up\nbehind on my guards, so that Machudi's men were swallowed in the mob,\nAlone I stalked forward with all that huge yelling crowd behind me.\n\nI had not far to go.  Inanda's Kraal was a cluster of kyas and\nrondavels, shaped in a half-moon, with a flat space between the houses,\nwhere grew a big merula tree.  All around was a medley of little fires,\nwith men squatted beside them. Here and there a party had finished\ntheir meal, and were swaggering about with a great shouting.  The mob\ninto which I had fallen was of this sort, and I saw others within the\nconfines of the camp.  But around the merula tree there was a gathering\nof chiefs, if I could judge by the comparative quiet and dignity of the\nmen, who sat in rows on the ground.  A few were standing, and among\nthem I caught sight of Laputa's tall figure.  I strode towards it,\nwondering if the chiefs would let me pass.\n\nThe hubbub of my volunteer attendants brought the eyes of the company\nround to me.  In a second it seemed every man was on his feet.  I could\nonly pray that Laputa would get to me before his friends had time to\nspear me.  I remember I fixed my eyes on a spur of hill beyond the\nkraal, and walked on with the best resolution I could find.  Already I\nfelt in my breast some of the long thin assegais of Umbooni's men.\n\nBut Laputa did not intend that I should be butchered.  A word from him\nbrought his company into order, and the next thing I knew I was facing\nhim, where he stood in front of the biggest kya, with Henriques beside\nhim, and some of the northern indunas.  Henriques looked ghastly in the\nclear morning light, and he had a linen rag bound round his head and\njaw, as if he suffered from toothache.  His face was more livid, his\neyes more bloodshot, and at the sight of me his hand went to his belt,\nand his teeth snapped.  But he held his peace, and it was Laputa who\nspoke.  He looked straight through me, and addressed Machudi's men.\n\n'You have brought back the prisoner.  That is well, and your service\nwill be remembered.  Go to 'Mpefu's camp on the hill there, and you\nwill be given food.'\n\nThe men departed, and with them fell away the crowd which had followed\nme.  I was left, very giddy and dazed, to confront Laputa and his\nchiefs.  The whole scene was swimming before my eyes.  I remember there\nwas a clucking of hens from somewhere behind the kraal, which called up\nridiculous memories.  I was trying to remember the plan I had made in\nMachudi's glen.  I kept saying to myself like a parrot: 'The army\ncannot know about the jewels.  Laputa must keep his loss secret.  I can\nget my life from him if I offer to give them back.' It had sounded a\ngood scheme three hours before, but with the man's hard face before me,\nit seemed a frail peg to hang my fate on.\n\nLaputa's eye fell on me, a clear searching eye with a question in it.\n\nThere was something he was trying to say to me which he dared not put\ninto words.  I guessed what the something was, for I saw his glance run\nover my shirt and my empty pockets.\n\n'You have made little of your treachery,' he said.  'Fool, did you\nthink to escape me?  I could bring you back from the ends of the earth.'\n\n'There was no treachery,' I replied.  'Do you blame a prisoner for\ntrying to escape?  When shooting began I found myself free, and I took\nthe road for home.  Ask Machudi's men and they will tell you that I\ncame quietly with them, when I saw that the game was up.'\n\nHe shrugged his shoulders.  'It matters very little what you did.  You\nare here now.--  Tie him up and put him in my kya,' he said to the\nbodyguard.  'I have something to say to him before he dies.'\n\nAs the men laid hands on me, I saw the exultant grin on Henriques'\nface.  It was more than I could endure.\n\n'Stop,' I said.  'You talk of traitors, Mr Laputa.  There is the\nbiggest and blackest at your elbow.  That man sent word to Arcoll about\nyour crossing at Dupree's Drift.  At our outspan at noon yesterday he\ncame to me and offered me my liberty if I would help him.  He told me\nhe was a spy, and I flung his offer in his face.  It was he who shot\nthe Keeper by the river side, and would have stolen the Snake if I had\nnot broken his head.  You call me a traitor, and you let that thing\nlive, though he has killed your priest and betrayed your plans.  Kill\nme if you like, but by God let him die first.'\n\nI do not know how the others took the revelation, for my eyes were only\nfor the Portugoose.  He made a step towards me, his hands twitching by\nhis sides.\n\n'You lie,' he screamed in that queer broken voice which much fever\ngives.  'It was this English hound that killed the Keeper, and felled\nme when I tried to save him.  The man who insults my honour is dead.'\nAnd he plucked from his belt a pistol.\n\nA good shot does not miss at two yards.  I was never nearer my end than\nin that fraction of time while the weapon came up to the aim.  It was\nscarcely a second, but it was enough for Colin.  The dog had kept my\nside, and had stood docilely by me while Laputa spoke.  The truth is,\nhe must have been as tired as I was.  As the Kaffirs approached to lay\nhands on me he had growled menacingly, but when I spoke again he had\nstopped.  Henriques' voice had convinced him of a more urgent danger,\nand so soon as the trigger hand of the Portugoose rose, the dog sprang.\nThe bullet went wide, and the next moment dog and man were struggling\non the ground.\n\nA dozen hands held me from going to Colin's aid, but oddly enough no\none stepped forward to help Henriques.  The ruffian kept his head, and\nthough the dog's teeth were in his shoulder, he managed to get his\nright hand free.  I saw what would happen, and yelled madly in my\napprehension.  The yellow wrist curved, and the pistol barrel was\npressed below the dog's shoulder.  Thrice he fired, the grip relaxed,\nand Colin rolled over limply, fragments of shirt still hanging from his\njaw.  The Portugoose rose slowly with his hand to his head, and a thin\nstream of blood dripping from his shoulder. As I saw the faithful eyes\nglazing in death, and knew that I had lost the best of all comrades, I\nwent clean berserk mad. The cluster of men round me, who had been\nstaring open-eyed at the fight, were swept aside like reeds.  I went\nstraight for the Portugoose, determined that, pistol or no pistol, I\nwould serve him as he had served my dog.\n\nFor my years I was a well-set-up lad, long in the arms and deep in the\nchest.  But I had not yet come to my full strength, and in any case I\ncould not hope to fight the whole of Laputa's army.  I was flung back\nand forwards like a shuttlecock.  They played some kind of game with\nme, and I could hear the idiotic Kaffir laughter.  It was blind man's\nbuff, so far as I was concerned, for I was blind with fury.  I struck\nout wildly left and right, beating the air often, but sometimes getting\nin a solid blow on hard black flesh.  I was soundly beaten myself,\npricked with spears, and made to caper for savage sport. Suddenly I saw\nLaputa before me, and hurled myself madly at his chest.  Some one gave\nme a clout on the head, and my senses fled.\n\n\nWhen I came to myself, I was lying on a heap of mealie-stalks in a dark\nroom.  I had a desperate headache, and a horrid nausea, which made me\nfall back as soon as I tried to raise myself. A voice came out of the\ndarkness as I stirred--a voice speaking English.\n\n'Are you awake, Mr Storekeeper?'\n\nThe voice was Laputa's, but I could not see him.  The room was pitch\ndark, except for a long ray of sunlight on the floor.\n\n'I'm awake,' I said.  'What do you want with me?'\n\nSome one stepped out of the gloom and sat down near me. A naked black\nfoot broke the belt of light on the floor.\n\n'For God's sake get me a drink,' I murmured. The figure rose and\nfetched a pannikin of water from a pail. I could hear the cool trickle\nof the drops on the metal.  A hand put the dish to my mouth, and I\ndrank water with a strong dash of spirits.  This brought back my\nnausea, and I collapsed on the mealie-stalks till the fit passed. Again\nthe voice spoke, this time from close at hand.\n\n'You are paying the penalty of being a fool, Mr Storekeeper. You are\nyoung to die, but folly is common in youth.  In an hour you will regret\nthat you did not listen to my advice at Umvelos'.'\n\nI clawed at my wits and strove to realize what he was saying. He spoke\nof death within an hour.  If it only came sharp and sudden, I did not\nmind greatly.  The plan I had made had slipped utterly out of my mind.\nMy body was so wretched, that I asked only for rest.  I was very\nlighthearted and foolish at that moment.\n\n'Kill me if you like,' I whispered.  'Some day you will pay dearly for\nit all.  But for God's sake go away and leave me alone.'\n\nLaputa laughed.  It was a horrid sound in the darkness.\n\n'You are brave, Mr Storekeeper, but I have seen a brave man's courage\nebb very fast when he saw the death which I have arranged for you.\nWould you like to hear something of it by way of preparation?'\n\nIn a low gentle voice he began to tell me mysteries of awful cruelty.\nAt first I scarcely heard him, but as he went on my brain seemed to\nwake from its lethargy.  I listened with freezing blood.  Not in my\nwildest nightmares had I imagined such a fate.  Then in despite of\nmyself a cry broke from me.\n\n'It interests you?' Laputa asked.  'I could tell you more, but\nsomething must be left to the fancy.  Yours should be an active one,'\nand his hand gripped my shaking wrist and felt my pulse.\n\n'Henriques will see that the truth does not fall short of my forecast,'\nhe went on.  'For I have appointed Henriques your executioner.'\n\nThe name brought my senses back to me.\n\n'Kill me,' I said, 'but for God's sake kill Henriques too.  If you did\njustice you would let me go and roast the Portugoose alive.  But for me\nthe Snake would be over the Lebombo by this time in Henriques' pocket.'\n\n'But it is not, my friend.  It was stolen by a storekeeper, who will\nshortly be wishing he had died in his mother's womb.'\n\nMy plan was slowly coming back to me.\n\n'If you value Prester John's collar, you will save my life. What will\nyour rising be without the Snake?  Would they follow you a yard if they\nsuspected you had lost it?'\n\n'So you would threaten me,' Laputa said very gently.  Then in a burst\nof wrath he shouted, 'They will follow me to hell for my own sake.\nImbecile, do you think my power is built on a trinket?  When you are in\nyour grave, I will be ruling a hundred millions from the proudest\nthrone on earth.'\n\nHe sprang to his feet, and pulled back a shutter of the window, letting\na flood of light into the hut.  In that light I saw that he had in his\nhands the ivory box which had contained the collar.\n\n'I will carry the casket through the wars,' he cried, 'and if I choose\nnever to open it, who will gainsay me?  You besotted fool, to think\nthat any theft of yours could hinder my destiny!' He was the blustering\nsavage again, and I preferred him in the part.  All that he said might\nbe true, but I thought I could detect in his voice a keen regret, and\nin his air a touch of disquiet.  The man was a fanatic, and like all\nfanatics had his superstitions.\n\n'Yes,' I said, 'but when you mount the throne you speak of, it would be\na pity not to have the rubies on your neck after all your talk in the\ncave.'\n\nI thought he would have throttled me.  He glowered down at me with\nmurder in his eyes.  Then he dashed the casket on the floor with such\nviolence that it broke into fragments.\n\n'Give me back the _Ndhlondhlo_,' he cried, like a petted child. 'Give me\nback the collar of John.'\n\nThis was the moment I had been waiting for.\n\n'Now see here, Mr Laputa,' I said.  'I am going to talk business.\nBefore you started this rising, you were a civilized man with a good\neducation.  Well, just remember that education for a minute, and look\nat the matter in a sensible light. I'm not like the Portugoose.  I\ndon't want to steal your rubies. I swear to God that what I have told\nyou is true.  Henriques killed the priest, and would have bagged the\njewels if I had not laid him out.  I ran away because I was going to be\nkilled to-day, and I took the collar to keep it out of Henriques'\nhands.  I tell you I would never have shot the old man myself.  Very\nwell, what happened?  Your men overtook me, and I had no choice but to\nsurrender.  Before they reached me, I hid the collar in a place I know\nof.  Now, I am going to make you a fair and square business\nproposition.  You may be able to get on without the Snake, but I can\nsee you want it back.  I am in a tight place and want nothing so much\nas my life.  I offer to trade with you.  Give me my life, and I will\ntake you to the place and put the jewels in your hand.  Otherwise you\nmay kill me, but you will never see the collar of John again.'\n\nI still think that was a pretty bold speech for a man to make in a\npredicament like mine.  But it had its effect.  Laputa ceased to be the\nbarbarian king, and talked like a civilized man.\n\n'That is, as you call it, a business proposition.  But supposing I\nrefuse it?  Supposing I take measures here--in this kraal--to make you\nspeak, and then send for the jewels.'\n\n'There are several objections,' I said, quite cheerfully, for I felt\nthat I was gaining ground.  'One is that I could not explain to any\nmortal soul how to find the collar.  I know where it is, but I could\nnot impart the knowledge.  Another is that the country between here and\nMachudi's is not very healthy for your people.  Arcoll's men are all\nover it, and you cannot have a collection of search parties rummaging\nabout in the glen for long.  Last and most important, if you send any\none for the jewels, you confess their loss.  No, Mr Laputa, if you want\nthem back, you must go yourself and take me with you.'\n\nHe stood silent for a little, with his brows knit in thought. Then he\nopened the door and went out.  I guessed that he had gone to discover\nfrom his scouts the state of the country between Inanda's Kraal and\nMachudi's glen.  Hope had come back to me, and I sat among the\nmealie-stalks trying to plan the future.  If he made a bargain I\nbelieved he would keep it. Once set free at the head of Machudi's, I\nshould be within an hour or two of Arcoll's posts.  So far, I had done\nnothing for the cause.  My message had been made useless by Henriques'\ntreachery, and I had stolen the Snake only to restore it.  But if I got\noff with my life, there would be work for me to do in the Armageddon\nwhich I saw approaching.  Should I escape, I wondered.  What would\nhinder Laputa from setting his men to follow me, and seize me before I\ncould get into safety?  My only chance was that Arcoll might have been\nbusy this day, and the countryside too full of his men to let Laputa's\nKaffirs through.  But if this was so, Laputa and I should be stopped,\nand then Laputa would certainly kill me.  I wished--and yet I did not\nwish--that Arcoll should hold all approaches.  As I reflected, my first\nexhilaration died away.  The scales were still heavily weighted against\nme.\n\nLaputa returned, closing the door behind him.\n\n'I will bargain with you on my own terms.  You shall have your life,\nand in return you will take me to the place where you hid the collar,\nand put it into my hands.  I will ride there, and you will run beside\nme, tied to my saddle.  If we are in danger from the white men, I will\nshoot you dead.  Do you accept?'\n\n'Yes,' I said, scrambling to my feet, and ruefully testing my shaky\nlegs.  'But if you want me to get to Machudi's you must go slowly, for\nI am nearly foundered.'\n\nThen he brought out a Bible, and made me swear on it that I would do as\nI promised.\n\n'Swear to me in turn,' I said, 'that you will give me my life if I\nrestore the jewels.'\n\nHe swore, kissing the book like a witness in a police-court.  I had\nforgotten that the man called himself a Christian.\n\n'One thing more I ask,' I said.  'I want my dog decently buried.' 'That\nhas been already done,' was the reply.  'He was a brave animal, and my\npeople honour bravery.'\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII\n\nA DEAL AND ITS CONSEQUENCES\n\nMy eyes were bandaged tight, and a thong was run round my right wrist\nand tied to Laputa's saddle-bow.  I felt the glare of the afternoon sun\non my head, and my shins were continually barked by stones and trees;\nbut these were my only tidings of the outer world.  By the sound of his\npaces Laputa was riding the _schimmel_, and if any one thinks it easy to\ngo blindfold by a horse's side I hope he will soon have the experience.\nIn the darkness I could not tell the speed of the beast.  When I ran I\novershot it and was tugged back; when I walked my wrist was dislocated\nwith the tugs forward.\n\nFor an hour or more I suffered this breakneck treatment. We were\ndescending.  Often I could hear the noise of falling streams, and once\nwe splashed through a mountain ford. Laputa was taking no risks, for he\nclearly had in mind the possibility of some accident which would set me\nfree, and he had no desire to have me guiding Arcoll to his camp.\n\nBut as I stumbled and sprawled down these rocky tracks I was not\nthinking of Laputa's plans.  My whole soul was filled with regret for\nColin, and rage against his murderer.  After my first mad rush I had\nnot thought about my dog.  He was dead, but so would I be in an hour or\ntwo, and there was no cause to lament him.  But at the first revival of\nhope my grief had returned.  As they bandaged my eyes I was wishing\nthat they would let me see his grave.  As I followed beside Laputa I\ntold myself that if ever I got free, when the war was over I would go\nto Inanda's Kraal, find the grave, and put a tombstone over it in\nmemory of the dog that saved my life.  I would also write that the man\nwho shot him was killed on such and such a day at such and such a place\nby Colin's master.  I wondered why Laputa had not the wits to see the\nPortugoose's treachery and to let me fight him.  I did not care what\nwere the weapons--knives or guns, or naked fists--I would certainly\nkill him, and afterwards the Kaffirs could do as they pleased with me.\nHot tears of rage and weakness wet the bandage on my eyes, and the sobs\nwhich came from me were not only those of weariness.\n\nAt last we halted.  Laputa got down and took off the bandage, and I\nfound myself in one of the hill-meadows which lie among the foothills\nof the Wolkberg.  The glare blinded me, and for a little I could only\nsee the marigolds growing at my feet.  Then I had a glimpse of the deep\ngorge of the Great Letaba below me, and far to the east the flats\nrunning out to the hazy blue line of the Lebombo hills.  Laputa let me\nsit on the ground for a minute or two to get my breath and rest my\nfeet.  'That was a rough road,' he said.  'You can take it easier now,\nfor I have no wish to carry you.'  He patted the _schimmel_, and the\nbeautiful creature turned his mild eyes on the pair of us.  I wondered\nif he recognized his rider of two nights ago.\n\nI had seen Laputa as the Christian minister, as the priest and king in\nthe cave, as the leader of an army at Dupree's Drift, and at the kraal\nwe had left as the savage with all self-control flung to the winds.  I\nwas to see this amazing man in a further part.  For he now became a\nfriendly and rational companion.  He kept his horse at an easy walk,\nand talked to me as if we were two friends out for a trip together.\nPerhaps he had talked thus to Arcoll, the half-caste who drove his\nCape-cart.\n\nThe wooded bluff above Machudi's glen showed far in front.  He told me\nthe story of the Machudi war, which I knew already, but he told it as a\nsaga.  There had been a stratagem by which one of the Boer leaders--a\nGrobelaar, I think--got some of his men into the enemy's camp by hiding\nthem in a captured forage wagon.\n\n'Like the Trojan horse,' I said involuntarily.\n\n'Yes,' said my companion, 'the same old device,' and to my amazement he\nquoted some lines of Virgil.\n\n'Do you understand Latin?' he asked.\n\nI told him that I had some slight knowledge of the tongue, acquired at\nthe university of Edinburgh.  Laputa nodded.  He mentioned the name of\na professor there, and commented on his scholarship.\n\n'O man!' I cried, 'what in God's name are you doing in this business?\nYou that are educated and have seen the world, what makes you try to\nput the clock back?  You want to wipe out the civilization of a\nthousand years, and turn us all into savages. It's the more shame to\nyou when you know better.'\n\n'You misunderstand me,' he said quietly.  'It is because I have sucked\ncivilization dry that I know the bitterness of the fruit.  I want a\nsimpler and better world, and I want that world for my own people.  I\nam a Christian, and will you tell me that your civilization pays much\nattention to Christ?  You call yourself a patriot?  Will you not give\nme leave to be a patriot in turn?'\n\n'If you are a Christian, what sort of Christianity is it to deluge the\nland with blood?'\n\n'The best,' he said.  'The house must be swept and garnished before the\nman of the house can dwell in it.  You have read history. Such a\npurging has descended on the Church at many times, and the world has\nawakened to a new hope.  It is the same in all religions.  The temples\ngrow tawdry and foul and must be cleansed, and, let me remind you, the\ncleanser has always come out of the desert.'\n\nI had no answer, being too weak and forlorn to think.  But I fastened\non his patriotic plea.\n\n'Where are the patriots in your following?  They are all red Kaffirs\ncrying for blood and plunder.  Supposing you were Oliver Cromwell you\ncould make nothing out of such a crew.'\n\n'They are my people,' he said simply.\n\nBy this time we had forded the Great Letaba, and were making our way\nthrough the clumps of forest to the crown of the plateau.  I noticed\nthat Laputa kept well in cover, preferring the tangle of wooded\nundergrowth to the open spaces of the water-meadows.  As he talked, his\nwary eyes were keeping a sharp look-out over the landscape.  I thrilled\nwith the thought that my own folk were near at hand.\n\nOnce Laputa checked me with his hand as I was going to speak, and in\nsilence we crossed the kloof of a little stream. After that we struck a\nlong strip of forest and he slackened his watch.\n\n'If you fight for a great cause,' I said, 'why do you let a miscreant\nlike Henriques have a hand in it?  You must know that the man's only\ninterest in you is the chance of loot.  I am for you against Henriques,\nand I tell you plain that if you don't break the snake's back it will\nsting you.'\n\nLaputa looked at me with an odd, meditative look.\n\n'You misunderstand again, Mr Storekeeper.  The Portuguese is what you\ncall a \"mean white.\" His only safety is among us.  I am campaigner\nenough to know that an enemy, who has a burning grievance against my\nother enemies, is a good ally. You are too hard on Henriques.  You and\nyour friends have treated him as a Kaffir, and a Kaffir he is in\neverything but Kaffir virtues.  What makes you so anxious that\nHenriques should not betray me?'\n\n'I'm not a mean white,' I said, 'and I will speak the truth.  I hope,\nin God's name, to see you smashed; but I want it done by honest men,\nand not by a yellow devil who has murdered my dog and my friends.\nSooner or later you will find him out; and if he escapes you, and\nthere's any justice in heaven, he won't escape me.'\n\n'Brave words,' said Laputa, with a laugh, and then in one second he\nbecame rigid in the saddle.  We had crossed a patch of meadow and\nentered a wood, beyond which ran the highway. I fancy he was out in his\nreckoning, and did not think the road so near.  At any rate, after a\nmoment he caught the sound of horses, and I caught it too.  The wood\nwas thin, and there was no room for retreat, while to recross the\nmeadow would bring us clean into the open.  He jumped from his horse,\nuntied with amazing quickness the rope halter from its neck, and\nstarted to gag me by winding the thing round my jaw.\n\nI had no time to protest that I would keep faith, and my right hand was\ntethered to his pommel.  In the grip of these great arms I was\nhelpless, and in a trice was standing dumb as a lamp-post; while\nLaputa, his left arm round both of mine, and his right hand over the\n_schimmel_'s eyes, strained his ears like a sable antelope who has\nscented danger.\n\nThere was never a more brutal gagging.  The rope crushed my nose and\ndrove my lips down on my teeth, besides gripping my throat so that I\ncould scarcely breathe.  The pain was so great that I became sick, and\nwould have fallen but for Laputa. Happily I managed to get my teeth\napart, so that one coil slipped between, and eased the pain of the\njaws.  But the rest was bad enough to make me bite frantically on the\ntow, and I think in a little my sharp front teeth would have severed\nit.  All this discomfort prevented me seeing what happened.  The wood,\nas I have said, was thin, and through the screen of leaves I had a\nconfused impression of men and horses passing interminably.  There can\nonly have been a score at the most; but the moments drag if a cord is\ngripping your throat.  When Laputa at length untied me, I had another\nfit of nausea, and leaned helplessly against a tree.\n\nLaputa listened till the sound of the horses had died away; then\nsilently we stole to the edge of the road, across, and into the thicker\nevergreen bush on the far side.  At a pace which forced me to run hard,\nwe climbed a steepish slope, till ahead of us we saw the bald green\ncrown of the meadowlands.  I noticed that his face had grown dark and\nsullen again.  He was in an enemy's country, and had the air of the\nhunted instead of the hunter.  When I stopped he glowered at me, and\nonce, when I was all but overcome with fatigue, he lifted his hand in a\nthreat.  Had he carried a sjambok, it would have fallen on my back.\n\nIf he was nervous, so was I.  The fact that I was out of the Kaffir\ncountry and in the land of my own folk was a kind of qualified liberty.\nAt any moment, I felt, Providence might intervene to set me free.  It\nwas in the bond that Laputa should shoot me if we were attacked; but a\npistol might miss.  As far as my shaken wits would let me, I began to\nforecast the future. Once he got the jewels my side of the bargain was\ncomplete. He had promised me my life, but there had been nothing said\nabout my liberty; and I felt assured that Laputa would never allow one\nwho had seen so much to get off to Arcoll with his tidings.  But back\nto that unhallowed kraal I was resolved I would not go.  He was armed,\nand I was helpless; he was strong, and I was dizzy with weakness; he\nwas mounted, and I was on foot: it seemed a poor hope that I should get\naway. There was little chance from a wandering patrol, for I knew if we\nwere followed I should have a bullet in my head, while Laputa got off\non the _schimmel_.  I must wait and bide events. At the worst, a clean\nshot on the hillside in a race for life was better than the unknown\nmysteries of the kraal.  I prayed earnestly to God to show me His\nmercy, for if ever man was sore bested by the heathen it was I.\n\nTo my surprise, Laputa chose to show himself on the green\nhill-shoulder.  He looked towards the Wolkberg and raised his hands.\nIt must have been some signal.  I cast my eyes back on the road we had\ncome, and I thought I saw some figures a mile back, on the edge of the\nLetaba gorge.  He was making sure of my return.\n\nBy this time it was about four in the afternoon, and as heavenly\nweather as the heart of man could wish.  The meadows were full of\naromatic herbs, which, as we crushed them, sent up a delicate odour.\nThe little pools and shallows of the burns were as clear as a Lothian\ntrout-stream.  We were now going at a good pace, and I found that my\nearlier weariness was growing less.  I was being keyed up for some\ngreat crisis, for in my case the spirit acts direct on the body, and\nfatigue grows and ebbs with hope.  I knew that my strength was not far\nfrom breaking-point; but I knew also that so long as a chance was left\nme I should have enough for a stroke.\n\nBefore I realized where we were we had rounded the hill, and were\nlooking down on the green cup of the upper Machudi's glen.  Far down, I\nremember, where the trees began, there was a cloud of smoke.  Some\nKaffir--or maybe Arcoll--had fired the forest.  The smoke was drifting\naway under a light west wind over the far plains, so that they were\nseen through a haze of opal.\n\nLaputa bade me take the lead.  I saw quite clear the red kloof on the\nfar side, where the collar was hid.  To get there we might have ridden\nstraight into the cup, but a providential instinct made me circle round\nthe top till we were on the lip of the ravine.  This was the road some\nof Machudi's men had taken, and unthinkingly I followed them.  Twenty\nminutes' riding brought us to the place, and all the while I had no\nkind of plan of escape.  I was in the hands of my Maker, watching, like\nthe Jews of old, for a sign.\n\nLaputa dismounted and looked down into the gorge.\n\n'There is no road there,' I said.  'We must go down to the foot and\ncome up the stream-side.  It would be better to leave your horse here.'\nHe started down the cliff, which from above looks a sheer precipice.\nThen he seemed to agree with me, took the rope from the _schimmel_'s\nneck, and knee-haltered his beast.  And at that moment I had an\ninspiration.\n\nWith my wrist-rope in his hand, he preceded me down the hill till we\ngot to the red screes at the foot of the kloof.  Then, under my\nguidance, we turned up into the darkness of the gorge.  As we entered I\nlooked back, and saw figures coming over the edge of the green\ncup--Laputa's men, I guessed. What I had to do must be done quickly.\n\nWe climbed up the burn, over the succession of little cataracts, till\nwe came to the flat space of shingle and the long pool where I had been\ntaken that morning.  The ashes of the fire which Machudi's men had made\nwere plain on the rock. After that I had to climb a waterfall to get to\nthe rocky pool where I had bestowed the rubies.\n\n'You must take off this thong,' I said.  'I must climb to get the\ncollar.  Cover me with a pistol if you like.  I won't be out of sight.'\n\nLaputa undid the thong and set me free.  From his belt he took a\npistol, cocked it, and held it over his left hand.  I had seen this way\nof shooting adopted by indifferent shots, and it gave me a wild hope\nthat he might not be much of a marksman.\n\nIt did not take me long to find the pool, close against the blackened\nstump of a tree-fern.  I thrust in my hand and gathered up the jewels\nfrom the cool sand.  They came out glowing like living fires, and for a\nmoment I thrilled with a sense of reverence.  Surely these were no\ncommon stones which held in them the very heart of hell.  Clutching\nthem tightly, I climbed down to Laputa.\n\nAt the sight of the great Snake he gave a cry of rapture. Tearing it\nfrom me, he held it at arm's length, his face lit with a passionate\njoy.  He kissed it, he raised it to the sky; nay, he was on his knees\nbefore it.  Once more he was the savage transported in the presence of\nhis fetich.  He turned to me with burning eyes.\n\n'Down on your knees,' he cried, 'and reverence the _Ndhlondhlo_. Down,\nyou impious dog, and seek pardon for your sacrilege.'\n\n'I won't,' I said.  'I won't bow to any heathen idol.'\n\nHe pointed his pistol at me.\n\n'In a second I shoot where your head is now.  Down, you fool, or\nperish.'\n\n'You promised me my life,' I said stubbornly, though Heaven knows why I\nchose to act thus.\n\nHe dropped the pistol and flung himself on me.  I was helpless as a\nbaby in his hands.  He forced me to the ground and rolled my face in\nthe sand; then he pulled me to my feet and tossed me backward, till I\nalmost staggered into the pool. I saved myself, and staggered instead\ninto the shallow at the foot of it, close under the ledge of the\nprecipice.\n\nThat morning, when Machudi's men were cooking breakfast, I had figured\nout a route up the cliff.  This route was now my hope of escape.\nLaputa had dropped his pistol, and the collar had plunged him in an\necstasy of worship.  Now, if ever, was my time.  I must get on the\nshelf which ran sideways up the cliff, and then scramble for dear life.\n\nI pretended to be dazed and terrified.\n\n'You promised me my life,' I whimpered.\n\n'Your life,' he cried.  'Yes, you shall have your life; and before long\nyou will pray for death.'\n\n'But I saved the Collar,' I pleaded.  'Henriques would have stolen it.\nI brought it safe here, and now you have got it.'\n\nMeantime I was pulling myself up on the shelf, and loosening with one\nhand a boulder which overhung the pool.\n\n'You have been repaid,' he said savagely.  'You will not die.'\n\n'But my life is no use without liberty,' I said, working at the boulder\ntill it lay loose in its niche.\n\nHe did not answer, being intent on examining the Collar to see if it\nhad suffered any harm.\n\n'I hope it isn't scratched,' I said.  'Henriques trod on it when I hit\nhim.'\n\nLaputa peered at the gems like a mother at a child who has had a fall.\nI saw my chance and took it.  With a great heave I pulled the boulder\ndown into the pool.  It made a prodigious splash, sending a shower of\nspray over Laputa and the Collar. In cover of it I raced up the shelf,\nstraining for the shelter of the juniper tree.\n\nA shot rang out and struck the rock above me.  A second later I had\nreached the tree and was scrambling up the crack beyond it.\n\nLaputa did not fire again.  He may have distrusted his shooting, or\nseen a better way of it.  He dashed through the stream and ran up the\nshelf like a klipspringer after me.  I felt rather than saw what was\nhappening, and with my heart in my mouth I gathered my dregs of energy\nfor the last struggle.\n\nYou know the nightmare when you are pursued by some awful terror, and,\nthough sick with fear, your legs have a strange numbness, and you\ncannot drag them in obedience to the will.  Such was my feeling in the\ncrack above the juniper tree.  In truth, I had passed the bounds of my\nendurance.  Last night I had walked fifty miles, and all day I had\nborne the torments of a dreadful suspense.  I had been bound and gagged\nand beaten till the force was out of my limbs.  Also, and above all, I\nhad had little food, and I was dizzy with want of sleep. My feet seemed\nleaden, my hands had no more grip than putty.  I do not know how I\nescaped falling into the pool, for my head was singing and my heart\nthumping in my throat.  I seemed to feel Laputa's great hand every\nsecond clawing at my heels.\n\nI had reason for my fears.  He had entered the crack long before I had\nreached the top, and his progress was twice as fast as mine.  When I\nemerged on the topmost shelf he was scarcely a yard behind me.  But an\noverhang checked his bulky figure and gave me a few seconds' grace.  I\nneeded it all, for these last steps on the shelf were the totterings of\nan old man.  Only a desperate resolution and an extreme terror made me\ndrag one foot after the other.  Blindly I staggered on to the top of\nthe ravine, and saw before me the _schimmel_ grazing in the light of the\nwestering sun.\n\nI forced myself into a sort of drunken run, and crawled into the\nsaddle.  Behind me, as I turned, I could see Laputa's shoulders rising\nover the edge.  I had no knife to cut the knee-halter, and the horse\ncould not stir.\n\nThen the miracle happened.  When the rope had gagged me, my teeth must\nhave nearly severed it at one place, and this Laputa had not noticed\nwhen he used it as a knee-halter.  The shock of my entering the saddle\nmade the _schimmel_ fling up his head violently, and the rope snapped.  I\ncould not find the stirrups, but I dug my heels into his sides, and he\nleaped forward.\n\nAt the same moment Laputa began to shoot.  It was a foolish move, for\nhe might have caught me by running, since I had neither spurs nor whip,\nand the horse was hampered by the loose end of rope at his knee.  In\nany case, being an indifferent shot, he should have aimed at the\n_schimmel_, not at me; but I suppose he wished to save his charger.  One\nbullet sang past my head; a second did my business for me.  It passed\nover my shoulder, as I lay low in the saddle, and grazed the beast's\nright ear.  The pain maddened him, and, rope-end and all, he plunged\ninto a wild gallop.  Other shots came, but they fell far short.  I saw\ndimly a native or two--the men who had followed us--rush to intercept\nme, and I think a spear was flung.  But in a flash we were past them,\nand their cries faded behind me. I found the bridle, reached for the\nstirrups, and galloped straight for the sunset and for freedom.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII\n\nHOW A MAN MAY SOMETIMES PUT HIS TRUST IN A HORSE\n\nI had long passed the limit of my strength.  Only constant fear and\nwild alternations of hope had kept me going so long, and now that I was\nsafe I became light-headed in earnest.  The wonder is that I did not\nfall off.  Happily the horse was good and the ground easy, for I was\npowerless to do any guiding.  I simply sat on his back in a silly glow\nof comfort, keeping a line for the dying sun, which I saw in a nick of\nthe Iron Crown Mountain.  A sort of childish happiness possessed me.\nAfter three days of imminent peril, to be free was to be in fairyland.\nTo be swishing through the long bracken or plunging among the\nbreast-high flowers of the meadowlands in a world of essential lights\nand fragrances, seemed scarcely part of mortal experience.  Remember\nthat I was little more than a lad, and that I had faced death so often\nof late that my mind was all adrift.  To be able to hope once more,\nnay, to be allowed to cease both from hope and fear, was like a deep\nand happy opiate to my senses.  Spent and frail as I was, my soul swam\nin blessed waters of ease.\n\nThe mood did not last long.  I came back to earth with a shock, as the\n_schimmel_ stumbled at the crossing of a stream.  I saw that the darkness\nwas fast falling, and with the sight panic returned to me.  Behind me I\nseemed to hear the sound of pursuit.  The noise was in my ears, but\nwhen I turned it ceased, and I saw only the dusky shoulders of hills.\n\nI tried to remember what Arcoll had told me about his headquarters, but\nmy memory was wiped clean.  I thought they were on or near the highway,\nbut I could not remember where the highway was.  Besides, he was close\nto the enemy, and I wanted to get back into the towns, far away from\nthe battle-line. If I rode west I must come in time to villages, where\nI could hide myself.  These were unworthy thoughts, but my excuse must\nbe my tattered nerves.  When a man comes out of great danger, he is apt\nto be a little deaf to the call of duty.\n\nSuddenly I became ashamed.  God had preserved me from deadly perils,\nbut not that I might cower in some shelter.  I had a mission as clear\nas Laputa's.  For the first time I became conscious to what a little\nthing I owed my salvation.  That matter of the broken halter was like\nthe finger of Divine Providence.  I had been saved for a purpose, and\nunless I fulfilled that purpose I should again be lost.  I was always a\nfatalist, and in that hour of strained body and soul I became something\nof a mystic.  My panic ceased, my lethargy departed, and a more manly\nresolution took their place.  I gripped the _schimmel_ by the head and\nturned him due left.  Now I remembered where the highroad ran, and I\nremembered something else.\n\nFor it was borne in on me that Laputa had fallen into my hands.\nWithout any subtle purpose I had played a master game.  He was cut off\nfrom his people, without a horse, on the wrong side of the highroad\nwhich Arcoll's men patrolled. Without him the rising would crumble.\nThere might be war, even desperate war, but we should fight against a\nleaderless foe.  If he could only be shepherded to the north, his game\nwas over, and at our leisure we could mop up the scattered\nconcentrations.\n\nI was now as eager to get back into danger as I had been to get into\nsafety.  Arcoll must be found and warned, and that at once, or Laputa\nwould slip over to Inanda's Kraal under cover of dark.  It was a matter\nof minutes, and on these minutes depended the lives of thousands.  It\nwas also a matter of ebbing strength, for with my return to common\nsense I saw very clearly how near my capital was spent.  If I could\nreach the highroad, find Arcoll or Arcoll's men, and give them my news,\nI would do my countrymen a service such as no man in Africa could\nrender.  But I felt my head swimming, I was swaying crazily in the\nsaddle, and my hands had scarcely the force of a child's.  I could only\nlie limply on the horse's back, clutching at his mane with trembling\nfingers.  I remember that my head was full of a text from the Psalms\nabout not putting one's trust in horses.  I prayed that this one horse\nmight be an exception, for he carried more than Caesar and his fortunes.\n\nMy mind is a blank about those last minutes.  In less than an hour\nafter my escape I struck the highway, but it was an hour which in the\nretrospect unrolls itself into unquiet years.  I was dimly conscious of\nscrambling through a ditch and coming to a ghostly white road.  The\n_schimmel_ swung to the right, and the next I knew some one had taken my\nbridle and was speaking to me.\n\nAt first I thought it was Laputa and screamed.  Then I must have\ntottered in the saddle, for I felt an arm slip round my middle.  The\nrider uncorked a bottle with his teeth and forced some brandy down my\nthroat.  I choked and coughed, and then looked up to see a white\npoliceman staring at me.  I knew the police by the green\nshoulder-straps.\n\n'Arcoll,' I managed to croak.  'For God's sake take me to Arcoll.'\n\nThe man whistled shrilly on his fingers, and a second rider came\ncantering down the road.  As he came up I recognized his face, but\ncould not put a name to it. 'Losh, it's the lad Crawfurd,' I heard a\nvoice say.  'Crawfurd, man, d'ye no mind me at Lourenco Marques?\nAitken?'\n\nThe Scotch tongue worked a spell with me.  It cleared my wits and\nopened the gates of my past life.  At last I knew I was among my own\nfolk.\n\n'I must see Arcoll.  I have news for him--tremendous news. O man, take\nme to Arcoll and ask me no questions.  Where is he?  Where is he?'\n\n'As it happens, he's about two hundred yards off,' Aitken said.  'That\nlight ye see at the top of the brae is his camp.'\n\nThey helped me up the road, a man on each side of me, for I could never\nhave kept in the saddle without their support. My message to Arcoll\nkept humming in my head as I tried to put it into words, for I had a\nhorrid fear that my wits would fail me and I should be dumb when the\ntime came.  Also I was in a fever of haste.  Every minute I wasted\nincreased Laputa's chance of getting back to the kraal.  He had men\nwith him every bit as skilful as Arcoll's trackers.  Unless Arcoll had\na big force and the best horses there was no hope.  Often in looking\nback at this hour I have marvelled at the strangeness of my behaviour.\nHere was I just set free from the certainty of a hideous death, and yet\nI had lost all joy in my security.  I was more fevered at the thought\nof Laputa's escape than I had been at the prospect of David Crawfurd's\nend.\n\nThe next thing I knew I was being lifted off the _schimmel_ by what\nseemed to me a thousand hands.  Then came a glow of light, a great\nmoon, in the centre of which I stood blinking.  I was forced to sit\ndown on a bed, while I was given a cup of hot tea, far more reviving\nthan any spirits.  I became conscious that some one was holding my\nhands, and speaking very slowly and gently.\n\n'Davie,' the voice said, 'you're back among friends, my lad. Tell me,\nwhere have you been?'\n\n'I want Arcoll,' I moaned.  'Where is Ratitswan?'  There were tears of\nweakness running down my cheeks.\n\n'Arcoll is here,' said the voice; 'he is holding your hands, Davie.\nQuiet, lad, quiet.  Your troubles are all over now.'\n\nI made a great effort, found the eyes to which the voice belonged, and\nspoke to them.\n\n'Listen.  I stole the collar of Prester John at Dupree's Drift. I was\ncaught in the Berg and taken to the kraal--I forget its name--but I had\nhid the rubies.'\n\n'Yes,' the voice said, 'you hid the rubies,--and then?'\n\n'Inkulu wanted them back, so I made a deal with him.  I took him to\nMachudi's and gave him the collar, and then he fired at me and I\nclimbed and climbed ...  I climbed on a horse,' I concluded childishly.\n\nI heard the voice say 'Yes?' again inquiringly, but my mind ran off at\na tangent.\n\n'Beyers took guns up into the Wolkberg,' I cried shrilly. 'Why the\ndevil don't you do the same?  You have the whole Kaffir army in a trap.'\n\nI saw a smiling face before me.\n\n'Good lad.  Colles told me you weren't wanting in intelligence. What if\nwe have done that very thing, Davie?'\n\nBut I was not listening.  I was trying to remember the thing I most\nwanted to say, and that was not about Beyers and his guns.  Those were\nnightmare minutes.  A speaker who has lost the thread of his discourse,\na soldier who with a bayonet at his throat has forgotten the\npassword--I felt like them, and worse. And to crown all I felt my\nfaintness coming back, and my head dropping with heaviness.  I was in a\ntorment of impotence.\n\nArcoll, still holding my hands, brought his face close to mine, so that\nhis clear eyes mastered and constrained me.\n\n'Look at me, Davie,' I heard him say.  'You have something to tell me,\nand it is very important.  It is about Laputa, isn't it? Think, man.\nYou took him to Machudi's and gave him the collar.  He has gone back\nwith it to Inanda's Kraal.  Very well, my guns will hold him there.'\n\nI shook my head.  'You can't.  You may split the army, but you can't\nhold Laputa.  He will be over the Olifants before you fire a shot.' 'We\nwill hunt him down before he crosses.  And if not, we will catch him at\nthe railway.'\n\n'For God's sake, hurry then,' I cried.  'In an hour he will be over it\nand back in the kraal.'\n\n'But the river is a long way.'\n\n'River?' I repeated hazily.  'What river?  The Letaba is not the place.\nIt is the road I mean.'\n\nArcoll's hands closed firmly on my wrists.\n\n'You left Laputa at Machudi's and rode here without stopping. That\nwould take you an hour.  Had Laputa a horse?'\n\n'Yes; but I took it,' I stammered.  'You can see it behind me.' Arcoll\ndropped my hands and stood up straight.\n\n'By God, we've got him!' he said, and he spoke to his companions.  A\nman turned and ran out of the tent.\n\nThen I remembered what I wanted to say.  I struggled from the bed and\nput my hands on his shoulders.\n\n'Laputa is our side of the highroad.  Cut him off from his men, and\ndrive him north--north--away up to the Rooirand. Never mind the\nWolkberg and the guns, for they can wait.  I tell you Laputa is the\nRising, and he has the collar.  Without him you can mop up the Kaffirs\nat your leisure.  Line the high-road with every man you have, for he\nmust cross it or perish. Oh, hurry, man, hurry; never mind me.  We're\nsaved if we can chivy Laputa till morning.  Quick, or I'll have to go\nmyself.'\n\nThe tent emptied, and I lay back on the bed with a dim feeling that my\nduty was done and I could rest.  Henceforth the affair was in stronger\nhands than mine.  I was so weak that I could not lift my legs up to the\nbed, but sprawled half on and half off.\n\nUtter exhaustion defeats sleep.  I was in a fever, and my eyes would\nnot close.  I lay and drowsed while it seemed to me that the outside\nworld was full of men and horses.  I heard voices and the sound of\nhoofs and the jingle of bridles, but above all I heard the solid tramp\nof an army.  The whole earth seemed to be full of war.  Before my mind\nwas spread the ribbon of the great highway.  I saw it run white through\nthe meadows of the plateau, then in a dark corkscrew down the glen of\nthe Letaba, then white again through the vast moonlit bush of the\nplains, till the shanties of Wesselsburg rose at the end of it.  It\nseemed to me to be less a road than a rampart, built of shining marble,\nthe Great Wall of Africa.  I saw Laputa come out of the shadows and try\nto climb it, and always there was the sound of a rifle-breech clicking,\na summons, and a flight.  I began to take a keen interest in the game.\nDown in the bush were the dark figures of the hunted, and on the white\nwall were my own people--horse, foot, and artillery, the squadrons of\nour defence.  What a general Arcoll was, and how great a matter had\nDavid Crawfurd kindled!\n\nA man came in--I suppose a doctor.  He took off my leggings and boots,\ncutting them from my bleeding feet, but I knew no pain.  He felt my\npulse and listened to my heart.  Then he washed my face and gave me a\nbowl of hot milk.  There must have been a drug in the milk, for I had\nscarcely drunk it before a tide of sleep seemed to flow over my brain.\nThe white rampart faded from my eyes and I slept.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX\n\nARCOLL'S SHEPHERDING\n\nWhile I lay in a drugged slumber great things were happening. What I\nhave to tell is no experience of my own, but the story as I pieced it\ntogether afterwards from talks with Arcoll and Aitken.  The history of\nthe Rising has been compiled.  As I write I see before me on the\nshelves two neat blue volumes in which Mr Alexander Upton, sometime\ncorrespondent of the _Times_, has told for the edification of posterity\nthe tale of the war between the Plains and the Plateau.  To him the\nKaffir hero is Umbooni, a half-witted ruffian, whom we afterwards\ncaught and hanged.  He mentions Laputa only in a footnote as a renegade\nChristian who had something to do with fomenting discontent.  He\nconsiders that the word 'Inkulu,' which he often heard, was a Zulu name\nfor God.  Mr Upton is a picturesque historian, but he knew nothing of\nthe most romantic incident of all.  This is the tale of the midnight\nshepherding of the 'heir of John' by Arcoll and his irregulars.\n\nAt Bruderstroom, where I was lying unconscious, there were two hundred\nmen of the police; sixty-three Basuto scouts under a man called\nStephen, who was half native in blood and wholly native in habits; and\nthree commandoes of the farmers, each about forty strong.  The\ncommandoes were really companies of the North Transvaal Volunteers, but\nthe old name had been kept and something of the old loose organization.\nThere were also two four-gun batteries of volunteer artillery, but\nthese were out on the western skirts of the Wolkberg following Beyers's\nhistoric precedent.  Several companies of regulars were on their way\nfrom Pietersdorp, but they did not arrive till the next day.  When they\ncame they went to the Wolkberg to join the artillery.  Along the Berg\nat strategic points were pickets of police with native trackers, and at\nBlaauwildebeestefontein there was a strong force with two field guns,\nfor there was some fear of a second Kaffir army marching by that place\nto Inanda's Kraal.  At Wesselsburg out on the plain there was a biggish\npolice patrol, and a system of small patrols along the road, with a\nfair number of Basuto scouts.  But the road was picketed, not held; for\nArcoll's patrols were only a branch of his Intelligence Department.  It\nwas perfectly easy, as I had found myself, to slip across in a gap of\nthe pickets.\n\nLaputa would be in a hurry, and therefore he would try to cross at the\nnearest point.  Hence it was Arcoll's first business to hold the line\nbetween the defile of the Letaba and the camp at Bruderstroom.  A\ndetachment of the police who were well mounted galloped at racing speed\nfor the defile, and behind them the rest lined out along the road.  The\nfarmers took a line at right angles to the road, so as to prevent an\nescape on the western flank.  The Basutos were sent into the woods as a\nsort of advanced post to bring tidings of any movement there. Finally a\nbody of police with native runners at their stirrups rode on to the\ndrift where the road crosses the Letaba.  The place is called Main\nDrift, and you will find it on the map. The natives were first of all\nto locate Laputa, and prevent him getting out on the south side of the\ntriangle of hill and wood between Machudi's, the road, and the Letaba.\nIf he failed there, he must try to ford the Letaba below the drift, and\ncross the road between the drift and Wesselsburg.  Now Arcoll had not\nmen enough to watch the whole line, and therefore if Laputa were once\ndriven below the drift, he must shift his men farther down the road.\nConsequently it was of the first importance to locate Laputa's\nwhereabouts, and for this purpose the native trackers were sent\nforward.  There was just a chance of capturing him, but Arcoll knew too\nwell his amazing veld-craft and great strength of body to build much\nhope on that.\n\nWe were none too soon.  The advance men of the police rode into one of\nthe Kaffirs from Inanda's Kraal, whom Laputa had sent forward to see if\nthe way was clear.  In two minutes more he would have been across and\nout of our power, for we had no chance of overtaking him in the woody\nravines of the Letaba.  The Kaffir, when he saw us, dived back into the\ngrass on the north side of the road, which made it clear that Laputa\nwas still there.\n\nAfter that nothing happened for a little.  The police reached their\ndrift, and all the road west of that point was strongly held.  The\nflanking commandoes joined hands with one of the police posts farther\nnorth, and moved slowly to the scarp of the Berg.  They saw nobody;\nfrom which Arcoll could deduce that his man had gone down the Berg into\nthe forests.\n\nHad the Basutos been any good at woodcraft we should have had better\nintelligence.  But living in a bare mountain country they are apt to\nfind themselves puzzled in a forest.  The best men among the trackers\nwere some renegades of 'Mpefu, who sent back word by a device known\nonly to Arcoll that five Kaffirs were in the woods a mile north of Main\nDrift.  By this time it was after ten o'clock, and the moon was rising.\nThe five men separated soon after, and the reports became confused.\nThen Laputa, as the biggest of the five, was located on the banks of\nthe Great Letaba about two miles below Main Drift.\n\nThe question was as to his crossing.  Arcoll had assumed that he would\nswim the river and try to get over the road between Main Drift and\nWesselsburg.  But in this assumption he underrated the shrewdness of\nhis opponent.  Laputa knew perfectly well that we had not enough men to\npatrol the whole countryside, but that the river enabled us to divide\nthe land into two sections and concentrate strongly on one or the\nother. Accordingly he left the Great Letaba unforded and resolved to\nmake a long circuit back to the Berg.  One of his Kaffirs swam the\nriver, and when word of this was brought Arcoll began to withdraw his\nposts farther down the road.  But as the men were changing 'Mpefu's\nfellows got wind of Laputa's turn to the left, and in great haste\nArcoll countermanded the move and waited in deep perplexity at Main\nDrift.\n\nThe salvation of his scheme was the farmers on the scarp of the Berg.\nThey lit fires and gave Laputa the notion of a great army.  Instead of\ngoing up the glen of Machudi or the Letsitela he bore away to the north\nfor the valley of the Klein Letaba. The pace at which he moved must\nhave been amazing.  He had a great physique, hard as nails from long\ntravelling, and in his own eyes he had an empire at stake.  When I look\nat the map and see the journey which with vast fatigue I completed from\nDupree's Drift to Machudi's, and then look at the huge spaces of\ncountry over which Laputa's legs took him on that night, I am lost in\nadmiration of the man.\n\nAbout midnight he must have crossed the Letsitela.  Here he made a\ngrave blunder.  If he had tried the Berg by one of the faces he might\nhave got on to the plateau and been at Inanda's Kraal by the dawning.\nBut he over-estimated the size of the commandoes, and held on to the\nnorth, where he thought there would be no defence.  About one o'clock\nArcoll, tired of inaction and conscious that he had misread Laputa's\ntactics, resolved on a bold stroke.  He sent half his police to the\nBerg to reinforce the commandoes, bidding them get into touch with the\npost at Blaauwildebeestefontein.\n\nA little after two o'clock a diversion occurred.  Henriques succeeded\nin crossing the road three miles east of Main Drift. He had probably\nleft the kraal early in the night and had tried to cross farther west,\nbut had been deterred by the patrols. East of Main Drift, where the\npolice were fewer, he succeeded; but he had not gone far till he was\ndiscovered by the Basuto scouts.  The find was reported to Arcoll, who\nguessed at once who this traveller was.  He dared not send out any of\nhis white men, but he bade a party of the scouts follow the\nPortugoose's trail.  They shadowed him to Dupree's Drift, where he\ncrossed the Letaba.  There he lay down by the roadside to sleep, while\nthey kept him company.  A hard fellow Henriques was, for he could\nslumber peacefully on the very scene of his murder.\n\nDawn found Laputa at the head of the Klein Letaba glen, not far from\n'Mpefu's kraal.  He got food at a hut, and set off at once up the\nwooded hill above it, which is a promontory of the plateau.  By this\ntime he must have been weary, or he would not have blundered as he did\nright into a post of the farmers.  He was within an ace of capture, and\nto save himself was forced back from the scarp.  He seems, to judge\nfrom reports, to have gone a little way south in the thicker timber,\nand then to have turned north again in the direction of\nBlaauwildebeestefontein.  After that his movements are obscure.  He was\nseen on the Klein Labongo, but the sight of the post at\nBlaauwildebeestefontein must have convinced him that a _korhaan_ could\nnot escape that way.  The next we heard of him was that he had joined\nHenriques. After daybreak Arcoll, having got his reports from the\nplateau, and knowing roughly the direction in which Laputa was shaping,\ndecided to advance his lines.  The farmers, reinforced by three more\ncommandoes from the Pietersdorp district, still held the plateau, but\nthe police were now on the line of the Great Letaba.  It was Arcoll's\nplan to hold that river and the long neck of land between it and the\nLabongo.  His force was hourly increasing, and his mounted men would be\nable to prevent any escape on the flank to the east of Wesselsburg.\n\nSo it happened that while Laputa was being driven east from the Berg,\nHenriques was travelling north, and their lines intersected.  I should\nlike to have seen the meeting.  It must have told Laputa what had\nalways been in the Portugoose's heart.  Henriques, I fancy, was making\nfor the cave in the Rooirand.  Laputa, so far as I can guess at his\nmind, had a plan for getting over the Portuguese border, fetching a\nwide circuit, and joining his men at any of the concentrations between\nthere and Amsterdam.\n\nThe two were seen at midday going down the road which leads from\nBlaauwildebeestefontein to the Lebombo.  Then they struck Arcoll's new\nfront, which stretched from the Letaba to the Labongo.  This drove them\nnorth again, and forced them to swim the latter stream.  From there to\nthe eastern extremity of the Rooirand, which is the Portuguese\nfrontier, the country is open and rolling, with a thin light scrub in\nthe hollows.  It was bad cover for the fugitives, as they found to\ntheir cost.  For Arcoll had purposely turned his police into a flying\ncolumn.  They no longer held a line; they scoured a country.  Only\nLaputa's incomparable veld-craft and great bodily strength prevented\nthe two from being caught in half an hour.  They doubled back, swam the\nLabongo again, and got into the thick bush on the north side of the\nBlaauwildebeestefontein road.  The Basuto scouts were magnificent in\nthe open, but in the cover they were again at fault.  Laputa and\nHenriques fairly baffled them, so that the pursuit turned to the west\nin the belief that the fugitives had made for Majinje's kraal.  In\nreality they had recrossed the Labongo and were making for Umvelos'.\n\n\nAll this I heard afterwards, but in the meantime I lay in Arcoll's tent\nin deep unconsciousness.  While my enemies were being chased like\npartridges, I was reaping the fruits of four days' toil and terror.\nThe hunters had become the hunted, the wheel had come full circle, and\nthe woes of David Crawfurd were being abundantly avenged.\n\nI slept till midday of the next day.  When I awoke the hot noontide sun\nhad made the tent like an oven.  I felt better, but very stiff and\nsore, and I had a most ungovernable thirst. There was a pail of water\nwith a tin pannikin beside the tent pole, and out of this I drank\nrepeated draughts.  Then I lay down again, for I was still very weary.\n\nBut my second sleep was not like my first.  It was haunted by wild\nnightmares.  No sooner had I closed my eyes than I began to live and\nmove in a fantastic world.  The whole bush of the plains lay before me,\nand I watched it as if from some view-point in the clouds.  It was\nmidday, and the sandy patches shimmered under a haze of heat.  I saw\nodd little movements in the bush--a buck's head raised, a paauw\nstalking solemnly in the long grass, a big crocodile rolling off a\nmudbank in the river.  And then I saw quite clearly Laputa's figure\ngoing east.\n\nIn my sleep I did not think about Arcoll's manoeuvres.  My mind was\nwholly set upon Laputa.  He was walking wearily, yet at a good pace,\nand his head was always turning, like a wild creature snuffing the\nwind.  There was something with him, a shapeless shadow, which I could\nnot see clearly.  His neck was bare, but I knew well that the collar\nwas in his pouch.\n\nHe stopped, turned west, and I lost him.  The bush world for a space\nwas quite silent, and I watched it eagerly as an aeronaut would watch\nthe ground for a descent.  For a long time I could see nothing.  Then\nin a wood near a river there seemed to be a rustling.  Some guinea-fowl\nflew up as if startled, and a stembok scurried out.  I knew that Laputa\nmust be there.\n\nThen, as I looked at the river, I saw a head swimming.  Nay, I saw two,\none some distance behind the other.  The first man landed on the far\nbank, and I recognized Laputa.  The second was a slight short figure,\nand I knew it was Henriques.\n\nI remember feeling very glad that these two had come together.  It was\ncertain now that Henriques would not escape. Either Laputa would find\nout the truth and kill him, or I would come up with him and have my\nrevenge.  In any case he was outside the Kaffir pale, adventuring on\nhis own.\n\nI watched the two till they halted near a ruined building. Surely this\nwas the store I had built at Umvelos'.  The thought gave me a horrid\nsurprise.  Laputa and Henriques were on their way to the Rooirand!\n\n\nI woke with a start to find my forehead damp with sweat. There was some\nfever on me, I think, for my teeth were chattering.  Very clear in my\nmind was the disquieting thought that Laputa and Henriques would soon\nbe in the cave.\n\nOne of two things must happen--either Henriques would kill Laputa, get\nthe collar of rubies, and be in the wilds of Mozambique before I could\ncome up with his trail; or Laputa would outwit him, and have the\nhandling himself of the treasure of gold and diamonds which had been\nlaid up for the rising.  If he thought there was a risk of defeat, I\nknew he would send my gems to the bottom of the Labongo, and all my\nweary work would go for nothing.  I had forgotten all about patriotism.\nIn that hour the fate of the country was nothing to me, and I got no\nsatisfaction from the thought that Laputa was severed from his army.\nMy one idea was that the treasure would be lost, the treasure for which\nI had risked my life.\n\nThere is a kind of courage which springs from bitter anger and\ndisappointment.  I had thought that I had bankrupted my spirit, but I\nfound that there was a new passion in me to which my past sufferings\ntaught no lesson.  My uneasiness would not let me rest a moment longer.\nI rose to my feet, holding on by the bed, and staggered to the tent\npole.  I was weak, but not so very weak that I could not make one last\neffort.  It maddened me that I should have done so much and yet fail at\nthe end.\n\nFrom a nail on the tent pole hung a fragment of looking-glass which\nArcoll used for shaving.  I caught a glimpse of my face in it, white\nand haggard and lined, with blue bags below the eyes.  The doctor the\nnight before had sponged it, but he had not got rid of all the stains\nof travel.  In particular there was a faint splash of blood on the left\ntemple.  I remembered that this was what I had got from the basin of\ngoat's blood that night in the cave. I think that the sight of that\nsplash determined me.  Whether I willed it or not, I was sealed of\nLaputa's men.  I must play the game to the finish, or never again know\npeace of mind on earth.  These last four days had made me very old.\n\n\nI found a pair of Arcoll's boots, roomy with much wearing, into which I\nthrust my bruised feet.  Then I crawled to the door, and shouted for a\nboy to bring my horse.  A Basuto appeared, and, awed by my appearance,\nwent off in a hurry to see to the _schimmel_.  It was late afternoon,\nabout the same time of day as had yesterday seen me escaping from\nMachudi's.  The Bruderstroom camp was empty, though sentinels were\nposted at the approaches.  I beckoned the only white man I saw, and\nasked where Arcoll was.  He told me that he had no news, but added that\nthe patrols were still on the road as far as Wesselsburg. From this I\ngathered that Arcoll must have gone far out into the bush in his chase.\nI did not want to see him; above all, I did not want him to find\nLaputa.  It was my private business that I rode on, and I asked for no\nallies.\n\nSomebody brought me a cup of thick coffee, which I could not drink, and\nhelped me into the saddle.  The _schimmel_ was fresh, and kicked freely\nas I cantered off the grass into the dust of the highroad.  The whole\nworld, I remember, was still and golden in the sunset.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX\n\nMY LAST SIGHT OF THE REVEREND JOHN LAPUTA\n\nIt was dark before I got into the gorge of the Letaba.  I passed many\npatrols, but few spoke to me, and none tried to stop me. Some may have\nknown me, but I think it was my face and figure which tied their\ntongues.  I must have been pale as death, with tangled hair and fever\nburning in my eyes.  Also on my left temple was the splash of blood.\n\nAt Main Drift I found a big body of police holding the ford. I splashed\nthrough and stumbled into one of their camp-fires. A man questioned me,\nand told me that Arcoll had got his quarry.  'He's dead, they say.\nThey shot him out on the hills when he was making for the Limpopo.'\nBut I knew that this was not true.  It was burned on my mind that\nLaputa was alive, nay, was waiting for me, and that it was God's will\nthat we should meet in the cave.\n\nA little later I struck the track of the Kaffirs' march.  There was a\nbroad, trampled way through the bush, and I followed it, for it led to\nDupree's Drift.  All this time I was urging the _schimmel_ with all the\nvigour I had left in me.  I had quite lost any remnant of fear.  There\nwere no terrors left for me either from Nature or man.  At Dupree's\nDrift I rode the ford without a thought of crocodiles.  I looked\nplacidly at the spot where Henriques had slain the Keeper and I had\nstolen the rubies. There was no interest or imagination lingering in my\ndull brain.  My nerves had suddenly become things of stolid, untempered\niron.  Each landmark I passed was noted down as one step nearer to my\nobject.  At Umvelos' I had not the leisure to do more than glance at\nthe shell which I had built.  I think I had forgotten all about that\nnight when I lay in the cellar and heard Laputa's plans.  Indeed, my\ndoings of the past days were all hazy and trivial in my mind.  I only\nsaw one sight clearly--two men, one tall and black, the other little\nand sallow, slowly creeping nearer to the Rooirand, and myself, a\nmidget on a horse, spurring far behind through the bush on their trail.\nI saw the picture as continuously and clearly as if I had been looking\nat a scene on the stage.  There was only one change in the setting; the\nthree figures seemed to be gradually closing together.\n\nI had no exhilaration in my quest.  I do not think I had even much\nhope, for something had gone numb and cold in me and killed my youth.\nI told myself that treasure-hunting was an enterprise accursed of God,\nand that I should most likely die. That Laputa and Henriques would die\nI was fully certain. The three of us would leave our bones to bleach\namong the diamonds, and in a little the Prester's collar would glow\namid a little heap of human dust.  I was quite convinced of all this,\nand quite apathetic.  It really did not matter so long as I came up\nwith Laputa and Henriques, and settled scores with them.  That mattered\neverything in the world, for it was my destiny.\n\nI had no means of knowing how long I took, but it was after midnight\nbefore I passed Umvelos', and ere I got to the Rooirand there was a\nfluttering of dawn in the east.  I must have passed east of Arcoll's\nmen, who were driving the bush towards Majinje's.  I had ridden the\nnight down and did not feel so very tired.  My horse was stumbling, but\nmy own limbs scarcely pained me.  To be sure I was stiff and nerveless\nas if hewn out of wood, but I had been as bad when I left Bruderstroom.\nI felt as if I could go on riding to the end of the world.\n\nAt the brink of the bush I dismounted and turned the _schimmel_ loose.  I\nhad brought no halter, and I left him to graze and roll.  The light was\nsufficient to let me see the great rock face rising in a tower of dim\npurple.  The sky was still picked out with stars, but the moon had long\ngone down, and the east was flushing.  I marched up the path to the\ncave, very different from the timid being who had walked the same road\nthree nights before.  Then my terrors were all to come: now I had\nconquered terror and seen the other side of fear.  I was centuries\nolder.\n\nBut beside the path lay something which made me pause.  It was a dead\nbody, and the head was turned away from me.  I did not need to see the\nface to know who it was.  There had been only two men in my vision, and\none of them was immortal.\n\nI stopped and turned the body over.  There was no joy in my heart, none\nof the lust of satisfied vengeance or slaked hate. I had forgotten\nabout the killing of my dog and all the rest of Henriques' doings.  It\nwas only with curiosity that I looked down on the dead face, swollen\nand livid in the first light of morning.\n\nThe man had been strangled.  His neck, as we say in Scotland, was\n'thrawn', and that was why he had lain on his back yet with his face\nturned away from me.  He had been dead probably since before midnight.\nI looked closer, and saw that there was blood on his shirt and hands,\nbut no wound.  It was not his blood, but some other's.  Then a few feet\noff on the path I found a pistol with two chambers empty.\n\nWhat had happened was very plain.  Henriques had tried to shoot Laputa\nat the entrance of the cave for the sake of the collar and the treasure\nwithin.  He had wounded him--gravely, I thought, to judge from the\namount of blood--but the quickness and marksmanship of the Portuguese\nhad not availed to save his life from those terrible hands.  After two\nshots Laputa had got hold of him and choked his life out as easily as a\nman twists a partridge's neck.  Then he had gone into the cave.\n\nI saw the marks of blood on the road, and hastened on. Laputa had been\nhours in the cave, enough to work havoc with the treasure.  He was\nwounded, too, and desperate.  Probably he had come to the Rooirand\nlooking for sanctuary and rest for a day or two, but if Henriques had\nshot straight he might find a safer sanctuary and a longer rest.  For\nthe third time in my life I pushed up the gully between the straight\nhigh walls of rock, and heard from the heart of the hills the thunder\nof the imprisoned river.\n\nThere was only the faintest gleam of light in the cleft, but it\nsufficed to show me that the way to the cave was open.  The hidden\nturnstile in the right wall stood ajar; I entered, and carelessly swung\nit behind me.  The gates clashed into place with a finality which told\nme that they were firmly shut.  I did not know the secret of them, so\nhow should I get out again?\n\nThese things troubled me less than the fact that I had no light at all\nnow.  I had to go on my knees to ascend the stair, and I could feel\nthat the steps were wet.  It must be Laputa's blood.\n\nNext I was out on the gallery which skirted the chasm.  The sky above\nme was growing pale with dawn, and far below the tossing waters were\nfretted with light.  A light fragrant wind was blowing on the hills,\nand a breath of it came down the funnel.  I saw that my hands were all\nbloody with the stains on the steps, and I rubbed them on the rock to\nclean them. Without a tremor I crossed the stone slab over the gorge,\nand plunged into the dark alley which led to the inner chamber.\n\nAs before, there was a light in front of me, but this time it was a\npin-point and not the glare of many torches.  I felt my way carefully\nby the walls of the passage, though I did not really fear anything.  It\nwas by the stopping of these lateral walls that I knew I was in the\ncave, for the place had only one single speck of light.  The falling\nwall of water stood out grey green and ghostly on the left, and I\nnoticed that higher up it was lit as if from the open air.  There must\nbe a great funnel in the hillside in that direction.  I walked a few\npaces, and then I made out that the spark in front was a lantern.\n\nMy eyes were getting used to the half-light, and I saw what was beside\nthe lantern.  Laputa knelt on the ashes of the fire which the Keeper\nhad kindled three days before.  He knelt before, and half leaned on, a\nrude altar of stone.  The lantern stood by him on the floor, and its\nfaint circle lit something which I was not unprepared for.  Blood was\nwelling from his side, and spreading in a dark pool over the ashes.\n\nI had no fear, only a great pity--pity for lost romance, for vain\nendeavour, for fruitless courage.  'Greeting, Inkulu!' I said in\nKaffir, as if I had been one of his indunas.\n\nHe turned his head and slowly and painfully rose to his feet. The\nplace, it was clear, was lit from without, and the daylight was\ngrowing.  The wall of the river had become a sheet of jewels, passing\nfrom pellucid diamond above to translucent emerald below.  A dusky\ntwilight sought out the extreme corners of the cave.  Laputa's tall\nfigure stood swaying above the white ashes, his hand pressed to his\nside.\n\n'Who is it?' he said, looking at me with blind eyes.\n\n'It is the storekeeper from Umvelos',' I answered.\n\n'The storekeeper of Umvelos',' he repeated.  'God has used the weak\nthings of the world to confound the strong.  A king dies because a\npedlar is troublesome.  What do they call you, man?  You deserve to be\nremembered.'\n\nI told him 'David Crawfurd.'\n\n'Crawfurd,' he repeated, 'you have been the little reef on which a\ngreat vessel has foundered.  You stole the collar and cut me off from\nmy people, and then when I was weary the Portuguese killed me.'\n\n'No,' I cried, 'it was not me.  You trusted Henriques, and you got your\nfingers on his neck too late.  Don't say I didn't warn you.'\n\n'You warned me, and I will repay you.  I will make you rich, Crawfurd.\nYou are a trader, and want money.  I am a king, and want a throne.  But\nI am dying, and there will be no more kings in Africa.'\n\nThe mention of riches did not thrill me as I had expected, but the last\nwords awakened a wild regret.  I was hypnotized by the man.  To see him\ngoing out was like seeing the fall of a great mountain.\n\nHe stretched himself, gasping, and in the growing light I could see how\nbroken he was.  His cheeks were falling in, and his sombre eyes had\nshrunk back in their sockets.  He seemed an old worn man standing there\namong the ashes, while the blood, which he made no effort to staunch,\ntrickled down his side till it dripped on the floor.  He had ceased to\nbe the Kaffir king, or the Christian minister, or indeed any one of his\nformer parts.  Death was stripping him to his elements, and the man\nLaputa stood out beyond and above the characters he had played,\nsomething strange, and great, and moving, and terrible.\n\n'We met for the first time three days ago,' he said, 'and now you will\nbe the last to see the Inkulu.'\n\n'Umvelos' was not our first meeting,' said I.  'Do you mind the Sabbath\neight years since when you preached in the Free Kirk at Kirkcaple?  I\nwas the boy you chased from the shore, and I flung the stone that\nblacked your eye.  Besides, I came out from England with you and\nHenriques, and I was in the boat which took you from Durban to Delagoa\nBay.  You and I have been long acquaint, Mr Laputa.'\n\n'It is the hand of God,' he said solemnly.  'Your fate has been twisted\nwith mine, and now you will die with me.'\n\nI did not understand this talk about dying.  I was not mortally wounded\nlike him, and I did not think Laputa had the strength to kill me even\nif he wished.  But my mind was so impassive that I scarcely regarded\nhis words.\n\n'I will make you rich,' he cried.  'Crawfurd, the storekeeper, will be\nthe richest man in Africa.  We are scattered, and our wealth is\nanother's.  He shall have the gold and the diamonds--all but the\nCollar, which goes with me.'\n\nHe staggered into a dark recess, one of many in the cave, and I\nfollowed him.  There were boxes there, tea chests, cartridge cases, and\nold brass-ribbed Portuguese coffers. Laputa had keys at his belt, and\nunlocked them, his fingers fumbling with weakness.  I peered in and saw\ngold coin and little bags of stones.\n\n'Money and diamonds,' he cried.  'Once it was the war chest of a king,\nand now it will be the hoard of a trader.  No, by the Lord!  The\ntrader's place is with the Terrible Ones.'  An arm shot out, and my\nshoulder was fiercely gripped.\n\n'You stole my horse.  That is why I am dying.  But for you I and my\narmy would be over the Olifants.  I am going to kill you, Crawfurd,'\nand his fingers closed in to my shoulder blades.\n\nStill I was unperturbed.  'No, you are not.  You cannot.  You have\ntried to and failed.  So did Henriques, and he is lying dead outside.\nI am in God's keeping, and cannot die before my time.'\n\nI do not know if he heard me, but at any rate the murderous fit passed.\nHis hand fell to his side and his great figure tottered out into the\ncave.  He seemed to be making for the river, but he turned and went\nthrough the door I had entered by.  I heard him slipping in the\npassage, and then there was a minute of silence.\n\nSuddenly there came a grinding sound, followed by the kind of muffled\nsplash which a stone makes when it falls into a deep well.  I thought\nLaputa had fallen into the chasm, but when I reached the door his\nswaying figure was coming out of the corridor.  Then I knew what he had\ndone.  He had used the remnant of his giant strength to break down the\nbridge of stone across the gorge, and so cut off my retreat.\n\nI really did not care.  Even if I had got over the bridge I should\nprobably have been foiled by the shut turnstile.  I had quite forgotten\nthe meaning of fear of death.\n\nI found myself giving my arm to the man who had tried to destroy me.\n\n'I have laid up for you treasure in heaven,' he said.  'Your earthly\ntreasure is in the boxes, but soon you will be seeking incorruptible\njewels in the deep deep water.  It is cool and quiet down there, and\nyou forget the hunger and pain.'\n\nThe man was getting very near his end.  The madness of despair came\nback to him, and he flung himself among the ashes.\n\n'We are going to die together, Crawfurd,' he said.  'God has twined our\nthreads, and there will be only one cutting.  Tell me what has become\nof my army.'\n\n'Arcoll has guns on the Wolkberg,' I said.  'They must submit or\nperish.'\n\n'I have other armies ...  No, no, they are nothing.  They will all\nwander and blunder and fight and be beaten.  There is no leader\nanywhere ...  And I am dying.'\n\nThere was no gainsaying the signs of death.  I asked him if he would\nlike water, but he made no answer.  His eyes were fixed on vacancy, and\nI thought I could realize something of the bitterness of that great\nregret.  For myself I was as cold as a stone.  I had no exultation of\ntriumph, still less any fear of my own fate.  I stood silent, the\nhalf-remorseful spectator of a fall like the fall of Lucifer.\n\n'I would have taught the world wisdom.'  Laputa was speaking English in\na strange, thin, abstracted voice.  'There would have been no king like\nme since Charlemagne,' and he strayed into Latin which I have been told\nsince was an adaptation of the Epitaph of Charles the Great.  '_Sub hoc\nconditorio_,' he crooned, '_situm est corpus Joannis, magni et orthodoxi\nImperatoris, qui imperium Africanum nobiliter ampliavit, et multos per\nannos mundum feliciter rexit_.'[1]  He must have chosen this epitaph\nlong ago.\n\nHe lay for a few seconds with his head on his arms, his breast heaving\nwith agony.\n\n'No one will come after me.  My race is doomed, and in a little they\nwill have forgotten my name.  I alone could have saved them.  Now they\ngo the way of the rest, and the warriors of John become drudges and\nslaves.'\n\nSomething clicked in his throat, he gasped and fell forward, and I\nthought he was dead.  Then he struggled as if to rise.  I ran to him,\nand with all my strength aided him to his feet.\n\n'Unarm, Eros,' he cried.  'The long day's task is done.'  With the\nstrange power of a dying man he tore off his leopard-skin and belt till\nhe stood stark as on the night when he had been crowned.  From his\npouch he took the Prester's Collar.  Then he staggered to the brink of\nthe chasm where the wall of green water dropped into the dark depth\nbelow.\n\nI watched, fascinated, as with the weak hands of a child he twined the\nrubies round his neck and joined the clasp.  Then with a last effort he\nstood straight up on the brink, his eyes raised to the belt of daylight\nfrom which the water fell.  The light caught the great gems and called\nfires from them, the flames of the funeral pyre of a king.\n\nOnce more his voice, restored for a moment to its old vigour, rang out\nthrough the cave above the din of the cascade.  His words were those\nwhich the Keeper had used three nights before.  With his hands held\nhigh and the Collar burning on his neck he cried, 'The Snake returns to\nthe House of its Birth.'\n\n'Come,' he cried to me.  'The Heir of John is going home.' Then he\nleapt into the gulf.  There was no sound of falling, so great was the\nrush of water.  He must have been whirled into the open below where the\nbridge used to be, and then swept into the underground deeps, where the\nLabongo drowses for thirty miles.  Far from human quest he sleeps his\nlast sleep, and perhaps on a fragment of bone washed into a crevice of\nrock there may hang the jewels that once gleamed in Sheba's hair.\n\n\n[1] 'Under this stone is laid the body of John, the great and orthodox\nEmperor, who nobly enlarged the African realm, and for many years\nhappily ruled the world.'\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI\n\nI CLIMB THE CRAGS A SECOND TIME\n\nI remember that I looked over the brink into the yeasty abyss with a\nmind hovering between perplexity and tears.  I wanted to sit down and\ncry--why, I did not know, except that some great thing had happened.\nMy brain was quite clear as to my own position.  I was shut in this\nplace, with no chance of escape and with no food.  In a little I must\ndie of starvation, or go mad and throw myself after Laputa.  And yet I\ndid not care a rush.  My nerves had been tried too greatly in the past\nweek. Now I was comatose, and beyond hoping or fearing.\n\nI sat for a long time watching the light play on the fretted sheet of\nwater and wondering where Laputa's body had gone. I shivered and wished\nhe had not left me alone, for the darkness would come in time and I had\nno matches.  After a little I got tired of doing nothing, and went\ngroping among the treasure chests.  One or two were full of\ncoin--British sovereigns, Kruger sovereigns, Napoleons, Spanish and\nPortuguese gold pieces, and many older coins ranging back to the Middle\nAges and even to the ancients.  In one handful there was a splendid\ngold stater, and in another a piece of Antoninus Pius.  The treasure\nhad been collected for many years in many places, contributions of\nchiefs from ancient hoards as well as the cash received from I.D.B.  I\nuntied one or two of the little bags of stones and poured the contents\ninto my hands.  Most of the diamonds were small, such as a labourer\nmight secrete on his person.  The larger ones--and some were very\nlarge--were as a rule discoloured, looking more like big cairngorms.\nBut one or two bags had big stones which even my inexperienced eye told\nme were of the purest water.  There must be some new pipe, I thought,\nfor these could not have been stolen from any known mine.\n\n* * *\n\nAfter that I sat on the floor again and looked at the water.  It\nexercised a mesmeric influence on me, soothing all care.  I was quite\nhappy to wait for death, for death had no meaning to me.  My hate and\nfury were both lulled into a trance, since the passive is the next\nstage to the overwrought.\n\nIt must have been full day outside now, for the funnel was bright with\nsunshine, and even the dim cave caught a reflected radiance.  As I\nwatched the river I saw a bird flash downward, skimming the water.  It\nturned into the cave and fluttered among its dark recesses.  I heard\nits wings beating the roof as it sought wildly for an outlet.  It\ndashed into the spray of the cataract and escaped again into the cave.\nFor maybe twenty minutes it fluttered, till at last it found the way it\nhad entered by.  With a dart it sped up the funnel of rock into light\nand freedom.\n\nI had begun to watch the bird in idle lassitude, I ended in keen\nexcitement.  The sight of it seemed to take a film from my eyes.  I\nrealized the zest of liberty, the passion of life again.  I felt that\nbeyond this dim underworld there was the great joyous earth, and I\nlonged for it.  I wanted to live now.  My memory cleared, and I\nremembered all that had befallen me during the last few days.  I had\nplayed the chief part in the whole business, and I had won.  Laputa was\ndead and the treasure was mine, while Arcoll was crushing the Rising at\nhis ease.  I had only to be free again to be famous and rich.  My hopes\nhad returned, but with them came my fears.  What if I could not escape?\nI must perish miserably by degrees, shut in the heart of a hill, though\nmy friends were out for rescue.  In place of my former lethargy I was\nnow in a fever of unrest.\n\nMy first care was to explore the way I had come.  I ran down the\npassage to the chasm which the slab of stone had spanned. I had been\nright in my guess, for the thing was gone.  Laputa was in truth a\nTitan, who in the article of death could break down a bridge which\nwould have taken any three men an hour to shift.  The gorge was about\nseven yards wide, too far to risk a jump, and the cliff fell sheer and\nsmooth to the imprisoned waters two hundred feet below.  There was no\nchance of circuiting it, for the wall was as smooth as if it had been\nchiselled.  The hand of man had been at work to make the sanctuary\ninviolable.\n\nIt occurred to me that sooner or later Arcoll would track Laputa to\nthis place.  He would find the bloodstains in the gully, but the\nturnstile would be shut and he would never find the trick of it.  Nor\ncould he have any kaffirs with him who knew the secret of the Place of\nthe Snake.  Still if Arcoll knew I was inside he would find some way to\nget to me even though he had to dynamite the curtain of rock.  I\nshouted, but my voice seemed to be drowned in the roar of the water.\nIt made but a fresh chord in the wild orchestra, and I gave up hopes in\nthat direction.\n\nVery dolefully I returned to the cave.  I was about to share the\nexperience of all treasure-hunters--to be left with jewels galore and\nnot a bite to sustain life.  The thing was too commonplace to be\nendured.  I grew angry, and declined so obvious a fate.  'Ek sal 'n\nplan maak,' I told myself in the old Dutchman's words.  I had come\nthrough worse dangers, and a way I should find.  To starve in the cave\nwas no ending for David Crawfurd.  Far better to join Laputa in the\ndepths in a manly hazard for liberty.\n\nMy obstinacy and irritation cheered me.  What had become of the\nlack-lustre young fool who had mooned here a few minutes back.  Now I\nwas as tense and strung for effort as the day I had ridden from\nBlaauwildebeestefontein to Umvelos'.  I felt like a runner in the last\nlap of a race.  For four days I had lived in the midst of terror and\ndarkness.  Daylight was only a few steps ahead, daylight and youth\nrestored and a new world.\n\nThere were only two outlets from that cave--the way I had come, and the\nway the river came.  The first was closed, the second a sheer staring\nimpossibility.  I had been into every niche and cranny, and there was\nno sign of a passage.  I sat down on the floor and looked at the wall\nof water.  It fell, as I have already explained, in a solid sheet,\nwhich made up the whole of the wall of the cave.  Higher than the roof\nof the cave I could not see what happened, except that it must be the\nopen air, for the sun was shining on it.  The water was about three\nyards distant from the edge of the cave's floor, but it seemed to me\nthat high up, level with the roof, this distance decreased to little\nmore than a foot.\n\nI could not see what the walls of the cave were like, but they looked\nsmooth and difficult.  Supposing I managed to climb up to the level of\nthe roof close to the water, how on earth was I to get outside on to\nthe wall of the ravine?  I knew from my old days of rock-climbing what\na complete obstacle the overhang of a cave is.\n\nWhile I looked, however, I saw a thing which I had not noticed before.\nOn the left side of the fall the water sluiced down in a sheet to the\nextreme edge of the cave, almost sprinkling the floor with water.  But\non the right side the force of water was obviously weaker, and a little\nshort of the level of the cave roof there was a spike of rock which\nslightly broke the fall.  The spike was covered, but the covering was\nshallow, for the current flowed from it in a rose-shaped spray.  If a\nman could get to that spike and could get a foot on it without being\nswept down, it might be possible--just possible--to do something with\nthe wall of the chasm above the cave.  Of course I knew nothing about\nthe nature of that wall.  It might be as smooth as a polished pillar.\n\nThe result of these cogitations was that I decided to prospect the\nright wall of the cave close to the waterfall.  But first I went\nrummaging in the back part to see if I could find anything to assist\nme.  In one corner there was a rude cupboard with some stone and metal\nvessels.  Here, too, were the few domestic utensils of the dead Keeper.\nIn another were several locked coffers on which I could make no\nimpression.  There were the treasure-chests too, but they held nothing\nsave treasure, and gold and diamonds were no manner of use to me.\nOther odds and ends I found--spears, a few skins, and a broken and\nnotched axe.  I took the axe in case there might be cutting to do.\n\nThen at the back of a bin my hand struck something which brought the\nblood to my face.  It was a rope, an old one, but still in fair\ncondition and forty or fifty feet long.  I dragged it out into the\nlight and straightened its kinks.  With this something could be done,\nassuming I could cut my way to the level of the roof.\n\nI began the climb in my bare feet, and at the beginning it was very\nbad.  Except on the very edge of the abyss there was scarcely a\nhandhold.  Possibly in floods the waters may have swept the wall in a\ncurve, smoothing down the inner part and leaving the outer to its\nnatural roughness.  There was one place where I had to hang on by a\nvery narrow crack while I scraped with the axe a hollow for my right\nfoot.  And then about twelve feet from the ground I struck the first of\nthe iron pegs.\n\nTo this day I cannot think what these pegs were for.  They were old\nsquare-headed things which had seen the wear of centuries.  They cannot\nhave been meant to assist a climber, for the dwellers of the cave had\nclearly never contemplated this means of egress.  Perhaps they had been\nused for some kind of ceremonial curtain in a dim past.  They were\nrusty and frail, and one of them came away in my hand, but for all that\nthey marvellously assisted my ascent.\n\nI had been climbing slowly, doggedly and carefully, my mind wholly\noccupied with the task; and almost before I knew I found my head close\nunder the roof of the cave.  It was necessary now to move towards the\nriver, and the task seemed impossible.  I could see no footholds, save\ntwo frail pegs, and in the corner between the wall and the roof was a\nrough arch too wide for my body to jam itself in.  Just below the level\nof the roof--say two feet--I saw the submerged spike of rock. The\nwaters raged around it, and could not have been more than an inch deep\non the top.  If I could only get my foot on that I believed I could\navoid being swept down, and stand up and reach for the wall above the\ncave.\n\nBut how to get to it?  It was no good delaying, for my frail holds\nmight give at any moment.  In any case I would have the moral security\nof the rope, so I passed it through a fairly staunch pin close to the\nroof, which had an upward tilt that almost made a ring of it.  One end\nof the rope was round my body, the other was loose in my hand, and I\npaid it out as I moved.  Moral support is something.  Very gingerly I\ncrawled like a fly along the wall, my fingers now clutching at a tiny\nknob, now clawing at a crack which did little more than hold my nails.\nIt was all hopeless insanity, and yet somehow I did it.  The rope and\nthe nearness of the roof gave me confidence and balance. Then the holds\nceased altogether a couple of yards from the water.  I saw my spike of\nrock a trifle below me.  There was nothing for it but to risk all on a\njump.  I drew the rope out of the hitch, twined the slack round my\nwaist, and leaped for the spike.\n\nIt was like throwing oneself on a line of spears.  The solid wall of\nwater hurled me back and down, but as I fell my arms closed on the\nspike.  There I hung while my feet were towed outwards by the volume of\nthe stream as if they had been dead leaves.  I was half-stunned by the\nshock of the drip on my head, but I kept my wits, and presently got my\nface outside the falling sheet and breathed.\n\nTo get to my feet and stand on the spike while all the fury of water\nwas plucking at me was the hardest physical effort I have ever made.\nIt had to be done very circumspectly, for a slip would send me into the\nabyss.  If I moved an arm or leg an inch too near the terrible dropping\nwall I knew I should be plucked from my hold.  I got my knees on the\nouter face of the spike, so that all my body was removed as far as\npossible from the impact of the water.  Then I began to pull myself\nslowly up.\n\nI could not do it.  If I got my feet on the rock the effort would bring\nme too far into the water, and that meant destruction.  I saw this\nclearly in a second while my wrists were cracking with the strain.  But\nif I had a wall behind me I could reach back with one hand and get what\nwe call in Scotland a 'stelf.'  I knew there was a wall, but how far I\ncould not judge. The perpetual hammering of the stream had confused my\nwits.\n\nIt was a horrible moment, but I had to risk it.  I knew that if the\nwall was too far back I should fall, for I had to let my weight go till\nmy hand fell on it.  Delay would do no good, so with a prayer I flung\nmy right hand back, while my left hand clutched the spike.\n\nI found the wall--it was only a foot or two beyond my reach.  With a\nheave I had my foot on the spike, and turning, had both hands on the\nopposite wall.  There I stood, straddling like a Colossus over a waste\nof white waters, with the cave floor far below me in the gloom, and my\ndiscarded axe lying close to a splash of Laputa's blood.\n\nThe spectacle made me giddy, and I had to move on or fall. The wall was\nnot quite perpendicular, but as far as I could see a slope of about\nsixty degrees.  It was ribbed and terraced pretty fully, but I could\nsee no ledge within reach which offered standing room.  Once more I\ntried the moral support of the rope, and as well as I could dropped a\nnoose on the spike which might hold me if I fell.  Then I boldly\nembarked on a hand traverse, pulling myself along a little ledge till I\nwas right in the angle of the fall.  Here, happily, the water was\nshallower and less violent, and with my legs up to the knees in foam I\nmanaged to scramble into a kind of corner.  Now at last I was on the\nwall of the gully, and above the cave.  I had achieved by amazing luck\none of the most difficult of all mountaineering operations.  I had got\nout of a cave to the wall above.\n\nMy troubles were by no means over, for I found the cliff most difficult\nto climb.  The great rush of the stream dizzied my brain, the spray\nmade the rock damp, and the slope steepened as I advanced.  At one\noverhang my shoulder was almost in the water again.  All this time I\nwas climbing doggedly, with terror somewhere in my soul, and hope\nlighting but a feeble lamp.  I was very distrustful of my body, for I\nknew that at any moment my weakness might return.  The fever of three\ndays of peril and stress is not allayed by one night's rest.\n\nBy this time I was high enough to see that the river came out of the\nground about fifty feet short of the lip of the gully, and some ten\nfeet beyond where I stood.  Above the hole whence the waters issued was\na loose slope of slabs and screes. It looked an ugly place, but there I\nmust go, for the rock-wall I was on was getting unclimbable.\n\nI turned the corner a foot or two above the water, and stood on a slope\nof about fifty degrees, running from the parapet of stone to a line\nbeyond which blue sky appeared.  The first step I took the place began\nto move.  A boulder crashed into the fall, and tore down into the abyss\nwith a shattering thunder.  I lay flat and clutched desperately at\nevery hold, but I had loosened an avalanche of earth, and not till my\nfeet were sprayed by the water did I get a grip of firm rock and check\nmy descent.  All this frightened me horribly, with the kind of\ndespairing angry fear which I had suffered at Bruderstroom, when I\ndreamed that the treasure was lost.  I could not bear the notion of\ndeath when I had won so far.\n\nAfter that I advanced, not by steps, but by inches.  I felt more poised\nand pinnacled in the void than when I had stood on the spike of rock,\nfor I had a substantial hold neither for foot nor hand.  It seemed\nweeks before I made any progress away from the lip of the waterhole.  I\ndared not look down, but kept my eyes on the slope before me, searching\nfor any patch of ground which promised stability.  Once I found a scrog\nof juniper with firm roots, and this gave me a great lift.  A little\nfurther, however, I lit on a bank of screes which slipped with me to\nthe right, and I lost most of the ground the bush had gained me.  My\nwhole being, I remember, was filled with a devouring passion to be quit\nof this gully and all that was in it.\n\nThen, not suddenly as in romances, but after hard striving and hope\nlong deferred, I found myself on a firm outcrop of weathered stone.  In\nthree strides I was on the edge of the plateau.  Then I began to run,\nand at the same time to lose the power of running.  I cast one look\nbehind me, and saw a deep cleft of darkness out of which I had climbed.\nDown in the cave it had seemed light enough, but in the clear sunshine\nof the top the gorge looked a very pit of shade.  For the first and\nlast time in my life I had vertigo.  Fear of falling back, and a mad\ncraze to do it, made me acutely sick.  I managed to stumble a few steps\nforward on the mountain turf, and then flung myself on my face.\n\nWhen I raised my head I was amazed to find it still early morning.  The\ndew was yet on the grass, and the sun was not far up the sky.  I had\nthought that my entry into the cave, my time in it, and my escape had\ntaken many hours, whereas at the most they had occupied two.  It was\nlittle more than dawn, such a dawn as walks only on the hilltops.\nBefore me was the shallow vale with its bracken and sweet grass, and\nfarther on the shining links of the stream, and the loch still grey in\nthe shadow of the beleaguering hills.  Here was a fresh, clean land, a\nland for homesteads and orchards and children.  All of a sudden I\nrealized that at last I had come out of savagery. The burden of the\npast days slipped from my shoulders.  I felt young again, and cheerful\nand brave.  Behind me was the black night, and the horrid secrets of\ndarkness.  Before me was my own country, for that loch and that bracken\nmight have been on a Scotch moor.  The fresh scent of the air and the\nwhole morning mystery put song into my blood.  I remembered that I was\nnot yet twenty. My first care was to kneel there among the bracken and\ngive thanks to my Maker, who in very truth had shown me 'His goodness\nin the land of the living.'\n\nAfter a little I went back to the edge of the cliff.  There where the\nroad came out of the bush was the body of Henriques, lying sprawled on\nthe sand, with two dismounted riders looking hard at it.  I gave a\ngreat shout, for in the men I recognized Aitken and the schoolmaster\nWardlaw.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXII\n\nA GREAT PERIL AND A GREAT SALVATION\n\nI must now take up some of the ragged ends which I have left behind me.\nIt is not my task, as I have said, to write the history of the great\nRising.  That has been done by abler men, who were at the centre of the\nbusiness, and had some knowledge of strategy and tactics; whereas I was\nonly a raw lad who was privileged by fate to see the start.  If I\ncould, I would fain make an epic of it, and show how the Plains found\nat all points the Plateau guarded, how wits overcame numbers, and at\nevery pass which the natives tried the great guns spoke and the tide\nrolled back.  Yet I fear it would be an epic without a hero. There was\nno leader left when Laputa had gone.  There were months of guerrilla\nfighting, and then months of reprisals, when chief after chief was\nhunted down and brought to trial. Then the amnesty came and a clean\nsheet, and white Africa drew breath again with certain grave\nreflections left in her head.  On the whole I am not sorry that the\nhistory is no business of mine.  Romance died with 'the heir of John,'\nand the crusade became a sorry mutiny.  I can fancy how differently\nLaputa would have managed it all had he lived; how swift and sudden his\nplans would have been; how under him the fighting would not have been\nin the mountain glens, but far in the high-veld among the dorps and\ntownships.  With the Inkulu alive we warred against odds; with the\nInkulu dead the balance sank heavily in our favour.  I leave to others\nthe marches and strategy of the thing, and hasten to clear up the\nobscure parts in my own fortunes.\n\nArcoll received my message from Umvelos' by Colin, or rather Wardlaw\nreceived it and sent it on to the post on the Berg where the leader had\ngone.  Close on its heels came the message from Henriques by a Shangaan\nin his pay.  It must have been sent off before the Portugoose got to\nthe Rooirand, from which it would appear that he had his own men in the\nbush near the store, and that I was lucky to get off as I did. Arcoll\nmight have disregarded Henriques' news as a trap if it had come alone,\nbut my corroboration impressed and perplexed him.  He began to credit\nthe Portugoose with treachery, but he had no inclination to act on his\nmessage, since it conflicted with his plans.  He knew that Laputa must\ncome into the Berg sooner or later, and he had resolved that his\nstrategy must be to await him there.  But there was the question of my\nlife.  He had every reason to believe that I was in the greatest\ndanger, and he felt a certain responsibility for my fate.  With the few\nmen at his disposal he could not hope to hold up the great Kaffir army,\nbut there was a chance that he might by a bold stand effect my rescue.\nHenriques had told him of the vow, and had told him that Laputa would\nride in the centre of the force.  A body of men well posted at Dupree's\nDrift might split the army at the crossing, and under cover of the fire\nI might swim the river and join my friends.  Still relying on the vow,\nit might be possible for well-mounted men to evade capture.\nAccordingly he called for volunteers, and sent off one of his Kaffirs\nto warn me of his design.  He led his men in person, and of his doings\nthe reader already knows the tale. But though the crossing was flung\ninto confusion, and the rear of the army was compelled to follow the\nnortherly bank of the Letaba, there was no sign of me anywhere.  Arcoll\nsearched the river-banks, and crossed the drift to where the old Keeper\nwas lying dead.  He then concluded that I had been murdered early in\nthe march, and his Kaffir, who might have given him news of me, was\ncarried up the stream in the tide of the disorderly army.  Therefore,\nhe and his men rode back with all haste to the Berg by way of Main\nDrift, and reached Bruderstroom before Laputa had crossed the highway.\n\nMy information about Inanda's Kraal decided Arcoll's next move.  Like\nme he remembered Beyers's performance, and resolved to repeat it.  He\nhad no hope of catching Laputa, but he thought that he might hold up\nthe bulk of his force if he got guns on the ridge above the kraal.  A\nmessage had already been sent for guns, and the first to arrive got to\nBruderstroom about the hour when I was being taken by Machudi's men in\nthe kloof.  The ceremony of the purification prevented Laputa from\nkeeping a good look-out, and the result was that a way was made for the\nguns on the north-western corner of the rampart of rock.  It was the\nway which Beyers had taken, and indeed the enterprise was directed by\none of Beyers's old commandants.  All that day the work continued,\nwhile Laputa and I were travelling to Machudi's.  Then came the evening\nwhen I staggered into camp and told my news.  Arcoll, who alone knew\nhow vital Laputa was to the success of the insurrection, immediately\ndecided to suspend all other operations and devote himself to\nshepherding the leader away from his army.  How the scheme succeeded\nand what befell Laputa the reader has already been told.\n\nAitken and Wardlaw, when I descended from the cliffs, took me straight\nto Blaauwildebeestefontein.  I was like a man who is recovering from\nbad fever, cured, but weak and foolish, and it was a slow journey which\nI made to Umvelos', riding on Aitken's pony.  At Umvelos' we found a\npicket who had captured the _schimmel_ by the roadside.  That wise beast,\nwhen I turned him loose at the entrance to the cave, had trotted\nquietly back the way he had come.  At Umvelos' Aitken left me, and next\nday, with Wardlaw as companion, I rode up the glen of the Klein\nLabongo, and came in the afternoon to my old home.  The store was\nempty, for Japp some days before had gone off post-haste to\nPietersdorp; but there was Zeeta cleaning up the place as if war had\nnever been heard of.  I slept the night there, and in the morning found\nmyself so much recovered that I was eager to get away.  I wanted to see\nArcoll about many things, but mainly about the treasure in the cave.\n\nIt was an easy journey to Bruderstroom through the meadows of the\nplateau.  The farmers' commandoes had been recalled, but the ashes of\ntheir camp fires were still grey among the bracken.  I fell in with a\npolice patrol and was taken by them to a spot on the Upper Letaba, some\nmiles west of the camp, where we found Arcoll at late breakfast.  I had\nresolved to take him into my confidence, so I told him the full tale of\nmy night's adventure.  He was very severe with me, I remember, for my\ndaft-like ride, but his severity relaxed before I had done with my\nstory.\n\nThe telling brought back the scene to me, and I shivered at the picture\nof the cave with the morning breaking through the veil of water and\nLaputa in his death throes.  Arcoll did not speak for some time.\n\n'So he is dead,' he said at last, half-whispering to himself. 'Well, he\nwas a king, and died like a king.  Our job now is simple, for there is\nnone of his breed left in Africa.'\n\nThen I told him of the treasure.\n\n'It belongs to you, Davie,' he said, 'and we must see that you get it.\nThis is going to be a long war, but if we survive to the end you will\nbe a rich man.'\n\n'But in the meantime?' I asked.  'Supposing other Kaffirs hear of it,\nand come back and make a bridge over the gorge? They may be doing it\nnow.'\n\n'I'll put a guard on it,' he said, jumping up briskly.  'It's maybe not\na soldier's job, but you've saved this country, Davie, and I'm going to\nmake sure that you have your reward.'\n\n\nAfter that I went with Arcoll to Inanda's Kraal.  I am not going to\ntell the story of that performance, for it occupies no less than two\nchapters in Mr Upton's book.  He makes one or two blunders, for he\nspells my name with an 'o,' and he says we walked out of the camp on\nour perilous mission 'with faces white and set as a Crusader's.'  That\nis certainly not true, for in the first place nobody saw us go who\ncould judge how we looked, and in the second place we were both smoking\nand feeling quite cheerful.  At home they made a great fuss about it,\nand started a newspaper cry about the Victoria Cross, but the danger\nwas not so terrible after all, and in any case it was nothing to what I\nhad been through in the past week.\n\nI take credit to myself for suggesting the idea.  By this time we had\nthe army in the kraal at our mercy.  Laputa not having returned, they\nhad no plans.  It had been the original intention to start for the\nOlifants on the following day, so there was a scanty supply of food.\nBesides, there were the makings of a pretty quarrel between Umbooni and\nsome of the north-country chiefs, and I verily believe that if we had\nheld them tight there for a week they would have destroyed each other\nin faction fights.  In any case, in a little they would have grown\ndesperate and tried to rush the approaches on the north and south.\nThen we must either have used the guns on them, which would have meant\na great slaughter, or let them go to do mischief elsewhere.  Arcoll was\na merciful man who had no love for butchery; besides, he was a\nstatesman with an eye to the future of the country after the war.  But\nit was his duty to isolate Laputa's army, and at all costs, it must be\nprevented from joining any of the concentrations in the south.\n\nThen I proposed to him to do as Rhodes did in the Matoppos, and go and\ntalk to them.  By this time, I argued, the influence of Laputa must\nhave sunk, and the fervour of the purification be half-forgotten.  The\narmy had little food and no leader.  The rank and file had never been\nfanatical, and the chiefs and indunas must now be inclined to sober\nreflections. But once blood was shed the lust of blood would possess\nthem. Our only chance was to strike when their minds were perplexed and\nundecided.\n\nArcoll did all the arranging.  He had a message sent to the chiefs\ninviting them to an indaba, and presently word was brought back that an\nindaba was called for the next day at noon.  That same night we heard\nthat Umbooni and about twenty of his men had managed to evade our ring\nof scouts and got clear away to the south.  This was all to our\nadvantage, as it removed from the coming indaba the most irreconcilable\nof the chiefs.\n\nThat indaba was a queer business.  Arcoll and I left our escort at the\nfoot of a ravine, and entered the kraal by the same road as I had left\nit.  It was a very bright, hot winter's day, and try as I might, I\ncould not bring myself to think of any danger. I believed that in this\nway most temerarious deeds are done; the doer has become insensible to\ndanger, and his imagination is clouded with some engrossing purpose.\nThe first sentries received us gloomily enough, and closed behind us as\nthey had done when Machudi's men haled me thither.  Then the job became\neerie, for we had to walk across a green flat with thousands of eyes\nwatching us.  By-and-by we came to the merula tree opposite the kyas,\nand there we found a ring of chiefs, sitting with cocked rifles on\ntheir knees.\n\nWe were armed with pistols, and the first thing Arcoll did was to hand\nthem to one of the chiefs. 'We come in peace,' he said.  'We give you\nour lives.'\n\n\nThen the indaba began, Arcoll leading off.  It was a fine speech he\nmade, one of the finest I have ever listened to.  He asked them what\ntheir grievances were; he told them how mighty was the power of the\nwhite man; he promised that what was unjust should be remedied, if only\nthey would speak honestly and peacefully; he harped on their old\nlegends and songs, claiming for the king of England the right of their\nold monarchs.  It was a fine speech, and yet I saw that it did not\nconvince them.  They listened moodily, if attentively, and at the end\nthere was a blank silence.\n\nArcoll turned to me.  'For God's sake, Davie,' he said, 'talk to them\nabout Laputa.  It's our only chance.'\n\nI had never tried speaking before, and though I talked their tongue I\nhad not Arcoll's gift of it.  But I felt that a great cause was at\nstake, and I spoke up as best I could.\n\nI began by saying that Inkulu had been my friend, and that at Umvelos'\nbefore the rising he had tried to save my life.  At the mention of the\nname I saw eyes brighten.  At last the audience was hanging on my\nwords. I told them of Henriques and his treachery.  I told them frankly\nand fairly of the doings at Dupree's Drift.  I made no secret of the\npart I played.  'I was fighting for my life,' I said. 'Any man of you\nwho is a man would have done the like.'\n\nThen I told them of my last ride, and the sight I saw at the foot of\nthe Rooirand.  I drew a picture of Henriques lying dead with a broken\nneck, and the Inkulu, wounded to death, creeping into the cave.\n\nIn moments of extremity I suppose every man becomes an orator.  In that\nhour and place I discovered gifts I had never dreamed of.  Arcoll told\nme afterwards that I had spoken like a man inspired, and by a fortunate\nchance had hit upon the only way to move my hearers.  I told of that\nlast scene in the cave, when Laputa had broken down the bridge, and had\nspoken his dying words--that he was the last king in Africa, and that\nwithout him the rising was at an end.  Then I told of his leap into the\nriver, and a great sigh went up from the ranks about Me.\n\n'You see me here,' I said, 'by the grace of God.  I found a way up the\nfall and the cliffs which no man has ever travelled before or will\ntravel again.  Your king is dead.  He was a great king, as I who stand\nhere bear witness, and you will never more see his like.  His last\nwords were that the Rising was over. Respect that word, my brothers.\nWe come to you not in war but in peace, to offer a free pardon, and the\nredress of your wrongs.  If you fight you fight with the certainty of\nfailure, and against the wish of the heir of John.  I have come here at\nthe risk of my life to tell you his commands.  His spirit approves my\nmission.  Think well before you defy the mandate of the Snake, and risk\nthe vengeance of the Terrible Ones.'\n\nAfter that I knew that we had won.  The chiefs talked among themselves\nin low whispers, casting strange looks at me.  Then the greatest of\nthem advanced and laid his rifle at my feet.\n\n'We believe the word of a brave man,' he said.  'We accept the mandate\nof the Snake.'\n\nArcoll now took command.  He arranged for the disarmament bit by bit,\ncompanies of men being marched off from Inanda's Kraal to stations on\nthe plateau where their arms were collected by our troops, and food\nprovided for them.  For the full history I refer the reader to Mr\nUpton's work.  It took many days, and taxed all our resources, but by\nthe end of a week we had the whole of Laputa's army in separate\nstations, under guard, disarmed, and awaiting repatriation.\n\nThen Arcoll went south to the war which was to rage around the\nSwaziland and Zululand borders for many months, while to Aitken and\nmyself was entrusted the work of settlement.  We had inadequate troops\nat our command, and but for our prestige and the weight of Laputa's\ndead hand there might any moment have been a tragedy.  The task took\nmonths, for many of the levies came from the far north, and the job of\nfeeding troops on a long journey was difficult enough in the winter\nseason when the energies of the country were occupied with the fighting\nin the south.  Yet it was an experience for which I shall ever be\ngrateful, for it turned me from a rash boy into a serious man.  I knew\nthen the meaning of the white man's duty.  He has to take all risks,\nrecking nothing of his life or his fortunes, and well content to find\nhis reward in the fulfilment of his task.  That is the difference\nbetween white and black, the gift of responsibility, the power of being\nin a little way a king; and so long as we know this and practise it, we\nwill rule not in Africa alone but wherever there are dark men who live\nonly for the day and their own bellies.  Moreover, the work made me\npitiful and kindly.  I learned much of the untold grievances of the\nnatives, and saw something of their strange, twisted reasoning.  Before\nwe had got Laputa's army back to their kraals, with food enough to tide\nthem over the spring sowing, Aitken and I had got sounder policy in our\nheads than you will find in the towns, where men sit in offices and see\nthe world through a mist of papers.\n\nBy this time peace was at hand, and I went back to Inanda's Kraal to\nlook for Colin's grave.  It was not a difficult quest, for on the sward\nin front of the merula tree they had buried him. I found a mason in the\nIron Kranz village, and from the excellent red stone of the\nneighbourhood was hewn a square slab with an inscription.  It ran thus:\n'Here lies buried the dog Colin, who was killed in defending D.\nCrawfurd, his master. To him it was mainly due that the Kaffir Rising\nfailed.'  I leave those who have read my tale to see the justice of the\nwords.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIII\n\nMY UNCLE'S GIFT IS MANY TIMES MULTIPLIED\n\nWe got at the treasure by blowing open the turnstile.  It was easy\nenough to trace the spot in the rock where it stood, but the most\npatient search did not reveal its secret.  Accordingly we had recourse\nto dynamite, and soon laid bare the stone steps, and ascended to the\ngallery.  The chasm was bridged with planks, and Arcoll and I crossed\nalone.  The cave was as I had left it.  The bloodstains on the floor\nhad grown dark with time, but the ashes of the sacramental fire were\nstill there to remind me of the drama I had borne a part in.  When I\nlooked at the way I had escaped my brain grew dizzy at the thought of\nit.  I do not think that all the gold on earth would have driven me a\nsecond time to that awful escalade.  As for Arcoll, he could not see\nits possibility at all.\n\n'Only a madman could have done it,' he said, blinking his eyes at the\ngreen linn.  'Indeed, Davie, I think for about four days you were as\nmad as they make.  It was a fortunate thing, for your madness saved the\ncountry.'\n\nWith some labour we got the treasure down to the path, and took it\nunder a strong guard to Pietersdorp.  The Government were busy with the\nsettling up after the war, and it took many weeks to have our business\ndisposed of.  At first things looked badly for me.  The\nAttorney-General set up a claim to the whole as spoils of war, since,\nhe argued, it was the war-chest of the enemy we had conquered.  I do\nnot know how the matter would have gone on legal grounds, though I was\nadvised by my lawyers that the claim was a bad one.  But the part I had\nplayed in the whole business, more especially in the visit to Inanda's\nKraal, had made me a kind of popular hero, and the Government thought\nbetter of their first attitude.  Besides, Arcoll had great influence,\nand the whole story of my doings, which was told privately by him to\nsome of the members of the Government, disposed them to be generous.\nAccordingly they agreed to treat the contents of the cave as ordinary\ntreasure trove, of which, by the law, one half went to the discoverer\nand one half to the Crown.\n\nThis was well enough so far as the gold was concerned, but another\ndifficulty arose about the diamonds; for a large part of these had\nobviously been stolen by labourers from the mines, and the mining\npeople laid claim to them as stolen goods.  I was advised not to\ndispute this claim, and consequently we had a great sorting-out of the\nstones in the presence of the experts of the different mines.  In the\nend it turned out that identification was not an easy matter, for the\nexperts quarrelled furiously among themselves.  A compromise was at\nlast come to, and a division made; and then the diamond companies\nbehaved very handsomely, voting me a substantial sum in recognition of\nmy services in recovering their property.  What with this and with my\nhalf share of the gold and my share of the unclaimed stones, I found\nthat I had a very considerable fortune.  The whole of my stones I sold\nto De Beers, for if I had placed them on the open market I should have\nupset the delicate equipoise of diamond values.  When I came finally to\ncast up my accounts, I found that I had secured a fortune of a trifle\nover a quarter of a million pounds.\n\nThe wealth did not dazzle so much as it solemnized me.  I had no\nimpulse to spend any part of it in a riot of folly.  It had come to me\nlike fairy gold out of the void; it had been bought with men's blood,\nalmost with my own.  I wanted to get away to a quiet place and think,\nfor of late my life had been too crowded with drama, and there comes a\nsatiety of action as well as of idleness.  Above all things I wanted to\nget home. They gave me a great send-off, and sang songs, and good\nfellows shook my hand till it ached.  The papers were full of me, and\nthere was a banquet and speeches.  But I could not relish this glory as\nI ought, for I was like a boy thrown violently out of his bearings. Not\ntill I was in the train nearing Cape Town did I recover my equanimity.\nThe burden of the past seemed to slip from me suddenly as on the\nmorning when I had climbed the linn. I saw my life all lying before me;\nand already I had won success.  I thought of my return to my own\ncountry, my first sight of the grey shores of Fife, my visit to\nKirkcaple, my meeting with my mother.  I was a rich man now who could\nchoose his career, and my mother need never again want for comfort.  My\nmoney seemed pleasant to me, for if men won theirs by brains or\nindustry, I had won mine by sterner methods, for I had staked against\nit my life.  I sat alone in the railway carriage and cried with pure\nthankfulness.  These were comforting tears, for they brought me back to\nmy old common-place self.\n\nMy last memory of Africa is my meeting with Tam Dyke.  I caught sight\nof him in the streets of Cape Town, and running after him, clapped him\non the shoulder.  He stared at me as if he had seen a ghost.\n\n'Is it yourself, Davie?' he cried.  'I never looked to see you again in\nthis world.  I do nothing but read about you in the papers.  What for\ndid ye not send for me?  Here have I been knocking about inside a ship\nand you have been getting famous.  They tell me you're a millionaire,\ntoo.'\n\nI had Tam to dinner at my hotel, and later, sitting smoking on the\nterrace and watching the flying-ants among the aloes, I told him the\nbetter part of the story I have here written down.\n\n'Man, Davie,' he said at the end, 'you've had a tremendous time.  Here\nare you not eighteen months away from home, and you're going back with\na fortune.  What will you do with it?' I told him that I proposed, to\nbegin with, to finish my education at Edinburgh College.  At this he\nroared with laughter.\n\n'That's a dull ending, anyway.  It's me that should have the money, for\nI'm full of imagination.  You were aye a prosaic body, Davie.'\n\n'Maybe I am,' I said; 'but I am very sure of one thing.  If I hadn't\nbeen a prosaic body, I wouldn't be sitting here to-night.'\n\n* * *\n\nTwo years later Aitken found the diamond pipe, which he had always\nbelieved lay in the mountains.  Some of the stones in the cave, being\nunlike any ordinary African diamonds, confirmed his suspicions and set\nhim on the track.  A Kaffir tribe to the north-east of the Rooirand had\nknown of it, but they had never worked it, but only collected the\noverspill.  The closing down of one of the chief existing mines had\ncreated a shortage of diamonds in the world's markets, and once again\nthe position was the same as when Kimberley began.  Accordingly he made\na great fortune, and to-day the Aitken Proprietary Mine is one of the\nmost famous in the country.  But Aitken did more than mine diamonds,\nfor he had not forgotten the lesson we had learned together in the work\nof resettlement.  He laid down a big fund for the education and\namelioration of the native races, and the first fruit of it was the\nestablishment at Blaauwildebeestefontein itself of a great native\ntraining college.  It was no factory for making missionaries and black\nteachers, but an institution for giving the Kaffirs the kind of\ntraining which fits them to be good citizens of the state.  There you\nwill find every kind of technical workshop, and the finest experimental\nfarms, where the blacks are taught modern agriculture.  They have\nproved themselves apt pupils, and to-day you will see in the glens of\nthe Berg and in the plains Kaffir tillage which is as scientific as any\nin Africa.  They have created a huge export trade in tobacco and fruit;\nthe cotton promises well; and there is talk of a new fibre which will\ndo wonders.  Also along the river bottoms the india-rubber business is\nprospering.\n\nThere are playing-fields and baths and reading-rooms and libraries just\nas in a school at home.  In front of the great hall of the college a\nstatue stands, the figure of a black man shading his eyes with his\nhands and looking far over the plains to the Rooirand.  On the pedestal\nit is lettered 'Prester John,' but the face is the face of Laputa.  So\nthe last of the kings of Africa does not lack his monument.\n\nOf this institution Mr Wardlaw is the head.  He writes to me weekly,\nfor I am one of the governors, as well as an old friend, and from a\nrecent letter I take this passage:--\n\n'I often cast my mind back to the afternoon when you and I sat on the\nstoep of the schoolhouse, and talked of the Kaffirs and our future.  I\nhad about a dozen pupils then, and now I have nearly three thousand;\nand in place of a tin-roofed shanty and a yard, I have a whole\ncountryside.  You laughed at me for my keenness, Davie, but I've seen\nit justified.  I was never a man of war like you, and so I had to bide\nat home while you and your like were straightening out the troubles.\nBut when it was all over my job began, for I could do what you couldn't\ndo--I was the physician to heal wounds.  You mind how nervous I was\nwhen I heard the drums beat.  I hear them every evening now, for we\nhave made a rule that all the Kaffir farms on the Berg sound a kind of\ncurfew.  It reminds me of old times, and tells me that though it is\npeace nowadays we mean to keep all the manhood in them that they used\nto exercise in war.  It would do your eyes good to see the garden we\nhave made out of the Klein Labongo glen.  The place is one big orchard\nwith every kind of tropical fruit in it, and the irrigation dam is as\nfull of fish as it will hold.  Out at Umvelos' there is a\ntobacco-factory, and all round Sikitola's we have square miles of\nmealie and cotton fields.  The loch on the Rooirand is stocked with\nLochleven trout, and we have made a bridle-path up to it in a gully\neast of the one you climbed.  You ask about Machudi's.  The last time I\nwas there the place was white with sheep, for we have got the edge of\nthe plateau grazed down, and sheep can get the short bite there.  We\nhave cleaned up all the kraals, and the chiefs are members of our\ncounty council, and are as fond of hearing their own voices as an\nAberdeen bailie.  It's a queer transformation we have wrought, and when\nI sit and smoke my pipe in the evening, and look over the plains and\nthen at the big black statue you and Aitken set up, I thank the\nProvidence that has guided me so far.  I hope and trust that, in the\nBible words, \"the wilderness and the solitary place are glad for us.\"\nAt any rate it will not be my fault if they don't \"blossom as the\nrose\".  Come out and visit us soon, man, and see the work you had a\nhand in starting....'\n\nI am thinking seriously of taking Wardlaw's advice.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Prester John, by John Buchan\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK PRESTER JOHN ***\n\n***** This file should be named 611.txt or 611.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/6\/1\/611\/\n\nProduced by Jo Churcher.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http:\/\/pglaf.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":76,"split":"train"}
