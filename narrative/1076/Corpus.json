The charm of her own youth and freshness even means she looks dainty and graceful in clothes that disfigure her elders. She enjoys the adulation which her appearance guarantees, laughing and chattering with the women and teasing the men.\nShe does of course have plenty of admirers, including young Richard Lambert who worships her with protective reverence.\nSir Marmaduke who has plans to woo and win Lady Sue disguised as the exiled French Prince of Orl\u0102\u0160ans, resents this faithful espionage and lays a plot to lure young Lambert to a gaming-house in London. Richard knows that gambling is an illicit pastime and that he is breaking the law, but is compelled to take his seat at the table by his employer.\nRichard is then duped into taking part in a brawl and is summarily arrested leaving the way open for Marmaduke to carry out his cowardly deception and he soon tricks Sue into marrying him.\nSir Marmaduke persuades his widowed sister-in-law to abet him in this plot, in which she unwittingly disgraces one of her long lost sons and finds the other murdered by the villain.\nThough set in a completely different kind of background, the plot has some resemblance with the Sherlock Holmes story \"A Case of Identity\".\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg EBook of The Nest of the Sparrowhawk, by Baroness Orczy\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

The Lord love you, Master Hymn-of-Praise, and pray do you\ncall half an hour at the skittle alley 'evil ways'?\"\n\n\"Aye, evil it is to indulge our sinful bodies in such recreation as doth\nnot tend to the glorification of the Lord and the sanctification of our\nimmortal souls.\"\n\nHe who sermonized thus unctuously and with eyes fixed with stern\ndisapproval on the buxom wench before him, was a man who had passed the\nmeridian of life not altogether--it may be surmised--without having\nindulged in some recreations which had not always the sanctification of\nhis own immortal soul for their primary object. The bulk of his figure\ntestified that he was not averse to good cheer, and there was a certain\nhidden twinkle underlying the severe expression of his eyes as they\nrested on the pretty face and round figure of Mistress Charity that did\nnot necessarily tend to the glorification of the Lord.\n\nApparently, however, the admonitions of Master Hymn-of-Praise made but a\nscanty impression on the young girl's mind, for she regarded him with a\nmixture of amusement and contempt as she shrugged her plump shoulders\nand said with sudden irrelevance:\n\n\"Have you had your dinner yet, Master Busy?\"\n\n\"'Tis sinful to address a single Christian person as if he or she were\nseveral,\" retorted the man sharply. \"But I'll tell thee in confidence,\nmistress, that I have not partaken of a single drop more comforting than\ncold water the whole of to-day. Mistress de Chavasse mixed the\nsack-posset with her own hands this morning, and locked it in the\ncellar, of which she hath rigorously held the key. Ten minutes ago when\nshe placed the bowl on this table, she called my attention to the fact\nthat the delectable beverage came to within three inches of the brim.\nMeseems I shall have to seek for a less suspicious, more\nChristian-spirited household, whereon to bestow in the near future my\nfaithful services.\"\n\nHardly had Master Hymn-of-Praise finished speaking when he turned very\nsharply round and looked with renewed sternness--wholly untempered by a\ntwinkle this time--in the direction whence he thought a suppressed\ngiggle had just come to his ears. But what he saw must surely have\ncompletely reassured him; there was no suggestion of unseemly ribaldry\nabout the young lad who had been busy laying out the table with spoons\nand mugs, and was at this moment vigorously--somewhat ostentatiously,\nperhaps--polishing a carved oak chair, bending to his task in a manner\nwhich fully accounted for the high color in his cheeks.\n\nHe had long, lanky hair of a pale straw-color, a thin face and high\ncheek-bones, and was dressed--as was also Master Hymn-of-Praise Busy--in\na dark purple doublet and knee breeches, all looking very much the worse\nfor wear; the brown tags and buttons with which these garments had\noriginally been roughly adorned were conspicuous in a great many places\nby their absence, whilst all those that remained were mere skeletons of\ntheir former selves.\n\nThe plain collars and cuffs which relieved the dull color of the men's\ndoublets were of singularly coarse linen not beyond reproach as to\ncleanliness, and altogether innocent of starch; whilst the thick brown\nworsted stockings displayed many a hole through which the flesh peeped,\nand the shoes of roughly tanned leather were down at heel and worn\nthrough at the toes.\n\nUndoubtedly even in these days of more than primitive simplicity and of\nsober habiliments Master Hymn-of-Praise Busy, butler at Acol Court in\nthe county of Kent, and his henchman, Master Courage Toogood, would have\nbeen conspicuous for the shabbiness and poverty of the livery which they\nwore.\n\nThe hour was three in the afternoon. Outside a glorious July sun spread\nradiance and glow over an old-fashioned garden, over tall yew hedges,\nand fantastic forms of green birds and heads of beasts carefully cut and\ntrimmed, over clumps of late roses and rough tangles of marguerites and\npotentillas, of stiff zinnias and rich-hued snapdragons.\n\nThrough the open window came the sound of wood knocking against wood, of\nexclamations of annoyance or triumph as the game proceeded, and every\nnow and then a ripple of prolonged laughter, girlish, fresh, pure as the\nfragrant air, clear as the last notes of the cuckoo before he speaks his\nfinal farewell to summer.\n\nEvery time that echo of youth and gayety penetrated into the\noak-raftered dining-room, Master Hymn-of-Praise Busy pursed his thick\nlips in disapproval, whilst the younger man, had he dared, would no\ndoubt have gone to the window, and leaning out as far as safety would\npermit, have tried to catch a glimpse of the skittle alley and of a\nlight-colored kirtle gleaming among the trees. But as it was he caught\nthe older man's stern eyes fixed reprovingly upon him, he desisted from\nhis work of dusting and polishing, and, looking up to the heavy oak-beam\nabove him, he said with becoming fervor:\n\n\"Lord! how beautifully thou dost speak, Master Busy!\"\n\n\"Get on with thy work, Master Courage,\" retorted the other relentlessly,\n\"and mix not thine unruly talk with the wise sayings of thy betters.\"\n\n\"My work is done, Master.\"\n\n\"Go fetch the pasties then, the quality will be in directly,\" rejoined\nthe other peremptorily, throwing a scrutinizing look at the table,\nwhereon a somewhat meager collation of cherries, raspberries and\ngooseberries and a more generous bowl of sack-posset had been arranged\nby Mistress Charity and Master Courage under his own supervision.\n\n\"Doubtless, doubtless,\" here interposed the young maid somewhat\nhurriedly, desirous perhaps of distracting the grave butler's attention\nfrom the mischievous oglings of the lad as he went out of the room, \"as\nyou remark--hem--as thou remarkest, this place of service is none to the\nliking of such as ... thee ...\"\n\nShe threw him a coy glance from beneath well-grown lashes, which caused\nthe saintly man to pass his tongue over his lips, an action which of a\nsurety had not the desire for spiritual glory for its mainspring. With\ndainty hands Mistress Charity busied herself with the delicacies upon\nthe table. She adjusted a gooseberry which seemed inclined to tumble,\nheaped up the currants into more graceful pyramids. Womanlike, whilst\nher eyes apparently followed the motions of her hands they nevertheless\ntook stock of Master Hymn-of-Praise's attitude with regard to herself.\n\nShe knew that in defiance of my Lord Protector and all his Puritans she\nwas looking her best this afternoon: though her kirtle was as threadbare\nas Master Courage's breeches it was nevertheless just short enough to\ndisplay to great advantage her neatly turned ankle and well-arched foot\non which the thick stockings--well-darned--and shabby shoes sat not at\nall amiss.\n\nHer kerchief was neatly folded, white and slightly starched, her cuffs\nimmaculately and primly turned back just above her round elbow and\nshapely arm.\n\nOn the whole Mistress Charity was pleased with her own appearance. Sir\nMarmaduke de Chavasse and the mistress were seeing company this\nafternoon, and the neighboring Kentish squires who had come to play\nskittles and to drink sack-posset might easily find a less welcome sight\nthan that of the serving maid at Acol Court.\n\n\"As for myself,\" now resumed Mistress Charity, after a slight pause,\nduring which she had felt Master Busy's admiring gaze fixed persistently\nupon her, \"as for myself, I'll seek service with a lady less like to\nfind such constant fault with a hard-working maid.\"\n\nMaster Courage had just returned carrying a large dish heaped up with\ndelicious looking pasties fresh from the oven, brown and crisp with\nbutter, and ornamented with sprigs of burrage which made them appear\nexceedingly tempting.\n\nCharity took the dish from the lad and heavy as it was, she carried it\nto the table and placed it right in the very center of it. She\nrearranged the sprigs of burrage, made a fresh disposition of the\nbaskets of fruit, whilst both the men watched her open-mouthed, agape at\nso much loveliness and grace.\n\n\"And,\" she added significantly, looking with ill-concealed covetousness\nat the succulent pasties, \"where there's at least one dog or cat about\nthe place.\"\n\n\"I know not, mistress,\" said Hymn-of-Praise, \"that thou wast over-fond\nof domestic pets ... 'Tis sinful to ...\"\n\n\"La! Master Busy, you ... hem ... thou mistakest my meaning. I have no\nlove for such creatures--but without so much as a kitten about the\nhouse, prithee how am I to account to my mistress for the pasties and\n... and comfits ... not to speak of breakages.\"\n\n\"There is always Master Courage,\" suggested Hymn-of-Praise, with a\nmovement of the left eyelid which in the case of any one less saintly\nmight have been described as a sly wink.\n\n\"That there is not,\" interrupted the lad decisively; \"my stomach rebels\nagainst comfits, and sack-posset could never be laid to my door.\"\n\n\"I give thee assurance, Master Busy,\" concluded the young girl, \"that\nthe county of Kent no longer suits my constitution. 'Tis London for me,\nand thither will I go next year.\"\n\n\"'Tis a den of wickedness,\" commented Busy sententiously, \"in spite of\nmy Lord Protector, who of a truth doth turn his back on the Saints and\nhath even allowed the great George Fox and some of the Friends to\nlanguish in prison, whilst profligacy holds undisputed sway. Master\nCourage, meseems those mugs need washing a second time,\" he added, with\nsudden irrelevance. \"Take them to the kitchen, and do not let me set\neyes on thee until they shine like pieces of new silver.\"\n\nMaster Courage would have either resisted the order altogether, or at\nany rate argued the point of the cleanliness of the mugs, had he dared;\nbut the saintly man possessed on occasions a heavy hand, and he also\nwore boots which had very hard toes, and the lad realized from the\nperemptory look in the butler's eyes that this was an occasion when both\nhand and boot would serve to emphasize Master Busy's orders with\nunpleasant force if he himself were at all slow to obey.\n\nHe tried to catch Charity's eye, but was made aware once more of the\neternal truth that women are perverse and fickle creatures, for she\nwould not look at him, and seemed absorbed in the rearrangement of her\nkerchief.\n\nWith a deep sigh which should have spoken volumes to her adamantine\nheart, Courage gathered all the mugs together by their handles, and\nreluctantly marched out of the room once more.\n\nHymn-of-Praise Busy waited a moment or two until the clattering of the\npewter died away in the distance, then he edged a little closer to the\ntable whereat Mistress Charity seemed still very busy with the fruit,\nand said haltingly:\n\n\"Didst thou really wish to go, mistress ... to leave thy fond, adoring\nHymn-of-Praise ... to go, mistress? ... and to break my heart?\"\n\nCharity's dainty head--with its tiny velvet cap edged with lawn which\nhardly concealed sufficiently the wealth of her unruly brown hair--sank\nmeditatively upon her left shoulder.\n\n\"Lord, Master Busy,\" she said demurely, \"how was a poor maid to know\nthat you meant it earnestly?\"\n\n\"Meant it earnestly?\"\n\n\"Yes ... a new kirtle ... a gold ring ... flowers ... and sack-posset\nand pasties to all the guests,\" she explained. \"Is that what you mean\n... hem ... what _thou_, meanest, Master Busy?\"\n\n\"Of a surety, mistress ... and if thou wouldst allow me to ... to ...\"\n\n\"To what, Master Busy?\"\n\n\"To salute thee,\" said the saintly man, with a becoming blush, \"as the\nLord doth allow his creatures to salute one another ... with a chaste\nkiss, mistress.\"\n\nThen as she seemed to demur, he added by way of persuasion:\n\n\"I am not altogether a poor man, mistress; and there is that in my\ncoffer upstairs put by, as would please thee in the future.\"\n\n\"Nay! I was not thinking of the money, Master Busy,\" said this daughter\nof Eve, coyly, as she held a rosy cheek out in the direction of the\nrighteous man.\n\n'Tis the duty even of a veracious chronicler to draw a discreet veil\nover certain scenes full of blissful moments for those whom he portrays.\n\nThere are no data extant as to what occurred during the next few\nseconds in the old oak-beamed dining-room of Acol Court in the Island of\nThanet. Certain it is that when next we get a peep at Master\nHymn-of-Praise Busy and Mistress Charity Haggett, they are standing side\nby side, he looking somewhat shame-faced in the midst of his obvious\njoy, and she supremely unconcerned, once more absorbed in the apparently\nnever-ending adornment of the refreshment table.\n\n\"Thou'lt have no cause to regret this, mistress,\" said Busy\ncomplacently, \"we will be married this very autumn, and I have it in my\nmind--an it please the Lord--to go up to London and take secret service\nunder my Lord Protector himself.\"\n\n\"Secret service, Master Busy ... hem ... I mean Hymn-of-Praise, dear ...\nsecret service? ... What may that be?\"\n\n\"'Tis a noble business, Charity,\" he replied, \"and one highly commended\nby the Lord: the business of tracking the wicked to their lair, of\ndiscovering evil where 'tis hidden in dark places, conspiracies against\nmy Lord Protector, adherence to the cause of the banished tyrants and\n... and ... so forth.\"\n\n\"Sounds like spying to me,\" she remarked curtly.\n\n\"Spying? ... Spying, didst thou say?\" he exclaimed indignantly. \"Fie on\nthee, Charity, for the thought! Secret service under my Lord Protector\n'tis called, and a highly lucrative business too, and one for which I\nhave remarkable aptitude.\"\n\n\"Indeed?\"\n\n\"Aye! See the manner in which I find things out, mistress. This house\nnow ... thou wouldst think 'tis but an ordinary house ... eh?\"\n\nHis manner changed; the saintliness vanished from his attitude; the\nexpression of his face became sly and knowing. He came nearer to\nCharity, took hold of her wrist, whilst he raised one finger to his\nlips.\n\n\"Thou wouldst think 'tis an ordinary house ... wouldst thou not?\" he\nrepeated, sinking his voice to a whisper, murmuring right into her ear\nso that his breath blew her hair about, causing it to tickle her cheek.\n\nShe shuddered with apprehension. His manner was so mysterious.\n\n\"Yes ... yes ...\" she murmured, terrified.\n\n\"But I tell thee that there's something going on,\" he added\nsignificantly.\n\n\"La, Master Busy ... you ... you terrify me!\" she said, on the verge of\ntears. \"What could there be going on?\"\n\nMaster Busy raised both his hands and with the right began counting off\nthe fingers of the left.\n\n\"Firstly,\" he began solemnly, \"there's an heiress! secondly our\nmaster--poor as a church mouse--thirdly a young scholar--secretary, they\ncall him, though he writes no letters, and is all day absorbed in his\nstudies ... Well, mistress,\" he concluded, turning a triumphant gaze on\nher, \"tell me, prithee, what happens?\"\n\n\"What happens, Master Hymn-of-Praise? ... I do not understand. What\ndoes happen?\"\n\n\"I'll tell thee,\" he replied sententiously, \"when I have found out; but\nmark my words, mistress, there's something going on in this house ...\nHush! not a word to that young jackanapes,\" he added as a distant\nclatter of pewter mugs announced the approach of Master Courage. \"Watch\nwith me, mistress, thou'lt perceive something. And when I have found\nout, 'twill be the beginning of our fortunes.\"\n\nOnce more he placed a warning finger on his lips; once more he gave\nMistress Charity a knowing wink, and her wrist an admonitory pressure,\nthen he resumed his staid and severe manner, his saintly mien and\nsomewhat nasal tones, as from the gay outside world beyond the\nwindow-embrasure the sound of many voices, the ripple of young laughter,\nthe clink of heeled boots on the stone-flagged path, proclaimed the\narrival of the quality.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\nON A JULY AFTERNOON\n\n\nIn the meanwhile in a remote corner of the park the quality was\nassembled round the skittle-alley.\n\nImagine Sir Marmaduke de Chavasse standing there, as stiff a Roundhead\nas ever upheld my Lord Protector and his Puritanic government in this\nremote corner of the county of Kent: dour in manner, harsh-featured and\nhollow-eyed, dressed in dark doublet and breeches wholly void of tags,\nribands or buttons. His closely shorn head is flat at the back, square\nin front, his clean-shaven lips though somewhat thick are always held\ntightly pressed together. Not far from him sits on a rough wooden seat,\nMistress Amelia Editha de Chavasse, widow of Sir Marmaduke's elder\nbrother, a good-looking woman still, save for the look of discontent,\nalmost of suppressed rebellion, apparent in the perpetual dark frown\nbetween the straight brows, in the downward curve of the well-chiseled\nmouth, and in the lowering look which seems to dwell for ever in the\nhandsome dark eyes.\n\nDame Harrison, too, was there: the large and portly dowager, florid of\nface, dictatorial in manner, dressed in the supremely unbecoming style\nprevalent at the moment, when everything that was beautiful in art as\nwell as in nature was condemned as sinful and ungodly; she wore the dark\nkirtle and plain, ungainly bodice with its hard white kerchief folded\nover her ample bosom; her hair was parted down the middle and brushed\nsmoothly and flatly to her ears, where but a few curls were allowed to\nescape with well-regulated primness from beneath the horn-comb, and the\nwhole appearance of her looked almost grotesque, surmounted as it was by\nthe modish high-peaked beaver hat, a marvel of hideousness and\ndiscomfort, since the small brim afforded no protection against the sun,\nand the tall crown was a ready prey to the buffetings of the wind.\n\nMistress Fairsoul Pyncheon too, was there, the wife of the Squire of\nAshe; thin and small, a contrast to Dame Harrison in her mild and\nsomewhat fussy manner; her plain petticoat, too, was embellished with\npaniers, and in spite of the heat of the day she wore a tippet edged\nwith fur: both of which frivolous adornments had obviously stirred up\nthe wrath of her more Puritanical neighbor.\n\nThen there were the men: busy at this moment with hurling wooden balls\nalong the alley, at the further end of which a hollow-eyed scraggy\nyouth, in shirt and rough linen trousers, was employed in propping up\nagain the fallen nine-pins. Squire John Boatfield had ridden over from\nEastry, Sir Timothy Harrison had come in his aunt's coach, and young\nSquire Pyncheon with his doting mother.\n\nAnd in the midst of all these sober folk, of young men in severe\ngarments, of portly dames and frowning squires, a girlish figure,\nyoung, alert, vigorous, wearing with the charm of her own youth and\nfreshness the unbecoming attire, which disfigured her elders yet seemed\nto set off her own graceful form, her dainty bosom and pretty arms. Her\nkirtle, too, was plain, and dull in color, of a soft dovelike gray,\nwithout adornment of any kind, but round her shoulders her kerchief was\ndaintily turned, edged with delicate lace, and showing through its filmy\nfolds peeps of her own creamy skin.\n\n'Twas years later that Sir Peter Lely painted Lady Sue when she was a\ngreat lady and the friend of the Queen: she was beautiful then, in the\nfull splendor of her maturer charms, but never so beautiful as she was\non that hot July afternoon in the year of our Lord 1657, when, heated\nwith the ardor of the game, pleased undoubtedly with the adulation which\nsurrounded her on every side, she laughed and chatted with the men,\nteased the women, her cheeks aglow, her eyes bright, her brown\nhair--persistently unruly--flying in thick curls over her neck and\nshoulders.\n\n\"A remarkable talent, good Sir Marmaduke,\" Dame Harrison was saying to\nher host, as she cast a complacent eye on her nephew, who had just\nsucceeded in overthrowing three nine-pins at one stroke: \"Sir Timothy\nhath every aptitude for outdoor pursuits, and though my Lord Protector\ndeems all such recreations sinful, yet do I think they tend to the\ndevelopment of muscular energy, which later on may be placed at the\nservice of the Commonwealth.\"\n\nSir Timothy Harrison at this juncture had the misfortune of expending\nhis muscular energy in hitting Squire Boatfield violently on the shin\nwith an ill-aimed ball.\n\n\"Damn!\" ejaculated the latter, heedless of the strict fines imposed by\nmy Lord Protector on unseemly language. \"I ... verily beg the ladies'\npardon ... but ... this young jackanapes nearly broke my shin-bone.\"\n\nThere certainly had been an exclamation of horror on the part of the\nladies at Squire Boatfield's forcible expression of annoyance, Dame\nHarrison taking no pains to conceal her disapproval.\n\n\"Horrid, coarse creature, this neighbor of yours, good Sir Marmaduke,\"\nshe said with her usual air of decision. \"Meseems he is not fit company\nfor your ward.\"\n\n\"Dear Squire Boatfield,\" sighed Mistress Pyncheon, who was evidently\ndisposed to be more lenient, \"how good-humoredly he bears it! Clumsy\npeople should not be trusted in a skittle alley,\" she added in a mild\nway, which seemed to be peculiarly exasperating to Dame Harrison's\nirascible temper.\n\n\"I pray you, Sir Timothy,\" here interposed Lady Sue, trying to repress\nthe laughter which would rise to her lips, \"forgive poor Squire John.\nYou scarce can expect him to moderate his language under such\nprovocation.\"\n\n\"Oh! his insults leave me completely indifferent,\" said the young man\nwith easy unconcern, \"his calling me a jackanapes doth not of necessity\nmake me one.\"\n\n\"No!\" retorted Squire Boatfield, who was still nursing his shin-bone,\n\"maybe not, Sir Timothy, but it shows how observant I am.\"\n\n\"Oliver, pick up Lady Sue's handkerchief,\" came in mild accents from\nMistress Pyncheon.\n\n\"Quite unnecessary, good mistress,\" rejoined Dame Harrison decisively,\n\"Sir Timothy has already seen it.\"\n\nAnd while the two young men made a quick and not altogether successful\ndive for her ladyship's handkerchief, colliding vigorously with one\nanother in their endeavor to perform this act of gallantry\nsingle-handed, Lady Sue gazed down on them, with good-humored contempt,\nlaughter and mischief dancing in her eyes. She knew that she was good to\nlook at, that she was rich, and that she had the pick of the county,\naye, of the South of England, did she desire to wed. Perhaps she thought\nof this, even whilst she laughed at the antics of her bevy of courtiers,\nall anxious to win her good graces.\n\nYet even as she laughed, her face suddenly clouded over, a strange,\nwistful look came into her eyes, and her laughter was lost in a quick,\nshort sigh.\n\nA young man had just crossed the tiny rustic bridge which spanned the\nha-ha dividing the flower-garden from the uncultivated park. He walked\nrapidly through the trees, towards the skittle alley, and as he came\nnearer, the merry lightheartedness seemed suddenly to vanish from Lady\nSue's manner: the ridiculousness of the two young men at her feet,\nglaring furiously at one another whilst fighting for her handkerchief,\nseemed now to irritate her; she snatched the bit of delicate linen from\ntheir hands, and turned somewhat petulantly away.\n\n\"Shall we continue the game?\" she said curtly.\n\nThe young man, all the while that he approached, had not taken his eyes\noff Lady Sue. Twice he had stumbled against rough bits of root or branch\nwhich he had not perceived in the grass through which he walked. He had\nseen her laughing gaily, whilst Squire Boatfield used profane language,\nand smile with contemptuous merriment at the two young men at her feet;\nhe had also seen the change in her manner, the sudden wistful look, the\nquick sigh, the irritability and the petulance.\n\nBut his own grave face expressed neither disapproval at the one mood nor\nastonishment at the other. He walked somewhat like a somnambulist, with\neyes fixed--almost expressionless in the intensity of their gaze.\n\nHe was very plainly, even poorly clad, and looked a dark figure even\namongst these soberly appareled gentry. The grass beneath his feet had\ndeadened the sound of his footsteps but Sir Marmaduke had apparently\nperceived him, for he beckoned to him to approach.\n\n\"What is it, Lambert?\" he asked kindly.\n\n\"Your letter to Master Skyffington, Sir Marmaduke,\" replied the young\nman, \"will you be pleased to sign it?\"\n\n\"Will it not keep?\" said Sir Marmaduke.\n\n\"Yes, an you wish it, Sir. I fear I have intruded. I did not know you\nwere busy.\"\n\nThe young man had a harsh voice, and a strange brusqueness of manner\nwhich somehow suggested rebellion against the existing conditions of\nlife. He no longer looked at Lady Sue now, but straight at Sir\nMarmaduke, speaking the brief apology between his teeth, without opening\nhis mouth, as if the words hurt him when they passed his lips.\n\n\"You had best speak to Master Skyffington himself about the business,\"\nrejoined Sir Marmaduke, not heeding the mumbled apology, \"he will be\nhere anon.\"\n\nHe turned abruptly away, and the young man once more left to himself,\nsilently and mechanically moved again in the direction of the house.\n\n\"You will join us in a bowl of sack-posset, Master Lambert,\" said\nMistress de Chavasse, striving to be amiable.\n\n\"You are very kind,\" he said none too genially, \"in about half-an-hour\nif you will allow me. There is another letter yet to write.\"\n\nNo one had taken much notice of him. Even in these days when kingship\nand House of Lords were abolished, the sense of social inequality\nremained keen. To this coterie of avowed Republicans, young Richard\nLambert--secretary or what-not to Sir Marmaduke, a paid dependent at any\nrate--was not worth more than a curt nod of the head, a condescending\nacknowledgment of his existence at best.\n\nBut Lady Sue had not even bestowed the nod. She had not actually taken\nnotice of his presence when he came; the wistful look had vanished as\nsoon as the young man's harsh voice had broken on her ear: she did not\nlook on him now that he went.\n\nShe was busy with her game. Nathless her guardian's secretary was of no\nmore importance in the rich heiress's sight than that mute row of\nnine-pins at the end of the alley, nor was there, mayhap, in her mind\nmuch social distinction between the hollow-eyed lad who set them up\nstolidly from time to time, and the silent young student who wrote those\nletters which Sir Marmaduke had not known how to spell.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\nTHE EXILE\n\n\nBut despite outward indifference, with the brief appearance of the\nsoberly-garbed young student upon the scene and his abrupt and silent\ndeparture, all the zest seemed to have gone out of Lady Sue's mood.\n\nThe ingenuous flatteries of her little court irritated her now: she no\nlonger felt either amused or pleased by the extravagant compliments\nlavished upon her beauty and skill by portly Squire John, by Sir Timothy\nHarrison or the more diffident young Squire Pyncheon.\n\n\"Of a truth, I sometimes wish, Lady Sue, that I could find out if you\nhave any faults,\" remarked Squire Boatfield unctuously.\n\n\"Nay, Squire,\" she retorted sharply, \"pray try to praise me to my female\nfriends.\"\n\nIn vain did Mistress Pyncheon admonish her son to be more bold in his\nwooing.\n\n\"You behave like a fool, Oliver,\" she said meekly.\n\n\"But, Mother ...\"\n\n\"Go, make yourself pleasing to her ladyship.\"\n\n\"But, Mother ...\"\n\n\"I pray you, my son,\" she retorted with unusual acerbity, \"do you want a\nmillion or do you not?\"\n\n\"But, Mother ...\"\n\n\"Then go at once and get it, ere that fool Sir Timothy or the odious\nBoatfield capture it under your very nose.\"\n\n\"But, Mother ...\"\n\n\"Go! say something smart to her at once ... talk about your gray mare\n... she is over fond of horses ...\"\n\nThen as the young Squire, awkward and clumsy in his manner, more\naccustomed to the company of his own servants than to that of highborn\nladies, made sundry unfortunate attempts to enchain the attention of the\nheiress, his worthy mother turned with meek benignity to Sir Marmaduke.\n\n\"A veritable infatuation, good Sir Marmaduke,\" she said with a sigh,\n\"quite against my interests, you know. I had no thought to see the dear\nlad married so soon, nor to give up my home at the Dene yet, in favor of\na new mistress. Not but that Oliver is not a good son to his\nmother--such a good lad!--and such a good husband he would be to any\ngirl who ...\"\n\n\"A strange youth that secretary of yours, Sir Marmaduke,\" here\ninterposed Dame Harrison in her loud, dictatorial voice, breaking in on\nMistress Pyncheon's dithyrambs, \"modest he appears to be, and silent\ntoo: a paragon meseems!\"\n\nShe spoke with obvious sarcasm, casting covert glances at Lady Sue to\nsee if she heard.\n\nSir Marmaduke shrugged his shoulders.\n\n\"Lambert is very industrious,\" he said curtly.\n\n\"I thought secretaries never did anything but suck the ends of their\npens,\" suggested Mistress Pyncheon mildly.\n\n\"Sometimes they make love to their employer's daughter,\" retorted Dame\nHarrison spitefully, for Lady Sue was undoubtedly lending an ear to the\nconversation now that it had the young secretary for object. She was not\nwatching Squire Boatfield who was wielding the balls just then with\nremarkable prowess, and at this last remark from the portly old dame,\nshe turned sharply round and said with a strange little air of\nhaughtiness which somehow became her very well:\n\n\"But then you see, mistress, Master Lambert's employer doth not possess\na daughter of his own--only a ward ... mayhap that is the reason why his\nsecretary performs his duties so well in other ways.\"\n\nHer cheeks were glowing as she said this, and she looked quite defiant,\nas if challenging these disagreeable mothers and aunts of\nfortune-hunting youths to cast unpleasant aspersions on a friend whom\nshe had taken under her special protection.\n\nSir Marmaduke looked at her keenly; a deep frown settled between his\neyes at sight of her enthusiasm. His face suddenly looked older, and\nseemed more dour, more repellent than before.\n\n\"Sue hath such a romantic temperament,\" he said dryly, speaking between\nhis teeth and as if with an effort. \"Lambert's humble origin has fired\nher imagination. He has no parents and his elder brother is the\nblacksmith down at Acol; his aunt, who seems to have had charge of the\nboys ever since they were children, is just a common old woman who lives\nin the village--a strict adherent, so I am told, of this new sect, whom\nJustice Bennet of Derby hath so justly nicknamed 'Quakers.' They talk\nstrangely, these people, and believe in a mighty queer fashion. I know\nnot if Lambert be of their creed, for he does not use the 'thee' and\n'thou' when speaking as do all Quakers, so I am told; but his empty\npockets, a smattering of learning which he has picked up the Lord knows\nwhere, and a plethora of unspoken grievances, have all proved a sure\npassport to Lady Sue's sympathy.\"\n\n\"Nay, but your village of Acol seems full of queer folk, good Sir\nMarmaduke,\" said Mistress Pyncheon. \"I have heard talk among my servants\nof a mysterious prince hailed from France, who has lately made one of\nyour cottages his home.\"\n\n\"Oh! ah! yes!\" quoth Sir Marmaduke lightly, \"the interesting exile from\nthe Court of King Louis. I did not know that his fame had reached you,\nmistress.\"\n\n\"A French prince?--in this village?\" exclaimed Dame Harrison sharply,\n\"and pray, good Sir Marmaduke, where did you go a-fishing to get such a\nbite?\"\n\n\"Nay!\" replied Sir Marmaduke with a short laugh, \"I had naught to do\nwith his coming; he wandered to Acol from Dover about six months ago it\nseems, and found refuge in the Lamberts' cottage, where he has remained\never since. A queer fellow I believe. I have only seen him once or\ntwice in my fields ... in the evening, usually ...\"\n\nPerhaps there was just a curious note of irritability in Sir Marmaduke's\nvoice as he spoke of this mysterious inhabitant of the quiet village of\nAcol; certain it is that the two matchmaking old dames seemed smitten at\none and the same time with a sense of grave danger to their schemes.\n\nAn exile from France, a prince who hides his identity and his person in\na remote Kentish village, and a girl with a highly imaginative\ntemperament like Lady Sue! here was surely a more definite, a more\nimportant rival to the pretensions of homely country youths like Sir\nTimothy Harrison or Squire Pyncheon, than even the student of humble\norigin whose brother was a blacksmith, whose aunt was a Quakeress, and\nwho wandered about the park of Acol with hollow eyes fixed longingly on\nthe much-courted heiress.\n\nDame Harrison and Mistress Pyncheon both instinctively turned a\nscrutinizing gaze on her ladyship. Neither of them was perhaps\nordinarily very observant, but self-interest had made them keen, and it\nwould have been impossible not to note the strange atmosphere which\nseemed suddenly to pervade the entire personality of the young girl.\n\nThere was nothing in her face now expressive of whole-hearted\npartisanship for an absent friend, such as she had displayed when she\nfelt that young Lambert was being unjustly sneered at; rather was it a\nkind of entranced and arrested thought, as if her mind, having come in\ncontact with one all-absorbing idea, had ceased to function in any other\ndirection save that one.\n\nHer cheeks no longer glowed, they seemed pale and transparent like those\nof an ascetic; her lips were slightly parted, her eyes appeared\nunconscious of everything round her, and gazing at something enchanting\nbeyond that bank of clouds which glimmered, snow-white, through the\ntrees.\n\n\"But what in the name of common sense is a French prince doing in Acol\nvillage?\" ejaculated Dame Harrison in her most strident voice, which had\nthe effect of drawing every one's attention to herself and to Sir\nMarmaduke, whom she was thus addressing.\n\nThe men ceased playing and gathered nearer. The spell was broken. That\nstrange and mysterious look vanished from Lady Sue's face; she turned\naway from the speakers and idly plucked a few bunches of acorn from an\noverhanging oak.\n\n\"Of a truth,\" replied Sir Marmaduke, whose eyes were still steadily\nfixed on his ward, \"I know as little about the fellow, ma'am, as you do\nyourself. He was exiled from France by King Louis for political reasons,\nso he explained to the old woman Lambert, with whom he is still lodging.\nI understand that he hardly ever sleeps at the cottage, that his\nappearances there are short and fitful and that his ways are passing\nmysterious.... And that is all I know,\" he added in conclusion, with a\ncareless shrug of the shoulders.\n\n\"Quite a romance!\" remarked Mistress Pyncheon dryly.\n\n\"You should speak to him, good Sir Marmaduke,\" said Dame Harrison\ndecisively, \"you are a magistrate. 'Tis your duty to know more of this\nfellow and his antecedents.\"\n\n\"Scarcely that, ma'am,\" rejoined Sir Marmaduke, \"you understand ... I\nhave a young ward living for the nonce in my house ... she is very rich,\nand, I fear me, of a very romantic disposition ... I shall try to get\nthe man removed from hence, but until that is accomplished, I prefer to\nknow nothing about him ...\"\n\n\"How wise of you, good Sir Marmaduke!\" quoth Mistress Pyncheon with a\nsigh of content.\n\nA sentiment obviously echoed in the hearts of a good many people there\npresent.\n\n\"One knows these foreign adventurers,\" concluded Sir Marmaduke with\npleasant irony, \"with their princely crowns and forlorn causes ... half\na million of English money would no doubt regild the former and bolster\nup the latter.\"\n\nHe rose from his seat as he spoke, boldly encountering even as he did\nso, a pair of wrathful and contemptuous girlish eyes fixed steadily upon\nhim.\n\n\"Shall we go within?\" he said, addressing his guests, and returning his\nyoung ward's gaze haughtily, even commandingly; \"a cup of sack-posset\nwill be welcome after the fatigue of the game. Will you honor my poor\nhouse, mistress? and you, too, ma'am? Gentlemen, you must fight among\nyourselves for the privilege of escorting Lady Sue to the house, and if\nshe prove somewhat disdainful this beautiful summer's afternoon, I pray\nyou remember that faint heart never won fair lady, and that the citadel\nis not worth storming an it is not obdurate.\"\n\nThe suggestion of sack-posset proved vastly to the liking of the merry\ncompany. Mistress de Chavasse who had been singularly silent all the\nafternoon, walked quickly in advance of her brother-in-law's guests, no\ndoubt in order to cast a scrutinizing eye over the arrangements of the\ntable, which she had entrusted to the servants.\n\nSir Marmaduke followed at a short distance, escorting the older women,\nmaking somewhat obvious efforts to control his own irritability, and to\nimpart some sort of geniality to the proceedings.\n\nThen in a noisy group in the rear came the three men still fighting for\nthe good graces of Lady Sue, whilst she, silent, absorbed, walked\nleisurely along, paying no heed to the wrangling of her courtiers, her\nfingers tearing up with nervous impatience the delicate cups of the\nacorns, which she then threw from her with childish petulance.\n\nAnd her eyes still sought the distance beyond the boundaries of Sir\nMarmaduke's private grounds, there where cornfields and sky and sea were\nmerged by the summer haze into a glowing line of emerald and purple and\ngold.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\nGRINDING POVERTY\n\n\nIt was about an hour later. Sir Marmaduke's guests had departed, Dame\nHarrison in her rickety coach, Mistress Pyncheon in her chaise, whilst\nSquire Boatfield was riding his well-known ancient cob.\n\nEveryone had drunk sack-posset, had eaten turkey pasties, and enjoyed\nthe luscious fruit: the men had striven to be agreeable to the heiress,\nthe old ladies to be encouraging to their prot\u00c3\u00a9g\u00c3\u00a9s. Sir Marmaduke had\ntried to be equally amiable to all, whilst favoring none. He was an\nunpopular man in East Kent and he knew it, doing nothing to\ncounterbalance the unpleasing impression caused invariably by his surly\nmanner, and his sarcastic, often violent, temper.\n\nMistress Amelia Editha de Chavasse was now alone with her brother-in-law\nin the great bare hall of the Court, Lady Sue having retired to her room\nunder pretext of the vapors, and young Lambert been finally dismissed\nfrom work for the day.\n\n\"You are passing kind to the youth, Marmaduke,\" said Mistress de\nChavasse meditatively when the young man's darkly-clad figure had\ndisappeared up the stairs.\n\nShe was sitting in a high-backed chair, her head resting against the\ncarved woodwork. The folds of her simple gown hung primly round her\nwell-shaped figure. Undoubtedly she was still a very good-looking woman,\nthough past the hey-day of her youth and beauty. The half-light caused\nby the depth of the window embrasure, and the smallness of the glass\npanes through which the summer sun hardly succeeded in gaining\nadmittance, added a certain softness to her chiseled features, and to\nthe usually hard expression of her large dark eyes.\n\nShe was gazing out of the tall window, wherein the several broken panes\nwere roughly patched with scraps of paper, out into the garden and the\ndistance beyond, where the sea could be always guessed at, even when not\nseen. Sir Marmaduke had his back to the light: he was sitting astride a\nlow chair, his high-booted foot tapping the ground impatiently, his\nfingers drumming a devil's tattoo against the back of the chair.\n\n\"Lambert would starve if I did not provide for him,\" he said with a\nsneer. \"Adam, his brother, could do naught for him: he is poor as a\nchurch-mouse, poorer even than I--but nathless,\" he added with a violent\noath, \"it strikes everyone as madness that I should keep a secretary\nwhen I scarce can pay the wages of a serving maid.\"\n\n\"'Twere better you paid your servants' wages, Marmaduke,\" she retorted\nharshly, \"they were insolent to me just now. Why do you not pay the\ngirl's arrears to-day?\"\n\n\"Why do I not climb up to the moon, my dear Editha, and bring down a\nfew stars with me in my descent,\" he replied with a shrug of his broad\nshoulders. \"I have come to my last shilling.\"\n\n\"The Earl of Northallerton cannot live for ever.\"\n\n\"He hath vowed, I believe, that he would do it, if only to spite me. And\nby the time that he come to die this accursed Commonwealth will have\nabolished all titles and confiscated every estate.\"\n\n\"Hush, Marmaduke,\" she said, casting a quick, furtive look all round\nher, \"there may be spies about.\"\n\n\"Nay, I care not,\" he rejoined roughly, jumping to his feet and kicking\nthe chair aside so that it struck with a loud crash against the flagged\nfloor. \"'Tis but little good a man gets for cleaving loyally to the\nCommonwealth. The sequestrated estates of the Royalists would have been\ndistributed among the adherents of republicanism, and not held to\nbolster up a military dictatorship. Bah!\" he continued, allowing his\ntemper to overmaster him, speaking in harsh tones and with many a\nviolent oath, \"it had been wiser to embrace the Royal cause. The Lord\nProtector is sick, so 'tis said. His son Richard hath no backbone, and\nthe present tyranny is worse than the last. I cannot collect my rents; I\nhave been given neither reward nor compensation for the help I gave in\n'46. So much for their boasted gratitude and their many promises! My\nLord Protector feasts the Dutch ambassadors with music and with wine, my\nLords Ireton and Fairfax and Hutchinson and the accursed lot of canting\nPuritans flaunt it in silks and satins, whilst I go about in a ragged\ndoublet and with holes in my shoes.\"\n\n\"There's Lady Sue,\" murmured Mistress de Chavasse soothingly.\n\n\"Pshaw! the guardianship of a girl who comes of age in three months!\"\n\n\"You can get another by that time.\"\n\n\"Not I. I am not a sycophant hanging round White Hall! 'Twas sheer good\nluck and no merit of mine that got me the guardianship of Sue. Lord\nMiddlesborough, her kinsman, wanted it; the Courts would have given her\nto him, but old Noll thought him too much of a 'gentleman,' whilst I--an\nout-at-elbows country squire, was more to my Lord Protector's liking.\n'Tis the only thing he ever did for me.\"\n\nThere was intense bitterness and a harsh vein of sarcasm running through\nSir Marmaduke's talk. It was the speech of a disappointed man, who had\nhoped, and striven, and fought once; had raised longing hands towards\nbrilliant things and sighed after glory, or riches, or fame, but whose\nrestless spirit had since been tamed, crushed under the heavy weight of\nunsatisfied ambition.\n\nPoverty--grinding, unceasing, uninteresting poverty, had been Sir\nMarmaduke's relentless tormentor ever since he had reached man's estate.\nHis father, Sir Jeremy de Chavasse, had been poor before him. The\nyounger son of that Earl of Northallerton who cut such a brilliant\nfigure at the Court of Queen Elizabeth, Jeremy had married Mistress\nSpanton of Acol Court, who had brought him a few acres of land heavily\nburdened with mortgage as her dowry. They were a simple-minded,\nunostentatious couple who pinched and scraped and starved that their two\nsons might keep up the appearances of gentlemen at the Court of King\nCharles.\n\nBut both the young men seemed to have inherited from their brilliant\ngrandfather luxurious tastes and a love of gambling and of show--but\nneither his wealth nor yet his personal charm of manner. The eldest,\nRowland, however, soon disappeared from the arena of life. He married\nwhen scarce twenty years of age a girl who had been a play-actress. This\nmarriage nearly broke his doting mother's heart, and his own, too, for\nthe matter of that, for the union was a most unhappy one. Rowland de\nChavasse died very soon after, unreconciled to his father and mother,\nwho refused to see him or his family, even on his deathbed.\n\nJeremy de Chavasse's few hopes now centered on his younger son,\nMarmaduke. In order to enable the young man to remain in London, to mix\nfreely and to hold his own in that set into which family traditions had\noriginally gained him admittance, the fond mother and indulgent father\ndenied themselves the very necessities of life.\n\nMarmaduke took everything that was given him, whilst chafing at the\npaucity of his allowance. Determined to cut a figure at Court, he spent\ntwo years and most of his mother's dowry in a vain attempt to capture\nthe heart of one or the other of the rich heiresses who graced the\nentourage of Charles I.\n\nBut Nature who had given Marmaduke boundless ambition, had failed to\nbestow on him those attributes which would have helped him on towards\nits satisfaction. He was neither sufficiently prepossessing to please an\nheiress, nor sufficiently witty and brilliant to catch the royal eye or\nthe favor of his uncle, the present Earl of Northallerton. His efforts\nin the direction of advantageous matrimony had earned for him at Court\nthe nickname of \"The Sparrowhawk.\" But even these efforts had soon to be\nrelinquished for want of the wherewithal.\n\nThe doting mother no longer could supply him with a sufficiency of money\nto vie with the rich gallants at the Court, and the savings which Sir\nJeremy had been patiently accumulating with a view to freeing the Acol\nestates from mortgage went instead to rescue young Marmaduke from a\ndebtor's prison.\n\nPoor Sir Jeremy did not long survive his disappointment. Marmaduke\nreturned to Acol Court only to find his mother a broken invalid, and his\nfather dead.\n\nSince then it had been a perpetual struggle against poverty and debt, a\nbitter revolt against Fate, a burning desire to satisfy ambition which\nhad received so serious a check.\n\nWhen the great conflict broke out between King and Parliament, he threw\nhimself into it, without zest and without conviction, embracing the\ncause of the malcontents with a total lack of enthusiasm, merely out of\ndisappointment--out of hatred for the brilliant Court and circle in\nwhich he had once hoped to become a prominent figure.\n\nHe fought under Ireton, was commended as a fairly good soldier, though\ntoo rebellious to be very reliable, too self-willed to be wholly\ntrusted.\n\nEven in these days of brilliant reputations quickly made, he remained\nobscure and practically unnoticed. Advancement never came his way and\nwhilst younger men succeeded in attracting the observant eye of old\nNoll, he was superseded at every turn, passed over--anon forgotten.\n\nWhen my Lord Protector's entourage was formed, the Household organized,\nno one thought of the Sparrowhawk for any post that would have satisfied\nhis desires. Once more he cursed his own poverty. Money--the want of\nit--he felt was at the root of all his disappointments. A burning desire\nto obtain it at any cost, even that of honor, filled his entire being,\nhis mind, his soul, his thoughts, every nerve in his body. Money, and\nsocial prestige! To be somebody at Court or elsewhere, politically,\ncommercially,--he cared not. To handle money and to command attention!\n\nHe became wary, less reckless, striving to obtain by diplomatic means\nthat which he had once hoped to snatch by sheer force of personality.\nThe Court of Chancery having instituted itself sole guardian and\nadministrator of the revenues and fortunes of minors whose fathers had\nfought on the Royalist side, and were either dead or in exile, and\narrogating unto itself the power to place such minors under the\ntutelage of persons whose loyalty to the Commonwealth was undoubted, Sir\nMarmaduke bethought himself of applying for one of these official\nguardianships which were known to be very lucrative and moreover,\npractically sinecures.\n\nFate for once favored him; a half-contemptuous desire to do something\nfor this out-at-elbows Kentish squire who had certainly been a loyal\nadherent of the Commonwealth, caused my Lord Protector to favor his\napplication. The rich daughter of the Marquis of Dover was placed under\nthe guardianship of Sir Marmaduke de Chavasse with an allowance of\n\u00c2\u00a34,000 a year for her maintenance, until she came of age. A handsome\nfortune and stroke of good luck for a wise and prudent man:--a drop in\nan ocean of debts, difficulties and expensive tastes, in the case of Sir\nMarmaduke.\n\nA prolonged visit to London with a view either of gaining a foothold in\nthe new Court, or of drawing the attention of the malcontents, of Monk\nand his party, or even of the Royalists, to himself, resulted in further\ndebts, in more mortgages, more bitter disappointments.\n\nThe man himself did not please. His personality was unsympathetic; Lady\nSue's money which he now lavished right and left, bought neither\nfriendship nor confidence. He joined all the secret clubs which in\ndefiance of Cromwell's rigid laws against betting and gambling, were the\nresort of all the smart gentlemen in the town. Ill-luck at hazard and\ndice pursued him: he was a bad loser, quarrelsome and surly. His\nambition had not taught him the salutary lesson of how to make friends\nin order to attain his desires.\n\nHis second return to the ancestral home was scarcely less disastrous\nthan the first; a mortgage on his revenues as guardian of Lady Sue\nAldmarshe just saved him this time from the pursuit of his creditors,\nand this mortgage he had only obtained through false statements as to\nhis ward's age.\n\nAs he told his sister-in-law a moment ago, he was at his last gasp. He\nhad perhaps just begun to realize that he would never succeed through\nthe force of his own individuality. Therefore, money had become a still\nmore imperative necessity to him. He was past forty now. Disappointed\nambition and an ever rebellious spirit had left severe imprints on his\nface: his figure was growing heavy, his prominent lips, unadorned by a\nmustache, had an unpleasant downward droop, and lately he had even\nnoticed that the hair on the top of his head was not so thick as of\nyore.\n\nThe situation was indeed getting desperate, since Lady Sue would be of\nage in three months, when all revenues for her maintenance would cease.\n\n\"Methinks her million will go to one of those young jackanapes who hang\nabout her,\" sighed Mistress de Chavasse, with almost as much bitterness\nas Sir Marmaduke had shown.\n\nHer fortunes were in a sense bound up with those of her brother-in-law.\nHe had been most unaccountably kind to her of late, a kindness which his\nmany detractors attributed either to an infatuation for his brother's\nwidow, or to a desire to further irritate his uncle the Earl of\nNorthallerton, who--a rigid Puritan himself--hated the play-actress and\nher connection with his own family.\n\n\"Can naught be done, Marmaduke?\" she asked after a slight pause, during\nwhich she had watched anxiously the restless figure of her\nbrother-in-law as he paced up and down the narrow hall.\n\n\"Can you suggest anything, my dear Editha?\" he retorted roughly.\n\n\"Pshaw!\" she ejaculated with some impatience, \"you are not so old, but\nyou could have made yourself agreeable to the wench.\"\n\n\"You think that she would have fallen in love with her middle-aged\nguardian?\" he exclaimed with a harsh, sarcastic laugh. \"That girl? ...\nwith her head full of romantic nonsense ... and I ... in ragged doublet,\nwith a bald head, and an evil temper ... Bah!!! ... But,\" he added, with\nan unpleasant sneer, \"'tis unselfish and disinterested on your part, my\ndear Editha, even to suggest it. Sue does not like you. Her being\nmistress here would not be conducive to your comfort.\"\n\n\"Nay! 'tis no use going on in this manner any longer, Marmaduke,\" she\nsaid dejectedly. \"Pleasant times will not come my way so long as you\nhave not a shilling to give me for a new gown, and cannot afford to keep\nup my house in London.\"\n\nShe fully expected another retort from him--brutal and unbridled as was\nhis wont when money affairs were being discussed. He was not accustomed\nto curb his violence in her presence. She had been his helpmeet in many\nunavowable extravagances, in the days when he was still striving after a\nbrilliant position in town. There had been certain rumors anent a\ngambling den, whereat Mistress de Chavasse had been the presiding spirit\nand which had come under the watchful eye of my Lord Protector's spies.\n\nNow she had perforce to share her brother-in-law's poverty. At any rate\nhe provided a roof over her head. On the advent of Lady Sue Aldmarshe\ninto his bachelor establishment he called on his sister-in-law for the\npart of duenna.\n\nAt one time the fair Editha had exercised her undoubted charms over\nMarmaduke's violent nature, but latterly she had become a mere butt for\nhis outbursts of rage. But now to her astonishment, and in response to\nher petulant reproach, his fury seemed to fall away from him. He threw\nhis head back and broke out into uncontrolled, half-sarcastic, almost\ndefiant laughter.\n\n\"How blind you are, my dear Editha,\" he said with a shrug of his broad\nshoulders. \"Nay! an I mistake not, in that case there will be some\nstrange surprises for you within the next three months. I pray you try\nand curb your impatience until then, and to bear with the insolence of a\nserving wench, 'Twill serve you well, mine oath on that!\" he added\nsignificantly.\n\nThen without vouchsafing further explanations of his enigmatic\nutterances, he turned on his heel--still laughing apparently at some\npleasing thought--and walked upstairs, leaving her to meditate.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\nTHE LEGAL ASPECT\n\n\nMistress de Chavasse sat musing, in that high-backed chair, for some\nconsiderable time. Anon Sir Marmaduke once more traversed the hall,\ntaking no heed of her as he went out into the garden. She watched his\nbroad figure moving along the path and then crossing the rustic bridge\nuntil it disappeared among the trees of the park.\n\nThere was something about his attitude of awhile ago which puzzled her.\nAnd with puzzlement came an inexplicable fear: she had known Marmaduke\nin all his moods, but never in such an one as he had displayed before\nher just now. There had been a note almost of triumph in the laughter\nwith which he had greeted her last reproach. The cry of the sparrowhawk\nwhen it seizes its prey.\n\nTriumph in Sir Marmaduke filled her with dread. No one knew better than\nshe did the hopeless condition of his financial status. Debt--prison\nperhaps--was waiting for him at every turn. Yet he seemed triumphant!\nShe knew him to have reached those confines of irritability and\nrebellion against poverty which would cause him to shrink from nothing\nfor the sake of gaining money. Yet he seemed triumphant!\n\nInstinctively she shuddered as she thought of Sue. She had no cause to\nlike the girl, yet would she not wish to see her come to harm.\n\nShe did not dare avow even to herself the conviction which she had, that\nif Sir Marmaduke could gain anything by the young girl's death, he would\nnot hesitate to ... Nay! she would not even frame that thought.\nMarmaduke had been kind to her; she could but hope that temptation such\nas that, would never come his way.\n\nHymn-of-Praise Busy broke in on her meditations. His nasal tones--which\nhad a singular knack of irritating her as a rule--struck quite\npleasingly on her ear, as a welcome interruption to the conflict of her\nthoughts.\n\n\"Master Skyffington, ma'am,\" he said in his usual drawly voice, \"he is\non his way to Dover, and desired his respects, an you wish to see him.\"\n\n\"Yes! yes! I'll see Master Skyffington,\" she said with alacrity, rising\nfrom her chair, \"go apprise Sir Marmaduke, and ask Master Skyffington to\ncome within.\"\n\nShe was all agitation now, eager, excited, and herself went forward to\nmeet the quaint, little wizened figure which appeared in the doorway.\n\nMaster Skyffington, attorney-at-law, was small and thin--looked doubly\nso, in fact, in the black clothes which he wore. His eyes were blue and\nwatery, his manner peculiarly diffident. He seemed to present a\nperpetual apology to the world for his own existence therein.\n\nEven now as Mistress de Chavasse seemed really overjoyed to see him, he\nbacked his meager person out of the doorway as she approached, whereupon\nshe--impatiently--clutched his arm and dragged him forward into the\nhall.\n\n\"Sit down there, master,\" she said, speaking with obvious agitation, and\nalmost pushing the poor little man off his feet whilst dragging him to a\nchair. \"Sir Marmaduke will see you anon, but 'twas a kind thought to\ncome and bring me news.\"\n\n\"Hem! ... hem! ...\" stammered Master Skyffington, \"I ... that is ... hem\n... I left Canterbury this morning and was on my way to Dover ... hem\n... this lies on my way, ma'am ... and ...\"\n\n\"Yes! yes!\" she said impatiently, \"but you have some news, of course?\"\n\n\"News! ... news!\" he muttered apologetically, and clutching at his\ncollar, which seemed to be choking him, \"what news--er--I pray you,\nma'am?\"\n\n\"That clew?\" she insisted.\n\n\"It was very slight,\" he stammered.\n\n\"And it led to naught?\"\n\n\"Alas!\"\n\nHer eagerness vanished. She sank back into her chair and moaned.\n\n\"My last hope!\" she said dully.\n\n\"Nay! nay!\" rejoined Master Skyffington quite cheerfully, his courage\nseemingly having risen with her despair. \"We must not be despondent. The\nnoble Earl of Northallerton hath interested himself of late in the\nsearch and ...\"\n\nBut she shrugged her shoulders, whilst a short, bitter laugh escaped her\nlips:\n\n\"At last?\" she said with biting sarcasm. \"After twelve years!\"\n\n\"Nay! but remember, ma'am, that his lordship now is very ill ... and\nnigh on seventy years old.... Failing your late husband, Master\nRowland--whom the Lord hath in His keeping--your eldest son is ... hem\n... that is ... by law, ma'am, ... and with all respect due to Sir\nMarmaduke ... your eldest son is heir to the Earldom.\"\n\n\"And though his lordship hates me, he still prefers that my son should\nsucceed to his title, rather than Sir Marmaduke whom he abhors.\"\n\nBut that suggestion was altogether too much for poor Master\nSkyffington's sense of what was due to so noble a family, and to its\nexalted head.\n\n\"That is ... er ...\" he muttered in supreme discomfort, swallowing great\ngulps which rose to his throat at this rash and disrespectful speech\nfrom the ex-actress. \"Family feuds ... hem ... er ... very distressing\nof a truth ... and ... that is ...\"\n\n\"I fear me his lordship will be disappointed,\" she rejoined, quite\nheedless of the little attorney's perturbation, \"and that under these\ncircumstances Sir Marmaduke will surely succeed.\"\n\n\"I was about to remark,\" he rejoined, \"that now, with my lord's\nhelp--his wealth and influence ... now, that is, ... that he has\ninterested himself in the matter ... hem ... we might make fresh\ninquiries ... that is ... er ...\"\n\n\"It will be useless, master. I have done all that is humanly possible. I\nloved my boys dearly--and it was because of my love for them that I\nplaced them under my mother's care.... I loved them, you understand, but\nI was living in a gay world in London ... my husband was dead ... I\ncould do naught for their comfort.... I thought it would be best for\nthem ...\"\n\nIt was her turn now to speak humbly, almost apologetically, whilst her\neyes sought those of the simple little attorney, trying to read approval\nin his glance, or at any rate an absence of reproof. He was shaking his\nhead, sighing with visible embarrassment the while. In his innermost\nsoul, he could find no excuse for the frivolous mother, anxious to avoid\nthe responsibilities which the Lord Himself had put upon her: anxious to\nbe rid of her children in order that she might pursue with greater\nfreedom and ease that life of enjoyment and thoughtlessness which she\ncraved.\n\n\"My mother was a strange woman,\" continued Mistress de Chavasse\nearnestly and placing her small white hand on the black sleeve of the\nattorney, \"she cared little enough for me, and not at all for London\nand for society. She did not understand the many duties that devolve on\na woman of fashion.... And I was that in those days! ... twenty years\nago!\"\n\n\"Ah! Truly! truly!\" sighed Master Skyffington.\n\n\"Mayhap she acted according to her own lights.... After some years she\nbecame a convert to that strange new faith ... of the people who call\nthemselves 'Friends' ... who salute no one with the hat, and who talk so\nstrangely, saying: 'thee' and 'thou' even when addressing their betters.\nOne George Fox had a great hold on her. He was quite a youth then, but\nshe thought him a saint. 'Tis he, methinks, poisoned her mind against\nme, and caused her to curse me on her deathbed.\"\n\nShe gave a little shudder--of superstition, perhaps. The maternal\ncurse--she felt--was mayhap bearing fruit after all. Master\nSkyffington's watery eyes expressed gentle sympathy. His calling had\ntaught him many of the hidden secrets of human nature and of Life: he\nguessed that the time--if not already here--was nigh at hand, when this\nunfortunate woman would realize the emptiness of her life, and would\nbegin to reap the bitter harvest of the barren seeds which she had sown.\n\n\"Aye! I lay it all at the door of these 'Friends' who turned a mother's\nheart against her own daughter,\" continued Mistress de Chavasse\nvehemently. \"She never told me that she was sick, sent me neither letter\nnor message; only after her death a curt note came to me, writ in her\nhand, entrusted to one of her own co-worshipers, a canting, mouthing\ncreature, who grinned whilst I read the heartless message. My mother had\nsent her grandchildren away, so she told me in the letter, when she felt\nthat the Lord was calling her to Him. She had placed my boys--my boys,\nmaster!--in the care of a trusted 'friend' who would bring them up in\nthe fear of God, away from the influence of their mother. My boys,\nmaster, remember! ... they were to be brought up in ignorance of their\nname--of the very existence of their mother. The 'friend,' doubtless a\nfellow Quaker--had agreed to this on my mother's deathbed.\"\n\n\"Hm! 'tis passing strange, and passing sad,\" said the attorney, with\nreal sympathy now, for there was a pathetic note of acute sorrow in\nMistress de Chavasse's voice, \"but at the time ... hem ... and with\nmoney and influence ... hem ... much might have been done.\"\n\n\"Ah! believe me, master, I did what I could. I was in London then.... I\nflew to Canterbury where my mother lived.... I found her dead ... and\nthe boys gone ... none of the neighbors could tell me whither.... All\nthey knew was that a woman had been living with my mother of late and\nhad gone away, taking the boys with her.... My boys, master, and no one\ncould tell me whither they had gone! I spent what money I had, and Sir\nMarmaduke nobly bore his share in the cost of a ceaseless search, as the\nEarl of Northallerton would do nothing then to help me.\"\n\n\"Passing strange ... passing sad,\" murmured Master Skyffington, shaking\nhis head, \"but methinks I recollect ... hem ... some six years ago ... a\nquest which led to a clew ... er ... that is ... two young gentlemen\n...\"\n\n\"Impostors, master,\" she rejoined, \"aye! I have heard of many such since\nthen. At first I used to believe their stories ...\"\n\n\"At first?\" he ejaculated in amazement, \"but surely ... hem ... the\nfaces ... your own sons, ma'am ...\"\n\n\"Ah! the faces!\" she said, whilst a blush of embarrassment, even of\nshame, now suffused her pale cheeks. \"I mean ... you understand ... I\n... I had not seen my boys since they were babes in arms ... they were\nten years old when they were taken away ... but ... but it is nigh on\ntwenty-two years since I have set eyes on their faces. I would not know\nthem, if they passed me by.\"\n\nTears choked her voice. Shame had added its bitter sting to the agony of\nher sorrow. Of a truth it was a terrible epilogue of misery, following\non a life-story of frivolity and of heartlessness which Mistress de\nChavasse had almost unconsciously related to the poor ignorant country\nattorney. Desirous at all costs of retaining her freedom, she had parted\nfrom her children with a light heart, glad enough that their\ngrandmother was willing to relieve her of all responsibility. Time\nslipped by whilst she enjoyed herself, danced and flirted, gambled and\nplayed her part in that world of sport and Fashion wherein a mother's\nheart was an unnecessary commodity. Ten years are a long while in the\nlife of an old woman who lives in a remote country town, and sees Death\napproaching with slow yet certain stride; but that same decade is but as\na fleeting hour to the woman who is young and who lives for the moment.\n\nThe boys had been forgotten long ere they disappeared! Forgotten?\nperhaps not!--but their memory put away in a hidden cell of the mind\nwhere other inconvenient thoughts were stored: only to be released and\ngazed upon when other more agreeable ones had ceased to fill the brain.\n\nShe felt humbled before this simple-minded man, whom she knew she had\nshocked by the recital of her callousness. With innate gentleness of\ndisposition he tried to hide his feelings and to set aside the subject\nfor the moment.\n\n\"Sir Marmaduke was very disinterested, when he aided you in the quest,\"\nhe said meekly, glad to be able to praise one whom he felt it his duty\nto respect, \"for under present circumstances ... hem! ...\"\n\n\"I will raise no difficulties in Sir Marmaduke's way,\" she rejoined,\n\"there is no doubt in my mind that my boys are dead, else I had had news\nof them ere this.\"\n\nHe looked at her keenly--as keenly as he dared with his mild, blue\neyes. It was hard to keep in sympathy with her. Her moods seemed to\nchange as she spoke of her boys and then of Sir Marmaduke. Her last\nremark seemed to argue that her callousness with regard to her sons had\nnot entirely yielded to softer emotions yet.\n\n\"In case of my Lord Northallerton's death,\" she continued lightly, \"I\nshall not put in a claim on behalf of any son of mine.\"\n\n\"Whereupon--hem Sir Marmaduke as next-of-kin, would have the enjoyment\nof the revenues--and mayhap would have influence enough then to make\ngood his claim to the title before the House of Lords ...\"\n\nHe checked himself: looked furtively round and added:\n\n\"Provided it please God and my Lord Protector that the House of Lords\ncome back to Westminster by that time.\"\n\n\"I thank you, master,\" said Mistress de Chavasse, rising from her chair,\nintimating that this interview was now over, \"you have told me all that\nI wish to know. Let me assure you, that I will not prove ungrateful.\nYour services will be amply repaid by whomever succeeds to the title and\nrevenues of Northallerton. Did you wish to see Sir Marmaduke?\"\n\n\"I thank you, mistress, not to-day,\" replied Master Skyffington somewhat\ndryly. The lady's promises had not roused his enthusiasm. He would have\npreferred to see more definite reward for his labors, for he had worked\nfaithfully and was substantially out of pocket in this quest after the\ntwo missing young men.\n\nBut he was imbued with that deep respect for the family he had served\nall his life, which no conflict between privilege and people would ever\neradicate, and though Mistress de Chavasse's origin was of the humblest,\nshe was nevertheless herself now within the magic circle into which\nMaster Skyffington never gazed save with the deepest reverence.\n\nHe thought it quite natural that she should dismiss him with a curt and\ncondescending nod, and when she had swept majestically out of the room,\nhe made his way humbly across the hall, then by the garden door out\ntowards the tumble-down barn where he had tethered his old mare.\n\nMaster Courage helped him to mount, and he rode away in the direction of\nthe Dover Road, his head bent, his thoughts dwelling in puzzlement and\nwonder on the strange doings of those whom he still reverently called\nhis betters.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\nUNDER THE SHADOW OF THE ELMS\n\n\nHer head full of romantic nonsense! Well! perhaps that was the true\nkeynote of Sue's character; perhaps, too, it was that same romantic\ntemperament which gave such peculiar charm to her personality. It was\nnot mere beauty--of which she had a plentiful share--nor yet altogether\nher wealth which attracted so many courtiers to her feet. Men who knew\nher in those days at Acol and subsequently at Court said that Lady Sue\nwas magnetic.\n\nShe compelled attention, she commanded admiration, through that very\nromanticism of hers which caused her eyes to glow at the recital of\nvalor, or sorrow, or talent, which caused her to see beauty of thought\nand mind and character there where it lay most deeply hidden,\nthere--sometimes--where it scarce existed.\n\nThe dark figure of her guardian's secretary had attracted her attention\nfrom the moment when she first saw him moving silently about the house\nand park: the first words she spoke to him were words of sympathy. His\nlife-story--brief and simple as it had been--had interested her. He\nseemed so different from these young and old country squires who\nfrequented Acol Court. He neither wooed nor flattered her, yet seemed\nto find great joy in her company. His voice at times was harsh, his\nmanner abrupt and even rebellious, but at others it fell to infinite\ngentleness when he talked to her of Nature and the stars, both of which\nhe had studied deeply.\n\nHe never spoke of religion. That subject which was on everybody's\ntongue, together with the free use of the most sacred names, he\nrigorously avoided, also politics, and my Lord Protector's government,\nhis dictatorship and ever-growing tyranny: but he knew the name of every\nflower that grew in meadow or woodland, the note of every bird as it\ntrilled its song.\n\nThere is no doubt that but for the advent of that mysterious personality\ninto Acol village, the deep friendship which had grown in Sue's heart\nfor Richard Lambert would have warmed into a more passionate attachment.\n\nBut she was too young to reflect, too impulsive to analyze her feelings.\nThe mystery which surrounded the foreigner who lodged at the Quakeress's\ncottage had made strong appeal to her idealism.\n\nHis first introduction to her notice, in the woods beyond the park gate\non that cold January evening, with the moon gleaming weirdly through the\nbranches of the elms, his solitary figure leaning against a tree, had\nfired her imagination and set it wildly galloping after mad fantasies.\n\nHe had scarcely spoken on that first occasion, but his silence was\nstrangely impressive. She made up her mind that he was singularly\nhandsome, although she could not judge of that very clearly for he wore\na heavy mustache, and a shade over one eye; but he was tall, above the\naverage, and carried the elaborate habiliments which the Cavaliers still\naffected, with consummate grace and ease. She thought, too, that the\nthick perruque became him very well, and his muffled voice, when he\nspoke, sounded singularly sweet.\n\nSince then she had seen him constantly. At rare intervals at first, for\nmaidenly dignity forbade that she should seem eager to meet him. He was\nignorant of whom she was--oh! of that she felt quite quite sure: she\nalways wore a dark tippet round her shoulders, and a hood to cover her\nhead. He seemed pleased to see her, just to hear her voice. Obviously he\nwas lonely and in deep trouble.\n\nThen one night--it was the first balmy evening after the winter\nfrosts--the moon was singularly bright, and the hood had fallen back\nfrom her head, just as her face was tilted upwards and her eyes glowing\nwith enthusiasm. Then she knew that he had learnt to love her, not\nthrough any words which he spoke, for he was silent; his face was in\nshadow, and he did not even touch her; therefore it was not through any\nof her natural senses that she guessed his love. Yet she knew it, and\nher young heart was overfilled with happiness.\n\nThat evening when they parted he knelt at her feet and kissed the hem of\nher kirtle. After which, when she was back again in her own little room\nat Acol Court, she cried for very joy.\n\nThey did not meet very often. Once a week at most. He had vaguely\npromised to tell her, some day, of his great work for the regeneration\nof France, which he was carrying out in loneliness and exile here in\nEngland, a work far greater and more comprehensive than that which had\nsecured for England religious and political liberty; this work it was\nwhich made him a wanderer on the face of the earth and caused his\nfrequent and lengthy absences from the cottage in which he lodged.\n\nShe was quite content for the moment with these vague promises: in her\nheart she was evolving enchanting plans for the future, when she would\nbe his helpmate in this great and mysterious work.\n\nIn the meanwhile she was satisfied to live in the present, to console\nand comfort the noble exile, to lavish on him the treasures of her young\nand innocent love, to endow him in her imagination with all those mental\nand physical attributes which her romantic nature admired most.\n\nThe spring had come, clothing the weird branches of the elms with a\ntender garb of green, the anemones in the woods yielded to the bluebells\nand these to carpets of primroses and violets. The forests of Thanet\nechoed with songs of linnets and white-throats. She was happy and she\nwas in love.\n\nWith the lengthened days came some petty sorrows. He was obviously\nworried, sometimes even impatient. Their meetings became fewer and\nshorter, for the evening hours were brief. She found it difficult to\nwander out so late across the park, unperceived, and he would never\nmeet her by day-light.\n\nThis no doubt had caused him to fret. He loved her and desired her all\nhis own. Yet 'twere useless of a surety to ask Sir Marmaduke's consent\nto her marriage with her French prince. He would never give it, and\nuntil she came of age he had absolute power over her choice of a\nhusband.\n\nShe had explained this to him and he had sighed and murmured angry\nwords, then pressed her with increased passion to his heart.\n\nTo-night as she walked through the park, she was conscious--for the\nfirst time perhaps--of a certain alloy mixed with her gladness. Yet she\nloved him--oh, yes! just, just as much as ever. The halo of romance with\nwhich she had framed in his mystic personality was in no way dimmed, but\nin a sense she almost feared him, for at times his muffled voice sounded\nsingularly vehement, and his words betrayed the uncontrolled violence of\nhis nature.\n\nShe had hoped to bring him some reassuring news anent Sir Marmaduke de\nChavasse's intentions with regard to herself, but the conversation round\nthe skittle-alley, her guardian's cruel allusions to \"the foreign\nadventurer,\" had shown her how futile were such hopes.\n\nYet, there were only three months longer of this weary waiting. Surely\nhe could curb his impatience until she was of age and mistress of her\nown hand! Surely he trusted her!\n\nShe sighed as this thought crossed her mind, and nearly fell up against\na dark figure which detached itself from among the trees.\n\n\"Master Lambert!\" she said, uttering a little cry of surprise, pressing\nher hand against her heart which was palpitating with emotion. \"I had no\nthought of meeting you here.\"\n\n\"And I still less of seeing your ladyship,\" he rejoined coldly.\n\n\"How cross you are,\" she retorted with childish petulance, \"what have I\ndone that you should be so unkind?\"\n\n\"Unkind?\"\n\n\"Aye! I had meant to speak to you of this ere now--but you always avoid\nme ... you scarce will look at me ... and ... and I wished to ask you if\nI had offended you?\"\n\nThey were standing on a soft carpet of moss, overhead the gentle summer\nbreeze stirred the great branches of the elms, causing the crisp leaves\nto mutter a long-drawn hush-sh-sh in the stillness of the night. From\nfar away came the appealing call of a blackbird chased by some marauding\nowl, while on the ground close by, the creaking of tiny branches\nbetrayed the quick scurrying of a squirrel. From the remote and infinite\ndistance came the subdued roar of the sea.\n\nThe peace of the woodland, the sighing of the trees, the dark evening\nsky above, filled his heart with an aching longing for her.\n\n\"Offended me?\" he murmured, passing his hand across his forehead, for\nhis temples throbbed and his eyes were burning. \"Nay! why should you\nthink so?\"\n\n\"You are so cold, so distant now,\" she said gently. \"We were such good\nfriends when first I came here. Thanet is a strange country to me. It\nseems weird and unkind--the woods are dark and lonely, that persistent\nsound of the sea fills me with a strange kind of dread.... My home was\namong the Surrey hills you know.... It is far from here.... I cannot\nafford to lose a friend....\"\n\nShe sighed, a quaint, wistful little sigh, curiously out of place, he\nthought, in this exquisite mouth framed only for smiles.\n\n\"I have so few real friends,\" she added in a whisper, so low that he\nthought she had not spoken, and that the elms had sighed that pathetic\nphrase into his ear.\n\n\"Believe me, Lady Sue, I am neither cold nor distant,\" he said, almost\nsmiling now, for the situation appeared strange indeed, that this\nbeautiful young girl, rich, courted, surrounded by an army of\nsycophants, should be appealing to a poor dependent for friendship. \"I\nam only a little dazed ... as any man would be who had been dreaming ...\nand saw that dream vanish away....\"\n\n\"Dreaming?\"\n\n\"Yes!--we all dream sometimes you know ... and a penniless man like\nmyself, without prospects or friends is, methinks, more prone to it than\nmost.\"\n\n\"We all have dreams sometimes,\" she said, speaking very low, whilst her\neyes sought to pierce the darkness beyond the trees. \"I too ...\"\n\nShe paused abruptly, and was quite still for a moment, almost holding\nher breath, he thought, as if she were listening. But not a sound came\nto disturb the silence of the woods. Blackbird and owl had ceased their\nfight for life, the squirrel had gone to rest: the evening air was\nfilled only by the great murmur of the distant sea.\n\n\"Tell me your dream,\" she said abruptly.\n\n\"Alas! it is too foolish! ... too mad! ... too impossible....\"\n\n\"But you said once that you would be my friend and would try to cheer my\nloneliness.\"\n\n\"So I will, with all my heart, an you will permit.\"\n\n\"Yet is there no friendship without confidence,\" she retorted. \"Tell me\nyour dream.\"\n\n\"What were the use? You would only laugh ... and justly too.\"\n\n\"I should never laugh at that which made you sad,\" she said gently.\n\n\"Sad?\" he rejoined with a short laugh, which had something of his usual\nbitterness in it. \"Sad? Mayhap! Yet I hardly know. Think you that the\npoor peasant lad would be sad because he had dreamed that the fairy\nprincess whom he had seen from afar in her radiance, was sweet and\ngracious to him one midsummer's day? It was only a dream, remember: when\nhe woke she had vanished ... gone out of his sight ... hidden from him\nby a barrier of gold.... In front of this barrier stood his pride ...\nwhich perforce would have to be trampled down and crushed ere he could\nreach the princess.\"\n\nShe did not reply, only bent her sweet head, lest he should perceive the\ntears which had gathered in her eyes. All round them the wood seemed to\nhave grown darker and more dense, whilst from afar the weird voice of\nthat distant sea murmured of infinity and of the relentlessness of Fate.\n\nThey could not see one another very clearly, yet she knew that he was\ngazing at her with an intensity of love and longing in his heart which\ncaused her own to ache with sympathy; and he knew that she was crying,\nthat there was something in that seemingly brilliant and happy young\nlife, which caused the exquisite head to droop as if under a load of\nsorrow.\n\nA broken sigh escaped her lips, or was it the sighing of the wind in the\nelms?\n\nHe was smitten with remorse to think that he should have helped to make\nher cry.\n\n\"Sue--my little, beautiful Sue,\" he murmured, himself astonished at his\nown temerity in thus daring to address her. It was her grief which had\nbrought her down to his level: the instinct of chivalry, of protection,\nof friendship which had raised him up to hers.\n\n\"Will you ever forgive me?\" he said, \"I had no right to speak to you as\nI have done.... And yet ...\"\n\nHe paused and she repeated his last two words--gently, encouragingly.\n\n\"And yet ... good master?\"\n\n\"Yet at times, when I see the crowd of young, empty-headed\nfortune-seeking jackanapes, who dare to aspire to your ladyship's hand\n... I have asked myself whether perchance I had the right to remain\nsilent, whilst they poured their farrago of nonsense into your ear. I\nlove you, Sue!\"\n\n\"No! no! good master!\" she ejaculated hurriedly, while a nameless,\ninexplicable fear seemed suddenly to be holding her in its grip, as he\nuttered those few very simple words which told the old, old tale.\n\nBut those words once uttered, Richard felt that he could not now draw\nback. The jealously-guarded secret had escaped his lips, passion refused\nto be held longer in check. A torrent of emotion overmastered him. He\nforgot where he was, the darkness of the night, the lateness of the\nhour, the melancholy murmur of the wind in the trees, he forgot that she\nwas rich and he a poor dependent, he only remembered that she was\nexquisitely fair and that he--poor fool!--was mad enough to worship her.\n\nIt was very dark now, for a bank of clouds hid the glory of the evening\nsky, and he could see only the mere outline of the woman whom he so\npassionately loved, the small head with the fluttering curls fanned by\nthe wind, the graceful shoulders and arms folded primly across her\nbosom.\n\nHe put out his hand and found hers. Oh! the delight of raising it to his\nlips.\n\n\"By the heaven above us, Sue, by all my hopes of salvation I swear to\nyou that my love is pure and selfless,\" he murmured tenderly, all the\nwhile that her fragrant little hand was pressed against his lips. \"But\nfor your fortune, I had come to you long ago and said to you 'Let me\nwork for you!--My love will help me to carve a fortune for you, which it\nshall be my pride to place at your feet.'--Every nameless child, so 'tis\nsaid, may be a king's son ... and I, who have no name that I can of\nverity call mine own--no father--no kith or kindred--I would conquer a\nkingdom, Sue, if you but loved me too.\"\n\nHis voice broke in a sob. Ashamed of his outburst he tried to hide his\nconfusion from her, by sinking on one knee on that soft carpet of moss.\nFrom the little village of Acol beyond the wood, came the sound of the\nchurch bell striking the hour of nine. Sue was silent and absorbed,\nintensely sorrowful to see the grief of her friend. He was quite lost in\nthe shadows at her feet now, but she could hear the stern efforts which\nhe made to resume control over himself and his voice.\n\n\"Richard ... good Richard,\" she said soothingly, \"believe me, I am very,\nvery sorry for this.... I ... I vow I did not know.... I had no\nthought--how could I have? that you cared for me like ... like this....\nYou believe me, good master, do you not?\" she entreated. \"Say that you\nbelieve me, when I say that I would not willingly have caused you such\ngrief.\"\n\n\"I believe that you are the most sweet and pure woman in all the\nworld,\" he murmured fervently, \"and that you are as far beyond my reach\nas are the stars.\"\n\n\"Nay, nay, good master, you must not talk like that.... Truly, truly I\nam only a weak and foolish girl, and quite unworthy of your deep\ndevotion ... and you must try ... indeed, indeed you must ... to forget\nwhat happened under these trees to-night.\"\n\n\"Of that I pray you have no fear,\" he replied more calmly, as he rose\nand once more stood before her--a dark figure in the midst of the dark\nwood--immovable, almost impassive, with head bent and arms folded across\nhis chest. \"Nathless 'tis foolish for a nameless peasant even to talk of\nhis honor, yet 'tis mine honor, Lady Sue, which will ever help me to\nremember that a mountain of gold and vast estates stand between me and\nthe realization of my dream.\"\n\n\"No, no,\" she rejoined earnestly, \"it is not that only. You are my\nfriend, good Richard, and I do not wish to see you eating out your heart\nin vain and foolish regrets. What you ... what you wish could\nnever--never be. Good master, if you were rich to-morrow and I\npenniless, I could never be your wife.\"\n\n\"You mean that you could never love me?\" he asked.\n\nShe was silent. A fierce wave of jealousy--mad, insane, elemental\njealousy seemed suddenly to sweep over him.\n\n\"You love someone else?\" he demanded brusquely.\n\n\"What right have you to ask?\"\n\n\"The right of a man who would gladly die to see you happy.\"\n\nHe spoke harshly, almost brutally. Jealousy had killed all humility in\nhim. Love--proud, passionate and defiant--stood up for its just claims,\nfor its existence, its right to dominate, its desire to conquer.\n\nBut even as he thus stood before her, almost frightening her now by the\nviolence of his speech, by the latent passion in him, which no longer\nwould bear to be held in check, the bank of clouds which up to now had\nobscured the brilliance of the summer sky, finally swept away eastwards,\nrevealing the luminous firmament and the pale crescent moon which now\nglimmered coldly through the branches of the trees.\n\nA muffled sound as of someone treading cautiously the thick bed of moss,\nand the creaking of tiny twigs caused Richard Lambert to look up\nmomentarily from the form of the girl whom he so dearly loved, and to\npeer beyond her into the weirdly illumined density of the wood.\n\nNot twenty yards from where they were, a low wall divided the park\nitself from the wood beyond, which extended down to Acol village. At an\nangle of the wall there was an iron gate, also the tumble-down pavilion,\nivy-grown and desolate, with stone steps leading up to it, through the\ncracks of which weeds and moss sprouted up apace.\n\nA man had just emerged from out the thicket and was standing now to the\nfarther side of the gate looking straight at Lambert and at Sue, who\nstood in the full light of the moon. A broad-brimmed hat, such as\ncavaliers affected, cast a dark shadow over his face.\n\nIt was a mere outline only vaguely defined against the background of\ntrees, but in that outline Lambert had already recognized the mysterious\nstranger who lodged in his brother's cottage down in Acol.\n\nThe fixed intensity of the young man's gaze caused Sue to turn and to\nlook in the same direction. She saw the stranger, who encountering two\npairs of eyes fixed on him, raised his hat with a graceful flourish of\nthe arm: then, with a short ironical laugh, went his way, and was once\nmore lost in the gloom.\n\nThe girl instinctively made a movement as if to follow him, whilst a\nquickly smothered cry--half of joy and half of fear--escaped her lips.\nShe checked the movement as well as the cry, but not before Richard\nLambert had perceived both.\n\nWith the perception came the awful, overwhelming certitude.\n\n\"That adventurer!\" he exclaimed involuntarily. \"Oh my God!\"\n\nBut she looked him full in the face, and threw back her head with a\ngesture of pride and of wrath.\n\n\"Master Lambert,\" she said haughtily, \"methinks 'twere needless to\nremind you that--since I inadvertently revealed my most cherished secret\nto you--it were unworthy a man of honor to betray it to any one.\"\n\n\"My lady ... Sue,\" he said, feeling half-dazed, bruised and crushed by\nthe terrible moral blow, which he had just received, \"I ... I do not\nquite understand. Will you deign to explain?\"\n\n\"There is naught to explain,\" she retorted coldly. \"Prince Am\u00c3\u00a9d\u00c3\u00a9\nd'Orl\u00c3\u00a9ans loves me and I have plighted my troth to him.\"\n\n\"Nay! I entreat your ladyship,\" he said, feeling--knowing the while, how\nuseless it was to make an appeal against the infatuation of a hot-headed\nand impulsive girl, yet speaking with the courage which ofttimes is born\nof despair, \"I beg of you, on my knees to listen. This foreign\nadventurer ...\"\n\n\"Silence!\" she retorted proudly, and drawing back from him, for of a\ntruth he had sunk on his knees before her, \"an you desire to be my\nfriend, you must not breathe one word of slander against the man I love.\n...\"\n\nThen, as he said nothing, realizing, indeed, how futile would be any\neffort or word from him, she said, with growing enthusiasm, whilst her\nglowing eyes fixed themselves upon the gloom which had enveloped the\nmysterious apparition of her lover:\n\n\"Prince Am\u00c3\u00a9d\u00c3\u00a9 d'Orl\u00c3\u00a9ans is the grandest, most selfless patriot this\nworld hath ever known. For the sake of France, of tyrannized, oppressed\nFrance, which he adores, he has sacrificed everything! his position, his\nhome, his wealth and vast estates: he is own kinsman to King Louis, yet\nhe is exiled from his country whilst a price is set upon his head,\nbecause he cannot be mute whilst he sees tyranny and oppression grind\ndown the people of France. He could return to Paris to-day a rich and\nfree man, a prince among his kindred,--if he would but sacrifice that\nfor which he fights so bravely: the liberty of France!\"\n\n\"Sue! my adored lady,\" he entreated, \"in the name of Heaven listen to\nme.... You do believe, do you not, that I am your friend? ... I would\ngive my life for you.... I swear to you that you have been deceived and\ntricked by this adventurer, who, preying upon your romantic imagination\n...\"\n\n\"Silence, master, an you value my friendship!\" she commanded. \"I will\nnot listen to another word. Nay! you should be thankful that I deal not\nmore harshly with you--that I make allowances for your miserable\njealousy.... Oh! why did you make me say that,\" she added with one of\nthose swift changes of mood, which were so characteristic of her, and\nwith sudden contrition, for an involuntary moan had escaped his lips.\n\"In the name of Heaven, go--go now I entreat ... leave me to myself ...\nlest anger betray me into saying cruel things ... I am safe--quite safe\n... I entreat you to let me return to the house alone.\"\n\nHer voice sounded more and more broken as she spoke: sobs were evidently\nrising in her throat. He pulled himself together, feeling that it were\nunmanly to worry her now, when emotion was so obviously overmastering\nher.\n\n\"Forgive me, sweet lady,\" he said quite gently, as he rose from his\nknees. \"I said more than I had any right to say. I entreat you to\nforgive the poor, presuming peasant who hath dared to raise his eyes to\nthe fairy princess of his dreams. I pray you to try and forget all that\nhath happened to-night beneath the shadows of these elms--and only to\nremember one thing: that my life--my lonely, humble, unimportant\nlife--is yours ... to serve or help you, to worship or comfort you if\nneed be ... and that there could be no greater happiness for me than to\ngive it for your sweet sake.\"\n\nHe bowed very low, until his hand could reach the hem of her kirtle,\nwhich he then raised to his lips. She was infinitely sorry for him; all\nher anger against him had vanished.\n\nHe was very reluctant to go, for this portion of the park was some\ndistance from the house. But she had commanded and he quite understood\nthat she wished to be alone: love such as that which he felt for his\nsweet lady is ever watchful, yet ever discreet. Was it not natural that\nshe did not care to look on him after he had angered her so?\n\nShe seemed impatient too, and although her feelings towards him had\nsoftened, she repeated somewhat nervously: \"I pray you go! Good master,\nI would be alone.\"\n\nLambert hesitated a while longer, he looked all round him as if\nsuspicious of any marauders that might be lurking about. The hour was\nnot very late, and had she not commanded him to go?\n\nNor would he seem to pry on her movements. Having once made up his mind\nto obey, he did so without reserve. Having kissed the hem of her kirtle\nhe turned towards the house.\n\nHe meant to keep on the tiny footpath, which she would be bound to\ntraverse after him, when she returned. He felt sure that something would\nwarn him if she really needed his help.\n\nThe park and woodland were still: only the mournful hooting of an owl,\nthe sad sighing of the wind in the old elms broke the peaceful silence\nof this summer's night.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\nTHE STRANGER WITHIN THE GATES\n\n\nSue waited--expectant and still--until the last sound of the young man's\nfootsteps had died away in the direction of the house.\n\nThen with quick impulsive movements she ran to the gate; her hands\nsought impatiently in the dark for the primitive catch which held it to.\nA large and rusty bolt! she pulled at it--clumsily, for her hands were\ntrembling. At last the gate flew open; she was out in the woods, peering\ninto the moonlit thicket, listening for that most welcome sound, the\nfootsteps of the man she loved.\n\n\"My prince!\" she exclaimed, for already he was beside her--apparently he\nhad lain in wait for her, and now held her in his arms.\n\n\"My beautiful and gracious lady,\" he murmured in that curiously muffled\nvoice of his, which seemed to endow his strange personality with\nadditional mystery.\n\n\"You heard? ... you saw just now? ...\" she asked timidly, fearful of\nencountering his jealous wrath, that vehement temper of his which she\nhad learned to dread.\n\nStrangely enough he replied quite gently: \"Yes ... I saw ... the young\nman loves you, my beautiful Suzanne! ... and he will hate me now ...\"\n\nHe had always called her Suzanne--and her name thus spoken by him, and\nwith that quaint foreign intonation of his had always sounded infinitely\nsweet.\n\n\"But I love you with all my heart,\" she said earnestly, tenderly, her\nwhole soul--young, ardent, full of romance, going out to him with all\nthe strength of its purity and passion. \"What matter if all the world\nwere against you?\"\n\nAs a rule when they met thus on the confines of the wood, they would\nstand together by the gate, forming plans, talking of the future and of\ntheir love. Then after a while they would stroll into the park, he\nescorting her, as far as he might approach the house without being seen.\n\nShe had no thought that Richard Lambert would be on the watch. Nay! so\nwholly absorbed was she in her love for this man, once she was in his\npresence, that already--womanlike--she had forgotten the young student's\nimpassioned avowal, his jealousy, his very existence.\n\nAnd she loved these evening strolls in the great, peaceful park, at\nevening, when the birds were silent in their nests, and the great\nshadows of ivy-covered elms enveloped her and her romance. From afar a\ntiny light gleamed here and there in some of the windows of Acol Court.\n\nShe had hated the grim, bare house at first, so isolated in the midst of\nthe forests of Thanet, so like the eyrie of a bird of prey.\n\nBut now she loved the whole place; the bit of ill-kept tangled garden,\nwith its untidy lawn and weed-covered beds, in which a few standard\nrose-trees strove to find a permanent home; she loved the dark and\nmysterious park, the rusty gate, that wood with its rich carpet which\nvaried as each season came around.\n\nTo-night her lover was more gentle than had been his wont of late. They\nwalked cautiously through the park, for the moon was brilliant and\noutlined every object with startling vividness. The trees here were\nsparser. Close by was the sunk fence and the tiny rustic bridge--only a\nplank or two--which spanned it.\n\nSome thirty yards ahead of them they could see the dark figure of\nRichard Lambert walking towards the house.\n\n\"One more stroll beneath the trees, _ma mie_,\" he said lightly, \"you'll\nnot wish to encounter your ardent suitor again.\"\n\nShe loved him in this brighter mood, when he had thrown from him that\nmantle of jealousy and mistrust which of late had sat on him so ill.\n\nHe seemed to have set himself the task of pleasing her to-night--of\nmaking her forget, mayhap, the wooing of the several suitors who had\nhung round her to-day. He talked to her--always in that mysterious,\nmuffled voice, with the quaint rolling of the r's and the foreign\nintonation of the vowels--he talked to her of King Louis and his tyranny\nover the people of France: of his own political aims to which he had\nalready sacrificed fortune, position, home. Of his own brilliant past at\nthe most luxurious court the world had ever known. He fired her\nenthusiasm, delighted her imagination, enchained her soul to his: she\nwas literally swept off the prosy face of this earth and whirled into a\nrealm of romance, enchanting, intoxicating, mystic--almost divine.\n\nShe forgot fleeting time, and did not even hear the church bell over at\nAcol village striking the hour of ten.\n\nHe had to bring her back to earth, and to guide her reluctant footsteps\nagain towards the house. But she was too happy to part from him so\neasily. She forced him to escort her over the little bridge, under the\npretense of terror at the lateness of the hour. She vowed that he could\nnot be perceived from the house, since all the lights were out, and\neveryone indeed must be abed. Her guardian's windows, moreover, gave on\nthe other side of the house; and he of a surety would not be moon or\nstar gazing at this hour of the night.\n\nHer mood was somewhat reckless. The talk with which he had filled her\nears had gone to her brain like wine. She felt intoxicated with the\natmosphere of mystery, of selfless patriotism, of great and fallen\nfortunes, with which he knew so well how to surround himself. Mayhap,\nthat in her innermost heart now there was a scarce conscious desire to\nprecipitate a crisis, to challenge discovery, to step boldly before her\nguardian, avowing her love, demanding the right to satisfy it.\n\nShe refused to bid him adieu save at the garden door. Three steps led\nup straight into the dining-room from the flagged pathway which skirted\nthe house. She ran up these steps, silently and swiftly as a little\nmouse, and then turned her proud and happy face to him.\n\n\"Good-night, sweet prince,\" she whispered, extending her delicate hand\nto him.\n\nShe stood in the full light of the moon dominating him from the top of\nthe steps, an exquisite vision of youth and beauty and romance.\n\nHe took off his broad-brimmed hat, but his face was still in shadow, for\nthe heavy perruque fell in thick dark curls covering both his cheeks. He\nbent very low and kissed the tips of her fingers.\n\n\"When shall we meet again, my prince?\" she asked.\n\n\"This day week, an it please you, my queen,\" he murmured.\n\nAnd then he turned to go. She meant to stand there and watch him cross\nthe tangled lawn, and the little bridge, and to see him lose himself\namidst the great shadows of the park.\n\nBut he had scarce gone a couple of steps when a voice, issuing from the\ndoorway close behind her, caused her to turn in quick alarm.\n\n\"Sue! in the name of Heaven! what doth your ladyship here and at this\nhour?\"\n\nThe crisis which the young girl had almost challenged, had indeed\narrived. Mistress de Chavasse--carrying a lighted and guttering candle,\nwas standing close behind her. At the sound of her voice and Sue's\nlittle cry of astonishment rather than fear, Prince Am\u00c3\u00a9d\u00c3\u00a9 d'Orl\u00c3\u00a9ans too,\nhad paused, with a muttered curse on his lips, his foot angrily tapping\nthe flagstones.\n\nBut it were unworthy a gallant gentleman of the most chivalrous Court in\nthe world to beat a retreat when his mistress was in danger of an\nunpleasant quarter of an hour.\n\nSue was more than a little inclined to be defiant.\n\n\"Mistress de Chavasse,\" she said quietly, \"will you be good enough to\nexplain by what right you have spied on me to-night? Hath my guardian\nperchance set you to dog my footsteps?\"\n\n\"There was no thought in my mind of spying on your ladyship,\" rejoined\nMistress de Chavasse coldly. \"I was troubled in my sleep and came\ndownstairs because I heard a noise, and feared those midnight marauders\nof which we have heard so much of late. I myself had locked this door,\nand was surprised to find it unlatched. I opened it and saw you standing\nthere.\"\n\n\"Then we'll all to bed, fair mistress,\" rejoined Sue gayly. She was too\nhappy, too sure of herself and of her lover to view this sudden\ndiscovery of her secret with either annoyance or alarm. She would be\nfree in three months, and he would be faithful to her. Love proverbially\nlaughs at bars and bolts, and even if her stern guardian, apprised of\nher evening wanderings, prevented her from seeing her prince for the\nnext three months, pshaw! a hundred days at most, and nothing could keep\nher from his side.\n\n\"Good-night, fair prince,\" she repeated tenderly, extending her hand\ntowards her lover once more, while throwing a look of proud defiance to\nMistress de Chavasse. He could not help but return to the foot of the\nsteps; any pusillanimity on his part at this juncture, any reluctance to\nmeet Editha face to face or to bear the brunt of her reproaches and of\nher sneers, might jeopardize the romance of his personality in the eyes\nof Sue. Therefore he boldly took her hand and kissed it with mute\nfervor.\n\nShe gave a happy little laugh and added pertly:\n\n\"Good-night, mistress ... I'll leave you to make your own adieux to\nMonseigneur le Prince d'Orl\u00c3\u00a9ans. I'll warrant that you and he--despite\nthe lateness of the hour--will have much to say to one another.\"\n\nAnd without waiting to watch the issue of her suggestion, her eyes\ndancing with mischief, she turned and ran singing and laughing into the\nhouse.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\nPRINCE AM\u00c3\u0089D\u00c3\u0089 D'ORL\u00c3\u0089ANS\n\n\nAt first it seemed as if the stranger meant to beat a precipitate and\nnone too dignified retreat now that the adoring eyes of Lady Sue were no\nlonger upon him. But Mistress de Chavasse had no intention of allowing\nhim to extricate himself quite so easily from an unpleasant position.\n\n\"One moment, master,\" she said loudly and peremptorily. \"Prince or\nwhatever you may wish to call yourself ... ere you show me a clean pair\nof heels, I pray you to explain your presence here on Sir Marmaduke's\ndoorstep at ten o'clock at night, and in company with his ward.\"\n\nFor a moment--a second or two only--the stranger appeared to hesitate.\nHe paused with one foot still on the lowest of the stone steps, the\nother on the flagged path, his head bent, his hand upraised in the act\nof re-adjusting his broad-brimmed hat.\n\nThen a sudden thought seemed to strike him, he threw back his head, gave\na short laugh as if he were pleased with this new thought, then turned,\nmeeting Mistress de Chavasse's stern gaze squarely and fully. He threw\nhis hat down upon the steps and crossed his arms over his chest.\n\n\"One moment, mistress?\" he said with an ironical bow. \"I do not need\none moment. I have already explained.\"\n\n\"Explained? how?\" she retorted, \"nay! I'll not be trifled with, master,\nand methinks you will find that Sir Marmaduke de Chavasse will expect\nsome explanation--which will prove unpleasant to yourself--for your\nunwarrantable impudence in daring to approach his ward.\"\n\nHe put up his hand in gentle deprecation.\n\n\"Impudence? Oh, mistress?\" he said reproachfully.\n\n\"Let me assure you, master,\" she continued with relentless severity,\n\"that you were wise an you returned straightway to your lodgings now ...\npacked your worldly goods and betook yourself and them to anywhere you\nplease.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" he sighed gently, \"that is impossible.\"\n\n\"You would dare? ...\" she retorted.\n\n\"I would dare remain there, where my humble presence is most\ndesired--beside the gracious lady who honors me with her love.\"\n\n\"You are insolent, master ... and Sir Marmaduke ...\"\n\n\"Oh!\" he rejoined lightly, \"Sir Marmaduke doth not object.\"\n\n\"There, I fear me, you are in error, master! and in his name I now\nforbid you ever to attempt to speak to Lady Susannah Aldmarshe again.\"\n\nThis command, accompanied by a look of withering scorn, seemed to afford\nthe stranger vast entertainment. He made the wrathful lady a low,\nironical bow, and clapped his hands together laughing and exclaiming:\n\n\"Brava! brava! of a truth but this is excellent! Pray, mistress, will\nyou deign to tell me if in this your bidding you have asked Sir\nMarmaduke for his opinion?\"\n\n\"I need not to ask him. I ask you to go.\"\n\n\"Go? Whither?\" he asked blandly.\n\n\"Out of my sight and off these grounds at once, ere I rouse the servants\nand have you whipped off like a dog!\" she said, angered beyond measure\nat his audacity, his irony, his manner, suggestive of insolent triumph.\nHis muffled voice with its curious foreign accent irritated her, as did\nthe shadow of his perruque over his brow, and the black silk shade which\nhe wore over one eye.\n\nEven now in response to her violent outburst he broke into renewed\nlaughter.\n\n\"Better and better! Ah, mistress,\" he said with a shake of the head, \"of\na truth you are more blind than I thought.\"\n\n\"You are more insolent, master, than I had thought possible.\"\n\n\"Yet meseems, fair lady, that in the lonely and mysterious stranger you\nmight have remembered your humble and devoted servant,\" he said, drawing\nhis figure up towards her.\n\n\"You! an old friend!\" she said contemptuously. \"I have ne'er set eyes on\nyou in my life before.\"\n\n\"To think that the moon should be so treacherous,\" he rejoined\nimperturbably. \"Will you not look a little closer, fair mistress, the\nshadows are somewhat dark, mayhap.\"\n\nShe felt his one eye fixed upon her with cold intentness, a strange\nfeeling of superstitious dread suddenly crept over her from head to\nfoot. Like a bird fascinated by a snake she came a little nearer, down\nthe steps, towards him, her eyes, too, riveted on his face, that curious\nface of his, surrounded by the heavy perruque hiding ears and cheeks,\nthe mouth overshadowed by the dark mustache, one eye concealed beneath\nthe black silk shade.\n\nHe seemed amused at her terror and as she came nearer to him, he too,\nadvanced a little until their eyes met--his, mocking, amused, restless;\nhers, intent and searching.\n\nThus they gazed at one another for a few seconds, whilst silence reigned\naround and the moon peered down cold and chaste from above, illumining\nthe old house, the neglected garden, the vast park with its innumerable\ndark secrets and the mysteries which it hid.\n\nShe was the first to step back, to recoil before the ironical intensity\nof that fixed gaze. She felt as if she were in a dream, as if a\nnightmare assailed her, which in her wakeful hours would be dissipated\nby reason, by common sense, by sound and sober fact.\n\nShe even passed her hand across her eyes as if to sweep away from before\nher vision, a certain image which fancy had conjured up.\n\nHis laugh--strident and mocking--roused her from this dreamlike state.\n\n\"I ... I ... do not understand,\" she murmured.\n\n\"Yet it is so simple,\" he replied, \"did you not ask me awhile ago if\nnothing could be done?\"\n\n\"Who ... who are you?\" she whispered, and then repeated once again: \"Who\nare you?\"\n\n\"I am His Royal Highness, Prince Am\u00c3\u00a9d\u00c3\u00a9 d'Orl\u00c3\u00a9ans,\" said Sir Marmaduke de\nChavasse lightly, \"the kinsman of His Majesty, King Louis of France, the\nmysterious foreigner who works for the religious and political freedom\nof his country, and on whose head _le roi soleil_ hath set a price ...\nand who, moreover, hath enflamed the romantic imagination of a beautiful\nyoung girl, thus winning her ardent love in the present and in the near\nfuture together with her vast fortune and estates.\"\n\nHe made a movement as if to remove his perruque but she stopped him with\na gesture. She had understood. And in the brilliant moonlight a complete\nrevelation of his personality might prove dangerous. Lady Sue herself\nmight still--for aught they knew--be standing in the dark room\nbehind--unseen yet on the watch.\n\nHe seemed vastly amused at her terror, and boldly took the hand with\nwhich she had arrested his act of total revelation.\n\n\"Nay! do you recognize your humble servant at last, fair Editha?\" he\nqueried. \"On my honor, madam, Lady Sue is deeply enamored of me. What\nthink you of my chances now?\"\n\n\"You? You?\" she repeated at intervals, mechanically, dazed still, lost\nin a whirl of conflicting emotions wherein fear, amazement, and a\ncertain vein of superstitious horror fought a hard battle in her dizzy\nbrain.\n\n\"The risks,\" she murmured more coherently.\n\n\"Bah!\"\n\n\"If she discover you, before ... before ...\"\n\n\"Before she is legally my wife? Pshaw! ... Then of a truth my scheme\nwill come to naught ... But will you not own, Editha, that 'tis worth\nthe risk?\"\n\n\"Afterwards?\" she asked, \"afterwards?\"\n\n\"Afterwards, mistress,\" he rejoined enigmatically, \"afterwards sits on\nthe knees of the gods.\"\n\nAnd with a flourish of his broad-brimmed hat he turned on his heel and\nanon was lost in the shadows of the tall yew hedge.\n\nHow long she stood there watching that spot whereon he had been\nstanding, she could not say. Presently she shivered; the night had\nturned cold. She heard the cry of some small bird attacked by a midnight\nprowler; was it the sparrow-hawk after its prey?\n\nFrom the other side of the house came the sound of slow and firm\nfootsteps, then the opening and shutting of a door.\n\nSir Marmaduke de Chavasse had played his part for to-night: silently as\nhe had gone, so he returned to his room, whilst in another corner of the\nsparrow-hawk's nest a young girl slept, dreaming dreams of patriots and\nheroes, of causes nobly won, of poverty and obscurity gloriously\nendured.\n\nMistress de Chavasse with a sigh half of regret, half of indifference,\nfinally turned her back on the moonlit garden and went within.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\nSECRET SERVICE\n\n\nMaster Hymn-of-Praise Busy was excessively perturbed. Matters at the\nCourt were taking a curious turn. That something of unusual moment had\nhappened within the last few days he was thoroughly convinced, and still\nhaving it in his mind that he was especially qualified for the lucrative\nappointments in my Lord Protector's secret service--he thought this an\nexcellent opportunity for perfecting himself in the art of\ninvestigation, shrewdly conducted, which he understood to be most\nessential for the due fulfillment of such appointments.\n\nThus we see him some few days later on a late afternoon, with back bent\nnearly double, eyes fixed steadily on the ground and his face a perfect\nmirror of thoughtful concentration within, slowly walking along the tiny\nfootpath which wound in and out the groups of majestic elms in the park.\n\nMusing and meditating, at times uttering strange and enigmatical\nexclamations, he reached the confines of the private grounds, the spot\nwhere the surrounding wall gave place to a low iron gate, where the\ndisused pavilion stood out gray and forlorn-looking in the midst of the\nsoft green of the trees, and where through the woods beyond the gate,\ncould just be perceived the tiny light which issued from the\nblacksmith's cottage, the most outlying one in the village of Acol.\n\nMaster Hymn-of-Praise leaned thoughtfully against the ivy-covered wall.\nHis eyes, roaming, searching, restless, pried all around him.\n\n\"Footprints!\" he mused, \"footprints which of a surety must mean that\nhuman foot hath lately trod this moss. Footprints moreover, which lead\nup the steps to the door of that pavilion, wherein to my certain\nknowledge, no one hath had access of late.\"\n\nSomething, of course, was going on at Acol Court, that strange and\ninexplicable something which he had tried to convey by covert suggestion\nto Mistress Charity's female--therefore inferior--brain.\n\nSir Marmaduke's temper was more sour and ill even than of yore, and\nthere was still an unpleasant sensation in the lumbar regions of Master\nBusy's spine, whenever he sat down, which recalled a somewhat vigorous\noutburst of his master's ill-humor.\n\nMistress de Chavasse went about the house like a country wench\nfrightened by a ghost, and Mistress Charity averred that she seldom went\nto bed now before midnight. Certain it is that Master Busy himself had\nmet the lady wandering about the house candle in hand at an hour when\nall respectable folk should be abed, and when she almost fell up against\nHymn-of-Praise in the dark she gave a frightened scream as if she had\nsuddenly come face to face with the devil.\n\nThen there was her young ladyship.\n\nShe was neither ill-tempered nor yet under the ban of fear, but Master\nBusy vowed unto himself that she was suffering from ill-concealed\nmelancholy, from some hidden secret or wild romance. She seldom laughed,\nshe had spoken with discourtesy and impatience to Squire Pyncheon, who\nrode over the other day on purpose to bring her a bunch of sweet\nmarjoram which grew in great profusion in his mother's garden: she\nmarkedly avoided the company of her guardian, and wandered about the\npark alone, at all hours of the day--a proceeding which in a young lady\nof her rank was quite unseemly.\n\nAll these facts neatly docketed in Master Busy's orderly brain,\ndisturbed him not a little. He had not yet made up his mind as to the\nnature of the mystery which was surrounding the Court and its inmates,\nbut vaguely he thought of abductions and elopements, which the presence\nof the richest heiress in the South of England in the house of the\npoorest squire in the whole country, more than foreshadowed.\n\nThis lonely, somewhat eerie corner of the park appeared to be the center\naround which all the mysterious happenings revolved, and Master\nHymn-of-Praise had found his way hither on this fine July afternoon,\nbecause he had distinct hopes of finding out something definite, certain\nfacts which he then could place before Squire Boatfield who was\nmajor-general of the district, and who would then, doubtless, commend\nhim for his ability and shrewdness in forestalling what might prove to\nbe a terrible crime.\n\nThe days were getting shorter now; it was little more than eight\no'clock and already the shades of evening were drawing closely in: the\nlast rays of the setting sun had long disappeared in a glowing haze of\ngold, and the fantastic branches of the old elms, intertwined with the\nparasitic ivy looked grim and threatening, silhouetted against the lurid\nafter glow. Master Busy liked neither the solitude, nor yet the silence\nof the woods; he had just caught sight of a bat circling over the\ndilapidated roof of the pavilion, and he hated bats. Though he belonged\nto a community which denied the angels and ignored the saints, he had a\nfirm belief in the existence of a tangible devil, and somehow he could\nnot dissociate his ideas of hell and of evil spirits from those which\nrelated to the mysterious flutterings of bats.\n\nMoreover he thought that his duties in connection with the science of\nsecret investigation, had been sufficiently fulfilled for the day, and\nhe prepared to wend his way back to the house, when the sound of voices,\nonce more aroused his somnolent attention.\n\n\"Someone,\" he murmured within himself, \"the heiress and the abductor\nmayhap.\"\n\nThis might prove the opportunity of his life, the chance which would\nplace him within the immediate notice of the major-general, perhaps of\nHis Highness the Protector himself. He felt that to vacate his post of\nobservation at this moment would be unworthy the moral discipline which\nan incipient servant of the Commonwealth should impose upon himself.\n\nStriving to smother a sense of terror, or to disguise it even to\nhimself under the mask of officiousness, he looked about for a\nhiding-place--a post of observation as he called it.\n\nA tree with invitingly forked branches seemed to be peculiarly adapted\nto his needs. Hymn-of-Praise was neither very young nor very agile, but\ndreams of coming notoriety lent nimbleness to his limbs.\n\nBy the time that the voices drew nearer, the sober butler of Acol Court\nwas installed astride an elm bough, hidden by the dense foliage and by\nthe leaf-laden strands of ivy, enfolded by the fast gathering shadows of\nevening, supremely uncomfortable physically, none too secure on his\nperch, yet proud and satisfied in the consciousness of fulfilled duty.\n\nThe next moment he caught sight of Mistress Charity--Mistress Charity so\nplease you, who had plighted her troth to him, walking arm in arm with\nMaster Courage Toogood, as impudent, insolent and debauched a young\njackanapes as ever defaced the forests of Thanet.\n\n\"Mistress, fair mistress,\" he was sighing, and murmuring in her ear,\n\"the most beautiful and gracious thing on God's earth, when I hold you\npressed thus against my beating heart ...\"\n\nApparently his feelings were too deep to be expressed in the words of\nhis own vocabulary, for he paused a while, sighed audibly, and then\nasked anxiously:\n\n\"You do hear my heart beating, mistress, do you not?\"\n\nShe blushed, for she was naught but a female baggage, and though Master\nBusy's impassioned protestations of less than half an hour ago, must be\nstill ringing in her ears, she declared emphatically that she could hear\nthe throbbing of that young vermin's heart.\n\nMaster Busy up aloft was quite sure that what she heard was a few sheep\nand cattle of Sir Marmaduke's who were out to grass in a field close by,\nand had been scared into a canter.\n\nWhat went on for the next moment or two the saintly man on the elm tree\nbranch could not rightly perceive, but the next words from Mistress\nCharity's lips sent a thrill of indignation through his heart.\n\n\"Oh! Master Courage,\" she said with a little cry, \"you must not squeeze\nme so! I vow you have taken the breath out of my body! The Lord love\nyou, child! think you I can stay here all this while and listen to your\nnonsense?\"\n\n\"Just one minute longer, fair mistress,\" entreated the young reprobate,\n\"the moon is not yet up, the birds have gone to their nests for sleep,\nwill ye not tarry a while here with me? That old fool Busy will never\nknow!\"\n\nIt is a fact that at this juncture the saintly man well-nigh fell off\nhis perch, and when Master Courage, amidst many coy shrieks from the\nfickle female, managed to drag her down beside him, upon the carpet of\nmoss immediately beneath the very tree whereon Hymn-of-Praise was\nholding watch, the unfortunate man had need of all his strength of mind\nand of purpose not to jump down with both feet upon the lying face of\nthat young limb of Satan.\n\nBut he felt that the discovery of his somewhat undignified position by\nthese two evil-doers would not at this moment be quite opportune, so he\nendeavored to maintain his equilibrium at the cost of supreme\ndiscomfort, and the loud cracking of the branch on which he was perched.\n\nMistress Charity gave a cry of terror.\n\n\"What was that?\"\n\n\"Nothing, nothing, mistress, I swear,\" rejoined Courage reassuringly,\n\"there are always noises in old elm trees, the ivy hangs heavy and ...\"\n\n\"I have heard it said of late that the pavilion is haunted,\" she\nmurmured under her breath.\n\n\"No! not haunted, mistress! I vow 'tis but the crackling of loose\nbranches, and there is that which I would whisper in your ear ...\"\n\nBut before Master Courage had the time to indulge in this, the desire of\nhis heart, something fell upon the top of his lean head which certainly\nnever grew on the elm tree overhead. Having struck his lanky hair the\nobject fell straight into his lap.\n\nIt was a button. An ordinary, brown, innocent enough looking button. But\nstill a button. Master Courage took it in his hand and examined it\ncarefully, turning it over once or twice. The little thing certainly\nwore a familiar air. Master Courage of a truth had seen such an one\nbefore.\n\n\"That thing never grew up there, master,\" said Mistress Charity in an\nagitated whisper.\n\n\"No!\" he rejoined emphatically, \"nor yet doth a button form part of the\nhabiliments of a ghost.\"\n\nBut not a sound came from above: and though Courage and Charity peered\nupwards with ever-increasing anxiety, the fast gathering darkness\neffectually hid the mystery which lurked within that elm.\n\n\"I vow that there's something up there, mistress,\" said the youth with\nsudden determination.\n\n\"Could it be bats, master?\" she queried with a shudder.\n\n\"Nay! but bats do not wear buttons,\" he replied sententiously. \"Yet of a\nsurety, I mean to make an investigation of the affair as that old fool\nHymn-of-Praise would say.\"\n\nWhereupon, heedless of Mistress Charity's ever-growing agitation, he ran\ntowards the boundary wall of the park, and vaulted the low gate with an\nagile jump even as she uttered a pathetic appeal to him not to leave her\nalone in the dark.\n\nFear had rooted the girl to the spot. She dared not move away, fearful\nlest her running might entice that mysterious owner of the brown button\nto hurry in her track. Yet she would have loved to follow Master\nCourage, and to put at least a gate and wall between herself and those\nterrible elms.\n\nShe was just contemplating a comprehensive and vigorous attack of\nhysterics when she heard Master Courage's voice from the other side of\nthe gate.\n\n\"Hist! Hist, mistress! Quick!\"\n\nShe gathered up what shreds of valor she possessed and ran blindly in\nthe direction whence came the welcome voice.\n\n\"I pray you take this,\" said the youth, who was holding a wooden bucket\nout over the gate, \"whilst I climb back to you.\"\n\n\"But what is it, master?\" she asked, as--obeying him mechanically--she\ntook the bucket from him. It was heavy, for it was filled almost to the\nbrim with a liquid which seemed very evil-smelling.\n\nThe next moment Master Courage was standing beside her. He took the\nbucket from her and then walked as rapidly as he could with it back\ntowards the elm tree.\n\n\"It will help me to dislodge the bats, mistress,\" he said enigmatically,\nspeaking over his shoulder as he walked.\n\nShe followed him--excited but timorous--until together they once more\nreached the spot, where Master Courage's amorous declarations had been\nso rudely interrupted. He put the bucket down beside him, and rubbed his\nhands together whilst uttering certain sounds which betrayed his glee.\n\nThen only did she notice that he was carrying under one arm a long\ncurious-looking instrument--round and made of tin, with a handle at one\nend.\n\nShe looked curiously into the bucket and at the instrument.\n\n\"'Tis the tar-water used for syringing the cattle,\" she whispered, \"ye\nmust not touch it, master. Where did you find it?\"\n\n\"Just by the wall,\" he rejoined. \"I knew it was kept there. They wash\nthe sheep with it to destroy the vermin in them. This is the squirt for\nit,\" he added calmly, placing the end of the instrument in the liquid,\n\"and I will mayhap destroy the vermin which is lodged in that elm tree.\"\n\nA cry of terror issuing from above froze the very blood in Mistress\nCharity's veins.\n\n\"Stop! stop! you young limb of Satan!\" came from Master Busy's nearly\nchoking throat.\n\n\"It's evildoers or evil spirits, master,\" cried Mistress Charity in an\nagony of fear.\n\n\"Whatever it be, mistress, this should destroy it!\" said Master Courage\nphilosophically, as turning the syringe upwards he squirted the whole of\nits contents straight into the fork of the ivy-covered branches.\n\nThere was a cry of rage, followed by a cry of terror, then Master\nHymn-of-Praise Busy with a terrific clatter of breaking boughs, fell in\na heap upon the soft carpet of moss.\n\nMaster Courage be it said to the eternal shame of venturesome youth,\ntook incontinently to his heels, leaving Mistress Charity to bear the\nbrunt of the irate saintly man's wrath.\n\nMaster Busy, we must admit had but little saintliness left in him now.\nLet us assume that--as he explained afterwards--he was not immediately\naware of Mistress Charity's presence, and that his own sense of\npropriety and of decorum had been drowned in a cataract of tar water.\nCertain it is that a volley of oaths, which would have surprised Sir\nMarmaduke himself, escaped his lips.\n\nHad he not every excuse? He was dripping from head to foot, spluttering,\nblinded, choked and bruised.\n\nHe shook himself like a wet spaniel. Then hearing the sound of a\nsmothered exclamation which did not seem altogether unlike a giggle, he\nturned round savagely and perceived the dim outline of Mistress\nCharity's dainty figure.\n\n\"The Lord love thee, Master Hymn-of-Praise,\" she began, somewhat\nnervously, \"but you have made yourself look a sight.\"\n\n\"And by G--d I'll make that young jackanapes look a sight ere I take my\nhand off him,\" he retorted savagely.\n\n\"But what were you ... hem! what wert thou doing up in the elm tree,\nfriend Hymn-of-Praise?\" she asked demurely.\n\n\"Thee me no thou!\" he said with enigmatic pompousness, followed by a\ndistinctly vicious snarl, \"Master Busy will be my name in future for a\nsaucy wench like thee.\"\n\nHe turned towards the house. Mistress Charity following meekly--somewhat\nsubdued, for Master Busy was her affianced husband, and she had no mind\nto mar her future, through any of young Courage's dare-devil escapades.\n\n\"Thou wouldst wish to know what I was doing up in that forked tree?\" he\nasked her with calm dignity after a while, when the hedges of the flower\ngarden came in sight. \"I was making a home for thee, according to the\ncommands of the Lord.\"\n\n\"Not in the elm trees of a surety, Master Busy?\"\n\n\"I was making a home for thee,\" he repeated without heeding her flippant\nobservation, \"by rendering myself illustrious. I told thee, wench, did I\nnot? that something was happening within the precincts of Acol Court,\nand that it is my duty to lie in wait and to watch. The heiress is about\nto be abducted, and it is my task to frustrate the evil designs of the\nmysterious criminal.\"\n\nShe looked at him in speechless amazement. He certainly looked strangely\nweird in the semi-darkness with his lanky hair plastered against his\ncheeks, his collar half torn from round his neck, the dripping, oily\nsubstance flowing in rivulets from his garments down upon the ground.\n\nThe girl had no longer any desire to laugh, and when Master Busy strode\nmajestically across the rustic bridge, then over the garden paths to the\nkitchen quarter of the house, she followed him without a word, awed by\nhis extraordinary utterances, vaguely feeling that in his dripping\ngarments he somehow reminded her of Jonah and the whale.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\nAVOWED ENMITY\n\n\nThe pavilion had been built some fifty years ago, by one of the Spantons\nof Acol who had a taste for fanciful architecture.\n\nIt had been proudly held by several deceased representatives of the\nfamily to be the reproduction of a Greek temple. It certainly had\ncolumns supporting the portico, and steps leading thence to the ground.\nIt was also circular in shape and was innocent of windows, deriving its\nsole light from the door, when it was open.\n\nThe late Sir Jeremy, I believe, had been very fond of the place. Being\nof a somewhat morose and taciturn disposition, he liked the seclusion of\nthis lonely corner of the park. He had a chair or two put into the\npavilion and 'twas said that he indulged there in the smoking of that\nfragrant weed which of late had been more generously imported into this\ncountry.\n\nAfter Sir Jeremy's death, the pavilion fell into disuse. Sir Marmaduke\nopenly expressed his dislike of the forlorn hole, as he was wont to call\nit. He caused the door to be locked, and since then no one had entered\nthe little building. The key, it was presumed, had been lost; the lock\ncertainly looked rusty. The roof, too, soon fell into disrepair, and no\ndoubt within, the place soon became the prey of damp and mildew, the\nnest of homing birds, or the lair of timid beasts. Very soon the proud\ncopy of an archaic temple took on that miserable and forlorn look\npeculiar to uninhabited spots.\n\nFrom an air of abandonment to that of eeriness was but a step, and now\nthe building towered in splendid isolation, in this remote corner of the\npark, at the confines of the wood, with a reputation for being the abode\nof ghosts, of bats and witches, and other evil things.\n\nWhen Master Busy sought for tracks of imaginary criminals bent on\nabducting the heiress he naturally drifted to this lonely spot; when\nMaster Courage was bent on whispering sweet nothings into the ear of the\nother man's betrothed, he enticed her to that corner of the park where\nhe was least like to meet the heavy-booted saint.\n\nThus it was that these three met on the one spot where as a rule at a\nlate hour of the evening Prince Am\u00c3\u00a9d\u00c3\u00a9 d'Orl\u00c3\u00a9ans was wont to commence his\nwanderings, sure of being undisturbed, and with the final disappearance\nof Master Busy and Mistress Charity the place was once more deserted.\n\nThe bats once more found delight in this loneliness and from all around\ncame that subdued murmur, that creaking of twigs, that silence so full\nof subtle sounds, which betrays the presence of animal life on the\nprowl.\n\nAnon there came the harsh noise of a key grating in a rusty lock. The\ndoor of the pavilion was cautiously opened from within and the\nmysterious French prince, bewigged, booted and hatted, emerged into the\nopen. The night had drawn a singularly dark mantle over the woods. Banks\nof cloud obscured the sky; the tall elm trees with their ivy-covered\nbranches, and their impenetrable shadows beneath, formed a dense wall\nwhich the sight of human creatures was not keen enough to pierce. Sir\nMarmaduke de Chavasse, in spite of this darkness, which he hailed\ngleefully, peered cautiously and intently round as he descended the\nsteps.\n\nHe had not met Lady Sue in the capacity of her romantic lover since that\nevening a week ago, when his secret had been discovered by Mistress de\nChavasse. The last vision he had had of the young girl was one redolent\nof joy and love and trust, sufficient to reassure him that all was well\nwith her, in regard to his schemes; but on that same evening a week ago\nhe had gazed upon another little scene, which had not filled him with\neither joy or security.\n\nHe had seen Lady Sue standing beside a young man whose personality--to\nsay the least--was well-nigh as romantic as that of the exiled scion of\nthe house of Orl\u00c3\u00a9ans. He had seen rather than heard a young and\npassionate nature pouring into girlish ears the avowal of an unselfish\nand ardent love which had the infinite merit of being real and true.\n\nHowever well he himself might play his part of selfless hero and of\nvehement lover, there always lurked the danger that the falseness of his\nprotestations would suddenly ring a warning note to the subtle sense of\nthe confiding girl. Were it not for the intense romanticism of her\ndisposition, which beautified and exalted everything with which it came\nin contact, she would of a surety have detected the lie ere this. He had\nacted his dual r\u00c3\u00b4le with consummate skill, the contrast between the\nsurly Puritanical guardian, with his round cropped head and shaven face,\nand the elegantly dressed cavalier, with a heavy mustache, an enormous\nperruque and a shade over one eye, was so complete that even Mistress de\nChavasse--alert, suspicious, wholly unromantic, had been momentarily\ndeceived, and would have remained so but for his voluntary revelation of\nhimself.\n\nBut the watchful and disappointed young lover was the real danger: a\ndanger complicated by the fact that the Prince Am\u00c3\u00a9d\u00c3\u00a9 d'Orl\u00c3\u00a9ans actually\ndwelt in the cottage owned by Lambert's brother, the blacksmith. The\nmysterious prince had perforce to dwell somewhere; else, whenever spied\nby a laborer or wench from the village, he would have excited still\nfurther comment, and his movements mayhap would have been more\npersistently dogged.\n\nFor this reason Sir Marmaduke had originally chosen Adam Lambert's\ncottage to be his headquarters; it stood on the very outskirts of the\nvillage and as he had only the wood to traverse between it and the\npavilion where he effected his change of personality, he ran thus but\nfew risks of meeting prying eyes. Moreover, Adam Lambert, the\nblacksmith, and the old woman who kept house for him, both belonged to\nthe new religious sect which Judge Bennett had so pertinently dubbed the\nQuakers, and they kept themselves very much aloof from gossip and the\nrest of the village.\n\nTrue, Richard Lambert oft visited his brother and the old woman, but did\nso always in the daytime when Prince Am\u00c3\u00a9d\u00c3\u00a9 d'Orl\u00c3\u00a9ans carefully kept out\nof the way. Sir Marmaduke de Chavasse had all the true instincts of the\nbeast or bird of prey. He prowled about in the dark, and laid his snares\nfor the seizure of his victim under cover of the night.\n\nThis evening certain new schemes had found birth in his active mind; he\nwas impatient that the victim tarried, when his brain was alive with\nthoughts of how to effect a more speedy capture. He leaned against the\nwall, close by the gate as was his wont when awaiting Sue, smiling\ngrimly to himself at thought of the many little subterfuges she would\nemploy to steal out of the house, without encountering--as she\nthought--her watchful guardian.\n\nA voice close behind him--speaking none too kindly--broke in on his\nmeditations, causing him to start--almost to crouch like a frightened\ncat.\n\nThe next moment he had recognized the gruff and nasal tones of Adam\nLambert. Apparently the blacksmith had just come from the wood through\nthe gate, and had almost stumbled in the dark against the rigid figure\nof his mysterious lodger.\n\n\"Friend, what dost thou here?\" he asked peremptorily. But already Sir\nMarmaduke had recovered from that sudden sense of fear which had caused\nhim to start in alarm.\n\n\"I would ask the same question of you, my friend,\" he retorted airily,\nspeaking in the muffled voice and with the markedly foreign accent which\nhe had assumed for the r\u00c3\u00b4le of the Prince, \"might I inquire what you are\ndoing here?\"\n\n\"I have to see a sick mare down Minster way,\" replied Lambert curtly,\n\"this is a short cut thither, and Sir Marmaduke hath granted me leave.\nBut he liketh not strangers loitering in his park.\"\n\n\"Then, friend,\" rejoined the other lightly, \"when Sir Marmaduke doth\nobject to my strolling in his garden, he will doubtless apprise me of\nthe fact, without interference from you.\"\n\nAdam Lambert, after his uncivil greeting of his lodger, had already\nturned his back on him, loath to have further speech with a man whom he\nhated and despised.\n\nLike the majority of country folk these days, the blacksmith had a\nwholesale contempt for every foreigner, and more particularly for those\nwho hailed from France: that country--in the estimation of all Puritans,\nDissenters and Republicans--being the happy abode of every kind of\nimmorality and debauchery.\n\nPrince Am\u00c3\u00a9d\u00c3\u00a9 d'Orl\u00c3\u00a9ans--as he styled himself--with his fantastic\nclothes, his airs and graces and long, curly hair was an object of\nspecial aversion to the Quaker, even though the money which the\ndespised foreigner paid for his lodgings was passing welcome these hard\ntimes.\n\nAdam resolutely avoided speech with the Prince, whenever possible, but\nthe latter's provocative and sarcastic speech roused his dormant hatred;\nlike a dog who has been worried, he now turned abruptly round and faced\nSir Marmaduke, stepping close up to him, his eyes glaring with\nvindictive rage, a savage snarl rising in his throat.\n\n\"Take notice, friend,\" he said hoarsely, \"that I'll not bear thine\nimpudence. Thou mayest go and bully the old woman at the cottage when I\nam absent--Oh! I've heard thee!\" he added with unbridled savagery,\n\"ordering her about as if she were thy serving wench ... but let me tell\nthee that she is no servant of thine, nor I ... so have done, my fine\nprince ... dost understand?\"\n\n\"Prithee, friend, do not excite yourself,\" said Sir Marmaduke blandly,\ndrawing back against the wall as far as he could to avoid close\nproximity with his antagonist. \"I have never wished to imply that\nMistress Lambert was aught but my most obliging, most amiable\nlandlady--nor have I, to my certain knowledge, overstepped the\nprivileges of a lodger. I trust that your worthy aunt hath no cause for\ncomplaint. Mistress Lambert is your aunt?\" he added superciliously, \"is\nshe not?\"\n\n\"That is nothing to thee,\" muttered the other, \"if she be my aunt or no,\nas far as I can see.\"\n\n\"Surely not. I asked in a spirit of polite inquiry.\"\n\nBut apparently this subject was one which had more than any other the\npower to rouse the blacksmith's savage temper. He fought with it for a\nmoment or two, for anger is the Lord's, and strict Quaker discipline\nforbade such unseemly wrangling. But Adam was a man of violent\ntemperament which his strict religious training had not altogether\nsucceeded in holding in check: the sneers of the foreign prince, his\ncalm, supercilious attitude, broke the curb which religion had set upon\nhis passion.\n\n\"Aye! thou art mighty polite to me, my fine gentleman,\" he said\nvehemently. \"Thou knowest what I think of thy lazy foreign ways ... why\ndost thou not do a bit of honest work, instead of hanging round her\nladyship's skirts? ... If I were to say a word to Sir Marmaduke, 'twould\nbe mightily unpleasant for thee, an I mistake not. Oh! I know what\nthou'rt after, with thy fine ways, and thy romantic, lying talk of\nliberty and patriotism! ... the heiress, eh, friend? That is thy\ndesign.... I am not blind, I tell thee.... I have seen thee and her ...\"\n\nSir Marmaduke laughed lightly, shrugging his shoulders in token of\nindifference.\n\n\"Quite so, quite so, good master,\" he said suavely, \"do ye not waste\nyour breath in speaking thus loudly. I understand that your sentiments\ntowards me do not partake of that Christian charity of which ye and\nyours do prate at times so loudly. But I'll not detain you. Doubtless\nworthy Mistress Lambert will be awaiting you, or is it the sick mare\ndown Minster way that hath first claim on your amiability? I'll not\ndetain you.\"\n\nHe turned as if to go, but Adam's hard grip was on his shoulder in an\ninstant.\n\n\"Nay! thou'lt not detain me--'tis I am detaining thee!\" said the\nblacksmith hoarsely, \"for I desired to tell thee that thy ugly French\nface is abhorrent to me ... I do not hold with princes.... For a prince\nis none better than another man nay, he is worse an he loafs and steals\nafter heiresses and their gold ... and will not do a bit of honest\nwork.... Work makes the man.... Work and prayer ... not your titles and\nfine estates. This is a republic now ... understand? ... no king, no\nHouse of Lords--please the Lord neither clergymen nor noblemen soon....\nI work with my hands ... and am not ashamed. The Lord Saviour was a\ncarpenter and not a prince.... My brother is a student and a\ngentleman--as good as any prince--understand? Ten thousand times as good\nas thee.\"\n\nHe relaxed his grip which had been hard as steel on Sir Marmaduke's\nshoulder. It was evident that he had been nursing hatred and loathing\nagainst his lodger for some time, and that to-night the floodgates of\nhis pent-up wrath had been burst asunder through the mysterious prince's\ntaunts, and insinuations anent the cloud and secrecy which hung round\nthe Lamberts' parentage.\n\nThough his shoulder was painful and bruised under the pressure of the\nblacksmith's rough fingers, Sir Marmaduke did not wince. He looked his\navowed enemy boldly in the face, with no small measure of contempt for\nthe violence displayed.\n\nHis own enmity towards those who thwarted him was much more subtle,\nsilent and cautious. He would never storm and rage, show his enmity\nopenly and caution his antagonist through an outburst of rage. Adam\nLambert still glaring into his lodger's eye, encountered nothing therein\nbut irony and indulgent contempt.\n\nReligion forbade him to swear. Yet was he sorely tempted, and we may\npresume that he cursed inwardly, for his enemy refused to be drawn into\nwordy warfare, and he himself had exhausted his vocabulary of sneering\nabuse, even as he had exhausted his breath.\n\nPerhaps in his innermost heart he was ashamed of his outburst. After\nall, he had taken this man's money, and had broken bread with him. His\nhand dropped to his side, and his head fell forward on his breast even\nas with a pleasant laugh the prince carelessly turned away, and with an\naffected gesture brushed his silken doublet, there where the\nblacksmith's hard grip had marred the smoothness of the delicate fabric.\n\nHad Adam Lambert possessed that subtle sixth sense, which hears and sees\nthat which goes on in the mind of others, he had perceived a thought in\nhis lodger's brain cells which might have caused him to still further\nregret his avowal of open enmity.\n\nFor as the blacksmith finally turned away and walked off through the\npark, skirting the boundary wall, Sir Marmaduke looked over his shoulder\nat the ungainly figure which was soon lost in the gloom, and muttered a\nround oath between his teeth.\n\n\"An exceedingly unpleasant person,\" he vowed within himself, \"you will\nhave to be removed, good master, an you get too troublesome.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI\n\nSURRENDER\n\n\nBut this interview with the inimical Quaker had more than strengthened\nSir Marmaduke's design to carry his bold scheme more rapidly to its\nsuccessful issue.\n\nThe game which he had played with grave risks for over three months now\nhad begun to be dangerous. The mysterious patriot from France could not\nafford to see prying enemies at his heels.\n\nAnon when the graceful outline of Lady Sue's figure emerged from out the\nsurrounding gloom, Sir Marmaduke went forward to meet her, and clasped\nher to him in a passionate embrace.\n\n\"My gracious lady ... my beautiful Sue ...\" he murmured whilst he\ncovered her hands, her brow, her hair with ardent kisses, \"you have come\nso late--and I have been so weary of waiting ... waiting for you.\"\n\nHe led her through the gardens to where one gigantic elm, grander than\nits fellows, had thrown out huge gnarled roots which protruded from out\nthe ground. One of these, moss-covered, green and soft, formed a perfect\nresting place. He drew her down, begging her to sit. She obeyed, scared\nsomewhat as was her wont when she found him so unfettered and violent.\n\nHe stretched himself at full length at her feet, extravagant now in his\nacts and gestures like a man who no longer can hold turbulent passion in\ncheck. He kissed the edge of her kirtle, then her cloak and the tips of\nher little shoes:\n\n\"It was cruel to keep me waiting ... gracious lady--it was cruel,\" he\nmurmured in the intervals between these ardent caresses.\n\n\"I am so sorry, Am\u00c3\u00a9d\u00c3\u00a9,\" she repeated, grieving to see him so sorrowful,\nnot a little frightened at his vehemence,--trying to withdraw her hands\nfrom his grasp. \"I was detained ...\"\n\n\"Detained,\" he rejoined harshly, \"detained by someone else ... someone\nwho had a greater claim on your time than the poor exile ...\"\n\n\"Nay! 'tis unkind thus to grieve me,\" she said with tender reproach as\nshe felt the hot tears gather in her eyes. \"You know--as I do--that I am\nnot my own mistress yet.\"\n\n\"Yes! yes! forgive me--my gracious, sweet, sweet lady.... I am mad when\nyou are not nigh me.... You do not know--how could you? ... what\ntorments I endure, when I think of you so beautiful, so exquisite, so\nadorable, surrounded by other men who admire you ... desire you,\nmayhap.... Oh! my God! ...\"\n\n\"But you need have no fear,\" she protested gently, \"you know that I gave\nmy whole heart willingly to you ... my prince ...\"\n\n\"Nay, but you cannot know,\" he persisted violently, \"sweet, gentle\ncreature that you are, you cannot guess the agonies which a strong man\nendures when he is gnawed by ruthless insane jealousy ...\"\n\nShe gave a cry of pain.\n\n\"Am\u00c3\u00a9d\u00c3\u00a9!\" for she felt hurt, deeply wounded by his mistrust of her, when\nshe had so wholly, so fully trusted him.\n\n\"I know ... I know,\" he said with quick transition of tone, fearful that\nhe had offended her, striving to master his impatience, to find words\nwhich best pleased her young, romantic temperament, \"Nay! but you must\nthink me mad.... Mayhap you despise me,\" he added with a gentle note of\nsadness. \"Oh, God! ... mayhap you will turn from me now....\"\n\n\"No! no!\"\n\n\"Yet do I worship you ... my saint ... my divinity ... my Suzanne....\nYou are more beautiful, more adorable than any woman in the world ...\nand I am so unworthy.\"\n\n\"You unworthy!\" she retorted, laughing gayly through her tears. \"You, my\nprince, my king! ...\"\n\n\"Say that once more, my Suzanne,\" he murmured with infinite gentleness,\n\"oh! the exquisite sweetness of your voice, which is like dream-music in\nmine ears.... Oh! to hold you in my arms thus, for ever ... until death,\nsweeter than life ... came to me in one long passionate kiss.\"\n\nShe allowed him to put his arms round her now, glad that the darkness\nhid the blush on her cheeks; thus she loved him, thus she had first\nlearned to love him, ardent, oh, yes! but so gentle, so meek, yet so\ngreat and exalted in his selfless patriotism.\n\n\"'Tis not of death you should speak, sweet prince,\" she said, ineffably\nhappy now that she felt him more subdued, more trusting and fond,\n\"rather should you speak of life ... with me, your own Suzanne ... of\nhappiness in the future, when you and I, hand in hand, will work\ntogether for that great cause you hold so dear ... the freedom and\nliberties of France.\"\n\n\"Ah, yes!\" he sighed in utter dejection, \"when that happy time comes ...\nbut ...\"\n\n\"You do not trust me?\" she asked reproachfully.\n\n\"With all my heart, my Suzanne,\" he replied, \"but you are so beautiful,\nso rich ... and other men ...\"\n\n\"There are no other men for me,\" she retorted simply. \"I love you.\"\n\n\"Will you prove it to me?\"\n\n\"How can I?\"\n\n\"Be mine ... mine absolutely,\" he urged eagerly with passion just\nsufficiently subdued to make her pulses throb. \"Be my wife ... my\nprincess ... let me feel that no one could come between us....\"\n\n\"But my guardian would never consent,\" she protested.\n\n\"Surely your love for me can dispense with Sir Marmaduke's consent....\"\n\n\"A secret marriage?\" she asked, terrified at this strange vista which\nhis fiery imagination was conjuring up before her.\n\n\"You refuse? ...\" he asked hoarsely.\n\n\"No! no! ... but ...\"\n\n\"Then you do not love me, Suzanne.\"\n\nThe coolness in his tone struck a sudden chill to her heart. She felt\nthe clasp of his arms round her relax, she felt rather than saw that he\nwithdrew markedly from her.\n\n\"Ah! forgive me! forgive me!\" she murmured, stretching her little hands\nout to him in a pathetic and childlike appeal. \"I have never deceived\nanyone in my life before.... How could I live a lie? ... married to you,\nyet seemingly a girl.... Whilst in three months....\"\n\nShe paused in her eagerness, for he had jumped to his feet and was now\nstanding before her, a rigid, statuesque figure, with head bent and arms\nhanging inert by his side.\n\n\"You do not love me, Suzanne,\" he said with an infinity of sadness,\nwhich went straight to her own loving heart, \"else you would not dream\nof thus condemning me to three months of exquisite torture.... I have\nhad my answer.... Farewell, my gracious lady ... not mine, alas! but\nanother man's ... and may Heaven grant that he love you well ... not as\nI do, for that were impossible....\"\n\nHis voice had died away in a whisper, which obviously was half-choked\nwith tears. She, too, had risen while he spoke, all her hesitation\ngone, her heart full of reproaches against herself, and of love for him.\n\n\"What do you mean?\" she asked trembling.\n\n\"That I must go,\" he replied simply, \"since you do not love me....\"\n\nOh! how thankful she was that this merciful darkness enwrapped her so\ntenderly. She was so young, so innocent and pure, that she felt half\nashamed of the expression of her own great love which went out to him in\na veritable wave of passion, when she began to fear that she was about\nto lose him.\n\n\"No, no,\" she cried vehemently, \"you shall not go ... you shall not.\"\n\nHer hands sought his in the gloom, and found them, clung to them with\never-growing ardor; she came quite close to him trying to peer into his\nface and to let him read in hers all the pathetic story of her own deep\nlove for him.\n\n\"I love you,\" she murmured through her tears. And again she repeated: \"I\nlove you. See,\" she added with sudden determination, \"I will do e'en as\nyou wish.... I will follow you to the uttermost ends of the earth.... I\n... I will marry you ... secretly ... an you wish.\"\n\nWelcome darkness that hid her blushes! ... she was so young--so ignorant\nof life and of the world--yet she felt that by her words, her promise,\nher renunciation of her will, she was surrendering something to this\nman, which she could never, never regain.\n\nDid the first thought of fear, or misgiving cross her mind at this\nmoment? It were impossible to say. The darkness which to her was so\nwelcome was--had she but guessed it--infinitely cruel too, for it hid\nthe look of triumph, of rapacity, of satisfied ambition which at her\nselfless surrender had involuntarily crept into Marmaduke's eyes.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII\n\nA WOMAN'S HEART\n\n\nIt is difficult, perhaps, to analyze rightly the feelings and sensations\nof a young girl, when she is literally being swept off her feet in a\nwhirlpool of passion and romance.\n\nSome few years later when Lady Sue wrote those charming memoirs which\nare such an interesting record of her early life, she tried to note with\nfaithful accuracy what was the exact state of her mind when three months\nafter her first meeting with Prince Am\u00c3\u00a9d\u00c3\u00a9 d'Orl\u00c3\u00a9ans, she plighted her\ntroth to him and promised to marry him in secret and in defiance of her\nguardian's more than probable opposition.\n\nHer sentiments with regard to her mysterious lover were somewhat\ncomplex, and undoubtedly she was too young, too inexperienced then to\ndifferentiate between enthusiastic interest in a romantic personality,\nand real, lasting, passionate love for a man, as apart from any halo of\nromance which might be attached to him.\n\nWhen she was a few years older she averred that she could never have\nreally loved her prince, because she always feared him. Hers, therefore,\nwas not the perfect love that casteth out fear. She was afraid of him in\nhis ardent moods, almost as much as when he allowed his unbridled temper\nfree rein. Whenever she walked through the dark bosquets of the park,\non her way to a meeting with her lover, she was invariably conscious of\na certain trepidation of all her nerves, a wonderment as to what he\nwould say when she saw him, how he would act; whether chide, or rave, or\nmerely reproach.\n\nIt was the gentle and pathetic terror of a child before a stern yet\nmuch-loved parent. Yet she never mistrusted him ... perhaps because she\nhad never really seen him--only in outline, half wrapped in shadows, or\nmerely silhouetted against a weirdly lighted background. His appearance\nhad no tangible reality for her. She was in love with an ideal, not with\na man ... he was merely the mouthpiece of an individuality which was of\nher own creation.\n\nAdded to all this there was the sense of isolation. She had lost her\nmother when she was a baby; her father fell at Naseby. She herself had\nbeen an only child, left helplessly stranded when the civil war\ndispersed her relations and friends, some into exile, others in splendid\nrevolt within the fastnesses of their own homes, impoverished by pillage\nand sequestration, rebellious, surrounded by spies, watching that\nopportunity for retaliation which was so slow in coming.\n\nTossed hither and thither by Fate in spite of--or perhaps because\nof--her great wealth, she had found a refuge, though not a home, at Acol\nCourt; she had been of course too young at the time to understand\nrightly the great conflict between the King's party and the Puritans,\nbut had naturally embraced the cause--for which her father's life had\nbeen sacrificed--blindly, like a child of instinct, not like a woman of\nthought.\n\nHer guardian and Mistress de Chavasse stood for that faction of\nRoundheads at which her father and all her relatives had sneered even\nwhile they were being conquered and oppressed by them. She disliked them\nboth from the first; and chafed at the parsimonious habits of the house,\nwhich stood in such glaring contrast to the easy lavishness of her own\nluxurious home.\n\nFortunately for her, her guardian avoided rather than sought her\ncompany. She met him at meals and scarcely more often than that, and\nthough she often heard his voice about the house, usually raised in\nanger or impatience, he was invariably silent and taciturn when she was\npresent.\n\nThe presence of Richard Lambert, his humble devotion, his whole-hearted\nsympathy and the occasional moments of conversation which she had with\nhim were the only bright moments in her dull life at the Court: and\nthere is small doubt but that the friendship and trust which\ncharacterized her feelings towards him would soon have ripened into more\npassionate love, but for the advent into her life of the mysterious\nhero, who by his personality, his strange, secretive ways, his talk of\npatriotism and liberty, at once took complete possession of her girlish\nimagination.\n\nShe was perhaps just too young when she met Lambert; she had not yet\nreached that dangerous threshold when girlhood looks from out obscure\nignorance into the glaring knowledge of womanhood. She was a child when\nLambert showed his love for her by a thousand little simple acts of\ndevotion and by the mute adoration expressed in his eyes. Lambert drew\nher towards the threshold by his passionate love, and held her back\nwithin the refuge of innocent girlhood by the sincerity and exaltation\nof his worship.\n\nWith the first word of vehement, unreasoning passion, the mysterious\nprince dragged the girl over that threshold into womanhood. He gave her\nno time to think, no time to analyze her feelings; he rushed her into a\ntorrent of ardor and of excitement in which she never could pause in\norder to draw breath.\n\nTo-night she had promised to marry him secretly--to surrender herself\nbody and soul to this man whom she hardly knew, whom she had never\nreally seen; she felt neither joy nor remorse, only a strange sense of\nagitation, an unnatural and morbid impatience to see the end of the next\nfew days of suspense.\n\nFor the first time since she had come to Acol, and encountered the\nkindly sympathy of Richard Lambert, she felt bitterly angered against\nhim when, having parted from the prince at the door of the pavilion, she\nturned, to walk back towards the house and came face to face with the\nyoung man.\n\nA narrow path led through the trees, from the ha-ha to the gate, and\nRichard Lambert was apparently walking along aimlessly, in the direction\nof the pavilion.\n\n\"I came hoping to meet your ladyship and to escort you home. The night\nseems very dark,\" he explained simply in answer to a sudden, haughty\nstiffening of her young figure, which he could not help but notice.\n\n\"I was taking a stroll in the park,\" she rejoined coldly, \"the evening\nis sweet and balmy but ... I have no need of escort, Master Lambert ...\nI thank you.... It is late and I would wish to go indoors alone.\"\n\n\"It is indeed late, gracious lady,\" he said gently, \"and the park is\nlonely at night ... will you not allow me to walk beside you as far as\nthe house?\"\n\nBut somehow his insistence, his very gentleness struck a jarring note,\nfor which she herself could not have accounted. Was it the contrast\nbetween two men, which unaccountably sent a thrill of disappointment,\nalmost of apprehension, through her heart?\n\nShe was angry with Lambert, bitterly angry because he was kind and\ngentle and long-suffering, whilst the other was violent, even brutal at\ntimes.\n\n\"I must repeat, master, that I have no need of your escort,\" she said\nhaughtily, \"I have no fear of marauders, nor yet of prowling beasts. And\nfor the future I should be grateful to you,\" she added, conscious of her\nown cruelty, determined nevertheless to be remorselessly cruel, \"if you\nwere to cease that system which you have adopted of late--that of\nspying on my movements.\"\n\n\"Spying?\"\n\nThe word had struck him in the face like a blow. And she, womanlike,\nwith that strange, impulsive temperament of hers, was not at all sorry\nthat she had hurt him. Yet surely he had done her no wrong, save by\nbeing so different from the other man, and by seeming to belittle that\nother in her sight, against her will and his own.\n\n\"I am grieved, believe me,\" she said coldly, \"if I seem unkind ... but\nyou must see for yourself, good master, that we cannot go on as we are\ndoing now.... Whenever I go out, you follow me ... when I return I find\nyou waiting for me.... I have endeavored to think kindly of your\nactions, but if you value my friendship, as you say you do, you will let\nme go my way in peace.\"\n\n\"Nay! I humbly beg your ladyship's gracious forgiveness,\" he said; \"if I\nhave transgressed, it is because I am blind to all save your ladyship's\nfuture happiness, and at times the thought of that adventurer is more\nthan I can bear.\"\n\n\"You do yourself no good, Master Lambert, by talking thus to me of the\nman I love and honor beyond all things in this world. You are blind and\nsee not things as they are: blind to the merits of one who is as\ninfinitely above you as the stars. But nathless I waste my breath\nagain.... I have no power to convince you of the grievous error which\nyou commit. But if you cared for me, as you say you do ...\"\n\n\"If I cared!\" he murmured, with a pathetic emphasis on that little word\n\"if.\"\n\n\"As a friend I mean,\" she rejoined still cold, still cruel, still\nwomanlike in that strange, inexplicable desire to wound the man who\nloved her. \"If you care for me as a friend, you will not throw yourself\nany more in the way of my happiness. Now you may escort me home, an you\nwish. This is the last time that I shall speak to you as a friend, in\nresponse to your petty attacks on the man whom I love. Henceforth you\nmust chose 'twixt his friendship and my enmity!\"\n\nAnd without vouchsafing him another word or look, she gathered her cloak\nmore closely about her, and walked rapidly away along the narrow path.\n\nHe followed with head bent, meditating, wondering! Wondering!\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII\n\nAN IDEA\n\n\nThe triumph was complete. But of a truth the game was waxing dangerous.\n\nLady Sue Aldmarshe had promised to marry her prince. She would keep her\nword, of that Sir Marmaduke was firmly convinced. But there would of\nnecessity be two or three days delay and every hour added to the\nterrors, the certainty of discovery.\n\nThere was a watch-dog at Sue's heels, stern, alert, unyielding. Richard\nLambert was probing the secret of the mysterious prince, with the\nunerring eye of the disappointed lover.\n\nThe meeting to-night had been terribly dangerous. Sir Marmaduke knew\nthat Lambert was lurking somewhere in the park.\n\nAt present even the remotest inkling of the truth must still be far from\nthe young man's mind. The whole scheme was so strange, so daring, so\nforeign to the simple ideas of the Quaker-bred lad, that its very\nboldness had defied suspicion. But the slightest mischance now, a\nmeeting at the door of the pavilion, an altercation--face to face, eye\nto eye--and Richard Lambert would be on the alert. His hatred would not\nbe so blind, nor yet so clumsy, as that of his brother, the blacksmith.\nThere is no spy so keen in all the world as a jealous lover.\n\nThis had been the prince's first meeting with Sue, since that memorable\nday when the secret of their clandestine love became known to Lambert.\nSir Marmaduke knew well that it had been fraught with danger; that every\nfuture meeting would wax more and more perilous still, and that the\nsecret marriage itself, however carefully and secretively planned, would\nhardly escape the prying eyes of the young man.\n\nThe unmasking of Prince Am\u00c3\u00a9d\u00c3\u00a9 d'Orl\u00c3\u00a9ans before Sue had become legally\nhis wife was a possibility which Sir Marmaduke dared not even think of,\nlest the very thought should drive him mad. Once she was his wife! ...\nwell, let her look to herself.... The marriage tie would be a binding\none, he would see to that, and her fortune should be his, even though he\nhad won her by a lie.\n\nHe had staked his very existence on the success of his scheme. Lady\nSue's fortune was the one aim of his life, for it he had worked and\nstriven, and lied: he would not even contemplate a future without it,\nnow that his plans had brought him so near the goal.\n\nHe had one faithful ally, though not a powerful one, in Editha, who,\nlured by some vague promises of his, desperate too, as regarded her own\nfuture, had chosen to throw in her lot whole-heartedly with his.\n\nHe was closeted with her on the following day, in the tiny\nwithdrawing-room which leads out of the hall at Acol Court. When he had\nstolen into the house in the small hours of the morning he had seen\nRichard Lambert leaning out of one of the windows which gave upon the\npark.\n\nIt seemed as if the young man must have seen him when he skirted the\nhouse, for though there was no moonlight, the summer's night was\nsingularly clear. That Lambert had been on the watch--spying, as Sir\nMarmaduke said with a bitter oath of rage--was beyond a doubt.\n\nEditha too was uneasy; she thought that Lambert had purposely avoided\nher the whole morning.\n\n\"I lingered in the garden for as long as I could,\" she said to her\nbrother-in-law, watching with keen anxiety his restless movements to and\nfro in the narrow room, \"I thought Lambert would keep within doors if he\nsaw me about. He did not actually see you, Marmaduke, did he?\" she\nqueried with ever-growing disquietude.\n\n\"No. Not face to face,\" he replied curtly. \"I contrived to avoid him in\nthe park, and kept well within the shadows, when I saw him spying\nthrough the window.\n\n\"Curse him!\" he added with savage fury, \"curse him, for a meddlesome,\nspying cur!\"\n\n\"The whole thing is becoming vastly dangerous,\" she sighed.\n\n\"Yet it must last for another few weeks at least....\"\n\n\"I know ... and Lambert is a desperate enemy: he dogs Sue's footsteps,\nhe will come upon you one day when you are alone, or with her ... he\nwill provoke a quarrel....\"\n\n\"I know--I know ...\" he retorted impatiently, \"'tis no use\nrecapitulating the many evil contingencies that might occur.... I know\nthat Lambert is dangerous ... damn him! ... Would to God I could be rid\nof him ... somehow.\"\n\n\"You can dismiss him,\" she suggested, \"pay him his wages and send him\nabout his business.\"\n\n\"What were the use? He would remain in the village--in his brother's\ncottage mayhap ... with more time on his hands for his spying work....\nHe would dog the wench's steps more jealously than eve.... No! no!\" he\nadded, whilst he cast a quick, furtive look at her--a look which somehow\ncaused her to shiver with apprehension more deadly than heretofore.\n\n\"That's not what I want,\" he said significantly.\n\n\"What's to be done?\" she murmured, \"what's to be done?\"\n\n\"I must think,\" he rejoined harshly. \"But we must get that love-sick\nyouth out of the way ... him and his airs of Providence in disguise....\nSomething must be done to part him from the wench effectually and\ncompletely ... something that would force him to quit this neighborhood\n... forever, if possible.\"\n\nShe did not reply immediately, but fixed her large, dark eyes upon him,\nsilently for a while, then she murmured:\n\n\"If I only knew!\"\n\n\"Knew what?\"\n\n\"If I could trust you, Marmaduke!\"\n\nHe laughed, a harsh, cruel laugh which grated upon her ear.\n\n\"We know too much of one another, my dear Editha, not to trust each\nother.\"\n\n\"My whole future depends on you. I am penniless. If you marry Sue....\"\n\n\"I can provide for you,\" he interrupted roughly. \"What can I do now? My\npenury is worse than yours. So, my dear, if you have a plan to propound\nfor the furtherance of my schemes, I pray you do not let your fear of\nthe future prevent you from lending me a helping hand.\"\n\n\"A thought crossed my mind,\" she said eagerly, \"the thought of something\nwhich would effectually force Richard Lambert to quit this neighborhood\nfor ever.\"\n\n\"What were that?\"\n\n\"Disgrace.\"\n\n\"Disgrace?\" he exclaimed. \"Aye! you are right. Something mean ... paltry\n... despicable ... something that would make her gracious ladyship turn\naway from him in disgust ... and would force him to go away from here\n... for ever.\"\n\nHe looked at her closely, scrutinizing her face, trying to read her\nthoughts.\n\n\"A thought crossed your mind,\" he demanded peremptorily. \"What is it?\"\n\n\"The house in London,\" she murmured.\n\n\"You are not afraid?\"\n\n\"Oh!\" she said with a careless shrug of the shoulders.\n\n\"The Protector's spies are keen,\" he urged, eager to test her courage,\nher desire to help him.\n\n\"They'll scarce remember me after two years.\"\n\n\"Hm! Their memory is keen ... and the new laws doubly severe.\"\n\n\"We'll be cautious.\"\n\n\"How can you let your usual clients know? They are dispersed.\"\n\n\"Oh, no! My Lord Walterton is as keen as ever and Sir James Overbury\nwould brave the devil for a night at hazard. A message to them and we'll\nhave a crowd every night.\"\n\n\"'Tis well thought on, Editha,\" he said approvingly. \"But we must not\ndelay. Will you go to London to-morrow?\"\n\n\"An you approve.\"\n\n\"Aye! you can take the Dover coach and be in town by nightfall. Then\nwrite your letters to my Lord Walterton and Sir James Overbury. Get a\nserving wench from Alverstone's in the Strand, and ask the gentlemen to\nbring their own men, for the sake of greater safety. They'll not\nrefuse.\"\n\n\"Refuse?\" she said with a light laugh, \"oh, no!\"\n\n\"To-day being Tuesday, you should have your first evening entertainment\non Friday. Everything could be ready by then.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes!\"\n\n\"Very well then, on Friday, I, too, will arrive in London, my dear\nEditha, escorted by my secretary, Master Richard Lambert, and together\nwe will call and pay our respects at your charming house in Bath\nStreet.\"\n\n\"I will do my share. You must do yours, Marmaduke. Endicott will help\nyou: he is keen and clever. And if Lambert but takes a card in his hand\n...\"\n\n\"Nay! he will take the cards, mine oath on that! Do you but arrange it\nall with Endicott.\"\n\n\"And, Marmaduke, I entreat you,\" she urged now with sudden earnestness,\n\"I entreat you to beware of my Lord Protector's spies. Think of the\nconsequences for me!\"\n\n\"Aye!\" he said roughly, laughing that wicked, cruel laugh of his, which\ndamped her eagerness, and struck chill terror into her heart, \"aye! the\nwhipping-post for you, fair Editha, for keeping a gaming-house. What? Of\na truth I need not urge you to be cautious.\"\n\nProbably at this moment she would have given worlds--had she possessed\nthem--if she could but have dissociated herself from her\nbrother-in-law's future altogether. Though she was an empty-headed,\nbrainless kind of woman, she was not by nature a wicked one. Necessity\nhad driven her into linking her fortunes with those of Sir Marmaduke.\nAnd he had been kind to her, when she was in deep distress: but for him\nshe would probably have starved, for her beauty had gone and her career\nas an actress had been, for some inexplicable reason, quite suddenly cut\nshort, whilst a police raid on the gaming-house over which she presided\nhad very nearly landed her in a convict's cell.\n\nShe had escaped severe punishment then, chiefly because Cromwell's laws\nagainst gambling were not so rigorous at the time as they had since\nbecome, also because she was able to plead ignorance of them, and\nbecause of the status of first offense.\n\nTherefore she knew quite well what she risked through the scheme which\nshe had so boldly propounded to Sir Marmaduke. Dire disgrace and infamy,\nif my Lord Protector's spies once more came upon the gamesters in her\nhouse--unawares.\n\nUtter social ruin and worse! Yet she risked it all, in order to help\nhim. She did not love him, nor had she any hopes that he would of his\nown free will do more than give her a bare pittance for her needs once\nhe had secured Lady Sue's fortune; but she was shrewd enough to reckon\nthat the more completely she was mixed up in his nefarious projects, the\nmore absolutely forced would he be to accede to her demands later on.\nThe word blackmail had not been invented in those days, but the deed\nitself existed and what Editha had in her mind when she risked ostracism\nfor Sir Marmaduke's sake was something very akin to it.\n\nBut he, in the meanwhile, had thrown off his dejection. He was full of\neagerness, of anticipated triumph now.\n\nThe rough idea which was to help him in his schemes had originated in\nEditha's brain, but already he had elaborated it; had seen in the plan a\nmeans not only of attaining his own ends with regard to Sue, but also\nof wreaking a pleasing vengeance on the man who was trying to frustrate\nhim.\n\n\"I pray you, be of good cheer, fair Editha,\" he said quite gaily. \"Your\nplan is good and sound, and meseems as if the wench's fortune were\nalready within my grasp.\"\n\n\"Within our grasp, you mean, Marmaduke,\" she said significantly.\n\n\"Our grasp of course, gracious lady,\" he said with a marked sneer, which\nshe affected to ignore. \"What is mine is yours. Am I not tied to the\nstrings of your kirtle by lasting bonds of infinite gratitude?\"\n\n\"I will start to-morrow then. By chaise to Dover and thence by coach,\"\nshe said coldly, taking no heed of his irony. \"'Twere best you did not\nassume your romantic r\u00c3\u00b4le again until after your own voyage to London.\nYou can give me some money I presume. I can do nothing with an empty\npurse.\"\n\n\"You shall have the whole contents of mine, gracious Editha,\" he said\nblandly, \"some ten pounds in all, until the happy day when I can place\nhalf a million at your feet.\"\n\n\n\n\nPART II\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV\n\nTHE HOUSE IN LONDON\n\n\nIt stood about midway down an unusually narrow by-street off the Strand.\n\nA tumble-down archway, leaning to one side like a lame hen, gave access\nto a dark passage, dank with moisture, whereon the door of the house\ngave some eighteen feet up on the left.\n\nThe unpaved street, undrained and unutterably filthy, was ankle-deep in\nmud, even at the close of this hot August day. Down one side a long\nblank wall, stone-built and green with mildew, presented an unbroken\nfrontage: on the other the row of houses with doors perpetually barred,\nand windows whereon dust and grit had formed effectual curtains against\nprying eyes, added to the sense of loneliness, of insecurity, of unknown\ndangers lurking behind that crippled archway, or beneath the shadows of\nthe projecting eaves, whence the perpetual drip-drip of soot water came\nas a note of melancholy desolation.\n\nFrom all the houses the plaster was peeling off in many places, a prey\nto the inclemencies of London winters; all presented gray facades, with\nan air of eeriness about their few windows, flush with the outside\nwall--at one time painted white, no doubt, but now of uniform dinginess\nwith the rest of the plaster work.\n\nThere was a grim hint about the whole street of secret meetings, and of\nunavowable deeds done under cover of isolation and of darkness, whilst\nthe great crooked mouth of the archway disclosing the blackness and\ngloom of the passage beyond, suggested the lair of human wild beasts who\nonly went about in the night.\n\nAs a rule but few passers-by availed themselves of this short and narrow\ncut down to the river-side. Nathless, the unarmed citizen was scared by\nthese dank and dreary shadows, whilst the city watchman, mindful of his\nown safety, was wont to pass the mean street by.\n\nOnly my Lord Protector's new police-patrol fresh to its onerous task,\nsolemnly marched down it once in twenty-four hours, keeping shoulder to\nshoulder, looking neither to right nor left, thankful when either issue\nwas once more within sight.\n\nBut in this same evening in August, 1657, it seemed as if quite a number\nof people had business in Bath Street off the Strand. At any rate this\nwas specially noticeable after St. Mary's had struck the hour of nine,\nwhen several cloaked and hooded figures slipped, one after another, some\nsingly, others in groups of two or three, into the shadow of the narrow\nlane.\n\nThey all walked in silence, and did not greet one another as they\npassed; some cast from time to time furtive looks behind them; but\nevery one of these evening prowlers seemed to have the same objective,\nfor as soon as they reached the crippled archway, they disappeared\nwithin the gloom of its yawning mouth.\n\nAnon when the police-patrol had gone by and was lost in the gloom there\nwhere Bath Street debouches on the river bank, two of these heavily\ncloaked figures walked rapidly down from the Strand, and like the others\nslipped quickly under the archway, and made straight for the narrow door\non the left of the passage.\n\nThis door was provided with a heavy bronze knocker, but strangely enough\nthe newcomers did not avail themselves of its use, but rapped on the\nwooden panels with their knuckles, giving three successive raps at\nregular intervals.\n\nThey were admitted almost immediately, the door seemingly opening of\nitself, and they quickly stepped across the threshold.\n\nWithin the house was just as dark and gloomy as it was without, and as\nthe two visitors entered, a voice came from out the shadows, and said,\nin a curious monotone and with strange irrelevance:\n\n\"The hour is late!\"\n\n\"And 'twill be later still,\" replied one of the newcomers.\n\n\"Yet the cuckoo hath not called,\" retorted the voice.\n\n\"Nor is the ferret on the prowl,\" was the enigmatic reply. Whereupon\nthe voice speaking in more natural tones added sententiously:\n\n\"Two flights of steps, and 'ware the seventeenth step on the first\nflight. Door on the left, two raps, then three.\"\n\n\"Thank you, friend,\" rejoined one of the newcomers, \"'tis pleasant to\nfeel that so faithful a watch guards the entrance of this palace of\npleasure.\"\n\nThereupon the two visitors, who of a truth must have been guided either\nby instinct or by intimate knowledge of the place, for not a gleam of\nlight illumined the entrance hall, groped their way to a flight of stone\nstairs which led in a steep curve to the upper floors of the house.\n\nA rickety banister which gave ominously under the slightest pressure\nhelped to guide the visitors in this utter darkness: but obviously the\nwarning uttered by that mysterious challenging voice below was not\nsuperfluous, for having carefully counted sixteen steps in an upward\ndirection, the newcomers came to a halt, and feeling their way forward\nnow with uttermost caution, their feet met a yawning hole, which had\nsoon caused a serious accident to a stranger who had ventured thus far\nin ignorance of pitfalls.\n\nA grim laugh, echoed by a lighter one, showed that the visitors had\nencountered only what they had expected, and after this brief episode\nthey continued their journey upwards with a firmer sense of security; a\nsmoky oil lamp on the first floor landing guided their footsteps by\ncasting a flickering light on the narrow stairway, whereon slime and\nfilth crept unchecked through the broken crevices between the stones.\n\nBut now as they advanced, the silence seemed more broken: a distinct hum\nas of many voices was soon perceptible, and anon a shrill laugh,\nfollowed by another more deep in tone, and echoed by others which\npresently died away in the distance.\n\nBy the time the two men had reached the second floor landing these many\nnoises had become more accentuated, also more distinct; still muffled\nand subdued as if proceeding from behind heavy doors, but nevertheless\nobvious as the voices of men and women in lively converse.\n\nThe newcomers gave the distinctive raps prescribed by their first\nmentor, on the thick panels of a solid oak door on their left.\n\nThe next moment the door itself was thrown open from within; a flood of\nlight burst forth upon the gloomy landing from the room beyond, the\nbabel of many voices became loud and clear, and as the two men stood for\na moment beneath the lintel a veritable chorus of many exclamations\ngreeted them from every side.\n\n\"Walterton! begad!\"\n\n\"And Overbury, too!\"\n\n\"How late ye come!\"\n\n\"We thought ye'd fallen a victim to Noll's myrmidons!\"\n\nIt was of a truth a gay and merry company that stood, and moved,\nchatted and laughed, within the narrow confines of that small\nsecond-floor room in the gloomy house in Bath Street.\n\nThe walls themselves were dingy and bare, washed down with some grayish\ncolor, which had long since been defaced by the grime and dust of\nLondon. Thick curtains of a nondescript hue fell in straight folds\nbefore each window, and facing these there was another door--double\npaneled--which apparently led to an inner room.\n\nBut the place itself was brilliantly illuminated with many wax candles\nset in chandeliers. These stood on the several small tables which were\ndotted about the room.\n\nThese tables--covered with green baize, and a number of chairs of\nvarious shapes and doubtful solidity were the only furniture of the\nroom, but in an arched recess in the wall a plaster figure holding a\ncornucopia, from whence fell in thick profusion the plaster presentments\nof the fruits of this earth, stood on an elevated pedestal, which had\nbeen draped with crimson velvet.\n\nThe goddess of Fortune, with a broken nose and a paucity of fingers,\ndominated the brilliant assembly, from the height of her crimson throne.\nHer head had been crowned with a tall peaked modish beaver hat, from\nwhich a purple feather rakishly swept over the goddess's left ear. An\nardent devotee had deposited a copper coin in her extended, thumbless\nhand, whilst another had fixed a row of candle stumps at her feet.\n\nThere was nothing visible in this brilliantly lighted room of the sober\nmodes to which the eye of late had become so accustomed. Silken doublets\nof bright and even garish colors stood out in bold contrast against the\ngray monotone of the walls and hangings. Fantastic buttons, tags and\nlaces, gorgeously embroidered cuffs and collars edged with priceless\nMechlin or d'Alen\u00c3\u00a7on, bunches of ribands at knee and wrists, full\nperiwigs and over-wide boot-hose tops were everywhere to be seen, whilst\nthe clink of swords against the wooden boards and frequent volleys of\nloudly spoken French oaths, testified to the absence of those Puritanic\nfashions and customs which had become the general rule even in London.\n\nSome of the company sat in groups round the green-topped tables whereon\ncards or dice and heaps of gold and smaller coins lay in profusion.\nOthers stood about watching the games or chatting to one another. Mostly\nmen they were, some old, some young--but there were women too, women in\nshowy kirtles, with bare shoulders showing well above the colverteen\nkerchief and faces wherein every line had been obliterated by plentiful\ndaubs of cosmetics. They moved about the room from table to table,\nlaughing, talking, making comments on the games as these proceeded.\n\nThe men apparently were all intent--either as actual participants or\nmerely as spectators--upon a form of amusement which His Highness the\nLord Protector had condemned as wanton and contrary to law.\n\nThe newcomers soon divested themselves of their immense dark cloaks,\nand they, too, appeared in showy apparel of silk and satin, with tiny\nbows of ribands at the ends of the long curls which fell both sides of\ntheir faces, and with enormous frills of lace inside the turned-over\ntops of their boots.\n\nLord Walterton quite straddled in his gait, so wide were his boot tops,\nand there was an extraordinary maze of tags and ribands round the edge\nof Sir James Overbury's breeches.\n\n\"Make your game, gentlemen, make your game,\" said the latter as he\nadvanced further into the room. And his tired, sleepy eyes brightened at\nsight of the several tables covered with cards and dice, the guttering\ncandles, the mountains of gold and small coin scattered on the green\nbaize tops.\n\n\"Par Dieu! but 'tis a sight worth seeing after the ugly sour faces one\nmeets in town these days!\" he added, gleefully rubbing his beringed\nhands one against the other.\n\n\"But where is our gracious hostess?\" added Lord Walterton, a\nmelancholy-looking young man with pale-colored eyes and lashes, and a\nnarrow chest.\n\n\"You are thrice welcome, my lord!\" said Editha de Chavasse, whose\nelegant figure now detached itself from amongst her guests.\n\nShe looked very handsome in her silken kirtle of a brilliant greenish\nhue, lace primer, and high-heeled shoes--relics of her theatrical days;\nher head was adorned with the bunches of false curls which the modish\nhairdressers were trying to introduce. The plentiful use of cosmetics\nhad obliterated the ravages of time and imparted a youthful appearance\nto her face, whilst excitement not unmixed with apprehension lent a\nbright glitter to her dark eyes.\n\nLord Walterton and Sir James Overbury lightly touched with their lips\nthe hand which she extended to them. Their bow, too, was slight, though\nthey tossed their curls as they bent their heads in the most approved\nFrench fashion. But there was a distinct note of insolence, not\naltogether unmixed with irony, in the freedom with which they had\ngreeted her.\n\n\"I met de Chavasse in town to-day,\" said Lord Walterton, over his\nshoulder before he mixed with the crowd.\n\n\"Yes! he will be here to-night,\" she rejoined. Sir James Overbury also\nmade a casual remark, but it was evident that the intention and purpose\nof these gay gentlemen was not the courteous entertainment of their\nhostess. Like so many men of all times and all nations in this world,\nthey were ready enough to enjoy what she provided for them--the illicit\npastime which they could not get elsewhere--but they despised her for\ngiving it them, and cared naught for the heavy risks she ran in keeping\nup this house for their pleasure.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV\n\nA GAME OF PRIMERO\n\n\nAt a table in the immediate center of the room a rotund gentleman in\ndoublet and breeches of cinnamon brown taffeta and voluminous lace cuffs\nat the wrists was presiding over a game of Spanish primero.\n\nA simple game enough, not difficult of comprehension, yet vastly\nexciting, if one may form a judgment of its qualities through watching\nthe faces of the players.\n\nThe rotund gentleman dealt a card face downwards to each of his\nopponents, who then looked at their cards and staked on them, by pushing\nlittle piles of gold or silver forward.\n\nThen the dealer turned up his own card, and gave the amount of the\nrespective stakes to those players whose cards were of higher value than\nhis own, whilst sweeping all other moneys to swell his own pile.\n\nA simple means, forsooth, of getting rid of any superfluity of cash.\n\n\"Art winning, Endicott?\" queried Lord Walterton as, he stood over the\nother man, looking down on the game.\n\nEndicott shrugged his fat shoulders, and gave an enigmatic chuckle.\n\n\"I pay King and Ace only,\" he called out imperturbably, as he turned up\na Queen.\n\nMost of the stakes came to swell his own pile, but he passed a handful\nof gold to a hollow-eyed youth who sat immediately opposite to him, and\nwho clutched at the money with an eager, trembling grasp.\n\n\"You have all the luck to-night, Segrave,\" he said with an oily smile\ndirected at the winner.\n\n\"Make your game, gentlemen,\" he added almost directly, as he once more\nbegan to deal.\n\n\"I pay knave upwards!\" he declared, turning up the ten of clubs.\n\n\"Mine is the ten of hearts,\" quoth one of the players.\n\n\"Ties pay the bank,\" quoth Endicott imperturbably.\n\n\"Mine is a queen,\" said Segrave in a hollow tone of voice.\n\nEndicott with a comprehensive oath threw the entire pack of cards into a\ndistant corner of the room.\n\n\"A fresh pack, mistress!\" he shouted peremptorily.\n\nThen as an overdressed, florid woman, with high bullhead fringe and\nold-fashioned Spanish farthingale, quickly obeyed his behests, he said\nwith a coarse laugh:\n\n\"Fresh cards may break Master Segrave's luck and improve yours, Sir\nMichael.\"\n\n\"Before this round begins,\" said Sir James Overbury who was standing\nclose behind Lord Walterton, also watching the game, \"I will bet you,\nWalterton, that Segrave wins again.\"\n\n\"Done with you,\" replied the other, \"and I'll back mine own opinion by\ntaking a hand.\"\n\nThe florid woman brought him a chair, and he sat down at the table, as\nEndicott once more began to deal.\n\n\"Five pounds that Segrave wins,\" said Overbury.\n\n\"A queen,\" said Endicott, turning up his card. \"I pay king and ace\nonly.\"\n\nEveryone had to pay the bank, for all turned up low cards; Segrave alone\nhad not yet turned up his.\n\n\"Well! what is your card, Master Segrave?\" queried Lord Walterton\nlightly.\n\n\"An ace!\" said Segrave simply, displaying the ace of hearts.\n\n\"No good betting against the luck,\" said young Walterton lightly, as he\nhanded five sovereigns over to his friend, \"moreover it spoils my\nsystem.\"\n\n\"Ye play primero on a system!\" quoth Sir Michael Isherwood in deep\namazement.\n\n\"Yes!\" replied the young man. \"I have played on it for years ... and it\nis infallible, 'pon my honor.\"\n\nIn the meanwhile the doors leading to the second room had been thrown\nopen; serving men and women advanced carrying trays on which were\ndisplayed glasses and bottles filled with Rhenish wine and Spanish\ncanary and muscadel, also buttered ale and mead and hypocras for the\nladies.\n\nEditha did not occupy herself with serving but the florid woman was\nmost attentive to the guests. She darted in and out between the tables,\nmanaging her unwieldy farthingale with amazing skill. She poured out the\nwines, and offered tarts and dishes of anchovies and of cheese, also\nstrange steaming beverages lately imported into England called coffee\nand chocolate.\n\nThe women liked the latter, and supped it out of mugs, with many little\ncries of astonishment and appreciation of its sugariness.\n\nThe men drank heavily, chiefly of the heady Spanish wines; they ate the\nanchovies and cheese with their fingers, and continually called for more\nrefreshments.\n\nPlay was of necessity interrupted. Groups of people eating and drinking\ncongregated round the tables. The men mostly discussed various phases of\nthe game; there was so little else for idlers to talk about these days.\nNo comedies or other diversions, neither cock-fighting nor bear-baiting,\nand abuse of my Lord Protector and his rigorous disciplinarian laws had\nalready become stale.\n\nThe women talked dress and coiffure, the new puffs, the fanciful\npinners.\n\nBut at the center table Segrave still sat, refusing all refreshment,\nwaiting with obvious impatience for the ending of this unwelcome\ninterval. When first he found himself isolated in the crowd, he had\ncounted over with febrile eagerness the money which lay in a substantial\nheap before him.\n\n\"Saved!\" he muttered between his teeth, speaking to himself like one\nwho is dreaming, \"saved! Thank God! ... Two hundred and fifty pounds ...\nonly another fifty and I'll never touch these cursed cards again ...\nonly another fifty....\"\n\nHe buried his face in his hands; the moisture stood out in heavy drops\non his forehead. He looked all round him with ever-growing impatience.\n\n\"My God! why don't they come back! ... Another fifty pounds ... and I\ncan put the money back ... before it has been missed.... Oh! why don't\nthey come back!\"\n\nQuite a tragedy expressed in those few muttered words, in the trembling\nhands, the damp forehead. Money taken from an unsuspecting parent,\nguardian or master, which? What matter? A tragedy of ordinary occurrence\neven in those days when social inequalities were being abolished by act\nof Parliament.\n\nIn the meanwhile Lord Walterton, halting of speech, insecure of\nfoothold, after his third bumper of heady sack, was explaining to Sir\nMichael Isherwood the mysteries of his system for playing the noble game\nof primero.\n\n\"It is sure to break the bank in time,\" he said confidently, \"I am for\ngoing to Paris where play runs high, and need not be carried on in this\nhole and corner fashion to suit cursed Puritanical ideas.\"\n\n\"Tell me your secret, Walterton,\" urged worthy Sir Michael, whose broad\nShropshire acres were heavily mortgaged, after the rapine and pillage\nof civil war.\n\n\"Well! I can but tell you part, my friend,\" rejoined the other, \"yet\n'tis passing simple. You begin with one golden guinea ... and lose it\n... then you put up two and lose again....\"\n\n\"Passing simple,\" assented Sir Michael ironically.\n\n\"But after that you put up four guineas.\"\n\n\"And lose it.\"\n\n\"Yea! yea! mayhap you lose it ... but then you put up eight guineas ...\nand win. Whereupon you are just as you were before.\"\n\nAnd with a somewhat unsteady hand the young man raised a bumper to his\nlips, whilst eying Sir Michael with the shifty and inquiring eye\npeculiar to the intoxicated.\n\n\"Meseems that if you but abstain from playing altogether,\" quoth Sir\nMichael impatiently, \"the result would still be the same.... And suppose\nyou lose the eight guineas, what then?\"\n\n\"Oh! 'tis vastly simple--you put up sixteen.\"\n\n\"But if you lose that?\"\n\n\"Put up thirty-two....\"\n\n\"But if you have not thirty-two guineas to put up?\" urged Sir Michael,\nwho was obstinate.\n\n\"Nay! then, my friend,\" said Lord Walterton with a laugh which soon\nbroke into an ominous hiccough, \"ye must not in that case play upon my\nsystem.\"\n\n\"Well said, my lord,\" here interposed Endicott, who had most moderately\npartaken of a cup of hypocras, and whose eye and hand were as steady as\nheretofore. \"Well said, pardi! ... My old friend the Marquis of\nSwarthmore used oft to say in the good old days of Goring's Club, that\n'twas better to lose on a system, than to play on no system at all.\"\n\n\"A smart cavalier, old Swarthmore,\" assented Sir Michael gruffly, \"and\nnathless, a true friend to you, Endicott,\" he added significantly.\n\n\"Another deal, Master Endicott,\" said Segrave, who for the last quarter\nof an hour had vainly tried to engage the bank-holder's attention.\n\nNor was Lord Walterton averse to this. The more the wine got into his\nhead, the more unsteady his hand became, the more strong was his desire\nto woo the goddess whose broken-nosed image seemed to be luring him to\nfortune.\n\n\"You are right, Master Segrave,\" he said thickly, \"we are wasting\nvaluable time. Who knows but what old Noll's police-patrol is lurking in\nthis cutthroat alley? ... Endicott, take the bank again.... I'll swear\nI'll ruin ye ere the moon--which I do not see--disappears down the\nhorizon. Sir Michael, try my system.... Overbury, art a laggard? ... Let\nus laugh and be merry--to-morrow is the Jewish Sabbath--and after that\nPuritanic Sunday ... after which mayhap, we'll all go to hell, driven\nthither by my Lord Protector. Wench, another bumper ... canary, sack or\nmuscadel ... no thin Rhenish wine shall e'er defile this throat!\nGentlemen, take your places.... Mistress Endicott, can none of these\nwenches discourse sweet music whilst we do homage to the goddess of\nFortune? ... To the tables ... to the tables, gentlemen ... here's to\nKing Charles, whom may God protect ... and all in defiance of my Lord\nProtector!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI\n\nA CONFLICT\n\n\nIn the hubbub which immediately followed Lord Walterton's tirade, Editha\nde Chavasse beckoned to the florid woman--who seemed to be her\nhenchwoman--and drew her aside to a distant corner of the room, where\nthere were no tables nigh and where the now subdued hum of the voices,\nmingling with the sound of music on virginal and stringed instruments,\nmade a murmuring noise which effectually drowned the talk between the\ntwo women.\n\n\"Have you arranged everything, Mistress Endicott?\" asked Editha,\nspeaking in a whisper.\n\n\"Everything, mistress,\" replied the other.\n\n\"Endicott understands?\"\n\n\"Perfectly,\" said the woman, with perceptible hesitation, \"but ...\"\n\n\"What ails you, mistress?\" asked Editha haughtily, noting the\nhesitation, and frowning with impatience thereat.\n\n\"My husband thinks the game too dangerous.\"\n\n\"I was not aware,\" retorted Mistress de Chavasse dryly, \"that I had\ndesired Master Endicott's opinion on the subject.\"\n\n\"Mayhap not,\" rejoined the other, equally dryly, \"but you did desire his\nhelp in the matter ... and he seems unmindful to give it.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"I have explained ... the game is too dangerous.\"\n\n\"Or the payment insufficient?\" sneered Editha. \"Which is it?\"\n\n\"Both, mayhap,\" assented Mistress Endicott with a careless shrug of her\nfat shoulders, \"the risks are very great. To-night especially....\"\n\n\"Why especially to-night?\"\n\n\"Because ever since you have been away from it, this house--though we\ndid our best to make it seem deserted--hath been watched--of that I feel\nvery sure.... My Lord Protector's watchmen have a suspicion of our ...\nour evening entertainments ... and I doubt not but that they desire to\nsee for themselves how our guests enjoy themselves these nights.\"\n\n\"Well?\" rejoined Editha lightly. \"What of that?\"\n\n\"As you know, we did not play for nigh on twelve months now.... Endicott\nthought it too dangerous ... and to-night ...\"\n\nShe checked herself abruptly, for Editha had turned an angry face and\nflashing eyes upon her.\n\n\"To-night?\" said Mistress de Chavasse curtly, but peremptorily, \"what of\nto-night? ... I sent you orders from Thanet that I wished the house\nopened to-night ... Lord Walterton, Sir James Overbury and as many of\nour usual friends as were in the town, apprised that play would be in\nfull progress.... Meseems,\" she added, casting a searching look all\nround the room, \"that we have singularly few players.\"\n\n\"It was difficult,\" retorted the other with somewhat more diffidence in\nher tone than had characterized her speech before now. \"Young Squire\nDelamere committed suicide ... you remember him? ... and Lord Cooke\nkilled Sir Humphrey Clinton in a duel after that fracas we had here,\nwhen the police-patrol well-nigh seized upon your person.... Squire\nDelamere's suicide and Sir Humphrey's death caused much unpleasant talk.\nAnd old Mistress Delamere, the mother, hath I fear me, still a watchful\neye on us. She means to do us lasting mischief.... It had been wiser to\ntarry yet awhile.... Twelve months is not sufficient for throwing the\ndust of ages over us and our doings.... That is my husband's opinion and\nalso mine.... A scandal such as you propose to have to-night, will bring\nthe Protector's spies about our ears ... his police too, mayhap ... and\nthen Heaven help us all, mistress ... for you, in the country, cannot\nconceive how rigorously are the laws enforced now against gambling,\nbetting, swearing or any other form of innocent amusement.... Why! two\nwenches were whipped at the post by the public hangman only last week,\nbecause forsooth they were betting on the winner amongst themselves,\nwhilst watching a bout of pell-mell.... And you know that John Howthill\nstood in the pillory for two hours and had both his hands bored through\nwith a hot iron for allowing gambling inside his coffeehouse. ... And\nso, mistress, you will perceive that I am speaking but in your own\ninterests....\"\n\nEditha, who had listened to the long tirade with marked impatience, here\ninterrupted the voluble lady, with harsh command.\n\n\"I crave your pardon, mistress,\" she said peremptorily. \"My interests\npre-eminently consist in being obeyed by those whom I pay for doing my\nbehests. Now you and your worthy husband live here rent free and derive\na benefit of ten pounds every time our guests assemble.... Well! in\nreturn for that, I make use of you and your names, in case of any\nunpleasantness with the vigilance patrol ... or in case of a scandal\nwhich might reach my Lord Protector's ears.... Up to this time your\npositions here have been a sinecure.... I even bore the brunt of the\nlast fracas whilst you remained practically scathless.... But to-night,\nI own it, there may be some risks ... but of a truth you have been well\npaid to take them.\"\n\n\"But if we refuse to take the risks,\" retorted the other.\n\n\"If you refuse, mistress,\" said Editha with a careless shrug of the\nshoulders, \"you and your worthy lord go back to the gutter where I\npicked you up ... and within three months of that time, I should\ndoubtless have the satisfaction of seeing you both at the whipping-post,\nfor of a truth you would be driven to stealing or some other equally\nunavowable means of livelihood.\"\n\n\"We could send _you_ there,\" said Mistress Endicott, striving to\nsuppress her own rising fury, \"if we but said the word.\"\n\n\"Nay! you would not be believed, mistress ... but even so, I do not\nperceive how my social ruin would benefit you.\"\n\n\"Since we are doomed anyhow ... after this night's work,\" said the woman\nsullenly.\n\n\"Nay! but why should you take so gloomy a view of the situation? ... My\nLord Protector hath forgot our existence by now, believe me ... and of a\nsurety his patrol hath not yet knocked at our door.... And methinks,\nmistress,\" added Editha significantly, \"'tis not in _your_ interest to\nquarrel with me.\"\n\n\"I have no wish to quarrel with you,\" quoth Mistress Endicott, who\napparently had come to the end of her resistance, and no doubt had known\nall along that her fortunes were too much bound up with those of\nMistress de Chavasse to allow of a rupture between them.\n\n\"Then everything is vastly satisfactory,\" said Editha with forced\ngayety. \"I rely on you, mistress, and on Endicott's undoubted talents to\nbring this last matter to a successful issue to-night. ... Remember,\nmistress ... I rely on you.\"\n\nPerhaps Mistress Endicott would have liked to prolong the argument. As a\nmatter of fact, neither she nor her husband counted the risks of a\nmidnight fracas of great moment to themselves: they had so very little\nto lose. A precarious existence based on illicit deeds of all sorts had\nrendered them hard and reckless.\n\nAll they wished was to be well paid for the risks they ran; neither of\nthem was wholly unacquainted with the pillory, and it held no great\nterrors for them. There were so many unavowable pleasures these days,\nwhich required a human cloak to cover the identity of the real\ntransgressor, that people like Master and Mistress Endicott prospered\nvastly.\n\nThe case of Mistress de Chavasse's London house wherein the ex-actress\nhad some few years ago established a gaming club, together with its\nvarious emoluments attached thereunto, suited the Endicotts'\nrequirements to perfection: but the woman desired an increase of payment\nfor the special risk she would run to-night, and was sorely vexed that\nshe could not succeed in intimidating Editha with threats of\nvigilance-patrol and whipping-posts.\n\nMistress de Chavasse knew full well that the Endicotts did not intend to\nquarrel with her, and having threatened rupture unless her commands were\nobeyed, she had no wish to argue the matter further with her henchwoman.\n\nAt that moment, too, there came the sound of significant and methodical\nrappings at the door. Editha, who had persistently throughout her\ndiscussion with Mistress Endicott, kept one ear open for that sound,\nheard it even through the buzz of talk. She made a scarcely visible\ngesture of the hand, bidding the other woman to follow her: that gesture\nwas quickly followed by a look of command.\n\nMistress Endicott presumably had finally made up her mind to obey. She\nshrugged her fat shoulders and followed Mistress de Chavasse as far as\nthe center of the room.\n\n\"Remember that you are the hostess now,\" murmured Editha to her, as she\nherself went to the door and opened it.\n\nWith an affected cry of surprise and pleasure she welcomed Sir Marmaduke\nde Chavasse, who was standing on the threshold, prepared to enter and\nescorted by his young secretary, Master Richard Lambert.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII\n\nRUS IN URBE\n\n\nOne or two of the men looked up as de Chavasse entered, but no one took\nmuch notice of him.\n\nMost of those present remembered him from the past few years when still\nwith pockets well filled through having forestalled Lady Sue's\nmaintenance money, he was an habitual frequenter of some of the smart\nsecret clubs in town; but here, just the same as elsewhere, Sir\nMarmaduke was not a popular man, and many there were who had unpleasant\nrecollections of his surly temper and uncouth ways, whenever fickle\nFortune happened not to favor him.\n\nEven now, he looked sullen and disagreeable as, having exchanged a\nsignificant glance with his sister-in-law, he gave a comprehensive nod\nto the assembled guests, which had nothing in it either of cordiality or\nof good-will. He touched Editha's finger tips with his lips, and then\nadvanced into the room.\n\nHere he was met by Mistress Endicott, who had effectually thrown off the\nlast vestige of annoyance and of rebellion, for she greeted the newcomer\nwith marked good-humor and an encouraging smile.\n\n\"It is indeed a pleasure to see that Sir Marmaduke de Chavasse hath not\nforgot old friends,\" she said pleasantly.\n\n\"It was passing kind, gracious mistress,\" he responded, forcing himself\nto speak naturally and in agreeable tones, \"to remember an insignificant\ncountry bumpkin like myself ... and you see I have presumed on your\nlavish hospitality and brought my young friend, Master Richard Lambert,\nto whom you extended so gracious an invitation.\"\n\nHe turned to Lambert, who a little dazed to find himself in such\nbrilliant company, had somewhat timidly kept close to the heels of his\nemployer. He thought Mistress Endicott vulgar and overdressed the moment\nhe felt bold enough to raise his eyes to hers. But he chided himself\nimmediately for thus daring to criticize his betters.\n\nHis horizon so far had been very limited; only quite vaguely had he\nheard of town and Court life. The little cottage where dwelt the old\nQuakeress who had brought him and his brother up, and the tumble-down,\ndilapidated house of Sir Marmaduke de Chavasse were the only habitations\nin which he was intimate. The neighboring Kentish Squires, Sir Timothy\nHarrison, Squire Pyncheon and Sir John Boatfield, were the only\npresentations of \"gentlemen\" he had ever seen.\n\nSir Marmaduke de Chavasse had somewhat curtly given him orders the day\nbefore, that he was to accompany him to London, whither he himself had\nto go to consult his lawyer. Lambert had naturally obeyed, without\nmurmur, but with vague trepidations at thought of this, his first\njourney into the great town.\n\nSir Marmaduke had been very kind, had given him a new suit of grogram,\nlined with flowered silk, which Lambert thought the richest garment he\nhad ever seen. He was very loyal in his thoughts to his employer,\nbearing with the latter's violence and pandering to his fits of\nill-humor for the sake of the home which Sir Marmaduke had provided for\nhim.\n\nTo Lambert's mind, Sir Marmaduke's kindness to him was wholly\ngratuitous. His own position as secretary being but a sinecure, the\nyoung man readily attributed de Chavasse's interest in himself to innate\ngoodness of heart, and desire to help the poor orphan lad.\n\nThis estimate of his employer's character Richard Lambert had not felt\nany cause to modify. He continued to serve him faithfully, to look after\nhis interests in and around Acol Court to the best of his ability; above\nall he continued to be whole-heartedly grateful. He was so absolutely\nconscious of the impassable social barrier which existed between himself\nand the rich daughter of the great Earl of Dover, that he never for a\nmoment resented Sir Marmaduke's sneers when they were directed against\nhis obvious, growing love for Sue.\n\nRemember that he had no cause to suspect Sir Marmaduke de Chavasse of\nany nefarious projects or of any evil intentions with regard to himself,\nwhen he told him that together they would go this night to the house of\nan old friend, Mrs. Endicott, where they would derive much pleasure and\nentertainment.\n\nThey had spent the previous night at the Swan Inn in Fleet Street and\nthe day in visiting the beautiful sights of London, which caused the\nyoung lad from the country to open wide eyes in astonishment and\npleasure.\n\nSir Marmaduke had been peculiarly gracious, even taking Richard with him\nto the Frenchman's house in Queen's Head Alley, where that curious\nbeverage called coffee was dispensed and where several clever people met\nand discussed politics in a manner which was vastly interesting to the\nyoung man.\n\nThen when the evening began to draw in, and Lambert thought it high time\nto go to bed, for 'twas a pity to burn expensive candles longer than was\nnecessary, Sir Marmaduke had astonished his secretary by telling him\nthat he must now clean and tidy himself for they would proceed to the\nhouse of a great lady named Mistress Endicott--a friend of the ex-Queen\nHenrietta Maria and a lady of peculiar virtues and saintliness, who\nwould give them vast and pleasing entertainment.\n\nLambert was only too ready to obey. Enjoyment came naturally to him\nbeneath his Quaker bringing-up: his youth, good-health and pure,\nnaturally noble intellect, all craved companionship, with its attendant\npleasures and joys. He himself could not afterwards have said exactly\nhow he had pictured in his mind the saintly lady--friend of the unhappy\nQueen--whom he was to meet this night.\n\nCertainly Mistress Endicott, with her red face surmounted by masses of\ncurls that were obviously false, since they did not match the rest of\nher hair, was not the ideal paragon of all the virtues, and when he was\nfirst made to greet her, a strange, unreasoning instinct seemed to draw\nhim away from her, to warn him to fly from this noisy company, from the\nsight of those many faces, all unnaturally flushed, and from the sounds\nof those strange oaths which greeted his ears from every side.\n\nA great wave of thankfulness came over him that, his gracious\nlady--innocent, tender, beautiful Lady Sue, had not come to London with\nher guardian. Whilst he gazed on the marvels of Westminster Hall and of\nold Saint Paul's he had longed that she should be near him, so that he\nmight watch the brilliance of her eyes, and the glow of pleasure which,\nof a surety would have mantled in her cheeks when she was shown the\nbeauties of the great city.\n\nBut now he was glad--very glad, that Sir Marmaduke had so sternly\nordained that she should remain these few days alone at Acol in charge\nof Mistress Charity and of Master Busy. At the time he had chafed\nbitterly at his own enforced silence: he would have given all he\npossessed in the world for the right to warn Sir Marmaduke de Chavasse\nthat a wolf was prowling in the fold under cover of the night. He had\nseen Lady Sue's eyes brighten at the dictum that she was to remain\nbehind--they told him in eloquent language the joy she felt to be free\nfor two days that she might meet her prince undisturbed.\n\nBut all these thoughts and fears had fled the moment Lambert found\nhimself in the midst of these people, whom he innocently believed to be\ngreat ladies and noble gentlemen, friends of his employer Sir Marmaduke\nde Chavasse. It seemed to him at once as if there was something here--in\nthis room--which he would not wish Lady Sue to see.\n\nHe was clumsy and _gauche_ in his movements as he took the hand which\nMistress Endicott extended to him, but he tried to imitate the salute\nwhich he had seen his employer give on the flat--not very\nclean--finger-tips of the lady.\n\nShe was exceedingly gracious to him, saying with great kindliness and a\nmelancholy sigh:\n\n\"Ah! you come from the country, master? ... So delightful, of a\ntruth.... Milk for breakfast, eh? ... You get up at dawn and go to bed\nat sunset? ... I know country life well--though alas! duty now keeps me\nin town.... But 'tis small wonder that you look so young!\"\n\nHe tried to talk to her of the country, for here she had touched on a\ntopic which was dear to him. He knew all about the birds and beasts, the\nforests and the meadows, and being unused to the art of hypocritical\ninterest, he took for real sympathy the lady's vapid exclamations of\nenthusiasm, with which she broke in now and again upon his flow of\neloquence.\n\nSir Marmaduke de Chavasse, who was watching the young man with febrile\nkeenness, had the satisfaction to note that very soon Richard began to\nthrow off his bucolic timidity, his latent yet distinctly perceptible\ndisapproval of the company into which he had been brought. He sought out\nhis sister-in-law and drew her attention to Lambert in close\nconversation with Mrs. Endicott.\n\n\"Is everything arranged?\" he asked under his breath.\n\n\"Everything,\" she replied.\n\n\"No trouble with our henchmen?\"\n\n\"A little ... but they are submissive now.\"\n\n\"What is the arrangement?\"\n\n\"Persuade young Lambert to take a hand at primero ... Endicott will do\nthe rest.\"\n\n\"Who is in the know?\" he queried, after a slight pause, during which he\nwatched his unsuspecting victim with a deep frown of impatience and of\nhate.\n\n\"Only the Endicotts,\" she explained. \"But do you think that he will\nplay?\" she added, casting an anxious look on her brother-in-law's face.\n\nHe nodded affirmatively.\n\n\"Yes!\" he said curtly. \"I can arrange that, as soon as you are ready.\"\n\nShe turned from him and walked to the center table. She watched the game\nfor a while, noting that young Segrave was still the winner, and that\nLord Walterton was very flushed and excited.\n\nThen she caught Endicott's eye, and immediately lowered her lashes\ntwice in succession.\n\n\"Ventre-saint-gris!\" swore Endicott with an unmistakable British accent\nin the French expletive, \"but I'll play no more.... The bank is broken\n... and I have lost too much money. Mr. Segrave there has nearly cleaned\nme out and still I cannot break his luck.\"\n\nHe rose abruptly from his chair, even as Mistress de Chavasse quietly\nwalked away from the table.\n\nBut Lord Walterton placed a detaining, though very trembling hand, on\nthe cinnamon-colored sleeve.\n\n\"Nay! parbleu! ye cannot go like this ... good Master Endicott ...\" he\nsaid, speaking very thickly, \"I want another round or two ... 'pon my\nhonor I do ... I haven't lost nearly all I meant to lose.\"\n\n\"Ye cannot stop play so abruptly, master,\" said Segrave, whose eyes\nshone with an unnatural glitter, and whose cheeks were covered with a\nhectic flush, \"ye cannot leave us all in the lurch.\"\n\n\"Nay, I doubt not, my young friend,\" quoth Endicott gruffly, \"that you\nwould wish to play all night.... You have won all my money and Lord\nWalterton's, too.\"\n\n\"And most of mine,\" added Sir Michael Isherwood ruefully.\n\n\"Why should not Master Segrave take the bank,\" here came in shrill\naccents from Mistress Endicott, who throughout her conversation with\nLambert had kept a constant eye on what went on around her husband's\ntable. \"He seems the only moneyed man amongst you all,\" she added with a\nlaugh, which grated most unpleasantly on Richard's ear.\n\n\"I will gladly take the bank,\" said Segrave eagerly.\n\n\"Pardi! I care not who hath the bank,\" quoth Lord Walterton, with the\nslow emphasis of the inebriated. \"My system takes time to work.... And I\nstand to lose a good deal unless ... hic ... unless I win!\"\n\n\"You are not where you were, when you began,\" commented Sir Michael\ngrimly.\n\n\"By Gad, no! ... hic ... but 'tis no matter.... Give me time!\"\n\n\"Methought I saw Sir Marmaduke de Chavasse just now,\" said Endicott,\nlooking about him. \"Ah! and here comes our worthy baronet,\" he added\ncheerily as Sir Marmaduke's closely cropped head--very noticeable in the\ncrowd of periwigs--emerged from amidst the group that clustered round\nMistress Endicott. \"A hand at primero, sir?\"\n\n\"I thank you, no!\" replied Sir Marmaduke, striving to master his\nhabitual ill-humor and to speak pleasantly. \"My luck hath long since\ndeserted me, if it e'er visited me at all. A fact of which I grow daily\nmore doubtful.\"\n\n\"But ventre-saint-gris!\" ejaculated Lord Walterton, who showed an\ninclination to become quarrelsome in his cups, \"we must have someone to\ntake Endicott's place, I cannot work my system hic ... if so few\nplay....\"\n\n\"Perhaps your young friend, Sir Marmaduke ...\" suggested Mistress\nEndicott, waving an embroidered handkerchief in the direction of Richard\nLambert.\n\n\"No doubt! no doubt!\" rejoined Sir Marmaduke, turning with kindly\ngraciousness to his secretary. \"Master Lambert, these gentlemen are\nrequiring another hand for their game ... I pray you join in with\nthem....\"\n\n\"I would do so with pleasure, sir,\" replied Lambert, still unsuspecting,\n\"but I fear me I am a complete novice at cards.... What is the game?\"\n\nHe was vaguely distrustful of cards, for he had oft heard this pastime\ncondemned as ungodly by those with whom he had held converse in his\nearly youth, nevertheless it did not occur to him that there might be\nanything wrong in a game which was countenanced by Sir Marmaduke de\nChavasse, whom he knew to be an avowed Puritan, and by the saintly lady\nwho had been the friend of ex-Queen Henrietta Maria.\n\n\"'Tis a simple round game,\" said Sir Marmaduke lightly, \"you would soon\nlearn.\"\n\n\"And ...\" said Lambert diffidently questioning, and eying the gold and\nsilver which lay in profusion on the table, \"there is no money at stake\n... of course? ...\"\n\n\"Oh! only a little,\" rejoined Mistress Endicott, \"a paltry trifle ...\nto add zest to the enjoyment of the game.\"\n\n\"However little it may be, Sir Marmaduke,\" said Lambert firmly, speaking\ndirectly to his employer, \"I humbly pray you to excuse me before these\ngentlemen ...\"\n\nThe three players at the table, as well as the two Endicotts, had\nlistened to this colloquy with varying feelings. Segrave was burning\nwith impatience, Lord Walterton was getting more and more fractious,\nwhilst Sir Michael Isherwood viewed the young secretary with marked\nhauteur. At the last words spoken by Lambert there came from all these\ngentlemen sundry ejaculations, expressive of contempt or annoyance,\nwhich caused an ugly frown to appear between de Chavasse's eyes, and a\ndeep blush to rise in the young man's pale cheek.\n\n\"What do you mean?\" queried Sir Marmaduke harshly.\n\n\"There are other gentlemen here,\" said Lambert, speaking with more\nfirmness and decision now that he encountered inimical glances and felt\nas if somehow he was on his trial before all these people, \"and I am not\nrich enough to afford the luxury of gambling.\"\n\n\"Nay! if that is your difficulty,\" rejoined Sir Marmaduke, \"I pray you,\ngood master, to command my purse ... you are under my wing to-night ...\nand I will gladly bear the burden of your losses.\"\n\n\"I thank you, Sir Marmaduke,\" said the young man, with quiet dignity,\"\nand I entreat you once again to excuse me.... I have never staked at\ncards, either mine own money or that of others. I would prefer not to\nbegin.\"\n\n\"Meseems ... hic ... de Chavasse, that this ... this young friend of\nyours is a hic ... damned Puritan ...\" came in ever thickening accents\nfrom Lord Walterton.\n\n\"I hope, Sir Marmaduke de Chavasse,\" here interposed Endicott with much\npompous dignity, \"that your ... hem ... your young friend doth not\ndesire to bring insinuations doubts, mayhap, against the honor of my\nhouse ... or of my friends!\"\n\n\"Nay! nay! good Endicott,\" said Sir Marmaduke, speaking in tones that\nwere so conciliatory, so unlike his own quarrelsome temper, quick at\ntaking offense, that Richard Lambert could not help wondering what was\ncausing this change, \"Master Lambert hath no such intention--'pon my\nhonor ... He is young ... and ... and he misunderstands.... You see, my\ngood Lambert,\" he added, once more turning to the young man, and still\nspeaking with unwonted kindness and patience, \"you are covering yourself\nwith ridicule and placing me--who am your protector to-night--in a very\nawkward position. Had I known you were such a gaby I should have left\nyou to go to bed alone.\"\n\n\"Nay! Sir Marmaduke,\" here came in decisive accents from portly\nMistress Endicott, \"methinks 'tis you who misunderstand Master Lambert.\nHe is of a surety an honorable gentleman, and hath no desire to insult\nme, who have ne'er done him wrong, nor yet my friends by refusing a\nfriendly game of cards in my house!\"\n\nShe spoke very pointedly, causing her speech to seem like a menace, even\nthough the words betokened gentleness and friendship.\n\nLambert's scruples and his desire to please struggled hopelessly in his\nmind. Mistress Endicott's eye held him silent even while it urged him to\nspeak. What could he say? Sir Marmaduke, toward whom he felt gratitude\nand respect, surely would not urge what he thought would be wrong for\nLambert.\n\nAnd if a chaste and pure woman did not disapprove of a game of primero\namong friends, what right had he to set up his own standard of right or\nwrong against hers? What right had he to condemn what she approved? To\noffend his generous employer, and to bring opprobrium and ridicule on\nhimself which would of necessity redound against Sir Marmaduke also?\n\nVague instinct still entered a feeble protest, but reason and common\nsense and a certain undetermined feeling of what was due to himself\nsocially--poor country bumpkin!--fought a hard battle too.\n\n\"I am right, am I not, good Master Lambert?\" came in dulcet tones from\nthe virtuous hostess, \"that you would not really refuse a quiet game of\ncards with my friends, at my entreaty ... in my house?\"\n\nAnd Lambert, with a self-deprecatory sigh, and a shrug of the shoulders,\nsaid quietly:\n\n\"I have no option, gracious mistress!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII\n\nTHE TRAP\n\n\nRichard Lambert fortunately for his own peace of mind and the retention\nof his dignity, was able to wave aside the hand full of gold and silver\ncoins which Sir Marmaduke extended towards him.\n\n\"I thank you, sir,\" he said calmly; \"I am able to bear the cost of mine\nown unavoidable weakness. I have money of mine own.\"\n\nFrom out his doublet he took a tiny leather wallet containing a few gold\ncoins, his worldly all bequeathed to him the same as to his brother--so\nthe old friend who had brought the lads up had oft explained--by his\ngrandmother. The little satchel never left his person from the moment\nthat the old Quakeress had placed it in his hands. There were but five\nguineas in all, to which he had added from time to time the few\nshillings which Sir Marmaduke paid him as salary.\n\nHe chided his own weakness inwardly, when he felt the hot tears surging\nto his eyes at thought of the unworthy use to which his little hoard was\nabout to be put.\n\nBut he walked to the table with a bold step; there was nothing now of\nthe country lout about him; on the contrary, he moved with remarkable\ndignity, and bore himself so well that many a pair of feminine eyes\nwatched him kindly, as he took his seat at the baize-covered table.\n\n\"Will one of you gentlemen teach me the game?\" he asked simply.\n\nIt was remarkable that no one sneered at him again, and in these days of\narrogance peculiar to the upper classes this was all the more\nnoticeable, as these secret clubs were thought to be very exclusive, the\nresort pre-eminently of gentlemen and noblemen who were anti-Puritan,\nanti-Republican, and very jealous of their ranks and privileges.\n\nYet when after those few unpleasant moments of hesitation Lambert boldly\naccepted the situation and with much simple dignity took his seat at the\ntable, everyone immediately accepted him as an equal, nor did anyone\nquestion his right to sit there on terms of equality with Lord Walterton\nor Sir Michael Isherwood.\n\nHis own state of mind was very remarkable at the moment.\n\nOf course he disapproved of what he did: he would not have been the\nPuritanically trained, country-bred lad that he was, if he had accepted\nwith an easy conscience the idea of tossing about money from hand to\nhand, money that he could in no sense afford to lose, or money that no\none was making any honest effort to win.\n\nHe knew--somewhat vaguely perhaps, yet with some degree of\ncertainty--that gambling was an illicit pastime, and that therefore\nhe--by sitting at this table with these gentlemen, was deliberately\ncontravening the laws of his country.\n\nAgainst all that, it is necessary to note that Richard Lambert took two\nmatters very much in earnest: first, his position as a paid dependent;\nsecond, his gratitude to Sir Marmaduke de Chavasse.\n\nAnd both these all-pervading facts combined to force him against his\nwill into this anomalous position of gentlemanly gambler, which suited\nneither his temperament nor his principles.\n\nWith it all Lambert's was one of those dispositions, often peculiar to\nthose who have led an isolated and introspective life, which never do\nanything half-heartedly; and just as he took his somewhat empty\nsecretarial duties seriously, so did he look on this self-imposed task,\nagainst which his better judgment rebelled, with earnestness and\ndetermination.\n\nHe listened attentively to the preliminary explanations given him sotto\nvoce by Endicott. Segrave in the meanwhile had taken the latter's place\nat the head of the table. He had put all his money in front of him, some\ntwo hundred and sixty pounds all told, for his winnings during the last\nhalf hour had not been as steady as heretofore, and he had not yet\nsucceeded altogether in making up that sum of money for which he yearned\nwith all the intensity of a disturbed conscience, eager to redeem one\nmiserable fault by another hardly more avowable.\n\nHe shuffled the cards and dealt just as Endicott had done.\n\n\"Now will you look at your card, young sir,\" said Endicott, who stood\nbehind Lambert's chair, whispering directions in his ear. \"A splendid\ncard, begad! and one on which you must stake freely.... Nay! nay! that\nis not enough,\" he added, hurriedly restraining the young man's hand,\nwho had timidly pushed a few silver coins forward. \"'Tis thus you must\ndo!\"\n\nAnd before Lambert had time to protest the rotund man in the cinnamon\ndoublet and the wide lace cuffs, had emptied the contents of the little\nleather wallet upon the table.\n\nFive golden guineas rested on Lambert's card. Segrave turned up his own\nand declared:\n\n\"I pay queen and upwards!\"\n\n\"A two, by gad!\" said Lord Walterton, too confused in his feeble head\nnow to display any real fury. \"Did anyone ever see such accursed luck?\"\n\n\"And look at this nine,\" quoth Sir Michael, who had become very sullen;\n\"not a card to-night!\"\n\n\"I have a king,\" said Lambert quietly.\n\n\"And as I had the pleasure to remark before, my dear young friend,\" said\nEndicott blandly, \"'tis a mighty good card to hold.... And see,\" he\ncontinued, as Segrave without comment added five more golden guineas to\nLambert's little hoard, \"see how wise it was to stake a goodly sum ...\nThat is the whole art of the game of primero ... to know just what to\nstake on each card in accordance with its value and the law of\naverages.... But you will learn in time, young man you will learn....\"\n\n\"The game doth not appear to be vastly complicated,\" assented Lambert\nlightly.\n\n\"I have played primero on a system for years ...\" quoth Lord Walterton\nsententiously, \"but to-night ... hic ... by Gad! ... I cannot make the\nsystem work right ... hic!\"\n\nBut already Segrave was dealing again. Lambert staked more coolly now.\nIn his mind he had already set aside the original five guineas which\ncame from his grandmother. With strange ease and through no merit of his\nown, yet perfectly straightforwardly and honestly, he had become the\nowner of another five; these he felt more justified in risking on the\nhazard of the game.\n\nBut the goddess of Fortune smiling benignly on this country-bred lad,\nhad in a wayward mood apparently taken him under her special protection.\nHe staked and won again, and then again pleased at his success ... in\nspite of himself feeling the subtle poison of excitement creeping into\nhis veins ... yet remaining perfectly calm outwardly the while.\n\nSegrave, on the other hand, was losing in exact proportion to the\nnewcomer's winnings: already his pile of gold had perceptibly\ndiminished, whilst the hectic flush on his cheeks became more and more\naccentuated, the glitter in his eyes more unnatural and feverish, his\nhands as they shuffled and dealt the cards more trembling and febrile.\n\n\"'Pon my honor,\" quoth Sir Marmaduke, throwing a careless glance at the\ntable, \"meseems you are in luck, my good Lambert. Doubtless, you are not\nsorry now that you allowed yourself to be persuaded.\"\n\n\"'Tis not unpleasant to win,\" rejoined Lambert lightly, \"but believe me,\nsir, the game itself gives me no pleasure.\"\n\n\"I pay knave and upwards,\" declared Segrave in a dry and hollow voice,\nand with burning eyes fixed upon his new and formidable opponent.\n\n\"My last sovereign, par Dieu!\" swore Lord Walterton, throwing the money\nacross to Segrave with an unsteady hand.\n\n\"And one of my last,\" said Sir Michael, as he followed suit.\n\n\"And what is your stake, Master Lambert?\" queried Segrave.\n\n\"Twenty pounds I see,\" replied the young man, as with a careless hand he\ncounted over the gold which lay pell-mell on his card; \"I staked on the\nking without counting.\"\n\nSegrave in his turn pushed some gold towards him. The pile in front of\nhim was not half the size it had been before this stranger from the\ncountry had sat down to play. He tried to remain master of himself, not\nto show before these egotistical, careless cavaliers all the agony of\nmind which he now endured and which had turned to positive physical\ntorture.\n\nThe ghost of stolen money, of exposure, of pillory and punishment which\nhad so perceptibly paled as he saw the chance of replacing by his\nunexpected winnings that which he had purloined, once more rose to\nconfront him. Again he saw before him the irascible employer, pointing\nwith relentless finger at the deficiency in the accounts, again he saw\nhis weeping mother, his stern father,--the disgrace, the irretrievable\npast.\n\n\"You are not leaving off playing, Sir Michael?\" he asked anxiously, as\nthe latter having handed him over a golden guinea, rose from the table\nand without glancing at his late partners in the game, turned his back\non them all.\n\n\"Par Dieu!\" he retorted, speaking roughly, and none too civilly over his\nshoulder, \"my pockets are empty.... Like Master Lambert here,\" he added\nwith an unmistakable sneer, \"I find no pleasure in _this_ sort of game!\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\" queried Segrave hotly.\n\n\"Oh, nothing,\" rejoined the other dryly, \"you need not heed my remark.\nAre you not losing, too?\"\n\n\"What does he mean?\" said Lambert with a puzzled frown, instinctively\nturning to his employer.\n\n\"Naught! naught! my good Lambert,\" replied Sir Marmaduke, dropping his\nvoice to a whisper. \"Sir Michael Isherwood hath lost more than he can\nafford and is somewhat choleric of temper, that is all.\"\n\n\"And in a little quiet game, my good young friend,\" added Endicott,\nalso in a whisper, \"'tis wisest to take no heed of a loser's vapors.\"\n\n\"I pay ace only!\" quoth Segrave triumphantly, who in the meanwhile had\ncontinued the game.\n\nLord Walterton swore a loud and prolonged oath. He had staked five\nguineas on a king and had lost.\n\n\"Ventre-saint-gris, and likewise par le sang-bleu!\" he said, \"the first\ntime I have had a king! Segrave, ye must leave me these few little\nyellow toys, else I cannot pay for my lodgings to-night.... I'll give\nyou a bill ... but I've had enough of this, by Gad!\"\n\nAnd somewhat sobered, though still unsteady, he rose from the table.\n\n\"Surely, my lord, you are not leaving off, too?\" asked Segrave.\n\n\"Nay! ... how can I continue?\" He turned his breeches pockets\nostentatiously inside out. \"Behold, friend, these two beautiful and\ninnocent little dears!\"\n\n\"You can give me more bills ...\" urged Segrave, \"and you lose ... you\nmay not lose after this ... 'tis lucky to play on credit ... and ... and\nyour bills are always met, my lord ...\"\n\nHe spoke with feverish volubility, though his throat was parched and\nevery word he uttered caused him pain. But he was determined that the\ngame should proceed.\n\nHe had won a little of his own back again the last few rounds.\nCertainly his luck would turn once more. His luck _must_ turn once more,\nor else ...\n\n\"Nay! nay! I've had enough,\" said Lord Walterton, nodding a heavy head\nup and down, \"there are too many of my bills about as it is.... I've had\nenough.\"\n\n\"Methinks, of a truth,\" said Lambert decisively, \"that the game has\nindeed lasted long enough.... And if some other gentleman would but take\nmy place ...\"\n\nHe made a movement as if to rise from the table, but was checked by a\nharsh laugh and a peremptory word from Segrave.\n\n\"Impossible,\" said the latter, \"you, Master Lambert, cannot leave off in\nany case.... My lord ... another hand ...\" he urged again.\n\n\"Nay! nay! my dear Segrave,\" replied Lord Walterton, shaking himself\nlike a sleepy dog, \"the game hath ceased to have any pleasure for me, as\nour young friend here hath remarked.... I wish you good luck ... and\ngood-night.\"\n\nWhereupon he turned on his heel and straddled away to another corner of\nthe room, away from the temptation of that green-covered table.\n\n\"We two then, Master Lambert,\" said Segrave with ever-growing\nexcitement, \"what say you? Double or quits?\"\n\nAnd he pointed, with that same febrile movement of his, to the heap of\ngold standing on the table beside Lambert.\n\n\"As you please,\" replied the latter quietly, as he pushed the entire\npile forward.\n\nSegrave dealt, then turned up his card.\n\n\"Ten!\" he said curtly.\n\n\"Mine is a knave,\" rejoined Lambert.\n\n\"How do we stand?\" queried the other, as with a rapid gesture he passed\na trembling hand over his burning forehead.\n\n\"Methinks you owe me a hundred pounds,\" replied Richard, who seemed\nstrangely calm in the very midst of this inexplicable and volcanic\nturmoil which he felt was seething all round him. He had won a hundred\npounds--a fortune in those days for a country lad like himself; but for\nthe moment the thought of what that hundred pounds would mean to him and\nto his brother Adam, was lost in the whirl of excitement which had risen\nto his head like wine.\n\nHe had steadily refused the glasses of muscadel or sack which Mistress\nEndicott had insinuatingly and persistently been offering him, ever\nsince he began to play; yet he felt intoxicated, with strange currents\nof fire which seemed to run through his veins.\n\nThe subtle poison had done its work. Any remorse which he may have felt\nat first, for thus acting against his own will and better judgment, and\nfor yielding like a weakling to persuasion, which had no moral rectitude\nfor basis, was momentarily smothered by the almost childish delight of\nwinning, of seeing the pile of gold growing in front of him. He had\nnever handled money before; it was like a fascinating yet insidious toy\nwhich he could not help but finger.\n\n\"Are you not playing rather high, gentlemen?\" came in dulcet tones from\nMistress Endicott; \"I do not allow high play in my house. Master\nLambert, I would fain ask you to cease.\"\n\n\"I am more than ready, madam,\" said Richard with alacrity.\n\n\"Nay! but I am not ready,\" interposed Segrave vehemently. \"Nay! nay!\" he\nrepeated with feverish insistence, \"Master Lambert cannot cease playing\nnow. He is bound in honor to give me a chance for revenge.... Double or\nquits, Master Lambert! ... Double or quits?\"\n\n\"As you please,\" quoth Lambert imperturbably.\n\n\"Ye cannot cut to each other,\" here interposed Endicott didactically.\n\"The rules of primero moreover demand that if there are but two players,\na third and disinterested party shall deal the cards.\"\n\n\"Then will you cut and deal, Master Endicott,\" said Segrave impatiently;\n\"I care not so long as I can break Master Lambert's luck and redeem mine\nown.... Double or quits, Master Lambert.... Double or quits.... I shall\neither owe you two hundred pounds or not one penny.... In which case we\ncan make a fresh start....\"\n\nLambert eyed him with curiosity, sympathetically too, for the young man\nwas in a state of terrible mental agitation, whilst he himself felt\ncooler than before.\n\nEndicott dealt each of the two opponents a card face downwards, but even\nas he did so, the one which he had dealt to Lambert fluttered to the\nground.\n\nHe stooped and picked it up.\n\nSegrave's eyes at the moment were fixed on his own card, Lambert's on\nthe face of his opponent. No one else in the room was paying any\nattention to the play of the two young men, for everyone was busy with\nhis own affairs. Play was general, the hour late. The wines had been\nheady, and all tempers were at fever pitch.\n\nNo one, therefore, was watching Endicott's movements at the moment when\nhe ostensibly stooped to pick up the fallen card.\n\n\"It is not faced,\" he said, \"what shall we do?\"\n\n\"Give it to Master Lambert forsooth,\" quoth Mistress Endicott, \"'tis\nunlucky to re-deal ... providing,\" she added artfully, \"that Master\nSegrave hath no objection.\"\n\n\"Nay! nay!\" said the latter. \"Begad! why should we stop the game for a\ntrifle?\"\n\nThen as Lambert took the card from Endicott and casually glanced at it,\nSegrave declared:\n\n\"Queen!\"\n\n\"King!\" retorted Lambert, with the same perfect calm. \"King of diamonds\n... that card has been persistently faithful to me to-night.\"\n\n\"The devil himself hath been faithful to you, Master Lambert ...\" said\nSegrave tonelessly, \"you have the hell's own luck.... What do I pay you\nnow?\"\n\n\"It was double or quits, Master Segrave,\" rejoined Lambert, \"which\nbrings it up to two hundred pounds.... You will do me the justice to own\nthat I did not seek this game.\"\n\nIn his heart he had already resolved not to make use of his own\nwinnings. Somehow as in a flash of intuition he perceived the whole\ntragedy of dishonor and of ruin which seemed to be writ on his\nopponent's face. He understood that what he had regarded as a\ntoy--welcome no doubt, but treacherous for all that--was a matter of\nlife or death--nay! more mayhap to that pallid youth, with the hectic\nflush, the unnaturally bright eyes and trembling hands.\n\nThere was silence for a while round the green-topped table, whilst\nthoughts, feelings, presentiments of very varied kinds congregated\nthere. With Endicott and his wife, and also with Sir Marmaduke, it was\nacute tension, the awful nerve strain of anticipation. The seconds for\nthem seemed an eternity, the obsession of waiting was like lead on their\nbrains.\n\nDuring that moment of acute suspense Richard Lambert was quietly\nco-ordinating his thoughts.\n\nWith that one mental flash-light which had shown up to him the hitherto\nunsuspected tragedy, the latent excitement in him had vanished. He saw\nhis own weakness in its true light, despised himself for having yielded,\nand looked upon the heap of gold before him as so much ill-gotten\nwealth, which it would be a delight to restore to the hand from whence\nit came.\n\nHe heartily pitied the young man before him, and was forming vague\nprojects of how best to make him understand in private and without\nhumiliation that the money which he had lost would be returned to him in\nfull. Strangely enough he was still holding in his hand that king of\ndiamonds which Endicott had dealt to him.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX\n\nDISGRACE\n\n\nSegrave, too, had been silent, of course. In his mind there was neither\nsuspense nor calm. It was utter, dull and blank despair which assailed\nhim, the ruin of his fondest hopes, an awful abyss of disgrace, of\npunishment, of death at best, which seemed to yawn before him from the\nother side of the baize-covered table.\n\nInstinct--that ever-present instinct of self-control peculiar to the\ngently-bred race of mankind--caused him to make frantic efforts to keep\nhimself and his nerves in check. He would--even at this moment of\ncomplete ruin--have given the last shreds of his worldly possessions to\nbe able to steady the febrile movements of his hand.\n\nThe pack of cards was on the table, just as Endicott had put it down,\nafter dealing, with the exception of the queen of hearts in front of\nSegrave and the lucky king of diamonds on which Lambert was still\nmechanically gazing.\n\nHe was undoubtedly moved by the desire to hide the trembling of his\nhands and the gathering tears in his eyes when he began idly to scatter\nthe pack upon the table, spreading out the cards, fingering them one by\none, setting his teeth the while lest that latent cry of misery should\nforce its way across his lips.\n\nSuddenly he paused in this idle fingering of the cards. His eyes which\nalready were burning with hot tears, seemed to take on an almost savage\nglitter. A hoarse cry escaped his parched lips.\n\n\"In the name of Heaven, Master Segrave, what ails you?\" cried Endicott\nwith well-feigned concern.\n\nSegrave's hand wandered mechanically to his own neck; he tugged at the\nfastening of his lace collar, as if, in truth, he were choking.\n\n\"The king.... The king of diamonds,\" he murmured in a hollow voice. \"Two\n... two kings of diamonds....\"\n\nHe laughed, a long, harsh laugh, the laugh of a maniac, or of a man\npossessed, whilst one long thin finger pointed tremblingly to the card\nstill held by Richard Lambert, and then to its counterpart in the midst\nof the scattered pack.\n\nThat laugh seemed to echo all round the room. Dames and cavaliers,\nplayers and idlers, looked up to see whence that weird sound had come.\nInstinctively the crowd drew nigh, dice and cards were pushed aside.\nSome strange drama was being enacted between two young men, more\ninteresting even than the caprices of Fortune.\n\nBut already Endicott and also Sir Marmaduke de Chavasse had followed the\nbeckonings of Segrave's feverish hand.\n\nThere could be no mistake in what they saw nor yet in the ominous\nconsequences which it foretold. There was a king of diamonds in the\nscattered pack of cards upon the table, and yet the card which Lambert\nheld, in consequence of which he had just won two hundred pounds, was\nalso the king of diamonds.\n\n\"Two kings of diamonds ... by all that's damnable!\" quoth Lord\nWalterton, who had been the first to draw nigh.\n\n\"But in Heaven's name, what does it all mean?\" exclaimed Lambert, gazing\nat the two cards, hearing the comments round him, yet utterly unable to\nunderstand.\n\nSegrave jumped to his feet.\n\n\"It means, young man,\" he ejaculated in a wild state of frenzy, maddened\nby his losses, his former crime, his present ruin, \"it means that you\nare a damned thief.\"\n\nAnd with frantic, excited gesture he gathered up the cards and threw\nthem violently into Richard Lambert's face.\n\nA curious sound went round the room--a gasp, hardly a cry--and all those\npresent held their breath, silent, appalled at the terrible tragedy\nexpressed by these two young men standing face to face on the brink of a\ndeathly and almost blasphemous conflict.\n\nMistress Endicott was the first to utter a cry.\n\n\"Silence! silence!\" she shouted shrilly. \"Master Segrave, I adjure you\nto be silent.... I'll not permit you to insult my guest.\"\n\nAlready Lambert had made a quick movement to throw himself on Segrave.\nThe elemental instinct of self-defense, of avenging a terrible insult by\nphysical violence, rose within him, whispering of strength and power, of\nthe freedom, muscle-giving life of the country as against the\nenervating, weakening influence of the town.\n\nHe knew that in a hand-to-hand struggle with the feverish, emaciated\ntownsman, he, the country-bred lad, the haunter of woods and cliffs, the\ndweller of the Thanet smithy, would be more than a match for his\nopponent. But even as his whole body stiffened for a spring, his muscles\ntightened and his fists clenched, a dozen restraining hands held him\nback from his purpose, whilst Mistress Endicott's shrill tones seemed to\nbring him back to the realities of his own peril.\n\n\"Mistress Endicott,\" he said, turning a proud, yet imploring look to the\nlady whose virtues had been so loudly proclaimed in his ears, \"Madam, I\nappeal to you ... I implore you to listen ... a frightful insult which\nyou have witnessed ... an awful accusation on which I scarce can trust\nmyself to dwell has been hurled at me.... I entreat you to allow me to\nchallenge these two gentlemen to explain.\"\n\nAnd he pointed both to Segrave and to Endicott, The former, after his\nmad outburst of ungovernable rage, had regained a certain measure of\ncalm. He stood, facing Lambert, with arms folded across his chest,\nwhilst a smile of insulting irony curled his thin lips.\n\nEndicott's eyes seemed to be riveted on Lambert's breast.\n\nAt mention of his own name, he suddenly darted forward, and seemed to be\nplunging his hand--the hand which almost disappeared within the ample\nfolds of the voluminous lace cuff--into the breast pocket of the young\nman's doublet.\n\nHis movements were so quick, so sure and so unexpected that no\none--least of all Lambert--could possibly guess what was his purpose.\n\nThe next moment--less than a second later--he had again withdrawn his\nhand, but now everyone could see that he held a few cards in it. These\nhe dropped with an exclamation of loathing and contempt upon the table,\nwhilst those around, instinctively drew back a step or two as if fearful\nof coming in contact with something impure and terrible.\n\nEndicott's movements, his quick gestures, well aided by the wide lace\ncuffs which fell over his hand, his exclamation of contempt, had all\ncontributed to make it seem before the spectators as if he had found a\nfew winning cards secreted inside the lining of Richard Lambert's\ndoublet.\n\n\"Nay! young sir,\" he said with an evil sneer, \"meseems that explanations\nhad best come from you. Here,\" he added, pointing significantly at the\ncards which he had just dropped out of his own hand, \"here is a vastly\npleasing collection ... aces and kings ... passing serviceable in a\nquiet game of primero among friends.\"\n\nLambert had been momentarily dumfounded, for undoubtedly he had not\nperceived Endicott's treacherous movements, and had absolutely no idea\nwhence had come those awful cards which somehow or other seemed to be\nconvicting him of lying and cheating: so conscious was he of his own\ninnocence, that never for a moment did the slightest fear cross his mind\nthat he could not immediately make clear his own position, and proclaim\nhis own integrity.\n\n\"This is an infamous plot,\" he said calmly, but very firmly. \"Sir\nMarmaduke de Chavasse,\" he added, turning to face his employer, who\nstill stood motionless and silent in the background, \"in the name of\nHeaven I beg of you to explain to these gentlemen that you have known me\nfrom boyhood. Will you speak?\" he added insistently, conscious of a\nstrange tightening of his heartstrings as the man on whom he relied,\nremained impassive and made no movement to come to his help. \"Will you\ntell them, I pray you, sir, that you know me to be a man of honor,\nincapable of such villainy as they suggest? ... You know that I did not\neven wish to play ...\"\n\n\"That reluctance of yours, my good Lambert, seems to have been a pretty\ncomedy forsooth,\" replied Sir Marmaduke lightly, \"and you played to some\npurpose, meseems, when you once began.... Nay! I pray you,\" he added\nwith unmitigated harshness, \"do not drag me into your quarrels.... I\ncannot of a truth champion your virtue.\"\n\nLambert's cheeks became deathly pale. The first inkling of the deadly\nperil of his own situation had suddenly come to him with Sir Marmaduke's\ncallous words. It seemed to him as if the very universe must stand still\nin the face of such treachery. The man whom he loved with all the fervor\nof a grateful nature, the man who knew him and whom he had wholly\ntrusted, was proving his most bitter, most damning enemy.\n\nAfter Sir Marmaduke's speech, his own employer's repudiation, he felt\nthat all his chances of clearing his character before these sneering\ngentlemen had suddenly vanished.\n\n\"This is cruel, and infamous,\" he protested, conscious innocence within\nhim still striving to fight a hard battle against overwhelming odds.\n\"Gentlemen! ... as I am a man of honor, I swear that I do not know what\nall this means!\"\n\n\"It means, young man, that you are an accursed cheat ... a thief ... a\nliar!\" shouted Segrave, whose last vestige of self-control suddenly\nvanished, whilst mad frenzy once more held him in its grip. \"I swear by\nGod that you shall pay me for this!\"\n\nHe threw himself with all the strength of a raving maniac upon Lambert,\nwho for the moment was taken unawares, and yielded to the suddenness of\nthe onslaught. But it was indeed a conflict 'twixt town and country,\nthe simple life against nightly dissipations, the forests and cliffs of\nThanet against the enervating atmosphere of the city.\n\nAfter that first onrush, Lambert, with marvelous agility and quick\nknowledge of a hand-to-hand fight, had shaken himself free of his\nopponent's trembling grasp. It was his turn now to have the upper hand,\nand in a trice he had, with a vigorous clutch, gripped his opponent by\nthe throat.\n\nIn a sense, his calmness had not forsaken him, his mind was as quiet, as\nclear as heretofore; it was only his muscle--his bodily energy in the\nface of a violent and undeserved attack--which had ceased to be under\nhis control.\n\n\"Man! man!\" he murmured, gazing steadily into the eyes of his\nantagonist, \"ye shall swallow those words--or by Heaven I will kill\nyou!\"\n\nThe tumult which ensued drowned everything save itself ... everything,\neven the sound of that slow and measured tramp, tramp, tramp, which was\nwafted up from the street.\n\nThe women shouted, the men swore. Some ran like frightened sheep to the\ndistant corners of the room, fearful lest they be embroiled in this\nunpleasant fracas ... others crowded round Segrave and Lambert, trying\nto pacify them, to drag the strong youth away from his weaker\nopponent--almost his victim now.\n\nSome were for forcibly separating them, others for allowing them to\nfight their own battles and loud-voiced arguments, subsidiary quarrels,\nmingled with the shrill cries of terror and caused a din which grew in\ndeafening intensity, degenerating into a wild orgy as glasses were\nknocked off the tables, cards strewn about, candles sent flying and\nspluttering upon the ground.\n\nAnd still that measured tramp down the street, growing louder, more\ndistinct, a muffled \"Halt!\" the sound of arms, of men moving about\nbeneath that yawning archway and along the dark and dismal passage with\nits hermetically closed front door.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX\n\nMY LORD PROTECTOR'S PATROL\n\n\nAlone, Sir Marmaduke de Chavasse had taken no part in the confused\nturmoil which raged around the personalities of Segrave and Richard\nLambert. From the moment that he had--with studied callousness--turned\nhis back on his erstwhile prot\u00c3\u00a9g\u00c3\u00a9 he had held aloof from the crowd which\nhad congregated around the two young men.\n\nHe saw before him the complete success of his nefarious plan, which had\noriginated in the active brain of Editha, but had been perfected in his\nown--of heaping dire and lasting disgrace on the man who had become\ntroublesome and interfering of late, who was a serious danger to his\nmore important schemes.\n\nAfter the fracas of this night Richard Lambert forsooth could never show\nhis face within two hundred miles of London, the ugly story of his\nhaving cheated at cards and been publicly branded as a liar and a thief\nby a party of gentlemen would of a surety penetrate even within the\nfastnesses of Thanet.\n\nSo far everything was for the best, nay, it might be better still, for\nSegrave enraged and maddened at his losses, might succeed in getting\nLambert imprisoned for stealing, and cheating, even at the cost of his\nown condemnation to a fine for gambling.\n\nThe Endicotts had done their part well. The man especially, with his\nwide cuffs and his quick movements. No one there present could have the\nslightest doubt but that Lambert was guilty. Satisfied, therefore, that\nall had gone according to his own wishes, Sir Marmaduke withdrew from\nfurther conflict or argument with the unfortunate young man, whom he had\nso deliberately and so hopelessly ruined.\n\nAnd because he thus kept aloof, his ears were not so completely filled\nwith the din, nor his mind so wholly engrossed by the hand-to-hand\nstruggle between the two young men, that he did not perceive that other\nsound, which, in spite of barred windows and drawn curtains, came up\nfrom the street below.\n\nAt first he had only listened carelessly to the measured tramp. But the\ncry of \"Halt!\" issuing from immediately beneath the windows caused his\ncheeks to blanch and his muscles to stiffen with a sudden sense of fear.\n\nHe cast a rapid glance all around. Segrave and Lambert--both flushed and\npanting--were forcibly held apart. Sir Marmaduke noted with a grim smile\nthat the latter was obviously the center of a hostile group, whilst\nSegrave was surrounded by a knot of sympathizers who were striving\noutwardly to pacify him, whilst in reality urging him on through their\nunbridled vituperations directed against the other man.\n\nThe noise of arguments, of shrill voices, of admonitions and violent\nabuse had in no sense abated.\n\nOver the sea of excited faces Sir Marmaduke caught the wide-open,\nterrified eyes of Editha de Chavasse.\n\nShe too, had heard.\n\nHe beckoned to her across the room with a slight gesture of the hand,\nand she obeyed the silent call as quickly as she dared, working her way\nround to him, without arousing the attention of the crowd.\n\n\"Do not lose your head,\" he whispered as soon as she was near him and\nseeing the wild terror expressed in every line of her face. \"Slip into\nthe next room ... and leave the door ajar.... Do this as quietly as may\nbe ... now ... at once ... then wait there until I come.\"\n\nAgain she obeyed him silently and swiftly, for she knew what that cry of\n\"Halt!\" meant, uttered at the door of her house. She had heard it, even\nas Sir Marmaduke had done, and after it the peremptory knocks, the loud\ncall, the word of command, followed by the sound of an awed and\nsupplicating voice, entering a feeble protest.\n\nShe knew what all that meant, and she was afraid.\n\nAs soon as Sir Marmaduke saw that she had done just as he had ordered,\nhe deliberately joined the noisy groups which were congregated around\nSegrave and Lambert.\n\nHe pushed his way forward and anon stood face to face with the young man\non whom he had just wreaked such an irreparable wrong. Not a thought of\ncompunction or remorse rose in his mind as he looked down at the\nhandsome flushed face--quite calm and set outwardly in spite of the\nterrible agony raging within heart and mind.\n\n\"Lambert!\" he said gruffly, \"listen to me.... Your conduct hath been\nmost unseemly.... Mistress Endicott has for my sake, already shown you\nmuch kindness and forbearance ... Had she acted as she had the right to\ndo, she would have had you kicked out of the house by her servants....\nIn your own interests now I should advise you to follow me quietly out\nof the house....\"\n\nBut this suggestion raised a hot protest on the part of all the\nspectators.\n\n\"He shall not go!\" declared Segrave violently.\n\n\"Not without leaving behind him what he has deliberately stolen,\"\ncommented Endicott, raising his oily voice above the din.\n\nLambert had waited patiently, whilst his employer spoke. The last\nremnant of that original sense of deference and of gratitude caused him\nto hold himself in check lest he should strike that treacherous coward\nin the face. Sir Marmaduke's callousness in the face of his peril and\nunmerited disgrace, had struck Lambert with an overwhelming feeling of\ndisappointment and loneliness. But his cruel insults now quashed despair\nand roused dormant indignation to fever pitch. One look at Sir\nMarmaduke's sneering face had told him not only that he could expect no\nhelp from the man who--by all the laws of honor--should have stood by\nhim in his helplessness, but that he was the fount and source, the\ninstigator of the terrible wrong and injustice which was about to land\nan innocent man in the veriest abyss of humiliation and irretrievable\ndisgrace.\n\n\"And so this was your doing, Sir Marmaduke de Chavasse,\" he said,\nlooking his triumphant enemy boldly in the face, even whilst compelling\nsilent attention from those who were heaping opprobrious epithets upon\nhim. \"You enticed me here.... You persuaded me to play, ... Then you\ntried to rob me of mine honor, of my good name, the only valuable assets\nwhich I possess.... Hell and all its devils alone know why you did this\nthing, but I swear before God that your hideous crime shall not remain\nunpunished....\"\n\n\"Silence!\" commanded Sir Marmaduke, who was the first to perceive the\nstrange, almost supernatural, effect produced on all those present, by\nthe young man's earnestness, his impressive calm. Segrave himself stood\nsilent and abashed, whilst everyone listened, unconsciously awed by that\nunmistakable note of righteousness which somehow rang through Lambert's\nvoice.\n\n\"Nay! but I'll not be silent,\" quoth Richard unperturbed. \"I have been\ncondemned ... and I have the right to speak.... You have disgraced me\n... and I have the right to defend mine honor ... by protesting mine\ninnocence.... And now I will leave this house,\" he added loudly and\nfirmly, \"for it is accursed and infamous ... but God is my witness that\nI leave it without a stain upon my soul....\"\n\nHe pointed to the fateful table whereon a pile of gold lay scattered in\nan untidy heap, with the tiny leather wallet containing his five guineas\nconspicuously in its midst.\n\n\"There lies the money,\" he said, speaking directly to Segrave, \"take it,\nsir, for I had never the intention to touch a penny of it.... This I\nswear by all that I hold most sacred.... Take it without fear or\nremorse--even though you thought such evil things of me ... and let him\nwho still thinks me a thief, repeat it now to my face--an he dare!\"\n\nEven as the last of his loudly uttered words resounded through the room,\nthere was a loud knock at the door, and a peremptory voice commanded:\n\n\"Open! in the name of His Highness, the Lord Protector of England!\"\n\nIn the dead silence that followed, the buzz of a fly, the spluttering of\nwax candles, could be distinctly heard.\n\nIn a moment with the sound of that peremptory call outside, tumultuous\npassions seemed to sink to rest, every cheek paled, and masculine hands\ninstinctively sought the handles of swords whilst lace handkerchiefs\nwere hastily pressed to trembling lips, in order to smother the cry of\nterror which had risen to feminine throats.\n\n\"Open! in the name of His Highness, the Lord Protector of England.\"\n\nMistress Endicott was the color of wax, her husband was gripping her\nwrist with a clutch of steel, trying, through the administration of\nphysical pain, to keep alive her presence of mind.\n\nAnd for the third time came the loud summons:\n\n\"Open! in the name of His Highness the Lord, Protector of England!\"\n\nStill that deathly silence in the room, broken only now by the firm step\nof Endicott, who went to open the door.\n\nResistance had been worse than useless. The door would have yielded at\nthe first blow. There was a wailing, smothered cry from a dozen\nterrified throats, and a general rush for the inner room. But this door\nnow was bolted and barred, Sir Marmaduke--unperceived--had slipped\nquickly within, even whilst everyone held his breath in the first moment\nof paralyzed terror.\n\nHad there been time, there would doubtless have ensued a violent attack\nagainst that locked door, but already a man in leather doublet and\nwearing a steel cap and collar had peremptorily pushed Endicott aside,\nwho was making a futile effort to bar the way, after he had opened the\ndoor.\n\nThis man now advanced into the center of the room, whilst a couple of\nsoldierly-looking, stalwart fellows remained at attention on the\nthreshold.\n\n\"Let no one attempt to leave this room,\" he commanded. \"Here, Bradden,\"\nhe added, turning back to his men, \"take Pyott with you and search that\nsecond room there ... then seize all those cards and dice and also that\nmoney.\"\n\nIt was not likely that these hot-headed cavaliers would submit thus\nquietly to an arbitrary act of confiscation and of arrest. Hardly were\nthe last words out of the man's mouth than a dozen blades flashed out of\ntheir scabbards.\n\nThe women screamed, and like so many frightened hens, ran into the\ncorner of the room furthest out of reach of my Lord Protector's\npolice-patrol, the men immediately forming a bulwark in front of them.\n\nThe whole thing was not very heroic perhaps. A few idlers caught in an\nillicit act and under threat of arrest. The consequences--of a\ntruth--would not be vastly severe for the frequenters of this secret\nclub; fines mayhap, which most of those present could ill afford to pay,\nand at worst a night's detention in one of those horrible wooden\nconstructions which had lately been erected on the river bank for the\nexpress purpose of causing sundry lordly offenders to pass an\nuncomfortable night.\n\nThese were days of forcible levelings: and my lord who had contravened\nold Noll's laws against swearing and gambling, fared not one whit better\nthan the tramp who had purloined a leg of mutton from an eating-house.\n\nNay! in a measure my lord fared a good deal worse, for he looked upon\nhis own detention through the regicide usurper's orders, as an indignity\nto himself; hence the reason why in this same house wherein a few idle\nscions of noble houses indulged in their favorite pastime, when orders\nrang out in the name of His Highness, swords jumped out of their\nsheaths, and resistance was offered out of all proportion to the threat.\n\nThe man who seemed to be the captain of the patrol smiled somewhat\ngrimly when he saw himself confronted by this phalanx of gentlemanly\nweapons. He was a tall, burly fellow, broad of shoulder and well-looking\nin his uniform of red with yellow facings; his round bullet-shaped head,\ncovered by the round steel cap, was suggestive of obstinacy, even of\ndetermination.\n\nHe eyed the flushed and excited throng with some amusement not wholly\nunmixed with contempt. Oh! he knew some of the faces well enough by\nsight--for he had originally served in the train-bands of London, and\nhad oft seen my Lord Walterton, for instance, conspicuous at every\nentertainment--now pronounced illicit by His Highness, and Sir Anthony\nBridport, a constant frequenter at Exeter House, and young Lord\nNaythmire the son of the Judge. He also had certainly seen young Segrave\nbefore this, whose father had been a member of the Long Parliament; the\nonly face that was totally strange to him was that of the youngster in\nthe dark suit of grogram, who stood somewhat aloof from the irate crowd,\nand seemed to be viewing the scene with astonishment rather than with\nalarm.\n\nLord Walterton, flushed with wine, more than with anger, constituted\nhimself the spokesman of the party:\n\n\"Who are you?\" he asked somewhat unsteadily, \"and what do you want?\"\n\n\"My name is Gunning,\" replied the man curtly, \"captain commanding His\nHighness' police. What I want is that you gentlemen offer no resistance,\nbut come with me quietly to answer on the morrow before Judge Parry, a\ncharge of contravening the laws against betting and gambling.\"\n\nA ribald and prolonged laugh greeted this brief announcement, and some\ntwenty pairs of gentlemanly shoulders were shrugged in token of\nderision.\n\n\"Hark at the man!\" quoth Sir James Overbury lightly, \"methinks,\ngentlemen, that our wisest course would be to put up our swords and to\nthrow the fellows downstairs, what say you?\"\n\n\"Aye! aye!\" came in cheerful accents from the defiant little group.\n\n\"Out with you fellow, we've no time to waste in bandying words with ye\n...\" said Walterton, with the tone of one accustomed to see the churl\never cringe before the lord, \"and let one of thy myrmidons touch a thing\nin this room if he dare!\"\n\nThe young cavalier was standing somewhat in advance of his friends,\nhaving stepped forward in order to emphasize the peremptoriness of his\nwords. The women were still in the background well protected by a\nphalanx of resolute defenders who, encouraged by the captain's silence\nand Walterton's haughty attitude, were prepared to force the patrol of\npolice to beat a hasty retreat.\n\nEndicott and his wife had seemed to think it prudent to keep well out of\nsight: the former having yielded to Gunning's advance had discreetly\nretired amongst the petticoats.\n\nNo one, least of all Walterton, who remained the acknowledged leader of\nthe little party of gamesters, had any idea of the numerical strength of\nthe patrol whose interference with gentlemanly pastimes was\nunwarrantable and passing insolent. In the gloom on the landing beyond,\na knot of men could only be vaguely discerned. Captain Gunning and his\nlieutenant, Bradden, had alone advanced into the room.\n\nBut now apparently Gunning gave some sign, which Bradden then\ninterpreted to the men outside. The sign itself must have been very\nslight for none of the cavaliers perceived it--certainly no actual word\nof command had been spoken, but the next moment--within thirty seconds\nof Walterton's defiant speech, the room itself, the doorway and\napparently the landing and staircase too, were filled with men, each one\nattired in scarlet and yellow, all wearing leather doublets and steel\ncaps, and all armed with musketoons which they were even now pointing\nstraight at the serried ranks of the surprised and wholly unprepared\ngamesters.\n\n\"I would fain not give an order to fire,\" said Captain Gunning curtly,\n\"and if you, gentlemen, will follow me quietly, there need be no\nbloodshed.\"\n\nIt may be somewhat unromantic but it is certainly prudent, to listen at\ntimes to the dictates of common sense, and one of wisdom's most cogent\naxioms is undoubtedly that it is useless to stand up before a volley of\nmusketry at a range of less than twelve feet, unless a heroic death is\nin contemplation.\n\nIt was certainly very humiliating to be ordered about by a close-cropped\nPuritan, who spoke in nasal tones, and whose father probably had mended\nboots or killed pigs in his day, but the persuasion of twenty-four\nmusketoons, whose muzzles pointed collectively in one direction, was\nbound--in the name of common sense--to prevail ultimately.\n\nOf a truth, none of these gentlemen--who were now content to oppose a\ncomprehensive vocabulary of English and French oaths to the brand-new\nweapons of my Lord Protector's police--were cowards in any sense of the\nword. Less than a decade ago they had proved their mettle not only sword\nin hand, but in the face of the many privations, sorrows and\nhumiliations consequent on the failure of their cause and the defeat,\nand martyrdom of their king. There was, therefore, nothing mean or\npusillanimous in their attitude when having exhausted their vocabulary\nof oaths and still seeing before them the muzzles of four-and-twenty\nmusketoons pointed straight at them, they one after another dropped\ntheir sword points and turned to read in each other's faces uniform\ndesire to surrender to _force majeure_.\n\nThe Captain watched them--impassive and silent--until the moment when he\ntoo, could discern in the sullen looks cast at him by some twenty pairs\nof eyes, that these elegant gentlemen had conquered their impulse to\nhot-headed resistance.\n\nBut the four-and-twenty musketoons were still leveled, nor did the\nround-headed Captain give the order to lower the firearms.\n\n\"I can release most of you, gentlemen, on parole,\" he said, \"an you'll\nsurrender your swords to me, you may go home this night, under promise\nto attend the Court to-morrow morning.\"\n\nBradden in the meanwhile had gone to the inner door and finding it\nlocked had ordered his companion to break it open. It yielded to the\nfirst blow dealt with a vigorous shoulder. The lieutenant went into the\nroom, but finding it empty, he returned and soon was busy in collecting\nthe various \"_pi\u00c3\u00a8ces de convictions_,\" which would go to substantiate\nthe charges of gambling and betting against these noble gentlemen. No\nresistance now was offered, and after a slight moment of hesitation and\na brief consultation 'twixt the more prominent cavaliers there present,\nLord Walterton stepped forward and having unbuckled his sword, threw it\nwith no small measure of arrogance and disdain at the feet of Captain\nGunning.\n\nHis example was followed by all his friends, Gunning with arms folded\nacross his chest, watching the proceeding in silence. When Endicott\nstood before him, however, he said curtly:\n\n\"Not you, I think. Meseems I know you too well, fine sir, to release you\non parole. Bradden,\" he added, turning to his lieutenant, \"have this\nman duly guarded and conveyed to Queen's Head Alley to-night.\"\n\nThen as Endicott tried to protest, and Gunning gave a sharp order for\nhis immediate removal, Segrave pushed his way forward; he wore no sword,\nand like Lambert, had stood aloof throughout this brief scene of\nturbulent yet futile resistance, sullen, silent, and burning with a\ndesire for revenge against the man who had turned the current of his\nluck, and brought him back to that abyss of despair, whence he now knew\nthere could be no release.\n\n\"Captain,\" he said firmly, \"though I wear no sword I am at one with all\nthese gentlemen, and I accept my release on parole. To-morrow I will\nanswer for my offense of playing cards, which apparently, is an illicit\npastime. I am one of the pigeons who have been plucked in this house.\"\n\n\"By that gentleman?\" queried Gunning with a grim smile and nodding over\nhis shoulder in the direction where Endicott was being led away by a\ncouple of armed men.\n\n\"No! not by him!\" replied Segrave boldly.\n\nWith a somewhat theatrical gesture he pointed to Lambert, who, more of a\nspectator than a participant in the scene, had been standing mutely by\noutside the defiant group, absorbed in his own misery, wondering what\neffect the present unforeseen juncture would have on his future chances\nof rehabilitating himself.\n\nHe was also vaguely wondering what had become of Sir Marmaduke and\nMistress de Chavasse.\n\nBut now Segrave's voice was raised, and once more Lambert found himself\nthe cynosure of a number of hostile glances.\n\n\"There stands the man who has robbed us all,\" said Segrave wildly, \"and\nnow he has heaped disgrace upon us, upon me and mine.... Curse him! ...\ncurse him, I say!\" he continued, whilst all the pent-up fury, forcibly\nkept in check all this while by the advent of the police, now once more\nfound vent in loud vituperation and almost maniacal expressions of rage.\n\"Liar ... cheat! ... Look at him, Captain! there stands the man who must\nbear the full brunt of the punishment, for he is the decoy, he is the\nthief! ... The pillory for him ... the pillory ... the lash ... the\nbrand! ... Curse him! ... Curse him! ... the thief! ...\"\n\nHe was surrounded and forcibly silenced. The foam had risen to his lips,\nimpotent fury and agonized despair had momentarily clouded his brain.\nLambert tried to speak, but the Captain, unwilling to prolong a conflict\nover which he was powerless to arbitrate, gave a sign to Bradden and\nanon the two young men were led away in the wake of Endicott.\n\nThe others on giving their word that they would appear before the Court\non the morrow, and answer to the charge preferred against them, were\npresently allowed to walk out of the room in single file between a\ndouble row of soldiers whose musketoons were still unpleasantly\nconspicuous.\n\nThus they passed out one by one, across the passage and down the dark\nstaircase. The door below they found was also guarded; as well as the\npassage and the archway giving on the street.\n\nHere they were permitted to collect or disperse at will. The ladies,\nhowever, had not been allowed to participate in the order for release.\nGunning knew most of them by sight,--they were worthy neither of\nconsideration nor respect,--paid satellites of Mistress Endicott's,\nemployed to keep up the good spirits of that lady's client\u00c3\u00a8le.\n\nThe soldiers drove them all together before them, in a compact,\nshrinking and screaming group. Then the word of command was given. The\nsoldiers stood at attention, turned and finally marched out of the room\nwith their prisoners, Gunning being the last to leave.\n\nHe locked the door behind him and in the wake of his men presently\nwended his way down the tortuous staircase.\n\nOnce more the measured tramp was heard reverberating through the house,\nthe cry of \"Attention!\" of \"Quick march!\" echoed beneath the passage\nand the tumble-down archway, and anon the last of these ominous sounds\ndied away down the dismal street in the direction of the river.\n\nAnd in one of the attics at the top of the now silent and lonely house\nin Bath Street--lately the scene of so much gayety and joy, of such\nturmoil of passions and intensity of despair--two figures, a man and a\nwoman, crouched together in a dark corner, listening for the last dying\necho of that measured tramp.\n\n\n\n\nPART III\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI\n\nIN THE MEANWHILE\n\n\nThe news of the police raid on a secret gambling club in London,\ntogether with the fracas which it entailed, had of necessity reached\neven as far as sea-girt Thanet. Squire Boatfield had been the first to\nhear of it; he spread the news as fast as he could, for he was overfond\nof gossip, and Dame Harrison over at St. Lawrence had lent him able\nassistance.\n\nSir Marmaduke had, of course, the fullest details concerning the affair,\nfor he himself owned to having been present in the very house where the\ndisturbance had occurred. He was not averse to his neighbors knowing\nthat he was a frequenter of those exclusive and smart gambling clubs,\nwhich were avowedly the resort of the most elegant cavaliers of the day,\nand his account of some of the events of that memorable night had been\nas entertaining as it was highly-colored.\n\nHe avowed, however, that, disgusted at Richard Lambert's shameful\nconduct, he had quitted the place early, some little while before my\nLord Protector's police had made a descent upon the gamblers. As for\nMistress de Chavasse, her name was never mentioned in connection with\nthe affair. She had been in London at the time certainly, staying with\na friend, who was helping her in the choice of a new gown for the coming\nautumn.\n\nShe returned to Acol Court with her brother-in-law, apparently as\nhorrified as he was at the disgrace which she vowed Richard Lambert had\nheaped upon them all.\n\nThe story of the young man being caught in the very act of cheating at\ncards lost nothing in the telling. He had been convicted before Judge\nParry of obtaining money by lying and other illicit means, had been\ncondemned to fine and imprisonment and as he refused to pay the\nformer--most obstinately declaring that he was penniless--he was made to\nstand for two hours in the pillory, and was finally dragged through the\nstreets in a rickety cart in full sight of a jeering crowd, sitting with\nhis back to the nag in company of the public hangman, and attired in\nshameful and humiliating clothes.\n\nWhat happened to him after undergoing this wonderfully lenient\nsentence--for many there were who thought he should have been publicly\nwhipped and branded as a cheat--nobody knew or cared.\n\nThey kept him in prison for over ten weeks, it seems, but Sir Marmaduke\ndid not know what had become of him since then.\n\nThe other gentlemen got off fairly lightly with fines and brief periods\nof imprisonment. Young Segrave, so 'twas said, had been shipped to New\nEngland by his father, but Master and Mistress Endicott had gone beyond\nthe seas at the expense of the State, and not for their own pleasure or\nadvancement. It appears that my Lord Protector's vigilance patrol had\nkept a very sharp eye on these two people, who had more than once had to\nanswer for illicit acts before the Courts. They tried in a most shameful\nmanner it appears, to implicate Sir Marmaduke and Mistress de Chavasse\nin their disgrace, but as the former very pertinently remarked, \"How\ncould he, a simple Kentish squire have aught to do with a smart London\nclub? and people of such evil repute as the Endicotts could of a truth\nnever be believed.\"\n\nAll these rumors and accounts had, of course, also reached Sue's ears.\nAt first she took up an attitude of aggressive incredulity when her\nformer friend was accused: nothing but the plain facts as set forth in\nthe _Public Advertiser_ of August the 5th would convince her that\nRichard Lambert could be so base and mean as Sir Marmaduke had averred.\n\nEven then, in her innermost heart, a vague and indefinable instinct\ncalled out to her in Lambert's name, not to believe all that was said of\nhim. She could not think of him as lying, and cheating at a game of\ncards, when common sense itself told her that he was not sufficiently\nconversant with its rules to turn them to his own advantage. Her\nhot-headed partisanship of him gave way of necessity as the weeks sped\nby, to a more passive disapproval of his condemnation, and this in its\nturn to a kindly charity for what she thought must have been his\nignorance rather than his sin.\n\nWhat worried her most was that he was not nigh her, now that her\nsentimental romance was reaching its super-acute crisis. During her\nguardian's temporary absence from Acol she had made earnest and resolute\nefforts to see her mysterious lover. She thought that he must know that\nSir Marmaduke and Mistress de Chavasse were away and that she herself\nwas free momentarily from watchful eyes.\n\nYet though with pathetic persistence she haunted the park and the\nwoodlands around the Court, she never even once caught sight of the\nbroad-brimmed hat and drooping plume of her romantic prince. It seemed\nas if the earth had swallowed him up.\n\nUpset and vaguely terrified, she had on one occasion thrown prudence to\nthe winds and sought out the old Quakeress and Adam Lambert with whom he\nlodged. But the old Quakeress was very deaf, and explanations with her\nwere laborious and unsatisfactory, whilst Adam seemed to entertain a\nsullen and irresponsible dislike for the foreigner.\n\nAll she gathered from these two was that there was nothing unusual in\nthis sudden disappearance of their lodger. He came and went most\nerratically, went no one knew whither, returned at most unexpected\nmoments, never slept more than an hour or two in his bed which he\nquitted at amazingly early hours, strolling out of the cottage when all\ndecent folk were just beginning their night's rest, and wandering off\nunseen, unheard, only to return as he had gone.\n\nHe paid his money for his room regularly, however, and this was vastly\nacceptable these hard times.\n\nBut to Sue it was passing strange that her prince should be out of her\nreach, just when Sir Marmaduke's and Mistress de Chavasse's absence had\nmade their meetings more easy and pleasant.\n\nYet with it all, she was equally conscious of an unaccountable feeling\nof relief, and every evening, when at about eight o'clock she returned\nhomewards after having vainly awaited the prince, there was nothing of\nthe sadness and disappointment in her heart which a maiden should feel\nwhen she has failed to see her lover.\n\nShe was just as much in love with him as ever!--oh! of that she felt\nquite sure! she still thrilled at thought of his heroic martyrdom for\nthe cause which he had at heart, she still was conscious of a wonderful\nfeeling of elation when she was with him, and of pride when she saw this\nremarkable hero, this selfless patriot at her feet, and heard his\nimpassioned declarations of love, even when these were alloyed with\nfrantic outbursts of jealousy. She still yearned for him when she did\nnot see him, even though she dreaded his ill-humor when he was nigh.\n\nShe had promised to be his wife, soon and in secret, for he had vowed\nthat she did not love him if she condemned him to three long months of\ninfinite torture from jealousy and suspense.\n\nThis promise she had given him freely and whole-heartedly more than a\nfortnight ago. Since that memorable evening when she had thus plighted\nher troth to him, when she had without a shadow of fear or a tremor of\ncompunction entrusted her entire future, her heart and soul to his\nkeeping, since then she had not seen him.\n\nSir Marmaduke had gone to London, also Mistress de Chavasse, and she had\nnot even caught sight of the weird silhouette of her French prince.\nLambert, too, had gone, put out of her way temporarily--or mayhap,\nforever--through the irresistible force of a terrible disgrace. There\nwas no one to spy on her movements, no one to dog her footsteps, yet she\nhad not seen him.\n\nWhen her guardian returned, he seemed so engrossed with Lambert's\nmisdeeds that he gave little thought to his ward. He and Mistress de\nChavasse were closeted together for hours in the small withdrawing-room,\nwhilst she was left to roam about the house and grounds unchallenged.\n\nThen at last one evening--it was late August then--when despair had\nbegun to grip her heart, and she herself had become the prey of vague\nfears, of terrors for his welfare, his life mayhap, on which he had oft\ntold her that the vengeful King of France had set a price--one evening\nhe came to greet her walking through the woods, treading the soft carpet\nof moss with a light elastic step.\n\nOh! that had been a rapturous evening! one which she oft strove to\nrecall, now that sadness had once more overwhelmed her. He had been all\ntenderness, all love, all passion! He vowed that he adored her as an\nidolater would worship his divinity. Jealous? oh, yes! madly, insanely\njealous! for she was fair above all women and sweet and pure and\ntempting to all men like some ripe and juicy fruit ready to fall into a\nyearning hand.\n\nBut his jealousy took on a note of melancholy and of humility. He\nworshiped her so and wished to feel her all his own. She listened\nentranced, forgetting her terrors, her disappointments, the vague ennui\nwhich had assailed her of late. She yielded herself to the delights of\nhis caresses, to the joy of this hour of solitude and rapture. The night\nwas close and stormy; from afar, muffled peals of thunder echoed through\nthe gigantic elms, whilst vivid flashes of lightning weirdly lit up at\ntimes the mysterious figure of this romantic lover, with his face\nforever in shadow, one eye forever hidden behind a black band, his voice\nforever muffled.\n\nBut it was a tempestuous wooing, a renewal of that happy evening in the\nspring--oh! so long ago it seemed now!--when first he had poured in her\near the wild torrents of his love. The girl--so young, so inexperienced,\nso romantic--was literally swept off her feet; she listened to his wild\nwords, yielded her lips to his kiss, and whilst she half feared the\nimpetuosity of his mood, she delighted in the very terrors it evoked.\n\nA secret marriage? Why, of course! since he suffered so terribly through\nnot feeling her all his own. Soon!--at once!--at Dover before the\nclergyman at All Souls, with whom he--her prince--had already spoken.\n\nYes! it would have to be at Dover, for the neighboring villages might\nprove too dangerous. Sir Marmaduke might hear of it, mayhap. It would\nrest with her to free herself for one day.\n\nThen came that delicious period of scheming, of stage-managing\neverything for the all-important day. He would arrange about a chaise,\nand she should walk up to the Canterbury Road to meet it. He would await\nher in the church at Dover, for 'twas best that they should not be seen\ntogether until after the happy knot was tied, when he declared that he\nwould be ready to defy the universe.\n\nIt had been a long interview, despite the tempest that raged above and\naround them. The great branches of the elms groaned and cracked under\nfury of the wind, the thunder pealed overhead and then died away with\nslow majesty out towards the sea. From afar could be heard the angry\nbillows dashing themselves against the cliffs.\n\nThey had to seek shelter under the colonnaded porch of the summerhouse,\nand Sue had much ado to keep the heavy drops of rain from reaching her\nshoes and the bottom of her kirtle.\n\nBut she was attune with the storm, she loved to hear the weird sh-sh-sh\nof the leaves, the monotonous drip of the rain on the roof of the summer\nhouse, and in the intervals of intense blackness to catch sight of her\nlover's face, pale of hue, with one large eye glancing cyclops-like into\nhers, as a vivid flash of lightning momentarily tore the darkness\nasunder and revealed him still crouching at her feet.\n\nIntense lassitude followed the wild mental turmoil of that night. She\nhad arranged to meet him again two days hence in order to repeat to him\nwhat she had heard the while of Sir Marmaduke's movements, and when she\nwas like to be free to go to Dover. During those intervening two days\nshe tried hard to probe her own thoughts; her mind, her feelings: but\nwhat she found buried in the innermost recesses of her heart frightened\nher so, that she gave up thinking.\n\nShe lay awake most of the night, telling herself how much she loved her\nprince; she spent half a day in the perusal of a strange book called\n_The Tragedie of Romeo and Juliet_ by one William Shakespeare who had\nlived not so long ago: and found herself pondering as to whether her own\nsentiments with regard to her prince were akin to those so exquisitely\nexpressed by those two young people who had died because they loved one\nanother so dearly.\n\nThen she heard that towards the end of the week Sir Marmaduke and\nMistress de Chavasse would be journeying together to Canterbury in order\nto confer with Master Skyffington the lawyer, anent her own fortune,\nwhich was to be handed to her in its entirety in less than three months,\nwhen she would be of age.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXII\n\nBREAKING THE NEWS\n\n\nSir Marmaduke talked openly of this plan of going to Canterbury with\nEditha de Chavasse, mentioning the following Friday as the most likely\ndate for his voyage.\n\nFull of joy she brought the welcome news to her lover that same evening;\nnor had she cause to regret then her ready acquiescence to his wishes.\nHe was full of tenderness then, of gentle discretion in his caresses,\nshowing the utmost respect to his future princess. He talked less of his\npassion and more of his plans, in which now she would have her full\nshare. He confided some of his schemes to her: they were somewhat vague\nand not easy to understand, but the manner in which he put them before\nher, made them seem wonderfully noble and selfless.\n\nIn a measure this evening--so calm and peaceful in contrast to the\nturbulence of the other night--marked one of the great crises in the\nhistory of her love. Even when she heard that Fate itself was conspiring\nto help on the clandestine marriage by causing Sir Marmaduke and\nMistress de Chavasse to absent themselves at a most opportune moment,\nshe had resolved to break the news to her lover of her own immense\nwealth.\n\nOf this he was still in total ignorance. One or two innocent remarks\nwhich he had let fall at different times convinced her of that. Nor was\nthis ignorance of his to be wondered at: he saw no one in or about the\nvillage except the old Quakeress and Adam Lambert with whom he lodged.\nThe woman was deaf and uncommunicative, whilst there seemed to be some\nsort of tacit enmity against the foreigner, latent in the mind of the\nblacksmith. It was, therefore, quite natural that he should suppose her\nno whit less poor than Sir Marmaduke de Chavasse or the other\nneighboring Kentish squires whose impecuniousness was too blatant a fact\nto be unknown even to a stranger in the land.\n\nSue, therefore, was eagerly looking forward to the happy moment when she\nwould explain to her prince that her share in the wonderful enterprise\nwhich he always vaguely spoke of as his \"great work\" would not merely be\none of impassiveness. Where he could give the benefit of his\npersonality, his eloquence, his knowledge of men and things, she could\nadd the weight of her wealth.\n\nOf course she was very, very young, but already from him she had\nrealized that it is impossible even to regenerate mankind and give it\npolitical and religious freedom without the help of money.\n\nPrince Am\u00c3\u00a9d\u00c3\u00a9 d'Orl\u00c3\u00a9ans himself was passing rich: the fact that he chose\nto hide in a lonely English village and to live as a poor man would\nlive, was only a part of his schemes. For the moment, too, owing to that\never-present vengefulness of the King of France, his estates and\nrevenues were under sequestration. All this Sue understood full well,\nand it added quite considerably to her joy to think that soon she could\nrelieve the patriot and hero from penury, and that the news that she\ncould do so would be a glad surprise for him.\n\nNor must Lady Sue Aldmarshe on this account be condemned for an ignorant\nor a vain fool. Though she was close on twenty-one years of age, she had\nhad absolutely no experience of the world or of mankind: all she knew of\neither had been conceived in the imaginings of her own romantic brain.\n\nHer entire childhood, her youth and maidenhood had gone by in silent and\nfanciful dreamings, whilst one of the greatest conflicts the world had\never known was raging between men of the same kith and the same blood.\nThe education of women--even of those of rank and wealth--was avowedly\nupon a very simple plan. Most of the noble ladies of that time knew not\nhow to spell--most of them were content to let the world go by them,\nwithout giving it thought or care, others had accomplished prodigies of\nvalor, of heroism, aye! and of determination to help their brothers,\nhusbands, fathers during the worst periods of the civil war.\n\nBut Sue had been too young when these same prodigies were being\naccomplished, and her father died before she had reached the age when\nshe could take an active part in the great questions of the day. A\nmother she had never known, she had no brothers and sisters. A brief\ntime under the care of an old aunt and a duenna in a remote Surrey\nvillage, and her stay at Pegwell Court under Sir Marmaduke's\nguardianship, was all that she had ever seen of life.\n\nPrince Am\u00c3\u00a9d\u00c3\u00a9 d'Orl\u00c3\u00a9ans was the embodiment of all her dreams--or nearly\nso! The real hero of her dreams had been handsomer, and also more gentle\nand more trusting, but on the whole, he had not been one whit more\nromantic in his personality and his doings.\n\nThe manner in which he received the news that unbeknown to him, he had\nbeen wooing one of the richest brides in the land, was characteristic of\nhim. He seemed boundlessly disappointed.\n\nIt was a beautiful clear night and she could see his face quite\ndistinctly, and could note how its former happy expression was marred\nsuddenly by a look of sorrow. He owned to being disappointed. He had\nloved the idea, so he explained, of taking her to him, just as she was,\nbeautiful beyond compare, but penniless--having only her exquisite self\nto give.\n\nOh! the joy after that of coaxing him back to smiles! the pride of\nproving herself his Egeria for the nonce, teaching him how to look upon\nwealth merely as a means for attaining his great ends, for continuing\nhis great work.\n\nIt had been perhaps the happiest evening in her short life of love.\n\nFor that day at Dover now only seemed a dream. The hurried tramp to the\nmain road in a torrent of pouring rain: the long drive in the stuffy\nchaise, the arrival just in time for the brief--very brief--ceremony in\nthe dark church, with the clergyman in a plain black gown muttering\nunintelligible words, and the local verger and the church cleaner acting\nas the witnesses to her marriage.\n\nHer marriage!\n\nHow differently had she conceived that great, that wonderful day, the\nturning point of a maiden's life. Music, flowers, beautiful gowns and\nsweet scents filling the air! the sunlight peeping gold, red, purple or\nblue through the glass windows of some exquisite cathedral! The\nbridegroom arrayed in white, full of joy and pride, she the bride with a\nveil of filmy lace falling over her face to hide the happy blushes!\n\nIt was a beautiful dream, and the reality was so very, very different.\n\nA dark little country church, with the plaster peeling off the walls!\nthe drone of a bewhiskered, bald-headed parson being the sole music\nwhich greeted her ears. The rain beating against the broken\nwindow-panes, through which icy cold draughts of damp air reached her\nshoulders and caused her to shiver beneath her kerchief. She wore her\npretty dove-colored gown, but it was not new nor had she a veil over her\nface, only a straw hat such as countrywomen wore, for though she was an\nheiress and passing rich, her guardian did but ill provide her with\nsmart clothing.\n\nAnd the bridegroom?\n\nHe had been waiting for her inside the church, and seemed impatient\nwhen she arrived. No one had helped her to alight from the rickety\nchaise, and she had to run in the pouring rain, through the miserable\nand deserted churchyard.\n\nHis face seemed to scowl as she finally stood up beside him, in front of\nthat black-gowned man, who was to tie between them the sacred and\nirrevocable knot of matrimony. His hand had perceptibly trembled when he\nslipped the ring on her finger, whilst she felt that her own was\nirresponsive and icy cold.\n\nShe tried to speak the fateful \"I will!\" buoyantly and firmly, but\nsomehow--owing to the cold, mayhap--the two little words almost died\ndown in her throat.\n\nAye! it had all been very gloomy, and inexpressibly sad. The\nceremony--the dear, sweet, sacred ceremony which was to give her wholly\nto him, him unreservedly to her--was mumbled and hurried through in less\nthan ten minutes.\n\nHer bridegroom said not a word. Together they went into the tiny vestry\nand she was told to sign her name in a big book, which the bald-headed\nparson held open before her.\n\nThe prince also signed his name, and then kissed her on the forehead.\n\nThe clergyman also shook hands and it was all over.\n\nShe understood that she had been married by a special license, and that\nshe was now legally and irretrievably the wife of Am\u00c3\u00a9d\u00c3\u00a9 Henri, Prince\nd'Orl\u00c3\u00a9ans, de Bourgogne and several other places and dependencies\nabroad.\n\nShe also understood from what the bald-headed clergyman had spoken when\nhe stood before them in the church and read the marriage service that\nshe as the wife owed obedience to her husband in all things, for she had\nsolemnly sworn so to do. She herself, body and soul and mind, her goods\nand chattels, her wealth and all belongings were from henceforth the\nproperty of her husband.\n\nYes, she had sworn to all that, willingly, and there was no going back\non that, now or ever!\n\nBut, oh! how she wished it had been different!\n\nAfterwards, when in the privacy of her own little room at Acol Court,\nshe thought over the whole of that long and dismal day, she oft found\nherself wondering what it was through it all that had seemed so\nterrifying to her, so strange, so unreal.\n\nSomething had struck her as weird: something which she could not then\ndefine; but she was quite sure that it was not merely the unusual\nchilliness of that rainy summer's day, which had caused her to tremble\nso, when--in the vestry--her husband had taken her hand and kissed her.\n\nShe had then looked into his face, which--though the vestry was but ill\nlighted by a tiny very dusty window--she had never seen quite so clearly\nbefore, and then it was that that amazing sense of something awful and\nunreal had descended upon her like a clammy shroud.\n\nHe had very swiftly averted his own gaze from her, but she had seen\nsomething in his face which she did not understand, over which she had\npondered ever since without coming to any solution of this terrible\nriddle.\n\nShe had pondered over it during that interminable journey back from\nDover to Acol. Her husband had not even suggested accompanying her on\nher homeward way, nor did she ask him to do so. She did not even think\nit strange that he gave her no explanation of the reason why he should\nnot return to his lodgings at Acol. She felt like a somnambulist, and\nwondered how soon she would wake and find herself in her small and\nuncomfortable bed at the Court.\n\nThe next day that feeling of unreality was still there; that sensation\nof mystery, of something supernatural which persistently haunted her.\n\nOne thing was quite sure; that all joy had gone out of her life. It was\npossible that love was still there--she did not know--she was too young\nto understand the complex sensations which suddenly had made a woman of\nher ... but it was a joyless love now: and all that she knew of a\ncertainty about her own feelings at the present was that she hoped she\nwould never have to gaze into her lover's face again ... and ... Heaven\nhelp her! ... that he might never touch her again with his lips.\n\nObedient to his behests--hurriedly spoken as she stepped into the chaise\nat Dover after the marriage ceremony--she had wandered out every\nevening beyond the ha-ha into the park, on the chance of meeting him.\n\nThe evenings now were soft and balmy after the rain: the air carried a\npungent smell of dahlias and of oak-leaved geraniums to her nostrils,\nwhich helped her to throw off that miserable feeling of mental lassitude\nwhich had weighed her down ever since that fateful day at Dover. She\nwalked slowly along, treading the young tendrils of the moss, watching\nwith wistful eyes the fleecy clouds, as they appeared through the\nbranches of the elms, scurrying swiftly out towards the sea ... out\ntowards freedom.\n\nBut evening after evening passed away, and she saw no sign of him. She\nfelt the futility, the humiliating uselessness of these nightly\nperegrinations in search of a man who seemed to have a hundred more\ndesirable occupations than that of meeting his wife. But she had not the\npower to drift out towards freedom now. She obeyed mechanically because\nshe must. She had sworn to obey and he had bidden her come and wait for\nhim.\n\nAugust yielded to September, the oak-leaved geraniums withered whilst\nfrom tangled bosquets the melancholy eyes of the Michaelmas daisies\npeeped out questioningly upon the coming autumn.\n\nThen one evening his voice suddenly sounded close to her ear, causing\nher to utter a quickly-smothered cry. It had been the one dull day\nthroughout this past glorious month, the night was dark and a warm\ndrizzle had soaked through to her shoulders and wetted the bottom of her\nkirtle so that it hung heavy and dank round her ankles. He had come to\nher as usual from out the gloom, just as she was about to cross the\nlittle bridge which spanned the sunk fence.\n\nShe realized then, with one of those sudden quivers of her\nsensibilities, to which, alas! she had become so accustomed of late,\nthat he had always met her thus in the gloom--always chosen nights when\nshe could scarce see him distinctly, and this recollection still further\nenhanced that eerie feeling of terror which had assailed her since that\nfateful moment in the vestry.\n\nBut she tried to be natural and even gay with him, though at the first\nwords of tender reproach with which she gently chided him for his\nprolonged absence, he broke into one of those passionate accesses of\nfury which had always frightened her, but now left her strangely cold\nand unresponsive.\n\nWas the subtle change in him as well as in her? She could not say.\nCertain it is that, though his hands had sought hers in the darkness,\nand pressed them vehemently, when first they met he had not attempted to\nkiss her.\n\nFor this she was immeasurably grateful.\n\nHe was obviously constrained, and so was she, and when she opposed a\ncold silence to his outburst of passion, he immediately, and seemingly\nwithout any effort, changed his tone and talked more reasonably, even\nglibly of his work, which he said was awaiting him now in France.\n\nEverything was ready there, he explained, for the great political\npropaganda which he had planned and which could be commenced\nimmediately.\n\nAll that was needed now was the money. In what manner it would be needed\nand for what definite purpose he did not condescend to explain, nor did\nshe care to ask. But she told him that she would be sole mistress of her\nfortune on the 2d of November, the date of her twenty-first birthday.\n\nAfter that he spoke no more of money, but promised to meet her at\nregular intervals during the six weeks which would intervene until the\ngreat day when she would be free to proclaim her marriage and place\nherself unreservedly in the hands of her husband.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIII\n\nTHE ABSENT FRIEND\n\n\nThe prince kept his word, and she was fairly free to see him at least\nonce a week, somewhere within the leafy thicknesses of the park or in\nthe woods, usually at the hour when dusk finally yields to the\noverwhelming embrace of night.\n\nSir Marmaduke was away. In London or Canterbury, she could not say, but\nshe had scarcely seen him since that terrible time, when he came back\nfrom town having left Richard Lambert languishing in disgrace and in\nprison.\n\nOh! how she missed the silent and thoughtful friend who in those days of\npride and of joy had angered her so, because he seemed to stand for\nconscience and for prudence, when she only thought of happiness and of\nlove.\n\nThere was an almost humiliating isolation about her now. Nobody seemed\nto care whither she went, nor when she came home. Mistress de Chavasse\ntalked from time to time about Sue's infatuation for the mysterious\nforeign adventurer, but always as if this were a thing of the past, and\nfrom which Sue herself had long since recovered.\n\nThus there was no one to say her nay, when she went out into the garden\nafter evening repast, and stayed there until the shades of night had\nlong since wrapped the old trees in gloom.\n\nAnd strangely enough this sense of freedom struck her with a chill sense\nof loneliness. She would have loved to suddenly catch sight of Lambert's\nwatchful figure, and to hear his somewhat harsh voice, warning her\nagainst the foreigner.\n\nThis had been wont to irritate her twelve weeks ago. How mysteriously\neverything had altered round her!\n\nAnd yearning for her friend, she wondered what had become of him. The\nlast she had heard was toward the middle of October when Sir Marmaduke,\nhome from one of his frequent journeyings, one day said that Lambert had\nbeen released after ten weeks spent in prison, but that he could not say\nwhither he had gone since then.\n\nAll Sue's questionings anent the young man only brought forth violent\nvituperations from Sir Marmaduke, and cold words of condemnation from\nMistress de Chavasse; therefore, she soon desisted, storing up in her\nheart pathetic memories of the one true friend she had in the world.\n\nShe saw without much excitement, and certainly without tremor, the rapid\nadvance of that date early in November when she would perforce have to\nleave Acol Court in order to follow her husband whithersoever he chose\nto command her.\n\nThe last time that they had met there had been a good deal of talk\nbetween them, about her fortune and its future disposal. He declared\nhimself ready to administer it all himself, as he professed a distrust\nof those who had watched over it so far--Master Skyffington, the lawyer,\nand Sir Marmaduke de Chavasse, both under the control of the Court of\nChancery.\n\nShe explained to him that the bulk of her wealth consisted of\nobligations and shares in the Levant and Russian Companies, her mother\nhaving been the only daughter and heiress of Peter Ford the great\nLevantine and Oriental merchant; her marriage with the proud Earl of\nDover having caused no small measure of comment in Court circles in\nthose days.\n\nThere were also deeds of property owned in Holland, grants of monopolies\nfor trading given by Ivan the Terrible to her grandfather, and receipts\nfor moneys deposited in the great banks of Amsterdam and Vienna. Master\nSkyffington had charge of all those papers now: they represented nearly\nfive hundred thousand pounds of money and she told her husband that they\nwould all be placed in her own keeping, the day she was of age.\n\nHe appeared to lend an inattentive ear to all these explanations, which\nshe gave in those timid tones, which had lately become habitual to her,\nbut once--when she made a slip, and talked about a share which she\npossessed in the Russian Company being worth \u00c2\u00a350,000, he corrected her\nand said it was a good deal more, and gave her some explanations as to\nthe real distribution of her capital, which astonished her by their\nlucidity and left her vaguely wondering how it happened that he knew.\nShe had finally to promise to come to him at the cottage in Acol on the\n2d of November--her twenty-first birthday--directly after her interview\nwith the lawyer and with her guardian, and having obtained possession of\nall the share papers, the obligations, the grants of monopolies and the\nreceipts from the Amsterdam and Vienna banks, to forthwith bring them\nover to the cottage and place them unreservedly in her husband's hands.\n\nAnd she would in her simplicity and ignorance gladly have given every\nscrap of paper--now in Master Skyffington's charge--in exchange for a\nreturn of those happy illusions which had surrounded the early history\nof her love with a halo of romance. She would have given this mysterious\nprince, now her husband, all the money that he wanted for this wonderful\n\"great work\" of his, if he would but give her back some of that\nenthusiastic belief in him which had so mysteriously been killed within\nher, that fateful moment in the vestry at Dover.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIV\n\nNOVEMBER THE 2D\n\n\nA dreary day, with a leaden sky overhead and the monotonous patter of\nincessant rain against the window panes.\n\nSir Marmaduke de Chavasse had just come downstairs, and opening the door\nwhich lead from the hall to the small withdrawing-room on the right, he\nsaw Mistress de Chavasse, half-sitting, half-crouching in one of the\nstiff-backed chairs, which she had drawn close to the fire.\n\nThere was a cheerful blaze on the hearth, and the room itself--being\nsmall--always looked cozier than any other at Acol Court.\n\nNevertheless, Editha's face was pallid and drawn, and she stared into\nthe fire with eyes which seemed aglow with anxiety and even with fear.\nHer cloak was tied loosely about her shoulders, and at sight of Sir\nMarmaduke she started, then rising hurriedly, she put her hood over her\nhead, and went towards the door.\n\n\"Ah! my dear Editha!\" quoth her brother-in-law, lightly greeting her,\n\"up betimes like the lark I see.... Are you going without?\" he added as\nshe made a rapid movement to brush past him and once more made for the\ndoor.\n\n\"Yes!\" she replied dully, \"I must fain move about ... tire myself out\nif I can ... I am consumed with anxiety.\"\n\n\"Indeed?\" he retorted blandly, \"why should you be anxious? Everything is\ngoing splendidly ... and to-night at the latest a fortune of nigh on\n\u00c2\u00a3500,000 will be placed in my hands by a fond and adoring woman.\"\n\nHe caught the glitter in her eyes, that suggestion of power and of\nunspoken threats which she had adopted since the episode in the Bath\nStreet house. For an instant an ugly frown further disfigured his sour\nface: but this frown was only momentary, it soon gave way to a suave\nsmile. He took her hand and lightly touched it with his lips.\n\n\"After which, my dear Editha,\" he said, \"I shall be able to fulfill\nthose obligations, which my heart originally dictated.\"\n\nShe seemed satisfied at this assurance, for she now spoke in less\naggressive tones:\n\n\"Are you so sure of the girl, Marmaduke?\" she asked.\n\n\"Absolutely,\" he replied, his thoughts reverting to a day spent at Dover\nnearly three months ago, when a knot was tied of which fair Editha was\nnot aware, but which rendered Sir Marmaduke de Chavasse very sure of a\nfortune.\n\n\"Yet you have oft told me that Sue's love for her mysterious prince had\nvastly cooled of late!\" urged Editha still anxiously.\n\n\"Why yes! forsooth!\" he retorted grimly, \"Sue's sentimental fancy for\nthe romantic exile hath gone the way of all such unreasoning\nattachments; but she has ventured too far to draw back.... And she will\nnot draw back,\" he concluded significantly.\n\n\"Have a care, Marmaduke! ... the girl is more willful than ye wot of....\nYou may strain at a cord until it snap.\"\n\n\"Pshaw!\" he said, with a shrug of his wide shoulders, \"you are suffering\nfrom vapors, my dear Editha ... or you would grant me more knowledge of\nhow to conduct mine own affairs.... Do you remember, perchance, that the\nbulk of Sue's fortune will be handed over to her this day?\"\n\n\"Aye! I remember!\"\n\n\"Begad, then to-night I'll have that bulk out of her hands. You may take\nan oath on that!\" he declared savagely.\n\n\"And afterwards?\" she asked simply.\n\n\"Afterwards?\"\n\n\"Yes ... afterwards? ... when Sue has discovered how she has been\ntricked? ... Are you not afraid of what she might do? ... Even though\nher money may pass into your hands ... even though you may inveigle her\ninto a clandestine marriage ... she is still the daughter of the late\nEarl of Dover ... she has landed estates, wealth, rich and powerful\nrelations.... There must be an 'afterwards,' remember! ...\"\n\nHis ironical laugh grated on her nerves, as he replied lightly:\n\n\"Pshaw! my dear Editha! of a truth you are not your own calm self\nto-day, else you had understood that forsooth! in the love affairs of\nPrince Am\u00c3\u00a9d\u00c3\u00a9 d'Orl\u00c3\u00a9ans and Lady Susannah Aldmarshe there must and can be\nno 'afterwards.'\"\n\n\"I don't understand you.\"\n\n\"Yet, 'tis simple enough. Sue is my wife.\"\n\n\"Your wife! ...\" she exclaimed.\n\n\"Hush! An you want to scream, I pray you question me not, for what I say\nis bound to startle you. Sue is my wife. I married her, having obtained\na special license to do so in the name of Prince Am\u00c3\u00a9d\u00c3\u00a9 Henri d'Orl\u00c3\u00a9ans,\nand all the rest of the romantic paraphernalia. She is my wife, and\ntherefore, her money and fortune are mine, every penny of it, without\nquestion or demur.\"\n\n\"She will appeal to the Court to have the marriage annulled ... she'll\nrouse public indignation against you to such a pitch that you'll not be\nable to look one of your kith and kin in the face.... The whole shameful\nstory of the mysterious French prince ... your tricks to win the hand of\nyour ward by lying, cheating and willful deceit will resound from one\nend of the country to the other.... What is the use of a mint of money\nif you have to herd with outcasts, and not an honest man will shake you\nby the hand?\"\n\n\"None, my dear Editha, none,\" he replied quietly, \"and 'tis of still\nless use for you to rack your nerves in order to place before me a\ngruesome picture of the miserable social pariah which I should become,\nif the story of my impersonation of a romantic exile for the purpose of\ncapturing the hand of my ward came to the ears of those in authority.\"\n\n\"Whither it doubtless would come!\" she affirmed hotly.\n\n\"Whither it doubtless would come,\" he assented, \"and therefore, my dear\nEditha, once the money is safely in my hands I will leave her Royal\nHighness the Princesse d'Orl\u00c3\u00a9ans in full possession, not only of her\nlanded estates but of the freedom conferred on her by widowhood, for\nPrince Am\u00c3\u00a9d\u00c3\u00a9, her husband, will vanish like the beautiful dream which he\nalways was.\"\n\n\"But how? ... how?\" she reiterated, puzzled, anxious, scenting some\nnefarious scheme more unavowable even than the last.\n\n\"Ah! time will show! ... But he will vanish, my dear Editha, take my\nword on it. Shall we say that he will fly up into the clouds and her\nHighness the Princess will know him no more?\"\n\n\"Then why have married her?\" she exclaimed: some womanly instinct within\nher crying out against this outrage. \"'Twas cruel and unnecessary.\"\n\nHe shrugged his shoulders.\n\n\"Cruel perhaps! ... But surely no more than necessary. I doubt if she\nwould have entrusted her fortune to anyone but her husband.\"\n\n\"Had she ceased to trust her romantic prince then?\"\n\n\"Perhaps. At any rate, I chose to make sure of the prize.... I have\nworked hard to get it and would not fail for lack of a simple ceremony\n... moreover ...\"\n\n\"Moreover?\"\n\n\"Moreover, my dear Editha, there is always the possibility ... remote,\nno doubt ... but nevertheless tangible ... that at some time or other\n... soon or late--who knows?--the little deception practiced on Lady Sue\nmay come to the light of day.... In that case, even if the marriage be\nannulled on the ground of fraud ... which methinks is more than doubtful\n... no one could deny my right as the heiress's ... hem ... shall we\nsay?--temporary husband--to dispose of her wealth as I thought fit. If I\nam to become a pariah and an outcast, as you so eloquently suggested\njust now ... I much prefer being a rich one.... With half a million in\nthe pocket of my doublet the whole world is open to me.\"\n\nThere was so much cool calculation, such callous contempt for the\nfeelings and thoughts of the unfortunate girl whom he had so terribly\nwronged, in this expos\u00c3\u00a9 of the situation, that Mistress de Chavasse\nherself was conscious of a sense of repulsion from the man whom she had\naided hitherto.\n\nShe believed that she held him sufficiently in her power, through her\nknowledge of his schemes and through the help which she was rendering\nhim, to extract a promise from him that he would share his ill-gotten\nspoils in equal portions with her. At one time after the fracas in Bath\nStreet, he had even given her a vague promise of marriage; therefore, he\nhad kept secret from her the relation of that day spent at Dover. Now\nshe felt that even if he were free, she would never consent to link her\nfuture irretrievably with his.\n\nBut her share of the money she meant to have. She was tired of poverty,\ntired of planning and scheming, of debt and humiliation. She was tired\nof her life of dependence at Acol Court, and felt a sufficiency of youth\nand buoyancy in herself yet, to enjoy a final decade of luxury and\namusement in London.\n\nTherefore, she closed her ears to every call of conscience, she shut her\nheart against the lonely young girl who so sadly needed the counsels and\nprotection of a good woman, and she was quite ready to lend a helping\nhand to Sir Marmaduke, at least until a goodly share of Lady Sue's\nfortune was safely within her grasp.\n\nOne point occurred to her now, which caused her to ask anxiously:\n\n\"Have you not made your reckonings without Richard Lambert, Marmaduke?\nHe is back in these parts, you know?\"\n\n\"Ah!\" he ejaculated, with a quick scowl of impatience. \"He has\nreturned?\"\n\n\"Yes! Charity was my informant. He looks very ill, so the wench says: he\nhas been down with fever, it appears, all the while that he was in\nprison, and was only discharged because they feared that he would die.\nHe contrived to work or beg his way back here, and now he is staying in\nthe village.... I thought you would have heard.\"\n\n\"No! I never speak to the old woman ... and Adam Lambert avoids me as he\nwould the plague.... I see as little of them as I can.... I had to be\nprudent these last, final days.\"\n\n\"Heaven grant he may do nothing fatal to-day!\" she murmured.\n\n\"Nay! my dear Editha,\" he retorted with a harsh laugh, \"'tis scarcely\nHeaven's business to look after our schemes. But Lambert can do us very\nlittle harm now! For his own sake, he will keep out of Sue's way.\"\n\n\"At what hour does Master Skyffington arrive?\"\n\n\"In half an hour.\"\n\nThen as he saw that she was putting into effect her former resolve of\ngoing out, despite the rain, and was once more readjusting her hood for\nthat purpose, he opened the door for her, and whispered as he followed\nher out:\n\n\"An you will allow me, my dear Editha, I'll accompany you on your walk\n... we might push on down the Canterbury Road, and perchance meet Master\nSkyffington.... I understand that Sue has been asking for me, and I\nwould prefer to meet her as seldom as possible just now.... This is my\nlast day,\" he concluded with a laugh, \"and I must be doubly careful.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXV\n\nAN INTERLUDE\n\n\nMaster Hymn-of-Praise Busy was vastly perturbed. Try how he might, he\nhad been unable to make any discovery with regard to the mysterious\nevents, which he felt sure were occurring all round him, a discovery\nwhich--had he but made it--would have enabled him to apply with more\nchance of success, for one of the posts in my Lord Protector's secret\nservice, and moreover, would have covered his name with glory.\n\nThis last contingency was always uppermost in his mind. Not from any\nfeeling of personal pride, for of a truth vanity is a mortal sin, but\nbecause Mistress Charity had of late cast uncommonly kind eyes on that\ncringing worm, Master Courage Toogood, and the latter, emboldened by the\nminx's favors, had been more than usually insolent to his betters.\n\nTo have the right to administer serious physical punishment to the\nyouth, and moral reproof to the wench, was part of Master Busy's\ncomprehensive scheme for his own advancement and the confusion of all\nthe miscreants who dwelt in Acol Court. For this he had glued both eye\nand ear to draughty keyholes, had lain for hours under cover of prickly\nthistles in the sunk fence which surrounded the flower garden. For this\nhe now emerged, on that morning of November 2, accompanied by a terrific\nclatter and a volley of soot from out the depth of the monumental\nchimney in the hall of Acol Court.\n\nAs soon as he had recovered sufficient breath, and shaken off some of\nthe soot from his hair and face, he looked solemnly about him, and was\nconfronted by two pairs of eyes round with astonishment and two mouths\nagape with surprise and with fear.\n\nMistress Charity and Master Courage Toogood--interrupted in the midst of\ntheir animated conversation--were now speechless with terror, at sight\nof this black apparition, which, literally, had descended on them from\nthe skies.\n\n\"Lud love ye, Master Busy!\" ejaculated Mistress Charity, who was the\nfirst to recognize in the sooty wraith the manly form of her betrothed,\n\"where have ye come from, pray?\"\n\n\"Have you been scouring the chimney, good master?\" queried Master\nCourage, with some diffidence, for the saintly man looked somewhat out\nof humor.\n\n\"No!\" replied Hymn-of-Praise solemnly, \"I have not. But I tell ye both\nthat my hour hath come. I knew that something was happening in this\nhouse, and I climbed up that chimney in order to find out what it was.\"\n\nPardonable curiosity caused Mistress Charity to venture a little nearer\nto the soot-covered figure of her adorer.\n\n\"And did you hear anything, Master Busy?\" she asked eagerly. \"I did see\nSir Marmaduke and the mistress in close conversation here this\nmorning.\"\n\n\"So they thought,\" said Master Hymn-of-Praise with weird significance.\n\n\"Well? ... And what happened, good master?\"\n\n\"Thou beest in too mighty an hurry, mistress,\" he retorted with quiet\ndignity. \"I am under no obligation to report matters to thee.\"\n\n\"Oh! but Master Busy,\" she rejoined coyly, \"methought I was to be your\n... hem ... thy partner in life ... and so ...\"\n\n\"My partner? My partner, didst thou say, sweet Charity? ... Nay, then,\nan thou'lt permit me to salute thee with a kiss, I'll tell thee all I\nknow.\"\n\nAnd in asking for that chaste salute we may assume that Master\nHymn-of-Praise was actuated with at least an equal desire to please\nMistress Charity, to gratify his own wishes, and to effectually annoy\nMaster Courage.\n\nBut Mistress Charity was actuated by curiosity alone, and without\nthought of her betrothed's grimy appearance, she presented her cheek to\nhim for the kiss.\n\nThe result caused Master Courage an uncontrollable fit of hilarity.\n\n\"Oh, mistress,\" he said, pointing to the black imprint left on her face\nby her lover's kiss, \"you should gaze into a mirror now.\"\n\nBut already Mistress Charity had guessed what had occurred, her good\nhumor vanished, and she began scouring her cheek with her pinner.\n\n\"I'll never forgive you, master,\" she said crossly. \"You had no right to\n... hem ... with your face in that condition.... And you have not yet\ntold us what happened.\"\n\n\"What happened?\"\n\n\"Aye! you promised to tell me if I allowed you to kiss me. 'Tis\ndone....\"\n\n\"I well nigh broke my back,\" said Master Busy sententiously. \"I hurt my\nknee ... that is what happened.... I am well-nigh choked with soot....\nUgh! ... that is what happened.\"\n\n\"Lud love you, Master Busy,\" she retorted with a saucy toss of her head,\n\"I trust your life's partner will not need to hide herself in chimneys.\"\n\n\"Listen, wench, and I'll tell thee. No kind of servant of my Lord\nProtector's should ever be called upon to hide in chimneys. They are not\ncomfortable and they are not clean.\"\n\n\"Bless the man!\" she cried angrily, \"are you ever going to tell us what\ndid happen whilst you were there?\"\n\n\"I was about to come to that point,\" he said imperturbably, \"hadst thou\nnot interrupted me. What with holding on so as not to fall, and the soot\nfalling in my ears....\"\n\n\"Aye! aye! ...\"\n\n\"I heard nothing,\" he concluded solemnly. \"Master Courage,\" he added\nwith becoming severity, seeing that the youth was on the verge of\nmaking a ribald remark, which of necessity had to be checked betimes,\n\"come into my room with me and help me to clean the traces of my\ndifficult task from off my person. Come!\"\n\nAnd with ominous significance, he approached the young scoffer, his hand\non an exact level with the latter's ear, his right foot raised to\nindicate a possible means of enforcing obedience to his commands.\n\nOn the whole, Master Courage thought it wise to repress both his\nhilarity and his pertinent remarks, and to follow the pompous, if\nbegrimed, butler to the latter's room upstairs.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVI\n\nTHE OUTCAST\n\n\nIt took Mistress Charity some little time to recover her breath.\n\nShe had thrown herself into a chair, with her pinner over her face, in\nan uncontrollable fit of laughter.\n\nWhen this outburst of hilarity had subsided, she sat up, and looked\nround her with eyes still streaming with merry tears.\n\nBut the laughter suddenly died on her lips and the merriment out of her\neyes. A dull, tired voice had just said feebly:\n\n\"Is Sir Marmaduke de Chavasse within?\"\n\nCharity jumped up from the chair and stared stupidly at the speaker.\n\n\"The Lord love you, Master Richard Lambert,\" she murmured. \"I thought\nyou were your ghost!\"\n\n\"Forgive me, mistress, if I have frightened you,\" he said. \"It is mine\nown self, I give you assurance of that, and I, fain would have speech\nwith Sir Marmaduke.\"\n\nMistress Charity was visibly embarrassed. She began mechanically to rub\nthe black stain on her cheek.\n\n\"Sir Marmaduke is without just at present, Master Lambert,\" she\nstammered shyly, \"... and ...\"\n\n\"Yes? ... and? ...\" he asked, \"what is it, wench? ... speak out? ...\"\n\n\"Sir Marmaduke gave orders, Master Lambert,\" she began with obvious\nreluctance, \"that ...\"\n\nShe paused, and he concluded the sentence for her:\n\n\"That I was not to be allowed inside his house.... Was that it?\"\n\n\"Alas! yes, good master.\"\n\n\"Never mind, girl,\" he rejoined as he deliberately crossed the hall and\nsat down in the chair which she had just vacated. \"You have done your\nduty: but you could not help admitting me, could you? since I walked in\nof mine own accord ... and now that I am here I will remain until I have\nseen Sir Marmaduke....\"\n\n\"Well! of a truth, good master,\" she said with a smile, for 'twas but\nnatural that her feminine sympathies should be on the side of a young\nand good-looking man, somewhat in her own sphere of life, as against the\nill-humored, parsimonious master whom she served, \"an you sit there so\ndeterminedly, I cannot prevent you, can I? ...\"\n\nThen as she perceived the look of misery on the young man's face, his\npale cheeks, his otherwise vigorous frame obviously attenuated by fear,\nthe motherly instinct present in every good woman's heart caused her to\ngo up to him and to address him timidly, offering such humble solace as\nher simple heart could dictate:\n\n\"Lud preserve you, good master, I pray you do not take on so.... You\nknow Master Courage and I, now, never believed all those stories about\nye. Of a truth Master Busy, he had his own views, but then ... you see,\ngood master, he and I do not always agree, even though I own that he is\nvastly clever with his discoveries and his clews; but Master Courage now\n... Master Courage is a wonderful lad ... and he thinks that you are a\npersecuted hero! ... and I am bound to say that I, too, hold that\nview....\"\n\n\"Thank you! ... thank you, kind mistress,\" said Lambert, smiling despite\nhis dejection, at the girl's impulsive efforts at consolation.\n\nHis head had sunk down on his breast, and he sat there in the\nhigh-backed chair, one hand resting on each leather-covered arm, his\npale face showing almost ghostlike against the dark background, and with\nthe faint November light illumining the dark-circled eyes, the bloodless\nlips, and deeply frowning brow.\n\nMistress Charity gazed down on him with mute and kindly compassion.\n\nThen suddenly a slight rustling noise as of a kirtle sweeping the\npolished oak of the stairs caused the girl to look up, then to pause a\nbrief while, as if what she had now seen had brought forth a new train\nof thought; finally, she tiptoed silently out through the door of the\ndining-hall.\n\n\"Charity! Mistress Charity, I want you! ...\" called Lady Sue from\nabove.\n\nWe must presume, however, that the wench had closed the heavy door\nbehind her, for certainly she did not come in answer to the call. On the\nother hand, Richard Lambert had heard it; he sprang to his feet and saw\nSue descending the stairs.\n\nShe saw him, too, and it seemed as if at sight of him she had turned and\nmeant to fly. But a word from him detained her.\n\n\"Sue!\"\n\nOnly once had he thus called her by her name before, that long ago night\nin the woods, but now the cry came from out his heart, brought forth by\nhis misery and his sorrow, his sense of terrible injustice and of an\nirretrievable wrong.\n\nIt never occurred to her to resent the familiarity. At sound of her name\nthus spoken by him she had looked down from the stairs and seen his\npallid face turned up to her in such heartrending appeal for sympathy,\nthat all her womanly instincts of tenderness and pity were aroused, all\nher old feeling of trustful friendship for him.\n\nShe, too, felt much of that loneliness which his yearning eyes expressed\nso pathetically; she, too, was conscious of grave injustice and of an\nirretrievable wrong, and her heart went out to him immediately in\nkindness and in love.\n\n\"Don't go, for pity's sake,\" he added entreatingly, for he thought that\nshe meant to turn away from him; \"surely you will not begrudge me a few\nwords of kindness. I have gone through a great deal since I saw\nyou....\"\n\nShe descended a few steps, her delicate hand still resting on the\nbanisters, her silken kirtle making a soft swishing noise against the\npolished oak of the stairs. It was a solace to him, even to watch her\nnow. The sight of his adored mistress was balm to his aching eyes. Yet\nhe was quick to note--with that sharp intuition peculiar to Love--that\nher dear face had lost much of its brightness, of its youth, of its joy\nof living. She was as exquisite to look on as ever, but she seemed\nolder, more gentle, and, alas! a trifle sad.\n\n\"I heard you had been ill,\" she said softly, \"I was very sorry, believe\nme, but ... Oh! do you not think,\" she added with sudden inexplicable\npathos, whilst she felt hot tears rising to her eyes and causing her\nvoice to quiver, \"do you not think that an interview between us now can\nonly be painful to us both?\"\n\nHe mistook the intention of her words, as was only natural, and whilst\nshe mistrusted her own feelings for him, fearing to betray that yearning\nfor his friendship and his consolation, which had so suddenly\noverwhelmed her at sight of him, he thought that she feared the\ninterview because of her condemnation of him.\n\n\"Then you believed me guilty?\" he said sadly. \"They told you this\nhideous tale of me, and you believed them, without giving the absent\none, who alas! could not speak in his own defense, the benefit of the\ndoubt.\"\n\nFor one of those subtle reasons of which women alone possess the secret,\nand which will forever remain inexplicable to the more logical sex, she\nsteeled her heart against him, even when her entire sensibilities went\nout to him in passionate sympathy.\n\n\"I could not help but believe, good master,\" she said a little coldly.\n\"Sir Marmaduke de Chavasse, who, with all his faults of temper, is a man\nof honor, confirmed that horrible story which appeared in the newspaper\nand of which everyone in Thanet hath been talking these weeks past.\"\n\n\"And am _I_ not a man of honor?\" he retorted hotly. \"Because I am poor\nand must work in order to live, am _I_ to be condemned unheard? Is a\nwhole life's record of self-education and honest labor to be thus\nobliterated by the word of my most bitter enemy?\"\n\n\"Your bitter enemy? ...\" she asked. \"Sir Marmaduke? ...\"\n\n\"Aye! Sir Marmaduke de Chavasse. It seems passing strange, does it not?\"\nhe rejoined bitterly. \"Yet somehow in my heart, I feel that Sir\nMarmaduke hates me, with a violent and passionate hatred. Nay! I know\nit, though I can explain neither its cause nor its ultimate aim....\"\n\nHe drew nearer to the stairs whereon she still stood, her graceful\nfigure slightly leaning towards him; he now stood close to her, his head\njust below the level of her own; his hand had he dared to raise it,\ncould have rested on hers.\n\n\"Sue! my beautiful and worshiped lady,\" he cried impassionedly, \"I\nentreat you to look into my eyes! ... Can you see in them the reflex of\nthose shameful deeds which have been imputed to me? Do I look like a\nliar and a cheat? In the name of pity and of justice, for the sweet sake\nof our first days of friendship, I beg of you not to condemn me\nunheard.\"\n\nHe lowered his head, and rested his aching brow against her cool, white\nhand. She did not withdraw it, for a great joy had suddenly filled her\nheart, mingling with its sadness, a sense of security and of bitter, yet\nreal, happiness pervaded her whole being: a happiness which she could\nnot--wished not--to explain, but which prompted her to stoop yet further\ntowards him, and to touch his hair with her lips.\n\nHot tears which he tried vainly to repress fell upon her fingers. He had\nfelt the kiss descending on him almost like a benediction. The exquisite\nfragrance of her person filled his soul with a great delight which was\nalmost pain. Never had he loved her so ardently, so passionately, as at\nthis moment, when he felt that she too loved him, and yet was lost to\nhim irrevocably.\n\n\"Nay! but I will hear you, good master,\" she murmured with infinite\ngentleness, \"for the sake of that friendship, and because now that I\nhave seen you again I no longer believe any evil of you.\"\n\n\"God bless my dear lady,\" he replied fervently. \"Heaven is my witness\nthat I am innocent of those abominable crimes imputed to me. Sir\nMarmaduke took me to that house of evil, and a cruel plot was there\nconcocted to make me appear before all men as a liar and a cheat, and to\ndisgrace me before the world and before you. That the object of this\nplot was to part me from you,\" added Richard Lambert more calmly and\nfirmly, \"I am absolutely confident; what its deeper motive was I dare\nnot even think. It was known that I ... loved you, Sue ... that I would\ngive my life to save you from trouble ... I was your slave, your\nwatch-dog.... I was forcibly removed, torn from you, my name disgraced,\nmy health broken down.... But my life was not for them ... it belongs to\nmy lady alone.... Heaven would not allow it to be sacrificed to their\nvillainous schemes. I fought against sickness and death with all the\nenergy of despair.... It was a hand-to-hand fight, for discouragement,\nand anon despair, ranged themselves among my foes.... And now I have\ncome back,\" he said with proud energy, \"broken mayhap, yet still\nstanding ... a snapped oak yet full of vigor, yet ... I have come back,\nand with God's help will be even with them yet.\"\n\nHe had straightened his young figure, and his strong, somewhat harsh\nvoice echoed through the oak-paneled hall. He cared not if all the world\nheard him, if his enemies lurked about striving to spy upon him. His\nprofession of love and of service to his lady was the sole remaining\npride of his life, and now that he knew that she believed and trusted\nhim, he longed for every man to hear what he had to say.\n\n\"Nay! what you say, kind Richard, fills me with dread,\" said Sue after a\nlittle pause. \"I am glad ... glad that you have come back.... For some\nweeks, nay, months past, I have had the presentiment of some coming\nevil.... I have ... I have felt lonely and....\"\n\n\"Not unhappy?\" he asked with his usual earnestness. \"I would not have my\nlady unhappy for all the treasures of this world.\"\n\n\"No!\" she replied meditatively, striving to be conscious of her own\nfeelings, \"I do not think that I am unhappy ... only anxious ... and ...\na little lonely: that is all.... Sir Marmaduke is oft away: when he is\nat home, I scarce ever see him, and he but rarely speaks to me ... and\nmethinks there is but scant sympathy 'twixt Mistress de Chavasse and me,\nthough she is kind at times in her way.\"\n\nThen she turned her eyes, bright with unshed tears, down again to him.\n\n\"But all seems right again!\" she said with a sweet, sad smile, \"now that\nyou have come back, my dear ... dear friend!\"\n\n\"God bless you for these words!\"\n\n\"I grieved terribly when I heard ... about you ... at first ...\" she\nsaid almost gaily now, \"yet somehow I could not believe it all ... and\nnow....\"\n\n\"Yes? ... and now?\" he asked.\n\n\"Now I believe in you,\" she replied simply. \"I believe that you care for\nme, and that you are my friend.\"\n\n\"Your friend, indeed, for I would give my life for you.\"\n\nOnce more he stooped, but now he kissed her hand. He was her friend, and\nhad the right to do this. He had gradually mastered his emotion, his\nsense of wrong, and with that exquisite selflessness which real love\nalone can kindle in a human heart, he had succeeded in putting aside all\nthought of his own great misery, his helplessness and the hopelessness\nof his position, and remembered only that she looked fragile, a little\nolder, sadder, and had need of his help.\n\n\"And now, sweet lady,\" he said, forcing himself to speak calmly of that\nwhich always set his heart and senses into a turmoil of passionate\njealousy, \"will you tell me something about him.\"\n\n\"Him?\"\n\n\"The prince....\" he suggested.\n\nBut she shook her head resolutely.\n\n\"No, kind Richard,\" she said gently, \"I will not speak to you of the\nprince. I know that you do not think well of him.... I wish to look upon\nyou as my friend, and I could not do that if you spoke ill of him,\nbecause ...\"\n\nShe paused, for what she now had to tell him was very hard to say, and\nshe knew what a terrible blow she would be dealing to his heart, from\nthe wild beating of her own.\n\n\"Yes?\" he asked. \"Because? ...\"\n\n\"Because he is my husband,\" she whispered.\n\nHer head fell forward on her breast. She would not trust herself to look\nat him now, for she knew that the sight of his grief was more than she\ncould bear. She was conscious that at her words he had drawn his hand\naway from hers, but he spoke no word, nor did the faintest exclamation\nescape his lips.\n\nThus they remained for a few moments longer side by side: she slightly\nabove him, with head bent, with hot tears falling slowly from her\ndowncast eyes, her heart well-nigh breaking with the consciousness of\nthe irreparable; he somewhat below, silent too, and rigid, all passion,\nall emotion, love even, numbed momentarily by the violence, the\nsuddenness of this terrible blow.\n\nThen without a word, without a sigh or look, he turned, and she heard\nhis footsteps echoing across the hall, then dying away on the threshold\nof the door beyond. Anon the door itself closed to with a dull bang\nwhich seemed to find an echo in her heart like the tolling of a passing\nbell.\n\nThen only did she raise her head, and look about her. The hall was\ndeserted and seemed infinitely lonely, silent, and grim. The young\ngirl-wife, who had just found a friend only to lose him again, called\nout in mute appeal to this old house, the oak-covered walls, the very\nstones themselves, for sympathy.\n\nShe was so infinitely, so immeasurably lonely, with that awful,\nirretrievable day at Dover behind her, with all its dreariness, its\nsilent solemnity, its weird finish in the vestry, the ring upon her\nfinger, her troth plighted to a man whom she feared and no longer loved.\n\nOh! the pity of it all! the broken young life! the vanished dreams!\n\nSue bent her head down upon her hands, her lips touched her own fingers\nthere where her friend's had rested in gratitude and love, and she\ncried, cried like a broken-hearted woman, cried for her lost illusions,\nand the end of her brief romance!\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVII\n\nLADY SUE'S FORTUNE\n\n\nLess than an hour later four people were assembled in the small\nwithdrawing-room of Acol Court.\n\nMaster Skyffington sat behind a central table, a little pompous of\nmanner, clad in sober black with well-starched linen cuffs and collar,\nhis scanty hair closely cropped, his thin hands fingering with assurance\nand perfect calm the various documents laid out before him. Near him Sir\nMarmaduke de Chavasse, sitting with his back to the dim November light,\nwhich vainly strove to penetrate the tiny glass panes of the casement\nwindows.\n\nIn a more remote corner of the room sat Editha de Chavasse, vainly\ntrying to conceal the agitation which her trembling hands, her quivering\nface and restless eyes persistently betrayed. And beside the central\ntable, near Master Skyffington and facing Sir Marmaduke, was Lady\nSusannah Aldmarshe, only daughter and heiress of the late Earl of Dover,\nthis day aged twenty-one years, and about to receive from the hands of\nher legal guardians the vast fortune which her father had bequeathed to\nher, and which was to become absolutely hers this day to dispose of as\nshe list.\n\n\"And now, my dear child,\" said Master Skyffington with due solemnity,\nwhen he had disposed a number of documents and papers in methodical\norder upon the table, \"let me briefly explain to you the object ... hem\n... of this momentous meeting here to-day.\"\n\n\"I am all attention, master,\" said Sue vaguely, and her eyes wide-open,\nobviously absent, she gazed fixedly on the silhouette of Sir Marmaduke,\ngrimly outlined against the grayish window-panes.\n\n\"I must tell you, my dear child,\" resumed Master Skyffington after a\nslight pause, during which he had studied with vague puzzledom the\ninscrutable face of the young girl, \"I must tell you that your late\nfather, the noble Earl of Dover, had married the heiress of Peter Ford,\nthe wealthiest merchant this country hath ever known. She was your own\nlamented mother, and the whole of her fortune, passing through her\nhusband's hands, hath now devolved upon you. My much-esteemed patron--I\nmay venture to say friend--Sir Marmaduke de Chavasse, having been\nappointed your legal guardian by the Court of Chancery, and I myself\nbeing thereupon named the repository of your securities, these have been\nadministered by me up to now.... You are listening to me, are you not,\nmy dear young lady?\"\n\nThe question was indeed necessary, for even to Master Skyffington's\nunobservant mind it was apparent that Sue's eyes had a look of aloofness\nin them, of detachment from her surroundings, which was altogether\ninexplicable to the worthy attorney's practical sense of the due fitness\nof things.\n\nAt his query she made a sudden effort to bring her thoughts back from\nthe past to the present, to drag her heart and her aching brain away\nfrom that half-hour spent in the hall, from that conversation with her\nfriend, from the recollection of that terribly cruel blow which she had\nbeen forced to deal to the man who loved her best in all the world.\n\n\"Yes, yes, kind master,\" she said, \"I am listening.\"\n\nAnd she fixed her eyes resolutely on the attorney's solemn face, forcing\nher mind to grasp what he was about to say.\n\n\"By the terms of your noble father's will,\" continued Master\nSkyffington, as soon as he had satisfied himself that he at last held\nthe heiress's attention, \"the securities, receipts and all other moneys\nare to be given over absolutely and unconditionally into your own hands\non your twenty-first birthday.\"\n\n\"Which is to-day,\" said Sue simply.\n\n\"Which is to-day,\" assented the lawyer. \"The securities, receipts and\nother bonds, grants of monopolies and so forth lie before you on this\ntable.... They represent in value over half a million of English\nmoney.... A very large sum indeed for so young a girl to have full\ncontrol of.... Nevertheless, it is yours absolutely and unconditionally,\naccording to the wishes of your late noble father ... and Sir Marmaduke\nde Chavasse, your late guardian, and I myself, have met you here this\nday for the express purpose of handing these securities, grants and\nreceipts over to you, and to obtain in exchange your own properly\nattested signature in full discharge of any further obligation on our\npart.\"\n\nMaster Skyffington was earnestly gazing into the young girl's face,\nwhilst he thus literally dangled before her the golden treasures of\nwealth, which were about to become absolutely her own. He thought, not\nunnaturally, that a girl of her tender years, brought up in the\nloneliness and seclusion of a not too luxurious home, would feel in a\nmeasure dazzled and certainly overjoyed at the brilliant prospect which\nsuch independent and enormous wealth opened out before her.\n\nBut the amiable attorney was vastly disappointed to see neither\npleasure, nor even interest, expressed in Lady Sue's face, which on this\njoyous and momentous occasion looked unnaturally calm and pallid. Even\nnow when he paused expectant and eager, waiting for some comment or\nexclamation of approval or joy from her, she was silent for a while, and\nthen said in a stolidly inquiring tone:\n\n\"Then after to-day ... I shall have full control of my money?\"\n\n\"Absolute control, my dear young lady,\" he rejoined, feeling strangely\nperturbed at this absence of emotion.\n\n\"And no one ... after to-day ... will have the right to inquire as to\nthe use I make of these securities, grants or whatever you, Master\nSkyffington, have called them?\" she continued with the same placidity.\n\n\"No one, of a surety, my dear Sue,\" here interposed Sir Marmaduke,\nspeaking in his usual harsh and dictatorial way, \"but this is a strange\nand somewhat peremptory question for a young maid to put at this\njuncture. Master Skyffington and I myself had hoped that you would\nlisten to counsels of prudence, and would allow him, who hath already\nadministered your fortune in a vastly able manner, to continue so to do,\nfor a while at any rate.\"\n\n\"That question we can discuss later on, Sir Marmaduke,\" said Sue now,\nwith sudden hauteur. \"Shall we proceed with our business, master?\" she\nadded, turning deliberately to the lawyer, ignoring with calm disdain\nthe very presence of her late guardian.\n\nThe studied contempt of his ward's manner, however, seemed not to\ndisturb the serenity of Sir Marmaduke to any appreciable extent. Casting\na quick, inquisitorial glance at Sue, he shrugged his shoulders in token\nof indifference and said no more.\n\n\"Certainly, certainly,\" responded Master Skyffington, somewhat\nembarrassed, \"my dear young lady ... hem ... as ... er ... as you wish\n... but ...\"\n\nThen he turned deliberately to Sir Marmaduke, once more bringing him\ninto the proceedings, and tacitly condemning her ladyship's\nextraordinary attitude towards his distinguished patron.\n\n\"Having now explained to Lady Sue Aldmarshe the terms of her noble\nfather's will,\" he said, \"methinks that she is ready to receive the\nmoneys from our hands, good Sir Marmaduke, and thereupon to give us the\nproper receipt prescribed by law, for the same ...\"\n\nHe checked himself for a moment, and then made a respectful, if pointed,\nsuggestion:\n\n\"Mistress de Chavasse?\" he said inquiringly.\n\n\"Mistress de Chavasse is a member of the family,\" replied Sir Marmaduke,\n\"the business can be transacted in her presence.\"\n\n\"Nothing therefore remains to be said, my dear young lady,\" rejoined\nMaster Skyffington, once more speaking directly to Sue and placing his\nlean hands with fingers outstretched, over the bundles of papers lying\nbefore him. \"Here are your securities, your grants, moneys and receipts,\nworth \u00c2\u00a3500,000 of the present currency of this realm.... These I, in\nmine own name and that of my honored friend and patron, Sir Marmaduke de\nChavasse, do hereby hand over to you. You will, I pray, verify and sign\nthe receipt in proper and due form.\"\n\nHe began sorting and overlooking the papers, muttering half audibly the\nwhile, as he transferred each bundle from his own side of the table to\nthat beside which Lady Sue was sitting:\n\n\"The deeds of property in Holland ... hem.... Receipt of moneys\ndeposited at the bank of Amsterdam.... The same from the Bank of\nVienna.... Grant of monopoly for the hemp trade in Russia.... hem ...\"\n\nThus he mumbled for some time, as these papers, representing a fortune,\npassed out of his keeping into those of a young maid but recently out of\nher teens. Sue watched him silently and placidly, just as she had done\nthroughout this momentous interview, which was, of a truth, the starting\npoint of her independent life.\n\nHer face expressed neither joy nor excitement of any kind. She knew that\nall the wealth which now lay before her, would only pass briefly through\nher hands. She knew that the prince--her husband--was waiting for it\neven now. Doubtless, he was counting the hours when his young wife's\nvast fortune would come to him as the realization of all his dreams.\n\nIn spite of her present disbelief in his love, in spite of the bitter\nknowledge that her own had waned, Sue had no misgivings as yet as to the\nhonor, the truth, the loyalty of the man whose name she now bore. Her\nillusions were gone, her romance had become dull reality, but to one\nthought she clung with all the tenacity of despair, and that was to the\nillusion that Prince Am\u00c3\u00a9d\u00c3\u00a9 d'Orl\u00c3\u00a9ans was the selfless patriot, the\nregenerator of downtrodden France, which he represented himself to be.\n\nBecause of that belief she welcomed the wealth, which she would this day\nbe able to place in his hands. Her own girlish dreams had vanished, but\nher temperament was far too romantic and too poetic not to recreate\nillusions, even when the old ones had been so ruthlessly shattered.\n\nBut this recreation would occur anon--not just now, not at the very\nmoment when her heart ached with an intolerable pain at thought of the\nsorrow which she had caused to her one friend. Presently, no doubt, when\nshe met her husband, when his usual grandiloquent phrases had once more\nsucceeded in arousing her enthusiasm for the cause which he pleaded, she\nwould once more feel serene and happy at thought of the help which she,\nwith her great wealth, would be giving him; for the nonce the whole\ntransaction grated on her sense of romance; money passing from hand to\nhand, a man waiting somewhere in the dark to receive wealth from a\nwoman's hand.\n\nMaster Skyffington desired her to look over the papers, ere she signed\nthe formal receipt for them, but she waved them gently aside:\n\n\"Quite unnecessary, kind master,\" she said decisively, \"since I receive\nthem at your hands.\"\n\nShe bent over the document which the lawyer now placed before her, and\ntook the pen from him.\n\n\"Where shall I sign?\" she asked.\n\nSir Marmaduke and Editha de Chavasse watched her keenly, as with a bold\nstroke of the pen she wrote her name across the receipt.\n\n\"Now the papers, please, master,\" said Lady Sue peremptorily.\n\nBut the prudent lawyer had still a word of protest to enter here.\n\n\"My dear young lady,\" he said tentatively, awed in spite of himself by\nthe self-possessed behavior of a maid whom up to now he had regarded as\na mere child, \"let me, as a man of vast experience in such matters,\nrepeat to you the well-meant advice which Sir Marmaduke ...\"\n\nBut she checked him decisively, though kindly.\n\n\"You said, Master Skyffington, did you not,\" she said, \"that after\nto-day no one had the slightest control over my actions or over my\nfortune?\"\n\n\"That is so, certainly,\" he rejoined, \"but ...\"\n\n\"Well, then, kind master, I pray you,\" she said authoritatively, \"to\nhand me over all those securities, grants and moneys, for which I have\njust signed a receipt.\"\n\nThere was naught to do for a punctilious lawyer, as was Master\nSkyffington, but to obey forthwith. This he did, without another word,\ncollecting the various bundles of paper and placing them one by one in\nthe brown leather wallet which he had brought for the purpose. Sue\nwatched him quietly, and when the last of the important documents had\nbeen deposited in the wallet, she held out her hand for it.\n\nWith a grave bow, and an unconsciously pompous gesture, Master\nSkyffington, attorney-at-law, handed over that wallet which now\ncontained a fortune to Lady Susannah Aldmarshe.\n\nShe took it, and graciously bowed her head to him in acknowledgment.\nThen, after a slight, distinctly haughty nod to Sir Marmaduke and to\nEditha, she turned and walked silently out of the room.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVIII\n\nHUSBAND AND WIFE\n\n\nMistress Martha Lambert was a dignified old woman, on whose wrinkled\nface stern virtues, sedulously practiced, had left their lasting\nimprint. Among these virtues which she had thus somewhat ruthlessly\nexercised throughout her long life, cleanliness and orderliness stood\nout pre-eminently. They undoubtedly had brought some of the deepest\nfurrows round her eyes and mouth, as indeed they had done round those of\nAdam Lambert, who having lived with her all his life, had had to suffer\nfrom her passion of scrubbing and tidying more than anyone else.\n\nBut her cottage was resplendent: her chief virtues being apparent in\nevery nook and corner of the orderly little rooms which formed her home\nand that of the two lads whom a dying friend had entrusted to her care.\n\nThe parlor below, with its highly polished bits of furniture, its\nspotless wooden floor and whitewashed walls, was a miracle of\ncleanliness. The table in the center was laid with a snowy white cloth,\non it the pewter candlesticks shone like antique silver. Two\nstraight-backed mahogany chairs were drawn cozily near to the hearth,\nwherein burned a bright fire made up of ash logs. There was a quaint\ncircular mirror in a gilt frame over the hearth, a relic of former,\nsomewhat more prosperous times.\n\nIn one of the chairs lolled the mysterious lodger, whom a strange Fate\nin a perverse mood seemed to have wafted to this isolated little cottage\non the outskirts of the loneliest village in Thanet.\n\nPrince Am\u00c3\u00a9d\u00c3\u00a9 d'Orl\u00c3\u00a9ans was puffing at that strange weed which of late\nhad taken such marked hold of most men, tending to idleness in them, for\nit caused them to sit staring at the smoke which they drew from pipes\nmade of clay; surely the Lord had never intended such strange doings,\nand Mistress Martha would willingly have protested against the\nunpleasant odor thus created by her lodger when he was puffing away,\nonly that she stood somewhat in awe of his ill-humor and of his violent\nlanguage, especially when Adam himself was from home.\n\nOn these occasions--such, for instance, as the present one--she had,\nperforce, to be content with additional efforts at cleanliness, and, as\nshe was convinced that so much smoke must be conducive to soot and dirt,\nshe plied her dusting-cloth with redoubled vigor and energy. Whilst the\nprince lolled and pulled at his clay pipe, she busied herself all round\nthe tiny room, polishing the backs of the old elm chairs, and the brass\nhandles of the chest of drawers.\n\n\"How much longer are you going to fuss about, my good woman?\" quoth\nPrince Am\u00c3\u00a9d\u00c3\u00a9 d'Orl\u00c3\u00a9ans impatiently after a while. \"This shuffling round\nme irritates my nerves.\"\n\nMistress Martha, however, suffered from deafness. She could see from the\nquick, angry turn of the head that her lodger was addressing her, but\ndid not catch his words. She drew a little nearer, bending her ear to\nhim.\n\n\"Eh? ... what?\" she queried in that high-pitched voice peculiar to the\ndeaf. \"I am somewhat hard of hearing just now. I did not hear thee.\"\n\nBut he pushed her roughly aside with a jerk of his elbow.\n\n\"Go away!\" he said impatiently. \"Do not worry me!\"\n\n\"Ah! the little pigs?\" she rejoined blithely. \"I thank thee ... they be\ndoing nicely, thank the Lord ... six of them and ... eh? what? ... I'm a\nbit hard of hearing these times.\"\n\nHe had some difficulty in keeping up even a semblance of calm. The\nplacidity of the old Quakeress irritated him beyond endurance. He\ndreaded the return of Adam Lambert from his work, and worse still, he\nfeared the arrival of Richard. Fortunately he had gathered from Martha\nthat the young man had come home early in the day in a state of high\nnervous tension, bordering on acute fever. He had neither eaten nor\ndrunk, but after tidying his clothes and reassuring her as to his future\nmovements, he had sallied out into the woods and had not returned since\nthen.\n\nSir Marmaduke had quickly arrived at the conclusion that Richard Lambert\nhad seen and spoken to Lady Sue and had learned from her that she was\nnow irrevocably married to him, whom she always called her prince.\nDoubtless, the young man was frenzied with grief, and in his weak state\nof health after the terrible happenings of the past few weeks, would\nmayhap, either go raving mad, or end his miserable existence over the\ncliffs. Either eventuality would suit Sir Marmaduke admirably, and he\nsighed with satisfaction at the thought that the knot between the\nheiress and himself was indeed tied sufficiently firm now to ensure her\nobedience to his will.\n\nThere was to be one more scene in the brief and cruel drama which he had\ndevised for the hoodwinking and final spoliation of a young and\ninexperienced girl. She had earlier in the day been placed in possession\nof all the negotiable part of her fortune. This, though by no means\nrepresenting the whole of her wealth, which also lay in landed estates,\nwas nevertheless of such magnitude that the thought of its possession\ncaused every fiber in Sir Marmaduke's body to thrill with the delight of\nexpectancy.\n\nOne more brief scene in the drama: the handing over of that vast\nfortune, by the young girl-wife--blindly and obediently--to the man whom\nshe believed to be her husband. Once that scene enacted, the curtain\nwould fall on the love episode 'twixt a romantic and ignorant maid and\nthe most daring scoundrel that had ever committed crime to obtain a\nfortune.\n\nIn anticipation of that last and magnificent _d\u00c3\u00a9nouement_, Sir Marmaduke\nhad once more donned the disguise of the exiled Orl\u00c3\u00a9ans prince: the\nelaborate clothes, the thick perruque, the black silk shade over the\nleft eye, which gave him such a sinister expression.\n\nNow he was literally devoured with the burning desire to see Sue\narriving with that wallet in her hand, which contained securities and\ngrants to the value of \u00c2\u00a3500,000. A brief interlude with her, a few words\nof perfunctory affection, a few assurances of good faith, and he--as her\nprincely husband--would vanish from her ken forever.\n\nHe meant to go abroad immediately--this very night, if possible.\nPrudence and caution could easily be thrown to the winds, once the\nnegotiable securities were actually in his hands. What he could convert\ninto money, he would do immediately, going to Amsterdam first, to\nwithdraw the sum standing at the bank there on deposit, and for which\nanon, he would possess the receipt; after that the sale of the grant of\nmonopolies should be easy of accomplishment. Sir Marmaduke had boundless\nfaith in his own ability to carry through his own business. He might\nstand to lose some of the money perhaps; prudence and caution might\nnecessitate the relinquishing of certain advantages, but even then he\nwould be rich and passing rich, and he knew that he ran but little risk\nof detection. The girl was young, inexperienced and singularly\nfriendless: Sir Marmaduke felt convinced that none of the foreign\ntransactions could ever be directly traced to himself.\n\nHe would be prudent and Europe was wide, and he meant to leave English\ngrants and securities severely alone.\n\nHe had mused and pondered on his plans all day. The evening found him\nhalf-exhausted with nerve-strain, febrile and almost sick with the agony\nof waiting.\n\nHe had calculated that Sue would be free towards seven o'clock, as he\nhad given Editha strict injunctions to keep discreetly out of the way,\nwhilst at a previous meeting in the park, it had been arranged that the\nyoung girl should come to the cottage with the money, on the evening of\nher twenty-first birthday and there hand her fortune over to her\nrightful lord.\n\nNow Sir Marmaduke cursed himself and his folly for having made this\narrangement. He had not known--when he made it--that Richard would be\nback at Acol then. Adam the smith, never came home before eight o'clock\nand the old Quakeress herself would not have been much in the way.\n\nEven now she had shuffled back into her kitchen, leaving her ill-humored\nlodger to puff away at the malodorous weed as he chose. But Richard\nmight return at any moment, and then ...\n\nSir Marmaduke had never thought of that possible contingency. If\nRichard Lambert came face to face with him, he would of a surety pierce\nthe disguise of the prince, and recognize the man who had so deeply\nwronged poor, unsuspecting Lady Sue. If only a kindly Fate had kept the\nyoung man away another twenty-four hours! or better still, if it led the\ndespairing lover's footsteps to the extremest edge of the cliffs!\n\nSir Marmaduke now paced the narrow room up and down in an agony of\nimpatience. Nine o'clock had struck long ago, but Sue had not yet come.\nThe wildest imaginings run riot in the schemer's brain: every hour, nay!\nevery minute spent within was fraught with danger. He sought his\nbroad-brimmed hat, determined now to meet Sue in the park, to sally\nforth at risk of missing her, at risk of her arriving here at the\ncottage when he was absent, and of her meeting Richard Lambert perhaps,\nbefore the irrevocable deed of gift had been accomplished.\n\nBut the suspense was intolerable.\n\nWith a violent oath Sir Marmaduke pressed the hat over his head, and\nstrode to the door.\n\nHis hand was on the latch, when he heard a faint sound from without: a\ngirl's footsteps, timorous yet swift, along the narrow flagged path\nwhich led down the tiny garden gate.\n\nThe next moment he had thrown open the door and Sue stood before him.\n\nAnyone but a bold and unscrupulous schemer would have been struck by the\npathos of the solitary figure which now appeared in the tiny doorway.\nThe penetrating November drizzle had soaked through the dark cloak and\nhood which now hung heavy and dank round the young girl's shoulders.\nFramed by the hood, her face appeared preternaturally pale, her lips\nwere quivering and her eyes, large and dilated, had almost a hunted look\nin them.\n\nOh! the pity and sadness of it all! For in her small and trembling hands\nshe was clutching with pathetic tenacity a small, brown wallet which\ncontained a fortune worthy of a princess.\n\nShe looked eagerly into her husband's face, dreading the scowl, the\noutburst of anger or jealousy mayhap with which of late, alas! he had so\noft greeted her arrival. But as was his wont, he stood with his back to\nthe lighted room, and she could not read the expression of that one\ncyclops-like eye, which to-night appeared more sinister than ever\nbeneath the thick perruque and broad-brimmed hat.\n\n\"I am sorry to be so late,\" she said timidly, \"the evening repast at the\nCourt was interminable and Mistress de Chavasse full of gossip.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, I know,\" he replied, \"am I not used to seeing that your\nsocial duties oft make you forget your husband?\"\n\n\"You are unjust, Am\u00c3\u00a9d\u00c3\u00a9,\" she rejoined.\n\nShe entered the little parlor and stood beside the table, making no\nmovement to divest herself of her dripping cloak, or to sit down, nor\nindeed did her husband show the slightest inclination to ask her to do\neither. He had closed the door behind her, and followed her to the\ncenter of the room. Was it by accident or design that as he reached the\ntable he threw his broad-brimmed hat, down with such an unnecessary\nflourish of the arm that he knocked over one of the heavy pewter\ncandlesticks, so that it rolled down upon the floor, causing the tallow\ncandle to sputter and die out with a weird and hissing sound?\n\nOnly one dim yellow light now illumined the room, it shone full into the\npallid face of the young wife standing some three paces from the table,\nwhilst Prince Am\u00c3\u00a9d\u00c3\u00a9 d'Orl\u00c3\u00a9ans' face between her and the light, was once\nmore in deep shadow.\n\n\"You are unjust,\" she repeated firmly. \"Have I not run the gravest\npossible risks for your sake, and those without murmur or complaint, for\nthe past six months? Did I not compromise my reputation for you by\nmeeting you alone ... of nights? ...\"\n\n\"I was laboring under the idea, my wench, that you were doing all that\nbecause you cared for me,\" he retorted with almost brutal curtness, \"and\nbecause you had the desire to become the Princess d'Orl\u00c3\u00a9ans; that desire\nis now gratified and ...\"\n\nHe had not really meant to be unkind. There was of a truth no object to\nbe gained by being brutal to her now. But that wallet, which she held so\ntightly clutched, acted as an irritant to his nerves. Never of very\nequable temperament and holding all women in lofty scorn, he chafed\nagainst all parleyings with his wife, now that the goal of his ambition\nwas so close at hand.\n\nShe winced at the insult, and the tears which she fain would have hidden\nfrom him, rose involuntarily to her eyes.\n\n\"Ah!\" she sighed, \"if you only knew how little I care for that title of\nprincess! ... Did you perchance think that I cared? ... Nay! how gladly\nwould I give up all thought of ever bearing that proud appellation, in\nexchange for a few more happy illusions such as I possessed three months\nago.\"\n\n\"Illusions are all very well for a school-girl, my dear Suzanne,\" he\nremarked with a cool shrug of his massive shoulders. \"Reality should be\nmore attractive to you now....\"\n\nHe looked her up and down, realizing perhaps for the first time that she\nwas exquisitely beautiful; beautiful always, but more so now in the\npathos of her helplessness. Somewhat perfunctorily, because in his\nignorance of women he thought that it would please her, and also because\nvaguely something human and elemental had suddenly roused his pulses, he\nrelinquished his nonchalant attitude, and came a step nearer to her.\n\n\"You are very beautiful, my Suzanne,\" he said half-ironically, and with\nmarked emphasis on the possessive.\n\nAgain he drew nearer, not choosing to note the instinctive stiffening of\nher figure, the shrinking look in her eyes. He caught her arm and drew\nher to him, laughing a low mocking laugh as he did so, for she had\nturned her face away from him.\n\n\"Come,\" he said lightly, \"will you not kiss me, my beautiful Suzanne?\n... my wife, my princess.\"\n\nShe was silent, impassive, indifferent so he thought, although the arm\nwhich he held trembled within his grip.\n\nHe stretched out his other hand, and taking her chin between his\nfingers, he forcibly turned her face towards him. Something in her face,\nin her attitude, now roused a certain rough passion in him. Mayhap the\nweary wailing during the day, the agonizing impatience, or the golden\nargosy so near to port, had strung up his nerves to fever pitch.\n\nIrritation against her impassiveness, in such glaring contrast to her\nglowing ardor of but a few weeks ago, mingled with that essentially male\ndesire to subdue and to conquer that which is inclined to resist, sent\nthe blood coursing wildly through his veins.\n\n\"Ah!\" he said with a sigh half of desire, half of satisfaction, as he\nlooked into her upturned face, \"the chaste blush of the bride is vastly\nbecoming to you, my Suzanne! ... it acts as fuel to the flames of my\nlove ... since I can well remember the passionate kisses you gave me so\nwillingly awhile ago.\"\n\nThe thought of that happy past, gave her sudden strength. Catching him\nunawares she wrenched herself free from his hold.\n\n\"This is a mockery, prince,\" she said with vehemence, and meeting his\nhalf-mocking glance with one of scorn. \"Do you think that I have been\nblind these last few weeks? ... Your love for me hath changed, if indeed\nit ever existed, whilst I ...\"\n\n\"Whilst you, my beautiful Suzanne,\" he rejoined lightly, \"are mine ...\nirrevocably, irretrievably mine ... mine because I love you, and because\nyou are my wife ... and owe me that obedience which you vowed to Heaven\nthat you would give me.... That is so, is it not?\"\n\nThere was a moment's silence in the tiny cottage parlor now, whilst\nhe--gauging the full value of his words, knowing by instinct that he had\nstruck the right cord in that vibrating girlish heart, watched the\nsubtle change in her face from defiance and wrath to submission and\nappeal.\n\n\"Yes, Am\u00c3\u00a9d\u00c3\u00a9,\" she murmured after a while, \"I owe you obedience, honor\nand love, and you need not fear that I will fail in either. But you,\"\nshe added with pathetic anxiety, \"you do care for me still? do you not?\"\n\n\"Of course I care for you,\" he remarked, \"I worship you.... There! ...\nwill that satisfy you? ... And now?\" he added peremptorily, \"have you\nbrought the money?\"\n\nThe short interlude of passion was over. His eye had accidentally rested\nfor one second on the leather wallet, which she still held tightly\nclutched, and all thoughts of her beauty, of his power or his desires,\nhad flown out to the winds.\n\n\"Yes,\" she replied meekly, \"it is all here, in the wallet.\"\n\nShe laid it down upon the table, feeling neither anxiety nor remorse. He\nwas her husband and had a right to her fortune, as he had to her person\nand to her thoughts and heart an he wished. Nor did she care about the\nmoney, as to the value of which she was, of course, ignorant.\n\nHer wealth, up to now, had only had a meaning for her, as part of some\nnoble scheme for the regeneration of mankind. Now she hoped vaguely, as\nshe put that wallet down on the table, then pushed it towards her\nhusband, that she was purchasing her freedom with her wealth.\n\nCertainly she realized that his thoughts had very quickly been diverted\nfrom her beauty to the contents of the wallet. The mocking laugh died\ndown on his lips, giving place to a sigh of deep satisfaction.\n\n\"You were very prudent, my dear Suzanne, to place this portion of your\nwealth in my charge,\" he said as he slipped the bulky papers into the\nlining of his doublet. \"Of course it is all yours, and I--your\nhusband--am but the repository and guardian of your fortune. And now\nmethinks 'twere prudent for you to return to the Court. Sir Marmaduke de\nChavasse will be missing you....\"\n\nIt did not seem to strike her as strange that he should dismiss her thus\nabruptly, and make no attempt to explain what his future plans might\nbe, nor indeed what his intentions were with regard to herself.\n\nThe intensity of her disappointment, the utter loneliness and\nhelplessness of her position had caused a veritable numbing of her\nfaculties and of her spirit and for the moment she was perhaps primarily\nconscious of a sense of relief at her dismissal.\n\nLike her wedding in the dismal little church, this day of her birthday,\nof her independence, of her handing over her fortune to her husband for\nthe glorious purposes of his selfless schemes had been so very, very\ndifferent to what she had pictured to herself in her girlish and\nromantic dreams.\n\nThe sordidness of it all had ruthlessly struck her; for the first time\nin her intercourse with this man, she doubted the genuineness of his\nmotives. With the passing of her fortune from her hands to his, the last\nvestige of belief in him died down with appalling suddenness.\n\nIt could not have been because of the expression in his eyes, as he\nfingered the wallet, for this she could not see, since his face was\nstill in shadow. It must have been just instinct--that, and the mockery\nof his attempt to make love to her. Had he ever loved her, he could not\nhave mocked ... not now, that she was helpless and entirely at his\nmercy.\n\nLove once felt, is sacred to him who feels: mockery even of the ashes of\nlove is an impossible desecration, one beyond the power of any man.\nThen, if he had never loved her, why had he pretended? Why have deceived\nher with a semblance of passion?\n\nAnd the icy whisper of reason blew into her mental ear, the ugly word:\n\"Money.\"\n\nHe opened the door for her, and without another word, she passed out\ninto the dark night. Only when she reached the tiny gate at the end of\nthe flagged path, did she realize that he was walking with her.\n\n\"I can find my way alone through the woods,\" she said coldly. \"I came\nalone.\"\n\n\"It was earlier then,\" he rejoined blandly, \"and I prefer to see you\nsafely as far as the park.\"\n\nAnd they walked on side by side in silence. Overhead the melancholy drip\nof moisture falling from leaf to leaf, and from leaf to the ground, was\nthe only sound that accompanied their footsteps. Sue shivered beneath\nher damp cloak; but she walked as far away from him as the width of the\nwoodland path allowed. He seemed absorbed in his own thoughts and not to\nnotice how she shrank from the slightest contact with him.\n\nAt the park gate he paused, having opened it for her to pass through.\n\n\"I must bid you good-night here, Suzanne,\" he said lightly, \"there may\nbe footpads about and I must place your securities away under lock and\nkey. I may be absent a few days for that purpose.... London, you know,\"\nhe added vaguely.\n\nThen as she made no comment:\n\n\"I will arrange for our next meeting,\" he said, \"anon, there will be no\nnecessity to keep our marriage a secret, but until I give you permission\nto speak of it, 'twere better that you remained silent on that score.\"\n\nShe contrived to murmur:\n\n\"As you will.\"\n\nAnd presently, as he made no movement towards her, she said:\n\n\"Good-night!\"\n\nThis time he had not even desired to kiss her.\n\nThe next moment she had disappeared in the gloom. She fled as fast as\nshe dared in the inky blackness of this November night. She could have\nrun for miles, or for hours, away! away from all this sordidness, this\navarice, this deceit and cruelty! Away! away from him!!\n\nHow glad she was that darkness enveloped her, for now she felt horribly\nashamed. Instinct, too, is cruel at times! Instinct had been silent so\nlong during the most critical juncture of her own folly. Now it spoke\nloudly, warningly; now that it was too late.\n\nAshamed of her own stupidity and blindness! her vanity mayhap had alone\nled her to believe the passionate protestations of a liar.\n\nA liar! a mean, cowardly schemer, but her husband for all that! She owed\nhim love, honor and obedience; if he commanded, she must obey; if he\ncalled she must fain go to him.\n\nOh! please God! that she had succeeded in purchasing her freedom from\nhim by placing \u00c2\u00a3500,000 in his hands.\n\nShame! shame that this should be! that she should have mistaken vile\nschemes for love, that a liar's kisses should have polluted her soul!\nthat she should be the wife, the bondswoman of a cheat!\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIX\n\nGOOD-BYE\n\n\n\"Sue!\"\n\nThe cry rang out in the night close to her, and arrested her fleeing\nfootsteps. She was close to the ha-ha, having run on blindly, madly,\nguided by that unaccountable instinct which makes for the shelter of\nhome.\n\nIn a moment she had recognized the voice. In a moment she was beside her\nfriend. Her passionate mood passed away, leaving her calm and almost at\npeace. Shame still caused her cheeks to burn, but the night was dark and\ndoubtless he would not see.\n\nBut she could feel that he was near her, therefore, there was no fear in\nher. What had guided her footsteps hither she did not know. Of course he\nhad guessed that she had been to meet her husband.\n\nThere were no exclamations or protestations between them. She merely\nsaid quite simply:\n\n\"I am glad that you came to say 'good-bye!'\"\n\nThe park was open here. The nearest trees were some fifty paces away,\nand in the ghostly darkness they could just perceive one another's\nsilhouettes. The mist enveloped them as with a shroud, the damp cold air\ncaused them to shiver as under the embrace of death.\n\n\"It is good-bye,\" he rejoined calmly.\n\n\"Mayhap that I shall go abroad soon,\" she said.\n\n\"With that man?\"\n\nThe cry broke out from the bitterness of his heart, but a cold little\nhand was placed restrainingly on his.\n\n\"When I go ... if I go,\" she murmured, \"I shall do so with my\nhusband.... You see, my friend, do you not, that there is naught else to\nsay but 'good-bye'?\"\n\n\"And you will be happy, Sue?\" he asked.\n\n\"I hope so!\" she sighed wistfully.\n\n\"You will always remember, will you not, my dear lady, that wherever you\nmay be, there is always someone in remote Thanet, who is ready at any\ntime to give his life for you?\"\n\n\"Yes! I will remember,\" she said simply.\n\n\"And you must promise me,\" he insisted, \"promise me now, Sue, that if\n... which Heaven forbid ... you are in any trouble or sorrow, and I can\ndo aught for you, that you will let me know and send for me ... and I\nwill come.\"\n\n\"Yes, Richard, I promise.... Good-bye.\"\n\nAnd she was gone. The mist, the gloom hid her completely from view. He\nwaited by the little bridge, for the night was still and he would have\nheard if she called.\n\nHe heard her light footsteps on the gravel, then on the flagged walk.\nAnon came the sound of the opening and shutting of a door. After that,\nsilence: the silence of a winter's night, when not a breath of wind\nstirs the dead branches of the trees, when woodland and field and park\nare wrapped in the shroud of the mist.\n\nRichard Lambert turned back towards the village.\n\nSue--married to another man--had passed out of his life forever.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXX\n\nALL BECAUSE OF THE TINDER-BOX\n\n\nHow oft it is in life that Fate, leading a traveler in easy gradients\nupwards along a road of triumph, suddenly assumes a madcap mood and with\nwanton hand throws a tiny obstacle in his way; an obstacle at times\ninfinitesimal, scarce visible on that way towards success, yet powerful\nenough to trip the unwary traveler and bring him down to earth with\nsudden and woeful vigor.\n\nWith Sir Marmaduke so far everything had prospered according to his\nwish. He had inveigled the heiress into a marriage which bound her to\nhis will, yet left him personally free; she had placed her fortune\nunreservedly and unconditionally in his hands, and had, so far as he\nknew, not even suspected the treachery practiced upon her by her\nguardian.\n\nNot a soul had pierced his disguise, and the identity of Prince Am\u00c3\u00a9d\u00c3\u00a9\nd'Orl\u00c3\u00a9ans was unknown even to his girl-wife.\n\nWith the disappearance of that mysterious personage, Sir Marmaduke\nhaving realized Lady Sue's fortune, could resume life as an independent\ngentleman, with this difference, that henceforth he would be passing\nrich, able to gratify his ambition, to cut a figure in the world as he\nchose.\n\nFortune which had been his idol all his life, now was indeed his slave.\nHe had it, he possessed it. It lay snug and safe in a leather wallet\ninside the lining of his doublet.\n\nSue had gone out of his sight, desirous apparently of turning her back\non him forever. He was free and rich. The game had been risky, daring\nbeyond belief, yet he had won in the end. He could afford to laugh now\nat all the dangers, the subterfuges, the machinations which had all gone\nto the making of that tragic comedy in which he had been the principal\nactor.\n\nThe last scene in the drama had been successfully enacted. The curtain\nhad been finally lowered; and Sir Marmaduke swore that there should be\nno epilogue to the play.\n\nThen it was that Fate--so well-named the wanton jade--shook herself from\nout the torpor in which she had wandered for so long beside this Kentish\nsquire. A spirit of mischief seized upon her and whispered that she had\nheld this man quite long enough by the hand and that it would be far\nmore amusing now to see him measure his length on the ground.\n\nAnd all that Fate did, in order to satisfy this spirit of mischief, was\nto cause Sir Marmaduke to forget his tinder-box in the front parlor of\nMistress Martha Lambert's cottage.\n\nA tinder-box is a small matter! an object of infinitesimal importance\nwhen the broad light of day illumines the interior of houses or the\nbosquets of a park, but it becomes an object of paramount importance,\nwhen the night is pitch dark, and when it is necessary to effect an\nexchange of clothing within the four walls of a pavilion.\n\nSir Marmaduke had walked to the park gates with his wife, not so much\nbecause he was anxious for her safety, but chiefly because he meant to\nretire within the pavilion, there to cast aside forever the costume and\nappurtenances of Prince Am\u00c3\u00a9d\u00c3\u00a9 d'Orl\u00c3\u00a9ans and to reassume the\nsable-colored doublet and breeches of the Roundhead squire, which\nproceeding he had for the past six months invariably accomplished in the\nlonely little building on the outskirts of his own park.\n\nAs soon, therefore, as he realized that Sue had gone, he turned his\nsteps towards the pavilion. The night seemed additionally dark here\nunder the elms, and Sir Marmaduke searched in his pocket for his\ntinder-box.\n\nIt was not there. He had left it at the cottage, and quickly recollected\nseeing it lying on the table at the very moment that Sue pushed the\nleather wallet towards him.\n\nHe had mounted the few stone steps which led up to the building, but\neven whilst he groped for the latch with an impatient hand, he realized\nhow impossible it would be for him anon, to change his clothes, in the\ndark; not only to undress and dress again, but to collect the belongings\nof the Prince d'Orl\u00c3\u00a9ans subsequently, for the purpose of destroying them\nat an early opportunity.\n\nGroping about in inky blackness might mean the forgetting of some\narticle of apparel, which, if found later on, might lead to suspicion or\neven detection of the fraud. Sir Marmaduke dared not risk it.\n\nLight he needed, and light he ought to have. The tinder-box had become\nof paramount importance, and it was sheer wantonness on the part of Fate\nthat she should have allowed that little article to rest forgotten on\nthe table in Mistress Lambert's cottage.\n\nSir Marmaduke remained pondering--in the darkness and the mist--for a\nwhile. His own doublet and breeches, shoes and stockings were in the\npavilion: would he ever be able to get at them without a light? No,\ncertainly not! nor could he venture to go home to the Court in his\npresent disguise, and leave his usual clothes in this remote building.\n\nPrying, suspicious eyes--such as those of Master Hymn-of-Praise Busy,\nfor instance, might prove exceedingly uncomfortable and even dangerous.\n\nOn the other hand, would it not be ten thousand times more dangerous to\ngo back to the cottage now and risk meeting Richard Lambert face to\nface?\n\nAnd it was Richard whom Sir Marmaduke feared.\n\nHe had, therefore, almost decided to try his luck at dressing in the\ndark, and was once more fumbling with the latch of the pavilion door,\nwhen through the absolute silence of the air, there came to his ear\nthrough the mist the sound of a young voice calling the name of \"Sue!\"\n\nThe voice was that of Richard Lambert.\n\nThe coast would be clear then. Richard had met Sue in the park: no\ndoubt he would hold her a few moments in conversation. The schemer cared\nnot what the two young people would or would not say to one another; all\nthat interested him now was the fact that Richard was not at the\ncottage, and that, therefore, it would be safe to run back and fetch the\ntinder-box.\n\nAll this was a part of Fate's mischievous prank. Sir Marmaduke was not\nafraid of meeting the old Quakeress, nor yet the surly smith; Richard\nbeing out of the way, he had no misgivings in his mind when he retraced\nhis steps towards the cottage.\n\nIt was close on eight o'clock then, in fact the tiny bell in Acol church\nstruck the hour even as Sir Marmaduke lifted the latch of the little\ngarden gate.\n\nThe old woman was in the parlor, busy as usual with her dusting-cloth.\nWithout heeding her, Sir Marmaduke strode up to the table and pushing\nthe crockery, which now littered it, aside, he searched for his\ntinder-box.\n\nIt was not there. With an impatient oath, he turned to Mistress Martha,\nand roughly demanded if she had seen it.\n\n\"Eh? ... What?\" she queried, shuffling a little nearer to him, \"I am\nsomewhat hard of hearing ... as thou knowest....\"\n\n\"Have you seen my tinder-box?\" he repeated with ever-growing irritation.\n\n\"Ah, yea, the fog!\" she said blandly, \"'tis damp too, of a truth, and\n...\"\n\n\"Hold your confounded tongue!\" he shouted wrathfully, \"and try and hear\nme. My tinder-box....\"\n\n\"Thy what? I am a bit ...\"\n\n\"Curse you for an old fool,\" swore Sir Marmaduke, who by now was in a\ntowering passion.\n\nWith a violent gesture he pushed the old woman aside and turning on her\nin an uncontrolled access of fury, with both arms upraised, he shouted:\n\n\"If you don't hear me now, I'll break every bone in your ugly body....\nWhere is my ...\"\n\nIt had all happened in a very few seconds: his entrance, his search for\nthe missing box, the growing irritation in him which had caused him to\nlose control of his temper. And now, even before the threatening words\nwere well out of his mouth, he suddenly felt a vigorous onslaught from\nthe rear, and his own throat clutched by strong and sinewy fingers.\n\n\"And I'll break every bone in thy accursed body!\" shouted a hoarse voice\nclose to his ear, \"if thou darest so much as lay a finger on the old\nwoman.\"\n\nThe struggle was violent and brief. Sir Marmaduke already felt himself\novermastered. Adam Lambert had taken him unawares. He was rough and very\npowerful. Sir Marmaduke was no weakling, yet encumbered by his fantastic\nclothes he was no match for the smith. Adam turned him about in his\nnervy hands like a puppet.\n\nNow he was in front and above him, glaring down at the man he hated with\neyes which would have searched the very depths of his enemy's soul.\n\n\"Thou damned foreigner!\" he growled between clenched teeth, \"thou\nvermin! ... Thou toad! Thou ... on thy knees! ... on thy knees, I say\n... beg her pardon for thy foul language ... now at once ... dost hear?\n... ere I squeeze the breath out of thee....\"\n\nSir Marmaduke felt his knees giving way under him, the smith's grasp on\nhis throat had in no way relaxed. Mistress Martha vainly tried to\ninterpose. She was all for peace, and knew that the Lord liked not a\nfiery temper. But the look in Adam's face frightened her, and she had\nalways been in terror of the foreigner. Without thought, and imagining\nthat 'twas her presence which irritated the lodger, she beat a hasty\nretreat to her room upstairs, even as Adam Lambert finally succeeded in\nforcing Sir Marmaduke down on his knees, not ceasing to repeat the\nwhile:\n\n\"Her pardon ... beg her pardon, my fine prince ... lick the dust in an\nEnglish cottage, thou foreign devil ... or, by God, I will kill thee!\n...\"\n\n\"Let me go!\" gasped Sir Marmaduke, whom the icy fear of imminent\ndiscovery gripped more effectually even than did the village\nblacksmith's muscular fingers, \"let me go ... damn you!\"\n\n\"Not before I have made thee lick the dust,\" said Adam grimly, bringing\none huge palm down on the elaborate perruque, and forcing Sir\nMarmaduke's head down, down towards the ground, \"lick it ... lick it\n... Prince of Orl\u00c3\u00a9ans....\"\n\nHe burst out laughing in the midst of his fury, at sight of this\ndisdainful gentleman, with the proud title, about to come in violent\ncontact with a cottage floor. But Sir Marmaduke struggled violently\nstill. He had been wiser no doubt, to take the humiliation quietly, to\nlick the dust and to pacify the smith: but what man is there who would\nsubmit to brute force without using his own to protect himself?\n\nThen Fate at last worked her wanton will.\n\nIn the struggle the fantastic perruque and heavy mustache of Prince\nAm\u00c3\u00a9d\u00c3\u00a9 d'Orl\u00c3\u00a9ans remained in the smith's hand whilst it was the round\nhead and clean-shaven face of Sir Marmaduke de Chavasse which came in\ncontact with the floor.\n\nIn an instant, stricken at first dumb with surprise and horror, but\nquickly recovering the power of speech, Adam Lambert murmured:\n\n\"You? ... You? ... Sir Marmaduke de Chavasse! ... Oh! my God! ...\"\n\nHis grip on his enemy had, of course, relaxed. Sir Marmaduke was able to\nstruggle to his feet. Fate had dealt him a blow as unexpected as it was\nviolent. But he had not been the daring schemer that he was, if\nthroughout the past six months, the possibility of such a moment as this\nhad not lurked at the back of his mind.\n\nThe blow, therefore, did not find him quite unprepared. It had been\nstunning but not absolutely crushing. Even whilst Adam Lambert was\nstaring with almost senseless amazement alternately at him and at the\nbundle of false hair which he was still clutching, Sir Marmaduke had\nstruggled to his feet.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXI\n\nTHE ASSIGNATION\n\n\nHe had recovered his outward composure at any rate, and the next moment\nwas busy re-adjusting his doublet and bands before the mirror over the\nhearth.\n\n\"Yes! my violent friend!\" he said coolly, speaking over his shoulder,\n\"of a truth it is mine own self! Your landlord you see, to whom that\nworthy woman upstairs owes this nice cottage which she has had rent free\nfor over ten years ... not the foreign vermin, you see,\" he added with a\npleasant laugh, \"which maketh your actions of just now, somewhat\nunpleasant to explain. Is that not so?\"\n\n\"Nay! but by the Lord!\" quoth Adam Lambert, still somewhat dazed,\nvaguely frightened himself now at the magnitude, the importance of what\nhe had done, \"meseems that 'tis thine actions, friend, which will be\nunpleasant to explain. Thou didst not put on these play-actor's robes\nfor a good purpose, I'll warrant! ... I cannot guess what is thy game,\nbut methinks her young ladyship would wish to know something of its\nrules ... or mayhap, my brother Richard who is no friend of thine,\nforsooth.\"\n\nGradually his voice had become steadier, his manner more assured. A\nglimmer of light on the Squire's strange doings had begun to penetrate\nhis simple, dull brain. Vaguely he guessed the purport of the disguise\nand of the lies, and the mention of Lady Sue's name was not an arrow\nshot thoughtlessly into the air. At the same time he had not perceived\nthe slightest quiver of fear or even of anxiety on Sir Marmaduke's face.\n\nThe latter had in the meanwhile put his crumpled toilet in order and now\nturned with an urbane smile to his glowering antagonist.\n\n\"I will not deny, kind master,\" he said pleasantly, \"that you might\ncause me a vast amount of unpleasantness just now ... although of a\ntruth, I do not perceive that you would benefit yourself overmuch\nthereby. On the contrary, you would vastly lose. Your worthy aunt,\nMistress Lambert, would lose a pleasant home, and you would never know\nwhat you and your brother Richard have vainly striven to find out these\npast ten years.\"\n\n\"What may that be, pray?\" queried the smith sullenly.\n\n\"Who you both are,\" rejoined Sir Marmaduke blandly, as he calmly sat\ndown in one of the stiff-backed elm chairs beside the hearth, \"and why\nworthy Mistress Lambert never speaks to you of your parentage.\"\n\n\"Who we both are?\" retorted Lambert with obvious bitterness, \"two poor\ncastaways, who, but for the old woman would have been left to starve,\nand who have tried, therefore, to be a bit grateful to her, and to earn\nan honest livelihood. That is what we are, Sir Marmaduke de Chavasse;\nand now prithee tell me, who the devil art thou?\"\n\n\"You are overfond of swearing, worthy master,\" quoth Sir Marmaduke\nlightly, \"'tis sinful so I'm told, for one of your creed. But that is no\nmatter to me. You are, believe me, somewhat more interesting than you\nimagine. Though I doubt if to a Quaker, being heir to title and vast\nestates hath more than a fleeting interest.\"\n\nBut the smith had shrugged his broad shoulders and uttered an\nexclamation of contempt.\n\n\"Title and vast estates?\" he said with an ironical laugh. \"Nay! Sir\nMarmaduke de Chavasse, the bait is passing clumsy. An you wish me to\nhold my tongue about you and your affairs, you'll have to be vastly\nsharper than that.\"\n\n\"You mistake me, friend smith, I am not endeavoring to purchase your\nsilence. I hold certain information relating to your parentage. This I\nwould be willing to impart to a friend, yet loath to do so to an enemy.\nA man doth not like to see his enemy in possession of fifteen thousand\npounds a year. Does he?\"\n\nAnd Sir Marmaduke appeared absorbed in the contemplation of his left\nshoe, whilst Adam Lambert repeated stupidly and vaguely:\n\n\"Fifteen thousand pounds a year? I?\"\n\n\"Even you, my friend.\"\n\nThis was said so simply, and with such conviction-carrying\ncertainty--that in spite of himself Lambert's sulkiness vanished. He\ndrew nearer to Sir Marmaduke, looked down on him silently for a second\nor two, then muttered through his teeth:\n\n\"You have the proofs?\"\n\n\"They will be at your service, my choleric friend,\" replied the other\nsuavely, \"in exchange for your silence.\"\n\nAdam Lambert drew a chair close to his whilom enemy, sat down opposite\nto him, with elbows resting on his knee, his clenched fists supporting\nhis chin, and his eyes--anxious, eager, glowing, fixed resolutely on de\nChavasse.\n\n\"I'll hold my tongue, never fear,\" he said curtly. \"Show me the proofs.\"\n\nSir Marmaduke gave a pleasant little laugh.\n\n\"Not so fast, my friend,\" he said, \"I do not carry such important papers\nabout in my breeches' pocket.\"\n\nAnd he rose from his chair, picked up the perruque and false mustache\nwhich the other man had dropped upon the floor, and adjusting these on\nhis head and face he once more presented the appearance of the exiled\nOrl\u00c3\u00a9ans prince.\n\n\"But thou'lt show them to me to-night,\" insisted the smith roughly.\n\n\"How can I, mine impatient friend?\" quoth de Chavasse lightly, \"the hour\nis late already.\"\n\n\"Nay! what matter the lateness of the hour? I am oft abroad at night,\nearly and late, and thou, methinks, hast oft had the midnight hour for\ncompany. When and where wilt meet me?\" added Lambert peremptorily, \"I\nmust see those proofs to-night, before many hours are over, lest the\nblood in my veins burn my body to ashes with impatience. When wilt meet\nme? Eleven? ... Midnight? ... or the small hours of the morn?\"\n\nHe spoke quickly, jerking out his words through closed teeth, his eyes\nburning with inward fever, his fists closing and unclosing with rapid\nfebrile movements of the fingers.\n\nThe pent-up disappointment and rebellion of a whole lifetime against\nFate, was expressed in the man's attitude, the agonizing eagerness which\nindeed seemed to be consuming him.\n\nDe Chavasse, on the other hand, had become singularly calm. The black\nshade as usual hid one of his eyes, masking and distorting the\nexpression of his face; the false mustache, too, concealed the movements\nof his lips, and the more his opponent's eyes tried to search the\nschemer's face, the more inscrutable and bland did the latter become.\n\n\"Nay, my friend,\" he said at last, \"I do not know that the thought of a\nmidnight excursion with you appeals to my sense of personal security. I\n...\"\n\nBut with a violent oath, Adam had jumped to his feet, and kicked the\nchair away from under him so that it fell backwards with a loud clatter.\n\n\"Thou'lt meet me to-night,\" he said loudly and threateningly now,\n\"thou'lt meet me on the path near the cliffs of Epple Bay half an hour\nbefore midnight, and if thou hast lied to me, I'll throw thee over and\nThanet then will be rid of thee ... but if thou dost not come, I'll to\nmy brother Richard even before the church clock of Acol hath sounded the\nhour of midnight.\"\n\nDe Chavasse watched him silently for the space of three seconds,\nrealizing, of course, that he was completely in that man's power, and\nalso that the smith meant every word that he said. The discovery of the\nmonstrous fraud by Richard Lambert within the next few hours was a\ncontingency which he could not even contemplate without shuddering. He\ncertainly would much prefer to give up to this uncouth laborer the\nproofs of his parentage which eventually might mean an earldom and a\nfortune to a village blacksmith.\n\nSir Marmaduke had reflected on all this, of course, before broaching the\nsubject to Adam Lambert at all. Now he was prepared to go through with\nthe scheme to the end if need be. His uncle, the Earl of Northallerton,\nmight live another twenty years, whilst he himself--if pursued for\nfraud, might have to spend those years in jail.\n\nOn the whole it was simpler to purchase the smith's silence ... this way\nor another. Sir Marmaduke's reflections at this moment would have\ndelighted those evil spirits who are supposed to revel in the misdoings\nof mankind.\n\nThe thought of the lonely path near the cliffs of Epple Bay tickled his\nfancy in a manner for which perhaps at this moment he himself could not\nhave accounted. He certainly did not fear Adam Lambert and now said\ndecisively:\n\n\"Very well, my friend, an you wish it, I'll come.\"\n\n\"Half an hour before midnight,\" insisted Lambert, \"on the cliffs at\nEpple Bay.\"\n\n\"Half an hour before midnight: on the cliffs of Epple Bay,\" assented the\nother.\n\nHe picked up his hat.\n\n\"Where art going?\" queried the smith suspiciously.\n\n\"To change my clothing,\" replied Sir Marmaduke, who was fingering that\nfateful tinder-box which alone had brought about the present crisis,\n\"and to fetch those proofs which you are so anxious to see.\"\n\n\"Thou'lt not fail me?\"\n\n\"Surely not,\" quoth de Chavasse, as he finally went out of the room.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXII\n\nTHE PATH NEAR THE CLIFFS\n\n\nThe mist had not lifted. Over the sea it hung heavy and dank like a huge\nsheet of gray thrown over things secret and unavowable. It was thickest\ndown in the bay lurking in the crevices of the chalk, in the great\ncaverns and mighty architecture carved by the patient toil of the\nbillows in the solid mass of the cliffs.\n\nUp above it was slightly less dense: allowing distinct peeps of the\nrough carpet of coarse grass, of the downtrodden path winding towards\nAcol, of the edge of the cliff, abrupt, precipitous, with a drop of some\nninety feet into that gray pall of mist to the sands below.\n\nAnd higher up still, above the mist itself, a deep blue sky dotted with\nstars, and a full moon, pale and circled with luminous vapors. A gentle\nbreeze had risen about half an hour ago and was blowing the mist hither\nand thither, striving to disperse it, but not yet succeeding in\nmastering it, for it only shifted restlessly to and fro, like the giant\ngarments of titanic ghosts, revealing now a distant peep of sea, anon\nthe interior of a colonnaded cavern, abode of mysterious ghouls, or\nagain a nest of gulls in a deep crevice of the chalk: revealing and\nhiding again:--a shroud dragged listlessly over monstrous dead things.\n\nSir Marmaduke de Chavasse had some difficulty in keeping to the footpath\nwhich leads from the woods of Acol straight toward the cliffs. Unlike\nAdam Lambert, his eyes were unaccustomed to pierce the moist pall which\nhid the distance from his view.\n\nStrangely enough he had not cast aside the fantastic accouterments of\nthe French prince, and though these must have been as singularly\nuncomfortable, as they were inappropriate, for a midnight walk,\nnevertheless, he still wore the heavy perruque, the dark mustache,\nbroad-brimmed hat, and black shade which were so characteristic of the\nmysterious personage.\n\nHe had heard the church clock at Acol village strike half an hour after\neleven and knew that the smith would already be waiting for him.\n\nThe acrid smell of seaweed struck forcibly now upon his nostrils. The\ngrass beneath his feet had become more sparse and more coarse. The\nmoisture which clung to his face had a taste of salt in it. Obviously he\nwas quite close to the edge of the cliffs.\n\nThe next moment and without any warning a black outline appeared in the\nmoon-illumined density. It was Adam Lambert pacing up and down with the\nimpatience of an imprisoned beast of prey.\n\nA second or two later the febrile hand of the smith had gripped Sir\nMarmaduke's shoulder.\n\n\"You have brought those proofs?\" he queried hoarsely.\n\nHis face was wet with the mist, and he had apparently oft wiped it with\nhis hand or sleeve, for great streaks of dirt marked his cheeks and\nforehead, giving him a curious satanic expression, whilst his short lank\nhair obviously roughed up by impatient fingers, bristled above his\nsquare-built head like the coat of a shaggy dog.\n\nIn absolute contrast to him, Sir Marmaduke looked wonderfully calm and\ntidy. In answer to the other man's eager look of inquiry, he made\npretense of fumbling in his pockets, as he said quietly:\n\n\"Yes! all of them!\"\n\nAs if idly musing, he continued to walk along the path, whilst the smith\nfirst stooped to pick up a small lantern which he had obviously brought\nwith him in order to examine the papers by its light, and then strode in\nthe wake of Sir Marmaduke.\n\nThe breeze was getting a bother hold on the mist, and was tossing it\nabout from sea to cliff and upwards with more persistence and more\nvigor.\n\nThe pale, cold moon glistened visibly on the moist atmosphere, and far\nbelow and far beyond weird streaks of shimmering silver edged the\nsurface of the sea. The breeze itself had scarcely stirred the water;\nor,--the soft sound of tiny billows lapping the outstanding boulders was\nwafted upwards as the tide drew in.\n\nThe two men had reached the edge of the cliff. With a slight laugh,\nindicative of nervousness, Sir Marmaduke had quickly stepped back a\npace or two.\n\n\"I have brought the proofs,\" he said, as if wishing to conciliate a\ndangerous enemy, \"we need not stand so near the edge, need we?\"\n\nBut Adam Lambert shrugged his shoulders in token of contempt at the\nother's cowardice.\n\n\"I'll not harm thee,\" he said, \"an thou hast not lied to me....\"\n\nHe deposited his lantern by the side of a heap of white chalk, which\nhad, no doubt, been collected at some time or other by idle or childish\nhands, and stood close to the edge of the cliff. Sir Marmaduke now took\nhis stand beside it, one foot placed higher than the other. Close to him\nAdam in a frenzy of restlessness had thrown himself down on the heap;\nbelow them a drop of ninety feet to the seaweed covered beach.\n\n\"Let me see the papers,\" quoth Adam impatiently.\n\n\"Gently, gently, kind sir,\" said de Chavasse lightly. \"Did you think\nthat you could dictate your own terms quite so easily?\"\n\n\"What dost thou mean?\" queried the other.\n\n\"I mean that I am about to place in your hands the proof that you are\nheir to a title and fifteen thousand pounds a year, but at the same time\nI wish to assure myself that you will be pleasant over certain matters\nwhich concern me.\"\n\n\"Have I not said that I would hold my tongue.\"\n\n\"Of a truth you did say so my friend, and therefore, I am convinced\nthat you will not refuse to give me a written promise to that effect.\"\n\n\"I cannot write,\" said Adam moodily.\n\n\"Oh! just your signature!\" said de Chavasse pleasantly. \"You can write\nyour name?\"\n\n\"Not well.\"\n\n\"The initials A. and L. They would satisfy me,\"\n\n\"Why dost thou want written promises,\" objected the smith, looking up\nwith sullen wrath at Sir Marmaduke. \"Is not the word of an honest man\nsufficient for thee?\"\n\n\"Quite sufficient,\" rejoined de Chavasse blandly, \"those initials are a\nmere matter of form. You cannot object if your intentions are honest.\"\n\n\"I do not object. Hast brought ink or paper?\"\n\n\"Yes, and the form to which you only need to affix your initials.\"\n\nSir Marmaduke now drew a packet of papers from the inner lining of his\ndoublet.\n\n\"These are the proofs of your parentage,\" he said lightly.\n\nThen he took out another single sheet of paper from his pocket, unfolded\nit and handed it to Lambert. \"Can you read it?\" he asked.\n\nHe stooped and picked up the lantern, whilst handing the paper to Adam.\nThe smith took the document from him, and Sir Marmaduke held the lantern\nso that he might read.\n\nAdam Lambert was no scholar. The reading of printed matter was oft a\ndifficulty to him, written characters were a vast deal more trouble,\nbut suspicion lurked in the smith's mind, and though his very sinews\nached with the desire to handle the proofs, he would not put his\ninitials to any writing which he did not fully comprehend.\n\nIt was all done in a moment. Adam was absorbed in deciphering the\ncontents of the paper. De Chavasse held the lantern up with one hand,\nbut at such an angle that Lambert was obliged to step back in order to\nget its full light.\n\nThen with the other hand, the right, Sir Marmaduke drew a double-edged\nItalian knife from his girdle, and with a rapid and vigorous gesture,\ndrove it straight between the smith's shoulder blades.\n\nAdam uttered a groan:\n\n\"My God ... I am ...\"\n\nThen he staggered and fell.\n\nFell backwards down the edge of the cliff into the mist-enveloped abyss\nbelow.\n\nSir Marmaduke had fallen on one knee and his trembling fingers clutched\nat the thick short grass, sharp as the blade of a knife, to stop himself\nfrom swooning--from falling backwards in the wake of Adam the smith.\n\nA gust of wind wafted the mist upwards, covering him with its humid\nembrace. But he remained quite still, crouching on his stomach now, his\nhands clutching the grass for support, whilst great drops of\nperspiration mingled with the moisture of the mist on his face.\n\nAnon he raised his head a little and turned to look at the edge of the\ncliff. On hands and knees, like a gigantic reptile, he crawled, then lay\nflat on the ground, on the extreme edge, his eyes peering down into\nthose depths wherein floating vapors lolled and stirred, with subtle\nmovements like spirits in unrest.\n\nAs far as the murderer's eye could reach and could penetrate the density\nof the fog, white crag succeeded white crag, with innumerable\nprojections which should have helped to toss a falling and inert mass as\neasily as if it had been an air bubble.\n\nSir Marmaduke tried to penetrate the secrets which the gray and shifting\nveil still hid from his view. Beside him lay the Italian knife, its\nsteely surface shimmering in the vaporous light, there where a dull and\nruddy stain had not dimmed its brilliant polish. The murderer gazed at\nhis tool and shuddered feebly. But he picked up the knife and\nmechanically wiped it in the grass, before he restored it to his belt.\n\nThen he gazed downwards again, straining his eyes to pierce the mist,\nhis ears to hear a sound.\n\nBut nothing came upwards from that mighty abyss save the now more\ndistinct lapping of the billows round the boulders, for the tide was\nrapidly setting in.\n\nDown the white sides of the cliff the projections seemed ready to afford\na foothold bearing somewhat toward the right, the descent was not so\nabrupt as it was immediately in front. The chalk of a truth looked slimy\nand green, and might cause the unwary to trip, but there was that to\nsee down below and that to do, which would make any danger of a fall\nwell worth the risking.\n\nSir Marmaduke de Chavasse slowly rose to his feet. His knees were still\nshaking under him, and there was a nervous tremor in his jaw and in his\nwrists which he tried vainly to conquer.\n\nNevertheless he managed to readjust his clothes, his perruque, his\nbroad-brimmed hat. The papers he slipped back into his pocket together\nwith the black silk shade and false mustache, then, with the lantern in\nhis left hand he took the first steps towards the perilous descent.\n\nThere was something down below that he must see, something that he\nwished to do.\n\nHe walked sidewise at times, bent nearly double, looking like some\ngigantic and unwieldy crab, as the feeble rays of the mist-hidden moon\ncaught his rounded back in its cloth doublet of a dull reddish hue. At\nother times he was forced to sit, and to work his way downwards with his\nhands and heels, tearing his clothes, bruising his elbows and his\nshoulders against the projections of the titanic masonry. Lumps of chalk\ndetached themselves from beneath and around him and slipped down the\nprecipitous sides in advance of him, with a dull reverberating sound\nwhich seemed to rouse the echoes of this silent night.\n\nThe descent seemed interminable. His flesh ached, his sinews creaked,\nhis senses reeled with the pain, the mind-agony, the horror of it all.\n\nAt last he caught a glimmer of the wet sand, less than ten feet below.\nHe had just landed on a bit of white tableland wantonly carved in the\nnaked cliff. The rough gradients which up to now had guided him in his\ndescent ceased abruptly. Behind him the cliff rose upwards, in front\nand, to his right, and left a concave wall, straight down to the beach.\n\nExhausted and half-paralyzed, de Chavasse perforce had to throw himself\ndown these last ten feet, hardly pausing to think whether his head would\nor would not come in violent contact with one of the chalk boulders\nwhich stand out here and there in the flat sandy beach.\n\nHe threw down the lantern first, which was extinguished as it fell. Then\nhe took the final jump, and soon lay half-unconscious, numbed and aching\nin every limb in the wet sand.\n\nAnon he tried to move. His limbs were painful, his shoulders ached, and\nhe had some difficulty in struggling to his feet. An unusually large\nboulder close by afforded a resting place. He reached it and sat down.\nHis head was still swimming but his limbs were apparently sound. He sat\nquietly for a while, recouping his strength, gathering his wandering\nsenses. The lantern lay close to his feet, extinguished but not broken.\n\nHe groped for his tinder-box, and having found it, proceeded to relight\nthe tiny tallow dip. It was a difficult proceeding for the tinder was\ndamp, and the breeze, though very slight in this hollow portion of the\ncliffs, nevertheless was an enemy to a trembling little flame.\n\nBut Sir Marmaduke noted with satisfaction that his nerves were already\nunder his control. He succeeded in relighting the lantern, which he\ncould not have done if his hands had been as unsteady as they were\nawhile ago.\n\nHe rose once more to his feet, stamped them against the boulders,\nstretched out his arms, giving his elbows and shoulders full play.\nMayhap he had spent a quarter of an hour thus resting since that final\njump, mayhap it had been an hour or two; he could not say for time had\nceased to be.\n\nBut the mist had penetrated to his very bones and he did not remember\never having felt quite so cold.\n\nNow he seized his lantern and began his search, trying to ascertain the\nexact position of the portion of the cliff's edge where he and Lambert\nthe smith had been standing a while ago.\n\nIt was not a difficult matter, nor was the search a long one. Soon he\nsaw a huddled mass lying in the sand.\n\nHe went up to it and placed the lantern down upon a boulder.\n\nHorror had entirely left him. The crisis of terror at his own fell deed\nhad been terrible but brief. His was not a nature to shrink from\nunpleasant sights, nor at such times do men have cause to recoil from\ncontact with the dead.\n\nIn the murderer's heart there was no real remorse for the crime which\nhe had committed.\n\n\"Bah! why did the fool get in my way?\" was the first mental comment\nwhich he made when he caught sight of Lambert's body.\n\nThen with a final shrug of the shoulders he dismissed pity, horror or\nremorse, entirely from his thoughts.\n\nWhat he now did was to raise the smith's body from the ground and to\nstrip it of its clothing. 'Twas a grim task, on which his chroniclers\nhave never cared to dwell. His purpose was fixed. He had planned and\nthought it all out minutely, and he was surely not the man to flinch at\nthe execution of a project once he had conceived it.\n\nThe death of Adam Lambert should serve a double purpose: the silencing\nof an avowed enemy and the wiping out of the personality of Prince Am\u00c3\u00a9d\u00c3\u00a9\nd'Orl\u00c3\u00a9ans.\n\nThe latter was as important as the first. It would facilitate the\nrealizing of the fortune and, above all, clear the way for Sir\nMarmaduke's future life.\n\nTherefore, however gruesome the task, which was necessary in order to\nattain that great goal, the schemer accomplished it, with set teeth and\nan unwavering hand.\n\nWhat he did do on that lonely fog-ridden beach and in the silence of\nthat dank and misty night, was to dress up the body of Adam Lambert, the\nsmith, in the fantastic clothing of Prince Am\u00c3\u00a9d\u00c3\u00a9 d'Orl\u00c3\u00a9ans: the red\ncloth doublet, the lace collars and cuffs, the bunches of ribbon at knee\nand waist, and the black silk shade over the left eye. All he omitted\nwere the perruque and the false mustache.\n\nHaving accomplished this work, he himself donned the clothes of Adam\nLambert.\n\nThis part of his task being done, he had to rest for a while. 'Tis no\neasy matter to undress and redress an inert mass.\n\nThe smith, dressed in the elaborate accouterments of the mysterious\nFrench prince, now lay face upwards on the sand.\n\nThe tide was rapidly setting in. In less than half an hour it would\nreach this portion of the beach.\n\nSir Marmaduke de Chavasse, however, had not yet accomplished all that he\nmeant to do. He knew that the sea-waves had a habit of returning that\nwhich they took away. Therefore, his purpose was not fully accomplished\nwhen he had dressed the dead smith in the clothes of the Orl\u00c3\u00a9ans prince.\nElse had he wished it, he could have consigned his victim to the tide.\n\nBut Adam--dead--had now to play a part in the grim comedy which Sir\nMarmaduke de Chavasse had designed for his own safety, and the more\nassured success of all his frauds and plans.\n\nTherefore, after a brief rest, the murderer set to work again. A more\ngrim task yet! one from which of a truth more than one evil-doer would\nrecoil.\n\nNot so this bold schemer, this mad worshiper of money and of self.\nEverything! anything for the safety of Sir Marmaduke de Chavasse, for\nthe peaceful possession of \u00c2\u00a3500,000.\n\nEverything! Even the desecration of the dead!\n\nThe murderer was powerful, and there is a strength which madness gives.\nHeavy boulders pushed by vigorous arms had to help in the monstrous\ndeed!\n\nHeavy boulders thrown and rolled over the face of the dead, so as to\nobliterate all identity!\n\nNay! had a sound now disturbed the silence of this awesome night, surely\nit had been the laughter of demons aghast at such a deed!\n\nThe moon indeed hid her face, retreating once more behind the veils of\nmist. The breeze itself was lulled and the fog gathered itself together\nand wrapped the unavowable horrors of the night in a gray and ghoul-like\nshroud.\n\nMadness lurked in the eyes of the sacrilegious murderer. Madness which\nhelped him not only to carry his grim task to the end, but, having\naccomplished it, to see that it was well done.\n\nAnd his hand did not tremble, as he raised the lantern and looked down\non _that_ which had once been Adam Lambert, the smith.\n\nNay, had those laughing demons looked on it, they would have veiled\ntheir faces in awe!\n\nThe gentle wavelets of the torpid tide were creeping round that thing in\nred doublet and breeches, in high top boots, lace cuffs and collar.\n\nSir Marmaduke looked down calmly upon his work, and did not even shudder\nwith horror.\n\nMadness had been upon him and had numbed his brain.\n\nBut the elemental instinct of self-preservation whispered to him that\nhis work was well done.\n\nWhen the sea gave up the dead, only the clothes, the doublet, the\nribands, the lace, the black shade, mayhap, would reveal his identity,\nas the mysterious French prince who for a brief while had lodged in a\ncottage at Acol.\n\nBut the face was unrecognizable.\n\n\n\n\nPART IV\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIII\n\nTHE DAY AFTER\n\n\nThe feeling which prevailed in Thanet with regard to the murder of the\nmysterious foreigner on the sands of Epple Bay was chiefly one of sullen\nresentment.\n\nHere was a man who had come from goodness knows where, whose strange\nwanderings and secret appearances in the neighborhood had oft roused the\nanger of the village folk, just as his fantastic clothes, his silken\ndoublet and befrilled shirt had excited their scorn; here was a man, I\nsay, who came from nowhere, and now he chose--the yokels of the\nneighborhood declared it that he chose--to make his exit from the world\nin as weird a manner as he had effected his entrance into this remote\nand law-abiding little island.\n\nThe farmhands and laborers who dwelt in the cottages dotted about around\nSt. Nicholas-at-Wade, Epple or Acol were really angry with the stranger\nfor allowing himself to be murdered on their shores. Thanet itself had\nup to now enjoyed a fair reputation for orderliness and temperance, and\nthat one of her inhabitants should have been tempted to do away with\nthat interloping foreigner in such a violent manner was obviously the\nfault of that foreigner himself.\n\nThe watches had found him on the sands at low tide. One of them walking\nalong the brow of the cliff had seen the dark object lying prone amongst\nthe boulders, a black mass in the midst of the whiteness of the chalk.\n\nThe whole thing was shocking, no doubt, gruesome in the extreme, but the\nmystery which surrounded this strange death had roused ire rather than\nhorror.\n\nOf course the news had traveled slowly from cottage to cottage, although\nPetty Constable Pyot, who resided at St. Nicholas, had immediately\napprised Squire Boatfield and Sir Marmaduke de Chavasse of the awesome\ndiscovery made by the watches on the sands of Epple Bay.\n\nSquire Boatfield was major-general of the district and rode over from\nSarre directly he heard the news. The body in the meanwhile had been\nplaced under the shelter of one of the titanic caves which giant hands\nhave carved in the acclivities of the chalk. Squire Boatfield ordered it\nto be removed. It was not fitting that birds of prey should be allowed\nto peck at the dead, nor that some unusually high tide should once more\ncarry him out to sea, ere his murderer had been brought to justice.\n\nTherefore, the foreigner with the high-sounding name was conveyed by the\nwatches at the squire's bidding to the cottage of the Lamberts over at\nAcol, the only place in Thanet which he had ever called his home.\n\nThe old Quakeress, wrathful and sullen, had scarce understood what the\nwhole pother was about. She was hard of hearing, and Petty Constable\nPyot was at great pains to explain to her that by the major-general's\norders the body of the murdered man should be laid decently under\nshelter, until such time as proper burial could be arranged for it.\n\nFortunately before the small cort\u00c3\u00a8ge bearing the gruesome burden had\narrived at the cottage, young Richard Lambert had succeeded in making\nthe old woman understand what was expected of her.\n\nEven then she flatly and obstinately refused to have the stranger\nbrought into her house.\n\n\"He was a heathen,\" she declared emphatically, \"his soul hath mayhap\ngone to hell. His thoughts were evil, and God had him not in His\nkeeping. 'Tis not fit that the mortal hulk of a damned soul should\npollute the saintliness of mine own abode.\"\n\nPyot thought that the old woman was raving, but Master Lambert very\nperemptorily forbade him to interfere with her. The young man, though\nquite calm, looked dangerous--so thought the petty constable--and\nbetween them, the old Quakeress and the young student defied the\nconstables and the watches and barred the cottage to the entrance of the\ndead.\n\nUnfortunately, the smith was from home. Pyot thought that the latter had\nbeen more reasonable, that he would have understood the weight of\nauthority, and also of seemliness, which was of equally grave\nimportance.\n\nThere was a good deal of parleying before it was finally decided to\nplace the body in the forge, which was a wooden lean-to, resting against\nthe north wall of the cottage. There was no direct access from the\ncottage to the forge, and old Mistress Lambert seemed satisfied that the\nforeigner should rest there, at any rate until the smith came home,\nwhen, mayhap, he would decide otherwise.\n\nAt the instance of the petty constable she even brought out a sheet,\nwhich smelt sweetly of lavender, and gave it to the watchmen, so that\nthey might decently cover up the dead; she also gave them three elm\nchairs on which to lay him down.\n\nAcross those three chairs the body now lay, covered over with the\nlavender-scented sheet, in the corner of the blacksmith's forge, over by\nthe furnace. A watchman stayed beside it, to ward off sacrilege: anyone\nwho desired could come, and could--if his nerves were strong\nenough--view the body and state if, indeed, it was that of the foreigner\nwho all through last summer had haunted the woods and park of Acol.\n\nOf a truth there was no doubt at all as to the identity of the dead. His\nfantastic clothes were unmistakable. Many there were who had seen him\nwandering in the woods of nights, and several could swear to the black\nsilk shade and the broad-brimmed hat which the watchmen had found--high\nand dry--on a chalk boulder close to where the body lay.\n\nMistress Lambert had refused to look on the dead. 'Twas, of course, no\nfit sight for females, and the constable had not insisted thereon: but\nshe knew the black silk shade again, and young Master Lambert had\ncaught sight of the murdered man's legs and feet, and had thereupon\nrecognized the breeches and the quaint boots with their overwide tops\nfilled with frills of lace.\n\nMaster Hymn-of-Praise Busy, too, though unwilling to see a corpse,\nthought it his duty to help the law in investigating this mysterious\ncrime. He had oft seen the foreigner of nights in the park, and never\ndoubted for a moment that the body which lay across the elm chairs in\nthe smith's forge was indeed that of the stranger.\n\nSquire Boatfield was now quite satisfied that the identity of the victim\nwas firmly established, and anon he did his best--being a humane man--to\nobtain Christian burial for the stranger. After some demur, the parson\nat Minster declared himself willing to do the pious deed.\n\nHeathen or not, 'twas not for Christian folk to pass judgment on him who\nno longer now could give an explanation of his own mysterious doings,\nand had of a truth carried his secrets with him in silence to the grave.\n\nWas it not strange that anyone should have risked the gallows for the\nsake of putting out of the way a man who of a surety was not worth\npowder or shot?\n\nAnd the nerve and strength which the murderer had shown! ... displacing\ngreat boulders with which to batter in his victim's face so that not\neven his own kith and kin could recognize that now!\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIV\n\nAFTERWARDS\n\n\nSir Marmaduke de Chavasse cursed the weather and cursed himself for\nbeing a fool.\n\nHe had started from Acol Court on horseback, riding an old nag, for the\nroads were heavy with mud, and the short cut through the woods quite\nimpassable.\n\nThe icy downpour beat against his face and lashed the poor mare's ears\nand mane until she tossed her head about blindly and impatiently, scarce\nheeding where she placed her feet. The rider's cloak was already soaked\nthrough, and soon even his shirt clung dank and cold to his aching back;\nthe bridle was slippery with the wet, and his numbed fingers could\nhardly feel its resistance as the mare went stumbling on her way.\n\nBeside horse and rider, Master Hymn-of-Praise Busy and Master Courage\nToogood walked ankle-deep in mud--one on each side of the mare, and\nlantern in hand, for the shades of evening would have drawn in ere the\nreturn journey could be undertaken. The two men had taken off their\nshoes and stockings and had slung them over their shoulders, for 'twas\nbetter to walk barefoot than to feel the icy moisture soaking through\nleather and worsted.\n\nIt was then close on two o'clock of an unusually bleak November\nafternoon. The winds of Heaven, which of a truth do oft use the isle of\nThanet as a meeting place, wherein to discuss the mischief which they\nseverally intend to accomplish in sundry quarters later on, had been\nexceptionally active this day. The southwesterly hurricane had brought,\na deluge of rain with it a couple of hours ago, then--satisfied with\nthis prowess--had handed the downpour over to his brother of the\nnortheast, who breathing on it with his icy breath, had soon converted\nit into sleet: whereupon he turned his back on the mainland altogether,\nand wandered out towards the ocean, determined to worry the deep-sea\nfishermen who were out with their nets: but not before he had deputed\nhis brother of the northeast to marshal his army of snow-laden cloud on\nthe firmament.\n\nThis the northeast, was over-ready to do, and in answer to his whim a\nleaden, inky pall now lay over Thanet, whilst the gale continued its\nmighty, wanton frolic, lashing the sleet against the tiny window-panes\nof the cottage, or sending it down the chimneys, upon the burning logs\nbelow, causing them to splutter and to hiss ere they changed their glow\nto black and smoking embers.\n\n'Twere impossible to imagine a more discomforting atmosphere in which to\nbe abroad: yet Sir Marmaduke de Chavasse was trudging through the mire,\nand getting wet to the skin, even when he might just as well be sitting\nbeside the fire in the withdrawing-room at the Court.\n\nHe was on his way to the smith's forge at Acol and had ordered his\nserving-men to accompany him thither: and of a truth neither of them\nwere loath to go. They cared naught about the weather, and the\nexcitement which centered round the Quakeress's cottage at Acol more\nthan counterbalanced the discomfort of a tramp through the mud.\n\nA rumor had reached the Court that the funeral of the murdered man\nwould, mayhap, take place this day, and Master Busy would not have\nmissed such an event for the world, not though the roads lay thick with\nsnow and the drifts rendered progress impossible to all save to the\nkeenest enthusiast. He for one was glad enough that his master had\nseemed so unaccountably anxious for the company of his own serving men.\nSir Marmaduke had ever been overfond of wandering about the lonely woods\nof Thanet alone.\n\nBut since that gruesome murder on the beach forty-eight hours ago and\nmore, both the quality and the yokels preferred to venture abroad in\ncompany.\n\nAt the same time neither Master Busy nor young Courage Toogood could\nimagine why Sir Marmaduke de Chavasse should endure such amazing\ndiscomfort in order to attend the funeral of an obscure adventurer, who\nof a truth was as naught to him.\n\nNor, if the truth were known, could Sir Marmaduke himself have accounted\nfor his presence here on this lonely road, and on one of the most\ndismal, bleak and unpleasant afternoons that had ever been experienced\nin Thanet of late.\n\nHe should at this moment have been on the other side of the North Sea.\nThe most elemental prudence should indeed have counseled an immediate\njourney to Amsterdam and a prompt negotiation of all marketable\nsecurities which Lady Sue Aldmarshe had placed in his hands.\n\nYet twice twenty-four hours had gone by since that awful night, when,\nhaving finally relinquished his victim to the embrace of the tide, he\nhad picked his way up the chalk cliffs and through the terror-haunted\nwoods to his own room in Acol Court.\n\nHe should have left for abroad the next day, ere the news of the\ndiscovery of a mysterious murder had reached the precincts of his own\npark. But he had remained in England. Something seemed to have rooted\nhim to the spot, something to be holding him back whenever he was ready\nto flee.\n\nAt first it had been a mere desire to know. On the morning following his\ncrime he made a vigorous effort to rally his scattered senses, to walk,\nto move, and to breathe as if nothing had happened, as if nothing lay\nout there on the sands of Epple, high and dry now, for the tide would\nhave gone out.\n\nWhether he had slept or not since the moment when he had crept\nstealthily into his own house, silently as the bird of prey when\nreturning to its nest--he could not have said. Undoubtedly he had\nstripped off the dead man's clothes, the rough shirt and cord breeches\nwhich had belonged to Lambert, the smith. Undoubtedly, too, he had made\na bundle of these things, hiding them in a dark recess at the bottom of\nan old oak cupboard which stood in his room. With these clothes he had\nplaced the leather wallet which contained securities worth half a\nmillion of solid money.\n\nAll this he had done, preparatory to destroying the clothes by fire, and\nto converting the securities into money abroad. After that he had thrown\nhimself on the bed, without thought, without sensations save those of\nbodily ache and of numbing fatigue.\n\nVaguely, as the morning roused him to consciousness, he realized that he\nmust leave for Dover as soon as may be and cross over to France by the\nfirst packet available, or, better still, by boat specially chartered.\nAnd yet, when anon he rose and dressed, he felt at once that he would\nnot go just yet; that he could not go until certain queries which had\nformed in his brain had been answered by events.\n\nHow soon would the watches find the body? Having found it, what would\nthey do? Would the body be immediately identified by the clothes upon\nit? or would doubt on that score arise in the minds of the neighboring\nfolk? Would the disappearance of Adam Lambert be known at once and\ncommented upon in connection with the crime?\n\nCuriosity soon became an obsession; he wandered down into the hall where\nthe serving-wench was plying her duster. He searched her face,\nwondering if she had heard the news.\n\nThe mist of the night had yielded to an icy drizzle, but Sir Marmaduke\ncould not remain within. His footsteps guided him in the direction of\nAcol, on towards Epple Bay. On the path which leads to the edge of the\ncliffs he met the watches who were tramping on towards the beach.\n\nThe men saluted him and went on their way, but he turned and fled as\nquickly as he dared.\n\nIn the afternoon Master Busy brought the news down from Prospect Inn.\nThe body of the man who had called himself a French prince had been\nfound murdered and shockingly mutilated on the sands at Epple. Sir\nMarmaduke was vastly interested. He, usually so reserved and ill-humored\nwith his servants, had kept Hymn-of-Praise in close converse for nigh\nupon an hour, asking many questions about the crime, about the petty\nconstables' action in the matter and the comments made by the village\nfolk.\n\nAt the same time he gave strict injunctions to Master Busy not to\nbreathe a word of the gruesome subject to the ladies, nor yet to the\nserving-wench; 'twas not a matter fit for women's ears.\n\nSir Marmaduke then bade his butler push on as far as Acol, to glean\nfurther information about the mysterious event.\n\nThat evening he collected all the clothes which had belonged to Lambert,\nthe smith, and wrapping up the leather wallet with them which contained\nthe securities, he carried this bundle to the lonely pavilion on the\noutskirts of the park.\n\nHe was not yet ready to go abroad.\n\nMaster Busy returned from his visit to Acol full of what he had seen. He\nhad been allowed to view the body, and to swear before Squire Boatfield\nthat he recognized the clothes as being those usually worn by the\nmysterious foreigner who used to haunt the woods and park of Acol all\nlast summer.\n\nHymn-of-Praise had his full meed of pleasure that evening, and the next\nday, too, for Sir Marmaduke seemed never tired of hearing him recount\nall the gossip which obtained at Acol and at St. Nicholas: the surmises\nas to the motive of the horrible crime, the talk about the stranger and\nhis doings, the resentment caused by his weird demise, and the\nconjectures as to what could have led a miscreant to do away with so\ninsignificant a personage.\n\nAll that day--the second since the crime--Sir Marmaduke still lingered\nin Thanet. Prudence whispered urgent counsels that he should go, and yet\nhe stayed, watching the progress of events with that same morbid and\ntenacious curiosity.\n\nAnd now it was the thought of what folk would say when they heard that\nAdam Lambert had disappeared, and was, of a truth, not returning home,\nwhich kept Sir Marmaduke still lingering in England.\n\nThat and the inexplicable enigma which ever confronts the searcher of\nhuman motives: the overwhelming desire of the murderer to look once\nagain upon his victim.\n\nMaster Busy had on that second morning brought home the news from Acol,\nthat Squire Boatfield had caused a rough deal coffin to be made by the\nvillage carpenter at the expense of the county, and that mayhap the\nstranger would be laid therein this very afternoon and conveyed down to\nMinster, where he would be accorded Christian burial.\n\nThen Sir Marmaduke realized that it would be impossible for him to leave\nEngland until after he had gazed once more on the dead body of the\nsmith.\n\nAfter that he would go. He would shake the sand of Thanet from his heels\nforever.\n\nWhen he had learned all that he wished to know he would be free from the\npresent feeling of terrible obsession which paralyzed his movements to\nthe extent of endangering his own safely.\n\nHe was bound to look upon his victim once again: an inexplicable and\ntitanic force compelled him to that. Mayhap, that same force would\nenable him to keep his nerves under control when, presently, he should\nbe face to face with the dead.\n\nFace to face? ... Good God! ...\n\nYet neither fear nor remorse haunted him. It was only curosity, and, at\none thought, a nameless horror! ... Not at the thought of murder ...\nthere he had no compunction, but at that of the terrible deed which from\ninstinct of self-protection had perforce to succeed the graver crime.\n\nThe weight of those chalk boulders seemed still to weigh against the\nmuscles of his back. He felt that Sisyphus-like he was forever rolling,\nrolling a gigantic stone which, failing of its purpose--recoiled on him,\nrolling back down a precipitous incline, and crushing him beneath its\nweight ... only to release him again ... to leave him free to endure the\nsame torture over and over again ... and yet again ... forever the same\nweight ... forever the self-same, intolerable agony....\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXV\n\nTHE SMITH'S FORGE\n\n\nUp to the hour of his departure from Acol Court, Sir Marmaduke had been\nconvinced that neither his sister-in-law nor Lady Sue had heard of the\nnews which had set the whole of Thanet in commotion. Acol Court lies\nvery isolated, well off the main Canterbury Road, and just for two days\nand a half Master Hymn-of-Praise Busy had contrived to hold his tongue.\n\nMost of the village gossips, too, met at the local public bars, and had\nhad up to now no time to wander as far as the Court, nor any reason to\ndo so, seeing that Master Busy was always to be found at Prospect Inn\nand always ready to discuss the mystery in all its bearings, with anyone\nwho would share a pint of ale with him.\n\nSir Marmaduke had taken jealous care only to meet the ladies at\nmeal-time, and under penalty of immediate dismissal had forbidden\nHymn-of-Praise to speak to the serving-wench of the all-absorbing topic.\n\nSo far Master Busy had obeyed, but at the last moment, just before\nstarting for Acol village, Sir Marmaduke had caught sight of Mistress\nCharity talking to the stableman in the yard. Something in the wench's\neyes told him--with absolute certainty that she had just heard of the\nmurder.\n\nThat morbid and tenacious curiosity once more got hold of him. He would\nhave given all he possessed at this moment--the entire fruits of his\ncrime perhaps--to know what that ignorant girl thought of it all, and it\ncaused him acute, almost physical pain, to refrain from questioning her.\n\nThere was enough of the sense of self-protection in him, however, to\ncheck himself from betraying such extraordinary interest in the matter:\nbut he turned on his heel and went quickly back to the house. He wanted\nto catch sight of Editha's face, if only for a moment; he wanted to see\nfor himself, then and there, if she had also heard the news.\n\nAs he entered the hall, she was coming down the stairs. She had on her\ncloak and hood as if preparing to go out. Their eyes met and he saw that\nshe knew.\n\nKnew what? He broke into a loud and fierce laugh as he met her wildly\nquestioning gaze. There was a look almost of madness in the hopeless\npuzzlement of her expression.\n\nOf course Editha must be hopelessly puzzled. The very thought of her\nvague conjecturings had caused him to laugh as maniacs laugh at times.\n\nThe mysterious French prince had been found on the sands murdered and\nmutilated.... But then ...\n\nStill laughing, Sir Marmaduke once more turned, running away from the\nhouse now and never pausing until his foot had touched the stirrup and\nhis fingers were entangled in the damp mane of the mare. Even whilst he\nsettled himself into the saddle as comfortably as he could, the grim\nhumor of Editha's bewilderment caused him to laugh, within himself.\n\nThe nag stepped slowly along in the mud at first, then broke into a\nshort trot. The two serving-men had started on ahead with their\nlanterns; they would, of course, be walking all the way.\n\nThe icy rain mingled with tiny flakes of snow was insufferably cutting\nand paralyzing: yet Sir Marmaduke scarcely heeded it, until the mare\nbecame unpleasantly uncertain in her gait. Once she stumbled and nearly\npitched her rider forward into the mud: whereupon, lashing into her, he\npaid more heed to her doings.\n\nOnce just past the crossroad toward St. Nicholas, he all but turned his\nhorse's head back towards Acol Court. It seemed as if he must find out\nnow at once whether Editha had spoken to Lady Sue and what the young\ngirl had done and said when she heard, in effect, that her husband had\nbeen murdered.\n\nNothing but the fear of missing the last look at the body of Adam\nLambert ere the lid of the coffin was nailed down stopped him from\nreturning homewards.\n\nAnon he came upon Busy and Toogood painfully trudging in the mire, and\nsinging lustily to keep themselves cheerful and warm.\n\nSir Marmaduke drew the mare in, so as to keep pace with his men. On the\nwhole, the road had been more lonely than he liked and he was glad of\ncompany.\n\nOutside the Lamberts' cottage a small crowd had collected. From the\ncrest of the hill the tiny bell of Acol church struck the hour of two.\n\nSquire Boatfield had ridden over from Sarre, and Sir Marmaduke--as he\ndismounted--caught sight of the heels and crupper of the squire's\nwell-known cob. The little crowd had gathered in the immediate\nneighborhood of the forge, and de Chavasse, from where he now stood,\ncould not see the entrance of the lean-to, only the blank side wall of\nthe shed, and the front of the Lamberts' cottage, the doors and windows\nof which were hermetically closed.\n\nUp against the angle formed by the wall of the forge and that of the\ncottage, the enterprising landlord of the local inn had erected a small\ntrestle table, from behind which he was dispensing spiced ale, and\nbottled Spanish wines.\n\nSquire Boatfield was standing beside that improvised bar, and at sight\nof Sir Marmaduke he put down the pewter mug which he was in the act of\nconveying to his lips, and came forward to greet his friend.\n\n\"What is the pother about this foreigner, eh, Boatfield?\" queried de\nChavasse with gruff good-nature as he shook hands with the squire and\nallowed himself to be led towards that tempting array of bottles and\nmugs on the trestle table.\n\nThe yokels who were assembled at the entrance of the forge turned to\ngaze with some curiosity at the squire of Acol. De Chavasse was not\noften seen even in this village: he seldom went beyond the boundary of\nhis own park.\n\nAll the men touched their forelocks with deferential respect. Master\nJeremy Mounce humbly whispered a query as to what His Honor would\ncondescend to take.\n\nSir Marmaduke desired a mug of buttered ale or of lamb's wool, which\nMaster Mounce soon held ready for him. He emptied the mug at one\ndraught. The spiced liquor went coursing through his body, and he felt\nbetter and more sure of himself. He desired a second mug.\n\n\"With more substance in it, Master Landlord,\" he said pleasantly. \"Nay,\nman! ye are not giving milk to children, but something warm to cheer a\nman's inside.\"\n\n\"I have a half bottle of brandy here, good Sir Marmaduke,\" suggested\nMaster Mounce with some diffidence, for brandy was an over-expensive\ncommodity which not many Kentish squires cared to afford.\n\n\"Brandy, of course, good master!\" quoth de Chavasse lustily, \"brandy is\nthe nectar of the gods. Here!\" he added, drawing a piece of gold from a\ntiny pocket concealed in the lining of his doublet, \"will this pay for\nthy half-bottle of nectar.\"\n\n\"Over well, good Sir Marmaduke,\" said Master Mounce, as he stooped to\nthe ground. From underneath the table he now drew forth a glass and a\nbottle: the latter he uncorked with slow and deliberate care, and then\nfilled the glass with its contents, whilst Sir Marmaduke watched him\nwith impatient eyes.\n\n\"Will you join me, squire?\" asked de Chavasse, as he lifted the small\ntumbler and gazed with marked appreciation at the glistening and\ntransparent liquid.\n\n\"Nay, thanks,\" replied Boatfield with a laugh, \"I care naught for these\nforeign decoctions. Another mug, or even two, of buttered ale, good\nlandlord,\" he added, turning to Master Mounce.\n\nIn the meanwhile petty constable Pyot had stood respectfully at\nattention ready to relate for the hundredth time, mayhap, all that he\nknew and all that he meant to know about the mysterious crime.\n\nSir Marmaduke would of a surety ask many questions, for it was passing\nstrange that he had taken but little outward interest in the matter up\nto now.\n\n\"Well, Pyot,\" he now said, beckoning to the man to approach, \"tell us\nwhat you know. By Gad, 'tis not often we indulge in a genuine murder in\nThanet! Where was it done? Not on my land, I hope.\"\n\n\"The watches found the body on the beach, your Honor,\" replied Pyot,\n\"the head was mutilated past all recognition ... the heavy chalk\nboulders, your Honor ... and a determined maniac methinks, sir, who\nwanted revenge against a personal enemy.... Else how to account for such\na brutal act? ...\"\n\n\"I suppose,\" quoth Sir Marmaduke lightly, as he sipped the brandy,\n\"that the identity of the man has been quite absolutely determined.\"\n\n\"Aye! aye! your Honor,\" rejoined Pyot gravely, \"the opinion of all those\nwho have seen the body is that it is that of a foreigner ... Prince of\nOrleans he called himself, who has been lodging these past months at\nthis place here!\"\n\nAnd the petty constable gave a quick nod in the direction of the\ncottage.\n\n\"Ah! I know but little about him,\" now said Sir Marmaduke, turning to\nspeak to Squire Boatfield, \"although he lived here, on what is my own\nproperty, and haunted my park, too ... so I've been told. There was a\ngood deal of talk about him among the wenches in the village.\"\n\n\"Aye! I had heard all about that prince,\" said Squire Boatfield\nmeditatively, \"lodging in this cottage ... 'twas passing strange.\"\n\n\"He was a curious sort of man, your Honor,\" here interposed Pyot. \"We\ngot what information about him we could, seeing that the smith is from\nhome, and that Mistress Lambert, his aunt, I think, is hard of hearing,\nand gave us many crooked answers. But she told us that the stranger paid\nfor his lodging regularly, and would arrive at the cottage unawares of\nan evening and stay part of the night ... then he would go off again at\ncock-crow, and depart she knew not whither.\"\n\nThe man paused in his narrative. Something apparently had caused Sir\nMarmaduke to turn giddy.\n\nHe tugged at his neckbands and his hand fell heavily against the\ntrestle-table.\n\n\"Nay! 'tis nothing,\" he said with a harsh laugh as Master Mounce with an\nejaculation of deep concern ran round to him with a chair, whilst Squire\nBoatfield quickly put out an arm as if he were afraid that his friend\nwould fall. \"'Tis nothing,\" he repeated, \"the tramp in the cold, then\nthis heady draught.... I am well I assure you.\"\n\nHe drank half a glass of brandy at a draught, and now the hand which\nreplaced the glass upon the table had not the slightest tremor in it.\n\n\"'Tis all vastly interesting,\" he remarked lightly. \"Have you seen the\nbody, Boatfield?\"\n\n\"Aye! aye!\" quoth the squire, speaking with obvious reluctance, for he\nhated this gruesome subject. \"'Tis no pleasant sight. And were I in your\nshoes, de Chavasse, I would not go in there,\" and he nodded\nsignificantly towards the forge.\n\n\"Nay! 'tis my duty as a magistrate,\" said Sir Marmaduke airily.\n\nHe had to steady himself against the table again for a moment or two,\nere he turned his back on the hospitable board, and started to walk\nround towards the forge: no doubt the shaking of his knees was\nattributable to the strong liquor which he had consumed.\n\nThe little crowd parted and dispersed at his approach. The lean-to\nwherein Adam Lambert was wont to do his work consisted of four walls,\none of which was that of the cottage, whilst the other immediately\nfacing it, had a wide opening which formed the only entrance to the\nshed. A man standing in that entrance would have the furnace on his\nleft: and now in addition to that furnace also the three elm chairs,\nwhereon rested a rough deal case, without a lid, but partly covered with\na sheet.\n\nTo anyone coming from the outside, this angle of the forge would always\nseem weird and even mysterious even when the furnace was blazing and the\nsparks flying from the anvil, beneath the smith's powerful blows, or\nwhen--as at present--the fires were extinguished and this part of the\nshed, innocent of windows, was in absolute darkness.\n\nSir Marmaduke paused a moment under the lintel which dominated the broad\nentrance. His eyes had some difficulty in penetrating the density which\nseemed drawn across the place on his left like some ink-smeared and\nopaque curtain.\n\nThe men assembled outside, watched him from a distance with silent\nrespect. In these days the fact of a gentleman drinking more liquor than\nwas good for him was certes not to his discredit.\n\nThe fact that Sir Marmaduke seemed to sway visibly on his legs, as he\nthus stood for a moment outlined against the dark interior beyond,\nroused no astonishment in the minds of those who saw him.\n\nPresently he turned deliberately to his left and the next moment his\nfigure was merged in the gloom.\n\nRound the angle of the wall Squire Boatfield was still standing, sipping\nbuttered ale.\n\nLess than two minutes later, Sir Marmaduke reappeared in the doorway.\nHis face was a curious color, and there were beads of perspiration on\nhis forehead, and as he came forward he would have fallen, had not one\nof the men stepped quickly up to him and offered a steadying arm. But\nthere was nothing strange in that.\n\nThe sight of that which lay in Adam Lambert's forge had unmanned a good\nmany ere this.\n\n\"I am inclined to believe, my good Boatfield,\" quoth Sir Marmaduke, as\nhe went back to the trestle-table, and poured himself out another\nhalf-glass full of brandy, \"I am inclined to believe that when you\nadvised me not to go in there, you spoke words of wisdom which I had\ndone well to follow.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVI\n\nTHE GIRL-WIFE\n\n\nBut the effort of the past few moments had been almost more than\nMarmaduke de Chavasse could bear.\n\nAnon when the church bell over at Acol began a slow and monotonous toll\nhe felt as if his every nerve must give way: as if he must laugh, laugh\nloudly and long at the idiocy, the ignorance of all these people who\nthought that they were confronted by an impenetrable mystery, whereas it\nwas all so simple ... so very, very simple.\n\nHe had a curious feeling as if he must grip every one of these men here\nby the throat and demand from each one separately an account of what he\nthought and felt, what he surmised and what he guessed when standing\nface to face with the weird enigma presented by that mutilated thing in\nits rough deal case. He would have given worlds to know what his friend\nBoatfield thought of it all, or what had been the petty constable's\nconjectures.\n\nA haunting and devilish desire seized him to break open the skulls of\nall these yokels and to look into their brains. Above all now the\nsilence of the cottage close to him had become unendurable torment. That\nclosed door, the tiny railing which surrounded the bit of front garden,\nthat little gate the latch of which he himself so oft had lifted, all\nseemed to hold the key to some terrible mystery, the answer to some\nfearful riddle which he felt would drive him mad if he could not hit\nupon it now at once.\n\nThe brandy had fired his veins: he no longer felt numb with the cold. A\npassion of rage was seething in him, and he longed to attack with fists\nand heels those curtained windows which now looked like eyes turned\nmutely and inquiringly upon him.\n\nBut there was enough sanity in him yet to prevent his doing anything\nrash: an uncontrolled act might cause astonishment, suspicion mayhap, in\nthe minds of those who witnessed it. He made a violent effort to steady\nhimself even now, above all to steady his voice and to veil that excited\nglitter which he knew must be apparent in his eyes.\n\n\"Meseems that 'tis somewhat strange,\" he said quite calmly, even\nlightly, to Squire Boatfield who seemed to be preparing to go, \"that\nthese people--the Lamberts--who alone knew the ... the murdered man\nintimately, should keep so persistently, so determinedly out of the\nway.\"\n\nEven while the words escaped his mouth--certes involuntarily--he knew\nthat the most elementary prudence should have dictated silence on this\nscore, and at this juncture. The man was about to be buried, the\ndisappearance of the smith had passed off so far without comment. Peace,\nthe eternal peace of the grave, would soon descend on the weird events\nwhich occupied everyone's mind for the present.\n\nWhat the old Quakeress thought and felt, what Richard--the\nbrother--feared and conjectured was easy for Sir Marmaduke to guess: for\nhim, but for no one else. To these others the silence of the cottage,\nthe absence of the Lamberts from this gathering was simple enough of\nexplanation, seeing that they themselves felt such bitter resentment\nagainst the dead man. They quite felt with the old woman's sullenness,\nher hatred of the foreigner who had disturbed the serenity of her life.\n\nEveryone else was willing to let her be, not to drag her and young\nLambert into the unpleasant vortex of these proceedings. Their home was\nan abode of mourning: it was proper and seemly for them to remain\nconcealed and silent within their cottage; seemly, too, to have\ncurtained their windows and closed their doors.\n\nNo one wished to disturb them; no one but Sir Marmaduke, and with him it\nwas once again that morbid access of curiosity, the passionate, intense\ndesire to know and to probe every tiny detail in connection with his own\ncrime.\n\n\"The old woman Lambert should be made to identify the body, before it is\nburied,\" he now repeated with angry emphasis, seeing that a look of\ndisapproval had crossed Squire Boatfield's pleasant face.\n\n\"We are satisfied as to the man's identity,\" rejoined the squire\nimpatiently, \"and the sight is not fit for women's eyes.\"\n\n\"Nay, then she should be shown the clothes and effects.... And, if I\nmistake not, there's Richard Lambert, my late secretary, has he laid\nsworn information about the man?\"\n\n\"Yes, I believe so,\" said Boatfield with some hesitation.\n\n\"Nay, Boatfield, an you are so reluctant to do your duty in this matter,\nI'll speak to these people myself.... You are chief constable of the\ndistrict ... indeed, 'tis you should do it ... and in the meanwhile I\npray you, at least to give orders that the coffin be not nailed down.\"\n\nThe kindly squire would have entered a further protest. He did not see\nthe necessity of confronting an old woman with the gruesome sight of a\nmutilated corpse, nor did he perceive justifiable cause for further\nformalities of identification.\n\nBut Sir Marmaduke having spoken very peremptorily, had already turned on\nhis heel without waiting for his friend's protest, and was striding\nacross the patch of rough stubble, which bordered the railing round the\nfront of the cottage. Squire Boatfield reluctantly followed him. The\nnext moment de Chavasse had lifted the latch of the gate, crossed the\nshort flagged path and now knocked loudly against the front door.\n\nApparently there was no desire for secrecy or rebellion on the part of\nthe dwellers of the cottage, for hardly had Sir Marmaduke's imperious\nknock echoed against the timbered walls, than the door was opened from\nwithin by Richard Lambert who, seeing the two gentlemen standing on the\nthreshold, stepped back immediately, allowing them to pass.\n\nThe old Quakeress and Richard were seemingly not alone. Two ladies sat\nin those same straight-backed chairs, wherein, some fifty hours ago Adam\nLambert and the French prince had agreed upon that fateful meeting on\nthe brow of the cliff.\n\nSir Marmaduke's restless eyes took in at a glance every detail of that\nlittle parlor, which he had known so intimately. The low lintel of the\ndoor, which had always forced him to stoop as he entered, the central\ntable with the pewter candlesticks upon it, the elm chairs shining like\nmirrors in response to the Quakeress' maddening passion for cleanliness.\n\nEverything was just as it had been those few hours ago, when last he had\npicked up his broad-brimmed hat from the table and walked out of the\ncottage into the night. Everything was the same as it had been when his\nyoung girl-wife pushed a leather wallet across the table to him: the\nwallet which contained the fortune that he had not yet dared to turn\nfully to his own account.\n\nAye! it was all just the same: for even at this moment as he stood there\nin the room, Sue, pale and still, faced him from across the table. For a\nmoment he was silent, nor did anybody speak. Squire Boatfield felt\nunaccountably embarrassed, certain that he was intruding, vaguely\nwondering why the atmosphere in the cottage was so heavy and\noppressive.\n\nBehind him, Richard Lambert had quietly closed the front door; the old\nwoman stood in the background; the dusting-cloth which she had been\nplying so vigorously had dropped out of her hand when the two gentlemen\nhad appeared in her little parlor so unexpectedly.\n\nSir Marmaduke was the first to break the silence.\n\n\"My dear Sue,\" he said curtly, \"this is a strange place indeed wherein\nto find your ladyship.\"\n\nHe cast a sharp, inquiring glance at her, then at his sister-in-law, who\nwas still sitting by the hearth.\n\n\"She insisted on coming,\" said Mistress de Chavasse with a shrug of the\nshoulders, \"and I had not the power to stop her; I thought it best,\ntherefore, to accompany her.\"\n\nShe was wearing the cloak and hood which Sir Marmaduke had seen round\nher shoulders when awhile ago he had met her in the hall of the Court.\nApparently she had started out with Sue in his immediate wake, and now\nhe had a distinct recollection that while the mare was slowly ambling\nalong, he had looked back once or twice and seen two dark figures\nwalking some fifty yards behind him on the road which he himself had\njust traversed.\n\nAt the moment he had imagined that they were some village folk, wending\ntheir way towards Acol: now he was conscious of nerve-racking irritation\nat the thought that if he had only turned the mare's head back toward\nthe Court--as he had at one time intended to do--he could have averted\nthis present meeting--it almost seemed like a confrontation--here, in\nthis cottage on the self-same spot, where thought of murder had first\nstruck upon his brain.\n\nThere was something inexplicable, strangely puzzling now in Sue's\nattitude.\n\nWhen de Chavasse had entered, she had risen from her chair and, as if\ndeliberately, had walked over to the spot where she had stood during\nthat momentous interview, when she relinquished her fortune entirely and\nwithout protest, into the hands of the man whom she had married, and\nwhom she believed to be her lord.\n\nHer gaze now--calm and fixed, and withal vaguely searching--rested on\nher guardian's face. The fixity of her look increased his nerve-tension.\nThe others, too, were regarding him with varying feelings which were\nfreely expressed in their eyes. Boatfield seemed upset and somewhat\nresentful, the old woman sullen, despite the deference in her attitude,\nLambert defiant, wrathful, nay! full of an incipient desire to avenge\npast wrongs.\n\nAnd dominating all, there was Editha's look of bewilderment, of\npuzzledom in her face at a mystery whereat her senses were beginning to\nreel, that mute questioning of the eyes, which speaks of turbulent\nthoughts within.\n\nSir Marmaduke uttered an exclamation of impatience.\n\n\"You must return to the Court and at once,\" he said, avoiding Sue's\ngaze and speaking directly to Editha, \"the men are outside, with\nlanterns. You'll have to walk quickly an you wish to reach home before\ntwilight.\"\n\nBut even while he spoke, Sue--not heeding him--had turned to Squire\nBoatfield. She went up to him, holding out her hands as if in\ninstinctive childlike appeal for protection, to a kindly man.\n\n\"This mystery is horrible!\" she murmured.\n\nBoatfield took her small hands in his, patting them gently the while,\ndesiring to soothe and comfort her, for she seemed deeply agitated and\nthere was a wild look of fear from time to time in her pale face.\n\n\"Sir Marmaduke is right,\" said the squire gently, \"this is indeed no\nplace for your ladyship. I did not see you arrive or I had at once\npersuaded you to go.\"\n\nDe Chavasse would again have interposed. He stooped and picked up Sue's\ncloak which had fallen to the ground, and as he went up to her with the\nobvious intention of replacing it around her shoulders, she checked him,\nwith a slight motion of her hand.\n\n\"I only heard of this terrible crime an hour ago,\" she said, speaking\nonce more to Boatfield, \"and as I methinks, am the only person in the\nworld who can throw light upon this awesome mystery, I thought it my\nduty to come.\"\n\n\"Of a truth 'twas brave of your ladyship,\" quoth the squire, feeling a\nlittle bewildered at this strange announcement, \"but surely ... you\ndid not know this man?\"\n\n\"If the rumor which hath reached me be correct,\" she replied quietly,\n\"then indeed did I know the murdered man intimately. Prince Am\u00c3\u00a9d\u00c3\u00a9\nd'Orl\u00c3\u00a9ans was my husband.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVII\n\nTHE OLD WOMAN\n\n\nThere was silence in the tiny cottage parlor as the young girl made this\nextraordinary announcement in a firm if toneless voice, without\nflinching and meeting with a sort of stubborn pride the five pairs of\neyes which were now riveted upon her.\n\nFrom outside came the hum of many voices, dull and subdued, like the\nbuzzing of a swarm of bees, and against the small window panes the\nincessant patter of icy rain driven and lashed by the gale. Anon the\nwind moaned in the wide chimney, ... it seemed like the loud sigh of the\nFates, satisfied at the tangle wrought by their relentless fingers in\nthe threads of all these lives.\n\nSir Marmaduke, after a slight pause, had contrived to utter an\noath--indicative of the wrath he, as Lady Sue's guardian, should have\nfelt at her statement. Squire Boatfield frowned at the oath. He had\nnever liked de Chavasse and disapproved more than ever of the man's\nattitude towards his womenkind now.\n\nThe girl was in obvious, terrible distress: what she was feeling at this\nmoment when she was taking those around her into her confidence could be\nas nothing compared to what she must have endured when she first heard\nthe news that her strange bridegroom had been murdered.\n\nThe kindly squire, though admitting the guardian's wrath, thought that\nits violent expression was certainly ill-timed. He allowed Sue to\nrecover herself, for the more calm was her attitude outwardly, the more\nterrible must be the effort which she was making at self-control.\n\nSue's eyes were fixed steadily upon her guardian, and Richard Lambert's\nupon her. Both these young people who had carved their own Fate in the\nvery rock which now had shattered their lives, seemed to be searching\nfor something vague, unavowed and mysterious which instinct told them\nwas there, but which was so elusive, so intangible that the soul of each\nrecoiled, even whilst it tried to probe.\n\nEntirely against her will Sue--whilst she looked on her guardian--could\nthink of nothing save of that day in Dover, the lonely church, the\ngloomy vestry, and that weird patter of the rain against the window\npanes.\n\nShe was not ashamed of what she had done, only of what she had felt for\nhim, whom she now believed to be dead; that she gave him her fortune was\nnothing, she neither regretted nor cared about that. What, in the mind\nof a young and romantic girl, was the value of a fortune squandered,\nwhen that priceless treasure--her first love--had already been thrown\naway? But now she would no longer judge the dead. The money which he had\nfilched from her, Fate and a murderous hand had quickly taken back from\nhim, crushing beneath those chalk boulders his many desires, his vast\nambitions, a worthless life and incomparable greed.\n\nHer love, which he had stolen ... that he could not give back: not that\nardent, whole-souled, enthusiastic love; not the romantic idealism, the\nhero-worship, that veil of fantasy behind which first love is wont to\nhide its ephemerality. But she would not now judge the dead. Her\nromantic love lay buried in the lonely church at Dover, and she was\nstriving not to think even of its grave.\n\nSquire Boatfield's kindly voice recalled her to her immediate\nsurroundings and to the duty--self-imposed--which had brought her\nthither.\n\n\"My dear child,\" he said, speaking with unwonted solemnity, \"if what you\nhave just stated be, alas! the truth, then indeed, you and you only can\nthrow some light on the terrible mystery which has been puzzling us all\n... you may be the means which God hath chosen for bringing an evildoer\nto justice.... Will you, therefore, try ... though it may be very\npainful to you ... will you try and tell us everything that is in your\nmind ... everything which may draw the finger of God and our poor eyes\nto the miscreant who hath committed such an awful crime.\"\n\n\"I fear me I have not much to tell,\" replied Sue simply, \"but I feel\nthat it is my duty to suggest to the two magistrates here present what I\nthink was the motive which prompted this horrible crime.\"\n\n\"You can suggest a motive for the crime?\" interposed Sir Marmaduke,\nstriving to sneer, although his voice sounded quite toneless, for his\nthroat was parched and his tongue clove to the roof of his mouth, \"by\nGad! 'twere vastly interesting to hear your ladyship's views.\"\n\nHe tried to speak flippantly, at which Squire Boatfield frowned\ndeprecation. Lambert, without a word, had brought a chair near to Lady\nSue, and with a certain gentle authority, he forced her to sit down.\n\n\"It was a crime, of that I feel sure,\" said Sue, \"nathless, that can be\neasily proven ... when ... when it has been discovered whether money and\nsecurities contained in a wallet of leather have been found among Prince\nAm\u00c3\u00a9d\u00c3\u00a9's effects.\"\n\n\"Money and securities?\" ejaculated Sir Marmaduke with a loud oath, which\nhe contrived to bring forth with the violence of genuine wrath, \"Money\nand securities? ... Forsooth, I trust ...\"\n\n\"My money and my securities, sir,\" she interposed with obvious hauteur,\n\"which I had last night and in this self-same room placed in the hands\nof Prince Am\u00c3\u00a9d\u00c3\u00a9 d'Orl\u00c3\u00a9ans, my husband.\"\n\nShe said this with conscious pride. Whatever change her feelings may\nhave undergone towards the man who had at one time been the embodiment\nof her most cherished dreams, she would not let her sneering guardian\nsee that she had repented of her choice.\n\nDeath had endowed her exiled prince with a dignity which had never been\nhis in life, and the veil of tragedy which now lay over the mysterious\nstranger and his still more mysterious life, had called forth to its\nuttermost the young wife's sense of loyalty to him.\n\n\"Not your entire fortune, my dear, dear child, I hope ...\" ejaculated\nSquire Boatfield, more horror-struck this time than he had been when\nfirst he had heard of the terrible murder.\n\n\"The wallet contained my entire fortune,\" rejoined Sue calmly, \"all that\nMaster Skyffington had placed in my hands on the day that my father\nwilled that it should be given me.\"\n\n\"Such folly is nothing short of criminal,\" said Sir Marmaduke roughly,\n\"nathless, had not the gentleman been murdered that night he would have\nshown Thanet and you a clean pair of heels, taking your money with him,\nof course.\"\n\n\"Aye! aye! but he was murdered,\" said Squire Boatfield firmly, \"the\nquestion only is by whom?\"\n\n\"Some footpad who haunts the cliffs,\" rejoined de Chavasse lightly,\n\"'tis simple enough.\"\n\n\"Simple, mayhap ...\" mused the squire, \"yet ...\"\n\nHe paused a moment and once more silence fell on all those assembled in\nthe small cottage parlor. Sir Marmaduke felt as if every vein in his\nbody was gradually being turned to stone.\n\nThe sense of expectancy was so overwhelming that it completely paralyzed\nevery other faculty within him, and Editha's searching eyes seemed like\na corroding acid touching an aching wound. Yet for the moment there was\nno danger. He had so surrounded himself and his crimes with mystery that\nit would take more than a country squire's slowly moving brain to draw\naside that weird and ghostlike curtain which hid his evil deeds.\n\nNo! there was no danger--as yet!\n\nBut he cursed himself for a fool and a coward, not to have gone\naway--abroad--long ere such a possible confrontation threatened him. He\ncursed himself for being here at all--and above all for having left the\nsmith's clothes and the leather wallet in that lonely pavilion in the\npark.\n\nSquire Boatfield's kind eyes now rested on the old woman, who, awed and\nsilent--shut out by her infirmities from this strange drama which was\nbeing enacted in her cottage--had stood calm and impassive by, trying to\nread with that wonderful quickness of intuition which the poverty of one\nsense gives to the others--what was going on round her, since she could\nnot hear.\n\nHer eyes--pale and dim, heavy-lidded and deeply-lined--rested often on\nthe face of Richard Lambert, who, leaning against the corner of the\nhearth, had watched the proceedings silently and intently. When the\nQuakeress's faded gaze met that of the young man, there was a quick and\nanxious look which passed from her to him: a look of entreaty for\ncomfort, one of fear and of growing horror.\n\n\"And so the exiled prince lodged in your cottage, mistress?\" said\nSquire Boatfield, after a while, turning to Mistress Lambert.\n\nThe old woman's eyes wandered from Richard to the squire. The look of\nfear in them vanished, giving place to good-natured placidity. She\nshuffled forward, in the manner which had so oft irritated her lodger.\n\n\"Eh? ... what?\" she queried, approaching the squire, \"I am somewhat hard\nof hearing these times.\"\n\n\"We were speaking of your lodger, mistress,\" rejoined Boatfield, raising\nhis voice, \"harm hath come to him, you know.\"\n\n\"Aye! aye!\" she replied blandly, \"harm hath come to our lodger.... Nay!\nthe Lord hath willed it so.... The stranger was queer in his ways.... I\ndon't wonder that harm hath come to him....\"\n\n\"You remember him well, mistress?--him and the clothes he used to wear?\"\nasked Squire Boatfield.\n\n\"Oh, yes! I remember the clothes,\" she rejoined. \"I saw them again on\nthe dead who now lieth in Adam's forge ... the same curious clothes of a\ntruth ... clothes the Lord would condemn as wantonness and vanity.... I\nsaw them again on the dead man,\" she reiterated garrulously, \"the frills\nand furbelows ... things the Lord hateth ... and which no Christian\nshould place upon his person ... yet the foreigner wore them ... he had\nnone other ... and went out with them on him that night that the Lord\nsent him down into perdition....\"\n\n\"Did you see him go out that night, mistress?\" asked the squire.\n\n\"Eh? ... what? ...\"\n\n\"Did he go out alone?\"\n\nThe dimmed eyes of the old woman roamed restlessly from face to face. It\nseemed as if that look of horror and of fear once more struggled to\nappear within the pale orbs. Yet the squire looked on her with kindness,\nand Lady Sue's tear-veiled eyes expressed boundless sympathy. Richard,\non the other hand, did not look at her, his gaze was riveted on Sir\nMarmaduke de Chavasse with an intensity which caused the latter to meet\nthat look, trying to defy it, and then to flinch before its expression\nof passionate wrath.\n\n\"We wish to know where your nephew Adam is, mistress,\" now broke in de\nChavasse roughly, \"the squire and I would wish to ask him a few\nquestions.\"\n\nThen as the Quakeress did not reply, he added almost savagely:\n\n\"Why don't you answer, woman? Are ye still hard of hearing?\"\n\n\"Your pardon, Sir Marmaduke,\" interposed Lambert firmly, \"my aunt is old\nand feeble. She hath been much upset and over anxious ... seeing that my\nbrother Adam is still from home.\"\n\nSir Marmaduke broke into a loud and prolonged laugh.\n\n\"Ha! ha! ha! good master ... so I understand ... your brother is from\nhome ... whilst the wallet containing her ladyship's fortune has\ndisappeared along with him, eh?\"\n\n\"What are they saying, lad?\" queried the old woman in her trembling\nvoice, \"what are they saying? I am fearful lest there's something wrong\nwith Adam....\"\n\n\"Nay, nay, dear ... there's naught amiss,\" said Lambert soothingly,\n\"there's naught amiss....\"\n\nInstinctively now Sue had risen. Sir Marmaduke's cruel laugh had grated\nhorribly on her ear, rousing an echo in her memory which she could not\nunderstand but which caused her to encircle the trembling figure of the\nold Quakeress with young, protecting arms.\n\n\"Are Squire Boatfield and I to understand, Lambert,\" continued Sir\nMarmaduke, speaking to the young man, \"that your brother Adam has\nunaccountably disappeared since the night on which the foreigner met\nwith his tragic fate? Nay, Boatfield,\" he added, turning to the squire,\nas Lambert had remained silent, \"methinks you, as chief magistrate,\nshould see your duty clearly. 'Tis a warrant you should sign and\nquickly, too, ere a scoundrel slip through the noose of justice. I can\non the morrow to Dover, there to see the chief constable, but Pyot and\nhis men should not be idle the while.\"\n\n\"What is he saying, my dear?\" murmured Mistress Lambert, timorously, as\nshe clung with pathetic fervor to the young girl beside her, \"what is\nthe trouble?\"\n\n\"Where is your nephew Adam?\" said de Chavasse roughly.\n\n\"I do not know,\" she retorted with amazing strength of voice, as she\ngently but firmly disengaged herself from the restraining arms that\nwould have kept her back. \"I do not know,\" she repeated, \"what is it to\nthee, where he is? Art accusing him perchance of doing away with that\nforeign devil?\"\n\nHer voice rose shrill and resonant, echoing in the low-ceilinged room;\nher pale eyes, dimmed with many tears, with hard work, and harder piety\nwere fixed upon the man who had dared to accuse her lad.\n\nHe tried not to flinch before that gaze, to keep up the air of mockery,\nthe sound of a sneer. Outside the murmur of voices had become somewhat\nlouder, the shuffling of bare feet on the flag-stones could now be\ndistinctly heard.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVIII\n\nTHE VOICE OF THE DEAD\n\n\nThe next moment a timid knock against the front door caused everyone to\nstart. A strange eerie feeling descended on the hearts of all, of\ninnocent and of guilty, of accuser and of defender. The knock seemed to\nhave come from spectral hands, for 'twas followed by no further sound.\n\nThen again the knock.\n\nLambert went to the door and opened it.\n\n\"Be the quality here?\" queried a timid voice.\n\n\"Squire Boatfield is here and Sir Marmaduke de Chavasse,\" replied\nLambert, \"what is it, Mat? Come in.\"\n\nThe squire had risen at sound of his name, and now went to the door,\nglad enough to shake himself free from that awful oppression which hung\non the cottage like a weight of evil.\n\n\"What is it, Mat?\" he asked.\n\nA man in rough shirt and coarse breeches and with high boots reaching up\nto the thigh was standing humbly in the doorway. He was bareheaded and\nhis lanky hair, wet with rain and glittering with icy moisture, was\nblown about by the gale. At sight of the squire he touched his forelock.\n\n\"The hour is getting late, squire,\" he said hesitatingly, \"we carriers\nbe ready.... 'Tis an hour or more down to Minster ... walking with a\nheavy burden I mean.... If your Honor would give the order, mayhap we\nmight nail down the coffin lid now and make a start.\"\n\nMarmaduke de Chavasse, too, had turned towards the doorway. Both men\nlooked out on the little crowd which had congregated beyond the little\ngate. It was long past three o'clock now, and the heavy snow clouds\noverhead obscured the scanty winter light, and precipitated the approach\nof evening. In the gray twilight, a group of men could be seen standing\nsomewhat apart from the others. All were bareheaded, and all wore rough\nshirts and breeches of coarse worsted, drab or brown in color, toning in\nwith the dull monochrome of the background.\n\nBetween them in the muddy road stood the long deal coffin. The sheet\nwhich covered it, rendered heavy with persistent wet, flapped dismally\nagainst the wooden sides of the box. Overhead a group of rooks were\ncircling whilst uttering their monotonous call.\n\nA few women had joined their men-folk, attracted by the novelty of the\nproceedings, yielding their momentary comfort to their feeling of\ncuriosity. They had drawn their kirtles over their heads and looked like\ngigantic oval balls, gray or black, with small mud-stained feet peeping\nout below.\n\nSue had thrown an appealing look at Squire Boatfield, when she saw that\ndismal cort\u00c3\u00a8ge. Her husband, her prince! the descendant of the Bourbons,\nthe regenerator of France lying there--unrecognizable, horrible and\nloathsome--in a rough wooden coffin hastily nailed together by a village\ncarpenter.\n\nShe did not wish to look on him: and with mute eyes begged the squire to\nspare her and to spare the old woman, who, through the doorway had\ncaught sight of the drabby little crowd, and of the deal box on the\nground.\n\nLambert, too, at sight of the cort\u00c3\u00a8ge had gone to the Quakeress, the\nkind soul who had cared for him and his brother, two nameless lads,\nwithout home save the one she had provided for them. He trusted in\nSquire Boatfield's sense of humanity not to force this septuagenarian to\nan effort of nerve and will altogether beyond her powers.\n\nTogether the two young people were using gentle persuasion to get the\nold woman to the back room, whence she could not see the dreary scene\nnow or presently, the slow winding of the dismal little procession down\nthe road which leads to Minster, and whence she could not hear that\nweird flapping of the wet sheet against the side of the coffin, an echo\nto the slow and muffled tolling of the church bell some little distance\naway.\n\nBut the old woman was obstinate. She struggled against the persuasion of\nyoung arms. Things had been said in her cottage just now, which she must\nhear more distinctly: vague accusations had been framed, a cruel and\nsneering laugh had echoed through the house from whence one of her\nlads--Adam--was absent.\n\n\"No! no!\" she said with quiet firmness, as Lambert urged her to\nwithdraw, \"let be, lad ... let be ... ye cannot deceive the old woman\nall of ye.... The Lord hath put wool in my ears, so I cannot hear ...\nbut my eyes are good.... I can see your faces.... I can read them....\nSpeak man!\" she said, as she suddenly disengaged herself from Richard's\nrestraining arms and walked deliberately up to Marmaduke de Chavasse,\n\"speak man.... Didst thou accuse Adam?\"\n\nAn involuntary \"No!\" escaped from the squire's kindly heart and lips.\nBut Sir Marmaduke shrugged his shoulders.\n\nThe crisis which by his own acts, by his own cowardice, he himself had\nprecipitated, was here now. Fatality had overtaken him. Whether the\nwhole truth would come to light he did not know. Truly at this moment he\nhardly cared. He did not feel as if he were himself, but another being\nbefore whom stood another Sir Marmaduke de Chavasse, on whom he--a\nspecter, a ghoul, a dream figure--was about to pass judgment.\n\nHe knew that he need do nothing now, for without his help or any effort\non his part, that morbid curiosity which had racked his brain for two\ndays would be fully satisfied. He would know absolutely now, exactly\nwhat everyone thought of the mysterious French prince and of his\nterrible fate on Epple sands.\n\nThank Satan and all his hordes of devils that heavy chalk boulders had\ndone so complete a work of obliteration.\n\nBut whilst he looked down with complete indifference on the old woman,\nshe looked about from one face to the other, trying to read what cruel\nthoughts of Adam lurked behind those obvious expressions of sympathy.\n\n\"So that foreign devil hath done mischief at last,\" she now said loudly,\nher tremulous voice gaining in strength as she spoke, \"the Lord would\nnot allow him to do it living ... so the devil hath helped him to it now\nthat he is dead.... But I tell you that Adam is innocent.... There was\nno harm in the lad ... a little rough at times ... but no harm ... he'd\nno father to bring him up ... and his mother was a wanton ... so there\nwas only the foolish old woman to look after the boys ... but there's no\nharm in the lad ... there's no harm!\"\n\nHer voice broke down now in a sob, her throat seemed choked, but with an\neffort which seemed indeed amazing in one of her years, she controlled\nher tears, and for a moment was silent. The gray twilight crept in\nthrough the door of the cottage, where Mat, bareheaded and humble, still\nwaited for the order to go.\n\nSir Marmaduke would have interrupted the old woman's talk ere this, but\nhis limbs were now completely paralyzed: he might have been made of\nstone, so rigid did he feel himself to be: a marble image, or else a\nspecter, a shadow-figure that existed yet could not move.\n\nThere was such passionate earnestness in the old woman's words that\neveryone else remained dumb. Richard, whose heart was filled with dread,\nwho had endured agonies of anxiety since the disappearance of his\nbrother, had but one great desire, which was to spare to the kind soul a\nknowledge which would mean death or worse to her.\n\nAs for Editha de Chavasse, she was a mere spectator still: so puzzled,\nso bewildered that she was quite convinced at this moment, that she must\nbe mad. She could not encounter Marmaduke's eyes, try how she might. The\nlook in his face horrified her less than it mystified her. She\nalone--save the murderer himself--knew that the man who lay in that deal\ncoffin out there was not the mysterious foreigner who had never existed.\n\nBut if not the stranger, then who was it, who was dead? and what had\nAdam Lambert to do with the whole terrible deed?\n\nSue once more tried to lead Mistress Lambert gently away, but she pushed\nthe young girl aside quite firmly:\n\n\"Ye don't believe me?\" she asked, looking from one face to the other,\n\"ye don't believe me, yet I tell ye all that Adam is innocent ... and\nthat the Lord will not allow the innocent to be unjustly condemned....\nAye! He will e'en let the dead arise, I say, and proclaim the innocence\nof my lad!\"\n\nHer eyes--with dilated pupils and pale opaque rims--had the look of the\nseer in them now; she gazed straight out before her into the rain-laden\nair, and it seemed almost as if in it she could perceive visions of\navenging swords, of defending angels and accusing ghouls, that she could\nhear whisperings of muffled voices and feel beckoning hands guiding her\nto a world peopled by specters and evil beings that prey upon the dead.\n\n\"Let me pass!\" she said with amazing vigor, as Squire Boatfield, with\nkindly concern, tried to bar her exit through the door, \"let me pass I\nsay! the dead and I have questions to ask of one another.\"\n\n\"This is madness!\" broke in Marmaduke de Chavasse with an effort; \"that\nbody is not a fit sight for a woman to look upon.\"\n\nHe would have seized the Quakeress by the arm in order to force her\nback, but Richard Lambert already stood between her and him.\n\n\"Let no one dare to lay a hand on her,\" he said quietly.\n\nAnd the old woman escaping from all those who would have restrained her,\nwalked rapidly through the doorway and down the flagged path rendered\nslippery with the sleet. The gale caught the white wings of her coif,\ncausing them to flutter about her ears, and freezing strands of her gray\nlocks which stood out now all round her head like a grizzled halo.\n\nShe could scarcely advance, for the wind drove her kirtle about her lean\nthighs, and her feet with the heavy tan shoes sank ankle deep in the\npuddles formed by the water in the interstices of the flagstones. The\nrain beat against her face, mingling with the tears which now flowed\nfreely down her cheeks. But she did not heed the discomfort nor yet the\ncold, and she would not be restrained.\n\nThe next moment she stood beside the rough wooden coffin and with a\nsteady hand had lifted the wet sheet, which continued to flap with dull,\nmournful sound round the feet of the dead.\n\nThe Quakeress looked down upon the figure stretched out here in\ndeath--neither majestic nor peaceful, but horrible and weirdly\nmysterious. She did not flinch at the sight. Resentment against the\nforeigner dimmed her sense of horror.\n\n\"So my fine prince,\" she said, whilst awed at the spectacle of this old\nwoman parleying with the dead, carriers and mourners had instinctively\nmoved a few steps away from her, \"so thou wouldst harm my boy! ... Thou\nalways didst hate him ... thou with thy grand airs, and thy rough\nways.... Had the Lord allowed it, this hand of thine would ere now have\nbeen raised against him ... as it oft was raised against the old woman\n... whose infirmities should have rendered her sacred in thy sight.\"\n\nShe stooped, and deliberately raised the murdered man's hand in hers,\nand for one moment fixed her gaze upon it. For that one moment she was\nsilent, looking down at the rough fingers, the coarse nails, the\nblistered palm.\n\nThen still holding the hand in hers, she looked up, then round at every\nface which was turned fixedly upon her. Thus she encountered the eyes of\nthe men and women, present here only to witness an unwonted spectacle,\nthen those of the kindly squire, of Lady Sue, of Mistress de Chavasse,\nand of her other lad--Richard--all of whom had instinctively followed\nher down the short flagged path in the wake of her strange and prophetic\npilgrimage.\n\nLastly her eyes met those of Marmaduke de Chavasse. Then she spoke\nslowly in a low muffled voice, which gradually grew more loud and more\nfull of passionate strength.\n\n\"Aye! the Lord is just,\" she said, \"the Lord is great! It is the dead\nwhich shall rise again and proclaim the innocence of the just, and the\nguilt of the wicked.\"\n\nShe paused a while, and stooped to kiss the marble-like hand which she\nheld tightly grasped in hers.\n\n\"Adam!\" she murmured, \"Adam, my boy! ... my lad! ...\"\n\nThe men and women looked on, stupidly staring, not understanding yet,\nwhat new tragedy had suddenly taken the place of the old.\n\n\"Aunt, aunt dear,\" whispered Lambert, who had pushed his way forward,\nand now put his arm round the old woman, for she had begun to sway,\n\"what is the matter, dear?\" he repeated anxiously, \"what does it mean?\"\n\nAnd conquering his own sense of horror and repulsion, he tried to\ndisengage the cold and rigid hand of the dead from the trembling grasp\nof the Quakeress. But she would not relinquish her hold, only she turned\nand looked steadily at the young lad, whilst her voice rose firm and\nharsh above the loud patter of the rain and the moaning of the wind\nthrough the distant; trees.\n\n\"It means, my lad,\" she said, \"it means all of you ... that what I said\nwas true ... that Adam is innocent of crime ... for he lies here dead\n... and the Lord will see that his death shall not remain unavenged.\"\n\nOnce more she kissed the rough hand, beautiful now with that cold beauty\nwhich the rigidity of death imparts; then she replaced it reverently,\nsilently, and fell upon her knees in the wet mud, beside the coffin.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIX\n\nTHE HOME-COMING OF ADAM LAMBERT\n\n\nAll heads were bent; none of the ignorant folk who stood around would\nhave dared even to look at the old woman kneeling beside that rough deal\nbox which contained the body of her lad. A reverent feeling had killed\nall curiosity: bewilderment at the extraordinary and wholly unexpected\nturn of events had been merged in a sense of respectful awe, which\nrendered every mouth silent, and lowered every lid.\n\nSquire Boatfield, almost paralyzed with astonishment, had murmured half\nstupidly:\n\n\"Adam Lambert ... dead? ... I do not understand.\"\n\nHe turned to Marmaduke de Chavasse as if vaguely, instinctively\nexpecting an answer to the terrible puzzle from him.\n\nDe Chavasse's feet, over which he himself seemed to have no control, had\nof a truth led him forward, so that he, too, stood not far from the old\nwoman now. He had watched her--silent and rigid,--conscious only of one\nthing--a trivial matter certes--of Editha's inquiring eyes fixed\nsteadily upon him.\n\nEverything else had been merged in a kind of a dream. But the mute\nquestion in those eyes was what concerned him. It seemed to represent\nthe satisfaction of that morbid curiosity which had been such a terrible\nobsession during these past nerve-racking days.\n\nEditha, realizing the identity of the dead man, would there and then\nknow the entire truth. But Editha's fate was too closely linked to his\nown to render her knowledge of that truth dangerous to de Chavasse:\ntherefore, with him it was merely a sense of profound satisfaction that\nsomeone would henceforth share his secret with him.\n\nIt is quite impossible to analyze the thoughts of the man who thus stood\nby--a silent and almost impassive spectator--of a scene, wherein his\nfate, his life, an awful retribution and deadly justice, were all\nhanging in the balance. He was not mad, nor did he act with either\nirrelevance or rashness. The sense of self-protection was still keen in\nhim ... violently keen ... although undoubtedly he, and he alone, was\nresponsible for the events which culminated in the present crisis.\n\nThe whole aspect of affairs had changed from the moment that the real\nidentity of the dead had been established. Everyone here present would\nregard this new mystery in an altogether different light to that by\nwhich they had viewed the former weird problem; but still there need be\nno danger to the murderer.\n\nEditha would know, of course, but no one else, and it would be vastly\ncurious anon to see what lady Sue would do.\n\nTherefore, Sir Marmaduke was chiefly conscious of Editha's presence,\nand then only of Sue.\n\n\"Some old woman's folly,\" he now said roughly, in response to Squire\nBoatfield's mute inquiry, \"awhile ago she identified the clothes as\nhaving belonged to the foreign prince.\"\n\n\"Aye, the clothes, de Chavasse,\" murmured the squire meditatively, \"the\nclothes, but not the man ... and 'twas you yourself who just now....\"\n\n\"Master Lambert should know his own brother,\" here came in a suppressed\nmurmur from one or two of the men, who respectful before the quality,\nhad now become too excited to keep altogether silent.\n\n\"Of course I know my brother,\" retorted Richard Lambert boldly, \"and can\nbut curse mine own cowardice in not defending him ere this.\"\n\n\"What more lies are we to hear?\" sneered de Chavasse, \"surely,\nBoatfield, this stupid scene hath lasted long enough.\"\n\n\"Put my knowledge to the test, sir,\" rejoined Lambert. \"My brother's arm\nwas scarred by a deep cut from shoulder to elbow, caused by the fall of\na sharp-bladed ax--'twas the right arm ... will you see, Sir Marmaduke,\nor will you allow me to lay bare the right arm of this man ... to see if\nI had lied? ...\"\n\nSquire Boatfield, conquering his reluctance, had approached nearer to\nthe coffin; he, too, lifted the dead man's arm, as the old woman had\ndone just now, and he gazed down meditatively at the hand, which though\nshapely, was obviously rough and toil-worn. Then, with a firm and\ndeliberate gesture, he undid the sleeve of the doublet and pushed it\nback, baring the arm up to the shoulder.\n\nHe looked at the lifeless flesh for a moment, there where a deep and\nlong scar stood out plainly between the elbow and shoulder like the\nveining in a block of marble. Then he pulled the sleeve down again.\n\n\"Neither you, nor Mistress Lambert have lied, master,\" he said simply.\n\"'Tis Adam Lambert who lies here ... murdered ... and if that be so,\" he\ncontinued firmly, \"then the man who put these clothes upon the body of\nthe smith is his murderer ... the foreigner who called himself Prince\nAm\u00c3\u00a9d\u00c3\u00a9 d'Orl\u00c3\u00a9ans.\"\n\n\"The husband of Lady Sue Aldmarshe,\" quoth Sir Marmaduke, breaking into\na loud laugh.\n\nThe rain had momentarily ceased, although the gale, promising further\nhavoc, still continued that mournful swaying of the dead branches of the\ntrees. But a gentle drip-drip had replaced that incessant patter. The\nhumid atmosphere had long ago penetrated through rough shirts and\nworsted breeches, causing the spectators of this weird tragedy to shiver\nwith the cold.\n\nThe shades of evening had begun to gather in. It were useless now to\nattempt to reach Minster before nightfall: nor presumably would the old\nQuakeress thus have parted from the dead body of her lad.\n\nRichard Lambert had begged that the coffin might be taken into the\ncottage. The old woman's co-religionists would help her to obtain for\nAdam fitting and Christian burial.\n\nAfter Sir Marmaduke's sneering taunt no one had spoken. For these yokels\nand their womenfolk the matter had passed altogether beyond their ken.\nBewildered, not understanding, above all more than half fearful, they\nconsulted one another vaguely and mutely with eyes and quaint expressive\ngestures, wondering what had best be done.\n\n'Twas fortunate that the rain had ceased. One by one the women, still\nholding their kirtles tightly round their shoulders, began to move away.\nThe deal box seemed to have reached a degree of mystery from which 'twas\nbest to keep at a distance. The men, too--those who had come as\nspectators--were gradually edging away; some walked off with their\nwomenfolk, others hung back in groups of three or four discussing the\nmost hospitable place to which 'twere best to adjourn.\n\nAll wore a strangely shamed expression of timidity--almost of\nself-deprecation, as if apologetic for their presence here when the\nquality had matters of such grave import to discuss. No one had really\nunderstood Sir Marmaduke's sneering taunt, only they felt instinctively\nthat there were some secrets which it had been disrespectful even to\nattempt to guess.\n\nThose who had been prepared to carry the coffin to Minster were the last\nto hang back. Squire Boatfield was obviously giving some directions to\ntheir foreman, Mat, who tugged at his forelock at intervals, indicating\nthat he was prepared to obey. The others stood aside waiting for\ninstructions.\n\nThus the deal box remained on the ground, exactly opposite the tiny\nwooden gate, strangely isolated and neglected-looking after the\ndispersal of the interested crowd which had surrounded it awhile ago. It\nseemed as if with the establishment of the real identity of the dead the\nintensity of the excitement had vanished. The mysterious foreigner had a\nsmall court round him; Adam Lambert, only his brother and the old\nQuakeress.\n\nThey remained beside the coffin, she kneeling with her head buried in\nher wrinkled hands, he standing silent and passionately wrathful both\nagainst one man and against destiny. He had almost screamed with horror\nwhen de Chavasse thus brutally uttered Lady Sue's name: he had seen the\nyoung girl almost sway on her feet, as she smothered the cry of agony\nand horror which at her guardian's callous taunt had risen to her lips.\n\nHe had seen and in his heart worshiped her for the heroic effort which\nshe made to remain outwardly calm, not to betray before a crowd the\nagonizing horror, the awful fear and the burning shame which of a truth\nwould have crushed most women of her tender years. And because he saw\nthat she did not wish to betray one single thought or emotion, he did\nnot approach, nor attempt to show the overwhelming sympathy which he\nfelt.\n\nHe knew that any word from him to her would only call forth more\nmalicious sneers from that strange man, who seemed to be pursuing Lady\nSue and also himself--Lambert--with a tenacious and incomprehensible\nhatred.\n\nRichard remained, therefore, beside his dead brother's coffin,\nsupporting and anon gently raising the old woman from the ground.\n\nMat--the foreman--had joined his comrades and after a word of\nexplanation, they once more gathered round the wooden box. Stooping to\ntheir task, their sinews cracking under the effort, the perspiration\nstreaming from their foreheads, they raised the mortal remains of Adam\nLambert from the ground and hoisted the burden upon their shoulders.\n\nThen they turned into the tiny gate and slowly walked with it along the\nlittle flagged path to the cottage. The men had to stoop as they crossed\nthe threshold, and the heavy box swayed above their powerful shoulders.\n\nThe Quakeress and Richard followed, going within in the wake of the six\nmen. The parlor was then empty, and thus it was that Adam Lambert\nfinally came home.\n\nThe others--Squire Boatfield and Mistress de Chavasse, Lady Sue and Sir\nMarmaduke--had stood aside in the small fore-court, to enable the small\ncort\u00c3\u00a8ge to pass. Directly Richard Lambert and the old woman disappeared\nwithin the gloom of the cottage interior, these four people--each\nindividually the prey of harrowing thoughts--once more turned their\nsteps towards the open road.\n\nThere was nothing more to be done here at this cottage, where the veil\nof mystery which had fallen over the gruesome murder had been so\nunexpectedly lifted by a septuagenarian's hand.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XL\n\nEDITHA'S RETURN\n\n\nSquire Boatfield was vastly perturbed. Never had his position as\nmagistrate seemed so onerous to him, nor his duties as major-general\nquite so arduous. A vague and haunting fear had seized him, a fear\nthat--if he did do his duty, if he did continue his investigations of\nthe mysterious crime--he would learn something vastly horrible and\nawesome, something he had best never know.\n\nHe tried to take indifferent leave of the ladies, yet he quite dreaded\nto meet Lady Sue's eyes. If all the misery, the terror which she must\nfeel, were expressed in them, then indeed, would her young face be a\nheart-breaking sight for any man to see.\n\nHe kissed the hand of Editha de Chavasse, and bowed in mute and\ndeferential sympathy to the young girl-wife, who of a truth had this day\nquaffed at one draught the brimful cup of sorrow and of shame.\n\nAn inexplicable instinct restrained him from taking de Chavasse's hand;\nhe was quite glad indeed that the latter seemingly absorbed in thoughts\nwas not heeding his going.\n\nThe squire in his turn now passed out of the little gate. The evening\nwas drawing in over-rapidly now, and it would be a long and dismal ride\nfrom here to Sarre.\n\nFortunately he had two serving-men with him, each with a lantern. They\nwere now standing beside their master's cob, some few yards down the\nroad, which from this point leads in a straight course down to Sarre.\n\nNot far from the entrance to the forge, Boatfield saw petty-constable\nPyot in close converse with Master Hymn-of-Praise Busy, butler to Sir\nMarmaduke. The man was talking with great volubility, and obvious\nexcitement, and Pyot was apparently torn between his scorn for the\nnarrator's garrulousness, and his fear of losing something of what the\ntalker had to say.\n\nAt sight of Boatfield, Pyot unceremoniously left Master Busy standing,\nopen-mouthed, in the very midst of a voluble sentence, and approached\nthe squire, doffing his cap respectfully as he did so.\n\n\"Will your Honor sign a warrant?\" he asked.\n\n\"A warrant? What warrant?\" queried the worthy squire, who of a truth,\nwas falling from puzzlement to such absolute bewilderment that he felt\nliterally as if his head would burst with the weight of so much mystery\nand with the knowledge of such dire infamy.\n\n\"I think that the scoundrel is cleverer than we thought, your Honor,\"\ncontinued the petty constable, \"we must not allow him to escape.\"\n\n\"I am quite bewildered,\" murmured the squire. \"What is the warrant for?\"\n\n\"For the apprehension of the man whom the folk about here called the\nPrince of Orl\u00c3\u00a9ans. I can set the watches on the go this very night, nay!\nthey shall scour the countryside to some purpose--the murderer cannot be\nvery far, we know that he is dressed in the smith's clothes, we'll get\nhim soon enough, but he may have friends....\"\n\n\"Friends?\"\n\n\"He may have been a real prince, your Honor,\" said Pyot with a laugh,\nwhich contradicted his own suggestion.\n\n\"Aye! aye! ... Mayhap!\"\n\n\"He may have powerful friends ... or such as would resist the watches\n... resist us, mayhap ... a warrant would be useful....\"\n\n\"Aye! aye! you are right, constable,\" said Boatfield, still a little\nbewildered, \"do you come along to Sarre with me, I'll give you a warrant\nthis very night. Have you a horse here?\"\n\n\"Nay, your Honor,\" rejoined the man, \"an it please you, my going to\nSarre would delay matters and the watches could not start their search\nthis night.\"\n\n\"Then what am I to do?\" exclaimed the squire, somewhat impatient of the\nwhole thing now, longing to get away, and to forget, beside his own\ncomfortable fireside, all the harrowing excitement of this unforgettable\nday.\n\n\"Young Lambert is a bookworm, your Honor,\" suggested Pyot, who was keen\non the business, seeing that his zeal, if accompanied by success, would\nsurely mean promotion; \"there'll be ink and paper in the cottage.... An\nyour Honor would but write a few words and sign them, something I could\nshow to a commanding officer, if perchance I needed the help of\nsoldiery, or to the chief constable resident at Dover, for methinks some\nof us must push on that way ... your Honor must forgive ... we should be\nblamed--punished, mayhap--if we allowed such a scoundrel to remain\nunhung....\"\n\n\"As you will, man, as you will,\" sighed the worthy squire impatiently,\n\"but wait!\" he added, as Pyot, overjoyed, had already turned towards the\ncottage, \"wait until Sir Marmaduke de Chavasse and the ladies have\ngone.\"\n\nHe called his serving-men to him and ordered them to start on their way\ntowards home, but to wait for him, with his cob, at the bend of the\nroad, just in the rear of the little church.\n\nSome instinct, for which he could not rightly have accounted, roused in\nhim the desire to keep his return to the cottage a secret from Sir\nMarmaduke. Attended by Pyot, he followed his men down the road, and the\nangle of the cottage soon hid him from view.\n\nDe Chavasse in the meanwhile had ordered his own men to escort the\nladies home. Busy and Toogood lighted their lanterns, whilst Sue and\nEditha, wrapping their cloaks and hoods closely round their heads and\nshoulders, prepared to follow them.\n\nAnon the little procession began slowly to wind its way back towards\nAcol Court.\n\nSir Marmaduke lingered behind for a while, of set purpose: he had no\nwish to walk beside either Editha or Lady Sue, so he took some time in\nmounting his nag, which had been tethered in the rear of the forge. His\nintention was to keep the men with the lanterns in sight, for--though\nthere were no dangerous footpads in Thanet--yet Sir Marmaduke's mood was\nnot one that courted isolation on a dark and lonely road.\n\nTherefore, just before he saw the dim lights of the lanterns\ndisappearing down the road, which at this point makes a sharp dip before\nrising abruptly once more on the outskirts of the wood, Sir Marmaduke\nfinally put his foot in the stirrup and started to follow.\n\nThe mare had scarce gone a few paces before he saw the figure of a woman\ndetaching itself from the little group on ahead, and then turning and\nwalking rapidly back towards the village. He could not immediately\ndistinguish which of the two ladies it was, for the figure was totally\nhidden beneath the ample folds of cloak and hood, but soon as it\napproached, he perceived that it was Editha.\n\nHe would have stopped her by barring the way, he even thought of\ndismounting, thinking mayhap that she had left something behind at the\ncottage, and cursing his men for allowing her to return alone, but quick\nas a flash of lightning she ran past him, dragging her hood closer over\nher face as she ran.\n\nHe hesitated for a few seconds, wondering what it all meant: he even\nturned the mare's head round to see whither Editha was going. She had\nalready reached the railing and gate in front of the cottage; the next\nmoment she had lifted the latch, and Sir Marmaduke could see her blurred\noutline, through the rising mist, walking quickly along the flagged\npath, and then he heard her peremptory knock at the cottage door.\n\nHe waited a while, musing, checking the mare, who longed to be getting\nhome. He fully expected to see Editha return within the next minute or\nso, for--vaguely through the fast-gathering gloom--he had perceived that\nsomeone had opened the door from within, a thin ray of yellowish light\nfalling on Editha's cloaked figure. Then she disappeared into the\ncottage.\n\nOn ahead the swaying lights of the lanterns were rapidly becoming more\nand more indistinguishable in the distance. Apparently Editha's\ndeparture from out the little group had not been noticed by the others.\nThe men were ahead, and Sue, mayhap, was too deeply absorbed in thought\nto pay much heed as to what was going on round her.\n\nSir Marmaduke still hesitated. Editha was not returning, and the cottage\ndoor was once more closed. Courtesy demanded that he should wait so as\nto escort her home.\n\nBut the fact that she had gone back to the cottage, at risk of having to\nwalk back all alone and along a dark and dreary road, bore a weird\nsignificance to this man's tortuous mind. Editha, troubled with a mass\nof vague fears and horrible conjectures, had, mayhap, desired to have\nthem set at rest, or else to hear their final and terrible confirmation.\n\nIn either case Marmaduke de Chavasse had no wish now for a slow amble\nhomewards in company with the one being in the world who knew him for\nwhat he was.\n\nThat thought and also the mad desire to get away at last, to cease with\nthis fateful procrastination and to fly from this country with the\ngolden booty, which he had gained at such awful risks, these caused him\nfinally to turn the mare's head towards home, leaving Editha to follow\nas best she might, in the company of one of the serving-men whom he\nwould send back to meet her.\n\nThe mare was ready to go. He spurred her to a sharp trot. Then having\njoined the little group on ahead, he sent Master Courage Toogood back\nwith his lantern, with orders to inquire at the cottage for Mistress de\nChavasse and there to await her pleasure.\n\nHe asked Lady Sue to mount behind him, but this she refused to do. So he\nput his nag back to foot space, and thus the much-diminished little\nparty slowly walked back to Acol Court.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLI\n\nTHEIR NAME\n\n\nWhat had prompted Editha de Chavasse to return thus alone to the\nQuakeress's cottage, she herself could not exactly have told.\n\nIt must have been a passionate and irresistible desire to heap certainty\nupon a tangle of horrible surmises.\n\nWith Adam Lambert lying dead--obviously murdered--and in the clothes\naffected by de Chavasse when masquerading as the French hero, there\ncould be only one conclusion. But this to Editha--who throughout had\ngiven a helping hand in the management of the monstrous comedy--was so\nawful a solution of the puzzle that she could not but recoil from it,\nand strive to deny it while she had one sane thought left in her madly\nwhirling brain.\n\nBut though she fought against the conclusion with all her might, she did\nnot succeed in driving it from her thoughts: and through it all there\nwas a vein of uncertainty, that slender thread of hope that after all\nshe might be the prey of some awful delusion, which a word from someone\nwho really knew would anon easily dissipate.\n\nSomeone who really knew? Nay! that someone could only be Marmaduke, and\nof him she dared not ask questions.\n\nMayhap that on the other hand the old woman and Richard Lambert knew\nmore than they had cared to say. Sue was indeed deeply absorbed in\nthoughts, walking with head bent and eyes fixed on the ground like a\nsomnambulist. Editha, moved by unreasoning instinct, determined to see\nthe Quakeress again, also the man who now lay dead, hoping that from him\nmayhap she might glean the real solution of that mystery which sooner or\nlater would undoubtedly drive her mad.\n\nRunning rapidly past horse and rider, for she would not speak to\nMarmaduke, she reached the cottage soon enough.\n\nIn response to her knock, Master Lambert opened the door to her.\n\nThe dim light of a couple of tallow candles flickered weirdly in the\ndraught. Editha looked around her in amazement, astonished that--like\nherself--Squire Boatfield had also evidently retraced his steps and was\nsitting now in one of the high-backed chairs beside the hearth, whilst\nthe old Quakeress stood not far from him, her attitude indicative of\nobstinacy, even of defiance, in the face of a duty with which apparently\nthe squire had been charging her.\n\nAt sight of Mistress de Chavasse, Boatfield rose. A look of annoyance\ncrossed his face, at thought that Editha's arrival had, mayhap,\nendangered the success of his present purpose. Ink and paper were on the\ntable close to his elbow, and it was obvious that he had been\nquestioning the old woman very closely on a subject which she\napparently desired to keep secret from him.\n\nMistress Lambert's attitude had also changed at sight of Editha, who\nstood for a moment undecided on the threshold ere she ventured within.\nThe look of obstinacy died out of the wrinkled face; the eyes took on a\nstrange expression of sullen wrath.\n\n\"Enter, my fine lady, I pray thee, enter,\" said the Quakeress; \"art also\na party to these cross-questionings? ... art anxious to probe the\nsecrets which the old woman hath kept hidden within the walls of this\ncottage?\"\n\nShe laughed, a low, chuckling laugh, mirthless and almost cruel, as she\nsurveyed Editha's cloaked figure and then the lady's scared and anxious\nface.\n\n\"Nay, I crave your pardon, mistress,\" said Editha, feeling oddly timid\nbefore the strange personality of the Quakeress. \"I would of a truth\ndesire to ask your help in ... in ... I would not intrude ... and I ...\"\n\n\"Nay! nay! prithee enter, fair mistress,\" rejoined Mistress Lambert\ndryly. \"Strange, that I should hear thy words so plainly.... Thy words\nseem to find echo in my brain ... raising memories which thou hast\nburied long ago.... Enter, I prithee, and sit thee down,\" she added,\nshuffling towards the chair; \"shut the door, Dick lad ... and ask this\nfair mistress to sit.... The squire is asking many questions ... mayhap\nthat I'll answer them, now that she is here....\"\n\nIn obedience to the quaint peremptoriness of her manner, Richard had\nclosed the outer door, and drawn the chair forward, asking Mistress de\nChavasse to sit. Squire Boatfield, who was visibly embarrassed, was\nstill standing and tried to murmur some excuse, being obviously anxious\nto curtail this interview and to postpone his further questionings.\n\n\"I'll come some other time, mistress,\" he said with obvious nervousness.\n\"Mistress de Chavasse desires to speak with you, and I'll return later\non in the evening ... when you are alone....\"\n\n\"Nay! nay, man! ...\" rejoined the Quakeress, \"prithee, sit again ... the\nevening is young yet ... and what I may tell thee now has something to\ndo with this fine lady here. Wilt question me again? I would mayhap\nreply.\"\n\nShe stood close to the table, one wrinkled hand resting upon it; the\nguttering candles cast strange, fantastic lights on her old face,\nsurmounted with the winged coif, and weird shadows down one side of her\nface. Editha, awed and subdued, gazed on her with a kind of fear, even\nof horror.\n\nIn a dark corner of the little room the straight outline of the long\ndeal box could only faintly be perceived in the gloom. Richard Lambert,\nsilent and oppressed, stood close beside it, his face in shadow, his\neyes fixed with a sense of inexplicable premonition on the face of\nEditha de Chavasse.\n\n\"Now, wilt question me again, man?\" asked the old Quakeress, turning to\nthe squire, \"the Lord hath willed that my ears be clear to-day. Wilt\nquestion me? ... I'll hear thee ... and I'll give answer to thy\nquestions....\"\n\n\"Nay, mistress,\" replied the squire, pointing to the ink and the paper\non the table, \"methought you would wish to see the murderer of your ...\nyour nephew ... swing on the gallows for his crime.... I would sign this\npaper here ordering the murderer of the smith of Acol to be apprehended\nas soon as found ... and to be brought forthwith before the magistrate\n... there to give an account of his doings.... I asked you then to give\nme the full Christian and surname of the man whom the neighborhood and I\nmyself thought was your nephew ... and to my surprise, you seemed to\nhesitate and ...\"\n\n\"And I'll hesitate no longer,\" she interposed firmly. \"Let the lad there\nask me his dead brother's name and I'll tell him.... I'll tell him ...\nif he asks ...\"\n\n\"Justice must be done against Adam's murderer, dear mistress,\" said\nRichard gently, for the old woman had paused and turned to him,\nevidently waiting for him to speak. \"My brother's real name, his\nparentage, might explain the motive which led an evildoer to commit such\nan appalling crime. Therefore, dear mistress, do I ask thee to tell us\nmy brother's name, and mine own.\"\n\n\"'Tis well done, lad ... 'tis well done,\" she rejoined when Richard had\nceased speaking, and silence had fallen for awhile on that tiny cottage\nparlor, \"'tis well done,\" she reiterated. \"The secret hath weighed\nheavily upon my old shoulders these past few years, since thou and Adam\nwere no longer children.... But I swore to thy grandmother who died in\nthe Lord, that thou and Adam should never hear of thy mother's\nwantonness and shame.... I swore it on her death-bed and I have kept my\noath ... but I am old now.... After this trouble, mine hour will surely\ncome.... I am prepared but I will not take thy secret, lad, with me into\nmy grave.\"\n\nShe shuffled across to the old oak dresser which occupied one wall of\nthe little room. Two pairs of glowing eyes followed her every movement;\nthose of Richard Lambert, who seemed to see a vision of his destiny\nfaintly outlined--still blurred--but slowly unfolding itself in the\ntangled web of fate; and then those of Editha, who even as the old woman\nspoke had felt a tidal wave of long-forgotten memories sweeping right\nover her senses. The look in the Quakeress's eyes, the words she\nuttered--though still obscure and enigmatical--had already told her the\nwhole truth. As in a flash she saw before her, her youth and all its\nfollies, the gay life of thoughtlessness and pleasures, the cradles of\nher children, the tiny boys who to the woman of fashion were but a\nhindrance and a burden.\n\nShe saw her own mother, rigid and dour, the counterpart of this same old\nPuritan who had not hesitated to part two children from their mother for\nover a score of years, any more than she hesitated now to fling insult\nupon insult on the wretched woman who had more than paid her debt to\nher own careless frivolity of long ago.\n\n\"Thy brother's name was Henry Adam de Chavasse, and thine Michael\nRichard de Chavasse, sons of Rowland de Chavasse, and of the wanton who\nwas his wife.\"\n\nThe old woman had taken a packet of papers, yellow with age and stained\nwith many tears, from out a secret drawer of the old oak dresser.\n\nHer voice was no longer tremulous as it was wont to be, but firm and\ndull, monotonous in tone like that of one who speaks whilst in a trance.\nSquire Boatfield had uttered an exclamation of boundless astonishment.\nMechanically he took the packet of papers from the Quakeress's hand and\nafter an instant's hesitation, and in response to an appealing look from\nRichard, he broke the string which held the documents together and\nperused them one by one.\n\nBut Editha, even as the last of the old woman's words ceased to echo in\nthe narrow room, had risen to her feet. Her heavy cloak glided off her\nshoulders down upon the ground; her eyes, preternaturally large, glowing\nand full of awe, were now fixed upon the young man--her son.\n\n\"De Chavasse,\" she murmured, her brain whirling, her heart filled not\nonly with an awful terror, but also with a great and overwhelming joy.\n\"My sons ... then I am ...\"\n\nBut with a peremptory gesture the Quakeress had stopped the word in her\nmouth.\n\n\"Nay!\" she said loudly, \"do not pollute that sacred name by letting it\npass through thy lips. Women such as thou were not made for\nmotherhood.... Thy own mother knew that, when she took thy children from\nthee and cursed thee on her death-bed for thy sins and for thy shame!\nThy sons were honest, God-fearing men, but 'tis no thanks to thee. Thou\nalone hast heaped shame upon their dead father's name and hast contrived\nto wreak ruin on the sons who knew thee not.\"\n\nThe Quakeress paused a moment, her pale opaque eyes lighted with an\ninward glow of wrath and of satisfied vengeance. She and her dead friend\nand all their co-religionists had hated the woman, who, in defiance of\nher own Puritanic upbringing, had cast aside her friends and her home in\norder to throw herself in that vortex of pleasure, which her mother\nconsidered evil and infamous.\n\nTogether they had all rejoiced over this woman's subsequent humiliation,\nher sorrow and longing for her children, the ceaseless search, the\never-recurrent disappointments. Now the Quakeress's hour had come, hers\nand that of the whole of the dour sect who had taken it upon itself to\npunish and to avenge.\n\nEditha, shamed and miserable, not even daring now to approach her own\nson and to beg for affection with a look, stood quite rigid and pale,\nallowing the torrent of the old woman's pent-up hatred to fall upon her\nand to crush her with its rough cruelty.\n\nSquire Boatfield would have interposed. He had glanced at the various\ndocuments--the proofs of what the old woman had asserted--and was\nsatisfied that the horrible tale of what seemed to him unparalleled\ncruelty was indeed true, and that the narrow bigotry of a community had\nsucceeded in performing that monstrous crime of parting this wretched\nwoman for twenty years from her sons.\n\nVaguely in his mind, the kindly squire hoped that he--as\nmagistrate--could fitly punish this crime of child-stealing, and the\nexpression with which he now regarded the old Quakeress was certainly\nnot one of good-will.\n\nMistress Lambert had, in the meanwhile, approached Editha. She now took\nthe younger woman's hand in hers and dragged her towards the coffin.\n\n\"There lies one of thy sons,\" she said with the same relentless energy,\n\"the eldest, who should have been thy pride, murdered in a dark spot by\nsome skulking criminal.... Curse thee! ... curse thee, I say ... as thy\nmother cursed thee on her death-bed ... curse thee now that retribution\nhas come at last!\"\n\nHer words died away, as some mournful echo against these whitewashed\nwalls.\n\nFor a moment she stood wrathful and defiant, upright and stern like a\njusticiary between the dead son and the miserable woman, who of a truth\nwas suffering almost unendurable agony of mind and of heart.\n\nThen in the midst of the awesome silence that followed on that loudly\nspoken curse, there was the sound of a firm footstep on the rough deal\nfloor, and the next moment Michael Richard de Chavasse was kneeling\nbeside his mother, and covering her icy cold hand with kisses.\n\nA heart-broken moan escaped her throat. She stooped and with trembling\nlips gently touched the young head bent in simple love and uninquiring\nreverence before her.\n\nThen without a word, without a look cast either at her cruel enemy, or\nat the silent spectator of this terrible drama, she turned and ran\nrapidly out of the room, out into the dark and dismal night.\n\nWith a deep sigh of content, Mistress Lambert fell on her knees and\nthence upon the floor.\n\nThe old heart which had contained so much love and so much hatred, such\nstern self-sacrifice and such deadly revenge, had ceased to beat, now\nthe worker's work was done.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLII\n\nTHE RETURN\n\n\nMaster Courage Toogood had long ago given up all thought of waiting for\nthe mistress. He had knocked repeatedly at the door of the cottage, from\nbehind the thick panels of which he had heard loud and--he\nthought--angry voices, speaking words which he could not, however, quite\nunderstand.\n\nNo answer had come to his knocking and tired with the excitement of the\nday, fearful, too, at the thought of the lonely walk which now awaited\nhim, he chose to believe that mayhap he had either misunderstood his\nmaster's orders, or that Sir Marmaduke himself had been mistaken when he\nthought the mistress back at the cottage.\n\nThese surmises were vastly to Master Courage Toogood's liking, whose\nname somewhat belied his timid personality. Swinging his lantern and\nstriving to keep up his spirits by the aid of a lusty song, he\nresolutely turned his steps towards home.\n\nThe whole landscape seemed filled with eeriness: the events of the day\nhad left their impress on this dark November night, causing the sighs of\nthe gale to seem more spectral and weird than usual, and the dim outline\nof the trees with their branches turned away from the coastline, to\nseem like unhappy spirits with thin, gaunt arms stretched dejectedly out\ntoward the unresponsive distance.\n\nMaster Toogood tried not to think of ghosts, nor of the many stories of\npixies and goblins which are said to take a malicious pleasure in the\ntimorousness of mankind, but of a truth he nearly uttered a cry of\nterror, and would have fallen on his knees in the mud, when a dark\nobject quite undistinguishable in the gloom suddenly loomed before him.\n\nYet this was only the portly figure of Master Pyot, the petty constable,\nwho seemed to be mounting guard just outside the cottage, and who was\nvastly amused at Toogood's pusillanimity. He entered into converse with\nthe young man--no doubt he, too, had been feeling somewhat lonely in the\nmidst of this darkness, which was peopled with unseen shadows. Master\nCourage was ready enough to talk. He had acquired some of Master Busy's\neloquence on the subject of secret investigations, and the mystery which\nhad gained an intensity this afternoon, through the revelations of the\nold Quakeress, was an all-engrossing one to all.\n\nThe attention which Pyot vouchsafed to his narration greatly enhanced\nMaster Toogood's own delight therein, more especially as the petty\nconstable had, as if instinctively, measured his steps with those of the\nyounger man and was accompanying him on his way towards the Court.\n\nCourage told his attentive listener all about Master Busy's surmises and\nhis determination to probe the secrets of the mysterious crime,\nwhich--to be quite truthful--the worthy butler with the hard toes had\nscented long ere it was committed, seeing that he used to spend long\nhours in vast discomfort in the forked branches of the old elms which\nsurrounded the pavilion at the boundary of the park.\n\nToogood had no notion if Master Busy had ever discovered anything of\ninterest in the neighborhood of that pavilion, and he was quite, quite\nsure that the saintly man had never dared to venture inside that archaic\nbuilding, which had the reputation of being haunted; still, he was\nover-gratified to perceive that the petty constable was vastly\ninterested in his tale--in spite of these obvious defects in its\ncompleteness--and that, moreover, Master Pyot showed no signs of turning\non his heel, but continued to trudge along the gloomy road in company\nwith Sir Marmaduke's youngest serving-man.\n\nThus Editha, when she ran out of Mistress Lambert's cottage, her ears\nringing with the fanatic's curses, her heart breaking with the joy of\nthat reverent filial kiss imprinted upon her hands, found the road and\nthe precincts of the cottage entirely deserted.\n\nThe night was pitch dark after the rain. Great heavy clouds still hung\nabove, and an icy blast caught her skirts as she lifted the latch of the\ngate and turned into the open.\n\nBut she cared little about the inclemency of the weather. She knew her\nway about well enough and her mind was too full of terrible thoughts of\nwhat was real, to yield to the subtle and feeble fears engendered by\nimaginings of the supernatural.\n\nNay! she would, mayhap, have welcomed the pixies and goblins who by\nmischievous pranks had claimed her attention. They would, of a truth,\nhave diverted her mind from the contemplation of that awful and\nmonstrous deed accomplished by the man whom she would meet anon.\n\nIf he whom the villagers had called Adam Lambert was her son, Henry Adam\nde Chavasse, then Sir Marmaduke was the murderer of her child. All the\ncurses which the old Quakeress had so vengefully poured upon her were as\nnothing compared with that awful, that terrible fact.\n\nHer son had been murdered ... her eldest son whom she had never known,\nand she--involuntarily mayhap, compulsorily certes--had in a measure\nhelped to bring about those events which had culminated in that\nappalling crime.\n\nShe had known of Marmaduke's monstrous fraud on the confiding girl whom\nhe now so callously abandoned to her fate. She had known of it and\nhelped him towards its success by luring her other son Richard to that\nvile gambling den where he had all but lost his honor, or else his\nreason.\n\nThis knowledge and the help she had given was the real curse upon her\nnow: a curse far more horrible and deadly than that which had driven\nCain forth into the wilderness. This knowledge and the help she had\ngiven had stained her hands with the blood of her own child.\n\nNo wonder that she sighed for ghouls and for shadowy monsters,\nwell-nigh longing for a sight of distorted faces, of ugly deformed\nbodies, and loathsome shapes far less hideous than that specter of an\ninhuman homicide which followed her along this dark road as she ran--ran\non--ran towards the home where dwelt the living monster of evil, the man\nwho had done the deed, which she had helped to accomplish.\n\nComplete darkness reigned all around her, she could not see a yard of\nthe road in front of her, but she went on blindly, guided by instinct,\nled by that unseen shadow which was driving her on. All round her the\ngale was moaning in the creaking branches of the trees, branches which\nwere like arms stretched forth in appeal towards the unattainable.\n\nHer progress was slow for she was walking in the very teeth of the\nhurricane, and her shoes ever and anon remained glued to the slimy mud.\nBut the road was straight enough, she knew it well, and she felt neither\nfatigue nor discomfort.\n\nOf Sue she did not think. The wrongs done to the defenseless girl were\nas nothing to her compared with the irreparable--the wrongs done to her\nsons, the living and the dead: for the one the foul dagger of an inhuman\nassassin, for the other shame and disgrace.\n\nSue was young. Sue would soon forget. The girl-wife would soon regain\nher freedom.... But what of the mother who had on her soul the taint of\nthe murder of her child?\n\nThe gate leading to the Court from the road was wide open: it had been\nleft so for her, no doubt, when Sir Marmaduke returned. The house itself\nwas dark, no light save one pierced the interstices of the ill-fitting\nshutters. Editha paused a moment at the gate, looking at the house--a\ngreat black mass, blacker than the surrounding gloom. That had been her\nhome for many years now, ever since her youth and sprightliness had\nvanished, and she had had nowhere to go for shelter. It had been her\nhome ever since Richard, her youngest boy, had entered it, too, as a\ndependent.\n\nOh! what an immeasurable fool she had been, how she had been tricked and\nfooled all these years by the man who two days ago had put a crown upon\nhis own infamy. He knew where the boys were, he helped to keep them away\nfrom their mother, so as to filch from them their present, and above\nall, future inheritance. How she loathed him now, and loathed herself\nfor having allowed him to drag her down. Aye! of a truth he had wronged\nher worse even than he had wronged his brother's sons!\n\nShe fixed her eyes steadily on the one light which alone pierced the\ninky blackness of the solid mass of the house. It came from the little\nwithdrawing-room, which was on the left of this entrance to the hall;\nbut the place itself--beyond just that one tiny light--appeared quite\nsilent and deserted. Even from the stableyard on her right and from the\nserving-men's quarters not a sound came to mingle with the weird\nwhisperings of the wind.\n\nEditha approached and stooping to the ground, she groped in the mud\nuntil her hands encountered two or three pebbles.\n\nShe picked them up, then going close to the house, she threw these\npebbles one by one against the half-closed shutter of the\nwithdrawing-room.\n\nThe next moment, she heard the latch of the casement window being lifted\nfrom within, and anon the rickety shutter flew back with a thin creaking\nsound like that of an animal in pain.\n\nThe upper part of Sir Marmaduke's figure appeared in the window\nembrasure, like a dark and massive silhouette against the yellowish\nlight from within. He stooped forward, seeming to peer into the\ndarkness.\n\n\"Is that you, Editha?\" he queried presently.\n\n\"Yes,\" she replied. \"Open!\"\n\nShe then waited a moment or two, whilst he closed both the shutter and\nthe window, she standing the while on the stone step before the portico.\nIn the stillness she could hear him open the drawing-room door, then\ncross the hall and finally unbolt the heavy outer door.\n\nShe pushed past him over the threshold and went into the gloomy hall,\npitch dark save for the flickering light of the candle which he held.\nShe waited until he had re-closed the door, then she stood quite still,\nconfronting him, allowing him to look into her face, to read the\nexpression of her eyes.\n\nIn order to do this he had raised the candle, his hand trembling\nperceptibly, and the feeble light quivered in his grasp, illumining her\nface at fitful intervals, creeping down her rigid shoulders and arms, as\nfar as her hands, which were tightly clenched. It danced upon his face\ntoo, lighting it with weird gleams and fitful sparks, showing the wild\nlook in his eyes, the glitter almost of madness in the dilated pupils,\nthe dark iris sharply outlined against the glassy orbs. It licked the\ntrembling lips and distorted mouth, the drawn nostrils and dank hair,\nalmost alive with that nameless fear.\n\n\"You would denounce me?\" he murmured, and the cry--choked and\ntoneless--could scarce rise from the dry parched throat.\n\n\"Yes!\" she said.\n\nHe uttered a violent curse.\n\n\"You devil ... you ...\"\n\n\"You have time to go,\" she said calmly, \"'tis a long while 'twixt now\nand dawn.\"\n\nHe understood. She only would denounce him if he stayed. She wished him\nno evil, only desired him out of her sight. He tried to say something\nflippant, something cruel and sneering, but she stopped him with a\nperemptory gesture.\n\n\"Go!\" she said, \"or I might forget everything save that you killed my\nson.\"\n\nFor a moment she thought that her life was in danger at his hands, so\nawful in its baffled rage was the expression of his face when he\nunderstood that indeed she knew everything. She even at that moment\nlonged that his cruel instincts should prompt him to kill her. He could\nnever succeed in hiding that crime and retributive justice would of a\nsurety overtake him then, without any help from her.\n\nNo doubt he, too, thought of this as the weird flicker of the\ncandle-light showed him her unflinching face, for the next moment, with\nanother muttered curse, and a careless shrug of the shoulders, he turned\non his heel, and slowly went upstairs, candle in hand.\n\nEditha watched him until his massive figure was merged in the gloom of\nthe heavy oak stairway. Then she went into the withdrawing-room and\nwaited.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLIII\n\nTHE SANDS OF EPPLE\n\n\nFive minutes later Sir Marmaduke de Chavasse, clad in thick dark doublet\nand breeches and wearing a heavy cloak, once more descended the stairs\nof Acol Court. He saw the light in the withdrawing-room and knew that\nEditha was there, mutely watching his departure.\n\nBut he did not care to speak to her again. His mind had been quickly\nmade up, nay! his actions in the immediate future should of a truth have\nbeen accomplished two days ago, ere the meddlesomeness of women had\nwell-nigh jeopardized his own safety.\n\nAll that he meant to do now was to go quickly to the pavilion, find the\nleather wallet then return to his own stableyard, saddle one of his nags\nand start forthwith for Dover. Eighteen miles would soon be covered, and\nthough the night was dark, the road was straight and broad. De Chavasse\nknew it well, and had little fear of losing his way.\n\nWith plenty of money in his purse, he would have no difficulty in\nchartering a boat which, with a favorable tide on the morrow, should\nsoon take him over to France.\n\nAll that he ought to have done two days ago! Of a truth, he had been a\ncowardly fool.\n\nHe did not cross the hall this time but went out through the\ndining-room by the garden entrance. Not a glimmer of light came from\nabove, but as he descended the few stone steps he felt that a few soft\nflakes of snow tossed by the hurricane were beginning to fall. Of course\nhe knew every inch of his own garden and park and had oft wandered about\non the further side of the ha-ha whilst indulging in lengthy\nsweetly-spoken farewells with his love-sick Sue.\n\nAbsorbed in the thoughts of his immediate future plans, he nevertheless\nwalked along cautiously, for the paths had become slippery with the\nsnow, which froze quickly even as it fell.\n\nHe did not pause, however, for he wished to lose no time. If he was to\nride to Dover this night, he would have to go at foot-pace, for the road\nwould be like glass if this snow and ice continued. Moreover, he was\nburning to feel that wallet once more between his fingers and to hear\nthe welcome sound of the crushing of crisp papers.\n\nHe had plunged resolutely into the thickness of the wood. Here he could\nhave gone blindfolded, so oft had he trodden this path which leads under\nthe overhanging elms straight to the pavilion, walking with Sue's little\nhand held tightly clasped in his own.\n\nThe spiritual presence of the young girl seemed even now to pervade the\nthicket, her sweet fragrance to fill the frost-laden air.\n\nBah! he was not the man to indulge in retrospective fancy. The girl was\nnaught to him, and there was no sense of remorse in his soul for the\nterrible wrongs which he had inflicted on her. All that he thought of\nnow was the wallet which contained the fortune. That which would forever\ncompensate him for the agony, the madness of the past two days.\n\nThe bend behind that last group of elms should now reveal the outline of\nthe pavilion. Sir Marmaduke advanced more cautiously, for the trees here\nwere very close together.\n\nThe next moment he had paused, crouching suddenly like a carnivorous\nbeast, balked of its prey. There of a truth was the pavilion, but on the\nsteps three men were standing, talking volubly and in whispers. Two of\nthese men carried stable lanterns, and were obviously guiding their\ncompanion up to the door of the pavilion.\n\nThe light of the lanterns illumined one face after another. De Chavasse\nrecognized his two serving-men, Busy and Toogood; the man who was with\nthem was petty-constable Pyot. Marmaduke with both hands clutching the\nivy which clung round the gnarled stem of an old elm, watched from out\nthe darkness what these three men were doing here, beside this pavilion,\nwhich had always been so lonely and deserted.\n\nHe could not distinguish what they said for they spoke in whispers and\nthe creaking branches groaning beneath the wind drowned every sound\nwhich came from the direction of the pavilion and the listener on the\nwatch, straining his every sense in order to hear, dared not creep any\ncloser lest he be perceived.\n\nAnon, the three men examined the door of the pavilion, and shaking the\nrusty bolts, found that they would not yield. But evidently they were of\nset purpose, for the next moment all three put their shoulder to the\nworm-eaten woodwork, and after the third vigorous effort the door\nyielded to their assault.\n\nMen and lanterns disappeared within the pavilion. Sir Marmaduke heard an\nejaculation of surprise, then one of profound satisfaction.\n\nFor the space of a few seconds he remained rooted to the spot. It almost\nseemed to him as if with the knowledge that the wallet and the discarded\nclothes of the smith had been found, with the certitude that this\ndiscovery meant his own undoing probably, and in any case the final loss\nof the fortune for which he had plotted and planned, lied and\nmasqueraded, killed a man and cheated a girl, that with the knowledge of\nall this, death descended upon him: so cold did he feel, so unable was\nhe to make the slightest movement.\n\nBut this numbness only lasted a few seconds. Obviously the three men\nwould return in a minute or so; equally obviously his own presence\nhere--if discovered--would mean certain ruin to him. Even while he was\nmaking the effort to collect his scattered senses and to move from this\nfateful and dangerous spot, he saw the three men reappear in the\ndoorway of the pavilion.\n\nThe breeches and rough shirt of the smith hung over the arm of\nHymn-of-Praise Busy; the dark stain on the shirt was plainly visible by\nthe light of one of the lanterns.\n\nPetty constable Pyot had the leather wallet in his hand, and was peeping\ndown with grave curiosity at the bundle of papers which it contained.\n\nThen with infinite caution, Marmaduke de Chavasse worked his way between\nthe trees towards the old wall which encircled his park. The three men\nobviously would be going back either to Acol Court, or mayhap, straight\nto the village.\n\nSir Marmaduke knew of a gap in the wall which it was quite easy to\nclimb, even in the dark; a path through the thicket at that point led\nstraight out towards the coast.\n\nHe had struck that path from the road on the night when he met the smith\non the cliffs.\n\nThe snow only penetrated in sparse flakes to the thicket here. Although\nthe branches of the trees were dead, they interlaced so closely overhead\nthat they formed ample protection against the wet.\n\nBut the fury of the gale seemed terrific amongst these trees and the\ngroaning of the branches seemed like weird cries proceeding from hell.\n\nAnon, the midnight walker reached the open. Here a carpet of coarse\ngrass peeping through the thin layer of snow gave insecure foothold. He\nstumbled as he pursued his way. He was walking in the teeth of the\nnorthwesterly blast now and he could scarcely breathe, for the great\ngusts caught his throat, causing him to choke.\n\nStill he walked resolutely on. Icy moisture clung to his hair, and to\nhis lips, and soon he could taste the brine in the air. The sound of the\nbreakers some ninety feet below mingled weirdly with the groans of the\nwind.\n\nHe knew the path well. Had he not trodden it three nights ago, on his\nway to meet the smith? Already in the gloom he could distinguish the\nbroken line of the cliffs sharply defined against the gray density of\nthe horizon.\n\nAs he drew nearer the roar of the breakers became almost deafening. A\nheavy sea was rolling in on the breast of the tide.\n\nStill he walked along, towards the brow of the cliffs. Soon he could\ndistinguish the irregular heap of chalk against which Adam had stood,\nwhilst he had held the lantern in one hand and gripped the knife in the\nother.\n\nThe hurricane nearly swept him off his feet. He had much ado to steady\nhimself against that heap of chalk. The snow had covered his cloak and\nhis hat, and he liked to think that he, too, now--snow-covered--must\nlook like a monstrous chalk boulder, weird and motionless outlined\nagainst the leaden grayness of the ocean beyond.\n\nThe smith was not by his side now. There was no lantern, no paper, no\ndouble-edged dagger. Down nearly a hundred feet below the smith had lain\nuntil the turn of the tide. The man's eyes, becoming accustomed to the\ngloom, could distinguish the points of the great boulders springing\nboldly from out the sand. The surf as it broke all round and over them\nwas tipped with a phosphorescent light.\n\nThe gale, in sheer wantonness, caught the midnight prowler's hat and\nwith a wild sound as of the detonation of a hundred guns, tossed it to\nthe waves below. The snow in a few moments had thrown a white pall over\nthe watcher's head.\n\nHe could see quite clearly the tall boulder untouched by the tide, on\nwhich he had placed the black silk shade that night, also the\nbroad-brimmed hat, so that these things should be found high and dry and\nbe easily recognizable.\n\nSome twenty feet further on was the smooth stretch of sand where had\nlain the smith, after he had been dressed up in the fantastic clothes of\nthe mysterious French prince.\n\nMarmaduke de Chavasse gazed upon that spot. The breakers licked it now\nand again, leaving behind them as they retreated a track of slimy foam,\nwhich showed white in this strange gray gloom, rendered alive and moving\nby the falling snow.\n\nThe surf covered that stretch of sand more and more frequently now, and\nretreated less and less far: the slimy foam floated now over an inky\npool; soon that too disappeared. The breakers sought other boulders\nround which to play their titanic hide-and-seek. The tide had\ncompletely hidden the place where Adam Lambert had lain.\n\nThen the watcher walked on--one step and then another--and then the one\nbeyond the edge as he stepped down, down into the abyss ninety feet\nbelow.\n\n\n\n\nTHE EPILOGUE\n\n\nThe chronicles of the time tell us that the mysterious disappearance of\nSir Marmaduke de Chavasse was but a nine days' wonder in that great\nworld which lies beyond the boundaries of sea-girt Thanet.\n\nWhat Thanet thought of it all, the little island kept secret, hiding its\nsurmises in the thicket of her own archaic forests.\n\nSquire Boatfield did his best to wrap the disappearance of his whilom\nfriend in impenetrable veils of mystery. He was a humane and a kindly\nman and feeling that the guilty had been amply punished, he set to work\nto cheer and to rehabilitate the innocent.\n\nAll of us who have read the memoirs of Editha de Chavasse, written when\nshe was a woman of nearly sixty, remember that she, too, has drawn a\nthick curtain over the latter days of her brother-in-law's life. It is\nto her pen that we owe the record of what happened subsequently.\n\nShe tells us, for instance, how Master Skyffington, after sundry\ninterviews with my Lord Northallerton, had the honor of bringing to his\nlordship's notice the young student--so long known as Richard\nLambert--who, of a truth, was sole heir to the earldom and to its\nmagnificent possessions and dependencies.\n\nFrom the memoirs of Editha de Chavasse we also know that Lady Sue\nAldmarshe, girl-wife and widow, did, after a period of mourning, marry\nMichael Richard de Chavasse, sole surviving nephew and heir presumptive\nof his lordship the Earl of Northallerton.\n\nBut it is to the brush of Sir Peter Lely that we owe that exquisite\nportrait of Sue, when she was Countess of Northallerton, the friend of\nQueen Catherine, the acknowledged beauty at the Court of the\nRestoration.\n\nIt is a sweet face, whereon the half-obliterated lines of sorrow vie\nwith that look of supreme happiness which first crept into her eyes when\nshe realized that the dear and constant friend who had loved her so\ndearly, was as true to her in his joy as he had been in those dark days\nwhen a terrible crisis had well-nigh wrecked her life.\n\nLord and Lady Northallerton did not often stay in London. The brilliance\nof the Court had few attractions for them. Happiness came to them after\nterrible sorrows. They liked to hide it and their great love in the calm\nand mystery of forest-covered Thanet.\n\n\nTHE END\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's The Nest of the Sparrowhawk, by Baroness Orczy\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE NEST OF THE SPARROWHAWK ***\n\n***** This file should be named 12175-8.txt or 12175-8.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\/1\/2\/1\/7\/12175\/\n\nProduced by Steven desJardins and Distributed Proofreaders\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http:\/\/www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp:\/\/pglaf.org\/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at\n809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email\nbusiness@pglaf.org.  Email contact links and up to date contact\ninformation can be found at the Foundation's web site and official\npage at http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nFor additional contact information:\n     Dr. Gregory B. Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http:\/\/pglaf.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\nEach eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's\neBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,\ncompressed (zipped), HTML and others.\n\nCorrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over\nthe old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.\nVERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving\nnew filenames and etext numbers.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n\nEBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,\nare filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to\ndownload any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular\nsearch system you may utilize the following addresses and just\ndownload by the etext year.\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\/etext06\n\n    (Or \/etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,\n     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)\n\nEBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are\nfiled in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part\nof the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is\nidentical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single\ndigits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For\nexample an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\/1\/0\/2\/3\/10234\n\nor filename 24689 would be found at:\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\/2\/4\/6\/8\/24689\n\nAn alternative method of locating eBooks:\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\/GUTINDEX.ALL\n\n","id":1076,"split":"train"}
