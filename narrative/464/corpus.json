{"ori_id":"6bdca41d52b739bac71883b99a5a49c9c4afb05a","title":"Fair Em","context":"Fair Em\n In the main plot, William the Conqueror falls in love with the image on the shield that the Marquess of Lubeck carries in a tournament. In disguise, William travels to the court of King Zweno of Denmark to see the original of the portrait; once there, he falls in love with Marianna, a Swedish princess held hostage at the Danish court. Marianna, however, is faithful to her suitor, Lubeck, and has no interest in William; but the king's daughter Blanche becomes infatuated with the newcomer. The ladies stage a plot, in which William absconds with the woman he thinks is Marianne; in doing so he gets in trouble with Zweno, who is under the same mistaken impression. When the woman's true identity is revealed \u00e2\u0080\u0093 she is of course Blanche \u00e2\u0080\u0093 William accepts her as his wife. Lubeck and Marianne are left, happily, to each other.\nIn the subplot, Em, the beautiful daughter of the miller of Manchester, is wooed by three suitors, Valingford, Mountney, and Manvile. Preferring Manvile, she pretends blindness to evade Valingford, and deafness to avoid Mountney. But Manvile proves unfaithful to Em. In the end, Manvile loses both of the women he pursues, and Em marries Valingford, the one of the three who has remained true to her; and it is revealed that Em is actually of the gentry \u00e2\u0080\u0093 her father is Sir Thomas Goddard, and the miller of Manchester was his disguise. The two plots meet at the end, as William recognizes Goddard's banishment was unjust and revokes it. Em makes William realize that the world does contain virtuous women, which helps to reconcile him to his marriage with Blanche.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg EBook of Fair Em, by William Shakespeare (Apocrypha)\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

We will presently take horse and away.\n\n     VALINGFORD.\n     If it please you to go in, I'll follow you presently.\n\n     [Exit Elner and her father.]\n\n     Now shall I be revenged on Manville, and by this means get\n     Em to my wife; and therefore I will straight to her fathers\n     and inform them both of all that is happened.\n\n     [Exit.]\n\n\n     SCENE II.\n\n     The English Court.\n\n     [Enter William, the Ambassador of Denmark, Demarch, and\n     other attendants.]\n\n\n     WILLIAM.\n     What news with the Denmark Embassador?\n\n     EMBASSADOR.\n     Marry, thus:\n     The King of Denmark and my Sovereign\n     Doth send to know of thee what is the cause\n     That injuriously, against the law of arms,\n     Thou hast stolen away his only daughter Blaunch,\n     The only stay and comfort of his life.\n     Therefore by me\n     He willeth thee to send his daughter Blaunch,\n     Or else foorthwith he will levy such an host,\n     As soon shall fetch her in dispite of thee.\n\n     WILLIAM.\n     Embassador, this answer I return thy King.\n     He willeth me to send his daughter Blaunch,\n     Saying, I conveyed her from the Danish court,\n     That never yet did once as think thereof.\n     As for his menacing and daunting threats,\n     I nill regard him nor his Danish power;\n     For if he come to fetch her foorth my Realm\n     I will provide him such a banquet here,\n     That he shall have small cause to give me thanks.\n\n     EMBASSADOR.\n     Is this your answer, then?\n\n     WILLIAM.\n     It is; and so begone.\n\n     EMBASSADOR.\n     I go; but to your cost.\n\n     [Exit Embassador.]\n\n     WILLIAM.\n     Demarch, our subjects, earst levied in civil broils,\n     Muster foorthwith, for to defend the Realm.\n     In hope whereof, that we shall find you true,\n     We freely pardon this thy late offence.\n\n     DEMARCH.\n     Most humble thanks I render to your grace.\n\n     [Exeunt.]\n\n\n     SCENE III.\n\n     Manchester.  The Mill.\n\n     [Enter the Miller and Valingford.]\n\n\n     MILLER.\n     Alas, gentleman, why should you trouble your self so much,\n     considering the imperfections of my daughter, which is able\n     to with-draw the love of any man from her, as already it\n     hath done in her first choice.  Maister Manville hath\n     forsaken her, and at Chester shall be married to a mans\n     daughter of no little wealth.  But if my daughter knew so\n     much, it would go very near her heart, I fear me.\n\n     VALINGFORD.\n     Father miller, such is the entire affection to your daughter,\n     as no misfortune whatsoever can alter.  My fellow Mountney,\n     thou seest, gave quickly over; but I, by reason of my good\n     meaning, am not so soon to be changed, although I am borne\n     off with scorns and denial.\n\n     [Enter Em to them.]\n\n     MILLER.\n     Trust me, sir, I know not what to say.  My daughter is not\n     to be compelled by me; but here she comes her self: speak\n     to her and spare not, for I never was troubled with love\n     matters so much before.\n\n     EM.\n     [Aside.]  Good Lord! shall I never be rid of this importunate\n     man?  Now must I dissemble blindness again.  Once more for\n     thy sake, Manville, thus am I inforced, because I shall\n     complete my full resolved mind to thee.  Father, where are\n     you?\n\n     MILLER.\n     Here, sweet Em.  Answer this gentleman, that would so fayne\n     enjoy thy love.\n\n     EM.\n     Where are you, sir? will you never leave this idle and vain\n     pursuit of love?  Is not England stord enough to content you,\n     but you must still trouble the poor contemptible maid of\n     Manchester?\n\n     VALINGFORD.\n     None can content me but the fair maid of Manchester.\n\n     EM.\n     I perceive love is vainly described, that, being blind\n     himself, would have you likewise troubled with a blind wife,\n     having the benefit of your eyes.  But neither follow him so\n     much in folly, but love one in whom you may better delight.\n\n     VALINGFORD.\n     Father Miller, thy daughter shall have honor by graunting me\n     her love.  I am a Gentleman of king Williams Court, and no\n     mean man in king Williams favour.\n\n     EM.\n     If you be a Lord, sir, as you say, you offer both your self\n     and me great wrong:  yours, as apparent, in limiting your\n     love so unorderly, for which you rashly endure reprochement;\n     mine, as open and evident, when, being shut from the vanities\n     of this world, you would have me as an open gazing stock to\n     all the world; for lust, not love, leads you into this error.\n     But from the one I will keep me as well as I can, and yield\n     the other to none but to my father, as I am bound by duty.\n\n     VALINGFORD.\n     Why, fair Em, Manville hath forsaken thee, and must at\n     Chester be married: which if I speak otherwise than true,\n     let thy father speak what credibly he hath heard.\n\n     EM.\n     But can it be Manville will deal so unkindly to reward my\n     justice with such monstrous ungentleness?  Have I dissembled\n     for thy sake, and doest thou now thus requite it?  In deed\n     these many days I have not seen him, which hath made me\n     marvel at his long absence.  But, father, are you assured\n     of the words he spake were concerning Manville?\n\n     MILLER.\n     In sooth, daughter, now it is foorth I must needs confirm\n     it:  Maister Manville hath forsaken thee, and at Chester\n     must be married to a mans daughter of no little wealth.\n     His own father procures it, and therefore I dare credit\n     it; and do thou believe it, for trust me, daughter, it is so.\n\n     EM.\n     Then, good father, pardon the injury that I have done to\n     you, only causing your grief, by over-fond affecting a man\n     so trothless.  And you likewise, sir, I pray hold me\n     excused, a I hope this cause will allow sufficiently for\n     me:  My love to Manville, thinking he would requite it,\n     hath made me double with my father and you, and many more\n     besides, which I will no longer hide from you.  That\n     inticing speeches should not beguile me, I have made my\n     self deaf to any but to him; and lest any mans person\n     should please me more than his, I have dissembled the want\n     of sight:  Both which shadows of my irrevocable affections\n     I have not spared to confirm before him, my father, and all\n     other amorous soliciters--wherewith not made acquainted, I\n     perceive my true intent hath wrought mine own sorrow, and\n     seeking by love to be regarded, am cut of with contempt, and\n     dispised.\n\n     MILLER.\n     Tell me, sweet Em, hast thou but fained all this while for\n     his love, that hath so descourteously forsaken thee?\n\n     EM.\n     Credit me, father, I have told you the troth; wherewith I\n     desire you and Lord Valingford not to be displeased.  For\n     ought else I shall say, let my present grief hold me excused.\n     But, may I live to see that ungrateful man justly rewarded\n     for his treachery, poor Em would think her self not a little\n     happy.  Favour my departing at this instant; for my troubled\n     thought desires to meditate alone in silence.\n\n     [Exit Em.]\n\n     VALINGFORD.\n     Will not Em shew one cheerful look on Valingford?\n\n     MILLER.\n     Alas, sir, blame her not; you see she hath good cause, being\n     so handled by this gentleman:  And so I'll leave you, and go\n     comfort my poor wench as well as I may.\n\n     [Exit the Miller.]\n\n     VALINGFORD.\n     Farewell, good father.\n\n     [Exit Valingford.]\n\n\n\n\nACT V.\n\n     SCENE I.\n\n     Open country in England.\n\n     [Enter Zweno, king of Denmark, with Rosilio and other\n     attendants.]\n\n\n     ZWENO.\n     Rosilio, is this the place whereas the Duke William should\n     meet me?\n\n     ROSILIO.\n     It is, and like your grace.\n\n     ZWENO.\n     Go, captain!

In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http:\/\/www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.

The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp:\/\/pglaf.org\/fundraising.

Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http:\/\/pglaf.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":464,"split":"train"}
