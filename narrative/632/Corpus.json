Timmy Tiptoes is \"a little fat comfortable grey squirrel\" living in a nest thatched with leaves in the top of a tall tree with his little wife, Goody. Over the course of several days, the two collect nuts in their little sacks for the coming winter and spring, and store the nuts in hollow tree stumps near their home. Timmy wears a red jacket he removes while working, and his wife wears a pink dress and apron. When the stumps are full, the couple make use of a tree-hole that once belonged to a woodpecker. The nuts rattle \"down \u2013 down \u2013 down inside\", and Goody wonders how they will ever retrieve them. Timmy reminds her he will be much thinner by springtime and will be able to pass through the little hole.\nIn an aside, the narrator tells the reader that the couple had great quantities of nuts because they never lost them, noting that most squirrels lose half their nuts because they cannot remember where they buried them. Silvertail is the most forgetful of squirrels in the wood, and, while trying to find his nuts, digs up another squirrel's hoard. A commotion erupts among the nutting squirrels, and, as ill luck would have it, a flock of birds fly by singing \"Who's bin  [sic] digging-up my nuts?\" and \"Little bit-a-bread and-no-cheese!\" One bird finds a perch in the bush where Timmy is working and continues to sing about digging up nuts. The other squirrels take notice, suspect Timmy of robbing others of their hoards, rush upon him, scratch and cuff him, chase him up a tree, and stuff him with great difficulty through the woodpecker's hole. Silvertail suggests they leave him there until he confesses.\nTimmy lays \"stunned and still\" on the peck of nuts he has stored in the hollow tree while Goody searches fruitlessly for him. Eventually, Timmy stirs and discovers himself in a mossy little bed surrounded by ample provisions. Chippy Hackee, a small striped chipmunk, tends him with kindness, mentioning that it has been raining nuts through the top of tree and he has also \"found a few buried\". The chipmunk coaxes Timmy to eat the nuts and Timmy grows \"fatter and fatter!\"\nGoody is very concerned about her husband's disappearance, but has gone back to work collecting nuts and hiding them under a tree root. Mrs. Hackee, Chippy's wife, emerges from beneath the root to demand an explanation regarding the shower of nuts into her home. Eventually, the two ladies complain about their runaway husbands, but the chipmunk knows where her husband is camping-out because a little bird has told her. Together, they hurry to the woodpecker's hole and hear their husbands deep within the tree singing:\n\"My little old man and I fell out,\nHow shall we bring this matter about?\nBring it about as well as you can,\nAnd get you gone, you little old man!\"\nMrs. Hackee refuses to enter the tree because her husband bites, but Goody calls to her husband and he comes to the hole with a kiss for her. He is too fat to squeeze through the hole, but Chippy Hackee (who is not too fat) refuses to leave and remains below chuckling. A fortnight later, a big wind blows off the top of the tree, and Timmy makes his escape. He hurries home through the rain, huddling under an umbrella with his wife.\nChippy Hackee continues to camp-out in the tree stump for another week, but a bear comes lumbering through the neighbourhood (looking for nuts perhaps?) and Chippy decides it's time to hurry home. He suffers a cold in his head and is quite uncomfortable. Timmy now keeps the family nuts \"fastened up with a little padlock\", and Goody is seen in the accompanying illustration sitting outside the nest tending three tiny babies. \"And whenever that little bird sees the Chipmunks, he sings \u2013 'Who's-been-digging-up my-nuts? Who's been digging-up my-nuts?' But nobody ever answers!\" Chippy Hackee and his wife are seen in the last illustration trying to drive the little bird away with their tree-leaf umbrella.\nPotter's idea to make the squirrel grow so fat he cannot escape the tree was imitated by A. A. Milne in Winnie the Pooh.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg EBook of The Tale of Timmy Tiptoes, by Beatrix Potter\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

HOROWITZ & SON\n\n\n\n\nFOR\n\nMANY UNKNOWN LITTLE FRIENDS,\n\nINCLUDING MONICA\n\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\nOnce upon a time there was a little fat comfortable grey squirrel, called\nTimmy Tiptoes. He had a nest thatched with leaves in the top of a tall\ntree; and he had a little squirrel wife called Goody.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nTimmy Tiptoes sat out, enjoying the breeze; he whisked his tail and\nchuckled--\"Little wife Goody, the nuts are ripe; we must lay up a store\nfor winter and spring.\" Goody Tiptoes was busy pushing moss under the\nthatch--\"The nest is so snug, we shall be sound asleep all winter.\" \"Then\nwe shall wake up all the thinner, when there is nothing to eat in\nspring-time,\" replied prudent Timothy.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nWhen Timmy and Goody Tiptoes came to the nut thicket, they found other\nsquirrels were there already.\n\nTimmy took off his jacket and hung it on a twig; they worked away quietly\nby themselves.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nEvery day they made several journeys and picked quantities of nuts. They\ncarried them away in bags, and stored them in several hollow stumps near\nthe tree where they had built their nest.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nWhen these stumps were full, they began to empty the bags into a hole high\nup a tree, that had belonged to a wood-pecker; the nuts rattled\ndown--down--down inside.\n\n\"How shall you ever get them out again? It is like a money-box!\" said\nGoody.\n\n\"I shall be much thinner before spring-time, my love,\" said Timmy Tiptoes,\npeeping into the hole.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nThey did collect quantities--because they did not lose them! Squirrels who\nbury their nuts in the ground lose more than half, because they cannot\nremember the place.\n\nThe most forgetful squirrel in the wood was called Silvertail. He began to\ndig, and he could not remember. And then he dug again and found some nuts\nthat did not belong to him; and there was a fight. And other squirrels\nbegan to dig,--the whole wood was in commotion!\n\n[Illustration]\n\nUnfortunately, just at this time a flock of little birds flew by, from\nbush to bush, searching for green caterpillars and spiders. There were\nseveral sorts of little birds, twittering different songs.\n\nThe first one sang--\"Who's bin digging-up _my_ nuts? Who's-been-digging-up\n_my_ nuts?\"\n\nAnd another sang--\"Little bita bread and-_no_-cheese! Little bit-a-bread\nan'-_no_-cheese!\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\nThe squirrels followed and listened. The first little bird flew into the\nbush where Timmy and Goody Tiptoes were quietly tying up their bags, and\nit sang--\"Who's-bin digging-up _my_ nuts? Who's been digging-up\n_my_-nuts?\"\n\nTimmy Tiptoes went on with his work without replying; indeed, the little\nbird did not expect an answer. It was only singing its natural song, and\nit meant nothing at all.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nBut when the other squirrels heard that song, they rushed upon Timmy\nTiptoes and cuffed and scratched him, and upset his bag of nuts. The\ninnocent little bird which had caused all the mischief, flew away in a\nfright!\n\nTimmy rolled over and over, and then turned tail and fled towards his\nnest, followed by a crowd of squirrels shouting--\"Who's-been digging-up\n_my_-nuts?\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\nThey caught him and dragged him up the very same tree, where there was the\nlittle round hole, and they pushed him in. The hole was much too small for\nTimmy Tiptoes' figure. They squeezed him dreadfully, it was a wonder they\ndid not break his ribs. \"We will leave him here till he confesses,\" said\nSilvertail Squirrel, and he shouted into the hole--\n\n\"Who's-been-digging-up _my_-nuts?\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\nTimmy Tiptoes made no reply; he had tumbled down inside the tree, upon\nhalf a peck of nuts belonging to himself. He lay quite stunned and still.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nGoody Tiptoes picked up the nut bags and went home. She made a cup of tea\nfor Timmy; but he didn't come and didn't come.\n\nGoody Tiptoes passed a lonely and unhappy night. Next morning she ventured\nback to the nut-bushes to look for him; but the other unkind squirrels\ndrove her away.\n\nShe wandered all over the wood, calling--\n\n\"Timmy Tiptoes! Timmy Tiptoes! Oh, where is Timmy Tiptoes?\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\nIn the meantime Timmy Tiptoes came to his senses. He found himself tucked\nup in a little moss bed, very much in the dark, feeling sore; it seemed to\nbe under ground. Timmy coughed and groaned, because his ribs hurted him.\nThere was a chirpy noise, and a small striped Chipmunk appeared with a\nnight light, and hoped he felt better?\n\nIt was most kind to Timmy Tiptoes; it lent him its night-cap; and the\nhouse was full of provisions.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nThe Chipmunk explained that it had rained nuts through the top of the\ntree--\"Besides, I found a few buried!\" It laughed and chuckled when it\nheard Timmy's story. While Timmy was confined to bed, it 'ticed him to eat\nquantities--\"But how shall I ever get out through that hole unless I thin\nmyself? My wife will be anxious!\" \"Just another nut--or two nuts; let me\ncrack them for you,\" said the Chipmunk. Timmy Tiptoes grew fatter and\nfatter!\n\n[Illustration]\n\nNow Goody Tiptoes had set to work again by herself. She did not put any\nmore nuts into the woodpecker's hole, because she had always doubted how\nthey could be got out again. She hid them under a tree root; they rattled\ndown, down, down. Once when Goody emptied an extra big bagful, there was a\ndecided squeak; and next time Goody brought another bagful, a little\nstriped Chipmunk scrambled out in a hurry.\n\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"It is getting perfectly full-up down-stairs; the sitting-room is full,\nand they are rolling along the passage; and my husband, Chippy Hackee, has\nrun away and left me. What is the explanation of these showers of nuts?\"\n\n\"I am sure I beg your pardon; I did not know that anybody lived here,\"\nsaid Mrs. Goody Tiptoes; \"but where is Chippy Hackee? My husband, Timmy\nTiptoes, has run away too.\" \"I know where Chippy is; a little bird told\nme,\" said Mrs. Chippy Hackee.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nShe led the way to the woodpecker's tree, and they listened at the hole.\n\nDown below there was a noise of nut crackers, and a fat squirrel voice and\na thin squirrel voice were singing together--\n\n    \"My little old man and I fell out,\n     How shall we bring this matter about?\n     Bring it about as well as you can,\n     And get you gone, you little old man!\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"You could squeeze in, through that little round hole,\" said Goody\nTiptoes. \"Yes, I could,\" said the Chipmunk, \"but my husband, Chippy\nHackee, bites!\"\n\nDown below there was a noise of cracking nuts and nibbling; and then the\nfat squirrel voice and the thin squirrel voice sang--\n\n    \"For the diddlum day\n     Day diddle dum di!\n     Day diddle diddle dum day!\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\nThen Goody peeped in at the hole, and called down--\"Timmy Tiptoes! Oh fie,\nTimmy Tiptoes!\" And Timmy replied, \"Is that you, Goody Tiptoes? Why,\ncertainly!\"\n\nHe came up and kissed Goody through the hole; but he was so fat that he\ncould not get out.\n\nChippy Hackee was not too fat, but he did not want to come; he stayed down\nbelow and chuckled.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nAnd so it went on for a fortnight; till a big wind blew off the top of the\ntree, and opened up the hole and let in the rain.\n\nThen Timmy Tiptoes came out, and went home with an umbrella.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nBut Chippy Hackee continued to camp out for another week, although it was\nuncomfortable.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nAt last a large bear came walking through the wood. Perhaps he also was\nlooking for nuts; he seemed to be sniffing around.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nChippy Hackee went home in a hurry!\n\n[Illustration]\n\nAnd when Chippy Hackee got home, he found he had caught a cold in his\nhead; and he was more uncomfortable still.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nAnd now Timmy and Goody Tiptoes keep their nut-store fastened up with a\nlittle padlock.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nAnd whenever that little bird sees the Chipmunks, he\nsings--\"Who's-been-digging-up _my_-nuts? Who's been digging-up _my_-nuts?\"\nBut nobody ever answers!\n\n\nTHE END\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's The Tale of Timmy Tiptoes, by Beatrix Potter\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE TALE OF TIMMY TIPTOES ***\n\n***** This file should be named 14797.txt or 14797.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\/1\/4\/7\/9\/14797\/\n\nProduced by Robert Cicconetti, Emmy and the PG Online Distributed\nProofreading Team (http:\/\/www.pgdp.net).\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http:\/\/pglaf.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":632,"split":"train"}
