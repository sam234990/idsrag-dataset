On his first day at Gate, he meets a girl named Binky and a boy named Charlie Good.\nWithout Binky, life would be pretty terrible for Paul. The kids at school look down on him because his mother is a teacher there. Thanks to his father, Paul looks down on her too. His father, busy with a new wife and baby, ignores his calls and finally tells him to go away. He feels responsible for being a surrogate man of the house for his mother, who is clingy and insecure. This is far too much pressure for Paul, and only drives him away from confiding in his mother about anything happening in his life. Binky knows the score from way back, and knows it wasn\u2019t that much easier on David Blanco, son of the school janitor. When David\u2019s dog is found killed, the school population tacitly blames David, because it\u2019s easier than figuring out which one of the children of privilege is the corrupt one.\nIn the midst of all this, Charlie Good starts asking things of Paul. If there is an uppercrust at the upper crust school, Charlie is it. He seems, in many ways, to be nearly as lonely as Paul. His father pushes him to be a tennis overachiever, and his mother is barely present. Charlie\u2019s method of blowing off steam is a little harmless vandalism. After a fight with his mother, Paul, tortured by feelings of rejection at the hands of his father, is exhilarated by his night of petty theft and mailbox smashing.\nSuddenly, however, it doesn\u2019t seem so harmless when Charlie asks Paul to break into the school and change his grade. Paul starts to get the idea that Charlie is manipulative\u2026 but he has yet to find out how manipulative.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg EBook of The Breaking Point, by Mary Roberts Rinehart\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

His larynx, which gave him somewhat the effect of having\nswallowed a crab-apple and got it only part way down, protruded above\nhis low collar.\n\n\"Heaven and earth,\" sang the bass, Mr. Edwin Goodno, of the meat market\nand the Boy Scouts. \"Heaven and earth, are full--\" His chin, large and\nfleshy, buried itself deep; his eyes were glued on the music sheet in\nhis hand.\n\n\"Are full, are full, are full,\" sang the soprano, Clare Rossiter, of the\nyellow colonial house on the Ridgely Road. She sang with her eyes turned\nup, and as she reached G flat she lifted herself on her toes. \"Of the\nmajesty, of Thy glory.\"\n\n\"Ready,\" barked the choir master. \"Full now, and all together.\"\n\nThe choir room in the parish house resounded to the twenty voices of the\nchoir. The choir master at the piano kept time with his head. Earnest\nand intent, they filled the building with the Festival Te Deum of Dudley\nBuck, Opus 63, No. 1.\n\nElizabeth Wheeler liked choir practice. She liked the way in which,\nafter the different parts had been run through, the voices finally\nblended into harmony and beauty. She liked the small sense of\nachievement it gave her, and of being a part, on Sundays, of the\nservice. She liked the feeling, when she put on the black cassock and\nwhite surplice and the small round velvet cap of having placed in her\nlocker the things of this world, such as a rose-colored hat and a blue\ngeorgette frock, and of being stripped, as it were, for aspirations.\n\nAt such times she had vague dreams of renunciation. She saw herself\ncloistered in some quiet spot, withdrawn from the world; a place where\nthere were long vistas of pillars and Gothic arches, after a photograph\nin the living room at home, and a great organ somewhere, playing.\n\nShe would go home from church, however, clad in the rose-colored hat and\nthe blue georgette frock, and eat a healthy Sunday luncheon; and by two\no'clock in the afternoon, when the family slept and Jim had gone to the\ncountry club, her dreams were quite likely to be entirely different.\nGenerally speaking, they had to do with love. Romantic, unclouded young\nlove dramatic only because it was love, and very happy.\n\nSometime, perhaps, some one would come and say he loved her. That was\nall. That was at once the beginning and the end. Her dreams led up to\nthat and stopped. Not by so much as a hand clasp did they pass that\nwall.\n\nSo she sat in the choir room and awaited her turn.\n\n\"Altos a little stronger, please.\"\n\n\"Of the majesty, of the majesty, of the majesty, of Thy gl-o-o-ry,\" sang\nElizabeth. And was at once a nun and a principal in a sentimental dream\nof two.\n\nWhat appeared to the eye was a small and rather ethereal figure with\nsleek brown hair and wistful eyes; nice eyes, of no particular color.\nPretty with the beauty of youth, sensitive and thoughtful, infinitely\nloyal and capable of suffering and not otherwise extraordinary was\nElizabeth Wheeler in her plain wooden chair. A figure suggestive of no\ndrama and certainly of no tragedy, its attitude expectant and waiting,\nwith that alternate hope and fear which is youth at twenty, when all of\nlife lies ahead and every to-morrow may hold some great adventure.\n\nClare Rossiter walked home that night with Elizabeth. She was a tall\nblonde girl, lithe and graceful, and with a calculated coquetry in her\nclothes.\n\n\"Do you mind going around the block?\" she asked. \"By Station Street?\"\nThere was something furtive and yet candid in her voice, and Elizabeth\nglanced at her.\n\n\"All right. But it's out of your way, isn't it?\"\n\n\"Yes. I--You're so funny, Elizabeth. It's hard to talk to you. But I've\ngot to talk to somebody. I go around by Station Street every chance I\nget.\"\n\n\"By Station Street? Why?\"\n\n\"I should think you could guess why.\"\n\nShe saw that Clare desired to be questioned, and at the same time\nshe felt a great distaste for the threatened confidence. She loathed\narm-in-arm confidences, the indecency of dragging up and exposing, in\nwhispers, things that should have been buried deep in reticence. She\nhesitated, and Clare slipped an arm through hers.\n\n\"You don't know, then, do you? Sometimes I think every one must know.\nAnd I don't care. I've reached that point.\"\n\nHer confession, naive and shameless, and yet somehow not without a\ncertain dignity, flowed on. She was mad about Doctor Dick Livingstone.\nGoodness knew why, for he never looked at her. She might be the dirt\nunder his feet for all he knew. She trembled when she met him in the\nstreet, and sometimes he looked past her and never saw her. She didn't\nsleep well any more.\n\nElizabeth listened in great discomfort. She did not see in Clare's\nhopeless passion the joy of the flagellant, or the self-dramatization\nof a neurotic girl. She saw herself unwillingly forced to peer into\nthe sentimental windows of Clare's soul, and there to see Doctor Dick\nLivingstone, an unconscious occupant. But she had a certain fugitive\nsense of guilt, also. Formless as her dreams had been, vague and shy,\nthey had nevertheless centered about some one who should be tall, like\nDick Livingstone, and alternately grave, which was his professional\nmanner, and gay, which was his manner when it turned out to be only a\ncold, and he could take a few minutes to be himself. Generally speaking,\nthey centered about some one who resembled Dick Livingstone, but who\ndid not, as did Doctor Livingstone, assume at times an air of frightful\nmaturity and pretend that in years gone by he had dandled her on his\nknee.\n\n\"Sometimes I think he positively avoids me,\" Clare wailed. \"There's\nthe house, Elizabeth. Do you mind stopping a moment? He must be in his\noffice now. The light's burning.\"\n\n\"I wish you wouldn't, Clare. He'd hate it if he knew.\"\n\nShe moved on and Clare slowly followed her. The Rossiter girl's flow\nof talk had suddenly stopped. She was thoughtful and impulsively\nsuspicious.\n\n\"Look here, Elizabeth, I believe you care for him yourself.\"\n\n\"I? What is the matter with you to-night, Clare?\"\n\n\"I'm just thinking. Your voice was so queer.\"\n\nThey walked on in silence. The flow of Clare's confidences had ceased,\nand her eyes were calculating and a trifle hard.\n\n\"There's a good bit of talk about him,\" she jerked out finally. \"I\nsuppose you've heard it.\"\n\n\"What sort of talk?\"\n\n\"Oh, gossip. You'll hear it. Everybody's talking about it. It's doing\nhim a lot of harm.\"\n\n\"I don't believe it,\" Elizabeth flared. \"This town hasn't anything else\nto do, and so it talks. It makes me sick.\"\n\nShe did not attempt to analyze the twisted motives that made Clare\nbelittle what she professed to love. And she did not ask what the gossip\nwas. Half way up Palmer Lane she turned in at the cement path between\nborders of early perennials which led to the white Wheeler house. She\nwas flushed and angry, hating Clare for her unsolicited confidence and\nher malice, hating even Haverly, that smiling, tree-shaded suburb which\n\"talked.\"\n\nShe opened the door quietly and went in. Micky, the Irish terrier, lay\nasleep at the foot of the stairs, and her father's voice, reading aloud,\ncame pleasantly from the living room. Suddenly her sense of resentment\ndied. With the closing of the front door the peace of the house\nenveloped her. What did it matter if, beyond that door, there were\nunrequited love and petty gossip, and even tragedy? Not that she put all\nthat into conscious thought; she had merely a sensation of sanctuary\nand peace. Here, within these four walls, were all that one should need,\nlove and security and quiet happiness. Walter Wheeler, pausing to turn a\npage, heard her singing as she went up the stairs. In the moment of the\nturning he too had a flash of content. Twenty-five years of married life\nand all well; Nina married, Jim out of college, Elizabeth singing her\nway up the stairs, and here by the lamp his wife quietly knitting while\nhe read to her. He was reading Paradise Lost: \"The mind is its own\nplace, and in itself can make a Heaven of Hell, a Hell of Heaven.\"\n\nHe did a certain amount of serious reading every year.\n\nOn Sunday mornings, during the service, Elizabeth earnestly tried to\nbanish all worldly thoughts. In spite of this resolve, however, she was\nalways conscious of a certain regret that the choir seats necessitated\nturning her profile to the congregation. At the age of twelve she had\ndecided that her nose was too short, and nothing had happened since\nto change her conviction. She seldom so much as glanced at the\ncongregation. During her slow progress up and down the main aisle behind\nthe Courtney boy, who was still a soprano and who carried the great gold\ncross, she always looked straight ahead. Or rather, although she was\nunconscious of this, slightly up. She always looked up when she sang,\nfor she had commenced to take singing lessons when the piano music rack\nwas high above her head.\n\nSo she still lifted her eyes as she went up the aisle, and was extremely\nserious over the whole thing. Because it is a solemn matter to take a\nnumber of people who have been up to that moment engrossed in thoughts\nof food or golf or servants or business, and in the twinkling of an eye,\nas the prayer book said about death, turn their minds to worship.\n\nNevertheless, although she never looked at the pews, she was always\nconscious of two of them. The one near the pulpit was the Sayres' and it\nwas the social calendar of the town. When Mrs. Sayre was in it, it was\nthe social season. One never knew when Mrs. Sayre's butler would call up\nand say:\n\n\"I am speaking for Mrs. Sayre. Mrs. Sayre would like to have the\npleasure of Miss Wheeler's company on Thursday to luncheon, at\none-thirty.\"\n\nWhen the Sayre pew was empty, the town knew, if it happened to be\nwinter, that the Florida or Santa Barbara season was on; or in summer\nthe Maine coast.\n\nThe other pew was at the back of the church. Always it had one occupant;\nsometimes it had three. But the behavior of this pew was very erratic.\nSometimes an elderly and portly gentleman with white hair and fierce\neyebrows would come in when the sermon was almost over. Again, a hand\nwould reach through the grill behind it, and a tall young man who\nhad had his eyes fixed in the proper direction, but not always on\nthe rector, would reach for his hat, get up and slip out. On these\noccasions, however, he would first identify the owner of the hand and\nthen bend over the one permanent occupant of the pew, a little old lady.\nHis speech was as Yea, yea, or Nay, nay, for he either said, \"I'll be\nback for dinner,\" or \"Don't look for me until you see me.\"\n\nAnd Mrs. Crosby, without taking her eyes from the sermon, would nod.\n\nOf late years, Doctor David Livingstone had been taking less and less\nof the \"Don't-look-for-me-until-you-see-me\" cases, and Doctor Dick had\nacquired a car, which would not freeze when left outside all night like\na forgotten dog, and a sense of philosophy about sleep. That is, that\neleven o'clock P.M. was bed-time to some people, but was just eleven\no'clock for him.\n\nWhen he went to church he listened to the sermon, but rather often\nhe looked at Elizabeth Wheeler. When his eyes wandered, as the most\nfaithful eyes will now and then, they were apt to rest on the flag that\nhad hung, ever since the war, beside the altar. He had fought for his\ncountry in a sea of mud, never nearer than two hundred miles to the\nbattle line, fought with a surgical kit instead of a gun, but he was\ncontent. Not to all the high adventure.\n\nHad he been asked, suddenly, the name of the tall blonde girl who sang\namong the sopranos, he could not have told it.\n\nThe Sunday morning following Clare Rossiter's sentimental confession,\nElizabeth tried very hard to banish all worldly thoughts, as usual,\nand to see the kneeling, rising and sitting congregation as there for\nworship. But for the first time she wondered. Some of the faces were\nblank, as though behind the steady gaze the mind had wandered far\nafield, or slept. Some were intent, some even devout. But for the first\ntime she began to feel that people in the mass might be cruel, too.\nHow many of them, for instance, would sometime during the day pass on,\nbehind their hands, the gossip Clare had mentioned?\n\nShe changed her position, and glanced quickly over the church. The\nLivingstone pew was fully occupied, and well up toward the front, Wallie\nSayre was steadfastly regarding her. She looked away quickly.\n\nCame the end of the service. Came down the aisle the Courtney boy, clean\nand shining and carrying high his glowing symbol. Came the choir, two by\ntwo, the women first, sopranos, altos and Elizabeth. Came the men,\nbass and tenor, neatly shaved for Sunday morning. Came the rector, Mr.\nOglethorpe, a trifle wistful, because always he fell so far below the\nmark he had set. Came the benediction. Came the slow rising from its\nknees of the congregation and its cheerful bustle of dispersal.\n\nDoctor Dick Livingstone stood up and helped Doctor David into his\nnew spring overcoat. He was very content. It was May, and the sun was\nshining. It was Sunday, and he would have an hour or two of leisure. And\nhe had made a resolution about a matter that had been in his mind for\nsome time. He was very content.\n\nHe looked around the church with what was almost a possessive eye. These\npeople were his friends. He knew them all, and they knew him. They had,\nagainst his protest, put his name on the bronze tablet set in the wall\non the roll of honor. Small as it was, this was his world.\n\nHalf smiling, he glanced about. He did not realize that behind their\nbows and greetings there was something new that day, something not so\nmuch unkind as questioning.\n\nOutside in the street he tucked his aunt, Mrs. Crosby, against the\nspring wind, and waited at the wheel of the car while David entered with\nthe deliberation of a man accustomed to the sagging of his old side-bar\nbuggy under his weight. Long ago Dick had dropped the titular \"uncle,\"\nand as David he now addressed him.\n\n\"You're going to play some golf this afternoon, David,\" he said firmly.\n\"Mike had me out this morning to look at your buggy springs.\"\n\nDavid chuckled. He still stuck to his old horse, and to the ancient\nvehicle which had been the signal of distress before so many doors for\nforty years. \"I can trust old Nettie,\" he would say. \"She doesn't freeze\nher radiator on cold nights, she doesn't skid, and if I drop asleep\nshe'll take me home and into my own barn, which is more than any\nautomobile would do.\"\n\n\"I'm going to sleep,\" he said comfortably. \"Get Wallie Sayre--I see he's\nback from some place again--or ask a nice girl. Ask Elizabeth Wheeler. I\ndon't think Lucy here expects to be the only woman in your life.\"\n\nDick stared into the windshield.\n\n\"I've been wondering about that, David,\" he said, \"just how much\nright--\"\n\n\"Balderdash!\" David snorted. \"Don't get any fool notion in your head.\"\n\nFollowed a short silence with Dick driving automatically and thinking.\nFinally he drew a long breath.\n\n\"All right,\" he said, \"how about that golf--you need exercise. You're\nputting on weight, and you know it. And you smoke too much. It's either\nless tobacco or more walking, and you ought to know it.\"\n\nDavid grunted, but he turned to Lucy Crosby, in the rear seat:\n\n\"Lucy, d'you know where my clubs are?\"\n\n\"You loaned them to Jim Wheeler last fall. If you get three of them back\nyou're lucky.\" Mrs. Crosby's voice was faintly tart. Long ago she\nhad learned that her brother's belongings were his only by right of\npurchase, and were by way of being community property. When, early\nin her widowhood and her return to his home, she had found that her\nprotests resulted only in a sort of clandestine giving or lending, she\nhad exacted a promise from him. \"I ask only one thing, David,\" she\nhad said. \"Tell me where the things go. There wasn't a blanket for the\nguest-room bed at the time of the Diocesan Convention.\"\n\n\"I'll run around to the Wheelers' and get them,\" Dick observed, in a\ncarefully casual voice. \"I'll see the Carter baby, too, David, and that\nclears the afternoon. Any message?\"\n\nLucy glanced at him, but David moved toward the house.\n\n\"Give Elizabeth a kiss for me,\" he called over his shoulder, and went\nchuckling up the path.\n\n\n\n\nII\n\nMrs. Crosby stood on the pavement, gazing after the car as it moved off.\nShe had not her brother's simplicity nor his optimism. Her married years\nhad taken her away from the environment which had enabled him to live\nhis busy, uncomplicated life; where, the only medical man in a growing\ncommunity, he had learned to form his own sturdy decisions and then to\nabide by them.\n\nBlack and white, right and wrong, the proper course and the improper\ncourse--he lived in a sort of two-dimensional ethical world. But to Lucy\nCrosby, between black and white there was a gray no-man's land of doubt\nand indecision; a half-way house of compromise, and sometimes David\nfrightened her. He was so sure.\n\nShe passed the open door into the waiting-room, where sat two or three\npatient and silent figures, and went back to the kitchen. Minnie, the\nelderly servant, sat by the table reading, amid the odor of roasting\nchicken; outside the door on the kitchen porch was the freezer\ncontaining the dinner ice-cream. An orderly Sunday peace was in the air,\na gesture of homely comfort, order and security.\n\nMinnie got up.\n\n\"I'll unpin your veil for you,\" she offered, obligingly. \"You've got\ntime to lie down about ten minutes. Mrs. Morgan said she's got to have\nher ears treated.\"\n\n\"I hope she doesn't sit and talk for an hour.\"\n\n\"She'll talk, all right,\" Minnie observed, her mouth full of pins.\n\"She'd be talking to me yet if I'd stood there. She's got her nerve,\ntoo, that woman.\"\n\n\"I don't like to hear you speak so of the patients who come to the\nhouse, Minnie.\"\n\n\"Well, I don't like their asking me questions about the family either,\"\nsaid Minnie, truculently. \"She wanted to know who was Doctor Dick's\nmother. Said she had had a woman here from Wyoming, and she thought\nshe'd known his people.\"\n\nMrs. Crosby stood very still.\n\n\"I think she should bring her questions to the family,\" she said, after\na silence. \"Thank you, Minnie.\"\n\nBonnet in hand, she moved toward the stairs, climbed them and went into\nher room. Recently life had been growing increasingly calm and less\nbeset with doubts. For the first time, with Dick's coming to live with\nthem ten years before, a boy of twenty-two, she had found a vicarious\nmaternity and gloried in it. Recently she had been very happy. The war\nwas over and he was safely back; again she could sew on his buttons and\ndarn his socks, and turn down his bed at night. He filled the old house\nwith cheer and with vitality. And, as David gave up more and more of\nthe work, he took it on his broad shoulders, efficient, tireless, and\nincreasingly popular.\n\nShe put her bonnet away in its box, and suddenly there rose in her frail\nold body a fierce and unexpected resentment against David. He had chosen\na course and abided by it. He had even now no doubt or falterings. Just\nas in the first anxious days there had been no doubt in him as to the\nessential rightness of what he was doing. And now--This was what came of\ntaking a life and moulding it in accordance with a predetermined plan.\nThat was for God to do, not man.\n\nShe sat down near her window and rocked slowly, to calm herself. Outside\nthe Sunday movement of the little suburban town went by: the older\nWheeler girl, Nina, who had recently married Leslie Ward, in her smart\nlittle car; Harrison Miller, the cynical bachelor who lived next door,\non his way to the station news stand for the New York papers; young\ncouples taking small babies for the air in a perambulator; younger\ncouples, their eyes on each other and on the future.\n\nThat, too, she reflected bitterly! Dick was in love. She had not watched\nhim for that very thing for so long without being fairly sure now. She\nhad caught, as simple David with his celibate heart could never have\ncaught, the tone in Dick's voice when he mentioned the Wheelers. She had\nwatched him for the past few months in church on Sunday mornings, and\nshe knew that as she watched him, so he looked at Elizabeth.\n\nAnd David was so sure! So sure.\n\nThe office door closed and Mrs. Morgan went out, a knitted scarf\nwrapping her ears against the wind, and following her exit came the slow\nascent of David as he climbed the stairs to wash for dinner.\n\nShe stopped rocking.\n\n\"David!\" she called sharply.\n\nHe opened the door and came in, a bulky figure, still faintly aromatic\nof drugs, cheerful and serene.\n\n\"D'you call me?\" he inquired.\n\n\"Yes. Shut the door and come in. I want to talk to you.\" He closed the\ndoor and went to the hearth-rug. There was a photograph of Dick on the\nmantel, taken in his uniform, and he looked at it for a moment. Then he\nturned. \"All right, my dear. Let's have it.\"\n\n\"Did Mrs. Morgan have anything to say?\" He stared at her.\n\n\"She usually has,\" he said. \"I never knew you considered it worth\nrepeating. No. Nothing in particular.\"\n\nThe very fact that Mrs. Morgan had limited her inquiry to Minnie\nconfirmed her suspicions. But somehow, face to face with David, she\ncould not see his contentment turned to anxiety.\n\n\"I want to talk to you about Dick.\"\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\n\"I think he's in love, David.\"\n\nDavid's heavy body straightened, but his face remained serene.\n\n\"We had to expect that, Lucy. Is it Elizabeth Wheeler, do you think?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nFor a moment there was silence. The canary in its cage hopped about, a\nbeady inquisitive eye now on one, now on the other of them.\n\n\"She's a good girl, Lucy.\"\n\n\"That's not the point, is it?\"\n\n\"Do you think she cares for him?\"\n\n\"I don't know. There's some talk of Wallie Sayre. He's there a good\nbit.\"\n\n\"Wallie Sayre!\" snorted David. \"He's never done a day's work in his\nlife and never will.\" He reflected on that with growing indignation. \"He\ndoesn't hold a candle to Dick. Of course, if the girl's a fool--\"\n\nHands thrust deep into his pockets David took a turn about the room.\nLucy watched him. At last:\n\n\"You're evading the real issue, David, aren't you?\"\n\n\"Perhaps I am,\" he admitted. \"I'd better talk to him. I think he's got\nan idea he shouldn't marry. That's nonsense.\"\n\n\"I don't mean that, exactly,\" Lucy persisted. \"I mean, won't he want a\ngood many things cleared up before he marries? Isn't he likely to want\nto go back to Norada?\"\n\nSome of the ruddy color left David's face. He stood still, staring at\nher and silent.\n\n\"You know he meant to go three years ago, but the war came, and--\"\n\nHer voice trailed off. She could not even now easily recall those days\nwhen Dick was drilling on the golf links, and that later period of\nseparation.\n\n\"If he does go back--\"\n\n\"Donaldson is dead,\" David broke in, almost roughly.\n\n\"Maggie Donaldson is still living.\"\n\n\"What if she is? She's loyal to the core, in the first place. In the\nsecond, she's criminally liable. As liable as I am.\"\n\n\"There is one thing, David, I ought to know. What has become of the\nCarlysle girl?\"\n\n\"She left the stage. There was a sort of general conviction she was\nimplicated and--I don't know, Lucy. Sometimes I think she was.\" He\nsighed. \"I read something about her coming back, some months ago, in\n'The Valley.' That was the thing she was playing the spring before\nit happened.\" He turned on her. \"Don't get that in your head with the\nrest.\"\n\n\"I wonder, sometimes.\"\n\n\"I know it.\"\n\nOutside the slamming of an automobile door announced Dick's return, and\nalmost immediately Minnie rang the old fashioned gong which hung in the\nlower hall. Mrs. Crosby got up and placed a leaf of lettuce between the\nbars of the bird cage.\n\n\"Dinner time, Caruso,\" she said absently. Caruso was the name Dick had\ngiven the bird. And to David: \"She must be in her thirties now.\"\n\n\"Probably.\" Then his anger and anxiety burst out. \"What difference can\nit make about her? About Donaldson's wife? About any hang-over from that\nrotten time? They're gone, all of them. He's here. He's safe and happy.\nHe's strong and fine. That's gone.\"\n\nIn the lower hall Dick was taking off his overcoat.\n\n\"Smell's like chicken, Minnie,\" he said, into the dining room.\n\n\"Chicken and biscuits, Mr. Dick.\"\n\n\"Hi, up there!\" he called lustily. \"Come and feed a starving man. I'm\ngoing to muffle the door-bell!\"\n\nHe stood smiling up at them, very tidy in his Sunday suit, very boyish,\nfor all his thirty-two years. His face, smilingly tender as he watched\nthem, was strong rather than handsome, quietly dependable and faintly\nhumorous.\n\n\"In the language of our great ally,\" he said, \"Madame et Monsieur, le\ndiner est servi.\"\n\nIn his eyes there was not only tenderness but a somewhat emphasized\naffection, as though he meant to demonstrate, not only to them but to\nhimself, that this new thing that had come to him did not touch their\nold relationship. For the new thing had come. He was still slightly\ndazed with the knowledge of it, and considerably anxious. Because he had\njust taken a glance at himself in the mirror of the walnut hat-rack, and\nhad seen nothing there particularly to inspire--well, to inspire what he\nwanted to inspire.\n\nAt the foot of the stairs he drew Lucy's arm through his, and held her\nhand. She seemed very small and frail beside him.\n\n\"Some day,\" he said, \"a strong wind will come along and carry off Mrs.\nLucy Crosby, and the Doctors Livingstone will be obliged hurriedly to\nrent aeroplanes, and to search for her at various elevations!\"\n\nDavid sat down and picked up the old fashioned carving knife.\n\n\"Get the clubs?\" he inquired.\n\nDick looked almost stricken.\n\n\"I forgot them, David,\" he said guiltily. \"Jim Wheeler went out to look\nthem up, and I--I'll go back after dinner.\"\n\nIt was sometime later in the meal that Dick looked up from his plate and\nsaid:\n\n\"I'd like to cut office hours on Wednesday night, David. I've asked\nElizabeth Wheeler to go into town to the theater.\"\n\n\"What about the baby at the Homer place?\"\n\n\"Not due until Sunday. I'll leave my seat number at the box office,\nanyhow.\"\n\n\"What are you going to see, Dick?\" Mrs. Crosby asked. \"Will you have\nsome dumplings?\"\n\n\n\"I will, but David shouldn't. Too much starch. Why, it's 'The Valley,' I\nthink. An actress named Carlysle, Beverly Carlysle, is starring in it.\"\n\nHe ate on, his mind not on his food, but back in the white house on\nPalmer Lane, and a girl. Lucy Crosby, fork in air, stared at him, and\nthen glanced at David.\n\nBut David did not look up from his plate.\n\n\n\n\nIII\n\n\nThe Wheeler house was good, modern and commonplace. Walter Wheeler and\nhis wife were like the house. Just as here and there among the furniture\nthere was a fine thing, an antique highboy, a Sheraton sideboard or\nsome old cut glass, so they had, with a certain mediocrity their own\noutstanding virtues. They liked music, believed in the home as the unit\nof the nation, put happiness before undue ambition, and had devoted\ntheir lives to their children.\n\nFor many years their lives had centered about the children. For years\nthey had held anxious conclave about whooping cough, about small early\ndisobediences, later about Sunday tennis. They stood united to protect\nthe children against disease, trouble and eternity.\n\nNow that the children were no longer children, they were sometimes\nlonely and still apprehensive. They feared motor car accidents, and\nWalter Wheeler had withstood the appeals of Jim for a half dozen years.\nThey feared trains for them, and journeys, and unhappy marriages, and\nhid their fears from each other. Their nightly prayers were \"to keep\nthem safe and happy.\"\n\nBut they saw life reaching out and taking them, one by one. They saw\nthem still as children, but as children determined to bear their own\nburdens. Jim stayed out late sometimes, and considered his manhood in\nquestion if interrogated. Nina was married and out of the home, but\nthere loomed before them the possibility of maternity and its dangers\nfor her. There remained only Elizabeth, and on her they lavished the\ncare formerly divided among the three.\n\nIt was their intention and determination that she should never know\ntrouble. She was tenderer than the others, more docile and gentle. They\nsaw her, not as a healthy, normal girl, but as something fragile and\nvery precious.\n\nNina was different. They had always worried a little about Nina,\nalthough they had never put their anxiety to each other. Nina had always\noverrun her dress allowance, although she had never failed to be sweetly\npenitent about it, and Nina had always placed an undue emphasis on\nthings. Her bedroom before her marriage was cluttered with odds and\nends, cotillion favors and photographs, college pennants and small\nunwise purchases--trophies of the gayety and conquest which were her\nlife.\n\nAnd Nina had \"come out.\" It had cost a great deal, and it was not so\nmuch to introduce her to society as to put a family recognition on a\nfact already accomplished, for Nina had brought herself out unofficially\nat sixteen. There had been the club ballroom, and a great many flowers\nwhich withered before they could be got to the hospital; and new\nclothing for all the family, and a caterer and orchestra. After that,\nfor a cold and tumultuous winter Mrs. Wheeler had sat up with the\ndowagers night after night until all hours, and the next morning had\nlet Nina sleep, while she went about her household duties. She had aged,\nrather, and her determined smile had grown a little fixed.\n\nShe was a good woman, and she wanted her children's happiness more than\nanything in the world, but she had a faint and sternly repressed\nfeeling of relief when Nina announced her engagement. Nina did it with\ncharacteristic sangfroid, at dinner one night.\n\n\"Don't ring for Annie for a minute, mother,\" she said. \"I want to tell\nyou all something. I'm going to marry Leslie Ward.\"\n\nThere had been a momentary pause. Then her father said:\n\n\"Just a minute. Is that Will Ward's boy?\"\n\n\"Yes. He's not a boy.\"\n\n\"Well, he'll come around to see me before there's any engagement. Has\nthat occurred to either of you?\"\n\n\"Oh, he'll be around. He'd have come to-night, but Howard Moore is\nhaving his bachelor dinner. I hope he doesn't look shot to pieces\nto-morrow. These bachelor things--! We'd better have a dinner or\nsomething, mother, and announce it.\"\n\nThere had been the dinner, with a silver loving cup bought for the\noccasion, and thereafter to sit out its useless days on the Sheraton\nsideboard. And there had been a trousseau and a wedding so expensive\nthat a small frown of anxiety had developed between Walter Wheeler's\neyebrows and stayed there.\n\nFor Nina's passion for things was inherent, persisting after her\nmarriage. She discounted her birthday and Christmases in advance, coming\naround to his office a couple of months before the winter holidays and\nneeding something badly.\n\n\"It's like this, daddy,\" she would say. \"You're going to give me a check\nfor Christmas anyhow, aren't you? And it would do me more good now. I\nsimply can't go to another ball.\"\n\n\"Where's your trousseau?\"\n\n\"It's worn out-danced to rags. And out of date, too.\"\n\n\"I don't understand it, Nina. You and Leslie have a good income. Your\nmother and I--\"\n\n\"You didn't have any social demands. And wedding presents! If one more\nfriend of mine is married--\"\n\nHe would get out his checkbook and write a check slowly and\nthoughtfully. And tearing it off would say:\n\n\"Now remember, Nina, this is for Christmas. Don't feel aggrieved when\nthe time comes and you have no gift from us.\"\n\nBut he knew that when the time came Margaret, his wife, would hold out\nalmost to the end, and then slip into a jeweler's and buy Nina something\nshe simply couldn't do without.\n\nIt wasn't quite fair, he felt. It wasn't fair to Jim or to Elizabeth.\nParticularly to Elizabeth.\n\nSometimes he looked at Elizabeth with a little prayer in his heart,\nnever articulate, that life would be good to her; that she might keep\nher illusions and her dreams; that the soundness and wholesomeness of\nher might keep her from unhappiness. Sometimes, as she sat reading or\nsewing, with the light behind her shining through her soft hair, he saw\nin her a purity that was almost radiant.\n\nHe was in arms at once a night or two before Dick had invited Elizabeth\nto go to the theater when Margaret Wheeler said:\n\n\"The house was gayer when Nina was at home.\"\n\n\"Yes. And you were pretty sick of it. Full of roistering young idiots.\nPiano and phonograph going at once, pairs of gigglers in the pantry\nat the refrigerator, pairs on the stairs and on the verandah,\ncigar-ashes--my cigars--and cigarettes over everything, and more\ninfernal spooning going on than I've ever seen in my life.\"\n\nHe had resumed his newspaper, to put it down almost at once.\n\n\"What's that Sayre boy hanging around for?\"\n\n\"I think he's in love with her, Walter.\"\n\n\"Love? Any of the Sayre tribe? Jim Sayre drank himself to death, and\nthis boy is like him. And Jim Sayre wasn't faithful to his wife. This\nboy is--well, he's an heir. That's why he was begotten.\"\n\nMargaret Wheeler stared at him.\n\n\"Why, Walter!\" she said. \"He's a nice boy, and he's a gentleman.\"\n\n\"Why? Because he gets up when you come into the room? Why in\nheaven's name don't you encourage real men to come here? There's Dick\nLivingstone. He's a man.\"\n\nMargaret hesitated.\n\n\"Walter, have you ever thought there was anything queer about Dick\nLivingstone's coming here?\"\n\n\"Darned good for the town that he did come.\"\n\n\"But--nobody ever dreamed that David and Lucy had a nephew. Then he\nturns up, and they send him to medical college, and all that.\"\n\n\"I've got some relations I haven't notified the town I possess,\" he said\ngrimly.\n\n\"Well, there's something odd. I don't believe Henry Livingstone, the\nWyoming brother, ever had a son.\"\n\n\"What possible foundation have you for a statement like that?\"\n\n\"Mrs. Cook Morgan's sister-in-law has been visiting her lately. She says\nshe knew Henry Livingstone well years ago in the West, and she never\nheard he was married. She says positively he was not married.\"\n\n\"And trust the Morgan woman to spread the good news,\" he said with angry\nsarcasm. \"Well, suppose that's true? Suppose Dick is an illegitimate\nchild? That's the worst that's implied, I daresay. That's nothing\nagainst Dick himself. I'll tell the world there's good blood on the\nLivingstone side, anyhow.\"\n\n\"You were very particular about Wallie Sayre's heredity, Walter.\"\n\n\"That's different,\" he retorted, and retired into gloomy silence behind\nhis newspaper. Drat these women anyhow. It was like some fool female to\ncome there and rake up some old and defunct scandal. He'd stand up for\nDick, if it ever came to a show-down. He liked Dick. What the devil did\nhis mother matter, anyhow? If this town hadn't had enough evidence of\nDick Livingstone's quality the last few years he'd better go elsewhere.\nHe--\n\nHe got up and whistled for the dog.\n\n\"I'm going to take a walk,\" he said briefly, and went out. He always\ntook a walk when things disturbed him.\n\nOn the Sunday afternoon after Dick had gone Elizabeth was alone in her\nroom upstairs. On the bed lay the sort of gown Nina would have called\na dinner dress, and to which Elizabeth referred as her dark blue. Seen\nthus, in the room which was her own expression, there was a certain\nnobility about her very simplicity, a steadiness about her eyes that was\nalmost disconcerting.\n\n\"She's the saintly-looking sort that would go on the rocks for some\nman,\" Nina had said once, rather flippantly, \"and never know she was\nshipwrecked. No man in the world could do that to me.\"\n\nBut just then Elizabeth looked totally unlike shipwreck. Nothing seemed\nmore like a safe harbor than the Wheeler house that afternoon, or\nall the afternoons. Life went on, the comfortable life of an upper\nmiddle-class household. Candles and flowers on the table and a neat\nwaitress to serve; little carefully planned shopping expeditions; fine\nhand-sewing on dainty undergarments for rainy days; small tributes of\nbooks and candy; invitations and consultations as to what to wear; choir\npractice, a class in the Sunday school, a little work among the poor;\nthe volcano which had been Nina overflowing elsewhere in a smart little\nhouse with a butler out on the Ridgely Road.\n\nShe looked what she was, faithful and quietly loyal, steady--and serene;\nnot asking greatly but hoping much; full of small unvisualized dreams\nand little inarticulate prayers; waiting, without knowing that she was\nwaiting.\n\nSometimes she worried. She thought she ought to \"do something.\" A good\nmany of the girls she knew wanted to do something, but they were vague\nas to what. She felt at those times that she was not being very useful,\nand she had gone so far as to lay the matter before her father a couple\nof years before, when she was just eighteen.\n\n\"Just what do you think of doing?\" he had inquired.\n\n\"That's it,\" she had said despondently. \"I don't know. I haven't any\nparticular talent, you know. But I don't think I ought to go on having\nyou support me in idleness all my life.\"\n\n\"Well, I don't think it likely that I'll have to,\" he had observed,\ndryly. \"But here's the point, and I think it's important. I don't intend\nto work without some compensation, and my family is my compensation.\nYou just hang around and make me happy, as you do, and you're fulfilling\nyour economic place in the nation. Don't you forget it, either.\"\n\nThat had comforted her. She had determined then never to marry but to\nhang around, as he suggested, for the rest of her life. She was quite\nearnest about it, and resolved.\n\nShe picked up the blue dress and standing before her mirror, held it up\nbefore her. It looked rather shabby, she thought, but the theater was\nnot like a dance, and anyhow it would look better at night. She had been\nthinking about next Wednesday evening ever since Dick Livingstone\nhad gone. It seemed, better somehow, frightfully important. It was\nfrightfully important. For the first time she acknowledged to herself\nthat she had been fond of him, as she put it, for a long time. She had\nan odd sense, too, of being young and immature, and as though he had\nstooped to her from some height: such as thirty-two years and being in\nthe war, and having to decide about life and death, and so on.\n\nShe hoped he did not think she was only a child.\n\nShe heard Nina coming up the stairs. At the click of her high heels on\nthe hard wood she placed the dress on the bed again, and went to the\nwindow. Her father was on the path below, clearly headed for a walk. She\nknew then that Nina had been asking for something.\n\nNina came in and closed the door. She was smaller than Elizabeth and\nvery pretty. Her eyebrows had been drawn to a tidy line, and from the\ntop of her shining head to her brown suede pumps she was exquisite with\nthe hours of careful tending and careful dressing she gave her young\nbody. Exquisitely pretty, too.\n\nShe sat down on Elizabeth's bed with a sigh.\n\n\"I really don't know what to do with father,\" she said. \"He flies off\nat a tangent over the smallest things. Elizabeth dear, can you lend me\ntwenty dollars? I'll get my allowance on Tuesday.\"\n\n\"I can give you ten.\"\n\n\"Well, ask mother for the rest, won't you? You needn't say it's for me.\nI'll give it to you Tuesday.\"\n\n\"I'm not going to mother, Nina. She has had a lot of expenses this\nmonth.\"\n\n\"Then I'll borrow it from Wallie Sayre,\" Nina said, accepting her defeat\ncheerfully. \"If it was an ordinary bill it could wait, but I lost it at\nbridge last night and it's got to be paid.\"\n\n\"You oughtn't to play bridge for money,\" Elizabeth said, a bit primly.\n\"And if Leslie knew you borrowed from Wallace Sayre--\"\n\n\"I forgot! Wallie's downstairs, Elizabeth. Really, if he wasn't so\nfunny, he'd be tragic.\"\n\n\"Why tragic? He has everything in the world.\"\n\n\"If you use a little bit of sense, you can have it too.\"\n\n\"I don't want\n\n\"Pooh! That's what you think now. Wallie's a nice person. Lots of girls\nare mad about him. And he has about all the money there is.\" Getting\nno response from Elizabeth, she went on: \"I was thinking it over last\nnight. You'll have to marry sometime, and it isn't as though Wallie was\ndissipated, or anything like that. I suppose he knows his way about, but\nthen they all do.\"\n\nShe got up.\n\n\"Be nice to him, anyhow,\" she said. \"He's crazy about you, and when I\nthink of you in that house! It's a wonderful house, Elizabeth. She's got\na suite waiting for Wallie to be married before she furnishes it.\"\n\nElizabeth looked around her virginal little room, with its painted\ndressing table, its chintz, and its white bed with the blue dress on it.\n\n\"I'm very well satisfied as I am,\" she said.\n\nWhile she smoothed her hair before the mirror Nina surveyed the room and\nher eyes lighted on the frock.\n\n\"Are you still wearing that shabby old thing?\" she demanded. \"I do wish\nyou'd get some proper clothes. Are you going somewhere?\"\n\n\"I'm going to the theater on Wednesday night.\"\n\n\"Who with?\" Nina in her family was highly colloquial.\n\n\"With Doctor Livingstone.\"\n\n\"Are you joking?\" Nina demanded.\n\n\"Joking? Of course not.\"\n\nNina sat down again on the bed, her eyes on her sister, curious and not\na little apprehensive.\n\n\"It's the first time it's ever happened, to my knowledge,\" she declared.\n\"I know he's avoided me like poison. I thought he hated women. You know\nClare Rossiter is--\"\n\nElizabeth turned suddenly.\n\n\"Clare is ridiculous,\" she said. \"She hasn't any reserve, or dignity,\nor anything else. And I don't see what my going to the theater with Dick\nLivingstone has to do with her anyhow.\"\n\nNina raised her carefully plucked eyebrows.\n\n\"Really!\" she said. \"You needn't jump down my throat, you know.\" She\nconsidered, her eyes on her sister. \"Don't go and throw yourself away on\nDick Livingstone, Sis. You're too good-looking, and he hasn't a cent. A\nsuburban practice, out all night, that tumble-down old house and two\nold people hung around your necks, for Doctor David is letting go pretty\nfast. It just won't do. Besides, there's a story going the rounds about\nhim, that--\"\n\n\"I don't want to hear it, if you don't mind.\"\n\nShe went to the door and opened it.\n\n\"I've hardly spoken a dozen words to him in my life. But just remember\nthis. When I do find the man I want to marry, I shall make up my own\nmind. As you did,\" she added as a parting shot.\n\nShe was rather sorry as she went down the stairs. She had begun to\nsuspect what the family had never guessed, that Nina was not very happy.\nMore and more she saw in Nina's passion for clothes and gaiety, for\nsmall possessions, an attempt to substitute them for real things. She\neven suspected that sometimes Nina was a little lonely.\n\nWallie Sayre rose from a deep chair as she entered the living-room.\n\n\"Hello,\" he said, \"I was on the point of asking Central to give me this\nnumber so I could get you on the upstairs telephone.\"\n\n\"Nina and I were talking. I'm sorry.\"\n\nWallie, in spite of Walter Wheeler's opinion of him, was an engaging\nyouth with a wide smile, an air of careless well-being, and an obstinate\njaw. What he wanted he went after and generally secured, and Elizabeth,\nenlightened by Nina, began to have a small anxious feeling that\nafternoon that what he wanted just now happened to be herself.\n\n\"Nina coming down?\" he asked.\n\n\"I suppose so. Why?\"\n\n\"You couldn't pass the word along that you are going to be engaged for\nthe next half hour?\"\n\n\"I might, but I certainly don't intend to.\"\n\n\"You are as hard to isolate as a--as a germ,\" he complained. \"I gave\nup a perfectly good golf game to see you, and as your father generally\ncalls the dog the moment I appear and goes for a walk, I thought I might\nsee you alone.\"\n\n\"You're seeing me alone now, you know.\"\n\nSuddenly he leaned over and catching up her hand, kissed it.\n\n\"You're so cool and sweet,\" he said. \"I--I wish you liked me a little.\"\nHe smiled up at her, rather wistfully. \"I never knew any one quite like\nyou.\"\n\nShe drew her hand away. Something Nina had said, that he knew his way\nabout, came into her mind, and made her uncomfortable. Back of him,\nsuddenly, was that strange and mysterious region where men of his sort\nlived their furtive man-life, where they knew their way about. She had\nno curiosity and no interest, but the mere fact of its existence as\nrevealed by Nina repelled her.\n\n\"There are plenty like me,\" she said. \"Don't be silly, Wallie. I hate\nhaving my hand kissed.\"\n\n\"I wonder,\" he observed shrewdly, \"whether that's really true, or\nwhether you just hate having me do it?\"\n\nWhen Nina came in he was drawing a rough sketch of his new power boat,\nbeing built in Florida.\n\nNina's delay was explained by the appearance, a few minutes later, of\na rather sullen Annie with a tea tray. Afternoon tea was not a Wheeler\ninstitution, but was notoriously a Sayre one. And Nina believed in\nputting one's best foot foremost, even when that resulted in a state of\nunstable domestic equilibrium.\n\n\"Put in a word for me, Nina,\" Wallie begged. \"I intend to ask Elizabeth\nto go to the theater this week, and I think she is going to refuse.\"\n\n\"What's the play?\" Nina inquired negligently. She was privately\ndetermining that her mother needed a tea cart and a new tea service.\nThere were some in old Georgian silver--\n\n\"'The Valley.' Not that the play matters. It's Beverly Carlysle.\"\n\n\"I thought she was dead, or something.\"\n\n\"Or something is right. She retired years ago, at the top of her\nsuccess. She was a howling beauty, I'm told. I never saw her. There was\nsome queer story. I've forgotten it. I was a kid then. How about it,\nElizabeth?\"\n\n\"I'm sorry. I'm going Wednesday night.\"\n\nHe looked downcast over that, and he was curious, too. But he made no\ncomment save:\n\n\"Well, better luck next time.\"\n\n\"Just imagine,\" said Nina. \"She's going with Dick Livingstone. Can you\nimagine it?\"\n\nBut Wallace Sayre could and did. He had rather a stricken moment, too.\nOf course, there might be nothing to it; but on the other hand, there\nvery well might. And Livingstone was the sort to attract the feminine\nwoman; he had gravity and responsibility. He was older too, and that\nflattered a girl.\n\n\"He's not a bit attractive,\" Nina was saying. \"Quiet, and--well, I don't\nsuppose he knows what he's got on.\"\n\nWallie was watching Elizabeth.\n\n\"Oh, I don't know,\" he said, with masculine fairness. \"He's a good sort,\nand he's pretty much of a man.\"\n\nHe was quite sure that the look Elizabeth gave him was grateful.\n\nHe went soon after that, keeping up an appearance of gaiety to the end,\nand very careful to hope that Elizabeth would enjoy the play.\n\n\"She's a wonder, they say,\" he said from the doorway. \"Take two hankies\nalong, for it's got more tears than 'East Lynne' and 'The Old Homestead'\nput together.\"\n\nHe went out, holding himself very erect and looking very cheerful until\nhe reached the corner. There however he slumped, and it was a rather\ndespondent young man who stood sometime later, on the center of the\ndeserted bridge over the small river, and surveyed the water with moody\neyes.\n\nIn the dusky living-room Nina was speaking her mind.\n\n\"You treat him like a dog,\" she said. \"Oh, I know you're civil to him,\nbut if any man looked at me the way Wallie looks at you--I don't know,\nthough,\" she added, thoughtfully. \"It may be that that is why he is so\nkeen. It may be good tactics. Most girls fall for him with a crash.\"\n\nBut when she glanced at Elizabeth she saw that she had not heard. Her\neyes were fixed on something on the street beyond the window. Nina\nlooked out. With a considerable rattle of loose joints and four\nextraordinarily worn tires the Livingstone car was going by.\n\n\n\n\nIV\n\nDavid did not sleep well that night. He had not had his golf after\nall, for the Homer baby had sent out his advance notice early in the\nafternoon, and had himself arrived on Sunday evening, at the hour when\nMinnie was winding her clock and preparing to retire early for the\nMonday washing, and the Sayre butler was announcing dinner. Dick had\ncome in at ten o'clock weary and triumphant, to announce that Richard\nLivingstone Homer, sex male, color white, weight nine pounds, had been\nsafely delivered into this vale of tears.\n\nDavid lay in the great walnut bed which had been his mother's, and read\nhis prayer book by the light of his evening lamp. He read the Evening\nPrayer and the Litany, and then at last he resorted to the thirty-nine\narticles, which usually had a soporific effect on him. But it was no\ngood.\n\nHe got up and took to pacing his room, a portly, solid old figure in\nstriped pajamas and the pair of knitted bedroom slippers which were\nalways Mrs. Morgan's Christmas offering. \"To Doctor David, with love and\na merry Xmas, from Angeline Morgan.\"\n\nAt last he got his keys from his trousers pocket and padded softly down\nthe stairs and into his office, where he drew the shade and turned on\nthe lights. Around him was the accumulated professional impedimenta of\nmany years; the old-fashioned surgical chair; the corner closet which\nhad been designed for china, and which held his instruments; the\nbookcase; his framed diplomas on the wall, their signatures faded, their\nseals a little dingy; his desk, from which Dick had removed the old\nledger which had held those erratic records from which, when he needed\nmoney, he had been wont--and reluctant--to make out his bills.\n\nThrough an open door was Dick's office, a neat place of shining linoleum\nand small glass stands, highly modern and business-like. Beyond the\noffice and opening from it was his laboratory, which had been the fruit\ncloset once, and into which Dick on occasion retired to fuss with slides\nand tubes and stains and a microscope.\n\nSometimes he called David in, and talked at length and with enthusiasm\nabout such human interest things as the Staphylococcus pyogenes aureus,\nand the Friedlander bacillus. The older man would listen, but his eyes\nwere oftener on Dick than on the microscope or the slide.\n\nDavid went to the bookcase and got down a large book, much worn, and\ncarried it to his desk.\n\nAn hour or so later he heard footsteps in the hall and closed the book\nhastily. It was Lucy, a wadded dressing gown over her nightdress and a\nglass of hot milk in her hand.\n\n\"You drink this and come to bed, David,\" she said peremptorily. \"I've\nbeen lying upstairs waiting for you to come up, and I need some sleep.\"\n\nHe had no sort of hope that she would not notice the book.\n\n\"I just got to thinking things over, Lucy,\" he explained, his tone\napologetic. \"There's no use pretending I'm not worried. I am.\"\n\n\"Well, it's in God's hands,\" she said, quite simply. \"Take this up and\ndrink it slowly. If you gulp it down it makes a lump in your stomach.\"\n\nShe stood by while he replaced the book in the bookcase and put out the\nlights. Then in the darkness she preceded him up the stairs.\n\n\"You'd better take the milk yourself, Lucy,\" he said. \"You're not\nsleeping either.\"\n\n\"I've had some. Good-night.\"\n\nHe went in and sitting on the side of his bed sipped at his milk. Lucy\nwas right. It was not in their hands. He had the feeling all at once of\nhaving relinquished a great burden. He crawled into bed and was almost\ninstantly asleep.\n\nSo sometime after midnight found David sleeping, and Lucy on her knees.\nIt found Elizabeth dreamlessly unconscious in her white bed, and Dick\nLivingstone asleep also, but in his clothing, and in a chair by the\nwindow. In the light from a street lamp his face showed lines of fatigue\nand nervous stress, lines only revealed when during sleep a man casts\noff the mask with which he protects his soul against even friendly eyes.\n\nBut midnight found others awake. It found Nina, for instance, in her\ndraped French bed, consulting her jeweled watch and listening for\nLeslie's return from the country club. An angry and rather heart-sick\nNina. And it found the night editor of one of the morning papers\ndrinking a cup of coffee that a boy had brought in, and running through\na mass of copy on his desk. He picked up several sheets of paper, with\na photograph clamped to them, and ran through them quickly. A man in a\nsoft hat, sitting on the desk, watched him idly.\n\n\"Beverly Carlysle,\" commented the night editor. \"Back with bells on!\" He\ntook up the photograph. \"Doesn't look much older, does she? It's a queer\nworld.\"\n\nLouis Bassett, star reporter and feature writer of the Times-Republican,\nsmiled reminiscently.\n\n\"She was a wonder,\" he said. \"I interviewed her once, and I was crazy\nabout her. She had the stage set for me, all right. The papers had been\nfull of the incident of Jud Clark and the night he lined up fifteen\nJohnnies in the lobby, each with a bouquet as big as a tub, all of them\nin top hats and Inverness coats, and standing in a row. So she played up\nthe heavy domestic for me; knitting or sewing, I forget.\"\n\n\"Fell for her, did you?\"\n\n\"Did I? That was ten years ago, and I'm not sure I'm over it yet.\"\n\n\"Probably that's the reason,\" said the city editor, drily. \"Go and see\nher, and get over it. Get her views on the flapper and bobbed hair, for\nnext Sunday. Smith would be crazy about it.\"\n\nHe finished his coffee.\n\n\"You might ask, too, what she thinks has become of Judson Clark,\" he\nadded. \"I have an idea she knows, if any one does.\" Bassett stared at\nhim.\n\n\"You're joking, aren't you?\"\n\n\"Yes. But it would make a darned good story.\"\n\n\n\n\nV\n\nWhen he finished medical college Dick Livingstone had found, like other\nmen, that the two paths of ambition and duty were parallel and did not\nmeet. Along one lay his desire to focus all his energy in one direction,\nto follow disease into the laboratory instead of the sick room, and\nthere to fight its unsung battles. And win. He felt that he would win.\n\nAlong the other lay David.\n\nIt was not until he had completed his course and had come home that he\nhad realized that David was growing old. Even then he might have felt\nthat, by the time David was compelled to relinquish his hold on his\npractice, he himself would be sufficiently established in his specialty\nto take over the support of the household. But here there was interposed\na new element, one he had not counted on. David was fiercely jealous of\nhis practice; the thought that it might pass into new and alien hands\nwas bitter to him. To hand it down to his adopted son was one thing; to\npass it over to \"some young whipper-snapper\" was another.\n\nNor were David's motives selfish or unworthy. His patients were his\nfriends. He had a sense of responsibility to them, and very little\nfaith in the new modern methods. He thought there was a great deal of\ntomfoolery about them, and he viewed the gradual loss of faith in drugs\nwith alarm. When Dick wore rubber gloves during their first obstetric\ncase together he snorted.\n\n\"I've delivered about half the population of this town,\" he said, \"and\nslapped 'em to make 'em breathe with my own bare hands. And I'm still\nhere and so are they.\"\n\nFor by that time Dick had made his decision. He could not abandon\nDavid. For him then and hereafter the routine of a general practice in a\nsuburban town, the long hours, the varied responsibilities, the feeling\nhe had sometimes that by doing many things passably he was doing none of\nthem well. But for compensation he had old David's content and greater\nleisure, and Lucy Crosby's gratitude and love.\n\nNow and then he chafed a little when he read some article in a medical\njournal by one of his fellow enthusiasts, or when, in France, he saw\nmen younger than himself obtaining an experience in their several\nspecialties that would enable them to reach wide fields at home. But\nmostly he was content, or at least resigned. He was building up the\nLivingstone practice, and his one anxiety was lest the time should come\nwhen more patients asked for Doctor Dick than for Doctor David. He did\nnot want David hurt.\n\nAfter ten years the strangeness of his situation had ceased to be\nstrange. Always he meant some time to go back to Norada, and there to\nclear up certain things, but it was a long journey, and he had very\nlittle time. And, as the years went on, the past seemed unimportant\ncompared with the present. He gave little thought to the future.\n\nThen, suddenly, his entire attention became focused on the future.\n\nJust when he had fallen in love with Elizabeth Wheeler he did not know.\nHe had gone away to the war, leaving her a little girl, apparently, and\nhe had come back to find her, a woman. He did not even know he was in\nlove, at first. It was when, one day, he found himself driving past the\nWheeler house without occasion that he began to grow uneasy.\n\nThe future at once became extraordinarily important and so also, but\nsomewhat less vitally, the past. Had he the right to marry, if he could\nmake her care for him?\n\nHe sat in his chair by the window the night after the Homer baby's\narrival, and faced his situation. Marriage meant many things. It meant\nlove and companionship, but it also meant, should mean, children. Had he\nthe right to go ahead and live his life fully and happily? Was there\nany chance that, out of the years behind him, there would come some\nforgotten thing, some taint or incident, to spoil the carefully woven\nfabric of his life?\n\nNot his life. Hers.\n\nOn the Monday night after he had asked Elizabeth to go to the theater\nhe went into David's office and closed the door. Lucy, alive to every\nmovement in the old house, heard him go in and, rocking in her chair\noverhead, her hands idle in her lap, waited in tense anxiety for the\ninterview to end. She thought she knew what Dick would ask, and what\nDavid would answer. And, in a way, David would be right. Dick, fine,\nlovable, upstanding Dick, had a right to the things other men had, to\nlove and a home of his own, to children, to his own full life.\n\nBut suppose Dick insisted on clearing everything up before he married?\nFor to Lucy it was unthinkable that any girl in her senses would refuse\nhim. Suppose he went back to Norada? He had not changed greatly in ten\nyears. He had been well known there, a conspicuous figure.\n\nHer mind began to turn on the possibility of keeping him away from\nNorada.\n\nSome time later she heard the office door open and then close with\nDick's characteristic slam. He came up the stairs, two at a time as\nwas his custom, and knocked at her door. When he came in she saw what\nDavid's answer had been, and she closed her eyes for an instant.\n\n\"Put on your things,\" he said gayly, \"and we'll take a ride on the\nhill-tops. I've arranged for a moon.\"\n\nAnd when she hesitated:\n\n\"It makes you sleep, you know. I'm going, if I have to ride alone and\ntalk to an imaginary lady beside me.\"\n\nShe rather imagined that that had been his first idea, modified by his\nthought of her. She went over and put a wrinkled hand on his arm.\n\n\"You look happy, Dick,\" she said wistfully.\n\n\"I am happy, Aunt Lucy,\" he replied, and bending over, kissed her.\n\nOn Wednesday he was in a state of alternating high spirits and periods\nof silence. Even Minnie noticed it.\n\n\"Mr. Dick's that queer I hardly know how to take him.\" she said to\nLucy. \"He came back and asked for noodle soup, and he put about all the\nhardware in the kitchen on him and said he was a knight in armor. And\nwhen I took the soup in he didn't eat it.\"\n\nIt was when he was ready to go out that Lucy's fears were realized. He\ncame in, as always when anything unusual was afoot, to let her look him\nover. He knew that she waited for him, to give his tie a final pat, to\ninspect the laundering of his shirt bosom, to pick imaginary threads off\nhis dinner coat.\n\n\"Well?\" he said, standing before her, \"how's this? Art can do no more,\nMrs. Crosby.\"\n\n\"I'll brush your back,\" she said, and brought the brush. He stooped to\nher, according to the little ceremony she had established, and she made\nlittle dabs at his speckless back. \"There, that's better.\"\n\nHe straightened.\n\n\"How do you think Uncle David is?\" he asked, unexpectedly.\n\n\"Better than he has been in years. Why?\"\n\n\"Because I'm thinking of taking a little trip. Only ten days,\" he added,\nseeing her face. \"You could house-clean my office while I'm away. You\nknow you've been wanting to.\"\n\nShe dropped the brush, and he stooped to pick it up. That gave her a\nmoment.\n\n\"'Where?\" she managed.\n\n\"To Dry River, by way of Norada.\"\n\n\"Why should you go back there?\" she asked, in a carefully suppressed\nvoice. \"Why don't you go East? You've wanted to go back to Johns Hopkins\nfor months?\"\n\n\"On the other hand, why shouldn't I go back to Norada?\" he asked, with\nan affectation of lightness. Then he put his hand on her shoulders. \"Why\nshouldn't I go back and clear things up in my own mind? Why shouldn't I\nfind out, for instance, that I am a free man?\"\n\n\"You are free.\"\n\n\"I've got to know,\" he said, almost doggedly. \"I can't take a chance. I\nbelieve I am. I believe David, of course. But anyhow I'd like to see the\nranch. I want to see Maggie Donaldson.\"\n\n\"She's not at the ranch. Her husband died, you know.\"\n\n\"I have an idea I can find her,\" he said. \"I'll make a good try,\nanyhow.\"\n\nWhen he had gone she got her salts bottle and lay down on her bed. Her\nheart was hammering wildly.\n\nElizabeth was waiting for him in the living-room, in the midst of\nher family. She looked absurdly young and very pretty, and he had a\nmomentary misgiving that he was old to her, and that--Heaven save the\nmark!--that she looked up to him. He considered the blue dress the\nheight of fashion and the mold of form, and having taken off his\novercoat in the hall, tried to put on Mr. Wheeler's instead in his\nexcitement. Also, becoming very dignified after the overcoat incident,\nand making an exit which should conceal his wild exultation and show\nonly polite pleasure, he stumbled over Micky, so that they finally\ndeparted to a series of staccato yelps.\n\nHe felt very hot and slightly ridiculous as he tucked Elizabeth into\nthe little car, being very particular about her feet, and starting\nwith extreme care, so as not to jar her. He had the feeling of being\nentrusted temporarily with something infinitely precious, and very, very\ndear. Something that must never suffer or be hurt.\n\n\n\n\n\nVI\n\n\nOn Wednesday morning David was in an office in the city. He sat\nforward on the edge of his chair, and from time to time he took out\nhis handkerchief and wiped his face or polished his glasses, quite\nunconscious of either action. He was in his best suit, with the tie Lucy\nhad given him for Christmas.\n\nAcross from him, barricaded behind a great mahogany desk, sat a small\nman with keen eyes and a neat brown beard. On the desk were a spotless\nblotter, an inkstand of silver and a pen. Nothing else. The terrible\norder of the place had at first rather oppressed David.\n\nThe small man was answering a question.\n\n\"Rather on the contrary, I should say. The stronger the character the\ngreater the smash.\"\n\nDavid pondered this.\n\n\"I've read all you've written on the subject,\" he said finally.\n\"Especially since the war.\"\n\nThe psycho-analyst put his finger tips together, judicially. \"Yes. The\nwar bore me out,\" he observed with a certain complacence. \"It added a\ngreat deal to our literature, too, although some of the positions are\nnot well taken. Van Alston, for instance--\"\n\n\"You have said, I think, that every man has a breaking point.\"\n\n\"Absolutely. All of us. We can go just so far. Where the mind is strong\nand very sound we can go further than when it is not. Some men, for\ninstance, lead lives that would break you or me. Was there--was there\nsuch a history in this case?\"\n\n\"Yes.\" Doctor David's voice was reluctant.\n\n\"The mind is a strange thing,\" went on the little man, musingly. \"It\nhas its censors, that go off duty during sleep. Our sternest and often\nunconscious repressions pass them then, and emerge in the form of\ndreams. But of course you know all that. Dream symbolism. Does\nthe person in this case dream? That would be interesting, perhaps\nimportant.\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" David said unhappily.\n\n\"The walling off, you say, followed a shock?\"\n\n\"Shock and serious illness.\"\n\n\"Was there fear with the shock?\"\n\nDavid hesitated. \"Yes,\" he said finally. \"Very great fear, I believe.\"\n\nDoctor Lauler glanced quickly at David and then looked away.\n\n\"I see,\" he nodded. \"Of course the walling off of a part of the\npast--you said a part--?\"\n\n\"Practically all of it. I'll tell you about that later. What about the\nwalling off?\"\n\n\"It is generally the result of what we call the protective mechanism of\nfear. Back of most of these cases lies fear. Not cowardice, but perhaps\nwe might say the limit of endurance. Fear is a complex, of course.\nDislike, in a small way, has the same reaction. We are apt to forget\nthe names of persons we dislike. But if you have been reading on the\nsubject--\"\n\n\"I've been studying it for ten years.\"\n\n\"Ten years! Do you mean that this condition has persisted for ten\nyears?\"\n\nDavid moistened his dry lips. \"Yes,\" he admitted. \"It might not have\ndone so, but the--the person who made this experiment used suggestion.\nThe patient was very ill, and weak. It was desirable that he should\nnot identify himself with his past. The loss of memory of the period\nimmediately preceding was complete, but of course, gradually, the cloud\nbegan to lift over the earlier periods. It was there that suggestion\nwas used, so that such memories as came back were,--well, the patient\nadapted them to fit what he was told.\"\n\nAgain Doctor Lauler shot a swift glance at David, and looked away.\n\n\"An interesting experiment,\" he commented. \"It must have taken courage.\"\n\n\"A justifiable experiment,\" David affirmed stoutly. \"And it took\ncourage. Yes.\"\n\nDavid got up and reached for his hat. Then he braced himself for the\nreal purpose of his visit.\n\n\"What I have been wondering about,\" he said, very carefully, \"is this:\nthis mechanism of fear, this wall--how strong is it?\"\n\n\"Strong?\"\n\n\"It's like a dam, I take it. It holds back certain memories, like a\nfloodgate. Is anything likely to break it down?\"\n\n\"Possibly something intimately connected with the forgotten period might\ndo it. I don't know, Livingstone. We've only commenced to dig into\nthe mind, and we have many theories and a few established facts. For\ninstance, the primal instincts--\"\n\nHe talked on, with David nodding now and then in apparent understanding,\nbut with his thoughts far away. He knew the theories; a good many of\nthem he considered poppycock. Dreams might come from the subconscious\nmind, but a good many of them came from the stomach. They might be\nsafety valves for the mind, but also they might be rarebit. He didn't\nwant dreams; what he wanted was facts. Facts and hope.\n\nThe office attendant came in. She was as tidy as the desk, as obsessed\nby order, as wooden. She placed a pad before the small man and withdrew.\nHe rose.\n\n\"Let me know if I can be of any further assistance, Doctor,\" he said.\n\"And I'll be glad to see your patient at any time. I'd like the record\nfor my files.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" David said. He stood fingering his hat.\n\n\"I suppose there's nothing to do? The dam will either break, or it\nwon't.\"\n\n\"That's about it. Of course since the conditions that produced the\nsetting up of the defensive machinery were unhappy, I'd say that\nhappiness will play a large part in the situation. That happiness and\na normal occupation will do a great deal to maintain the status quo.\nOf course I would advise no return to the unhappy environment, and no\nshocks. Nothing, in other words, to break down the wall.\"\n\nOutside, in the corridor, David remembered to put on his hat. Happiness\nand a normal occupation, yes. But no shock.\n\nNevertheless, he felt vaguely comforted, and as though it had helped to\nbring the situation out into the open and discuss it. He had carried his\nburden alone for ten years, or with only the additional weight of Lucy's\napprehensions. He wandered out into the city streets, and found himself,\nsome time later, at the railway station, without remembering how he got\nthere.\n\nAcross from the station was a large billboard, and on it the name of\nBeverly Carlysle and her play, \"The Valley.\" He stood for some time and\nlooked at it, before he went in to buy his ticket. Not until he was in\nthe train did he realize that he had forgotten to get his lunch.\n\nHe attended to his work that evening as usual, but he felt very tired,\nand Lucy, going in at nine o'clock, found him dozing in his chair, his\ncollar half choking him and his face deeply suffused. She wakened him\nand then, sitting down across from him, joined him in the vigil that was\nto last until they heard the car outside.\n\nShe had brought in her sewing, and David pretended to read. Now and then\nhe looked at his watch.\n\nAt midnight they heard the car go in, and the slamming of the stable\ndoor, followed by Dick's footsteps on the walk outside. Lucy was very\npale, and the hands that held her sewing twitched nervously. Suddenly\nshe stood up and put a hand on David's shoulder.\n\nDick was whistling on the kitchen porch.\n\n\n\n\nVII\n\nLouis Bassett was standing at the back of the theater, talking to the\npublicity man of The Valley company, Fred Gregory. Bassett was calm and\nonly slightly interested. By the end of the first act he had realized\nthat the star was giving a fine performance, that she had even grown in\npower, and that his sentimental memory of her was considerably dearer\nthan the reality.\n\n\"Going like a house afire,\" he said, as the curtain fell.\n\nBeside his robust physique, Gregory, the publicity man, sank into\ninsignificance. Even his pale spats, at which Bassett had shot a\ncontemptuous glance, his highly expensive tailoring, failed to make him\nappear more than he was, a little, dapper man, with a pale cold eye and\na rather too frequent smile. \"She's the best there is,\" was his comment.\nHe hesitated, then added: \"She's my sister, you know. Naturally, for\nbusiness reasons, I don't publish the relationship.\"\n\nBassett glanced at him.\n\n\"That so? Well, I'm glad she decided to come back. She's too good to\nbury.\"\n\nBut if he expected Gregory to follow the lead he was disappointed. His\neyes, blank and expressionless, were wandering over the house as the\nlights flashed up.\n\n\"This whole tour has been a triumph. She's the best there is,\" Gregory\nrepeated, \"and they know it.\"\n\n\"Does she know it?\" Bassett inquired.\n\n\"She doesn't throw any temperament, if that's what you mean. She--\"\n\nHe checked himself suddenly, and stood, clutching the railing, bent\nforward and staring into the audience. Bassett watched him, considerably\nsurprised. It took a great deal to startle a theatrical publicity man,\nyet here was one who looked as though he had seen a ghost.\n\nAfter a time Gregory straightened and moistened his dry lips.\n\n\"There's a man sitting down there--see here, the sixth row, next the\naisle; there's a girl in a blue dress beside him. See him? Do you know\nwho he is?\"\n\n\"Never saw him before.\"\n\nFor perhaps two minutes Gregory continued to stare. Then he moved over\nto the side of the house and braced against the wall continued his close\nand anxious inspection. After a time he turned away and, passing behind\nthe boxes, made his way into the wings. Bassett's curiosity was aroused,\nespecially when, shortly after, Gregory reappeared, bringing with him\na small man in an untidy suit who was probably, Bassett surmised, the\nstage manager.\n\nHe saw the small man stare, nod, stand watching, and finally disappear,\nand Gregory resume his former position and attitude against the side\nwall. Throughout the last act Gregory did not once look at the stage. He\ncontinued his steady, unwavering study of the man in the sixth row seat\nnext the aisle, and Bassett continued his study of the little man.\n\nHis long training made him quick to scent a story. He was not sure, of\ncourse, but the situation appeared to him at least suggestive. With the\nend of the play he wandered out with the crowd, edging his way close to\nthe man and girl who had focused Gregory's attention, and following them\ninto the street. He saw only a tall man with a certain quiet distinction\nof bearing, and a young and pretty girl, still flushed and excited, who\nwent up the street a short distance and got into a small and shabby car.\nBassett noted, carefully, the license number of the car.\n\nThen, still curious and extremely interested, he walked briskly around\nto the stage entrance, nodded to the doorkeeper, and went in.\n\nGregory was not in sight, but the stage manager was there, directing the\nstriking of the last set.\n\n\"I'm waiting for Gregory,\" Bassett said. \"Hasn't fainted, has he?\"\n\n\"What d'you mean, fainted?\" inquired the stage manager, with a touch of\nhostility.\n\n\"I was with him when he thought he recognized somebody. You know who.\nYou can tell him I got his automobile number.\"\n\nThe stage manager's hostility faded, and he fell into the trap. \"You\nknow about it, then?\"\n\n\"I was with him when he saw him. Unfortunately I couldn't help him out.\"\n\n\"It's just possible it's a chance resemblance. I'm darned if I know.\nLook at the facts! He's supposed to be dead. Ten years dead. His money's\nbeen split up a dozen ways from the ace. Then--I knew him, you know--I\ndon't think even he would have the courage to come here and sit through\na performance. Although,\" he added reflectively, \"Jud Clark had the\nnerve for anything.\"\n\nBassett gave him a cigar and went out into the alley way that led to the\nstreet. Once there, he stood still and softly whistled. Jud Clark! If\nthat was Judson Clark, he had the story of a lifetime.\n\nFor some time he walked the deserted streets of the city, thinking and\npuzzling over the possibility of Gregory's being right. Sometime after\nmidnight he went back to the office and to the filing room. There, for\ntwo hours, he sat reading closely old files of the paper, going through\nthem methodically and making occasional brief notes in a memorandum.\nThen, at two o'clock he put away the files, and sitting back, lighted a\ncigar.\n\nIt was all there; the enormous Clark fortune inherited by a boy who had\ngone mad about this same Beverly Carlysle; her marriage to her leading\nman, Howard Lucas; the subsequent killing of Lucas by Clark at his\nWyoming ranch, and Clark's escape into the mountains. The sensational\ndetails of Clark's infatuation, the drama of a crime and Clark's\nsubsequent escape, and the later certainty of his death in a mountain\nstorm had filled the newspapers of the time for weeks. Judson Clark had\nbeen famous, notorious, infamous and dead, all in less than two years. A\nshameful and somehow a pitiful story.\n\nBut if Judson Clark had died, the story still lived. Every so often it\ncame up again. Three years before he had been declared legally dead, and\nhis vast estates, as provided by the will of old Elihu Clark, had gone\nto universities and hospitals. But now and then came a rumor. Jud Clark\nwas living in India; he had a cattle ranch in Venezuela; he had been\nseen on the streets of New Orleans.\n\nBassett ran over the situation in his mind.\n\nFirst then, grant that Clark was still living and had been in the\ntheater that night. It became necessary to grant other things. To grant,\nfor instance, that Clark was capable of sitting, with a girl beside him,\nthrough a performance by the woman for whom he had wrecked his life, of\na play he had once known from the opening line to the tag. To grant that\nhe could laugh and applaud, and at the drop of the curtain go calmly\naway, with such memories behind him as must be his. To grant, too, that\nhe had survived miraculously his sensational disappearance, found a new\nidentity and a new place for himself; even, witness the girl, possible\nnew ties.\n\nAt half past two Bassett closed his memorandum book, stuffed it into his\npocket, and started for home. As he passed the Ardmore Hotel he looked\nup at its windows. Gregory would have told her, probably. He wondered,\nhalf amused, whether the stage manager had told him of his inquiries,\nand whether in that case they might not fear him more than Clark\nhimself. After all, they had nothing to fear from Clark, if this were\nClark.\n\nNo. What they might see and dread, knowing he had had a hint of a\npossible situation, was the revival of the old story she had tried so\nhard to live down. She was ambitious, and a new and rigid morality was\nsweeping the country. What once might have been an asset stood now to be\na bitter liability.\n\nHe slowed down, absorbed in deep thought. It was a queer story. It might\nbe even more queer than it seemed. Gregory had been frightened rather\nthan startled. The man had even gone pale.\n\nMotive, motive, that was the word. What motive lay behind action.\nConscious and unconscious, every volitional act was the result of\nmotive.\n\nHe wondered what she had done when Gregory had told her.\n\nAs a matter of fact, Beverly Carlysle had shown less anxiety than\nher brother. Still pale and shocked, he had gone directly to her\ndressing-room when the curtain was rung down, had tapped and gone in.\nShe was sitting wearily in a chair, a cigarette between her fingers.\nAround was the usual litter of a stage dressing-room after the play, the\nlong shelf beneath the mirror crowded with powders, rouge and pencils,\na bunch of roses in the corner washstand basin, a wardrobe trunk, and a\nmaid covering with cheese-cloth bags the evening's costumes.\n\n\"It went all right, I think, Fred.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" he said absently. \"Go on out, Alice. I'll let you come back in a\nfew minutes.\"\n\nHe waited until the door closed.\n\n\"What's the matter?\" she asked rather indifferently. \"If it's more\nquarreling in the company I don't want to hear it. I'm tired.\" Then she\ntook a full look at him, and sat up.\n\n\"Fred! What is it?\"\n\nHe gave her the truth, brutally and at once.\n\n\"I think Judson Clark was in the house to-night.\"\n\n\"I don't believe it.\"\n\n\"Neither would I, if somebody told me,\" he agreed sullenly. \"I saw\nhim. Don't you suppose I know him? And if you don't believe me, call\nSaunders. I got him out front. He knows.\"\n\n\"You called Saunders!\"\n\n\"Why not? I tell you, Bev, I was nearly crazy. I'm nearly crazy now.\"\n\n\"What did Saunders say?\"\n\n\"If he didn't know Clark was dead, he'd say it was Clark.\"\n\nShe was worried by that time, but far more collected than he was. She\nsat, absently tapping the shelf with a nail file, and reflecting.\n\n\"All right,\" she said. \"Suppose he was? What then? He has been in hiding\nfor ten years. Why shouldn't he continue to hide? What would bring him\nout now? Unless he needed money. Was he shabby?\"\n\n\"No,\" he said sulkily. \"He was with a girl. He was dressed all right.\"\n\n\"You didn't say anything, except to Saunders?\"\n\n\"No I'm not crazy.\"\n\n\"I'd better see Joe,\" she reflected. \"Go and get him, Fred. And tell\nAlice she needn't wait.\"\n\nShe got up and moved about the room, putting things away and finding\nrelief in movement, a still beautiful woman, with rather accentuated\nfeatures and an easy carriage. Without her make-up the stage illusion\nof her youth was gone, and she showed past suffering and present strain.\nJust then she was uneasy and resentful, startled but not particularly\nalarmed. Her reason told her that Judson Clark, even if he still lived\nand had been there that night, meant to leave the dead past to care for\nitself, and wished no more than she to revive it. She was surprised to\nfind, as she moved about, that she was trembling.\n\nHer brother came back, and she turned to meet him. To her surprise he\nwas standing inside the door, white to the lips and staring at her with\nwild eyes.\n\n\"Saunders!\" he said chokingly, \"Saunders, the damned fool! He's given it\naway.\"\n\nHe staggered to a chair, and ran a handkerchief across his shaking lips.\n\n\"He told Bassett, of the Times-Republican,\" he managed to say. \"Do\nyou--do you know what that means? And Bassett got Clark's automobile\nnumber. He said so.\"\n\nHe looked up at her, his face twitching. \"They're hound dogs on a scent,\nBev. They'll get the story, and blow it wide open.\"\n\n\"You know I'm prepared for that. I have been for ten years.\"\n\n\"I know.\" He was suddenly emotional. He reached out and took her hand.\n\"Poor old Bev!\" he said. \"After the way you've come back, too. It's a\ndamned shame.\"\n\nShe was calmer than he was, less convinced for one thing, and better\nbalanced always. She let him stroke her hand, standing near him with her\neyes absent and a little hard.\n\n\"I'd better make sure that was Jud first,\" he offered, after a time,\n\"and then warn him.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Bassett will be after him.\"\n\n\"No!\" she commanded sharply. \"No, Fred. You let the thing alone. You've\nbuilt up an imaginary situation, and you're not thinking straight.\nPlenty of things might happen. What probably has happened is that this\nBassett is at home and in bed.\"\n\nShe sent him out for a taxi soon after, and they went back to the hotel.\nBut, alone later on in her suite in the Ardmore she did not immediately\ngo to bed. She put on a dressing gown and stood for a long time by her\nwindow, looking out. Instead of the city lights, however, she saw a\nrange of snow-capped mountains, and sheltered at their foot the Clark\nranch house, built by the old millionaire as a place of occasional\nrefuge from the pressure of his life. There he had raised his fine\nhorses, and trained them for the track. There, when late in life he\nmarried, he had taken his wife for their honeymoon and two years later,\nfor the birth of their son. And there, when she died, he had returned\nwith the child, himself broken and prematurely aged, to be killed by one\nof his own stallions when the boy was fifteen.\n\nSix years his own master, Judson had been twenty-one to her twenty, when\nshe first met him. Going the usual pace, too, and throwing money right\nand left. He had financed her as a star, ransacking Europe for her\nstage properties, and then he fell in love with her. She shivered as she\nremembered it. It had been desperate and terrible, because she had cared\nfor some one else.\n\nStanding by the window, she wondered as she had done over and over again\nfor ten years, what would have happened if, instead of marrying Howard,\nshe had married Judson Clark? Would he have settled down? She had felt\nsometimes that in his wildest moments he was only playing a game that\namused him; that the hard-headed part of him inherited from his father\nsometimes stood off and watched, with a sort of interested detachment,\nthe follies of the other. That he played his wild game with his tongue\nin his cheek.\n\nShe left the window, turned out the lights and got into her bed. She\nwas depressed and lonely, and she cried a little. After a time she\nremembered that she had not put any cream on her face. She crawled out\nagain and went through the familiar motions in the dark.\n\n\n\n\nVIII\n\nDick rose the next morning with a sense of lightness and content that\nsent him singing into his shower. In the old stable which now housed\nboth Nettie and the little car Mike was washing them both with\nindiscriminate wavings of the hose nozzle, his old pipe clutched in\nhis teeth. From below there came up the odors of frying sausages and of\nstrong hot coffee.\n\nThe world was a good place. A fine old place. It had work and play and\nlove. It had office hours and visits and the golf links, and it had soft\nfeminine eyes and small tender figures to be always cared for and looked\nafter.\n\nShe liked him. She did not think he was old. She thought his profession\nwas the finest in the world. She had wondered if he would have time to\ncome and see her, some day. Time! He considered very seriously, as he\nshaved before the slightly distorted mirror in the bathroom, whether\nit would be too soon to run in that afternoon, just to see if she was\ntired, or had caught cold or anything? Perhaps to-morrow would look\nbetter. No, hang it all, to-day was to-day.\n\nOn his way from the bathroom to his bedroom he leaned over the\nstaircase.\n\n\"Aunt Lucy!\" he called.\n\n\"Yes, Dick?\"\n\n\"The top of the morning to you. D'you think Minnie would have time to\npress my blue trousers this morning?\"\n\nThere was the sound of her chair being pushed back in the dining-room,\nof a colloquy in the kitchen, and Minnie herself appeared below him.\n\n\"Just throw them down, Doctor Dick,\" she said. \"I've got an iron hot\nnow.\"\n\n\"Some day, Minnie,\" he announced, \"you will wear a halo and with the\nangels sing.\"\n\nThis mood of unreasoning happiness continued all morning. He went from\nhouse to house, properly grave and responsible but with a small song in\nhis heart, and about eleven o'clock he found time to stop at the village\nhaberdasher's and to select a new tie, which he had wrapped and stuffed\nin his pocket. And which, inspected in broad day later on a country\nroad, gave him uneasy qualms as to its brilliance.\n\nAt the luncheon table he was almost hilarious, and David played up to\nhim, albeit rather heavily. But Lucy was thoughtful and quiet. She had a\nsense of things somehow closing down on them, of hands reaching out from\nthe past, and clutching; Mrs. Morgan, Beverly Carlysle, Dick in love and\npossibly going back to Norada. Unlike David, who was content that one\nemergency had passed, she looked ahead and saw their common life a\nseries of such chances, with their anxieties and their dangers.\n\nShe could not eat.\n\nNevertheless when she herself admitted a new patient for Dick that\nafternoon, she had no premonition of trouble. She sent him into the\nwaiting-room, a tall, robust and youngish man, perhaps in his late\nthirties, and went quietly on her way to her sitting-room, and to her\nweekly mending.\n\nOn the other hand, Louis Bassett was feeling more or less uncomfortable.\nThere was an air of peace and quiet respectability about the old house,\na domestic odor of baking cake, a quietness and stability that somehow\nmade his errand appear absurd. To connect it with Judson Clark and his\ntumultuous past seemed ridiculous.\n\nHis errand, on the surface, was a neuralgic headache.\n\nWhen, hat in hand, he walked into Dick's consulting room, he had made up\nhis mind that he would pay the price of an overactive imagination for a\nprescription, walk out again, and try to forget that he had let a chance\nresemblance carry him off his feet.\n\nBut, as he watched the man who sat across from him, tilted back in his\nswivel chair, he was not so sure. Here was the same tall figure, the\nheavy brown hair, the features and boyish smile of the photograph he had\nseen the night before. As Judson Clark might have looked at thirty-two\nthis man looked.\n\nHe made his explanation easily. Was in town for the day. Subject to\nthese headaches. Worse over the right eye. No, he didn't wear glasses;\nperhaps he should.\n\nIt wasn't Clark. It couldn't be. Jud Clark sitting there tilted back\nin an old chair and asking questions as to the nature of his fictitious\npain! Impossible. Nevertheless he was of a mind to clear the slate and\nget some sleep that night, and having taken his prescription and paid\nfor it, he sat back and commenced an apparently casual interrogation.\n\n\"Two names on your sign, I see. Father and son, I suppose?\"\n\n\"Doctor David Livingstone is my uncle.\"\n\n\"I should think you'd be in the city. Limitations to this sort of thing,\naren't there?\"\n\n\"I like it,\" said Dick, with an eye on the office clock.\n\n\"Patients are your friends, of course. Born and raised here, I suppose?\"\n\n\"Not exactly. I was raised on a ranch in Wyoming. My father had a ranch\nout there.\"\n\nBassett shot a glance at him, but Dick was calm and faintly smiling.\n\n\"Wyoming!\" the reporter commented. \"That's a long way from here.\nAnywhere near the new oil fields?\"\n\n\"Not far from Norada. That's the oil center,\" Dick offered,\ngood-naturedly. He rose, and glanced again at the clock. \"If those\nheadaches continue you'd better have your eyes examined.\"\n\nBassett was puzzled. It seemed to him that there had been a shade of\nevasion in the other man's manner, slightly less frankness in his eyes.\nBut he showed no excitement, nothing furtive or alarmed. And the open\nand unsolicited statement as to Norada baffled him. He had to admit to\nhimself either that a man strongly resembling Judson Clark had come from\nthe same neighborhood, or--\n\n\"Norada?\" he said. \"That's where the big Clark ranch was located, wasn't\nit? Ever happen to meet Judson Clark?\"\n\n\"Our place was very isolated.\"\n\nBassett found himself being politely ushered out, considerably more at\nsea than when he went in and slightly irritated. His annoyance was not\ndecreased by the calm voice behind him which said:\n\n\"Better drink considerable water when you take that stuff. Some stomachs\ndon't tolerate it very well.\"\n\nThe door closed. The reporter stood in the waiting-room for a moment.\nThen he clapped on his hat.\n\n\"Well, I'm a damned fool,\" he muttered, and went out into the street.\n\nHe was disappointed and a trifle sheepish. Life was full of queer\nchances, that was all. No resemblance on earth, no coincidence of\nbirthplace, could make him believe that Judson Clark, waster, profligate\nand fugitive from the law was now sitting up at night with sick\nchildren, or delivering babies.\n\nAfter a time he remembered the prescription in his hand, and was about\nto destroy it. He stopped and examined it, and then carefully placed it\nin his pocket-book. After all, there were things that looked queer. The\nfellow had certainly evaded that last question of his.\n\nHe made his way, head bent, toward the station.\n\nHe had ten minutes to wait, and he wandered to the newsstand. He made\na casual inspection of its display, bought a newspaper and was turning\naway, when he stopped and gazed after a man who had just passed him from\nan out-bound train.\n\nThe reporter looked after him with amused interest. Gregory, too! The\nLivingstone chap had certainly started something. But it was odd, too.\nHow had Gregory traced him? Wasn't there something more in Gregory's\npresence there than met the eye? Gregory's visit might be, like his own,\nthe desire to satisfy himself that the man was or was not Clark. Or it\nmight be the result of a conviction that it was Clark, and a warning\nagainst himself. But if he had traced him, didn't that indicate that\nClark himself had got into communication with him? In other words, that\nthe chap was Clark, after all? Gregory, having made an inquiry of a\nhackman, had started along the street, and, after a moment's thought,\nBassett fell into line behind him. He was extremely interested and\nincreasingly cheerful. He remained well behind, and with his newspaper\nrolled in his hand assumed the easy yet brisk walk of the commuters\naround him, bound for home and their early suburban dinners.\n\nHalf way along Station Street Gregory stopped before the Livingstone\nhouse, read the sign, and rang the doorbell. The reporter slowed down,\nto give him time for admission, and then slowly passed. In front of\nHarrison Miller's house, however, he stopped and waited. He lighted a\ncigarette and made a careful survey of the old place. Strange, if this\nwere to prove the haven where Judson Clark had taken refuge, this old\nbrick two-story dwelling, with its ramshackle stable in the rear, its\nsmall vegetable garden, its casual beds of simple garden flowers set in\na half acre or so of ground.\n\nA doctor. A pill shooter. Jud Clark!\n\n\n\n\nIX\n\nElizabeth had gone about all day with a smile on her lips and a sort of\nexaltation in her eyes. She had, girl fashion, gone over and over the\ntotally uneventful evening they had spent together, remembering small\nspeeches and gestures; what he had said and she had answered.\n\nShe had, for instance, mentioned Clare Rossiter, very casually. Oh\nvery, very casually. And he had said: \"Clare Rossiter? Oh, yes, the tall\nblonde girl, isn't she?\"\n\nShe was very happy. He had not seemed to find her too young or\nparticularly immature. He had asked her opinion on quite important\nthings, and listened carefully when she replied. She felt, though, that\nshe knew about one-tenth as much as he did, and she determined to\nread very seriously from that time on. Her mother, missing her that\nafternoon, found her curled up in the library, beginning the first\nvolume of Gibbon's \"Rome\" with an air of determined concentration, and\nwearing her best summer frock.\n\nShe did not intend to depend purely on Gibbon's \"Rome,\" evidently.\n\n\"Are you expecting any one, Elizabeth?\" she asked, with the frank\ndirectness characteristic of mothers, and Elizabeth, fixing a date in\nher mind with terrible firmness, looked up absently and said:\n\n\"No one in particular.\"\n\nAt three o'clock, with a slight headache from concentration, she went\nupstairs and put up her hair again; rather high this time to make her\nfeel taller. Of course, it was not likely he would come. He was very\nbusy. So many people depended on him. It must be wonderful to be like\nthat, to have people needing one, and looking out of the door and\nsaying: \"I think I see him coming now.\"\n\nNevertheless when the postman rang her heart gave a small leap and then\nstood quite still. When Annie slowly mounted the stairs she was already\non her feet, but it was only a card announcing: \"Mrs. Sayre, Wednesday,\nMay fifteenth, luncheon at one-thirty.\"\n\nHowever, at half past four the bell rang again, and a masculine voice\ninformed Annie, a moment later, that it would put its overcoat here,\nbecause lately a dog had eaten a piece out of it and got most awful\nindigestion.\n\nThe time it took Annie to get up the stairs again gave her a moment\nso that she could breathe more naturally, and she went down very\ndeliberately and so dreadfully poised that at first he thought she was\nnot glad to see him.\n\n\"I came, you see,\" he said. \"I intended to wait until to-morrow, but I\nhad a little time. But if you're doing anything--\"\n\n\"I was reading Gibbon's 'Rome,'\" she informed him. \"I think every one\nshould know it. Don't you?\"\n\n\"Good heavens, what for?\" he inquired.\n\n\"I don't know.\" They looked at each other, and suddenly they laughed.\n\n\"I wanted to improve my mind,\" she explained. \"I felt, last night, that\nyou-that you know so many things, and that I was frightfully stupid.\"\n\n\"Do you mean to say,\" he asked, aghast, \"that I--! Great Scott!\"\n\nSettled in the living-room, they got back rather quickly to their status\nof the night before, and he was moved to confession.\n\n\"I didn't really intend to wait until to-morrow,\" he said. \"I got up\nwith the full intention of coming here to-day, if I did it over the\nwreck of my practice. At eleven o'clock this morning I held up a\nconsultation ten minutes to go to Yardsleys and buy a tie, for this\nexpress purpose. Perhaps you have noticed it already.\"\n\n\"I have indeed. It's a wonderful tie.\"\n\n\"Neat but not gaudy, eh?\" He grinned at her, happily. \"You know, you\nmight steer me a bit about my ties. I have the taste of an African\nsavage. I nearly bought a purple one, with red stripes. And Aunt Lucy\nthinks I should wear white lawn, like David!\"\n\nThey talked, those small, highly significant nothings which are only the\nbarrier behind which go on the eager questionings and unspoken answers\nof youth and love. They had known each other for years, had exchanged\nthe same give and take of neighborhood talk when they met as now. To-day\nnothing was changed, and everything.\n\nThen, out of a clear sky, he said:\n\n\"I may be going away before long, Elizabeth.\"\n\nHe was watching her intently. She had a singular feeling that behind\nthis, as behind everything that afternoon, was something not spoken.\nSomething that related to her. Perhaps it was because of his tone.\n\n\"You don't mean-not to stay?\"\n\n\"No. I want to go back to Wyoming. Where I was born. Only for a few\nweeks.\"\n\nAnd in that \"only for a few weeks\" there lay some of the unspoken\nthings. That he would miss her and come back quickly to her. That she\nwould miss him, and that subconsciously he knew it. And behind that,\ntoo, a promise. He would come back to her.\n\n\"Only for a few weeks,\" he repeated. \"I thought perhaps, if you wouldn't\nmind my writing to you, now and then--I write a rotten hand, you know.\nMost medical men do.\"\n\n\"I should like it very much,\" she said, primly.\n\nShe felt suddenly very lonely, as though he had already gone, and\nslightly resentful, not at him but at the way things happened. And then,\ntoo, everyone knew that once a Westerner always a Westerner. The West\nalways called its children. Not that she put it that way. But she had\na sort of vision, gained from the moving pictures, of a country of wide\nspaces and tall mountains, where men wore quaint clothing and the women\nrode wild horses and had the dash she knew she lacked. She was stirred\nby vague jealousy.\n\n\"You may never come back,\" she said, casually. \"After all, you were born\nthere, and we must seem very quiet to you.\"\n\n\"Quiet!\" he exclaimed. \"You are heavenly restful and comforting. You--\"\nhe checked himself and got up. \"Then I'm to write, and you are to make\nout as much of my scrawl as you can and answer. Is that right?\"\n\n\"I'll write you all the town gossip.\"\n\n\"If you do--!\" he threatened her. \"You're to write me what you're doing,\nand all about yourself. Remember, I'll be counting on you.\"\n\nAnd, if their voices were light, there was in both of them the sense\nof a pact made, of a bond that was to hold them, like clasped hands,\nagainst their coming separation. It was rather anti-climacteric after\nthat to have him acknowledge that he didn't know exactly when he could\nget away!\n\nShe went with him to the door and stood there, her soft hair blowing, as\nhe got into the car. When he looked back, as he turned the corner, she\nwas still there. He felt very happy affable, and he picked up an elderly\nvillage woman with her and went considerably out of his way to take her\nhome.\n\nHe got back to the office at half past six to find a red-eyed Minnie in\nthe hall.\n\n\n\n\nX\n\nAT half past five that afternoon David had let himself into the house\nwith his latch key, hung up his overcoat on the old walnut hat rack, and\nwent into his office. The strain of the days before had told on him, and\nhe felt weary and not entirely well. He had fallen asleep in his buggy,\nand had wakened to find old Nettie drawing him slowly down the main\nstreet of the town, pursuing an erratic but homeward course, while the\npeople on the pavements watched and smiled.\n\nHe went into his office, closed the door, and then, on the old leather\ncouch with its sagging springs he stretched himself out to finish his\nnap.\n\nAlmost immediately, however, the doorbell rang, and a moment later\nMinnie opened his door.\n\n\"Gentleman to see you, Doctor David.\"\n\nHe got up clumsily and settled his collar. Then he opened the door into\nhis waiting-room.\n\n\"Come in,\" he said resignedly.\n\nA small, dapper man, in precisely the type of clothes David most\nabominated, and wearing light-colored spats, rose from his chair and\nlooked at him with evident surprise.\n\n\"I'm afraid I've made a mistake. A Doctor Livingstone left his seat\nnumber for calls at the box office of the Annex Theater last night--the\nHappy Valley company--but he was a younger man. I--\"\n\nDavid stiffened, but he surveyed his visitor impassively from under his\nshaggy white eyebrows.\n\n\"I haven't been in a theater for a dozen years, sir.\"\n\nGregory was convinced that he had made a mistake. Like Louis Bassett,\nthe very unlikeliness of Jud Clark being connected with the domestic\natmosphere and quiet respectability of the old house made him feel\nintrusive and absurd. He was about to apologize and turn away, when he\nthought of something.\n\n\"There are two names on your sign. The other one, was he by any chance\nat the theater last night?\"\n\n\"I think I shall have to have a reason for these inquiries,\" David said\nslowly.\n\nHe was trying to place Gregory, to fit him into the situation; straining\nback over ten years of security, racking his memory, without result.\n\n\"Just what have you come to find out?\" he asked, as Gregory turned and\nlooked around the room.\n\n\"The other Doctor Livingstone is your brother?\"\n\n\"My nephew.\"\n\nGregory shot a sharp glance at him, but all he saw was an elderly man,\nwith heavy white hair and fierce shaggy eyebrows, a portly and dignified\nelderly gentleman, rather resentfully courteous.\n\n\"Sorry to trouble you,\" he said. \"I suppose I've made a mistake. I--is\nyour nephew at home?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"May I see a picture of him, if you have one?\"\n\nDavid's wild impulse was to smash Gregory to the earth, to annihilate\nhim. His collar felt tight, and he pulled it away from his throat.\n\n\"Not unless I know why you want to see it.\"\n\n\"He is tall, rather spare? And he took a young lady to the theater last\nnight?\" Gregory persisted.\n\n\"He answers that description. What of it?\"\n\n\"And he is your nephew?\"\n\n\"My brother's son,\" David said steadily.\n\nSomehow it began to dawn on him that there was nothing inimical in this\nstrange visitor, that he was anxious and ill at ease. There was, indeed,\nsomething almost beseeching in Gregory's eyes, as though he stood ready\nto give confidence for confidence. And, more than that, a sort of not\nunfriendly stubbornness, as though he had come to do something he meant\nto do.\n\n\"Sit down,\" he said, relaxing somewhat. \"Certainly my nephew is making\nno secret of the fact that he went to the theater last night. If you'll\ntell me who you are--\"\n\nBut Gregory did not sit down. He stood where he was, and continued to\neye David intently.\n\n\"I don't know just what it conveys to you, Doctor, but I am Beverly\nCarlysle's brother.\"\n\nDavid lowered himself into his chair. His knees were suddenly weak under\nhim. But he was able to control his voice.\n\n\"I see,\" he said. And waited.\n\n\"Something happened last night at the theater. It may be important. I'd\nhave to see your nephew, in order to find out if it is. I can't afford\nto make a mistake.\"\n\nDavid's ruddy color had faded. He opened a drawer of his desk and\nproduced a copy of the photograph of Dick in his uniform. \"Maybe this\nwill help you.\"\n\nGregory studied it carefully, carrying it to the window to do so. When\nhe confronted David again he was certain of himself and his errand for\nthe first time, and his manner had changed.\n\n\"Yes,\" he said, significantly. \"It does.\"\n\nHe placed the photograph on the desk, and sitting down, drew his chair\nclose to David's. \"I'll not use any names, Doctor. I think you know what\nI'm talking about. I was sure enough last night. I'm certain now.\"\n\nDavid nodded. \"Go on.\"\n\n\"We'll start like this. God knows I don't want to make any trouble. But\nI'll put a hypothetical case. Suppose that a man when drunk commits a\ncrime and then disappears; suppose he leaves behind him a bad record\nand an enormous fortune; suppose then he reforms and becomes a useful\ncitizen, and everything is buried.\"\n\nDoctor David listened stonily. Gregory lowered his voice.\n\n\"Suppose there's a woman mixed up in that situation. Not guiltily, but\nthere's a lot of talk. And suppose she lives it down, for ten years,\nand then goes back to her profession, in a play the families take the\nchildren to see, and makes good. It isn't hard to suppose that neither\nof those two people wants the thing revived, is it?\"\n\nDavid cleared his throat.\n\n\"You mean, then, that there is danger of such a revival?\"\n\n\"I think there is,\" Gregory said bitterly. \"I recognized this man last\nnight, and called a fellow who knew him in the old days, Saunders,\nour stage manager. And a newspaper man named Bassett wormed it out of\nSaunders. You know what that means.\"\n\nDavid heard him clearly, but as though from a great distance.\n\n\"You can see how it appears to Bassett. If he's found it, it's the big\nstory of a lifetime. I thought he'd better be warned.\"\n\nWhen David said nothing, but sat holding tight to the arms of his old\nchair, Gregory reached for his hat and got up.\n\n\"The thing for him to do,\" he said, \"is to leave town for a while. This\nBassett is a hound-hog on a scent. They all are. He is Bassett of the\nTimes-Republican. And he took Jud--he took your nephew's automobile\nlicense number.\"\n\nStill David sat silent, and Gregory moved to the door.\n\n\"Get him away, to-night if you can.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" David said. His voice was thick. \"I appreciate your\ncoming.\"\n\nHe got up dizzily, as Gregory said, \"Good-evening\" and went out. The\nroom seemed very dark and unsteady, and not familiar. So this was what\nhad happened, after all the safe years! A man could work and build and\npray, but if his house was built on the sand--\n\nAs the outer door closed David fell to the floor with a crash.\n\n\n\n\nXI\n\nBassett lounged outside the neat privet hedge which it was Harrison\nMiller's custom to clip with his own bachelor hands, and waited. And\nas he waited he tried to imagine what was going on inside, behind the\nneatly curtained windows of the old brick house.\n\nHe was tempted to ring the bell again, pretend to have forgotten\nsomething, and perhaps happen in on what might be drama of a rather high\norder; what, supposing the man was Clark after all, was fairly sure to\nbe drama. He discarded the idea, however, and began again his interested\nsurvey of the premises. Whoever conceived this sort of haven for Clark,\nif it were Clark, had shown considerable shrewdness. The town fairly\nsmelt of respectability; the tree-shaded streets, the children in socks\nand small crisp-laundered garments, the houses set back, each in its\nsquare of shaved lawn, all peaceful, middle class and unexciting. The\nlast town in the world for Judson Clark, the last profession, the last\nhouse, this shabby old brick before him.\n\nHe smiled rather grimly as he reflected that if Gregory had been right\nin his identification, he was, beyond those windows at that moment, very\npossibly warning Clark against himself. Gregory would know his type,\nthat he never let go. He drew himself up a little.\n\nThe house door opened, and Gregory came out, turning toward the station.\nBassett caught up with him and put a hand on his arm.\n\n\"Well?\" he said cheerfully. \"It was, wasn't it?\"\n\nGregory stopped dead and stared at him. Then:\n\n\"Old dog Tray!\" he said sneeringly. \"If your brain was as good as your\nnose, Bassett, you'd be a whale of a newspaper man.\"\n\n\"Don't bother about my brain. It's working fine to-day, anyhow. Well,\nwhat had he to say for himself?\"\n\nGregory's mind was busy, and he had had a moment to pull himself\ntogether.\n\n\"We both get off together,\" he said, more amiably. \"That fellow isn't\nJud Clark and never was. He's a doctor, and the nephew of the old doctor\nthere. They're in practice together.\"\n\n\"Did you see them both?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nBassett eyed him. Either Gregory was a good actor, or the whole trail\nended there after all. He himself had felt, after his interview, with\nDick, that the scent was false. And there was this to be said: Gregory\nhad been in the house scarcely ten minutes. Long enough to acknowledge a\nmistake, but hardly long enough for any dramatic identification. He was\nkeenly disappointed, but he had had long experience of disappointment,\nand after a moment he only said:\n\n\"Well, that's that. He certainly looked like Clark to me.\"\n\n\"I'll say he did.\"\n\n\"Rather surprised him, didn't you?\"\n\n\"Oh, he was all right,\" Gregory said. \"I didn't tell him anything, of\ncourse.\"\n\nBassett looked at his watch.\n\n\"I was after you, all right,\" he said, cheerfully. \"But if I was barking\nup the wrong tree, I'm done. I don't have to be hit on the head to\nmake me stop. Come and have a soda-water on me,\" he finished amiably.\n\"There's no train until seven.\"\n\nBut Gregory refused.\n\n\"No, thanks. I'll wander on down to the station and get a paper.\"\n\nThe reporter smiled. Gregory was holding a grudge against him, for a bad\nnight and a bad day.\n\n\"All right,\" he said affably. \"I'll see you at the train. I'll walk\nabout a bit.\"\n\nHe turned and started back up the street again, walking idly. His\nchagrin was very real. He hated to be fooled, and fooled he had been.\nGregory was not the only one who had lost a night's sleep. Then,\nunexpectedly, he was hailed from the curbstone, and he saw with\namazement that it was Dick Livingstone.\n\n\"Take you anywhere?\" Dick asked. \"How's the headache?\"\n\n\"Better, thanks.\" Bassett stared at him. \"No, I'm just walking around\nuntil train-time. Are you starting out or going home, at this hour?\"\n\n\"Going home. Well, glad the head's better.\"\n\nHe drove on, leaving the reporter gazing after him. So Gregory had\nbeen lying. He hadn't seen this chap at all. Then why--? He walked\non, turning this new phase of the situation over in his mind. Why\nthis elaborate fiction, if Gregory had merely gone in, waited for ten\nminutes, and come out again?\n\nIt wasn't reasonable. It wasn't logical. Something had happened inside\nthe house to convince Gregory that he was right. He had seen somebody,\nor something. He hadn't needed to lie. He could have said frankly\nthat he had seen no one. But no, he had built up a fabric carefully\ncalculated to throw Bassett off the scent.\n\nHe saw Dick stop in front of the house, get out and enter. And coming\nto a decision, he followed him and rang the doorbell. For a long time no\none answered. Then the maid of the afternoon opened the door, her eyes\nred with crying, and looked at him with hostility.\n\n\"Doctor Richard Livingstone?\"\n\n\"You can't see him.\"\n\n\"It's important.\"\n\n\"Well, you can't see him. Doctor David has just had a stroke. He's in\nthe office now, on the floor.\"\n\nShe closed the door on him, and he turned and went away. It was all\nclear to him; Gregory had seen, not Clark, but the older man; had told\nhim and gone away. And under the shock the older man had collapsed. That\nwas sad. It was very sad. But it was also extremely convincing.\n\nHe sat up late that night again, running over the entries in his\nnotebook. The old story, as he pieced it out, ran like this:\n\nIt had been twelve years ago, when, according to the old files,\nClark had financed Beverly Carlysle's first starring venture. He had,\napparently, started out in the beginning only to give her the publicity\nshe needed. In devising it, however, he had shown a sort of boyish\nrecklessness and ingenuity that had caught the interest of the press,\nand set newspaper men to chuckling wherever they got together.\n\nHe had got together a dozen or so of young men like himself, wealthy,\nidle and reckless with youth, and, headed by him, they had made the\nexploitation of the young star an occupation. The newspapers referred\nto the star and her constellation as Beverly Carlysle and her Broadway\nBeauties. It had been unvicious, young, and highly entertaining, and it\nhad cost Judson Clark his membership in his father's conservative old\nclubs.\n\nFor a time it livened the theatrical world with escapades that were\nharmless enough, if sensational. Then, after a time, newspaper row began\nto whisper that young Clark was in love with the girl. The Broadway\nBeauties broke up, after a wild farewell dinner. The audiences ceased\nto expect a row of a dozen youths, all dressed alike with gardenias in\ntheir buttonholes and perhaps red neckties with their evening suits, to\nrise in their boxes on the star's appearance and solemnly bow. And the\nstar herself lost a little of the anxious look she frequently wore.\n\nThe story went, after a while, that Judson Clark had been refused, and\nwas taking his refusal badly. Reporters saw him, carelessly dressed,\noutside the stage door waiting, and the story went that the girl had\nthrown him over, money and all, for her leading man. One thing was\nclear; Clark, not a drinker before, had taken to drinking hard, and\nafter a time, and some unpleasant scenes probably, she refused to see\nhim any more.\n\nWhen the play closed, in June, 1911, she married Howard Lucas,\nher leading man; his third wife. Lucas had been not a bad chap, a\ngood-looking, rather negligible man, given to all-day Sunday poker,\ncarefully valeted, not very keen mentally, but amiable. They had bought\na house on East Fifty-sixth Street, and were looking for a new play\nwith Lucas as co-star, when he unaccountably went to pieces nervously,\nstopped sleeping, and developed a slight twitching of his handsome,\nrather vacuous face.\n\nJudson Clark had taken his yacht and gone to Europe, and was reported\nfrom here and there not too favorably. But when he came back, in early\nSeptember, he had apparently recovered from his infatuation, was his\nold, carefully dressed self again, and when interviewed declared his\nintention of spending the winter on his Wyoming ranch.\n\nOf course he must have heard of Lucas's breakdown, and equally, of\ncourse, he must have seen them both. What happened at that interview, by\nwhat casual attitude he allayed Lucas's probable jealousy and the girl's\nown nervousness, Bassett had no way of discovering. It was clear that\nhe convinced them both of his good faith, for the next note in the\nreporter's book was simply a date, September 12, 1911.\n\nThat was the day they had all started West together, traveling in\nClark's private car, with Lucas, twitching slightly, smiling and waving\nfarewell from a window.\n\nThe big smash did not come until the middle of October.\n\nBassett sat back and considered. He had a fairly clear idea of the\nconditions at the ranch; daily riding, some little reading, and a great\ndeal too much of each other. A sick man, too, unhappy in his exile,\nchafing against his restrictions, lonely and irritable. The girl, early\nseeing her mistake, and Clark's jealousy of her husband. The door into\ntheir apartment closing, the thousand and one unconscious intimacies\nbetween man and wife, the breakfast for two going up the stairs, and\nbelow that hot-eyed boy, agonized and passionately jealous, yet meeting\nthem and looking after them, their host and a gentleman.\n\nLucas took to drinking, after a time, to allay his sheer boredom. And\nJud Clark drank with him. At the end of three weeks they were both\ndrinking heavily, and were politely quarrelsome. Bassett could fill\nthat in also. He could see the girl protesting, watching, increasingly\nanxious as she saw that Clark's jealousy was matched by her husband's.\n\nA queer picture, he reflected, the three of them shut away on the great\nranch, and every day some new tension, some new strain.\n\nThen, one night at dinner, they quarreled, and Beverly left the table.\nShe was going to pack her things and go back to New York. She had felt,\nprobably, that something was bound to snap. And while she was upstairs\nClark had shot and killed Howard Lucas, and himself disappeared.\n\nHe had run, testimony at the inquest revealed, to the corral, and\nsaddled a horse. Although it was only October, it was snowing hard,\nbut in spite of that he had turned his horse toward the mountains. By\nmidnight a posse from Norada had started out, and another up the Dry\nRiver Canyon, but the storm turned into a blizzard in the mountains, and\nthey were obliged to turn back. A few inches more snow, and they could\nnot have got their horses out. A week or so later, with a crust of ice\nover it, a few of them began again, with no expectation, however, of\nfinding Clark alive. They came across his horse on the second day, but\nthey did not find him, and there were some among them who felt that,\nafter all, old Elihu Clark's boy had chosen the better way.\n\nBassett closed his notebook and lighted a cigar.\n\nThere was a big story to be had for the seeking, a whale of a story. He\ncould go to the office, give them a hint, draw expense money and start\nfor Norada the next night. He knew well enough that he would have to\nbegin there, and that it would not be easy. Witnesses of the affair\nat the ranch would be missing now, or when found the first accuracy of\ntheir statements would either be dulled by time or have been added to\nwith the passing years. The ranch itself might have passed into other\nhands. To reconstruct the events of ten years ago might be impossible,\nor nearly so. But that was not his problem. He would have to connect\nNorada with Haverly, Clark with Livingstone. One thing only was simple.\nIf he found Livingstone's story was correct, that he had lived on a\nranch near Norada before the crime and as Livingstone, then he would\nacknowledge that two men could look precisely alike and come from the\nsame place, and yet not be the same. If not--\n\nBut, after he had turned out his light and got into bed, he began to\nfeel a certain distaste for his self-appointed task. If Livingstone\nwere Clark, if after years of effort he had pulled himself up by his own\nboot-straps, had made himself a man out of the reckless boy he had been,\na decent and useful citizen, why pull him down? After all, the world\nhadn't lost much in Lucas; a sleek, not over-intelligent big animal,\nthat had been Howard Lucas.\n\nHe decided to sleep over it, and by morning he found himself not only\ndisinclined to the business, but firmly resolved to let it drop. Things\nwere well enough as they were. The woman in the case was making good.\nJud was making good. And nothing would restore Howard Lucas to that\nsmall theatrical world of his which had waved him good-bye at the\nstation so long ago.\n\nHe shaved and dressed, his resolution still holding. He had indeed\nalmost a conscious glow of virtue, for he was making one of those\ninglorious and unsung sacrifices which ought to bring a man credit in\nthe next world, because they certainly got him nowhere in this. He was\nquite affable to the colored waiter who served his breakfasts in the\nbachelor apartment house, and increased his weekly tip to a dollar and a\nhalf. Then he sat down and opened the Times-Republican, skimming over\nit after his habit for his own space, and frowning over a row of\nexclamation and interrogation points unwittingly set behind the name of\nthe mayor.\n\nOn the second page, however, he stopped, coffee cup in air. \"Is Judson\nClark alive? Wife of former ranch manager makes confession.\"\n\nA woman named Margaret Donaldson, it appeared, fatally injured by an\nautomobile near the town of Norada, Wyoming, had made a confession on\nher deathbed. In it she stated that, afraid to die without shriving her\nsoul, she had sent for the sheriff of Dallas County and had made the\nfollowing confession:\n\nThat following the tragedy at the Clark ranch her husband, John\nDonaldson, since dead, had immediately following the inquest, where he\ntestified, started out into the mountains in the hope of finding Clark\nalive, as he knew of a deserted ranger's cabin where Clark sometimes\ncamped when hunting. It was his intention to search for Clark at this\ncabin and effect his escape. He carried with him food and brandy.\n\nThat, owing to the blizzard, he was very nearly frozen; that he was\nobliged to abandon his horse, shooting it before he did so, and that,\nclose to death himself, he finally reached the cabin and there found\nJudson Clark, the fugitive, who was very ill.\n\nShe further testified that her husband cared for Clark for four days,\nClark being delirious at the time, and that on the fifth day he started\nback on foot for the Clark ranch, having left Clark locked in the cabin,\nand that on the following night he took three horses, two saddled, and\none packed with food and supplies. That accompanied by herself they went\nback to the cabin in the mountains and that she remained there to\ncare for Clark, while her husband returned to the ranch, to prevent\nsuspicion.\n\nThat, a day or so later, looking out of her window, she had perceived\na man outside in the snow coming toward the cabin, and that she had\nthought it one of the searching party. That her first instinct had been\nto lock him outside, but that she had finally admitted him, and that\nthereafter he had remained and had helped her to care for the sick man.\n\nUnfortunately for the rest of the narrative it appeared that the injured\nwoman had here lapsed into a coma, and had subsequently died, carrying\nher further knowledge with her.\n\nBut, the article went on, the story opened a field of infinite surmise.\nIn all probability Judson Clark was still alive, living under some\nassumed identity, free of punishment, outwardly respectable. Three years\nbefore he had been adjudged legally dead, and the estate divided, under\nbond of the legatees.\n\nClose to a hundred million dollars had gone to charities, and Judson\nClark, wherever he was, would be dependent on his own efforts for\nexistence. He could have summoned all the legal talent in the country to\nhis defense, but instead he had chosen to disappear.\n\nThe whole situation turned on the deposition of Mrs. Donaldson, now\ndead. The local authorities at Norada maintained that the woman had not\nbeen sane for several years. On the other hand, the cabin to which she\nreferred was well known, and no search of it had been made at the time.\nClark's horse had been found not ten miles from the town, and the cabin\nwas buried in snow twenty miles further away. If Clark had made that\njourney on foot he had accomplished the impossible.\n\nCertain facts, according to the local correspondent, bore out Margaret\nDonaldson's confession. Inquiry showed that she was supposed to have\nspent the winter following Judson Clark's crime with relatives in Omaha.\nShe had returned to the ranch the following spring.\n\nA detailed description of Judson Clark, and a photograph of him\naccompanied the story. Bassett re-read the article carefully, and\nswore a little, under his breath. If he had needed confirmation of\nhis suspicions, it lay to his hand. But the situation had changed over\nnight. There would be a search for Clark now, as wide as the knowledge\nof his disappearance. Local police authorities would turn him up in\nevery city from Maine to the Pacific coast. Even Europe would be on the\nlookout and South America.\n\nBut it was not the police he feared so much as the press. Not all of the\npapers, but some of them, would go after that story, and send their best\nmen on it. It offered not so much a chance of solution as an opportunity\nto revive the old dramatic story. He could see, when he closed his eyes,\nthe local photographers climbing to that cabin and later sending its\npictures broadcast, and divers gentlemen of the press, eager to\npit their wits against ten years of time and the ability of a once\nconspicuous man to hide from the law, packing their suitcases for\nNorada.\n\nNo, he couldn't stop now. He would go on, like the others, and with this\nadvantage, that he was morally certain he could lay his hands on Clark\nat any time. But he would have to prove his case, connect it. Who, for\ninstance, was the other man in the cabin? He must have known who the boy\nwas who lay in that rough bunk, delirious. Must have suspected anyhow.\nThat made him, like the Donaldsons, accessory after the fact, and\ncriminally liable. Small chance of him coming out with any confession.\nYet he was the connecting link. Must be.\n\nOn his third reading the reporter began to visualize the human elements\nof the fight to save the boy; he saw moving before him the whole pitiful\nstruggle; the indomitable ranch manager, his heart-breaking struggle\nwith the blizzard, the shooting of his horse, the careful disarming of\nsuspicion, and later the intrepid woman, daring that night ride through\nsnow that had sent the posse back to its firesides to the boy, locked in\nthe cabin and raving.\n\nHis mind was busy as he packed his suitcase. Already he had forgotten\nhis compunctions of the early morning; he moved about methodically,\ncalculating roughly what expense money he would need, and the line of\nattack, if any, required at the office. Between Norada and that old\nbrick house at Haverly lay his story. Ten years of it. He was closing\nhis bag when he remembered the little girl in the blue dress, at the\ntheater. He straightened and scowled. After a moment he snapped the bag\nshut. Damn it all, if Clark had chosen to tie up with a girl, that was on\nClark's conscience, not his.\n\nBut he was vaguely uncomfortable.\n\n\"It's a queer world, Joe,\" he observed to the waiter, who had come in\nfor the breakfast dishes.\n\n\n\"Yes, sir. It is that,\" said Joe.\n\n\n\n\nXII\n\nDURING all the long night Dick sat by David's bedside. Earlier in\nthe evening there had been a consultation; David had suffered a light\nstroke, but there was no paralysis, and the prognosis was good. For this\ntime, at least, David had escaped, but there must be no other time. He\nwas to be kept quiet and free from worry, his diet was to be carefully\nregulated, and with care he still had long years before him.\n\nDavid slept, his breathing heavy and slow. In the morning there would\nbe a nurse, but that night Dick, having sent Lucy to bed, himself\nkept watch. On the walnut bed lay Doctor David's portly figure, dimly\noutlined by the shaded lamp, and on a chair drawn close sat Dick.\n\nHe was wide-awake and very anxious, but as time went on and no untoward\nsymptoms appeared, as David's sleep seemed to grow easier and more\nnatural, Dick's thoughts wandered. They went to Elizabeth first, and\nthen on and on from that starting point, through the years ahead. He saw\nthe old house with Elizabeth waiting in it for his return; he saw both\ntheir lives united and flowing on together, with children, with small\ncares, with the routine of daily living, and behind it all the two of\nthem, hand in hand.\n\nThen his mind turned on himself. How often in the past ten years it had\ndone that! He had sat off, with a sort of professional detachment,\nand studied his own case. With the entrance into his world of the new\nscience of psycho-analysis he had made now and then small, not very\nsincere, attempts to penetrate the veil of his own unconscious devising.\nNot very sincere, for with the increase of his own knowledge of the mind\nhe had learned that behind such conditions as his lay generally,\ndeeply hidden, the desire to forget. And that behind that there lay,\nacknowledged or not, fear.\n\n\"But to forget what?\" he used to say to David, when the first text-books\non the new science appeared, and he and David were learning the\nnew terminology, Dick eagerly and David with contemptuous snorts of\nderision. \"To forget what?\"\n\n\"You had plenty to forget,\" David would say, stolidly. \"I think this\nman's a fool, but at that--you'd had your father's death, for one thing.\nAnd you'd gone pretty close to the edge of eternity yourself. You'd\nfought single-handed the worst storm of ten years, you came out of it\nwith double pneumonia, and you lay alone in that cabin about fifty-six\nhours. Forget! You had plenty to forget.\"\n\nIt had never occurred to Dick to doubt David's story. It did not, even\nnow. He had accepted it unquestioningly from the first, supplemented the\nshadowy childish memories that remained to him with it, and gradually\nco-ordinating the two had built out of them his house of the past.\n\nThus, the elderly man whom he dimly remembered was not only his father;\nhe was David's brother. And he had died. It was the shock of that death,\naccording to David, that had sent him into the mountains, where David\nhad followed and nursed him back to health.\n\nIt was quite simple, and even explicable by the new psychology. Not that\nhe had worried about the new psychology in those early days. He had\nbeen profoundly lethargic, passive and incurious. It had been too much\ntrouble even to think.\n\nTrue, he had brought over from those lost years certain instincts and a\nfew mental pictures. He had had a certain impatience at first over the\nrestrictions of comparative poverty; he had had to learn the value of\nmoney. And the pictures he retained had had a certain opulence which the\nfacts appeared to contradict. Thus he remembered a large ranch house,\nand innumerable horses, grazing in meadows or milling in a corral. But\nDavid had warned him early that there was no estate; that his future\ndepended entirely on his own efforts.\n\nThen the new life had caught and held him. For the first time he had\nmothering and love. Lucy was his mother, and David the pattern to which\nhe meant to conform. He was happy and contented.\n\nNow and then, in the early days, he had been conscious of a desire to go\nback and try to reconstruct his past again. Later on he knew that if\nhe were ever to fill up the gap in his life, it would be easier in that\nenvironment of once familiar things. But in the first days he had been\ntotally dependent on David, and money was none too plentiful. Later on,\nas the new life took hold, as he went to medical college and worked at\nodd clerical jobs in vacations to help pay his way, there had been\nno chance. Then the war came, and on his return there had been the\npractice, and his knowledge that David's health was not what it should\nhave been.\n\nBut as time went on he was more and more aware that there was in him a\npeculiar shrinking from going back, an almost apprehension. He knew more\nof the mind than he had before, and he knew that not physical hardship,\nbut mental stress, caused such lapses as his. But what mental stress had\nbeen great enough for such a smash? His father's death?\n\nStrain and fear, said the new psychology. Fear? He had never found\nhimself lacking in courage. Certainly he would have fought a man who\ncalled him a coward. But there was cowardice behind all such conditions\nas his; a refusal of the mind to face reality. It was weak. Weak. He\nhated himself for that past failure of his to face reality.\n\nBut that night, sitting by David's bed, he faced reality with a\nvengeance. He was in love, and he wanted the things that love should\nbring to a normal man. He felt normal. He felt, strengthened by love,\nthat he could face whatever life had to bring, so long as also it\nbrought Elizabeth.\n\nPainfully he went back over his talk with David the preceding Sunday\nnight.\n\n\"Don't be a fool,\" David had said. \"Go ahead and take her, if she'll\nhave you. And don't be too long about it. I'm not as young as I used to\nbe.\"\n\n\"What I feel,\" he had replied, \"is this: I don't know, of course, if she\ncares.\" David had grunted. \"I do know I'm going to try to make her care,\nif it--if it's humanly possible. But I'd like to go back to the ranch\nagain, David, before things go any further.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"I'd like to fill the gap. Attempt it anyhow.\"\n\nWhat he was thinking about, as he sat by David's bedside, was David's\nattitude toward that threatened return of his. For David had opposed it,\noffering a dozen trivial, almost puerile reasons. Had shown indeed, a\ndogged obstinacy and an irritability that were somehow oddly like fear.\nDavid afraid! David, whose life and heart were open books! David, whose\neyes never wavered, nor his courage!\n\n\"You let well enough alone, Dick,\" he had finished. \"You've got\neverything you want. And a medical man can't afford to go gadding about.\nWhen people want him they want him.\"\n\nBut he had noticed that David had been different, since. He had taken to\nfollowing him with his faded old eyes, had even spoken once of retiring\nand turning all the work over to him. Was it possible that David did not\nwant him to go back to Norada?\n\nHe bent over and felt the sick man's pulse. It was stronger, not so\nrapid. The mechanical act took him back to his first memory of David.\n\nHe had been lying in a rough bunk in the mountain cabin, and David,\nbeside him on a wooden box, had been bending forward and feeling his\npulse. He had felt weak and utterly inert, and he knew now that he\nhad been very ill. The cabin had been a small and lonely one, with\nsnow-peaks not far above it, and it had been very cold. During the day\na woman kept up the fire. Her name was Maggie, and she moved about the\ncabin like a thin ghost. At night she slept in a lean-to shed and David\nkept the fire going. A man who seemed to know him well--John Donaldson,\nhe learned, was his name--was Maggie's husband, and every so often he\ncame, about dawn, and brought food and supplies.\n\nAfter a long time, as he grew stronger, Maggie had gone away, and David\nhad fried the bacon and heated the canned tomatoes or the beans. Before\nshe left she had written out a recipe for biscuits, and David would\nstudy over it painstakingly, and then produce a panfull of burned and\nblackened lumps, over which he would groan and agonize.\n\nHe himself had been totally incurious. He had lived a sort of animal\nlife of food and sleep, and later on of small tentative excursions\naround the room on legs that shook when he walked. The snows came and\nalmost covered the cabin, and David had read a great deal, and talked at\nintervals. David had tried to fill up the gap in his mind. That was how\nhe learned that David was his father's brother, and that his father had\nrecently died.\n\nGoing over it all now, it had certain elements that were not clear. They\nhad, for instance, never gone back to the ranch at all. With the first\nclearing of the snow in the spring John Donaldson had appeared again,\nleading two saddled horses and driving a pack animal, and they had\nstarted off, leaving him standing in the clearing and gazing after them.\nBut they had not followed Donaldson's trail. They had started West, over\nthe mountains, and David did not know the country. Once they were lost\nfor three days.\n\nHe looked at the figure on the bed. Only ten years, and yet at that time\nDavid had been vigorous, seemed almost young. He had aged in that ten\nyears. On the bed he was an old man, a tired old man at that. On that\nlong ride he had been tireless. He had taken the burden of the nightly\ncamps, and had hacked a trail with his hatchet across snow fields while\nDick, still weak but furiously protesting, had been compelled to stand\nand watch.\n\nNow, with the perspective of time behind him, and with the clearly\ndefined issue of David's protest against his return to the West, he went\nagain over the details of that winter and spring. Why had they not taken\nDonaldson's trail? Or gone back to the ranch? Why, since Donaldson\ncould make it, had not other visitors come? Another doctor, the night\nhe almost died, and David sat under the lamp behind the close-screened\nwindows, and read the very pocket prayer-book that now lay on the stand\nbeside the bed? Why had they burned his clothes, and Donaldson brought\na new outfit? Why did Donaldson, for all his requests, never bring a\nrazor, so that when they struck the railroad, miles from anywhere, they\nwere both full bearded?\n\nHe brought himself up sharply. He had allowed his imagination to run\naway with him. He had been depicting a flight and no one who knew David\ncould imagine him in flight.\n\nNevertheless he was conscious of a new uneasiness and anxiety. When\nDavid recovered sufficiently he would go to Norada, as he had told\nElizabeth, and there he would find the Donaldsons, and clear up the\nthings that bothered him. After that--\n\nHe thought of Elizabeth, of her sweetness and sanity. He remembered her\nat the theater the evening before, lost in its fictitious emotions, its\ncounterfeit drama. He had felt moved to comfort her, when he found her\non the verge of tears.\n\n\"Just remember, they're only acting,\" he had said.\n\n\"Yes. But life does do things like that to people.\"\n\n\"Not often. The theater deals in the dramatic exceptions to life. You\nand I, plain bread and butter people, come to see these things because\nwe get a sort of vicarious thrill out of them.\"\n\n\"Doesn't anything ever happen to the plain bread and butter people?\"\n\n\"A little jam, sometimes. Or perhaps they drop it, butter side down, on\nthe carpet.\"\n\n\"But that is tragedy, isn't it?\"\n\nHe had had to acknowledge that it might be. But he had been quite\nemphatic over the fact that most people didn't drop it.\n\nAfter a long time he slept in his chair. The spring wind came in through\nthe opened window, and fluttered the leaves of the old prayer-book on\nthe stand.\n\n\n\n\nXIII\n\nThe week that followed was an anxious one. David's physical condition\nslowly improved. The slight thickness was gone from his speech, and he\nsipped resignedly at the broths Lucy or the nurse brought at regular\nintervals. Over the entire house there hung all day the odor of stewing\nchicken or of beef tea in the making, and above the doorbell was a white\ncard which said: \"Don't ring. Walk in.\"\n\nAs it happened, no one in the old house had seen Maggie Donaldson's\nconfession in the newspaper. Lucy was saved that anxiety, at least.\nAppearing, as it did, the morning after David's stroke, it came in with\nthe morning milk, lay about unnoticed, and passed out again, to start\na fire or line a pantry shelf. Harrison Miller, next door, read it over\nhis coffee. Walter Wheeler in the eight-thirty train glanced at it and\nglanced away. Nina Ward read it in bed. And that was all.\n\nThere came to the house a steady procession of inquirers and bearers\nof small tribute, flowers and jellies mostly, but other things also.\nA table in David's room held a steadily growing number of bedroom\nslippers, and Mrs. Morgan had been seen buying soles for still others.\nDavid, propped up in his bed, would cheer a little at these votive\nofferings, and then relapse again into the heavy troubled silence that\nworried Dick and frightened Lucy Crosby. Something had happened, she was\nsure. Something connected with Dick. She watched David when Dick was\nin the room, and she saw that his eyes followed the younger man with\nsomething very like terror.\n\nAnd for the first time since he had walked into the house that night so\nlong ago, followed by the tall young man for whose coming a letter had\nprepared her, she felt that David had withdrawn himself from her. She\nwent about her daily tasks a little hurt, and waited for him to choose\nhis own time. But, as the days went on, she saw that whatever this new\nthing might be, he meant to fight it out alone, and that the fighting it\nout alone was bad for him. He improved very slowly.\n\nShe wondered, sometimes, if it was after all because of Dick's growing\ninterest in Elizabeth Wheeler. She knew that he was seeing her daily,\nalthough he was too busy now for more than a hasty call. She felt that\nshe could even tell when he had seen her; he would come in, glowing and\nalmost exalted, and, as if to make up for the moments stolen from David,\nwould leap up the stairs two at a time and burst into the invalid's room\nlike a cheerful cyclone. Wasn't it possible that David had begun to\nfeel as she did, that the girl was entitled to a clean slate before\nshe pledged herself to Dick? And the slate--poor Dick!--could never be\ncleaned.\n\nThen, one day, David astonished them both. He was propped up in his bed,\nand he had demanded a cigar, and been very gently but firmly refused.\nHe had been rather sulky about it, and Dick had been attempting to rally\nhim into better humor when he said suddenly:\n\n\"I've had time to think things over, Dick. I haven't been fair to you.\nYou're thrown away here. Besides--\" he hesitated. Then: \"We might as\nwell face it. The day of the general practitioner has gone.\"\n\n\"I don't believe it,\" Dick said stoutly. \"Maybe we are only signposts\nto point the way to the other fellows, but the world will always need\nsignposts.\"\n\n\"What I've been thinking of,\" David pursued his own train of thought,\n\"is this: I want you to go to Johns Hopkins and take up the special work\nyou've been wanting to do. I'll be up soon and--\"\n\n\"Call the nurse, Aunt Lucy,\" said Dick. \"He's raving.\"\n\n\"Not at all,\" David retorted testily. \"I've told you. This whole town\nonly comes here now to be told what specialist to go to, and you know\nit.\"\n\n\"I don't know anything of the sort.\"\n\n\"If you don't, it's because you won't face the facts.\" Dick chuckled,\nand threw an arm over David's shoulder, \"You old hypocrite!\" he said.\n\"You're trying to get rid of me, for some reason. Don't tell me you're\ngoing to get married!\"\n\nBut David did not smile. Lucy, watching him from her post by the window,\nsaw his face and felt a spasm of fear. At the most, she had feared\na mental conflict in David. Now she saw that it might be something\ninfinitely worse, something impending and immediate. She could hardly\nreply when Dick appealed to her.\n\n\"Are you going to let him get rid of me like this, Aunt Lucy?\" he\ndemanded. \"Sentenced to Johns Hopkins, like Napoleon to St. Helena! Are\nyou with me, or forninst me?\"\n\n\"I don't know, Dick,\" she said, with her eyes on David. \"If it's for\nyour good--\"\n\nShe went out after a time, leaving them at it hammer and tongs. David\nwas vanquished in the end, but Dick, going down to the office later\non, was puzzled. Somehow it was borne in on him that behind David's\ninsistence was a reason, unspoken but urgent, and the only reason that\noccurred to him as possible was that David did not, after all, want him\nto marry Elizabeth Wheeler. He put the matter to the test that night,\nwandering in in dressing-gown and slippers, as was his custom before\ngoing to bed, for a brief chat. The nurse was downstairs, and Dick moved\nabout the room restlessly. Then he stopped and stood by the bed, looking\ndown.\n\n\"A few nights ago, David, I asked you if you thought it would be right\nfor me to marry; if my situation justified it, and if to your knowledge\nthere was any other reason why I could not or should not. You said there\nwas not.\"\n\n\"There is no reason, of course. If she'll have you.\"\n\n\"I don't know that. I know that whether she will or not is a pretty\nvital matter to me, David.\"\n\nDavid nodded, silently.\n\n\"But now you want me to go away. To leave her. You're rather urgent\nabout it. And I feel-well I begin to think you have a reason for it.\"\n\nDavid clenched his hands under the bed-clothing, but he returned Dick's\ngaze steadily.\n\n\"She's a good girl,\" he said. \"But she's entitled to more than you can\ngive her, the way things are.\"\n\n\"That is presupposing that she cares for me. I haven't an idea that\nshe does. That she may, in time--Then, that's the reason for this Johns\nHopkins thing, is it?\"\n\n\"That's the reason,\" David said stoutly. \"She would wait for you. She's\nthat sort. I've known her all her life. She's as steady as a rock. But\nshe's been brought up to have a lot of things. Walter Wheeler is well\noff. You do as I want you to; pack your things and go to Baltimore.\nBring Reynolds down here to look after the work until I'm around again.\"\n\nBut Dick evaded the direct issue thus opened and followed another line\nof thought.\n\n\"Of course you understand,\" he observed, after a renewal of his restless\npacing, \"that I've got to tell her my situation first. I don't need to\ntell you that I funk doing it, but it's got to be done.\"\n\n\"Don't be a fool,\" David said querulously. \"You'll set a lot of women\ncackling, and what they don't know they'll invent. I know 'em.\"\n\n\"Only herself and her family.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Because they have a right to know it.\"\n\nBut when he saw David formulating a further protest he dropped the\nsubject.\n\n\"I'll not do it until we've gone into it together,\" he promised.\n\"There's plenty of time. You settle down now and get ready for sleep.\"\n\nWhen the nurse came in at eleven o'clock she found Dick gone and David,\nvery still, with his face to the wall.\n\nIt was the end of May before David began to move about his upper room.\nThe trees along the shaded streets had burst into full leaf by that\ntime, and Mike was enjoying that gardener's interval of paradise when\nflowers grow faster than the weeds among them. Harrison Miller, having\nrolled his lawn through all of April, was heard abroad in the early\nmornings with the lawn mower or hoe in hand was to be seen behind his\nhouse in his vegetable patch.\n\nCars rolled through the streets, the rear seats laden with blossoming\nloot from the country lanes, and the Wheeler dog was again burying bones\nin the soft warm ground under the hedge.\n\nElizabeth Wheeler was very happy. Her look of expectant waiting, once\nvague, had crystallized now into definite form. She was waiting, timidly\nand shyly but with infinite content. In time, everything would come.\nAnd in the meantime there was to-day, and some time to-day a shabby car\nwould stop at the door, and there would be five minutes, or ten. And\nthen Dick would have to hurry to work, or back to David. After that, of\ncourse, to-day was over, but there would always be to-morrow.\n\nNow and then, at choir practice or at service, she saw Clare Rossiter.\nBut Clare was very cool to her, and never on any account sought her,\nor spoke to her alone. She was rather unhappy about Clare, when she\nremembered her. Because it must be so terrible to care for a man who\nonly said, when one spoke of Clare, \"Oh, the tall blonde girl?\"\n\nOnce or twice, too, she had found Clare's eyes on her, and they were\nhostile eyes. It was almost as though they said: \"I hate you because you\nknow. But don't dare to pity me.\"\n\nYet, somehow, Elizabeth found herself not entirely believing that\nClare's passion was real. Because the real thing you hid with all\nyour might, at least until you were sure it was wanted. After that,\nof course, you could be so proud of it that you might become utterly\nshameless. She was afraid sometimes that she was the sort to be utterly\nshameless. Yet, for all her halcyon hours, there were little things that\nworried her. Wallie Sayre, for instance, always having to be kept from\nsaying things she didn't want to hear. And Nina. She wasn't sure that\nNina was entirely happy. And, of course, there was Jim.\n\nJim was difficult. Sometimes he was a man, and then again he was a boy,\nand one never knew just which he was going to be. He was too old for\ndiscipline and too young to manage himself. He was spending almost all\nhis evenings away from home now, and her mother always drew an inaudible\nsigh when he was spoken of.\n\nElizabeth had waited up for him one night, only a short time before, and\nbeckoning him into her room, had talked to him severely.\n\n\"You ought to be ashamed, Jim,\" she said. \"You're simply worrying mother\nsick.\"\n\n\"Well, why?\" he demanded defiantly. \"I'm old enough to take care of\nmyself.\"\n\n\"You ought to be taking care of her, too.\"\n\nHe had looked rather crestfallen at that, and before he went out he\noffered a half-sheepish explanation.\n\n\"I'd tell them where I go,\" he said, \"but you'd think a pool room was on\nthe direct road to hell. Take to-night, now. I can't tell them about it,\nbut it was all right. I met Wallie Sayre and Leslie at the club before\ndinner, and we got a fourth and played bridge. Only half a cent a point.\nI swear we were going on playing, but somebody brought in a chap\nnamed Gregory for a cocktail. He turned out to be a brother of Beverly\nCarlysle, the actress, and he took us around to the theater and gave us\na box. Not a thing wrong with it, was there?\"\n\n\"Where did you go from there?\" she persisted inexorably. \"It's half past\none.\"\n\n\"Went around and met her. She's wonderful, Elizabeth. But do you know\nwhat would happen if I told them? They'd have a fit.\"\n\nShe felt rather helpless, because she knew he was right from his own\nstandpoint.\n\n\"I know. I'm surprised at Les, Jim.\"\n\n\"Oh, Les! He just trailed along. He's all right.\"\n\nShe kissed him and he went out, leaving her to lie awake for a long\ntime. She would have had all her world happy those days, and all her\nworld good. She didn't want anybody's bread and butter spilled on the\ncarpet.\n\nSo the days went on, and the web slowly wove itself into its complicated\npattern: Bassett speeding West, and David in his quiet room; Jim\nand Leslie Ward seeking amusement, and finding it in the littered\ndressing-room of a woman star at a local theater; Clare Rossiter\nbrooding, and the little question being whispered behind hands,\nfiguratively, of course--the village was entirely well-bred; Gregory\ncalling round to see Bassett, and turning away with the information that\nhe had gone away for an indefinite time; and Maggie Donaldson, lying in\nthe cemetery at the foot of the mountains outside Norada, having shriven\nher soul to the limit of her strength so that she might face her Maker.\n\nOut of all of them it was Clare Rossiter who made the first conscious\nmove of the shuttle; Clare, affronted and not a little malicious, but\nperhaps still dramatizing herself, this time as the friend who\nfeels forced to carry bad tidings. Behind even that, however, was\nan unconscious desire to see Dick again, and this time so to impress\nherself on him that never again could he pass her in the street\nunnoticed.\n\nOn the day, then, that David first sat up in bed Clare went to the house\nand took her place in the waiting-room. She was dressed with extreme\ncare, and she carried a parasol. With it, while she waited, she drilled\nsmall nervous indentations in the old office carpet, and formulated her\nline of action.\n\nNevertheless she found it hard to begin.\n\n\"I don't want to keep you, if you're busy,\" she said, avoiding his eyes.\n\"If you are in a hurry--\"\n\n\"This is my business,\" he said patiently. And waited.\n\n\"I wonder if you are going to understand me, when I do begin?\"\n\n\"You sound alarmingly ominous.\" He smiled at her, and she had a moment\nof panic. \"You don't look like a young lady with anything eating at her\ndamask cheek, or however it goes.\"\n\n\"Doctor Livingstone,\" she said suddenly, \"people are saying something\nabout you that you ought to know.\"\n\nHe stared at her, amazed and incredulous.\n\n\"About me? What can they say? That's absurd.\"\n\n\"I felt you ought to know. Of course I don't believe it. Not for a\nmoment. But you know what this town is.\"\n\n\"I know it's a very good town,\" he said steadily. \"However, let's have\nit. I daresay it is not very serious.\"\n\nShe was uneasy enough by that time, and rather frightened when she had\nfinished. For he sat, quiet and rather pale, not looking at her at all,\nbut gazing fixedly at an old daguerreotype of David that stood on his\ndesk. One that Lucy had shown him one day and which he had preempted;\nDavid at the age of eight, in a small black velvet suit and with very\nthin legs.\n\n\"I thought you ought to know,\" she justified herself, nervously.\n\nDick got up.\n\n\"Yes,\" he said. \"I ought to know, of course. Thank you.\"\n\nWhen she had gone he went back and stood before the picture again. From\nClare's first words he had had a stricken conviction that the thing was\ntrue; that, as Mrs. Cook Morgan's visitor from Wyoming had insisted,\nHenry Livingstone had never married, never had a son. He stood and gazed\nat the picture. His world had collapsed about him, but he was steady and\nvery erect.\n\n\"David, David!\" he thought. \"Why did you do it? And what am I? And who?\"\n\nCharacteristically his first thought after that was of David himself.\nWhatever David had done, his motive had been right. He would have to\nstart with that. If David had built for him a false identity it was\nbecause there was a necessity for it. Something shameful, something he\nwas to be taken away from. Wasn't it probable that David had heard the\ngossip, and had then collapsed? Wasn't the fear that he himself would\nhear it behind David's insistence that he go to Baltimore?\n\nHis thoughts flew to Elizabeth. Everything was changed now, as to\nElizabeth. He would have to be very certain of that past of his before\nhe could tell her that he loved her, and he had a sense of immediate\nhelplessness. He could not go to David, as things were. To Lucy?\n\nProbably he would have gone to Lucy at once, but the telephone rang.\nHe answered it, got his hat and bag and went out to the car. Years with\nDavid had made automatic the subordination of self to the demands of the\npractice.\n\nAt half past six Lucy heard him come in and go into his office. When he\ndid not immediately reappear and take his flying run up the stairs to\nDavid's room, she stood outside the office door and listened. She had a\npremonition of something wrong, something of the truth, perhaps. Anyhow,\nshe tapped at the door and opened it, to find him sitting very quietly\nat his desk with his head in his hands.\n\n\"Dick!\" she exclaimed. \"Is anything wrong?\"\n\n\"I have a headache,\" he said. He looked at his watch and got up. \"I'll\ntake a look at David, and then we'll have dinner. I didn't know it was\nso late.\"\n\nBut when she had gone out he did not immediately move. He had been going\nover again, painfully and carefully, the things that puzzled him, that\nhe had accepted before without dispute. David and Lucy's reluctance to\ndiscuss his father; the long days in the cabin, with David helping him\nto reconstruct his past; the spring, and that slow progress which now he\nfelt, somehow, had been an escape.\n\nHe ate very little dinner, and Lucy's sense of dread increased. When,\nafter the meal, she took refuge in her sitting-room on the lower floor\nand picked up her knitting, it was with a conviction that it was only a\ntemporary reprieve. She did not know from what.\n\nShe heard him, some time later, coming down from David's room. But he\ndid not turn into his office. Instead, he came on to her door, stood for\na moment like a man undecided, then came in. She did not look up, even\nwhen very gently he took her knitting from her and laid it on the table.\n\n\"Aunt Lucy.\"\n\n\"Yes, Dick.\"\n\n\"Don't you think we'd better have a talk?\"\n\n\"What about?\" she asked, with her heart hammering.\n\n\"About me.\" He stood above her, and looked down, still with the\ntenderness with which he always regarded her, but with resolution in his\nvery attitude. \"First of all, I'll tell you something. Then I'll ask you\nto tell me all you can.\"\n\nShe yearned over him as he told her, for all her terror. His voice, for\nall its steadiness, was strained.\n\n\"I have felt for some time,\" he finished, \"that you and David were\nkeeping something from me. I think, now, that this is what it was. Of\ncourse, you realize that I shall have to know.\"\n\n\"Dick! Dick!\" was all she could say.\n\n\"I was about,\" he went on, with his almost terrible steadiness, \"to ask\na girl to take my name. I want to know if I have a name to offer her. I\nhave, you see, only two alternatives to believe about myself. Either\nI am Henry Livingstone's illegitimate son, and in that case I have no\nright to my name, or to offer it to any one, or I am--\"\n\nHe made a despairing gesture.\n\n\"--or I am some one else, some one who was smuggled out of the mountains\nand given an identity that makes him a living lie.\"\n\nAlways she had known that this might come some time, but always too she\nhad seen David bearing the brunt of it. He should bear it. It was not\nof her doing or of her approving. For years the danger of discovery had\nhung over her like a cloud.\n\n\"Do you know which?\" he persisted.\n\n\"Yes, Dick.\"\n\n\"Would you have the unbelievable cruelty not to tell me?\"\n\nShe got up, a taut little figure with a dignity born of her fear and of\nher love for him.\n\n\"I shall not betray David's confidence,\" she said. \"Long ago I warned\nhim that this time would come. I was never in favor of keeping you\nin ignorance. But it is David's problem, and I cannot take the\nresponsibility of telling you.\"\n\nHe knew her determination and her obstinate loyalty. But he was fairly\ndesperate.\n\n\"You know that if you don't tell me, I shall go to David?\"\n\n\"If you go now you will kill him.\"\n\n\"It's as bad as that, is it?\" he asked grimly. \"Then there is something\nshameful behind it, is there?\"\n\n\"No, no, Dick. Not that. And I want you, always, to remember this. What\nDavid did was out of love for you. He has made many sacrifices for you.\nFirst he saved your life, and then he made you what you are. And he has\nhad a great pride in it. Don't destroy his work of years.\"\n\nHer voice broke and she turned to go out, her chin quivering, but half\nway to the door he called to her.\n\n\"Aunt Lucy--\" he said gently.\n\nShe heard him behind her, felt his strong arms as he turned her about.\nHe drew her to him and stooping, kissed her cheek.\n\n\"You're right,\" he said. \"Always right. I'll not worry him with it. My\nword of honor. When the time comes he'll tell me, and until it comes,\nI'll wait. And I love you both. Don't ever forget that.\"\n\nHe kissed her again and let her go.\n\nBut long after David had put down his prayer-book that night, and\nafter the nurse had rustled down the stairs to the night supper on the\ndining-room table, Lucy lay awake and listened to Dick's slow pacing of\nhis bedroom floor.\n\nHe was very gentle with David from that time on, and tried to return\nto his old light-hearted ways. On the day David was to have his first\nbroiled sweetbread he caught the nurse outside, borrowed her cap and\napron and carried in the tray himself.\n\n\"I hope your food is to your taste, Doctor David,\" he said, in a high\nfalsetto which set the nurse giggling in the hall. \"I may not be much of\na nurse, but I can cook.\"\n\nEven Lucy was deceived at times. He went his customary round, sent out\nthe monthly bills, opened and answered David's mail, bore the double\nburden of David's work and his own ungrudgingly, but off guard he was\ngrave and abstracted. He began to look very thin, too, and Lucy often\nheard him pacing the floor at night. She thought that he seldom or never\nwent to the Wheelers'.\n\nAnd so passed the tenth day of David's illness, with the smile on\nElizabeth's face growing a trifle fixed as three days went by without\nthe shabby car rattling to the door; with \"The Valley\" playing its\nsecond and final week before going into New York; and with Leslie Ward\nunconsciously taking up the shuttle Clare had dropped, and carrying the\npattern one degree further toward completion.\n\n\n\n\nXIV\n\nJUST how Leslie Ward had drifted into his innocuous affair with the star\nof \"The Valley\" he was not certain himself. Innocuous it certainly was.\nAfterwards, looking back, he was to wonder sometimes if it had not been\nprecisely for the purpose it served. But that was long months after.\nNot until the pattern was completed and he was able to recognize his own\nwork in it.\n\nThe truth was that he was not too happy at home. Nina's smart little\nhouse on the Ridgely Road had at first kept her busy. She had spent\nunlimited time with decorators, had studied and rejected innumerable\nwater-color sketches of interiors, had haunted auction rooms and bid\nrecklessly on things she felt at the moment she could not do without,\nlater on to have to wheedle Leslie into straightening her bank balance.\nThought, too, and considerable energy had gone into training and\noutfitting her servants, and still more into inducing them to wear the\nexpensive uniforms and livery she provided.\n\nBut what she made, so successfully, was a house rather than a home.\nThere were times, indeed, when Leslie began to feel that it was not even\na house, but a small hotel. They almost never dined alone, and when they\ndid Nina would explain that everybody was tied up. Then, after dinner,\nrestlessness would seize her, and she would want to run in to the\ntheater, or to make a call. If he refused, she nursed a grievance all\nevening.\n\nAnd he did not like her friends. Things came to a point where, when\nhe knew one of the gay evenings was on, he would stay in town, playing\nbilliards at his club, or occasionally wandering into a theater, where\nhe stood or sat at the back of the house and watched the play with\ncynical, discontented eyes.\n\nThe casual meeting with Gregory and the introduction to his sister\nbrought a new interest. Perhaps the very novelty was what first\nattracted him, the oddity of feeling that he was on terms of friendship,\nfor it amounted to that with surprising quickness, with a famous\nwoman, whose face smiled out at him from his morning paper or, huge and\nshockingly colored, from the sheets on the bill boards.\n\nHe formed the habit of calling on her in the afternoons at her hotel,\nand he saw that she liked it. It was often lonely, she explained. He\nsent her flowers and cigarettes, and he found her poised and restful,\nand sometimes, when she was off guard, with the lines of old suffering\nin her face.\n\nShe sat still. She didn't fidget, as Nina did. She listened, too.\nShe was not as beautiful as she appeared on the stage, but she was\nattractive, and he stilled his conscience with the knowledge that she\nplaced no undue emphasis on his visits. In her world men came and went,\nbrought or sent small tribute, and she was pleased and grateful. No\nmore. The next week, or the week after, and other men in other places\nwould be doing the same things.\n\nBut he wondered about her, sometimes. Did she ever think of Judson\nClark, and the wreck he had made of her life? What of resentment\nand sorrow lay behind her quiet face, or the voice with its careful\nintonations which was so unlike Nina's?\n\nNow and then he saw her brother. He neither liked nor disliked Gregory,\nbut he suspected him of rather bullying Beverly. On the rare occasions\nwhen he saw them together there was a sort of nervous tension in the\nair, and although Leslie was not subtle he sensed some hidden difference\nbetween them. A small incident one day almost brought this concealed\ndissension to a head. He said to Gregory:\n\n\"By the way, I saw you in Haverly yesterday afternoon.\"\n\n\"Must have seen somebody else. Haverly? Where's Haverly?\"\n\nLeslie Ward had been rather annoyed. There had been no mistake about the\nrecognition. But he passed it off with that curious sense of sex loyalty\nthat will actuate a man even toward his enemies.\n\n\"Funny,\" he said. \"Chap looked like you. Maybe a little heavier.\"\n\nNevertheless he had a conviction that he had said something better left\nunsaid, and that Beverly Carlysle's glance at her brother was almost\nhostile. He had that instantaneous picture of the two of them, the man\ndefiant and somehow frightened, and the woman's eyes anxious and yet\nslightly contemptuous. Then, in a flash, it was gone.\n\nHe had meant to go home that evening, would have, probably, for he was\nnot ignorant of where he was drifting. But when he went back to the\noffice Nina was on the wire, with the news that they were to go with a\nparty to a country inn.\n\n\"For chicken and waffles, Les,\" she said. \"It will be oceans of fun. And\nI've promised the cocktails.\"\n\n\"I'm tired,\" he replied, sulkily. \"And why don't you let some of the\nother fellows come over with the drinks? It seems to me I'm always the\ngoat.\"\n\n\"Oh, if that's the way you feel!\" Nina said, and hung up the receiver.\n\nHe did not go home. He went to the theater and stood at the back, with\nhis sense of guilt deadened by the knowledge that Nina was having what\nshe would call a heavenly time. After all, it would soon be over. He\ncounted the days. \"The Valley\" had only four more before it moved on.\n\nHe had already played his small part in the drama that involved Dick\nLivingstone, but he was unaware of it. He went home that night, to\nfind Nina settled in bed and very sulky, and he retired himself in no\npleasant frame of mind. But he took a firmer hold of himself that night\nbefore he slept. He didn't want a smash, and yet they might be headed\nthat way. He wouldn't see Beverly Carlysle again.\n\nHe lived up to his resolve the next day, bought his flowers as usual,\nbut this time for Nina and took them with him. And went home with the\norchids which were really an offering to his own conscience.\n\nBut Nina was not at home. The butler reported that she was dining at\nthe Wheelers', and he thought the man eyed him with restrained\ncommiseration.\n\n\"Did she say I am expected there?\" he asked.\n\n\"She ordered dinner for you here, sir.\"\n\nEven for Nina that sounded odd. He took his coat and went out again to\nthe car; after a moment's hesitation he went back and got the orchids.\n\nDick Livingstone's machine was at the curb before the Wheeler house,\nand in the living-room he found Walter Wheeler, pacing the floor. Mr.\nWheeler glanced at him and looked away.\n\n\"Anybody sick?\" Leslie asked, his feeling of apprehension growing.\n\n\"Nina is having hysterics upstairs,\" Mr. Wheeler said, and continued his\npacing.\n\n\"Nina! Hysterics?\"\n\n\"That's what I said,\" replied Mr. Wheeler, suddenly savage. \"You've made\na nice mess of things, haven't you?\"\n\nLeslie placed the box of orchids on the table and drew off his gloves.\nHis mind was running over many possibilities.\n\n\"You'd better tell me about it, hadn't you?\"\n\n\"Oh, I will. Don't worry. I've seen this coming for months. I'm not\ntaking her part. God knows I know her, and she has as much idea of\nmaking a home as--as\"--he looked about--\"as that poker has. But that's\nthe worst you can say of her. As to you--\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\nMr. Wheeler's anxiety was greater than his anger. He lowered his voice.\n\n\"She got a bill to-day for two or three boxes of flowers, sent to some\nactress.\" And when Leslie said nothing, \"I'm not condoning it, mind you.\nYou'd no business to do it. But,\" he added fretfully, \"why the devil,\nif you've got to act the fool, don't you have your bills sent to your\noffice?\"\n\n\"I suppose I don't need to tell you that's all there was to it? Flowers,\nI mean.\"\n\n\"I'm taking that for granted. But she says she won't go back.\"\n\nLeslie was aghast and frightened. Not at the threat; she would go back,\nof course. But she would always hold it against him. She cherished small\ngrudges faithfully. And he knew she would never understand, never see\nher own contribution to his mild defection, nor comprehend the actual\ninnocence of those afternoons of tea and talk.\n\nThere was no sound from upstairs. Mr. Wheeler got his hat and went out,\ncalling to the dog. Jim came in whistling, looked in and said: \"Hello,\nLes,\" and disappeared. He sat in the growing twilight and cursed himself\nfor a fool. After all, where had he been heading? A man couldn't eat his\ncake and have it. But he was resentful, too; he stressed rather hard his\nown innocence, and chose to ignore the less innocent impulse that lay\nbehind it.\n\nAfter a half hour or so he heard some one descending and Dick\nLivingstone appeared in the hall. He called to him, and Dick entered the\nroom. Before he sat down he lighted a cigarette and in the flare of\nthe match Leslie got an impression of fatigue and of something new, of\ntrouble. But his own anxieties obsessed him.\n\n\"She's told you about it, I suppose?\"\n\n\"I was a fool, of course. But it was only a matter of a few flowers\nand some afternoon calls. She's a fine woman, Livingstone, and she is\nlonely. The women have given her a pretty cold deal since the Clark\nstory. They copy her clothes and her walk, but they don't ask her into\ntheir homes.\"\n\n\"Isn't the trouble more fundamental than that, Ward? I was thinking\nabout it upstairs. Nina was pretty frank. She says you've had your good\ntime and want to settle down, and that she is young and now is her only\nchance. Later on there may be children, you know. She blames herself,\ntoo, but she has a fairly clear idea of how it happened.\"\n\n\"Do you think she'll go back home?\"\n\n\"She promised she would.\"\n\nThey sat smoking in silence. In the dining-room Annie was laying the\ntable for dinner, and a most untragic odor of new garden peas began\nto steal along the hall. Dick suddenly stirred and threw away his\ncigarette.\n\n\"I was going to talk to you about something else,\" he said, \"but this is\nhardly the time. I'll get on home.\" He rose. \"She'll be all right. Only\nI'd advise very tactful handling and--the fullest explanation you can\nmake.\"\n\n\"What is it? I'd be glad to have something to keep my mind occupied.\nIt's eating itself up just now.\"\n\n\"It's a personal matter.\"\n\nWard glanced up at him quickly.\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\n\"Have you happened to hear a story that I believe is going round? One\nthat concerns me?\"\n\n\"Well, I have,\" Leslie admitted. \"I didn't pay much attention. Nobody is\ntaking it very seriously.\"\n\n\"That's not the point,\" Dick persisted. \"I don't mind idle gossip. I\ndon't give a damn about it. It's the statement itself.\"\n\n\"I should say that you are the only person who knows anything about it.\"\n\nDick made a restless, impatient gesture.\n\n\"I want to know one thing more,\" he said. \"Nina told you, I suppose.\nDoes--I suppose Elizabeth knows it, too?\"\n\n\"I rather think she does.\"\n\nDick turned abruptly and went out of the room, and a moment later\nLeslie heard the front door slam. Elizabeth, standing at the head of the\nstairs, heard it also, and turned away, with a new droop to her usually\nvaliant shoulders. Her world, too, had gone awry, that safe world of\nprotection and cheer and kindliness. First had come Nina, white-lipped\nand shaken, and Elizabeth had had to face the fact that there were such\nthings as treachery and the queer hidden things that men did, and that\ncame to light and brought horrible suffering.\n\nAnd that afternoon she had had to acknowledge that there was something\nwrong with Dick. No. Between Dick and herself. There was a formality in\nhis speech to her, an aloofness that seemed to ignore utterly their new\nintimacy. He was there, but he was miles away from her. She tried hard\nto feel indignant, but she was only hurt.\n\nPeace seemed definitely to have abandoned the Wheeler house. Then\nlate in the evening a measure of it was restored when Nina and Leslie\neffected a reconciliation. It followed several bad hours when Nina had\nlocked her door against them all, but at ten o'clock she sent for Leslie\nand faced him with desperate calmness.\n\nTo Elizabeth, putting cold cloths on her mother's head as she lay on the\nbed, there came a growing conviction that the relation between men and\nwomen was a complicated and baffling thing, and that love and hate were\nsometimes close together.\n\nLove, and habit perhaps, triumphed in Nina's case, however, for at\neleven o'clock they heard Leslie going down the stairs and later on\nmoving about the kitchen and pantry while whistling softly. The servants\nhad gone, and the air was filled with the odor of burning bread. Some\ntime later Mrs. Wheeler, waiting uneasily in the upper hall, beheld her\nson-in-law coming up and carrying proudly a tray on which was toast of\nan incredible blackness, and a pot which smelled feebly of tea.\n\n\"The next time you're out of a cook just send for me,\" he said\ncheerfully.\n\nMrs. Wheeler, full and overflowing with indignation and the piece of her\nmind she had meant to deliver, retired vanquished to her bedroom.\n\nLate that night when Nina had finally forgiven him and had settled down\nfor sleep, Leslie went downstairs for a cigar, to find Elizabeth sitting\nthere alone, a book on her knee, face down, and her eyes wistful and\nwith a question in them.\n\n\"Sitting and thinking, or just sitting?\" he inquired.\n\n\"I was thinking.\"\n\n\"Air-castles, eh? Well, be sure you put the right man into them!\" He\nfelt more or less a fool for having said that, for it was extremely\nlikely that Nina's family was feeling some doubt about Nina's choice.\n\n\"What I mean is,\" he added hastily, \"don't be a fool and take Wallie\nSayre. Take a man, while you're about it.\"\n\n\"I would, if I could do the taking.\"\n\n\"That's piffle, Elizabeth.\" He sat down on the arm of a chair and looked\nat her. \"Look here, what about this story the Rossiter girl and a few\nothers are handing around about Dick Livingstone? You're not worrying\nabout it, are you?\"\n\n\"I don't believe it's true, and it wouldn't matter to me, anyhow.\"\n\n\"Good for you,\" he said heartily, and got up. \"You'd better go to bed,\nyoung lady. It's almost midnight.\"\n\nBut although she rose she made no further move to go.\n\n\"What I am worrying about is this, Leslie. He may hear it.\"\n\n\"He has heard it, honey.\"\n\nHe had expected her to look alarmed, but instead she showed relief.\n\n\"I'll tell you the truth, Les,\" she said. \"I was worrying. I'm terribly\nfond of him. It just came all at once, and I couldn't help it. And I\nthought he liked me, too, that way.\" She stopped and looked up at him to\nsee if he understood, and he nodded gravely. \"Then to-day, when he came\nto see Nina, he avoided me. He--I was waiting in the hall upstairs, and\nhe just said a word or two and went on down.\"\n\n\"Poor devil!\" Leslie said. \"You see, he's in an unpleasant position, to\nsay the least. But here's a thought to go to sleep on. If you ask me,\nhe's keeping out of your way, not because he cares too little, but\nbecause he cares too much.\"\n\nLong after a repentant and chastened Leslie had gone to sleep, his arm\nover Nina's unconscious shoulder, Elizabeth stood wide-eyed on the\ntiny balcony outside her room. From it in daylight she could see\nthe Livingstone house. Now it was invisible, but an upper window was\noutlined in the light. Very shyly she kissed her finger tips to it.\n\n\"Good-night, dear,\" she whispered.\n\n\n\n\nXV\n\nLouis Bassett had left for Norada the day after David's sudden illness,\nbut ten days later found him only as far as Chicago, and laid up in his\nhotel with a sprained knee. It was not until the day Nina went back to\nthe little house in the Ridgely Road, having learned the first lesson of\nmarried life, that men must not only be captured but also held, that he\nwas able to resume his journey.\n\nHe had chafed wretchedly under the delay. It was true that nothing in\nthe way of a story had broken yet. The Tribune had carried a photograph\nof the cabin where Clark had according to the Donaldson woman spent the\nwinter following the murder, and there were the usual reports that he\nhad been seen recently in spots as diverse as Seattle and New Orleans.\nBut when the following Sunday brought nothing further he surmised that\nthe pack, having lost the scent, had been called off.\n\nHe confirmed this before starting West by visiting some of the offices\nof the leading papers and looking up old friends. The Clark story was\ndead for the time. They had run a lot of pictures of him, however, and\nsome one might turn him up eventually, but a scent was pretty cold in\nten years. The place had changed, too. Oil had been discovered five\nyears ago, and the old settlers had, a good many of them, cashed in and\nmoved away. The town had grown like all oil towns.\n\nBassett was fairly content. He took the night train out of Chicago and\nspent the next day crossing Nebraska, fertile, rich and interesting. On\nthe afternoon of the second day he left the train and took a branch\nline toward the mountains and Norada, and from that time on he became an\nurbane, interested and generally cigar-smoking interrogation point.\n\n\"Railroad been here long?\" he asked the conductor.\n\n\"Four years.\"\n\n\"Norada must have been pretty isolated before that.\"\n\n\"Thirty miles in a coach or a Ford car.\"\n\n\"I was reading the other day,\" said Bassett, \"about the Judson Clark\ncase. Have a cigar? Got time to sit down?\"\n\n\"You a newspaper man?\"\n\n\"Oil well supplies,\" said Bassett easily. \"Well, in this article it\nseemed some woman or other had made a confession. It sounded fishy to\nme.\"\n\n\"Well, I'll tell you about that.\" The conductor sat down and bit off the\nend of his cigar. \"I knew the Donaldsons well, and Maggie Donaldson was\nan honest woman. But I'll tell you how I explain the thing. Donaldson\ndied, and that left her pretty much alone. The executors of the Clark\nestate kept her on the ranch, but when the estate was settled three\nyears ago she had to move. That broke her all up. She's always said he\nwasn't dead. She kept the house just as it was, and my wife says she had\nhis clothes all ready and everything.\"\n\n\"That rather sounds as though the story is true, doesn't it?\"\n\n\"Not necessarily. It's my idea she got from hoping to moping, so to\nspeak. She went in to town regular for letters for ten years, and the\npostmaster says she never got any. She was hurt in front of the post\noffice. The talk around here is that she's been off her head for the\nlast year or two.\"\n\n\"But they found the cabin.\"\n\n\"Sure they did,\" said the conductor equably. \"The cabin was no secret.\nIt was an old fire station before they put the new one on Goat Mountain.\nI spent a month in it myself, once, with a dude who wanted to take\npictures of bear. We found a bear, but it charged the camera and I'd be\nrunning yet if I hadn't come to civilization.\"\n\nWhen he had gone Bassett fell into deep thought. So Maggie Donaldson\nhad gone to the post office for ten years. He tried to visualize those\nfaithful, wearisome journeys, through spring mud and winter snow, always\nfutile and always hopeful. He did not for a moment believe that she had\n\"gone off her head.\" She had been faithful to the end, as some women\nwere, and in the end, too, as had happened before, her faith had killed\nher.\n\nAnd again he wondered at the curious ability of some men to secure\nloyalty. They might go through life, tearing down ideals and destroying\nillusions to the last, but always there was some faithful hand to\nrebuild, some faithful soul to worship.\n\nHe was somewhat daunted at the size and bustling activity of Norada.\nIts streets were paved and well-lighted, there were a park and a public\nlibrary, and the clerk at the Commercial Hotel asked him if he wished\na private bath! But the development was helpful in one way. In the\nold Norada a newcomer might have been subjected to a friendly but\ninquisitive interest. In this grown-up and self-centered community a man\nmight come and go unnoticed.\n\nAnd he had other advantages. The pack, as he cynically thought of them,\nwould have started at the Clark ranch and the cabin. He would get to\nthem, of course, but he meant to start on the outside of the circle and\nwork in.\n\n\"Been here long?\" he asked the clerk at the desk, after a leisurely\nmeal.\n\nThe clerk grinned.\n\n\"I came here two years ago. I never saw Jud Clark. To get to the Clark\nplace take the road north out of the town and keep straight about eight\nmiles. The road's good now. You fellows have worn it smooth.\"\n\n\"Must have written that down and learned it off,\" Bassett said\nadmiringly. \"What the devil's the Clark place? And why should I go\nthere? Unless,\" he added, \"they serve a decent meal.\"\n\n\"Sorry.\" The clerk looked at him sharply, was satisfied, and picked up a\npen. \"You'll hear the story if you stay around here any time. Anything I\ncan do for you?\"\n\n\"Yes. Fire the cook,\" Bassett said, and moved away.\n\nHe spent the evening in going over his notes and outlining a campaign,\nand the next day he stumbled on a bit of luck. His elderly chambermaid\nhad lived in and around the town for years.\n\n\"Ever hear of any Livingstones in these parts?\" he asked.\n\n\"Why, yes. There used to be a Livingstone ranch at Dry River,\" she said,\npausing with her carpet sweeper, and looking at him. \"It wasn't much of\na place. Although you can't tell these days. I sold sixty acres eight\nyears ago for two thousand dollars, and the folks that bought it are\ngetting a thousand a day out of it.\"\n\nShe sighed. She had touched the hem of fortune's garment and passed on;\nfor some opportunity knocked but faintly, and for others it burst open\nthe door and forced its way in.\n\n\"I'd be a millionaire now if I'd held on,\" she said somberly. That day\nBassett engaged a car by the day, he to drive it himself and return it\nin good condition, the garage to furnish tires.\n\n\"I'd just like to say one thing,\" the owner said, as he tried the gears.\n\"I don't know where you're going, and it's not exactly my business. Here\nin the oil country, where they're cutting each other's throats for new\nleases, we let a man alone. But if you've any idea of taking that car by\nthe back road to the old fire station where Jud Clark's supposed to have\nspent the winter, I'll just say this: we've had two stuck up there for a\nweek, and the only way I see to get them back is a cyclone.\"\n\n\"I'm going to Dry River,\" Bassett said shortly.\n\n\"Dry River's right, if you're looking for oil! Go easy on the brakes,\nold man. We need 'em in our business.\"\n\nDry River was a small settlement away from the railroad. It consisted\nof two intersecting unpaved streets, a dozen or so houses, a closed and\nempty saloon and two general stores. He chose one at random and found\nthat the old Livingstone place had been sold ten years ago, on the death\nof its owner, Henry Livingstone.\n\n\"His brother from the East inherited it,\" said the storekeeper. \"He came\nand sold out, lock, stock and barrel. Not that there was much. A few\ncattle and horses, and the stuff in the ranch house, which wasn't\nvaluable. There were a lot of books, and the brother gave them for a\nlibrary, but we haven't any building. The railroad isn't built this far\nyet, and unless we get oil here it won't be.\"\n\n\"The brother inherited it, eh? Do you know the brother's name?\"\n\n\"David, I think. He was a doctor back East somewhere.\"\n\n\"Then this Henry Livingstone wasn't married? Or at least had no\nchildren?\"\n\n\"He wasn't married. He was a sort of hermit. He'd been dead two days\nbefore any one knew it. My wife went out when they found him and got him\nready for the funeral. He was buried before the brother got here.\" He\nglanced at Bassett shrewdly. \"The place has been prospected for oil, and\nthere's a dry hole on the next ranch. I tell my wife nature's like the\nrailroad. It quit before it got this far.\"\n\nBassett's last scruple had fled. The story was there, ready for the\ngathering. So ready, indeed, that he was almost suspicious of his luck.\n\nAnd that conviction, that things were coming too easy, persisted through\nhis interview with the storekeeper's wife, in the small house behind the\nstore. She was a talkative woman, eager to discuss the one drama in\na drab life, and she showed no curiosity as to the reason for his\nquestion.\n\n\"Henry Livingstone!\" she said. \"Well, I should say so. I went out right\naway when we got the word he was dead, and there I stayed until it was\nall over. I guess I know as much about him as any one around here does,\nfor I had to go over his papers to find out who his people were.\"\n\nThe papers, it seemed, had not been very interesting; canceled checks\nand receipted bills, and a large bundle of letters, all of them from a\nbrother named David and a sister who signed herself Lucy. There had\nbeen a sealed one, too, addressed to David Livingstone, and to be opened\nafter his death. She had had her husband wire to \"David\" and he had come\nout, too late for the funeral.\n\n\"Do you remember when that was?\"\n\n\"Let me see. Henry Livingstone died about a month before the murder at\nthe Clark ranch. We date most things around here from that time.\"\n\n\"How long did 'David' stay?\" Bassett had tried to keep his tone\ncarefully conversational, but he saw that it was not necessary. She was\nglad of a chance to talk.\n\n\"Well, I'd say about three or four weeks. He hadn't seen his brother for\nyears, and I guess there was no love lost. He sold everything as quick\nas he could, and went back East.\" She glanced at the clock. \"My husband\nwill be in soon for dinner. I'd be glad to have you stay and take a meal\nwith us.\"\n\nThe reporter thanked her and declined.\n\n\"It's an interesting story,\" he said. \"I didn't tell your husband, for\nI wasn't sure I was on the right trail. But the David and Lucy business\neliminates this man. There's a piece of property waiting in the East\nfor a Henry Livingstone who came to this state in the 80's, or for his\nheirs. You can say positively that this man was not married?\"\n\n\"No. He didn't like women. Never had one on the place. Two ranch hands\nthat are still at the Wassons' and himself, that was all. The Wassons\nare the folks who bought the ranch.\"\n\nNo housekeeper then, and no son born out of wedlock, so far as any\nevidence went. All that glib lying in the doctor's office, all that\napparent openness and frankness, gone by the board! The man in the\ncabin, reported by Maggie Donaldson, had been David Livingstone.\nSomehow, some way, he had got Judson Clark out of the country and\nspirited him East. Not that the how mattered just yet. The essential\nfact was there, that David Livingstone had been in this part of the\ncountry at the time Maggie Donaldson had been nursing Judson Clark in\nthe mountains.\n\nBassett sat back and chewed the end of his cigar thoughtfully. The\nsheer boldness of the scheme which had saved Judson Clark compelled his\nadmiration, but the failure to cover the trail, the ease with which he\nhad picked it up, made him suspicious.\n\nHe rose and threw away his cigar.\n\n\"You say this David went East, when he had sold out the place. Do you\nremember where he lived?\"\n\n\"Some town in eastern Pennsylvania. I've forgotten the name.\"\n\n\"I've got to be sure I'm wrong, and then go ahead,\" he said, as he got\nhis hat. \"I'll see those men at the ranch, I guess, and then be on my\nway. How far is it?\"\n\nIt was about ten miles, along a bad road which kept him too much\noccupied for any connected thought. But his sense of exultation\npersisted. He had found Judson Clark.\n\n\n\n\nXVI\n\nDick's decision to cut himself off from Elizabeth was born of his\ncertainty that he could not see her and keep his head. He was resolutely\ndetermined to keep his head, until he knew what he had to offer her. But\nhe was very unhappy. He worked sturdily all day and slept at night out\nof sheer fatigue, only to rouse in the early morning to a conviction\nof something wrong before he was fully awake. Then would come the\nuncertainty and pain of full consciousness, and he would lie with his\narms under his head, gazing unblinkingly at the ceiling and preparing to\nface another day.\n\nThere was no prospect of early relief, although David had not again\nreferred to his going away. David was very feeble. The look of him\nsometimes sent an almost physical pain through Dick's heart. But there\nwere times when he roused to something like his old spirit, shouted for\ntobacco, frowned over his diet tray, and fought Harrison Miller when he\ncame in to play cribbage in much his old tumultuous manner.\n\nThen, one afternoon late in May, when for four days Dick had not seen\nElizabeth, suddenly he found the decision as to their relation taken out\nof his hands, and by Elizabeth herself.\n\nHe opened the door one afternoon to find her sitting alone in the\nwaiting-room, clearly very frightened and almost inarticulate. He could\nnot speak at all at first, and when he did his voice, to his dismay, was\ndistinctly husky.\n\n\"Is anything wrong?\" he asked, in a tone which was fairly sepulchral.\n\n\"That's what I want to know, Dick.\"\n\nSuddenly he found himself violently angry. Not at her, of course. At\neverything.\n\n\"Wrong?\" he said, savagely. \"Yes. Everything is wrong!\"\n\nThen he was angry! She went rather pale.\n\n\"What have I done, Dick?\"\n\nAs suddenly as he had been fierce he was abject and ashamed. Startled,\ntoo.\n\n\"You?\" he said. \"What have you done? You're the only thing that's right\nin a wrong world. You--\"\n\nHe checked himself, put down his bag--he had just come in--and closed\nthe door into the hall. Then he stood at a safe distance from her, and\nfolded his arms in order to be able to keep his head-which shows how\nstrange the English language is.\n\n\"Elizabeth,\" he said gravely. \"I've been a self-centered fool. I stayed\naway because I've been in trouble. I'm still in trouble, for that\nmatter. But it hasn't anything to do with you. Not directly, anyhow.\"\n\n\"Don't you think it's possible that I know what it is?\"\n\n\"You do know.\"\n\nHe was too absorbed to notice the new maturity in her face, the brooding\nmaternity born of a profound passion. To Elizabeth just then he was not\na man, her man, daily deciding matters of life and death, but a worried\nboy, magnifying a trifle into importance.\n\n\"There is always gossip,\" she said, \"and the only thing one can do is to\nforget it at once. You ought to be too big for that sort of thing.\"\n\n\"But--suppose it is true?\"\n\n\"What difference would it make?\"\n\nHe made a quick movement toward her.\n\n\"There may be more than that. I don't know, Elizabeth,\" he said, his\neyes on hers. \"I have always thought--I can't go to David now.\"\n\nHe was moved to go on. To tell her of his lost youth, of that strange\ntrick by which his mind had shut off those hidden years. But he could\nnot. He had a perfectly human fear of being abnormal in her eyes,\nprecisely but greatly magnified the same instinct which had made him\ninspect his new tie in daylight for fear it was too brilliant. But\ngreater than that was his new fear that something neither happy nor\nright lay behind him under lock and key in his memory.\n\n\"I want you to know this, Dick,\" she said. \"That nothing, no gossip or\nanything, can make any difference to me. And I've been terribly hurt.\nWe've been such friends. You--I've been lying awake at night, worrying.\"\n\nThat went to his heart first, and then to his head. This might be all,\nall he was ever to have. This hour, and this precious and tender child,\nso brave in her declaration, so simple and direct; all his world in that\nimitation mahogany chair.\n\n\"You're all I've got,\" he said. \"The one real thing in a world that's\ngoing to smash. I think I love you more than God.\"\n\nThe same mood, of accepting what he had without question and of refusing\nto look ahead, actuated him for the next few days. He was incredibly\nhappy.\n\nHe went about his work with his customary care and thoroughness, for\nlong practice had made it possible for him to go on as though nothing\nhad happened, to listen to querulous complaints and long lists of\nsymptoms, and to write without error those scrawled prescriptions which\nwere, so hopefully, to cure. Not that Dick himself believed greatly in\nthose empirical doses, but he considered that the expectation of relief\nwas half the battle. But that was the mind of him, which went about\nclothed in flesh, of course, and did its daily and nightly work, and put\nup a very fair imitation of Doctor Richard Livingstone. But hidden away\nwas a heart that behaved in a highly unprofessional manner, and sang\nand dreamed, and jumped at the sight of a certain small figure on the\nstreet, and generally played hob with systole and diastole, and the\nvagus and accelerator nerves. Which are all any doctor really knows\nabout the heart, until he falls in love.\n\nHe even began to wonder if he had read into the situation something\nthat was not there, and in this his consciousness of David's essential\nrectitude helped him. David could not do a wrong thing, or an unworthy\none. He wished he were more like David.\n\nThe new humility extended to his love for Elizabeth. Sometimes, in his\nroom or shaving before the bathroom mirror, he wondered what she could\nsee in him to care about. He shaved twice a day now, and his face was so\nsore that he had to put cream on it at night, to his secret humiliation.\nWhen he was dressed in the morning he found himself once or twice\ntaking a final survey of the ensemble, and at those times he wished very\nearnestly that he had some outstanding quality of appearance that she\nmight admire.\n\nHe refused to think. He was content for a time simply to feel, to be\nsupremely happy, to live each day as it came and not to look ahead. And\nthe old house seemed to brighten with him. Never had Lucy's window boxes\nbeen so bright, or Minnie's bread so light; the sun poured into David's\nsick room and turned the nurse so dazzling white in her uniform that\nDavid declared he was suffering from snow-blindness.\n\nAnd David himself was improving rapidly. With the passage of each day\nhe felt more secure. The reporter from the Times-Republican--if he were\nreally on the trail of Dick he would have come to see him, would have\ntold him the story. No. That bridge was safely crossed. And Dick was\nhappy. David, lying in his bed, would listen and smile faintly when Dick\ncame whistling into the house or leaped up the stairs two at a time;\nwhen he sang in his shower, or tormented the nurse with high-spirited\nnonsense. The boy was very happy. He would marry Elizabeth Wheeler, and\nthings would be as they should be; there would be the fullness of life,\nyoung voices in the house, toys on the lawn. He himself would pass on,\nin the fullness of time, but Dick--\n\nOn Decoration Day they got him out of bed, making a great ceremony\nof it, and when he was settled by the window in his big chair with a\nblanket over his knees, Dick came in with a great box. Unwrapping it\nhe disclosed a mass of paper and a small box, and within that still\nanother.\n\n\"What fol-de-rol is all this?\" David demanded fiercely, with a childish\nlook of expectation in his eyes. \"Give me that box. Some more slippers,\nprobably!\"\n\nHe worked eagerly, and at last he came to the small core of the mass. It\nwas a cigar!\n\nIt was somewhat later, when the peace of good tobacco had relaxed him\ninto a sort of benignant drowsiness, and when Dick had started for his\nlate afternoon calls, that Lucy came into the room.\n\n\"Elizabeth Wheeler's downstairs,\" she said. \"I told her you wanted to\nsee her. She's brought some chicken jelly, too.\"\n\nShe gathered up the tissue paper that surrounded him, and gave the room\na critical survey. She often felt that the nurse was not as tidy as she\nmight be. Then she went over to him and put a hand on his shoulder.\n\n\"I don't want to worry you, David. Not now. But if he's going to marry\nher--\"\n\n\"Well, why shouldn't he?\" he demanded truculently. \"A good woman would\nbe one more anchor to windward.\"\n\nShe found that she could not go on. David was always incomprehensible to\nher when it came to Dick. Had been incomprehensible from the first.\nBut she could not proceed without telling him that the village knew\nsomething, and what that something was; that already she felt a change\nin the local attitude toward Dick. He was, for one thing, not quite so\nbusy as he had been.\n\nShe went out of the room, and sent Elizabeth to David.\n\nIn her love for Dick, Elizabeth now included everything that pertained\nto him, his shabby coats, his rattling car, and his people. She had\nan inarticulate desire for their endorsement, to be liked by them and\nwanted by them. Not that there could be any words, because both she and\nDick were content just then with love, and were holding it very secret\nbetween them.\n\n\"Well, well!\" said David. \"And here we are reversed and I'm the patient\nand you're the doctor! And good medicine you are, my dear.\"\n\nHe looked her over with approval, and with speculation, too. She was a\nsmall and fragile vessel on which to embark all the hopes that, out of\nhis own celibate and unfulfilled life, he had dreamed for Dick. She was\neven more than that. If Lucy was right, from now on she was a part\nof that experiment in a human soul which he had begun with only a\nprofessional interest, but which had ended by becoming a vital part of\nhis own life.\n\nShe was a little shy with him, he saw; rather fluttered and nervous, yet\nradiantly happy. The combination of these mixed emotions, plus her best\nsick-room manner, made her slightly prim at first. But soon she was\ntelling him the small news of the village, although David rather\nsuspected her of listening for Dick's car all the while. When she got up\nto go and held out her hand he kept it, between both of his.\n\n\"I haven't been studying symptoms for all these years for nothing, my\ndear,\" he said. \"And it seems to me somebody is very happy.\"\n\n\"I am, Doctor David.\"\n\nHe patted her hand.\n\n\"Mind you,\" he said, \"I don't know anything and I'm not asking any\nquestions. But if the Board of Trade, or the Chief of Police, had come\nto me and said, 'Who is the best wife for--well, for a young man who\nis an important part of this community?' I'd have said in reply,\n'Gentlemen, there is a Miss Elizabeth Wheeler who--'\"\n\nSuddenly she bent down and kissed him.\n\n\"Oh, do you think so?\" she asked, breathlessly. \"I love him so much,\nDoctor David. And I feel so unworthy.\"\n\n\"So you are,\" he said. \"So's he. So are all of us, when it comes to a\ngreat love, child. That is, we are never quite what the other fellow\nthinks we are. It's when we don't allow for what the scientist folk call\na margin of error that we come our croppers. I wonder\"--he watched her\nclosely--\"if you young people ever allow for a margin of error?\"\n\n\"I only know this,\" she said steadily. \"I can't imagine ever caring any\nless. I've never thought about myself very much, but I do know that. You\nsee, I think I've cared for a long time.\"\n\nWhen she had gone he sat in his chair staring ahead of him and thinking.\nYes. She would stick. She had loyalty, loyalty and patience and a rare\nhumility. It was up to Dick then. And again he faced the possibility of\nan opening door into the past, of crowding memories, of confusion and\ndespair and even actual danger. And out of that, what?\n\nHabit. That was all he had to depend on. The brain was a thing of\nhabits, like the body; right could be a habit, and so could evil. As a\nman thought, so he was. For all of his childhood, and for the last ten\nyears, Dick's mental habits had been right; his environment had been\nlove, his teaching responsibility. Even if the door opened, then, there\nwas only the evil thinking of two or three reckless years to combat,\nand the door might never open. Happiness, Lauler had said, would keep it\nclosed, and Dick was happy.\n\nWhen at five o'clock the nurse came in with a thermometer he was asleep\nin his chair, his mouth slightly open, and snoring valiantly. Hearing\nDick in the lower hall, she went to the head of the stairs, her finger\nto her lips.\n\nDick nodded and went into the office. The afternoon mail was lying\nthere, and he began mechanically to open it. His thoughts were\nelsewhere.\n\nNow that he had taken the step he had so firmly determined not to take,\ncertain things, such as Clare Rossiter's story, David's uneasiness, his\nown doubts, no longer involved himself alone, nor even Elizabeth and\nhimself. They had become of vital importance to her family.\n\nThere was no evading the issue. What had once been only his own\nmisfortune, mischance, whatever it was, had now become of vital\nimportance to an entire group of hitherto disinterested people. He would\nhave to put his situation clearly before them and let them judge. And he\nwould have to clarify that situation for them and for himself.\n\nHe had had a weak moment or two. He knew that some men, many men, went\nto marriage with certain reticences, meaning to wipe the slate clean and\nbegin again. He had a man's understanding of such concealments. But he\ndid not for a moment compare his situation with theirs, even when the\ntemptation to seize his happiness was strongest. No mere misconduct,\nbut something hidden and perhaps terrible lay behind David's strange\nnew attitude. Lay, too, behind the break in his memory which he tried to\nanalyze with professional detachment. The mind in such cases set up\nits defensive machinery of forgetfulness, not against the trivial but\nagainst the unbearable.\n\nFor the last day or two he had faced the fact that, not only must he use\nevery endeavor to revive his past, but that such revival threatened with\ncruelty and finality to separate him from the present.\n\nWith an open and unread letter in his hand he stared about the office.\nThis place was his; he had fought for it, worked for it. He had an\nalmost physical sense of unseen hands reaching out to drag him away\nfrom it; from David and Lucy, and from Elizabeth. And of himself holding\ndesperately to them all, and to the believed commonplaceness of his\nsurroundings.\n\nHe shook himself and began to read the letter.\n\n\"Dear Doctor: I have tried to see you, but understand you are laid\nup. Burn this as soon as you've read it. Louis Bassett has started for\nNorada, and I advise your getting the person we discussed out of town as\nsoon as possible. Bassett is up to mischief. I'm not signing this fully,\nfor obvious reasons. G.\"\n\n\n\nXVII\n\nThe Sayre house stood on the hill behind the town, a long, rather low\nwhite house on Italian lines. In summer, until the family exodus to the\nMaine Coast, the brilliant canopy which extended out over the\nterrace indicated, as Harrison Miller put it, that the family was \"in\nresidence.\" Originally designed as a summer home, Mrs. Sayre now used it\nthe year round. There was nothing there, as there was in the town house,\nto remind her of the bitter days before her widowhood.\n\nShe was a short, heavy woman, of fine taste in her house and of no taste\nwhatever in her clothing.\n\n\"I never know,\" said Harrison Miller, \"when I look up at the Sayre\nplace, whether I'm seeing Ann Sayre or an awning.\"\n\nShe was not a shrewd woman, nor a clever one, but she was kindly in the\nmain, tolerant and maternal. She liked young people, gave gay little\nparties to which she wore her outlandish clothes of all colors and all\ncuts, lavished gifts on the girls she liked, and was anxious to see\nWallie married to a good steady girl and settled down. Between her son\nand herself was a quiet but undemonstrative affection. She viewed him\nthrough eyes that had lost their illusion about all men years ago, and\nshe had no delusions about him. She had no idea that she knew all that\nhe did with his time, and no desire to penetrate the veil of his private\nlife.\n\n\"He spends a great deal of money,\" she said one day to her lawyer. \"I\nsuppose in the usual ways. But he is not quite like his father. He has\nreal affections, which his father hadn't. If he marries the right girl\nshe can make him almost anything.\"\n\nShe had her first inkling that he was interested in Elizabeth Wheeler\none day when the head gardener reported that Mr. Wallace had ordered\ncertain roses cut and sent to the Wheeler house. She was angry at first,\nfor the roses were being saved for a dinner party. Then she considered.\n\n\"Very well, Phelps,\" she said. \"Do it. And I'll select a plant also, to\ngo to Mrs. Wheeler.\"\n\nAfter all, why not the Wheeler girl? She had been carefully reared, if\nthe Wheeler house was rather awful in spots, and she was a gentle little\nthing; very attractive, too, especially in church. And certainly Wallie\nhad been seeing a great deal of her.\n\nShe went to the greenhouses, and from there upstairs and into the rooms\nthat she had planned for Wallie and his bride, when the time came. She\nwas more content than she had been for a long time. She was a lonely\nwoman, isolated by her very grandeur from the neighborliness she craved;\nwhen she wanted society she had to ask for it, by invitation. Standing\ninside the door of the boudoir, her thoughts already at work on\ndraperies and furniture, she had a vague dream of new young life\nstirring in the big house, of no more lonely evenings, of the bustle and\nactivity of a family again.\n\nShe wanted Wallie to settle down. She was tired of paying his bills at\nhis clubs and at various hotels, tired and weary of the days he lay in\nbed all morning while his valet concocted various things to enable him\nto pull himself together. He had been four years sowing his wild oats,\nand now at twenty-five she felt he should be through with them.\n\nThe south room could be the nursery.\n\nOn Decoration Day, as usual, she did her dutiful best by the community,\nsent flowers to the cemetery and even stood through a chilly hour there\nwhile services were read and taps sounded over the graves of those who\nhad died in three wars. She felt very grateful that Wallie had come back\nsafely, and that if only now he would marry and settle down all would be\nwell.\n\nThe service left her emotionally untouched. She was one of those women\nwho saw in war, politics, even religion, only their reaction on\nherself and her affairs. She had taken the German deluge as a personal\naffliction. And she stood only stoically enduring while the village\nsoprano sang \"The Star Spangled Banner.\" By the end of the service she\nhad decided that Elizabeth Wheeler was the answer to her problem.\n\nRather under pressure, Wallie lunched with her at the country club, but\nshe found him evasive and not particularly happy.\n\n\"You're twenty-five, you know,\" she said, toward the end of a\ndiscussion. \"By thirty you'll be too set in your habits, too hard to\nplease.\"\n\n\"I'm not going to marry for the sake of getting married, mother.\"\n\n\"Of course not. But you have a good bit of money. You'll have much more\nwhen I'm gone. And money carries responsibility with it.\"\n\nHe glanced at her, looked away, rapped a fork on the table cloth.\n\n\"It takes two to make a marriage, mother.\"\n\nHe closed up after that, but she had learned what she wanted.\n\nAt three o'clock that afternoon the Sayre limousine stopped in front of\nNina's house, and Mrs. Sayre, in brilliant pink and a purple hat, got\nout. Leslie, lounging in a window, made the announcement.\n\n\"Here's the Queen of Sheba,\" he said. \"I'll go upstairs and have a\nheadache, if you don't mind.\"\n\nHe kissed Nina and departed hastily. He was feeling extremely gentle\ntoward Nina those days and rather smugly virtuous. He considered that\nhis conscience had brought him back and not a very bad fright, which was\nthe fact, and he fairly exuded righteousness.\n\nIt was the great lady's first call, and Nina was considerably uplifted.\nIt was for such moments as this one trained servants and put Irish lace\non their aprons, and had decorators who stood off with their heads a\nlittle awry and devised backgrounds for one's personality.\n\n\"What a delightful room!\" said Mrs. Sayre. \"And how do you keep a maid\nas trim as that?\"\n\n\"I must have service,\" Nina replied. \"The butler's marching in a parade\nor something. How nice of you to come and see our little place. It's a\nband-box, of course.\"\n\nMrs. Sayre sat down, a gross disharmony in the room, but a solid and not\nunkindly woman for all that.\n\n\"My dear,\" she said, \"I am not paying a call. Or not only that. I came\nto talk to you about something. About Wallace and your sister.\"\n\nNina was gratified and not a little triumphant.\n\n\"I see,\" she said. \"Do you mean that they are fond of one another?\"\n\n\"Wallace is. Of course, this talk is between ourselves, but--I'm going\nto be frank, Nina. I want Wallie to marry, and I want him to marry soon.\nYou and I know that the life of an unattached man about town is full of\ntemptations. I want him to settle down. I'm lonely, too, but that's not\nso important.\"\n\nNina hesitated.\n\n\"I don't know about Elizabeth. She's fond of Wallie, as who isn't? But\nlately--\"\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\n\"Well, for the last few days I have been wondering. She doesn't talk,\nyou know. But she has been seeing something of Dick Livingstone.\"\n\n\"Doctor Livingstone! She'd be throwing herself away!\"\n\n\"Yes, but she's like that. I mean, she isn't ambitious. We've always\nexpected her to throw herself away; at least I have.\"\n\nA half hour later Leslie, upstairs, leaned over the railing to see if\nthere were any indications of departure. The door was open, and Mrs.\nSayre evidently about to take her leave. She was saying:\n\n\"It's very close to my heart, Nina dear, and I know you will be tactful.\nI haven't stressed the material advantages, but you might point them out\nto her.\"\n\nA few moments later Leslie came downstairs. Nina was sitting alone,\nthinking, with a not entirely pleasant look of calculation on her face.\n\n\"Well?\" he said. \"What were you two plotting?\"\n\n\"Plotting? Nothing, of course.\"\n\nHe looked down at her. \"Now see here, old girl,\" he said, \"you keep your\nhands off Elizabeth's affairs. If I know anything she's making a damn\ngood choice, and don't you forget it.\"\n\n\n\n\nXVIII\n\nDick stood with the letter in his hand, staring at it. Who was Bassett?\nWho was \"G\"? What had the departure of whoever Bassett might be for\nNorada to do with David? And who was the person who was to be got out of\ntown?\n\nHe did not go upstairs. He took the letter into his private office,\nclosed the door, and sitting down at his desk turned his reading lamp on\nit, as though that physical act might bring some mental light.\n\nReread, the cryptic sentences began to take on meaning. An unknown named\nBassett, whoever he might be, was going to Norada bent on \"mischief,\"\nand another unknown who signed himself \"G\" was warning David of that\nfact. But the mischief was designed, not against David, but against a\nthird unknown, some one who was to be got out of town.\n\nDavid had been trying to get him out of town.--The warning referred to\nhimself.\n\nHis first impulse was to go to David, and months later he was to wonder\nwhat would have happened had he done so. How far could Bassett have\ngone? What would have been his own decision when he learned the truth?\n\nFor a little while, then, the shuttle was in Dick's own hand. He went up\nto David's room, and with his hand on the letter in his pocket, carried\non behind his casual talk the debate that was so vital. But David had\na headache and a slightly faster pulse, and that portion of the pattern\nwas never woven.\n\nThe association between anxiety and David's illness had always been\napparent in Dick's mind, but now he began to surmise a concrete shock, a\nperson, a telegram, or a telephone call. And after dinner that night he\nwent back to the kitchen.\n\n\"Minnie,\" he inquired, \"do you remember the afternoon Doctor David was\ntaken sick?\"\n\n\"I'll never forget it.\"\n\n\"Did he receive a telegram that day?\"\n\n\"Not that I know of. He often answers the bell himself.\"\n\n\"Do you know whether he had a visitor, just before you heard him fall?\"\n\n\"He had a patient, yes. A man.\"\n\n\"Who was it?\"\n\n\"I don't know. He was a stranger to me.\"\n\n\"Do you remember what he looked like?\"\n\nMinnie reflected.\n\n\"He was a smallish man, maybe thirty-five or so,\" she said. \"I think he\nhad gaiters over his shoes, or maybe light tops. He was a nice appearing\nperson.\"\n\n\"How soon after that did you hear Doctor David fall?\"\n\n\"Right away. First the door slammed, and then he dropped.\"\n\nPoor old David! Dick had not the slightest doubt now that David had\nreceived some unfortunate news, and that up there in his bedroom ever\nsince, alone and helpless, he had been struggling with some secret dread\nhe could not share with any one. Not even with Lucy, probably.\n\nNevertheless, Dick made a try with Lucy that evening.\n\n\"Aunt Lucy,\" he said, \"do you know of anything that could have caused\nDavid's collapse?\"\n\n\"What sort of thing?\" she asked guardedly.\n\n\"A letter, we'll say, or a visitor?\"\n\nWhen he saw that she was only puzzled and thinking back, he knew she\ncould not help him.\n\n\"Never mind,\" he said. \"I was feeling about for some cause. That's all.\"\n\nHe was satisfied that Lucy knew no more than he did of David's visitor,\nand that David had kept his own counsel ever since. But the sense of\nimpending disaster that had come with the letter did not leave him. He\nwent through his evening office hours almost mechanically, with a part\nof his mind busy on the puzzle. How did it affect the course of action\nhe had marked out? Wasn't it even more necessary than ever now to go to\nWalter Wheeler and tell him how things stood? He hated mystery. He liked\nto walk in the middle of the road in the sunlight. But even stronger\nthan that was a growing feeling that he needed a sane and normal\njudgment on his situation; a fresh viewpoint and some unprejudiced\nadvice.\n\nHe visited David before he left, and he was very gentle with him. In\nview of this new development he saw David from a different angle, facing\nand dreading something imminent, and it came to him with a shock that\nhe might have to clear things up to save David. The burden, whatever it\nwas, was breaking him.\n\nHe had telephoned, and Mr. Wheeler was waiting for him. Walter Wheeler\nthought he knew what was coming, and he had well in mind what he was\ngoing to say. He had thought it over, pacing the floor alone, with the\ndog at his heels. He would say:\n\n\"I like and respect you, Livingstone. If you're worrying about what\nthese damned gossips say, let's call it a day and forget it. I know a\nman when I see one, and if it's all right with Elizabeth it's all right\nwith me.\"\n\nThings, however, did not turn out just that way. Dick came in, grave and\nclearly preoccupied, and the first thing he said was:\n\n\"I have a story to tell you, Mr. Wheeler. After you've heard it, and\ngiven me your opinion on it, I'll come to a matter that--well, that I\ncan't talk about now.\"\n\n\"If it's the silly talk that I daresay you've heard--\"\n\n\"No. I don't give a damn for talk. But there is something else.\nSomething I haven't told Elizabeth, and that I'll have to tell you.\"\n\nWalter Wheeler drew himself up rather stiffly. Leslie's defection was\nstill in his mind.\n\n\"Don't tell me you're tangled up with another woman.\"\n\n\"No. At least I think not. I don't know.\"\n\nIt is doubtful if Walter Wheeler grasped many of the technicalities\nthat followed. Dick talked and he listened, nodding now and then, and\nendeavoring very hard to get the gist of the matter. It seemed to him\ncurious rather than serious. Certainly the mind was a strange thing. He\nmust read up on it. Now and then he stopped Dick with a question, and\nDick would break in on his narrative to reply. Thus, once:\n\n\"You've said nothing to Elizabeth at all? About the walling off, as you\ncall it?\"\n\n\"No. At first I was simply ashamed of it. I didn't want her to get the\nidea that I wasn't normal.\"\n\n\"I see.\"\n\n\"Now, as I tell you, I begin to think--I've told you that this walling\noff is an unconscious desire to forget something too painful to\nremember. It's practically always that. I can't go to her with just\nthat, can I? I've got to know first what it is.\"\n\n\"I'd begun to think there was an understanding between you.\"\n\nDick faced him squarely.\n\n\"There is. I didn't intend it. In fact, I was trying to keep away from\nher. I didn't mean to speak to her until I'd cleared things up. But it\nhappened anyhow; I suppose the way those things always happen.\"\n\nIt was Walter Wheeler's own decision, finally, that he go to Norada\nwith Dick as soon as David could be safely left. It was the letter which\ninfluenced him. Up to that he had viewed the situation with a certain\ndetachment; now he saw that it threatened the peace of two households.\n\n\"It's a warning, all right.\"\n\n\"Yes. Undoubtedly.\"\n\n\"You don't recognize the name Bassett?\"\n\n\"No. I've tried, of course.\"\n\nThe result of some indecision was finally that Elizabeth should not be\ntold anything until they were ready to tell it all. And in the end a\ncertain resentment that she had become involved in an unhappy situation\ndied in Walter Wheeler before Dick's white face and sunken eyes.\n\nAt ten o'clock the house-door opened and closed, and Walter Wheeler got\nup and went out into the hall.\n\n\"Go on upstairs, Margaret,\" he said to his wife. \"I've got a visitor.\"\nHe did not look at Elizabeth. \"You settle down and be comfortable,\" he\nadded, \"and I'll be up before long. Where's Jim?\"\n\n\"I don't know. He didn't go to Nina's.\"\n\n\"He started with you, didn't he?\"\n\n\"Yes. But he left us at the corner.\"\n\nThey exchanged glances. Jim had been worrying them lately. Strange how\na man could go along for years, his only worries those of business, his\ntrack a single one through comfortable fields where he reaped only what\nhe sowed. And then his family grew up, and involved him without warning\nin new perplexities and new troubles. Nina first, then Jim, and now this\nstrange story which so inevitably involved Elizabeth.\n\nHe put his arm around his wife and held her to him.\n\n\"Don't worry about Jim, mother,\" he said. \"He's all right fundamentally.\nHe's going through the bad time between being a boy and being a man.\nHe's a good boy.\"\n\nHe watched her moving up the stairs, his eyes tender and solicitous. To\nhim she was just \"mother.\" He had never thought of another woman in all\ntheir twenty-four years together.\n\nElizabeth waited near him, her eyes on his face.\n\n\"Is it Dick?\" she asked in a low tone.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"You don't mind, daddy, do you?\"\n\n\"I only want you to be happy,\" he said rather hoarsely. \"You know that,\ndon't you?\"\n\nShe nodded, and turned up her face to be kissed. He knew that she had no\ndoubt whatever that this interview was to seal her to Dick Livingstone\nfor ever and ever. She fairly radiated happiness and confidence. He left\nher standing there going back to the living-room closed the door.\n\n\n\n\nXIX\n\nLouis Bassett, when he started to the old Livingstone ranch, now\nthe Wasson place, was carefully turning over in his mind David's\nparticipation in the escape of Judson Clark. Certain phases of it were\nquite clear, provided one accepted the fact that, following a heavy\nsnowfall, an Easterner and a tenderfoot had gone into the mountains\nalone, under conditions which had caused the posse after Judson Clark to\nturn back and give him up for dead.\n\nHad Donaldson sent him there, knowing he was a medical man? If he had,\nwould Maggie Donaldson not have said so? She had said \"a man outside\nthat she had at first thought was a member of the searching party.\"\nEvidently, then, Donaldson had not prepared her to expect medical\nassistance.\n\nTake the other angle. Say David Livingstone had not been sent for. Say\nhe knew nothing of the cabin or its occupants until he stumbled on them.\nHe had sold the ranch, distributed his brother's books, and apparently\nthe townspeople at Dry River believed that he had gone back home.\nThen what had taken him, clearly alone and having certainly given the\nimpression of a departure for the East, into the mountains? To hunt? To\nhunt what, that he went about it secretly and alone?\n\nBassett was inclined to the Donaldson theory, finally. John Donaldson\nwould have been wanting a doctor, and not wanting one from Norada. He\nmight have heard of this Eastern medical man at Dry River, have gone to\nhim with his story, even have taken him part of the way. The situation\nwas one that would have a certain appeal. It was possible, anyhow:\n\nBut instead of clarifying the situation Bassett's visit at the\nWasson place brought forward new elements which fitted neither of the\nhypotheses in his mind.\n\nTo Wasson himself, whom he met on horseback on the road into the ranch,\nhe gave the same explanation he had given to the store-keeper's wife.\nWasson was a tall man in chaps and a Stetson, and he was courteously\ninterested.\n\n\"Bill and Jake are still here,\" he said. \"They're probably in for dinner\nnow, and I'll see you get a chance to talk to them. I took them over\nwith the ranch. Property, you say? Well, I hope it's better land than he\nhad here.\"\n\nHe turned his horse and rode beside the car to the house.\n\n\"Comes a little late to do Henry Livingstone much good,\" he said. \"He's\nbeen lying in the Dry River graveyard for about ten years. Not much\nmourned either. He was about as close-mouthed and uncompanionable as\nthey make them.\"\n\nThe description Wasson had applied to Henry Livingstone, Bassett himself\napplied to the two ranch hands later on, during their interview. It\ncould hardly have been called an interview at all, indeed, and after a\ntime Bassett realized that behind their taciturnity was suspicion. They\nwere watching him, undoubtedly; he rather thought, when he looked away,\nthat once or twice they exchanged glances. He was certain, too, that\nWasson himself was puzzled.\n\n\"Speak up, Jake,\" he said once, irritably. \"This gentleman has come a\nlong way. It's a matter of some property.\"\n\n\"What sort of property?\" Jake demanded. Jake was the spokesman of the\ntwo.\n\n\"That's not important,\" Bassett observed, easily. \"What we want to know\nis if Henry Livingstone had any family.\"\n\n\"He had a brother.\"\n\n\"No one else?\"\n\n\"Then it's up to me to trail the brother,\" Bassett observed. \"Either of\nyou remember where he lived?\"\n\n\"Somewhere in the East.\"\n\nBassett laughed.\n\n\"That's a trifle vague,\" he commented good-humoredly. \"Didn't you boys\never mail any letters for him?\"\n\nHe was certain again that they exchanged glances, but they continued\nto present an unbroken front of ignorance. Wasson was divided between\nirritation and amusement.\n\n\"What'd I tell you?\" he asked. \"Like master like man. I've been here ten\nyears, and I've never got a word about the Livingstones out of either of\nthem.\"\n\n\"I'm a patient man.\" Bassett grinned. \"I suppose you'll admit that one\nof you drove David Livingstone to the train, and that you had a fair\nidea then of where he was going?\"\n\nHe looked directly at Jake, but Jake's face was a solid mask. He made no\nreply whatever.\n\nFrom that moment on Bassett was certain that David had not been driven\naway from the ranch at all. What he did not know, and was in no way to\nfind out, was whether the two ranch hands knew that he had gone into the\nmountains, or why. He surmised back of their taciturnity a small mystery\nof their own, and perhaps a fear. Possibly David's going was as much a\npuzzle to them as to him. Conceivably, during the hours together on the\nrange, or during the winter snows, for ten years they had wrangled and\nargued over a disappearance as mysterious in its way as Judson Clark's.\n\nHe gave up at last, having learned certain unimportant facts: that the\nrecluse had led a lonely life; that he had never tried to make the place\nmore than carry itself; that he was a student, and that he had no other\npeculiarities.\n\n\"Did he ever say anything that would lead you to believe that he had any\nfamily, outside of his brother and sister? That is, any direct heir?\"\nBassett asked.\n\n\"He never talked about himself,\" said Jake. \"If that's all, Mr. Wasson,\nI've got a steer bogged down in the north pasture and I'll be going.\"\n\nOn the Wassons' invitation he remained to lunch, and when the ranch\nowner excused himself and rode away after the meal he sat for some\ntime on the verandah, with Mrs. Wasson sewing and his own eyes fixed\nspeculatively on the mountain range, close, bleak and mysterious.\n\n\"Strange thing,\" he commented. \"Here's a man, a book-lover and student,\nwho comes out here, not to make living and be a useful member of the\ncommunity, but apparently to bury himself alive. I wonder, why.\"\n\n\"A great many come out here to get away from something, Mr. Bassett.\"\n\n\"Yes, to start again. But this man never started again. He apparently\njust quit.\"\n\nMrs. Wasson put down her sewing and looked at him thoughtfully.\n\n\"Did the boys tell you anything about the young man who visited Henry\nLivingstone now and then?\"\n\n\"No. They were not very communicative.\"\n\n\"I suppose they wouldn't tell. Yet I don't see, unless--\" She stopped,\nlost in some field of speculation where he could not follow her. \"You\nknow, we haven't much excitement here, and when this boy was first seen\naround the place--he was here mostly in the summer--we decided that he\nwas a relative. I don't know why we considered him mysterious, unless\nit was because he was hardly ever seen. I don't even know that that was\ndeliberate. For that matter Mr. Livingstone wasn't much more than a name\nto us.\"\n\n\"You mean, a son?\"\n\n\"Nobody knew. He was here only now and then.\"\n\nBassett moved in his chair and looked at her.\n\n\"How old do you suppose this boy was?\" he asked.\n\n\"He was here at different times. When Mr. Livingstone died I suppose he\nwas in his twenties. The thing that makes it seem odd to me is that the\nmen didn't mention him to you.\"\n\n\"I didn't ask about him, of course.\"\n\nShe went on with her sewing, apparently intending to drop the matter;\nbut the reporter felt that now and then she was subjecting him to a\nsharp scrutiny, and that, in some shrewd woman-fashion, she was trying\nto place him.\n\n\"You said it was a matter of some property?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"But it's rather late, isn't it? Ten years?\"\n\n\"That's what makes it difficult.\"\n\nThere was another silence, during which she evidently made her decision.\n\n\"I have never said this before, except to Mr. Wasson. But I believe he\nwas here when Henry Livingstone died.\"\n\nHer tone was mysterious, and Bassett stared at her.\n\n\"You don't think Livingstone was murdered!\"\n\n\"No. He died of heart failure. There was an autopsy. But he had a bad\ncut on his head. Of course, he may have fallen--Bill and Jake were away.\nThey'd driven some cattle out on the range. It was two days before he\nwas found, and it would have been longer if Mr. Wasson hadn't ridden out\nto talk to him about buying. He found him dead in his bed, but there was\nblood on the floor in the next room. I washed it up myself.\"\n\n\"Of course,\" she added, when Bassett maintained a puzzled silence, \"I\nmay be all wrong. He might have fallen in the next room and dragged\nhimself to bed. But he was very neatly covered up.\"\n\n\"It's your idea, then, that this boy put him into the bed?\"\n\n\"I don't know. He wasn't seen about the place. He's never been here\nsince. But the posse found a horse with the Livingstone brand, saddled,\ndead in Dry River Canyon when it was looking for Judson Clark. Of\ncourse, that was a month later. The men here, Bill and Jake, claimed it\nhad wandered off, but I've often wondered.\"\n\nAfter a time Bassett got up and took his leave. He was confused and\nirritated. Here, whether creditably or not, was Dick Livingstone\naccounted for. There was a story there, probably, but not the story he\nwas after. This unknown had been at the ranch when Henry Livingstone\ndied, had perhaps been indirectly responsible for his death. He had,\nwitness the horse, fled after the thing happened. Later on, then, David\nLivingstone had taken him into his family. That was all.\n\nExcept for that identification of Gregory's, and for the photograph of\nJudson Clark.... For a moment he wondered if the two, Jud Clark and the\nunknown, could be the same. But Dry River would have known Clark. That\ncouldn't be.\n\nHe almost ditched the car on his way back to Norada, so deeply was he\nengrossed in thought.\n\n\n\n\nXX\n\nOn the seventh of June David and Lucy went to the seashore, went by\nthe order of various professional gentlemen who had differed violently\nduring the course of David's illness, but who now suddenly agreed with\nan almost startling unanimity. Which unanimity was the result of careful\ncoaching by Dick.\n\nHe saw in David's absence his only possible chance to go back to Norada\nwithout worry to the sick man, and he felt, too, that a change, getting\naway from the surcharged atmosphere of the old house, would be good for\nboth David and Lucy.\n\nFor days before they started Lucy went about in a frenzy of nervous\nenergy, writing out menus for Minnie for a month ahead, counting and\nrecounting David's collars and handkerchiefs, cleaning and pressing his\nneckties. In the harness room in the stable Mike polished boots until\nhis arms ached, and at the last moment with trunks already bulging,\ncame three gift dressing-gowns for David, none of which he would leave\nbehind.\n\n\"I declare,\" Lucy protested to Dick, \"I don't know what's come over him.\nEvery present he's had since he was sick he's taking along. You'd think\nhe was going to be shut up on a desert island.\"\n\nBut Dick thought he understood. In David's life his friends had had to\ntake the place of wife and children; he clung to them now, in his age\nand weakness, and Dick knew that he had a sense of deserting them, of\nabandoning them after many faithful years.\n\nSo David carried with him the calendars and slippers, dressing-gowns and\nbed-socks which were at once the tangible evidence of their friendliness\nand Lucy's despair.\n\nWatching him, Dick was certain nothing further had come to threaten his\nrecovery. Dick carefully inspected the mail, but no suspicious letter\nhad arrived, and as the days went on David's peace seemed finally\nre-established. He made no more references to Johns Hopkins, slept like\na child, and railed almost pettishly at his restricted diet.\n\n\"When we get away from Dick, Lucy,\" he would say, \"we'll have beef\nagain, and roast pork and sausage.\"\n\nLucy would smile absently and shake her head.\n\n\"You'll stick to your diet, David,\" she would say. \"David, it's the\nstrangest thing about your winter underwear. I'm sure you had five\nsuits, and now there are only three.\"\n\nOr it was socks she missed, or night-clothing. And David, inwardly\nchuckling, would wonder with her, knowing all the while that they had\nclothed some needy body.\n\nOn the night before the departure David went out for his first short\nwalk alone, and brought Elizabeth back with him.\n\n\"I found a rose walking up the street, Lucy,\" he bellowed up the stairs,\n\"and I brought it home for the dinner table.\"\n\nLucy came down, flushed from her final effort over the trunks, but\ngently hospitable.\n\n\"It's fish night, Elizabeth,\" she said. \"You know Minnie's a Catholic,\nso we always have fish on Friday. I hope you eat it.\" She put her hand\non Elizabeth's arm and gently patted it, and thus was Elizabeth taken\ninto the old brick house as one of its own.\n\nElizabeth was finding this period of her tacit engagement rather\npuzzling. Her people puzzled her. Even Dick did, at times. And nobody\nseemed anxious to make plans for the future, or even to discuss the\nwedding. She was a little hurt about that, remembering the excitement\nover Nina's.\n\nBut what chiefly bewildered her was the seeming necessity for secrecy.\nEven Nina had not been told, nor Jim. She did not resent that, although\nit bewildered her. Her own inclination was to shout it from the\nhouse-tops. Her father had simply said: \"I've told your mother, honey,\nand we'd better let it go at that, for a while. There's no hurry. And I\ndon't want to lose you yet.\"\n\nBut there were other things. Dick himself varied. He was always gentle\nand very tender, but there were times when he seemed to hold himself\naway from her, would seem aloof and remote, but all the time watching\nher almost fiercely. But after that, as though he had tried an\nexperiment in separation and failed with it, he would catch her to him\nsavagely and hold her there. She tried, very meekly, to meet his mood;\nwas submissive to his passion and acquiescent to those intervals when\nhe withdrew himself and sat or stood near her, not touching her but\nwatching her intently.\n\nShe thought men in love were very queer and quite incomprehensible.\nBecause he varied in other ways, too. He was boyish and gay sometimes,\nand again silent and almost brooding. She thought at those times that\nperhaps he was tired, what with David's work and his own, and sometimes\nshe wondered if he were still worrying about that silly story. But once\nor twice, after he had gone, she went upstairs and looked carefully into\nher mirror. Perhaps she had not looked her best that day. Girl-like, she\nset great value on looks in love. She wanted frightfully to be beautiful\nto him. She wished she could look like Beverly Carlysle, for instance.\n\nTwo days before David and Lucy's departure he had brought her her\nengagement ring, a square-cut diamond set in platinum. He kissed it\nfirst and then her finger, and slipped it into place. It became a rite,\ndone as he did it, and she had a sense of something done that could\nnever be undone. When she looked up at him he was very pale.\n\n\"Forsaking all others, so long as we both shall live,\" he said,\nunsteadily.\n\n\"So long as we both shall live,\" she repeated.\n\nHowever she had to take it off later, for Mrs. Wheeler, it developed,\nhad very pronounced ideas of engagement rings. They were put on the day\nthe notices were sent to the newspapers, and not before. So Elizabeth\nwore her ring around her neck on a white ribbon, inside her camisole,\nuntil such time as her father would consent to announce that he was\nabout to lose her.\n\nThus Elizabeth found her engagement full of unexpected turns and twists,\nand nothing precisely as she had expected. But she accepted things\nas they came, being of the type around which the dramas of life are\nenacted, while remaining totally undramatic herself. She lived her quiet\ndays, worried about Jim on occasion, hemmed table napkins for her linen\nchest, and slept at night with her ring on her finger and a sense of\nbeing wrapped in protecting love that was no longer limited to the white\nWheeler house, but now extended two blocks away and around the corner to\na shabby old brick building in a more or less shabby yard.\n\nThey were very gay in the old brick house that night before the\ndeparture, very noisy over the fish and David's broiled lamb chop. Dick\ndemanded a bottle of Lucy's home-made wine, and even David got a little\nof it. They toasted the seashore, and the departed nurse, and David\nquoted Robert Burns at some length and in a horrible Scotch accent.\nThen Dick had a trick by which one read the date on one of three pennies\nwhile he was not looking, and he could tell without failing which one\nit was. It was most mysterious. And after dinner Dick took her into his\nlaboratory, and while she squinted one eye and looked into the finder of\nhis microscope he kissed the white nape of her neck.\n\nWhen they left the laboratory there were patients in the waiting-room,\nbut he held her in his arms in the office for a moment or two, very\nquietly, and because the door was thin they made a sort of game of it,\nand pretended she was a patient.\n\n\"How did you sleep last night?\" he said, in a highly professional and\nvery distinct voice. Then he kissed her.\n\n\"Very badly, doctor,\" she said, also very clearly, and whispered, \"I lay\nawake and thought about you, dear.\"\n\n\"I'd better give you this sleeping powder.\" Oh, frightfully\nprofessional, but the powder turned out to be another kiss. It was a\nwonderful game.\n\nWhen she slipped out into the hall she had to stop and smooth her hair,\nbefore she went to Lucy's tidy sitting-room.\n\n\n\n\nXXI\n\nIt was Jim Wheeler's turn to take up the shuttle. A girl met in\nsome casual fashion; his own youth and the urge of it, perhaps the\nunconscious family indulgence of an only son--and Jim wove his bit and\npassed on.\n\nThere had been mild contention in the Wheeler family during all the\nspring. Looking out from his quiet windows Walter Wheeler saw the young\nworld going by a-wheel, and going fast. Much that legitimately belonged\nto it, and much that did not in the laxness of the new code, he laid to\nthe automobile. And doggedly he refused to buy one.\n\n\"We can always get a taxicab,\" was his imperturbable answer to Jim. \"I\npay pretty good-sized taxi bills without unpleasant discussion. I know\nyou pretty well too, Jim. Better than you know yourself. And if you had\na car, you'd try your best to break your neck in it.\"\n\nNow and then Jim got a car, however. Sometimes he rented one, sometimes\nhe cajoled Nina into lending him hers.\n\n\"A fellow looks a fool without one,\" he would say to her. \"Girls expect\nto be taken out. It's part of the game.\"\n\nAnd Nina, always reached by that argument of how things looked, now and\nthen reluctantly acquiesced. But a night or two after David and Lucy had\nstarted for the seashore Nina came in like a whirlwind, and routed the\nfamily peace immediately.\n\n\"Father,\" she said, \"you just must speak to Jim. He's taken our car\ntwice at night without asking for it, and last night he broke a spring.\nLes is simply crazy.\"\n\n\"Taken your car!\" Mrs. Wheeler exclaimed.\n\n\"Yes. I hate telling on him, but I spoke to him after the first time,\nand he did it anyhow.\"\n\nMrs. Wheeler glanced at her husband uneasily. She often felt he was too\nsevere with Jim.\n\n\"Don't worry,\" he said grimly. \"He'll not do it again.\"\n\n\"If we only had a car of our own--\" Mrs. Wheeler protested.\n\n\"You know what I think about that, mother. I'm not going to have him\njoy-riding over the country, breaking his neck and getting into trouble.\nI've seen him driving Wallace Sayre's car, and he drives like a fool or\na madman.\"\n\nIt was an old dispute and a bitter one. Mr. Wheeler got up, whistled for\nthe dog, and went out. His wife turned on Nina.\n\n\"I wish you wouldn't bring these things to your father, Nina,\" she said.\n\"He's been very nervous lately, and he isn't always fair to Jim.\"\n\n\"Well, it's time Jim was fair to Leslie,\" Nina said, with family\nfrankness. \"I'll tell you something, mother. Jim has a girl somewhere,\nin town probably. He takes her driving. I found a glove in the car. And\nhe must be crazy about her, or he'd never do what he's done.\"\n\n\"Do you know who it is?\"\n\n\"No. Somebody's he's ashamed of, probably, or he wouldn't be so\nclandestine about it.\"\n\n\"Nina!\"\n\n\"Well, it looks like it. Jim's a man, mother. He's not a little boy.\nHe'll go through his shady period, like the rest.\"\n\nThat night it was Mrs. Wheeler's turn to lie awake. Again and again she\nwent over Nina's words, and her troubled mind found a basis in fact\nfor them. Jim had been getting money from her, to supplement his small\nsalary; he had been going out a great deal at night, and returning very\nlate; once or twice, in the morning, he had looked ill and his eyes had\nbeen bloodshot, as though he had been drinking.\n\nAnxiety gripped her. There were so many temptations for young men, so\nmany who waited to waylay them. A girl. Not a good girl, perhaps.\n\nShe raised herself on her elbow and looked at her sleeping husband. Men\nwere like that; they begot children and then forgot them. They never\nlooked ahead or worried. They were taken up with business, and always\nthey forgot that once they too had been young and liable to temptation.\n\nShe got up, some time later, and tiptoed to the door of Jim's room.\nInside she could hear his heavy, regular breathing. Her boy. Her only\nson.\n\nShe went back and crawled carefully into the bed.\n\nThere was an acrimonious argument between Jim and his father the next\nmorning, and Jim slammed out of the house, leaving chaos behind him. It\nwas then that Elizabeth learned that her father was going away. He said:\n\n\"Maybe I'm wrong, mother. I don't know. Perhaps, when I come back,\nI'll look around for a car. I don't want him driven to doing underhand\nthings.\"\n\n\"Are you going away?\" Elizabeth asked, surprised.\n\nIt appeared that he was. More than that, that he was going West with\nDick. It was all arranged and nobody had told her anything about it.\n\nShe was hurt and a trifle offended, and she cried a little about it.\nYet, as Dick explained to her later that day, it was simple enough. Her\nfather needed a rest, and besides, it was right that he should know all\nabout Dick's life before he came to Haverly.\n\n\"He's going to make me a present of something highly valuable, you\nknow.\"\n\n\"But it looks as though he didn't trust you!\"\n\n\"He's being very polite about it; but, of course, in his eyes I'm a\ncommon thief, stealing--\"\n\nShe would not let him go on.\n\nA certain immaturity, the blind confidence of youth in those it\nloves, explains Elizabeth's docility at that time. But underneath her\nsubmission that day was a growing uneasiness, fiercely suppressed.\nBuried deep, the battle between absolute trust and fear was beginning, a\nbattle which was so rapidly to mature her.\n\nNina, shrewd and suspicious, sensed something of nervous strain in her\nwhen she came in, later that day, to borrow a hat.\n\n\"Look here, Elizabeth,\" she began, \"I want to talk to you. Are you going\nto live in this--this hole all your life?\"\n\n\"Hole nothing,\" Elizabeth said, hotly. \"Really, Nina, I do think you\nmight be more careful of what you say.\"\n\n\"Oh, it's a dear old hole,\" Nina said negligently. \"But hole it is,\nnevertheless. Why in the world mother don't manage her servants--but no\nmatter about that now. Elizabeth, there's a lot of talk about you and\nDick Livingstone, and it makes me furious. When I think that you can\nhave Wallie Sayre by lifting your finger--\"\n\n\"And that I don't intend to lift my finger,\" Elizabeth interrupted.\n\n\"Then you're a fool. And it is Dick Livingstone!\"\n\n\"It is, Nina.\"\n\nNina's ambitious soul was harrowed.\n\n\"That stodgy old house,\" she said, \"and two old people! A general\nhouse-work girl, and you cooking on her Thursdays out! I wish you joy of\nit.\"\n\n\"I wonder,\" Elizabeth said calmly, \"whether it ever occurs to you that\nI may put love above houses and servants? Or that my life is my own, to\nlive exactly as I please? Because that is what I intend to do.\"\n\nNina rose angrily.\n\n\"Thanks,\" she said. \"I wish you joy of it.\" And went out, slamming the\ndoor behind her.\n\nThen, with only a day or so remaining before Dick's departure, and\nJim's hand already reaching for the shuttle, Elizabeth found herself\nthe object of certain unmistakable advances from Mrs. Sayre herself, and\nthat at a rose luncheon at the house on the hill.\n\nThe talk about Dick and Elizabeth had been slow in reaching the house\non the hill. When it came, via a little group on the terrace after the\nluncheon, Mrs. Sayre was upset and angry and inclined to blame Wallie.\nEverything that he wanted had come to him, all his life, and he did not\nknow how to go after things. He had sat by, and let this shabby-genteel\ndoctor, years older than the girl, walk away with her.\n\nNot that she gave up entirely. She knew the town, and its tendency\ntoward over-statement. And so she made a desperate attempt, that\nafternoon, to tempt Elizabeth. She took her through the greenhouses, and\nthen through the upper floors of the house. She showed her pictures\nof their boat at Miami, and of the house at Marblehead. Elizabeth was\npolitely interested and completely unresponsive.\n\n\"When you think,\" Mrs. Sayre said at last, \"that Wallie will have to\nassume a great many burdens one of these days, you can understand how\nanxious I am to have him marry the right sort of girl.\"\n\nShe thought Elizabeth flushed slightly.\n\n\"I am sure he will, Mrs. Sayre.\"\n\nMrs. Sayre tried a new direction.\n\n\"He will have all I have, my dear, and it is a great responsibility.\nUsed properly, money can be an agent of great good. Wallie's wife can be\na power, if she so chooses. She can look after the poor. I have a long\nlist of pensioners, but I am too old to add personal service.\"\n\n\"That would be wonderful,\" Elizabeth said gravely. For a moment she\nwished Dick were rich. There was so much to be done with money, and\nhow well he would know how to do it. She was thoughtful on the way\ndownstairs, and Mrs. Sayre felt some small satisfaction. Now if Wallie\nwould only do his part--\n\nIt was that night that Jim brought the tragedy on the Wheeler house that\nwas to lie heavy on it for many a day.\n\nThere had been a little dinner, one of those small informal affairs\nwhere Mrs. Wheeler, having found in the market the first of the broiling\nchickens and some fine green peas, bought them first and then sat down\nto the telephone to invite her friends. Mr. Oglethorpe, the clergyman,\nand his wife accepted cheerfully; Harrison Miller, resignedly. Then Mrs.\nWheeler drew a long, resolute breath and invited Mrs. Sayre. When that\nlady accepted with alacrity Mrs. Wheeler hastily revised her menu,\ntelephoned the florist for flowers, and spent a long half-hour with\nAnnie over plates and finger bowls.\n\nJim was not coming home, and Elizabeth was dining with Nina. Mrs.\nWheeler bustled about the house contentedly. Everything was going well,\nafter all. Before long there would be a car, and Jim would spend more\ntime at home. Nina and Leslie were happy again. And Elizabeth--not a\ngood match, perhaps, but a marriage for love, if ever there was one.\n\nShe sat at the foot of her table that night, rather too watchful of\nAnnie, but supremely content. She had herself scoured the loving cup\nto the last degree of brightness and it stood, full of flowers, in the\ncenter of the cloth.\n\nAt Nina's was a smaller but similar group. All over the village at that\ntime in the evening were similar groups, gathered around flowers and\ncandles; neatly served, cheerful and undramatic groups, with the house\ndoors closed and dogs waiting patiently outside in the long spring\ntwilight.\n\nElizabeth was watching Nina. Just so, she was deciding, would she some\nday preside at her own board. Perhaps before so very long, too. A little\nseparation, letters to watch for and answer, and then--\n\nThe telephone rang, and Leslie answered it. He did not come back;\ninstead they heard the house door close, and soon after the rumble of\nthe car as it left the garage. It stopped at the door, and Leslie came\nin.\n\n\"I'm sorry,\" he said, \"but I guess Elizabeth will have to go home. You'd\nbetter come along, Nina.\"\n\n\"What is it? Is somebody sick?\" Elizabeth gasped.\n\n\"Jim's been in an automobile accident. Steady now, Elizabeth! He's hurt,\nbut he's going to be all right.\"\n\nThe Wheeler house, when they got there, was brightly lighted. Annie was\ncrying in the hall, and in the living-room Mrs. Sayre stood alone, a\nstrange figure in a gaudy dress, but with her face strong and calm.\n\n\"They've gone to the hospital in my car,\" she said. \"They'll be there\nnow any minute, and Mr. Oglethorpe will telephone at once. You are to\nwait before starting in.\"\n\nThey all knew what that meant. It might be too late to start in. Nina\nwas crying hysterically, but Elizabeth could not cry. She stood dry-eyed\nby the telephone, listening to Mrs. Sayre and Leslie, but hardly hearing\nthem. They had got Dick Livingstone and he had gone on in. Mrs. Sayre\nwas afraid it had been one of Wallie's cars. She had begged Wallie to\ntell Jim to be careful in it. It had too much speed.\n\nThe telephone rang and Leslie took the receiver and pushed Elizabeth\ngently aside. He listened for a moment.\n\n\"Very well,\" he said. Then he hung up and stood still before he turned\naround:\n\n\"It isn't very good news,\" he said. \"I wish I could--Elizabeth!\"\n\nElizabeth had crumpled up in a small heap on the floor.\n\nAll through the long night that followed, with the movement of feet\nthrough the halls, with her mother's door closing and the ghastly\nsilence that followed it, with the dawn that came through the windows,\nthe dawn that to Jim meant not a new day, but a new life beyond their\nliving touch, all through the night Elizabeth was aware of two figures\nthat came and went. One was Dick, quiet, tender and watchful. And one\nwas of a heavy woman in a gaudy dress, her face old and weary in the\nmorning light, who tended her with gentle hands.\n\nShe fell asleep as the light was brightening in the East, with Dick\nholding her hands and kneeling on the floor beside her bed.\n\nIt was not until the next day that they knew that Jim had not been\nalone. A girl who was with him had been pinned under the car and had\ndied instantly.\n\nJim had woven his bit in the pattern and passed on. The girl was\nnegligible; she was, she had been. That was all. But Jim's death added\nthe last element to the impending catastrophe. It sent Dick West alone.\n\n\n\n\nXXII\n\nFor several days after his visit to the Livingstone ranch Louis Bassett\nmade no move to go to the cabin. He wandered around the town, made\npromiscuous acquaintances and led up, in careful conversations with such\nolder residents as he could find, to the Clark and Livingstone families.\nOf the latter he learned nothing; of the former not much that he had not\nknown before.\n\nOne day he happened on a short, heavy-set man, the sheriff, who had lost\nhis office on the strength of Jud Clark's escape, and had now recovered\nit. Bassett had brought some whisky with him, and on the promise of a\ndrink lured Wilkins to his room. Over his glass the sheriff talked.\n\n\"All this newspaper stuff lately about Jud Clark being alive is dead\nwrong,\" he declared, irritably. \"Maggie Donaldson was crazy. You can\nask the people here about her. They all know it. Those newspaper fellows\ndescended on us here with a tooth-brush apiece and a suitcase full of\nliquor, and thought they'd get something. Seemed to think we'd hold out\non them unless we got our skins full. But there isn't anything to hold\nout. Jud Clark's dead. That's all.\"\n\n\"Sure he's dead,\" Bassett agreed, amiably. \"You found his horse, didn't\nyou?\"\n\n\"Yes. Dead. And when you find a man's horse dead in the mountains in a\nblizzard, you don't need any more evidence. It was five months before\nyou could see a trail up the Goat that winter.\"\n\nBassett nodded, rose and poured out another drink.\n\n\"I suppose,\" he observed casually, \"that even if Clark turned up now, it\nwould be hard to convict him, wouldn't it?\"\n\nThe sheriff considered that, holding up his glass.\n\n\"Well, yes and no,\" he said. \"It was circumstantial evidence, mostly.\nNobody saw it done. The worst thing against him was his running off.\"\n\n\"How about witnesses?\"\n\n\"Nobody actually saw it done. John Donaldson came the nearest, and he's\ndead. Lucas's wife was still alive, the last I heard, and I reckon the\nvalet is floating around somewhere.\"\n\n\"I suppose if he did turn up you'd make a try for it.\" Bassett stared at\nthe end of his cigar.\n\n\"We'd make a try for it, all right,\" Wilkins said somberly. \"There are\nsome folks in this county still giving me the laugh over that case.\"\n\nThe next day Bassett hired a quiet horse, rolled in his raincoat two\ndays' supply of food, strapped it to the cantle of his saddle, and rode\ninto the mountains. He had not ridden for years, and at the end of the\nfirst hour he began to realize that he was in for a bad time. By noon\nhe was so sore that he could hardly get out of the saddle, and so stiff\nthat once out, he could barely get back again. All morning the horse\nhad climbed, twisting back and forth on a narrow canyon trail, grunting\noccasionally, as is the way of a horse on a steep grade. All morning\nthey had followed a roaring mountain stream, descending in small\ncataracts from the ice fields far above. And all morning Bassett had\nbeen mentally following that trail as it had been ridden ten years\nago by a boy maddened with fear and drink, who drove his horse forward\nthrough the night and the blizzard, with no objective and no hope.\n\nHe found it practically impossible to connect this frenzied fugitive\nwith the quiet man in his office chair at Haverly, the man who was or\nwas not Judson Clark. He lay on a bank at noon and faced the situation\nsquarely, while his horse, hobbled, grazed with grotesque little forward\njumps in an upland meadow. Either Dick Livingstone was Clark, or he\nwas the unknown occasional visitor at the Livingstone Ranch. If he\nwere Clark, and if that could be proved, there were two courses open to\nBassett. He could denounce him to the authorities and then spring\nthe big story of his career. Or he could let things stand. From a\nprofessional standpoint the first course attracted him, as a man he\nbegan to hate it. The last few days had shed a new light on Judson\nClark. He had been immensely popular; there were men in the town who\ntold about trying to save him from himself. He had been extravagant, but\nhe had also been generous. He had been \"a good kid,\" until liberty and\nmoney got hold of him. There had been more than one man in the sheriff's\nposse who hadn't wanted to find him.\n\nHe was tempted to turn back. The mountains surrounded him, somber and\nmajestically still. They made him feel infinitely small and rather\nimpertinent, as though he had come to penetrate the secrets they never\nyielded. He had almost to fight a conviction that they were hostile.\n\nAfter an hour or so he determined to go on. Let them throw him over a\ngorge if they so determined. He got up, grunting, and leading the horse\nbeside a boulder, climbed painfully into the saddle. To relieve his\ndepression he addressed the horse:\n\n\"It would be easier on both of us if you were two feet narrower in the\nbeam, old dear,\" he said.\n\nNevertheless, he made good time. By six o'clock he knew that he must\nhave made thirty odd miles, and that he must be near the cabin. Also\nthat it was going to be bitterly cold that night, under the snow fields,\nand that he had brought no wood axe. The deep valley was purple with\ntwilight by seven, and he could scarcely see the rough-drawn trail map\nhe had been following. And the trail grew increasingly bad. For the last\nmile or two the horse took its own way.\n\nIt wandered on, through fords and out of them, under the low-growing\nbranches of scrub pine, brushing his bruised legs against rocks. He had\ndefinitely decided that he had missed the cabin when the horse turned\noff the trail, and he saw it.\n\nIt was built of rough logs, the chinks once closed with mud which had\nfallen away. The door stood open, and his entrance into its darkness was\nfollowed by the scurrying of many little feet. Bassett unstrapped his\nraincoat from the saddle with fingers numb with cold, and flung it to\nthe ground. He uncinched and removed the heavy saddle, hobbled his horse\nand removed the bridle, and turned him loose with a slap on the flank.\n\n\"For the love of Mike, don't go far, old man,\" he besought him. And was\nstartled by the sound of his own voice.\n\nBy the light of his candle lantern the prospects were extremely poor.\nThe fir branches in the double-berthed bunk were dry and useless, the\nfloor was crumbling under his feet, and the roof of the lean-to had\nfallen in and crushed the rusty stove. In the cabin itself some one had\nrecently placed a large flat stone in a corner for a fireplace, with two\nslabs to back it, and above it had broken out a corner of the roof as\na chimney. Bassett thought he saw the handwork of some enterprising\njournalist, and smiled grimly.\n\nHe set to work with the resource of a man who had learned to take what\ncame, threw the dry bedding onto the slab and set a match to it, brought\nin portions of the lean-to roof for further supply for the fire, opened\na can of tomatoes and set it on the edge of the hearth to heat, and\nsliced bacon into his diminutive frying-pan.\n\nIt was too late for any examination that night. He ate his supper from\nthe rough table, drawing up to it a broken chair, and afterwards brought\nin more wood for his fire. Then, with a lighted cigar, and with his\nboots steaming on the hearth, he sat in front of the blaze and fell into\ndeep study.\n\nHe was aching in every muscle when he finally stretched out on the bare\nboards of the lower bunk. While he slept small furry noses appeared in\nthe openings in the broken floor, to be followed by little bodies that\nmoved cautiously out into the open. He roused once and peered over the\nedge of the bunk. Several field mice were basking in front of the dying\nembers of the fire, and two were sitting on his boots. He grinned at\nthem and lay back again, but he found himself fully awake and very\nuncomfortable. He lay there, contemplating his own folly, and demanding\nof himself almost fiercely what he had expected to get out of all this\neffort and misery. For ten years or so men had come here. Wilkins had\ncome, for one, and there had been others. And had found nothing, and had\ngone away. And now he was there, the end of the procession, to look for\nGod knows what.\n\nHe pulled the raincoat up around his shoulders, and lay back stiffly.\nThen--he was not an imaginative man--he began to feel that eyes were\nstaring at him, furtive, hidden eyes, intently watching him.\n\nWithout moving he began to rake the cabin with his eyes, wall to wall,\ncorner to corner. He turned, cautiously, and glanced at the door into\nthe lean-to. It gaped, cavernous and empty. But the sense of being\nwatched persisted, and when he looked at the floor the field mice had\ndisappeared.\n\nHe began gradually to see more clearly as his eyes grew accustomed to\nthe semi-darkness, and he felt, too, that he could almost locate the\ndirection of the menace. For as a menace he found himself considering\nit. It was the broken, windowless East wall, opposite the bunk.\n\nAfter a time the thing became intolerable. He reached for his revolver,\nand getting quickly out of the bunk, ran to the doorway and threw open\nthe door, to find himself peering into a blackness like a wall, and to\nhear a hasty crunching of the underbrush that sounded like some animal\nin full flight.\n\nWith the sounds, and his own movement, the terror died. The cold night\nair on his face, the feel of the pine needles under his stockinged\nfeet, brought him back to sense and normality. Some creature of the\nwilderness, a deer or a bear, perhaps, had been moving stealthily\noutside the cabin, and it was sound he had heard, not a gaze he had\nfelt. He was rather cynically amused at himself. He went back into the\ncabin, closed the door, and stooped to turn his boots over before the\nfire.\n\nIt was while he was stooping that he heard a horse galloping off along\nthe trail.\n\nHe did not go to sleep again. Now and then he considered the possibility\nof its having been his own animal, somehow freed of the rope and\nfrightened by the same thing that had frightened him. But when with the\nfirst light he went outside, his horse, securely hobbled, was grazing on\nthe scant pasture not far away.\n\nBefore he cooked his breakfast he made a minute examination of the\nground beneath the East wall, but the earth was hard, and a broken\nbranch or two might have been caused by his horse. He had no skill in\nwoodcraft, and in the broad day his alarm seemed almost absurd. Some\nfree horse on the range had probably wandered into the vicinity of the\ncabin, and had made off again on a trot. Nevertheless, he made up\nhis mind not to remain over another night, but to look about after\nbreakfast, and then to start down again.\n\nHe worked on his boots, dry and hard after yesterday's wetting, fried\nhis bacon and dropped some crackers into the sizzling fat, and ate\nquickly. After that he went out to the trail and inspected it. He had\nan idea that range horses were mostly unshod, and that perhaps the trail\nwould reveal something. But it was unused and overgrown. Not until he\nhad gone some distance did he find anything. Then in a small bare spot\nhe found in the dust the imprints of a horse's shoes, turned down the\ntrail up which he had come.\n\nEven then he was slow to read into the incident anything that related to\nhimself or to his errand. He went over the various contingencies of the\ntrail: a ranger, on his way to town; a forest fire somewhere; a belated\nhound from the newspaper pack. He was convinced now that human eyes had\nwatched him for some time through the log wall the night before, but he\ncould not connect them with the business in hand.\n\nHe set resolutely about his business, which was to turn up, somehow,\nsome way, a proof of the truth of Maggie Donaldson's dying statement. To\nbegin with then he accepted that statement, to find where it would lead\nhim, and it led him, eventually, to the broken-down stove under the\nfallen roof of the lean-to.\n\nHe deliberately set himself to work, at first, to reconstruct the life\nin the cabin. Jud would have had the lower bunk, David the upper. The\nskeleton of a cot bed in the lean-to would have been Maggie's. But none\nof them yielded anything.\n\nVery well. Having accepted that they lived here, it was from here that\nthe escape was made. They would have started the moment the snow was\nmelted enough to let them get out, and they would have taken, not the\ntrail toward the town, but some other and circuitous route toward the\nrailroad. But there had been things to do before they left. They would\nhave cleared the cabin of every trace of occupancy; the tin cans,\nClark's clothing, such bedding as they could not carry. The cans must\nhave been a problem; the clothes, of course, could have been burned.\nBut there were things, like buttons, that did not burn easily. Clark's\nwatch, if he wore one, his cuff links. Buried?\n\nIt occurred to him that they might have disposed of some of the\nunburnable articles under the floor, and he lifted a rough board or two.\nBut to pursue the search systematically he would have needed a pickaxe,\nand reluctantly he gave it up and turned his attention to the lean-to\nand the buried stove.\n\nThe stove lay in a shallow pit, filled with ancient ashes and crumbled\nbits of wood from the roof. It lay on its side, its sheet-iron sides\ncollapsed, its long chimney disintegrated. He was in a heavy sweat\nbefore he had uncovered it and was able to remove it from its bed of\nashes and pine needles. This done, he brought his candle-lantern and\nsettled himself cross-legged on the ground.\n\nHis first casual inspection of the ashes revealed nothing. He set to\nwork more carefully then, picking them up by handfuls, examining and\ndiscarding. Within ten minutes he had in a pile beside him some burned\nand blackened metal buttons, the eyelets and a piece of leather from a\nshoe, and the almost unrecognizable nib of a fountain pen.\n\nHe sat with them in the palm of his hand. Taken alone, each one was\ninsignificant, proved nothing whatever. Taken all together, they assumed\nvast proportions, became convincing, became evidence.\n\nLate that night he descended stiffly at the livery stable, and turned\nhis weary horse over to a stableman.\n\n\"Looks dead beat,\" said the stableman, eyeing the animal.\n\n\"He's got nothing on me,\" Bassett responded cheerfully. \"Better give him\na hot bath and put him to bed. That's what I'm going to do.\"\n\nHe walked back to the hotel, glad to stretch his aching muscles. The\nlobby was empty, and behind the desk the night clerk was waiting for the\nmidnight train. Bassett was wide awake by that time, and he went back to\nthe desk and lounged against it.\n\n\"You look as though you'd struck oil,\" said the night clerk.\n\n\"Oil! I'll tell you what I have struck. I've struck a livery stable\nsaddle two million times in the last two days.\"\n\nThe clerk grinned, and Bassett idly pulled the register toward him.\n\n\"J. Smith, Minneapolis,\" he read. Then he stopped and stared. Richard\nLivingstone was registered on the next line above.\n\n\n\n\nXXIII\n\nDick had found it hard to leave Elizabeth, for she clung to him in her\ngrief with childish wistfulness. He found, too, that her family depended\non him rather than on Leslie Ward for moral support. It was to him that\nWalter Wheeler looked for assurance that the father had had no indirect\nresponsibility for the son's death; it was to him that Jim's mother,\nlying gray-faced and listless in her bed or on her couch, brought her\nanxious questionings. Had Jim suffered? Could they have avoided it? And\nan insistent demand to know who and what had been the girl who was with\nhim.\n\nIn spite of his own feeling that he would have to go to Norada quickly,\nbefore David became impatient over his exile, Dick took a few hours to\nfind the answer to that question. But when he found it he could not\ntell them. The girl had been a dweller in the shady byways of life, had\nplayed her small unmoral part and gone on, perhaps to some place where\nmen were kinder and less urgent. Dick did not judge her. He saw her, as\nher kind had been through all time, storm centers of the social world,\npassively and unconsciously blighting, at once the hunters and the prey.\n\nHe secured her former address from the police, a three-story brick\nrooming-house in the local tenderloin, and waited rather uncomfortably\nfor the mistress of the place to see him. She came at last, a big woman,\nvast and shapeless and with an amiable loose smile, and she came in with\nthe light step of the overfleshed, only to pause in the doorway and to\nstare at him.\n\n\"My God!\" she said. \"I thought you were dead!\"\n\n\"I'm afraid you're mistaking me for some one else, aren't you?\"\n\nShe looked at him carefully.\n\n\"I'd have sworn--\" she muttered, and turning to the button inside the\ndoor she switched on the light. Then she surveyed him again.\n\n\"What's your name?\"\n\n\"Livingstone. Doctor Livingstone. I called--\"\n\n\"Is that for me, or for the police?\"\n\n\"Now see here,\" he said pleasantly. \"I don't know who you are mistaking\nme for, and I'm not hiding from the police. Here's my card, and I\nhave come from the family of a young man named Wheeler, who was killed\nrecently in an automobile accident.\"\n\nShe took the card and read it, and then resumed her intent scrutiny of\nhim.\n\n\"Well, you fooled me all right,\" she said at last. \"I thought you\nwere--well, never mind that. What about this Wheeler family? Are they\ngoing to settle with the undertaker? Because I tell you flat, I can't\nand won't. She owed me a month's rent, and her clothes won't bring over\nseventy-five or a hundred dollars.\"\n\nAs he left he was aware that she stood in the doorway looking after\nhim. He drove home slowly in the car, and on the way he made up a kindly\nstory to tell the family. He could not let them know that Jim had been\nseeking love in the byways of life. And that night he mailed a check in\npayment of the undertaker's bill, carefully leaving the stub empty.\n\nOn the third day after Jim's funeral he started for Norada. An interne\nfrom a local hospital, having newly finished his service there, had\nagreed to take over his work for a time. But Dick was faintly jealous\nwhen he installed Doctor Reynolds in his office, and turned him over to\na mystified Minnie to look after.\n\n\"Is he going to sleep in your bed?\" she demanded belligerently.\n\nShe was only partially mollified when she found Doctor Reynolds was to\nhave the spare room. She did not like the way things were going, she\nconfided to Mike. Why wasn't she to let on to Mrs. Crosby that Doctor\nDick had gone away? Or to the old doctor? Both of them away, and that\nlittle upstart in the office ready to steal their patients and hang out\nhis own sign the moment they got back!\n\nUnused to duplicity as he was, Dick found himself floundering along an\nextremely crooked path. He wrote a half dozen pleasant, non-committal\nletters to David and Lucy, spending an inordinate time on them, and\ngave them to Walter Wheeler to mail at stated intervals. But his chief\ndifficulty was with Elizabeth. Perhaps he would have told her; there\nwere times when he had to fight his desire to have her share his anxiety\nas well as know the truth about him. But she was already carrying the\nburden of Jim's tragedy, and her father, too, was insistent that she be\nkept in ignorance.\n\n\"Until she can have the whole thing,\" he said, with the new heaviness\nwhich had crept into his voice.\n\nBeside that real trouble Dick's looked dim and nebulous. Other things\ncould be set right; there was always a fighting chance. It was only\ndeath that was final.\n\nElizabeth went to the station to see him off, a small slim thing in\na black frock, with eyes that persistently sought his face, and a\ndetermined smile. He pulled her arm through his, so he might hold her\nhand, and when he found that she was wearing her ring he drew her even\ncloser, with a wave of passionate possession.\n\n\"You are mine. My little girl.\"\n\n\"I am yours. For ever and ever.\"\n\nBut they assumed a certain lightness after that, each to cheer the\nother. As when she asserted that she was sure she would always know the\nmoment he stopped thinking about her, and he stopped, with any number of\npeople about, and said:\n\n\"That's simply terrible! Suppose, when we are married, my mind turns on\nsuch a mundane thing as beefsteak and onions? Will you simply walk out\non me?\"\n\nHe stood on the lowest step of the train until her figure was lost in\nthe darkness, and the porter expostulated. He was, that night, a little\ndrunk with love, and he did not read the note she had thrust into his\nhand at the last moment until he was safely in his berth, his long\nfigure stretched diagonally to find the length it needed.\n\n\"Darling, darling Dick,\" she had written. \"I wonder so often how you can\ncare for me, or what I have done to deserve you. And I cannot write how\nI feel, just as I cannot say it. But, Dick dear, I have such a terrible\nfear of losing you, and you are my life now. You will be careful and not\nrun any risks, won't you? And just remember this always. Wherever you\nare and wherever I am, I am thinking of you and waiting for you.\"\n\nHe read it three times, until he knew it by heart, and he slept with it\nin the pocket of his pajama coat.\n\nThree days later he reached Norada, and registered at the Commercial\nHotel. The town itself conveyed nothing to him. He found it totally\nunfamiliar, and for its part the town passed him by without a glance.\nA new field had come in, twenty miles from the old one, and had brought\nwith it a fresh influx of prospectors, riggers, and lease buyers. The\nhotel was crowded.\n\nThat was his first disappointment. He had been nursing the hope that\nsurroundings which he must once have known well would assist him in\nfinding himself. That was the theory, he knew. He stood at the window of\nhis hotel room, with its angular furniture and the Gideon Bible, and for\nthe first time he realized the difficulty of what he had set out to do.\nHad he been able to take David into his confidence he would have had the\nnames of one or two men to go to, but as things were he had nothing.\n\nThe almost morbid shrinking he felt from exposing his condition was\nincreased, rather than diminished, in the new surroundings. He would,\nof course, go to the ranch at Dry River, and begin his inquiries from\nthere, but not until now had he realized what that would mean; his\nrecognition by people he could not remember, the questions he could not\nanswer.\n\nHe knew the letter to David from beginning to end, but he got it out and\nread it again. Who was this Bassett, and what mischief was he up to? Why\nshould he himself be got out of town quickly and the warning burned? Who\nwas \"G\"? And why wouldn't the simplest thing be to locate this Bassett\nhimself?\n\nThe more he considered that the more obvious it seemed as a solution,\nprovided of course he could locate the man. Whether Bassett were\nfriendly or inimical, he was convinced that he knew or was finding out\nsomething concerning himself which David was keeping from him.\n\nHe was relieved when he went down to the desk to find that his man was\nregistered there, although the clerk reported him out of town. But the\nvery fact that only a few hours or days separated him from a solution of\nthe mystery heartened him.\n\nHe ate his dinner alone, unnoticed, and after dinner, in the writing\nroom, with its mission furniture and its traveling men copying orders,\nhe wrote a letter to Elizabeth. Into it he put some of the things that\nlay too deep for speech when he was with her, and because he had so much\nto say and therefore wrote extremely fast, a considerable portion of\nit was practically illegible. Then, as though he could hurry the trains\nEast, he put a special delivery stamp on it.\n\nWith that off his mind, and the need of exercise after the trip\ninsistent, he took his hat and wandered out into the town. The main\nstreet was crowded; moving picture theaters were summoning their evening\naudiences with bright lights and colored posters, and automobiles lined\nthe curb. But here and there an Indian with braids and a Stetson hat, or\na cowpuncher from a ranch in boots and spurs reminded him that after all\nthis was the West, the horse and cattle country. It was still twilight,\nand when he had left the main street behind him he began to have a\nsense of the familiar. Surely he had stood here before, had seen the\ncourt-house on its low hill, the row of frame houses in small gardens\njust across the street. It seemed infinitely long ago, but very real.\nHe even remembered dimly an open place at the other side of the building\nwhere the ranchmen tied their horses. To test himself he walked around.\nYes, it was there, but no horses stood there now, heads drooping, bridle\nreins thrown loosely over the rail. Only a muddy automobile, without\nlights, and a dog on guard beside it.\n\nHe spoke to the dog, and it came and sniffed at him. Then it squatted in\nfront of him, looking up into his face.\n\n\"Lonely, old chap, aren't you?\" he said. \"Well, you've got nothing on\nme.\"\n\nHe felt a little cheered as he turned back toward the hotel. A few\nencounters with the things of his youth, and perhaps the cloud would\nclear away. Already the court-house had stirred some memories. And on\nturning back down the hill he had another swift vision, photographically\ndistinct but unrelated to anything that had preceded or followed it. It\nwas like a few feet cut from a moving picture film.\n\nHe was riding down that street at night on a small horse, and his father\nwas beside him on a tall one. He looked up at his father, and he seemed\nvery large. The largest man in the world. And the most important.\n\nIt began and stopped there, and his endeavor to follow it further\nresulted in its ultimately leaving him. It faded, became less real,\nuntil he wondered if he had not himself conjured it. But that experience\ntaught him something. Things out of the past would come or they would\nnot come, but they could not be forced. One could not will to revive\nthem.\n\nHe stood at a window facing north that night, under the impression\nit was east, and sent his love and an inarticulate sort of prayer to\nElizabeth, for her safety and happiness, in the general direction of the\nArctic Circle.\n\nBassett had not returned in the morning, and he found himself with a\nday on his hands. He decided to try the experiment of visiting the\nLivingstone ranch, or at least of viewing it from a safe distance, with\nthe hope of a repetition of last night's experience. Of all his childish\nmemories the ranch house, next to his father, was most distinct. When\nhe had at various times tried to analyze what things he recalled he had\nfound that what they lacked of normal memory was connection. They stood\nout, like the one the night before, each complete in itself, brief, and\nhaving no apparent relation to what had gone before or what came after.\n\nBut the ranch house had been different. The pictures were mostly\nsuperimposed on it; it was their background. Himself standing on the\nmountain looking down at it, and his father pointing to it; the tutor\nwho was afraid of horses, sitting at a big table in a great wood-ceiled\nand wood-paneled room; a long gallery or porch along one side of the\nbuilding and rooms added on to the house so that one had to go along the\ngallery to reach them; a gun-room full of guns.\n\nWhen, much later, Dick was able calmly to review that day, he found his\nrecollection of it confused by the events that followed, but one thing\nstood out as clearly as his later knowledge of the almost incredible\nfact that for one entire day and for the evening of another, he had\nopenly appeared in Norada and had not been recognized. That fact was his\ndiscovery that the Livingstone ranch house had no place in his memory\nwhatever.\n\nHe had hired a car and a driver, a driver who asserted that this was\nthe old Livingstone ranch house. And it bore no resemblance, not the\nfaintest, to the building he remembered. It did not lie where it should\nhave lain. The mountains were too far behind it. It was not the house.\nThe fields were not the proper fields. It was wrong, all wrong.\n\nHe went no closer than the highway, because it was not necessary. He\nordered the car to turn and go back, and for the first and only time he\nwas filled with bitter resentment against David. David had fooled him.\nHe sat beside the driver, his face glowering and his eyes hot, and let\nhis indignation burn in him like a flame.\n\nHours afterwards he had, of course, found excuses for David. Accepted\nthem, rather, as a part of the mystery which wrapped him about. But they\nhad no effect on the decision he made during that miserable ride back to\nNorada, when he determined to see the man Bassett and get the truth out\nof him if he had to choke it out.\n\n\n\n\nXXIV\n\nBassett was astounded when he saw Dick's signature on the hotel\nregister. It destroyed, in one line, every theory he held. That Judson\nClark should return to Norada after his flight was incredible. Ten years\nwas only ten years after all. It was not a lifetime. There were men in\nthe town who had known Clark well.\n\nNevertheless for a time he held to his earlier conviction, even fought\nfor it. He went so far as to wonder if Clark had come back for a tardy\nsurrender. Men had done that before this, had carried a burden for\nyears, had reached the breaking point, had broken. But he dismissed\nthat. There had been no evidence of breaking in the young man in the\noffice chair. He found himself thrown back, finally, on the story of the\nWasson woman, and wondering if he would have to accept it after all.\n\nThe reaction from his certainty in the cabin to uncertainty again made\nhim fretful and sleepless. It was almost morning before he relaxed on\nhis hard hotel bed enough to sleep.\n\nHe wakened late, and telephoned down for breakfast. His confusion had\nnot decreased with the night, and while he got painfully out of bed and\nprepared to shave and dress, his thoughts were busy. There was no doubt\nin his mind that, in spite of the growth of the town, the newcomer would\nbe under arrest almost as soon as he made his appearance. A resemblance\nthat could deceive Beverly Carlysle's brother could deceive others, and\nwould. That he had escaped so long amazed him.\n\nBy the time he had bathed he had developed a sort of philosophic\nacceptance of the new situation. There would be no exclusive story now,\nno scoop. The events of the next few hours were for every man to read.\nHe shrugged his shoulders as, partially dressed, he carried his shaving\nmaterials into the better light of his bedroom.\n\nWith his face partially lathered he heard a knock at the door, and sang\nout a not uncheerful \"Come in.\" It happened, then, that it was in\nhis mirror that he learned that his visitor was not the waiter, but\nLivingstone himself. He had an instant of stunned amazement before he\nturned.\n\n\"I beg your pardon,\" Dick said. \"I was afraid you'd get out before I\nsaw you. My name's Livingstone, and I want to talk to you, if you don't\nmind. If you like I'll come back later.\"\n\nBassett perceived two things simultaneously; that owing probably to the\nlather on his face he had not been recognized, and that the face of the\nman inside the door was haggard and strained.\n\n\"That's all right. Come in and sit down. I'll get this stuff off my face\nand be with you in a jiffy.\"\n\nBut he was very deliberate in the bathroom. His astonishment grew,\nrather than decreased. Clearly Livingstone had not known him. How, then,\nhad he known that he was in Norada? And when he recognized him, as he\nwould in a moment, what then? He put on his collar and tied his tie\nslowly. Gregory might be the key. Gregory might have found out that he\nhad started for Norada and warned him. Then, if that were true, this man\nwas Clark after all. But if he were Clark he wouldn't be there. It was\nlike a kitten after its tail. It whirled in a circle and got nowhere.\n\nThe waiter had laid his breakfast and gone when he emerged from the\nbathroom, and Dick was standing by the window looking out. He turned.\n\n\"I'm here, Mr. Bassett, on rather a peculiar--\" He stopped and looked at\nBassett. \"I see. You were in my office about a month ago, weren't you?\"\n\n\"For a headache, yes.\" Bassett was very wary and watchful, but there was\nno particular unfriendliness in his visitor's eyes.\n\n\"It never occurred to me that you might be Bassett,\" Dick said gravely.\n\"Never mind about that. Eat your breakfast. Do you mind if I talk while\nyou do it?\"\n\n\"Will you have some coffee? I can get a glass from the bathroom. It\ntakes a week to get a waiter here.\"\n\n\"Thanks. Yes.\"\n\nThe feeling of unreality grew in the reporter's mind. It increased still\nfurther when they sat opposite each other, the small table with its\nBible on the lower shelf between them, while he made a pretense at\nbreakfasting.\n\n\"First of all,\" Dick said, at last, \"I was not sure I had found the\nright man. You are the only Bassett in the place, however, and you're\nregistered from my town. So I took a chance. I suppose that headache was\nnot genuine.\"\n\nBassett hesitated.\n\n\"No\" he said at last.\n\n\"What you really wanted to do was to see me, then?\"\n\n\"In a way, yes.\"\n\n\"I'll ask you one more question. It may clear the air. Does this mean\nanything to you? I'll tell you now that it doesn't, to me.\"\n\nFrom his pocketbook he took the note addressed to David, and passed it\nover the table. Bassett looked at him quickly and took it.\n\n\"Before you read it, I'll explain something. It was not sent to me. It\nwas sent to my--to Doctor David Livingstone. It happened to fall into my\nhands. I've come a long way to find out what it means.\"\n\nHe paused, and looked the reporter straight in the eyes. \"I am laying my\ncards on the table, Bassett. This 'G,' whoever he is, is clearly warning\nmy uncle against you. I want to know what he is warning him about.\"\n\nBassett read the note carefully, and looked up.\n\n\"I suppose you know who 'G' is?\"\n\n\"I do not. Do you?\"\n\n\"I'll give you another name, and maybe you'll get it. A name that I\nthink will mean something to you. Beverly Carlysle.\"\n\n\"The actress?\"\n\nBassett had an extraordinary feeling of unreality, followed by one of\ndoubt. Either the fellow was a very good actor, or--\n\n\"Sorry,\" Dick said slowly. \"I don't seem to get it. I don't know that\n'G' is as important as his warning. That note's a warning.\"\n\n\"Yes. It's a warning. And I don't think you need me to tell you what\nabout.\"\n\n\"Concerning my uncle, or myself?\"\n\n\"Are you trying to put it over on me that you don't know?\"\n\n\"That's what I'm trying to do,\" Dick said, with a sort of grave\npatience.\n\nThe reporter liked courage when he saw it, and he was compelled to a\nsort of reluctant admiration.\n\n\"You've got your courage with you,\" he observed. \"How long do you\nsuppose it will be after you set foot on the streets of this town before\nyou're arrested? How do you know I won't send for the police myself?\"\n\n\"I know damned well you won't,\" Dick said grimly. \"Not before I'm\nthrough with you. You've chosen to interest yourself in me. I suppose\nyou don't deny the imputation in that letter. You'll grant that I have\na right to know who and what you are, and just what you are interested\nin.\"\n\n\"Right-o,\" the reporter said cheerfully, glad to get to grips; and\nto stop a fencing that was getting nowhere. \"I'm connected with the\nTimes-Republican, in your own fair city. I was in the theater the night\nGregory recognized you. Verbum sap.\"\n\n\"This Gregory is the 'G'?\"\n\n\"Oh, quit it, Clark,\" Bassett said, suddenly impatient. \"That letter's\nthe last proof I needed. Gregory wrote it after he'd seen David\nLivingstone. He wouldn't have written it if he and the old man hadn't\ncome to an understanding. I've been to the cabin. My God, man, I've even\ngot the parts of your clothing that wouldn't burn! You can thank Maggie\nDonaldson for that.\"\n\n\"Donaldson,\" Dick repeated. \"That was it. I couldn't remember her name.\nThe woman in the cabin. Maggie. And Jack. Jack Donaldson.\"\n\nHe got up, and was apparently dizzy, for he caught at the table.\n\n\"Look here,\" Bassett said, \"let me give you a drink. You look all in.\"\n\nBut Dick shook his head.\n\n\"No, thanks just the same. I'll ask you to be plain with me, Bassett. I\nam--I have become engaged to a girl, and--well, I want the story. That's\nall.\"\n\nAnd, when Bassett only continued to stare at him:\n\n\"I suppose I've begun wrong end first. I forgot about how it must seem\nto you. I dropped a block out of my life about ten years ago. Can't\nremember it. I'm not proud of it, but it's the fact. What I'm trying to\ndo now is to fill in the gap. But I've got to, somehow. I owe it to the\ngirl.\"\n\nWhen Bassett could apparently find nothing to say he went on:\n\n\"You say I may be arrested if I go out on the street. And you rather\nmore than intimate that a woman named Beverly Carlysle is mixed up in it\nsomehow. I take it that I knew her.\"\n\n\"Yes. You knew her,\" Bassett said slowly. At the intimation in his tone\nDick surveyed him for a moment without speaking. His face, pale before,\ntook on a grayish tinge.\n\n\"I wasn't--married to her?\"\n\n\"No. You didn't marry her. See here, Clark, this is straight goods, is\nit? You're not trying to put something over on me? Because if you are,\nyou needn't.  I'd about made up my mind to follow the story through for\nmy own satisfaction, and then quit cold on it. When a man's pulled\nhimself out of the mud as you have it's not my business to pull him\ndown. But I don't want you to pull any bunk.\"\n\nDick winced.\n\n\"Out of the mud!\" he said. \"No. I'm telling you the truth, Bassett. I\nhave some fragmentary memories, places and people, but no names, and\nall of them, I imagine from my childhood. I pick up at a cabin in the\nmountains, with snow around, and David Livingstone feeding me soup with\na tin spoon.\" He tried to smile and failed. His face twitched. \"I could\nstand it for myself,\" he said, \"but I've tied another life to mine, like\na cursed fool, and now you speak of a woman, and of arrest. Arrest! For\nwhat?\"\n\n\"Suppose,\" Bassett said after a moment, \"suppose you let that go just\nnow, and tell me more about this--this gap. You're a medical man. You've\nprobably gone into your own case pretty thoroughly. I'm accepting your\nstatement, you see. As a matter of fact it must be true, or you wouldn't\nbe here. But I've got to know what I'm doing before I lay my cards\non the table. Make it simple, if you can. I don't know your medical\njargon.\"\n\nDick did his best. The mind closed down now and then, mainly from a\nshock. No, there was no injury required. He didn't think he had had an\ninjury. A mental shock would do it, if it were strong enough. And fear.\nIt was generally fear. He had never considered himself braver than the\nother fellow, but no man liked to think that he had a cowardly mind.\nEven if things hadn't broken as they had, he'd have come back before\nhe went to the length of marriage, to find out what it was he had been\nafraid of. He paused then, to give Bassett a chance to tell him, but the\nreporter only said: \"Go on, you put your cards on the table, and then\nI'll lay mine out.\"\n\nDick went on. He didn't blame Bassett. If there was something that was\nin his line of work, he understood. At the same time he wanted to save\nDavid anything unpleasant. (The word \"unpleasant\" startled Bassett, by\nits very inadequacy.) He knew now that David had built up for him an\nidentity that probably did not exist, but he wanted Bassett to know that\nthere could never be doubt of David's high purpose and his essential\nfineness.\n\n\"Whatever I was before.\" he finished simply, \"and I'll get that from you\nnow, if I am any sort of a man at all it is his work.\"\n\nHe stood up and braced himself. It had been clear to Bassett for ten\nminutes that Dick was talking against time, against the period of\nrevelation. He would have it, but he was mentally bracing himself\nagainst it.\n\n\"I think,\" he said, \"I'll have that whisky now.\"\n\nBassett poured him a small drink, and took a turn about the room while\nhe drank it. He was perplexed and apprehensive. Strange as the story\nwas, he was convinced that he had heard the truth. He had, now and then,\nrun across men who came back after a brief disappearance, with a cock\nand bull story of forgetting who they were, and because nearly always\nthese men vanished at the peak of some crisis they had always been open\nto suspicion. Perhaps, poor devils, they had been telling the truth\nafter all. So the mind shut down, eh? Closed like a grave over the\nunbearable!\n\nHis own part in the threatening catastrophe began to obsess him. Without\nthe warning from Gregory there would have been no return to Norada, no\narrest. It had all been dead and buried, until he himself had revived\nit. And a girl, too! The girl in the blue dress at the theater, of\ncourse.\n\nDick put down the glass.\n\n\"I'm ready, if you are.\"\n\n\"Does the name of Clark recall anything to you?\"\n\n\"Nothing.\"\n\n\"Judson Clark? Jud Clark?\"\n\nDick passed his hand over his forehead wearily.\n\n\"I'm not sure,\" he said. \"It sounds familiar, and then it doesn't. It\ndoesn't mean anything to me, if you get that. If it's a key, it doesn't\nunlock. That's all. Am I Judson Clark?\"\n\nOddly enough, Bassett found himself now seeking for hope of escape in\nthe very situation that had previously irritated him, in the story he\nhad heard at Wasson's. He considered, and said, almost violently:\n\n\"Look here, I may have made a mistake. I came out here pretty well\nconvinced I'd found the solution to an old mystery, and for that matter\nI think I have. But there's a twist in it that isn't clear, and until\nit is clear I'm not going to saddle you with an identity that may not\nbelong to you. You are one of two men. One of them is Judson Clark, and\nI'll be honest with you; I'm pretty sure you're Clark. The other I don't\nknow, but I have reason to believe that he spent part of his time with\nHenry Livingstone at Dry River.\"\n\n\"I went to the Livingstone ranch yesterday. I remember my early home.\nThat wasn't it. Which one of these two men will be arrested if he is\nrecognized?\"\n\n\"Clark.\"\n\n\"For what?\"\n\n\"I'm coming to that. I suppose you'll have to know. Another drink? No?\nAll right. About ten years ago, or a little less, a young chap called\nJudson Clark got into trouble here, and headed into the mountains in a\nblizzard. He was supposed to have frozen to death. But recently a woman\nnamed Donaldson made a confession on her deathbed. She said that she had\nhelped to nurse Clark in a mountain cabin, and that with the aid of some\none unnamed he had got away.\"\n\n\"Then I'm Clark. I remember her, and the cabin.\"\n\nThere was a short silence following that admission. To Dick, it was\nfilled with the thought of Elizabeth, and of her relation to what he was\nabout to hear. Again he braced himself for what was coming.\n\n\"I suppose,\" he said at last, \"that if I ran away I was in pretty\nserious trouble. What was it?\"\n\n\"We've got no absolute proof that you are Clark, remember. You don't\nknow, and Maggie Donaldson was considered not quite sane before she\ndied. I've told you there's a chance you are the other man.\"\n\n\"All right. What had Clark done?\"\n\n\"He had shot a man.\"\n\nThe reporter was instantly alarmed. If Dick had been haggard before, he\nwas ghastly now. He got up slowly and held to the back of his chair.\n\n\"Not--murder?\" he asked, with stiff lips.\n\n\"No,\" Bassett said quickly. \"Not at all. See here, you've had about all\nyou can stand. Remember, we don't even know you are Clark. All I said\nwas--\"\n\n\"I understand that. It was murder, wasn't it?\"\n\n\"Well, there had been a quarrel, I understand. The law allows for that,\nI think.\"\n\nDick went slowly to the window, and stood with his back to Bassett. For\na long time the room was quiet. In the street below long lines of cars\nin front of the hotel denoted the luncheon hour. An Indian woman with a\nchild in the shawl on her back stopped in the street, looked up at Dick\nand extended a beaded belt. With it still extended she continued to\nstare at his white face.\n\n\"The man died, of course?\" he asked at last, without turning.\n\n\"Yes. I knew him. He wasn't any great loss. It was at the Clark ranch.\nI don't believe a conviction would be possible, although they would try\nfor one. It was circumstantial evidence.\"\n\n\"And I ran away?\"\n\n\"Clark ran away,\" Bassett corrected him. \"As I've told you, the\nauthorities here believe he is dead.\"\n\nAfter an even longer silence Dick turned.\n\n\"I told you there was a girl. I'd like to think out some way to keep\nthe thing from her, before I surrender myself. If I can protect her, and\nDavid--\"\n\n\"I tell you, you don't even know you are Clark.\"\n\n\"All right. If I'm not, they'll know. If I am--I tell you I'm not going\nthrough the rest of my life with a thing like that hanging over me.\nMaggie Donaldson was sane enough. Why, when I look back, I know our\nleaving the cabin was a flight. I'm not Henry Livingstone's son, because\nhe never had a son. I can tell you what the Clark ranch house looks\nlike.\" And after a pause: \"Can you imagine the reverse of a dream when\nyou've dreamed you are guilty of something and wake up to find you are\ninnocent? Who was the man?\"\n\nBassett watched him narrowly.\n\n\"His name was Lucas. Howard Lucas.\"\n\n\"All right. Now we have that, where does Beverly Carlysle come in?\"\n\n\"Clark was infatuated with her. The man he shot was the man she had\nmarried.\"\n\n\n\n\nXXV\n\nShortly after that Dick said he would go to his room. He was still pale,\nbut his eyes looked bright and feverish, and Bassett went with him,\nuneasily conscious that something was not quite right. Dick spoke only\nonce on the way.\n\n\"My head aches like the mischief,\" he said, and his voice was dull and\nlifeless.\n\nHe did not want Bassett to go with him, but Bassett went, nevertheless.\nDick's statement, that he meant to surrender himself, had filled him\nwith uneasiness. He determined, following him along the hall, to keep a\nclose guard on him for the next few hours, but beyond that, just then,\nhe did not try to go. If it were humanly possible he meant to smuggle\nhim out of the town and take him East. But he had an uneasy conviction\nthat Dick was going to be ill. The mind did strange things with the\nbody.\n\nDick sat down on the edge of the bed.\n\n\"My head aches like the mischief,\" he repeated. \"Look in that grip and\nfind me some tablets, will you? I'm dizzy.\"\n\nHe made an effort and stretched out on the bed. \"Good Lord,\" he\nmuttered, \"I haven't had such a headache since--\"\n\nHis voice trailed off. Bassett, bending over the army kit bag in the\ncorner, straightened and looked around. Dick was suddenly asleep and\nbreathing heavily.\n\nFor a long time the reporter sat by the side of the bed, watching him\nand trying to plan some course of action. He was overcome by his own\nresponsibility, and by the prospect of tragedy that threatened. That\nLivingstone was Clark, and that he would insist on surrendering himself\nwhen he wakened, he could no longer doubt. His mind wandered back to\nthat day when he had visited the old house as a patient, and from that\nalong the strange road they had both come since then. He reflected, not\nexactly in those terms, that life, any man's life, was only one thread\nin a pattern woven of an infinite number of threads, and that to tangle\nthe one thread was to interfere with all the others. David Livingstone,\nthe girl in the blue dress, the man twitching uneasily on the bed,\nWilkins the sheriff, himself, who could tell how many others, all\nthreads.\n\nHe swore in a whisper.\n\nThe maid tapped at the door. He opened it an inch or so and sent her\noff. In view of his new determination even the maid had become a danger.\nShe was the same elderly woman who looked after his own bedroom, and\nshe might have known Clark. Just what Providence had kept him from\nrecognition before this he did not know, but it could not go on\nindefinitely.\n\nAfter an hour or so Bassett locked the door behind him and went down to\nlunch. He was not hungry, but he wanted to get out of the room, to think\nwithout that quiet figure before him. Over the pretence of food he faced\nthe situation. Lying ready to his hand was the biggest story of his\ncareer, but he could not carry it through. It was characteristic of\nhim that, before abandoning it, he should follow through to the end the\nresult of its publication. He did not believe, for instance, that\neither Dick's voluntary surrender or his own disclosure of the situation\nnecessarily meant a conviction for murder. To convict a man of a crime\nhe did not know he had committed would be difficult. But, with his\ncustomary thoroughness he followed that through also. Livingstone\nacquitted was once again Clark, would be known to the world as Clark.\nThe new place he had so painfully made for himself would be gone. The\nstory would follow him, never to be lived down. And in his particular\nprofession confidence and respect were half the game. All that would be\ngone.\n\nThus by gradual stages he got back to David, and he struggled for the\nmotive which lay behind every decisive human act. A man who followed a\ncourse by which he had nothing to gain and everything to lose was either\na fool or was actuated by some profound unselfishness. To save a life?\nBut with all the resources Clark could have commanded, added to his\npersonal popularity, a first degree sentence would have been unlikely.\nNot a life, then, but perhaps something greater than a life. A man's\nsoul.\n\nIt came to him, then, in a great light of comprehension, the thing David\nhad tried to do; to take this waster and fugitive, the slate of his mind\nwiped clean by shock and illness, only his childish memories remaining,\nand on it to lead him to write a new record. To take the body he had\nfound, and the always untouched soul, and from them to make a man.\n\nAnd with that comprehension came the conviction, too, that David had\nsucceeded. He had indeed made a man.\n\nHe ate absently, consulting his railroad schedule and formulating the\narguments he meant to use against Dick's determination to give himself\nup. He foresaw a struggle there, but he himself held one or two strong\ncards--the ruthless undoing of David's work, the involving of David for\nconspiring against the law. And Dick's own obligation to the girl at\nhome.\n\nHe was more at ease in the practical arrangements. An express went\nthrough on the main line at midnight, and there was a local on the\nbranch line at eight. But the local train, the railway station, too,\nwere full of possible dangers. After some thought he decided to get a\ncar, drive down to the main line with Dick, and then send the car back.\n\nHe went out at once and made an arrangement for a car, and on returning\nnotified the clerk that he was going to leave, and asked to have his\nbill made out. After some hesitation he said: \"I'll pay three-twenty\ntoo, while I'm at it. Friend of mine there, going with me. Yes, up to\nto-night.\"\n\nAs he turned away he saw the short, heavy figure of Wilkins coming in.\nHe stood back and watched. The sheriff went to the desk, pulled the\nregister toward him and ran over several pages of it. Then he shoved it\naway, turned and saw him.\n\n\"Been away, haven't you?\" he asked.\n\n\"Yes. I took a little horseback trip into the mountains. My knees are\nstill not on speaking terms.\"\n\nThe sheriff chuckled. Then he sobered.\n\n\"Come and sit down,\" he said. \"I'm going to watch who goes in and out of\nhere for a while.\"\n\nBassett followed him unwillingly to two chairs that faced the desk and\nthe lobby. He had the key of Dick's room in his pocket, but he knew that\nif he wakened he could easily telephone and have his door unlocked.\nBut that was not his only anxiety. He had a sudden conviction that\nthe sheriff's watch was connected with Dick himself. Wilkins, from a\nfriendly and gregarious fellow-being, had suddenly grown to sinister\nproportions in his mind.\n\nAnd, as the minutes went by, with the sheriff sitting forward and\nwatching the lobby and staircase with intent, unblinking eyes, Bassett's\nanxiety turned to fear. He found his heart leaping when the room\nbells rang, and the clerk, with a glance at the annunciator, sent boys\nhurrying off. His hands shook, and he felt them cold and moist. And all\nthe time Wilkins was holding him with a flow of unimportant chatter.\n\n\"Watching for any one in particular?\" he managed, after five minutes or\nso.\n\n\"Yes. I'll tell you about it as soon as--Bill! Is Alex outside?\"\n\nBill stopped in front of them, and nodded.\n\n\"All right. Now get this--I want everything decent and in order. No\nexcitement. I'll come out behind him, and you and Bill stand by. Outside\nI'll speak to him, and when we walk off, just fall in behind. But keep\nclose.\"\n\nBill wandered off, to take up a stand of extreme nonchalance inside the\nentrance. When Wilkins turned to him again Bassett had had a moment to\nadjust himself, and more or less to plan his own campaign.\n\n\"Somebody's out of luck,\" he commented. \"And speaking of being out of\nluck, I've got a sick man on my hands. Friend of mine from home. We've\ngot to catch the midnight, too.\"\n\n\"Too bad,\" Wilkins commented rather absently. Then, perhaps feeling that\nhe had not shown proper interest, \"Tell you what I'll do. I've got some\nbusiness on hand now, but it'll be cleared up one way or another pretty\nsoon. I'll bring my car around and take him to the station. These hacks\nare the limit to ride in.\"\n\nThe disaster to his plans thus threatened steadied the reporter, and he\nmanaged to keep his face impassive.\n\n\"Thanks,\" he said. \"I'll let you know if he's able to travel. Is\nthis--is this business you're on confidential?\"\n\n\"Well, it is and it isn't. I've talked some to you, and as you're\nleaving anyhow--it's the Jud Clark case again.\"\n\n\"Sort of hysteria, I suppose. He'll be seen all over the country for the\nnext six months.\"\n\n\"Yes. But I never saw a hysterical Indian. Well, a little while ago an\nIndian woman named Lizzie Lazarus blew into my office. She's a smart\nwoman. Her husband was a breed, dairy hand on the Clark ranch for years.\nLizzie was the first Indian woman in these parts to go to school, and\nbesides being smart, she's got Indian sight. You know these Indians.\nWhen they aren't blind with trachoma they can see further and better\nthan a telescope.\"\n\nBassett made an effort.\n\n\"What's that got to do with Jud Clark?\" he asked.\n\n\"Well, she blew in. You know there was a reward out for him, and I guess\nit still stands. I'll have to look it up, for if Maggie Donaldson wasn't\ncrazy some one will turn him up some day, probably. Well, Lizzie blew\nin, and she said she'd seen Jud Clark. Saw him standing at a second\nstory window of this hotel. Can you beat that?\"\n\n\"Not for pure invention. Hardly.\"\n\n\"That's what I said at first. But I don't know. In some ways it would\nbe like him. He wouldn't mind coming back and giving us the laugh, if\nhe thought he could get away with it. He didn't know fear. Only time he\never showed funk was when he beat it after the shooting, and then he was\nfull of hootch, and on the edge of D.T.'s.\"\n\n\"A man doesn't play jokes with the hangman's rope,\" Bassett commented,\ndryly. He looked at his watch and rose. \"It's a good story, but I\nwouldn't wear out any trouser-seats sitting here watching for him. If\nhe's living he's taken pretty good care for ten years not to put his\nhead in the noose; and I'd remember this, too. Wherever he is, if he is\nanywhere, he's probably so changed his appearance that Telescope Lizzie\nwouldn't know him. Or you either.\"\n\n\"Probably,\" the sheriff said, comfortably. \"Still I'm not taking any\nchances. I'm up for reelection this fall, and that Donaldson woman's\nstory nearly queered me. I've got a fellow at the railroad station, just\nfor luck.\"\n\nBassett went up the stairs and along the corridor, deep in dejected\nthought. The trap of his own making was closing, and his active mind was\nbusy with schemes for getting Dick away before it shut entirely.\n\nIt might be better, in one way, to keep Livingstone there in his room\nuntil the alarm blew over. On the other hand, Livingstone himself had\nto be dealt with, and that he would remain quiescent under the\ncircumstances was unlikely. The motor to the main line seemed to be the\nbest thing. True, he would have first to get Livingstone to agree to go.\nThat done, and he did not underestimate its difficulty, there was the\nquestion of getting him out of the hotel, now that the alarm had been\ngiven.\n\nWhen he found Dick still sleeping he made a careful survey of the second\nfloor. There was a second staircase, but investigation showed that it\nled into the kitchens. He decided finally on a fire-escape from a rear\nhall window, which led into a courtyard littered with the untidy rubbish\nof an overcrowded and undermanned hotel, and where now two or three\nsaddled horses waited while their riders ate within.\n\nWhen he had made certain that he was not observed he unlocked and opened\nthe window, and removed the wire screen. There was a red fire-exit lamp\nin the ceiling nearby, but he could not reach it, nor could he find any\nwall switch. Nevertheless he knew by that time that through the window\nlay Dick's only chance of escape. He cleared the grating of a broken box\nand an empty flower pot, stood the screen outside the wall, and then,\nstill unobserved, made his way back to his own bedroom and packed his\nbelongings.\n\nDick was still sleeping, stretched on his bed, when he returned to\nthree-twenty. And here Bassett's careful plans began to go awry, for\nDick's body was twitching, and his face was pale and covered with a cold\nsweat. From wondering how they could get away, Bassett began to wonder\nwhether they would get away at all. The sleep was more like a stupor\nthan sleep. He sat down by the bed, closer to sheer fright than he had\never been before, and wretched with the miserable knowledge of his own\nresponsibility.\n\nAs the afternoon wore on, it became increasingly evident that somehow or\nother he must get a doctor. He turned the subject over in his mind, pro\nand con. If he could get a new man, one who did not remember Jud Clark,\nit might do. But he hesitated until, at seven, Dick opened his eyes and\nclearly did not know him. Then he knew that the matter was out of his\nhands, and that from now on whatever it was that controlled the affairs\nof men, David's God or his own vague Providence, was in charge.\n\nHe got his hat and went out, and down the stairs again. Wilkins had\ndisappeared, but Bill still stood by the entrance, watching the crowd\nthat drifted in and out. In his state of tension he felt that the hotel\nclerk's eyes were suspicious as he retained the two rooms for another\nday, and that Bill watched him out with more than casual interest.\nEven the matter of cancelling the order for the car loomed large and\nsuspicion-breeding before him, but he accomplished it, and then set out\nto find medical assistance.\n\nThere, however, chance favored him. The first doctor's sign led him to a\nyoung man, new to the town, and obviously at leisure. Not that he found\nthat out at once. He invented a condition for himself, as he had done\nonce before, got a prescription and paid for it, learned what he wanted,\nand then mentioned Dick. He was careful to emphasize his name and\nprofession, and his standing \"back home.\"\n\n\"I'll admit he's got me worried,\" he finished. \"He saw me registered and\ncame to my room this morning to see me, and got sick there. That is, he\nsaid he had a violent headache and was dizzy. I got him to his room and\non the bed, and he's been sleeping ever since. He looks pretty sick to\nme.\"\n\nHe was conscious of Bill's eyes on him as they went through the lobby\nagain, but he realized now that they were unsuspicious. Bassett himself\nwas in a hot sweat. He stopped outside the room and mopped his face.\n\n\"Look kind of shot up yourself,\" the doctor commented. \"Watch this sun\nout here. Because it's dry here you Eastern people don't notice the heat\nuntil it plays the deuce with you.\"\n\nHe made a careful examination of the sleeping man, while Bassett watched\nhis face.\n\n\"Been a drinking man? Or do you know?\"\n\n\"No. But I think not. I gave him a small drink this morning, when he\nseemed to need it.\"\n\n\"Been like this all day?\"\n\n\"Since noon. Yes.\"\n\nOnce more the medical man stooped. When he straightened it was to\ndeliver Bassett a body blow.\n\n\"I don't like his condition, or that twitching. If these were the good\nold days in Wyoming I'd say he is on the verge of delirium tremens.\nBut that's only snap judgment. He might be on the verge of a good many\nthings. Anyhow, he'd better be moved to the hospital. This is no place\nfor him.\"\n\nAnd against this common-sense suggestion Bassett had nothing to offer.\nIf the doctor had been looking he would have seen him make a gesture of\ndespair.\n\n\"I suppose so,\" he said, dully. \"Is it near? I'll go myself and get a\nroom.\"\n\n\"That's my advice. I'll look in later, and if the stupor continues I'll\nhave in a consultant.\" He picked up his bag and stood looking down at\nthe bed. \"Big fine-looking chap, isn't he?\" he commented. \"Married?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Well, we'll get the ambulance, and later on we'll go over him properly.\nI'd call a maid to sit with him, if I were you.\" In the grip of a\nsituation that was too much for him, Bassett rang the bell. It was\nanswered by the elderly maid who took care of his own bedroom.\n\nMonths later, puzzling over the situation, Bassett was to wonder, and\nnot to know, whether chance or design brought the Thorwald woman to\nthe door that night. At the time, and for weeks, he laid it to tragic\nchance, the same chance which had placed in Dick's hand the warning\nletter that had brought him West. But as months went on, the part played\nin the tragedy by that faded woman with her tired dispirited voice and\nher ash colored hair streaked with gray, assumed other proportions,\nloomed large and mysterious.\n\nThere were times when he wished that some prescience of danger had\nmade him throttle her then and there, so she could not have raised her\nshrill, alarming voice! But he had no warning. All he saw was a woman\nin a washed-out blue calico dress and a fresh white apron, raising\nincurious eyes to his.\n\n\"I suppose it's all right if she sits in the hall?\" Bassett inquired,\nstill fighting his losing fight. \"She can go in if he stirs.\"\n\n\"Right-o,\" said the doctor, who had been to France and had brought home\nsome British phrases.\n\nBassett walked back from the hospital alone. The game was up and he knew\nit. Sooner or later--In a way he tried to defend himself to himself.\nHe had done his best. Two or three days ago he would have been exultant\nover the developments. After all, mince things as one would, Clark was a\nmurderer. Other men killed and paid the penalty. And the game was not up\nentirely, at that. The providence which had watched over him for so long\nmight continue to. The hospital was new. (It was, ironically enough, the\nClark Memorial hospital.) There was still a chance.\n\nHe was conscious of something strange as he entered the lobby. The\nconstable was gone, and there was no clerk behind the desk. At the foot\nof the stairs stood a group of guests and loungers, looking up, while a\nbell-boy barred the way.\n\nEven then Bassett's first thought was of fire. He elbowed his way to\nthe foot of the stairs, and demanded to be allowed to go up, but he was\nrefused.\n\n\"In a few minutes,\" said the boy. \"No need of excitement.\"\n\n\"Is it a fire?\"\n\n\"I don't know myself. I've got my orders. That's all.\" Wilkins came\nhurrying in. The crowd, silent and respectful before the law, opened to\nlet him through and closed behind him.\n\nBassett stood at the foot of the stairs, looking up.\n\n\n\n\nXXVI\n\nTo Elizabeth the first days of Dick's absence were unbelievably dreary.\nShe seemed to live only from one visit of the postman to the next. She\nfelt sometimes that only part of her was at home in the Wheeler house,\nslept at night in her white bed, donned its black frocks and took them\noff, and made those sad daily pilgrimages to the cemetery above the\ntown, where her mother tidied with tender hands the long narrow mound,\nso fearfully remindful of Jim's tall slim body.\n\nThat part of her grieved sorely, and spent itself in small comforting\nactions and little caressing touches on bowed heads and grief-stooped\nshoulders. It put away Jim's clothing, and kept immaculate the room\nwhere now her mother spent most of her waking hours. It sent her on\nher knees at night to pray for Jim's happiness in some young-man heaven\nwhich would please him. But the other part of her was not there at all.\nIt was off with Dick in some mysterious place of mountains and vast\ndistance called Wyoming.\n\nAnd because of this division in herself, because she felt that her\nloyalty to her people had wavered, because she knew that already she had\nforsaken her father and her mother and would follow her love through the\nrest of her life, she was touchingly anxious to comfort and to please\nthem.\n\n\"She's taking Dick's absence very hard,\" Mrs. Wheeler said one night,\nwhen she had kissed them and gone upstairs to bed. \"She worries me\nsometimes.\"\n\nMr. Wheeler sighed. Why was it that a man could not tell his children\nwhat he had learned,--that nothing was so great as one expected; that\nlove was worth living for, but not dying for. The impatience of youth\nfor life! It had killed Jim. It was hurting Nina. It would all come,\nall come, in God's good time. The young did not live to-day, but always\nto-morrow. There seemed no time to live to-day, for any one. First one\nlooked ahead and said, \"I will be so happy.\" And before one knew it one\nwas looking back and saying: \"I was so happy.\"\n\n\"She'll be all right,\" he said aloud.\n\nHe got up and whistled for the dog.\n\n\"I'll take him around the block before I lock up,\" he said heavily. He\nbent over and kissed his wife. She was a sad figure to him in her black\ndress. He did not say to her what he thought sometimes; that Jim had\nbeen saved a great deal. That to live on, and to lose the things one\nloved, one by one, was harder than to go quickly, from a joyous youth.\n\nHe had not told her what he knew about Jim's companion that night. She\nwould never have understood. In her simple and child-like faith she\nknew that her boy sat that day among the blessed company of heaven. He\nhimself believed that Jim had gone forgiven into whatever lay behind the\nveil we call death, had gone shriven and clean before the Judge who knew\nthe urge of youth and life. He did not fear for Jim. He only missed him.\n\nHe walked around the block that night, a stooped commonplace figure, the\ndog at his heels. Now and then he spoke to him, for companionship.\nAt the corner he stopped and looked along the side street toward the\nLivingstone house. And as he looked he sighed. Jim and Nina, and now\nElizabeth. Jim and Nina were beyond his care now. He could do no more.\nBut what could he do for Elizabeth? That, too, wasn't that beyond him?\nHe stood still, facing the tragedy of his helplessness, beset by vague\napprehensions. Then he went on doggedly, his hands clasped behind him,\nhis head sunk on his breast.\n\nHe lay awake for a long time that night, wondering whether he and Dick\nhad been quite fair to Elizabeth. She should, he thought, have been\ntold. Then, if Dick's apprehensions were justified, she would have had\nsome preparation. As it was--Suppose something turned up out there,\nsomething that would break her heart?\n\nHe had thought Margaret was sleeping, but after a time she moved and\nslipped her hand into his. It comforted him. That, too, was life. Very\nsoon now they would be alone together again, as in the early days before\nthe children came. All the years and the struggle, and then back where\nthey started. But still, thank God, hand in hand.\n\nEver since the night of Jim's death Mrs. Sayre had been a constant\nvisitor to the house. She came in, solid, practical, and with an\neveryday manner neither forcedly cheerful nor too decorously mournful,\nwhich made her very welcome. After the three first days, when she\nhad practically lived at the house, there was no necessity for small\npretensions with her. She knew the china closet and the pantry, and the\nkitchen. She had even penetrated to Mr. Wheeler's shabby old den on\nthe second floor, and had slept a part of the first night there on the\nleather couch with broken springs which he kept because it fitted his\nbody.\n\nShe was a kindly woman, and she had ached with pity. And, because of her\nusual detachment from the town and its affairs, the feeling that she\nwas being of service gave her a little glow of content. She liked the\nfamily, too, and particularly she liked Elizabeth. But after she had\nseen Dick and Elizabeth together once or twice she felt that no plan she\nmight make for Wallace could possibly succeed. Lying on the old leather\ncouch that first night, between her frequent excursions among the waking\nfamily, she had thought that out and abandoned it.\n\nBut, during the days that followed the funeral, she was increasingly\nanxious about Wallace. She knew that rumors of the engagement had\nreached him, for he was restless and irritable. He did not care to go\nout, but wandered about the house or until late at night sat smoking\nalone on the terrace, looking down at the town with sunken, unhappy\neyes. Once or twice in the evening he had taken his car and started out,\nand lying awake in her French bed she would hear him coming hours later.\nIn the mornings his eyes were suffused and his color bad, and she knew\nthat he was drinking in order to get to sleep.\n\nOn the third day after Dick's departure for the West she got up when\nshe heard him coming in, and putting on her dressing gown and slippers,\nknocked at his door.\n\n\"Come in,\" he called ungraciously.\n\nShe found him with his coat off, standing half defiantly with a glass of\nwhisky and soda in his hand. She went up to him and took it from him.\n\n\"We've had enough of that in the family, Wallie,\" she said. \"And it's a\npretty poor resource in time of trouble.\"\n\n\"I'll have that back, if you don't mind.\"\n\n\"Nonsense,\" she said briskly, and flung it, glass and all, out of the\nwindow. She was rather impressive when she turned.\n\n\"I've been a fairly indulgent mother,\" she said. \"I've let you alone,\nbecause it's a Sayre trait to run away when they feel a pull on the bit.\nBut there's a limit to my patience, and it is reached when my son drinks\nto forget a girl.\"\n\nHe flushed and glowered at her in somber silence, but she moved about\nthe room calmly, giving it a housekeeper's critical inspection, and\napparently unconscious of his anger.\n\n\"I don't believe you ever cared for any one in all your life,\" he said\nroughly. \"If you had, you would know.\"\n\nShe was straightening a picture over the mantel, and she completed her\nwork before she turned.\n\n\"I care for you.\"\n\n\"That's different.\"\n\n\"Very well, then. I cared for your father. I cared terribly. And he\nkilled my love.\"\n\nShe padded out of the room, her heavy square body in its blazing kimono\na trifle rigid, but her face still and calm. He remained staring at\nthe door when she had closed it, and for some time after. He knew what\nmessage for him had lain behind that emotionless speech of hers, not\nonly understanding, but a warning. She had cared terribly, and his\nfather had killed that love. He had drunk and played through his gay\nyoung life, and then he had died, and no one had greatly mourned him.\n\nShe had left the decanter on its stand, and he made a movement toward\nit. Then, with a half smile, he picked it up and walked to the window\nwith it. He was still smiling, half boyishly, as he put out his light\nand got into bed. It had occurred to him that the milkman's flivver,\ndriving in at the break of dawn, would encounter considerable glass.\n\nBy morning, after a bad night, he had made a sort of double-headed\nresolution, that he was through with booze, as he termed it, and that\nhe would find out how he stood with Elizabeth. But for a day or two no\nopportunity presented itself. When he called there was always present\nsome grave-faced sympathizing visitor, dark clad and low of voice, and\nover the drawing-room would hang the indescribable hush of a house\nin mourning. It seemed to touch Elizabeth, too, making her remote and\nbeyond earthly things. He would go in, burning with impatience, hungry\nfor the mere sight of her, fairly overcharged with emotion, only to face\nthat strange new spirituality that made him ashamed of the fleshly urge\nin him.\n\nOnce he found Clare Rossiter there, and was aware of something electric\nin the air. After a time he identified it. Behind the Rossiter girl's\nsoft voice and sympathetic words, there was a veiled hostility. She\nwas watching Elizabeth, was overconscious of her. And she was, for some\nreason, playing up to himself. He thought he saw a faint look of relief\non Elizabeth's face when Clare at last rose to go.\n\n\"I'm on my way to see the man Dick Livingstone left in his place,\"\nClare said, adjusting her veil at the mirror. \"I've got a cold. Isn't it\nqueer, the way the whole Livingstone connection is broken up?\"\n\n\"Hardly queer. And it's only temporary.\"\n\n\"Possibly. But if you ask me, I don't believe Dick will come back. Mind,\nI don't defend the town, but it doesn't like to be fooled. And he's\nfooled it for years. I know a lot of people who'd quit going to him.\"\nShe turned to Wallie.\n\n\"He isn't David's nephew, you know. The question is, who is he? Of\ncourse I don't say it, but a good many are saying that when a man takes\na false identity he has something to hide.\"\n\nShe gave them no chance to reply, but sauntered out with her\nsex-conscious, half-sensuous walk. Outside the door her smile faded,\nand her face was hard and bitter. She might forget Dick Livingstone,\nbut never would she forgive herself for her confession to Elizabeth, nor\nElizabeth for having heard it.\n\nWallie turned to Elizabeth when she had gone, slightly bewildered.\n\n\"What's got into her?\" he inquired. And then, seeing Elizabeth's white\nface, rather shrewdly: \"That was one for him and two for you, was it?\"\n\n\"I don't know. Probably.\"\n\n\"I wonder if you would look like that if any one attacked me!\"\n\n\"No one attacks you, Wallie.\"\n\n\"That's not an answer. You wouldn't, would you? It's different, isn't\nit?\"\n\n\"Yes. A little.\"\n\nHe straightened, and looked past her, unseeing, at the wall. \"I guess\nI've known it for quite a while,\" he said at last. \"I didn't want to\nbelieve it, so I wouldn't. Are you engaged to him?\"\n\n\"Yes. It's not to be known just yet, Wallie.\"\n\n\"He's a good fellow,\" he said, after rather a long silence. \"Not that\nthat makes it easier,\" he added with a twisted smile. Then, boyishly and\nunexpectedly he said, \"Oh, my God!\"\n\nHe sat down, and when the dog came and placed a head on his knee he\npatted it absently. He wanted to go, but he had a queer feeling that\nwhen he went he went for good.\n\n\"I've cared for you for years,\" he said. \"I've been a poor lot, but I'd\nhave been a good bit worse, except for you.\"\n\nAnd again:\n\n\"Only last night I made up my mind that if you'd have me, I'd make\nsomething out of myself. I suppose a man's pretty weak when he puts a\nresponsibility like that on a girl.\"\n\nShe yearned over him, rather. She made little tentative overtures of\nfriendship and affection. But he scarcely seemed to hear them, wrapped\nas he was in the selfish absorption of his disappointment. When she\nheard the postman outside and went to the door for the mail, she thought\nhe had not noticed her going. But when she returned he was watching her\nwith jealous, almost tragic eyes.\n\n\"I suppose you hear from him by every mail.\"\n\n\"There has been nothing to-day.\"\n\nSomething in her voice or her face made him look at her closely.\n\n\"Has he written at all?\"\n\n\"The first day he got there. Not since.\"\n\nHe went away soon, and not after all with the feeling of going for\ngood. In his sceptical young mind, fed by Clare's malice, was growing a\ncomforting doubt of Dick's good faith.\n\n\n\n\nXXVII\n\nWhen Wilkins had disappeared around the angle of the staircase\nBassett went to a chair and sat down. He felt sick, and his knees were\ntrembling. Something had happened, a search for Clark room by room\nperhaps, and the discovery had been made.\n\nHe was totally unable to think or to plan. With Dick well they could\nperhaps have made a run for it. The fire-escape stood ready. But as\nthings were--The murmuring among the crowd at the foot of the stairs\nceased, and he looked up. Wilkins was on the staircase, searching\nthe lobby with his eyes. When he saw Bassett he came quickly down and\nconfronted him, his face angry and suspicious.\n\n\"You're mixed up in this somehow,\" he said sharply. \"You might as well\ncome over with the story. We'll get him. He can't get out of this town.\"\n\nWith the words, and the knowledge that in some incredible fashion Dick\nhad made his escape, Bassett's mind reacted instantly.\n\n\"What's eating you, Wilkins?\" he demanded. \"Who got away? I couldn't get\nthat tongue-tied bell-hop to tell me. Thought it was a fire.\"\n\n\"Don't stall, Bassett. You've had Jud Clark hidden upstairs in\nthree-twenty all day.\"\n\nBassett got up and towered angrily over the sheriff. The crowd had\nturned and was watching.\n\n\"In three-twenty?\" he said. \"You're crazy. Jud Clark! Let me tell you\nsomething. I don't know what you've got in your head, but three-twenty\nis a Doctor Livingstone from near my home town. Well known and highly\nrespected, too. What's more, he's a sick man, and if he's got away, as\nyou say, it's because he is delirious. I had a doctor in to see him an\nhour ago. I've just arranged for a room at the hospital for him. Does\nthat look as though I've been hiding him?\"\n\nThe positiveness of his identification and his indignation resulted in a\nchange in Wilkins' manner.\n\n\"I'll ask you to stay here until I come back.\" His tone was official,\nbut less suspicious. \"We'll have him in a half hour. It's Clark all\nright. I'm not saying you knew it was Clark, but I want to ask you some\nquestions.\"\n\nHe went out, and Bassett heard him shouting an order in the street. He\nwent to the street door, and realized that a search was going on, both\nby the police and by unofficial volunteers. Men on horseback clattered\nby to guard the borders of the town, and in the vicinity of the hotel\nsearchers were investigating yards and alleyways.\n\nBassett himself was helpless. He stood by, watching the fire of his own\nigniting, conscious of the curious scrutiny of the few hotel loungers\nwho remained, and expecting momentarily to hear of Dick's capture. It\nmust come eventually, he felt sure. As to how Dick had been identified,\nor by what means he had escaped, he was in complete ignorance; and an\nendeavor to learn by establishing the former entente cordiale between\nthe room clerk and himself was met by a suspicious glance and what\namounted to a snub. He went back to his chair against the wall and sat\nthere, waiting for the end.\n\nIt was an hour before the sheriff returned, and he came in scowling.\n\n\"I'll see you now,\" he said briefly, and led the way back to the hotel\noffice behind the desk. Bassett's last hope died when he saw sitting\nthere, pale but composed, the elderly maid. The sheriff lost no time.\n\n\"Now I'll tell you what we know about your connection with this case,\nBassett,\" he said. \"You engaged a car to take you both to the main line\nto-night. You paid off Clark's room as well as your own this afternoon.\nWhen you found he was sick you canceled your going. That's true, isn't\nit?\"\n\n\"It is. I've told you I knew him at home, but not as Clark.\"\n\n\"I'll let that go. You intended to take the midnight on the main line,\nbut you ordered a car instead of using the branch road.\"\n\n\"Livingstone was sick. I thought it would be easier. That's all.\" His\nvoice sharpened. \"You can't drag me into this, Sheriff. In the first\nplace I don't believe it was Clark, or he wouldn't have come here, of\nall places on the earth. I didn't even know he was here, until he came\ninto my room this morning.\"\n\n\"Why did he come into your room?\"\n\n\"He had seen that I was registered. He said he felt sick. I took him\nback and put him to bed. To-night I got a doctor.\"\n\nThe sheriff felt in his pocket and produced a piece of paper. Bassett's\nmorale was almost destroyed when he saw that it was Gregory's letter to\nDavid.\n\n\"I'll ask you to explain this. It was on Clark's bed.\"\n\nBassett took it and read it slowly. He was thinking hard.\n\n\"I see,\" he said. \"Well, that explains why he came here. He was too sick\nto talk when I saw him. You see, this is not addressed to him, but to\nhis uncle, David Livingstone. David Livingstone is a brother of Henry\nLivingstone, who died some years ago at Dry River. This refers to a\npersonal matter connected with the Livingstone estate.\"\n\nThe sheriff took the letter and reread it. He was puzzled.\n\n\"You're a good talker,\" he acknowledged grudgingly. He turned to the\nmaid.\n\n\"All right, Hattie,\" he said. \"We'll have that story again. But just\na minute.\" He turned to the reporter. \"Mrs. Thorwald here hasn't seen\nLizzie Lazarus, the squaw. Lizzie has been sitting in my office ever\nsince noon. Now, Hattie.\"\n\nHattie moistened her dry lips.\n\n\"It was Jud Clark, all right,\" she said. \"I knew him all his life, off\nand on. But I wish I hadn't screamed. I don't believe he killed Lucas,\nand I never will. I hope he gets away.\"\n\nShe eyed the sheriff vindictively, but he only smiled grimly.\n\n\"What did I tell you?\" he said to Bassett. \"Hell with the women--that\nwas Jud Clark. And we'll get him, Hattie. Don't worry. Go on.\"\n\nShe looked at Bassett.\n\n\"When you left me, I sat outside the door, as you said. Then I heard him\nmoving, and I went in. The room was not very light, and I didn't know\nhim at first. He sat up in bed and looked at me, and he said, 'Why,\nhello, Hattie Thorwald.' That's my name. I married a Swede. Then\nhe looked again, and he said, 'Excuse me, I thought you were a Mrs.\nThorwald, but I see now you're older.' I recognized him then, and I\nthought I was going to faint. I knew he'd be arrested the moment it was\nknown he was here. I said, 'Lie down, Mr. Jud. You're not very well.'\nAnd I closed the door and locked it. I was scared.\"\n\nHer voice broke; she fumbled for a handkerchief. The sheriff glanced at\nBassett.\n\n\"Now where's your Livingstone story?\" he demanded. \"All right, Hattie.\nLet's have it.\"\n\n\"I said, 'For God's sake, Mr. Jud, lie still, until I think what to\ndo. The sheriff's likely downstairs this very minute.' And then he went\nqueer and wild. He jumped off the bed and stood listening and staring,\nand shaking all over. 'I've got to get away,' he said, very loud. 'I\nwon't let them take me. I'll kill myself first!' When I put my hand on\nhis arm he threw it off, and he made for the door. I saw then that he\nwas delirious with fever, and I stood in front of the door and begged\nhim not to go out. But he threw me away so hard that that I fell, and I\nscreamed.\"\n\n\"And then what?\"\n\n\"That's all. If I hadn't been almost out of my mind I'd never have told\nthat it was Jud Clark. That'll hang on me dying day.\"\n\nAn hour or so later Bassett went back to his room in a state of mental\nand nervous exhaustion. He knew that from that time on he would be under\nsuspicion and probably under espionage, and he proceeded methodically,\nhis door locked, to go over his papers. His notebook and the cuttings\nfrom old files relative to the Clark case he burned in his wash basin\nand then carefully washed the basin. That done, his attendance on a sick\nman, and the letter found on the bed was all the positive evidence they\nhad to connect him with the case. He had had some thought of slipping\nout by the fire-escape and making a search for Dick on his own account,\nbut his lack of familiarity with his surroundings made that practically\nuseless.\n\nAt midnight he stretched out on his bed without undressing, and went\nover the situation carefully. He knew nothing of the various neuroses\nwhich affect the human mind, but he had a vague impression that\nmemory when lost did eventually return, and Dick's recognition of the\nchambermaid pointed to such a return. He wondered what a man would\nfeel under such conditions, what he would think. He could not do it. He\nabandoned the effort finally, and lay frowning at the ceiling while he\nconsidered his own part in the catastrophe. He saw himself, following\nhis training and his instinct, leading the inevitable march toward this\nnight's tragedy, planning, scheming, searching, and now that it had\ncome, lying helpless on his bed while the procession of events went on\npast him and beyond his control.\n\nWhen an automobile engine back-fired in the street below he went sick\nwith fear.\n\nHe made the resolution then that was to be the guiding motive for his\nlife for the next few months, to fight the thing of his own creating to\na finish. But with the resolution newly made he saw the futility of\nit. He might fight, would fight, but nothing could restore to Dick\nLivingstone the place he had made for himself in the world. He might be\nsaved from his past, but he could not be given a future.\n\nAll at once he was aware that some one was working stealthily at\nthe lock of the door which communicated with a room beyond. He slid\ncautiously off the bed and went to the light switch, standing with a\nhand on it, and waited. The wild thought that it might be Livingstone\nwas uppermost in his mind, and when the door creaked open and closed\nagain, that was the word he breathed into the darkness.\n\n\"No,\" said a woman's voice in a whisper. \"It's the maid, Hattie. Be\ncareful. There's a guard at the top of the stairs.\"\n\nHe heard her moving to his outer door, and he knew that she stood\nthere, listening, her head against the panel. When she was satisfied she\nslipped, with the swiftness of familiarity with her surroundings, to the\nstand beside his bed, and turned on the lamp. In the shaded light he saw\nthat she wore a dark cape, with its hood drawn over her head. In some\nstrange fashion the maid, even the woman, was lost, and she stood,\nstrange, mysterious, and dramatic in the little room.\n\n\"If you found Jud Clark, what would you do with him?\" she demanded. From\nbeneath the hood her eyes searched his face. \"Turn him over to Wilkins\nand his outfit?\"\n\n\"I think you know better than that.\"\n\n\"Have you got any plan?\"\n\n\"Plan? No. They've got every outlet closed, haven't they? Do you know\nwhere he is?\"\n\n\"I know where he isn't, or they'd have him by now. And I know Jud Clark.\nHe'd take to the mountains, same as he did before. He's got a good\nhorse.\"\n\n\"A horse!\"\n\n\"Listen. I haven't told this, and I don't mean to. They'll learn it in\na couple of hours, anyhow. He got out by a back fire-escape--they know\nthat. But they don't know he took Ed Rickett's black mare. They think\nhe's on foot. I've been down there now, and she's gone. Ed's shut up in\na room on the top floor, playing poker. They won't break up until about\nthree o'clock and he'll miss his horse then. That's two hours yet.\"\n\nBassett tried to see her face in the shadow of the hood. He was puzzled\nand suspicious at her change of front, more than half afraid of a trap.\n\n\"How do I know you are not working with Wilkins?\" he demanded. \"You\ncould have saved the situation to-night by saying you weren't sure.\"\n\n\"I was upset. I've had time to think since.\"\n\nHe was forced to trust her, eventually, although the sense of some\nhidden motive, some urge greater than compassion, persisted in him.\n\n\"You've got some sort of plan for me, then? I can't follow him haphazard\ninto the mountains at night, and expect to find him.\"\n\n\"Yes. He was delirious when he left. That thing about the sheriff being\nafter him--he wasn't after him then. Not until I gave the alarm. He's\ndelirious, and he thinks he's back to the night he--you know. Wouldn't\nhe do the same thing again, and make for the mountains and the cabin? He\nwent to the cabin before.\"\n\nBassett looked at his watch. It was half past twelve.\n\n\"Even if I could get a horse I couldn't get out of the town.\"\n\n\"You might, on foot. They'll be trailing Rickett's horse by dawn. And if\nyou can get out of town I can get you a horse. I can get you out, too, I\nthink. I know every foot of the place.\"\n\nA feeling of theatrical unreality was Bassett's chief emotion during the\ntrying time that followed. The cloaked and shrouded figure of the woman\nahead, the passage through two dark and empty rooms by pass key to an\nunguarded corridor in the rear, the descent of the fire-escape, where\nthey stood flattened against the wall while a man, possibly one of the\nposse, rode in, tied his horse and stamped in high heeled boots into the\nbuilding, and always just ahead the sure movement and silent tread of\nthe woman, kept his nerves taut and increased his feeling of the unreal.\n\nAt the foot of the fire-escape the woman slid out of sight noiselessly,\nbut under Bassett's feet a tin can rolled and clattered. Then a horse\nsnorted close to his shoulder, and he was frozen with fright. After\nthat she gave him her hand, and led him through an empty outbuilding and\nanother yard into a street.\n\nAt two o'clock that morning Bassett, waiting in a lonely road near what\nhe judged to be the camp of a drilling crew, heard a horse coming toward\nhim and snorting nervously as it came and drew back into the shadows\nuntil he recognized the shrouded silhouette leading him.\n\n\"It belongs to my son,\" she said. \"I'll fix it with him to-morrow. But\nif you're caught you'll have to say you came out and took him, or you'll\nget us all in trouble.\"\n\nShe gave him careful instructions as to how to find the trail, and urged\nhim to haste.\n\n\"If you get him,\" she advised, \"better keep right on over the range.\"\n\nHe paused, with his foot in the stirrup.\n\n\"You seem pretty certain he's taken to the mountains.\"\n\n\"It's your only chance. They'll get him anywhere else.\"\n\nHe mounted and prepared to ride off. He would have shaken hands with\nher, but the horse was still terrified at her shrouded figure and\nveered and snorted when she approached. \"However it turns out,\" he said,\n\"you've done your best, and I'm grateful.\"\n\nThe horse moved off and left her standing there, her cowl drawn forward\nand her hands crossed on her breast. She stood for a moment, facing\ntoward the mountains, oddly monkish in outline and posture. Then she\nturned back toward the town.\n\n\n\n\nXXVIII\n\nDick had picked up life again where he had left it off so long before.\nGone was David's house built on the sands of forgetfulness. Gone was\nDavid himself, and Lucy. Gone not even born into his consciousness\nwas Elizabeth. The war, his work, his new place in the world, were all\nobliterated, drowned in the flood of memories revived by the shock of\nBassett's revelations.\n\nNot that the breaking point had revealed itself as such at once. There\nwas confusion first, then stupor and unconsciousness, and out of that,\nsharply and clearly, came memory. It was not ten years ago, but an hour\nago, a minute ago, that he had stood staring at Howard Lucas on the\nfloor of the billiard room, and had seen Beverly run in through the\ndoor.\n\n\"Bev!\" he was saying. \"Bev! Don't look like that!\"\n\nHe moved and found he was in bed. It had been a dream. He drew a long\nbreath, looked about the room, saw the woman and greeted her. But\nalready he knew he had not been dreaming. Things were sharpening in his\nmind. He shuddered and looked at the floor, but nobody lay there. Only\nthe horror in his mind, and the instinct to get away from it. He was not\nthinking at all, but rising in him was not only the need for flight, but\nthe sense of pursuit. They were after him. They would get him. They must\nnever get him alive.\n\nInstinct and will took the place of thought, and whatever closed chamber\nin his brain had opened, it clearly influenced his physical condition.\nHe bore all the stigmata of prolonged and heavy drinking; his nerves\nwere gone; he twitched and shook. When he got down the fire-escape his\nlegs would scarcely hold him.\n\nThe discovery of Ed Rickett's horse in the courtyard, saddled and ready,\nfitted in with the brain pattern of the past.\n\nLike one who enters a room for the first time, to find it already\nfamiliar, for a moment he felt that this thing that he was doing he\nhad done before. Only for a moment. Then partial memory ceased, and he\nclimbed into the saddle, rode out and turned toward the mountains and\nthe cabin. By that strange quality of the brain which is called habit,\nalthough the habit be of only one emphatic precedent, he followed the\nroute he had taken ten years before. How closely will never be known.\nDid he stop at this turn to look back, as he had once before? Did he let\nhis horse breathe there? Not the latter, probably, for as, following the\nblind course that he had followed ten years before, he left the town and\nwent up the canyon trail, he was riding as though all the devils of hell\nwere behind him.\n\nOne thing is certain. The reproduction of the conditions of the earlier\nflight, the familiar associations of the trail, must have helped rather\nthan hindered his fixation in the past. Again he was Judson Clark, who\nhad killed a man, and was flying from himself and from pursuit.\n\nBefore long his horse was in acute distress, but he did not notice it.\nAt the top of the long climb the animal stopped, but he kicked him on\nrecklessly. He was as unaware of his own fatigue, or that he was swaying\nin the saddle, until galloping across a meadow the horse stumbled and\nthrew him.\n\nHe lay still for some time; not hurt but apparently lacking the\ninitiative to get up again. He had at that period the alternating\nlucidity and mental torpor of the half drunken man. But struggling up\nthrough layers of blackness at last there came again the instinct for\nflight, and he got on the horse and set off.\n\nThe torpor again overcame him and he slept in the saddle. When the\nhorse stopped he roused and kicked it on. Once he came up through the\nblackness to the accompaniment of a great roaring, and found that the\nanimal was saddle deep in a ford, and floundering badly among the rocks.\nHe turned its head upstream, and got it out safely.\n\nToward dawn some of the confusion was gone, but he firmly fixed in the\npast. The horse wandered on, head down, occasionally stopping to seize a\nleaf as it passed, and once to drink deeply at a spring. Dick was still\nnot thinking--there was something that forbade him to think-but he was\nweak and emotional. He muttered:\n\n\"Poor Bev! Poor old Bev!\"\n\nA great wave of tenderness and memory swept over him. Poor Bev! He\nhad made life hell for her, all right. He had an almost uncontrollable\nimpulse to turn the horse around, go back and see her once more. He was\ngone anyhow. They would get him. And he wanted her to know that he would\nhave died rather than do what he had done.\n\nThe flight impulse died; he felt sick and very cold, and now and then he\nshook violently. He began to watch the trail behind him for the pursuit,\nbut without fear. He seemed to have been wandering for a thousand black\nnights through deep gorges and over peaks as high as the stars, and now\nhe wanted to rest, to stop somewhere and sleep, to be warm again. Let\nthem come and take him, anywhere out of this nightmare.\n\nWith the dawn still gray he heard a horse behind and below him on the\ntrail up the cliff face. He stopped and sat waiting, twisted about\nin his saddle, his expression ugly and defiant, and yet touchingly\nhelpless, the look of a boy in trouble and at bay. The horseman came\ninto sight on the trail below, riding hard, a middle-aged man in a dark\nsack suit and a straw hat, an oddly incongruous figure and manifestly\nweary. He rode bent forward, and now and again he raised his eyes from\nthe trail and searched the wall above with bloodshot, anxious eyes.\n\nOn the turn below Dick, Bassett saw him for the first time, and spoke to\nhim in a quiet voice.\n\n\"Hello, old man,\" he said. \"I began to think I was going to miss you\nafter all.\"\n\nHis scrutiny of Dick's face had rather reassured him. The delirium had\npassed, apparently. Dishevelled although he was, covered with dust and\nwith sweat from the horse, Livingstone's eyes were steady enough. As\nhe rode up to him, however, he was not so certain. He found himself\nsurveyed with a sort of cool malignity that startled him.\n\n\"Miss me!\" Livingstone sneered bitterly. \"With every damned hill covered\nby this time with your outfit! I'll tell you this. If I'd had a gun\nyou'd never have got me alive.\"\n\nBassett was puzzled and slightly ruffled.\n\n\"My outfit! I'll tell you this, son, I've risked my neck half the night\nto get you out of this mess.\"\n\n\"God Almighty couldn't get me out of this mess,\" Dick said somberly.\n\nIt was then that Bassett saw something not quite normal in his face, and\nhe rode closer.\n\n\"See here, Livingstone,\" he said, in a soothing tone, \"nobody's going to\nget you. I'm here to keep them from getting you. We've got a good start,\nbut we'll have to keep moving.\"\n\nDick sat obstinately still, his horse turned across the trail, and his\neyes still suspicious and unfriendly.\n\n\"I don't know you,\" he said doggedly. \"And I've done all the running\naway I'm going to do. You go back and tell Wilkins I'm here and to come\nand get me. The sooner the better.\" The sneer faded, and he turned\non Bassett with a depth of tragedy in his eyes that frightened the\nreporter. \"My God,\" he said, \"I killed a man last night! I can't go\nthrough life with that on me. I'm done, I tell you.\"\n\n\"Last night!\" Some faint comprehension began to dawn in Bassett's mind,\na suspicion of the truth. But there was no time to verify it. He turned\nand carefully inspected the trail to where it came into sight at the\nopposite rim of the valley. When he was satisfied that the pursuit was\nstill well behind them he spoke again.\n\n\"Pull yourself together, Livingstone,\" he said, rather sharply. \"Think\na bit. You didn't kill anybody last night. Now listen,\" he added\nimpressively. \"You are Livingstone, Doctor Richard Livingstone. You\nstick to that, and think about it.\"\n\nBut Dick was not listening, save to some bitter inner voice, for\nsuddenly he turned his horse around on the trail. \"Get out of the way,\"\nhe said, \"I'm going back to give myself up.\"\n\nHe would have done it, probably, would have crowded past Bassett on\nthe narrow trail and headed back toward capture, but for his horse. It\nbalked and whirled on the ledge, but it would not pass Bassett. Dick\nswore and kicked it, his face ugly and determined, but it refused\nsullenly. He slid out of the saddle then and tried to drag it on, but he\nwas suddenly weak and sick. He staggered. Bassett was off his horse in\na moment and caught him. He eased him onto a boulder, and he sat there,\nhis shoulders sagging and his whole body twitching.\n\n\"Been drinking my head off,\" he said at last. \"If I had a drink now I'd\nstraighten out.\" He tried to sit up. \"That's what's the matter with me.\nI'm funking, of course, but that's not all. I'd give my soul for some\nwhisky.\"'\n\n\"I can get you a drink, if you'll come on about a mile,\" Bassett coaxed.\n\"At the cabin you and I talked about yesterday.\"\n\n\"Now you're talking.\" Dick made an effort and got to his feet, shaking\noff Bassett's assisting arm. \"For God's sake keep your hands off me,\" he\nsaid irritably. \"I've got a hangover, that's all.\"\n\nHe got into his saddle without assistance and started off up the trail.\nBassett once more searched the valley, but it was empty save for a deer\ndrinking at the stream far below. He turned and followed.\n\nHe was fairly hopeless by that time, what with Dick's unexpected\nresistance and the change in the man himself. He was dealing with\nsomething he did not understand, and the hypothesis of delirium did\nnot hold. There was a sort of desperate sanity in Dick's eyes. That\nstatement, now, about drinking his head off--he hadn't looked yesterday\nlike a drinking man. But now he did. He was twitching, his hands shook.\nOn the rock his face had been covered with a cold sweat. What was\nthat the doctor yesterday had said about delirium tremens? Suppose he\ncollapsed? That meant capture.\n\nHe did not need to guide Dick to the cabin. He turned off the trail\nhimself, and Bassett, following, saw him dismount and survey the ruin\nwith a puzzled face. But he said nothing. Bassett waiting outside to tie\nthe horses came in to find him sitting on one of the dilapidated chairs,\nstaring around, but all he said was:\n\n\"Get me that drink, won't you? I'm going to pieces.\" Bassett found his\ntin cup where he had left it on a shelf and poured out a small amount of\nwhisky from his flask.\n\n\"This is all we have,\" he explained. \"We'll have to go slow with it.\"\n\nIt had an almost immediate effect. The twitching grew less, and a faint\ncolor came into Dick's face. He stood up and stretched himself. \"That's\nbetter,\" he said. \"I was all in. I must have been riding that infernal\nhorse for years.\"\n\nHe wandered about while the reporter made a fire and set the coffee pot\nto boil. Bassett, glancing up once, saw him surveying the ruined lean-to\nfrom the doorway, with an expression he could not understand. But he did\nnot say anything, nor did he speak again until Bassett called him to get\nsome food. Even then he was laconic, and he seemed to be listening and\nwaiting.\n\nOnce something startled the horses outside, and he sat up and listened.\n\n\"They're here!\" he said.\n\n\"I don't think so,\" Bassett replied, and went to the doorway. \"No,\" he\ncalled back over his shoulder, \"you go on and finish. I'll watch.\"\n\n\"Come back and eat,\" Dick said surlily.\n\nHe ate very little, but drank of the coffee. Bassett too ate almost\nnothing. He was pulling himself together for the struggle that was to\ncome, marshaling his arguments for flight, and trying to fathom the\nextent of the change in the man across the small table.\n\nDick put down his tin cup and got up. He was strong again, and the\nnightmare confusion of the night had passed away. Instead of it\nthere was a desperate lucidity and a courage born of desperation. He\nremembered it all distinctly; he had killed Howard Lucas the night\nbefore. Before long Wilkins or some of his outfit would ride up to the\ndoor, and take him back to Norada. He was not afraid of that. They would\nalways think he had run away because he was afraid of capture, but it\nwas not that. He had run away from Bev's face. Only he had not got away\nfrom it. It had been with him all night, and it was with him now.\n\nBut he would have to go back. He couldn't be caught like a rat in a\ntrap. The Clarks didn't run away. They were fighters. Only the Clarks\ndidn't kill. They fought, but they didn't murder.\n\nHe picked up his hat and went to the door.\n\n\"Well, you've been mighty kind, old man,\" he said. \"But I've got to go\nback. I ran last night like a scared kid, but I'm through with that sort\nof foolishness.\"\n\n\"I'd give a good bit,\" Bassett said, watching him, \"to know what made\nyou run last night. You were safe where you were.\"\n\n\"I don't know what you are talking about,\" Dick said drearily. \"I\ndidn't run from them. I ran to get away from something.\" He turned away\nirritably. \"You wouldn't understand. Say I was drunk. I was, for that\nmatter. I'm not over it yet.\"\n\nBassett watched him.\n\n\"I see,\" he said quietly. \"It was last night, was it, that this thing\nhappened?\"\n\n\"You know it, don't you?\"\n\n\"And, after it happened, do you remember what followed?\"\n\n\"I've been riding all night. I didn't care what happened. I knew I'd run\ninto a whale of a blizzard, but I--\"\n\nHe stopped and stared outside, to where the horses grazed in the upland\nmeadow, knee deep in mountain flowers. Bassett, watching him, saw the\nincredulity in his eyes, and spoke very gently.\n\n\"My dear fellow,\" he said, \"you are right. Try to understand what I am\nsaying, and take it easy. You rode into a blizzard, right enough. But\nthat was not last night. It was ten years ago.\"\n\n\n\n\nXXIX\n\nHad Bassett had some wider knowledge of Dick's condition he might have\nsucceeded better during that bad hour that followed. Certainly, if he\nhad hoped that the mere statement of fact and its proof would bring\nresults, he failed. And the need for haste, the fear of the pursuit\nbehind them, made him nervous and incoherent.\n\nHe had first to accept the incredible, himself--that Dick Livingstone no\nlonger existed, that he had died and was buried deep in some chamber of\nan unconscious mind. He made every effort to revive him, to restore him\ninto the field of consciousness, but without result. And his struggle\nwas increased in difficulty by the fact that he knew so little of Dick's\nlife. David's name meant nothing, apparently, and it was the only name\nhe knew. He described the Livingstone house; he described Elizabeth as\nhe had seen her that night at the theater. Even Minnie. But Dick only\nshook his head. And until he had aroused some instinct, some desire to\nlive, he could not combat Dick's intention to return and surrender.\n\n\"I understand what you are saying,\" Dick would say. \"I'm trying to get\nit. But it doesn't mean anything to me.\"\n\nHe even tried the war.\n\n\"War? What war?\" Dick asked. And when he heard about it he groaned.\n\n\"A war!\" he said. \"And I've missed it!\"\n\nBut soon after that he got up, and moved to the door.\n\n\"I'm going back,\" he said.\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"They're after me, aren't they?\"\n\n\"You're forgetting again. Why should they be after you now, after ten\nyears?\"\n\n\"I see. I can't get it, you know. I keep listening for them.\"\n\nBassett too was listening, but he kept his fears to himself.\n\n\"Why did you do it?\" he asked finally.\n\n\"I was drunk, and I hated him. He married a girl I was crazy about.\"\n\nBassett tried new tactics. He stressed the absurdity of surrendering for\na crime committed ten years before and forgotten.\n\n\"They won't convict you anyhow,\" he urged. \"It was a quarrel, wasn't it?\nI mean, you didn't deliberately shoot him?\"\n\n\"I don't remember. We quarreled. Yes. I don't remember shooting him.\"\n\n\"What do you remember?\"\n\nDick made an effort, although he was white to the lips.\n\n\"I saw him on the floor,\" he said slowly, and staggered a little.\n\n\"Then you don't even know you did it.\"\n\n\"I hated him.\"\n\nBut Bassett saw that his determination to surrender himself was\nweakening. Bassett fought it with every argument he could summon, and at\nlast he brought forward the one he felt might be conclusive.\n\n\"You see, you've not only made a man's place in the world, Clark, as\nI've told you. You've formed associations you can't get away from.\nYou've got to think of the Livingstones, and you told me yesterday a\nshock would kill the old man. But it's more than that. There's a girl\nback in your town. I think you were engaged to her.\"\n\nBut if he had hoped to pierce the veil with that statement he failed.\nDick's face flushed, and he went to the door of the cabin, much as he\nhad gone to the window the day before. He did not look around when he\nspoke.\n\n\"Then I'm an unconscionable cad,\" he said. \"I've only cared for one\nwoman in my life. And I've shipwrecked her for good.\"\n\n\"You mean--\"\n\n\"You know who I mean.\"\n\nSometime later Bassett got on his horse and rode out to a ledge which\ncommanded a long stretch of trail in the valley below. Far away horsemen\nwere riding along it, one behind the other, small dots that moved on\nslowly but steadily. He turned and went back to the cabin.\n\n\"We'd better be moving,\" he said, \"and it's up to you to say where.\nYou've got two choices. You can go back to Norada and run the chance of\narrest. You know what that means. Without much chance of a conviction\nyou will stand trial and bring wretchedness to the people who stood by\nyou before and who care for you now. Or you can go on over the mountains\nwith me and strike the railroad somewhere to the West. You'll have time\nto think things over, anyhow. They've waited ten years. They can wait\nlonger.\"\n\nTo his relief Dick acquiesced. He had become oddly passive; he seemed\nindeed not greatly interested. He did not even notice the haste with\nwhich Bassett removed the evidences of their meal, or extinguished the\ndying fire and scattered the ashes. Nor, when they were mounted, the\ncare with which they avoided the trail. He gave, when asked, information\nas to the direction of the railroad at the foot of the western slope of\nthe range, and at the same instigation found a trail for them some miles\nbeyond their starting point. But mostly he merely followed, in a dead\nsilence.\n\nThey made slow progress. Both horses were weary and hungry, and the\ngoing was often rough and even dangerous. But for Dick's knowledge of\nthe country they would have been hopelessly lost. Bassett, however,\nalthough tortured with muscular soreness, felt his spirits rising as the\nmiles were covered, and there was no sign of the pursuit.\n\nBy mid-afternoon they were obliged to rest their horses and let them\ngraze, and the necessity of food for themselves became insistent. Dick\nstretched out and was immediately asleep, but the reporter could not\nrest. The magnitude of his undertaking obsessed him. They had covered\nperhaps twenty miles since leaving the cabin, and the railroad was still\nsixty miles away. With fresh horses they could have made it by dawn of\nthe next morning, but he did not believe their jaded animals could go\nmuch farther. The country grew worse instead of better. A pass ahead,\nwhich they must cross, was full of snow.\n\nHe was anxious, too, as to Dick's physical condition. The twitching was\ngone, but he was very pale and he slept like a man exhausted and at his\nphysical limit. But the necessity of crossing the pass before nightfall\nor of waiting until dawn to do it drove Bassett back from an anxious\nreconnoitering of the trail at five o'clock, to rouse the sleeping man\nand start on again.\n\nNear the pass, however, Dick roused himself and took the lead.\n\n\"Let me ahead, Bassett,\" he said peremptorily. \"And give your horse his\nhead. He'll take care of you if you give him a chance.\"\n\nBassett was glad to fall back. He was exhausted and nervous. The trail\nfrightened him. It clung to the side of a rocky wall, twisting and\nturning on itself; it ran under milky waterfalls of glacial water, and\nhigher up it led over an ice field which was a glassy bridge over a\nrushing stream beneath. To add to their wretchedness mosquitoes hung\nabout them in voracious clouds, and tiny black gnats which got into\ntheir eyes and their nostrils and set the horses frantic.\n\nOnce across the ice field Dick's horse fell and for a time could not get\nup again. He lay, making ineffectual efforts to rise, his sides heaving,\nhis eyes rolling in distress. They gave up then, and prepared to make\nsuch camp as they could.\n\nWith the setting of the sun it had grown bitterly cold, and Bassett was\nforced to light a fire. He did it under the protection of the mountain\nwall, and Dick, after unsaddling his fallen horse, built a rough shelter\nof rocks against the wind. After a time the exhausted horse got up, but\nthere was no forage, and the two animals stood disconsolate, or made\nsmall hopeless excursions, noses to the ground, among the moss and scrub\npines.\n\nBefore turning in Bassett divided the remaining contents of the flask\nbetween them, and his last cigarettes. Dick did not talk. He sat, his\nback to the shelter, facing the fire, his mind busy with what Bassett\nknew were bitter and conflicting thoughts. Once, however, as the\nreporter was dozing off, Dick spoke.\n\n\"You said I told you there was a girl,\" he said. \"Did I tell you her\nname?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"All right. Go to sleep. I thought if I heard it it might help.\"\n\nBassett lay back and watched him.\n\n\"Better get some sleep, old man,\" he said.\n\nHe dozed, to waken again cold and shivering. The fire had burned low,\nand Dick was sitting near it, unheeding, and in a deep study. He looked\nup, and Bassett was shocked at the quiet tragedy in his face.\n\n\"Where is Beverly Carlysle now?\" he asked. \"Or do you know?\"\n\n\"Yes. I saw her not long ago.\"\n\n\"Is she married again?\"\n\n\"No. She's revived 'The Valley,' and she's in New York with it.\"\n\nDick slept for only an hour or so that night, but as he slept he\ndreamed. In his dream he was at peace and happy, and there was a girl\nin a black frock who seemed to be a part of that peace. When he roused,\nhowever, still with the warmth of his dream on him, he could not summon\nher. She had slipped away among the shadows of the night.\n\nHe sat by the fire in the grip of a great despair. He had lost ten years\nout of his life, his best years. And he could not go back to where he\nhad left off. There was nothing to go back to but shame and remorse.\nHe looked at Bassett, lying by the fire, and tried to fit him into the\nsituation. Who was he, and why was he here? Why had he ridden out at\nnight alone, into unknown mountains, to find him?\n\nAs though his intent gaze had roused the sleeper, Bassett opened his\neyes, at first drowsily, then wide awake. He raised himself on his\nelbow and listened, as though for some far-off sound, and his face was\nstrained and anxious. But the night was silent, and he relaxed and slept\nagain.\n\nSomething that had been forming itself in Dick's mind suddenly\ncrystallized into conviction. He rose and walked to the edge of the\nmountain wall and stood there listening. When he went back to the\nfire he felt in his pockets, found a small pad and pencil, and bending\nforward to catch the light, commenced to write... At dawn Bassett\nwakened. He was stiff and wretched, and he grunted as he moved. He\nturned over and surveyed the small plateau. It was empty, except for his\nhorse, making its continuous, hopeless search for grass.\n\n\n\n\nXXX\n\nDavid was enjoying his holiday. He lay in bed most of the morning,\nmaking the most of his one after-breakfast cigar and surrounded by\nnewspaper and magazines. He had made friends of the waiter who brought\nhis breakfast, and of the little chambermaid who looked after his room,\nand such conversations as this would follow:\n\n\"Well, Nellie,\" he would say, \"and did you go to the dance on the pier\nlast night?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, doctor.\"\n\n\"Your gentleman friend showed up all right, then?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes. He didn't telephone because he was on a job out of town.\"\n\nHere perhaps David would lower his voice, for Lucy was never far away.\n\n\"Did you wear the flowers?\"\n\n\"Yes, violets. I put one away to remember you by. It was funny at first.\nI wouldn't tell him who gave them to me.\"\n\nDavid would chuckle delightedly.\n\n\"That's right,\" he would say. \"Keep him guessing, the young rascal. We\nmen are kittle cattle, Nellie, kittle cattle!\"\n\nEven the valet unbent to him, and inquired if the doctor needed a man at\nhome to look after him and his clothes. David was enormously tickled.\n\n\"Well,\" he said, with a twinkle in his eye. \"I'll tell you how I manage\nnow, and then you'll see. When I want my trousers pressed I send them\ndownstairs and then I wait in my bathrobe until they come back. I'm a\ntrifle better off for boots, but you'd have to knock Mike, my hired man,\nunconscious before he'd let you touch them.\"\n\nThe valet grinned understandingly.\n\n\"Of course, there's my nephew,\" David went on, a little note of pride in\nhis voice. \"He's become engaged recently, and I notice he's bought some\nclothes. But still I don't think even he will want anybody to hold his\ntrousers while he gets into them.\"\n\nDavid chuckled over that for a long time after the valet had gone.\n\nHe was quite happy and contented. He spent all afternoon in a roller\nchair, conversing affably with the man who pushed him, and now and\nthen when Lucy was out of sight getting out and stretching his legs. He\npicked up lost children and lonely dogs, and tried his eye in a shooting\ngallery, and had hard work keeping off the roller coasters and out of\nthe sea.\n\nThen, one day, when he had been gone some time, he was astonished on\nentering his hotel to find Harrison Miller sitting in the lobby. David\nbeamed with surprise and pleasure.\n\n\"You old humbug!\" he said. \"Off on a jaunt after all! And the contempt\nof you when I was shipped here!\"\n\nHarrison Miller was constrained and uncomfortable. He had meant to see\nLucy first. She was a sensible woman, and she would know just what David\ncould stand, or could not. But David did not notice his constraint; took\nhim to his room, made him admire the ocean view, gave him a cigar, and\nthen sat down across from him, beaming and hospitable.\n\n\"Suffering Crimus, Miller,\" he said. \"I didn't know I was homesick until\nI saw you. Well, how's everything? Dick's letters haven't been much, and\nwe haven't had any for several days.\"\n\nHarrison Miller cleared his throat. He knew that David had not been\ntold of Jim Wheeler's death, but that Lucy knew. He knew too from Walter\nWheeler that David did not know that Dick had gone west. Did Lucy know\nthat, or not? Probably yes. But he considered the entire benevolent\nconspiracy an absurdity and a mistake. It was making him uncomfortable,\nand most of his life had been devoted to being comfortable.\n\nHe decided to temporize.\n\n\"Things are about the same,\" he said. \"They're going to pave Chisholm\nStreet. And your Mike knocked down the night watchman last week. I got\nhim off with a fine.\"\n\n\"I hope he hasn't been in my cellar. He's got a weakness, but\nthen--How's Dick? Not overworking?\"\n\n\"No. He's all right.\"\n\nBut David was no man's fool. He began to see something strange in\nHarrison's manner, and he bent forward in his chair.\n\n\"Look here, Harrison,\" he said, \"there's something the matter with you.\nYou've got something on your mind.\"\n\n\"Well, I have and I haven't. I'd like to see Lucy, David, if she's\nabout.\"\n\n\"Lucy's gadding. You can tell me if you can her. What is it? Is it about\nDick?\"\n\n\"In a way, yes.\"\n\n\"He's not sick?\"\n\n\"No. He's all right, as far as I know. I guess I'd better tell you,\nDavid. Walter Wheeler has got some sort of bee in his bonnet, and he\ngot me to come on. Dick was pretty tired and--well, one or two things\nhappened to worry him. One was that Jim Wheeler--you'll get this sooner\nor later--was in an automobile accident, and it did for him.\"\n\nDavid had lost some of his ruddy color. It was a moment before he spoke.\n\n\"Poor Jim,\" he said hoarsely. \"He was a good boy, only full of life. It\nwill be hard on the family.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Harrison Miller said simply.\n\nBut David was resentful, too. When his friends were in trouble he wanted\nto know about it. He was somewhat indignant and not a little hurt. But\nhe soon reverted to Dick.\n\n\"I'll go back and send him off for a rest,\" he said. \"I'm as good as\nI'll ever be, and the boy's tired. What's the bee in Wheeler's bonnet?\"\n\n\"Look here, David, you know your own business best, and Wheeler didn't\nfeel at liberty to tell me very much. But he seemed to think you were\nthe only one who could tell us certain things. He'd have come himself,\nbut it's not easy for him to leave the family just now. Dick went away\njust after Jim's funeral. He left a young chap named Reynolds in his\nplace, and, I believe, in order not to worry you, some letters to be\nmailed at intervals.\"\n\n\"Went where?\" David asked, in a terrible voice.\n\n\"To a town called Norada, in Wyoming. Near his old home somewhere. And\nthe Wheelers haven't heard anything from him since the day he got there.\nThat's three weeks ago. He wrote Elizabeth the night he got there, and\nwired her at the same time. There's been nothing since.\"\n\nDavid was gripping the arms of his chair with both hands, but he forced\nhimself to calmness.\n\n\"I'll go to Norada at once,\" he said. \"Get a time-table, Harrison, and\nring for the valet.\"\n\n\"Not on your life you won't. I'm here to do that, when I've got\nsomething to go on. Wheeler thought you might have heard from him. If\nyou hadn't, I was to get all the information I could and then start.\nElizabeth's almost crazy. We wired the chief of police of Norada\nyesterday.\"\n\n\"Yes!\" David said thickly. \"Trust your friends to make every damned\nmistake possible! You've set the whole pack on his trail.\" And then he\nfell back in his chair, and gasped, \"Open the window!\"\n\nWhen Lucy came in, a half hour later, she found David on his bed with\nthe hotel doctor beside him, and Harrison Miller in the room. David was\nfighting for breath, but he was conscious and very calm. He looked up at\nher and spoke slowly and distinctly.\n\n\"They've got Dick, Lucy,\" he said.\n\nHe looked aged and pinched, and entirely hopeless. Even after his heart\nhad quieted down and he lay still among his pillows, he gave no evidence\nof his old fighting spirit. He lay with his eyes shut, relaxed and\npassive. He had done his best, and he had failed. It was out of his\nhands now, and in the hands of God. Once, as he lay there, he prayed. He\nsaid that he had failed, and that now he was too old and weak to fight.\nThat God would have to take it on, and do the best He could. But he\nadded that if God did not save Dick and bring him back to happiness,\nthat he, David, was through.\n\nToward morning he wakened from a light sleep. The door into Lucy's room\nwas open and a dim light was burning beyond it. David called her, and by\nher immediate response he knew she had not been sleeping.\n\n\"Yes, David,\" she said, and came padding in in her bedroom slippers\nand wadded dressing-gown, a tragic figure of apprehension, determinedly\nsmiling. \"What do you want?\"\n\n\"Sit down, Lucy.\"\n\nWhen she had done so he put out his hand, fumbling for hers. She was\ntouched and alarmed, for it was a long while since there had been any\nopen demonstration of affection between them. David was silent for a\ntime, absorbed in thought. Then:\n\n\"I'm not in very good shape, Lucy. I suppose you know that. This old\npump of mine has sprung a leak or something. I don't want you to worry\nif anything happens. I've come to the time when I've got a good many\nover there, and it will be like going home.\"\n\nLucy nodded. Her chin quivered. She smoothed his hand, with its high\ntwisted veins.\n\n\"I know, David,\" she said. \"Mother and father, and Henry, and a good\nmany friends. But I need you, too. You're all I have, now that Dick--\"\n\n\"That's why I called you. If I can get out there, I'll go. And I'll put\nup a fight that will make them wish they'd never started anything. But\nif I can't, if I--\" She felt his fingers tighten on her hand. \"If Hattie\nThorwald is still living, we'll put her on the stand. If I can't go,\nfor any reason, I want you to see that she is called. And you know where\nHenry's statement is?\"\n\n\"In your box, isn't it?\"\n\n\"Yes. Have the statement read first, and then have her called to\ncorroborate it. Tell the story I have told you--or no, I'll dictate it\nto you in the morning, and sign it before witnesses. Jake and Bill will\ntestify too.\"\n\nHe felt easier in his mind after that. He had marshalled his forces and\nbegun his preparations for battle. He felt less apprehension now in case\nhe fell asleep, to waken among those he had loved long since and lost\nawhile. After a few moments his eyes closed, and Lucy went back to her\nbed and crawled into it.\n\nIt was, however, Harrison Miller who took the statement that morning.\nLucy's cramped old hand wrote too slowly for David's impatience.\nHarrison Miller took it, on hotel stationery, covering the carefully\nnumbered pages with his neat, copper-plate writing. He wrote with an\nimpassive face, but with intense interest, for by that time he knew\nDick's story.\n\nNever, in his orderly bachelor life, of daily papers and a flower garden\nand political economy at night, had he been so close to the passions of\nmen to love and hate and the disorder they brought with them.\n\n\n\n\nXXXI\n\n\"My brother, Henry Livingstone, was not a strong man,\" David dictated.\n\"He had the same heart condition I have, but it developed earlier. After\nhe left college he went to Arizona and bought a ranch, and there he\nmet and chummed with Elihu Clark, who had bought an old mine and was\nreworking it. Henry loaned him a small amount of money at that time, and\na number of years later in return for that, when Henry's health failed,\nClark, who had grown wealthy, bought him a ranch in Wyoming at Dry\nRiver, not far from Clark's own property.\n\n\"Henry had been teaching in an Eastern university, and then taken up\ntutoring. We saw little of him. He was a student, and he became almost a\nrecluse. I saw less of him than ever after Clark gave him the ranch.\n\n\"In the spring of 1910 Henry wrote me that he was not well, and I went\nout to see him. He seemed worried and was in bad shape physically. Elihu\nClark had died five years before, and left him a fair sum of money,\nfifty thousand dollars, but he was living in a way which made me think\nhe was not using it. The ranch buildings were dilapidated, and there was\nnothing but the barest necessities in the house.\n\n\"I taxed Henry with miserliness, and he then told me that the money was\nnot his, but left to him to be used for an illegitimate son of Clark's,\nborn before his marriage, the child of a small rancher's daughter named\nHattie Burgess. The Burgess girl had gone to Omaha for its birth, and\nthe story was not known. In early years Clark had paid the child's board\nthrough his lawyer to an Omaha woman named Hines, and had later sent him\nto college. The Burgess girl married a Swede named Thorwald. The boy was\neight years older than Judson, Clark's legitimate son.\n\n\"After the death of his wife Elihu Clark began to think about the child,\nespecially after Judson became a fair-sized boy. He had the older boy,\nwho went by the name of Hines, sent to college, and in summer he stayed\nat Henry's tutoring school. Henry said the boy was like the Burgess\nfamily, blonde and excitable and rather commonplace. He did not get on\nwell at college, and did not graduate. So far as he knew, Clark never\nsaw him.\n\n\"The boy himself believed that he was an orphan, and that the Hines\nwoman had adopted him as a foundling. But on the death of the woman he\nfound that she had no estate, and that a firm of New York attorneys had\nbeen paying his college bills.\n\n\"He had spent considerable time with Henry, one way and another, and\nhe began to think that Henry knew who he was. He thought at first that\nHenry was his father, and there was some trouble. In order to end it\nHenry finally acknowledged that he knew who the father was, and after\nthat he had no peace. Clifton--his name was Clifton Hines--attacked\nHenry once, and if it had not been for the two men on the place he would\nhave hurt him.\n\n\"Henry began to give him money. Clark had left the fifty thousand for\nthe boy with the idea that Henry should start him in business with it.\nBut he only turned up wild-cat schemes that Henry would not listen to.\nHe did not know how Henry got the money, or from where. He thought for a\nlong time that Henry had saved it.\n\n\"I'd better say here that Henry was fond of Clifton, although he didn't\napprove of him. He'd never married, and the boy was like a son to him\nfor a good many years. He didn't have him at the ranch much, however,\nfor he was a Burgess through and through and looked like them. And he\nwas always afraid that somehow the story would get out.\n\n\"Then Clifton learned, somehow or other, of Clark's legacy to Henry, and\nhe put two and two together. There was a bad time, but Henry denied it\nand they went upstairs to bed. That night Clifton broke into Henry's\ndesk and found some letters from Elihu Clark that told the story.\n\n\"He almost went crazy. He took the papers up to Henry's and wakened him,\nstanding over Henry with them in hand, and shaking all over. I think\nthey had a struggle, too. All Henry told me was that he took them from\nhim and threw them in the fire.\n\n\"That was a year before Henry died, and at the time young Jud Clark's\nname was in all the newspapers. He had left college after a wild\ncareer there, and although Elihu had tied up the property until Jud was\ntwenty-one, Jud had his mother's estate and a big allowance. Then, too,\nhe borrowed on his prospects, and he lost a hundred thousand dollars at\nMonte Carlo within six weeks after he graduated.\n\n\"One way and another he was always in the newspapers, and when he saw\nhow Jud was throwing money away Clifton went wild.\n\n\"As Henry had burned the letters he had no proofs. He didn't know who\nhis mother was, but he set to work to find out. He ferreted into Elihu's\npast life, and he learned something about Hattie Burgess, or Thorwald.\nShe was married by that time, and lived on a little ranch near Norada.\nHe went to see her, and he accused her downright of being his mother. It\nmust have been a bad time for her, for after all he was her son, and\nshe had to disclaim him. She had a husband and a boy by that husband,\nhowever, by that time, and she was desperate. She threw him off the\ntrack somehow, lied and talked him down, and then went to bed in\ncollapse. She sent for Henry later and told him.\n\n\"The queer thing was that as soon as she saw him she wanted him. He\nwas her son. She went to Henry one night, and said she had perjured her\nsoul, and that she wanted him back. She wasn't in love with Thorwald.\nI think she'd always cared for Clark. She went away finally, however,\nafter promising Henry she would keep Clark's secret. But I have a\nsuspicion that later on she acknowledged the truth to the boy.\n\n\"What he wanted, of course, was a share of the Clark estate. Of course\nhe hadn't a chance in law, but he saw a chance to blackmail young Jud\nClark and he tried it. Not personally, for he hadn't any real courage,\nbut by mail. Clark's attorneys wrote back saying they would jail him if\nhe tried it again, and he went back to Dry River and after Henry again.\n\n\"That was in the spring of 1911. Henry was uneasy, for Clifton was not\nlike himself. He had spells of brooding, and he took to making long\ntrips on his horse into the mountains, and coming in with the animal run\nto death. Henry thought, too, that he was seeing the Thorwald woman,\nthe mother. Thorwald had died, and she was living with the son on their\nranch and trying to sell it. He thought Hines was trying to have her\nmake a confession which would give him a hold on Jud Clark.\n\n\"Henry was not well, and in the early fall he knew he hadn't long to\nlive. He wrote out the story and left it in his desk for me to read\nafter he had gone, and as he added to it from time to time, when I got\nit it was almost up to date.\n\n\"Judson came back to the Clark ranch in September, bringing along an\nactress named Beverly Carlysle, and her husband, Howard Lucas. There was\nconsiderable talk, because it was known Jud had been infatuated with\nthe woman. But no one saw much of the party, outside of the ranch. The\nCarlysle woman seemed to be a lady, but the story was that both men were\ndrinking a good bit, especially Jud.\n\n\"Henry wrote that Hines had been in the East for some months at that\ntime, and that he had not heard from him. But he felt that it was only a\ntruce, and that he would turn up again, hell bent for trouble. He made\na will and left the money to me, with instructions to turn it over\nto Hines. It is still in the bank, and amounts to about thirty-five\nthousand dollars. It is not mine, and I will not touch it. But I have\nnever located Clifton Hines.\n\n\"In the last entry in his record I call attention to my brother's\nstatement that he did not regard Clifton Hines as entirely sane on this\none matter, and to his conviction that the hatred Hines then bore him,\namounting to a delusion of persecution, might on his death turn against\nJudson Clark. He instructed me to go to Clark, tell him the story, and\nput him on his guard.\n\n\"Clark and his party had been at the ranch only a day or two when one\nnight Hines turned up at Dry River. He wanted the fifty thousand, or\nwhat was left of it, and when he failed to move Henry he attacked him.\nThe two men on the place heard the noise and ran in, but Hines got away.\nHenry swore them to secrecy, and told them the story. He felt he might\nneed help.\n\n\"From what the two men at the ranch told me when I got there, I think\nHines stayed somewhere in the mountains for the next day or two, and\nthat he came down for food the night Henry died.\n\n\"Just what he contributed to Henry's death I do not know. Henry fell in\none room, and was found in bed in another when the hands had been taking\nthe cattle to the winter range, and he'd been alone in the house.\n\n\"When I got there the funeral was over. I read the letter he had left,\nand then I talked to the two hands, Bill Ardary and Jake Mazetti. They\nwould not talk at first, but I showed them Henry's record and then\nthey were free enough. The autopsy had shown that Henry died from heart\ndisease, but he had a cut on his head also, and they believed that Hines\nhad come back, had quarreled with him again, and had knocked him down.\n\n\"As Henry had in a way handed over to me his responsibility for the boy,\nand as I wanted to transfer the money, I waited for three weeks at the\nranch, hoping he would turn up again. I saw the Thorwald woman, but she\nprotested that she did not know where he was. And I made two attempts\nto see and warn Jud Clark, but failed both times. Then one night the\nThorwald woman came in, looking like a ghost, and admitted that Hines\nhad been hiding in the mountains since Henry's death, that he insisted\nhe had killed him, and that he blamed Jud Clark for that, and for all\nthe rest of his troubles. She was afraid he would kill Clark. The three\nof us, the two men at the ranch and myself, prepared to go into the\nmountains and hunt for him, before he got snowed in.\n\n\"Then came the shooting at the Clark place, and I rode over that night\nin a howling storm and helped the coroner and a Norada doctor in the\nexamination. All the evidence was against Clark, especially his running\naway. But I happened on Hattie Thorwald outside on a verandah--she'd\nbeen working at the house--and I didn't need any conversation to tell me\nwhat she thought. All she said was:\n\n\"He didn't do it, doctor. He's still in the mountains.\"\n\n\"He's been here to-night, Hattie, and you know it. He shot the wrong\nman.\"\n\n\"But she swore he hadn't been, and at the end I didn't know. I'll say\nright now that I don't know. But I'll say, too, that I believe that\nis what happened, and that Hines probably stayed hidden that night on\nHattie Thorwald's place. I went there the next day, but she denied it\nall, and said he was still in the mountains. She carried on about the\nblizzard and his being frozen to death, until I began to think she was\ntelling the truth.\n\n\"The next day I did what only a tenderfoot would do, started into the\nmountains alone. Bill and Jake were out with a posse after Clark, and\nI packed up some food and started. I'll not go into the details of that\ntrip. I went in from the Dry River Canyon, and I guess I faced death a\ndozen times the first day. I had a map, but I lost myself in six hours.\nI had food and blankets and an axe along, and I built a shelter and\nstayed there overnight. I had to cut up one of my blankets the next\nmorning and tie up the horse's feet, so he wouldn't sink too deep in the\nsnow. But it stayed cold and the snow hardened, and we got along better\nafter that.\n\n\"I'd have turned back more than once, but I thought I'd meet up with\nsome of the sheriff's party. I didn't do that, but I stumbled on a\ntrail on the third day, toward evening. It was the trail made by John\nDonaldson, as I learned later. I followed it, but I concluded after a\nwhile that whoever made it was lost, too. It seemed to be going in a\ncircle. I was in bad shape and had frozen a part of my right hand, when\nI saw a cabin, and there was smoke coming out of the chimney.\"\n\nFrom that time on David's statement dealt with the situation in the\ncabin; with Jud Clark and the Donaldsons, and with the snow storm, which\nbegan again and lasted for days. He spoke at length of his discovery of\nClark's identity, and of the fact that the boy had lost all memory of\nwhat had happened, and even of who he was. He went into that in detail;\nthe peculiar effect of fear and mental shock on a high-strung nature,\nespecially where the physical condition was lowered by excess and\nwrong-living; his early attempts, as the boy improved, to pierce the\nveil, and then his slow-growing conviction that it were an act of mercy\nnot to do so. The Donaldsons' faithfulness, the cessation of the search\nunder the conviction that Clark was dead, both were there, and also\nDavid's growing liking for Judson himself. But David's own psychology\nwas interesting and clearly put.\n\n\"First of all,\" he dictated, in his careful old voice, \"it must be\nremembered that I was not certain that the boy had committed the crime.\nI believed, and I still believe, that Lucas was shot by Clifton Hines,\nprobably through an open window. There were no powder marks on the body.\nI believed, too, and still believe, that Hines had fled after the crime,\neither to Hattie Thorwald's house or to the mountains. In one case he\nhad escaped and could not be brought to justice, and in the other he was\ndead, and beyond conviction.\n\n\"But there is another element which I urge, not in defense but in\nexplanation. The boy Judson Clark was a new slate to write on. He had\nnever had a chance. He had had too much money, too much liberty, too\nlittle responsibility. His errors had been wiped away by the loss of his\nmemory, and he had, I felt, a chance for a new and useful life.\n\n\"I did not come to my decision quickly. It was a long fight for his\nlife, for he had contracted pneumonia, and he had the drinker's heart.\nBut in the long days of his convalescence while Maggie worked in\nthe lean-to, I had time to see what might be done. If in making an\nexperiment with a man's soul I usurped the authority of my Lord and\nMaster, I am sorry. But he knows that I did it for the best.\n\n\"I deliberately built up for Judson Clark a new identity. He was my\nnephew, my brother Henry's son. He had the traditions of an honorable\nfamily to carry on, and those traditions were honor, integrity,\nclean living and work. I did not stress love, for that I felt must be\nexperienced, not talked about. But love was to be the foundation on\nwhich I built. The boy had had no love in his life.\n\n\"It has worked out. I may not live to see it at its fullest, but I defy\nthe world to produce today a finer or more honorable gentleman, a more\nuseful member of the community. And it will last. The time may come when\nJudson Clark will again be Judson Clark. I have expected it for many\nyears. But he will never again be the Judson Clark of ten years ago.\nHe may even will to return to the old reckless ways, but as I lie here,\nperhaps never to see him, I say this: he cannot go back. His character\nand habits of thought are established.\n\n\"To convict Judson Clark of the murder of Howard Lucas is to convict\na probably or at least possibly innocent man. To convict Richard\nLivingstone of that crime is to convict a different man, innocent of the\ncrime, innocent of its memory, innocent of any single impulse to lift\nhis hand against a law of God or the state.\"\n\n\n\n\nXXXII\n\nFor a month Haverly had buzzed with whispered conjectures. It knew\nnothing, and yet somehow it knew everything. Doctor David was ill at\nthe seashore, and Dick was not with him. Harrison Miller, who was never\nknown to depart farther from his comfortable hearth than the railway\nstation in one direction and the Sayre house in the other, had made a\ntrip East and was now in the far West. Doctor Reynolds, who might or\nmight not know something, had joined the country club and sent for his\ngolf bag.\n\nAnd Elizabeth Wheeler was going around with a drawn white face and a\ndetermined smile that faded the moment one looked away.\n\nThe village was hurt and suspicious. It resented its lack of knowledge,\nand turned cynical where, had it been taken into confidence, it would\nhave been solicitous. It believed that Elizabeth had been jilted, for\nit knew, via Annie and the Oglethorpe's laundress, that no letters came\nfrom Dick. And against Dick its indignation was directed, in a hot flame\nof mainly feminine anger.\n\nBut it sensed a mystery, too, and if it hated a jilt it loved a mystery.\n\nNina had taken to going about with her small pointed chin held high, and\nangrily she demanded that Elizabeth do the same.\n\n\"You know what they are saying, and yet you go about looking crushed.\"\n\n\"I can't act, Nina. I do go about.\"\n\nAnd Nina had a softened moment.\n\n\"Don't think about him,\" she said. \"He isn't sick, or he would have\nhad some one wire or write, and he isn't dead, or they'd have found his\npapers and let us know.\"\n\n\"Then he's in some sort of trouble. I want to go out there. I want to go\nout there!\"\n\nThat, indeed, had been her constant cry for the last two weeks. She\nwould have done it probably, packed her bag and slipped away, but she\nhad no money of her own, and even Leslie, to whom she appealed, had\nrefused her when he knew her purpose.\n\n\"We're following him up, little sister,\" he said. \"Harrison Miller has\ngone out, and there's enough talk as it is.\"\n\nShe thought, lying in her bed at night, that they were all too afraid\nof what people might say. It seemed so unimportant to her. And she could\nnot understand the conspiracy of silence. Other men went away and were\nnot heard from, and the police were notified and the papers told. It\nseemed to her, too, that every one, her father and Nina and Leslie and\neven Harrison Miller, knew more than she did.\n\nThere had been that long conference behind closed doors, when Harrison\nMiller came back from seeing David, and before he went west. Leslie had\nbeen there, and even Doctor Reynolds, but they had shut her out. And her\nfather had not been the same since.\n\nHe seemed, sometimes, to be burning with a sort of inner anger. Not at\nher, however. He was very gentle with her.\n\nAnd here was a curious thing. She had always felt that she knew when\nDick was thinking of her. All at once, and without any warning, there\nwould come a glow of happiness and warmth, and a sort of surrounding\nand encircling sense of protection. Rather like what she had felt as a\nlittle girl when she had run home through the terrors of twilight, and\nclosed the house door behind her. She was in the warm and lighted house,\nsafe and cared for.\n\nThat was completely gone. It was as though the warm and lighted house\nof her love had turned her out and locked the door, and she was alone\noutside, cold and frightened.\n\nShe avoided the village, and from a sense of delicacy it left her alone.\nThe small gaieties of the summer were on, dinners, dances and picnics,\nbut her mourning made her absence inconspicuous. She could not, however,\navoid Mrs. Sayre. She tried to, at first, but that lady's insistence and\nher own apathy made it easier to accept than to refuse. Then, after a\ntime, she found the house rather a refuge. She seldom saw Wallie, and\nshe found her hostess tactful, kindly and uninquisitive.\n\n\"Take the scissors and a basket, child, and cut your mother some roses,\"\nshe would say. Or they would loot the green houses and, going in the car\nto the cemetery, make of Jim's grave a thing of beauty and remembrance.\n\nNow and then, of course, she saw Wallie, but he never reverted to the\nday she had told him of her engagement. Mother and son, she began to\nfeel that only with them could she be herself. For the village, her chin\nhigh as Nina had said. At home, assumed cheerfulness. Only at the house\non the hill could she drop her pose.\n\nShe waited with a sort of desperate courage for word from Harrison\nMiller. What she wanted that word to be she did not know. There were,\nof course, times when she had to face the possibility that Dick had\ndeliberately cut himself off from her. After all, there had never been\nany real reason why he should care for her. She was not clever and not\nbeautiful. Perhaps he had been disappointed in her, and this was the\nthing they were concealing. Perhaps he had gone back to Wyoming and had\nthere found some one more worthy of im, some one who understood when he\ntalked about the things he did in his laboratory, and did not just sit\nand listen with loving, rather bewildered eyes.\n\nThen, one night at dinner, a telegram was brought in, and she knew it\nwas the expected word. She felt her mother's eyes on her, and she sat\nvery still with her hands clenched in her lap. But her father did not\nread it at the table; he got up and went out, and some time later he\ncame to the door. The telegram was not in sight.\n\n\"That was from Harrison Miller,\" he said. \"He has traced Dick to a hotel\nat Norada, but he had left the hotel, and he hasn't got in touch with\nhim yet.\"\n\nHe went away then, and they heard the house door close.\n\nThen, some days later, she learned that Harrison Miller was coming home,\nand that David was being brought back. She saw that telegram from Mr.\nMiller, and read into it failure and discouragement, and something more\nominous than either.\n\n\"Reach home Tuesday night. Nothing definite. Think safe.\"\n\n\"Think safe?\" she asked, breathlessly. \"Then he has been in danger? What\nare you keeping from me?\" And when no one spoke: \"Oh, don't you see how\ncruel it is? You are all trying to protect me, and you are killing me\ninstead.\"\n\n\"Not danger,\" her father said, slowly. \"So far as we know, he is well.\nIs all right.\" And seeing her face: \"It is nothing that affects his\nfeeling for you, dear. He is thinking of you and loving you, wherever he\nis. Only, we don't know where he is.\"\n\nBut when he came back on Tuesday, after seeing Harrison Miller, he was\ndiscouraged and sick at heart. He went directly upstairs to his wife,\nand shut the bedroom door.\n\n\"Not a trace,\" he said, in reply to the question in her eyes. \"The\nsituation is as he outlined it in the letter. He elaborated, of course.\nThe fact is, and David will have to see it, that that statement of his\ndoesn't help at all, unless he can prove there is a Clifton Hines. And\neven then it's all supposition. There's a strong sentiment out there\nthat Dick either killed himself or met with an accident and died in the\nmountains. The horse wandered into town last week. I'll have to tell\nher.\"\n\nOver this possibility they faced each other, a tragic middle-aged pair,\nhelpless as is the way of middle-age before the attacks of life on their\nyoung.\n\n\"It will kill her, Walter.\"\n\n\"She's young,\" he said sturdily. \"She'll get over it.\"\n\nBut he did not think so, and she knew it.\n\n\"There is a rather queer element in it,\" he observed, after a time.\n\"Another man, named Bassett, disappeared the same night. His stuff is at\nthe hotel, but no papers to identify him. He had looked after Dick that\nday when he was sick, and he simply vanished. He didn't take the train.\nHe was under suspicion for being with Dick, and the station was being\nwatched.\" But she was not interested in Bassett. The name meant nothing\nto her. She harked back to the question that had been in both their\nminds since they had read, in stupefied amazement, David's statement.\n\n\"In a way, Walter, it would be better, if he...\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"My little girl, and--Judson Clark!\"\n\nBut he fought that sturdily. They had ten years of knowledge and respect\nto build on. The past was past. All he prayed for was Dick's return, an\nend to this long waiting. There would be no reservations in his welcome,\nif only--\n\nSome time later he went downstairs, to where Elizabeth sat waiting in\nthe library. He went like a man to his execution, and his resolution\nnearly gave way when he saw her, small in her big chair and pathetically\npatient. He told her the story as guardedly as he could. He began with\nDick's story to him, about his forgotten youth, and went on carefully\nto Dick's own feeling that he must clear up that past before he married.\nShe followed him carefully, bewildered a little and very tense.\n\n\"But why didn't he tell me?\"\n\n\"He saw it as a sort of weakness. He meant to when he came back.\"\n\nHe fought Dick's fight for him valiantly, stressing certain points\nthat were to prepare her for others to come. He plunged, indeed, rather\nrecklessly into the psychology of the situation, and only got out of the\nunconscious mind with an effort. But behind it all was his overwhelming\ndesire to save her pain.\n\n\"You must remember,\" he said, \"that Dick's life before this happened,\nand since, are two different things. Whatever he did then should not\ncount against him now.\"\n\n\"Of course not,\" she said. \"Then he--had done something?\"\n\n\"Yes. Something that brought him into conflict with the authorities.\"\n\nShe did not shrink from that, and he was encouraged to go on.\n\n\"He was young then, remember. Only twenty-one or so. And there was a\nquarrel with another man. The other man was shot.\"\n\n\"You mean Dick shot him?\"\n\n\"Yes. You understand, don't you,\" he added anxiously, \"that he doesn't\nremember doing it?\"\n\nIn spite of his anxiety he was forced to marvel at the sublime faith\nwith which she made her comment, through lips that had gone white.\n\n\"Then it was either an accident, or he deserved shooting,\" she said. But\nshe inquired, he thought with difficulty, \"Did he die?\"\n\nHe could not lie to her. \"Yes,\" he said.\n\nShe closed her eyes, but a moment later she was fighting her valiant\nfight again for Dick.\n\n\"But they let him go,\" she protested. \"Men do shoot in the West, don't\nthey? There must have been a reason for it. You know Dick as well as I\ndo. He couldn't do a wrong thing.\"\n\nHe let that pass. \"Nothing was done about it at the time,\" he said.\n\"And Dick came here and lived his useful life among us. He wouldn't have\nknown the man's name if he heard it. But do you see, sweetheart, where\nthis is taking us? He went back, and they tried to get him, for a thing\nhe didn't remember doing.\"\n\n\"Father!\" she said, and went very white. \"Is that where he is? In\nprison?\"\n\nHe tried to steady his voice.\n\n\"No, dear. He escaped into the mountains. But you can understand his\nsilence. You can understand, too, that he may feel he cannot come back\nto us, with this thing hanging over him. What we have to do now is to\nfind him, and to tell him that it makes no difference. That he has his\nplace in the world waiting for him, and that we are waiting too.\"\n\nWhen it was all over, her questions and his sometimes stumbling replies,\nhe saw that out of it all the one thing that mattered vitally to her was\nthat Dick was only a fugitive, and not dead. But she said, just before\nthey went, arm in arm, up the stairs:\n\n\"It is queer in one way, father. It isn't like him to run away.\"\n\nHe told Margaret, later, and she listened carefully.\n\n\"Then you didn't tell her about the woman in the case?\"\n\n\"Certainly not. Why should I?\"\n\nMrs. Wheeler looked at him, with the eternal surprise of woman at the\nlack of masculine understanding.\n\n\"Because, whether you think it or not, she will resent and hate that as\nshe hates nothing else. Murder will be nothing, to that. And she will\nhave to know it some time.\"\n\nHe pondered her flat statement unhappily, standing by the window and\nlooking out into the shaded street, and a man who had been standing,\ncigar in mouth, on a pavement across withdrew into the shadow of a tree\nbox.\n\n\"It's all a puzzle to me,\" he said, at last. \"God alone knows how it\nwill turn out. Harrison Miller seems to think this Bassett, whoever he\nis, could tell us something. I don't know.\"\n\nHe drew the shade and wound his watch. \"I don't know,\" he repeated.\n\nOutside, on the street, the man with the cigar struck a match and looked\nat his watch. Then he walked briskly toward the railway station. A half\nhour later he walked into the offices of the Times-Republican and to the\nnight editor's desk.\n\n\"Hello, Bassett,\" said that gentleman. \"We thought you were dead. Well,\nhow about the sister in California? It was the Clark story, wasn't it?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Bassett, noncommittally.\n\n\"And it blew up on you! Well, there were others who were fooled, too.\nYou had a holiday, anyhow.\"\n\n\"Yes, I had a holiday,\" said Bassett, and going over to his own desk\nbegan to sort his vast accumulation of mail. Sometime later he found the\nnight editor at his elbow.\n\n\"Did you get anything on the Clark business at all?\" he asked. \"Williams\nthinks there's a page in it for Sunday, anyhow. You've been on the\nground, and there's a human interest element in it. The last man who\ntalked to Clark; the ranch to-day. That sort of thing.\"\n\nBassett went on doggedly sorting his mail.\n\n\"You take it from me,\" he said, \"the story's dead, and so is Clark. The\nDonaldson woman was crazy. That's all.\"\n\n\n\n\nXXXIII\n\nDavid was brought home the next day, a shrivelled and aged David, but\nwith a fighting fire in his eyes and a careful smile at the station for\nthe group of friends who met him.\n\nDavid had decided on a course and meant to follow it. That course was to\nprotect Dick's name, and to keep the place he had made in the world open\nfor him. Not even to Lucy had he yet breathed the terror that was with\nhim day and night, that Dick had reached the breaking point and had gone\nback. But he knew it was possible. Lauler had warned him against shocks\nand trouble, and looking back David could see the gradually accumulating\npressure against that mental wall of Dick's subconscious building;\noverwork and David's illness, his love affair and Jim Wheeler's tragedy,\nand coming on top of that, in some way he had not yet learned, the\nknowledge that he was Judson Clark and a fugitive from the law. The work\nof ten years perhaps undone.\n\nBoth David and Lucy found the home-coming painful. Harrison Miller rode\nup with them from the station, and between him and Doctor Reynolds David\nwalked into his house and was assisted up the stairs. At the door of\nDick's room he stopped and looked in, and then went on, his face set and\nrigid. He would not go to bed, but sat in his chair while about him went\non the bustle of the return, the bringing up of trunks and bags; but\nthe careful smile was gone, and his throat, now so much too thin for his\ncollar, worked convulsively.\n\nHe had got Harrison Miller's narrative from him on the way from the\nstation, and it had only confirmed his suspicions.\n\n\"He had been in a stupor all day,\" Miller related, \"and was being\ncared for by a man named Bassett. I daresay that's the man Gregory had\nreferred to. He may have become suspicious of Bassett. I don't know. But\na chambermaid recognized him as he was making his escape, and raised an\nalarm. He got a horse out of the courtyard of the hotel, and not a sign\nof him has been found since.\"\n\n\"It wasn't Bassett who raised the alarm?\"\n\n\"No, apparently not. The odd thing is that this Bassett disappeared,\ntoo, the same night. I called up his paper yesterday, but he hasn't\nshown up.\"\n\nAnd with some small amplifications, that is all there was to it.\n\nBefore Harrison Miller and Doctor Reynolds left him to rest, David\ncalled Lucy in, and put his plea to all of them.\n\n\"It is my hope,\" he said, \"to carry on exactly as though Dick might walk\nin to-morrow and take his place again. As I hold to my belief in God,\nso I hold to my conviction that he will come back, and that before\nI--before long. But our friends will be asking where he is and what he\nis doing, and we would better agree on that beforehand. What we'd better\nsay is simply that Dick was called away on business connected with\nsome property in the West. They may not believe it, but they'll hardly\ndisprove it.\"\n\nSo the benevolent conspiracy to protect Dick Livingstone's name was\narranged, and from that time on the four of them who were a party to it\nturned to the outside world an unbroken front of loyalty and courage.\nEven to Minnie, anxious and red-eyed in her kitchen, Lucy gave the same\nexplanation while she arranged David's tray.\n\n\"He has been detained in the West on business,\" Lucy said.\n\n\"He might have sent me a postcard. And he hasn't written Doctor Reynolds\nat all.\"\n\n\"He has been very busy. Get the sugar bowl, Minnie. He'll be back soon,\nI'm sure.\"\n\nBut Minnie did not immediately move.\n\n\"He'd better come soon if he wants to see Doctor David,\" she said, with\ntwitching lips. \"And I'll just say this, Mrs. Crosby. The talk that's\ngoing on in this town is something awful.\"\n\n\"I don't want to hear it,\" Lucy said firmly.\n\nShe ate alone, painfully remembering that last gay little feast before\nthey started away. But before she sat down she did a touching thing. She\nrang the bell and called Minnie.\n\n\"After this, Minnie,\" she said, \"we will always set Doctor Richard's\nplace. Then, when he comes--\"\n\nHer voice broke and Minnie, scenting a tragedy but ignorant of it, went\nback to her kitchen to cry into the roller towel. Her world was gone to\npieces. By years of service to the one family she had no other world, no\nhome, no ties. She was with the Livingstones, but not one of them. Alone\nin her kitchen she felt lonely and cut off. She thought that David, had\nhe not been ill, would have told her.\n\nLucy found David moving about upstairs some time later, and when she\nwent up she found him sitting in Dick's room, on a stiff chair inside\nthe door. She stood beside him and put her hand on his shoulder, but he\ndid not say anything, and she went away.\n\nThat night David had a caller. All evening the bell had been ringing,\nand the little card tray on the hatrack was filled with visiting cards.\nThere were gifts, too, flowers and jellies and some squab from Mrs.\nSayre. Lucy had seen no one, excusing herself on the ground of fatigue,\nbut the man who came at nine o'clock was not inclined to be turned away.\n\n\"You take this card up to Doctor Livingstone, anyhow,\" he said. \"I'll\nwait.\"\n\nHe wrote in pencil on the card, placing it against the door post to do\nso, and passed it to Minnie. She calmly read it, and rather defiantly\ncarried it off. But she came down quickly, touched by some contagion of\nexpectation from the room upstairs.\n\n\"Hang your hat on the rack and go on up.\"\n\nSo it was that David and the reporter met, for the first time, in\nDavid's old fashioned chamber, with its walnut bed and the dresser with\nthe marble top, and Dick's picture in his uniform on the mantle.\n\nBassett was shocked at the sight of David, shocked and alarmed. He was\nuncertain at first as to the wisdom of telling his startling story to an\nobviously sick man, but David's first words reassured him.\n\n\"Come in,\" he said. \"You are the Bassett who was with Doctor Livingstone\nat Norada?\"\n\n\"Yes. I see you know about it.\"\n\n\"We know something, not everything.\" Suddenly David's pose deserted him.\nHe got up and stood very straight, searching eyes on his visitor. \"Is he\nliving?\" he asked, in a low voice.\n\n\"I think so. I'm not certain.\"\n\n\"Then you don't know where he is?\"\n\n\"No. He got away--but you know that. Sit down, doctor. I've got a long\nstory to tell.\"\n\n\"I'll get you to call my sister first,\" David said. \"And tell her to\nget Harrison Miller. Mr. Miller is our neighbor, and he very kindly went\nwest when my health did not permit me to go.\"\n\nWhile they waited David asked only one question.\n\n\"The report we have had is that he was in a stupor in the hotel, and the\ndoctor who saw him--you got him, I think--said he appeared to have been\ndrinking heavily. Is that true? He was not a drinking man.\"\n\n\"I am quite sure he had not.\"\n\nThere was another question in David's mind, but he did not put it. He\nsat, with the patience of his age and his new infirmity, waiting for\nLucy to bring Harrison Miller, and had it not been for the trembling of\nhis hands Bassett would have thought him calm and even placid.\n\nDuring the recital that followed somewhat later David did not move. He\nsat silent, his eyes closed, his face set.\n\n\"That's about all,\" Bassett finished. \"He had been perfectly clear in\nhis head all day, and it took headwork to get over the pass. But, as I\nsay, he had simply dropped ten years, and was back to the Lucas trouble.\nI tried everything I knew, used your name and would have used the young\nlady's, because sometimes that sort of thing strikes pretty deep, but\nI didn't know it. He was convinced after a while, but he was dazed, of\ncourse. He knew it, that is, but he couldn't comprehend it.\n\n\"I was done up, and I've cursed myself for it since, but I must have\nslept like the dead. I wakened once, early in the night, and he was\nstill sitting by the fire, staring at it. I've forgotten to say that he\nhad been determined all day to go back and give himself up, and the only\nway I prevented it was by telling him what a blow it would be to you and\nto the girl. I wakened once and said to him, 'Better get some sleep, old\nman.' He did not answer at once, and then he said, 'All right.' I was\ndozing off when he spoke again. He said, 'Where is Beverly Carlysle now?\nHas she married again?' 'She's revived \"The Valley,\" and she's in New\nYork with it,' I told him.\n\n\"When I wakened in the morning he was gone, but he'd left a piece of\npaper in a cleft stick beside me, with directions for reaching the\nrailroad, and--well, here it is.\"\n\nBassett took from his pocket-book a note, and passed it over to David,\nwho got out his spectacles with shaking hands and read it. It was on\nDick's prescription paper, with his name at the top and the familiar Rx\nbelow it. David read it aloud, his voice husky.\n\n\"Many thanks for everything, Bassett,\" he read. \"I don't like to leave\nyou, but you'll get out all right if you follow the map on the back\nof this. I've had all night to think things out, and I'm leaving you\nbecause you are safer without me. I realize now what you've known all\nday and kept from me. That woman at the hotel recognized me, and they\nare after me.\n\n\"I can't make up my mind what to do. Ultimately I think I'll go back and\ngive myself up. I am a dead man, anyhow, to all who might have cared,\nbut I've got to do one or two things first, and I want to think things\nover. One thing you've got a right to know. I hated Lucas, but it never\nentered my head to kill him. How it happened God only knows. I don't.\"\n\nIt was signed \"J. C.\"\n\nBassett broke the silence that followed the reading.\n\n\"I made every effort to find him. I had to work alone, you understand,\nand from the west side of the range, not to arouse suspicion. They were\nafter me, too, you know. His horse, I heard, worked its way back a few\ndays ago. It's a forsaken country, and if he lost his horse he was in it\non foot and without food. Of course there's a chance--\"\n\nHis voice trailed off. In the stillness David sat, touching with tender\ntremulous fingers what might be Dick's last message, and gazing at the\npicture of Dick in his uniform. He knew what they all thought, that Dick\nwas dead and that he held his final words in his hands, but his militant\nold spirit refused to accept that silent verdict. Dick might be dead\nto them, but he was living. He looked around the room defiantly,\nresentfully. Of all of them he was the only one to have faith, and he\nwas bound to a chair. He knew them. They would sit down supinely and\ngrieve, while time passed and Dick fought his battle alone.\n\nNo, by God, he would not be bound to a chair. He raised himself and\nstood, swaying on his shaking legs.\n\n\"You've given up,\" he said scornfully. \"You make a few days' search, and\nthen you quit. It's easy to say he's dead, and so you say he's dead. I'm\ngoing out there myself, and I'll make a search--\"\n\nHe collapsed into the chair again, and looked at them with shamed,\nappealing eyes. Bassett was the first to break the silence, speaking in\na carefully emotionless tone.\n\n\"I haven't given up for a minute. I've given up the search, because he's\nbeyond finding just now. Either he's got away, or he is--well, beyond\nhelp. We have to go on the hypothesis that he got away, and in that\ncase sooner or later you'll hear from him. He's bound to remember you in\ntime. The worst thing is this charge against him.\"\n\n\"He never killed Howard Lucas,\" David said, in a tone of conviction.\n\"Harrison, read Mr. Bassett my statement to you.\"\n\nBassett took the statement home with him that night, and studied it\ncarefully. It explained a great deal that had puzzled him before; Mrs.\nWasson's story and David's arrival at the mountain cabin. But most of\nall it explained why the Thorwald woman had sent him after Dick. She\nknew then, in spite of her protests to David, that Jud Clark had not\nkilled Lucas.\n\nHe paced the floor for an hour or two, sunk in thought, and then\nunlocked a desk drawer and took out his bankbook. He had saved a little\nmoney. Not much, but it would carry him over if he couldn't get another\nleave of absence. He thought, as he put the book away and prepared for\nbed, that it was a small price to pay for finding Clifton Hines and\nsaving his own soul.\n\n\n\n\nXXXIV\n\nDick had written his note, and placed it where Bassett would be certain\nto see it. Then he found his horse and led him for the first half mile\nor so of level ground before the trail began to descend. He mounted\nthere, for he knew the animal could find its way in the darkness where\nhe could not.\n\nHe felt no weariness and no hunger, although he had neither slept nor\neaten for thirty-odd hours, and as contrasted with the night before his\nhead was clear. He was able to start a train of thought and to follow it\nthrough consecutively for the first time in hours. Thought, however, was\neasier than realization, and to add to his perplexity, he struggled\nto place Bassett and failed entirely. He remained a mysterious and\nincomprehensible figure, beginning and ending with the trail.\n\nThen he had an odd thought, that brought him up standing. He had only\nBassett's word for the story. Perhaps Bassett was lying to him, or mad.\nHe rode on after a moment, considering that, but there was something,\nnot in Bassett's circumstantial narrative but in himself, that refused\nto accept that loophole of escape. He could not have told what it was.\n\nAnd, with his increasing clarity, he began to make out the case for\nBassett and against himself; the unfamiliar clothing he wore, the pad\nwith the name of Livingstone on it and the sign Rx, the other contents\nof his pockets.\n\nHe tried to orient himself in Bassett's story. A doctor. The devil's\nirony of it! Some poor hack, losing sleep and bringing babies. Peddling\npills. Leading what Bassett had called a life of usefulness! That was a\ncareer for you, a pill peddler. God!\n\nBut underlying all his surface thinking was still the need of flight,\nand he was continually confusing it with the earlier one. One moment he\nwas looking about for the snow of that earlier escape, and the next he\nwould remember, and the sense of panic would leave him. After all he\nmeant to surrender eventually. It did not matter if they caught him.\n\nBut, like the sense of flight, there was something else in his mind,\nsomething that he fought down and would not face. When it came up\nhe thrust it back fiercely. That something was the figure of Beverly\nCarlysle, stooping over her husband's body. He would have died to save\nher pain, and yet last night--no, it wasn't last night. It was years and\nyears ago, and all this time she had hated him.\n\nIt was unbearable that she had gone on hating him, all this time.\n\nHe was very thirsty, and water did not satisfy him. He wanted a real\ndrink. He wanted alcohol. Suddenly he wanted all the liquor in the\nworld. The craving came on at dawn, and after that he kicked his weary\nhorse on recklessly, so that it rocked and stumbled down the trail. He\nhad only one thought after the frenzy seized him, and that was to get to\ncivilization and whisky. It was as though he saw in drunkenness his only\nescape from the unbearable. In all probability he would have killed\nboth his horse and himself in the grip of that sudden madness, but\ndeliverance came in the shape of a casual rider, a stranger who for a\nmoment took up the shuttle, wove his bit of the pattern and passed\non, to use his blow-pipe, his spirit lamp and his chemicals in some\nprospector's paradise among the mountains.\n\nWhen Dick heard somewhere ahead the creaking of saddle leather and the\nrattle of harness he drew aside on the trail and waited. He had lost\nall caution in the grip of his craving, and all fear. A line of loaded\nburros rounded a point ahead and came toward him, picking their way\ndelicately with small deliberate feet and walking on the outer edge of\nthe trail, after the way of pack animals the world over. Behind them was\na horseman, rifle in the scabbard on his saddle and spurs jingling. Dick\nwatched him with thirsty, feverish eyes as he drew near. He could hardly\nwait to put his question.\n\n\"Happen to have a drink about you, partner?\" he called.\n\nThe man stopped his horse and grinned.\n\n\"Pretty early in the morning for a drink, isn't it?\" he inquired. Then\nhe saw Dick's eyes, and reached reluctantly into his saddle bag. \"I've\ngot a quart here,\" he said. \"I've traveled forty miles and spent nine\ndollars to get it, but I guess you need some.\"\n\n\"You wouldn't care to sell it, I suppose?\"\n\n\"The bottle? Not on your life.\"\n\nHe untied a tin cup from his saddle and carefully poured a fair amount\ninto it, steadying the horse the while.\n\n\"Here,\" he said, and passed it over. \"But you'd better cut it out after\nthis. It's bad medicine. You've got two good drinks there. Be careful.\"\n\nDick took the cup and looked at the liquor. The odor assailed him, and\nfor a queer moment he felt a sudden distaste for it. He had a revulsion\nthat almost shook him. But he drank it down and passed the cup back.\n\n\"You've traveled a long way for it,\" he said, \"and I needed it, I guess.\nIf you'll let me pay for it--\"\n\n\"Forget it,\" said the man amiably, and started his horse. \"But better\ncut it out, first chance you get. It's bad medicine.\"\n\nHe rode on after his vanishing pack, and Dick took up the trail again.\nBut before long he began to feel sick and dizzy. The aftertaste of the\nliquor in his mouth nauseated him. The craving had been mental habit,\nnot physical need, and his body fought the poison rebelliously. After\na time the sickness passed, and he slept in the saddle. He roused once,\nenough to know that the horse had left the trail and was grazing in a\ngreen meadow. Still overcome with his first real sleep he tumbled out\nof the saddle and stretched himself out on the ground. He slept all day,\nlying out in the burning sun, his face upturned to the sky.\n\nWhen he wakened it was twilight, and the horse had disappeared. His face\nburned from the sun, and his head ached violently. He was weak, too,\nfrom hunger, and the morning's dizziness persisted. Connected thought\nwas impossible, beyond the fact that if he did not get out soon, he\nwould be too weak to travel. Exhausted and on the verge of sunstroke, he\nset out on foot to find the trail.\n\nHe traveled all night, and the dawn found him still moving, a mere\nautomaton of a man, haggard and shambling, no longer willing his\nprogress, but somehow incredibly advancing. He found water and drank it,\nfell, got up, and still, right foot, left foot, he went on. Some\ntime during that advance he had found a trail, and he kept to it\nautomatically. He felt no surprise and no relief when he saw a cabin in\na clearing and a woman in the doorway, watching him with curious eyes.\nHe pulled himself together and made a final effort, but without much\ninterest in the result.\n\n\"I wonder if you could give me some food?\" he said. \"I have lost my\nhorse and I've been wandering all night.\"\n\n\"I guess I can,\" she replied, not unamiably. \"You look as though you\nneed it, and a wash, too. There's a basin and a pail of water on that\nbench.\"\n\nBut when she came out later to call him to breakfast she found him\nsitting on the bench and the pail overturned on the ground.\n\n\"I'm sorry,\" he said, dully, \"I tried to lift it, but I'm about all in.\"\n\n\"You'd better come in. I've made some coffee.\"\n\nHe could not rise. He could not even raise his hands.\n\nShe called her husband from where he was chopping wood off in the trees,\nand together they got him into the house. It was days before he so much\nas spoke again.\n\nSo it happened that the search went on. Wilkins from the east of the\nrange, and Bassett from the west, hunted at first with furious energy,\nthen spasmodically, then not at all, while Dick lay in a mountain cabin,\non the bed made of young trees, and for the second time in his life\nwatched a woman moving in a lean-to kitchen, and was fed by a woman's\nhand.\n\nHe forced himself to think of this small panorama of life that moved\nbefore him, rather than of himself. The woman was young, and pretty in a\nslovenly way. The man was much older, and silent. He was of better class\nthan the woman, and underlying his assumption of crudity there were\noccasional outcroppings of some cultural background. Not then, nor at\nany subsequent time, did he learn the story, if story there was. He\nbegan to see them, however, not so much pioneers as refugees. The cabin\nwas, he thought, a haven to the man and a prison to the woman.\n\nBut they were uniformly kind to him, and for weeks he stayed there,\nslowly readjusting. In his early convalescence he would sit paring\npotatoes or watching a cooking pot for her. As he gained in strength\nhe cut a little firewood. Always he sought something to keep him from\nthinking.\n\nTwo incidents always stood out afterwards in his memory of the cabin.\nOne was the first time he saw himself in a mirror. He knew by that time\nthat Bassett's story had been true, and that he was ten years older than\nhe remembered himself to be. He thought he was in a measure prepared.\nBut he saw in the glass a man whose face was lined and whose hair was\nstreaked with gray. The fact that his beard had grown added to the\nterrible maturity of the reflection he saw, and he sent the mirror\nclattering to the ground.\n\nThe other incident was later, and when he was fairly strong again. The\nman was caught under a tree he was felling, and badly hurt. During the\nhour or so that followed, getting the tree cut away, and moving the\ninjured man to the cabin on a wood sledge, Dick had the feeling of\nhelplessness of any layman in an accident. He was solicitous but clumsy.\nBut when they had got the patient into his bed, quite automatically he\nfound himself making an investigation and pronouncing a verdict.\n\nLater he was to realize that this was the first peak of submerged\nmemory, rising above the flood. At the time all he felt was a great\ncertainty. He must act quickly or the man would not live. And that\nnight, with such instruments as he could extemporize, he operated. There\nwas no time to send to a town.\n\nAll night, after the operation, Dick watched by the bedside, the woman\nmoving back and forth restlessly. He got his only knowledge of the\nstory, such as it was, then when she said once:\n\n\"I deserved this, but he didn't. I took him away from his wife.\"\n\nHe had to stay on after that, for the woman could not be left alone. And\nhe was glad of the respite, willing to drift until he got his bearings.\nCertain things had come back, more as pictures than realities. Thus\nhe saw David clearly, Lucy dimly, Elizabeth not at all. But David came\nfirst; David in the buggy with the sagging springs, David's loud voice\nand portly figure, David, steady and upright and gentle as a woman. But\nthere was something wrong about David. He puzzled over that, but he was\nlearning not to try to force things, to let them come to the surface\nthemselves.\n\nIt was two or three days later that he remembered that David was ill,\nand was filled with a sickening remorse and anxiety. For the first time\nhe made plans to get away, for whatever happened after that he knew he\nmust see David again. But all his thought led him to an impasse at that\ntime, and that impasse was the feeling that he was a criminal and a\nfugitive, and that he had no right to tie up innocent lives with his.\nEven a letter to David might incriminate him.\n\nCoupled with his determination to surrender, the idea of atonement was\nstrong in him. An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth. That had been\nhis father's belief, and well he remembered it. But during the drifting\nperiod he thrust it back, into that painful niche where he held Beverly,\nand the thing he would not face.\n\nThat phase of his readjustment, then, when he reached it, was painful\nand confused. There was the necessity for atonement, which involved\nsurrender, and there was the call of David, and the insistent desire to\nsee Beverly again, which was the thing he would not face. Of the three,\nthe last, mixed up as it was with the murder and its expiation, was the\nstrongest. For by the very freshness of his released memories, it was\nthe days before his flight from the ranch that seemed most recent, and\nhis life with David that was long ago, and blurred in its details as by\nthe passing of infinite time.\n\nWhen Elizabeth finally came back to him it was as something very gentle\nand remote, out of the long-forgotten past. Even his image of her\nwas blurred and shadowy. He could not hear the tones of her voice, or\nremember anything she had said. He could never bring her at will, as\nhe could David, for instance. She only came clearly at night, while he\nslept. Then the guard was down, and there crept into his dreams a small\nfigure, infinitely loving and tender; but as he roused from sleep she\nchanged gradually into Beverly. It was Beverly's arms he felt around his\nneck. Nevertheless he held to Elizabeth more completely than he knew,\nfor the one thing that emerged from his misty recollection of her was\nthat she cared for him. In a world of hate and bitterness she cared.\n\nBut she was never real to him, as the other woman was real. And he knew\nthat she was lost to him, as David was lost. He could never go back to\neither of them.\n\nAs time went on he reached the point of making practical plans. He had\nlost his pocketbook somewhere, probably during his wanderings afoot,\nand he had no money. He knew that the obvious course was to go to the\nnearest settlement and surrender himself and he played with the thought,\nbut even as he did so he knew that he would not do it. Surrender he\nwould, eventually, but before he did that he would satisfy a craving\nthat was in some ways like his desire for liquor that morning on the\ntrail. A reckless, mad, and irresistible impulse to see Beverly Lucas\nagain.\n\nIn August he started for the railroad, going on foot and without money,\nhis immediate destination the harvest fields of some distant ranch, his\nobject to earn his train fare to New York.\n\n\n\n\nXXXV\n\nThe summer passed slowly. To David and Elizabeth it was a long waiting,\nbut with this difference, that David was kept alive by hope, and that\nElizabeth felt sometimes that hope was killing her. To David each day\nwas a new day, and might hold Dick. To Elizabeth, after a time, each day\nwas but one more of separation.\n\nDoctor Reynolds had become a fixture in the old house, but he was not\nlike Dick. He was a heavy, silent young man, shy of intruding into the\nfamily life and already engrossed in a budding affair with the Rossiter\ngirl. David tolerated him, but with a sort of smouldering jealousy\nincreased by the fact that he had introduced innovations David resented;\nhad for instance moved Dick's desk nearer the window, and instead of\ndoing his own laboratory work had what David considered a damnably lazy\nfashion of sending his little tubes, carefully closed with cotton, to a\nhospital in town.\n\nDavid found the days very long and infinitely sad. He wakened each\nmorning to renewed hope, watched for the postman from his upper window,\nand for Lucy's step on the stairs with the mail. His first glimpse\nof her always told him the story. At the beginning he had insisted on\ntalking about Dick, but he saw that it hurt her, and of late they had\nfallen into the habit of long silences.\n\nThe determination to live on until that return which he never ceased\nto expect only carried him so far, however. He felt no incentive to\nactivity. There were times when he tried Lucy sorely, when she felt\nthat if he would only move about, go downstairs and attend to his office\npractice, get out into the sun and air, he would grow stronger. But\nthere were times, too, when she felt that only the will to live was\ncarrying him on.\n\nNothing further had developed, so far as they knew. The search had been\nabandoned. Lucy was no longer so sure as she had been that the house was\nunder surveillance, against Dick's possible return. Often she lay in\nher bed and faced the conviction that Dick was dead. She had never\nunderstood the talk that at first had gone on about her, when Bassett\nand Harrison Miller, and once or twice the psycho-analyst David had\nconsulted in town, had got together in David's bedroom. The mind was the\nmind, and Dick was Dick. This thing about habit, over which David pored\nat night when he should have been sleeping, or brought her in to listen\nto, with an air of triumphant vindication, meant nothing to her.\n\nA man properly trained in right habits of thinking and of action could\nnot think wrong and go wrong, David argued. He even went further. He\nsaid that love was a habit, and that love would bring Dick back to him.\nThat he could not forget them.\n\nShe believed that, of course, if he still lived. But hadn't Mr. Bassett,\nwho seemed so curiously mixed in the affair, been out again to Norada\nwithout result? No, it was all over, and she felt that it would be a\ncomfort to know where he lay, and to bring him back to some well-loved\nand tended grave.\n\nElizabeth came often to see them. She looked much the same as ever,\nalthough she was very slender and her smile rather strained, and she\nand David would have long talks together. She always felt rather like an\nempty vessel when she went in, but David filled her with hope and sent\nher away cheered and visibly brighter to her long waiting. She rather\navoided Lucy, for Lucy's fears lay in her face and were like a shadow\nover her spirit. She came across her one day putting Dick's clothing\naway in camphor, and the act took on an air of finality that almost\ncrushed her.\n\nSo far they had kept from her Dick's real identity, but certain things\nthey had told her. She knew that he had gone back, in some strange way,\nto the years before he came to Haverly, and that he had temporarily\nforgotten everything since. But they had told her too, and seemed to\nbelieve themselves, that it was only temporary.\n\nAt first the thought had been more than she could bear. But she had to\nlive her life, and in such a way as to hide her fears. Perhaps it was\ngood for her, the necessity of putting up a bold front, to join the\nconspiracy that was to hold Dick's place in the world against the hope\nof his return. And she still went to the Sayre house, sure that there\nat least there would be no curious glances, no too casual questions.\nShe could not be sure of that even at home, for Nina was constantly\nconjecturing.\n\n\"I sometimes wonder-\" Nina began one day, and stopped.\n\n\"Wonder what?\"\n\n\"Oh, well, I suppose I might as well go on. Do you ever think that if\nDick had gone back, as they say he has, that there might be somebody\nelse?\"\n\n\"Another girl, you mean?\"\n\n\"Yes. Some one he knew before.\"\n\nNina was watching her. Sometimes she almost burst with the drama she\nwas suppressing. She had been a small girl when Judson Clark had\ndisappeared, but even at twelve she had known something of the story.\nShe wanted frantically to go about the village and say to them: \"Do you\nknow who has been living here, whom you used to patronize? Judson Clark,\none of the richest men in the world!\" She built day dreams on that\nfoundation. He would come back, for of course he would be found and\nacquitted, and buy the Sayre place perhaps, or build a much larger one,\nand they would all go to Europe in his yacht. But she knew now that the\nwoman Leslie had sent his flowers to had loomed large in Dick's past,\nand she both hated and feared her. Not content with having given her,\nNina, some bad hours, she saw the woman now possibly blocking her\nambitions for Elizabeth.\n\n\"What I'm getting at is this,\" she said, examining her polished nails\ncritically. \"If it does turn out that there was somebody, you'd have to\nremember that it was all years and years ago, and be sensible.\"\n\n\"I only want him back,\" Elizabeth said. \"I don't care how he comes, so\nhe comes.\"\n\nLouis Bassett had become a familiar figure in the village life by that\ntime. David depended on him with a sort of wistful confidence that\nset him to grinding his teeth occasionally in a fury at his own\nhelplessness. And, as the extent of the disaster developed, as he saw\nDavid failing and Lucy ageing, and when in time he met Elizabeth, the\nfeeling of his own guilt was intensified.\n\nHe spent hours studying the case, and he was chiefly instrumental in\nsending Harrison Miller back to Norada in September. He had struck up a\nfriendship with Miller over their common cause, and the night he was to\ndepart that small inner group which was fighting David's battle for\nhim formed a board of strategy in Harrison's tidy living-room; Walter\nWheeler and Bassett, Miller and, tardily taken into their confidence,\nDoctor Reynolds.\n\nThe same group met him on his return, sat around with expectant faces\nwhile he got out his tobacco and laid a sheaf of papers on the table,\nand waited while their envoy, laying Bassett's map on the table,\nproceeded carefully to draw in a continuation of the trail beyond the\npass, some sketchy mountains, and a small square.\n\n\"I've got something,\" he said at last. \"Not much, but enough to work\non. Here's where you lost him, Bassett.\" He pointed with his pencil.\n\"He went on for a while on the horse. Then somehow he must have lost the\nhorse, for he turned up on foot, date unknown, in a state of exhaustion\nat a cabin that lies here. I got lost myself, or I'd never have found\nthe place. He was sick there for weeks, and he seems to have stayed on\nquite a while after he recovered, as though he couldn't decide what to\ndo next.\"\n\nWalter Wheeler stirred and looked up.\n\n\"What sort of condition was he in when he left?\"\n\n\"Very good, they said.\"\n\n\"You're sure it was Livingstone?\"\n\n\"The man there had a tree fall on him. He operated. I guess that's the\nanswer.\"\n\nHe considered the situation.\n\n\"It's the answer to more than that,\" Reynolds said slowly. \"It shows he\nhad come back to himself. If he hadn't he couldn't have done it.\"\n\n\"And after that?\" some one asked.\n\n\"I lost him. He left to hike to the railroad, and he said nothing of his\nplans. If I'd been able to make open inquiries I might have turned\nup something, but I couldn't. It's a hard proposition. I had trouble\nfinding Hattie Thorwald, too. She'd left the hotel, and is living with\nher son. She swears she doesn't know where Clifton Hines is, and hasn't\nseen him for years.\"\n\nBassett had been listening intently, his head dropped forward.\n\n\"I suppose the son doesn't know about Hines?\"\n\n\"No. She warned me. He was surly and suspicious. The sheriff had sent\nfor him and questioned him about how you got his horse, and I gathered\nthat he thought I was a detective. When I told him I was a friend of\nyours, he sent you a message. You may be able to make something out of\nit. I can't. He said: `You can tell him I didn't say anything about the\nother time.'\"\n\nBassett sat forward.\n\n\"The other time?\"\n\n\"He is under the impression that his mother got the horse for you once\nbefore, about ten days before Clark escaped. At night, also.\"\n\n\"Not for me,\" Bassett said decisively. \"Ten days before that I was--\" he\ngot out his notebook and consulted it. \"I was on my way to the cabin\nin the mountains, where the Donaldsons had hidden Jud Clark. I hired a\nhorse at a livery stable.\"\n\n\"Could the Thorwald woman have followed you?\"\n\n\"Why the devil should she do that?\" he asked irritably. \"She didn't know\nwho I was. She hadn't a chance at my papers, for I kept them on me. If\nshe did suspect I was on the case, a dozen fellows had preceded me, and\nhalf of them had gone to the cabin.\"\n\n\"Nevertheless,\" he finished, \"I believe she did. She or Hines himself.\nThere was some one on a horse outside the cabin that night.\"\n\nThere was silence in the room, Harrison Miller thoughtfully drawing at\nrandom on the map before him. Each man was seeing the situation from his\nown angle; to Reynolds, its medical interest, and the possibility of\nhis permanency in the town; to Walter Wheeler, Elizabeth's spoiled young\nlife; to Harrison Miller, David; and to the reporter a conviction that\nthe clues he now held should lead him somewhere, and did not.\n\nBefore the meeting broke up Miller took a folded manuscript from the\ntable and passed it to Bassett.\n\n\"Copy of the Coroner's inquiry, after the murder,\" he said. \"Thought it\nmight interest you...\"\n\nThen, for a time, that was all. Bassett, poring at home over the inquest\nrecords, and finding them of engrossing interest, saw the futility of\nsaving a man who could not be found. And even Nina's faith, that the\nfabulously rich could not die obscurely, began to fade as the summer\nwaned. She restored some of her favor to Wallie Sayre, and even listened\nagain to his alternating hopes and fears.\n\nAnd by the end of September he felt that he had gained real headway with\nElizabeth. He had come to a point where she needed him more than she\nrealized, where the call in her of youth for youth, even in trouble, was\ninsistent. In return he felt his responsibility and responded to it. In\nthe vernacular of the town he had \"settled down,\" and the general trend\nof opinion, which had previously disapproved him, was now that Elizabeth\nmight do worse.\n\nOn a crisp night early in October he had brought her home from Nina's,\nand because the moon was full they sat for a time on the steps of the\nveranda, Wallie below her, stirring the dead leaves on the walk with his\nstick, and looking up at her with boyish adoring eyes when she spoke.\nHe was never very articulate with her, and her trouble had given her a\nstrange new aloofness that almost frightened him. But that night, when\nshe shivered a little, he reached up and touched her hand.\n\n\"You're cold,\" he said almost roughly. He was sometimes rather savage,\nfor fear he might be tender.\n\n\"I'm not cold. I think it's the dead leaves.\"\n\n\"Dead leaves?\" he repeated, puzzled. \"You're a queer girl, Elizabeth.\nWhy dead leaves?\"\n\n\"I hate the fall. It's the death of the year.\"\n\n\"Nonsense. It's going to bed for a long winter's nap. That's all. I'll\nbring you a wrap.\"\n\nHe went in, and came out in a moment with her father's overcoat.\n\n\"Here,\" he said peremptorily, \"put this on. I'm not going to be called\non the carpet for giving you a sniffle.\"\n\nShe stood up obediently and he put the big coat around her. Then,\nobeying an irresistible impulse, he caught her to him. He released her\nimmediately, however, and stepped back.\n\n\"I love you so,\" he stammered. \"I'm sorry. I'll not do it again.\"\n\nShe was startled, but not angry.\n\n\"I don't like it,\" was all she said. And because she did not want him to\nthink she was angry, she sat down again. But the boy was shaken. He got\nout a cigarette and lighted it, his hands trembling. He could not think\nof anything to say. It was as though by that one act he had cut a bridge\nbehind him and on the other side lay all the platitudes, the small give\nand take of their hours together. What to her was a regrettable incident\nwas to him a great dramatic climax. Boylike, he refused to recognize its\nunimportance to her. He wanted to talk about it.\n\n\"When you said just now that you didn't like what I did just then, do\nyou mean you didn't like me to do it? Or that you don't care for that\nsort of thing? Of course I know,\" he added hastily, \"you're not that\nkind of girl. I--\"\n\nHe turned and looked at her.\n\n\"You know I'm still in love with you, don't you, Elizabeth?\"\n\nShe returned his gaze frankly.\n\n\"I don't see how you can be when you know what you do know.\"\n\n\"I know how you feel now. But I know that people don't go on loving\nhopelessly all their lives. You're young. You've got\"--he figured\nquickly--\"you've got about fifty-odd years to live yet, and some of\nthese days you'll be--not forgetting,\" he changed, when he saw her quick\nmovement. \"I know you'll not forget him. But remembering and loving are\ndifferent.\"\n\n\"I wonder,\" she said, her eyes on the moon, and full of young tragedy.\n\"If they are, if one can remember without loving, then couldn't one love\nwithout remembering?\"\n\nHe stared at her.\n\n\"You're too deep for me sometimes,\" he said. \"I'm not subtle, Elizabeth.\nI daresay I'm stupid in lots of things. But I'm not stupid about this.\nI'm not trying to get a promise, you know. I only want you to know how\nthings are. I don't want to know why he went away, or why he doesn't\ncome back. I only want you to face the facts. I'd be good to you,\" he\nfinished, in a low tone. \"I'd spend my life thinking of ways to make you\nhappy.\"\n\nShe was touched. She reached down and put her hand on his shoulder.\n\n\"You deserve the best, Wallie. And you're asking for a second best. Even\nthat--I'm just not made that way, I suppose. Fifty years or a hundred,\nit would be all the same.\"\n\n\"You'd always care for him, you mean?\"\n\n\"Yes. I'm afraid so.\"\n\nWhen he looked at her her eyes had again that faraway and yet flaming\nlook which he had come to associate with her thoughts of Dick. She\nseemed infinitely removed from him, traveling her lonely road past\nloving outstretched hands and facing ahead toward--well, toward fifty\nyears of spinsterhood. The sheer waste of it made him shudder.\n\n\"You're cold, too, Wallie,\" she said gently. \"You'd better go home.\"\n\nHe was about to repudiate the idea scornfully, when he sneezed! She got\nup at once and held out her hand.\n\n\"You are very dear to feel about me the way you do\" she said, rather\nrapidly. \"I appreciate your telling me. And if you're chilly when you\nget home, you'd better take some camphor.\"\n\nHe saw her in, hat in hand, and then turned and stalked up the street.\nCamphor, indeed! But so stubborn was hope in his young heart that before\nhe had climbed the hill he was finding comfort in her thought for him.\n\nMrs. Sayre had been away for a week, visiting in Michigan, and he had\nnot expected her for a day or so. To his surprise he found her on the\nterrace, wrapped in furs, and evidently waiting for him.\n\n\"I wasn't enjoying it,\" she explained, when he had kissed her. \"It's\na summer place, not heated to amount to anything, and when it turned\ncold--where have you been to-night?\"\n\n\"Dined at the Wards', and then took Elizabeth home.\"\n\n\"How is she?\"\n\n\"She's all right.\"\n\n\"And there's no news?\"\n\nHe knew her very well, and he saw then that she was laboring under\nsuppressed excitement.\n\n\"What's the matter, mother? You're worried about something, aren't you?\"\n\n\"I have something to tell you. We'd better go inside.\" He followed her\nin, unexcited and half smiling. Her world was a small one, of minor\ndomestic difficulties, of not unfriendly gossip, of occasional money\nproblems, investments and what not. He had seen her hands tremble over a\nmatter of a poorly served dinner. So he went into the house, closed the\nterrace window and followed her to the library. When she closed the door\nhe recognized her old tactics when the servants were in question.\n\n\"Well?\" he inquired. \"I suppose--\" Then he saw her face. \"Sorry, mother.\nWhat's the trouble?\"\n\n\"Wallie, I saw Dick Livingstone in Chicago.\"\n\n\n\n\nXXXVI\n\nDuring August Dick had labored in the alfalfa fields of Central\nWashington, a harvest hand or \"working stiff\" among other migratory\nagricultural workers. Among them, but not entirely of them. Recruited\nfrom the lowest levels as men grade, gathered in at a slave market on\nthe coast, herded in bunk houses alive with vermin, fully but badly fed,\noverflowing with blasphemy and filled with sullen hate for those above\nthem in the social scale, the \"stiffs\" regarded him with distrust from\nthe start.\n\nIn the beginning he accepted their sneers with a degree of philosophy.\nHis physical condition was poor. At night he ached intolerably,\ncollapsing into his wooden bunk to sleep the dreamless sleep of utter\nexhaustion. There were times when he felt that it would be better\nto return at once to Norada and surrender, for that he must do so\neventually he never doubted. It was as well perhaps that he had no time\nfor brooding, but he gained sleep at the cost of superhuman exertion all\nday.\n\nA feeling of unreality began to obsess him, so that at times he felt\nlike a ghost walking among sweating men, like a resurrection into life,\nbut without life. And more than once he tried to sink down to the level\nof the others, to unite himself again with the crowd, to feel again the\ntouch of elbows, the sensation of fellowship. The primal instinct of the\nherd asserted itself, the need of human companionship of any sort.\n\nBut he failed miserably, as Jud Clark could never have failed. He could\nnot drink with them. He could not sink to their level of degradation.\nTheir oaths and obscenity sickened and disgusted him, and their talk of\nwomen drove him into the fresh air.\n\nThe fact that he could no longer drink himself into a stupor puzzled\nhim. Bad whiskey circulated freely among the hay stacks and bunk houses\nwhere the harvest hands were quartered, and at ruinous prices. The men\nclubbed together to buy it, and he put in his share, only to find that\nit not only sickened him, but that he had a mental inhibition against\nit.\n\nThey called him the \"Dude,\" and put into it gradually all the class\nhatred of their wretched sullen lives. He had to fight them, more than\nonce, and had they united against him he might have been killed. But\nthey never united. Their own personal animosities and angers kept them\napart, as their misery held them together. And as time went on and his\nmuscles hardened he was able to give a better account of himself. The\ntime came when they let him alone, and when one day a big shocker fell\noff a stack and broke his leg and Dick set it, he gained their respect.\nThey asked no questions, for their law was that the past was the past.\nThey did not like him, but in the queer twisted ethics of the camp they\njudged the secret behind him by the height from which he had fallen, and\nbegan slowly to accept him as of the brotherhood of derelicts.\n\nWith his improvement in his physical condition there came, toward the\nend of the summer, a more rapid subsidence of the flood of the long\npast. He had slept out one night in the fields, where the uncut alfalfa\nwas belled with purple flowers and yellow buttercups rose and nodded\nabove him. With the first touch of dawn on the mountains he wakened to a\nclarity of mind like that of the morning. He felt almost an exaltation.\nHe stood up and threw out his arms.\n\nIt was all his again, never to lose, the old house, and David and Lucy;\nthe little laboratory; the church on Sunday mornings. Mike, whistling\nin the stable. A wave of love warmed him, a great surging tenderness. He\nwould go back to them. They were his and he was theirs. It was at first\nonly a great emotion; a tingling joyousness, a vast relief, as of one\nwho sees, from a far distance, the lights in the windows of home. Save\nfor the gap between the drunken revel at the ranch and his awakening to\nDavid's face bending over him in the cabin, everything was clear. Still\nby an effort, but successfully, he could unite now the two portions of\nhis life with only a scar between them.\n\nNot that he formulated it. It was rather a mood, an impulse of\nunreasoning happiness. The last cloud had gone, the last bit of mist\nfrom the valley. He saw Haverly, and the children who played in its\nshaded streets; Mike washing the old car, and the ice cream freezer on\nSundays, wrapped in sacking on the kitchen porch. Jim Wheeler came back\nto him, the weight of his coffin dragging at his right hand as he helped\nto carry it; he was kneeling beside Elizabeth's bed, and putting his\nhand over her staring eyes so she would go to sleep.\n\nThe glow died away, and he began to suffer intensely. They were all lost\nto him, along with the life they represented. And already he began to\nlook back on his period of forgetfulness with regret. At least then he\nhad not known what he had lost.\n\nHe wondered again what they knew. What did they think? If they believed\nhim dead, was that not kinder than the truth? Outside of David and Lucy,\nand of course Bassett, the sole foundation on which any search for him\nhad rested had been the semi-hysterical recognition of Hattie Thorwald.\nBut he wondered how far that search had gone.\n\nHad it extended far enough to involve David? Had the hue and cry died\naway, or were the police still searching for him? Could he even write\nto David, without involving him in his own trouble? For David, fine,\nwonderful old David--David had deliberately obstructed the course of\njustice, and was an accessory after the fact.\n\nUp to that time he had drifted, unable to set a course in the fog, but\nnow he could see the way, and it led him back to Norada. He would not\ncommunicate with David. He would go out of the lives at the old house as\nhe had gone in, under a lie. When he surrendered it would be as Judson\nClark, with his lips shut tight on the years since his escape. Let them\nthink, if they would, that the curtain that had closed down over his\nmemory had not lifted, and that he had picked up life again where he\nhad laid it down. The police would get nothing from him to incriminate\nDavid.\n\nBut he had a moment, too, when surrender seemed to him not strength but\nweakness; where its sheer supineness, its easy solution to his problem\nrevolted him, where he clenched his fist and looked at it, and longed\nfor the right to fight his way out.\n\nWhen smoke began to issue from the cook-house chimney he stirred, rose\nand went back. He ate no breakfast, and the men, seeing his squared jaw\nand set face, let him alone. He worked with the strength of three men\nthat day, but that night, when the foreman offered him a job as pacer,\nwith double wages, he refused it.\n\n\"Give it to somebody else, Joe,\" he said. \"I'm quitting.\"\n\n\"The hell you are! When?\"\n\n\"I'd like to check out to-night.\"\n\nHis going was without comment. They had never fully accepted him, and\ncomings and goings without notice in the camp were common. He rolled up\nhis bedding, his change of under-garments inside it, and took the road\nthat night.\n\nThe railroad was ten miles away, and he made the distance easily. He\nwalked between wire fences, behind which horses moved restlessly as he\npassed and cattle slept around a water hole, and as he walked he faced a\nsituation which all day he had labored like three men to evade.\n\nHe was going out of life. It did not much matter whether it was to be\nbehind bars or to pay the ultimate price. The shadow that lay over him\nwas that he was leaving forever David and all that he stood for, and a\nwoman. And the woman was not Elizabeth.\n\nHe cursed himself in the dark for a fool and a madman; he cursed the\ninfatuation which rose like a demoniac possession from his early life.\nWhen that failed he tried to kill it by remembering the passage of time,\nthe loathing she must have nursed all these years. He summoned the image\nof Elizabeth to his aid, to find it eclipsed by something infinitely\nmore real and vital. Beverly in her dressing-room, grotesque and yet\nlovely in her make-up; Beverly on the mountain-trail, in her boyish\nriding clothes. Beverly.\n\nProbably at that stage of his recovery his mind had reacted more quickly\nthan his emotions. And by that strange faculty by which an idea often\nbecomes stronger in memory than in its original production he found\nhimself in the grip of a passion infinitely more terrible than his\nearlier one for her. It wiped out the memory, even the thought, of\nElizabeth, and left him a victim of its associated emotions. Bitter\njealousy racked him, remorse and profound grief. The ten miles of road\nto the railroad became ten miles of torture, of increasing domination of\nthe impulse to go to her, and of final surrender.\n\nIn Spokane he outfitted himself, for his clothes were ragged, and with\nthe remainder of his money bought a ticket to Chicago. Beyond Chicago he\nhad no thought save one. Some way, somehow, he must get to New York.\nYet all the time he was fighting. He tried again and again to break\naway from the emotional associations from which his memory of her was\nerected; when that failed he struggled to face reality; the lapse of\ntime, the certainty of his disappointment, at the best the inevitable\nparting when he went back to Norada. But always in the end he found his\nface turned toward the East, and her.\n\nHe had no fear of starving. If he had learned the cost of a dollar in\nblood and muscle, he had the blood and the muscle. There was a time, in\nChicago, when the necessity of thinking about money irritated him, for\nthe memory of his old opulent days was very clear. Times when his temper\nwas uncertain, and he turned surly. Times when his helplessness brought\nto his lips the old familiar blasphemies of his youth, which sounded\nstrange and revolting to his ears.\n\nHe had no fear, then, but a great impatience, as though, having lost\nso much time, he must advance with every minute. And Chicago drove him\nfrantic. There came a time there when he made a deliberate attempt\nto sink to the very depths, to seek forgetfulness by burying one\nwretchedness under another. He attempted to find work and failed, and he\ntried to let go and sink. The total result of the experiment was that\nhe wakened one morning in his lodging-house ill and with his money gone,\nsave for some small silver. He thought ironically, lying on his untidy\nbed, that even the resources of the depths were closed to him.\n\nHe never tried that experiment again. He hated himself for it.\n\nFor days he haunted the West Madison Street employment agencies. But the\nagencies and sidewalks were filled with men who wandered aimlessly\nwith the objectless shuffle of the unemployed. Beds had gone up in the\nlodging-houses to thirty-five cents a night, and the food in the cheap\nrestaurants was almost uneatable. There came a day when the free morning\ncoffee at a Bible Rescue Home, and its soup and potatoes and carrots at\nnight was all he ate.\n\nFor the first time his courage began to fail him. He went to the\nlakeside that night and stood looking at the water. He meant to fight\nthat impulse of cowardice at the source.\n\nUp to that time he had given no thought whatever to his estate, beyond\nthe fact that he had been undoubtedly adjudged legally dead and his\nproperty divided. But that day as he turned away from the lake front, he\nbegan to wonder about it. After all, since he meant to surrender himself\nbefore long, why not telegraph collect to the old offices of the estate\nin New York and have them wire him money? But even granting that they\nwere still in existence, he knew with what lengthy caution, following\nstunned surprise, they would go about investigating the message. And\nthere were leaks in the telegraph. He would have a pack of newspaper\nhounds at his heels within a few hours. The police, too. No, it wouldn't\ndo.\n\nThe next day he got a job as a taxicab driver, and that night and every\nnight thereafter he went back to West Madison Street and picked up one\nor more of the derelicts there and bought them food. He developed\nquite a system about it. He waited until he saw a man stop outside an\neating-house look in and then pass on. But one night he got rather\na shock. For the young fellow he accosted looked at him first with\nsuspicion, which was not unusual, and later with amazement.\n\n\"Captain Livingstone!\" he said, and checked his hand as it was about to\nrise to the salute. His face broke into a smile, and he whipped off his\ncap. \"You've forgotten me, sir,\" he said. \"But I've got your visiting\ncard on the top of my head all right. Can you see it?\"\n\nHe bent his head and waited, but on no immediate reply being\nforthcoming, for Dick was hastily determining on a course of action, he\nlooked up. It was then that he saw Dick's cheap and shabby clothes, and\nhis grin faded.\n\n\"I say,\" he said. \"You are Livingstone, aren't you? I'd have known--\"\n\n\"I think you've made a mistake, old man,\" Dick said, feeling for his\nwords carefully. \"That's not my name, anyhow. I thought, when I saw you\nstaring in at that window--How about it?\"\n\nThe boy looked at him again, and then glanced away.\n\n\"I was looking, all right,\" he said. \"I've been having a run of hard\nluck.\"\n\nIt had been Dick's custom to eat with his finds, and thus remove from\nthe meal the quality of detached charity. Men who would not take money\nwould join him in a meal. But he could not face the lights with this\nkeen-eyed youngster. He offered him money instead.\n\n\"Just a lift,\" he said, awkwardly, when the boy hesitated. \"I've been\nthere myself, lately.\"\n\nBut when at last he had prevailed and turned away he was conscious that\nthe doughboy was staring after him, puzzled and unconvinced.\n\nHe had a bad night after that. The encounter had brought back his\nhard-working, care-free days in the army. It had brought back, too,\nthe things he had put behind him, his profession and his joy in it, the\nstruggles and the aspirations that constitute a man's life. With them\nthere came, too, a more real Elizabeth, and a wave of tenderness for\nher, and of regret. He turned on his sagging bed, and deliberately put\nher away from him. Even if this other ghost were laid, he had no right\nto her.\n\nThen, one day, he met Mrs. Sayre, and saw that she knew him.\n\n\n\n\nXXXVII\n\nWallie stared at his mother. His mind was at once protesting the\nfact and accepting it, with its consequences to himself. There was\na perceptible pause before he spoke. He stood, if anything, somewhat\nstraighter, but that was all.\n\n\"Are you sure it was Livingstone?\"\n\n\"Positive. I talked to him. I wasn't sure myself, at first. He looked\nshabby and thin, as though he'd been ill, and he had the audacity to\npretend at first he didn't know me. He closed the door on me and--\"\n\n\"Wait a minute, mother. What door?\"\n\n\"He was driving a taxicab.\"\n\nHe looked at her incredulously.\n\n\"I don't believe it,\" he said slowly. \"I think you've made a mistake,\nthat's all.\"\n\n\"Nonsense. I know him as well as I know you.\"\n\n\"Did he acknowledge his identity?\"\n\n\"Not in so many words,\" she admitted. \"He said I had made a mistake, and\nhe stuck to it. Then he shut the door and drove me to the station. The\nonly other chance I had was at the station, and there was a line of\ncabs behind us, so I had only a second. I saw he didn't intend to admit\nanything, so I said: 'I can see you don't mean to recognize me, Doctor\nLivingstone, but I must know whether I am to say at home that I've seen\nyou.' He was making change for me at the time--I'd have known his hands,\nI think, if I hadn't seen anything else-and when he looked up his face\nwas shocking. He said, 'Are they all right?' 'David is very ill,' I\nsaid. The cars behind were waiting and making a terrific din, and a\ntraffic man ran up then and made him move on. He gave me the strangest\nlook as he went. I stood and waited, thinking he would turn and come\nback again at the end of the line, but he didn't. I almost missed my\ntrain.\"\n\nWallie's first reaction to the news was one of burning anger and\ncondemnation.\n\n\"The blackguard!\" he said. \"The insufferable cad! To have run away as\nhe did, and then to let them believe him dead! For that's what they do\nbelieve. It is killing David Livingstone, and as for Elizabeth--She'll\nhave to be told, mother. He's alive. He's well. And he has deliberately\ndeserted them all. He ought to be shot.\"\n\n\"You didn't see him, Wallie. I did. He's been through something, I don't\nknow what. I didn't sleep last night for thinking of his face. It had\ndespair in it.\"\n\n\"All right,\" he said, angrily pausing before her. \"What do you intend to\ndo? Let them go on as they are, hoping and waiting; lauding him to the\nskies as a sort of superman? The thing to do is to tell the truth.\"\n\n\"But we don't know the truth, Wallie. There's something behind it all.\"\n\n\"Nothing very creditable, be sure of that,\" he pronounced. \"Do you think\nit is fair to Elizabeth to let her waste her life on the memory of a man\nwho's deserted her?\"\n\n\"It would be cruel to tell her.\"\n\n\"You've got to be cruel to be kind, sometimes,\" he said oracularly.\n\"Why, the man may be married. May be anything. A taxi driver! Doesn't\nthat in itself show that he's hiding from something?\"\n\nShe sat, a small obese figure made larger by her furs, and stared at him\nwith troubled eyes.\n\n\"I don't know, Wallie,\" she said helplessly. \"In a way, it might be\nbetter to tell her. She could put him out of her mind, then. But I hate\nto do it. It's like stabbing a baby.\"\n\nHe understood her, and nodded. When, after taking a turn or two about\nthe room he again stopped in front of her his angry flush had subsided.\n\n\"It's the devil of a mess,\" he commented. \"I suppose the square thing\nto do is to tell Doctor David, and let him decide. I've got too much at\nstake to be a judge of what to do.\"\n\nHe went upstairs soon after that, leaving her still in her chair,\nswathed in furs, her round anxious face bent forward in thought. He\nhad rarely seen her so troubled, so uncertain of her next move, and he\nsurmised, knowing her, that her emotions were a complex of anxiety for\nhimself with Elizabeth, of pity for David, and of the memory of Dick\nLivingstone's haggard face.\n\nShe sat alone for some time and then went reluctantly up the stairs to\nher bedroom. She felt, like Wallie, that she had too much at stake to\ndecide easily what to do.\n\nIn the end she decided to ask Doctor Reynolds' advice, and in the\nmorning she proceeded to do it. Reynolds was interested, even a little\nexcited, she thought, but he thought it better not to tell David. He\nwould himself go to Harrison Miller with it.\n\n\"You say he knew you?\" he inquired, watching her. \"I suppose there is no\ndoubt of that?\"\n\n\"Certainly not. He's known me for years. And he asked about David.\"\n\n\"I see.\" He fell into profound thought, while she sat in her chair a\ntrifle annoyed with him. He was wondering how all this would affect him\nand his prospects, and through them his right to marry. He had walked\ninto a good thing, and into a very considerable content.\n\n\"I see,\" he repeated, and got up. \"I'll tell Miller, and we'll get to\nwork. We are all very grateful to you, Mrs. Sayre--\"\n\nAs a result of that visit Harrison Miller and Bassett went that night to\nChicago. They left it to Doctor Reynolds' medical judgment whether David\nshould be told or not, and Reynolds himself did not know. In the end he\npassed the shuttle the next evening to Clare Rossiter.\n\n\"Something's troubling you,\" she said. \"You're not a bit like yourself,\nold dear.\"\n\nHe looked at her. To him she was all that was fine and good and sane of\njudgment.\n\n\"I've got something to settle,\" he said. \"I was wondering while you were\nsinging, dear, whether you could help me out.\"\n\n\"When I sing you're supposed to listen. Well? What is it?\" She perched\nherself on the arm of his chair, and ran her fingers over his hair.\nShe was very fond of him, and she meant to be a good wife. If she\never thought of Dick Livingstone now it was in connection with her own\nreckless confession to Elizabeth. She had hated Elizabeth ever since.\n\n\"I'll take a hypothetical case. If you guess, you needn't say. Of course\nit's a great secret.\"\n\nShe listened, nodding now and then. He used no names, and he said\nnothing of any crime.\n\n\"The point is this,\" he finished. \"Is it better to believe the man is\ndead, or to know that he is alive, but has cut himself off?\"\n\n\"There's no mistake about the recognition?\"\n\n\"Somebody from the village saw him in Chicago within day or two, and\ntalked to him.\"\n\nShe had the whole picture in a moment. She knew that Mrs. Sayre had been\nin Chicago, that she had seen Dick there and talked to him. She turned\nthe matter over in her mind, shrewdly calculating, planning her small\nrevenge on Elizabeth even as she talked.\n\n\"I'd wait,\" she advised him. \"He may come back with them, and in that\ncase David will know soon enough. Or he may refuse to, and that would\nkill him. He'd rather think him dead than that.\"\n\nShe slept quietly that night, and spent rather more time than usual in\ndressing that morning. Then she took her way to the Wheeler house. She\nsaw in what she was doing no particularly culpable thing. She had no\ngreat revenge in mind; all that she intended was an evening of the score\nbetween them. \"He preferred you to me, when you knew I cared. But he has\ndeserted you.\" And perhaps, too, a small present jealousy, for she was\nto live in the old brick Livingstone house, or in one like it, while all\nthe village expected ultimately to see Elizabeth installed in the house\non the hill.\n\nShe kept her message to the end of her visit, and delivered her blow\nstanding.\n\n\"I have something I ought to tell you, Elizabeth. But I don't know how\nyou'll take it.\"\n\n\"Maybe it's something I won't want to hear.\"\n\n\"I'll tell you, if you won't say where you heard it.\"\n\nBut Elizabeth made a small, impatient gesture. \"I don't like secrets,\nClare. I can't keep them, for one thing. You'd better not tell me.\"\n\nClare was nearly balked of her revenge, but not entirely.\n\n\"All right,\" she said, and prepared to depart. \"I won't. But you might\njust find out from your friend Mrs. Sayre who it was she saw in Chicago\nthis week.\"\n\nIt was in this manner, bit by bit and each bit trivial, that the case\nagainst Dick was built up for Elizabeth. Mrs. Sayre, helpless before her\nquiet questioning, had to acknowledge one damning thing after another.\nHe had known her; he had not asked for Elizabeth, but only for David;\nhe looked tired and thin, but well. She stood at the window watching\nElizabeth go down the hill, with a feeling that she had just seen\nsomething die before her.\n\n\n\n\nXXXVIII\n\nOn the night Bassett and Harrison Miller were to return from Chicago\nLucy sat downstairs in her sitting-room waiting for news.\n\nAt ten o'clock, according to her custom, she went up to see that David\nwas comfortable for the night, and to read him that prayer for the\nabsent with which he always closed his day of waiting. But before she\nwent she stopped before the old mirror in the hall, to see if she wore\nany visible sign of tension.\n\nThe door into Dick's office was open, and on his once neat desk there\nlay a litter of papers and letters. She sighed and went up the stairs.\n\nDavid lay propped up in his walnut bed. An incredibly wasted and old\nDavid; the hands on the log-cabin quilt which their mother had made were\nold hands, and tired. Sometimes Lucy, with a frightened gasp, would fear\nthat David's waiting now was not all for Dick. That he was waiting for\npeace.\n\nThere had been something new in David lately. She thought it was fear.\nAlways he had been so sure of himself; he had made his experiment in\na man's soul, and whatever the result he had been ready to face his\nCreator with it. But he had lost courage. He had tampered with the\nthings that were to be and not he, but Dick, was paying for that awful\naudacity.\n\nOnce, picking up his prayer-book to read evening prayer as was her\ncustom now, it had opened at a verse marked with an uneven line:\n\n\"I will arise and go to my Father, and will say unto Him, Father, I\nhave sinned against Heaven and before Thee, and am no more worthy to be\ncalled Thy son.\"\n\nThat had frightened her\n\nDavid's eyes followed her about the room.\n\n\"I've got an idea you're keeping something from me, Lucy.\"\n\n\"I? Why should I do that?\"\n\n\"Then where's Harrison?\" he demanded, querulously.\n\nShe told him one of the few white lies of her life when she said: \"He\nhasn't been well. He'll be over to-morrow.\" She sat down and picked\nup the prayer-book, only to find him lifting himself in the bed and\nlistening.\n\n\"Somebody closed the hall door, Lucy. If it's Reynolds, I want to see\nhim.\"\n\nShe got up and went to the head of the stairs. The light was low in the\nhall beneath, and she saw a man standing there. But she still wore her\nreading glasses, and she saw at first hardly more than a figure.\n\n\"Is that you, Doctor Reynolds?\" she asked, in her high old voice.\n\nThen she put her hand to her throat and stood rigid, staring down. For\nthe man had whipped off his cap and stood with his arms wide, looking\nup.\n\nHolding to the stair-rail, her knees trembling under her, Lucy went\ndown, and not until Dick's arms were around her was she sure that it was\nDick, and not his shabby, weary ghost. She clung to him, tears streaming\ndown her face, still in that cautious silence which governed them both;\nshe held him off and looked at him, and then strained herself to him\nagain, as though the sense of unreality were too strong, and only the\ncontact of his rough clothing made him real to her.\n\nIt was not until they were in her sitting-room with the door closed that\neither of them dared to speak. Or perhaps, could speak. Even then she\nkept hold of him.\n\n\"Dick!\" she said. \"Dick!\"\n\nAnd that, over and over.\n\n\"How is he?\" he was able to ask finally.\n\n\"He has been very ill. I began to think--Dick, I'm afraid to tell him.\nI'm afraid he'll die of joy.\"\n\nHe winced at that. There could not be much joy in the farewell that was\ncoming. Winced, and almost staggered. He had walked all the way from the\ncity, and he had had no food that day.\n\n\"We'll have to break it to him very gently,\" he said. \"And he mustn't\nsee me like this. If you can find some of my clothes and Reynolds'\nrazor, I'll--\" He caught suddenly to the back of a chair and held on to\nit. \"I haven't taken time to eat much to-day,\" he said, smiling at her.\n\"I guess I need food, Aunt Lucy.\"\n\nFor the first time then she saw his clothes, his shabbiness and\nhis pallor, and perhaps she guessed the truth. She got up, her face\ntwitching, and pushed him into a chair.\n\n\"You sit here,\" she said, \"and leave the door closed. The nurse is out\nfor a walk, and she'll be in soon. I'll bring some milk and cookies now,\nand start the fire. I've got some chops in the house.\"\n\nWhen she came back almost immediately, with the familiar tray and the\nfamiliar food, he was sitting where she had left him. He had spent the\nentire time, had she known it, in impressing on his mind the familiar\ndetails of the room, to carry away with him.\n\nShe stood beside him, a hand on his shoulder, to see that he drank the\nmilk slowly.\n\n\"I've got the fire going,\" she said. \"And I'll run up now and get your\nclothes. I--had put them away.\" Her voice broke a little. \"You see,\nwe--You can change in your laboratory. Richard, can't you? If you go\nupstairs he'll hear you.\"\n\nHe reached up and caught her hand. That touch, too, of the nearest to\na mother's hand that he had known, he meant to carry away with him. He\ncould not speak.\n\nShe bustled away, into her bright kitchen first, and then with happy\nstealth to the store-room. Her very heart was singing within her. She\nneither thought nor reasoned. Dick was back, and all would be well.\nIf she had any subconscious anxieties they were quieted, also\nsubconsciously, by confidence in the men who were fighting his battle\nfor him, by Walter Wheeler and Bassett and Harrison Miller. That Dick\nhimself would present any difficulty lay beyond her worst fears.\n\nShe had been out of the room only twenty minutes when she returned to\nDavid and prepared to break her great news. At first she thought he was\nasleep. He was lying back with his eyes closed and his hands crossed on\nthe prayer-book. But he looked up at her, and was instantly roused to\nfull attention by her face.\n\n\"You've had some news,\" he said.\n\n\"Yes, David. There's a little news. Don't count too much on it. Don't\nsit up. David, I have heard something that makes me think he is alive.\nAlive and well.\"\n\nHe made a desperate effort and controlled himself.\n\n\"Where is he?\"\n\nShe sat down beside him and took his hand between hers.\n\n\"David,\" she said slowly, \"God has been very good to us. I want to tell\nyou something, and I want you to prepare yourself. We have heard\nfrom Dick. He is all right. He loves us, as he always did. And--he is\ndownstairs, David.\"\n\nHe lay very still and without speaking. She was frightened at first,\nafraid to go on with her further news. But suddenly David sat up in bed\nand in a full, firm voice began the Te Deum Laudamus. \"We praise thee,\nO God: we acknowledge thee to be the Lord. All the earth doth worship\nthee, the Father everlasting.\"\n\nHe repeated it in its entirety. At the end, however, his voice broke.\n\n\"O Lord, in thee have I trusted--I doubted Him, Lucy,\" he said.\n\nDick, waiting at the foot of the stairs, heard that triumphant paean of\nthanksgiving and praise and closed his eyes.\n\nIt was a few minutes later that Lucy came down the stairs again.\n\n\"You heard him?\" she asked. \"Oh, Dick, he had frightened me. It was more\nthan a question of himself and you. He was making it one of himself and\nGod.\"\n\nShe let him go up alone and waited below, straining her ears, but she\nheard nothing beyond David's first hoarse cry, and after a little she\nwent into her sitting-room and shut the door.\n\nWhatever lay underneath, there was no surface drama in the meeting. The\ndetermination to ignore any tragedy in the situation was strong in\nthem both, and if David's eyes were blurred and his hands trembling, if\nDick's first words were rather choked, they hid their emotion carefully.\n\n\"Well, here I am, like a bad penny!\" said Dick huskily from the doorway.\n\n\"And a long time you've been about it,\" grumbled David. \"You young\nrascal!\"\n\nHe held out his hand, and Dick crushed it between both of his. He was\nstartled at the change in David. For a moment he could only stand there,\nholding his hand, and trying to keep his apprehension out of his face.\n\n\"Sit down,\" David said awkwardly, and blew his nose with a terrific\nblast. \"I've been laid up for a while, but I'm all right now. I'll fool\nthem all yet,\" he boasted, out of his happiness and content. \"Business\nhas been going to the dogs, Dick. Reynolds is a fool.\"\n\n\"Of course you'll fool them.\" There was still a band around Dick's\nthroat. It hurt him to look at David, so thin and feeble, so sunken from\nhis former portliness. And David saw his eyes, and knew.\n\n\"I've dropped a little flesh, eh, Dick?\" he inquired. \"Old bulge is\ngone, you see. The nurse makes up the bed when I'm in it, flat as when\nI'm out.\"\n\nSuddenly his composure broke. He was a feeble and apprehensive old man,\nshaken with the tearless sobbing of weakness and age. Dick put an arm\nacross his shoulders, and they sat without speech until David was quiet\nagain.\n\n\"I'm a crying old woman, Dick,\" David said at last. \"That's what comes\nof never feeling a pair of pants on your legs and being coddled like\na baby.\" He sat up and stared around him ferociously. \"They sprinkle\nviolet water on my pillows, Dick! Can you beat that?\"\n\nWarned by Lucy, the nurse went to her room and did not disturb them.\nBut she sat for a time in her rocking-chair, before she changed into the\nnightgown and kimono in which she slept on the couch in David's room.\nShe knew the story, and her kindly heart ached within her. What good\nwould it do after all, this home-coming? Dick could not stay. It was\neven dangerous. Reynolds had confided to her that he suspected a watch\non the house by the police, and that the mail was being opened. What\ngood was it?\n\nAcross the hall she could hear Lucy moving briskly about in Dick's\nroom, changing the bedding, throwing up the windows, opening and closing\nbureau drawers. After a time Lucy tapped at her door and she opened it.\n\n\"I put a cake of scented soap among your handkerchiefs,\" she said,\nrather breathlessly. \"Will you let me have it for Doctor Dick's room?\"\n\nShe got the soap and gave it to her.\n\n\"He is going to stay, then?\"\n\n\"Certainly he is going to stay,\" Lucy said, surprised. \"This is his\nhome. Where else should he go?\"\n\nBut David knew. He lay, listening with avid interest to Dick's story,\nasking a question now and then, nodding over Dick's halting attempt to\nreconstruct the period of his confusion, but all the time one part of\nhim, a keen and relentless inner voice, was saying: \"Look at him well.\nHold him close. Listen to his voice. Because this hour is yours, and\nperhaps only this hour.\"\n\n\"Then the Sayre woman doesn't know about your coming?\" he asked, when\nDick had finished.\n\n\"Still, she mustn't talk about having seen you. I'll send Reynolds up in\nthe morning.\"\n\nHe was eager to hear of what had occurred in the long interval between\nthem, and good, bad and indifferent Dick told him. But he limited\nhimself to events, and did not touch on his mental battles, and David\nsaw and noted it. The real story, he knew, lay there, but it was not\ntime for it. After a while he raised himself in his bed.\n\n\"Call Lucy, Dick.\"\n\nWhen she had come, a strangely younger Lucy, her withered cheeks flushed\nwith exercise and excitement, he said:\n\n\"Bring me the copy of the statement I made to Harrison Miller, Lucy.\"\n\nShe brought it, patted Dick's shoulder, and went away. David held out\nthe paper.\n\n\"Read it slowly, boy,\" he said. \"It is my justification, and God\nwilling, it may help you. The letter is from my brother, Henry. Read\nthat, too.\"\n\nLucy, having got Dick's room in readiness, sat down in it to await his\ncoming. Downstairs, in the warming oven, was his supper. His bed, with\nthe best blankets, was turned down and ready. His dressing-gown and\nslippers were in their old accustomed place. She drew a long breath.\n\nBelow, Doctor Reynolds came in quietly and stood listening. The house\nwas very still, and he decided that his news, which was after all\nno news, could wait. He went into the office and got out a sheet of\nnote-paper, with his name at the top, and began his nightly letter to\nClare Rossiter.\n\n\"My darling,\" it commenced.\n\nAbove, David lay in his bed and Dick read the papers in his hand. And as\nhe read them David watched him. Not once, since Dick's entrance, had\nhe mentioned Elizabeth. David lay still and pondered that. There was\nsomething wrong about it. This was Dick, their own Dick; no shadowy\nghost of the past, but Dick himself. True, an older Dick, strangely\nhaggard and with gray running in the brown of his hair, but still\nDick; the Dick whose eyes had lighted at the sight of a girl, who had\nshamelessly persisted in holding her hand at that last dinner, who had\nalmost idolatrously loved her.\n\nAnd he had not mentioned her name.\n\nWhen he had finished the reading Dick sat for a moment with the papers\nin his hand, thinking.\n\n\"I see,\" he said finally. \"Of course, it's possible. Good God, if I\ncould only think it.\"\n\n\"It's the answer,\" David said stubbornly. \"He was prowling around, and\nfired through the window. Donaldson made the statement at the inquest\nthat some one had been seen on the place, and that he notified you that\nnight after dinner. He'd put guards around the place.\"\n\n\"It gives me a fighting chance, anyhow.\" Dick got up and threw back his\nshoulders. \"That's all I want. A chance to fight. I know this. I hated\nLucas--he was a poor thing and you know what he did to me. But I never\nthought of killing him. That wouldn't have helped matters. It was too\nlate.\"\n\n\"What about--that?\" David asked, not looking at him. When Dick did not\nimmediately reply David glanced at him, to find his face set and pained.\n\n\"Perhaps we'd better not go into that now,\" David said hastily. \"It's\nnatural that the readjustments will take time.\"\n\n\"We'll have to go into it. It's the hardest thing I have to face.\"\n\n\"It's not dead, then?\"\n\n\"No,\" Dick said slowly. \"It's not dead, David. And I'd better bring it\ninto the open. I've fought it to the limit by myself. It's the one thing\nthat seems to have survived the shipwreck. I can't argue it down or\nthink it down.\"\n\n\"Maybe, if you see Elizabeth--\"\n\n\"I'd break her heart, that's all.\"\n\nHe tried to make David understand. He told in its sordid details his\nfailure to kill it, his attempts to sink memory and conscience in\nChicago and their failure, the continued remoteness of Elizabeth and\nwhat seemed to him the flesh and blood reality of the other woman. That\nshe was yesterday, and Elizabeth was long ago.\n\n\"I can't argue it down,\" he finished. \"I've tried to, desperately. It's\na--I think it's a wicked thing, in a way. And God knows all she ever got\nout of it was suffering. She must loathe the thought of me.\"\n\nDavid was compelled to let it rest there. He found that Dick was\ndoggedly determined to see Beverly Carlysle. After that, he didn't know.\nNo man wanted to surrender himself for trial, unless he was sure\nhimself of whether he was innocent or guilty. If there was a reasonable\ndoubt--but what did it matter one way or the other? His place was gone,\nas he'd made it, gone if he was cleared, gone if he was convicted.\n\n\"I can't come back, David. They wouldn't have me.\"\n\nAfter a silence he asked:\n\n\"How much is known here? What does Elizabeth know?\"\n\n\"The town knows nothing. She knows a part of it. She cares a great deal,\nDick. It's a tragedy for her.\"\n\n\"Shall you tell her I have been here?\"\n\n\"Not unless you intend to see her.\"\n\nBut Dick shook his head.\n\n\"Even if other things were the same I haven't a right to see her, until\nI've got a clean slate.\"\n\n\"That's sheer evasion,\" David said, almost with irritation.\n\n\"Yes,\" Dick acknowledged gravely. \"It is sheer evasion.\"\n\n\"What about the police?\" he inquired after a silence. \"I was registered\nat Norada. I suppose they traced me?\"\n\n\"Yes. The house was watched for a while; I understand they've given it\nup now.\"\n\nIn response to questions about his own condition David was almost\nquerulous. He was all right. He would get well if they'd let him, and\nstop coddling him. He would get up now, in spite of them. He was good\nfor one more fight before he died, and he intended to make it, in a\ncourt if necessary.\n\n\"They can't prove it, Dick,\" he said triumphantly. \"I've been over it\nevery day for months. There is no case. There never was a case, for that\nmatter. They're a lot of pin-headed fools, and we'll show them up, boy.\nWe'll show them up.\"\n\nBut for all his excitement fatigue was telling on him. Lucy tapped at\nthe door and came in.\n\n\"You'd better have your supper before it spoils,\" she said. \"And David\nneeds a rest. Doctor Reynolds is in the office. I haven't told him yet.\"\n\nThe two men exchanged glances.\n\n\"Time for that later,\" David said. \"I can't keep him out of my office,\nbut I can out of my family affairs for an hour or so.\"\n\n\nSo it happened that Dick followed Lucy down the back stairs and ate his\nmeal stealthily in the kitchen.\n\n\"I don't like you to eat here,\" she protested.\n\n\"I've eaten in worse places,\" he said, smiling at her. \"And sometimes\nnot at all.\" He was immediately sorry for that, for the tears came to\nher eyes.\n\nHe broke as gently as he could the news that he could not stay, but it\nwas a great blow to her. Her sagging chin quivered piteously, and it\ntook all the cheerfulness he could summon and all the promises of return\nhe could make to soften the shock.\n\n\"You haven't even seen Elizabeth,\" she said at last.\n\n\"That will have to wait until things are cleared up, Aunt Lucy.\"\n\n\"Won't you write her something then, Richard? She looks like a ghost\nthese days.\"\n\nHer eyes were on him, puzzled and wistful. He met them gravely.\n\n\"I haven't the right to see her, or to write to her.\"\n\nAnd the finality in his tone closed the discussion, that and something\nvery close to despair in his face.\n\nFor all his earlier hunger he ate very little, and soon after he tiptoed\nup the stairs again to David's room. When he came down to the kitchen\nlater on he found her still there, at the table where he had left her,\nher arms across it and her face buried in them. On a chair was the\nsuitcase she had hastily packed for him, and a roll of bills lay on the\ntable.\n\n\"You must take it,\" she insisted. \"It breaks my heart to think--Dick, I\nhave the feeling that I am seeing you for the last time.\" Then for fear\nshe had hurt him she forced a determined smile. \"Don't pay any attention\nto me. David will tell you that I have said, over and over, that I'd\nnever see you again. And here you are!\"\n\nHe was going. He had said good-bye to David and was going at once. She\naccepted it with a stoicism born of many years of hail and farewell,\nkissed him tenderly, let her hand linger for a moment on the rough\nsleeve of his coat, and then let him out by the kitchen door into the\nyard. But long after he had gone she stood in the doorway, staring\nout...\n\nIn the office Doctor Reynolds was finishing a long and carefully written\nletter.\n\n\"I am not good at putting myself on paper, as you know, dear heart. But\nthis I do know. I do not believe that real love dies. We may bury it,\nso deep that it seems to be entirely dead, but some day it sends up\na shoot, and it either lives, or the business of killing it has to be\nbegun all over again. So when we quarrel, I always know--\"\n\n\n\n\nXXXIX\n\nThe evening had shaken Dick profoundly. David's appearance and Lucy's\ngrief and premonition, most of all the talk of Elizabeth, had depressed\nand unnerved him. Even the possibility of his own innocence was\nsubordinated to an overwhelming yearning for the old house and the old\nlife.\n\nThrough a side window as he went toward the street he could see Reynolds\nat his desk in the office, and he was possessed by a fierce jealousy and\nresentment at his presence there. The laboratory window was dark, and\nhe stood outside and looked at it. He would have given his hope of\nimmortality just then to have been inside it once more, working over his\ntubes and his cultures, his slides and microscope. Even the memory of\ncertain dearly-bought extravagances in apparatus revived in him,\nand sent the blood to his head in a wave of unreasoning anger and\nbitterness.\n\nHe had a wild desire to go in at the front door, confront Reynolds in\nhis smug complacency and drive him out; to demand his place in the world\nand take it. He could hardly tear himself away.\n\nUnder a street lamp he looked at his watch. It was eleven o'clock, and\nhe had a half hour to spare before train-time. Following an impulse he\ndid not analyze he turned toward the Wheeler house. Just so months ago\nhad he turned in that direction, but with this difference, that then he\nwent with a sort of hurried expectancy, and that now he loitered on the\nway. Yet that it somehow drew him he knew. Not with the yearning he had\nfelt toward the old brick house, but with the poignancy of a long past\nhappiness. He did not love, but he remembered.\n\nYet, for a man who did not love, he was oddly angry at the sight of two\nyoung figures on the doorstep. Their clear voices came to him across\nthe quiet street, vibrant and full of youth. It was the Sayre boy and\nElizabeth.\n\nHe half stopped, and looked across. They were quite oblivious of him,\nintent and self-absorbed. As he had viewed Reynolds' unconscious figure\nwith jealous dislike, so he viewed Wallace Sayre. Here, everywhere, his\nplace was filled. He was angry with an unreasoning, inexplicable anger,\nangry at Elizabeth, angry at the boy, and at himself.\n\nHe had but to cross the street and take his place there. He could\ndrive that beardless youngster away with a word. The furious possessive\njealousy of the male animal, which had nothing to do with love, made him\nstop and draw himself up as he stared across.\n\nThen he smiled wryly and went on. He could do it, but he did not want\nto. He would never do it. Let them live their lives, and let him live\nhis. But he knew that there, across the street, so near that he might\nhave raised his voice and summoned her, he was leaving the best thing\nthat had come into his life; the one fine and good thing, outside of\nDavid and Lucy. That against its loss he had nothing but an infatuation\nthat had ruined three lives already, and was not yet finished.\n\nHe stopped and, turning, looked back. He saw the girl bend down and\nput a hand on Wallie Sayre's shoulder, and the boy's face upturned and\nlooking into hers. He shook himself and went on. After all, that was\nbest. He felt no anger now. She deserved better than to be used to help\na man work out his salvation. She deserved youth, and joyousness, and\nthe forgetfulness that comes with time. She was already forgetting.\n\nHe smiled again as he went on up the street, but his hands as he\nbuttoned his overcoat were shaking.\n\nIt was shortly after that that he met the rector, Mr. Oglethorpe. He\npassed him quickly, but he was conscious that the clergyman had stopped\nand was staring after him. Half an hour later, sitting in the empty\nsmoker of the train, he wondered if he had not missed something there.\nPerhaps the church could have helped him, a good man's simple belief in\nright and wrong. He was wandering in a gray no-man's land, without faith\nor compass.\n\nDavid had given him the location of Bassett's apartment house, and he\nfound it quickly. He was in a state of nervous irritability by that\ntime, for the sense of being a fugitive was constantly stressed in the\nfamiliar streets by the danger of recognition. It was in vain that\nhe argued with himself that only the police were interested in his\nmovements, and the casual roundsman not at all. He found himself shying\naway from them like a nervous horse.\n\nBut if he expected any surprise from Bassett he was disappointed. He\ngreeted him as if he had seen him yesterday, and explained his lack of\namazement in his first words.\n\n\"Doctor Livingstone telephoned me. Sit down, man, and let me look at\nyou. You've given me more trouble than any human being on earth.\"\n\n\"Sorry,\" Dick said awkwardly, \"I seem to have a faculty of involving\nother people in my difficulties.\"\n\n\"Want a drink?\"\n\n\"No, thanks. I'll smoke, if you have any tobacco. I've been afraid to\nrisk a shop.\"\n\nBassett talked cheerfully as he found cigarettes and matches. \"The old\nboy had a different ring to his voice to-night. He was going down pretty\nfast, Livingstone; was giving up the fight. But I fancy you've given\nhim a new grip on the earth.\" When they were seated, however, a sort of\nawkwardness developed. To Dick, Bassett had been a more or less shadowy\nmemory, clouded over with the details and miseries of the flight. And\nBassett found Dick greatly altered. He was older than he remembered him.\nThe sort of boyishness which had come with the resurrection of his early\nidentity had gone, and the man who sat before him was grave, weary, and\nmuch older. But his gaze was clear and direct.\n\n\"Well, a good bit of water has gone over the dam since we met,\" Bassett\nsaid. \"I nearly broke a leg going down that infernal mountain again.\nAnd I don't mind telling you that I came within an ace of landing in the\nNorada jail. They knew I'd helped you get away. But they couldn't prove\nit.\"\n\n\"I got out, because I didn't see any need of dragging you down with\nme. I was a good bit of a mess just then, but I could reason that out,\nanyhow. It wasn't entirely unselfish, either. I had a better chance\nwithout you. Or thought I did.\"\n\nBassett was watching him intently.\n\n\"Has it all come back?\" he inquired.\n\n\"Practically all. Not much between the thing that happened at the ranch\nand David Livingstone's picking me up at the cabin.\"\n\n\"Did it ever occur to you to wonder just how I got in on your secret?\"\n\n\"I suppose you read Maggie Donaldson's confession.\"\n\n\"I came to see you before that came out.\"\n\n\"Then I don't know, I'm afraid.\"\n\n\"I suppose you would stake your life on the fact that Beverly Carlysle\nknows nothing of what happened that night at the ranch?\"\n\nDick's face twitched, but he returned Bassett's gaze steadily.\n\n\"She has no criminal knowledge, if that is what you mean.\"\n\n\"I am not so sure of it.\"\n\n\"I think you'd better explain that.\"\n\nAt the cold anger in Dick's voice Bassett stared at him. So that was\nhow the wind lay. Poor devil! And out of the smug complacence of his\nbachelor peace Bassett thanked his stars for no women in his life.\n\n\"I'm afraid you misunderstand me, Livingstone,\" he said easily. \"I don't\nthink that she shot Lucas. But I don't think she has ever told all she\nknows. I've got the coroner's inquest here, and we'll go over it\nlater. I'll tell you how I got onto your trail. Do you remember taking\nElizabeth Wheeler to see 'The Valley?'\"\n\n\"I had forgotten it. I remember now.\"\n\n\"Well, Gregory, the brother, saw you and recognized you. I was with him.\nHe tried to deny you later, but I was on. Of course he told her, and\nI think she sent him to warn David Livingstone. They knew I was on the\ntrail of a big story. Then I think Gregory stayed here to watch me when\nthe company made its next jump. He knew I'd started, for he sent David\nLivingstone the letter you got. By the way, that letter nearly got me\njailed in Norada.\"\n\n\"I'm not hiding behind her skirts,\" Dick said shortly. \"And there's\nnothing incriminating in what you say. She saw me as a fugitive, and she\nsent me a warning. That's all.\"\n\n\"Easy, easy, old man. I'm not pinning anything on her. But I want, if\nyou don't mind, to carry this through. I have every reason to believe\nthat, some time before you got to Norada, the Thorwald woman was on my\ntrail. I know that I was followed to the cabin the night I stayed there,\nand that she got a saddle horse from her son that night, her son by\nThorwald, either for herself or some one else.\"\n\n\"All right. I accept that, tentatively.\"\n\n\"That means that she knew I was coming to Norada. Think a minute; I'd\nkept my movements quiet, but Beverly Carlysle knew, and her brother.\nWhen they warned David they warned her.\"\n\n\"I don't believe it.\"\n\n\"If you had killed Lucas,\" Bassett asserted positively, \"the Thorwald\nwoman would have let the sheriff get you, and be damned to you. She had\nno reason to love you. You'd kept her son out of what she felt was his\nbirthright.\"\n\nHe got up and opened a table drawer.\n\n\"I've got a copy of the coroner's inquest here. It will bear going over.\nAnd it may help you to remember, too. We needn't read it all. There's a\nlot that isn't pertinent.\"\n\nHe got out a long envelope, and took from it a number of typed pages,\nbacked with a base of heavy paper.\n\n\"'Inquest in the Coroner's office on the body of Howard Lucas,'\" he\nread. \"'October 10th, 1911.' That was the second day after. 'Examination\nof witnesses by Coroner Samuel J. Burkhardt. Mrs. Lucas called and\nsworn.'\" He glanced at Dick and hesitated. \"I don't know about this\nto-night, Livingstone. You look pretty well shot to pieces.\"\n\n\"I didn't sleep last night. I'm all right. Go on.\"\n\nDuring the reading that followed he sat back in his deep chair, his\neyes closed. Except that once or twice he clenched his hands he made no\nmovement whatever.\n\nQ. \"What is your name?\"\n\nA. \"Anne Elizabeth Lucas. My stage name is Beverly Carlysle.\"\n\nQ. \"Where do you live, Mrs. Lucas?\"\n\nA. \"At 26 East 56th Street, New York City.\"\n\nQ. \"I shall have to ask you some questions that are necessarily  painful\nat this time.  I shall be as brief as possible. Perhaps it will be\neasier for you to tell so much as you know of what happened the night\nbefore last at the Clark ranch.\"\n\nA. \"I cannot tell very much. I am confused, too. I was given  a sleeping\npowder last night.  I can only say that I heard a shot, and thought at\nfirst that it was fired from outside. I ran down the stairs, and back to\nthe billiard room.  As I entered the room Mr. Donaldson came in through\na window.  My husband was lying on the floor.  That is all.\"\n\nQ. \"Where was Judson Clark?\"\n\nA. \"He was leaning on the roulette table, staring at the--at  my husband.\"\n\nQ. \"Did you see him leave the room?\"\n\nA. \"No. I was on my knees beside Mr. Lucas. I think when I got  up he\nwas gone.  I didn't notice.\"\n\nQ. \"Did you see a revolver?\"\n\nA. \"No. I didn't look for one.\"\n\nQ. \"Now I shall ask you one more question, and that is all. Had  there\nbeen any quarrel between Mr. Lucas and Mr. Clark that evening in your\npresence?\"\n\nA. \"No. But I had quarreled with them both. They were drinking  too\nmuch.  I had gone to my room to pack and go home.  I was packing when I\nheard the shot.\"\n\n\nWitness excused and Mr. John Donaldson called.\n\nQ. \"What is your name?\"\n\nA. \"John Donaldson.\"\n\nQ. \"Where do you live?\"\n\nA. \"At the Clark ranch.\"\n\nQ. \"What is your business?\"\n\nA. \"You know all about me. I'm foreman of the ranch.\"\n\nQ. \"I want you to tell what you know, Jack, about last night.  Begin\nwith where you were when you heard the shot.\"\n\nA. \"I was on the side porch. The billiard room opens on to it.  I'd been\ntold by the corral boss earlier in the  evening that he'd seen a man\nskulking around the house.  There'd been a report like that once or\ntwice before, and I set a watch.  I put Ben Haggerty at the kitchen wing\nwith a gun, and I took up a stand on the porch.  Before I did that I\ntold Judson, but I don't think he took it in.  He'd been lit up like a\nhouse afire all evening.  I asked for his gun, but he said he didn't\nknow where it was, and I went back to my house and got my own.  Along\nabout eight o'clock I thought I saw some one in the shrubbery, and I\nwent out as quietly as I could. But it was a woman, Hattie Thorwald, who\nwas working at the ranch.\n\n\"When I left the men were playing roulette.  I looked in as I went back,\nand Judson had a gun in his hand.  He said; 'I found it, Jack.' I saw he\nwas very drunk, and I told him to put it up, I'd got mine.  It had\noccurred to me that I'd better warn Haggerty to be careful, and I\nstarted along the verandah to tell him not to shoot except to scare.  I\nhad only gone a few steps when I heard a shot, and ran back.  Mr. Lucas\nwas on the floor dead, and Judson was as the lady said. He must have\ngone out while I was bending over the body.\"\n\nQ. \"Did you see the revolver in his hand?\"\n\nA. \"No.\"\n\nQ. \"How long between your warning Mr. Clark and the shot?\"\n\nA. \"I suppose I'd gone a dozen yards.\"\n\nQ. \"Were you present when the revolver was found?\"\n\nA. \"No, sir.\"\n\nQ. \"Did you see Judson Clark again?\"\n\nA. \"No, sir. From what I gather he went straight to the corral  and got\nhis horse.\"\n\nQ. \"You entered the room as Mrs. Lucas came in the door?\"\n\nA. \"Well, she's wrong about that. She was there a little ahead  of me.\nShe'd reached the body before I got in.  She was stooping over it.\"\n\nBassett looked up from his reading.\n\n\"I want you to get this, Livingstone,\" he said. \"How did she reach the\nbilliard room? Where was it in the house?\"\n\n\"Off the end of the living-room.\"\n\n\"A large living-room?\"\n\n\"Forty or forty-five feet, about.\"\n\n\"Will you draw it for me, roughly?\"\n\nHe passed over a pad and pencil, and Dick made a hasty outline. Bassett\nwatched with growing satisfaction.\n\n\"Here's the point,\" he said, when Dick had finished. \"She was there\nbefore Donaldson, or at the same time,\" as Dick made an impatient\nmovement. \"But he had only a dozen yards to go. She was in her room,\nupstairs. To get down in that time she had to leave her room, descend\na staircase, cross a hall and run the length of the living-room,\nforty-five feet. If the case had ever gone to trial she'd have had to do\nsome explaining.\"\n\n\"She or Donaldson,\" Dick said obstinately.\n\nBassett read on:\n\nJean Melis called and sworn.\n\nQ. \"Your name?\"\n\nA. \"Jean Melis.\"\n\nQ. \"Have you an American residence, Mr. Melis?\"\n\nA. \"Only where I am employed. I am now living at the Clark  ranch.\"\n\nQ. \"What is your business?\"\n\nA. \"I am Mr. Clark's valet.\"\n\nQ. \"It was you who found Mr. Clark's revolver?\"\n\nA. \"Yes.\"\n\nQ. \"Tell about how and where you found it.\"\n\nA. \"I made a search early in the evening. I will not hide from you that\nI meant to conceal it if I discovered it. A man who is drunk is not\nguilty of what he does. I did not find it. I went back that night, when\nthe people had gone, and found it beneath the carved woodbox, by the\nfireplace. I did not know that the sheriff had placed a man outside the\nwindow.\"\n\n\"Get that, too,\" Bassett said, putting down the paper. \"The Frenchman\nwas fond of you, and he was doing his blundering best. But the sheriff\nexpected you back and had had the place watched, so they caught him. But\nthat's not the point. A billiard room is a hard place to hide things in.\nI take it yours was like the average.\"\n\nDick nodded.\n\n\"All right. This poor boob of a valet made a search and didn't find it.\nLater he found it. Why did he search? Wasn't it the likely thing that\nyou'd carried it away with you? Do you suppose for a moment that with\nDonaldson and the woman in the room you hid it there, and then went back\nand stood behind the roulette table, leaning on it with both hands, and\nstaring? Not at all. Listen to this:\n\nQ. \"You recognize this revolver as the one you found?\"\n\nA. \"Yes.\"\n\nQ. \"You are familiar with it?\"\n\nA. \"Yes. It is Mr. Clark's.\"\n\nQ. \"You made the second search because you had not examined the  woodbox\nearlier?\"\n\nA. \"No. I had examined the woodbox. I had a theory that--\"\n\nQ. \"The Jury cannot listen to any theories. This is an inquiry  into\nfacts.\"\n\n\"I'm going to find Melis,\" the reporter said thoughtfully, as he folded\nup the papers. \"The fact is, I mailed an advertisement to the New York\npapers to-day. I want to get that theory of his. It's the servants in\nthe house who know what is going on. I've got an idea that he'd stumbled\nonto something. He'd searched for the revolver, and it wasn't there.\nHe went back and it was. All that conflicting evidence, and against it,\nwhat? That you'd run away!\"\n\nBut he saw that Dick was very tired, and even a little indifferent.\nHe would be glad to know that his hands were clean, but against the\nintimation that Beverly Carlysle had known more than she had disclosed\nhe presented a dogged front of opposition. After a time Bassett put the\npapers away and essayed more general conversation, and there he found\nhimself met half way and more. He began to get Dick as a man, for the\nfirst time, and as a strong man. He watched his quiet, lined face, and\nsurmised behind it depths of tenderness and gentleness. No wonder the\nlittle Wheeler girl had worshipped him.\n\nIt was settled that Dick was to spend the night there, and such plans\nas he had Bassett left until morning. But while he was unfolding the\nbed-lounge on which Dick was to sleep, Dick opened a line of discussion\nthat cost the reporter an hour or two's sleep before he could suppress\nhis irritation.\n\n\"I must have caused you considerable outlay, one way and another,\" he\nsaid. \"I want to defray that, Bassett, as soon as I've figured out some\nway to get at my bank account.\"\n\nBassett jerked out a pillow and thumped it.\n\n\"Forget it.\" Then he grinned. \"You can fix that when you get your\nestate, old man. Buy a newspaper and let me run it!\"\n\nHe bent over the davenport and put the pillow in place. \"All you'll have\nto do is to establish your identity. The institutions that got it had to\ngive bond. I hope you're not too long for this bed.\"\n\nBut he looked up at Dick's silence, to see him looking at him with a\nfaint air of amusement over his pipe.\n\n\"They're going to keep the money, Bassett.\"\n\nBassett straightened and stared at him.\n\n\"Don't be a damned fool,\" he protested. \"It's your money. Don't tell me\nyou're going to give it to suffering humanity. That sort of drivel makes\nme sick. Take it, give it away if you like, but for God's sake don't\nshirk your job.\"\n\nDick got up and took a turn or two around the room. Then, after an old\nhabit, he went to the window and stood looking out, but seeing nothing.\n\n\"It's not that, Bassett. I'm afraid of the accursed thing. I might talk\na lot of rot about wanting to work with my hands. I wouldn't if I didn't\nhave to, any more than the next fellow. I might fool myself, too, with\nthinking I could work better without any money worries. But I've got to\nremember this. It took work to make a man of me before, and it will take\nwork to keep me going the way I intend to go, if I get my freedom.\"\n\nSometime during the night Bassett saw that the light was still burning\nby the davenport, and went in. Dick was asleep with a volume of Whitman\nopen on his chest, and Bassett saw what he had been reading.\n\n\"You broken resolutions, you racking angers, you short-lived ennuis; Ah,\nthink not you shall finally triumph, my real self has yet to come forth.\nIt shall march forth over-mastering, till all lie beneath me, It shall\nstand up, the soldier of unquestioned victory.\"\n\nBassett took the book away and stood rereading the paragraph. For the\nfirst time he sensed the struggle going on at that time behind Dick's\nquiet face, and he wondered. Unquestioned victory, eh? That was a pretty\nlarge order.\n\n\n\n\nXL\n\nLeslie Ward had found the autumn extremely tedious. His old passion for\nNina now and then flamed up in him, but her occasional coquetries no\nlonger deceived him. They had their source only in her vanity. She\nexacted his embraces only as tribute to her own charm, her youth, her\nfresh young body.\n\nAnd Nina out of her setting of gaiety, of a thumping piano, of\nchattering, giggling crowds, of dancing and bridge and theater boxes,\nwas a queen dethroned. She did not read or think. She spent the leisure\nof her mourning period in long hours before her mirror fussing with her\nhair, in trimming and retrimming hats, or in the fastidious care of her\nhands and body.\n\nHe was ashamed sometimes of his pitilessly clear analysis of her. She\nwas not discontented, save at the enforced somberness of their lives.\nShe had found in marriage what she wanted; a good house, daintily\nserved; a man to respond to her attractions as a woman, and to provide\nfor her needs as a wife; dignity and an established place in the world;\nliberty and privilege.\n\nBut she was restless. She chafed at the quiet evenings they spent at\nhome, and resented the reading in which he took refuge from her uneasy\nfidgeting.\n\n\"For Heaven's sake, Nina, sit down and read or sew, or do something.\nYou've been at that window a dozen times.\"\n\n\"I'm not bothering you. Go on and read.\"\n\nWhen nobody dropped in she would go upstairs and spend the hour or so\nbefore bedtime in the rites of cold cream, massage, and in placing the\nlittle combs of what Leslie had learned was called a water-wave.\n\nBut her judgment was as clear as his, and even more pitiless; the\ndifference between them lay in the fact that while he rebelled, she\naccepted the situation. She was cleverer than he was; her mind worked\nmore quickly, and she had the adaptability he lacked. If there were\ntimes when she wearied him, there were others when he sickened her.\nAcross from her at the table he ate slowly and enormously. He splashed\nher dainty bathroom with his loud, gasping cold baths. He flung his\nsoiled clothing anywhere. He drank whisky at night and crawled into the\nlavender-scented sheets redolent of it, to drop into a heavy sleep and\nsnore until she wanted to scream. But she played the game to the limit\nof her ability.\n\nThen, seeing that they might go on the rocks, he made a valiant effort,\nand since she recognized it as an effort, she tried to meet him half\nway. They played two-handed card games. He read aloud to her, poetry\nwhich she loathed, and she to him, short stories he hated. He suggested\ncountry walks and she agreed, to limp back after a half mile or so in\nher high-heeled pumps.\n\nHe concealed his boredom from her, but there were nights when he lay\nawake long after she was asleep and looked ahead into a future of\nunnumbered blank evenings. He had formerly taken an occasional evening\nat his club, but on his suggesting it now Nina's eyes would fill\nwith suspicion, and he knew that although she never mentioned Beverly\nCarlysle, she would neither forget nor entirely trust him again. And in\nhis inner secret soul he knew that she was right.\n\nHe had thought that he had buried that brief madness, but there\nwere times when he knew he lied to himself. One fiction, however, he\npersisted in; he had not been infatuated with Beverly. It was only that\nshe gave him during those few days something he had not found at home,\ncompanionship and quiet intelligent talk. She had been restful. Nina was\nnever restful.\n\nHe bought a New York paper daily, and read it in the train. \"The Valley\"\nhad opened to success in New York, and had settled for a long run. The\nreviews of her work had been extraordinary, and when now and then she\ngave an interview he studied the photographs accompanying it. But he\nnever carried the paper home.\n\nHe began, however, to play with the thought of going to New York. He\nwould not go to see her at her house, but he would like to see her\nbefore a metropolitan audience, to add his mite to her triumph. There\nwere times when he fully determined to go, when he sat at his desk\nwith his hand on the telephone, prepared to lay the foundations of\nthe excursion by some manipulation of business interests. For months,\nhowever, he never went further than the preliminary movement.\n\nBut by October he began to delude himself with a real excuse for going,\nand this was the knowledge that by a strange chain of circumstance\nthis woman who so dominated his secret thoughts was connected with\nElizabeth's life through Judson Clark. The discovery, communicated to\nhim by Walter Wheeler, that Dick was Clark had roused in him a totally\ndifferent feeling from Nina's. He saw no glamour of great wealth. On the\ncontrary, he saw in Clark the author of a great unhappiness to a woman\nwho had not deserved it. And Nina, judging him with deadly accuracy,\nsurmised even that.\n\nThat he was jealous of Judson Clark, and of his part in the past,\nhe denied to himself absolutely. But his resentment took the form of\nviolent protest to the family, against even allowing Elizabeth to have\nanything to do with Dick if he turned up.\n\n\"He'll buy his freedom, if he isn't dead,\" he said to Nina, \"and he'll\ncome snivelling back here, with that lost memory bunk, and they're just\nfool enough to fall for it.\"\n\n\"I've fallen for it, and I'm at least as intelligent as you are.\"\n\nBefore her appraising eyes his own fell.\n\n\"Suppose I did something I shouldn't and turned up here with such a\nstory, would you believe it?\"\n\n\"No. When you want to do something you shouldn't you don't appear to\nneed any excuse.\"\n\nBut, on the whole, they managed to live together comfortably enough.\nThey each had their reservations, but especially after Jim's death they\ntacitly agreed to stop bickering and to make their mutual concessions.\nWhat Nina never suspected was that he corresponded with Beverly\nCarlysle. Not that the correspondence amounted to much. He had sent her\nflowers the night of the New York opening, with the name of his club on\nhis card, and she wrote there in acknowledgment. Then, later, twice\nhe sent her books, one a biography, which was a compromise with his\nconscience, and later a volume of exotic love verse, which was not. As\nhe replied to her notes of thanks a desultory correspondence had sprung\nup, letters which the world might have read, and yet which had to him\nthe savor and interest of the clandestine.\n\nHe did not know that that, and not infatuation, was behind his desire to\nsee Beverly again; never reasoned that he was demonstrating to himself\nthat his adventurous love life was not necessarily ended; never\nacknowledged that the instinct of the hunter was as alive in him as\nin the days before his marriage. Partly, then, a desire for adventure,\npartly a hope that romance was not over but might still be waiting\naround the next corner, was behind his desire to see her again.\n\nProbably Nina knew that, as she knew so many things; why he had taken to\nreading poetry, for instance. Certain it is that when he began, early in\nOctober, to throw out small tentative remarks about the necessity of a\nbusiness trip before long to New York, she narrowed her eyes. She\nwas determined to go with him, if he went at all, and he was equally\ndetermined that she should not.\n\nIt became, in a way, a sort of watchful waiting on both sides. Then\nthere came a time when some slight excuse offered, and Leslie took up\nthe shuttle for forty-eight hours, and wove his bit in the pattern. It\nhappened to be on the same evening as Dick's return to the old house.\n\nHe was a little too confident, a trifle too easy to Nina.\n\n\"Has the handle of my suitcase been repaired yet?\" he asked. He was\nlighting a cigarette at the time.\n\n\"Yes. Why?\"\n\n\"I'll have to run over to New York to-morrow. I wanted Joe to go alone,\nbut he thinks he needs me.\" Joe was his partner. \"Oh. So Joe's going?\"\n\n\"That's what I said.\"\n\nShe was silent. Joe's going was clever of him. It gave authenticity to\nhis business, and it kept her at home.\n\n\"How long shall you be gone?\"\n\n\"Only a day or two.\" He could not entirely keep the relief out of his\nvoice. It had been easy, incredibly easy. He might have done it a month\nago. And he had told the truth; Joe was going.\n\n\"I'll pack to-night, and take my suitcase in with me in the morning.\"\n\n\"If you'll get your things out I'll pack them.\" She was still thinking,\nbut her tone was indifferent. \"You won't want your dress clothes, of\ncourse.\"\n\n\"I'd better have a dinner suit.\"\n\nShe looked at him then, with a half contemptuous smile. \"Yes,\" she said\nslowly. \"I suppose you will. You'll be going to the theater.\"\n\nHe glanced away.\n\n\"Possibly. But we'll be rushing to get through. There's a lot to do.\nAmazing how business piles up when you find you're going anywhere. There\nwon't be much time to play.\"\n\nShe sat before the mirror in her small dressing-room that night,\nostensibly preparing for bed but actually taking stock of her situation.\nShe had done all she could, had been faithful and loyal, had made\nhis home attractive, had catered to his tastes and tried to like his\nfriends, had met his needs and responded to them. And now, this. She was\nbewildered and frightened. How did women hold their husbands?\n\nShe found him in bed and unmistakably asleep when she went into the\nbedroom. Man-like, having got his way, he was not troubled by doubts or\nintrospection. It was done.\n\nHe was lying on his back, with his mouth open. She felt a sudden and\nviolent repugnance to getting into the bed beside him. Sometime in the\nnight he would turn over and throwing his arm about her, hold her close\nin his sleep; and it would be purely automatic, the mechanical result of\nhabit.\n\nShe lay on the edge of the bed and thought things over.\n\nHe had his good qualities. He was kind and affectionate to her family.\nHe had been wonderful when Jim died, and he loved Elizabeth dearly. He\nwas generous and open-handed. He was handsome, too, in a big, heavy way.\n\nShe began to find excuses for him. Men were always a child-like prey\nto some women. They were vain, and especially they were sex-vain; good\nlooking men were a target for every sort of advance. She transferred her\nloathing of him to the woman she suspected of luring him away from her,\nand lay for hours hating her.\n\nShe saw Leslie off in the morning with a perfunctory good-bye while cold\nanger and suspicion seethed in her. And later she put on her hat and\nwent home to lay the situation before her mother. Mrs. Wheeler was out,\nhowever, and she found only Elizabeth sewing by her window.\n\nNina threw her hat on the bed and sat down dispiritedly.\n\n\"I suppose there's no news?\" she asked.\n\nNina watched her. She was out of patience with Elizabeth, exasperated\nwith the world.\n\n\"Are you going to go on like this all your life?\" she demanded. \"Sitting\nby a window, waiting? For a man who ran away from you?\"\n\n\"That's not true, and you know it.\"\n\n\"They're all alike,\" Nina declared recklessly. \"They go along well\nenough, and they are all for virtue and for the home and fireside stuff,\nuntil some woman comes their way. I ought to know.\"\n\nElizabeth looked up quickly.\n\n\"Why, Nina!\" she said. \"You don't mean--\"\n\n\"He went to New York this morning. He pretended to be going on business,\nbut he's actually gone to see that actress. He's been mad about her for\nmonths.\"\n\n\"I don't believe it.\"\n\n\"Oh, wake up,\" Nina said impatiently. \"The world isn't made up of\ngood, kind, virtuous people. It's rotten. And men are all alike. Dick\nLivingstone and Les and all the rest--tarred with the same stick. As\nlong as there are women like this Carlysle creature they'll fall for\nthem. And you and I can sit at home and chew our nails and plan to keep\nthem by us. And we can't do it.\"\n\nIn spite of herself a little question of doubt crept that day into\nElizabeth's mind. She had always known that they had not told her all\nthe truth; that the benevolent conspiracy to protect Dick extended even\nto her. But she had never thought that it might include a woman. Once\nthere, the very humility of her love for Dick was an element in favor of\nthe idea. She had never been good enough, or wise or clever enough, for\nhim. She was too small and unimportant to be really vital.\n\nDismissing the thought did no good. It came back. But because she was\na healthy-minded and practical person she took the one course she could\nthink of, and put the question that night to her father, when he came\nback from seeing David.\n\nDavid had sent for him early in the evening. All day he had thought\nover the situation between Dick and Elizabeth, with growing pain and\nuneasiness. He had not spoken of it to Lucy, or to Harrison Miller; he\nknew that they would not understand, and that Lucy would suffer. She was\nbewildered enough by Dick's departure.\n\nAt noon he had insisted on getting up and being helped into his\ntrousers. So clad he felt more of a man and better able to cope with\nthings, although his satisfaction in them was somewhat modified by the\nknowledge of two safety-pins at the sides, to take up their superfluous\ngirth at the waistband.\n\nBut even the sense of being clothed as a man again did not make it\neasier to say to Walter Wheeler what must be said.\n\nWalter took the news of Dick's return with a visible brightening. It was\nas though, out of the wreckage of his middle years, he saw that there\nwas now some salvage, but he was grave and inarticulate over it, wrung\nDavid's hand and only said:\n\n\"Thank God for it, David.\" And after a pause: \"Was he all right? He\nremembered everything?\"\n\nBut something strange in the situation began to obtrude itself into his\nmind. Dick had come back twenty-four hours ago. Last night. And all this\ntime--\n\n\"Where is he now?\"\n\n\"He's not here, Walter.\"\n\n\"He has gone away again, without seeing Elizabeth?\"\n\nDavid cleared his throat.\n\n\"He is still a fugitive. He doesn't himself know he isn't guilty. I\nthink he feels that he ought not to see her until--\"\n\n\"Come, come,\" Walter Wheeler said impatiently. \"Don't try to find\nexcuses for him. Let's have the truth, David. I guess I can stand it.\"\n\nPoor David, divided between his love for Dick and his native honesty,\nthrew out his hands.\n\n\"I don't understand it, Wheeler,\" he said. \"You and I wouldn't, I\nsuppose. We are not the sort to lose the world for a woman. The plain\ntruth is that there is not a trace of Judson Clark in him to-day, save\none. That's the woman.\"\n\nWhen Wheeler said nothing, but sat twisting his hat in his hands, David\nwent on. It might be only a phase. As its impression on Dick's youth\nhad been deeper than others, so its effect was more lasting. It might\ngradually disappear. He was confident, indeed, that it would. He had\nbeen reading on the subject all day.\n\nWalter Wheeler hardly heard him. He was facing the incredible fact, and\nstruggling with his own problem. After a time he got up, shook hands\nwith David and went home, the dog at his heels.\n\nDuring the evening that followed he made his resolution, not to tell\nher, never to let her suspect the truth. But he began to wonder if she\nhad heard something, for he found her eyes on him more than once, and\nwhen Margaret had gone up to bed she came over and sat on the arm of his\nchair. She said an odd thing then, and one that made it impossible to\nlie to her later.\n\n\"I come to you, a good bit as I would go to God, if he were a person,\"\nshe said. \"I have got to know something, and you can tell me.\"\n\nHe put his arm around her and held her close.\n\n\"Go ahead, honey.\"\n\n\"Daddy, do you realize that I am a woman now?\"\n\n\"I try to. But it seems about six months since I was feeding you hot\nwater for colic.\"\n\nShe sat still for a moment, stroking his hair and being very careful not\nto spoil his neat parting.\n\n\"You have never told me all about Dick, daddy. You have always kept\nsomething back. That's true, isn't it?\"\n\n\"There were details,\" he said uncomfortably. \"It wasn't necessary--\"\n\n\"Here's what I want to know. If he has gone back to the time--you know,\nwouldn't he go back to caring for the people he loved then?\" Then,\nsuddenly, her childish appeal ceased, and she slid from the chair and\nstood before him. \"I must know, father. I can bear it. The thing you\nhave been keeping from me was another woman, wasn't it?\"\n\n\"It was so long ago,\" he temporized. \"Think of it, Elizabeth. A boy of\ntwenty-one or so.\"\n\n\"Then there was?\"\n\n\"I believe so, at one time. But I know positively that he hadn't seen or\nheard from her in ten years.\"\n\n\"What sort of woman?\"\n\n\"I wouldn't think about it, honey. It's all so long ago.\"\n\n\"Did she live in Wyoming?\"\n\n\"She was an actress,\" he said, hard driven by her persistence.\n\n\"Do you know her name?\"\n\n\"Only her stage name, honey.\"\n\n\"But you know she was an actress!\"\n\nHe sighed.\n\n\"All right, dear,\" he said. \"I'll tell you all I know. She was an\nactress, and she married another man. That's all there is to it. She's\nnot young now. She must be thirty now--if she's living,\" he added, as an\nafterthought.\n\nIt was some time before she spoke again.\n\n\"I suppose she was beautiful,\" she said slowly.\n\n\"I don't know. Most of them aren't, off the stage. Anyhow, what does it\nmatter now?\"\n\n\"Only that I know he has gone back to her. And you know it too.\"\n\nHe heard her going quietly out of the room.\n\nLong after, he closed the house and went cautiously upstairs. She was\nwaiting for him in the doorway of her room, in her nightgown.\n\n\"I know it all now,\" she said steadily. \"It was because of her he shot\nthe other man, wasn't it?\"\n\nShe saw her answer in his startled face, and closed her door quickly. He\nstood outside, and then he tapped lightly.\n\n\"Let me in, honey,\" he said. \"I want to finish it. You've got a wrong\nidea about it.\"\n\nWhen she did not answer he tried the door, but it was locked. He turned\nand went downstairs again...\n\nWhen he came home the next afternoon Margaret met him in the hall.\n\n\"She knows it, Walter.\"\n\n\"Knows what?\"\n\n\"Knows he was back here and didn't see her. Annie blurted it out; she'd\ngot it from the Oglethorpe's laundress. Mr. Oglethorpe saw him on the\nstreet.\"\n\nIt took him some time to drag a coherent story from her. Annie had\ntold Elizabeth in her room, and then had told Margaret. She had gone to\nElizabeth at once, to see what she could do, but Elizabeth had been in\nher closet, digging among her clothes. She had got out her best frock\nand put it on, while her mother sat on the bed not even daring to broach\nthe matter in her mind, and had gone out. There was a sort of cold\ndetermination in her that frightened Margaret. She had laughed a good\nbit, for one thing.\n\n\"She's terribly proud,\" she finished. \"She'll do something reckless,\nI'm sure. It wouldn't surprise me to see her come back engaged to Wallie\nSayre. I think that's where she went.\"\n\nBut apparently she had not, or if she had she said nothing about it.\nFrom that time on they saw a change in her; she was as loving as ever,\nbut she affected a sort of painful brightness that was a little hard. As\nthough she had clad herself in armor against further suffering.\n\n\n\n\nXLI\n\nFor months Beverly Carlysle had remained a remote and semi-mysterious\nfigure. She had been in some hearts and in many minds, but to most of\nthem she was a name only. She had been the motive behind events she\nnever heard of, the quiet center in a tornado of emotions that circled\nabout without touching her.\n\nOn the whole she found her life, with the settling down of the piece to\na successful, run, one of prosperous monotony. She had re-opened and was\nliving in the 56th Street house, keeping a simple establishment of\ncook, butler and maid, and in the early fall she added a town car and a\ndriver. After that she drove out every afternoon except on matinee days,\nalmost always alone, but sometimes with a young girl from the company.\n\nShe was very lonely. The kaleidoscope that is theatrical New York\nhad altered since she left it. Only one or two of her former friends\nremained, and she found them uninteresting and narrow with the\nnarrowness of their own absorbing world. She had forgotten that the\ntheater was like an island, cut off from the rest of the world, having\nits own politics, its own society divided by caste, almost its own\nreligion. Out of its insularity it made occasional excursions to dinners\nand week-ends; even into marriage, now and then with an outlander. But\nalmost always it went back, eager for its home of dressing-room and\nfootlights, of stage entrances up dirty alleys, of door-keepers and\nmanagers and parts and costumes.\n\nOccasionally she had callers, men she had met or who were brought to\nsee her. She saw them over a tea-table, judged them remorselessly, and\neliminated gradually all but one or two. She watched her dignity and her\nreputation with the care of an ambitious woman trying to live down the\npast, and she succeeded measurably well. Now and then a critic spoke of\nher as a second Maude Adams, and those notices she kept and treasured.\n\nBut she was always uneasy. Never since the night he had seen Judson\nClark in the theater had they rung up without her brother having\ncarefully combed the house with his eyes. She knew her limitations; they\nwould have to ring down if she ever saw him over the footlights. And\nthe season had brought its incidents, to connect her with the past. One\nnight Gregory had come back and told her Jean Melis was in the balcony.\n\nThe valet was older and heavier, but he had recognized him.\n\n\"Did he see you?\" was her first question.\n\n\"Yes. What about it? He never saw me but once, and that was at night and\nout of doors.\"\n\n\"Sometimes I think I can't stand it, Fred. The eternal suspense, the\nwaiting for something to happen.\"\n\n\"If anything was going to happen it would have happened months ago.\nBassett has given it up. And Jud's dead. Even Wilkins knows that.\"\n\nShe turned on him angrily.\n\n\"You haven't a heart, have you? You're glad he's dead.\"\n\n\"Not at all. As long as he kept under cover he was all right. But if he\nis, I don't see why you should fool yourself into thinking you're sorry.\nIt's the best solution to a number of things.\"\n\n\"What do you suppose brought Jean Melis here?\"\n\n\"What? To see the best play in New York. Besides, why not allow the man\na healthy curiosity? He was pretty closely connected with a hectic part\nof your life, my dear. Now buck up, and for the Lord's sake forget the\nFrenchman. He's got nothing.\"\n\n\"He saw me that night, on the stairs. He never took his eyes off me at\nthe inquest.\"\n\nShe gave, however, an excellent performance that night, and nothing more\nwas heard of the valet.\n\nThere were other alarms, all of them without foundation. She went on her\nway, rejected an offer or two of marriage, spent her mornings in bed and\nher afternoons driving or in the hands of her hair-dresser and manicure,\ncared for the flowers that came in long casket-like boxes, and began\nto feel a sense of security again. She did not intend to marry, or to\nbecome interested in any one man.\n\nShe had hardly given a thought to Leslie Ward. He had come and gone,\none of that steady procession of men, mostly married, who battered their\nheads now and then like night beetles outside a window, against the hard\nglass of her ambition. Because her business was to charm, she had been\ncharming to him. And could not always remember his name!\n\nAs the months went by she began to accept Fred's verdict that nothing\nwas going to happen. Bassett was back and at work. Either dead or a\nfugitive somewhere was Judson Clark, but that thought she had to keep\nout of her mind. Sometimes, as the play went on, and she was able to\nmake her solid investments out of it, she wondered if her ten years of\nretirement had been all the price she was to pay for his ruin; but\nshe put that thought away too, although she never minimized her\nresponsibility when she faced it.\n\nBut her price had been heavy at that. She was childless and alone,\nlavishing her aborted maternity on a brother who was living his\nprosperous, cheerful and not too moral life at her expense. Fred was,\nshe knew, slightly drunk with success; he attended to his minimum of\nlabor with the least possible effort, had an expensive apartment on the\nDrive, and neglected her except, when he needed money. She began to see,\nas other women had seen before her, that her success had, by taking away\nthe necessity for initiative, been extremely bad for him.\n\nThat was the situation when, one night late in October, the trap of\nBassett's devising began to close in. It had been raining, but in spite\nof that they had sold standing room to the fire limit. Having got the\ntreasurer's report on the night's business and sent it to Beverly's\ndressing-room, Gregory wandered into his small, low-ceiled office\nunder the balcony staircase, and closing the door sat down. It was the\ninterval after the second act, and above the hum of voices outside the\nsound of the orchestra penetrated faintly.\n\nHe was entirely serene. He had a supper engagement after the show,\nhe had a neat car waiting outside to take him to it, and the night's\nbusiness had been extraordinary. He consulted his watch and then picked\nup an evening paper. A few moments later he found himself reading over\nand over a small notice inserted among the personals.\n\n\"Personal: Jean Melis, who was in Norada, Wyoming, during the early fall\nof 1911 please communicate with L 22, this office.\"\n\nThe orchestra was still playing outside; the silly, giggling crowds were\nmoving back to their seats, and somewhere Jean Melis, or the friends of\nJean Melis, who would tell him of it, were reading that message.\n\nHe got his hat and went out, forgetful of the neat car at the curb, of\nthe supper engagement, of the night's business, and wandered down the\nstreet through the rain. But his first uneasiness passed quickly. He\nsaw Bassett in the affair, and probably Clark himself, still living\nand tardily determined to clear his name. But if the worst came to the\nworst, what could they do? They could go only so far, and then they\nwould have to quit.\n\nIt would be better, however, if they did not see Melis. Much better;\nthere was no use involving a simple situation. And Bev could be kept out\nof it altogether, until it was over. Ashamed of his panic he went back\nto the theater, got a railway schedule and looked up trains. He should\nhave done it long before, he recognized, have gone to Bassett in the\nspring. But how could he have known then that Bassett was going to make\na life-work of the case?\n\nHe had only one uncertainty. Suppose that Bassett had learned about\nClifton Hines?\n\nBy the time the curtain rang down on the last act he was his dapper,\ndebonair self again, made his supper engagement, danced half the night,\nand even dozed a little on the way home. But he slept badly and was up\nearly, struggling with the necessity for keeping Jean Melis out of the\nway.\n\nHe wondered through what formalities L 22, for instance, would have\nto go in order to secure a letter addressed to him? Whether he had to\npresent a card or whether he walked in demanded his mail and went away.\nThat thought brought another with it. Wasn't it probable that Bassett\nwas in New York, and would call for his mail himself?\n\nHe determined finally to take the chance, claim to be L 22, and if Melis\nhad seen the advertisement and replied, get the letter. It would be easy\nto square it with the valet, by saying that he had recognized him in the\ntheater and that Miss Carlysle wished to send him a box.\n\nHe had small hope of a letter at his first call, unless the Frenchman\nhad himself seen the notice, but his anxiety drove him early to the\noffice. There was nothing there, but he learned one thing. He had to\ngo through with no formalities. The clerk merely looked in a box, said\n\"Nothing here,\" and went on about his business. At eleven o'clock he\nwent back again, and after a careful scrutiny of the crowd presented\nhimself once more.\n\n\"L 22? Here you are.\"\n\nHe had the letter in his hand. He had glanced at it and had thrust it\ndeep in his pocket, when he felt a hand on his shoulder. He wheeled and\nfaced Bassett.\n\n\"I thought I recognized that back,\" said the reporter, cheerfully. \"Come\nover here, old man. I want to talk to you.\"\n\nBut he held to Gregory's shoulder. In a corner Bassett dropped the\nfriendliness he had assumed for the clerk's benefit, and faced him with\ncold anger.\n\n\"I'll have that letter now, Gregory,\" he said. \"And I've got a damned\ngood notion to lodge an information against you.\"\n\n\"I don't know what you're talking about.\"\n\n\"Forget it. I was behind you when you asked for that letter. Give it\nhere. I want to show you something.\"\n\nSuddenly, with the letter in his hand, Bassett laughed and then tore it\nopen. There was only a sheet of blank paper inside.\n\n\"I wasn't sure you'd see it, and I didn't think you'd fall for it if\nyou did,\" he observed. \"But I was pretty sure you didn't want me to see\nMelis. Now I know it.\"\n\n\"Well, I didn't,\" Gregory said sullenly.\n\n\"Just the same, I expect to see him. The day's early yet, and that's\nnot a common name. But I'll take darned good care you don't get any more\nletters from here.\"\n\n\"What do you think Melis can tell you, that you don't know?\"\n\n\"I'll explain that to you some day,\" Bassett said cheerfully. \"Some day\nwhen you are in a more receptive mood than you are now. The point at\nthis moment seems to me to be, what does Melis know that you don't want\nme to know? I suppose you don't intend to tell me.\"\n\n\"Not here. You may believe it or not, Bassett, but I was going to your\ntown to-night to see you.\"\n\n\"Well,\" Bassett said sceptically, \"I've got your word for it. And I've\ngot nothing to do all day but to listen to you.\"\n\nTo his proposition that they go to his hotel Gregory assented sullenly,\nand they moved out to find a taxicab. On the pavement, however, he held\nback.\n\n\"I've got a right to know something,\" he said, \"considering what he's\ndone to me and mine. Clark's alive, I suppose?\"\n\n\"He's alive all right.\"\n\n\"Then I'll trade you, Bassett. I'll come over with what I know, if\nyou'll tell me one thing. What sent him into hiding for ten years, and\nmakes him turn up now, yelling for help?\"\n\nBassett reflected. The offer of a statement from Gregory was valuable,\nbut, on the other hand, he was anxious not to influence his narrative.\nAnd Gregory saw his uncertainty. He planted himself firmly on the\npavement.\n\n\"How about it?\" he demanded.\n\n\"I'll tell you this much, Gregory. He never meant to bring the thing up\nagain. In a way, it's me you're up against. Not Clark. And you can be\npretty sure I know what I'm doing. I've got Clark, and I've got the\nreport of the coroner's inquest, and I'll get Melis. I'm going to get to\nthe bottom of this if I have to dig a hole that buries me.\"\n\nIn a taxicab Gregory sat tense and erect, gnawing at his blond mustache.\nAfter a time he said:\n\n\"What are you after, in all this? The story, I suppose. And the money. I\ndaresay you're not doing it for love.\"\n\nBassett surveyed him appraisingly.\n\n\"You wouldn't understand my motives if I told you. As a matter of fact,\nhe doesn't want the money.\"\n\nGregory sneered.\n\n\"Don't kid yourself,\" he said. \"However, as a matter of fact I don't\nthink he'll take it. It might cost too much. Where is he? Shooting pills\nagain?\"\n\n\"You'll see him in about five minutes.\"\n\nIf the news was a surprise Gregory gave no evidence of it, except to\ncomment:\n\n\"You're a capable person, aren't you? I'll bet you could tune a piano if\nyou were put to it.\"\n\nHe carried the situation well, the reporter had to admit; the only\nevidence he gave of strain was that the hands with which he lighted a\ncigarette were unsteady. He surveyed the obscure hotel at which the cab\nstopped with a sneering smile, and settled his collar as he looked it\nover.\n\n\"Not advertising to the world that you're in town, I see.\"\n\n\"We'll do that, just as soon as we're ready. Don't worry.\"\n\nThe laugh he gave at that struck unpleasantly on Bassett's ears. But\ninside the building he lost some of his jauntiness. \"Queer place to find\nJudson Clark,\" he said once.\n\nAnd again:\n\n\"You'd better watch him when I go in. He may bite me.\"\n\nTo which Bassett grimly returned: \"He's probably rather particular what\nhe bites.\"\n\nHe was uneasily conscious that Gregory, while nervous and tense, was\ncarrying the situation with a certain assurance. If he was acting it was\nvery good acting. And that opinion was strengthened when he threw open\nthe door and Gregory advanced into the room.\n\n\"Well, Clark,\" he said, coolly. \"I guess you didn't expect to see me,\ndid you?\"\n\nHe made no offer to shake hands as Dick turned from the window, nor\ndid Dick make any overtures. But there was no enmity at first in either\nface; Gregory was easy and assured, Dick grave, and, Bassett thought,\nslightly impatient. From that night in his apartment the reporter had\nrealized that he was constantly fighting a sort of passive resistance in\nDick, a determination not at any cost to involve Beverly. Behind that,\ntoo, he felt that still another battle was going on, one at which he\ncould only guess, but which made Dick somber at times and grimly quiet\nalways.\n\n\"I meant to look you up,\" was his reply to Gregory's nonchalant\ngreeting.\n\n\"Well, your friend here did that for you,\" Gregory said, and smiled\nacross at Bassett. \"He has his own methods, and I'll say they're\neffectual.\"\n\nHe took off his overcoat and flung it on the bed, and threw a swift,\nappraising glance at Dick. It was on Dick that he was banking, not on\nBassett. He hated and feared Bassett. He hated Dick, but he was not\nafraid of him. He lighted a cigarette and faced Dick with a malicious\nsmile.\n\n\"So here we are, again, Jud!\" he said. \"But with this change, that\nnow it's you who are the respectable member of the community, and I'm\nthe--well, we'll call it the butterfly.\"\n\nThere was unmistakable insult in his tone, and Dick caught it.\n\n\"Then I take it you're still living off your sister?\"\n\nThe contempt in Dick's voice whipped the color to Gregory's face and\nclenched his fist. But he relaxed in a moment and laughed.\n\n\"Don't worry, Bassett,\" he said, his eyes on Dick. \"We haven't any\nreason to like each other, but he's bigger than I am. I won't hit him.\"\nThen he hardened his voice. \"But I'll remind you, Clark, that personally\nI don't give a God-damn whether you swing or not. Also that I can keep\nmy mouth shut, walk out of here, and have you in quod in the next hour,\nif I decide to.\"\n\n\"But you won't,\" Bassett said smoothly. \"You won't, any more than you\ndid it last spring, when you sent that little letter of yours to David\nLivingstone.\"\n\n\"No. You're right. I won't. But if I tell you what I came here to say,\nBassett, get this straight. It's not because I'm afraid of you, or of\nhim. Donaldson's dead. What value would Melis's testimony have after ten\nyears, if you put him on the stand? It's not that. It's because you'll\nput your blundering foot into it and ruin Bev's career, unless I tell\nyou the truth.\"\n\nIt was to Bassett then that he told his story, he and Bassett sitting,\nDick standing with his elbow on the mantelpiece, tall and weary and\nalmost detached.\n\n\"I've got to make my own position plain in this,\" he said. \"I didn't\nlike Clark, and I kept her from marrying him. There was one time, before\nshe met Lucas, when she almost did it. I was away when she decided on\nthat fool trip to the Clark ranch. We couldn't get a New York theater\nuntil November, and she had some time, so they went. I've got her story\nof what happened there. You can check it up with what you know.\"\n\nHe turned to Dick for a moment.\n\n\"You were drinking pretty hard that night, but you may remember this:\nShe had quarreled with Lucas at dinner that night and with you. That's\ntrue, isn't it?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"She went to her room and began to pack her things. Then she thought\nit over, and she decided to try to persuade Lucas to go too. Things had\nbegun all right, but they were getting strained and unpleasant. She went\ndown the stairs, and Melis saw her, the valet. The living-room was dark,\nbut there was a light coming through the billiard room door, and against\nit she saw the figure of a man in the doorway. He had his back to her,\nand he had a revolver in his hand. She ran across the room when he\nheard her and when he turned she saw it was Lucas. Do you remember, Jud,\nhaving a revolver and Lucas taking it from you?\"\n\n\"No. Donaldson testified I'd had a revolver.\"\n\n\"Well, that's how we figure he'd got the gun. She thought at once that\nLucas and you had quarreled, and that he was going to shoot. She tried\nto take it from him, but he was drunk and stubborn. It went off and\nkilled him.\"\n\nBassett leaned forward.\n\n\"That's straight, is it?\"\n\n\"I'm telling you.\"\n\n\"Then why in God's name didn't she say that at the inquest?\"\n\n\"She was afraid it wouldn't be believed. Look at the facts. She'd\nquarreled with Lucas. There had been a notorious situation with regard\nto Clark. And remember this. She had done it. I know her well enough,\nhowever, to say that she would have confessed, eventually, but Clark\nhad beaten it. It was reasonably sure that he was lost in the blizzard.\nYou've got to allow for that.\"\n\nBassett said nothing. After a silence Dick spoke:\n\n\"What about the revolver?\"\n\n\"She had it in her hand. She dropped it and stood still, too stunned to\nscream. Lucas, she says, took a step or two forward, and fell through\nthe doorway. Donaldson came running in, and you know the rest.\"\n\nBassett was the first to break the silence.\n\n\"She will be willing to testify to that now, of course?\"\n\n\"And stand trial?\"\n\n\"Not necessarily. Clark would be on trial. He's been indicted. He has to\nbe tried.\"\n\n\"Why does he have to be tried? He's free now. He's been free for ten\nyears. And I tell you as an honest opinion that the thing would kill\nher. Accident and all, she did it. And there would be some who'd never\nbelieve she hadn't tired of Lucas, and wanted the Clark money.\"\n\n\"That's a chance she'll have to take,\" Bassett said doggedly. \"The only\nliving witness who could be called would be the valet. And remember\nthis: for ten years he has believed that she did it. He'll have built up\na story by this time, perhaps unconsciously, that might damn her.\"\n\nDick moved.\n\n\"There's only one thing to do. You're right, Gregory. I'll never expose\nher to that.\"\n\n\"You're crazy,\" Bassett said angrily.\n\n\"Not at all. I told you I wouldn't hide behind a woman. As a matter of\nfact, I've learned what I wanted. Lucas wasn't murdered. I didn't shoot\nhim. That's what really matters. I'm no worse off than I was before;\nconsiderably better, in fact. And I don't see what's to be gained by\ngoing any further.\"\n\nIn spite of his protests, Bassett was compelled finally to agree. He was\nsulky and dispirited. He saw the profound anticlimax to all his effort\nof Dick wandering out again, legally dead and legally guilty, and he\nswore roundly under his breath.\n\n\"All right,\" he grunted at last. \"I guess that's the last word, Gregory.\nBut you tell her from me that if she doesn't reopen the matter of her\nown accord, she'll have a man's life on her conscience.\"\n\n\"I'll not tell her anything about it. I'm not only her brother; I'm her\nmanager now. And I'm not kicking any hole in the boat that floats me.\"\n\nHe was self-confident and slightly insolent; the hands with which he\nlighted a fresh cigarette no longer trembled, and the glance he threw at\nDick was triumphant and hostile.\n\n\"As a man sows, Clark!\" he said. \"You sowed hell for a number of people\nonce.\"\n\nBassett had to restrain an impulse to kick him out of the door. When he\nhad gone Bassett turned to Dick with assumed lightness.\n\n\"Well,\" he said, \"here we are, all dressed up and nowhere to go!\"\n\nHe wandered around the room, restless and disappointed. He knew, and\nDick knew, that they had come to the end of the road, and that nothing\nlay beyond. In his own unpleasant way Fred Gregory had made a case for\nhis sister that tied their hands, and the crux of the matter had lain\nin his final gibe: \"As a man sows, Clark, so shall he reap.\" The moral\nissue was there.\n\n\n\"I suppose the Hines story goes by the board, eh?\" he commented after a\npause.\n\n\"Yes. Except that I wish I'd known about him when I could have done\nsomething. He's my half-brother, any way you look at it, and he had a\nrotten deal. Sometimes a man sows,\" he added, with a wry smile, \"and the\nother fellow reaps.\"\n\nBassett went out after that, going to the office on the chance of a\nletter from Melis, but there was none. When he came back he found Dick\nstanding over a partially packed suitcase, and knew that they had come\nto the end of the road indeed.\n\n\"What's the next step?\" he asked bluntly.\n\n\"I'll have to leave here. It's too expensive.\"\n\n\"And after that, what?\"\n\n\"I'll get a job. I suppose a man is as well hidden here as anywhere. I\ncan grow a beard-that's the usual thing, isn't it?\"\n\nBassett made an impatient gesture, and fell to pacing the floor. \"It's\nincredible,\" he said. \"It's monstrous. It's a joke. Here you are,\nwithout a thing against you, and hung like Mahomet's coffin between\nheaven and earth. It makes me sick.\"\n\nHe went home that night, leaving word to have any letters for L 22\nforwarded, but without much hope. His last clutch of Dick's hand had a\nsort of desperate finality in it, and he carried with him most of the\nway home the tall, worn and rather shabby figure that saw him off with a\nsmile.\n\nBy the next afternoon's mail he received a note from New York, with a\nfew words of comment penciled on it in Dick's writing. \"This came this\nevening. I sent back the money. D.\" The note was from Gregory and\nhad evidently enclosed a one-hundred dollar bill. It began without\nsuperscription: \"Enclosed find a hundred dollars, as I imagine funds may\nbe short. If I were you I'd get out of here. There has been considerable\nexcitement, and you know too many people in this burg.\"\n\nBassett sat back in his chair and studied the note.\n\n\"Now why the devil did he do that?\" he reflected. He sat for some time,\nthinking deeply, and he came to one important conclusion. The story\nGregory had told was the one which was absolutely calculated to shut\noff all further inquiry. They had had ten years; ten years to plan,\neliminate and construct; ten years to prepare their defense, in case\nClark turned up. Wasn't that why Gregory had been so assured? But he had\nnot been content to let well enough alone; he had perhaps overreached\nhimself.\n\nThen what was the answer? She had killed Lucas, but was it an accident?\nAnd there must have been a witness, or they would have had nothing to\nfear. He wrote out on a bit of paper three names, and sat looking at\nthem:\n\nHattie Thorwald Jean Melis Clifton Hines.\n\n\n\n\nXLII\n\nElizabeth had quite definitely put Dick out of her heart. On the evening\nof the day she learned he had come back and had not seen her, she\ndeliberately killed her love and decently interred it. She burned her\nnotes and his one letter and put away her ring, performing the rites not\nas rites but as a shameful business to be done with quickly. She tore\nhis photograph into bits and threw them into her waste basket, and\nhaving thus housecleaned her room set to work to houseclean her heart.\n\nShe found very little to do. She was numb and totally without feeling.\nThe little painful constriction in her chest which had so often come\nlately with her thoughts of him was gone. She felt extraordinarily\nempty, but not light, and her feet dragged about the room.\n\nShe felt no sense of Dick's unworthiness, but simply that she was up\nagainst something she could not fight, and no longer wanted to fight.\nShe was beaten, but the strange thing was that she did not care. Only,\nshe would not be pitied. As the days went on she resented the pity that\nhad kept her in ignorance for so long, and had let her wear her heart on\nher sleeve; and she even wondered sometimes whether the story of Dick's\nloss of memory had not been false, evolved out of that pity and the\ndesire to save her pain.\n\nDavid sent for her, but she wrote him a little note, formal and\nrestrained. She would come in a day or two, but now she must get her\nbearings. He was, to know that she was not angry, and felt it all for\nthe best, and she was very lovingly his, Elizabeth.\n\nShe knew now that she would eventually marry Wallie Sayre if only to get\naway from pity. He would have to know the truth about her, that she did\nnot love any one; not even her father and her mother. She pretended to\ncare for fear of hurting them, but she was actually frozen quite hard.\nShe did not believe in love. It was a terrible thing, to be avoided\nby any one who wanted to get along, and this avoiding was really quite\nsimple. One simply stopped feeling.\n\nOn the Sunday after she had come to this comfortable knowledge she sat\nin the church as usual, in the choir stalls, and suddenly she hated the\nchurch. She hated the way the larynx of Henry Wallace, the tenor, stuck\nout like a crabapple over his low collar. She hated the fat double chin\nof the bass. She hated the talk about love and the certain rewards of\nvirtue, and the faces of the congregation, smug and sure of salvation.\n\nShe went to the choir master after the service to hand in her\nresignation. And did not, because it had occurred to her that it might\nlook, to use Nina's word, as though she were crushed. Crushed! That was\nfunny.\n\nWallie Sayre was waiting for her outside, and she went up with him to\nlunch, and afterwards they played golf. They had rather an amusing game,\nand once she had to sit down on a bunker and laugh until she was weak,\nwhile he fought his way out of a pit. Crushed, indeed!\n\nSo the weaving went on, almost completed now. With Wallie Sayre biding\nhis time, but fairly sure of the result. With Jean Melis happening on\na two-days' old paper, and reading over and over a notice addressed to\nhim. With Leslie Ward, neither better nor worse than his kind, seeking\nadventure in a bypath, which was East 56th Street. And with Dick\nwandering the streets of New York after twilight, and standing once with\nhis coat collar turned up against the rain outside of the Metropolitan\nClub, where the great painting of his father hung over a mantelpiece.\n\nNow that he was near Beverly, Dick hesitated to see her. He felt no\nresentment at her long silence, nor at his exile which had resulted\nfrom it. He made excuses for her, recognized his own contribution to\nthe catastrophe, knew, too, that nothing was to be gained by seeing her\nagain. But he determined finally to see her once more, and then to go\naway, leaving her to peace and to success.\n\nShe would know now that she had nothing to fear from him. All he wanted\nwas to satisfy the hunger that was in him by seeing her, and then to go\naway.\n\nCuriously, that hunger to see her had been in abeyance while Bassett\nwas with him. It was only when he was alone again that it came up; and\nalthough he knew that, he was unconscious of another fact, that every\nword, every picture of her on the great boardings which walled in every\nempty lot, everything, indeed, which brought her into the reality of the\npresent, loosened by so much her hold on him out of the past.\n\nWhen he finally went to the 56th Street house it was on impulse. He had\nmeant to pass it, but he found himself stopping, and half angrily made\nhis determination. He would follow the cursed thing through now and get\nit over. Perhaps he had discounted it too much in advance, waited too\nlong, hoped too much. Perhaps it was simply that that last phase was\nalready passing. But he felt no thrill, no expectancy, as he rang the\nbell and was admitted to the familiar hall.\n\nIt was peopled with ghosts, for him. Upstairs, in the drawing-room\nthat extended across the front of the house, she had told him of her\nengagement to Howard Lucas. Later on, coming back from Europe, he had\ngone back there to find Lucas installed in the house, his cigars on\nthe table, his photographs on the piano, his books scattered about.\nAnd Lucas himself, smiling, handsome and triumphant on the hearth rug,\ndressed for dinner except for a brocaded dressing-gown, putting his hand\nfamiliarly on Beverly's shoulder, and calling her \"old girl.\"\n\nHe wandered into the small room to the right of the hall, where in other\ndays he had waited to be taken upstairs, and stood looking out of the\nwindow. He heard some one, a caller, come down, get into his overcoat\nin the hall and go out, but he was not interested. He did not know\nthat Leslie Ward had stood outside the door for a minute, had seen and\nrecognized him, and had then slammed out.\n\nHe was quite steady as the butler preceded him up the stairs. He even\nnoticed certain changes in the house, the door at the landing converted\ninto an arch, leaded glass in the dining-room windows beyond it. But\nhe caught a glimpse of himself in a mirror, and saw himself a shabby\ncontrast to the former days.\n\nHe faced her, still with that unexpected composure, and he saw her very\nlittle changed. Even the movement with which she came toward him with\nboth hands out was familiar.\n\n\"Jud!\" she said. \"Oh, my dear!\"\n\nHe saw that she was profoundly moved, and suddenly he was sorry for her.\nSorry for the years behind them both, for the burden she had carried,\nfor the tears in her eyes.\n\n\"Dear old Bev!\" he said.\n\nShe put her head against his shoulder, and cried unrestrainedly; and\nhe held her there, saying small, gentle, soothing things, smoothing her\nhair. But all the time he knew that life had been playing him another\ntrick; he felt a great tenderness for her and profound pity, but he\ndid not love her, or want her. He saw that after all the suffering\nand waiting, the death and exile, he was left at the end with nothing.\nNothing at all.\n\nWhen she was restored to a sort of tense composure he found to his\ndiscomfort that woman-like she intended to abase herself thoroughly and\ncompletely. She implored his forgiveness for his long exile, gazing at\nhim humbly, and when he said in a matter-of-fact tone that he had been\nhappy, giving him a look which showed that she thought he was lying to\nsave her unhappiness.\n\n\"You are trying to make it easier for me. But I know, Jud.\"\n\n\"I'm telling you the truth,\" he said, patiently. \"There's one point I\ndidn't think necessary to tell your brother. For a good while I didn't\nremember anything about it. If it hadn't been for that-well, I don't\nknow. Anyhow, don't look at me as though I willfully saved you. I\ndidn't.\"\n\nShe sat still, pondering that, and twisting a ring on her finger.\n\n\"What do you mean to do?\" she asked, after a pause.\n\n\"I don't know. I'll find something.\"\n\n\"You won't go back to your work?\"\n\n\"I don't see how I can. I'm in hiding, in a sort of casual fashion.\"\n\nTo his intense discomfiture she began to cry again. She couldn't go\nthrough with it. She would go back to Norada and tell the whole thing.\nShe had let Fred influence her, but she saw now she couldn't do it. But\nfor the first time he felt that in this one thing she was not sincere.\nHer grief and abasement had been real enough, but now he felt she was\nacting.\n\n\"Suppose we don't go into that now,\" he said gently. \"You've had about\nall you can stand.\" He got up awkwardly. \"I suppose you are playing\nto-night?\"\n\nShe nodded, looking up at him dumbly.\n\n\"Better lie down, then, and--forget me.\" He smiled down at her.\n\n\"I've never forgotten you, Jud. And now, seeing you again--I--\"\n\nHer face worked. She continued to look up at him, piteously. The\nappalling truth came to him then, and that part of him which had\nremained detached and aloof, watching, almost smiled at the irony. She\ncared for him. Out of her memories she had built up something to care\nfor, something no more himself than she was the woman of his dreams; but\nwith this difference, that she was clinging, woman-fashion, to the thing\nshe had built, and he had watched it crumble before his eyes.\n\n\"Will you promise to go and rest?\"\n\n\"Yes. If you say so.\"\n\nShe was acquiescent and humble. Her eyes were soft, faithful, childlike.\n\n\"I've suffered so, Jud.\"\n\n\"I know.\"\n\n\"You don't hate me, do you?\"\n\n\"Why should I? Just remember this: while you were carrying this burden,\nI was happier than I'd ever been. I'll tell you about it some time.\"\n\nShe got up, and he perceived that she expected him again to take her in\nhis arms. He felt ridiculous and resentful, and rather as though he was\nexpected to kiss the hand that had beaten him, but when she came close\nto him he put an arm around her shoulders.\n\n\"Poor Bev!\" he said. \"We've made pretty much a mess of it, haven't we?\"\n\nHe patted her and let her go, and her eyes followed him as he left the\nroom. The elder brotherliness of that embrace had told her the truth as\nhe could never have hurt her in words. She went back to the chair where\nhe had sat, and leaned her cheek against it.\n\nAfter a time she went slowly upstairs and into her room. When her maid\ncame in she found her before the mirror of her dressing-table, staring\nat her reflection with hard, appraising eyes.\n\nLeslie's partner, wandering into the hotel at six o'clock, found from\nthe disordered condition of the room that Leslie had been back, had\napparently bathed, shaved and made a careful toilet, and gone out again.\nJoe found himself unexpectedly at a loose end. Filled, with suppressed\nindignation he commenced to dress, getting out a shirt, hunting his\nevening studs, and lining up what he meant to say to Leslie over his\ndefection.\n\nThen, at a quarter to seven, Leslie came in, top-hatted and\nmorning-coated, with a yellowing gardenia in his buttonhole and his\nshoes covered with dust.\n\n\"Hello, Les,\" Joe said, glancing up from a laborious struggle with a\nstud. \"Been to a wedding?\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"You look like it.\"\n\n\"I made a call, and since then I've been walking.\"\n\n\"Some walk, I'd say,\" Joe observed, looking at him shrewdly. \"What's\nwrong, Les? Fair one turn you down?\"\n\n\"Go to hell,\" Leslie said irritably.\n\nHe flung off his coat and jerked at his tie. Then, with it hanging\nloose, he turned to Joe.\n\n\"I'm going to tell you something. I know it's safe with you, and I need\nsome advice. I called on a woman this afternoon. You know who she is.\nBeverly Carlysle.\"\n\nJoe whistled softly.\n\n\"That's not the point,\" Leslie declaimed, in a truculent voice. \"I'm not\ndefending myself. She's a friend; I've got a right to call there if I\nwant to.\"\n\n\"Sure you have,\" soothed Joe.\n\n\"Well, you know the situation at home, and who Livingstone actually is.\nThe point is that, while that poor kid at home is sitting around killing\nherself with grief, Clark's gone back to her. To Beverly Carlysle.\"\n\n\"How do you know?\"\n\n\"Know? I saw him this afternoon, at her house.\"\n\nHe sat still, moodily reviewing the situation. His thoughts were a\nchaotic and unpleasant mixture of jealousy, fear of Nina, anxiety over\nElizabeth, and the sense of a lost romantic adventure. After a while he\ngot up.\n\n\"She's a nice kid,\" he said. \"I'm fond of her. And I don't know what to\ndo.\"\n\nSuddenly Joe grinned.\n\n\"I see,\" he said. \"And you can't tell her, or the family, where you saw\nhim!\"\n\n\"Not without raising the deuce of a row.\"\n\nHe began, automatically, to dress for dinner. Joe moved around the room,\nrang for a waiter, ordered orange juice and ice, and produced a bottle\nof gin from his bag. Leslie did not hear him, nor the later preparation\nof the cocktails. He was reflecting bitterly on the fact that a man who\nmarried built himself a wall against romance, a wall, compounded of his\nown new sense of responsibility, of family ties, and fear.\n\nJoe brought him a cocktail.\n\n\"Drink it, old dear,\" he said. \"And when it's down I'll tell you a few\nlittle things about playing around with ladies who have a past. Here's\nto forgetting 'em.\"\n\nLeslie took the glass.\n\n\"Right-o,\" he said.\n\nHe went home the following day, leaving Joe to finish the business in\nNew York. His going rather resembled a flight. Tossing sleepless the\nnight before, he had found what many a man had discovered before him,\nthat his love of clandestine adventure was not as strong as his caution.\nHe had had a shock. True, his affair with Beverly had been a formless\nthing, a matter of imagination and a desire to assure himself that\nromance, for him, was not yet dead. True, too, that he had nothing to\nfear from Dick Livingstone. But the encounter had brought home to him\nthe danger of this old-new game he was playing. He was running like a\nfrightened child.\n\nHe thought of various plans. One of them was to tell Nina the truth,\ntake his medicine of tears and coldness, and then go to Mr. Wheeler.\nOne was to go to Mr. Wheeler, without Nina, and make his humiliating\nadmission. But Walter Wheeler had his own rigid ideas, was\nuncompromising in rectitude, and would understand as only a man could\nthat while so far he had been only mentally unfaithful, he had been\nactuated by at least subconscious desire.\n\nHis own awareness of that fact made him more cautious than he need have\nbeen, perhaps more self-conscious. And he genuinely cared for Elizabeth.\nIt was, on the whole, a generous and kindly impulse that lay behind his\nultimate resolution to tell her that her desertion was both wilful and\ncruel.\n\nYet, when the time came, he found it hard to tell her. He took her for\na drive one evening soon after his return, forcibly driving off Wallie\nSayre to do so, and eying surreptitiously now and then her pale, rather\nset face. He found a quiet lane and stopped the car there, and then\nturned and faced her.\n\n\"How've you been, little sister, while I've been wandering the gay white\nway?\" he asked.\n\n\"I've been all right, Leslie.\"\n\n\"Not quite all right, I think. Have you ever thought, Elizabeth, that no\nman on earth is worth what you've been going through?\"\n\n\"I'm all right, I tell you,\" she said impatiently. \"I'm not grieving any\nmore. That's the truth, Les. I know now that he doesn't intend to come\nback, and I don't care. I never even think about him, now.\"\n\n\"I see,\" he said. \"Well, that's that.\"\n\nBut he had not counted on her intuition, and was startled to hear her\nsay:\n\n\"Well? Go on.\"\n\n\"What do you mean, go on?\"\n\n\"You brought me out here to tell me something.\"\n\n\"Not at all. I simply--\"\n\n\"Where is he? You've seen him.\"\n\nHe tried to meet her eyes, failed, cursed himself for a fool. \"He's\nalive and well, Elizabeth. I saw him in New York.\" It was a full minute\nbefore she spoke again, and then her lips were stiff and her voice\nstrained.\n\n\"Has he gone back to her? To the actress he used to care for?\"\n\nHe hesitated, but he knew he would have to go on.\n\n\"I'm going to tell you something, Elizabeth. It's not very creditable\nto me, but I'll have to trust you. I don't want to see you wasting your\nlife. You've got plenty of courage and a lot of spirit. And you've got\nto forget him.\"\n\nHe told her, and then he took her home. He was a little frightened, for\nthere was something not like her in the way she had taken it, a sort of\nimmobility that might, he thought, cover heartbreak. But she smiled when\nshe thanked him, and went very calmly into the house.\n\nThat night she accepted Wallie Sayre.\n\n\n\n\nXLIII\n\nBassett was having a visitor. He sat in his chair while that visitor\nranged excitedly up and down the room, a short stout man, well dressed\nand with a mixture of servility and importance. The valet's first words,\nas he stood inside the door, had been significant.\n\n\"I should like to know, first, if I am talking to the police.\"\n\n\"No--and yes,\" Bassett said genially. \"Come and sit down, man. What I\nmean is this. I am a friend of Judson Clark's, and this may or may not\nbe a police matter. I don't know yet.\"\n\n\"You are a friend of Mr. Clark's? Then the report was correct. He is\nstill alive, sir?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nThe valet got out a handkerchief and wiped his face. He was clearly\nmoved.\n\n\"I am glad of that. Very glad. I saw some months ago, in a\nnewspaper--where is he?\"\n\n\"In New York. Now Melis, I've an idea that you know something about the\ncrime Judson Clark was accused of. You intimated that at the inquest.\"\n\n\"Mrs. Lucas killed him.\"\n\n\"So she says,\" Bassett said easily.\n\nThe valet jumped and stared.\n\n\"She admits it, as the result of an accident. She also admits hiding the\nrevolver where you found it.\"\n\n\"Then you do not need me.\"\n\n\"I'm not so sure of that.\"\n\nThe valet was puzzled.\n\n\"I want you to think back, Melis. You saw her go down the stairs,\nsometime before the shot. Later you were confident she had hidden the\nrevolver, and you made a second search for it. Why? You hadn't heard her\ntestimony at the inquest then. Clark had run away. Why didn't you think\nClark had done it?\"\n\n\"Because I thought she was having an affair with another man. I have\nalways thought she did it.\"\n\nBassett nodded.\n\n\"I thought so. What made you think that?\"\n\n\"I'll tell you. She went West without a maid, and Mr. Clark got a\nSwedish woman from a ranch near to look after her, a woman named\nThorwald. She lived at her own place and came over every day. One night,\nafter Mrs. Thorwald had started home, I came across her down the road\nnear the irrigator's house, and there was a man with her. They didn't\nhear me behind them, and he was giving her a note for some one in the\nhouse.\"\n\n\"Why not for one of the servants?\"\n\n\"That's what I thought then, sir. It wasn't my business. But I saw the\nsame man later on, hanging about the place at night, and once I saw\nher with him--Mrs. Lucas, I mean. That was in the early evening. The\ngentlemen were out riding, and I'd gone with one of the maids to a hill\nto watch the moon rise. They were on some rocks, below in the canyon.\"\n\n\"Did you see him?\"\n\n\"I think it was the same man, if that's what you mean. I knew something\nqueer was going on, after that, and I watched her. She went out at night\nmore than once. Then I told Donaldson there was somebody hanging round\nthe place, and he set a watch.\"\n\n\"Fine. Now we'll go to the night Lucas was shot. Was the Thorwald woman\nthere?\"\n\n\"She had started home.\"\n\n\"Leaving Mrs. Lucas packing alone?\"\n\n\"Yes. I hadn't thought of that. The Thorwald woman heard the shot and\ncame back. I remember that, because she fainted upstairs and I had to\ncarry her to a bed.\"\n\n\"I see. Now about the revolver.\"\n\n\"I located it the first time I looked for it. Donaldson and the others\nhad searched the billiard room. So I tried the big room. It was under\na chair. I left it there, and concealed myself in the room. She, Mrs.\nLucas, came down late that night and hunted for it. Then she hid it\nwhere I got it later.\"\n\n\"I wish I knew, Melis, why you didn't bring those facts out at the\ninquest.\"\n\n\"You must remember this, sir. I had been with Mr. Clark for a long time.\nI knew the situation. And I thought that he had gone away that night\nto throw suspicion from her to himself. I was not certain what to do. I\nwould have told it all in court, but it never came to trial.\"\n\nBassett was satisfied and fairly content. After the Frenchman's\ndeparture he sat for some time, making careful notes and studying them.\nSupposing the man Melis had seen to be Clifton Hines, a good many things\nwould be cleared up. Some new element he had to have, if Gregory's\nstory were to be disproved, some new and different motive. Suppose, for\ninstance...\n\nHe got up and paced the floor back and forward, forward and back. There\nwas just one possibility, and just one way of verifying it. He sat down\nand wrote out a long telegram and then got his hat and carried it to the\ntelegraph office himself. He had made his last throw.\n\nHe received a reply the following day, and in a state of exhilaration\nbordering on madness packed his bag, and as he packed it addressed it,\nafter the fashion of lonely men the world over.\n\n\"Just one more trip, friend cowhide,\" he said, \"and then you and I\nare going to settle down again to work. But it's some trip, old\narm-breaker.\"\n\nHe put in his pajamas and handkerchiefs, his clean socks and collars,\nand then he got his revolver from a drawer and added it. Just\ntwenty-four hours later he knocked at Dick's door in a boarding-house on\nWest Ninth Street, found it unlocked, and went in. Dick was asleep,\nand Bassett stood looking down at him with an odd sort of paternal\naffection. Finally he bent down and touched his shoulder.\n\n\"Wake up, old top,\" he said. \"Wake up. I have some news for you.\"\n\n\n\n\nXLIV\n\nTo Dick the last day or two had been nightmares of loneliness. He threw\ncaution to the winds and walked hour after hour, only to find that\nthe street crowds, people who had left a home or were going to one,\ndepressed him and emphasized his isolation. He had deliberately put\naway from him the anchor that had been Elizabeth and had followed a\ntreacherous memory, and now he was adrift. He told himself that he did\nnot want much. Only peace, work and a place. But he had not one of them.\n\nHe was homesick for David, for Lucy, and, with a tightening of the\nheart he admitted it, for Elizabeth. And he had no home. He thought of\nReynolds, bent over the desk in his office; he saw the quiet tree-shaded\nstreets of the town, and Reynolds, passing from house to house in the\nlittle town, doing his work, usurping his place in the confidence and\nfriendship of the people; he saw the very children named for him asking:\n\"Who was I named for, mother?\" He saw David and Lucy gone, and the\nold house abandoned, or perhaps echoing to the laughter of Reynolds'\nchildren.\n\nHe had moments when he wondered what would happen if he took Beverly at\nher word. Suppose she made her confession, re-opened the thing, to fill\nthe papers with great headlines, \"Judson Clark Not Guilty. A Strange\nStory.\"\n\nHe saw himself going back to the curious glances of the town, never to\nbe to them the same as before. To face them and look them down, to hear\nwhispers behind his back, to feel himself watched and judged, on that\nfar past of his. Suppose even that it could be kept out of the papers;\nWilkins amiable and acquiescent, Beverly's confession hidden in the ruck\nof legal documents; and he stealing back, to go on as best he could,\ncovering his absence with lies, and taking up his work again. But even\nthat uneasy road was closed to him. He saw David and Lucy stooping to\nnew and strange hypocrisies, watching with anxious old eyes the faces of\ntheir neighbors, growing defiant and hard as time went on and suspicion\nstill followed him.\n\nAnd there was Elizabeth.\n\nHe tried not to think of her, save as of some fine and tender thing he\nhad once brushed as he passed by. Even if she still cared for him, he\ncould, even less than David and Lucy, ask her to walk the uneasy road\nwith him. She was young. She would forget him and marry Wallace Sayre.\nShe would have luxury and gaiety, and the things that belong to youth.\n\nHe was not particularly bitter about that. He knew now that he had given\nher real love, something very different from that early madness of his,\nbut he knew it too late...\n\nHe looked up at Bassett and then sat up.\n\n\"What sort of news?\" he asked, his voice still thick with sleep.\n\n\"Get up and put some cold water on your head. I want you to get this.\"\n\nHe obeyed, but without enthusiasm. Some new clue, some hope revived only\nto die again, what did it matter? But he stopped by Bassett and put a\nhand on his shoulder.\n\n\"Why do you do it?\" he asked. \"Why don't you let me go to the devil in\nmy own way?\"\n\n\"I started this, and by Heaven I've finished it,\" was Bassett's exultant\nreply.\n\nHe sat down and produced a bundle of papers. \"I'm going to read you\nsomething,\" he said. \"And when I'm through you're going to put your\nclothes on and we'll go to the Biltmore. The Biltmore. Do you get it?\"\n\nThen he began to read.\n\n\"I, the undersigned, being of sound mind, do hereby make the following\nstatement. I make the statement of my own free will, and swear before\nAlmighty God that it is the truth. I am an illegitimate son of Elihu\nClark. My mother, Harriet Burgess, has since married and is now known as\nHattie Thorwald. She will confirm the statements herein contained.\n\n\"I was adopted by a woman named Hines, of the city of Omaha, whose name\nI took. Some years later this woman married and had a daughter, of whom\nI shall speak later.\n\n\"I attended preparatory school in the East, and was sent during\nvacations to a tutoring school, owned by Mr. Henry Livingstone. When I\nwent to college Mr. Livingstone bought a ranch at Dry River, Wyoming,\nand I spent some time there now and then.\n\n\"I learned that I was being supported and sent to college from funds\nfurnished by a firm of New York lawyers, and that aroused my suspicion.\nI knew that Mrs. Hines was not my mother. I finally learned that I was\nthe son of Elihu Clark and Harriet Burgess.\n\n\"I felt that I should have some part of the estate, and I developed a\nhatred of Judson Clark, whom I knew. I made one attempt to get money\nfrom him by mail, threatening to expose his father's story, but I did\nnot succeed.\n\n\"I visited my mother, Hattie Thorwald, and threatened to kill Clark. I\nalso threatened Henry Livingstone, and his death came during a dispute\nover the matter, but I did not kill him. He fell down and hit his head.\nHe had a weak heart.\n\n\"My foster-sister had gone on the stage, and Clark was infatuated with\nher. I saw him a number of times, but he did not connect me with the\nletter I had sent. My foster-sister's stage name is Beverly Carlysle.\n\n\"She married Howard Lucas and they visited the Clark ranch at Norada,\nWyoming, in the fall of 1911. I saw my sister there several times,\nand as she knew the way I felt she was frightened. My mother, Hattie\nThorwald, was a sort of maid to her, and together they tried to get me\nto go away.\"\n\nBassett looked up.\n\n\"Up to that point,\" he said, \"I wrote it myself before I saw him.\" There\nwas a note of triumph in his voice. \"The rest is his.\"\n\n\"On the night Lucas was killed I was to go away. Bev had agreed to give\nme some money, for the piece had quit in June and I was hard up. She\nwas going to borrow it from Jud Clark, and that set me crazy. I felt it\nought to be mine, or a part of it anyhow.\n\n\"I was to meet my mother in the grounds, but I missed her, and I went to\nthe house. I wasn't responsible for what I did. I was crazy, I guess.\nI saw Donaldson on the side porch, and beyond him were Lucas and Clark,\nplaying roulette. It made me wild. I couldn't have played roulette that\nnight for pennies.\n\n\"I went around the house and in the front door. What I meant to do was\nto walk into that room and tell Clark who I was. He knew me, and all I\nmeant to do was to call Bev down, and mother, and make him sit up and\ntake notice. I hadn't a gun on me.\n\n\"I swear I wasn't thinking of killing him then. I hated him like poison,\nbut that was all. But I went into the living-room, and I heard Clark\nsay he'd lost a thousand dollars. Maybe you don't get that. A thousand\ndollars thrown around like that, and me living on what Bev could borrow\nfrom him.\n\n\"That sent me wild. Lucas took a gun from him, just after that, and said\nhe was going to put it in the other room. He did it, too. He put it on a\ntable and started back. I got it and pointed it at Clark. I'd have shot\nhim, too, but Bev came into the room.\n\n\"I want to exonerate Bev. She has been better than most sisters to me,\nand she has lied to try to save me. She came up behind me and grabbed my\narm. Lucas had heard her, and he turned. I must have closed my hand on\nthe trigger, for it went off and hit him.\n\n\"I was in the living-room when Donaldson ran in. I hid there until they\nwere all gathered around Lucas and had quit running in, and then I\ngot away. I saw my mother in the grounds later. I told her where the\nrevolver was and that they'd better put it in the billiard room. I was\nafraid they'd suspect Bev.\n\n\"I have read the above statement and it is correct. I was legally\nadopted by Mrs. Alice Ford Hines, of Omaha, and use that signature. I\ngenerally use the name of Frederick Gregory, which I took when I was on\nthe stage for a short time.\n\n\"(Signed) Clifton HINES.\"\n\n\nBassett folded up the papers and put them in the envelope. \"I got\nthat,\" he said, \"at the point of a gun, my friend. And our friend Hines\ndeparted for the Mexican border on the evening train. I don't mind\nsaying that I saw him off. He held out for a get-away, and I guess it's\njust as well.\"\n\nHe glanced at Dick, lying still and rigid on the bed.\n\n\"And now,\" he said. \"I think a little drink won't do us any harm.\"\n\nDick refused to drink. He was endeavoring to comprehend the situation;\nto realize that Gregory, who had faced him with such sneering hate a day\nor so before, was his half-brother.\n\n\"Poor devil!\" he said at last. \"I wish to God I'd known. He was right,\nyou know. No wonder--\"\n\nSometime later he roused from deep study and looked at Bassett.\n\n\"How did you get the connection?\"\n\n\"I saw Melis, and learned that Hines was in it somehow. He was the\nconnecting link between Beverly Carlysle and the Thorwald woman. But I\ncouldn't connect him with Beverly herself, except by a chance. I wired\na man I knew in Omaha, and he turned up the second marriage, and a\ndaughter known on the stage as Beverly Carlysle.\"\n\nBassett was in high spirits. He moved about the room immensely pleased\nwith himself, slightly boastful.\n\n\"Some little stroke, Dick!\" he said. \"What price Mr. Judson Clark\nto-night, eh? It will be worth a million dollars to see Wilkins' face\nwhen he reads that thing.\"\n\n\"There's no mention of me as Livingstone in it, is there?\"\n\n\"It wasn't necessary to go into that. I didn't know--Look here,\" he\nexploded, \"you're not going to be a damned fool, are you?\"\n\n\"I'm not going to revive Judson Clark, Bassett. I don't owe him\nanything. Let him die a decent death and stay dead.\"\n\n\"Oh, piffle!\" Bassett groaned. \"Don't start that all over again. Don't\npull any Enoch Arden stuff on me, looking in at a lighted window and\nwandering off to drive a taxicab.\"\n\nSuddenly Dick laughed. Bassett watched him, puzzled and angry, with a\nsort of savage tenderness.\n\n\"You're crazy,\" he said morosely. \"Darned if I understand you. Here I've\ngot everything fixed as slick as a whistle, and it took work, believe\nme. And now you say you're going to chuck the whole thing.\"\n\n\"Not at all,\" Dick replied, with a new ring in his voice. \"You're right.\nI've been ten sorts of a fool, but I know now what I'm going to do. Take\nyour paper, old friend, and for my sake go out and clear Jud Clark. Put\nup a headstone to him, if you like, a good one. I'll buy it.\"\n\n\"And what will you be doing in the meantime?\"\n\nDick stretched and threw out his arms.\n\n\"Me?\" he said. \"What should I be doing, old man? I'm going home.\"\n\n\n\n\nXLV\n\nLucy Crosby was dead. One moment she was of the quick, moving about the\nhouse, glancing in at David, having Minnie in the kitchen pin and unpin\nher veil; and the next she was still and infinitely mysterious, on her\nwhite bed. She had fallen outside the door of David's room, and lay\nthere, her arms still full of fresh bath towels, and a fixed and intense\nlook in her eyes, as though, outside the door, she had come face to face\nwith a messenger who bore surprising news. Doctor Reynolds, running up\nthe stairs, found her there dead, and closed the door into David's room.\n\nBut David knew before they told him. He waited until they had placed her\non her bed, had closed her eyes and drawn a white coverlet over her, and\nthen he went in alone, and sat down beside her, and put a hand over her\nchilling one.\n\n\"If you are still here, Lucy,\" he said, \"and have not yet gone on, I\nwant you to carry this with you. We are all right, here. Everybody is\nall right. You are not to worry.\"\n\nAfter a time he went back to his room and got his prayer-book. He could\nhear Harrison Miller's voice soothing Minnie in the lower hall, and\nReynolds at the telephone. He went back into the quiet chamber, and\nopening the prayer-book, began to read aloud.\n\n\"Now is Christ risen from the dead, and become the first fruits of them\nthat slept--\"\n\nHis voice tightened. He put his head down on the side of the bed.\n\nHe was very docile that day. He moved obediently from his room for\nthe awful aftermath of a death, for the sweeping and dusting and clean\ncurtains, and sat in Dick's room, not reading, not even praying, a\nlonely yet indomitable old figure. When his friends came, elderly men\nwho creaked in and tried to reduce their robust voices to a decorous\nwhisper, he shook hands with them and made brief, courteous replies.\nThen he lapsed into silence. They felt shut off and uncomfortable, and\ncreaked out again.\n\nOnly once did he seem shaken. That was when Elizabeth came swiftly in\nand put her arms around him as he sat. He held her close to him, saying\nnothing for a long time. Then he drew a deep breath.\n\n\"I was feeling mighty lonely, my dear,\" he said.\n\nHe was the better for her visit. He insisted on dressing that evening,\nand on being helped down the stairs. The town, which had seemed inimical\nfor so long, appeared to him suddenly to be holding out friendly hands.\nMore than friendly hands. Loving, tender hands, offering service and\naffection and old-time friendship. It moved about sedately, in\ndark clothes, and came down the stairs red-eyed and using\npocket-hand-kerchiefs, and it surrounded him with love and loving\nkindness.\n\nWhen they had all gone Harrison Miller helped him up the stairs to where\nhis tidy bed stood ready, and the nurse had placed his hot milk on a\nstand. But Harrison did not go at once.\n\n\"What about word to Dick, David?\" he inquired awkwardly, \"I've called\nup Bassett, but he's away. And I don't know that Dick ought to come back\nanyhow. If the police are on the job at all they'll be on the lookout\nnow. They'll know he may try to come.\"\n\nDavid looked away. Just how much he wanted Dick, to tide him over these\nbad hours, only David knew. But he could not have him. He stared at the\nglass of hot milk.\n\n\"I guess I can fight this out alone, Harrison,\" he said. \"And Lucy will\nunderstand.\"\n\nHe did not sleep much that night. Once or twice he got up and tip-toed\nacross the hall into Lucy's room and looked at her. She was as white\nas her pillow, and quite serene. Her hands, always a little rough and\ntwisted with service, were smooth and rested.\n\n\"You know why he can't come, Lucy,\" he said once. \"It doesn't mean that\nhe doesn't care. You have to remember that.\" His sublime faith that she\nheard and understood, not the Lucy on the bed but the Lucy who had not\nyet gone on to the blessed company of heaven, carried him back to his\nbed, comforted and reassured.\n\nHe was up and about his room early. The odor of baking muffins and\nfrying ham came up the stair-well, and the sound of Mike vigorously\npolishing the floor in the hall. Mixed with the odor of cooking and of\nfloor wax was the scent of flowers from Lucy's room, and Mrs. Sayre's\nmachine stopped at the door while the chauffeur delivered a great mass\nof roses.\n\nDavid went carefully down the stairs and into his office, and there, at\nhis long deserted desk, commenced a letter to Dick.\n\nHe was sitting there when Dick came up the street...\n\nThe thought that he was going home had upheld Dick through the days that\nfollowed Bassett's departure for the West. He knew that it would be a\nfight, that not easily does a man step out of life and into it again,\nbut after his days of inaction he stood ready to fight. For David, for\nLucy, and, if it was not too late, for Elizabeth. When Bassett's wire\ncame from Norada, \"All clear,\" he set out for Haverly, more nearly happy\nthan for months. The very rhythm of the train sang: \"Going home; going\nhome.\"\n\nAt the Haverly station the agent stopped, stared at him and then nodded\ngravely. There was something restrained in his greeting, like the\nvoices in the old house the night before, and Dick felt a chill of\napprehension. He never thought of Lucy, but David... The flowers and\nribbon at the door were his first intimation, and still it was David\nhe thought of. He went cold and bitter, standing on the freshly washed\npavement, staring at them. It was all too late. David! David!\n\nHe went into the house slowly, and the heavy scent of flowers greeted\nhim. The hall was empty, and automatically he pushed open the door to\nDavid's office and went in. David was at the desk writing. David was\nalive. Thank God and thank God, David was alive.\n\n\"David!\" he said brokenly. \"Dear old David!\" And was suddenly shaken\nwith dry, terrible sobbing.\n\nThere was a great deal to do, and Dick was grateful for it. But first,\nlike David, he went in and sat by Lucy's bed alone and talked to her.\nNot aloud, as David did, but still with that same queer conviction that\nshe heard. He told her he was free, and that she need not worry about\nDavid, that he was there now to look after him; and he asked her, if she\ncould, to help him with Elizabeth. Then he kissed her and went out.\n\nHe met Elizabeth that day. She had come to the house, and after her\ncustom now went up, unwarned, to David's room. She found David there and\nHarrison Miller, and--it was a moment before she realized it--Dick by\nthe mantel. He was greatly changed. She saw that. But she had no feeling\nof pity, nor even of undue surprise. She felt nothing at all. It gave\nher a curious, almost hard little sense of triumph to see that he had\ngone pale. She marched up to him and held out her hand, mindful of the\neyes on her.\n\n\"I'm so very sorry, Dick,\" she said. \"You have a sad home-coming.\"\n\nThen she withdrew her hand, still calm, and turned to David.\n\n\"Mother sent over some things. I'll give them to Minnie,\" she said, her\nvoice clear and steady. She went out, and they heard her descending the\nstairs.\n\nShe was puzzled to find out that her knees almost gave way on the\nstaircase, for she felt calm and without any emotion whatever. And she\nfinished her errand, so collected and poised that the two or three women\nwho had come in to help stared after her as she departed.\n\n\"Do you suppose she's seen him?\"\n\n\"She was in David's room. She must have.\"\n\nMindful of Mike, they withdrew into Lucy's sitting-room and closed the\ndoor, there to surmise and to wonder. Did he know she was engaged to\nWallie Sayre? Would she break her engagement now or not? Did Dick for a\nmoment think that he could do as he had done, go away and jilt a girl,\nand come back to be received as though nothing had happened? Because, if\nhe did...\n\nTo Dick Elizabeth's greeting had been a distinct shock. He had not known\njust what he had expected; certainly he had not hoped to pick things up\nwhere he had dropped them. But there was a hard friendliness in it that\nwas like a slap in the face. He had meant at least to fight to win back\nwith her, but he saw now that there would not even be a fight. She was\nnot angry or hurt. The barrier was more hopeless than that.\n\nDavid, watching him, waited until Harrison had gone, and went directly\nto the subject.\n\n\"Have you ever stopped to think what these last months have meant to\nElizabeth? Her own worries, and always this infernal town, talking,\ntalking. The child's pride's been hurt, as well as her heart.\"\n\n\"I thought I'd better not go into that until after--until later,\"\nhe explained. \"The other thing was wrong. I knew it the moment I saw\nBeverly and I didn't go back again. What was the use? But--you saw her\nface, David. I think she doesn't even care enough to hate me.\"\n\n\"She's cared enough to engage herself to Wallace Sayre!\"\n\nAfter one astounded glance Dick laughed bitterly.\n\n\"That looks as though she cared!\" he said. He had gone very white. After\na time, as David sat silent and thoughtful, he said: \"After all, what\nright had I to expect anything else? When you think that, a few days\nago, I was actually shaken at the thought of seeing another woman, you\ncan hardly blame her.\"\n\n\"She waited a long time.\"\n\nLater Dick made what was a difficult confession under the circumstances.\n\n\"I know now--I think I knew all along, but the other thing was like that\ncraving for liquor I told you about--I know now that she has always\nbeen the one woman. You'll understand that, perhaps, but she wouldn't.\nI would crawl on my knees to make her believe it, but it's too late.\nEverything's too late,\" he added.\n\nBefore the hour for the services he went in again and sat by Lucy's bed,\nbut she who had given him wise counsel so many times before lay in her\nmajestic peace, surrounded by flowers and infinitely removed. Yet she\ngave him something. Something of her own peace. Once more, as on the\nnight she had stood at the kitchen door and watched him disappear in the\ndarkness, there came the tug of the old familiar things, the home sense.\nNot only David now, but the house. The faded carpet on the stairs, the\nold self-rocker Lucy had loved, the creaking faucets in the bathroom,\nMike and Minnie, the laboratory,--united in their shabby strength, they\nwere home to him. They had come back, never to be lost again. Home.\n\nThen, little by little, they carried their claim further. They were\nnot only home. They were the setting of a dream, long forgotten but now\nvivid in his mind, and a refuge from the dreary present. That dream had\nseen Elizabeth enshrined among the old familiar things; the old house\nwas to be a sanctuary for her and for him. From it and from her in the\ndream he was to go out in the morning; to it and to her he was to come\nhome at night, after he had done a man's work.\n\nThe dream faded. Before him rose her face of the morning, impassive and\ncool; her eyes, not hostile but indifferent. She had taken herself\nout of his life, had turned her youth to youth, and forgotten him. He\nunderstood and accepted it. He saw himself as he must have looked to\nher, old and worn, scarred from the last months, infinitely changed. And\nshe was young. Heavens, how young she was!...\n\nLucy was buried the next afternoon. It was raining, and the quiet\nprocession followed Dick and the others who carried her light body under\ngrotesquely bobbing umbrellas. Then he and David, and Minnie and Mike,\nwent back to the house, quiet with that strange emptiness that follows a\ndeath, the unconscious listening for a voice that will not speak again,\nfor a familiar footfall. David had not gone upstairs. He sat in Lucy's\nsitting-room, in his old frock coat and black tie, with a knitted afghan\nacross his knees. His throat looked withered in his loose collar. And\nthere for the first time they discussed the future.\n\n\"You're giving up a great deal, Dick,\" David said. \"I'm proud of\nyou, and like you I think the money's best where it is. But this is a\nprejudiced town, and they think you've treated Elizabeth badly. If you\ndon't intend to tell the story--\"\n\n\"Never,\" Dick announced, firmly. \"Judson Clark is dead.\" He smiled\nat David with something of his old humor. \"I told Bassett to put up a\nmonument if he wanted to. But you're right about one thing. They're not\nready to take me back. I've seen it a dozen times in the last two days.\"\n\n\"I never gave up a fight yet.\" David's voice was grim.\n\n\"On the other hand, I don't want to make it uncomfortable for her.\nWe are bound to meet. I'm putting my own feeling aside. It doesn't\nmatter--except of course to me. What I thought was--We might go into the\ncity. Reynolds would buy the house. He's going to be married.\"\n\nBut he found himself up against the stone wall of David's opposition. He\nwas too old to be uprooted. He liked to be able to find his way around\nin the dark. He was almost childish about it, and perhaps a trifle\nterrified. But it was his final argument that won Dick over.\n\n\"I thought you'd found out there's nothing in running away from\ntrouble.\"\n\nDick straightened.\n\n\"You're right,\" he said. \"We'll stay here and fight it out together.\"\n\nHe helped David up the stairs to where the nurse stood waiting, and then\nwent on into his own bedroom. He surveyed it for the first time since\nhis return with a sense of permanency and intimacy. Here, from now on,\nwas to center his life. From this bed he would rise in the morning,\nto go back to it at night. From this room he would go out to fight for\nplace again, and for the old faith in him, for confiding eyes and the\nclasp of friendly hands.\n\nHe sat down by the window and with the feeling of dismissing them\nforever retraced slowly and painfully the last few months; the night on\nthe mountains, and Bassett asleep by the fire; the man from the cabin\ncaught under the tree, with his face looking up, strangely twisted, from\namong the branches; dawn in the alfalfa field, and the long night tramp;\nthe boy who had recognized him in Chicago; David in his old walnut bed,\nshrivelled and dauntless; and his own going out into the night,\nwith Lucy in the kitchen doorway, Elizabeth and Wallace Sayre on the\nverandah, and himself across the street under the trees; Beverly, and\nthe illumination of his freedom from the old bonds; Gregory, glib and\ndebonair, telling his lying story, and later on, flying to safety. His\nhalf-brother!\n\nAll that, and now this quiet room, with David asleep beyond the wall and\nMinnie moving heavily in the kitchen below, setting her bread to rise.\nIt was anti-climacteric, ridiculous, wonderful.\n\nThen he thought of Elizabeth, and it became terrible.\n\nAfter Reynolds came up he put on a dressing-gown and went down the\nstairs. The office was changed and looked strange and unfamiliar. But\nwhen he opened the door and went into the laboratory nothing had been\naltered there. It was as though he had left it yesterday; the microscope\nscrewed to its stand, the sterilizer gleaming and ready. It was as\nthough it had waited for him.\n\nHe was content. He would fight and he would work. That was all a man\nneeded, a good fight, and work for his hands and brain. A man could live\nwithout love if he had work.\n\n\nHe sat down on the stool and groaned.\n\n\n\n\nXLVI\n\nOne thing Dick knew must be done and got over with. He would have to see\nElizabeth and tell her the story. He knew it would do no good, but she\nhad a right to the fullest explanation he could give her. She did not\nlove him, but it was intolerable that she should hate him.\n\nHe meant, however, to make no case for himself. He would have to stand\non the facts. This thing had happened to him; the storm had come,\nwrought its havoc and passed; he was back, to start again as nearly as\nhe could where he had left off. That was all.\n\nHe went to the Wheeler house the next night, passing the door twice\nbefore he turned in and rang the bell, in order that his voice might be\ncalm and his demeanor unshaken. But the fact that Micky, waiting on the\nporch, knew him and broke into yelps of happiness and ecstatic wriggling\nalmost lost him his self-control.\n\nWalter Wheeler opened the door and admitted him.\n\n\"I thought you might come,\" he said. \"Come in.\"\n\nThere was no particular warmth in his voice, but no unfriendliness. He\nstood by gravely while Dick took off his overcoat, and then led the way\ninto the library.\n\n\"I'd better tell you at once,\" he said, \"that I have advised Elizabeth\nto see you, but that she refuses. I'd much prefer--\" He busied himself\nat the fire for a moment. \"I'd much prefer to have her see you,\nLivingstone. But--I'll tell you frankly--I don't think it would do much\ngood.\"\n\nHe sat down and stared at the fire. Dick remained standing. \"She doesn't\nintend to see me at all?\" he asked, unsteadily.\n\n\"That's rather out of the question, if you intend to remain here. Do\nyou?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nAn unexpected feeling of sympathy for the tall young man on the hearth\nrug stirred in Walter Wheeler's breast.\n\n\"I'm sorry, Dick. She apparently reached the breaking point a week or\ntwo ago. She knew you had been here and hadn't seen her, for one thing.\"\nHe hesitated. \"You've heard of her engagement?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"I didn't want it,\" her father said drearily. \"I suppose she knows her\nown business, but the thing's done. She sent you a message,\" he added\nafter a pause. \"She's glad it's cleared up and I believe you are not to\nallow her to drive you away. She thinks David needs you.\"\n\n\"Thank you. I'll have to stay, as she says.\"\n\nThere was another uncomfortable silence. Then Walter Wheeler burst out:\n\n\"Confound it, Dick, I'm sorry. I've fought your battles for months,\nnot here, but everywhere. But here's a battle I can't fight. She isn't\nangry. You'll have to get her angle of it. I think it's something like\nthis. She had built you up into a sort of superman. And she's--well, I\nsuppose purity is the word. She's the essence of purity. Then, Leslie\ntold me this to-night, she learned from him that you were back with the\nwoman in the case, in New York.\"\n\nAnd, as Dick made a gesture:\n\n\"There's no use going to him. He was off the beaten track, and he knows\nit. He took a chance, to tell her for her own good. He's fond of her. I\nsuppose that was the last straw.\"\n\nHe sat still, a troubled figure, middle-aged and unhandsome, and very\nweary.\n\n\"It's a bad business, Dick,\" he said.\n\nAfter a time Dick stirred.\n\n\"When I first began to remember,\" he said, \"I wanted whisky. I would\nhave stolen it, if I couldn't have got it any other way. Then, when I\ngot it, I didn't want it. It sickened me. This other was the same sort\nof thing. It's done with.\"\n\nWheeler nodded.\n\n\"I understand. But she wouldn't, Dick.\"\n\n\"No. I don't suppose she would.\"\n\nHe went away soon after that, back to the quiet house and to David.\nAutomatically he turned in at his office, but Reynolds was writing\nthere. He went slowly up the stairs.\n\nAnn Sayre was frankly puzzled during the next few days. She had had a\nweek or so of serenity and anticipation, and although things were not\nquite as she would have had them, Elizabeth too impassive and even\nWallie rather restrained in his happiness, she was satisfied. But Dick\nLivingstone's return had somehow changed everything.\n\nIt had changed Wallie, too. He was suddenly a man, and not, she\nsuspected, a very happy man. He came back one day, for instance, to say\nthat he had taken a partnership in a brokerage office, and gave as his\nreason that he was sick of \"playing round.\" She rather thought it was to\ntake his mind off something.\n\nA few days after the funeral she sent for Doctor Reynolds. \"I caught\ncold at the cemetery,\" she said, when he had arrived and was seated\nopposite her in her boudoir. \"I really did,\" she protested, as she\ncaught his eye. \"I suppose everybody is sending for you, to have a\nchance to talk.\"\n\n\"Just about.\"\n\n\"You can't blame us. Particularly, you can't blame me. I've got to know\nsomething, doctor. Is he going to stay?\"\n\n\"I think so. Yes.\"\n\n\"Isn't he going to explain anything? He can't expect just to walk back\ninto his practise after all these months, and the talk that's been going\non, and do nothing about it.\"\n\n\"I don't see what his going away has to do with it. He's a good doctor,\nand a hard worker. When I'm gone--\"\n\n\"You're going, are you?\"\n\n\"Yes. I may live here, and have an office in the city. I don't care for\ngeneral practise; there's no future in it. I may take a special course\nin nose and throat.\"\n\nBut she was not interested in his plans.\n\n\"I want to know something, and only you can tell me. I'm not curious\nlike the rest; I think I have a right to know. Has he seen Elizabeth\nWheeler yet? Talked to her, I mean?\"\n\n\"I don't know. I'm inclined to think not,\" he added cautiously.\n\n\"You mean that he hasn't?\"\n\n\"Look here, Mrs. Sayre. You've confided in me, and I know it's important\nto you. I don't know a thing. I'm to stay on until the end of the week,\nand then he intends to take hold. I'm in and out, see him at meals, and\nwe've had a little desultory talk. There is no trouble between the two\nfamilies. Mr. Wheeler comes and goes. If you ask me, I think Livingstone\nhas simply accepted the situation as he found it.\"\n\n\"He isn't going to explain anything? He'll have to, I think, if he\nexpects to practise here. There have been all sorts of stories.\"\n\n\"I don't know, Mrs. Sayre.\"\n\n\"How is Doctor David?\" she asked, after a pause.\n\n\"Better. It wouldn't surprise me now to see him mend rapidly.\"\n\nHe met Elizabeth on his way down the hill, a strange, bright-eyed\nElizabeth, carrying her head high and a bit too jauntily, and with a\nsort of hot defiance in her eyes. He drove on, thoughtfully. All this\nturmoil and trouble, anxiety and fear, and all that was left a crushed\nand tragic figure of a girl, and two men in an old house, preparing to\nfight that one of them might regain the place he had lost.\n\nIt would be a fight. Reynolds saw the village already divided into two\ncamps, a small militant minority, aligned with Dick and David, and a\nwaiting, not particularly hostile but intensely curious majority,\nwho would demand certain things before Dick's reinstatement in their\nconfidence.\n\nElizabeth Wheeler was an unconscious party to the division. It was, in\na way, her battle they were fighting. And Elizabeth had gone over to the\nenemy.\n\nLate that afternoon Ann Sayre had her first real talk with Wallie since\nDick's return. She led him out onto the terrace, her shoulders militant\nand her head high, and faced him there.\n\n\"I can see you are not going to talk to me,\" she said. \"So I'll talk to\nyou. Has Dick Livingstone's return made any change between Elizabeth and\nyou?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"She's just the same to you? You must tell me, Wallace. I've been\nbuilding so much.\"\n\nShe realized the change in him then more fully than ever for he faced\nher squarely and without evasion.\n\n\"There's no change in her, mother, but I think you and I will both have\nto get used to this: she's not in love with me. She doesn't pretend to\nbe.\"\n\n\"Don't tell me it's still that man!\"\n\n\"I don't know.\" He took a turn or two about the terrace. \"I don't think\nit is, mother. I don't think she cares for anybody, that way, certainly\nnot for me. And that's the trouble.\" He faced her again. \"If marrying\nme isn't going to make her happy, I won't hold her to it. You'll have to\nsupport me in that, mother. I'm a pretty weak sister sometimes.\"\n\nThat appeal touched her as nothing had done for a long time. \"I'll help\nall I can, if the need comes,\" she said, and turned and went heavily\ninto the house.\n\n\n\n\nXLVII\n\nDavid was satisfied. The great love of his life had been given to Dick,\nand now Dick was his again. He grieved for Lucy, but he knew that the\nparting was not for long, and that from whatever high place she looked\ndown she would know that. He was satisfied. He looked on his work and\nfound it good. There was no trace of weakness nor of vacillation in the\nman who sat across from him at the table, or slammed in and out of the\nhouse after his old fashion.\n\nBut he was not content. At first it was enough to have Dick there, to\nstop in the doorway of his room and see him within, occupied with the\nprosaic business of getting into his clothes or out of them, now\nand then to put a hand on his shoulder, to hear him fussing in the\nlaboratory again, and to be called to examine divers and sundry smears\nto which Dick attached impressive importance and more impressive names.\nBut behind Dick's surface cheerfulness he knew that he was eating his\nheart out.\n\nAnd there was nothing to be done. Nothing. Secretly David watched the\npapers for the announcement of Elizabeth's engagement, and each day drew\na breath of relief when it did not come. And he had done another thing\nsecretly, too; he did not tell Dick when her ring came back. Annie had\nbrought the box, without a letter, and the incredible cruelty of the\nthing made David furious. He stamped into his office and locked it in a\ndrawer, with the definite intention of saving Dick that one additional\npang at a time when he already had enough to hear.\n\nFor things were going very badly. The fight was on.\n\nIt was a battle without action. Each side was dug in and entrenched, and\nwaiting. It was an engagement where the principals met occasionally the\nneutral ground of the streets, bowed to each other and passed on.\n\nThe town was sorry for David and still fond of him, but it resented his\nstiff-necked attitude. It said, in effect, that when he ceased to make\nDick's enemies his it was willing to be friends. But it said also, to\neach other and behind its hands, that Dick's absence was discreditable\nor it would be explained, and that he had behaved abominably to\nElizabeth. It would be hanged if it would be friends with him.\n\nIt looked away, but it watched. Dick knew that when he passed by on the\nstreets it peered at him from behind its curtains, and whispered behind\nhis back. Now and then he saw, on his evening walks, that line of cars\ndrawn up before houses he had known and frequented which indicated a\nparty, but he was never asked. He never told David.\n\nIt was only when the taboo touched David that Dick was resentful, and\nthen he was inclined to question the wisdom of his return. It hurt\nhim, for instance, to see David give up his church, and reading morning\nprayer alone at home on Sunday mornings, and to see his grim silence\nwhen some of his old friends were mentioned.\n\nYet on the surface things were much as they had been. David rose early,\nand as he improved in health, read his morning paper in his office\nwhile he waited for breakfast. Doctor Reynolds had gone, and the desk in\nDick's office was back where it belonged. In the mornings Mike oiled\nthe car in the stable and washed it, his old pipe clutched in his teeth,\nwhile from the kitchen came the sounds of pans and dishes, and the odor\nof frying sausages. And Dick splashed in the shower, and shaved by the\nmirror with the cracked glass in the bathroom. But he did not sing.\n\nThe house was very quiet. Now and then the front door opened, and a\npatient came in, but there was no longer the crowded waiting-room,\nthe incessant jangle of the telephone, the odor of pungent drugs and\nantiseptics.\n\nWhen, shortly before Christmas, Dick looked at the books containing the\nlast quarter's accounts, he began to wonder how long they could fight\ntheir losing battle. He did not mind for himself, but it was unthinkable\nthat David should do without, one by one, the small luxuries of his old\nage, his cigars, his long and now errandless rambles behind Nettie.\n\nHe began then to think of his property, his for the claiming, and to\nquestion whether he had not bought his peace at too great a cost to\nDavid. He knew by that time that it was not fear, but pride, which had\nsent him back empty-handed, the pride of making his own way. And now and\nthen, too, he felt a perfectly human desire to let Bassett publish the\nstory as his vindication and then snatch David away from them all,\nto some luxurious haven where--that was the point at which he always\nstopped--where David could pine away in homesickness for them!\n\nThere was an irony in it that made him laugh hopelessly.\n\nHe occupied himself then with ways and means, and sold the car.\nReynolds, about to be married and busily furnishing a city office,\nbought it, had it repainted a bright blue, and signified to the world at\nlarge that he was at the Rossiter house every night by leaving it at\nthe curb. Sometimes, on long country tramps, Dick saw it outside a\nfarmhouse, and knew that the boycott was not limited to the town.\n\nBy Christmas, however, he realized that the question of meeting their\nexpenses necessitated further economies, and reluctantly at last they\ndecided to let Mike go. Dick went out to the stable with a distinct\nsinking of the heart, while David sat in the house, unhappily waiting\nfor the thing to be done. But Mike refused to be discharged.\n\n\"And is it discharging me you are?\" he asked, putting down one of\nDavid's boots in his angry astonishment. \"Well, then, I'm telling you\nyou're not.\"\n\n\"We can't pay you any longer, Mike. And now that the car's gone--\"\n\n\"I'm not thinking about pay. I'm not going, and that's flat. Who'd be\nafter doing his boots and all?\"\n\nDavid called him in that night and dismissed him again, this time very\nfirmly. Mike said nothing and went out, but the next morning he was\nscrubbing the sidewalk as usual, and after that they gave it up.\n\nNow and then Dick and Elizabeth met on the street, and she bowed to him\nand went on. At those times it seemed incredible that once he had held\nher in his arms, and that she had looked up at him with loving, faithful\neyes. He suffered so from those occasional meetings that he took to\nwatching for her, so as to avoid her. Sometimes he wished she would\nmarry Wallace quickly, so he would be obliged to accept what now he knew\nhe had not accepted at all.\n\nHe had occasional spells of violent anger at her, and of resentment, but\nthey died when he checked up, one after the other, the inevitable series\nof events that had led to the catastrophe. But it was all nonsense\nto say that love never died. She had loved him, and there was never\nanything so dead as that love of hers.\n\nHe had been saved one thing, however; he had never seen her with Wallie\nSayre. Then, one day in the country while he trudged afoot to make one\nof his rare professional visits, they went past together in Wallie's\nbright roadster. The sheer shock of it sent him against a fence, staring\nafter them with an anger that shook him.\n\nLate in November Elizabeth went away for a visit, and it gave him\na breathing spell. But the strain was telling on him, and Bassett,\nstopping on his way to dinner at the Wheelers', told him so bluntly.\n\n\"You look pretty rotten,\" he said. \"It's no time to go to pieces now,\nwhen you've put up your fight and won it.\"\n\n\"I'm all right. I haven't been sleeping. That's all.\"\n\n\"How about the business? People coming to their senses?\"\n\n\"Not very fast,\" Dick admitted. \"Of course it's a little soon.\"\n\nAfter dinner at the Wheelers', when Walter Wheeler had gone to a vestry\nmeeting, Bassett delivered himself to Margaret of a highly indignant\nharangue on the situation in general.\n\n\"That's how I see it,\" he finished. \"He's done a fine thing. A finer\nthing by a damned sight than I'd do, or any of this town. He's given up\nmoney enough to pay the national debt--or nearly. If he'd come back\nwith it, as Judson Clark, they wouldn't have cared a hang for the past.\nThey'd have licked his boots. It makes me sick.\"\n\nHe turned on her.\n\n\"You too, I think, Mrs. Wheeler. I'm not attacking you on that score;\nit's human nature. But it's the truth.\"\n\n\"Perhaps. I don't know.\"\n\n\"They'll drive him to doing it yet. He came back to make a place for\nhimself again, like a man. Not what he had, but what he was. But they'll\ndrive him away, mark my words.\"\n\nLater on, but more gently, he introduced the subject of Elizabeth.\n\n\"You can't get away from this, Mrs. Wheeler. So long as she stands off,\nand you behind her, the town is going to take her side. She doesn't know\nit, but that's how it stands. It all hangs on her. If he wasn't the man\nhe is, I'd say his salvation hangs on her. I don't mean she ought to\ntake him back; it's too late for that, if she's engaged. But a little\nfriendliness and kindness wouldn't do any harm. You too. Do you ever\nhave him here?\"\n\n\"How can I, as things are?\"\n\n\"Well, be friendly, anyhow,\" he argued. \"That's not asking much. I\nsuppose he'd cut my throat if he knew, but I'm a straight-to-the-mark\nsort of person, and I know this: what this house does the town will do.\"\n\n\"I'll talk to Mr. Wheeler. I don't know. I'll say this, Mr. Bassett.\nI won't make her unhappy. She has borne a great deal, and sometimes I\nthink her life is spoiled. She is very different.\"\n\n\"If she is suffering, isn't it possible she cares for him?\"\n\nBut Margaret did not think so. She was so very calm. She was so calm\nthat sometimes it was alarming.\n\n\"He gave her a ring, and the other day I found it, tossed into a drawer\nfull of odds and ends. I haven't seen it lately; she may have sent it\nback.\"\n\nElizabeth came home shortly before Christmas, undeniably glad to be back\nand very gentle with them all. She set to work almost immediately on the\ngifts, wrapping them and tying them with methodical exactness, sticking\na tiny sprig of holly through the ribbon bow, and writing cards with\nneatness and care. She hung up wreaths and decorated the house, and\nwhen she was through with her work she went to her room and sat with her\nhands folded, not thinking. She did not think any more.\n\nWallie had sent her a flexible diamond bracelet as a Christmas gift and\nit lay on her table in its box. She was very grateful, but she had not\nput it on.\n\nOn the morning before Christmas Nina came in, her arms full of packages,\nand her eyes shining and a little frightened. She had some news for\nthem. She hadn't been so keen about it, at first, but Leslie was like a\nmadman. He was so pleased that he was ordering her that sable cape she\nhad wanted so. He was like a different man. And it would be July.\n\nElizabeth kissed her. It seemed very unreal, like everything else. She\nwondered why Leslie should be so excited, or her mother crying. She\nwondered if there was something strange about her, that it should see so\nsmall and unimportant. But then, what was important? That one got up\nin the morning, and ate at intervals, and went to bed at night? That\nchildren came, and had to be fed and washed and tended, and cried a\ngreat deal, and were sick now and then?\n\nShe wished she could feel something, could think it vital whether Nina\nshould choose pink or blue for her layette, and how far she should\nwalk each day, and if the chauffeur drove the car carefully enough.\nShe wished she cared whether it was going to rain to-morrow or not, or\nwhether some one was coming, or not coming. And she wished terribly that\nshe could care for Wallie, or get over the feeling that she had saved\nher pride at a cost to him she would not contemplate.\n\nAfter a time she went upstairs and put on the bracelet. And late in the\nafternoon she went out and bought some wool, to make an afghan. It eased\nher conscience toward Nina. She commenced it that evening while she\nwaited for Wallie, and she wondered if some time she would be making an\nafghan for a coming child of her own. Hers and Wallace Sayre's.\n\nSuddenly she knew she would never marry him. She faced the future, with\nall that it implied, and she knew she could not do it. It was horrible\nthat she had even contemplated it. It would be terrible to tell Wallie,\nbut not as terrible as the other thing. She saw herself then with the\nsame clearness with which she had judged Dick. She too, leaving her\nhavoc of wrecked lives behind her; she too going along her headstrong\nway, raising hopes not to be fulfilled, and passing on. She too.\n\nThat evening, Christmas eve, she told Wallie she would not marry him.\nTold him very gently, and just after an attempt of his to embrace her.\nShe would not let him do it.\n\n\"I don't know what's come over you,\" he said morosely. \"But I'll let you\nalone, if that's the way you feel.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry, Wallie. It--it makes me shiver.\"\n\nIn a way he was prepared for it but nevertheless he begged for time,\nfor a less unequivocal rejection. But he found her, for the first time,\nimpatient with his pleadings.\n\n\"I don't want to go over and over it, Wallie. I'll take the blame. I\nshould have done it long ago.\"\n\nShe was gentle, almost tender with him, but when he said she had spoiled\nhis life for him she smiled faintly.\n\n\"You think that now. And don't believe I'm not sorry. I am. I hate not\nplaying the game, as you say. But I don't think for a moment that you'll\ngo on caring when you know I don't. That doesn't happen. That's all.\"\n\n\"Do you know what I think?\" he burst out. \"I think you're still mad\nabout Livingstone. I think you are so mad about him that you don't know\nit yourself.\"\n\nBut she only smiled her cool smile and went on with her knitting. After\nthat he got himself in hand, and--perhaps he still had some hope. It\nwas certain that she had not flinched at Dick's name--told her very\nearnestly that he only wanted her happiness. He didn't want her unless\nshe wanted him. He would always love her.\n\n\"Not always,\" she said, with tragically cold certainty. \"Men are not\nlike women; they forget.\"\n\nShe wondered, after he had gone, what had made her say that.\n\nShe did not tell the family that night. They were full of their own\nconcerns, Nina's coming maternity, the wrapping of packages behind\nclosed doors, the final trimming of the tree in the library. Leslie\nhad started the phonograph, and it was playing \"Stille Nacht, heilige\nNacht.\"\n\nStill night, holy night, and only in her was there a stillness that was\nnot holy.\n\nThey hung up their stockings valiantly as usual, making a little\nceremony of it, and being careful not to think about Jim's missing one.\nIndeed, they made rather a function of it, and Leslie demanded one of\nNina's baby socks and pinned it up.\n\n\"I'm starting a bank account for the little beggar,\" he said, and\ndropped a gold piece into the toe. \"Next year, old girl.\"\n\nHe put his arm around Nina. It seemed to him that life was doing\nconsiderably better than he deserved by him, and he felt very humble and\ncontrite. He felt in his pocket for the square jeweler's box that lay\nthere.\n\nAfter that they left Walter Wheeler there, to play his usual part at\nsuch times, and went upstairs. He filled the stockings bravely, an\norange in each toe, a box of candy, a toy for old time's sake, and then\nthe little knickknacks he had been gathering for days and hiding in\nhis desk. After all, there were no fewer stockings this year than last.\nInstead of Jim's there was the tiny one for Nina's baby. That was the\nway things went. He took away, but also He gave.\n\nHe sat back in his deep chair, and looked up at the stockings,\nludicrously bulging. After all, if he believed that He gave and took\naway, then he must believe that Jim was where he had tried to think him,\nfilling a joyous, active place in some boyish heaven.\n\nAfter a while he got up and went to his desk, and getting pen and paper\nwrote carefully.\n\n\"Dearest: You will find this in your stocking in the morning, when you\nget up for the early service. And I want you to think over it in the\nchurch. It is filled with tenderness and with anxiety. Life is not so\nvery long, little daughter, and it has no time to waste in anger or in\nbitterness. A little work, a little sleep, a little love, and it is all\nover.\n\n\"Will you think of this to-day?\"\n\nHe locked up the house, and went slowly up to bed. Elizabeth found the\nletter the next morning. She stood in the bleak room, with the ashes of\nlast night's fire still smoking, and the stockings overhead not festive\nin the gray light, but looking forlorn and abandoned. Suddenly her eyes,\ndry and fiercely burning for so long, were wet with tears. It was true.\nIt was true. A little work, a little sleep, a little love. Not the\ngreat love, perhaps, not the only love of a man's life. Not the love of\nyesterday, but of to-day and to-morrow.\n\nAll the fierce repression of the last weeks was gone. She began to\nsuffer. She saw Dick coming home, perhaps high with hope that whatever\nshe knew she would understand and forgive. And she saw herself failing\nhim, cold and shut away, not big enough nor woman enough to meet him\nhalf way. She saw him fighting his losing battle alone, protecting David\nbut never himself; carrying Lucy to her quiet grave; sitting alone in\nhis office, while the village walked by and stared at the windows; she\nsaw him, gaining harbor after storm, and finding no anchorage there.\n\nShe turned and went, half blindly, into the empty street.\n\nShe thought he was at the early service. She did not see him, but she\nhad once again the thing that had seemed lost forever, the warm sense of\nhis thought of her.\n\nHe was there, in the shadowy back pew, with the grill behind it through\nwhich once insistent hands had reached to summon him. He was there, with\nLucy's prayer-book in his hand, and none of the peace of the day in his\nheart. He knelt and rose with the others.\n\n\"O God, who makest us glad with the yearly remembrance of the birth of\nThy Son--\"\n\n\n\n\nXLVIII\n\nDavid was beaten; most tragic defeat of all, beaten by those he had\nloved and faithfully served.\n\nHe did not rise on Christmas morning, and Dick, visiting him after an\nalmost untasted breakfast, found him still in his bed and questioned him\nanxiously.\n\n\"I'm all right,\" he asserted. \"I'm tired, Dick, that's all. Tired of\nfighting. You're young. You can carry it on, and win. But I'll never see\nit. They're stronger than we are.\"\n\nLater he elaborated on that. He had kept the faith. He had run with\ncourage the race that was set before him. He had stayed up at night and\nfought for them. But he couldn't fight against them.\n\nDick went downstairs again and shutting himself in his office fell to\npacing the floor. David was right, the thing was breaking him. Very\nseriously now he contemplated abandoning the town, taking David with\nhim, and claiming his estate. They could travel then; he could get\nconsultants in Europe; there were baths there, and treatments--\n\nThe doorbell rang. He heard Minnie's voice in the hail, not too\nfriendly, and her tap at the door.\n\n\"Some one in the waiting-room,\" she called.\n\nWhen he opened the connecting door he found Elizabeth beyond it, a\npale and frightened Elizabeth, breathless and very still. It was a\nperceptible moment before he could control his voice to speak. Then:\n\n\"I suppose you want to see David. I'm sorry, but he isn't well to-day.\nHe is still in bed.\"\n\n\"I didn't come to see David, Dick.\"\n\n\"I cannot think you want to see me, Elizabeth.\"\n\n\"I do, if you don't mind.\"\n\nHe stood aside then and let her pass him into the rear office.\n\nBut he was not fooled at all. Not he. He had been enough. He knew\nwhy she had come, in the kindness of heart. (She was so little. Good\nheavens, a man could crush her to nothing!) She had come because she was\nsorry for him, and she had brought forgiveness. It was like her. It was\nfine. It was damnable.\n\nHis voice hardened, for fear it might be soft.\n\n\"Is this a professional visit, or a Christmas call, Elizabeth? Or\nperhaps I shouldn't call you that.\"\n\n\"A Christmas call?\"\n\n\"You know what I mean. The day of peace. The day--what do you think I'm\nmade of, Elizabeth? To have you here, gentle and good and kind--\"\n\nHe got up and stood over her, tall and almost threatening.\n\n\"You've been to church, and you've been thinking things over, I know. I\nwas there. I heard it all, peace on earth, goodwill to men. Bosh. Peace,\nwhen there is no peace. Good will! I don't want your peace and good\nwill.\"\n\nShe looked up at him timidly.\n\n\"You don't want to be friends, then?\"\n\n\"No. A thousand times, no,\" he said violently. Then, more gently: \"I'm\nmaking a fool of myself. I want your peace and good will, Elizabeth. God\nknows I need them.\"\n\n\"You frighten me, Dick,\" she said, slowly. \"I didn't come to bring\nforgiveness, if that is what you mean. I came--\"\n\n\"Don't tell me you came to ask it. That would be more than I can bear.\"\n\n\"Will you listen to me for a moment, Dick? I am not good at explaining\nthings, and I'm nervous. I suppose you can see that.\" She tried to smile\nat him. \"A--a little work, a sleep, a little love, that's life, isn't\nit?\"\n\nHe was watching her intently.\n\n\"Work and trouble, and a long sleep at the end for which let us be duly\nthankful--that's life, too. Love? Not every one gets love.\"\n\nHopelessness and despair overwhelmed her. He was making it hard for her.\nImpossible. She could not go on.\n\n\"I did not come with peace,\" she said tremulously, \"but if you don't\nwant it--\" She rose. \"I must say this, though, before I go. I blame\nmyself. I don't blame you. You are wrong if you think I came to forgive\nyou.\"\n\nShe was stumbling toward the door.\n\n\"Elizabeth, what did bring you?\"\n\nShe turned to him, with her hand on the door knob. \"I came because I\nwanted to see you again.\"\n\nHe strode after her and catching her by the arm, turned her until he\nfaced her.\n\n\"And why did you want to see me again? You can't still care for me.\nYou know the story. You know I was here and didn't see you. You've seen\nLeslie Ward. You know my past. What you don't know--\"\n\nHe looked down into her eyes. \"A little work, a little sleep, a little\nlove,\" he repeated. \"What did you mean by that?\"\n\n\"Just that,\" she said simply. \"Only not a little love, Dick. Maybe you\ndon't want me now. I don't know. I have suffered so much that I'm not\nsure of anything.\"\n\n\"Want you!\" he said. \"More than anything on this earth.\"\n\nBassett was at his desk in the office. It was late, and the night\neditor, seeing him reading the early edition, his feet on his desk,\ncarried over his coffee and doughnuts and joined him.\n\n\"Sometime,\" he said, \"I'm going to get that Clark story out of you. If\nit wasn't you who turned up the confession, I'll eat it.\"\n\nBassett yawned.\n\n\"Have it your own way,\" he said indifferently. \"You were shielding\nsomebody, weren't you? No? What's the answer?\"\n\nBassett made no reply. He picked up the paper and pointed to an item\nwith the end of his pencil.\n\n\"Seen this?\"\n\nThe night editor read it with bewilderment. He glanced up.\n\n\"What's that got to do with the Clark case?\"\n\n\"Nothing. Nice people, though. Know them both.\"\n\nWhen the night editor walked away, rather affronted, Bassett took up the\npaper and reread the paragraph.\n\n\"Mr. and Mrs. Walter Wheeler, of Haverly, announce the engagement of\ntheir daughter, Elizabeth, to Doctor Richard Livingstone.\"\n\nHe sat for a long time staring at it.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's The Breaking Point, by Mary Roberts Rinehart\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE BREAKING POINT ***\n\n***** This file should be named 1601.txt or 1601.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/1\/6\/0\/1601\/\n\nProduced by Anonymous Project Gutenberg Volunteers\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http:\/\/www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp:\/\/pglaf.org\/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at\n809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email\nbusiness@pglaf.org.  Email contact links and up to date contact\ninformation can be found at the Foundation's web site and official\npage at http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nFor additional contact information:\n     Dr. Gregory B. Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http:\/\/pglaf.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":342,"split":"train"}
