Th\u00e9r\u00e8se's husband, Camille, is sickly and egocentric, and when the opportunity arises, Th\u00e9r\u00e8se enters into a turbulent and sordidly passionate affair with one of Camille's friends, Laurent.\nIn his preface, Zola explains that his goal in this novel was to \"study temperaments and not characters\". Because of this detached and scientific approach, Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Raquin is considered an example of naturalism.Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Raquin is the daughter of a French sea-captain and an Algerian mother. After the death of her mother, her father brings her to live with her aunt, Madame Raquin, and her valetudinarian son, Camille. Because her son is \"so ill\", Madame Raquin dotes on Camille to the point where he is selfish and spoiled. Camille and Th\u00e9r\u00e8se grow up side-by-side, and Madame Raquin marries them to one another when Th\u00e9r\u00e8se is 21. Shortly thereafter, Camille decides that the family should move to Paris so he can pursue a career.\nTh\u00e9r\u00e8se and Madame Raquin set up shop in the Passage du Pont Neuf to support Camille while he searches for a job. Camille eventually begins working for the Orl\u00e9ans Railway Company, where he meets up with a childhood friend, Laurent. Laurent visits the Raquins and decides to take up an affair with the lonely Th\u00e9r\u00e8se, mostly because he cannot afford prostitutes any more. However, this soon turns into a torrid love affair.\nThey meet regularly and secretly in Th\u00e9r\u00e8se's room. After some time, Laurent's boss no longer allows him to leave early, and so the two lovers have to think of something new. Th\u00e9r\u00e8se comes up with the idea of killing Camille. They eventually drown him during a boat trip, though in defending himself Camille succeeds in biting Laurent on the neck. Madame Raquin is in shock after hearing the disappearance of her son and everybody believes that the drowning was an accident and that the couple actually attempted to save Camille. Laurent is still uncertain about whether Camille is truly dead and frequently visits the mortuary, where he finally finds the dead Camille. Th\u00e9r\u00e8se has nightmares and is very subdued, so Michaud\u2014one of the regular visitors of the family\u2014comes up with the idea that Th\u00e9r\u00e8se should marry again and that the ideal husband would be Laurent. They marry but they are haunted by the memory of the murder they have committed. They have hallucinations of the dead Camille in their bedroom every night, preventing them from touching each other and quickly driving them insane. Laurent, who is an artist, can no longer paint a picture (even a landscape) which does not in some way resemble the dead man. They also have to look after Madame Raquin, who has suffered a stroke after Camille's death. Madame Raquin suffers a second stroke and becomes completely paralyzed (except for her eyes), after which Th\u00e9r\u00e8se and Laurent reveal the murder in her presence during an argument.\nDuring an evening's game of dominoes with friends, Madame Raquin manages to move her finger with an extreme effort of will to trace words on the table: \"Th\u00e9r\u00e8se et Laurent ont ...\". The complete sentence was intended to be \"Th\u00e9r\u00e8se et Laurent ont tu\u00e9 Camille\" (Th\u00e9r\u00e8se and Laurent killed Camille). At this point her strength gives out, and the words are interpreted as \"Th\u00e9r\u00e8se and Laurent look after me very well\".\nEventually, Th\u00e9r\u00e8se and Laurent find life together intolerable and plot to kill each other. At the climax of the novel, the two are about to kill one another when each of them realizes the plans of the other. They each then break down sobbing and reflect upon their miserable lives. After having embraced one last time, they each commit suicide by taking poison, all in front of the watchful gaze of Madame Raquin.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg EBook of Therese Raquin, by Emile Zola\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

When, however, M. Barbey d\u00e2\u0080\u0099Aurevilly, in a critical\nweekly paper called the \u00e2\u0080\u009cNain Jaune,\u00e2\u0080\u009d spitefully alluded to this rather\ndaring novel as \u00e2\u0080\u009cHachette\u00e2\u0080\u0099s little book,\u00e2\u0080\u009d one of the members of the firm\nsent for M. Zola, and addressed him thus:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLook here, M. Zola, you are earning eight pounds a month with us, which\nis ridiculous for a man of your talent. Why don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you go into literature\naltogether? It will bring you wealth and glory.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nZola had no choice but to take this broad hint, and send in his\nresignation, which was at once accepted. The Hachettes did not require\nthe services of writers of risky, or, for that matter, any other novels,\nas clerks; and, besides, as Zola has told us himself, in an interview\nwith my old friend and employer,[*] the late M. Fernand Xau, Editor of\nthe Paris \u00e2\u0080\u009cJournal,\u00e2\u0080\u009d they thought \u00e2\u0080\u009cLa Confession de Claude\u00e2\u0080\u009d a trifle\nstiff, and objected to their clerks writing books in time which they\nconsidered theirs, as they paid for it.\n\n     [*] He sent me to Hamburg for ten days in 1892 to report on\n     the appalling outbreak of cholera in that city, with the\n     emoluments of ten pounds a day, besides printing several\n     articles from my pen on Parisian topics.--E. V.\n\nZola, cast, so to say, adrift, with \u00e2\u0080\u009cLes Contes a Ninon\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cLa\nConfession de Claude\u00e2\u0080\u009d as scant literary baggage, buckled to, and set\nabout \u00e2\u0080\u009cLes Mysteres de Marseille\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cTherese Raquin,\u00e2\u0080\u009d while at the\nsame time contributing art criticisms to the \u00e2\u0080\u009cEvenement\u00e2\u0080\u009d--a series of\narticles which raised such a storm that painters and sculptors were in\nthe habit of purchasing copies of the paper and tearing it up in the\nfaces of Zola and De Villemessant, the owner, whenever they chanced to\nmeet them. Nevertheless it was these articles that first drew attention\nto Manet, who had hitherto been regarded as a painter of no account, and\nmany of whose pictures now hang in the Luxembourg Gallery.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTherese Raquin\u00e2\u0080\u009d originally came out under the title of \u00e2\u0080\u009cA Love Story\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n in a paper called the \u00e2\u0080\u009cArtiste,\u00e2\u0080\u009d edited by that famous art critic and\ncourtier of the Second Empire, Arsene Houssaye, author of \u00e2\u0080\u009cLes Grandes\nDames,\u00e2\u0080\u009d as well as of those charming volumes \u00e2\u0080\u009cHommes et Femmes du 18eme\nSiecle,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and many other works.\n\nZola received no more than twenty-four pounds for the serial rights of\nthe novel, and he consented at the insistence of the Editor, who pointed\nout to him that the periodical was read by the Empress Eugenie, to draw\nhis pen through certain passages, which were reinstated when the story\nwas published in volume form. I may say here that in this translation,\nI have adopted the views of the late M. Arsene Houssaye; and, if I have\nallowed the appalling description of the Paris Morgue to stand, it is,\nfirst of all, because it constitutes a very important factor in the\nstory; and moreover, it is so graphic, so true to life, as I have seen\nthe place myself, times out of number, that notwithstanding its horror,\nit really would be a loss to pass it over.\n\nWell, \u00e2\u0080\u009cTherese Raquin\u00e2\u0080\u009d having appeared as \u00e2\u0080\u009cA Love Story\u00e2\u0080\u009d in the\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cArtiste,\u00e2\u0080\u009d was then published as a book, in 1867, by that same Lacroix\nas had issued Zola\u00e2\u0080\u0099s preceding efforts in novel writing. I was living\nin Paris at the time, and I well recall the yell of disapprobation with\nwhich the volume was received by the reviewers. Louis Ulbach, then\na writer on the \u00e2\u0080\u009cFigaro,\u00e2\u0080\u009d to which Zola also contributed, and who\nsubsequently founded and edited a paper called \u00e2\u0080\u009cLa Cloche,\u00e2\u0080\u009d when\nZola, curiously enough, became one of his critics, made a particularly\nvirulent attack on the novel and its author. Henri de Villemessant, the\nEditor, authorised Zola to reply to him, with the result that a vehement\ndiscussion ensued in print between author and critic, and \u00e2\u0080\u009cTherese\nRaquin\u00e2\u0080\u009d promptly went into a second edition, to which Zola appended a\npreface.\n\nI have not thought it necessary to translate this preface, which is\na long and rather tedious reply to the reviewers of the day. It will\nsuffice to say, briefly, that the author meets the strictures of his\ncritics by pointing out and insisting on the fact, that he has simply\nsought to make an analytic study of temperament and not of character.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI have selected persons,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cabsolutely swayed by their nerves\nand blood, deprived of free will, impelled in every action of life,\nby the fatal lusts of the flesh. Therese and Laurent are human brutes,\nnothing more. I have sought to follow these brutes, step by step, in the\nsecret labour of their passions, in the impulsion of their instincts,\nin the cerebral disorder resulting from the excessive strain on their\nnerves.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nEDWARD VIZETELLY SURBITON, 1 December, 1901.\n\n\n\n\n\nTHERESE RAQUIN\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I\n\nAt the end of the Rue Guenegaud, coming from the quays, you find the\nArcade of the Pont Neuf, a sort of narrow, dark corridor running from\nthe Rue Mazarine to the Rue de Seine. This arcade, at the most, is\nthirty paces long by two in breadth. It is paved with worn, loose,\nyellowish tiles which are never free from acrid damp. The square panes\nof glass forming the roof, are black with filth.\n\nOn fine days in the summer, when the streets are burning with heavy sun,\nwhitish light falls from the dirty glazing overhead to drag miserably\nthrough the arcade. On nasty days in winter, on foggy mornings, the\nglass throws nothing but darkness on the sticky tiles--unclean and\nabominable gloom.\n\nTo the left are obscure, low, dumpy shops whence issue puffs of air as\ncold as if coming from a cellar. Here are dealers in toys, cardboard\nboxes, second-hand books. The articles displayed in their windows are\ncovered with dust, and owing to the prevailing darkness, can only be\nperceived indistinctly. The shop fronts, formed of small panes of glass,\nstreak the goods with a peculiar greenish reflex. Beyond, behind\nthe display in the windows, the dim interiors resemble a number of\nlugubrious cavities animated by fantastic forms.\n\nTo the right, along the whole length of the arcade, extends a wall\nagainst which the shopkeepers opposite have stuck some small cupboards.\nObjects without a name, goods forgotten for twenty years, are spread\nout there on thin shelves painted a horrible brown colour. A dealer in\nimitation jewelry has set up shop in one of these cupboards, and there\nsells fifteen sous rings, delicately set out on a cushion of blue velvet\nat the bottom of a mahogany box.\n\nAbove the glazed cupboards, ascends the roughly plastered black wall,\nlooking as if covered with leprosy, and all seamed with defacements.\n\nThe Arcade of the Pont Neuf is not a place for a stroll. You take it to\nmake a short cut, to gain a few minutes. It is traversed by busy\npeople whose sole aim is to go quick and straight before them. You see\napprentices there in their working-aprons, work-girls taking home their\nwork, persons of both sexes with parcels under their arms. There are\nalso old men who drag themselves forward in the sad gloaming that falls\nfrom the glazed roof, and bands of small children who come to the arcade\non leaving school, to make a noise by stamping their feet on the tiles\nas they run along. Throughout the day a sharp hurried ring of footsteps\nresounds on the stone with irritating irregularity. Nobody speaks,\nnobody stays there, all hurry about their business with bent heads,\nstepping out rapidly, without taking a single glance at the shops. The\ntradesmen observe with an air of alarm, the passers-by who by a miracle\nstop before their windows.\n\nThe arcade is lit at night by three gas burners, enclosed in heavy\nsquare lanterns. These jets of gas, hanging from the glazed roof whereon\nthey cast spots of fawn-coloured light, shed around them circles of pale\nglimmer that seem at moments to disappear. The arcade now assumes the\naspect of a regular cut-throat alley. Great shadows stretch along the\ntiles, damp puffs of air enter from the street. Anyone might take the\nplace for a subterranean gallery indistinctly lit-up by three funeral\nlamps. The tradespeople for all light are contented with the faint rays\nwhich the gas burners throw upon their windows. Inside their shops, they\nmerely have a lamp with a shade, which they place at the corner of their\ncounter, and the passer-by can then distinguish what the depths of these\nholes sheltering night in the daytime, contain. On this blackish line\nof shop fronts, the windows of a cardboard-box maker are flaming: two\nschist-lamps pierce the shadow with a couple of yellow flames. And, on\nthe other side of the arcade a candle, stuck in the middle of an argand\nlamp glass, casts glistening stars into the box of imitation jewelry.\nThe dealer is dozing in her cupboard, with her hands hidden under her\nshawl.\n\nA few years back, opposite this dealer, stood a shop whose bottle-green\nwoodwork excreted damp by all its cracks. On the signboard, made of a\nlong narrow plank, figured, in black letters the word: MERCERY. And on\none of the panes of glass in the door was written, in red, the name of\na woman: _Therese Raquin_. To right and left were deep show cases, lined\nwith blue paper.\n\nDuring the daytime the eye could only distinguish the display of goods,\nin a soft, obscured light.\n\nOn one side were a few linen articles: crimped tulle caps at two and\nthree francs apiece, muslin sleeves and collars: then undervests,\nstockings, socks, braces. Each article had grown yellow and crumpled,\nand hung lamentably suspended from a wire hook. The window, from top to\nbottom, was filled in this manner with whitish bits of clothing, which\ntook a lugubrious aspect in the transparent obscurity. The new caps, of\nbrighter whiteness, formed hollow spots on the blue paper covering the\nshelves. And the coloured socks hanging on an iron rod, contributed\nsombre notes to the livid and vague effacement of the muslin.\n\nOn the other side, in a narrower show case, were piled up large balls\nof green wool, white cards of black buttons, boxes of all colours and\nsizes, hair nets ornamented with steel beads, spread over rounds of\nbluish paper, fasces of knitting needles, tapestry patterns, bobbins of\nribbon, along with a heap of soiled and faded articles, which doubtless\nhad been lying in the same place for five or six years. All the tints\nhad turned dirty grey in this cupboard, rotting with dust and damp.\n\nIn summer, towards noon, when the sun scorched the squares and streets\nwith its tawny rays, you could distinguish, behind the caps in the other\nwindow, the pale, grave profile of a young woman. This profile issued\nvaguely from the darkness reigning in the shop. To a low parched\nforehead was attached a long, narrow, pointed nose; the pale pink lips\nresembled two thin threads, and the short, nervy chin was attached\nto the neck by a line that was supple and fat. The body, lost in the\nshadow, could not be seen. The profile alone appeared in its olive\nwhiteness, perforated by a large, wide-open, black eye, and as though\ncrushed beneath thick dark hair. This profile remained there for hours,\nmotionless and peaceful, between a couple of caps for women, whereon the\ndamp iron rods had imprinted bands of rust.\n\nAt night, when the lamp had been lit, you could see inside the shop\nwhich was greater in length than depth. At one end stood a small\ncounter; at the other, a corkscrew staircase afforded communication\nwith the rooms on the first floor. Against the walls were show cases,\ncupboards, rows of green cardboard boxes. Four chairs and a table\ncompleted the furniture. The shop looked bare and frigid; the goods were\ndone up in parcels and put away in corners instead of lying hither and\nthither in a joyous display of colour.\n\nAs a rule two women were seated behind the counter: the young woman with\nthe grave profile, and an old lady who sat dozing with a smile on her\ncountenance. The latter was about sixty; and her fat, placid face looked\nwhite in the brightness of the lamp. A great tabby cat, crouching at a\ncorner of the counter, watched her as she slept.\n\nLower down, on a chair, a man of thirty sat reading or chatting in\na subdued voice with the young woman. He was short, delicate, and in\nmanner languid. With his fair hair devoid of lustre, his sparse beard,\nhis face covered with red blotches, he resembled a sickly, spoilt child\narrived at manhood.\n\nShortly before ten o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock, the old lady awoke. The shop was then\nclosed, and all the family went upstairs to bed. The tabby cat followed\nthe party purring, and rubbing its head against each bar of the\nbanisters.\n\nThe lodging above comprised three apartments. The staircase led to a\ndining-room which also did duty as drawing-room. In a niche on the\nleft stood a porcelain stove; opposite, a sideboard; then chairs were\narranged along the walls, and a round table occupied the centre. At the\nfurther end a glazed partition concealed a dark kitchen. On each side of\nthe dining-room was a sleeping apartment.\n\nThe old lady after kissing her son and daughter-in-law withdrew. The\ncat went to sleep on a chair in the kitchen. The married couple\nentered their room, which had a second door opening on a staircase that\ncommunicated with the arcade by an obscure narrow passage.\n\nThe husband who was always trembling with fever went to bed, while the\nyoung woman opened the window to close the shutter blinds. She remained\nthere a few minutes facing the great black wall, which ascends and\nstretches above the arcade. She cast a vague wandering look upon this\nwall, and, without a word she, in her turn, went to bed in disdainful\nindifference.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\nMadame Raquin had formerly been a mercer at Vernon. For close upon\nfive-and-twenty years, she had kept a small shop in that town. A few\nyears after the death of her husband, becoming subject to fits of\nfaintness, she sold her business. Her savings added to the price of this\nsale placed a capital of 40,000 francs in her hand which she invested so\nthat it brought her in an income of 2,000 francs a year. This sum amply\nsufficed for her requirements. She led the life of a recluse. Ignoring\nthe poignant joys and cares of this world, she arranged for herself a\ntranquil existence of peace and happiness.\n\nAt an annual rental of 400 francs she took a small house with a garden\ndescending to the edge of the Seine. This enclosed, quiet residence\nvaguely recalled the cloister. It stood in the centre of large fields,\nand was approached by a narrow path. The windows of the dwelling opened\nto the river and to the solitary hillocks on the opposite bank. The good\nlady, who had passed the half century, shut herself up in this solitary\nretreat, where along with her son Camille and her niece Therese, she\npartook of serene joy.\n\nAlthough Camille was then twenty, his mother continued to spoil him like\na little child. She adored him because she had shielded him from death,\nthroughout a tedious childhood of constant suffering. The boy contracted\nevery fever, every imaginable malady, one after the other. Madame Raquin\nstruggled for fifteen years against these terrible evils, which arrived\nin rapid succession to tear her son away from her. She vanquished them\nall by patience, care, and adoration. Camille having grown up, rescued\nfrom death, had contracted a shiver from the torture of the repeated\nshocks he had undergone. Arrested in his growth, he remained short and\ndelicate. His long, thin limbs moved slowly and wearily. But his mother\nloved him all the more on account of this weakness that arched his back.\nShe observed his thin, pale face with triumphant tenderness when she\nthought of how she had brought him back to life more than ten times\nover.\n\nDuring the brief spaces of repose that his sufferings allowed him,\nthe child attended a commercial school at Vernon. There he learned\northography and arithmetic. His science was limited to the four rules,\nand a very superficial knowledge of grammar. Later on, he took lessons\nin writing and bookkeeping. Madame Raquin began to tremble when advised\nto send her son to college. She knew he would die if separated from her,\nand she said the books would kill him. So Camille remained ignorant, and\nthis ignorance seemed to increase his weakness.\n\nAt eighteen, having nothing to do, bored to death at the delicate\nattention of his mother, he took a situation as clerk with a linen\nmerchant, where he earned 60 francs a month. Being of a restless nature\nidleness proved unbearable. He found greater calm and better health in\nthis labour of a brute which kept him bent all day long over invoices,\nover enormous additions, each figure of which he patiently added up. At\nnight, broken down with fatigue, without an idea in his head, he enjoyed\ninfinite delight in the doltishness that settled on him. He had to\nquarrel with his mother to go with the dealer in linen. She wanted to\nkeep him always with her, between a couple of blankets, far from the\naccidents of life.\n\nBut the young man spoke as master. He claimed work as children claim\ntoys, not from a feeling of duty, but by instinct, by a necessity of\nnature. The tenderness, the devotedness of his mother had instilled into\nhim an egotism that was ferocious. He fancied he loved those who pitied\nand caressed him; but, in reality, he lived apart, within himself,\nloving naught but his comfort, seeking by all possible means to increase\nhis enjoyment. When the tender affection of Madame Raquin disgusted him,\nhe plunged with delight into a stupid occupation that saved him from\ninfusions and potions.\n\nIn the evening, on his return from the office, he ran to the bank of the\nSeine with his cousin Therese who was then close upon eighteen. One day,\nsixteen years previously, while Madame Raquin was still a mercer, her\nbrother Captain Degans brought her a little girl in his arms. He had\njust arrived from Algeria.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHere is a child,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he with a smile, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand you are her aunt. The\nmother is dead and I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know what to do with her. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll give her to\nyou.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe mercer took the child, smiled at her and kissed her rosy cheeks.\nAlthough Degans remained a week at Vernon, his sister barely put a\nquestion to him concerning the little girl he had brought her. She\nunderstood vaguely that the dear little creature was born at Oran, and\nthat her mother was a woman of the country of great beauty. The Captain,\nan hour before his departure, handed his sister a certificate of birth\nin which Therese, acknowledged by him to be his child, bore his name. He\nrejoined his regiment, and was never seen again at Vernon, being killed\na few years later in Africa.\n\nTherese grew up under the fostering care of her aunt, sleeping in the\nsame bed as Camille. She who had an iron constitution, received the\ntreatment of a delicate child, partaking of the same medicine as her\ncousin, and kept in the warm air of the room occupied by the invalid.\nFor hours she remained crouching over the fire, in thought, watching the\nflames before her, without lowering her eyelids.\n\nThis obligatory life of a convalescent caused her to retire within\nherself. She got into the habit of talking in a low voice, of moving\nabout noiselessly, of remaining mute and motionless on a chair with\nexpressionless, open eyes. But, when she raised an arm, when she\nadvanced a foot, it was easy to perceive that she possessed feline\nsuppleness, short, potent muscles, and that unmistakable energy and\npassion slumbered in her soporous frame. Her cousin having fallen\ndown one day in a fainting fit, she abruptly picked him up and\ncarried him--an effort of strength that turned her cheeks scarlet. The\ncloistered life she led, the debilitating regimen to which she found\nherself subjected, failed to weaken her thin, robust form. Only her face\ntook a pale, and even a slightly yellowish tint, making her look\nalmost ugly in the shade. Ever and anon she went to the window, and\ncontemplated the opposite houses on which the sun threw sheets of gold.\n\nWhen Madame Raquin sold her business, and withdrew to the little place\nbeside the river, Therese experienced secret thrills of joy. Her aunt\nhad so frequently repeated to her: \u00e2\u0080\u009cDon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t make a noise; be quiet,\u00e2\u0080\u009d that\nshe kept all the impetuosity of her nature carefully concealed within\nher. She possessed supreme composure, and an apparent tranquillity that\nmasked terrible transports. She still fancied herself in the room of\nher cousin, beside a dying child, and had the softened movements, the\nperiods of silence, the placidity, the faltering speech of an old woman.\n\nWhen she saw the garden, the clear river, the vast green hillocks\nascending on the horizon, she felt a savage desire to run and shout. She\nfelt her heart thumping fit to burst in her bosom; but not a muscle of\nher face moved, and she merely smiled when her aunt inquired whether she\nwas pleased with her new home.\n\nLife now became more pleasant for her. She maintained her supple gait,\nher calm, indifferent countenance, she remained the child brought up\nin the bed of an invalid; but inwardly she lived a burning, passionate\nexistence. When alone on the grass beside the water, she would lie down\nflat on her stomach like an animal, her black eyes wide open, her body\nwrithing, ready to spring. And she stayed there for hours, without a\nthought, scorched by the sun, delighted at being able to thrust her\nfingers in the earth. She had the most ridiculous dreams; she looked\nat the roaring river in defiance, imagining that the water was about\nto leap on her and attack her. Then she became rigid, preparing for the\ndefence, and angrily inquiring of herself how she could vanquish the\ntorrent.\n\nAt night, Therese, appeased and silent, stitched beside her aunt, with\na countenance that seemed to be dozing in the gleam that softly glided\nfrom beneath the lamp shade. Camille buried in an armchair thought\nof his additions. A word uttered in a low voice, alone disturbed, at\nmoments, the peacefulness of this drowsy home.\n\nMadame Raquin observed her children with serene benevolence. She had\nresolved to make them husband and wife. She continued to treat her son\nas if he were at death\u00e2\u0080\u0099s door; and she trembled when she happened to\nreflect that she would one day die herself, and would leave him alone\nand suffering. In that contingency, she relied on Therese, saying to\nherself that the young girl would be a vigilant guardian beside Camille.\nHer niece with her tranquil manner, and mute devotedness, inspired her\nwith unlimited confidence. She had seen Therese at work, and wished to\ngive her to her son as a guardian angel. This marriage was a solution to\nthe matter, foreseen and settled in her mind.\n\nThe children knew for a long time that they were one day to marry. They\nhad grown up with this idea, which had thus become familiar and natural\nto them. The union was spoken of in the family as a necessary and\npositive thing. Madame Raquin had said:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe will wait until Therese is one-and-twenty.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd they waited patiently, without excitement, and without a blush.\n\nCamille, whose blood had become impoverished by illness, had remained\na little boy in the eyes of his cousin. He kissed her as he kissed his\nmother, by habit, without losing any of his egotistic tranquillity. He\nlooked upon her as an obliging comrade who helped him to amuse himself,\nand who, if occasion offered, prepared him an infusion. When playing\nwith her, when he held her in his arms, it was as if he had a boy to\ndeal with. He experienced no thrill, and at these moments the idea\nhad never occurred to him of planting a warm kiss on her lips as she\nstruggled with a nervous laugh to free herself.\n\nThe girl also seemed to have remained cold and indifferent. At times\nher great eyes rested on Camille and fixedly gazed at him with sovereign\ncalm. On such occasions her lips alone made almost imperceptible little\nmotions. Nothing could be read on her expressionless countenance, which\nan inexorable will always maintained gentle and attentive. Therese\nbecame grave when the conversation turned to her marriage, contenting\nherself with approving all that Madame Raquin said by a sign of the\nhead. Camille went to sleep.\n\nOn summer evenings, the two young people ran to the edge of the water.\nCamille, irritated at the incessant attentions of his mother, at times\nbroke out in open revolt. He wished to run about and make himself ill,\nto escape the fondling that disgusted him. He would then drag Therese\nalong with him, provoking her to wrestle, to roll in the grass. One day,\nhaving pushed his cousin down, the young girl bounded to her feet with\nall the savageness of a wild beast, and, with flaming face and bloodshot\neyes, fell upon him with clenched fists. Camille in fear sank to the\nground.\n\nMonths and years passed by, and at length the day fixed for the marriage\narrived. Madame Raquin took Therese apart, spoke to her of her father\nand mother, and related to her the story of her birth. The young girl\nlistened to her aunt, and when she had finished speaking, kissed her,\nwithout answering a word.\n\nAt night, Therese, instead of going into her own room, which was on\nthe left of the staircase, entered that of her cousin which was on the\nright. This was all the change that occurred in her mode of life. The\nfollowing day, when the young couple came downstairs, Camille had\nstill his sickly languidness, his righteous tranquillity of an egotist.\nTherese still maintained her gentle indifference, and her restrained\nexpression of frightful calmness.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\nA week after the marriage, Camille distinctly told his mother that he\nintended quitting Vernon to reside in Paris. Madame Raquin protested:\nshe had arranged her mode of life, and would not modify it in any way.\nThereupon her son had a nervous attack, and threatened to fall ill, if\nshe did not give way to his whim.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNever have I opposed you in your plans,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI married my cousin,\nI took all the drugs you gave me. It is only natural, now, when I have\na desire of my own, that you should be of the same mind. We will move at\nthe end of the month.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMadame Raquin was unable to sleep all night. The decision Camille had\ncome to, upset her way of living, and, in despair, she sought to arrange\nanother existence for herself and the married couple. Little by little,\nshe recovered calm. She reflected that the young people might have\nchildren, and that her small fortune would not then suffice. It was\nnecessary to earn money, to go into business again, to find lucrative\noccupation for Therese. The next day she had become accustomed to the\nidea of moving, and had arranged a plan for a new life.\n\nAt luncheon she was quite gay.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is what we will do,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said she to her children. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI will go to Paris\nto-morrow. There I will look out for a small mercery business for sale,\nand Therese and myself will resume selling needles and cotton, which\nwill give us something to do. You, Camille, will act as you like. You\ncan either stroll about in the sun, or you can find some employment.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI shall find employment,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered the young man.\n\nThe truth was that an idiotic ambition had alone impelled Camille to\nleave Vernon. He wished to find a post in some important administration.\nHe blushed with delight when he fancied he saw himself in the middle of\na large office, with lustring elbow sleeves, and a pen behind his ear.\n\nTherese was not consulted: she had always displayed such passive\nobedience that her aunt and husband no longer took the trouble to ask\nher opinion. She went where they went, she did what they did, without a\ncomplaint, without a reproach, without appearing even to be aware that\nshe changed her place of residence.\n\nMadame Raquin came to Paris, and went straight to the Arcade of the Pont\nNeuf. An old maid at Vernon had sent her to one of her relatives who\nin this arcade kept a mercery shop which she desired to get rid of.\nThe former mercer found the shop rather small, and rather dark; but,\nin passing through Paris, she had been taken aback by the noise in the\nstreets, by the luxuriously dressed windows, and this narrow gallery,\nthis modest shop front, recalled her former place of business which was\nso peaceful. She could fancy herself again in the provinces, and she\ndrew a long breath thinking that her dear children would be happy in\nthis out-of-the-way corner. The low price asked for the business, caused\nher to make up her mind. The owner sold it her for 2,000 francs, and the\nrent of the shop and first floor was only 1,200 francs a year. Madame\nRaquin, who had close upon 4,000 francs saved up, calculated that she\ncould pay for the business and settle the rent for the first year,\nwithout encroaching on her fortune. The salary Camille would be\nreceiving, and the profit on the mercery business would suffice, she\nthought, to meet the daily expenses; so that she need not touch the\nincome of her funded money, which would capitalise, and go towards\nproviding marriage portions for her grandchildren.\n\nShe returned to Vernon beaming with pleasure, relating that she had\nfound a gem, a delightful little place right in the centre of Paris.\nLittle by little, at the end of a few days, in her conversations of\nan evening, the damp, obscure shop in the arcade became a palace; she\npictured it to herself, so far as her memory served her, as convenient,\nspacious, tranquil, and replete with a thousand inestimable advantages.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAh! my dear Therese,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said she, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou will see how happy we shall be in\nthat nook! There are three beautiful rooms upstairs. The arcade is\nfull of people. We will make charming displays. There is no fear of our\nfeeling dull.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBut she did not stop there. All her instinct of a former shopkeeper\nwas awakened. She gave advice to Therese, beforehand, as to buying and\nselling, and posted her up in all the tricks of small tradespeople.\nAt length, the family quitted the house beside the Seine, and on the\nevening of the same day, were installed in the Arcade of the Pont Neuf.\n\nWhen Therese entered the shop, where in future she was to live, it\nseemed to her that she was descending into the clammy soil of a grave.\nShe felt quite disheartened, and shivered with fear. She looked at the\ndirty, damp gallery, visited the shop, and ascending to the first floor,\nwalked round each room. These bare apartments, without furniture, looked\nfrightful in their solitude and dilapidation. The young woman could\nnot make a gesture, or utter a word. She was as if frozen. Her aunt and\nhusband having come downstairs, she seated herself on a trunk, her hands\nrigid, her throat full of sobs, and yet she could not cry.\n\nMadame Raquin, face to face with reality, felt embarrassed, and ashamed\nof her dreams. She sought to defend her acquisition. She found a remedy\nfor every fresh inconvenience that was discovered, explaining the\nobscurity by saying the weather was overcast, and concluded by affirming\nthat a sweep-up would suffice to set everything right.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBah!\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Camille, \u00e2\u0080\u009call this is quite suitable. Besides, we shall\nonly come up here at night. I shall not be home before five or six\no\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock. As to you two, you will be together, so you will not be dull.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe young man would never have consented to inhabit such a den, had\nhe not relied on the comfort of his office. He said to himself that\nhe would be warm all day at his administration, and that, at night, he\nwould go to bed early.\n\nFor a whole week, the shop and lodging remained in disorder. Therese had\nseated herself behind the counter from the first day, and she did not\nmove from that place. Madame Raquin was astonished at this depressed\nattitude. She had thought that the young woman would try to adorn her\nhabitation. That she would place flowers at the windows, and ask for new\npapers, curtains and carpets. When she suggested some repairs, some kind\nof embellishment, her niece quietly replied:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat need is there for it? We are very well as we are. There is no\nnecessity for luxury.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nIt was Madame Raquin who had to arrange the rooms and tidy up the shop.\nTherese at last lost patience at seeing the good old lady incessantly\nturning round and round before her eyes; she engaged a charwoman, and\nforced her aunt to be seated beside her.\n\nCamille remained a month without finding employment. He lived as little\nas possible in the shop, preferring to stroll about all day; and he\nfound life so dreadfully dull with nothing to do, that he spoke\nof returning to Vernon. But he at length obtained a post in the\nadministration of the Orleans Railway, where he earned 100 francs a\nmonth. His dream had become realised.\n\nHe set out in the morning at eight o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock. Walking down the Rue\nGuenegaud, he found himself on the quays. Then, taking short steps with\nhis hands in his pockets, he followed the Seine from the Institut to the\nJardin des Plantes. This long journey which he performed twice daily,\nnever wearied him. He watched the water running along, and he stopped\nto see the rafts of wood descending the river, pass by. He thought of\nnothing. Frequently he planted himself before Notre Dame, to contemplate\nthe scaffolding surrounding the cathedral which was then undergoing\nrepair. These huge pieces of timber amused him although he failed to\nunderstand why. Then he cast a glance into the Port aux Vins as he went\npast, and after that counted the cabs coming from the station.\n\nIn the evening, quite stupefied, with his head full of some silly story\nrelated to his office, he crossed the Jardin des Plantes, and went to\nhave a look at the bears, if he was not in too great a hurry. There he\nremained half an hour, leaning over the rails at the top of the pit,\nobserving the animals clumsily swaying to and fro. The behaviour of\nthese huge beasts pleased him. He examined them with gaping mouth and\nrounded eyes, partaking of the joy of an idiot when he perceived them\nbestir themselves. At last he turned homewards, dragging his feet along,\nbusying himself with the passers-by, with the vehicles, and the shops.\n\nAs soon as he arrived he dined, and then began reading. He had purchased\nthe works of Buffon, and, every evening, he set himself to peruse twenty\nto thirty pages, notwithstanding the wearisome nature of the task. He\nalso read in serial, at 10 centimes the number, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe History of the\nConsulate and Empire\u00e2\u0080\u009d by Thiers, and \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe History of the Girondins\u00e2\u0080\u009d by\nLamartine, as well as some popular scientific works. He fancied he was\nlabouring at his education. At times, he forced his wife to listen to\ncertain pages, to particular anecdotes, and felt very much astonished\nthat Therese could remain pensive and silent the whole evening, without\nbeing tempted to take up a book. And he thought to himself that his wife\nmust be a woman of very poor intelligence.\n\nTherese thrust books away from her with impatience. She preferred to\nremain idle, with her eyes fixed, and her thoughts wandering and lost.\nBut she maintained an even, easy temper, exercising all her will to\nrender herself a passive instrument, replete with supreme complaisance\nand abnegation.\n\nThe shop did not do much business. The profit was the same regularly\neach month. The customers consisted of female workpeople living in the\nneighbourhood. Every five minutes a young girl came in to purchase a few\nsous worth of goods. Therese served the people with words that were ever\nthe same, with a smile that appeared mechanically on her lips. Madame\nRaquin displayed a more unbending, a more gossipy disposition, and, to\ntell the truth, it was she who attracted and retained the customers.\n\nFor three years, days followed days and resembled one another. Camille\ndid not once absent himself from his office. His mother and wife hardly\never left the shop. Therese, residing in damp obscurity, in gloomy,\ncrushing silence, saw life expand before her in all its nakedness, each\nnight bringing the same cold couch, and each morn the same empty day.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\nOne day out of seven, on the Thursday evening, the Raquin family\nreceived their friends. They lit a large lamp in the dining-room, and\nput water on the fire to make tea. There was quite a set out. This\nparticular evening emerged in bold relief from the others. It had become\none of the customs of the family, who regarded it in the light of a\nmiddle-class orgie full of giddy gaiety. They did not retire to rest\nuntil eleven o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock at night.\n\nAt Paris Madame Raquin had found one of her old friends, the commissary\nof police Michaud, who had held a post at Vernon for twenty years,\nlodging in the same house as the mercer. A narrow intimacy had thus been\nestablished between them; then, when the widow had sold her business to\ngo and reside in the house beside the river, they had little by little\nlost sight of one another. Michaud left the provinces a few months\nlater, and came to live peacefully in Paris, Rue de Seine, on his\npension of 1,500 francs. One rainy day, he met his old friend in the\nArcade of the Pont Neuf, and the same evening dined with the family.\n\nThe Thursday receptions began in this way: the former commissary of\npolice got into the habit of calling on the Raquins regularly once a\nweek. After a while he came accompanied by his son Olivier, a great\nfellow of thirty, dry and thin, who had married a very little woman,\nslow and sickly. This Olivier held the post of head clerk in the section\nof order and security at the Prefecture of Police, worth 3,000 francs a\nyear, which made Camille feel particularly jealous. From the first day\nhe made his appearance, Therese detested this cold, rigid individual,\nwho imagined he honoured the shop in the arcade by making a display of\nhis great shrivelled-up frame, and the exhausted condition of his poor\nlittle wife.\n\nCamille introduced another guest, an old clerk at the Orleans Railway,\nnamed Grivet, who had been twenty years in the service of the company,\nwhere he now held the position of head clerk, and earned 2,100 francs\na year. It was he who gave out the work in the office where Camille had\nfound employment, and the latter showed him certain respect. Camille, in\nhis day dreams, had said to himself that Grivet would one day die,\nand that he would perhaps take his place at the end of a decade or\nso. Grivet was delighted at the welcome Madame Raquin gave him, and\nhe returned every week with perfect regularity. Six months later, his\nThursday visit had become, in his way of thinking, a duty: he went\nto the Arcade of the Pont Neuf, just as he went every morning to his\noffice, that is to say mechanically, and with the instinct of a brute.\n\nFrom this moment, the gatherings became charming. At seven o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock\nMadame Raquin lit the fire, set the lamp in the centre of the table,\nplaced a box of dominoes beside it, and wiped the tea service which was\nin the sideboard. Precisely at eight o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock old Michaud and Grivet met\nbefore the shop, one coming from the Rue de Seine, and the other from\nthe Rue Mazarine. As soon as they entered, all the family went up to the\nfirst floor. There, in the dining-room, they seated themselves round the\ntable waiting for Olivier Michaud and his wife who always arrived late.\nWhen the party was complete, Madame Raquin poured out the tea. Camille\nemptied the box of dominoes on the oilcloth table cover, and everyone\nbecame deeply interested in their hands. Henceforth nothing could be\nheard but the jingle of dominoes. At the end of each game, the players\nquarrelled for two or three minutes, then mournful silence was resumed,\nbroken by the sharp clanks of the dominoes.\n\nTherese played with an indifference that irritated Camille. She took\nFrancois, the great tabby cat that Madame Raquin had brought from\nVernon, on her lap, caressing it with one hand, whilst she placed her\ndominoes with the other. These Thursday evenings were a torture to her.\nFrequently she complained of being unwell, of a bad headache, so as not\nto play, and remain there doing nothing, and half asleep. An elbow on\nthe table, her cheek resting on the palm of her hand, she watched the\nguests of her aunt and husband through a sort of yellow, smoky mist\ncoming from the lamp. All these faces exasperated her. She looked from\none to the other in profound disgust and secret irritation.\n\nOld Michaud exhibited a pasty countenance, spotted with red blotches,\none of those death-like faces of an old man fallen into second\nchildhood; Grivet had the narrow visage, the round eyes, the thin lips\nof an idiot. Olivier, whose bones were piercing his cheeks, gravely\ncarried a stiff, insignificant head on a ridiculous body; as to Suzanne,\nthe wife of Olivier, she was quite pale, with expressionless eyes, white\nlips, and a soft face. And Therese could not find one human being, not\none living being among these grotesque and sinister creatures, with whom\nshe was shut up; sometimes she had hallucinations, she imagined herself\nburied at the bottom of a tomb, in company with mechanical corpses, who,\nwhen the strings were pulled, moved their heads, and agitated their\nlegs and arms. The thick atmosphere of the dining-room stifled her; the\nshivering silence, the yellow gleams of the lamp penetrated her with\nvague terror, and inexpressible anguish.\n\nBelow, to the door of the shop, they had fixed a bell whose sharp tinkle\nannounced the entrance of customers. Therese had her ear on the alert;\nand when the bell rang, she rapidly ran downstairs quite relieved,\ndelighted at being able to quit the dining-room. She slowly served the\npurchaser, and when she found herself alone, she sat down behind the\ncounter where she remained as long as possible, dreading going upstairs\nagain, and in the enjoyment of real pleasure at no longer having Grivet\nand Olivier before her eyes. The damp air of the shop calmed the burning\nfever of her hands, and she again fell into the customary grave reverie.\n\nBut she could not remain like this for long. Camille became angry at her\nabsence. He failed to comprehend how anyone could prefer the shop to the\ndining-room on a Thursday evening, and he leant over the banister, to\nlook for his wife.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the matter?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he would shout. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat are you doing there? Why\ndon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you come up? Grivet has the devil\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own luck. He has just won\nagain.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe young woman rose painfully, and ascending to the dining-room resumed\nher seat opposite old Michaud, whose pendent lips gave heartrending\nsmiles. And, until eleven o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock, she remained oppressed in her chair,\nwatching Francois whom she held in her arms, so as to avoid seeing the\ncardboard dolls grimacing around her.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\nOne Thursday, Camille, on returning from his office, brought with him a\ngreat fellow with square shoulders, whom he pushed in a familiar manner\ninto the shop.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMother,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said to Madame Raquin, pointing to the newcomer, \u00e2\u0080\u009cdo you\nrecognise this gentleman?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe old mercer looked at the strapping blade, seeking among her\nrecollections and finding nothing, while Therese placidly observed the\nscene.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat!\u00e2\u0080\u009d resumed Camille, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t recognise Laurent, little Laurent,\nthe son of daddy Laurent who owns those beautiful fields of corn out\nJeufosse way. Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you remember? I went to school with him; he came\nto fetch me of a morning on leaving the house of his uncle, who was our\nneighbour, and you used to give him slices of bread and jam.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAll at once Madame Raquin recollected little Laurent, whom she found\nvery much grown. It was quite ten years since she had seen him. She now\ndid her best to make him forget her lapse of memory in greeting him,\nby recalling a thousand little incidents of the past, and by adopting a\nwheedling manner towards him that was quite maternal. Laurent had seated\nhimself. With a peaceful smile on his lips, he replied to the questions\naddressed to him in a clear voice, casting calm and easy glances around\nhim.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cJust imagine,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Camille, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthis joker has been employed at the\nOrleans-Railway-Station for eighteen months, and it was only to-night\nthat we met and recognised one another--the administration is so vast,\nso important!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAs the young man made this remark, he opened his eyes wider, and pinched\nhis lips, proud to be a humble wheel in such a large machine. Shaking\nhis head, he continued:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh! but he is in a good position. He has studied. He already earns\n1,500 francs a year. His father sent him to college. He had read for the\nbar, and learnt painting. That is so, is it not, Laurent? You\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll dine\nwith us?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI am quite willing,\u00e2\u0080\u009d boldly replied the other.\n\nHe got rid of his hat and made himself comfortable in the shop,\nwhile Madame Raquin ran off to her stewpots. Therese, who had not yet\npronounced a word, looked at the new arrival. She had never seen such a\nman before. Laurent, who was tall and robust, with a florid complexion,\nastonished her. It was with a feeling akin to admiration, that she\ncontemplated his low forehead planted with coarse black hair, his full\ncheeks, his red lips, his regular features of sanguineous beauty. For\nan instant her eyes rested on his neck, a neck that was thick and short,\nfat and powerful. Then she became lost in the contemplation of his great\nhands which he kept spread out on his knees: the fingers were square;\nthe clenched fist must be enormous and would fell an ox.\n\nLaurent was a real son of a peasant, rather heavy in gait, with an\narched back, with movements that were slow and precise, and an\nobstinate tranquil manner. One felt that his apparel concealed round and\nwell-developed muscles, and a body of thick hard flesh. Therese examined\nhim with curiosity, glancing from his fists to his face, and experienced\nlittle shivers when her eyes fell on his bull-like neck.\n\nCamille spread out his Buffon volumes, and his serials at 10 centimes\nthe number, to show his friend that he also studied. Then, as if\nanswering an inquiry he had been making of himself for some minutes, he\nsaid to Laurent:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut, surely you must know my wife? Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you remember that little\ncousin who used to play with us at Vernon?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI had no difficulty in recognising Madame,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Laurent, looking\nTherese full in the face.\n\nThis penetrating glance troubled the young woman, who, nevertheless,\ngave a forced smile, and after exchanging a few words with Laurent and\nher husband, hurried away to join her aunt, feeling ill at ease.\n\nAs soon as they had seated themselves at table, and commenced the soup,\nCamille thought it right to be attentive to his friend.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHow is your father?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he inquired.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Laurent. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe are not on good terms; we\nceased corresponding five years ago.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBah!\u00e2\u0080\u009d exclaimed the clerk, astonished at such a monstrosity.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d continued the other, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe dear man has ideas of his own. As he\nis always at law with his neighbours, he sent me to college, in the fond\nhope that later on, he would find in me an advocate who would win him\nall his actions. Oh! daddy Laurent has naught but useful ambitions; he\neven wants to get something out of his follies.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd you wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be an advocate?\u00e2\u0080\u009d inquired Camille, more and more\nastonished.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cFaith, no,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered his friend with a smile. \u00e2\u0080\u009cFor a couple of years\nI pretended to follow the classes, so as to draw the allowance of 1,200\nfrancs which my father made me. I lived with one of my college chums,\nwho is a painter, and I set about painting also. It amused me. The\ncalling is droll, and not at all fatiguing. We smoked and joked all the\nlivelong day.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe Raquin family opened their eyes in amazement.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cUnfortunately,\u00e2\u0080\u009d continued Laurent, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthis could not last. My father\nfound out that I was telling him falsehoods. He stopped my 100 francs\na month, and invited me to return and plough the land with him. I then\ntried to paint pictures on religious subjects which proved bad business.\nAs I could plainly see that I was going to die of hunger, I sent art to\nthe deuce and sought employment. My father will die one of these days,\nand I am waiting for that event to live and do nothing.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nLaurent spoke in a tranquil tone. In a few words he had just related a\ncharacteristic tale that depicted him at full length. In reality he was\nan idle fellow, with the appetite of a full-blooded man for everything,\nand very pronounced ideas as to easy and lasting employment. The only\nambition of this great powerful frame was to do nothing, to grovel in\nidleness and satiation from hour to hour. He wanted to eat well, sleep\nwell, to abundantly satisfy his passions, without moving from his place,\nwithout running the risk of the slightest fatigue.\n\nThe profession of advocate had terrified him, and he shuddered at\nthe idea of tilling the soil. He had plunged into art, hoping to find\ntherein a calling suitable to an idle man. The paint-brush struck him\nas being an instrument light to handle, and he fancied success easy.\nHis dream was a life of cheap sensuality, a beautiful existence full of\nhouris, of repose on divans, of victuals and intoxication.\n\nThe dream lasted so long as daddy Laurent sent the crown pieces. But\nwhen the young man, who was already thirty, perceived the wolf at the\ndoor, he began to reflect. Face to face with privations, he felt himself\na coward. He would not have accepted a day without bread, for the utmost\nglory art could bestow. As he had said himself, he sent art to the\ndeuce, as soon as he recognised that it would never suffice to satisfy\nhis numerous requirements. His first efforts had been below mediocrity;\nhis peasant eyes caught a clumsy, slovenly view of nature; his muddy,\nbadly drawn, grimacing pictures, defied all criticism.\n\nBut he did not seem to have an over-dose of vanity for an artist; he was\nnot in dire despair when he had to put aside his brushes. All he really\nregretted was the vast studio of his college chum, where he had been\nvoluptuously grovelling for four or five years. He also regretted the\nwomen who came to pose there. Nevertheless he found himself at ease in\nhis position as clerk; he lived very well in a brutish fashion, and he\nwas fond of this daily task, which did not fatigue him, and soothed\nhis mind. Still one thing irritated him: the food at the eighteen sous\nordinaries failed to appease the gluttonous appetite of his stomach.\n\nAs Camille listened to his friend, he contemplated him with all the\nastonishment of a simpleton. This feeble man was dreaming, in a childish\nmanner, of this studio life which his friend had been alluding to, and\nhe questioned Laurent on the subject.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSo,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthere were lady models who posed before you in the\nnude?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh! yes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Laurent with a smile, and looking at Therese, who\nhad turned deadly pale.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou must have thought that very funny,\u00e2\u0080\u009d continued Camille, laughing\nlike a child. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt would have made me feel most awkward. I expect you\nwere quite scandalised the first time it happened.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nLaurent had spread out one of his great hands and was attentively\nlooking at the palm. His fingers gave slight twitches, and his cheeks\nbecame flushed.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe first time,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he answered, as if speaking to himself, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI fancy I\nthought it quite natural. This devilish art is exceedingly amusing, only\nit does not bring in a sou. I had a red-haired girl as model who was\nsuperb, firm white flesh, gorgeous bust, hips as wide as . . .\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nLaurent, raising his head, saw Therese mute and motionless opposite,\ngazing at him with ardent fixedness. Her dull black eyes seemed like\ntwo fathomless holes, and through her parted lips could be perceived the\nrosy tint of the inside of her mouth. She seemed as if overpowered by\nwhat she heard, and lost in thought. She continued listening.\n\nLaurent looked from Therese to Camille, and the former painter\nrestrained a smile. He completed his phrase by a broad voluptuous\ngesture, which the young woman followed with her eyes. They were at\ndessert, and Madame Raquin had just run downstairs to serve a customer.\n\nWhen the cloth was removed Laurent, who for some minutes had been\nthoughtful, turned to Camille.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou know,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he blurted out, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI must paint your portrait.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThis idea delighted Madame Raquin and her son, but Therese remained\nsilent.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is summer-time,\u00e2\u0080\u009d resumed Laurent, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand as we leave the office at\nfour o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock, I can come here, and let you give me a sitting for a\ncouple of hours in the evening. The picture will be finished in a week.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat will be fine,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Camille, flushed with joy. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou shall dine\nwith us. I will have my hair curled, and put on my black frock coat.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nEight o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock struck. Grivet and Michaud made their entry. Olivier and\nSuzanne arrived behind them.\n\nWhen Camille introduced his friend to the company, Grivet pinched his\nlips. He detested Laurent whose salary, according to his idea, had risen\nfar too rapidly. Besides, the introduction of a new-comer was quite an\nimportant matter, and the guests of the Raquins could not receive an\nindividual unknown to them, without some display of coldness.\n\nLaurent behaved very amicably. He grasped the situation, and did his\nbest to please the company, so as to make himself acceptable to them at\nonce. He related anecdotes, enlivened the party by his merry laughter,\nand even won the friendship of Grivet.\n\nThat evening Therese made no attempt to go down to the shop. She\nremained seated on her chair until eleven o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock, playing and talking,\navoiding the eyes of Laurent, who for that matter did not trouble\nhimself about her. The sanguineous temperament of this strapping fellow,\nhis full voice and jovial laughter, troubled the young woman and threw\nher into a sort of nervous anguish.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\nHenceforth, Laurent called almost every evening on the Raquins. He lived\nin the Rue Saint-Victor, opposite the Port aux Vins, where he rented a\nsmall furnished room at 18 francs a month. This attic, pierced at the\ntop by a lift-up window, measured barely nine square yards, and Laurent\nwas in the habit of going home as late as possible at night. Previous to\nhis meeting with Camille, the state of his purse not permitting him to\nidle away his time in the cafes, he loitered at the cheap eating-houses\nwhere he took his dinner, smoking his pipe and sipping his coffee\nand brandy which cost him three sous. Then he slowly gained the Rue\nSaint-Victor, sauntering along the quays, where he seated himself on the\nbenches, in mild weather.\n\nThe shop in the Arcade of the Pont Neuf became a charming retreat, warm\nand quiet, where he found amicable conversation and attention. He\nsaved the three sous his coffee and brandy cost him, and gluttonously\nswallowed the excellent tea prepared by Madame Raquin. He remained\nthere until ten o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock, dozing and digesting as if he were at home; and\nbefore taking his departure, assisted Camille to put up the shutters and\nclose the shop for the night.\n\nOne evening, he came with his easel and box of colours. He was to\ncommence the portrait of Camille on the morrow. A canvas was purchased,\nminute preparations made, and the artist at last took the work in hand\nin the room occupied by the married couple, where Laurent said the light\nwas the best.\n\nHe took three evenings to draw the head. He carefully trailed the\ncharcoal over the canvas with short, sorry strokes, his rigid, cold\ndrawing recalling in a grotesque fashion that of the primitive masters.\nHe copied the face of Camille with a hesitating hand, as a pupil copies\nan academical figure, with a clumsy exactitude that conveyed a scowl to\nthe face. On the fourth day, he placed tiny little dabs of colour on\nhis palette, and commenced painting with the point of the brush; he\nthen dotted the canvas with small dirty spots, and made short strokes\naltogether as if he had been using a pencil.\n\nAt the end of each sitting, Madame Raquin and Camille were in ecstasies.\nBut Laurent said they must wait, that the resemblance would soon come.\n\nSince the portrait had been commenced, Therese no longer quitted the\nroom, which had been transformed into a studio. Leaving her aunt alone\nbehind the counter, she ran upstairs at the least pretext, and forgot\nherself watching Laurent paint.\n\nStill grave and oppressed, paler and more silent, she sat down and\nobserved the labour of the brushes. But this sight did not seem to amuse\nher very much. She came to the spot, as though attracted by some power,\nand she remained, as if riveted there. Laurent at times turned round,\nwith a smile, inquiring whether the portrait pleased her. But she barely\nanswered, a shiver ran through her frame, and she resumed her meditative\ntrance.\n\nLaurent, returning at night to the Rue Saint-Victor, reasoned with\nhimself at length, discussing in his mind, whether he should become the\nlover of Therese, or not.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHere is a little woman,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he to himself, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwho will be my sweetheart\nwhenever I choose. She is always there, behind my back, examining,\nmeasuring me, summing me up. She trembles. She has a strange face that\nis mute and yet impassioned. What a miserable creature that Camille is,\nto be sure.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd Laurent inwardly laughed as he thought of his pale, thin friend.\nThen he resumed:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cShe is bored to death in that shop. I go there, because I have nowhere\nelse to go to, otherwise they would not often catch me in the Arcade\nof the Pont Neuf. It is damp and sad. A woman must be wearied to death\nthere. I please her, I am sure of it; then, why not me rather than\nanother?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe stopped. Self-conceit was getting the better of him. Absorbed in\nthought, he watched the Seine running by.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnyhow, come what may,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he exclaimed, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI shall kiss her at the first\nopportunity. I bet she falls at once into my arms.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAs he resumed his walk, he was seized with indecision.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut she is ugly,\u00e2\u0080\u009d thought he. \u00e2\u0080\u009cShe has a long nose, and a big mouth.\nBesides, I have not the least love for her. I shall perhaps get myself\ninto trouble. The matter requires reflection.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nLaurent, who was very prudent, turned these thoughts over in his head\nfor a whole week. He calculated all the possible inconveniences of an\nintrigue with Therese, and only decided to attempt the adventure, when\nhe felt convinced that it could be attended by no evil consequences.\nTherese would have every interest to conceal their intimacy, and he\ncould get rid of her whenever he pleased. Even admitting that Camille\ndiscovered everything, and got angry, he would knock him down, if\nhe became spiteful. From every point of view that matter appeared to\nLaurent easy and engaging.\n\nHenceforth he enjoyed gentle quietude, waiting for the hour to strike.\nHe had made up his mind to act boldly at the first opportunity. In the\nfuture he saw comfortable evenings, with all the Raquins contributing to\nhis enjoyment: Therese giving him her love, Madame Raquin wheedling him\nlike a mother, and Camille chatting with him so that he might not feel\ntoo dull, at night, in the shop.\n\nThe portrait was almost completed, but the opportunity he desired did\nnot occur. Therese, depressed and anxious, continued to remain in the\nroom. But so did Camille, and Laurent was in despair at being unable\nto get rid of him. Nevertheless, the time came when he found himself\nobliged to mention that the portrait would be finished on the morrow,\nand Madame Raquin thereupon announced that they would celebrate the\ncompletion of the work of the artist by dining together.\n\nThe next day, when Laurent had given the canvas the last touch, all the\nfamily assembled to go into raptures over the striking resemblance. The\nportrait was vile, a dirty grey colour with large violescent patches.\nLaurent could not use even the brightest colours, without making\nthem dull and muddy. In spite of himself he had exaggerated the wan\ncomplexion of his model, and the countenance of Camille resembled the\ngreenish visage of a person who had met death by drowning. The grimacing\ndrawing threw the features into convulsions, thus rendering the sinister\nresemblance all the more striking. But Camille was delighted; he\ndeclared that he had the appearance of a person of distinction on the\ncanvas.\n\nWhen he had thoroughly admired his own face, he declared he would go and\nfetch a couple of bottles of champagne. Madame Raquin went down to the\nshop, and the artist was alone with Therese.\n\nThe young woman had remained seated, gazing vaguely in front of her.\nLaurent hesitated. He examined the portrait, and played with his\nbrushes. There was not much time to lose. Camille might come back, and\nthe opportunity would perhaps not occur again. The painter abruptly\nturned round, and found himself face to face with Therese.\n\nThey contemplated one another for a few seconds. Then, with a violent\nmovement, Laurent bent down, and pressed the young woman to him.\nThrowing back her head he crushed her mouth beneath his lips. She made\na savage, angry effort at revolt, and, then all at once gave in. They\nexchanged not a word. The act was silent and brutal.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\nThe two sweethearts from the commencement found their intrigue\nnecessary, inevitable and quite natural. At their first interview they\nconversed familiarly, kissing one another without embarrassment, and\nwithout a blush, as if their intimacy had dated back several years. They\nlived quite at ease in their new situation, with a tranquillity and an\nindependence that were perfect.\n\nThey made their appointments. Therese being unable to go out, it was\narranged that Laurent should come to see her. In a clear, firm voice the\nyoung woman explained to him the plan she had conceived. The interview\nwould take place in the nuptial chamber. The sweetheart would pass by\nthe passage which ran into the arcade, and Therese would open the door\non the staircase to him. During this time, Camille would be at his\noffice, and Madame Raquin below, in the shop. This was a daring\narrangement that ought to succeed.\n\nLaurent accepted. There was a sort of brutal temerity in his prudence,\nthe temerity of a man with big fists. Choosing a pretext, he obtained\npermission from his chief to absent himself for a couple of hours, and\nhastened to the Arcade of the Pont Neuf.\n\nThe dealer in imitation jewelry was seated just opposite the door of\nthe passage, and he had to wait until she was busy, until some young\nwork-girl came to purchase a ring or a brooch made of brass. Then,\nrapidly entering the passage, he ascended the narrow, dark staircase,\nleaning against the walls which were clammy with damp. He stumbled\nagainst the stone steps, and each time he did so, he felt a red-hot iron\npiercing his chest. A door opened, and on the threshold, in the midst of\na gleam of white light he perceived Therese, who closing the door after\nhim, threw her arms about his neck.\n\nLaurent was astonished to find his sweetheart handsome. He had never\nseen her before as she appeared to him then. Therese, supple and strong,\npressed him in her arms, flinging her head backward, while on her visage\ncoursed ardent rays of light and passionate smiles. This face seemed as\nif transfigured, with its moist lips and sparkling eyes. It now had\na fond caressing look. It radiated. She was beautiful with the strong\nbeauty born of passionate abandon.\n\nWhen Laurent parted from her, after his initial visit, he staggered like\na drunken man, and the next day, on recovering his cunning prudent calm,\nhe asked himself whether he should return to this young woman whose\nkisses gave him the fever. First of all he positively decided to keep to\nhimself. Then he had a cowardly feeling. He sought to forget, to avoid\nseeing Therese, and yet she always seemed to be there, implacably\nextending her arms. The physical suffering that this spectacle caused\nhim became intolerable.\n\nHe gave way. He arranged another meeting, and returned to the Arcade of\nthe Pont Neuf.\n\nFrom that day forth, Therese entered into his life. He did not yet\naccept her, although he bore with her. He had his hours of terror,\nhis moments of prudence, and, altogether this intrigue caused him\ndisagreeable agitation. But his discomfort and his fears disappeared.\nThe meetings continued and multiplied.\n\nTherese experienced no hesitation. She went straight where her passion\nurged her to go. This woman whom circumstances had bowed down, and who\nhad at length drawn herself up erect, now revealed all her being and\nexplained her life.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh! if you only knew,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said she, \u00e2\u0080\u009chow I have suffered. I was brought\nup in the tepid damp room of an invalid. I slept in the same bed as\nCamille. At night I got as far away from him as I could, to avoid the\nsickly odour of his body. He was naughty and obstinate. He would not\ntake his physic unless I shared it with him. To please my aunt I was\nobliged to swallow a dose of every drug. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know how it is I\nhave survived. They made me ugly. They robbed me of the only thing I\npossessed, and it is impossible for you to love me as I love you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe broke off and wept, and after kissing Laurent, continued with bitter\nhatred:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI do not wish them any harm. They brought me up, they received me,\nand shielded me from misery. But I should have preferred abandonment to\ntheir hospitality. I had a burning desire for the open air. When quite\nyoung, my dream was to rove barefooted along the dusty roads, holding\nout my hand for charity, living like a gipsy. I have been told that my\nmother was a daughter of the chief of a tribe in Africa. I have often\nthought of her, and I understood that I belonged to her by blood and\ninstinct. I should have liked to have never parted from her, and to have\ncrossed the sand slung at her back.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAh! what a childhood! I still feel disgust and rebellion, when I recall\nthe long days I passed in the room where Camille was at death\u00e2\u0080\u0099s door.\nI sat bent over the fire, stupidly watching the infusions simmer, and\nfeeling my limbs growing stiff. And I could not move. My aunt scolded me\nif I made a noise. Later on, I tasted profound joy in the little house\nbeside the river; but I was already half feeble, I could barely walk,\nand when I tried to run I fell down. Then they buried me alive in this\nvile shop.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAfter a pause, she resumed:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou will hardly credit how bad they have made me. They have turned\nme into a liar and a hypocrite. They have stifled me with their\nmiddle-class gentleness, and I can hardly understand how it is that\nthere is still blood in my veins. I have lowered my eyes, and given\nmyself a mournful, idiotic face like theirs. I have led their deathlike\nlife. When you saw me I looked like a blockhead, did I not? I was grave,\noverwhelmed, brutalised. I no longer had any hope. I thought of flinging\nmyself into the Seine.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut previous to this depression, what nights of anger I had. Down there\nat Vernon, in my frigid room, I bit my pillow to stifle my cries. I beat\nmyself, taxed myself with cowardice. My blood was on the boil, and I\nwould have lacerated my body. On two occasions, I wanted to run away, to\ngo straight before me, towards the sun; but my courage failed. They had\nturned me into a docile brute with their tame benevolence and sickly\ntenderness. Then I lied, I always lied. I remained there quite gentle,\nquite silent, dreaming of striking and biting.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAfter a silence, she continued:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI do not know why I consented to marry Camille. I did not protest, from\na feeling of a sort of disdainful indifference. I pitied the child. When\nI played with him, I felt my fingers sink into the flesh of his limbs\nas into damp clay. I took him because my aunt offered him to me, and\nbecause I never intended to place any restraint on my actions on his\naccount.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI found my husband just the same little suffering boy whose bed I\nhad shared when I was six years old. He was just as frail, just as\nplaintive, and he still had that insipid odour of a sick child that had\nbeen so repugnant to me previously. I am relating all this so that you\nmay not be jealous. I was seized with a sort of disgust. I remembered\nthe physic I had drank. I got as far away from him as the bed would\nallow, and I passed terrible nights. But you, you----\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nTherese drew herself up, bending backward, her fingers imprisoned in the\nmassive hands of Laurent, gazing at his broad shoulders, and enormous\nneck.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou, I love you,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she continued. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI loved you from the day Camille\npushed you into the shop. You have perhaps no esteem for me, because I\ngave way at once. Truly, I know not how it happened. I am proud. I am\npassionate. I would have liked to have beaten you, the first day, when\nyou kissed me. I do not know how it was I loved you; I hated you rather.\nThe sight of you irritated me, and made me suffer. When you were there,\nmy nerves were strained fit to snap. My head became quite empty. I was\nready to commit a crime.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh! how I suffered! And I sought this suffering. I waited for you to\narrive. I loitered round your chair, so as to move in your breath, to\ndrag my clothes over yours. It seemed as though your blood cast puffs of\nheat on me as I passed, and it was this sort of burning cloud in which\nyou were enveloped, that attracted me, and detained me beside you in\nspite of my secret revolt. You remember when you were painting here:\na fatal power attracted me to your side, and I breathed your air with\ncruel delight. I know I seemed to be begging for kisses, I felt ashamed\nof my bondage, I felt I should fall, if you were to touch me. But I gave\nway to my cowardice, I shivered with cold, waiting until you chose to\ntake me in your arms.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWhen Therese ceased speaking, she was quivering, as though proud at\nbeing avenged. In this bare and chilly room were enacted scenes of\nburning lust, sinister in their brutality.\n\nOn her part Therese seemed to revel in daring. The only precaution she\nwould take when expecting her lover was to tell her aunt she was going\nupstairs to rest. But then, when he was there she never bothered about\navoiding noise, walking about and talking. At first this terrified\nLaurent.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cFor God\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sake,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he whispered, \u00e2\u0080\u009cdon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t make so much noise. Madame Raquin\nwill hear.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nTherese would laugh. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWho cares, you are always so worried. She is at\nher counter and won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t leave. She is too afraid of being robbed. Besides,\nyou can hide.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nLaurent\u00e2\u0080\u0099s passion had not yet stifled his native peasant caution, but\nsoon he grew used to the risks of these meetings, only a few yards from\nthe old woman.\n\nOne day, fearing her niece was ill, Madame Raquin climbed the stairs.\nTherese never bothered to bolt the bedroom door.\n\nAt the sound of the woman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s heavy step on the wooden stairs, Laurent\nbecame frantic. Therese laughed as she saw him searching for his\nwaistcoat and hat. She grabbed his arm and pushed him down at the foot\nof the bed. With perfect self-possession she whispered:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cStay there. Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t move.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe threw all his clothes that were lying about over him and covered\nthem with a white petticoat she had taken off. Without losing her calm,\nshe lay down, half-naked, with her hair loose.\n\nWhen Madame Raquin quietly opened the door and tiptoed to the bed the\nyounger woman pretended to be asleep. Laurent, under all the clothes was\nin a panic.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTherese,\u00e2\u0080\u009d asked the old lady with some concern, \u00e2\u0080\u009care you all right, my\ndear?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nTherese, opening her eyes and yawning, answered that she had a terrible\nmigraine. She begged her aunt to let her sleep some more. The old lady\nleft the room as quietly as she had entered it.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSo you see,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Therese said triumphantly, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthere is no reason to worry.\nThese people are not in love. They are blind.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAt other times Therese seemed quite mad, wandering in her mind. She\nwould see the cat, sitting motionless and dignified, looking at them.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLook at Francois,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said to Laurent. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou\u00e2\u0080\u0099d think he understands and\nis planning to tell Camille everything to-night. He knows a thing or two\nabout us. Wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t it be funny if one day, in the shop, he just started\ntalking.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThis idea was delightful to Therese but Laurent felt a shudder run\nthrough him as he looked at the cat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s big green eyes. Therese\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hold on\nhim was not total and he was scared. He got up and put the cat out of\nthe room.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\nLaurent was perfectly happy of an evening, in the shop. He generally\nreturned from the office with Camille. Madame Raquin had formed quite\na motherly affection for him. She knew he was short of cash, and\nindifferently nourished, that he slept in a garret; and she had told\nhim, once for all, that a seat would always be kept for him at their\ntable. She liked this young fellow with that expansive feeling that old\nwomen display for people who come from their own part of the country,\nbringing with them memories of the past.\n\nThe young man took full advantage of this hospitality. Before going to\ndinner, after leaving the office for the night, he and Camille went for\na stroll on the quays. Both found satisfaction in this intimacy. They\ndawdled along, chatting with one another, which prevented them feeling\ndull, and after a time decided to go and taste the soup prepared by\nMadame Raquin. Laurent opened the shop door as if he were master of\nthe house, seated himself astride a chair, smoking and expectorating as\nthough at home.\n\nThe presence of Therese did not embarrass him in the least. He treated\nthe young woman with friendly familiarity, paying her commonplace\ncompliments without a line of his face becoming disturbed. Camille\nlaughed, and, as his wife confined herself to answering his friend in\nmonosyllables, he firmly believed they detested one another. One day he\neven reproached Therese with what he termed her coldness for Laurent.\n\nLaurent had made a correct guess: he had become the sweetheart of the\nwoman, the friend of the husband, the spoilt child of the mother. Never\nhad he enjoyed such a capital time. His position in the family struck\nhim as quite natural. He was on the most friendly terms with Camille,\nin regard to whom he felt neither anger nor remorse. He was so sure of\nbeing prudent and calm that he did not even keep watch on his gestures\nand speech. The egotism he displayed in the enjoyment of his good\nfortune, shielded him from any fault. All that kept him from kissing\nTherese in the shop was the fear that he would not be allowed to come\nany more. He would not have cared a bit about hurting Camille and his\nmother.\n\nTherese, who was of a more nervous and quivering temperament, was\ncompelled to play a part, and she played it to perfection, thanks to the\nclever hypocrisy she had acquired in her bringing up. For nearly fifteen\nyears, she had been lying, stifling her fever, exerting an implacable\nwill to appear gloomy and half asleep. It cost her nothing to keep this\nmask on her face, which gave her an appearance of icy frigidity.\n\nWhen Laurent entered the shop, he found her glum, her nose longer, her\nlips thinner. She was ugly, cross, unapproachable. Nevertheless, she\ndid not exaggerate her effects, but only played her former part, without\nawakening attention by greater harshness. She experienced extraordinary\npleasure in deceiving Camille and Madame Raquin. She was aware she was\ndoing wrong, and at times she felt a ferocious desire to rise from table\nand smother Laurent with kisses, just to show her husband and aunt that\nshe was not a fool, and that she had a sweetheart.\n\nAt moments, she felt giddy with joy; good actress as she proved\nherself, she could not on such occasions refrain from singing, when her\nsweetheart did not happen to be there, and she had no fear of betraying\nherself. These sudden outbursts of gaiety charmed Madame Raquin, who\ntaxed her niece with being too serious. The young woman, moreover,\ndecked the window of her room with pots of flowers, and then had new\npaper hung in the apartment. After this she wanted a carpet, curtains\nand rosewood furniture.\n\nThe nature of the circumstances seemed to have made this woman for this\nman, and to have thrust one towards the other. The two together, the\nwoman nervous and hypocritical, the man sanguineous and leading the\nlife of a brute, formed a powerful couple allied. The one completed the\nother, and they mutually protected themselves. At night, at table, in\nthe pale light of the lamp, one felt the strength of their union, at\nthe sight of the heavy, smiling face of Laurent, opposite the mute,\nimpenetrable mask of Therese.\n\nThose evenings were pleasant and calm. In the silence, in the\ntransparent shadow and cool atmosphere, arose friendly conversation.\nThe family and their guest sat close together round the table. After\nthe dessert, they chatted about a thousand trifles of the day, about\nincidents that had occurred the day before, about their hopes for the\nmorrow.\n\nCamille liked Laurent, as much as he was capable of liking anybody,\nafter the fashion of a contented egotist, and Laurent seemed to show him\nequal attachment. Between them there was an exchange of kind sentences,\nof obliging gestures, and thoughtful attentions. Madame Raquin, with\nplacid countenance, contributed her peacefulness to the tranquillity\nof the scene, which resembled a gathering of old friends who knew one\nanother to the heart, and who confidently relied on the faith of their\nfriendship.\n\nTherese, motionless, peaceful like the others, observed this joy, this\nsmiling depression of these people of the middle class, and in her heart\nthere was savage laughter; all her being jeered, but her face maintained\nits frigid rigidity. Ah! how she deceived these worthy people, and how\ndelighted she was to deceive them with such triumphant impudence. Her\nsweetheart, at this moment, was like a person unknown to her, a comrade\nof her husband, a sort of simpleton and interloper concerning whom she\nhad no need to concern herself. This atrocious comedy, these duperies of\nlife, this comparison between the burning kisses in the daytime, and the\nindifference played at night, gave new warmth to the blood of the young\nwoman.\n\nWhen by chance Madame Raquin and Camille went downstairs, Therese\nbounded from her chair, to silently, and with brutal energy, press her\nlips to those of her sweetheart, remaining thus breathless and choking\nuntil she heard the stairs creak. Then, she briskly seated herself\nagain, and resumed her glum grimace, while Laurent calmly continued the\ninterrupted conversation with Camille. It was like a rapid, blinding\nflash of lightning in a leaden sky.\n\nOn Thursday, the evening became a little more animated. Laurent,\nalthough bored to death, nevertheless made a point of not missing one\nof these gatherings. As a measure of prudence he desired to be known and\nesteemed by the friends of Camille. So he had to lend an ear to the idle\ntalk of Grivet and old Michaud. The latter always related the same tales\nof robbery and murder, while Grivet spoke at the same time about his\nclerks, his chiefs, and his administration, until the young man\nsought refuge beside Olivier and Suzanne, whose stupidity seemed less\nwearisome. But he soon asked for the dominoes.\n\nIt was on Thursday evening that Laurent and Therese arranged the day\nand hour of their meeting. In the bustle attending the departure, when\nMadame Raquin and Camille accompanied the guest to the door of the\narcade, the young woman approached Laurent, to whom she spoke in an\nundertone, as she pressed his hand. At times, when all had turned their\nbacks, she kissed him, out of a sort of bravado.\n\nThe life of shocks and appeasements, lasted eight months. The\nsweethearts lived in complete beatitude; Therese no longer felt dull,\nand was perfectly contented. Laurent satiated, pampered, fatter than\nbefore, had but one fear, that of seeing this delightful existence come\nto an end.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\nOne afternoon, as Laurent was leaving his office to run and meet Therese\nwho was expecting him, his chief gave him to understand that in future\nhe was forbidden to absent himself. He had taken too many holidays\nalready, and the authorities had decided to dismiss him if he again went\nout in office hours.\n\nRiveted to his chair, he remained in despair until eventide. He had to\nearn his living, and dared not lose his place. At night the wrathful\ncountenance of Therese was a torture to him, and he was unable to find\nan opportunity to explain to her how it was he had broken his word. At\nlength, as Camille was putting up the shutters, he briskly approached\nthe young woman, to murmur in an undertone:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe shall be unable to see one another any more. My chief refuses to\ngive me permission to go out.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nCamille came into the shop, and Laurent was obliged to withdraw without\ngiving any further information, leaving Therese under the disagreeable\ninfluence of this abrupt and unpleasant announcement. Exasperated at\nanyone daring to interfere with her delectation, she passed a sleepless\nnight, arranging extravagant plans for a meeting with her sweetheart.\nThe following Thursday, she spoke with Laurent for a minute at the most.\nTheir anxiety was all the keener as they did not know where to meet\nfor the purpose of consulting and coming to an understanding. The young\nwoman, on this occasion, gave her sweetheart another appointment which\nfor the second time he failed to keep, and she then had but one fixed\nidea--to see him at any cost.\n\nFor a fortnight Laurent was unable to speak to Therese alone, and he\nthen felt how necessary this woman had become to his existence. Far\nfrom experiencing any uneasiness, as formerly, at the kisses which his\nladylove showered on him, he now sought her embraces with the obstinacy\nof a famished animal. A sanguineous passion had lurked in his muscles,\nand now that his sweetheart was taken from him, this passion burst out\nin blind violence. He was madly in love. This thriving brutish nature\nseemed unconscious in everything. He obeyed his instincts, permitting\nthe will of his organism to lead him.\n\nA year before, he would have burst into laughter, had he been told\nhe would become the slave of a woman, to the point of risking his\ntranquillity. The hidden forces of lust that had brought about this\nresult had been secretly proceeding within him, to end by casting him,\nbound hand and foot, into the arms of Therese. At this hour, he was in\ndread lest he should omit to be prudent. He no longer dared go of an\nevening to the shop in the Arcade of the Pont Neuf lest he should commit\nsome folly. He no longer belonged to himself. His ladylove, with her\nfeline suppleness, her nervous flexibility, had glided, little by\nlittle, into each fibre of his body. This woman was as necessary to his\nlife as eating and drinking.\n\nHe would certainly have committed some folly, had he not received a\nletter from Therese, asking him to remain at home the following evening.\nHis sweetheart promised him to call about eight o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock.\n\nOn quitting the office, he got rid of Camille by saying he was tired,\nand should go to bed at once. Therese, after dinner, also played her\npart. She mentioned a customer who had moved without paying her, and\nacting the indignant creditor who would listen to nothing, declared that\nshe intended calling on her debtor with the view of asking for payment\nof the money that was due. The customer now lived at Batignolles. Madame\nRaquin and Camille considered this a long way to go, and thought it\ndoubtful whether the journey would have a satisfactory result; but they\nexpressed no surprise, and allowed Therese to set out on her errand in\nall tranquillity.\n\nThe young woman ran to the Port aux Vins, gliding over the slippery\npavement, and knocking up against the passers-by, in her hurry to reach\nher destination. Beads of perspiration covered her face, and her hands\nwere burning. Anyone might have taken her for a drunken woman. She\nrapidly ascended the staircase of the hotel, and on reaching the sixth\nfloor, out of breath, and with wandering eyes, she perceived Laurent,\nwho was leaning over the banister awaiting her.\n\nShe entered the garret, which was so small that she could barely turn\nround in it, and tearing off her hat with one hand leant against the\nbedstead in a faint. Through the lift-up window in the roof, which was\nwide open, the freshness of the evening fell upon the burning couch.\n\nThe couple remained some time in this wretched little room, as though\nat the bottom of a hole. All at once, Therese heard a clock in the\nneighbourhood strike ten. She felt as if she would have liked to have\nbeen deaf. Nevertheless, she looked for her hat which she fastened to\nher hair with a long pin, and then seating herself, slowly murmured:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI must go.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nLaurent fell on his knees before her, and took her hands.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGood-bye, till we see each other again,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said she, without moving.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, not till we see each other again!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he exclaimed, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat is too\nindefinite. When will you come again?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe looked him full in the face.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDo you wish me to be frank with you?\u00e2\u0080\u009d she inquired. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, then, to\ntell you the truth, I think I shall come no more. I have no pretext, and\nI cannot invent one.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThen we must say farewell,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he remarked.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, I will not do that!\u00e2\u0080\u009d she answered.\n\nShe pronounced these words in terrified anger. Then she added more\ngently, without knowing what she was saying, and without moving from her\nchair:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI am going.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nLaurent reflected. He was thinking of Camille.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI wish him no harm,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he at length, without pronouncing the name:\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cbut really he is too much in our way. Couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you get rid of him, send\nhim on a journey somewhere, a long way off?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAh! yes, send him on a journey!\u00e2\u0080\u009d resumed the young woman, nodding her\nhead. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd do you imagine a man like that would consent to travel? There\nis only one journey, that from which you never return. But he will bury\nus all. People who are at their last breath, never die.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThen came a silence which was broken by Laurent who remarked:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI had a day dream. Camille met with an accident and died, and I became\nyour husband. Do you understand?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, yes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Therese, shuddering.\n\nThen, abruptly bending over the face of Laurent, she smothered it with\nkisses, and bursting into sobs, uttered these disjoined sentences amidst\nher tears:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t talk like that, for if you do, I shall lack the strength to leave\nyou. I shall remain here. Give me courage rather. Tell me we shall see\none another again. You have need of me, have you not? Well, one of these\ndays we shall find a way to live together.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThen come back, come back to-morrow,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Laurent.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut I cannot return,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she answered. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI have told you. I have no\npretext.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe wrung her hands and continued:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh! I do not fear the scandal. If you like, when I get back, I will\ntell Camille you are my sweetheart, and return here. I am trembling for\nyou. I do not wish to disturb your life. I want to make you happy.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe prudent instincts of the young man were awakened.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou are right,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe must not behave like children. Ah! if your\nhusband were to die!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIf my husband were to die,\u00e2\u0080\u009d slowly repeated Therese.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe would marry,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he continued, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand have nothing more to fear. What a\nnice, gentle life it would be!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe young woman stood up erect. Her cheeks were pale, and she looked at\nher sweetheart with a clouded brow, while her lips were twitching.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSometimes people die,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she murmured at last. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOnly it is dangerous for\nthose who survive.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nLaurent did not reply.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou see,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she continued, \u00e2\u0080\u009call the methods that are known are bad.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou misunderstood me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he quietly. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am not a fool, I wish to\nlove you in peace. I was thinking that accidents happen daily, that a\nfoot may slip, a tile may fall. You understand. In the latter event, the\nwind alone is guilty.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe spoke in a strange voice. Then he smiled, and added in a caressing\ntone:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNever mind, keep quiet. We will love one another fondly, and live\nhappily. As you are unable to come here, I will arrange matters. Should\nwe remain a few months without seeing one another, do not forget me, and\nbear in mind that I am labouring for your felicity.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAs Therese opened the door to leave, he seized her in his arms.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou are mine, are you not?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he continued. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou swear to belong to me,\nat any hour, when I choose.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes!\u00e2\u0080\u009d exclaimed the young woman. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am yours, do as you please with\nme.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nFor a moment they remained locked together and mute. Then Therese tore\nherself roughly away, and, without turning her head, quitted the garret\nand went downstairs. Laurent listened to the sound of her footsteps\nfading away.\n\nWhen he heard the last of them, he returned to his wretched room, and\nwent to bed. The sheets were still warm. Without closing the window,\nhe lay on his back, his arms bare, his hands open, exposed to the fresh\nair. And he reflected, with his eyes on the dark blue square that the\nwindow framed in the sky.\n\nHe turned the same idea over in his head until daybreak. Previous to the\nvisit of Therese, the idea of murdering Camille had not occurred to him.\nHe had spoken of the death of this man, urged to do so by the facts,\nirritated at the thought that he would be unable to meet his sweetheart\nany more. And it was thus that a new corner of his unconscious nature\ncame to be revealed.\n\nNow that he was more calm, alone in the middle of the peaceful night, he\nstudied the murder. The idea of death, blurted out in despair between a\ncouple of kisses, returned implacable and keen. Racked by insomnia, and\nunnerved by the visit of Therese, he calculated the disadvantages and\nthe advantages of his becoming an assassin.\n\nAll his interests urged him to commit the crime. He said to himself that\nas his father, the Jeufosse peasant, could not make up his mind to die,\nhe would perhaps have to remain a clerk another ten years, eating in\ncheap restaurants, and living in a garret. This idea exasperated him. On\nthe other hand, if Camille were dead, he would marry Therese, he would\ninherit from Madame Raquin, resign his clerkship, and saunter about in\nthe sun. Then, he took pleasure in dreaming of this life of idleness; he\nsaw himself with nothing to do, eating and sleeping, patiently awaiting\nthe death of his father. And when the reality arose in the middle of his\ndream, he ran up against Camille, and clenched his fists to knock him\ndown.\n\nLaurent desired Therese; he wanted her for himself alone, to have her\nalways within reach. If he failed to make the husband disappear, the\nwoman would escape him. She had said so: she could not return. He would\nhave eloped with her, carried her off somewhere, but then both would\ndie of hunger. He risked less in killing the husband. There would be\nno scandal. He would simply push a man away to take his place. In his\nbrutal logic of a peasant, he found this method excellent and natural.\nHis innate prudence even advised this rapid expedient.\n\nHe grovelled on his bed, in perspiration, flat on his stomach, with his\nface against the pillow, and he remained there breathless, stifling,\nseeing lines of fire pass along his closed eyelids. He asked himself how\nhe would kill Camille. Then, unable to breathe any more, he turned round\nat a bound to resume his position on his back, and with his eyes wide\nopen, received full in the face, the puffs of cold air from the window,\nseeking in the stars, in the bluish square of sky, a piece of advice\nabout murder, a plan of assassination.\n\nAnd he found nothing. As he had told his ladylove, he was neither a\nchild nor a fool. He wanted neither a dagger nor poison. What he sought\nwas a subtle crime, one that could be accomplished without danger; a\nsort of sinister suffocation, without cries and without terror, a simple\ndisappearance. Passion might well stir him, and urge him forward; all\nhis being imperiously insisted on prudence. He was too cowardly, too\nvoluptuous to risk his tranquillity. If he killed, it would be for a\ncalm and happy life.\n\nLittle by little slumber overcame him. Fatigued and appeased, he sank\ninto a sort of gentle and uncertain torpor. As he fell asleep, he\ndecided he would await a favourable opportunity, and his thoughts,\nfleeting further and further away, lulled him to rest with the murmur:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI will kill him, I will kill him.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nFive minutes later, he was at rest, breathing with serene regularity.\n\nTherese returned home at eleven o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock, with a burning head, and her\nthoughts strained, reaching the Arcade of the Pont Neuf unconscious\nof the road she had taken. It seemed to her that she had just come\ndownstairs from her visit to Laurent, so full were her ears of the words\nshe had recently heard. She found Madame Raquin and Camille anxious and\nattentive; but she answered their questions sharply, saying she had\nbeen on a fools\u00e2\u0080\u0099 errand, and had waited an hour on the pavement for an\nomnibus.\n\nWhen she got into bed, she found the sheets cold and damp. Her limbs,\nwhich were still burning, shuddered with repugnance. Camille soon\nfell asleep, and for a long time Therese watched his wan face reposing\nidiotically on the pillow, with his mouth wide open. Therese drew away\nfrom her husband. She felt a desire to drive her clenched fist into that\nmouth.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\nMore than three weeks passed. Laurent came to the shop every evening,\nlooking weary and unwell. A light bluish circle surrounded his eyes, and\nhis lips were becoming pale and chapped. Otherwise, he still maintained\nhis obtuse tranquillity, he looked Camille in the face, and showed him\nthe same frank friendship. Madame Raquin pampered the friend of the\nfamily the more, now that she saw him giving way to a sort of low fever.\n\nTherese had resumed her mute, glum countenance and manner. She was more\nmotionless, more impenetrable, more peaceful than ever. She did not seem\nto trouble herself in the least about Laurent. She barely looked at\nhim, rarely exchanged a word with him, treating him with perfect\nindifference. Madame Raquin, who in her goodness of heart, felt pained\nat this attitude, sometimes said to the young man:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDo not pay attention to the manner of my niece, I know her; her face\nappears cold, but her heart is warm with tenderness and devotedness.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe two sweethearts had no more meetings. Since the evening in the\nRue Saint-Victor they had not met alone. At night, when they found\nthemselves face to face, placid in appearance and like strangers to one\nanother, storms of passion and dismay passed beneath the calm flesh of\ntheir countenance. And while with Therese, there were outbursts of fury,\nbase ideas, and cruel jeers, with Laurent there were sombre brutalities,\nand poignant indecisions. Neither dared search to the bottom of their\nbeings, to the bottom of that cloudy fever that filled their brains with\na sort of thick and acrid vapour.\n\nWhen they could press the hands of one another behind a door, without\nspeaking, they did so, fit to crush them, in a short rough clasp. They\nwould have liked, mutually, to have carried off strips of their flesh\nclinging to their fingers. They had naught but this pressure of hands\nto appease their feelings. They put all their souls into them, and asked\nfor nothing more from one another. They waited.\n\nOne Thursday evening, before sitting down to the game of dominoes, the\nguests of the Raquin family had a chat, as usual. A favourite subject\nof conversation was afforded by the experiences of old Michaud who was\nplied with questions respecting the strange and sinister adventures\nwith which he must have been connected in the discharge of his former\nfunctions. Then Grivet and Camille listened to the stories of the\ncommissary with the affrighted and gaping countenances of small children\nlistening to \u00e2\u0080\u009cBlue Beard\u00e2\u0080\u009d or \u00e2\u0080\u009cTom Thumb.\u00e2\u0080\u009d These tales terrified and\namused them.\n\nOn this particular Thursday, Michaud, who had just given an account of\na horrible murder, the details of which had made his audience shudder,\nadded as he wagged his head:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd a great deal never comes out at all. How many crimes remain\nundiscovered! How many murderers escape the justice of man!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat!\u00e2\u0080\u009d exclaimed Grivet astonished, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou think there are foul creatures\nlike that walking about the streets, people who have murdered and are\nnot arrested?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nOlivier smiled with an air of disdain.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy dear sir,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he answered in his dictatorial tone, \u00e2\u0080\u009cif they are not\narrested it is because no one is aware that they have committed a\nmurder.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThis reasoning did not appear to convince Grivet, and Camille came to\nhis assistance.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI am of the opinion of M. Grivet,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, with silly importance. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\nshould like to believe that the police do their duty, and that I never\nbrush against a murderer on the pavement.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nOlivier considered this remark a personal attack.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCertainly the police do their duty,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he exclaimed in a vexed tone.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cStill we cannot do what is impossible. There are wretches who have\nstudied crime at Satan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own school; they would escape the Divinity\nHimself. Isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t that so, father?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, yes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d confirmed old Michaud. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThus, while I was at Vernon--you\nperhaps remember the incident, Madame Raquin--a wagoner was murdered\non the highway. The corpse was found cut in pieces, at the bottom of a\nditch. The authorities were never able to lay hands on the culprit. He\nis perhaps still living at this hour. Maybe he is our neighbour, and\nperhaps M. Grivet will meet him on his way home.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nGrivet turned pale as a sheet. He dared not look round. He fancied the\nmurderer of the wagoner was behind him. But for that matter, he was\ndelighted to feel afraid.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, no,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he faltered, hardly knowing what he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwell, no, I\ncannot believe that. But I also have a story: once upon a time a servant\nwas put in prison for stealing a silver spoon and fork belonging to\nher master and mistress. Two months afterwards, while a tree was being\nfelled, the knife and fork were discovered in the nest of a magpie. It\nwas the magpie who was the thief. The servant was released. You see that\nthe guilty are always punished.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nGrivet triumphed. Olivier sneered.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThen, they put the magpie in prison,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat is not what M. Grivet meant to say,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Camille, annoyed to\nsee his chief turned into ridicule. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMother, give us the dominoes.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWhile Madame Raquin went to fetch the box, the young man, addressing\nMichaud, continued:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThen you admit the police are powerless, that there are murderers\nwalking about in the sunshine?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cUnfortunately, yes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered the commissary.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is immoral,\u00e2\u0080\u009d concluded Grivet.\n\nDuring this conversation, Therese and Laurent had remained silent. They\nhad not even smiled at the folly of Grivet. Both leaning with their\narms on the table, looking slightly pale, and with a vague expression in\ntheir eyes, listened. At one moment those dark, ardent orbs had met. And\nsmall drops of perspiration pearled at the roots of the hair of Therese,\nwhile chilly puffs of breath gave imperceptible shivers to the skin of\nLaurent.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI\n\nSometimes on a Sunday, when the weather was fine, Camille forced Therese\nto go out with him, for a walk in the Champs Elysees. The young woman\nwould have preferred to remain in the damp obscurity of the arcade, for\nthe exercise fatigued her, and it worried her to be on the arm of her\nhusband, who dragged her along the pavement, stopping before the shop\nwindows, expressing his astonishment, making reflections, and then\nfalling into ridiculous spells of silence.\n\nBut Camille insisted on these Sunday outings, which gave him the\nsatisfaction of showing off his wife. When he met a colleague,\nparticularly one of his chiefs, he felt quite proud to exchange bows\nwith him, in the company of Madame. Besides, he walked for the sake\nof walking, and he did so almost in silence, stiff and deformed in his\nSunday clothes, dragging along his feet, and looking silly and vain. It\nmade Therese suffer to be seen arm in arm with such a man.\n\nOn these walking-out days, Madame Raquin accompanied her children to the\nend of the arcade, where she embraced them as if they were leaving on a\njourney, giving them endless advice, accompanied by fervent prayers.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cParticularly, beware of accidents,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she would say. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere are so many\nvehicles in the streets of Paris! Promise me not to get in a crowd.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAt last she allowed them to set out, but she followed them a\nconsiderable distance with her eyes, before returning to the shop. Her\nlower limbs were becoming unwieldy which prohibited her taking long\nwalks.\n\nOn other occasions, but more rarely, the married couple went out of\nParis, as far as Saint-Ouen or Asnieres, where they treated themselves\nto a dish of fried fish in one of the restaurants beside the river.\nThese were regarded as days of great revelry which were spoken of a\nmonth beforehand. Therese engaged more willingly, almost with joy, in\nthese excursions which kept her in the open air until ten or eleven\no\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock at night. Saint-Ouen, with its green isles, reminded her of\nVernon, and rekindled all the wild love she had felt for the Seine when\na little girl.\n\nShe seated herself on the gravel, dipped her hands in the water, feeling\nfull of life in the burning heat of the sun, attenuated by the fresh\npuffs of breeze in the shade. While she tore and soiled her frock on\nthe stones and clammy ground, Camille neatly spread out his\npocket-handkerchief and sank down beside her with endless precautions.\nLatterly the young couple almost invariably took Laurent with them. He\nenlivened the excursion by his laughter and strength of a peasant.\n\nOne Sunday, Camille, Therese and Laurent left for Saint-Ouen after\nbreakfast, at about eleven o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock. The outing had been projected a long\ntime, and was to be the last of the season. Autumn approached, and the\ncold breezes at night, began to make the air chilly.\n\nOn this particular morning, the sky maintained all its blue serenity.\nIt proved warm in the sun and tepid in the shade. The party decided that\nthey must take advantage of the last fine weather.\n\nHailing a passing cab they set out, accompanied by the pitiful\nexpressions of uneasiness, and the anxious effusions of the old mercer.\nCrossing Paris, they left the vehicle at the fortifications, and gained\nSaint-Ouen on foot. It was noon. The dusty road, brightly lit up by the\nsun, had the blinding whiteness of snow. The air was intensely warm,\nheavy and pungent. Therese, on the arm of Camille, walked with short\nsteps, concealing herself beneath her umbrella, while her husband fanned\nhis face with an immense handkerchief. Behind them came Laurent, who had\nthe sun streaming fiercely on the back of his neck, without appearing to\nnotice it. He whistled and kicked the stones before him as he strolled\nalong. Now and again there was a fierce glint in his eyes as he watched\nTherese\u00e2\u0080\u0099s swinging hips.\n\nOn reaching Saint-Ouen, they lost no time in looking for a cluster of\ntrees, a patch of green grass in the shade. Crossing the water to an\nisland, they plunged into a bit of underwood. The fallen leaves covered\nthe ground with a russety bed which cracked beneath their feet with\nsharp, quivering sounds. Innumerable trunks of trees rose up erect,\nlike clusters of small gothic columns; the branches descended to the\nforeheads of the three holiday makers, whose only view was the expiring\ncopper-like foliage, and the black and white stems of the aspens and\noaks. They were in the wilderness, in a melancholy corner, in a narrow\nclearing that was silent and fresh. All around them they heard the\nmurmur of the Seine.\n\nCamille having selected a dry spot, seated himself on the ground, after\nlifting up the skirt of his frock coat; while Therese, amid a loud\ncrumpling of petticoats, had just flung herself among the leaves.\nLaurent lay on his stomach with his chin resting on the ground.\n\nThey remained three hours in this clearing, waiting until it became\ncooler, to take a run in the country before dinner. Camille talked about\nhis office, and related silly stories; then, feeling fatigued, he let\nhimself fall backward and went to sleep with the rim of his hat over\nhis eyes. Therese had closed her eyelids some time previously, feigning\nslumber.\n\nLaurent, who felt wide awake, and was tired of his recumbent position,\ncrept up behind her and kissed her shoe and ankle. For a month his life\nhad been chaste and this walk in the sun had set him on fire. Here he\nwas, in a hidden retreat, and unable to hold to his breast the woman\nwho was really his. Her husband might wake up and all his prudent\ncalculations would be ruined by this obstacle of a man. So he lay, flat\non the ground, hidden by his lover\u00e2\u0080\u0099s skirts, trembling with exasperation\nas he pressed kiss after kiss upon the shoe and white stocking. Therese\nmade no movement. Laurent thought she was asleep.\n\nHe rose to his feet and stood with his back to a tree. Then he perceived\nthat the young woman was gazing into space with her great, sparkling\neyes wide open. Her face, lying between her arms, with her hands clasped\nabove her head, was deadly pale, and wore an expression of frigid\nrigidity. Therese was musing. Her fixed eyes resembled dark,\nunfathomable depths, where naught was visible save night. She did not\nmove, she did not cast a glance at Laurent, who stood erect behind her.\n\nHer sweetheart contemplated her, and was almost affrighted to see her\nso motionless and mute. He would have liked to have bent forward, and\nclosed those great open eyes with a kiss. But Camille lay asleep\nclose at hand. This poor creature, with his body twisted out of shape,\ndisplaying his lean proportions, was gently snoring. Under the hat,\nhalf concealing his face, could be seen his mouth contorted into a silly\ngrimace in his slumber. A few short reddish hairs on a bony chin sullied\nhis livid skin, and his head being thrown backward, his thin wrinkled\nneck appeared, with Adam\u00e2\u0080\u0099s apple standing out prominently in brick red\nin the centre, and rising at each snore. Camille, spread out on the\nground in this fashion, looked contemptible and vile.\n\nLaurent who looked at him, abruptly raised his heel. He was going to\ncrush his face at one blow.\n\nTherese restrained a cry. She went a shade paler than before, closed\nher eyes and turned her head away as if to avoid being bespattered with\nblood.\n\nLaurent, for a few seconds, remained with his heel in the air, above the\nface of the slumbering Camille. Then slowly, straightening his leg, he\nmoved a few paces away. He reflected that this would be a form of murder\nsuch as an idiot would choose. This pounded head would have set all the\npolice on him. If he wanted to get rid of Camille, it was solely for the\npurpose of marrying Therese. It was his intention to bask in the sun,\nafter the crime, like the murderer of the wagoner, in the story related\nby old Michaud.\n\nHe went as far as the edge of the water, and watched the running river\nin a stupid manner. Then, he abruptly turned into the underwood again.\nHe had just arranged a plan. He had thought of a mode of murder that\nwould be convenient, and without danger to himself.\n\nHe awoke the sleeper by tickling his nose with a straw. Camille sneezed,\ngot up, and pronounced the joke a capital one. He liked Laurent on\naccount of his tomfoolery, which made him laugh. He now roused his wife,\nwho kept her eyes closed. When she had risen to her feet, and shaken her\nskirt, which was all crumpled, and covered with dry leaves, the party\nquitted the clearing, breaking the small branches they found in their\nway.\n\nThey left the island, and walked along the roads, along the byways\ncrowded with groups in Sunday finery. Between the hedges ran girls\nin light frocks; a number of boating men passed by singing; files of\nmiddle-class couples, of elderly persons, of clerks and shopmen with\ntheir wives, walked the short steps, besides the ditches. Each roadway\nseemed like a populous, noisy street. The sun alone maintained its\ngreat tranquility. It was descending towards the horizon, casting on\nthe reddened trees and white thoroughfares immense sheets of pale light.\nPenetrating freshness began to fall from the quivering sky.\n\nCamille had ceased giving his arm to Therese. He was chatting with\nLaurent, laughing at the jests, at the feats of strength of his friend,\nwho leapt the ditches and raised huge stones above his head. The young\nwoman, on the other side of the road, advanced with her head bent\nforward, stooping down from time to time to gather an herb. When she had\nfallen behind, she stopped and observed her sweetheart and husband in\nthe distance.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHeh! Aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you hungry?\u00e2\u0080\u009d shouted Camille at her.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she replied.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThen, come on!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he.\n\nTherese was not hungry; but felt tired and uneasy. She was in ignorance\nas to the designs of Laurent, and her lower limbs were trembling with\nanxiety.\n\nThe three, returning to the riverside, found a restaurant, where they\nseated themselves at table on a sort of terrace formed of planks in an\nindifferent eating-house reeking with the odour of grease and wine. This\nplace resounded with cries, songs, and the clatter of plates and dishes.\nIn each private room and public saloon, were parties talking in loud\nvoices, and the thin partitions gave vibrating sonority to all this\nriot. The waiters, ascending to the upper rooms, caused the staircase to\nshake.\n\nAbove, on the terrace, the puffs of air from the river drove away the\nsmell of fat. Therese, leaning over the balustrade, observed the quay.\nTo right and left, extended two lines of wine-shops and shanties of\nshowmen. Beneath the arbours in the gardens of the former, amid the few\nremaining yellow leaves, one perceived the white tablecloths, the dabs\nof black formed by men\u00e2\u0080\u0099s coats, and the brilliant skirts of women.\nPeople passed to and fro, bareheaded, running, and laughing; and with\nthe bawling noise of the crowd was mingled the lamentable strains of\nthe barrel organs. An odour of dust and frying food hung in the calm\nair.\n\nBelow Therese, some tarts from the Latin Quarter were dancing in a ring\non a patch of worn turf singing an infantine roundelay. With hats fallen\non their shoulders, and hair unbound, they held one another by the\nhands, playing like little children. They still managed to find a small\nthread of fresh voice, and their pale countenances, ruffled by brutal\ncaresses, became tenderly coloured with virgin-like blushes, while their\ngreat impure eyes filled with moisture. A few students, smoking clean\nclay pipes, who were watching them as they turned round, greeted them\nwith ribald jests.\n\nAnd beyond, on the Seine, on the hillocks, descended the serenity\nof night, a sort of vague bluish mist, which bathed the trees in\ntransparent vapour.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHeh! Waiter!\u00e2\u0080\u009d shouted Laurent, leaning over the banister, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhat about\nthis dinner?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThen, changing his mind, he turned to Camille and said:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI say, Camille, let us go for a pull on the river before sitting down\nto table. It will give them time to roast the fowl. We shall be bored to\ndeath waiting an hour here.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAs you like,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Camille carelessly. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut Therese is hungry.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, no, I can wait,\u00e2\u0080\u009d hastened to say the young woman, at whom Laurent\nwas fixedly looking.\n\nAll three went downstairs again. Passing before the rostrum where the\nlady cashier was seated, they retained a table, and decided on a menu,\nsaying they would return in an hour. As the host let out pleasure boats,\nthey asked him to come and detach one. Laurent selected a skiff, which\nappeared so light that Camille was terrified by its fragility.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe deuce,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwe shall have to be careful not to move about in\nthis, otherwise we shall get a famous ducking.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe truth was that the clerk had a horrible dread of the water. At\nVernon, his sickly condition did not permit him, when a child, to go and\ndabble in the Seine. Whilst his schoolfellows ran and threw themselves\ninto the river, he lay abed between a couple of warm blankets. Laurent\nhad become an intrepid swimmer, and an indefatigable oarsman. Camille\nhad preserved that terror for deep water which is inherent in women and\nchildren. He tapped the end of the boat with his foot to make sure of\nits solidity.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCome, get in,\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried Laurent with a laugh, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou\u00e2\u0080\u0099re always trembling.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nCamille stepped over the side, and went staggering to seat himself at\nthe stern. When he felt the planks under him, he was at ease, and joked\nto show his courage.\n\nTherese had remained on the bank, standing grave and motionless beside\nher sweetheart, who held the rope. He bent down, and rapidly murmured in\nan undertone:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBe careful. I am going to pitch him in the river. Obey me. I answer for\neverything.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe young woman turned horribly pale. She remained as if riveted to the\nground. She was rigid, and her eyes had opened wider.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGet into the boat,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Laurent murmured again.\n\nShe did not move. A terrible struggle was passing within her. She\nstrained her will with all her might, to avoid bursting into sobs, and\nfalling to the ground.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAh! ah!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried Camille. \u00e2\u0080\u009cLaurent, just look at Therese. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s she who is\nafraid. She\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll get in; no, she won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get in.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe had now spread himself out on the back seat, his two arms on the\nsides of the boat, and was showing off with fanfaronade. The chuckles of\nthis poor man were like cuts from a whip to Therese, lashing and urging\nher on. She abruptly sprang into the boat, remaining in the bows.\nLaurent grasped the skulls. The skiff left the bank, advancing slowly\ntowards the isles.\n\nTwilight came. Huge shadows fell from the trees, and the water ran\nblack at the edges. In the middle of the river were great, pale, silver\ntrails. The boat was soon in full steam. There, all the sounds of the\nquays softened; the singing, and the cries came vague and melancholy,\nwith sad languidness. The odour of frying and dust had passed away. The\nair freshened. It turned cold.\n\nLaurent, resting on his skulls, allowed the boat to drift along in the\ncurrent.\n\nOpposite, rose the great reddish mass of trees on the islands. The two\nsombre brown banks, patched with grey, were like a couple of broad bands\nstretching towards the horizon. The water and sky seemed as if cut from\nthe same whitish piece of material. Nothing looks more painfully calm\nthan an autumn twilight. The sun rays pale in the quivering air, the old\ntrees cast their leaves. The country, scorched by the ardent beams of\nsummer, feels death coming with the first cold winds. And, in the sky,\nthere are plaintive sighs of despair. Night falls from above, bringing\nwinding sheets in its shade.\n\nThe party were silent. Seated at the bottom of the boat drifting with\nthe stream, they watched the final gleams of light quitting the tall\nbranches. They approached the islands. The great russety masses grew\nsombre; all the landscape became simplified in the twilight; the Seine,\nthe sky, the islands, the slopes were naught but brown and grey patches\nwhich faded away amidst milky fog.\n\nCamille, who had ended by lying down on his stomach, with his head over\nthe water, dipped his hands in the river.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe deuce! How cold it is!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he exclaimed. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt would not be pleasant to\ngo in there head foremost.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nLaurent did not answer. For an instant he had been observing the two\nbanks of the river with uneasiness. He advanced his huge hands to his\nknees, tightly compressing his lips. Therese, rigid and motionless, with\nher head thrown slightly backward, waited.\n\nThe skiff was about to enter a small arm of the river, that was sombre\nand narrow, penetrating between two islands. Behind one of these islands\ncould be distinguished the softened melody of a boating party who seemed\nto be ascending the Seine. Up the river in the distance, the water was\nfree.\n\nThen Laurent rose and grasped Camille round the body. The clerk burst\ninto laughter.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAh, no, you tickle me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cnone of those jokes. Look here, stop;\nyou\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll make me fall over.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nLaurent grasped him tighter, and gave a jerk. Camille turning round,\nperceived the terrifying face of his friend, violently agitated. He\nfailed to understand. He was seized with vague terror. He wanted to\nshout, and felt a rough hand seize him by the throat. With the instinct\nof an animal on the defensive, he rose to his knees, clutching the side\nof the boat, and struggled for a few seconds.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTherese! Therese!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he called in a stifling, sibilant voice.\n\nThe young woman looked at him, clinging with both hands to the seat. The\nskiff creaked and danced upon the river. She could not close her eyes,\na frightful contraction kept them wide open riveted on the hideous\nstruggle. She remained rigid and mute.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTherese! Therese!\u00e2\u0080\u009d again cried the unfortunate man who was in the\nthroes of death.\n\nAt this final appeal, Therese burst into sobs. Her nerves had given way.\nThe attack she had been dreading, cast her to the bottom of the boat,\nwhere she remained doubled up in a swoon, and as if dead.\n\nLaurent continued tugging at Camille, pressing with one hand on his\nthroat. With the other hand he ended by tearing his victim away from\nthe side of the skiff, and held him up in the air, in his powerful arms,\nlike a child. As he bent down his head, his victim, mad with rage and\nterror, twisted himself round, and reaching forward with his teeth,\nburied them in the neck of his aggressor. And when the murderer,\nrestraining a yell of pain, abruptly flung the clerk into the river, the\nlatter carried a piece of his flesh away with him.\n\nCamille fell into the water with a shriek. He returned to the surface\ntwo or three times, uttering cries that were more and more hollow.\n\nLaurent, without losing a second, raised the collar of his coat to hide\nhis wound. Then seizing the unconscious Therese in his arms, he capsized\nthe skiff with his foot, as he fell into the Seine with the young woman,\nwhom he supported on the surface, whilst calling in a lamentable voice\nfor help.\n\nThe boating party he had heard singing behind the point of the island,\nunderstanding that an accident had happened, advanced with long, rapid\nstrokes of the oars, and rescued the immerged couple. While Therese was\nlaid on a bench, Laurent gave vent to his despair at the death of his\nfriend. Plunging into the water again, he searched for Camille in places\nwhere he knew he was not to be found, and returned in tears, wringing\nhis hands, and tearing his hair, while the boating party did their best\nto calm and console him.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is all my fault,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he exclaimed. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI ought never to have allowed that\npoor fellow to dance and move about as he did. At a certain moment we\nall three found ourselves on one side of the boat, and we capsized. As\nwe fell into the water, he shouted out to me to save his wife.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nIn accordance with what usually happens under similar circumstances,\nthree or four young fellows among the boating party, maintained that\nthey had witnessed the accident.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe saw you well enough,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said they. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd, then, hang it all, a boat is\nnot so firm as a dancing floor. Ah! the poor little woman, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be a\nnice awakening for her.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThey took their oars, and towing the capsized skiff behind them,\nconducted Therese and Laurent to the restaurant, where the dinner was\nready to be served.\n\nThe restaurant keeper and his wife were worthy people who placed their\nwardrobe at the service of the drenched pair. When Therese recovered\nconsciousness, she had a nervous attack, and burst into heartrending\nsobs. It became necessary to put her to bed. Nature assisted the\nsinister comedy that had just been performed.\n\nAs soon as the young woman became calmer, Laurent entrusting her to\nthe care of the host and his wife, set out to return to Paris, where\nhe wished to arrive alone to break the frightful intelligence to Madame\nRaquin, with all possible precautions. The truth was that he feared the\nnervous feverish excitement of Therese, and preferred to give her time\nto reflect, and learn her part.\n\nIt was the boating men who sat down to the dinner prepared for Camille.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII\n\nLaurent, in the dark corner of the omnibus that took him back to Paris,\ncontinued perfecting his plan. He was almost certain of impunity, and\nhe felt heavy, anxious joy, the joy of having got over the crime. On\nreaching the gate at Clichy, he hailed a cab, and drove to the residence\nof old Michaud in the Rue de Seine. It was nine o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock at night when he\narrived.\n\nHe found the former commissary of police at table, in the company of\nOlivier and Suzanne. The motive of his visit was to seek protection, in\ncase he should be suspected, and also to escape breaking the frightful\nnews to Madame Raquin himself. Such an errand was strangely repugnant to\nhim. He anticipated encountering such terrible despair that he feared he\nwould be unable to play his part with sufficient tears. Then the grief\nof this mother weighed upon him, although at the bottom of his heart, he\ncared but little about it.\n\nWhen Michaud saw him enter, clothed in coarse-looking garments that were\ntoo tight for him, he questioned him with his eyes, and Laurent gave an\naccount of the accident in a broken voice, as if exhausted with grief\nand fatigue.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI have come to you,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he in conclusion, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbecause I do not know what\nto do about the two poor women so cruelly afflicted. I dare not go to\nthe bereaved mother alone, and want you to accompany me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAs he spoke, Olivier looked at him fixedly, and with so straight a\nglance that he terrified him. The murderer had flung himself head down\namong these people belonging to the police, with an audacity calculated\nto save him. But he could not repress a shudder as he felt their eyes\nexamining him. He saw distrust where there was naught but stupor and\npity.\n\nSuzanne weaker and paler than usual, seemed ready to faint. Olivier, who\nwas alarmed at the idea of death, but whose heart remained absolutely\ncold, made a grimace expressing painful surprise, while by habit\nhe scrutinised the countenance of Laurent, without having the least\nsuspicion of the sinister truth. As to old Michaud, he uttered\nexclamations of fright, commiseration, and astonishment; he fidgeted\non his chair, joined his hands together, and cast up his eyes to the\nceiling.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAh! good heavens,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he in a broken voice, \u00e2\u0080\u009cah! good heavens, what\na frightful thing! To leave one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s home, and die, like that, all of a\nsudden. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s horrible. And that poor Madame Raquin, his mother, whatever\nshall we say to her? Certainly, you were quite right to come and find\nus. We will go with you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nRising from his seat, he walked hither and thither about the apartment,\nstamping with his feet, in search of his hat and walking-stick; and, as\nhe bustled from corner to corner, he made Laurent repeat the details of\nthe catastrophe, giving utterance to fresh exclamations at the end of\neach sentence.\n\nAt last all four went downstairs. On reaching the entrance to the Arcade\nof the Pont Neuf, Laurent was stopped by Michaud.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDo not accompany us any further,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he; \u00e2\u0080\u009cyour presence would be a\nsort of brutal avowal which must be avoided. The wretched mother would\nsuspect a misfortune, and this would force us to confess the truth\nsooner than we ought to tell it to her. Wait for us here.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThis arrangement relieved the murderer, who shuddered at the thought\nof entering the shop in the arcade. He recovered his calm, and began\nwalking up and down the pavement, going and coming, in perfect peace of\nmind. At moments, he forgot the events that were passing. He looked at\nthe shops, whistled between his teeth, turned round to ogle the women\nwho brushed past him. He remained thus for a full half-hour in the\nstreet, recovering his composure more and more.\n\nHe had not eaten since the morning, and feeling hungry he entered a\npastrycook\u00e2\u0080\u0099s and stuffed himself with cakes.\n\nA heartrending scene was passing at the shop in the arcade.\nNotwithstanding precautions, notwithstanding the soft, friendly\nsentences of old Michaud, there came a moment when Madame Raquin\nunderstood that her son had met with misfortune. From that moment,\nshe insisted on knowing the truth with such a passionate outburst of\ndespair, with such a violent flow of tears and shrieks, that her old\nfriend could not avoid giving way to her.\n\nAnd when she learnt the truth, her grief was tragic. She gave hollow\nsobs, she received shocks that threw her backward, in a distracting\nattack of terror and anguish. She remained there choking, uttering\nfrom time to time a piercing scream amidst the profound roar of her\naffliction. She would have dragged herself along the ground, had not\nSuzanne taken her round the waist, weeping on her knees, and raising\nher pale countenance towards her. Olivier and his father on their feet,\nunnerved and mute, turned aside their heads, being disagreeably affected\nat this painful sight which wounded them in their egotism.\n\nThe poor mother saw her son rolling along in the thick waters of the\nSeine, a rigid and horribly swollen corpse; while at the same time, she\nperceived him a babe, in his cradle, when she drove away death bending\nover him. She had brought him back into the world on more than ten\noccasions; she loved him for all the love she had bestowed on him during\nthirty years. And now he had met his death far away from her, all at\nonce, in the cold and dirty water, like a dog.\n\nThen she remembered the warm blankets in which she had enveloped him.\nWhat care she had taken of her boy! What a tepid temperature he had been\nreared in! How she had coaxed and fondled him! And all this to see him\none day miserably drown himself! At these thoughts Madame Raquin felt a\ntightening at the throat, and she hoped she was going to die, strangled\nby despair.\n\nOld Michaud hastened to withdraw. Leaving Suzanne behind to look after\nthe mercer, he and Olivier went to find Laurent, so that they might\nhurry to Saint-Ouen with all speed.\n\nDuring the journey, they barely exchanged a few words. Each of them\nburied himself in a corner of the cab which jolted along over the\nstones. There they remained motionless and mute in the obscurity that\nprevailed within the vehicle. Ever and anon a rapid flash from a gas\nlamp, cast a bright gleam on their faces. The sinister event that had\nbrought them together, threw a sort of dismal dejection upon them.\n\nWhen they at length arrived at the restaurant beside the river, they\nfound Therese in bed with burning head and hands. The landlord told them\nin an undertone, that the young woman had a violent fever. The truth was\nthat Therese, feeling herself weak in character and wanting in courage,\nfeared she might confess the crime in one of her nervous attacks, and\nhad decided to feign illness.\n\nMaintaining sullen silence, she kept her lips and eyes closed, unwilling\nto see anyone lest she should speak. With the bedclothes to her chin,\nher face half concealed by the pillow, she made herself quite small,\nanxiously listening to all that was said around her. And, amidst the\nreddish gleam that passed beneath her closed lids, she could still see\nCamille and Laurent struggling at the side of the boat. She perceived\nher husband, livid, horrible, increased in height, rearing up straight\nabove the turbid water, and this implacable vision heightened the\nfeverish heat of her blood.\n\nOld Michaud endeavoured to speak to her and console her. But she made a\nmovement of impatience, and turning round, broke out into a fresh fit of\nsobbing.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLeave her alone, sir,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the restaurant keeper, \u00e2\u0080\u009cshe shudders at the\nslightest sound. You see, she wants rest.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBelow, in the general room, was a policeman drawing up a statement of\nthe accident. Michaud and his son went downstairs, followed by Laurent.\nWhen Olivier had made himself known as an upper official at the\nPrefecture of Police, everything was over in ten minutes. The boating\nmen, who were still there, gave an account of the drowning in its\nsmallest details, describing how the three holiday-makers had fallen\ninto the water, as if they themselves had witnessed the misfortune. Had\nOlivier and his father the least suspicion, it would have been dispelled\nat once by this testimony.\n\nBut they had not doubted the veracity of Laurent for an instant. On the\ncontrary, they introduced him to the policeman as the best friend of the\nvictim, and they were careful to see inserted in the report, that\nthe young man had plunged into the water to save Camille Raquin. The\nfollowing day, the newspapers related the accident with a great display\nof detail: the unfortunate mother, the inconsolable widow, the noble and\ncourageous friend, nothing was missing from this event of the day, which\nwent the round of the Parisian press, and then found an echo in the\nprovinces.\n\nWhen the report was completed, Laurent experienced lively joy, which\npenetrated his being like new life. From the moment his victim had\nburied his teeth in his neck, he had been as if stiffened, acting\nmechanically, according to a plan arranged long in advance. The instinct\nof self-preservation alone impelled him, dictating to him his words,\naffording him advice as to his gestures.\n\nAt this hour, in the face of the certainty of impunity, the blood\nresumed flowing in his veins with delicious gentleness. The police had\npassed beside his crime, and had seen nothing. They had been duped, for\nthey had just acquitted him. He was saved. This thought caused him to\nexperience a feeling of delightful moisture all along his body, a warmth\nthat restored flexibility to his limbs and to his intelligence. He\ncontinued to act his part of a weeping friend with incomparable science\nand assurance. At the bottom of his heart, he felt brutal satisfaction;\nand he thought of Therese who was in bed in the room above.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe cannot leave this unhappy woman here,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he to Michaud. \u00e2\u0080\u009cShe is\nperhaps threatened with grave illness. We must positively take her back\nto Paris. Come, let us persuade her to accompany us.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nUpstairs, he begged and prayed of Therese to rise and dress, and allow\nherself to be conducted to the Arcade of the Pont Neuf. When the young\nwoman heard the sound of his voice, she started, and stared at him with\neyes wide open. She seemed as if crazy, and was shuddering. Painfully\nshe raised herself into a sitting posture without answering. The men\nquitted the room, leaving her alone with the wife of the restaurant\nkeeper. When ready to start, she came downstairs staggering, and was\nassisted into the cab by Olivier.\n\nThe journey was a silent one. Laurent, with perfect audacity and\nimpudence, slipped his hand along the skirt of Therese and caught her\nfingers. He was seated opposite her, in a floating shadow, and could not\nsee her face which she kept bowed down on her breast. As soon as he\nhad grasped her hand, he pressed it vigorously, retaining it until\nthey reached the Rue Mazarine. He felt the hand tremble; but it was not\nwithdrawn. On the contrary it ever and anon gave a sudden caress.\n\nThese two hands, one in the other, were burning; the moist palms\nadhered, and the fingers tightly held together, were hurt at each\npressure. It seemed to Laurent and Therese that the blood from one\npenetrated the chest of the other, passing through their joined fists.\nThese fists became a live fire whereon their lives were boiling. Amidst\nthe night, amidst the heartrending silence that prevailed, the furious\ngrips they exchanged, were like a crushing weight cast on the head of\nCamille to keep him under water.\n\nWhen the cab stopped, Michaud and his son got out the first, and Laurent\nbending towards his sweetheart gently murmured:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBe strong, Therese. We have a long time to wait. Recollect.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThen the young woman opened her lips for the first time since the death\nof her husband.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh! I shall recollect,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said she with a shudder, and in a voice light\nas a puff of breath.\n\nOlivier extended his hand, inviting her to get down. On this occasion,\nLaurent went as far as the shop. Madame Raquin was abed, a prey to\nviolent delirium. Therese dragged herself to her room, where Suzanne\nhad barely time to undress her before she gave way. Tranquillised,\nperceiving that everything was proceeding as well as he could wish,\nLaurent withdrew, and slowly gained his wretched den in the rue\nSaint-Victor.\n\nIt was past midnight. Fresh air circulated in the deserted, silent\nstreets. The young man could hear naught but his own footsteps\nresounding on the pavement. The nocturnal coolness of the atmosphere\ncheered him up; the silence, the darkness gave him sharp sensations of\ndelight, and he loitered on his way.\n\nAt last he was rid of his crime. He had killed Camille. It was a matter\nthat was settled, and would be spoken of no more. He was now going to\nlead a tranquil existence, until he could take possession of Therese.\nThe thought of the murder had at times half choked him, but now that it\nwas accomplished, he felt a weight removed from his chest, and breathed\nat ease, cured of the suffering that hesitation and fear had given him.\n\nAt the bottom of his heart, he was a trifle hebetated. Fatigue had\nrendered his limbs and thoughts heavy. He went in to bed and slept\nsoundly. During his slumber slight nervous crispations coursed over his\nface.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII\n\nThe following morning, Laurent awoke fresh and fit. He had slept well.\nThe cold air entering by the open window, whipped his sluggish blood. He\nhad no clear recollection of the scenes of the previous day, and had it\nnot been for the burning sensation at his neck, he might have thought\nthat he had retired to rest after a calm evening.\n\nBut the bite Camille had given him stung as if his skin had been branded\nwith a red-hot iron. When his thoughts settled on the pain this gash\ncaused him, he suffered cruelly. It seemed as though a dozen needles\nwere penetrating little by little into his flesh.\n\nHe turned down the collar of his shirt, and examined the wound in a\nwretched fifteen sous looking-glass hanging against the wall. It formed\na red hole, as big as a penny piece. The skin had been torn away,\ndisplaying the rosy flesh, studded with dark specks. Streaks of blood\nhad run as far as the shoulder in thin threads that had dried up. The\nbite looked a deep, dull brown colour against the white skin, and was\nsituated under the right ear. Laurent scrutinised it with curved back\nand craned neck, and the greenish mirror gave his face an atrocious\ngrimace.\n\nSatisfied with his examination, he had a thorough good wash, saying to\nhimself that the wound would be healed in a few days. Then he dressed,\nand quietly repaired to his office, where he related the accident in an\naffected tone of voice. When his colleagues had read the account in the\nnewspapers, he became quite a hero. During a whole week the clerks at\nthe Orleans Railway had no other subject of conversation: they were all\nproud that one of their staff should have been drowned. Grivet never\nceased his remarks on the imprudence of adventuring into the middle\nof the Seine, when it was so easy to watch the running water from the\nbridges.\n\nLaurent retained a feeling of intense uneasiness. The decease of Camille\nhad not been formally proved. The husband of Therese was indeed dead,\nbut the murderer would have liked to have found his body, so as to\nobtain a certificate of death. The day following the accident, a\nfruitless search had been made for the corpse of the drowned man. It was\nthought that it had probably gone to the bottom of some hole near the\nbanks of the islands, and men were actively dragging the Seine to get\nthe reward.\n\nIn the meantime Laurent imposed on himself the task of passing each\nmorning by the Morgue, on the way to his office. He had made up his mind\nto attend to the business himself. Notwithstanding that his heart rose\nwith repugnance, notwithstanding the shudders that sometimes ran through\nhis frame, for over a week he went and examined the countenance of all\nthe drowned persons extended on the slabs.\n\nWhen he entered the place an unsavoury odour, an odour of freshly washed\nflesh, disgusted him and a chill ran over his skin: the dampness of the\nwalls seemed to add weight to his clothing, which hung more heavily on\nhis shoulders. He went straight to the glass separating the spectators\nfrom the corpses, and with his pale face against it, looked. Facing him\nappeared rows of grey slabs, and upon them, here and there, the naked\nbodies formed green and yellow, white and red patches. While some\nretained their natural condition in the rigidity of death, others seemed\nlike lumps of bleeding and decaying meat. At the back, against the wall,\nhung some lamentable rags, petticoats and trousers, puckered against the\nbare plaster. Laurent at first only caught sight of the wan ensemble of\nstones and walls, spotted with dabs of russet and black formed by\nthe clothes and corpses. A melodious sound of running water broke the\nsilence.\n\nLittle by little he distinguished the bodies, and went from one to the\nother. It was only the drowned that interested him. When several human\nforms were there, swollen and blued by the water, he looked at them\neagerly, seeking to recognise Camille. Frequently, the flesh on the\nfaces had gone away by strips, the bones had burst through the mellow\nskins, the visages were like lumps of boned, boiled beef. Laurent\nhesitated; he looked at the corpses, endeavouring to discover the lean\nbody of his victim. But all the drowned were stout. He saw enormous\nstomachs, puffy thighs, and strong round arms. He did not know what to\ndo. He stood there shuddering before those greenish-looking rags, which\nseemed like mocking him, with their horrible wrinkles.\n\nOne morning, he was seized with real terror. For some moments, he had\nbeen looking at a corpse, taken from the water, that was small in build\nand atrociously disfigured. The flesh of this drowned person was so soft\nand broken-up that the running water washing it, carried it away bit by\nbit. The jet falling on the face, bored a hole to the left of the nose.\nAnd, abruptly, the nose became flat, the lips were detached, showing the\nwhite teeth. The head of the drowned man burst out laughing.\n\nEach time Laurent fancied he recognised Camille, he felt a burning\nsensation in the heart. He ardently desired to find the body of his\nvictim, and he was seized with cowardice when he imagined it before him.\nHis visits to the Morgue filled him with nightmare, with shudders that\nset him panting for breath. But he shook off his fear, taxing himself\nwith being childish, when he wished to be strong. Still, in spite of\nhimself, his frame revolted, disgust and terror gained possession of his\nbeing, as soon as ever he found himself in the dampness, and unsavoury\nodour of the hall.\n\nWhen there were no drowned persons on the back row of slabs, he breathed\nat ease; his repugnance was not so great. He then became a simple\nspectator, who took strange pleasure in looking death by violence in the\nface, in its lugubriously fantastic and grotesque attitudes. This sight\namused him, particularly when there were women there displaying their\nbare bosoms. These nudities, brutally exposed, bloodstained, and in\nplaces bored with holes, attracted and detained him.\n\nOnce he saw a young woman of twenty there, a child of the people, broad\nand strong, who seemed asleep on the stone. Her fresh, plump, white form\ndisplayed the most delicate softness of tint. She was half smiling, with\nher head slightly inclined on one side. Around her neck she had a black\nband, which gave her a sort of necklet of shadow. She was a girl who had\nhanged herself in a fit of love madness.\n\nEach morning, while Laurent was there, he heard behind him the coming\nand going of the public who entered and left.\n\nThe morgue is a sight within reach of everybody, and one to which\npassers-by, rich and poor alike, treat themselves. The door stands open,\nand all are free to enter. There are admirers of the scene who go out of\ntheir way so as not to miss one of these performances of death. If the\nslabs have nothing on them, visitors leave the building disappointed,\nfeeling as if they had been cheated, and murmuring between their teeth;\nbut when they are fairly well occupied, people crowd in front of them\nand treat themselves to cheap emotions; they express horror, they joke,\nthey applaud or whistle, as at the theatre, and withdraw satisfied,\ndeclaring the Morgue a success on that particular day.\n\nLaurent soon got to know the public frequenting the place, that mixed\nand dissimilar public who pity and sneer in common. Workmen looked in\non their way to their work, with a loaf of bread and tools under their\narms. They considered death droll. Among them were comical companions\nof the workshops who elicited a smile from the onlookers by making witty\nremarks about the faces of each corpse. They styled those who had been\nburnt to death, coalmen; the hanged, the murdered, the drowned, the\nbodies that had been stabbed or crushed, excited their jeering vivacity,\nand their voices, which slightly trembled, stammered out comical\nsentences amid the shuddering silence of the hall.\n\nThere came persons of small independent means, old men who were thin and\nshrivelled-up, idlers who entered because they had nothing to do, and\nwho looked at the bodies in a silly manner with the pouts of peaceful,\ndelicate-minded men. Women were there in great numbers: young\nwork-girls, all rosy, with white linen, and clean petticoats, who\ntripped along briskly from one end of the glazed partition to the other,\nopening great attentive eyes, as if they were before the dressed shop\nwindow of a linendraper. There were also women of the lower orders\nlooking stupefied, and giving themselves lamentable airs; and\nwell-dressed ladies, carelessly dragging their silk gowns along the\nfloor.\n\nOn a certain occasion Laurent noticed one of the latter standing at a\nfew paces from the glass, and pressing her cambric handkerchief to her\nnostrils. She wore a delicious grey silk skirt with a large black lace\nmantle; her face was covered by a veil, and her gloved hands seemed\nquite small and delicate. Around her hung a gentle perfume of violet.\n\nShe stood scrutinising a corpse. On a slab a few paces away, was\nstretched the body of a great, big fellow, a mason who had recently\nkilled himself on the spot by falling from a scaffolding. He had a broad\nchest, large short muscles, and a white, well-nourished body; death had\nmade a marble statue of him. The lady examined him, turned him round\nand weighed him, so to say, with her eyes. For a time, she seemed quite\nabsorbed in the contemplation of this man. She raised a corner of her\nveil for one last look. Then she withdrew.\n\nAt moments, bands of lads arrived--young people between twelve and\nfifteen, who leant with their hands against the glass, nudging one\nanother with their elbows, and making brutal observations.\n\nAt the end of a week, Laurent became disheartened. At night he dreamt\nof the corpses he had seen in the morning. This suffering, this daily\ndisgust which he imposed on himself, ended by troubling him to such a\npoint, that he resolved to pay only two more visits to the place. The\nnext day, on entering the Morgue, he received a violent shock in the\nchest. Opposite him, on a slab, Camille lay looking at him, extended on\nhis back, his head raised, his eyes half open.\n\nThe murderer slowly approached the glass, as if attracted there,\nunable to detach his eyes from his victim. He did not suffer; he merely\nexperienced a great inner chill, accompanied by slight pricks on his\nskin. He would have thought that he would have trembled more violently.\nFor fully five minutes, he stood motionless, lost in unconscious\ncontemplation, engraving, in spite of himself, in his memory, all the\nhorrible lines, all the dirty colours of the picture he had before his\neyes.\n\nCamille was hideous. He had been a fortnight in the water. His face\nstill appeared firm and rigid; the features were preserved, but the skin\nhad taken a yellowish, muddy tint. The thin, bony, and slightly tumefied\nhead, wore a grimace. It was a trifle inclined on one side, with the\nhair sticking to the temples, and the lids raised, displaying the dull\nglobes of the eyes. The twisted lips were drawn to a corner of the mouth\nin an atrocious grin; and a piece of blackish tongue appeared\nbetween the white teeth. This head, which looked tanned and drawn out\nlengthwise, while preserving a human appearance, had remained all the\nmore frightful with pain and terror.\n\nThe body seemed a mass of ruptured flesh; it had suffered horribly.\nYou could feel that the arms no longer held to their sockets; and the\nclavicles were piercing the skin of the shoulders. The ribs formed black\nbands on the greenish chest; the left side, ripped open, was gaping\namidst dark red shreds. All the torso was in a state of putrefaction.\nThe extended legs, although firmer, were daubed with dirty patches. The\nfeet dangled down.\n\nLaurent gazed at Camille. He had never yet seen the body of a drowned\nperson presenting such a dreadful aspect. The corpse, moreover, looked\npinched. It had a thin, poor appearance. It had shrunk up in its decay,\nand the heap it formed was quite small. Anyone might have guessed\nthat it belonged to a clerk at 1,200 francs a year, who was stupid and\nsickly, and who had been brought up by his mother on infusions. This\nmiserable frame, which had grown to maturity between warm blankets, was\nnow shivering on a cold slab.\n\nWhen Laurent could at last tear himself from the poignant curiosity that\nkept him motionless and gaping before his victim, he went out and begun\nwalking rapidly along the quay. And as he stepped out, he repeated:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat is what I have done. He is hideous.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nA smell seemed to be following him, the smell that the putrefying body\nmust be giving off.\n\nHe went to find old Michaud, and told him he had just recognized Camille\nlying on one of the slabs in the Morgue. The formalities were performed,\nthe drowned man was buried, and a certificate of death delivered.\nLaurent, henceforth at ease, felt delighted to be able to bury his\ncrime in oblivion, along with the vexatious and painful scenes that had\nfollowed it.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV\n\nThe shop in the Arcade of the Pont Neuf remained closed for three days.\nWhen it opened again, it appeared darker and damper. The shop-front\ndisplay, which the dust had turned yellow, seemed to be wearing the\nmourning of the house; the various articles were scattered at sixes\nand sevens in the dirty windows. Behind the linen caps hanging from\nthe rusty iron rods, the face of Therese presented a more olive, a more\nsallow pallidness, and the immobility of sinister calm.\n\nAll the gossips in the arcade were moved to pity. The dealer in\nimitation jewelry pointed out the emaciated profile of the young widow\nto each of her customers, as an interesting and lamentable curiosity.\n\nFor three days, Madame Raquin and Therese had remained in bed without\nspeaking, and without even seeing one another. The old mercer, propped\nup by pillows in a sitting posture, gazed vaguely before her with the\neyes of an idiot. The death of her son had been like a blow on the head\nthat had felled her senseless to the ground. For hours she remained\ntranquil and inert, absorbed in her despair; then she was at times\nseized with attacks of weeping, shrieking and delirium.\n\nTherese in the adjoining room, seemed to sleep. She had turned her face\nto the wall, and drawn the sheet over her eyes. There she lay\nstretched out at full length, rigid and mute, without a sob raising the\nbed-clothes. It looked as if she was concealing the thoughts that made\nher rigid in the darkness of the alcove.\n\nSuzanne, who attended to the two women, went feebly from one to the\nother, gently dragging her feet along the floor, bending her wax-like\ncountenance over the two couches, without succeeding in persuading\nTherese, who had sudden fits of impatience, to turn round, or in\nconsoling Madame Raquin, whose tears began to flow as soon as a voice\ndrew her from her prostration.\n\nOn the third day, Therese, rapidly and with a sort of feverish decision,\nthrew the sheet from her, and seated herself up in bed. She thrust back\nher hair from her temples, and for a moment remained with her hands to\nher forehead and her eyes fixed, seeming still to reflect. Then, she\nsprang to the carpet. Her limbs were shivering, and red with fever;\nlarge livid patches marbled her skin, which had become wrinkled in\nplaces as if she had lost flesh. She had grown older.\n\nSuzanne, on entering the room, was struck with surprise to find her\nup. In a placid, drawling tone, she advised her to go to bed again, and\ncontinue resting. Therese paid no heed to her, but sought her clothes\nand put them on with hurried, trembling gestures. When she was dressed,\nshe went and looked at herself in a glass, rubbing her eyes, and passing\nher hands over her countenance, as if to efface something. Then, without\npronouncing a syllable, she quickly crossed the dining-room and entered\nthe apartment occupied by Madame Raquin.\n\nShe caught the old mercer in a moment of doltish calm. When Therese\nappeared, she turned her head following the movements of the young widow\nwith her eyes, while the latter came and stood before her, mute and\noppressed. The two women contemplated one another for some seconds, the\nniece with increasing anxiety, the aunt with painful efforts of memory.\nMadame Raquin, at last remembering, stretched out her trembling arms,\nand, taking Therese by the neck, exclaimed:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy poor child, my poor Camille!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe wept, and her tears dried on the burning skin of the young widow,\nwho concealed her own dry eyes in the folds of the sheet. Therese\nremained bending down, allowing the old mother to exhaust her outburst\nof grief. She had dreaded this first interview ever since the murder;\nand had kept in bed to delay it, to reflect at ease on the terrible part\nshe had to play.\n\nWhen she perceived Madame Raquin more calm, she busied herself about\nher, advising her to rise, and go down to the shop. The old mercer\nhad almost fallen into dotage. The abrupt apparition of her niece had\nbrought about a favourable crisis that had just restored her memory, and\nthe consciousness of things and beings around her. She thanked Suzanne\nfor her attention. Although weakened, she talked, and had ceased\nwandering, but she spoke in a voice so full of sadness that at moments\nshe was half choked. She watched the movements of Therese with sudden\nfits of tears; and would then call her to the bedside, and embrace her\namid more sobs, telling her in a suffocating tone that she, now, had\nnobody but her in the world.\n\nIn the evening, she consented to get up, and make an effort to eat.\nTherese then saw what a terrible shock her aunt had received. The legs\nof the old lady had become so ponderous that she required a stick to\nassist her to drag herself into the dining-room, and there she thought\nthe walls were vacillating around her.\n\nNevertheless, the following day she wished the shop to be opened. She\nfeared she would go mad if she continued to remain alone in her room.\nShe went down the wooden staircase with heavy tread, placing her two\nfeet on each step, and seated herself behind the counter. From that day\nforth, she remained riveted there in placid affliction.\n\nTherese, beside her, mused and waited. The shop resumed its gloomy calm.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV\n\nLaurent resumed calling of an evening, every two or three days,\nremaining in the shop talking to Madame Raquin for half an hour. Then\nhe went off without looking Therese in the face. The old mercer regarded\nhim as the rescuer of her niece, as a noble-hearted young man who had\ndone his utmost to restore her son to her, and she welcomed him with\ntender kindness.\n\nOne Thursday evening, when Laurent happened to be there, old Michaud\nand Grivet entered. Eight o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock was striking. The clerk and the former\ncommissary of police had both thought, independently of one another,\nthat they could resume their dear custom, without appearing importunate,\nand they arrived at the same moment, as if urged by the same impulse.\nBehind them, came Olivier and Suzanne.\n\nEveryone went upstairs to the dining-room. Madame Raquin who expected\nnobody, hastened to light the lamp, and prepare the tea. When all were\nseated round the table, each before a cup, when the box of dominoes\nhad been emptied on the board, the old mother, with the past suddenly\nbrought back to her, looked at her guests, and burst into sobs. There\nwas a vacant place, that of her son.\n\nThis despair cast a chill upon the company and annoyed them. Every\ncountenance wore an air of egotistic beatitude. These people felt ill\nat ease, having no longer the slightest recollection of Camille alive in\ntheir hearts.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCome, my dear lady,\u00e2\u0080\u009d exclaimed old Michaud, slightly impatiently, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou\nmust not give way to despair like that. You will make yourself ill.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe are all mortal,\u00e2\u0080\u009d affirmed Grivet.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYour tears will not restore your son to you,\u00e2\u0080\u009d sententiously observed\nOlivier.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDo not cause us pain, I beg you,\u00e2\u0080\u009d murmured Suzanne.\n\nAnd as Madame Raquin sobbed louder, unable to restrain her tears,\nMichaud resumed:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCome, come, have a little courage. You know we come here to give you\nsome distraction. Then do not let us feel sad. Let us try to forget. We\nare playing two sous a game. Eh! What do you say?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe mercer stifled her sobs with a violent effort. Perhaps she was\nconscious of the happy egotism of her guests. She dried her tears, but\nwas still quite upset. The dominoes trembled in her poor hands, and the\nmoisture in her eyes prevented her seeing.\n\nThe game began.\n\nLaurent and Therese had witnessed this brief scene in a grave and\nimpassive manner. The young man was delighted to see these Thursday\nevenings resumed. He ardently desired them to be continued, aware that\nhe would have need of these gatherings to attain his end. Besides,\nwithout asking himself the reason, he felt more at ease among these few\npersons whom he knew, and it gave him courage to look Therese in the\nface.\n\nThe young woman, attired in black, pale and meditative, seemed to him to\npossess a beauty that he had hitherto ignored. He was happy to meet\nher eyes, and to see them rest upon his own with courageous fixedness.\nTherese still belonged to him, heart and soul.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI\n\nA fortnight passed. The bitterness of the first hours was softening;\neach day brought additional tranquillity and calm; life resumed its\ncourse with weary languidness, and with the monotonous intellectual\ninsensibility which follows great shocks. At the commencement, Laurent\nand Therese allowed themselves to drift into this new existence which\nwas transforming them; within their beings was proceeding a silent\nlabour which would require analysing with extreme delicacy if one\ndesired to mark all its phases.\n\nIt was not long before Laurent came every night to the shop as formerly.\nBut he no longer dined there, he no longer made the place a lounge\nduring the entire evening. He arrived at half-past nine, and remained\nuntil he had put up the shutters. It seemed as if he was accomplishing a\nduty in placing himself at the service of the two women. If he happened\noccasionally to neglect the tiresome job, he apologised with the\nhumility of a valet the following day. On Thursdays he assisted Madame\nRaquin to light the fire, to do the honours of the house, and displayed\nall kinds of gentle attentions that charmed the old mercer.\n\nTherese peacefully watched the activity of his movements round about\nher. The pallidness of her face had departed. She appeared in better\nhealth, more smiling and gentle. It was only rarely that her lips,\nbecoming pinched in a nervous contraction, produced two deep pleats\nwhich conveyed to her countenance a strange expression of grief and\nfright.\n\nThe two sweethearts no longer sought to see one another in private. Not\nonce did they suggest a meeting, nor did they ever furtively exchange\na kiss. The murder seemed to have momentarily appeased their warmth. In\nkilling Camille, they had succeeded in satisfying their passion. Their\ncrime appeared to have given them a keen pleasure that sickened and\ndisgusted them of their embraces.\n\nThey had a thousand facilities for enjoying the freedom that had been\ntheir dream, and the attainment of which had urged them on to murder.\nMadame Raquin, impotent and childish, ceased to be an obstacle. The\nhouse belonged to them. They could go abroad where they pleased. But\nlove did not trouble them, its fire had died out. They remained there,\ncalmly talking, looking at one another without reddening and without\na thrill. They even avoided being alone. In their intimacy, they found\nnothing to say, and both were afraid that they appeared too cold.\nWhen they exchanged a pressure of the hand, they experienced a sort of\ndiscomfort at the touch of their skins.\n\nBoth imagined they could explain what made them so indifferent and\nalarmed when face to face with one another. They put the coldness of\ntheir attitude down to prudence. Their calm, according to them, was the\nresult of great caution on their part. They pretended they desired this\ntranquillity, and somnolence of their hearts. On the other hand, they\nregarded the repugnance, the uncomfortable feeling experienced as a\nremains of terror, as the secret dread of punishment. Sometimes, forcing\nthemselves to hope, they sought to resume the burning dreams of other\ndays, and were quite astonished to find they had no imagination.\n\nThen, they clung to the idea of their forthcoming marriage. They fancied\nthat having attained their end, without a single fear to trouble them,\ndelivered over to one another, their passion would burn again, and\nthey would taste the delights that had been their dream. This prospect\nbrought them calm, and prevented them descending to the void hollowed\nout beneath them. They persuaded themselves they loved one another as\nin the past, and they awaited the moment when they were to be perfectly\nhappy bound together for ever.\n\nNever had Therese possessed so placid a mind. She was certainly becoming\nbetter. All her implacable, natural will was giving way. She felt happy\nat night, alone in her bed; no longer did she find the thin face, and\npiteous form of Camille at her side to exasperate her. She imagined\nherself a little girl, a maid beneath the white curtains, lying\npeacefully amidst the silence and darkness. Her spacious, and slightly\ncold room rather pleased her, with its lofty ceiling, its obscure\ncorners, and its smack of the cloister.\n\nShe even ended by liking the great black wall which rose up before her\nwindow. Every night during one entire summer, she remained for hours\ngazing at the grey stones in this wall, and at the narrow strips of\nstarry sky cut out by the chimneys and roofs. She only thought of\nLaurent when awakened with a start by nightmare. Then, sitting up,\ntrembling, with dilated eyes, and pressing her nightdress to her, she\nsaid to herself that she would not experience these sudden fears, if she\nhad a man lying beside her. She thought of her sweetheart as of a dog\nwho would have guarded and protected her.\n\nOf a daytime, in the shop, she took an interest in what was going on\noutside; she went out at her own instigation, and no longer lived\nin sullen revolt, occupied with thoughts of hatred and vengeance. It\nworried her to sit musing. She felt the necessity of acting and seeing.\nFrom morning to night, she watched the people passing through the\narcade. The noise, and going and coming diverted her. She became\ninquisitive and talkative, in a word a woman, for hitherto she had only\ndisplayed the actions and ideas of a man.\n\nFrom her point of observation, she remarked a young man, a student, who\nlived at an hotel in the neighbourhood, and who passed several times\ndaily before the shop. This youth had a handsome, pale face, with the\nlong hair of a poet, and the moustache of an officer. Therese thought\nhim superior looking. She was in love with him for a week, in love like\na schoolgirl. She read novels, she compared the young man to Laurent,\nand found the latter very coarse and heavy. Her reading revealed to her\nromantic scenes that, hitherto, she had ignored. She had only loved with\nblood and nerves, as yet, and she now began to love with her head. Then,\none day, the student disappeared. No doubt he had moved. In a few hours\nTherese had forgotten him.\n\nShe now subscribed to a circulating library, and conceived a passion for\nthe heroes of all the stories that passed under her eyes. This sudden\nlove for reading had great influence on her temperament. She acquired\nnervous sensibility which caused her to laugh and cry without any\nmotive. The equilibrium which had shown a tendency to be established in\nher, was upset. She fell into a sort of vague meditation. At moments,\nshe became disturbed by thoughts of Camille, and she dreamt of Laurent\nand fresh love, full of terror and distrust. She again became a prey\nto anguish. At one moment she sought for the means of marrying her\nsweetheart at that very instant, at another she had an idea of running\naway never to see him again.\n\nThe novels, which spoke to her of chastity and honour, placed a sort\nof obstacle between her instincts and her will. She remained the\nungovernable creature who had wanted to struggle with the Seine and who\nhad thrown herself violently into illicit love; but she was conscious\nof goodness and gentleness, she understood the putty face and lifeless\nattitude of the wife of Olivier, and she knew it was possible to be\nhappy without killing one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s husband. Then, she did not see herself in a\nvery good light, and lived in cruel indecision.\n\nLaurent, on his side, passed through several different phases of love\nand fever. First of all he enjoyed profound tranquility; he seemed as\nif relieved of an enormous weight. At times he questioned himself with\nastonishment, fancying he had had a bad dream. He asked himself whether\nit was really true that he had flung Camille into the water, and had\nseen his corpse on the slab at the Morgue.\n\nThe recollection of his crime caused him strange surprise; never could\nhe have imagined himself capable of murder. He so prudent, so cowardly,\nshuddered at the mere thought; ice-like beads of perspiration stood\nout on his forehead when he reflected that the authorities might have\ndiscovered his crime and guillotined him. Then he felt the cold knife on\nhis neck. So long as he had acted, he had gone straight before him, with\nthe obstinacy and blindness of a brute. Now, he turned round, and at the\nsight of the gulf he had just cleared, grew faint with terror.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAssuredly, I must have been drunk,\u00e2\u0080\u009d thought he; \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat woman must have\nintoxicated me with caresses. Good heavens! I was a fool and mad! I\nrisked the guillotine in a business like that. Fortunately it passed off\nall right. But if it had to be done again, I would not do it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nLaurent lost all his vigor. He became inactive, and more cowardly and\nprudent than ever. He grew fat and flabby. No one who had studied this\ngreat body, piled up in a lump, apparently without bones or muscles,\nwould ever have had the idea of accusing the man of violence and\ncruelty.\n\nHe resumed his former habits. For several months, he proved himself a\nmodel clerk, doing his work with exemplary brutishness. At night, he\ntook his meal at a cheap restaurant in the Rue Saint-Victor, cutting his\nbread into thin slices, masticating his food slowly, making his repast\nlast as long as possible. When it was over, he threw himself back\nagainst the wall and smoked his pipe. Anyone might have taken him for\na stout, good-natured father. In the daytime, he thought of nothing; at\nnight, he reposed in heavy sleep free from dreams. With his face fat and\nrosy, his belly full, his brain empty, he felt happy.\n\nHis frame seemed dead, and Therese barely entered his mind. Occasionally\nhe thought of her as one thinks of a woman one has to marry later on, in\nthe indefinite future. He patiently awaited the time for his marriage,\nforgetful of the bride, and dreaming of the new position he would then\nenjoy. He would leave his office, he would paint for amusement, and\nsaunter about hither and thither. These hopes brought him night after\nnight, to the shop in the arcade, in spite of the vague discomfort he\nexperienced on entering the place.\n\nOne Sunday, with nothing to do and being bored, he went to see his\nold school friend, the young painter he had lived with for a time. The\nartist was working on a picture of a nude Bacchante sprawled on some\ndrapery. The model, lying with her head thrown back and her torso\ntwisted sometimes laughed and threw her bosom forward, stretching her\narms. As Laurent smoked his pipe and chatted with his friend, he kept\nhis eyes on the model. He took the woman home with him that evening and\nkept her as his mistress for many months. The poor girl fell in love\nwith him. Every morning she went off and posed as a model all day. Then\nshe came back each evening. She didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t cost Laurent a penny, keeping\nherself out of her own earnings. Laurent never bothered to find out\nabout her, where she went, what she did. She was a steadying influence\nin his life, a useful and necessary thing. He never wondered if he loved\nher and he never considered that he was being unfaithful to Therese. He\nsimply felt better and happier.\n\nIn the meanwhile the period of mourning that Therese had imposed on\nherself, had come to an end, and the young woman put on light-coloured\ngowns. One evening, Laurent found her looking younger and handsomer.\nBut he still felt uncomfortable in her presence. For some time past, she\nseemed to him feverish, and full of strange capriciousness, laughing and\nturning sad without reason. This unsettled demeanour alarmed him, for he\nguessed, in part, what her struggles and troubles must be like.\n\nHe began to hesitate, having an atrocious dread of risking his\ntranquillity. He was now living peacefully, in wise contentment, and he\nfeared to endanger the equilibrium of his life, by binding himself to\na nervous woman, whose passion had already driven him crazy. But he did\nnot reason these matters out, he felt by instinct all the anguish he\nwould be subjected to, if he made Therese his wife.\n\nThe first shock he received, and one that roused him in his\nsluggishness, was the thought that he must at length begin to think of\nhis marriage. It was almost fifteen months since the death of Camille.\nFor an instant, Laurent had the idea of not marrying at all, of jilting\nTherese. Then he said to himself that it was no good killing a man for\nnothing. In recalling the crime, and the terrible efforts he had made to\nbe the sole possessor of this woman who was now troubling him, he felt\nthat the murder would become useless and atrocious should he not marry\nher. Besides, was he not bound to Therese by a bond of blood and horror?\nMoreover, he feared his accomplice; perhaps, if he failed to marry her,\nshe would go and relate everything to the judicial authorities out of\nvengeance and jealousy. With these ideas beating in his head the fever\nsettled on him again.\n\nNow, one Sunday the model did not return; no doubt she had found a\nwarmer and more comfortable place to lodge. Laurent was only moderately\nupset, but he felt a sudden gap in his life without a woman lying beside\nhim at night. In a week his passions rebelled and he began spending\nentire evenings at the shop again. He watched Therese who was still\npalpitating from the novels which she read.\n\nAfter a year of indifferent waiting they both were again tormented by\ndesire. One evening while shutting up the shop, Laurent spoke to Therese\nin the passage.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDo you want me to come to your room to-night,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he asked passionately.\n\nShe started with fear. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s wait. Let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s be prudent.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt seems to me that I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve already waited a long time,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he went on. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m\nsick of waiting.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nTherese, her hands and face burning hot, looked at him wildly. She\nseemed to hesitate, and then said quickly:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLet\u00e2\u0080\u0099s get married.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII\n\nLaurent left the arcade with a strained mind. Therese had filled him\nwith the old longing lusts again. He walked along with his hat in his\nhand, so as to get the fresh air full in his face.\n\nOn reaching the door of his hotel in the Rue Saint-Victor, he was afraid\nto go upstairs, and remain alone. A childish, inexplicable, unforeseen\nterror made him fear he would find a man hidden in his garret. Never had\nhe experienced such poltroonery. He did not even seek to account for\nthe strange shudder that ran through him. He entered a wine-shop and\nremained an hour there, until midnight, motionless and silent at\na table, mechanically absorbing great glasses of wine. Thinking of\nTherese, his anger raged at her refusal to have him in her room that\nvery night. He felt that with her he would not have been afraid.\n\nWhen the time came for closing the shop, he was obliged to leave. But he\nwent back again to ask for matches. The office of the hotel was on\nthe first floor. Laurent had a long alley to follow and a few steps\nto ascend, before he could take his candle. This alley, this bit of\nstaircase which was frightfully dark, terrified him. Habitually, he\npassed boldly through the darkness. But on this particular night he\nhad not even the courage to ring. He said to himself that in a certain\nrecess, formed by the entrance to the cellar, assassins were perhaps\nconcealed, who would suddenly spring at his throat as he passed along.\n\nAt last he pulled the bell, and lighting a match, made up his mind to\nenter the alley. The match went out. He stood motionless, breathless,\nwithout the courage to run away, rubbing lucifers against the damp wall\nin such anxiety that his hand trembled. He fancied he heard voices,\nand the sound of footsteps before him. The matches broke between his\nfingers; but he succeeded in striking one. The sulphur began to boil, to\nset fire to the wood, with a tardiness that increased his distress. In\nthe pale bluish light of the sulphur, in the vacillating glimmer, he\nfancied he could distinguish monstrous forms. Then the match crackled,\nand the light became white and clear.\n\nLaurent, relieved, advanced with caution, careful not to be without a\nmatch. When he had passed the entrance to the cellar, he clung to the\nopposite wall where a mass of darkness terrified him. He next briskly\nscaled the few steps separating him from the office of the hotel, and\nthought himself safe when he held his candlestick. He ascended to the\nother floors more gently, holding aloft his candle, lighting all the\ncorners before which he had to pass. The great fantastic shadows that\ncome and go, in ascending a staircase with a light, caused him vague\ndiscomfort, as they suddenly rose and disappeared before him.\n\nAs soon as he was upstairs, and had rapidly opened his door and shut\nhimself in, his first care was to look under his bed, and make a minute\ninspection of the room to see that nobody was concealed there. He closed\nthe window in the roof thinking someone might perhaps get in that\nway, and feeling more calm after taking these measures, he undressed,\nastonished at his cowardice. He ended by laughing and calling himself a\nchild. Never had he been afraid, and he could not understand this sudden\nfit of terror.\n\nHe went to bed. When he was in the warmth beneath the bedclothes, he\nagain thought of Therese, whom fright had driven from his mind. Do what\nhe would, obstinately close his eyes, endeavour to sleep, he felt his\nthoughts at work commanding his attention, connecting one with the\nother, to ever point out to him the advantage he would reap by marrying\nas soon as possible. Ever and anon he would turn round, saying to\nhimself:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI must not think any more; I shall have to get up at eight o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock\nto-morrow morning to go to my office.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd he made an effort to slip off to sleep. But the ideas returned one\nby one. The dull labour of his reasoning began again; and he soon found\nhimself in a sort of acute reverie that displayed to him in the depths\nof his brain, the necessity for his marriage, along with the arguments\nhis desire and prudence advanced in turn, for and against the possession\nof Therese.\n\nThen, seeing he was unable to sleep, that insomnia kept his body in a\nstate of irritation, he turned on his back, and with his eyes wide open,\ngave up his mind to the young woman. His equilibrium was upset, he again\ntrembled with violent fever, as formerly. He had an idea of getting up,\nand returning to the Arcade of the Pont Neuf. He would have the iron\ngate opened, and Therese would receive him. The thought sent his blood\nracing.\n\nThe lucidity of his reverie was astonishing. He saw himself in the\nstreets walking rapidly beside the houses, and he said to himself:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI will take this Boulevard, I will cross this Square, so as to arrive\nthere quicker.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThen the iron gate of the arcade grated, he followed the narrow, dark,\ndeserted corridor, congratulating himself at being able to go up to\nTherese without being seen by the dealer in imitation jewelry. Next\nhe imagined he was in the alley, in the little staircase he had so\nfrequently ascended. He inhaled the sickly odour of the passage, he\ntouched the sticky walls, he saw the dirty shadow that hung about there.\nAnd he ascended each step, breathless, and with his ear on the alert. At\nlast he scratched against the door, the door opened, and Therese stood\nthere awaiting him.\n\nHis thoughts unfolded before him like real scenes. With his eyes fixed\non darkness, he saw. When at the end of his journey through the streets,\nafter entering the arcade, and climbing the little staircase, he thought\nhe perceived Therese, ardent and pale, he briskly sprang from his bed,\nmurmuring:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI must go there. She\u00e2\u0080\u0099s waiting for me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThis abrupt movement drove away the hallucination. He felt the chill of\nthe tile flooring, and was afraid. For a moment he stood motionless on\nhis bare feet, listening. He fancied he heard a sound on the landing.\nAnd he reflected that if he went to Therese, he would again have to pass\nbefore the door of the cellar below. This thought sent a cold shiver\ndown his back. Again he was seized with fright, a sort of stupid\ncrushing terror. He looked distrustfully round the room, where he\ndistinguished shreds of whitish light. Then gently, with anxious, hasty\nprecautions, he went to bed again, and there huddling himself together,\nhid himself, as if to escape a weapon, a knife that threatened him.\n\nThe blood had flown violently to his neck, which was burning him. He put\nhis hand there, and beneath his fingers felt the scar of the bite he\nhad received from Camille. He had almost forgotten this wound and was\nterrified when he found it on his skin, where it seemed to be gnawing\ninto his flesh. He rapidly withdrew his hand so as not to feel the scar,\nbut he was still conscious of its being there boring into and devouring\nhis neck. Then, when he delicately scratched it with his nail, the\nterrible burning sensation increased twofold. So as not to tear the\nskin, he pressed his two hands between his doubled-up knees, and he\nremained thus, rigid and irritated, with the gnawing pain in his neck,\nand his teeth chattering with fright.\n\nHis mind now settled on Camille with frightful tenacity. Hitherto the\ndrowned man had not troubled him at night. And behold the thought of\nTherese brought up the spectre of her husband. The murderer dared not\nopen his eyes, afraid of perceiving his victim in a corner of the room.\nAt one moment, he fancied his bedstead was being shaken in a peculiar\nmanner. He imagined Camille was beneath it, and that it was he who was\ntossing him about in this way so as to make him fall and bite him. With\nhaggard look and hair on end, he clung to his mattress, imagining the\njerks were becoming more and more violent.\n\nThen, he perceived the bed was not moving, and he felt a reaction. He\nsat up, lit his candle, and taxed himself with being an idiot. He next\nswallowed a large glassful of water to appease his fever.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI was wrong to drink at that wine-shop,\u00e2\u0080\u009d thought he. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know\nwhat is the matter with me to-night. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s silly. I shall be worn out\nto-morrow at my office. I ought to have gone to sleep at once, when I\ngot into bed, instead of thinking of a lot of things. That is what gave\nme insomnia. I must get to sleep at once.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAgain he blew out the light. He buried his head in the pillow, feeling\nslightly refreshed, and thoroughly determined not to think any more, and\nto be no more afraid. Fatigue began to relax his nerves.\n\nHe did not fall into his usual heavy, crushing sleep, but glided lightly\ninto unsettled slumber. He simply felt as if benumbed, as if plunged\ninto gentle and delightful stupor. As he dozed, he could feel his limbs.\nHis intelligence remained awake in his deadened frame. He had driven\naway his thoughts, he had resisted the vigil. Then, when he became\nappeased, when his strength failed and his will escaped him, his\nthoughts returned quietly, one by one, regaining possession of his\nfaltering being.\n\nHis reverie began once more. Again he went over the distance separating\nhim from Therese: he went downstairs, he passed before the cellar at a\nrun, and found himself outside the house; he took all the streets he had\nfollowed before, when he was dreaming with his eyes open; he entered the\nArcade of the Pont Neuf, ascended the little staircase and scratched at\nthe door. But instead of Therese, it was Camille who opened the door,\nCamille, just as he had seen him at the Morgue, looking greenish, and\natrociously disfigured. The corpse extended his arms to him, with a vile\nlaugh, displaying the tip of a blackish tongue between its white teeth.\n\nLaurent shrieked, and awoke with a start. He was bathed in perspiration.\nHe pulled the bedclothes over his eyes, swearing and getting into a rage\nwith himself. He wanted to go to sleep again. And he did so as before,\nslowly.\n\nThe same feeling of heaviness overcame him, and as soon as his will had\nagain escaped in the languidness of semi-slumber, he set out again. He\nreturned where his fixed idea conducted him; he ran to see Therese, and\nonce more it was the drowned man who opened the door.\n\nThe wretch sat up terrified. He would have given anything in the world\nto be able to drive away this implacable dream. He longed for heavy\nsleep to crush his thoughts. So long as he remained awake, he had\nsufficient energy to expel the phantom of his victim; but as soon as he\nlost command of his mind it led him to the acme of terror.\n\nHe again attempted to sleep. Then came a succession of delicious\nspells of drowsiness, and abrupt, harrowing awakenings. In his furious\nobstinacy, he still went to Therese, but only to always run against the\nbody of Camille. He performed the same journey more than ten times over.\nHe started all afire, followed the same itinerary, experienced the same\nsensations, accomplished the same acts, with minute exactitude; and\nmore than ten times over, he saw the drowned man present himself to be\nembraced, when he extended his arms to seize and clasp his love.\n\nThis same sinister catastrophe which awoke him on each occasion, gasping\nand distracted, did not discourage him. After an interval of a few\nminutes, as soon as he had fallen asleep again, forgetful of the hideous\ncorpse awaiting him, he once more hurried away to seek the young woman.\n\nLaurent passed an hour a prey to these successive nightmares, to these\nbad dreams that followed one another ceaselessly, without any warning,\nand he was struck with more acute terror at each start they gave him.\n\nThe last of these shocks proved so violent, so painful that he\ndetermined to get up, and struggle no longer. Day was breaking. A gleam\nof dull, grey light was entering at the window in the roof which cut out\na pale grey square in the sky.\n\nLaurent slowly dressed himself, with a feeling of sullen irritation,\nexasperated at having been unable to sleep, exasperated at allowing\nhimself to be caught by a fright which he now regarded as childish. As\nhe drew on his trousers he stretched himself, he rubbed his limbs,\nhe passed his hands over his face, harassed and clouded by a feverish\nnight. And he repeated:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI ought not to have thought of all that, I should have gone to sleep.\nHad I done so, I should be fresh and well-disposed now.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThen it occurred to him that if he had been with Therese, she would have\nprevented him being afraid, and this idea brought him a little calm. At\nthe bottom of his heart he dreaded passing other nights similar to the\none he had just gone through.\n\nAfter splashing some water in his face, he ran the comb through his\nhair, and this bit of toilet while refreshing his head, drove away the\nfinal vestiges of terror. He now reasoned freely, and experienced no\nother inconvenience from his restless night, than great fatigue in all\nhis limbs.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI am not a poltroon though,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said to himself as he finished\ndressing. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t care a fig about Camille. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s absurd to think that\nthis poor devil is under my bed. I shall, perhaps, have the same idea,\nnow, every night. I must certainly marry as soon as possible. When\nTherese has me in her arms, I shall not think much about Camille. She\nwill kiss me on the neck, and I shall cease to feel the atrocious burn\nthat troubles me at present. Let me examine this bite.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe approached his glass, extended his neck and looked. The scar\npresented a rosy appearance. Then, Laurent, perceiving the marks of the\nteeth of his victim, experienced a certain emotion. The blood flew\nto his head, and he now observed a strange phenomenon. The ruby flood\nrushing to the scar had turned it purple, it became raw and sanguineous,\nstanding out quite red against the fat, white neck. Laurent at the same\ntime felt a sharp pricking sensation, as if needles were being thrust\ninto the wound, and he hurriedly raised the collar of his shirt again.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBah!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he exclaimed, \u00e2\u0080\u009cTherese will cure that. A few kisses will suffice.\nWhat a fool I am to think of these matters!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe put on his hat, and went downstairs. He wanted to be in the open\nair and walk. Passing before the door of the cellar, he smiled.\nNevertheless, he made sure of the strength of the hook fastening the\ndoor. Outside, on the deserted pavement, he moved along with short steps\nin the fresh matutinal air. It was then about five o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock.\n\nLaurent passed an atrocious day. He had to struggle against the\noverpowering drowsiness that settled on him in the afternoon at his\noffice. His heavy, aching head nodded in spite of himself, but he\nabruptly brought it up, as soon as he heard the step of one of his\nchiefs. This struggle, these shocks completed wearing out his limbs,\nwhile causing him intolerable anxiety.\n\nIn the evening, notwithstanding his lassitude, he went to see Therese,\nonly to find her feverish, extremely low-spirited, and as weary as\nhimself.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOur poor Therese has had a bad night,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Madame Raquin said to him,\nas soon as he had seated himself. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt seems she was suffering from\nnightmare, and terrible insomnia. I heard her crying out on several\noccasions. This morning she was quite ill.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nTherese, while her aunt was speaking, looked fixedly at Laurent. No\ndoubt, they guessed their common terror, for a nervous shudder ran over\ntheir countenances. Until ten o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock they remained face to face with\none another, talking of commonplace matters, but still understanding\neach other, and mutually imploring themselves with their eyes, to hasten\nthe moment when they could unite against the drowned man.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII\n\nTherese also had been visited by the spectre of Camille, during this\nfeverish night.\n\nAfter over a year of indifference, Laurent\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sudden attentions had\naroused her senses. As she tossed herself about in insomnia, she had\nseen the drowned man rise up before her; like Laurent she had writhed\nin terror, and she had said as he had done, that she would no longer be\nafraid, that she would no more experience such sufferings, when she had\nher sweetheart in her arms.\n\nThis man and woman had experienced at the same hour, a sort of nervous\ndisorder which set them panting with terror. A consanguinity had become\nestablished between them. They shuddered with the same shudder; their\nhearts in a kind of poignant friendship, were wrung with the same\nanguish. From that moment they had one body and one soul for enjoyment\nand suffering.\n\nThis communion, this mutual penetration is a psychological and\nphysiological phenomenon which is often found to exist in beings who\nhave been brought into violent contact by great nervous shocks.\n\nFor over a year, Therese and Laurent lightly bore the chain riveted to\ntheir limbs that united them. In the depression succeeding the acute\ncrisis of the murder, amidst the feelings of disgust, and the need for\ncalm and oblivion that had followed, these two convicts might fancy they\nwere free, that they were no longer shackled together by iron fetters.\nThe slackened chain dragged on the ground. They reposed, they found\nthemselves struck with a sort of delightful insensibility, they sought\nto love elsewhere, to live in a state of wise equilibrium. But from\nthe day when urged forward by events, they came to the point of again\nexchanging burning sentences, the chain became violently strained, and\nthey received such a shock, that they felt themselves for ever linked to\none another.\n\nThe day following this first attack of nightmare, Therese secretly set\nto work to bring about her marriage with Laurent. It was a difficult\ntask, full of peril. The sweethearts trembled lest they should commit an\nimprudence, arouse suspicions, and too abruptly reveal the interest they\nhad in the death of Camille.\n\nConvinced that they could not mention marriage themselves, they arranged\na very clever plan which consisted in getting Madame Raquin herself, and\nthe Thursday evening guests, to offer them what they dared not ask for.\nIt then only became necessary to convey to these worthy people the idea\nof remarrying Therese, and particularly to make them believe that this\nidea originated with themselves, and was their own.\n\nThe comedy was long and delicate to perform. Therese and Laurent\ntook the parts adapted to them, and proceeded with extreme prudence,\ncalculating the slightest gesture, and the least word. At the bottom\nof their hearts, they were devoured by a feeling of impatience that\nstiffened and strained their nerves. They lived in a state of constant\nirritation, and it required all their natural cowardice to compel them\nto show a smiling and peaceful exterior.\n\nIf they yearned to bring the business to an end, it was because they\ncould no longer remain separate and solitary. Each night, the drowned\nman visited them, insomnia stretched them on beds of live coal and\nturned them over with fiery tongs. The state of enervation in which they\nlived, nightly increased the fever of their blood, which resulted in\natrocious hallucinations rising up before them.\n\nTherese no longer dared enter her room after dusk. She experienced the\nkeenest anguish, when she had to shut herself until morning in this\nlarge apartment, which became lit-up with strange glimmers, and peopled\nwith phantoms as soon as the light was out. She ended by leaving her\ncandle burning, and by preventing herself falling asleep, so as to\nalways have her eyes wide open. But when fatigue lowered her lids, she\nsaw Camille in the dark, and reopened her eyes with a start. In the\nmorning she dragged herself about, broken down, having only slumbered\nfor a few hours at dawn.\n\nAs to Laurent, he had decidedly become a poltroon since the night he\nhad taken fright when passing before the cellar door. Previous to that\nincident he had lived with the confidence of a brute; now, at the least\nsound, he trembled and turned pale like a little boy. A shudder of\nterror had suddenly shaken his limbs, and had clung to him. At night,\nhe suffered even more than Therese; and fright, in this great, soft,\ncowardly frame, produced profound laceration to the feelings. He watched\nthe fall of day with cruel apprehension. On several occasions, he failed\nto return home, and passed whole nights walking in the middle of the\ndeserted streets.\n\nOnce he remained beneath a bridge, until morning, while the rain poured\ndown in torrents; and there, huddled up, half frozen, not daring to rise\nand ascend to the quay, he for nearly six hours watched the dirty water\nrunning in the whitish shadow. At times a fit of terror brought him flat\ndown on the damp ground: under one of the arches of the bridge he seemed\nto see long lines of drowned bodies drifting along in the current. When\nweariness drove him home, he shut himself in, and double-locked the\ndoor. There he struggled until daybreak amidst frightful attacks of\nfever.\n\nThe same nightmare returned persistently: he fancied he fell from\nthe ardent clasp of Therese into the cold, sticky arms of Camille. He\ndreamt, first of all, that his sweetheart was stifling him in a warm\nembrace, and then that the corpse of the drowned man pressed him to his\nchest in an ice-like strain. These abrupt and alternate sensations of\nvoluptuousness and disgust, these successive contacts of burning love\nand frigid death, set him panting for breath, and caused him to shudder\nand gasp in anguish.\n\nEach day, the terror of the lovers increased, each day their attacks of\nnightmare crushed and maddened them the more. They no longer relied on\ntheir kisses to drive away insomnia. By prudence, they did not dare\nmake appointments, but looked forward to their wedding-day as a day of\nsalvation, to be followed by an untroubled night.\n\nIt was their desire for calm slumber that made them wish for their\nunion. They had hesitated during the hours of indifference, both being\noblivious of the egotistic and impassioned reasons that had urged them\nto the crime, and which were now dispelled. It was in vague despair that\nthey took the supreme resolution to unite openly. At the bottom of their\nhearts they were afraid. They had leant, so to say, one on the other\nabove an unfathomable depth, attracted to it by its horror. They\nbent over the abyss together, clinging silently to one another, while\nfeelings of intense giddiness enfeebled their limbs and gave them\nfalling madness.\n\nBut at the present moment, face to face with their anxious expectation\nand timorous desires, they felt the imperative necessity of closing\ntheir eyes, and of dreaming of a future full of amorous felicity and\npeaceful enjoyment. The more they trembled one before the other, the\nbetter they foresaw the horror of the abyss to the bottom of which\nthey were about to plunge, and the more they sought to make promises\nof happiness to themselves, and to spread out before their eyes the\ninvincible facts that fatally led them to marriage.\n\nTherese desired her union with Laurent solely because she was afraid\nand wanted a companion. She was a prey to nervous attacks that drove her\nhalf crazy. In reality she reasoned but little, she flung herself into\nlove with a mind upset by the novels she had recently been reading,\nand a frame irritated by the cruel insomnia that had kept her awake for\nseveral weeks.\n\nLaurent, who was of a stouter constitution, while giving way to his\nterror and his desire, had made up his mind to reason out his decision.\nTo thoroughly prove to himself that his marriage was necessary, that\nhe was at last going to be perfectly happy, and to drive away the vague\nfears that beset him, he resumed all his former calculations.\n\nHis father, the peasant of Jeufosse, seemed determined not to die, and\nLaurent said to himself that he might have to wait a long time for the\ninheritance. He even feared that this inheritance might escape him, and\ngo into the pockets of one of his cousins, a great big fellow who turned\nthe soil over to the keen satisfaction of the old boy. And he would\nremain poor; he would live the life of a bachelor in a garret, with a\nbad bed and a worse table. Besides, he did not contemplate working all\nhis life; already he began to find his office singularly tedious. The\nlight labour entrusted to him became irksome owing to his laziness.\n\nThe invariable result of these reflections was that supreme happiness\nconsisted in doing nothing. Then he remembered that if he had drowned\nCamille, it was to marry Therese, and work no more. Certainly, the\nthought of having his sweetheart all to himself had greatly influenced\nhim in committing the crime, but he had perhaps been led to it still\nmore, by the hope of taking the place of Camille, of being looked after\nin the same way, and of enjoying constant beatitude. Had passion alone\nurged him to the deed, he would not have shown such cowardice and\nprudence. The truth was that he had sought by murder to assure himself a\ncalm, indolent life, and the satisfaction of his cravings.\n\nAll these thoughts, avowedly or unconsciously, returned to him. To find\nencouragement, he repeated that it was time to gather in the harvest\nanticipated by the death of Camille, and he spread out before him the\nadvantages and blessings of his future existence: he would leave his\noffice, and live in delicious idleness; he would eat, drink and sleep to\nhis heart\u00e2\u0080\u0099s content; he would have an affectionate wife beside him; and,\nhe would shortly inherit the 40,000 francs and more of Madame Raquin,\nfor the poor old woman was dying, little by little, every day; in a\nword, he would carve out for himself the existence of a happy brute, and\nwould forget everything.\n\nLaurent mentally repeated these ideas at every moment, since his\nmarriage with Therese had been decided on. He also sought other\nadvantages that would result therefrom, and felt delighted when he found\na new argument, drawn from his egotism, in favour of his union with the\nwidow of the drowned man. But however much he forced himself to hope,\nhowever much he dreamed of a future full of idleness and pleasure, he\nnever ceased to feel abrupt shudders that gave his skin an icy chill,\nwhile at moments he continued to experience an anxiety that stifled his\njoy in his throat.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX\n\nIn the meanwhile, the secret work of Therese and Laurent was productive\nof results. The former had assumed a woeful and despairing demeanour\nwhich at the end of a few days alarmed Madame Raquin. When the old\nmercer inquired what made her niece so sad, the young woman played the\npart of an inconsolable widow with consummate skill. She spoke in a\nvague manner of feeling weary, depressed, of suffering from her nerves,\nwithout making any precise complaint. When pressed by her aunt with\nquestions, she replied that she was well, that she could not imagine\nwhat it was that made her so low-spirited, and that she shed tears\nwithout knowing why.\n\nThen, the constant choking fits of sobbing, the wan, heartrending\nsmiles, the spells of crushing silence full of emptiness and despair,\ncontinued.\n\nThe sight of this young woman who was always giving way to her grief,\nwho seemed to be slowly dying of some unknown complaint, ended by\nseriously alarming Madame Raquin. She had, now, no one in the whole\nworld but her niece, and she prayed the Almighty every night to preserve\nher this relative to close her eyes. A little egotism was mingled with\nthis final love of her old age. She felt herself affected in the slight\nconsolations that still assisted her to live, when it crossed her mind\nthat she might die alone in the damp shop in the arcade. From that time,\nshe never took her eyes off her niece, and it was with terror that she\nwatched her sadness, wondering what she could do to cure her of her\nsilent despair.\n\nUnder these grave circumstances, she thought she ought to take the\nadvice of her old friend Michaud. One Thursday evening, she detained him\nin the shop, and spoke to him of her alarm.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOf course,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered the old man, with that frank brutality he had\nacquired in the performance of his former functions, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI have noticed for\nsome time past that Therese has been looking sour, and I know very well\nwhy her face is quite yellow and overspread with grief.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou know why!\u00e2\u0080\u009d exclaimed the widow. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSpeak out at once. If we could\nonly cure her!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh! the treatment is simple,\u00e2\u0080\u009d resumed Michaud with a laugh. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYour niece\nfinds life irksome because she had been alone for nearly two years. She\nwants a husband; you can see that in her eyes.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe brutal frankness of the former commissary, gave Madame Raquin a\npainful shock. She fancied that the wound Therese had received through\nthe fatal accident at Saint-Ouen, was still as fresh, still as cruel\nat the bottom of her heart. It seemed to her that her son, once dead,\nTherese could have no thought for a husband, and here was Michaud\naffirming, with a hearty laugh, that Therese was out of sorts because\nshe wanted one.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMarry her as soon as you can,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, as he took himself off, \u00e2\u0080\u009cif you\ndo not wish to see her shrivel up entirely. That is my advice, my dear\nlady, and it is good, believe me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMadame Raquin could not, at first, accustom herself to the thought that\nher son was already forgotten. Old Michaud had not even pronounced\nthe name of Camille, and had made a joke of the pretended illness of\nTherese. The poor mother understood that she alone preserved at the\nbottom of her heart, the living recollection of her dear child, and she\nwept, for it seemed to her that Camille had just died a second time.\n\nThen, when she had had a good cry, and was weary of mourning, she\nthought, in spite of herself, of what Michaud had said, and became\nfamiliar with the idea of purchasing a little happiness at the cost of a\nmarriage which, according to her delicate mind, was like killing her son\nagain.\n\nFrequently, she gave way to feelings of cowardice when she came face to\nface with the dejected and broken-down Therese, amidst the icy silence\nof the shop. She was not one of those dry, rigid persons who find bitter\ndelight in living a life of eternal despair. Her character was full of\npliancy, devotedness, and effusion, which contributed to make up her\ntemperament of a stout and affable good lady, and prompted her to live\nin a state of active tenderness.\n\nSince her niece no longer spoke, and remained there pale and feeble, her\nown life became intolerable, while the shop seemed to her like a tomb.\nWhat she required was to find some warm affection beside her, some\nliveliness, some caresses, something sweet and gay which would help her\nto wait peacefully for death. It was these unconscious desires that made\nher accept the idea of marrying Therese again; she even forgot her son\na little. In the existence of the tomb that she was leading, came a sort\nof awakening, something like a will, and fresh occupation for the mind.\nShe sought a husband for her niece, and this search gave her matter for\nconsideration.\n\nThe choice of a husband was an important business. The poor old lady\nthought much more of her own comfort than of Therese. She wished\nto marry her niece in order to be happy herself, for she had keen\nmisgivings lest the new husband of the young woman should come and\ntrouble the last hours of her old age. The idea that she was about to\nintroduce a stranger into her daily existence terrified her. It was this\nthought alone that stopped her, that prevented her from talking openly\nwith her niece about matrimony.\n\nWhile Therese acted the comedy of weariness and dejection with that\nperfect hypocrisy she had acquired by her education, Laurent took the\npart of a sensible and serviceable man. He was full of little attentions\nfor the two women, particularly for Madame Raquin, whom he overwhelmed\nwith delicate attention. Little by little he made himself indispensable\nin the shop; it was him alone who brought a little gaiety into this\nblack hole. When he did not happen to be there of an evening, the old\nmercer searched round her, ill at ease, as if she missed something,\nbeing almost afraid to find herself face to face with the despairing\nTherese.\n\nBut Laurent only occasionally absented himself to better prove his\npower. He went to the shop daily, on quitting his office, and remained\nthere until the arcade was closed at night. He ran the errands, and\nhanded Madame Raquin, who could only walk with difficulty, the small\narticles she required. Then he seated himself and chatted. He had\nacquired the gentle penetrating voice of an actor which he employed to\nflatter the ears and heart of the good old lady. In a friendly way,\nhe seemed particularly anxious about the health of Therese, like a\ntender-hearted man who feels for the sufferings of others. On repeated\noccasions, he took Madame Raquin to one side, and terrified her by\nappearing very much alarmed himself at the changes and ravages he said\nhe perceived on the face of the young woman.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe shall soon lose her,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he murmured in a tearful voice. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe cannot\nconceal from ourselves that she is extremely ill. Ah! alas, for our poor\nhappiness, and our nice tranquil evenings!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMadame Raquin listened to him with anguish. Laurent even had the\naudacity to speak of Camille.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou see,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he to the mercer, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe death of my poor friend has been\na terrible blow to her. She had been dying for the last two years, since\nthat fatal day when she lost Camille. Nothing will console her, nothing\nwill cure her. We must be resigned.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThese impudent falsehoods made the old lady shed bitter tears. The\nmemory of her son troubled and blinded her. Each time the name of\nCamille was pronounced, she gave way, bursting into sobs. She would have\nembraced the person who mentioned her poor boy. Laurent had noticed\nthe trouble, and outburst of tender feeling that this name produced. He\ncould make her weep at will, upset her with such emotion that she failed\nto distinguish the clear aspect of things; and he took advantage of this\npower to always hold her pliant and in pain in his hand, as it were.\n\nEach evening in spite of the secret revolt of his trembling inner being,\nhe brought the conversation to bear on the rare qualities, on the tender\nheart and mind of Camille, praising his victim with most shameless\nimpudence. At moments, when he found the eyes of Therese fixed with a\nstrange expression on his own, he shuddered, and ended by believing\nall the good he had been saying about the drowned man. Then he held his\ntongue, suddenly seized with atrocious jealousy, fearing that the young\nwidow loved the man he had flung into the water, and whom he now lauded\nwith the conviction of an enthusiast.\n\nThroughout the conversation Madame Raquin was in tears, and unable to\ndistinguish anything around her. As she wept, she reflected that Laurent\nmust have a loving and generous heart. He alone remembered her son, he\nalone still spoke of him in a trembling and affected voice. She dried\nher eyes, gazing at the young man with infinite tenderness, and feeling\nthat she loved him as her own child.\n\nOne Thursday evening, Michaud and Grivet were already in the\ndining-room, when Laurent coming in, approached Therese, and with gentle\nanxiety inquired after her health. He seated himself for a moment beside\nher, performing for the edification of the persons present, his part\nof an alarmed and affectionate friend. As the young couple sat close\ntogether, exchanging a few words, Michaud, who was observing them,\nbent down, and said in a low voice to the old mercer, as he pointed to\nLaurent:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLook, there is the husband who will suit your niece. Arrange this\nmarriage quickly. We will assist you if it be necessary.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThis remark came as a revelation to Madame Raquin. She saw, at once, all\nthe advantages she would derive, personally, from the union of Therese\nand Laurent. The marriage would tighten the bonds already connecting her\nand her niece with the friend of her son, with that good-natured fellow\nwho came to amuse them in the evening.\n\nIn this manner, she would not be introducing a stranger into her home,\nshe would not run the risk of unhappiness. On the contrary, while giving\nTherese a support, she added another joy to her old age, she found a\nsecond son in this young man who for three years had shown her such\nfilial affection.\n\nThen it occurred to her that Therese would be less faithless to the\nmemory of Camille by marrying Laurent. The religion of the heart\nis peculiarly delicate. Madame Raquin, who would have wept to see a\nstranger embrace the young widow, felt no repulsion at the thought of\ngiving her to the comrade of her son.\n\nThroughout the evening, while the guests played at dominoes, the old\nmercer watched the couple so tenderly, that they guessed the comedy\nhad succeeded, and that the denouement was at hand. Michaud, before\nwithdrawing, had a short conversation in an undertone with Madame\nRaquin. Then, he pointedly took the arm of Laurent saying he would\naccompany him a bit of the way. As Laurent went off, he exchanged a\nrapid glance with Therese, a glance full of urgent enjoinment.\n\nMichaud had undertaken to feel the ground. He found the young man very\nmuch devoted to the two ladies, but exceedingly astonished at the idea\nof a marriage between Therese and himself. Laurent added, in an unsteady\ntone of voice, that he loved the widow of his poor friend as a sister,\nand that it would seem to him a perfect sacrilege to marry her. The\nformer commissary of police insisted, giving numerous good reasons with\na view to obtaining his consent. He even spoke of devotedness, and went\nso far as to tell the young man that it was clearly his duty to give a\nson to Madame Raquin and a husband to Therese.\n\nLittle by little Laurent allowed himself to be won over, feigning to\ngive way to emotion, to accept the idea of this marriage as one fallen\nfrom the clouds, dictated by feelings of devotedness and duty, as old\nMichaud had said. When the latter had obtained a formal answer in the\naffirmative, he parted with his companion, rubbing his hands, for he\nfancied he had just gained a great victory. He prided himself on having\nhad the first idea of this marriage which would convey to the Thursday\nevenings all their former gaiety.\n\nWhile Michaud was talking with Laurent, slowly following the quays,\nMadame Raquin had an almost identical conversation with Therese. At the\nmoment when her niece, pale and unsteady in gait, as usual, was about to\nretire to rest, the old mercer detained her an instant. She questioned\nher in a tender tone, imploring her to be frank, and confess the cause\nof the trouble that overwhelmed her. Then, as she only obtained vague\nreplies, she spoke of the emptiness of widowhood, and little by little\ncame to talk in a more precise manner of the offer of a second marriage,\nconcluding by asking Therese, plainly, whether she had not a secret\ndesire to marry again.\n\nTherese protested, saying that such a thought had never entered her\nmind, and that she intended remaining faithful to Camille. Madame\nRaquin began to weep. Pleading against her heart, she gave her niece to\nunderstand that despair should not be eternal; and, finally, in response\nto an exclamation of the young woman saying she would never replace\nCamille, Madame Raquin abruptly pronounced the name of Laurent. Then she\nenlarged with a flood of words on the propriety and advantages of such\nan union. She poured out her mind, repeating aloud all she had been\nthinking during the evening, depicting with naive egotism, the picture\nof her final days of happiness, between her two dear children. Therese,\nresigned and docile, listened to her with bowed head, ready to give\nsatisfaction to her slightest wish.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI love Laurent as a brother,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said she grievously, when her aunt had\nceased speaking. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut, as you desire it, I will endeavour to love him\nas a husband. I wish to make you happy. I had hoped that you would\nhave allowed me to weep in peace, but I will dry my tears, as it is a\nquestion of your happiness.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe kissed the old lady, who remained surprised and frightened at having\nbeen the first to forget her son. As Madame Raquin went to bed, she\nsobbed bitterly, accusing herself of having less strength than Therese,\nand of desiring, out of egotism, a marriage that the young widow\naccepted by simple abnegation.\n\nThe following morning, Michaud and his old friend had a short\nconversation in the arcade, before the door of the shop, where they\ncommunicated to one another the result of their efforts, and agreed to\nhurry matters on by forcing the young people to become affianced the\nsame evening.\n\nAt five o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock, Michaud was already in the shop when Laurent entered.\nAs soon as the young man had seated himself, the former commissary of\npolice said in his ear:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cShe accepts.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThis blunt remark was overheard by Therese who remained pale, with her\neyes impudently fixed on Laurent. The two sweethearts looked at each\nother for a few seconds as if consulting. Both understood that they must\naccept the position without hesitation, and finish the business at one\nstroke. Laurent, rising, went and took the hand of Madame Raquin, who\nmade every effort to restrain her tears.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDear mother,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he smiling, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI was talking about your felicity, last\nnight, with M. Michaud. Your children wish to make you happy.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe poor old lady, on hearing herself called \u00e2\u0080\u009cdear mother,\u00e2\u0080\u009d allowed her\ntears to flow. She quietly seized the hand of Therese and placed it in\nthat of Laurent, unable to utter a single word.\n\nThe two sweethearts shivered on feeling their skins touch, and remained\nwith their burning fingers pressed together, in a nervous clasp. After a\npause, the young man, in a hesitating tone, resumed:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTherese, shall we give your aunt a bright and peaceful existence?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d feebly replied the young woman, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwe have a duty to perform.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThen Laurent, becoming very pale, turned towards Madame Raquin, and\nadded:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen Camille fell into the water, he shouted out to me: \u00e2\u0080\u0098Save my wife,\nI entrust her to you.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 I believe I am acting in accordance with his last\nwish in marrying Therese.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nTherese, on hearing these words, let go the hand of Laurent. She\nhad received a shock like a blow in the chest. The impudence of her\nsweetheart overwhelmed her. She observed him with a senseless look,\nwhile Madame Raquin, half stifled by sobs, stammered:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, yes, my friend, marry her, make her happy; my son, from the depth\nof his tomb, will thank you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nLaurent, feeling himself giving way, leant on the back of a chair, while\nMichaud, who was himself moved to tears, pushed him towards Therese with\nthe remark:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cKiss one another. It will be your betrothal.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWhen the lips of the young man came in contact with the cheeks of the\nwidow, he experienced a peculiarly uncomfortable feeling, while the\nlatter abruptly drew back, as if the two kisses of her sweetheart burnt\nher. This was the first caress he had given her in the presence of\nwitnesses. All her blood rushed to her face, and she felt herself red\nand burning.\n\nAfter this crisis, the two murderers breathed. Their marriage was\ndecided on. At last they approached the goal they had so long had in\nview. Everything was settled the same evening. The Thursday following,\nthe marriage was announced to Grivet, as well as to Olivier and his\nwife. Michaud, in communicating the news to them, did not conceal his\ndelight. He rubbed his hands, repeating as he did so:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt was I who thought of it. It is I who have married them. You will see\nwhat a nice couple they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll make!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nSuzanne silently embraced Therese. This poor creature, who was half\ndead, and as white as a sheet, had formed a friendship for the rigid and\nsombre young widow. She showed her a sort of childlike affection mingled\nwith a kind of respectful terror. Olivier complimented the aunt and\nniece, while Grivet hazarded a few spicy jokes that met with middling\nsuccess. Altogether the company were delighted, enchanted, and declared\nthat everything was for the best; in reality all they thought about was\nthe wedding feast.\n\nTherese and Laurent were clever enough to maintain a suitable demeanour,\nby simply displaying tender and obliging friendship to one another. They\ngave themselves an air of accomplishing an act of supreme devotedness.\nNothing in their faces betrayed a suspicion of the terror and desire\nthat disturbed them. Madame Raquin watched the couple with faint smiles,\nand a look of feeble, but grateful goodwill.\n\nA few formalities required fulfilling. Laurent had to write to his\nfather to ask his consent to the marriage. The old peasant of Jeufosse\nwho had almost forgotten that he had a son at Paris, answered him, in\nfour lines, that he could marry, and go and get hanged if he chose. He\ngave him to understand that being resolved never to give him a sou,\nhe left him master of his body, and authorised him to be guilty of all\nimaginable follies. A permission accorded in such terms, caused Laurent\nsingular anxiety.\n\nMadame Raquin, after reading the letter of this unnatural father, in a\ntransport of kind-heartedness, acted very foolishly. She made over to\nher niece the 40,000 francs and more, that she possessed, stripping\nherself entirely for the young couple, on whose affection she relied,\nwith the desire of being indebted to them for all her happiness.\n\nLaurent brought nothing into the community, and he even gave it to\nbe understood that he did not always intend to remain in his present\nemployment, but would perhaps take up painting again. In any case, the\nfuture of the little family was assured; the interest on the money put\naside added to the profit on the mercery business, would be sufficient\nto keep three persons comfortably. As a matter of fact it was only just\nsufficient to make them happy.\n\nThe preparations for the marriage were hurried on, the formalities being\nabridged as much as possible, and at last the welcome day arrived.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX\n\nIn the morning, Laurent and Therese, awoke in their respective rooms,\nwith the same feeling of profound joy in their hearts: both said to\nthemselves that their last night of terror had passed. They would no\nlonger have to sleep alone, and they would mutually defend themselves\nagainst the drowned man.\n\nTherese looked around her, giving a strange smile as she measured her\ngreat bed with her eyes. She rose and began to slowly dress herself, in\nanticipation of the arrival of Suzanne, who was to come and assist her\nwith her bridal toilet.\n\nLaurent, on awakening, sat up in bed, and remained in that position for\na few minutes, bidding farewell to his garret, which struck him as vile.\nAt last he was to quit this kennel and have a wife. It was in the month\nof December and he shivered. He sprang on the tile floor, saying to\nhimself that he would be warm at night.\n\nA week previously, Madame Raquin, knowing how short he was of money, had\nslipped a purse into his hand containing 500 francs, which represented\nall her savings. The young man had accepted this present without\ndifficulty, and had rigged himself out from tip to toe. Moreover, the\nmoney of the old mercer permitted him to make Therese the customary\npresents.\n\nThe black trousers, dress coat, white waistcoat, shirt and cambric tie,\nhung spread out on a couple of chairs. Laurent washed, perfumed himself\nwith a bottle of eau de Cologne, and then proceeded to carefully attire\nhimself. He wished to look handsome. As he fastened his collar, a collar\nwhich was high and stiff, he experienced keen pain in the neck. The\nbutton escaped from his fingers. He lost patience. The starched linen\nseemed to cut into his flesh. Wishing to see what was the matter, he\nraised his chin, and perceived the bite Camille had given him looking\nquite red. The collar had slightly galled the scar.\n\nLaurent pressed his lips together, and turned pale; the sight of this\nmark seaming his neck, frightened and irritated him at this moment. He\ncrumpled up the collar, and selected another which he put on with every\nprecaution, and then finished dressing himself. As he went downstairs\nhis new clothes made him look rigid. With his neck imprisoned in the\ninflexible linen, he dared not turn his head. At every movement he made,\na pleat pinched the wound that the teeth of the drowned man had made in\nhis flesh, and it was under the irritation of these sharp pricks, that\nhe got into the carriage, and went to fetch Therese to conduct her to\nthe town-hall and church.\n\nOn the way, he picked up a clerk employed at the Orleans Railway\nCompany, and old Michaud, who were to act as witnesses. When they\nreached the shop, everyone was ready: Grivet and Olivier, the witnesses\nof Therese, were there, along with Suzanne, who looked at the bride as\nlittle girls look at dolls they have just dressed up. Although Madame\nRaquin was no longer able to walk, she desired to accompany the couple\neverywhere, so she was hoisted into a conveyance and the party set out.\n\nEverything passed off in a satisfactory manner at the town-hall and\nchurch. The calm and modest attitude of the bride and bridegroom was\nremarked and approved. They pronounced the sacramental \u00e2\u0080\u009cyes\u00e2\u0080\u009d with an\nemotion that moved Grivet himself. They were as if in a dream. Whether\nseated, or quietly kneeling side by side, they were rent by raging\nthoughts that flashed through their minds in spite of themselves, and\nthey avoided looking at one another. When they seated themselves in\ntheir carriage, they seemed to be greater strangers than before.\n\nIt had been decided that the wedding feast should be a family affair\nat a little restaurant on the heights of Belleville. The Michauds and\nGrivet alone were invited. Until six in the evening, the wedding party\ndrove along the boulevards, and then repaired to the cheap eating-house\nwhere a table was spread with seven covers in a small private room\npainted yellow, and reeking of dust and wine.\n\nThe repast was not accompanied by much gaiety. The newly married pair\nwere grave and thoughtful. Since the morning, they had been experiencing\nstrange sensations, which they did not seek to fathom. From the\ncommencement, they had felt bewildered at the rapidity with which\nthe formalities and ceremony were performed, that had just bound them\ntogether for ever.\n\nThen, the long drive on the boulevards had soothed them and made them\ndrowsy. It appeared to them that this drive lasted months. Nevertheless,\nthey allowed themselves to be taken through the monotonous streets\nwithout displaying impatience, looking at the shops and people with\nsparkless eyes, overcome by a numbness that made them feel stupid, and\nwhich they endeavoured to shake off by bursting into fits of laughter.\nWhen they entered the restaurant, they were weighed down by oppressive\nfatigue, while increasing stupor continued to settle on them.\n\nPlaced at table opposite one another, they smiled with an air of\nconstraint, and then fell into the same heavy reverie as before, eating,\nanswering questions, moving their limbs like machines. Amidst the idle\nlassitude of their minds, the same string of flying thoughts returned\nceaselessly. They were married, and yet unconscious of their new\ncondition, which caused them profound astonishment. They imagined an\nabyss still separated them, and at moments asked themselves how they\ncould get over this unfathomable depth. They fancied they were living\nprevious to the murder, when a material obstacle stood between them.\n\nThen they abruptly remembered they would occupy the same apartment that\nnight, in a few hours, and they gazed at one another in astonishment,\nunable to comprehend why they should be permitted to do so. They did not\nfeel they were united, but, on the contrary, were dreaming that they had\njust been violently separated, and one cast far from the other.\n\nThe silly chuckling of the guests beside them, who wished to hear them\ntalk familiarly, so as to dispel all restraint, made them stammer and\ncolour. They could never make up their minds to treat one another as\nsweethearts in the presence of company.\n\nWaiting had extinguished the flame that had formerly fired them. All\nthe past had disappeared. They had forgotten their violent passion,\nthey forgot even their joy of the morning, that profound joy they had\nexperienced at the thought that they would no more be afraid. They were\nsimply wearied and bewildered at all that was taking place. The\nevents of the day turned round and round in their heads, appearing\nincomprehensible and monstrous. They sat there mute and smiling,\nexpecting nothing, hoping for nothing. Mingled with their dejection of\nspirits, was a restless anxiety that proved vaguely painful.\n\nAt every movement Laurent made with his neck, he felt a sharp burn\ndevouring his flesh; his collar cut and pinched the bite of Camille.\nWhile the mayor read out to him the law bearing on marriage, while the\npriest spoke to him of the Almighty, at every minute of this long day,\nhe had felt the teeth of the drowned man entering his skin. At times,\nhe imagined a streak of blood was running down his chest, and would\nbespatter his white waistcoat with crimson.\n\nMadame Raquin was inwardly grateful to the newly married couple for\ntheir gravity. Noisy joy would have wounded the poor mother. In her\nmind, her son was there, invisible, handing Therese over to Laurent.\n\nGrivet had other ideas. He considered the wedding party sad, and wanted\nto enliven it, notwithstanding the looks of Michaud and Olivier which\nriveted him to his chair each time he wished to get up and say something\nsilly. Nevertheless, he managed to rise once and propose a toast.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI drink to the offspring of monsieur and madame,\u00e2\u0080\u009d quoth he in a\nsprightly tone.\n\nIt was necessary to touch glasses. Therese and Laurent had turned\nextremely pale on hearing this sentence. They had never dreamed that\nthey might have children. The thought flashed through them like an icy\nshiver. They nervously joined glasses with the others, examining one\nanother, surprised and alarmed to find themselves there, face to face.\n\nThe party rose from table early. The guests wished to accompany the\nnewly married pair to the nuptial chamber. It was barely half-past\nnine when they all returned to the shop in the arcade. The dealer in\nimitation jewelry was still there in her cupboard, before the box lined\nwith blue velvet. She raised her head inquisitively, gazing at the\nyoung husband and wife with a smile. The latter caught her eyes, and was\nterrified. It struck her that perhaps this old woman was aware of their\nformer meetings, by having noticed Laurent slipping into the little\ncorridor.\n\nWhen they all arrived on the upper floor, Therese withdrew almost\nimmediately, with Madame Raquin and Suzanne, the men remaining in\nthe dining-room, while the bride performed her toilet for the night.\nLaurent, nerveless and depressed, did not experience the least\nimpatience, but listened complacently to the coarse jokes of old Michaud\nand Grivet, who indulged themselves to their hearts\u00e2\u0080\u0099 content, now\nthat the ladies were no longer present. When Suzanne and Madame Raquin\nquitted the nuptial apartment, and the old mercer in an unsteady voice\ntold the young man that his wife awaited him, he started. For an instant\nhe remained bewildered. Then he feverishly grasped the hands extended\nto him, and entered the room, clinging to the door like a man under the\ninfluence of drink.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI\n\nLaurent carefully closed the door behind him, and for a moment or two\nstood leaning against it, gazing round the apartment in anxiety and\nembarrassment.\n\nA clear fire burned on the hearth, sending large sheets of light dancing\non ceiling and walls. The room was thus lit-up by bright vacillating\ngleams, that in a measure annulled the effects of the lamp placed on\na table in their midst. Madame Raquin had done her best to convey\na coquettish aspect to the apartment. It was one mass of white, and\nperfumed throughout, as if to serve as a nest for young, fresh love. The\ngood lady, moreover, had taken pleasure in adding a few bits of lace to\nthe bed, and in filling the vases on the chimney-piece with bunches of\nroses. Gentle warmth and pleasant fragrance reigned over all, and not a\nsound broke the silence, save the crackling and little sharp reports of\nthe wood aglow on the hearth.\n\nTherese was seated on a low chair to the right of the chimney, staring\nfixedly at the bright flames, with her chin in her hand. She did not\nturn her head when Laurent entered. Clothed in a petticoat and linen\nnight-jacket bordered with lace, she looked snowy white in the bright\nlight of the fire. Her jacket had become disarranged, and part of her\nrosy shoulder appeared, half hidden by a tress of raven hair.\n\nLaurent advanced a few paces without speaking, and took off his coat\nand waistcoat. When he stood in his shirt sleeves, he again looked at\nTherese, who had not moved, and he seemed to hesitate. Then, perceiving\nthe bit of shoulder, he bent down quivering, to press his lips to it.\nThe young woman, abruptly turning round, withdrew her shoulder, and in\ndoing so, fixed on Laurent such a strange look of repugnance and horror,\nthat he shrank back, troubled and ill at ease, as if himself seized with\nterror and disgust.\n\nLaurent then seated himself opposite Therese, on the other side of the\nchimney, and they remained thus, silent and motionless, for fully five\nminutes. At times, tongues of reddish flame escaped from the wood, and\nthen the faces of the murderers were touched with fleeting gleams of\nblood.\n\nIt was more than a couple of years since the two sweethearts had\nfound themselves shut up alone in this room. They had arranged\nno love-meetings since the day when Therese had gone to the Rue\nSaint-Victor to convey to Laurent the idea of murder. Prudence had kept\nthem apart. Barely had they, at long intervals, ventured on a pressure\nof the hand, or a stealthy kiss. After the murder of Camille, they had\nrestrained their passion, awaiting the nuptial night. This had at last\narrived, and now they remained anxiously face to face, overcome with\nsudden discomfort.\n\nThey had but to stretch forth their arms to clasp one another in a\npassionate embrace, and their arms remained lifeless, as if worn out\nwith fatigue. The depression they had experienced during the daytime,\nnow oppressed them more and more. They observed one another with timid\nembarrassment, pained to remain so silent and cold. Their burning dreams\nended in a peculiar reality: it sufficed that they should have succeeded\nin killing Camille, and have become married, it sufficed that the lips\nof Laurent should have grazed the shoulder of Therese, for their lust to\nbe satisfied to the point of disgust and horror.\n\nIn despair, they sought to find within them a little of that passion\nwhich formerly had devoured them. Their frames seemed deprived of\nmuscles and nerves, and their embarrassment and anxiety increased. They\nfelt ashamed of remaining so silent and gloomy face to face with one\nanother. They would have liked to have had the strength to squeeze each\nother to death, so as not to pass as idiots in their own eyes.\n\nWhat! they belonged one to the other, they had killed a man, and played\nan atrocious comedy in order to be able to love in peace, and they sat\nthere, one on either side of a mantelshelf, rigid, exhausted, their\nminds disturbed and their frames lifeless! Such a denouement appeared\nto them horribly and cruelly ridiculous. It was then that Laurent\nendeavoured to speak of love, to conjure up the remembrances of other\ndays, appealing to his imagination for a revival of his tenderness.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTherese,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cdon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you recall our afternoons in this room? Then\nI came in by that door, but today I came in by this one. We are free\nnow. We can make love in peace.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe spoke in a hesitating, spiritless manner, and the young woman,\nhuddled up on her low chair, continued gazing dreamily at the flame\nwithout listening. Laurent went on:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cRemember how I used to dream of staying a whole night with you? I\ndreamed of waking up in the morning to your kisses, now it can come\ntrue.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nTherese all at once started as though surprised to hear a voice\nstammering in her ears. Turning towards Laurent, on whose countenance\nthe fire, at this moment, cast a broad reddish reflection, she gazed at\nhis sanguinary face, and shuddered.\n\nThe young man, more troubled and anxious, resumed:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe have succeeded, Therese; we have broken through all obstacles, and\nwe belong to one another. The future is ours, is it not? A future of\ntranquil happiness, of satisfied love. Camille is no longer here----\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nLaurent ceased speaking. His throat had suddenly become dry, and he was\nchoking, unable to continue. On hearing the name of Camille, Therese\nreceived a violent shock. The two murderers contemplated one another,\nstupefied, pale, and trembling. The yellow gleams of light from the\nfire continued to dance on ceiling and walls, the soft odour of roses\nlingered in the air, the crackling of the wood broke the silence with\nshort, sharp reports.\n\nRemembrances were abandoned. The spectre of Camille which had been\nevoked, came and seated itself between the newly married pair, in front\nof the flaming fire. Therese and Laurent recognised the cold, damp smell\nof the drowned man in the warm air they were breathing. They said to\nthemselves that a corpse was there, close to them, and they examined\none another without daring to move. Then all the terrible story of their\ncrime was unfolded in their memory. The name of their victim sufficed\nto fill them with thoughts of the past, to compel them to go through all\nthe anguish of the murder over again. They did not open their lips, but\nlooked at one another, and both at the same time were troubled with the\nsame nightmare, both with their eyes broached the same cruel tale.\n\nThis exchange of terrified looks, this mute narration they were about\nto make to themselves of the murder, caused them keen and intolerable\napprehension. The strain on their nerves threatened an attack, they\nmight cry out, perhaps fight. Laurent, to drive away his recollections,\nviolently tore himself from the ecstasy of horror that enthralled him in\nthe gaze of Therese. He took a few strides in the room; he removed his\nboots and put on slippers; then, returning to his former place, he\nsat down at the chimney corner, and tried to talk on matters of\nindifference.\n\nTherese, understanding what he desired, strove to answer his questions.\nThey chatted about the weather, endeavouring to force on a commonplace\nconversation. Laurent said the room was warm, and Therese replied that,\nnevertheless, a draught came from under the small door on the staircase,\nand both turned in that direction with a sudden shudder. The young man\nhastened to speak about the roses, the fire, about everything he saw\nbefore him. The young woman, with an effort, rejoined in monosyllables,\nso as not to allow the conversation to drop. They had drawn back from\none another, and were giving themselves easy airs, endeavouring to\nforget whom they were, treating one another as strangers brought\ntogether by chance.\n\nBut, in spite of themselves, by a strange phenomenon, whilst they\nuttered these empty phrases, they mutually guessed the thoughts\nconcealed in their banal words. Do what they would, they both thought\nof Camille. Their eyes continued the story of the past. They still\nmaintained by looks a mute discourse, apart from the conversation they\nheld aloud, which ran haphazard. The words they cast here and there\nhad no signification, being disconnected and contradictory; all their\nintelligence was bent on the silent exchange of their terrifying\nrecollections.\n\nWhen Laurent spoke of the roses, or of the fire, of one thing or\nanother, Therese was perfectly well aware that he was reminding her\nof the struggle in the skiff, of the dull fall of Camille; and, when\nTherese answered yes or no to an insignificant question, Laurent\nunderstood that she said she remembered or did not remember a detail of\nthe crime. They charted it in this manner open-heartedly without needing\nwords, while they spoke aloud of other matters.\n\nMoreover, unconscious of the syllables they pronounced, they followed\ntheir secret thoughts sentence by sentence; they might abruptly have\ncontinued their confidences aloud, without ceasing to understand each\nother. This sort of divination, this obstinacy of their memory in\npresenting to themselves without pause, the image of Camille, little\nby little drove them crazy. They thoroughly well perceived that they\nguessed the thoughts of one another, and that if they did not hold their\ntongues, the words would rise of themselves to their mouths, to name the\ndrowned man, and describe the murder. Then they closely pinched their\nlips and ceased their conversation.\n\nIn the overwhelming silence that ensued, the two murderers continued\nto converse about their victim. It appeared to them that their eyes\nmutually penetrated their flesh, and buried clear, keen phrases in their\nbodies. At moments, they fancied they heard themselves speaking aloud.\nTheir senses changed. Sight became a sort of strange and delicate\nhearing. They so distinctly read their thoughts upon their countenances,\nthat these thoughts took a peculiarly piercing sound that agitated all\ntheir organism. They could not have understood one another better, had\nthey shouted in a heartrending voice:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe have killed Camille, and his corpse is there, extended between us,\nmaking our limbs like ice.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd the terrible confidence continued, more manifest, more resounding,\nin the calm moist air of the room.\n\nLaurent and Therese had commenced the mute narration from the day of\ntheir first interview in the shop. Then the recollections had come one\nby one in order; they had related their hours of love, their moments of\nhesitation and anger, the terrible incident of the murder. It was then\nthat they pinched their lips, ceasing to talk of one thing and another,\nin fear lest they should all at once name Camille without desiring to do\nso.\n\nBut their thoughts failing to cease, had then led them into great\ndistress, into the affrighted period of expectancy following the crime.\nThey thus came to think of the corpse of the drowned man extended on a\nslab at the Morgue. Laurent, by a look, told Therese all the horror he\nhad felt, and the latter, driven to extremities, compelled by a hand of\niron to part her lips, abruptly continued the conversation aloud:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou saw him at the Morgue?\u00e2\u0080\u009d she inquired of Laurent without naming\nCamille.\n\nLaurent looked as if he expected this question. He had been reading it\nfor a moment on the livid face of the young woman.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered he in a choking voice.\n\nThe murderers shivered, and drawing nearer the fire, extended their\nhands towards the flame as if an icy puff of wind had suddenly passed\nthrough the warm room. For an instant they maintained silence, coiled up\nlike balls, cowering on their chairs. Then Therese, in a hollow voice,\nresumed:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDid he seem to have suffered much?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nLaurent could not answer. He made a terrified gesture as if to put aside\nsome hideous vision, and rising went towards the bed. Then, returning\nviolently with open arms, he advanced towards Therese.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cKiss me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, extending his neck.\n\nTherese had risen, looking quite pale in her nightdress, and stood half\nthrown back, with her elbow resting on the marble mantelpiece. She gazed\nat the neck of her husband. On the white skin she had just caught sight\nof a pink spot. The rush of blood to the head, increased the size of\nthis spot, turning it bright red.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cKiss me, kiss me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d repeated Laurent, his face and neck scarlet.\n\nThe young woman threw her head further back, to avoid an embrace,\nand pressing the tip of her finger on the bite Camille had given her\nhusband, addressed him thus:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat have you here? I never noticed this wound before.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nIt seemed to Laurent as if the finger of Therese was boring a hole in\nhis throat. At the contact of this finger, he suddenly started backward,\nuttering a suppressed cry of pain.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he stammered, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat----\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe hesitated, but he could not lie, and in spite of himself, he told the\ntruth.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat is the bite Camille gave me. You know, in the boat. It is nothing.\nIt has healed. Kiss me, kiss me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd the wretch craned his neck which was burning him. He wanted Therese\nto kiss the scar, convinced that the lips of this woman would appease\nthe thousand pricks lacerating his flesh, and with raised chin he\npresented his extended neck for the embrace. Therese, who was almost\nlying back on the marble chimney-piece, gave a supreme gesture of\ndisgust, and in a supplicating voice exclaimed:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh! no, not on that part. There is blood.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe sank down on the low chair, trembling, with her forehead between\nher hands. Laurent remained where he stood for a moment, looking stupid.\nThen, all at once, with the clutch of a wild beast, he grasped the head\nof Therese in his two great hands, and by force brought her lips to the\nbite he had received from Camille on his neck. For an instant he kept,\nhe crushed, this head of a woman against his skin. Therese had given\nway, uttering hollow groans. She was choking on the neck of Laurent.\nWhen she had freed herself from his hands, she violently wiped her\nmouth, and spat in the fire. She had not said a word.\n\nLaurent, ashamed of his brutality, began walking slowly from the bed\nto the window. Suffering alone--the horrible burn--had made him exact a\nkiss from Therese, and when her frigid lips met the scorching scar,\nhe felt the pain more acutely. This kiss obtained by violence had just\ncrushed him. The shock had been so painful, that for nothing in the\nworld would he have received another.\n\nHe cast his eyes upon the woman with whom he was to live, and who sat\nshuddering, doubled up before the fire, turning her back to him; and he\nrepeated to himself that he no longer loved this woman, and that she no\nlonger loved him.\n\nFor nearly an hour Therese maintained her dejected attitude,\nwhile Laurent silently walked backward and forward. Both inwardly\nacknowledged, with terror, that their passion was dead, that they had\nkilled it in killing Camille. The embers on the hearth were gently dying\nout; a sheet of bright, clear fire shone above the ashes. Little by\nlittle, the heat of the room had become stifling; the flowers were\nfading, making the thick air sickly, with their heavy odour.\n\nLaurent, all at once, had an hallucination. As he turned round, coming\nfrom the window to the bed, he saw Camille in a dark corner, between\nthe chimney and wardrobe. The face of his victim looked greenish and\ndistorted, just as he had seen it on the slab at the Morgue. He remained\nglued to the carpet, fainting, leaning against a piece of furniture for\nsupport. At a hollow rattle in his throat, Therese raised her head.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere, there!\u00e2\u0080\u009d exclaimed Laurent in a terrified tone.\n\nWith extended arm, he pointed to the dark corner where he perceived\nthe sinister face of Camille. Therese, infected by his terror, went and\npressed against him.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is his portrait,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she murmured in an undertone, as if the face of\nher late husband could hear her.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHis portrait?\u00e2\u0080\u009d repeated Laurent, whose hair stood on end.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, you know, the painting you did,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she replied. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMy aunt was to have\nremoved it to her room. No doubt she forgot to take it down.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cReally; his portrait,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he.\n\nThe murderer had some difficulty in recognising the canvas. In his\ntrouble he forgot that it was he who had drawn those clashing strokes,\nwho had spread on those dirty tints that now terrified him. Terror made\nhim see the picture as it was, vile, wretchedly put together, muddy,\ndisplaying the grimacing face of a corpse on a black ground. His own\nwork astonished and crushed him by its atrocious ugliness; particularly\nthe two eyes which seemed floating in soft, yellowish orbits, reminding\nhim exactly of the decomposed eyes of the drowned man at the Morgue.\nFor a moment, he remained breathless, thinking Therese was telling an\nuntruth to allay his fears. Then he distinguished the frame, and little\nby little became calm.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGo and take it down,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he in a very low tone to the young woman.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh! no, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m afraid,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she answered with a shiver.\n\nLaurent began to tremble again. At moments the frame of the picture\ndisappeared, and he only saw the two white eyes giving him a long,\nsteady look.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI beg you to go and unhook it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, beseeching his companion.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, no,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she replied.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe will turn it face to the wall, and then it will not frighten us,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he\nsuggested.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said she, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI cannot do it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe murderer, cowardly and humble, thrust the young woman towards the\ncanvas, hiding behind her, so as to escape the gaze of the drowned man.\nBut she escaped, and he wanted to brazen the matter out. Approaching the\npicture, he raised his hand in search of the nail, but the portrait gave\nsuch a long, crushing, ignoble look, that Laurent after seeking to\nstare it out, found himself vanquished, and started back overpowered,\nmurmuring as he did so:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, you are right, Therese, we cannot do it. Your aunt shall take it\ndown to-morrow.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe resumed his walk up and down, with bowed head, feeling the portrait\nwas staring at him, following him with its eyes. At times, he could not\nprevent himself casting a side glance at the canvas; and, then, in the\ndepth of the darkness, he still perceived the dull, deadened eyes of the\ndrowned man. The thought that Camille was there, in a corner, watching\nhim, present on his wedding night, examining Therese and himself, ended\nby driving him mad with terror and despair.\n\nOne circumstance, which would have brought a smile to the lips of anyone\nelse, made him completely lose his head. As he stood before the fire, he\nheard a sort of scratching sound. He turned pale, imagining it came\nfrom the portrait, that Camille was descending from his frame. Then\nhe discovered that the noise was at the small door opening on the\nstaircase, and he looked at Therese who also showed signs of fear.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere is someone on the staircase,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he murmured. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWho can be coming\nthat way?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe young woman gave no answer. Both were thinking of the drowned man,\nand their temples became moist with icy perspiration. They sought refuge\ntogether at the end of the room, expecting to see the door suddenly\nopen, and the corpse of Camille fall on the floor. As the sound\ncontinued, but more sharply and irregularly, they thought their victim\nmust be tearing away the wood with his nails to get in. For the space of\nnearly five minutes, they dared not stir. Finally, a mewing was heard,\nand Laurent advancing, recognised the tabby cat belonging to Madame\nRaquin, which had been accidentally shut up in the room, and was\nendeavouring to get out by clawing at the door.\n\nFrancois, frightened by Laurent, sprang upon a chair at a bound. With\nhair on end and stiffened paws, he looked his new master in the face, in\na harsh and cruel manner. The young man did not like cats, and Francois\nalmost terrified him. In this moment of excitement and alarm, he\nimagined the cat was about to fly in his face to avenge Camille. He\nfancied the beast must know everything, that there were thoughts in\nhis strangely dilated round eyes. The fixed gaze of the animal caused\nLaurent to lower his lids. As he was about to give Francois a kick,\nTherese exclaimed:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t hurt him.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThis sentence produced a strange impression on Laurent, and an absurd\nidea got into his head.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCamille has entered into this cat,\u00e2\u0080\u009d thought he. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI shall have to kill\nthe beast. It looks like a human being.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe refrained from giving the kick, being afraid of hearing Francois\nspeak to him with the voice of Camille. Then he said to himself that\nthis animal knew too much, and that he should have to throw it out of\nthe window. But he had not the pluck to accomplish his design. Francois\nmaintained a fighting attitude. With claws extended, and back curved\nin sullen irritation, he followed the least movement of his enemy with\nsuperb tranquillity. The metallic sparkle of his eyes troubled Laurent,\nwho hastened to open the dining-room door, and the cat fled with a\nshrill mew.\n\nTherese had again seated herself before the extinguished fire. Laurent\nresumed his walk from bed to window. It was thus that they awaited\nday-light. They did not think of going to bed; their hearts were\nthoroughly dead. They had but one, single desire: to leave the room they\nwere in, and where they were choking. They experienced a real discomfort\nin being shut up together, and in breathing the same atmosphere. They\nwould have liked someone to be there to interrupt their privacy, to\ndrag them from the cruel embarrassment in which they found themselves,\nsitting one before the other without opening their lips, and unable\nto resuscitate their love. Their long silences tortured them, silence\nloaded with bitter and despairing complaints, with mute reproaches,\nwhich they distinctly heard in the tranquil air.\n\nDay came at last, a dirty, whitish dawn, bringing penetrating cold with\nit. When the room had filled with dim light, Laurent, who was shivering,\nfelt calmer. He looked the portrait of Camille straight in the face,\nand saw it as it was, commonplace and puerile. He took it down, and\nshrugging his shoulders, called himself a fool. Therese had risen\nfrom the low chair, and was tumbling the bed about for the purpose of\ndeceiving her aunt, so as to make her believe they had passed a happy\nnight.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLook here,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Laurent brutally remarked to her, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI hope we shall sleep\nwell to-night! There must be an end to this sort of childishness.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nTherese cast a deep, grave glance at him.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou understand,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he continued. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI did not marry for the purpose of\npassing sleepless nights. We are just like children. It was you who\ndisturbed me with your ghostly airs. To-night you will try to be gay,\nand not frighten me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe forced himself to laugh without knowing why he did so.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI will try,\u00e2\u0080\u009d gloomily answered the young woman.\n\nSuch was the wedding night of Therese and Laurent.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXII\n\nThe following nights proved still more cruel. The murderers had wished\nto pass this part of the twenty-four hours together, so as to be able\nto defend themselves against the drowned man, and by a strange effect,\nsince they had been doing so, they shuddered the more. They were\nexasperated, and their nerves so irritated, that they underwent\natrocious attacks of suffering and terror, at the exchange of a simple\nword or look. At the slightest conversation between them, at the least\ntalk, they had alone, they began raving, and were ready to draw blood.\n\nThe sort of remorse Laurent experienced was purely physical. His body,\nhis irritated nerves and trembling frame alone were afraid of the\ndrowned man. His conscience was for nothing in his terror. He did not\nfeel the least regret at having killed Camille. When he was calm, when\nthe spectre did not happen to be there, he would have committed the\nmurder over again, had he thought his interests absolutely required it.\n\nDuring the daytime he laughed at himself for his fright, making up his\nmind to be stronger, and he harshly rebuked Therese, whom he accused of\ntroubling him. According to what he said, it was Therese who shuddered,\nit was Therese alone who brought on the frightful scenes, at night, in\nthe bedroom. And, as soon as night came, as soon as he found himself\nshut in with his wife, icy perspiration pearled on his skin, and his\nframe shook with childish terror.\n\nHe thus underwent intermittent nervous attacks that returned nightly,\nand threw his senses into confusion while showing him the hideous\ngreen face of his victim. These attacks resembled the accesses of some\nfrightful illness, a sort of hysteria of murder. The name of illness,\nof nervous affection, was really the only one to give to the terror that\nLaurent experienced. His face became convulsed, his limbs rigid, his\nnerves could be seen knotting beneath his skin. The body suffered\nhorribly, while the spirit remained absent. The wretch felt no\nrepentance. His passion for Therese had conveyed a frightful evil to\nhim, and that was all.\n\nTherese also found herself a prey to these heavy shocks. But, in her\nterror, she showed herself a woman: she felt vague remorse, unavowed\nregret. She, at times, had an inclination to cast herself on her knees\nand beseech the spectre of Camille to pardon her, while swearing\nto appease it by repentance. Maybe Laurent perceived these acts of\ncowardice on the part of Therese, for when they were agitated by the\ncommon terror, he laid the blame on her, and treated her with brutality.\n\nOn the first nights, they were unable to go to bed. They waited for\ndaylight, seated before the fire, or pacing to and fro as on the evening\nof the wedding-day. The thought of lying down, side by side, on the\nbed, caused them a sort of terrifying repugnance. By tacit consent, they\navoided kissing one another, and they did not even look at their couch,\nwhich Therese tumbled about in the morning.\n\nWhen overcome with fatigue, they slept for an hour or two in the\narmchairs, to awaken with a start, under the influence of the sinister\ndenouement of some nightmare. On awakening, with limbs stiff and tired,\nshivering all over with discomfort and cold, their faces marbled with\nlivid blotches, they contemplated one another in bewilderment, astonished\nto see themselves there. And they displayed strange bashfulness towards\neach other, ashamed at showing their disgust and terror.\n\nBut they struggled against sleep as much as they could. They seated\nthemselves, one on each side of the chimney, and talked of a thousand\ntrifles, being very careful not to let the conversation drop. There was\na broad space between them in front of the fire. When they turned their\nheads, they imagined that Camille had drawn a chair there, and occupied\nthis space, warming his feet in a lugubrious, bantering fashion. This\nvision, which they had seen on the evening of the wedding-day, returned\neach night.\n\nAnd this corpse taking a mute, but jeering part, in their interviews,\nthis horribly disfigured body ever remaining there, overwhelmed them\nwith continued anxiety. Not daring to move, they half blinded themselves\nstaring at the scorching flames, and, when unable to resist any longer,\nthey cast a timid glance aside, their eyes irritated by the glowing\ncoal, created the vision, and conveyed to it a reddish glow.\n\nLaurent, in the end, refused to remain seated any longer, without\navowing the cause of this whim to Therese. The latter understood that he\nmust see Camille as she saw him; and, in her turn, she declared that\nthe heat made her feel ill, and that she would be more comfortable a few\nsteps away from the chimney. Pushing back her armchair to the foot of\nthe bed, she remained there overcome, while her husband resumed his walk\nin the room. From time to time, he opened the window, allowing the icy\nair of the cold January night to fill the apartment, and this calmed his\nfever.\n\nFor a week, the newly-married couple passed the nights in this fashion,\ndozing and getting a little rest in the daytime, Therese behind the\ncounter in the shop, Laurent in his office. At night they belonged to\npain and fear. And the strangest part of the whole business was the\nattitude they maintained towards each other. They did not utter one word\nof love, but feigned to have forgotten the past; and seemed to accept,\nto tolerate one another like sick people, feeling secret pity for their\nmutual sufferings.\n\nBoth hoped to conceal their disgust and fear, and neither seemed to\nthink of the peculiar nights they passed, which should have enlightened\nthem as to the real state of their beings. When they sat up until\nmorning, barely exchanging a word, turning pale at the least sound, they\nlooked as if they thought all newly-married folk conducted themselves\nin the same way, during the first days of their marriage. This was the\nclumsy hypocrisy of two fools.\n\nThey were soon so overcome by weariness that they one night decided\nto lie on the bed. They did not undress, but threw themselves, as they\nwere, on the quilt, fearing lest their bare skins should touch, for they\nfancied they would receive a painful shock at the least contact. Then,\nwhen they had slept thus, in an anxious sleep, for two nights, they\nrisked removing their clothes, and slipping between the sheets. But\nthey remained apart, and took all sorts of precautions so as not to come\ntogether.\n\nTherese got into bed first, and lay down close to the wall. Laurent\nwaited until she had made herself quite comfortable, and then ventured\nto stretch himself out at the opposite edge of the mattress, so that\nthere was a broad space between them. It was there that the corpse of\nCamille lay.\n\nWhen the two murderers were extended under the same sheet, and had\nclosed their eyes, they fancied they felt the damp corpse of their\nvictim, lying in the middle of the bed, and turning their flesh icy\ncold. It was like a vile obstacle separating them. They were seized with\nfever and delirium, and this obstacle, in their minds, became material.\nThey touched the corpse, they saw it spread out, like a greenish and\ndissolved shred of something, and they inhaled the infectious odour of\nthis lump of human putrefaction. All their senses were in a state of\nhallucination, conveying intolerable acuteness to their sensations.\n\nThe presence of this filthy bedfellow kept them motionless, silent,\nabstracted with anguish. Laurent, at times, thought of taking Therese\nviolently in his arms; but he dared not move. He said to himself that he\ncould not extend his hand, without getting it full of the soft flesh of\nCamille. Next he fancied that the drowned man came to sleep between\nthem so as to prevent them clasping one another, and he ended by\nunderstanding that Camille was jealous.\n\nNevertheless, ever and anon, they sought to exchange a timid kiss, to\nsee what would happen. The young man jeered at his wife, and ordered\nher to embrace him. But their lips were so cold that it seemed as if\nthe dead man had got between their mouths. Both felt disgusted. Therese\nshuddered with horror, and Laurent who heard her teeth chattering,\nrailed at her:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy are you trembling?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he exclaimed. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAre you afraid of Camille? Ah!\nthe poor man is as dead as a doornail at this moment.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBoth avoided saying what made them shudder. When an hallucination\nbrought the countenance of the drowned man before Therese, she closed\nher eyes, keeping her terror to herself, not daring to speak to her\nhusband of her vision, lest she should bring on a still more terrible\ncrisis. And it was just the same with Laurent. When driven to\nextremities, he, in a fit of despair, accused Therese of being afraid\nof Camille. The name, uttered aloud, occasioned additional anguish. The\nmurderer raved.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, yes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he stammered, addressing the young woman, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou are afraid of\nCamille. I can see that plain enough! You are a silly thing, you have\nno pluck at all. Look here! just go to sleep quietly. Do you think your\nhusband will come and pull you out of bed by the heels, because I happen\nto be sleeping with you?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThis idea that the drowned man might come and pull them out of bed by\nthe heels, made the hair of Laurent stand on end, and he continued with\ngreater violence, while still in the utmost terror himself.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI shall have to take you some night to the cemetery. We will open the\ncoffin Camille is in, and you will see what he looks like! Then you will\nperhaps cease being afraid. Go on, he doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know we threw him in the\nwater.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nTherese with her head under the bedclothes, was uttering smothered\ngroans.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe threw him into the water, because he was in our way,\u00e2\u0080\u009d resumed her\nhusband. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll throw him in again, will we not? Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t act like a\nchild. Show a little strength. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s silly to trouble our happiness. You\nsee, my dear, when we are dead and underground, we shall be neither less\nnor more happy, because we cast an idiot in the Seine, and we shall have\nfreely enjoyed our love which will have been an advantage. Come, give me\na kiss.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe young woman kissed him, but she was icy cold, and half crazy, while\nhe shuddered as much as she did.\n\nFor a fortnight Laurent was asking himself how he could kill Camille\nagain. He had flung him in the water; and yet he was not dead enough,\nbecause he came every night to sleep in the bed of Therese. While the\nmurderers thought that having committed the crime, they could love one\nanother in peace, their resuscitated victim arrived to make their touch\nlike ice. Therese was not a widow. Laurent found that he was mated to a\nwoman who already had a drowned man for husband.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIII\n\nLittle by little, Laurent became furiously mad, and resolved to drive\nCamille from his bed. He had first of all slept with his clothes on,\nthen he had avoided touching Therese. In rage and despair, he wanted, at\nlast, to take his wife in his arms, and crush the spectre of his victim\nrather than leave her to it. This was a superb revolt of brutality.\n\nThe hope that the kisses of Therese would cure him of his insomnia, had\nalone brought him into the room of the young woman. When he had found\nhimself there, in the position of master, he had become a prey to such\natrocious attacks, that it had not even occurred to him to attempt\nthe cure. And he had remained overwhelmed for three weeks, without\nremembering that he had done everything to obtain Therese, and now that\nshe was in his possession, he could not touch her without increased\nsuffering.\n\nHis excessive anguish drew him from this state of dejection. In\nthe first moment of stupor, amid the strange discouragement of the\nwedding-night, he had forgotten the reasons that had urged him to marry.\nBut his repeated bad dreams had aroused in him a feeling of sullen\nirritation, which triumphed over his cowardice, and restored his memory.\nHe remembered he had married in order to drive away nightmare, by\npressing his wife closely to his breast. Then, one night, he abruptly\ntook Therese in his arms, and, at the risk of passing over the corpse of\nthe drowned man, drew her violently to him.\n\nThe young woman, who was also driven to extremes, would have cast\nherself into the fire had she thought that flames would have purified\nher flesh, and delivered her from her woe. She returned Laurent his\nadvances, determined to be either consumed by the caresses of this man,\nor to find relief in them.\n\nAnd they clasped one another in a hideous embrace. Pain and horror took\nthe place of love. When their limbs touched, it was like falling on live\ncoal. They uttered a cry, pressing still closer together, so as not\nto leave room for the drowned man. But they still felt the shreds of\nCamille, which were ignobly squeezed between them, freezing their skins\nin parts, whilst in others they were burning hot.\n\nTheir kisses were frightfully cruel. Therese sought the bite\nthat Camille had given in the stiff, swollen neck of Laurent, and\npassionately pressed her lips to it. There was the raw sore; this wound\nonce healed, and the murderers would sleep in peace. The young woman\nunderstood this, and she endeavoured to cauterise the bad place with the\nfire of her caresses. But she scorched her lips, and Laurent thrust her\nviolently away, giving a dismal groan. It seemed to him that she was\npressing a red-hot iron to his neck. Therese, half mad, came back.\nShe wanted to kiss the scar again. She experienced a keenly voluptuous\nsensation in placing her mouth on this piece of skin wherein Camille had\nburied his teeth.\n\nAt one moment she thought of biting her husband in the same place, of\ntearing away a large piece of flesh, of making a fresh and deeper wound,\nthat would remove the trace of the old one. And she said to herself that\nshe would no more turn pale when she saw the marks of her own teeth.\nBut Laurent shielded his neck from her kisses. The smarting pain he\nexperienced was too acute, and each time his wife presented her lips, he\npushed her back. They struggled in this manner with a rattling in their\nthroats, writhing in the horror of their caresses.\n\nThey distinctly felt that they only increased their suffering. They\nmight well strain one another in these terrible clasps, they cried out\nwith pain, they burnt and bruised each other, but were unable to calm\ntheir frightfully excited nerves. Each strain rendered their disgust\nmore intense. While exchanging these ghastly embraces, they were a prey\nto the most terrible hallucinations, imagining that the drowned man was\ndragging them by the heels, and violently jerking the bedstead.\n\nFor a moment they let one another go, feeling repugnance and invincible\nnervous agitation. Then they determined not to be conquered. They\nclasped each other again in a fresh embrace, and once more were obliged\nto separate, for it seemed as if red-hot bradawls were entering their\nlimbs. At several intervals they attempted in this way to overcome their\ndisgust, by tiring, by wearing out their nerves. And each time their\nnerves became irritated and strained, causing them such exasperation,\nthat they would perhaps have died of enervation had they remained in the\narms of one another. This battle against their own bodies excited them\nto madness, and they obstinately sought to gain the victory. Finally,\na more acute crisis exhausted them. They received a shock of such\nincredible violence that they thought they were about to have a fit.\n\nCast back one on each side of the bed, burning and bruised, they began\nto sob. And amidst their tears, they seemed to hear the triumphant\nlaughter of the drowned man, who again slid, chuckling, under the sheet.\nThey had been unable to drive him from the bed and were vanquished.\nCamille gently stretched himself between them, whilst Laurent deplored\nhis want of power to thrust him away, and Therese trembled lest the\ncorpse should have the idea of taking advantage of the victory to press\nher, in his turn, in his arms, in the quality of legitimate master.\n\nThey had made a supreme effort. In face of their defeat, they understood\nthat, in future, they dared not exchange the smallest kiss. What they\nhad attempted, in order to drive away their terror, had plunged them\ninto greater fright. And, as they felt the chill of the corpse, which\nwas now to separate them for ever, they shed bitter tears, asking\nthemselves, with anguish, what would become of them.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIV\n\nIn accordance with the hopes of old Michaud, when doing his best to\nbring about the marriage of Therese and Laurent, the Thursday evenings\nresumed their former gaiety, as soon as the wedding was over.\n\nThese evenings were in great peril at the time of the death of Camille.\nThe guests came, in fear, into this house of mourning; each week they\nwere trembling with anxiety, lest they should be definitely dismissed.\n\nThe idea that the door of the shop would no doubt at last be closed to\nthem, terrified Michaud and Grivet, who clung to their habits with the\ninstinct and obstinacy of brutes. They said to themselves that the old\nwoman and young widow would one day go and weep over the defunct at\nVernon or elsewhere, and then, on Thursday nights, they would not know\nwhat to do. In the mind\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eye they saw themselves wandering about the\narcade in a lamentable fashion, dreaming of colossal games at dominoes.\n\nPending the advent of these bad times, they timidly enjoyed their final\nmoments of happiness, arriving with an anxious, sugary air at the shop,\nand repeating to themselves, on each occasion, that they would perhaps\nreturn no more. For over a year they were beset with these fears. In\nface of the tears of Madame Raquin and the silence of Therese, they\ndared not make themselves at ease and laugh. They felt they were no\nlonger at home as in the time of Camille; it seemed, so to say, that\nthey were stealing every evening they passed seated at the dining-room\ntable. It was in these desperate circumstances that the egotism of\nMichaud urged him to strike a masterly stroke by finding a husband for\nthe widow of the drowned man.\n\nOn the Thursday following the marriage, Grivet and Michaud made\na triumphant entry into the dining-room. They had conquered. The\ndining-room belonged to them again. They no longer feared dismissal.\nThey came there as happy people, stretching out their legs, and cracking\ntheir former jokes, one after the other. It could be seen from their\ndelighted and confident attitude that, in their idea, a revolution had\nbeen accomplished. All recollection of Camille had been dispelled. The\ndead husband, the spectre that cast a chill over everyone, had\nbeen driven away by the living husband. The past and its joys were\nresuscitated. Laurent took the place of Camille, all cause for sadness\ndisappeared, the guests could now laugh without grieving anyone; and,\nindeed, it was their duty to laugh to cheer up this worthy family who\nwere good enough to receive them.\n\nHenceforth, Grivet and Michaud, who for nearly eighteen months had\nvisited the house under the pretext of consoling Madame Raquin, could\nset their little hypocrisy aside, and frankly come and doze opposite one\nanother to the sharp ring of the dominoes.\n\nAnd each week brought a Thursday evening, each week those lifeless and\ngrotesque heads which formerly had exasperated Therese, assembled round\nthe table. The young woman talked of showing these folk the door; their\nbursts of foolish laughter and silly reflections irritated her. But\nLaurent made her understand that such a step would be a mistake; it was\nnecessary that the present should resemble the past as much as possible;\nand, above all, they must preserve the friendship of the police, of\nthose idiots who protected them from all suspicion. Therese gave way.\nThe guests were well received, and they viewed with delight a future\nfull of a long string of warm Thursday evenings.\n\nIt was about this time that the lives of the couple became, in a way,\ndivided in two.\n\nIn the morning, when day drove away the terror of night, Laurent hastily\ndressed himself. But he only recovered his ease and egotistic calm when\nin the dining-room, seated before an enormous bowl of coffee and milk,\nwhich Therese prepared for him. Madame Raquin, who had become even more\nfeeble and could barely get down to the shop, watched him eating with a\nmaternal smile. He swallowed the toast, filled his stomach and little by\nlittle became tranquillised. After the coffee, he drank a small glass of\nbrandy which completely restored him. Then he said \u00e2\u0080\u009cgood-bye\u00e2\u0080\u009d to Madame\nRaquin and Therese, without ever kissing them, and strolled to his\noffice.\n\nSpring was at hand; the trees along the quays were becoming covered with\nleaves, with light, pale green lacework. The river ran with caressing\nsounds below; above, the first sunny rays of the year shed gentle\nwarmth. Laurent felt himself another man in the fresh air; he freely\ninhaled this breath of young life descending from the skies of April\nand May; he sought the sun, halting to watch the silvery reflection\nstreaking the Seine, listening to the sounds on the quays, allowing\nthe acrid odours of early day to penetrate him, enjoying the clear,\ndelightful morn.\n\nHe certainly thought very little about Camille. Sometimes he listlessly\ncontemplated the Morgue on the other side of the water, and his mind\nthen reverted to his victim, like a man of courage might think of\na silly fright that had come over him. With stomach full, and face\nrefreshed, he recovered his thick-headed tranquillity. He reached his\noffice, and passed the whole day gaping, and awaiting the time to leave.\nHe was a mere clerk like the others, stupid and weary, without an\nidea in his head, save that of sending in his resignation and taking\na studio. He dreamed vaguely of a new existence of idleness, and this\nsufficed to occupy him until evening.\n\nThoughts of the shop in the arcade never troubled him. At night, after\nlonging for the hour of release since the morning, he left his office\nwith regret, and followed the quays again, secretly troubled and\nanxious. However slowly he walked, he had to enter the shop at last, and\nthere terror awaited him.\n\nTherese experienced the same sensations. So long as Laurent was not\nbeside her, she felt at ease. She had dismissed her charwoman, saying\nthat everything was in disorder, and the shop and apartment filthy\ndirty. She all at once had ideas of tidiness. The truth was that she\nfelt the necessity of moving about, of doing something, of exercising\nher stiff limbs. She went hither and thither all the morning, sweeping,\ndusting, cleaning the rooms, washing up the plates and dishes, doing\nwork that would have disgusted her formerly. These household duties kept\nher on her feet, active and silent, until noon, without allowing her\ntime to think of aught else than the cobwebs hanging from the ceiling\nand the greasy plates.\n\nOn the stroke of twelve, she went to the kitchen to prepare lunch. At\ntable, Madame Raquin was pained to see her always rising to fetch the\ndishes; she was touched and annoyed at the activity displayed by her\nniece; she scolded her, and Therese replied that it was necessary to\neconomise. When the meal was over, the young woman dressed, and at last\ndecided to join her aunt behind the counter. There, sleep overtook\nher; worn out by her restless nights, she dozed off, yielding to the\nvoluptuous feeling of drowsiness that gained her, as soon as she sat\ndown.\n\nThese were only light spells of heaviness, replete with vague charm that\ncalmed her nerves. The thoughts of Camille left her; she enjoyed that\ntranquil repose of invalids who are all at once freed from pain.\nShe felt relieved in body, her mind free, she sank into a gentle and\nrepairing state of nothingness. Deprived of these few calm moments, she\nwould have broken down under the tension of her nervous system. These\nspells of somnolence gave her strength to suffer again, and become\nterrified the ensuing night. As a matter of fact she did not sleep,\nshe barely closed her lids, and was lost in a dream of peace. When a\ncustomer entered, she opened her eyes, served the few sous worth of\narticles asked for, and fell back into the floating reverie.\n\nIn this manner she passed three or four hours of perfect happiness,\nanswering her aunt in monosyllables, and yielding with real enjoyment to\nthese moments of unconsciousness which relieved her of her thoughts, and\ncompletely overcame her. She barely, at long intervals, cast a glance\ninto the arcade, and was particularly at her ease in cloudy weather,\nwhen it was dark and she could conceal her lassitude in the gloom.\n\nThe damp and disgusting arcade, crossed by a lot of wretched drenched\npedestrians, whose umbrellas dripped upon the tiles, seemed to her like\nan alley in a low quarter, a sort of dirty, sinister corridor, where\nno one would come to seek and trouble her. At moments, when she saw the\ndull gleams of light that hung around her, when she smelt the bitter\nodour of the dampness, she imagined she had just been buried alive, that\nshe was underground, at the bottom of a common grave swarming with dead.\nAnd this thought consoled and appeased her, for she said to herself that\nshe was now in security, that she was about to die and would suffer no\nmore.\n\nBut sometimes she had to keep her eyes open; Suzanne paid her a visit,\nand remained embroidering near the counter all the afternoon. The wife\nof Olivier, with her putty face and slow movements, now pleased Therese,\nwho experienced strange relief in observing this poor, broken-up\ncreature, and had made a friend of her. She loved to see her at her\nside, smiling with her faint smile, more dead than alive, and bringing\ninto the shop the stuffy odour of the cemetery. When the blue eyes of\nSuzanne, transparent as glass, rested fixedly on those of Therese, the\nlatter experienced a beneficent chill in the marrow of her bones.\n\nTherese remained thus until four o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock, when she returned to the\nkitchen, and there again sought fatigue, preparing dinner for Laurent\nwith febrile haste. But when her husband appeared on the threshold she\nfelt a tightening in the throat, and all her being once more became a\nprey to anguish.\n\nEach day, the sensations of the couple were practically the same. During\nthe daytime, when they were not face to face, they enjoyed delightful\nhours of repose; at night, as soon as they came together, both\nexperienced poignant discomfort.\n\nThe evenings, nevertheless, were calm. Therese and Laurent, who\nshuddered at the thought of going to their room, sat up as long as\npossible. Madame Raquin, reclining in a great armchair, was placed\nbetween them, and chatted in her placid voice. She spoke of Vernon,\nstill thinking of her son, but avoiding to mention him from a sort of\nfeeling of diffidence for the others; she smiled at her dear children,\nand formed plans for their future. The lamp shed its faint gleams on her\nwhite face, and her words sounded particularly sweet in the silence and\nstillness of the room.\n\nThe murderers, one seated on each side of her, silent and motionless,\nseemed to be attentively listening to what she said. In truth they did\nnot attempt to follow the sense of the gossip of the good old lady. They\nwere simply pleased to hear this sound of soft words which prevented\nthem attending the crash of their own thoughts. They dared not\ncast their eyes on one another, but looked at Madame Raquin to give\nthemselves countenances. They never breathed a word about going to\nbed; they would have remained there until morning, listening to the\naffectionate nonsense of the former mercer, amid the appeasement she\nspread around her, had she not herself expressed the desire to retire.\nIt was only then that they quitted the dining-room and entered their\nown apartment in despair, as if casting themselves to the bottom of an\nabyss.\n\nBut they soon had much more preference for the Thursday gatherings,\nthan for these family evenings. When alone with Madame Raquin, they were\nunable to divert their thoughts; the feeble voice of their aunt, and her\ntender gaiety, did not stifle the cries that lacerated them. They could\nfeel bedtime coming on, and they shuddered when their eyes caught sight\nof the door of their room. Awaiting the moment when they would be alone,\nbecame more and more cruel as the evening advanced. On Thursday night,\non the contrary, they were giddy with folly, one forgot the presence of\nthe other, and they suffered less. Therese ended by heartily longing for\nthe reception days. Had Michaud and Grivet not arrived, she would have\ngone and fetched them. When strangers were in the dining-room, between\nherself and Laurent, she felt more calm. She would have liked to always\nhave guests there, to hear a noise, something to divert her, and detach\nher from her thoughts. In the presence of other people, she displayed a\nsort of nervous gaiety. Laurent also recovered his previous merriment,\nreturning to his coarse peasant jests, his hoarse laughter, his\npractical jokes of a former canvas dauber. Never had these gatherings\nbeen so gay and noisy.\n\nIt was thus that Laurent and Therese could remain face to face, once a\nweek, without shuddering.\n\nBut they were soon beset with further anxiety. Paralysis was little by\nlittle gaining on Madame Raquin, and they foresaw the day when she\nwould be riveted to her armchair, feeble and doltish. The poor old lady\nalready began to stammer fragments of disjointed phrases; her voice was\ngrowing weaker, and her limbs were one by one losing their vitality.\nShe was becoming a thing. It was with terror that Therese and Laurent\nobserved the breaking up of this being who still separated them, and\nwhose voice drew them from their bad dreams. When the old mercer lost\nher intelligence, and remained stiff and silent in her armchair, they\nwould find themselves alone, and in the evening would no longer be able\nto escape the dreadful face to face conversation. Then their terror\nwould commence at six o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock instead of midnight. It would drive them\nmad.\n\nThey made every effort to give Madame Raquin that health which had\nbecome so necessary to them. They called in doctors, and bestowed on the\npatient all sorts of little attentions. Even this occupation of nurses\ncaused them to forget, and afforded them an appeasement that encouraged\nthem to double in zeal. They did not wish to lose a third party\nwho rendered their evenings supportable; and they did not wish the\ndining-room and the whole house to become a cruel and sinister spot like\ntheir room.\n\nMadame Raquin was singularly touched at the assiduous care they took of\nher. She applauded herself, amid tears, at having united them, and at\nhaving abandoned to them her forty thousand francs. Never, since the\ndeath of her son, had she counted on so much affection in her final\nmoments. Her old age was quite softened by the tenderness of her dear\nchildren. She did not feel the implacable paralysis which, in spite of\nall, made her more and more rigid day by day.\n\nNevertheless, Therese and Laurent continued to lead their double\nexistence. In each of them there were like two distinct beings: a\nnervous, terrified being who shuddered as soon as dusk set in, and a\ntorpid forgetful being, who breathed at ease when the sun rose. They\nlived two lives, crying out in anguish when alone, and peacefully\nsmiling in company. Never did their faces, in public, show the slightest\ntrace of the sufferings that had reached them in private. They appeared\ncalm and happy, and instinctively concealed their troubles.\n\nTo see them so tranquil in the daytime, no one would have suspected\nthe hallucinations that tortured them every night. They would have been\ntaken for a couple blessed by heaven, and living in the enjoyment of\nfull felicity. Grivet gallantly called them the \u00e2\u0080\u009cturtle-doves.\u00e2\u0080\u009d When\nhe jested about their fatigued looks, Laurent and Therese barely turned\npale, and even succeeded in forcing on a smile. They became accustomed\nto the naughty jokes of the old clerk.\n\nSo long as they remained in the dining-room, they were able to keep\ntheir terror under control. The mind could not imagine the frightful\nchange that came over them, as soon as they were shut up in their\nbedroom. On the Thursday night, particularly, this transformation was\nso violently brutal, that it seemed as if accomplished in a supernatural\nworld. The drama in the bedroom, by its strangeness, by its savage\npassion, surpassed all belief, and remained deeply concealed within\ntheir aching beings. Had they spoken of it, they would have been taken\nfor mad.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHow happy those sweethearts are!\u00e2\u0080\u009d frequently remarked old Michaud.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThey hardly say a word, but that does not prevent them thinking. I bet\nthey devour one another with kisses when we have gone.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nSuch was the opinion of the company. Therese and Laurent came to be\nspoken of as a model couple. All the tenants in the Arcade of the Pont\nNeuf extolled the affection, the tranquil happiness, the everlasting\nhoneymoon of the married pair. They alone knew that the corpse of\nCamille slept between them; they alone felt, beneath the calm exterior\nof their faces, the nervous contractions that, at night, horribly\ndistorted their features, and changed the placid expression of their\nphysiognomies into hideous masks of pain.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXV\n\nAt the expiration of four months, Laurent thought of taking advantage\nof the profit he had calculated on deriving from his marriage. He would\nhave abandoned his wife, and fled from the spectre of Camille, three\ndays after the wedding, had not his interest detained him at the shop in\nthe arcade. He accepted his nights of terror, he remained in the anguish\nthat was choking him, so as not to be deprived of the benefit of his\ncrime.\n\nIf he parted from Therese, he would again be plunged in poverty, and\nbe forced to retain his post; by remaining with her, he would, on the\ncontrary, be able to satisfy his inclination for idleness, and to live\nliberally, doing nothing, on the revenue Madame Raquin had placed in the\nname of his wife. Very likely he would have fled with the 40,000 francs,\nhad he been able to realise them; but the old mercer, on the advice of\nMichaud, had shown the prudence to protect the interests of her niece in\nthe marriage contract.\n\nLaurent, in this manner, found himself attached to Therese by a powerful\nbond. As a set-off against his atrocious nights, he determined at least\nto be kept in blissful laziness, well fed, warmly clothed, and provided\nwith the necessary cash in his pocket to satisfy his whims. At this\nprice alone, would he consent to sleep with the corpse of the drowned\nman.\n\nOne evening, he announced to Madame Raquin and his wife that he had sent\nin his resignation, and would quit his office at the end of a fortnight.\nTherese gave a gesture of anxiety. He hastened to add that he intended\ntaking a small studio where he would go on with his painting. He spoke\nat length about the annoyance of his employment, and the broad horizons\nthat Art opened to him. Now that he had a few sous and could make a\nbid for success, he wished to see whether he was not capable of great\nachievements.\n\nThe speech he made on this subject simply concealed a ferocious desire\nto resume his former studio life. Therese sat with pinched lips without\nreplying; she had no idea of allowing Laurent to squander the small\nfortune that assured her liberty. When her husband pressed her with\nquestions in view of obtaining her consent, she answered curtly, giving\nhim to understand that if he left his office, he would no longer be\nearning any money, and would be living entirely at her expense.\n\nBut, as she spoke, Laurent observed her so keenly, that he troubled her,\nand arrested on her lips the refusal she was about to utter. She fancied\nshe read in the eyes of her accomplice, this menacing threat:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIf you do not consent, I shall reveal everything.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe began to stammer, and Madame Raquin exclaimed that the desire of her\ndear son was no more than what was just, and that they must give him the\nmeans to become a man of talent. The good lady spoilt Laurent as she had\nspoilt Camille. Quite mollified by the caresses the young man lavished\non her, she belonged to him, and never failed to take his part.\n\nIt was therefore decided that Laurent should have a studio, and receive\none hundred francs a month pocket-money. The budget of the family was\narranged in this way: the profits realised in the mercery business would\npay the rent of the shop and apartment, and the balance would almost\nsuffice for the daily expenses of the family; Laurent would receive the\nrent of his studio and his one hundred francs a month, out of the two\nthousand and a few hundred francs income from the funded money, the\nremainder going into the general purse. In that way the capital would\nremain intact. This arrangement somewhat tranquillised Therese, who\nnevertheless made her husband swear that he would never go beyond the\nsum allowed him. But as to that matter, she said to herself that Laurent\ncould not get possession of the 40,000 francs without her signature, and\nshe was thoroughly determined that she would never place her name to any\ndocument.\n\nOn the morrow, Laurent took a small studio in the lower part of the Rue\nMazarine, which his eye had been fixed on for a month. He did not mean\nto leave his office without having a refuge where he could quietly pass\nhis days far away from Therese. At the end of the fortnight, he bade\nadieu to his colleagues. Grivet was stupefied at his departure. A young\nman, said he, who had such a brilliant future before him, a young man\nwho in the space of four years, had reached a salary that he, Grivet,\nhad taken twenty years to attain! Laurent stupefied him still more, when\nhe told him he was going to give his whole time to painting.\n\nAt last the artist installed himself in his studio, which was a sort\nof square loft about seven or eight yards long by the same breadth. The\nceiling which inclined abruptly in a rapid slope, was pierced by a large\nwindow conveying a white raw light to the floor and blackish walls.\nThe sounds in the street did not ascend so high. This silent, wan room,\nopening above on the sky, resembled a hole, or a vault dug out of grey\nclay. Laurent furnished the place anywise; he brought a couple of chairs\nwith holes in the rush seats, a table that he set against the wall so\nthat it might not slip down, an old kitchen dresser, his colour-box and\neasel; all the luxury in the place consisted of a spacious divan which\nhe purchased for thirty francs from a second-hand dealer.\n\nHe remained a fortnight without even thinking of touching his brushes.\nHe arrived between eight and nine o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock in the morning, smoked,\nstretched himself on the divan, and awaited noon, delighted that it was\nmorning, and that he had many hours of daylight before him. At twelve\nhe went to lunch. As soon as the meal was over, he hastened back, to be\nalone, and get away from the pale face of Therese. He next went through\nthe process of digestion, sleeping spread out on the divan until\nevening. His studio was an abode of peace where he did not tremble. One\nday his wife asked him if she might visit this dear refuge. He refused,\nand as, notwithstanding his refusal, she came and knocked at the door,\nhe refrained from opening to her, telling her in the evening that he\nhad spent the day at the Louvre Museum. He was afraid that Therese might\nbring the spectre of Camille with her.\n\nIdleness ended by weighing heavily on his shoulders, so he purchased a\ncanvas and colours, and set to work. As he had not sufficient money to\npay models, he resolved to paint according to fancy, without troubling\nabout nature, and he began the head of a man.\n\nBut at this time, he did not shut himself up so much as he had done;\nhe worked for two or three hours every morning and passed the afternoon\nstrolling hither and thither in Paris and its vicinity. It was opposite\nthe Institut, on his return from one of these long walks, that he\nknocked up against his old college friend, who had met with a nice\nlittle success, thanks to the good fellowship of his comrades, at the\nlast Salon.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat, is it you?\u00e2\u0080\u009d exclaimed the painter. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAh! my poor Laurent, I hardly\nrecognise you. You have lost flesh.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI am married,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Laurent in an embarrassed tone.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMarried, you!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the other. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThen I am not surprised to see you look\nso funny: and what are you doing now?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI have taken a small studio,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied Laurent; \u00e2\u0080\u009cand I paint a little,\nin the morning.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThen, in a feverish voice, he briefly related the story of his marriage,\nand explained his future plans. His friend observed him with an air\nof astonishment that troubled and alarmed him. The truth was that the\npainter no longer found in the husband of Therese, the coarse, common\nfellow he had known formerly. It seemed to him that Laurent was\nacquiring a gentlemanly bearing; his face had grown thinner, and had\ntaken the pale tint of good taste, while his whole frame looked more\nupright and supple.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut you are becoming a handsome chap,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the artist could not refrain\nfrom exclaiming. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou are dressed like an ambassador, in the latest\nstyle. Who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s your model?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nLaurent, who felt the weight of the examination he was undergoing, did\nnot dare to abruptly take himself off.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWill you come up to my studio for a moment?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he at last asked his\nfriend, who showed no signs of leaving him.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWillingly,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered the latter.\n\nThe painter, who could not understand the change he noticed in his old\ncomrade, was anxious to visit his studio. He had no idea of climbing\nfive floors to gaze on the new pictures of Laurent, which assuredly\nwould disgust him; he merely wished to satisfy his curiosity.\n\nWhen he had reached the studio, and had glanced at the canvases hanging\nagainst the walls, his astonishment redoubled. They comprised five\nstudies, two heads of women, and three of men painted with real vigour.\nThey looked thick and substantial, each part being dashed off with\nmagnificent dabs of colour on a clear grey background. The artist\nquickly approached, and was so astounded that he did not even seek to\nconceal his amazement.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDid you do those?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he inquired of Laurent.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied the latter. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey are studies that I intend to utilise in\na large picture I am preparing.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCome, no humbug, are you really the author of those things?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cEh! Yes. Why should I not be the author of them?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe painter did not like to answer what he thought, which was as\nfollows:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBecause those canvases are the work of an artist, and you have never\nbeen anything but a vile bungler.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nFor a long time, he remained before the studies in silence. Certainly\nthey were clumsy, but they were original, and so powerfully executed\nthat they indicated a highly developed idea of art. They were life-like.\nNever had this friend of Laurent seen rough painting so full of high\npromise. When he had examined all the canvases, he turned to the author\nof them and said:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, frankly, I should never have thought you capable of painting like\nthat. Where the deuce did you learn to have talent? It is not usually a\nthing that one acquires.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd he considered Laurent, whose voice appeared to him more gentle,\nwhile every gesture he made had a sort of elegance. The artist had\nno idea of the frightful shock this man had received, and which had\ntransformed him, developing in him the nerves of a woman, along with\nkeen, delicate sensations. No doubt a strange phenomenon had been\naccomplished in the organism of the murderer of Camille. It is difficult\nfor analysis to penetrate to such depths. Laurent had, perhaps, become\nan artist as he had become afraid, after the great disorder that had\nupset his frame and mind.\n\nPreviously, he had been half choked by the fulness of his blood, blinded\nby the thick vapour of breath surrounding him. At present, grown\nthin, and always shuddering, his manner had become anxious, while he\nexperienced the lively and poignant sensations of a man of nervous\ntemperament. In the life of terror that he led, his mind had grown\ndelirious, ascending to the ecstasy of genius. The sort of moral malady,\nthe neurosis wherewith all his being was agitated, had developed an\nartistic feeling of peculiar lucidity. Since he had killed, his frame\nseemed lightened, his distracted mind appeared to him immense; and, in\nthis abrupt expansion of his thoughts, he perceived exquisite creations,\nthe reveries of a poet passing before his eyes. It was thus that his\ngestures had suddenly become elegant, that his works were beautiful, and\nwere all at once rendered true to nature, and life-like.\n\nThe friend did not seek further to fathom the mystery attending this\nbirth of the artist. He went off carrying his astonishment along with\nhim. But before he left, he again gazed at the canvases and said to\nLaurent:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI have only one thing to reproach you with: all these studies have\na family likeness. The five heads resemble each other. The women,\nthemselves, have a peculiarly violent bearing that gives them the\nappearance of men in disguise. You will understand that if you desire\nto make a picture out of these studies, you must change some of the\nphysiognomies; your personages cannot all be brothers, or brothers and\nsisters, it would excite hilarity.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe left the studio, and on the landing merrily added:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cReally, my dear boy, I am very pleased to have seen you. Henceforth, I\nshall believe in miracles. Good heavens! How highly respectable you do\nlook!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAs he went downstairs, Laurent returned to the studio, feeling very much\nupset. When his friend had remarked that all his studies of heads bore\na family likeness, he had abruptly turned round to conceal his paleness.\nThe fact was that he had already been struck by this fatal resemblance.\nSlowly entering the room, he placed himself before the pictures, and\nas he contemplated them, as he passed from one to the other, ice-like\nperspiration moistened his back.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe is quite right,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he murmured, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthey all resemble one another. They\nresemble Camille.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe retired a step or two, and seated himself on the divan, unable to\nremove his eyes from the studies of heads. The first was an old man with\na long white beard; and under this white beard, the artist traced the\nlean chin of Camille. The second represented a fair young girl, who\ngazed at him with the blue eyes of his victim. Each of the other three\nfaces presented a feature of the drowned man. It looked like Camille\nwith the theatrical make-up of an old man, of a young girl, assuming\nwhatever disguise it pleased the painter to give him, but still\nmaintaining the general expression of his own countenance.\n\nThere existed another terrible resemblance among these heads: they all\nappeared suffering and terrified, and seemed as though overburdened with\nthe same feeling of horror. Each of them had a slight wrinkle to the\nleft of the mouth, which drawing down the lips, produced a grimace. This\nwrinkle, which Laurent remembered having noticed on the convulsed face\nof the drowned man, marked them all with a sign of vile relationship.\n\nLaurent understood that he had taken too long a look at Camille at the\nMorgue. The image of the drowned man had become deeply impressed on his\nmind; and now, his hand, without his being conscious of it, never failed\nto draw the lines of this atrocious face which followed him everywhere.\n\nLittle by little, the painter, who was allowing himself to fall back\non the divan, fancied he saw the faces become animated. He had five\nCamilles before him, five Camilles whom his own fingers had powerfully\ncreated, and who, by terrifying peculiarity were of various ages and of\nboth sexes. He rose, he lacerated the pictures and threw them outside.\nHe said to himself that he would die of terror in his studio, were he to\npeople it with portraits of his victim.\n\nA fear had just come over him: he dreaded that he would no more be able\nto draw a head without reproducing that of the drowned man. He wished to\nascertain, at once, whether he were master of his own hand. He placed a\nwhite canvas on his easel; and, then, with a bit of charcoal, sketched\nout a face in a few lines. The face resembled Camille. Laurent swiftly\neffaced this drawing and tried another.\n\nFor an hour he struggled against futility, which drove along his\nfingers. At each fresh attempt, he went back to the head of the drowned\nman. He might indeed assert his will, and avoid the lines he knew so\nwell. In spite of himself, he drew those lines, he obeyed his muscles\nand his rebellious nerves. He had first of all proceeded rapidly with\nhis sketches; he now took pains to pass the stick of charcoal slowly\nover the canvas. The result was the same: Camille, grimacing and in\npain, appeared ceaselessly.\n\nThe artist sketched the most different heads successively: the heads of\nangels, of virgins with aureoles, of Roman warriors with their helmets,\nof fair, rosy children, of old bandits seamed with scars; and the\ndrowned man always, always reappeared; he became, in turn, angel,\nvirgin, warrior, child and bandit.\n\nThen, Laurent plunged into caricature: he exaggerated the features,\nhe produced monstrous profiles, he invented grotesque heads, but\nonly succeeded in rendering the striking portrait of his victim more\nhorrible. He finished by drawing animals, dogs and cats; but even the\ndogs and cats vaguely resembled Camille.\n\nLaurent then became seized with sullen rage. He smashed the canvas with\nhis fist, thinking in despair of his great picture. Now, he must put\nthat idea aside; he was convinced that, in future, he would draw nothing\nbut the head of Camille, and as his friend had told him, faces all alike\nwould cause hilarity. He pictured to himself what his work would have\nbeen, and perceived upon the shoulders of his personages, men and women,\nthe livid and terrified face of the drowned man. The strange picture he\nthus conjured up, appeared to him atrociously ridiculous and exasperated\nhim.\n\nHe no longer dared to paint, always dreading that he would resuscitate\nhis victim at the least stroke of his brush. If he desired to live\npeacefully in his studio he must never paint there. This thought that\nhis fingers possessed the fatal and unconscious faculty of reproducing\nwithout end the portrait of Camille, made him observe his hand in\nterror. It seemed to him that his hand no longer belonged to him.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVI\n\nThe crisis threatening Madame Raquin took place. The paralysis, which\nfor several months had been creeping along her limbs, always ready to\nstrangle her, at last took her by the throat and linked her body. One\nevening, while conversing peacefully with Therese and Laurent, she\nremained in the middle of a sentence with her mouth wide open: she felt\nas if she was being throttled. When she wanted to cry out and call for\nhelp, she could only splutter a few hoarse sounds. Her hands and feet\nwere rigid. She found herself struck dumb, and powerless to move.\n\nTherese and Laurent rose from their chairs, terrified at this stroke,\nwhich had contorted the old mercer in less than five seconds. When she\nbecame rigid, and fixed her supplicating eyes on them, they pressed her\nwith questions in order to ascertain the cause of her suffering. Unable\nto reply, she continued gazing at them in profound anguish.\n\nThey then understood that they had nothing but a corpse before them, a\ncorpse half alive that could see and hear, but could not speak to them.\nThey were in despair at this attack. At the bottom of their hearts, they\ncared little for the suffering of the paralysed woman. They mourned over\nthemselves, who in future would have to live alone, face to face.\n\nFrom this day the life of the married couple became intolerable. They\npassed the most cruel evenings opposite the impotent old lady, who no\nlonger lulled their terror with her gentle, idle chatter. She reposed in\nan armchair, like a parcel, a thing, while they remained alone, one\nat each end of the table, embarrassed and anxious. This body no longer\nseparated them; at times they forgot it, confounding it with the\narticles of furniture.\n\nThey were now seized with the same terror as at night. The dining-room\nbecame, like the bedroom, a terrible spot, where the spectre of Camille\narose, causing them to suffer an extra four or five hours daily. As soon\nas twilight came, they shuddered, lowering the lamp-shade so as not to\nsee one another, and endeavouring to persuade themselves that Madame\nRaquin was about to speak and thus remind them of her presence. If they\nkept her with them, if they did not get rid of her, it was because her\neyes were still alive, and they experienced a little relief in watching\nthem move and sparkle.\n\nThey always placed the impotent old lady in the bright beam of the lamp,\nso as to thoroughly light up her face and have it always before them.\nThis flabby, livid countenance would have been a sight that others\ncould not have borne, but Therese and Laurent experienced such need for\ncompany, that they gazed upon it with real joy.\n\nThis face looked like that of a dead person in the centre of which two\nliving eyes had been fixed. These eyes alone moved, rolling rapidly in\ntheir orbits. The cheeks and mouth maintained such appalling immobility\nthat they seemed as though petrified. When Madame Raquin fell asleep and\nlowered her lids, her countenance, which was then quite white and mute,\nwas really that of a corpse. Therese and Laurent, who no longer felt\nanyone with them, then made a noise until the paralysed woman raised her\neyelids and looked at them. In this manner they compelled her to remain\nawake.\n\nThey regarded her as a distraction that drew them from their bad dreams.\nSince she had been infirm, they had to attend to her like a child. The\ncare they lavished on her forced them to scatter their thoughts. In the\nmorning Laurent lifted her up and bore her to her armchair; at night he\nplaced her on her bed again. She was still heavy, and he had to exert\nall his strength to raise her delicately in his arms, and carry her. It\nwas also he who rolled her armchair along. The other attentions fell\nto Therese. She dressed and fed the impotent old lady, and sought to\nunderstand her slightest wish.\n\nFor a few days Madame Raquin preserved the use of her hands. She could\nwrite on a slate, and in this way asked for what she required; then the\nhands withered, and it became impossible for her to raise them or hold\na pencil. From that moment her eyes were her only language, and it\nwas necessary for her niece to guess what she desired. The young\nwoman devoted herself to the hard duties of sick-nurse, which gave her\noccupation for body and mind that did her much good.\n\nSo as not to remain face to face, the married couple rolled the armchair\nof the poor old lady into the dining-room, the first thing in the\nmorning. They placed her between them, as if she were necessary to their\nexistence. They caused her to be present at their meals, and at all\ntheir interviews. When she signified the desire to retire to her\nbedroom, they feigned not to understand. She was only of use to\ninterrupt their private conversations, and had no right to live apart.\n\nAt eight o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock, Laurent went to his studio, Therese descended to the\nshop, while the paralyzed woman remained alone in the dining-room until\nnoon; then, after lunch, she found herself without company again until\nsix o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock. Frequently, during the day, her niece ran upstairs, and,\nhovering round her, made sure she did not require anything. The friends\nof the family were at a loss for sufficiently laudatory phrases wherein\nto extol the virtues of Therese and Laurent.\n\nThe Thursday receptions continued, the impotent old lady being present,\nas in the past. Her armchair was advanced to the table, and from eight\no\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock till eleven she kept her eyes open, casting penetrating glances\nfrom one to another of her guests in turn. On the first few of these\nevenings, old Michaud and Grivet felt some embarrassment in the presence\nof the corpse of their old friend. They did not know what countenance to\nput on. They only experienced moderate sorrow, and they were inquiring\nin their minds in what measure it would be suitable to display their\ngrief. Should they speak to this lifeless form? Should they refrain\nfrom troubling about it? Little by little, they decided to treat Madame\nRaquin as though nothing had happened to her. They ended by feigning\nto completely ignore her condition. They chatted with her, putting\nquestions and giving the answers, laughing both for her and for\nthemselves, and never permitting the rigid expression on the countenance\nto baffle them.\n\nIt was a strange sight: these men who appeared to be speaking sensibly\nto a statue, just as little girls talk to their dolls. The paralysed\nwoman sat rigid and mute before them, while they babbled, multiplying\ntheir gestures in exceedingly animated conversations with her. Michaud\nand Grivet prided themselves on their correct attitude. In acting as\nthey did, they believed they were giving proof of politeness; they,\nmoreover, avoided the annoyance of the customary condolences. They\nfancied that Madame Raquin must feel flattered to find herself treated\nas a person in good health; and, from that moment, it became possible\nfor them to be merry in her presence, without the least scruple.\n\nGrivet had contracted a mania. He affirmed that Madame Raquin and\nhimself understood one another perfectly; and that she could not look at\nhim without him at once comprehending what she desired. This was another\ndelicate attention. Only Grivet was on every occasion in error. He\nfrequently interrupted the game of dominoes, to observe the infirm woman\nwhose eyes were quietly following the game, and declare that she wanted\nsuch or such a thing. On further inquiry it was found that she wanted\nnothing at all, or that she wanted something entirely different. This\ndid not discourage Grivet, who triumphantly exclaimed:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cJust as I said!\u00e2\u0080\u009d And he began again a few moments later.\n\nIt was quite another matter when the impotent old lady openly expressed\na desire; Therese, Laurent, and the guests named one object after\nanother that they fancied she might wish for. Grivet then made himself\nremarkable by the clumsiness of his offers. He mentioned, haphazard,\neverything that came into his head, invariably offering the contrary to\nwhat Madame Raquin desired. But this circumstance did not prevent him\nrepeating:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI can read in her eyes as in a book. Look, she says I am right. Is it\nnot so, dear lady? Yes, yes.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nNevertheless, it was no easy matter to grasp the wishes of the poor old\nwoman. Therese alone possessed this faculty. She communicated fairly\nwell with this walled-up brain, still alive, but buried in a lifeless\nframe. What was passing within this wretched creature, just sufficiently\nalive to be present at the events of life, without taking part in them?\nShe saw and heard, she no doubt reasoned in a distinct and clear\nmanner. But she was without gesture and voice to express the thoughts\noriginating in her mind. Her ideas were perhaps choking her, and yet\nshe could not raise a hand, nor open her mouth, even though one of her\nmovements or words should decide the destiny of the world.\n\nHer mind resembled those of the living buried by mistake, who awaken\nin the middle of the night in the earth, three or four yards below the\nsurface of the ground. They shout, they struggle, and people pass over\nthem without hearing their atrocious lamentations.\n\nLaurent frequently gazed at Madame Raquin, his lips pressed together,\nhis hands stretched out on his knees, putting all his life into his\nsparkling and swiftly moving eyes. And he said to himself:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWho knows what she may be thinking of all alone? Some cruel drama must\nbe passing within this inanimate frame.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nLaurent made a mistake. Madame Raquin was happy, happy at the care and\naffection bestowed on her by her dear children. She had always dreamed\nof ending in this gentle way, amidst devotedness and caresses. Certainly\nshe would have been pleased to have preserved her speech, so as to be\nable to thank the friends who assisted her to die in peace. But she\naccepted her condition without rebellion. The tranquil and retired\nlife she had always led, the sweetness of her character, prevented her\nfeeling too acutely the suffering of being mute and unable to make a\nmovement. She had entered second childhood. She passed days without\nweariness, gazing before her, and musing on the past. She even tasted\nthe charm of remaining very good in her armchair, like a little girl.\n\nEach day the sweetness and brightness of her eyes became more\npenetrating. She had reached the point of making them perform the duties\nof a hand or mouth, in asking for what she required and in expressing\nher thanks. In this way she replaced the organs that were wanting, in a\nmost peculiar and charming manner. Her eyes, in the centre of her flabby\nand grimacing face, were of celestial beauty.\n\nSince her twisted and inert lips could no longer smile, she smiled with\nadorable tenderness, by her looks; moist beams and rays of dawn issued\nfrom her orbits. Nothing was more peculiar than those eyes which laughed\nlike lips in this lifeless countenance. The lower part of the face\nremained gloomy and wan, while the upper part was divinely lit up.\nIt was particularly for her beloved children that she placed all her\ngratitude, all the affection of her soul into a simple glance. When\nLaurent took her in his arms, morning and night, to carry her, she\nthanked him lovingly by looks full of tender effusion.\n\nShe lived thus for weeks, awaiting death, fancying herself sheltered\nfrom any fresh misfortune. She thought she had already received her\nshare of suffering. But she was mistaken. One night she was crushed by a\nfrightful blow.\n\nTherese and Laurent might well place her between them, in the full\nlight, but she was no longer sufficiently animated to separate and\ndefend them against their anguish. When they forgot that she was there\nand could hear and see them, they were seized with folly. Perceiving\nCamille, they sought to drive him away. Then, in unsteady tones,\nthey allowed the truth to escape them, uttering words that revealed\neverything to Madame Raquin. Laurent had a sort of attack, during\nwhich he spoke like one under the influence of hallucination, and the\nparalysed woman abruptly understood.\n\nA frightful contraction passed over her face, and she experienced such\na shock that Therese thought she was about to bound to her feet and\nshriek, but she fell backward, rigid as iron. This shock was all the\nmore terrible as it seemed to galvanise a corpse. Sensibility which had\nfor a moment returned, disappeared; the impotent woman remained more\ncrushed and wan than before. Her eyes, usually so gentle, had become\ndark and harsh, resembling pieces of metal.\n\nNever had despair fallen more rigorously on a being. The sinister truth,\nlike a flash of flame, scorched the eyes of the paralysed woman and\npenetrated within her with the concussion of a shaft of lightning. Had\nshe been able to rise, to utter the cry of horror that ascended to her\nthroat, and curse the murderers of her son, she would have suffered\nless. But, after hearing and understanding everything, she was forced\nto remain motionless and mute, inwardly preserving all the glare of her\ngrief.\n\nIt seemed to her that Therese and Laurent had bound her, riveted her to\nher armchair to prevent her springing up, and that they took atrocious\npleasure in repeating to her, after gagging her to stifle her cries--\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe have killed Camille!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nTerror and anguish coursed furiously in her body unable to find an\nissue. She made superhuman efforts to raise the weight crushing her, to\nclear her throat and thus give passage to her flood of despair. In vain\ndid she strain her final energy; she felt her tongue cold against her\npalate, she could not tear herself from death. Cadaverous impotence held\nher rigid. Her sensations resembled those of a man fallen into lethargy,\nwho is being buried, and who, bound by the bonds of his own frame, hears\nthe deadened sound of the shovels of mould falling on his head.\n\nThe ravages to which her heart was subjected, proved still more\nterrible. She felt a blow inwardly that completely undid her. Her\nentire life was afflicted: all her tenderness, all her goodness, all her\ndevotedness had just been brutally upset and trampled under foot. She\nhad led a life of affection and gentleness, and in her last hours, when\nabout to carry to the grave a belief in the delight of a calm life, a\nvoice shouted to her that all was falsehood and all crime.\n\nThe veil being rent, she perceived apart from the love and friendship\nwhich was all she had hitherto been able to see, a frightful picture of\nblood and shame. She would have cursed the Almighty had she been able to\nshout out a blasphemy. Providence had deceived her for over sixty years,\nby treating her as a gentle, good little girl, by amusing her with\nlying representations of tranquil joy. And she had remained a child,\nsenselessly believing in a thousand silly things, and unable to see life\nas it really is, dragging along in the sanguinary filth of passions.\nProvidence was bad; it should have told her the truth before, or have\nallowed her to continue in her innocence and blindness. Now, it only\nremained for her to die, denying love, denying friendship, denying\ndevotedness. Nothing existed but murder and lust.\n\nWhat! Camille had been killed by Therese and Laurent, and they had\nconceived the crime in shame! For Madame Raquin, there was such a\nfathomless depth in this thought, that she could neither reason it\nout, nor grasp it clearly. She experienced but one sensation, that of\na horrible disaster; it seemed to her that she was falling into a dark,\ncold hole. And she said to herself:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI shall be smashed to pieces at the bottom.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAfter the first shock, the crime appeared to her so monstrous that it\nseemed impossible. Then, when convinced of the misbehaviour and murder,\nby recalling certain little incidents which she had formerly failed to\nunderstand, she was afraid of going out of her mind. Therese and Laurent\nwere really the murderers of Camille: Therese whom she had reared,\nLaurent whom she had loved with the devoted and tender affection of\na mother. These thoughts revolved in her head like an immense wheel,\naccompanied by a deafening noise.\n\nShe conjectured such vile details, fathomed such immense hypocrisy,\nassisting in thought at a double vision so atrocious in irony, that she\nwould have liked to die, mechanical and implacable, pounded her brain\nwith the weight and ceaseless action of a millstone. She repeated to\nherself:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is my children who have killed my child.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd she could think of nothing else to express her despair.\n\nIn the sudden change that had come over her heart, she no longer\nrecognised herself. She remained weighed down by the brutal invasion of\nideas of vengeance that drove away all the goodness of her life. When\nshe had been thus transformed, all was dark inwardly; she felt the birth\nof a new being within her frame, a being pitiless and cruel, who would\nhave liked to bite the murderers of her son.\n\nWhen she had succumbed to the overwhelming stroke of paralysis, when she\nunderstood that she could not fly at the throats of Therese and Laurent,\nwhom she longed to strangle, she resigned herself to silence and\nimmobility, and great tears fell slowly from her eyes. Nothing could\nbe more heartrending than this mute and motionless despair. Those tears\ncoursing, one by one, down this lifeless countenance, not a wrinkle\nof which moved, that inert, wan face which could not weep with its\nfeatures, and whose eyes alone sobbed, presented a poignant spectacle.\n\nTherese was seized with horrified pity.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe must put her to bed,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said she to Laurent, pointing to her aunt.\n\nLaurent hastened to roll the paralysed woman into her bedroom. Then, as\nhe stooped down to take her in his arms, Madame Raquin hoped that some\npowerful spring would place her on her feet; and she attempted a supreme\neffort. The Almighty would not permit Laurent to press her to his bosom;\nshe fully anticipated he would be struck down if he displayed such\nmonstrous impudence. But no spring came into action, and heaven reserved\nits lightning. Madame Raquin remained huddled up and passive like\na bundle of linen. She was grasped, raised and carried along by the\nassassin; she experienced the anguish of feeling herself feeble and\nabandoned in the arms of the murderer of Camille. Her head rolled on to\nthe shoulder of Laurent, whom she observed with eyes increased in volume\nby horror.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou may look at me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he murmured. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYour eyes will not eat me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd he cast her brutally on the bed. The impotent old lady fell\nunconscious on the mattress. Her last thought had been one of terror and\ndisgust. In future, morning and night, she would have to submit to the\nvile pressure of the arms of Laurent.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVII\n\nA shock of terror alone had made the married pair speak, and avow their\ncrime in the presence of Madame Raquin. Neither one nor the other was\ncruel; they would have avoided such a revelation out of feelings of\nhumanity, had not their own security already made it imperative on their\npart to maintain silence.\n\nOn the ensuing Thursday, they felt particularly anxious. In the morning,\nTherese inquired of Laurent whether he considered it prudent to leave\nthe paralysed woman in the dining-room during the evening. She knew all\nand might give the alarm.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBah!\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied Laurent, \u00e2\u0080\u009cit is impossible for her to raise her little\nfinger. How can she babble?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cShe will perhaps discover a way to do so,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Therese. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI have\nnoticed an implacable thought in her eyes since the other evening.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Laurent. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou see, the doctor told me it was absolutely\nall over with her. If she ever speaks again it will be in the final\ndeath-rattle. She will not last much longer, you may be sure. It would\nbe stupid to place an additional load on our conscience by preventing\nher being present at the gathering this evening.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nTherese shuddered.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou misunderstand me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she exclaimed. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOh! You are right. There has\nbeen enough crime. I meant to say that we might shut our aunt up in her\nown room, pretending she was not well, and was sleeping.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied Laurent, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand that idiot Michaud would go straight\ninto the room to see his old friend, notwithstanding. It would be a\ncapital way to ruin us.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe hesitated. He wanted to appear calm, and anxiety gave a tremor to his\nvoice.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt will be best to let matters take their course,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he continued. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThese\npeople are as silly as geese. The mute despair of the old woman will\ncertainly teach them nothing. They will never have the least suspicion\nof the thing, for they are too far away from the truth. Once the ordeal\nis over, we shall be at ease as to the consequences of our imprudence.\nAll will be well, you will see.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWhen the guests arrived in the evening, Madame Raquin occupied her usual\nplace, between the stove and table. Therese and Laurent feigned to be\nin good spirits, concealing their shudders and awaiting, in anguish, the\nincident that was bound to occur. They had brought the lamp-shade very\nlow down, so that the oilcloth table covering alone was lit up.\n\nThe guests engaged in the usual noisy, common-place conversation that\ninvariably preceded the first game of dominoes. Grivet and Michaud did\nnot fail to address the usual questions to the paralysed woman, on the\nsubject of her health, and to give excellent answers to them, as was\ntheir custom. After which, the company, without troubling any further\nabout the poor old lady, plunged with delight into the game.\n\nSince Madame Raquin had become aware of the horrible secret, she had\nbeen awaiting this evening with feverish impatience. She had gathered\ntogether all her remaining strength to denounce the culprits. Up to the\nlast moment, she feared she would not be present at the gathering; she\nthought Laurent would make her disappear, perhaps kill her, or at least\nshut her up in her own apartment. When she saw that her niece and nephew\nallowed her to remain in the dining-room, she experienced lively joy at\nthe thought of attempting to avenge her son.\n\nAware that her tongue was powerless, she resorted to a new kind of\nlanguage. With astonishing power of will, she succeeded, in a measure,\nin galvanising her right hand, in slightly raising it from her knee,\nwhere it always lay stretched out, inert; she then made it creep little\nby little up one of the legs of the table before her, and thus succeeded\nin placing it on the oilcloth table cover. Then, she feebly agitated the\nfingers as if to attract attention.\n\nWhen the players perceived this lifeless hand, white and nerveless,\nbefore them, they were exceedingly surprised. Grivet stopped short,\nwith his arm in the air, at the moment when he was about to play the\ndouble-six. Since the impotent woman had been struck down, she had never\nmoved her hands.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHey! Just look, Therese,\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried Michaud. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMadame Raquin is agitating\nher fingers. She probably wants something.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nTherese could not reply. Both she and Laurent had been following the\nexertion of the paralysed woman, and she was now looking at the hand\nof her aunt, which stood out wan in the raw light of the lamp, like\nan avenging hand that was about to speak. The two murderers waited,\nbreathless.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOf course,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Grivet, \u00e2\u0080\u009cshe wants something. Oh! We thoroughly\nunderstand one another. She wants to play dominoes. Eh! Isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t it so,\ndear lady?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMadame Raquin made a violent sign indicating that she wanted nothing of\nthe kind. She extended one finger, folded up the others with infinite\ndifficulty, and began to painfully trace letters on the table cover.\nShe had barely indicated a stroke or two, when Grivet again exclaimed in\ntriumph:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI understand; she says I do right to play the double-six.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe impotent woman cast a terrible glance at the old clerk, and returned\nto the word she wished to write. But Grivet interrupted her at every\nmoment, declaring it was needless, that he understood, and he then\nbrought out some stupidity. Michaud at last made him hold his tongue.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe deuce! Allow Madame Raquin to speak,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSpeak, my old\nfriend.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd he gazed at the oilcloth table cover as if he had been listening.\nBut the fingers of the paralysed woman were growing weary. They had\nbegun the word more than ten times over, and now, in tracing this word,\nthey wandered to right and left. Michaud and Olivier bent forward, and\nbeing unable to read, forced the impotent old lady to resume the first\nletters.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAh! Bravo!\u00e2\u0080\u009d exclaimed Olivier, all at once, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI can read it, this time.\nShe has just written your name, Therese. Let me see: \u00e2\u0080\u0098_Therese and_----\u00e2\u0080\u0099\nComplete the sentence, dear lady.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nTherese almost shrieked in anguish. She watched the finger of her aunt\ngliding over the oilcloth, and it seemed to her that this finger traced\nher name, and the confession of her crime in letters of fire. Laurent\nhad risen violently, with half a mind to fling himself on the paralysed\nwoman and break her arm. When he saw this hand return to life to reveal\nthe murder of Camille, he thought all was lost, and already felt the\nweight and frigidity of the knife on the nape of his neck.\n\nMadame Raquin still wrote, but in a manner that became more and more\nhesitating.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is perfect. I can read it very well indeed,\u00e2\u0080\u009d resumed Olivier after\nan instant, and with his eyes on the married pair. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYour aunt writes\nyour two names: \u00e2\u0080\u0098_Therese and Laurent_.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe old lady made sign after sign in the affirmative, casting crushing\nglances on the murderers. Then she sought to complete the sentence,\nbut her fingers had stiffened, the supreme will that galvanised them,\nescaped her. She felt the paralysis slowly descending her arm and again\ngrasping her wrist. She hurried on, and traced another word.\n\nOld Michaud read out in a loud voice:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009c_Therese and Laurent have----_\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd Olivier inquired:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat have your dear children?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe murderers, seized with blind terror, were on the point of completing\nthe sentence aloud. They contemplated the avenging hand with fixed\nand troubled eyes, when, all at once this hand became convulsed, and\nflattened out on the table. It slipped down and fell on the knee of the\nimpotent woman like a lump of inanimate flesh and bone. The paralysis\nhad returned and arrested the punishment. Michaud and Olivier sat down\nagain disappointed, while Therese and Laurent experienced such keen joy\nthat they felt like fainting under the influence of the sudden rush of\nblood that beat in their bosoms.\n\nGrivet who felt vexed at not having been believed on trust, thought\nthe moment had arrived to regain his infallibility, by completing the\nunfinished sentence. While every one was endeavouring to supply the\nmissing words, he exclaimed:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is quite clear. I can read the whole phrase in the eyes of the lady.\nIt is not necessary for her to write on the table to make me understand;\na mere look suffices. She means to say:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTherese and Laurent have been very kind to me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nGrivet, on this occasion, had cause to be proud of his imagination, for\nall the company were of his opinion; and the guests began to sing the\npraises of the married couple, who were so good for the poor lady.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is certain,\u00e2\u0080\u009d old Michaud gravely remarked, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat Madame Raquin\nwishes to bear testimony to the tender affection her children lavish on\nher, and this does honour to the whole family.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThen, taking up his dominoes again, he added:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCome, let us continue. Where were we? Grivet was about to play the\ndouble-six, I think.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nGrivet played the double six, and the stupid, monotonous game went on.\n\nThe paralysed woman, cut up by frightful despair, looked at her hand,\nwhich had just betrayed her. She felt it as heavy as lead, now; never\nwould she be able to raise it again. Providence would not permit Camille\nto be avenged. It withdrew from his mother the only means she had of\nmaking known the crime to which he had fallen a victim. And the wretched\nwoman said to herself that she was now only fit to go and join her child\nunderground. She lowered her lids, feeling herself, henceforth, useless,\nand with the desire of imagining herself already in the darkness of the\ntomb.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVIII\n\nFor two months, Therese and Laurent had been struggling in the anguish\nof their union. One suffered through the other. Then hatred slowly\ngained them, and they ended by casting angry glances at one another,\nfull of secret menace.\n\nHatred was forced to come. They had loved like brutes, with hot passion,\nentirely sanguineous. Then, amidst the enervation of their crime, their\nlove had turned to fright, and their kisses had produced a sort of\nphysical terror. At present, amid the suffering which marriage, which\nlife in common imposed on them, they revolted and flew into anger.\n\nIt was a bitter hatred, with terrible outbursts. They felt they were in\nthe way of one another, and both inwardly said that they would lead a\ntranquil existence were they not always face to face. When in presence\nof each other, it seemed as if an enormous weight were stifling them,\nand they would have liked to remove this weight, to destroy it. Their\nlips were pinched, thoughts of violence passed in their clear eyes, and\na craving beset them to devour one another.\n\nIn reality, one single thought tormented them: they were irritated at\ntheir crime, and in despair at having for ever troubled their lives.\nHence all their anger and hatred. They felt the evil incurable, that\nthey would suffer for the murder of Camille until death, and this idea\nof perpetual suffering exasperated them. Not knowing whom to strike,\nthey turned in hatred on one another.\n\nThey would not openly admit that their marriage was the final punishment\nof the murder; they refused to listen to the inner voice that shouted\nout the truth to them, displaying the story of their life before their\neyes. And yet, in the fits of rage that bestirred them, they both saw\nclearly to the bottom of their anger, they were aware it was the furious\nimpulse of their egotistic nature that had urged them to murder in order\nto satisfy their desire, and that they had only found in assassination,\nan afflicted and intolerable existence. They recollected the past, they\nknew that their mistaken hopes of lust and peaceful happiness had alone\nbrought them to remorse. Had they been able to embrace one another in\npeace, and live in joy, they would not have mourned Camille, they would\nhave fattened on their crime. But their bodies had rebelled, refusing\nmarriage, and they inquired of themselves, in terror, where horror and\ndisgust would lead them. They only perceived a future that would be\nhorrible in pain, with a sinister and violent end.\n\nThen, like two enemies bound together, and who were making violent\nefforts to release themselves from this forced embrace, they strained\ntheir muscles and nerves, stiffening their limbs without succeeding in\nreleasing themselves. At last understanding that they would never be\nable to escape from their clasp, irritated by the cords cutting into\ntheir flesh, disgusted at their contact, feeling their discomfort\nincrease at every moment, forgetful, and unable to bear their bonds a\nmoment longer, they addressed outrageous reproaches to one another, in\nthe hope of suffering loss, of dressing the wounds they inflicted on\nthemselves, by cursing and deafening each other with their shouts and\naccusations.\n\nA quarrel broke out every evening. It looked as though the murderers\nsought opportunities to become exasperated so as to relax their rigid\nnerves. They watched one another, sounded one another with glances,\nexamined the wounds of one another, discovering the raw parts, and\ntaking keen pleasure in causing each other to yell in pain. They lived\nin constant irritation, weary of themselves, unable to support a word, a\ngesture or a look, without suffering and frenzy. Both their beings\nwere prepared for violence; the least display of impatience, the\nmost ordinary contrariety increased immoderately in their disordered\norganism, and all at once, took the form of brutality. A mere nothing\nraised a storm that lasted until the morrow. A plate too warm, an open\nwindow, a denial, a simple observation, sufficed to drive them into\nregular fits of madness.\n\nIn the course of the discussion, they never failed to bring up the\nsubject of the drowned man. From sentence to sentence they came to\nmutual reproaches about this drowning business at Saint-Ouen, casting\nthe crime in the face of one another. They grew excited to the pitch\nof fury, until one felt like murdering the other. Then ensued atrocious\nscenes of choking, blows, abominable cries, shameless brutalities. As a\nrule, Therese and Laurent became exasperated, in this manner, after the\nevening meal. They shut themselves up in the dining-room, so that the\nsound of their despair should not be heard. There, they could devour\none another at ease. At the end of this damp apartment, of this sort of\nvault, lighted by the yellow beams of the lamp, the tone of their voices\ntook harrowing sharpness, amidst the silence and tranquillity of the\natmosphere. And they did not cease until exhausted with fatigue; then\nonly could they go and enjoy a few hours\u00e2\u0080\u0099 rest. Their quarrels became,\nin a measure, necessary to them--a means of procuring a few hours\u00e2\u0080\u0099 rest\nby stupefying their nerves.\n\nMadame Raquin listened. She never ceased to be there, in her armchair,\nher hands dangling on her knees, her head straight, her face mute. She\nheard everything, and not a shudder ran through her lifeless frame.\nHer eyes rested on the murderers with the most acute fixedness. Her\nmartyrdom must have been atrocious. She thus learned, detail by detail,\nall the events that had preceded and followed the murder of Camille.\nLittle by little her ears became polluted with an account of the filth\nand crimes of those whom she had called her children.\n\nThese quarrels of the married couple placed her in possession of the\nmost minute circumstances connected with the murder, and spread out,\none by one, before her terrified mind, all the episodes of the horrible\nadventure. As she went deeper into this sanguinary filth, she pleaded in\nher mind for mercy, at times, she fancied she was touching the bottom of\nthe infamy, and still she had to descend lower. Each night, she learnt\nsome new detail. The frightful story continued to expand before her.\nIt seemed like being lost in an interminable dream of horror. The first\navowal had been brutal and crushing, but she suffered more from these\nrepeated blows, from these small facts which the husband and wife\nallowed to escape them in their fits of anger, and which lit up the\ncrime with sinister rays. Once a day, this mother heard the account\nof the murder of her son; and, each day this account became more\nhorrifying, more replete with detail, and was shouted into her ears with\ngreater cruelty and uproar.\n\nOn one occasion, Therese, taken aback with remorse, at the sight of\nthis wan countenance, with great tears slowly coursing down its cheeks,\npointed out her aunt to Laurent, beseeching him with a look to hold his\ntongue.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, what of it? Leave me alone!\u00e2\u0080\u009d exclaimed the latter in a brutal\ntone, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou know very well that she cannot give us up. Am I more happy\nthan she is? We have her cash, I have no need to constrain myself.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe quarrel continued, bitter and piercing, and Camille was killed over\nagain. Neither Therese nor Laurent dared give way to the thoughts of\npity that sometimes came over them, and shut the paralysed woman in\nher bedroom, when they quarrelled, so as to spare her the story of the\ncrime. They were afraid of beating one another to death, if they failed\nto have this semi-corpse between them. Their pity yielded to cowardice.\nThey imposed ineffable sufferings on Madame Raquin because they required\nher presence to protect them against their hallucinations.\n\nAll their disputes were alike, and led to the same accusations. As soon\nas one of them accused the other of having killed this man, there came a\nfrightful shock.\n\nOne night, at dinner, Laurent who sought a pretext for becoming\nirritable, found that the water in the decanter was lukewarm. He\ndeclared that tepid water made him feel sick, and that he wanted it\nfresh.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI was unable to procure any ice,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Therese answered dryly.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cVery well, I will deprive myself of drinking,\u00e2\u0080\u009d retorted Laurent.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThis water is excellent,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said she.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is warm, and has a muddy taste,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he answered. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s like water from\nthe river.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWater from the river?\u00e2\u0080\u009d repeated Therese.\n\nAnd she burst out sobbing. A juncture of ideas had just occurred in her\nmind.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy do you cry?\u00e2\u0080\u009d asked Laurent, who foresaw the answer, and turned\npale.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI cry,\u00e2\u0080\u009d sobbed the young woman, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI cry because--you know why--Oh! Great\nGod! Great God! It was you who killed him.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou lie!\u00e2\u0080\u009d shouted the murderer vehemently, \u00e2\u0080\u009cconfess that you lie. If I\nthrew him into the Seine, it was you who urged me to commit the murder.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI! I!\u00e2\u0080\u009d she exclaimed.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, you! Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t act the ignorant,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he replied, \u00e2\u0080\u009cdon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t compel me to\nforce you to tell the truth. I want you to confess your crime, to take\nyour share in the murder. It will tranquillise and relieve me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut _I_ did not drown Camille,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she pleaded.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, you did, a thousand times yes!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he shouted. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOh! You feign\nastonishment and want of memory. Wait a moment, I will recall your\nrecollections.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nRising from table, he bent over the young woman, and with crimson\ncountenance, yelled in her face:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou were on the river bank, you remember, and I said to you in an\nundertone: \u00e2\u0080\u0098I am going to pitch him into the water.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Then you agreed to\nit, you got into the boat. You see that we murdered him together.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is not true,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she answered. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI was crazy, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know what I did,\nbut I never wanted to kill him. You alone committed the crime.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThese denials tortured Laurent. As he had said, the idea of having an\naccomplice relieved him. Had he dared, he would have attempted to prove\nto himself that all the horror of the murder fell upon Therese. He\nmore than once felt inclined to beat the young woman, so as to make her\nconfess that she was the more guilty of the two.\n\nHe began striding up and down, shouting and raving, followed by the\npiercing eyes of Madame Raquin.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAh! The wretch! The wretch!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he stammered in a choking voice, \u00e2\u0080\u009cshe\nwants to drive me mad. Look, did you not come up to my room one evening,\ndid you not intoxicate me with your caresses to persuade me to rid\nyou of your husband? You told me, when I visited you here, that he\ndispleased you, that he had the odour of a sickly child. Did I think\nof all this three years ago? Was I a rascal? I was leading the peaceful\nexistence of an upright man, doing no harm to anybody. I would not have\nkilled a fly.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt was you who killed Camille,\u00e2\u0080\u009d repeated Therese with such desperate\nobstinacy that she made Laurent lose his head.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, it was you, I say it was you,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he retorted with a terrible burst\nof rage. \u00e2\u0080\u009cLook here, don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t exasperate me, or if you do you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll suffer for\nit. What, you wretch, have you forgotten everything? You who maddened me\nwith your caresses! Confess that it was all a calculation in your mind,\nthat you hated Camille, and that you had wanted to kill him for a long\ntime. No doubt you took me as a sweetheart, so as to drive me to put an\nend to him.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is not true,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said she. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat you relate is monstrous. You have no\nright to reproach me with my weakness towards you. I can speak in regard\nto you, as you speak of me. Before I knew you, I was a good woman, who\nnever wronged a soul. If I drove you mad, it was you made me madder\nstill. Listen Laurent, don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t let us quarrel. I have too much to reproach\nyou with.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat can you reproach me with?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he inquired.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, nothing,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she answered. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou did not save me from myself, you took\nadvantage of my surrender, you chose to spoil my life. I forgive you\nall that. But, in mercy, do not accuse me of killing Camille. Keep your\ncrime for yourself. Do not seek to make me more terrified than I am\nalready.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nLaurent raised his hand to strike her in the face.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBeat me, I prefer that,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said she, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI shall suffer less.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd she advanced her head. But he restrained himself, and taking a\nchair, sat down beside her.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cListen,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he began in a voice that he endeavoured to render calm, \u00e2\u0080\u009cit is\ncowardly to refuse to take your share in the crime. You know perfectly\nwell that as we did the deed together, you know you are as guilty as I\nam. Why do you want to make my load heavier, by saying you are innocent?\nIf you were so, you would not have consented to marry me. Just recall\nwhat passed during the two years following the murder. Do you want a\nproof? If so I will go and relate everything to the Public Prosecutor,\nand you will see whether we are not both condemned.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThey shuddered, and Therese resumed:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMen may, perhaps, condemn me, but Camille knows very well that you did\neverything. He does not torment me at night as he does you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCamille leaves me in peace,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Laurent, pale and trembling, \u00e2\u0080\u009cit is\nyou who see him before you in your nightmares. I have heard you shout\nout.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t say that,\u00e2\u0080\u009d angrily exclaimed the young woman. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI have never\nshouted out. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t wish the spectre to appear. Oh! I understand, you\nwant to drive it away from yourself. I am innocent, I am innocent!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThey looked at one another in terror, exhausted with fatigue, fearing\nthey had evoked the corpse of the drowned man. Their quarrels invariably\nended in this way; they protested their innocence, they sought to\ndeceive themselves, so as to drive away their bad dreams. They made\nconstant efforts, each in turn, to reject the responsibility of the\ncrime, defending themselves as though they were before a judge and jury,\nand accusing one another.\n\nThe strangest part of this attitude was that they did not succeed in\nduping themselves by their oaths. Both had a perfect recollection of all\nthe circumstances connected with the murder, and their eyes avowed what\ntheir lips denied.\n\nTheir falsehoods were puerile, their affirmations ridiculous. It was the\nwordy dispute of two wretches who lied for the sake of lying, without\nsucceeding in concealing from themselves that they did so. Each took the\npart of accuser in turn, and although the prosecution they instituted\nagainst one another proved barren of result, they began it again every\nevening with cruel tenacity.\n\nThey were aware that they would prove nothing, that they would not\nsucceed in effacing the past, and still they attempted this task, still\nthey returned to the charge, spurred on by pain and terror, vanquished\nin advance by overwhelming reality. The sole advantage they derived from\ntheir disputes, consisted in producing a tempest of words and cries, and\nthe riot occasioned in this manner momentarily deafened them.\n\nAnd all the time their anger lasted, all the time they were accusing one\nanother, the paralysed woman never ceased to gaze at them. Ardent joy\nsparkled in her eyes, when Laurent raised his broad hand above the head\nof Therese.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIX\n\nMatters now took a different aspect. Therese, driven into a corner by\nfright, not knowing which way to turn for a consoling thought, began to\nweep aloud over the drowned man, in the presence of Laurent.\n\nShe abruptly became depressed, her overstrained nerves relaxed,\nher unfeeling and violent nature softened. She had already felt\ncompassionate in the early days of her second marriage, and this feeling\nnow returned, as a necessary and fatal reaction.\n\nWhen the young woman had struggled with all her nervous energy against\nthe spectre of Camille, when she had lived in sullen irritation for\nseveral months up in arms against her sufferings, seeking to get the\nbetter of them by efforts of will, she all at once experienced such\nextraordinary lassitude that she yielded vanquished. Then, having become\na woman again, even a little girl, no longer feeling the strength\nto stiffen herself, to stand feverishly erect before her terror, she\nplunged into pity, into tears and regret, in the hope of finding some\nrelief. She sought to reap advantage from her weakness of body and mind.\nPerhaps the drowned man, who had not given way to her irritation, would\nbe more unbending to her tears.\n\nHer remorse was all calculation. She thought that this would no doubt be\nthe best way to appease and satisfy Camille. Like certain devotees, who\nfancy they will deceive the Almighty, and secure pardon by praying\nwith their lips, and assuming the humble attitude of penitence, Therese\ndisplayed humility, striking her chest, finding words of repentance,\nwithout having anything at the bottom of her heart save fear and\ncowardice. Besides, she experienced a sort of physical pleasure in\ngiving way in this manner, in feeling feeble and undone, in abandoning\nherself to grief without resistance.\n\nShe overwhelmed Madame Raquin with her tearful despair. The paralysed\nwoman became of daily use to her. She served as a sort of praying-desk,\nas a piece of furniture in front of which Therese could fearlessly\nconfess her faults and plead for forgiveness. As soon as she felt\ninclined to cry, to divert herself by sobbing, she knelt before the\nimpotent old lady, and there, wailing and choking, performed to her\nalone a scene of remorse which weakened but relieved her.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI am a wretch,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she stammered, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI deserve no mercy. I deceived you, I\ndrove your son to his death. Never will you forgive me. And yet, if\nyou only knew how I am rent by remorse, if you only knew how I suffer,\nperhaps you would have pity. No, no pity for me. I should like to die\nhere at your feet, overwhelmed by shame and grief.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe spoke in this manner for hours together, passing from despair to\nhope, condemning and then pardoning herself; she assumed the voice,\nbrief and plaintive in turn, of a little sick girl; she flattened\nherself on the ground and drew herself up again, acting upon all the\nideas of humility and pride, of repentance and revolt that entered her\nhead. Sometimes even, forgetting she was on her knees before Madame\nRaquin, she continued her monologue as in a dream. When she had made\nherself thoroughly giddy with her own words, she rose staggering and\ndazed, to go down to the shop in a calmer frame of mind, no longer\nfearing to burst into sobs before her customers. When she again felt\ninclined for remorse, she ran upstairs and knelt at the feet of the\nimpotent woman. This scene was repeated ten times a day.\n\nTherese never reflected that her tears, and display of repentance must\nimpose ineffable anguish on her aunt. The truth was that if she had\ndesired to invent a torment to torture Madame Raquin, it would not have\nbeen possible to have found a more frightful one than the comedy of\nremorse she performed before her. The paralysed woman could see the\negotism concealed beneath these effusions of grief. She suffered\nhorribly from these long monologues which she was compelled to listen to\nat every instant, and which always brought the murder of Camille before\nher eyes. She could not pardon, she never departed from the implacable\nthought of vengeance that her impotency rendered more keen, and all day\nlong she had to listen to pleas for pardon, and to humble and cowardly\nprayers.\n\nShe would have liked to give an answer; certain sentences of her niece\nbrought crushing refusals to her lips, but she had to remain mute and\nallow Therese to plead her cause without once interrupting her.\nThe impossibility of crying out and stopping her ears caused her\ninexpressible torture. The words of the young woman entered her mind,\nslow and plaintive, as an irritating ditty. At first, she fancied the\nmurderers inflicted this kind of torture on her out of sheer diabolical\ncruelty. Her sole means of defence was to close her eyes, as soon as her\nniece knelt before her, then although she heard, she did not see her.\n\nTherese, at last, had the impudence to kiss her aunt. One day, in a fit\nof repentance, she feigned she had perceived a gleam of mercy in the\neyes of the paralysed woman; and she dragged herself along on her knees,\nshe raised herself up, exclaiming in a distracted tone:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou forgive me! You forgive me!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThen she kissed the forehead and cheeks of the poor old creature, who\nwas unable to throw her head backward so as to avoid the embrace. The\ncold skin on which Therese placed her lips, caused her violent disgust.\nShe fancied this disgust, like the tears of remorse, would be an\nexcellent remedy to appease her nerves; and she continued to kiss the\nimpotent old woman daily, by way of penitence, and also to relieve\nherself.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh! How good you are!\u00e2\u0080\u009d she sometimes exclaimed. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI can see my tears\nhave touched you. Your eyes are full of pity. I am saved.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThen she smothered her with caresses, placing the head of the infirm\nold lady on her knees, kissing her hands, smiling at her happily,\nand attending to all her requirements with a display of passionate\naffection. After a time, she believed in the reality of this comedy,\nshe imagined she had obtained the pardon of Madame Raquin, and spoke of\nnothing but the delight she experienced at having secured her pardon.\n\nThis was too much for the paralysed woman. It almost killed her. At the\nkisses of her niece, she again felt that sensation of bitter repugnance\nand rage which came over her, morning and night, when Laurent took her\nin his arms to lift her up, or lay her down. She was obliged to submit\nto the disgusting caresses of the wretch who had betrayed and killed her\nson. She could not even use her hand to wipe away the kisses that this\nwoman left on her cheeks; and, for hours and hours together, she felt\nthese kisses burning her.\n\nShe became the doll of the murderers of Camille, a doll that they\ndressed, that they turned to right and left, and that they made use of\naccording to their requirements and whims. She remained inert in their\nhands, as if she had been a lay-figure, and yet she lived, and became\nexcited and indignant at the least contact with Therese or Laurent.\n\nWhat particularly exasperated her was the atrocious mockery of the young\nwoman, who pretended she perceived expressions of mercy in her eyes,\nwhen she would have liked to have brought down fire from heaven on the\nhead of the criminal. She frequently made supreme efforts to utter a\ncry of protestation, and loaded her looks with hatred. But Therese, who\nfound it answered her purpose to repeat twenty times a day that she\nwas pardoned, redoubled her caresses, and would see nothing. So the\nparalysed woman had to accept the thanks and effusions that her heart\nrepelled. Henceforth, she lived in a state of bitter but powerless\nirritation, face to face with her yielding niece who displayed adorable\nacts of tenderness to recompense her for what she termed her heavenly\ngoodness.\n\nWhen Therese knelt before Madame Raquin, in the presence of her husband,\nhe brutally brought her to her feet.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo acting,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he. \u00e2\u0080\u009cDo I weep, do I prostrate myself? You do all this\nto trouble me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe remorse of Therese caused him peculiar agitation. His suffering\nincreased now that his accomplice dragged herself about him, with eyes\nred by weeping, and supplicating lips. The sight of this living example\nof regret redoubled his fright and added to his uneasiness. It was like\nan everlasting reproach wandering through the house. Then he feared that\nrepentance would one day drive his wife to reveal everything. He would\nhave preferred her to remain rigid and threatening, bitterly defending\nherself against his accusations. But she had changed her tactics. She\nnow readily recognised the share she had taken in the crime. She even\naccused herself. She had become yielding and timid, and starting from\nthis point implored redemption with ardent humility. This attitude\nirritated Laurent, and every evening the quarrels of the couple became\nmore afflicting and sinister.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cListen to me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Therese to her husband, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwe are very guilty. We\nmust repent if we wish to enjoy tranquillity. Look at me. Since I have\nbeen weeping I am more peaceable. Imitate me. Let us say together that\nwe are justly punished for having committed a horrible crime.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBah!\u00e2\u0080\u009d roughly answered Laurent, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou can say what you please. I know\nyou are deucedly clever and hypocritical. Weep, if that diverts you. But\nI must beg you not to worry me with your tears.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAh!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said she, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou are bad. You reject remorse. You are cowardly. You\nacted as a traitor to Camille.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDo you mean to say that I alone am guilty?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he inquired.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she replied, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI do not say that. I am guilty, more guilty than you\nare. I ought to have saved my husband from your hands. Oh! I am aware\nof all the horror of my fault. But I have sought pardon, and I have\nsucceeded, Laurent, whereas you continue to lead a disconsolate life.\nYou have not even had the feeling to spare my poor aunt the sight of\nyour vile anger. You have never even addressed a word of regret to her.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd she embraced Madame Raquin, who shut her eyes. She hovered round\nher, raising the pillow that propped up her head, and showing her all\nkinds of attention. Laurent was infuriated.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, leave her alone,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he cried. \u00e2\u0080\u009cCan\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you see that your services, and\nthe very sight of you are odious to her. If she could lift her hand she\nwould slap your face.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe slow and plaintive words of his wife, and her attitudes of\nresignation, gradually drove him into blinding fits of anger. He\nunderstood her tactics; she no longer wished to be at one with him, but\nto set herself apart wrapped in her regret, so as to escape the clasp\nof the drowned man. And, at moments, he said to himself that she had\nperhaps taken the right path, that tears might cure her of her terror,\nand he shuddered at the thought of having to suffer, and contend with\nfright alone.\n\nHe also would have liked to repent, or at least to have performed the\ncomedy of repentance, to see what effect it would have. Unable to find\nthe sobs and necessary words, he flung himself into violence again,\nstirring up Therese so as to irritate her and lead her back with him\nto furious madness. But the young woman took care to remain inert,\nto answer his cries of anger by tearful submission, and to meet his\ncoarseness by a proportionate display of humility and repentance.\nLaurent was thus gradually driven to fury. To crown his irritation,\nTherese always ended with the panegyric of Camille so as to display the\nvirtues of the victim.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe was good,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said she, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand we must have been very cruel to assail\nsuch a warm-hearted man who had never a bad thought.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe was good, yes, I know,\u00e2\u0080\u009d jeered Laurent. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou mean to say he was a\nfool. You must have forgotten! You pretended you were irritated at\nthe slightest thing he said, that he could not open his mouth without\nletting out some stupidity.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t jeer,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Therese. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt only remains for you to insult the man\nyou murdered. You know nothing about the feelings of a woman, Laurent;\nCamille loved me and I loved him.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou loved him! Ah! Really what a capital idea,\u00e2\u0080\u009d exclaimed Laurent. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd\nno doubt it was because you loved your husband, that you took me as a\nsweetheart. I remember one day when we were together, that you told me\nCamille disgusted you, when you felt the end of your fingers enter his\nflesh as if it were soft clay. Oh! I know why you loved me. You required\nmore vigorous arms than those of that poor devil.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI loved him as a sister,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Therese. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe was the son of my\nbenefactress. He had all the delicate feelings of a feeble man. He\nshowed himself noble and generous, serviceable and loving. And we killed\nhim, good God! good God!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe wept, and swooned away. Madame Raquin cast piercing glances at her,\nindignant to hear the praise of Camille sung by such a pair of lips.\nLaurent who was unable to do anything against this overflow of tears,\nwalked to and fro with furious strides, searching in his head for some\nmeans to stifle the remorse of Therese.\n\nAll the good he heard said of his victim ended by causing him poignant\nanxiety. Now and again he let himself be caught by the heartrending\naccents of his wife. He really believed in the virtues of Camille, and\nhis terror redoubled. But what tried his patience beyond measure was\nthe comparison that the widow of the drowned man never failed to draw\nbetween her first and second husband, and which was all to the advantage\nof the former.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell! Yes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she cried, \u00e2\u0080\u009che was better than you. I would sooner he were\nalive now, and you in his place underground.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nLaurent first of all shrugged his shoulders.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSay what you will,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she continued, becoming animated, \u00e2\u0080\u009calthough I\nperhaps failed to love him in his lifetime, yet I remember all his good\nqualities now, and do love him. Yes, I love him and hate you, do you\nhear? For you are an assassin.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWill you hold your tongue?\u00e2\u0080\u009d yelled Laurent.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd he is a victim,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she went on, notwithstanding the threatening\nattitude of her husband, \u00e2\u0080\u009can upright man killed by a rascal. Oh! I am\nnot afraid of you. You know well enough that you are a miserable wretch,\na brute of a man without a heart, and without a soul. How can you expect\nme to love you, now that you are reeking with the blood of Camille?\nCamille was full of tenderness for me, and I would kill you, do you\nhear, if that could bring him to life again, and give me back his love.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWill you hold your tongue, you wretch?\u00e2\u0080\u009d shouted Laurent.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy should I hold my tongue?\u00e2\u0080\u009d she retorted. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am speaking the truth.\nI would purchase forgiveness at the price of your blood. Ah! How I\nweep, and how I suffer! It is my own fault if a scoundrel, such as you,\nmurdered my husband. I must go, one of these nights, and kiss the ground\nwhere he rests. That will be my final rapture.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nLaurent, beside himself, rendered furious by the atrocious pictures that\nTherese spread out before his eyes, rushed upon her, and threw her down,\nmenacing her with his uplifted fist.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she cried, \u00e2\u0080\u009cstrike me, kill me! Camille never once raised\nhis hand to me, but you are a monster.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd Laurent, spurred on by what she said, shook her with rage, beat her,\nbruised her body with his clenched fists. In two instances he almost\nstrangled her. Therese yielded to his blows. She experienced keen\ndelight in being struck, delivering herself up, thrusting her body\nforward, provoking her husband in every way, so that he might half kill\nher again. This was another remedy for her suffering. She slept better\nat night when she had been thoroughly beaten in the evening. Madame\nRaquin enjoyed exquisite pleasure, when Laurent dragged her niece along\nthe floor in this way, belabouring her with thumps and kicks.\n\nThe existence of the assassin had become terrible since the day when\nTherese conceived the infernal idea of feeling remorse and of mourning\nCamille aloud. From that moment the wretch lived everlastingly with\nhis victim. At every hour, he had to listen to his wife praising and\nregretting her first husband. The least incident became a pretext:\nCamille did this, Camille did that, Camille had such and such qualities,\nCamille loved in such and such a way.\n\nIt was always Camille! Ever sad remarks bewailing his death. Therese\nhad recourse to all her spitefulness to render this torture, which she\ninflicted on Laurent so as to shield her own self, as cruel as possible.\nShe went into details, relating a thousand insignificant incidents\nconnected with her youth, accompanied by sighs and expressions of\nregret, and in this manner, mingled the remembrance of the drowned man\nwith every action of her daily life.\n\nThe corpse which already haunted the house, was introduced there openly.\nIt sat on the chairs, took its place at table, extended itself on the\nbed, making use of the various articles of furniture, and of the objects\nlying about hither and thither. Laurent could touch nothing, not a fork,\nnot a brush, without Therese making him feel that Camille had touched it\nbefore him.\n\nThe murderer being ceaselessly thrust, so to say, against the man he had\nkilled, ended by experiencing a strange sensation that very nearly drove\nhim out of his mind. By being so constantly compared to Camille, by\nmaking use of the different articles Camille had used, he imagined he\nwas Camille himself, that he was identical with his victim. Then, with\nhis brain fit to burst, he flew at his wife to make her hold her tongue,\nso as to no longer hear the words that drove him frantic. All their\nquarrels now ended in blows.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXX\n\nA time came when Madame Raquin, in order to escape the sufferings she\nendured, thought of starving herself to death. She had reached the\nend of her courage, she could no longer support the martyrdom that the\npresence of the two murderers imposed on her, she longed to find supreme\nrelief in death. Each day her anguish grew more keen, when Therese\nembraced her, and when Laurent took her in his arms to carry her along\nlike a child. She determined on freeing herself from these clasps\nand caresses that caused her such horrible disgust. As she had not\nsufficient life left within her to permit of her avenging her son, she\npreferred to be entirely dead, and to leave naught in the hands of the\nassassins but a corpse that could feel nothing, and with which they\ncould do as they pleased.\n\nFor two days she refused all nourishment, employing her remaining\nstrength to clench her teeth or to eject anything that Therese succeeded\nin introducing into her mouth. Therese was in despair. She was asking\nherself at the foot of which post she should go to weep and repent, when\nher aunt would be no longer there. She kept up an interminable discourse\nto prove to Madame Raquin that she should live. She wept, she even\nbecame angry, bursting into her former fits of rage, opening the jaw of\nthe paralysed woman as you open that of an animal which resists. Madame\nRaquin held out, and an odious scene ensued.\n\nLaurent remained absolutely neutral and indifferent. He was astonished\nat the efforts of Therese to prevent the impotent old woman committing\nsuicide. Now that the presence of the old lady had become useless to\nthem he desired her death. He would not have killed her, but as she\nwished to die, he did not see the use of depriving her of the means to\ndo so.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut, let her be!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he shouted to his wife. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt will be a good riddance.\nWe shall, perhaps, be happier when she is no longer here.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThis remark repeated several times in the hearing of Madame Raquin,\ncaused her extraordinary emotion. She feared that the hope expressed\nby Laurent might be realised, and that after her death the couple would\nenjoy calm and happiness. And she said to herself that it would be\ncowardly to die, that she had no right to go away before she had seen\nthe end of the sinister adventure. Then, only, could she descend into\ndarkness, to say to Camille:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou are avenged.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe idea of suicide became oppressive, when she all at once reflected\nthat she would sink into the grave ignorant as to what had happened\nto the two murderers of her son. There, she would lie in the cold\nand silent earth, eternally tormented by uncertainty concerning the\npunishment of her tormentors. To thoroughly enjoy the slumber of death,\nshe must be hushed to rest by the sweet delight of vengeance, she must\ncarry away with her a dream of satisfied hatred, a dream that would last\nthroughout eternity. So she took the food her niece presented to her,\nand consented to live on.\n\nApart from this, it was easy for her to perceive that the climax could\nnot be far off. Each day the position of the married couple became\nmore strained and unbearable. A crash that would smash everything was\nimminent. At every moment, Therese and Laurent started up face to face\nin a more threatening manner. It was no longer at nighttime, alone,\nthat they suffered from their intimacy; entire days were passed amidst\nanxiety and harrowing shocks. It was one constant scene of pain and\nterror. They lived in a perfect pandemonium, fighting, rendering all\nthey did and said bitter and cruel, seeking to fling one another to the\nbottom of the abyss which they felt beneath their feet, and falling into\nit together.\n\nIdeas of separation had, indeed, occurred to both of them. Each had\nthought of flight, of seeking some repose far from this Arcade of the\nPont Neuf where the damp and filth seemed adapted to their desolated\nlife. But they dared not, they could not run away. It seemed impossible\nfor them to avoid reviling each other, to avoid remaining there to\nsuffer and cause pain. They proved obstinate in their hatred and\ncruelty. A sort of repulsion and attraction separated and kept them\ntogether at the same time. They behaved in the identical manner of two\npersons who, after quarrelling, wish to part, and who, nevertheless,\ncontinue returning to shout out fresh insults at one another.\n\nMoreover, material obstacles stood in the way of flight. What were\nthey to do with the impotent woman? What could be said to the Thursday\nevening guests? If they fled, these people would, perhaps, suspect\nsomething. At this thought, they imagined they were being pursued and\ndragged to the guillotine. So they remained where they were through\ncowardice, wretchedly dragging out their lives amidst the horror of\ntheir surroundings.\n\nDuring the morning and afternoon, when Laurent was absent, Therese went\nfrom the dining-room to the shop in anxiety and trouble, at a loss to\nknow what to do to fill up the void in her existence that daily became\nmore pronounced. When not kneeling at the feet of Madame Raquin or\nreceiving blows and insults from her husband, she had no occupation. As\nsoon as she was seated alone in the shop, she became dejected, watching\nwith a doltish expression, the people passing through the dirty, dark\ngallery. She felt ready to die of sadness in the middle of this gloomy\nvault, which had the odour of a cemetery, and ended by begging Suzanne\nto come and pass entire days with her, in the hope that the presence of\nthis poor, gentle, pale creature might calm her.\n\nSuzanne accepted her offer with delight; she continued to feel a sort of\nrespectful friendship for Therese, and had long desired to come and work\nwith her, while Olivier was at his office. Bringing her embroidery with\nher, she took the vacant chair of Madame Raquin behind the counter.\n\nFrom that day Therese rather neglected her aunt. She went upstairs\nless frequently to weep on her knees and kiss the deathlike face of the\ninvalid. She had something else to do. She made efforts to listen with\ninterest to the dilatory gossip of Suzanne, who spoke of her home, and\nof the trivialities of her monotonous life. This relieved Therese of her\nown thoughts. Sometimes she caught herself paying attention to nonsense\nthat brought a bitter smile to her face.\n\nBy degrees, she lost all her customers. Since her aunt had been confined\nto her armchair upstairs, she had let the shop go from bad to worse,\nabandoning the goods to dust and damp. A smell of mildew hung in the\natmosphere, spiders came down from the ceiling, the floor was but rarely\nswept.\n\nBut what put the customers to flight was the strange way in which\nTherese sometimes welcomed them. When she happened to be upstairs,\nreceiving blows from Laurent or agitated by a shock of terror, and the\nbell at the shop door tinkled imperiously, she had to go down, barely\ntaking time to do up her hair or brush away the tears. On such occasions\nshe served the persons awaiting her roughly; sometimes she even spared\nherself the trouble of serving, answering from the top of the staircase,\nthat she no longer kept what was asked for. This kind of off-hand\nbehaviour, was not calculated to retain custom.\n\nThe little work-girls of the quarter, who were used to the sweet\namiability of Madame Raquin, were driven away by the harshness and wild\nlooks of Therese. When the latter took Suzanne with her to keep her\ncompany, the defection became complete. To avoid being disturbed\nin their gossip, the two young woman managed to drive away the few\nremaining purchasers who visited the shop. Henceforth, the mercery\nbusiness ceased to bring in a sou towards the household expenses, and it\nbecame necessary to encroach on the capital of forty thousand francs and\nmore.\n\nSometimes, Therese absented herself the entire afternoon. No one knew\nwhere she went. Her reason for having Suzanne with her was no doubt\npartly for the purpose of securing company but also to mind the shop,\nwhile she was away. When she returned in the evening, worn out, her\neyelids heavy with exhaustion, it was to find the little wife of Olivier\nstill behind the counter, bowed down, with a vague smile on her lips, in\nthe same attitude as she had left her five hours previously.\n\nTherese had a bad fright about five months after her marriage to\nLaurent. She found out she was pregnant and detested the thought of\nhaving a child of Laurent\u00e2\u0080\u0099s. She had the fear that she would give birth\nto a drowned body. She thought that she could feel inside herself a\nsoft, decomposing corpse. No matter what, she had to rid herself of this\nchild. She did not tell Laurent. One day she cruelly provoked him and\nturned her stomach towards him, hoping to receive a kick. He kicked her\nand she let him go on kicking her in the stomach until she thought\nshe would die. The next day her wish was fulfilled and she had a\nmiscarriage.\n\nLaurent also led a frightful existence. The days seemed insupportably\nlong; each brought the same anguish, the same heavy weariness which\noverwhelmed him at certain hours with crushing monotony and regularity.\nHe dragged on his life, terrified every night by the recollections of\nthe day, and the expectation of the morrow. He knew that henceforth, all\nhis days would resemble one another, and bring him equal suffering. And\nhe saw the weeks, months and years gloomily and implacably awaiting him,\ncoming one after the other to fall upon him and gradually smother him.\n\nWhen there is no hope in the future, the present appears atrociously\nbitter. Laurent no longer resisted, he became lumpish, abandoning\nhimself to the nothingness that was already gaining possession of his\nbeing. Idleness was killing him. In the morning he went out, without\nknowing where to go, disgusted at the thought of doing what he had done\non the previous day, and compelled, in spite of himself, to do it again.\nHe went to his studio by habit, by mania.\n\nThis room, with its grey walls, whence he could see naught but a bare\nsquare of sky, filled him with mournful sadness. He grovelled on the\ndivan heavy in thought and with pendent arms. He dared not touch a\nbrush. He had made fresh attempts at painting, but only to find on each\noccasion, the head of Camille appear jeering on the canvas. So as not to\ngo out of his mind, he ended by throwing his colour-box into a corner,\nand imposing the most absolute idleness on himself. This obligatory\nlaziness weighed upon him terribly.\n\nIn the afternoon, he questioned himself in distress to find out what\nhe should do. For half an hour, he remained on the pavement in the Rue\nMazarine, thinking and hesitating as to how he could divert himself. He\nrejected the idea of returning to the studio, and invariably decided\non going down the Rue Guenegaud, to walk along the quays. And, until\nevening, he went along, dazed and seized with sudden shudders whenever\nhe looked at the Seine. Whether in his studio or in the streets, his\ndejection was the same. The following day he began again. He passed\nthe morning on his divan, and dragged himself along the quays in the\nafternoon. This lasted for months, and might last for years.\n\nOccasionally Laurent reflected that he had killed Camille so as to\ndo nothing ever afterwards, and now that he did nothing, he was quite\nastonished to suffer so much. He would have liked to force himself to be\nhappy. He proved to his own satisfaction, that he did wrong to suffer,\nthat he had just attained supreme felicity, consisting in crossing his\narms, and that he was an idiot not to enjoy this bliss in peace. But his\nreasoning exploded in the face of facts. He was constrained to confess,\nat the bottom of his heart, that this idleness rendered his anguish\nthe more cruel, by leaving him every hour of his life to ponder on the\ndespair and deepen its incurable bitterness. Laziness, that brutish\nexistence which had been his dream, proved his punishment. At moments,\nhe ardently hoped for some occupation to draw him from his thoughts.\nThen he lost all energy, relapsing beneath the weight of implacable\nfatality that bound his limbs so as to more surely crush him.\n\nIn truth, he only found some relief when beating Therese, at night. This\nbrutality alone relieved him of his enervated anguish.\n\nBut his keenest suffering, both physical and moral, came from the bite\nCamille had given him in the neck. At certain moments, he imagined that\nthis scar covered the whole of his body. If he came to forget the past,\nhe all at once fancied he felt a burning puncture, that recalled the\nmurder both to his frame and mind.\n\nWhen under the influence of emotion, he could not stand before\na looking-glass without noticing this phenomenon which he had so\nfrequently remarked and which always terrified him; the blood flew to\nhis neck, purpling the scar, which then began to gnaw the skin.\n\nThis sort of wound that lived upon him, which became active, flushed,\nand biting at the slightest trouble, frightened and tortured him. He\nended by believing that the teeth of the drowned man had planted an\ninsect there which was devouring him. The part of his neck where the\nscar appeared, seemed to him to no longer belong to his body; it\nwas like foreign flesh that had been stuck in this place, a piece of\npoisoned meat that was rotting his own muscles.\n\nIn this manner, he carried the living and devouring recollection of his\ncrime about with him everywhere. When he beat Therese, she endeavoured\nto scratch the spot, and sometimes dug her nails into it making him howl\nwith pain. She generally pretended to sob, as soon as she caught sight\nof the bite, so as to make it more insufferable to Laurent. All her\nrevenge for his brutality, consisted in martyrising him in connection\nwith this bite.\n\nWhile shaving, he had frequently been tempted to give himself a gash\nin the neck, so as to make the marks of the teeth of the drowned man\ndisappear. When, standing before the mirror, he raised his chin and\nperceived the red spot beneath the white lather, he at once flew into a\nrage, and rapidly brought the razor to his neck, to cut right into the\nflesh. But the sensations of the cold steel against his skin always\nbrought him to his senses, and caused him to feel so faint that he was\nobliged to seat himself, and wait until he had recovered sufficient\ncourage to continue shaving.\n\nHe only issued from his torpor at night to fall into blind and puerile\nfits of anger. When tired of quarreling with Therese and beating her,\nhe would kick the walls like a child, and look for something he could\nbreak. This relieved him.\n\nHe had a particular dislike for the tabby cat Francois who, as soon as\nhe appeared, sought refuge on the knees of Madame Raquin. If Laurent had\nnot yet killed the animal, it was because he dared not take hold of\nhim. The cat looked at him with great round eyes that were diabolical\nin their fixedness. He wondered what these eyes which never left him,\nwanted; and he ended by having regular fits of terror, and imagining all\nsorts of ridiculous things.\n\nWhen at table--at no matter what moment, in the middle of a quarrel or\nof a long silence--he happened, all at once, to look round, and perceive\nFrancois examining him with a harsh, implacable stare, he turned pale\nand lost his head. He was on the point of saying to the cat:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHeh! Why don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you speak? Tell me what it is you want with me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWhen he could crush his paw or tail, he did so in affrighted joy, the\nmewing of the poor creature giving him vague terror, as though he\nheard a human cry of pain. Laurent, in fact, was afraid of Francois,\nparticularly since the latter passed his time on the knees of the\nimpotent old lady, as if in the centre of an impregnable fortress,\nwhence he could with impunity set his eyes on his enemy. The murderer\nof Camille established a vague resemblance between this irritated animal\nand the paralysed woman, saying to himself that the cat, like Madame\nRaquin, must know about the crime and would denounce him, if he ever\nfound a tongue.\n\nAt last, one night, Francois looked at Laurent so fixedly, that the\nlatter, irritated to the last pitch, made up his mind to put an end to\nthe annoyance. He threw the window of the dining-room wide open, and\nadvancing to where the cat was seated, grasped him by the skin at the\nback of the neck. Madame Raquin understood, and two big tears\nrolled down her cheeks. The cat began to swear, and stiffen himself,\nendeavouring to turn round and bite the hand that grasped him. But\nLaurent held fast. He whirled the cat round two or three times in the\nair, and then sent him flying with all the strength of his arm, against\nthe great dark wall opposite. Francois went flat against it, and\nbreaking his spine, fell upon the glass roof of the arcade. All night\nthe wretched beast dragged himself along the gutter mewing hoarsely,\nwhile Madame Raquin wept over him almost as much as she had done over\nCamille. Therese had an atrocious attack of hysterics, while the wailing\nof the cat sounded sinisterly, in the gloom below the windows.\n\nLaurent soon had further cause for anxiety. He became alarmed at a\ncertain change he observed in the attitude of his wife.\n\nTherese became sombre and taciturn. She no longer lavished effusions\nof repentance and grateful kisses on Madame Raquin. In presence of the\nparalysed woman, she resumed her manner of frigid cruelty and egotistic\nindifference. It seemed as though she had tried remorse, and finding no\nrelief had turned her attention to another remedy. Her sadness was no\ndoubt due to her inability to calm her life.\n\nShe observed the impotent old woman with a kind of disdain, as a useless\nthing that could no longer even serve her for consolation. She now only\nbestowed on her the necessary attention to prevent her dying of hunger.\nFrom this moment she dragged herself about the house in silence and\ndejection. She multiplied her absences from the shop, going out as\nfrequently as three and four times a week.\n\nIt was this change in her mode of life, that surprised and alarmed\nLaurent. He fancied that her remorse had taken another form, and was now\ndisplayed by this mournful weariness he noticed in her. This weariness\nseemed to him more alarming than the chattering despair she had\noverwhelmed him with previously. She no longer spoke, she no longer\nquarrelled with him, she seemed to consign everything to the depths of\nher being. He would rather have heard her exhausting her endurance than\nsee her keep in this manner to herself. He feared that one day she\nwould be choking with anguish, and to obtain relief, would go and relate\neverything to a priest or an examining magistrate.\n\nThen these numerous absences of Therese had frightful significance in\nhis eyes. He thought she went to find a confidant outside, that she was\npreparing her treason. On two occasions he tried to follow her, and lost\nher in the streets. He then prepared to watch her again. A fixed idea\ngot into his head: Therese, driven to extremities by suffering, was\nabout to make disclosures, and he must gag her, he must arrest her\nconfession in her throat.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXI\n\nOne morning, Laurent, instead of going to his studio, took up a position\nat a wine-shop situated at one of the corners of the Rue Guenegaud,\nopposite the studio. From there, he began to examine the persons who\nissued from the passage on to the pavement of the Rue Mazarine. He\nwas watching for Therese. The previous evening, the young woman had\nmentioned that she intended going out next day and probably would not be\nhome until evening.\n\nLaurent waited fully half an hour. He knew that his wife always went by\nthe Rue Mazarine; nevertheless, at one moment, he remembered that she\nmight escape him by taking the Rue de Seine, and he thought of returning\nto the arcade, and concealing himself in the corridor of the house. But\nhe determined to retain his seat a little longer, and just as he was\ngrowing impatient he suddenly saw Therese come rapidly from the passage.\n\nShe wore a light gown, and, for the first time, he noticed that her\nattire appeared remarkably showy, like a street-walker. She twisted\nher body about on the pavement, staring provokingly at the men who came\nalong, and raising her skirt, which she clutched in a bunch in her hand,\nmuch higher than any respectable woman would have done, in order\nto display her lace-up boots and stockings. As she went up the Rue\nMazarine, Laurent followed her.\n\nIt was mild weather, and the young woman walked slowly, with her head\nthrown slightly backward and her hair streaming down her back. The men\nwho had first of all stared her in the face, turned round to take a\nback view. She passed into the Rue de l\u00e2\u0080\u0099Ecole de Medecine. Laurent\nwas terrified. He knew that somewhere in this neighbourhood, was a\nCommissariat of Police, and he said to himself that there could no\nlonger be any doubt as to the intentions of his wife, she was certainly\nabout to denounce him. Then he made up his mind to rush after her, if\nshe crossed the threshold of the commissariat, to implore her, to beat\nher if necessary, so as to compel her to hold her tongue. At a street\ncorner she looked at a policeman who came along, and Laurent trembled\nwith fright, lest she should stop and speak to him. In terror of being\narrested on the spot if he showed himself, he hid in a doorway.\n\nThis excursion proved perfect agony. While his wife basked in the sun\non the pavement, trailing her skirt with nonchalance and impudence,\nshameless and unconcerned, he followed behind her, pale and shuddering,\nrepeating that it was all over, that he would be unable to save himself\nand would be guillotined. Each step he saw her take, seemed to him a\nstep nearer punishment. Fright gave him a sort of blind conviction, and\nthe slightest movement of the young woman added to his certainty. He\nfollowed her, he went where she went, as a man goes to the scaffold.\n\nSuddenly on reaching the former Place Saint-Michel, Therese\nadvanced towards a cafe that then formed the corner of the Rue\nMonsieur-le-Prince. There she seated herself in the centre of a group of\nwomen and students, at one of the tables on the pavement, and familiarly\nshook hands with all this little crowd. Then she called for absinthe.\n\nShe seemed quite at ease, chatting with a fair young man who no doubt\nhad been waiting for her some time. Two girls came and leant over\nthe table where she sat, addressing her affectionately in their husky\nvoices. Around her, women were smoking cigarettes, men were embracing\nwomen in the open street, before the passers-by, who never even turned\ntheir heads. Low words and hoarse laughter reached Laurent, who remained\nmotionless in a doorway on the opposite side of the street.\n\nWhen Therese had finished her absinthe, she rose, and leaning on the arm\nof the fair young man, went down the Rue de la Harpe. Laurent followed\nthem as far as the Rue Saint-Andre-des-Arts, where he noticed them enter\na lodging-house. He remained in the middle of the street with his eyes\non the front of the building. Presently his wife showed herself for\nan instant at an open window on the second floor, and he fancied he\nperceived the hands of the pale young man encircling her waist. Then,\nthe window closed with a sharp clang.\n\nLaurent understood. Without waiting a moment longer, he tranquilly took\nhimself off reassured and happy.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBah!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he to himself, as he went towards the quays. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s better,\nafter all, that she should have a sweetheart. That will occupy her mind,\nand prevent her thinking of injuring me. She\u00e2\u0080\u0099s deucedly more clever than\nI am.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWhat astonished him, was that he had not been the first to think of\nplunging into vice, which might have driven away his terror. But his\nthoughts had never turned in that direction, and, moreover, he had not\nthe least inclination for riotous living. The infidelity of his wife did\nnot trouble him in the least. He felt no anger at the knowledge that she\nwas in the arms of another man. On the contrary, he seemed to enjoy\nthe idea. He began to think that he had been following the wife of a\ncomrade, and laughed at the cunning trick the woman was playing her\nhusband. Therese had become such a stranger to him, that he no longer\nfelt her alive in his heart. He would have sold her, bound hand and\nfoot, a hundred times over, to purchase calm for one hour.\n\nAs he sauntered along, he enjoyed the sudden, delightful reaction that\nhad just brought him from terror to peace. He almost thanked his wife\nfor having gone to a sweetheart, when he thought her on her way to a\ncommissary of police. This adventure had come to an unforeseen end that\nagreeably surprised him. It distinctly showed him that he had done wrong\nto tremble, and that he, in his turn, should try vice, in order to see\nwhether such a course would not relieve him by diverting his thoughts.\n\nOn returning to the shop in the evening, Laurent decided that he would\nask his wife for a few thousand francs, and that he would resort to\nhigh-handed measures to obtain them. Reflection told him that vice would\nbe an expensive thing, for a man. He patiently awaited Therese, who had\nnot yet come in. When she arrived, he affected gentleness, and refrained\nfrom breathing a word about having followed her in the morning. She was\nslightly tipsy, and from her ill-adjusted garments, came that unpleasant\nodour of tobacco and spirits that is met with in public drinking places.\nCompletely exhausted, and with cheeks as pale as death, she advanced at\nan unsteady gait and with a head quite heavy from the shameless fatigue\nof the day.\n\nThe dinner passed in silence. Therese ate nothing. At dessert Laurent\nplaced his elbows on the table, and flatly asked her for 5,000 francs.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she answered dryly. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf I were to give you a free hand, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099d\nbring us to beggary. Aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you aware of our position? We are going as\nfast as ever we can to the dogs.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat may be,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he quietly resumed. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t care a fig, I intend to have\nmoney.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, a thousand times no!\u00e2\u0080\u009d she retorted. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou left your place, the\nmercery business is in a very bad way, and the revenue from my marriage\nportion is not sufficient to maintain us. Every day I encroach on the\nprincipal to feed you and give you the one hundred francs a month you\nwrung from me. You will not get anything beyond that, do you understand?\nSo it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no use asking.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cJust reflect,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he replied, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be so silly as to refuse. I tell\nyou I mean to have 5,000 francs, and I shall have them. You\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll give them\nme, in spite of all.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThis quiet determination irritated Therese and put the finishing touch\nto her intoxication.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAh! I know what it is,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she cried, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou want to finish as you began.\nWe have been keeping you for four years. You only came to us to eat and\ndrink, and since then you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been at our charge. Monsieur does nothing,\nMonsieur has arranged so as to live at my expense with his arms folded\none over the other. No, you shall have nothing, not a sou. Do you want\nme to tell you what you are? Well then, you are a------\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnd she pronounced the word. Laurent began to laugh, shrugging his\nshoulders. He merely replied:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou learn some pretty expressions in the company you keep now.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThis was the only allusion he ventured to make to the love affairs of\nTherese. She quickly raised her head, and bitterly replied:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnyhow, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t keep the company of murderers.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nLaurent became very pale, and for a moment remained silent, with his\neyes fixed on his wife; then, in a trembling voice, he resumed:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cListen, my girl, don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t let us get angry; there is no good in that\nneither for you nor me. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve lost all courage. We had better come to an\nunderstanding if we wish to avoid a misfortune. If I ask you for 5,000\nfrancs it is because I want them; and I will even tell you what I intend\nto do with them, so as to ensure our tranquillity.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe gave her a peculiar smile, and continued:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCome, reflect, let me have your last word.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI have thoroughly made up my mind,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered the young woman, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand it\nis as I have told you. You shall not have a sou.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHer husband rose violently. She was afraid of being beaten; she crouched\ndown, determined not to give way to blows. But Laurent did not even\napproach her, he confined himself to telling her in a frigid tone that\nhe was tired of life, and was about to relate the story of the murder to\nthe commissary of police of the quarter.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou drive me to extremes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou make my life unbearable. I\nprefer to have done with it. We shall both be tried and condemned. And\nthere will be an end to it all.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDo you think you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll frighten me?\u00e2\u0080\u009d shouted his wife. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am as weary as\nyou are. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll go to the commissary of police myself, if you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t. Ah!\nIndeed, I am quite ready to follow you to the scaffold, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not a coward\nlike you. Come along, come along with me to the commissary.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe had risen, and was making her way to the staircase.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d stammered Laurent, \u00e2\u0080\u009clet\u00e2\u0080\u0099s go together.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWhen they were down in the shop they looked at one another, anxious and\nalarmed. It seemed as though they were riveted to the ground. The few\nseconds they had taken to run downstairs had suffered to show them, as\nin a flash, all the consequences of a confession. They saw at the same\nmoment, suddenly and distinctly: gendarmes, prison, assize-court and\nguillotine. This made them feel faint, and they were tempted to throw\nthemselves on their knees, one before the other, to implore one another\nto remain, and reveal nothing. Fright and embarrassment kept them\nmotionless and mute for two or three minutes. Therese was the first to\nmake up her mind to speak and give way.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAfter all,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said she, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am a great fool to quarrel with you about this\nmoney. You will succeed in getting hold of it and squandering it, one\nday or another. I may just as well give it you at once.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe did not seek to conceal her defeat any further. She seated herself\nat the counter, and signed a cheque for 5,000 francs, which Laurent was\nto present to her banker. There was no more question of the commissary\nof police that evening.\n\nAs soon as Laurent had the gold in his pocket, he began to lead a\nriotous life, drinking to excess, and frequenting women of ill-repute.\nHe slept all day and stayed out all night, in search of violent emotions\nthat would relieve him of reality. But he only succeeded in becoming\nmore oppressed than before. When the company were shouting around\nhim, he heard the great, terrible silence within him; when one of his\nladyloves kissed him, when he drained his glass, he found naught at the\nbottom of his satiety, but heavy sadness.\n\nHe was no longer a man for lust and gluttony. His chilled being, as\nif inwardly rigid, became enervated at the kisses and feasts. Feeling\ndisgusted beforehand, they failed to arouse his imagination or to excite\nhis senses and stomach. He suffered a little more by forcing himself\ninto a dissolute mode of life, and that was all. Then, when he returned\nhome, when he saw Madame Raquin and Therese again, his weariness brought\non frightful fits of terror. And he vowed he would leave the house\nno more, that he would put up with his suffering, so as to become\naccustomed to it, and be able to conquer it.\n\nFor a month Therese lived, like Laurent, on the pavement and in the\ncafes. She returned daily for a moment, in the evening to feed Madame\nRaquin and put her to bed, and then disappeared again until the morrow.\nShe and her husband on one occasion were four days without setting eyes\non each other. At last, she experienced profound disgust at the life\nshe was leading, feeling that vice succeeded no better with her than the\ncomedy of remorse.\n\nIn vain had she dragged through all the lodging-houses in the Latin\nQuarter, in vain had she led a low, riotous life. Her nerves were\nruined. Debauchery ceased to give her a sufficiently violent shock to\nrender her oblivious of the past. She resembled one of those drunkards\nwhose scorched palates remain insensible to the most violent spirits.\nShe had done with lust, and the society of her paramours only worried\nand wearied her. Then, she quitted them as useless.\n\nShe now fell a prey to despondent idleness which kept her at home, in\na dirty petticoat, with hair uncombed, and face and hands unwashed. She\nneglected everything and lived in filth.\n\nWhen the two murderers came together again face to face, in this\nmanner, after having done their best to get away from each other,\nthey understood that they would no longer have strength to struggle.\nDebauchery had rejected them, it had just cast them back to their\nanguish. Once more they were in the dark, damp lodging in the arcade;\nand, henceforth, were as if imprisoned there, for although they had\noften attempted to save themselves, never had they been able to\nsever the sanguinary bond attaching them. They did not even think of\nattempting a task they regarded as impossible. They found themselves so\nurged on, so overwhelmed, so securely fastened together by events, that\nthey were conscious all resistance would be ridiculous. They resumed\ntheir life in common, but their hatred became furious rage.\n\nThe quarrels at night began again. But for that matter, the blows\nand cries lasted all day long. To hatred distrust was now added, and\ndistrust put the finishing touch to their folly.\n\nThey were afraid of each other. The scene that had followed the demand\nfor 5,000 francs, was repeated morning and night. They had the fixed\nidea that they wanted to give one another up. From that standpoint they\ndid not depart. When either of them said a word, or made a gesture, the\nother imagined that he or she, as the case might be, intended to go\nto the commissary of police. Then, they either fought or implored one\nanother to do nothing.\n\nIn their anger, they shouted out that they would run and reveal\neverything, and terrified each other to death. After this they\nshuddered, they humbled themselves, and promised with bitter tears to\nmaintain silence. They suffered most horribly, but had not the courage\nto cure themselves by placing a red-hot iron on the wound. If they\nthreatened one another to confess the crime, it was merely to strike\nterror into each other and drive away the thought, for they would never\nhave had strength to speak and seek peace in punishment.\n\nOn more than twenty occasions, they went as far as the door of the\ncommissariat of police, one following the other. Now it was Laurent who\nwanted to confess the murder, now Therese who ran to give herself\nup. But they met in the street, and always decided to wait, after an\ninterchange of insults and ardent prayers.\n\nEvery fresh attack made them more suspicious and ferocious than before.\nFrom morning till night they were spying upon one another. Laurent\nbarely set his foot outside the lodging in the arcade, and if,\nperchance, he did absent himself, Therese never failed to accompany him.\nTheir suspicions, their fright lest either should confess, brought\nthem together, united them in atrocious intimacy. Never, since their\nmarriage, had they lived so tightly tied together, and never had they\nexperienced such suffering. But, notwithstanding the anguish they\nimposed on themselves, they never took their eyes off one another. They\npreferred to endure the most excruciating pain, rather than separate for\nan hour.\n\nIf Therese went down to the shop, Laurent followed, afraid that she\nmight talk to a customer; if Laurent stood in the doorway, observing the\npeople passing through the arcade, Therese placed herself beside him to\nsee that he did not speak to anyone. When the guests were assembled on\nThursday evenings, the murderers addressed supplicating glances to each\nother, listening to one another in terror, one accomplice expecting the\nother to make some confession, and giving an involving interpretation to\nsentences only just commenced.\n\nSuch a state of warfare could not continue any longer.\n\nTherese and Laurent had both reached the point of pondering on the\nadvisability of extricating themselves from the consequences of their\nfirst crime, by committing a second. It became absolutely necessary that\none of them should disappear so that the other might enjoy some repose.\nThis reflection came to them both at the same time; both felt the urgent\nnecessity for a separation, and both desired that it should be eternal.\nThe murder that now occurred to their minds, seemed to them natural,\nfatal and forcibly brought about by the murder of Camille. They did not\neven turn the matter over in their heads but welcomed the idea as the\nonly means of safety. Laurent determined he would kill Therese because\nshe stood in his way, because she might ruin him by a word, and because\nshe caused him unbearable suffering. Therese made up her mind that she\nwould kill Laurent, for the same reasons.\n\nThe firm resolution to commit another murder somewhat calmed them.\nThey formed their plans. But in that respect they acted with feverish\nexcitement, and without any display of excessive prudence. They only\nthought vaguely of the probable consequences of a murder committed\nwithout flight and immunity being ensured. They felt the invincible\nnecessity to kill one another, and yielded to this necessity like\nfurious brutes. They would not have exposed themselves for their first\ncrime, which they had so cleverly concealed, and yet they risked the\nguillotine, in committing a second, which they did not even attempt to\nhide.\n\nHere was a contradiction in their conduct that they never so much as\ncaught sight of. Both simply said to themselves that if they succeeded\nin fleeing, they would go and live abroad, taking all the cash with\nthem. Therese, a fortnight or three weeks before, had drawn from the\nbank the few thousand francs that remained of her marriage portion, and\nkept them locked up in a drawer--a circumstance that had not escaped\nLaurent. The fate of Madame Raquin did not trouble them an instant.\n\nA few weeks previously, Laurent had met one of his old college friends,\nnow acting as dispenser to a famous chemist, who gave considerable\nattention to toxicology. This friend had shown him over the laboratory\nwhere he worked, pointing out to him the apparatus and the drugs.\n\nOne night, after he had made up his mind in regard to the murder, and\nas Therese was drinking a glass of sugar and water before him, Laurent\nremembered that he had seen in this laboratory a small stoneware flagon,\ncontaining prussic acid, and that the young dispenser had spoken to him\nof the terrible effects of this poison, which strikes the victim down\nwith sudden death, leaving but few traces behind. And Laurent said to\nhimself, that this was the poison he required. On the morrow, succeeding\nin escaping the vigilance of Therese, he paid his friend a visit, and\nwhile he had his back turned, stole the small stoneware flagon.\n\nThe same day, Therese took advantage of the absence of Laurent, to send\nthe large kitchen knife, with which they were in the habit of breaking\nthe loaf sugar, and which was very much notched, to be sharpened. When\nit came back, she hid it in a corner of the sideboard.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXII\n\nThe following Thursday, the evening party at the Raquins, as the guests\ncontinued to term the household of their hosts, was particularly merry.\nIt was prolonged until half-past eleven, and as Grivet withdrew, he\ndeclared that he had never passed such a pleasant time.\n\nSuzanne, who was not very well, never ceased talking to Therese of her\npain and joy. Therese appeared to listen to her with great interest,\nher eyes fixed, her lips pinched, her head, at moments, bending forward;\nwhile her lowering eyelids cast a cloud over the whole of her face.\n\nLaurent, for his part, gave uninterrupted attention to the tales of old\nMichaud and Olivier. These gentlemen never paused, and it was only with\ndifficulty that Grivet succeeded in getting in a word edgeways between\na couple of sentences of father and son. He had a certain respect\nfor these two men whom he considered good talkers. On that particular\nevening, a gossip having taken the place of the usual game, he naively\nblurted out that the conversation of the former commissary of police\namused him almost as much as dominoes.\n\nDuring the four years, or thereabouts, that the Michauds and Grivet had\nbeen in the habit of passing the Thursday evenings at the Raquins\u00e2\u0080\u0099, they\nhad not once felt fatigued at these monotonous evenings that returned\nwith enervating regularity. Never had they for an instant suspected the\ndrama that was being performed in this house, so peaceful and harmonious\nwhen they entered it. Olivier, with the jest of a person connected with\nthe police, was in the habit of remarking that the dining-room savoured\nof the honest man. Grivet, so as to have his say, had called the place\nthe Temple of Peace.\n\nLatterly, on two or three different occasions, Therese explained the\nbruises disfiguring her face, by telling the guests she had fallen down.\nBut none of them, for that matter, would have recognised the marks of\nthe fist of Laurent; they were convinced as to their hosts being a model\npair, replete with sweetness and love.\n\nThe paralysed woman had not made any fresh attempt to reveal to them\nthe infamy concealed behind the dreary tranquillity of the Thursday\nevenings. An eye-witness of the tortures of the murderers, and\nforeseeing the crisis which would burst out, one day or another, brought\non by the fatal succession of events, she at length understood that\nthere was no necessity for her intervention. And from that moment, she\nremained in the background allowing the consequences of the murder of\nCamille, which were to kill the assassins in their turn, to take their\ncourse. She only prayed heaven, to grant her sufficient life to enable\nher to be present at the violent catastrophe she foresaw; her only\nremaining desire was to feast her eyes on the supreme suffering that\nwould undo Therese and Laurent.\n\nOn this particular evening, Grivet went and seated himself beside her,\nand talked for a long time, he, as usual, asking the questions and\nsupplying the answers himself. But he failed to get even a glance from\nher. When half-past eleven struck, the guests quickly rose to their\nfeet.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe are so comfortable with you,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Grivet, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat no one ever thinks\nof leaving.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe fact is,\u00e2\u0080\u009d remarked Michaud by way of supporting the old clerk, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\nnever feel drowsy here, although I generally go to bed at nine o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nOlivier thought this a capital opportunity for introducing his little\njoke.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou see,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, displaying his yellow teeth, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthis apartment savours\nof honest people: that is why we are so comfortable here.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nGrivet, annoyed at being forestalled, began to declaim with an emphatic\ngesture:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThis room is the Temple of Peace!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nIn the meanwhile, Suzanne, who was putting on her hat, remarked to\nTherese:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI will come to-morrow morning at nine o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo,\u00e2\u0080\u009d hastened to answer the young woman in a strange, troubled tone,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cdon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t come until the afternoon I have an engagement in the morning.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe accompanied the guests into the arcade, and Laurent also went down\nwith a lamp in his hand. As soon as the married couple were alone,\nboth heaved a sigh of relief. They must have been devoured by secret\nimpatience all the evening. Since the previous day they had become more\nsombre, more anxious in presence of one another. They avoided looking at\neach other, and returned in silence to the dining-room. Their hands gave\nslight convulsive twitches, and Laurent was obliged to place the lamp on\nthe table, to avoid letting it fall.\n\nBefore putting Madame Raquin to bed they were in the habit of setting\nthe dining-room in order, of preparing a glass of sugar and water\nfor the night, of moving hither and thither about the invalid, until\neverything was ready.\n\nWhen they got upstairs on this particular occasion, they sat down an\ninstant with pale lips, and eyes gazing vaguely before them. Laurent was\nthe first to break silence:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell! Aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t we going to bed?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he inquired, as if he had just started\nfrom a dream.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, yes, we are going to bed,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Therese, shivering as though\nshe felt a violent chill.\n\nShe rose and grasped the water decanter.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLet it be,\u00e2\u0080\u009d exclaimed her husband, in a voice that he endeavoured to\nrender natural, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI will prepare the sugar and water. You attend to your\naunt.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe took the decanter of water from the hands of his wife and poured out\na glassful. Then, turning half round, he emptied the contents of the\nsmall stoneware flagon into the glass at the same time as he dropped a\nlump of sugar into it. In the meanwhile, Therese had bent down before\nthe sideboard, and grasping the kitchen knife sought to slip it into one\nof the large pockets hanging from her waist.\n\nAt the same moment, a strange sensation which comes as a warning note\nof danger, made the married couple instinctively turn their heads. They\nlooked at one another. Therese perceived the flagon in the hands of\nLaurent, and the latter caught sight of the flash of the blade in the\nfolds of the skirt of his wife.\n\nFor a few seconds they examined each other, mute and frigid, the husband\nnear the table, the wife stooping down before the sideboard. And they\nunderstood. Each of them turned icy cold, on perceiving that both\nhad the same thought. And they were overcome with pity and horror\nat mutually reading the secret design of the other on their agitated\ncountenances.\n\nMadame Raquin, feeling the catastrophe near at hand, watched them with\npiercing, fixed eyes.\n\nTherese and Laurent, all at once, burst into sobs. A supreme crisis\nundid them, cast them into the arms of one another, as weak as children.\nIt seemed to them as if something tender and sweet had awakened in their\nbreasts. They wept, without uttering a word, thinking of the vile life\nthey had led, and would still lead, if they were cowardly enough to\nlive.\n\nThen, at the recollection of the past, they felt so fatigued and\ndisgusted with themselves, that they experienced a huge desire for\nrepose, for nothingness. They exchanged a final look, a look of\nthankfulness, in presence of the knife and glass of poison. Therese took\nthe glass, half emptied it, and handed it to Laurent who drank off the\nremainder of the contents at one draught. The result was like lightning.\nThe couple fell one atop of the other, struck down, finding consolation,\nat last, in death. The mouth of the young woman rested on the scar that\nthe teeth of Camille had left on the neck of her husband.\n\nThe corpses lay all night, spread out contorted, on the dining-room\nfloor, lit up by the yellow gleams from the lamp, which the shade cast\nupon them. And for nearly twelve hours, in fact until the following day\nat about noon, Madame Raquin, rigid and mute, contemplated them at her\nfeet, overwhelming them with her heavy gaze, and unable to sufficiently\ngorge her eyes with the hideous sight.\n\n\n\nAFTERWORD\n\nThe idea of the plot of \u00e2\u0080\u009cTherese Raquin,\u00e2\u0080\u009d according to M. Paul Alexis,\nZola\u00e2\u0080\u0099s biographer, came from a novel called \u00e2\u0080\u009cLa Venus de Gordes\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n contributed to the \u00e2\u0080\u009cFigaro\u00e2\u0080\u009d by Adolphe Belot and Ernest Daudet--the\nbrother of Alphonse Daudet--in collaboration. In this story the authors\ndealt with the murder of a man by his wife and her paramour, followed by\nthe trial of the murderers at the assizes. Zola, in noticing the book in\nthe \u00e2\u0080\u009cFigaro,\u00e2\u0080\u009d when it arrived for review, pointed out that a much more\npowerful story might be written on the same subject by invoking divine\ninstead of human justice. For instance, showing the two murderers safe\nfrom earthly consequences, yet separated by the pool of blood between\nthem, haunted by their crime, and detesting one another for the deed\ndone together.\n\nIt then occurred to Zola to write the tale on these lines himself.\nConvinced that the idea was good, he elaborated it with the greatest\ncare and all the skill at his command, the result being that he produced\na volume which proved his first genuine success, and which is still\nconsidered by many to be his very best book.\n\nEDWARD VIZETELLY\n\nSURBITON, 1 December, 1901.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Therese Raquin, by Emile Zola\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THERESE RAQUIN ***\n\n***** This file should be named 6626-0.txt or 6626-0.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/6\/6\/2\/6626\/\n\nProduced by Dagny; John Bickers; David Widger\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http:\/\/www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http:\/\/pglaf.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":723,"split":"train"}
