{"ori_id":"21f3fcbf22d864a5d6a0c3830df19459d402706c","title":"Penguin Island (novel)","context":"Penguin Island (novel)\n Penguin Island is written in the style of a sprawling 18th- and 19th-century history book, concerned with grand metanarratives, mythologizing heroes, hagiography and romantic nationalism. It is about a fictitious island, inhabited by great auks, that existed off the northern coast of Europe. The history begins when a wayward Christian missionary monk lands on the island and perceives the upright, unafraid auks as a sort of pre-Christian society of noble pagans. Mostly blind and somewhat deaf, having mistaken the animals for humans, he baptizes them. This causes a problem for The Lord, who normally only allows humans to be baptized. After consulting with saints and theologians in Heaven, He resolves the dilemma by converting the baptized birds to humans with only a few physical traces of their ornithological origin, and giving them each a soul.\nThus begins the history of Penguinia, and from there forward the history mirrors that of France (and more generally of Western Europe, including German-speaking areas and the British Isles). The narrative spans from the Migration Period (\"Dark Ages\"), when the Germanic tribes fought incessantly among themselves for territory; to the heroic Early Middle Ages with the rise of Charlemagne (\"Draco the Great\") and conflicts with Viking raiders (\"porpoises\"); through the Renaissance (Erasmus); and up to the modern era with motor cars; and even into a future time in which a thriving high-tech civilization is destroyed by a campaign of terrorist bombings, and everything begins again in an endless cycle.\nThe longest-running plot thread, and probably the best known, satirizes the Dreyfus affair \u00e2\u0080\u0094 though both brief and complex satires of European history, politics, philosophy and theology are present throughout the novel. At various points, real historical figures such as Columba and Saint Augustine are part of the story, as well as fictionalized characters who represent historical people. Penguin Island is a satire on society and human nature in which morals, customs, and the origin of religion and laws are lampooned. For example, the origin of private property is presented as starting with the brutal and shameless murder of a farmer, and the seizure of his land, by a physically larger and stronger neighbour.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg EBook of Penguin Island, by Anatole France\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

LIFE OF SAINT MAEL\n\nMael, a scion of a royal family of Cambria, was sent in his ninth year\nto the Abbey of Yvern so that he might there study both sacred and\nprofane learning. At the age of fourteen he renounced his patrimony and\ntook a vow to serve the Lord. His time was divided, according to the\nrule, between the singing of hymns, the study of grammar, and the\nmeditation of eternal truths.\n\nA celestial perfume soon disclosed the virtues of the monk throughout\nthe cloister, and when the blessed Gal, the Abbot of Yvern, departed\nfrom this world into the next, young Mael succeeded him in the\ngovernment of the monastery. He established therein a school, an\ninfirmary, a guest-house, a forge, work-shops of all kinds, and sheds\nfor building ships, and he compelled the monks to till the lands in the\nneighbourhood. With his own hands he cultivated the garden of the Abbey,\nhe worked in metals, he instructed the novices, and his life was gently\ngliding along like a stream that reflects the heaven and fertilizes the\nfields.\n\nAt the close of the day this servant of God was accustomed to seat\nhimself on the cliff, in the place that is to-day still called St.\nMael's chair. At his feet the rocks bristling with green seaweed and\ntawny wrack seemed like black dragons as they faced the foam of the\nwaves with their monstrous breasts. He watched the sun descending into\nthe ocean like a red Host whose glorious blood gave a purple tone to the\nclouds and to the summits of the waves. And the holy man saw in this the\nimage of the mystery of the Cross, by which the divine blood has clothed\nthe earth with a royal purple. In the offing a line of dark blue marked\nthe shores of the island of Gad, where St. Bridget, who had been given\nthe veil by St. Malo, ruled over a convent of women.\n\nNow Bridget, knowing the merits of the venerable Mael, begged from\nhim some work of his hands as a rich present. Mael cast a hand-bell of\nbronze for her and, when it was finished, he blessed it and threw it\ninto the sea. And the bell went ringing towards the coast of Gad, where\nSt. Bridget, warned by the sound of the bell upon the waves, received it\npiously, and carried it in solemn procession with singing of psalms into\nthe chapel of the convent.\n\nThus the holy Mael advanced from virtue to virtue. He had already passed\nthrough two-thirds of the way of life, and he hoped peacefully to reach\nhis terrestrial end in the midst of his spiritual brethren, when he knew\nby a certain sign that the Divine wisdom had decided otherwise, and\nthat the Lord was calling him to less peaceful but not less meritorious\nlabours.\n\n\n\n\nII. THE APOSTOLICAL VOCATION OF SAINT MAEL\n\nOne day as he walked in meditation to the furthest point of a tranquil\nbeach, for which rocks jutting out into the sea formed a rugged dam, he\nsaw a trough of stone which floated like a boat upon the waters.\n\nIt was in a vessel similar to this that St. Guirec, the great St.\nColumba, and so many holy men from Scotland and from Ireland had gone\nforth to evangelize Armorica. More recently still, St. Avoye having come\nfrom England, ascended the river Auray in a mortar made of rose-coloured\ngranite into which children were afterwards placed in order to make\nthem strong; St. Vouga passed from Hibernia to Cornwall on a rock whose\nfragments, preserved at Penmarch, will cure of fever such pilgrims as\nplace these splinters on their heads. St. Samson entered the Bay of St.\nMichael's Mount in a granite vessel which will one day be called St.\nSamson's basin. It is because of these facts that when he saw the stone\ntrough the holy Mael understood that the Lord intended him for the\napostolate of the pagans who still peopled the coast and the Breton\nislands.\n\nHe handed his ashen staff to the holy Budoc, thus investing him with\nthe government of the monastery. Then, furnished with bread, a barrel\nof fresh water, and the book of the Holy Gospels, he entered the stone\ntrough which carried him gently to the island of Hoedic.\n\nThis island is perpetually buffeted by the winds. In it some poor\nmen fished among the clefts of the rocks and labouriously cultivated\nvegetables in gardens full of sand and pebbles that were sheltered from\nthe wind by walls of barren stone and hedges of tamarisk. A beautiful\nfig-tree raised itself in a hollow of the island and thrust forth its\nbranches far and wide. The inhabitants of the island used to worship it.\n\nAnd the holy Mael said to them: \"You worship this tree because it is\nbeautiful. Therefore you are capable of feeling beauty. Now I come to\nreveal to you the hidden beauty.\" And he taught them the Gospel. And\nafter having instructed them, he baptized them with salt and water.\n\nThe islands of Morbihan were more numerous in those times than they are\nto-day. For since then many have been swallowed up by the sea. St. Mael\nevangelized sixty of them. Then in his granite trough he ascended the\nriver Auray. And after sailing for three hours he landed before a\nRoman house. A thin column of smoke went up from the roof. The holy man\ncrossed the threshold on which there was a mosaic representing a dog\nwith its hind legs outstretched and its lips drawn back. He was welcomed\nby an old couple, Marcus Combabus and Valeria Moerens, who lived there\non the products of their lands. There was a portico round the interior\ncourt the columns of which were painted red, half their height upwards\nfrom the base. A fountain made of shells stood against the wall and\nunder the portico there rose an altar with a niche in which the master\nof the house had placed some little idols made of baked earth and\nwhitened with whitewash. Some represented winged children, others Apollo\nor Mercury, and several were in the form of a naked woman twisting her\nhair. But the holy Mael, observing those figures, discovered among them\nthe image of a young mother holding a child upon her knees.\n\nImmediately pointing to that image he said:\n\n\"That is the Virgin, the mother of God. The poet Virgil foretold her in\nSibylline verses before she was born and, in angelical tones he sang Jam\nredit et virgo. Throughout heathendom prophetic figures of her have been\nmade, like that which you, O Marcus, have placed upon this altar. And\nwithout doubt it is she who has protected your modest household. Thus it\nis that those who faithfully observe the natural law prepare themselves\nfor the knowledge of revealed truths.\"\n\nMarcus Combabus and Valeria Moerens, having been instructed by this\nspeech, were converted to the Christian faith. They received baptism\ntogether with their young freedwoman, Caelia Avitella, who was dearer to\nthem than the light of their eyes. All their tenants renounced paganism\nand were baptized on the same day.\n\nMarcus Combabus, Valeria Moerens, and Caelia Avitella led thenceforth\na life full of merit. They died in the Lord and were admitted into the\ncanon of the saints.\n\nFor thirty-seven years longer the blessed Mael evangelized the pagans\nof the inner lands. He built two hundred and eighteen chapels and\nseventy-four abbeys.\n\nNow on a certain day in the city of Vannes, when he was preaching the\nGospel, he learned that the monks of Yvern had in his absence declined\nfrom the rule of St. Gal. Immediately, with the zeal of a hen who\ngathers her brood, he repaired to his erring children. He was then\ntowards the end of his ninety-seventh year; his figure was bent, but his\narms were still strong, and his speech was poured forth abundantly like\nwinter snow in the depths of the valleys.\n\nAbbot Budoc restored the ashen staff to St. Mael and informed him of\nthe unhappy state into which the Abbey had fallen. The monks were in\ndisagreement as to the date an which the festival of Easter ought to\nbe celebrated. Some held for the Roman calendar, others for the Greek\ncalendar, and the horrors of a chronological schism distracted the\nmonastery.\n\nThere also prevailed another cause of disorder. The nuns of the island\nof Gad, sadly fallen from their former virtue, continually came in boats\nto the coast of Yvern. The monks received them in the guesthouse and\nfrom this there arose scandals which filled pious souls with desolation.\n\nHaving finished his faithful report, Abbot Budoc concluded in these\nterms:\n\n\"Since the coming of these nuns the innocence and peace of the monks are\nat an end.\"\n\n\"I readily believe it,\" answered the blessed Mael. \"For woman is a\ncleverly constructed snare by which we are taken even before we suspect\nthe trap. Alas! the delightful attraction of these creatures is exerted\nwith even greater force from a distance than when they are close at\nhand. The less they satisfy desire the more they inspire it. This is the\nreason why a poet wrote this verse to one of them:\n\n'When present I avoid thee, but when away I find thee.'\n\n\"Thus we see, my son, that the blandishments of carnal love have more\npower over hermits and monks than over men who live in the world. All\nthrough my life the demon of lust has tempted me in various ways, but\nhis strongest temptations did not come to me from meeting a woman,\nhowever beautiful and fragrant she was. They came to me from the image\nof an absent woman. Even now, though full of days and approaching my\nninety-eighth year, I am often led by the Enemy to sin against chastity,\nat least in thought. At night when I am cold in my bed and my frozen\nold bones rattle together with a dull sound I hear voices reciting the\nsecond verse of the third Book of the Kings: 'Wherefore his servants\nsaid unto him, Let there be sought for my lord the king a young virgin:\nand let her stand before the king, and let her cherish him, and let her\nlie in thy bosom, that my lord the king may get heat,' and the devil\nshows me a girl in the bloom of youth who says to me: 'I am thy Abishag;\nI am thy Shunamite. Make, O my lord, room for me in thy couch.'\n\n\"Believe me,\" added the old man, \"it is only by the special aid of\nHeaven that a monk can keep his chastity in act and in intention.\"\n\nApplying himself immediately to restore innocence and peace to the\nmonastery, he corrected the calendar according to the calculations of\nchronology and astronomy and he compelled all the monks to accept his\ndecision; he sent the women who had declined from St. Bridget's rule\nback to their convent; but far from driving them away brutally, he\ncaused them to be led to their boat with singing of psalms and litanies.\n\n\"Let us respect in them,\" he said, \"the daughters of Bridget and the\nbetrothed of the Lord. Let us beware lest we imitate the Pharisees who\naffect to despise sinners. The sin of these women and not their persons\nshould be abased, and they should be made ashamed of what they have done\nand not of what they are, for they are all creatures of God.\"\n\nAnd the holy man exhorted his monks to obey faithfully the rule of their\norder.\n\n\"When it does not yield to the rudder,\" said he to them, \"the ship\nyields to the rock.\"\n\n\n\n\nIII. THE TEMPTATION OF SAINT MAEL\n\nThe blessed Mael had scarcely restored order in the Abbey of Yvern\nbefore he learned that the inhabitants of the island of Hoedic, his\nfirst catechumens and the dearest of all to his heart, had returned to\npaganism, and that they were hanging crowns of flowers and fillets of\nwool to the branches of the sacred fig-tree.\n\nThe boatman who brought this sad news expressed a fear that soon those\nmisguided men might violently destroy the chapel that had been built on\nthe shore of their island.\n\nThe holy man resolved forthwith to visit his faithless children, so that\nhe might lead them back to the faith and prevent them from yielding to\nsuch sacrilege. As he went down to the bay where his stone trough was\nmoored, he turned his eyes to the sheds, then filled with the noise of\nsaws and of hammers, which, thirty years before, he had erected on the\nfringe of that bay for the purpose of building ships.\n\nAt that moment, the Devil, who never tires, went out from the sheds and,\nunder the appearance of a monk called Samsok, he approached the holy man\nand tempted him thus:\n\n\"Father, the inhabitants of the island of Hoedic commit sins\nunceasingly. Every moment that passes removes them farther from God.\nThey are soon going to use violence towards the chapel that you have\nraised with your own venerable hands on the shore of their island. Time\nis pressing. Do you not think that your stone trough would carry you\nmore quickly towards them if it were rigged like a boat and furnished\nwith a rudder, a mast, and a sail, for then you would be driven by the\nwind? Your arms are still strong and able to steer a small craft.\nIt would be a good thing, too, to put a sharp stem in front of your\napostolic trough. You are much too clear-sighted not to have thought of\nit already.\"\n\n\"Truly time is pressing,\" answered the holy man. \"But to do as you say,\nSamson, my son, would it not be to make myself like those men of little\nfaith who do not trust the Lord? Would it not be to despise the gifts of\nHim who has sent me this stone vessel without rigging or sail?\"\n\nThis question, the Devil, who is a great theologian, answered by\nanother.\n\n\"Father, is it praiseworthy to wait, with our arms folded, until help\ncomes from on high, and to ask everything from Him who can do all\nthings, instead of acting by human prudence and helping ourselves?\n\n\"It certainly is not,\" answered the holy Mael, \"and to neglect to act by\nhuman prudence is tempting God.\"\n\n\"Well,\" urged the Devil, \"is it not prudence in this case to rig the\nvessel?\"\n\n\"It would be prudence if we could not attain our end in any other way.\"\n\n\"Is your vessel then so very speedy?\"\n\n\"It is as speedy as God pleases.\"\n\n\"What do you know about it? It goes like Abbot Budoc's mule. It is a\nregular old tub. Are you forbidden to make it speedier?\"\n\n\"My son, clearness adorns your words, but they are unduly\nover-confident. Remember that this vessel is miraculous.\"\n\n\"It is, father. A granite trough that floats on the water like a cork\nis a miraculous trough. There is not the slightest doubt about it. What\nconclusion do you draw from that?\"\n\n\"I am greatly perplexed. Is it right to perfect so miraculous a machine\nby human and natural means?\"\n\n\"Father, if you lost your right foot and God restored it to you, would\nnot that foot be miraculous?\"\n\n\"Without doubt, my son.\"\n\n\"Would you put a shoe on it?\"\n\n\"Assuredly.\"\n\n\"Well, then, if you believe that one may cover a miraculous foot with a\nnatural shoe, you should also believe that we can put natural rigging\non a miraculous boat. That is clear. Alas! Why must the holiest persons\nhave their moments of weakness and despondency? The most illustrious of\nthe apostles of Brittany could accomplish works worthy of eternal glory\n. . . But his spirit is tardy and his hand is slothful. Farewell then,\nfather! Travel by short and slow stages and when at last you approach\nthe coast of Hoedic you will see the smoking ruins of the chapel that\nwas built and consecrated by your own hands. The pagans will have burned\nit and with it the deacon you left there. He will be as thoroughly\nroasted as a black pudding.\"\n\n\"My trouble is extreme,\" said the servant of God, drying with his sleeve\nthe sweat that gathered upon his brow. \"But tell me, Samson, my son,\nwould not rigging this stone trough be a difficult piece of work? And if\nwe undertook it might we not lose time instead of gaining it?\"\n\n\"Ah! father,\" exclaimed the Devil, \"in one turning of the hour-glass the\nthing would be done. We shall find the necessary rigging in this shed\nthat you have formerly built here on the coast and in those store-houses\nabundantly stocked through your care. I will myself regulate all the\nship's fittings. Before being a monk I was a sailor and a carpenter and\nI have worked at many other trades as well. Let us to work.\"\n\nImmediately he drew the holy man into an outhouse filled with all things\nneedful for fitting out a boat.\n\n\"That for you, father!\"\n\nAnd he placed on his shoulders the sail, the mast, the gaff, and the\nboom.\n\nThen, himself bearing a stem and a rudder with its screw and tiller, and\nseizing a carpenter's bag full of tools, he ran to the shore, dragging\nthe holy man after him by his habit. The latter was bent, sweating, and\nbreathless, under the burden of canvas and wood.\n\n\n\n\nIV. ST. MAEL'S NAVIGATION ON THE OCEAN OF ICE\n\nThe Devil, having tucked his clothes up to his arm-pits, dragged the\ntrough on the sand, and fitted the rigging in less than an hour.\n\nAs soon as the holy Mael had embarked, the vessel, with all its sails\nset, cleft through the waters with such speed that the coast was almost\nimmediately out of sight. The old man steered to the south so as to\ndouble the Land's End, but an irresistible current carried him to the\nsouth-west. He went along the southern coast of Ireland and turned\nsharply towards the north. In the evening the wind freshened. In vain\ndid Mael attempt to furl the sail. The vessel flew distractedly towards\nthe fabulous seas.\n\nBy the light of the moon the immodest sirens of the North came around\nhim with their hempen-coloured hair, raising their white throats and\ntheir rose-tinted limbs out of the sea; and beating the water into foam\nwith their emerald tails, they sang in cadence:\n\n     Whither go'st thou, gentle Mael,\n     In thy trough distracted?\n     All distended is thy sail\n     Like the breast of Juno\n     When from it gushed the Milky Way.\n\nFor a moment their harmonious laughter followed him beneath the stars,\nbut the vessel fled on, a hundred times more swiftly than the red ship\nof a Viking. And the petrels, surprised in their flight, clung with\ntheir feet to the hair of the holy man.\n\nSoon a tempest arose full of darkness and groanings, and the trough,\ndriven by a furious wind, flew like a sea-mew through the mist and the\nsurge.\n\nAfter a night of three times twenty-four hours the darkness was suddenly\nrent and the holy man discovered on the horizon a shore more dazzling\nthan diamond. The coast rapidly grew larger, and soon by the glacial\nlight of a torpid and sunken sun, Mael saw, rising above the waves,\nthe silent streets of a white city, which, vaster than Thebes with its\nhundred gates, extended as far as the eye could see the ruins of its\nforum built of snow, its palaces of frost, its crystal arches, and its\niridescent obelisks.\n\nThe ocean was covered with floating ice-bergs around which swam men of\nthe sea of a wild yet gentle appearance. And Leviathan passed by hurling\na column of water up to the clouds.\n\nMoreover, on a block of ice which floated at the same rate as the stone\ntrough there was seated a white bear holding her little one in her arms,\nand Mael heard her murmuring in a low voice this verse of Virgil, Incipe\nparve puer.\n\nAnd full of sadness and trouble, the old man wept.\n\nThe fresh water had frozen and burst the barrel that contained it. And\nMael was sucking pieces of ice to quench his thirst, and his food was\nbread dipped in dirty water. His beard and his hair were broken like\nglass. His habit was covered with a layer of ice and cut into him at\nevery movement of his limbs. Huge waves rose up and opened their foaming\njaws at the old man. Twenty times the boat was filled by masses of\nsea. And the ocean swallowed up the book of the Holy Gospels which the\napostle guarded with extreme care in a purple cover marked with a golden\ncross.\n\nNow on the thirtieth day the sea calmed. And lo! with a frightful\nclamour of sky and waters a mountain of dazzling whiteness advanced\ntowards the stone vessel. Mael steered to avoid it, but the tiller broke\nin his hands. To lessen the speed of his progress towards the rock he\nattempted to reef the sails, but when he tried to knot the reef-points\nthe wind pulled them away from him and the rope seared his hands. He saw\nthree demons with wings of black skin having hooks at their ends, who,\nhanging from the rigging, were puffing with their breath against the\nsails.\n\nUnderstanding from this sight that the Enemy had governed him in all\nthese things, he guarded himself by making the sign of the Cross.\nImmediately a furious gust of wind filled with the noise of sobs and\nhowls struck the stone trough, carried off the mast with all the sails,\nand tore away the rudder and the stem.\n\nThe trough was drifting on the sea, which had now grown calm. The holy\nman knelt and gave thanks to the Lord who had delivered him from the\nsnares of the demon. Then he recognised, sitting on a block of ice, the\nmother bear who had spoken during the storm. She pressed her beloved\nchild to her bosom, and in her hand she held a purple book marked with a\ngolden cross. Hailing the granite trough, she saluted the holy man with\nthese words:\n\n\"Pax tibi Mael.\"\n\nAnd she held out the book to him.\n\nThe holy man recognised his evangelistary, and, full of astonishment, he\nsang in the tepid air a hymn to the Creator and His creation.\n\n\n\n\nV. THE BAPTISM OF THE PENGUINS\n\nAfter having drifted for an hour the holy man approached a narrow\nstrand, shut in by steep mountains. He went along the coast for a whole\nday and a night, passing around the reef which formed an insuperable\nbarrier. He discovered in this way that it was a round island in\nthe middle of which rose a mountain crowned with clouds. He joyfully\nbreathed the fresh breath of the moist air. Rain fell, and this rain was\nso pleasant that the holy man said to the Lord:\n\n\"Lord, this is the island of tears, the island of contrition.\"\n\nThe strand was deserted. Worn out with fatigue and hunger, he sat down\non a rock in the hollow of which there lay some yellow eggs, marked with\nblack spots, and about as large as those of a swan. But he did not touch\nthem, saying:\n\n\"Birds are the living praises of God. I should not like a single one of\nthese praises to be lacking through me.\"\n\nAnd he munched the lichens which he tore from the crannies of the rocks.\n\nThe holy man had gone almost entirely round the island without meeting\nany inhabitants, when he came to a vast amphitheatre formed of black and\nred rocks whose summits became tinged with blue as they rose towards the\nclouds, and they were filled with sonorous cascades.\n\nThe reflection from the polar ice had hurt the old man's eyes, but\na feeble gleam of light still shone through his swollen eyelids. He\ndistinguished animated forms which filled the rocks, in stages, like a\ncrowd of men on the tiers of an amphitheatre. And at the same time, his\nears, deafened by the continual noises of the sea, heard a feeble sound\nof voices. Thinking that what he saw were men living under the natural\nlaw, and that the Lord had sent him to teach them the Divine law, he\npreached the gospel to them.\n\nMounted on a lofty stone in the midst of the wild circus:\n\n\"Inhabitants of this island,\" said he, \"although you be of small\nstature, you look less like a band of fishermen and mariners than like\nthe senate of a judicious republic. By your gravity, your silence, your\ntranquil deportment, you form on this wild rock an assembly comparable\nto the Conscript Fathers at Rome deliberating in the temple of Victory,\nor rather, to the philosophers of Athens disputing on the benches of the\nAreopagus. Doubtless you possess neither their science nor their genius,\nbut perhaps in the sight of God you are their superiors. I believe that\nyou are simple and good. As I went round your island I saw no image\nof murder, no sign of carnage, no enemies' heads or scalps hung from a\nlofty pole or nailed to the doors of your villages. You appear to me\nto have no arts and not to work in metals. But your hearts are pure\nand your hands are innocent, and the truth will easily enter into your\nsouls.\"\n\nNow what he had taken for men of small stature but of grave bearing were\npenguins whom the spring had gathered together, and who were ranged in\ncouples on the natural steps of the rock, erect in the majesty of their\nlarge white bellies. From moment to moment they moved their winglets\nlike arms, and uttered peaceful cries. They did not fear men, for they\ndid not know them, and had never received any harm from them; and there\nwas in the monk a certain gentleness that reassured the most timid\nanimals and that pleased these penguins extremely. With a friendly\ncuriosity they turned towards him their little round eyes lengthened in\nfront by a white oval spot that gave something odd and human to their\nappearance.\n\nTouched by their attention, the holy man taught them the Gospel.\n\n\"Inhabitants of this island, the earthly day that has just risen over\nyour rocks is the image of the heavenly day that rises in your souls.\nFor I bring you the inner light; I bring you the light and heat of the\nsoul. Just as the sun melts the ice of your mountains so Jesus Christ\nwill melt the ice of your hearts.\"\n\nThus the old man spoke. As everywhere throughout nature voice calls\nto voice, as all which breathes in the light of day loves alternate\nstrains, these penguins answered the old man by the sounds of their\nthroats. And their voices were soft, for it was the season of their\nloves.\n\nThe holy man, persuaded that they belonged to some idolatrous people and\nthat in their own language they gave adherence to the Christian faith,\ninvited them to receive baptism.\n\n\"I think,\" said he to them, \"that you bathe often, for all the hollows\nof the rocks are full of pure water, and as I came to your assembly I\nsaw several of you plunging into these natural baths. Now purity of body\nis the image of spiritual purity.\"\n\nAnd he taught them the origin, the nature, and the effects of baptism.\n\n\"Baptism,\" said he to them, \"is Adoption, New Birth, Regeneration,\nIllumination.\"\n\nAnd he explained each of these points to them in succession.\n\nThen, having previously blessed the water that fell from the cascades\nand recited the exorcisms, he baptized those whom he had just taught,\npouring on each of their heads a drop of pure water and pronouncing the\nsacred words.\n\nAnd thus for three days and three nights he baptized the birds.\n\n\n\n\nVI. AN ASSEMBLY IN PARADISE\n\nWhen the baptism of the penguins was known in Paradise, it caused\nneither joy nor sorrow, but an extreme surprise. The Lord himself was\nembarrassed. He gathered an assembly of clerics and doctors, and asked\nthem whether they regarded the baptism as valid.\n\n\"It is void,\" said St. Patrick.\n\n\"Why is it void?\" asked St. Gal, who had evangelized the people of\nCornwall and had trained the holy Mael for his apostolical labours.\n\n\"The sacrament of baptism,\" answered St. Patrick, \"is void when it is\ngiven to birds, just as the sacrament of marriage is void when it is\ngiven to a eunuch.\"\n\nBut St. Gal replied:\n\n\"What relation do you claim to establish between the baptism of a bird\nand the marriage of a eunuch? There is none at all. Marriage is, if I\nmay say so, a conditional, a contingent sacrament. The priest blesses an\nevent beforehand; it is evident that if the act is not consummated the\nbenediction remains without effect. That is obvious. I have known on\nearth, in the town of Antrim, a rich man named Sadoc, who, living in\nconcubinage with a woman, caused her to be the mother of nine children.\nIn his old age, yielding to my reproofs, he consented to marry her, and\nI blessed their union. Unfortunately Sadoc's great age prevented him\nfrom consummating the marriage. A short time afterwards he lost all his\nproperty, and Germaine (that was the name of the woman), not feeling\nherself able to endure poverty, asked for the annulment of a marriage\nwhich was no reality. The Pope granted her request, for it was just.\nSo much for marriage. But baptism is conferred without restrictions or\nreserves of any kind. There is no doubt about it, what the penguins have\nreceived is a sacrament.\"\n\nCalled to give his opinion, Pope St. Damascus expressed himself in these\nterms:\n\n\"In order to know if a baptism is valid and will produce its result,\nthat is to say, sanctification, it is necessary to consider who gives\nit and not who receives it. In truth, the sanctifying virtue of this\nsacrament results from the exterior act by which it is conferred,\nwithout the baptized person cooperating in his own sanctification by any\npersonal act; if it were otherwise it would not be administered to the\nnewly born. And there is no need, in order to baptize, to fulfil any\nspecial condition; it is not necessary to be in a state of grace; it\nis sufficient to have the intention of doing what the Church does, to\npronounce the consecrated words and to observe the prescribed forms. Now\nwe cannot doubt that the venerable Mael has observed these conditions.\nTherefore the penguins are baptized.\"\n\n\"Do you think so?\" asked St. Guenole. \"And what then do you believe that\nbaptism really is? Baptism is the process of regeneration by which man\nis born of water and of the spirit, for having entered the water covered\nwith crimes, he goes out of it a neophyte, a new creature, abounding in\nthe fruits of righteousness; baptism is the seed of immortality; baptism\nis the pledge of the resurrection; baptism is the burying with Christ in\nHis death and participation in His departure from the sepulchre. That\nis not a gift to bestow upon birds. Reverend Fathers, let us consider.\nBaptism washes away original sin; now the penguins were not conceived in\nsin. It removes the penalty of sin; now the penguins have not sinned.\nIt produces grace and the gift of virtues, uniting Christians to Jesus\nChrist, as the members to the body, and it is obvious to the senses that\npenguins cannot acquire the virtues of confessors, of virgins, and of\nwidows, or receive grace and be united to--\"\n\nSt. Damascus did not allow him to finish.\n\n\"That proves,\" said he warmly, \"that the baptism was useless; it does\nnot prove that it was not effective.\"\n\n\"But by this reasoning,\" said St. Guenole, \"one might baptize in the\nname of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, by aspersion or\nimmersion, not only a bird or a quadruped, but also an inanimate object,\na statue, a table, a chair, etc. That animal would be Christian, that\nidol, that table would be Christian! It is absurd!\"\n\nSt. Augustine began to speak. There was a great silence.\n\n\"I am going,\" said the ardent bishop of Hippo, \"to show you, by an\nexample, the power of formulas. It deals, it is true, with a diabolical\noperation. But if it be established that formulas taught by the Devil\nhave effect upon unintelligent animals or even on inanimate objects, how\ncan we longer doubt that the effect of the sacramental formulas extends\nto the minds of beasts and even to inert matter?\n\n\"This is the example. There was during my lifetime in the town of\nMadaura, the birthplace of the philosopher Apuleius, a witch who was\nable to attract men to her chamber by burning a few of their hairs along\nwith certain herbs upon her tripod, pronouncing at the same time certain\nwords. Now one day when she wished by this means to gain the love of a\nyoung man, she was deceived by her maid, and instead of the young man's\nhairs, she burned some hairs pulled from a leather bottle, made out of\na goatskin that hung in a tavern. During the night the leather bottle,\nfull of wine, capered through the town up to the witch's door. This fact\nis undoubted. And in sacraments as in enchantments it is the form which\noperates. The effect of a divine formula cannot be less in power and\nextent than the effect of an infernal formula.\"\n\nHaving spoken in this fashion the great St. Augustine sat down amidst\napplause.\n\nOne of the blessed, of an advanced age and having a melancholy\nappearance, asked permission to speak. No one knew him. His name was\nProbus, and he was not enrolled in the canon of the saints.\n\n\"I beg the company's pardon,\" said he, \"I have no halo, and I gained\neternal blessedness without any eminent distinction. But after what the\ngreat St. Augustine has just told you I believe it right to impart a\ncruel experience, which I had, relative to the conditions necessary for\nthe validity of a sacrament. The bishop of Hippo is indeed right in what\nhe said. A sacrament depends on the form; its virtue is in its form;\nits vice is in its form. Listen, confessors and pontiffs, to my woeful\nstory. I was a priest in Rome under the rule of the Emperor Gordianus.\nWithout desiring to recommend myself to you for any special merit, I may\nsay that I exercised my priesthood with piety and zeal. For forty years\nI served the church of St. Modestus-beyond-the-Walls. My habits were\nregular. Every Saturday I went to a tavern-keeper called Barjas, who\ndwelt with his wine-jars under the Porta Capena, and from him I bought\nthe wine that I consecrated daily throughout the week. During that long\nspace of time I never failed for a single morning to consecrate the holy\nsacrifice of the mass. However, I had no joy, and it was with a heart\noppressed by sorrow that, on the steps of the altar I used to ask, 'Why\nart thou so heavy, O my soul, and why art thou so disquieted within\nme?' The faithful whom I invited to the holy table gave me cause for\naffliction, for having, so to speak, the Host that I administered still\nupon their tongues, they fell again into sin just as if the sacrament\nhad been without power or efficacy. At last I reached the end of my\nearthly trials, and failing asleep in the Lord, I awoke in this abode\nof the elect. I learned then from the mouth of the angel who brought me\nhere, that Barjas, the tavern-keeper of the Porta Capena, had sold for\nwine a decoction of roots and barks in which there was not a single drop\nof the juice of the grape. I had been unable to transmute this vile\nbrew into blood, for it was not wine, and wine alone is changed into the\nblood of Jesus Christ. Therefore all my consecrations were invalid, and\nunknown to us, my faithful and myself had for forty years been deprived\nof the sacrament and were in fact in a state of excommunication. This\nrevelation threw me into a stupor which overwhelms me even to-day in\nthis abode of bliss. I go all through Paradise without ever meeting\na single one of those Christians whom formerly I admitted to the holy\ntable in the basilica of the blessed Modestus. Deprived of the bread of\nangels, they easily gave way to the most abominable vices, and they have\nall gone to hell. It gives me some satisfaction to think that Barjas,\nthe tavern-keeper, is damned. There is in these things a logic worthy of\nthe author of all logic. Nevertheless my unhappy example proves that it\nis sometimes inconvenient that form should prevail over essence in the\nsacraments, and I humbly ask, Could not, eternal wisdom remedy this?\"\n\n\"No,\" answered the Lord. \"The remedy would be worse than the disease.\nIt would be the ruin of the priesthood if essence prevailed over form in\nthe laws of salvation.\"\n\n\"Alas! Lord,\" sighed the humble Probus. \"Be persuaded by my humble\nexperience; as long as you reduce your sacraments to formulas your\njustice will meet with terrible obstacles.\"\n\n\"I know that better than you do,\" replied the Lord. \"I see in a single\nglance both the actual problems which are difficult, and the future\nproblems which will not be less difficult. Thus I can foretell that when\nthe sun will have turned round the earth two hundred and forty times\nmore.\n\n\"Sublime language,\" exclaimed the angels.\n\n\"And worthy of the creator of the world,\" answered the pontiffs.\n\n\"It is,\" resumed the Lord, \"a manner of speaking in accordance with\nmy old cosmogony and one which I cannot give up without losing my\nimmutability. . . .\n\n\"After the sun, then, will have turned another two hundred and forty\ntimes round the earth, there will not be a single cleric left in Rome\nwho knows Latin. When they sing their litanies in the churches people\nwill invoke Orichel, Roguel, and Totichel, and, as you know, these are\ndevils and not angels. Many robbers desiring to make their communions,\nbut fearing that before obtaining pardon they would be forced to give up\nthe things they had robbed to the Church, will make their confessions\nto travelling priests, who, ignorant of both Italian and Latin, and only\nspeaking the patois of their village, will go through cities and towns\nselling the remission of sins for a base price, often for a bottle of\nwine. Probably we shall not be inconvenienced by those absolutions as\nthey will want contrition to make them valid, but it may be that their\nbaptisms will cause us some embarrassment. The priests will become so\nignorant that they will baptize children in nomine patria et filia et\nspirita sancta, as Louis de Potter will take a pleasure in relating in\nthe third volume of his 'Philosophical, Political, and Critical History\nof Christianity.' It will be an arduous question to decide on the\nvalidity of such baptisms; for even if in my sacred writings I tolerate\na Greek less elegant than Plato's and a scarcely Ciceronian Latin, I\ncannot possibly admit a piece of pure patois as a liturgical formula.\nAnd one shudders when one thinks that millions of new-born babes will be\nbaptized by this method. But let us return to our penguins.\"\n\n\"Your divine words, Lord, have already led us back to them,\" said\nSt. Gal. \"In the signs of religion and the laws of salvation form\nnecessarily prevails over essence, and the validity of a sacrament\nsolely depends upon its form. The whole question is whether the penguins\nhave been baptized with the proper forms. Now there is no doubt about\nthe answer.\"\n\nThe fathers and the doctors agreed, and their perplexity became only the\nmore cruel.\n\n\"The Christian state,\" said St. Cornelius, \"is not without serious\ninconveniences for a penguin. In it the birds are obliged to work out\ntheir own salvation. How can they succeed? The habits of birds are,\nin many points, contrary to the commandments of the Church, and the\npenguins have no reason for changing theirs. I mean that they are not\nintelligent enough to give up their present habits and assume better.\"\n\n\"They cannot,\" said the Lord; \"my decrees prevent them.\"\n\n\"Nevertheless,\" resumed St. Cornelius, \"in virtue of their baptism their\nactions no longer remain indifferent. Henceforth they will be good or\nbad, susceptible of merit or of demerit.\"\n\n\"That is precisely the question we have to deal with,\" said the Lord.\n\n\"I see only one solution,\" said St. Augustine. \"The penguins will go to\nhell.\"\n\n\"But they have no soul,\" observed St. Irenaeus.\n\n\"It is a pity,\" sighed Tertullian.\n\n\"It is indeed,\" resumed St. Gal. \"And I admit that my disciple, the holy\nMael, has, in his blind zeal, created great theological difficulties for\nthe Holy Spirit and introduced disorder into the economy of mysteries.\"\n\n\"He is an old blunderer,\" cried St. Adjutor of Alsace, shrugging his\nshoulders.\n\nBut the Lord cast a reproachful look on Adjutor.\n\n\"Allow me to speak,\" said he; \"the holy Mael has not intuitive knowledge\nlike you, my blessed ones. He does not see me. He is an old man burdened\nby infirmities; he is half deaf and three parts blind. You are\ntoo severe on him. However, I recognise that the situation is an\nembarrassing one.\"\n\n\"Luckily it is but a passing disorder,\" said St. Irenaeus. \"The penguins\nare baptized, but their eggs are not, and the evil will stop with the\npresent generation.\"\n\n\"Do not speak thus, Irenaeus my son,\" said the Lord. \"There are\nexceptions to the laws that men of science lay down on the earth because\nthey are imperfect and have not an exact application to nature. But\nthe laws that I establish are perfect and suffer no exception. We must\ndecide the fate of the baptized penguins without violating any divine\nlaw, and in a manner conformable to the decalogue as well as to the\ncommandments of my Church.\"\n\n\"Lord,\" said St. Gregory Nazianzen, \"give them an immortal soul.\"\n\n\"Alas! Lord, what would they do with it,\" sighed Lactantius. \"They\nhave not tuneful voices to sing your praises. They would not be able to\ncelebrate your mysteries.\"\n\n\"Without doubt,\" said St. Augustine, \"they would not observe the divine\nlaw.\"\n\n\"They could not,\" said the Lord.\n\n\"They could not,\" continued St. Augustine. \"And if, Lord, in your\nwisdom, you pour an immortal soul into them, they will burn eternally\nin hell in virtue of your adorable decrees. Thus will the transcendent\norder, that this old Welshman has disturbed, be re-established.\"\n\n\"You propose a correct solution to me, son of Monica,\" said the Lord,\n\"and one that accords with my wisdom. But it does not satisfy my mercy.\nAnd, although in my essence I am immutable, the longer I endure, the\nmore I incline to mildness. This change of character is evident to\nanyone who reads my two Testaments.\"\n\nAs the discussion continued without much light being thrown upon the\nmatter and as the blessed showed a disposition to keep repeating the\nsame thing, it was decided to consult St. Catherine of Alexandria. This\nis what was usually done in such cases. St. Catherine while on earth had\nconfounded fifty very learned doctors. She knew Plato's philosophy in\naddition to the Holy Scriptures, and she also possessed a knowledge of\nrhetoric.\n\n\n\n\nVII. AN ASSEMBLY IN PARADISE (Continuation and End)\n\nSt. Catherine entered the assembly, her head encircled by a crown of\nemeralds, sapphires, and pearls, and she was clad in a robe of cloth\nof gold. She carried at her side a blazing wheel, the image of the one\nwhose fragments had struck her persecutors.\n\nThe Lord having invited her to speak, she expressed herself in these\nterms:\n\n\"Lord, in order to solve the problem you deign to submit to me I\nshall not study the habits of animals in general nor those of birds in\nparticular. I shall only remark to the doctors, confessors, and pontiffs\ngathered in this assembly that the separation between man and animal is\nnot complete since there are monsters who proceed from both. Such are\nchimeras--half nymphs and half serpents; such are the three Gorgons and\nthe Capripeds; such are the Scyllas and the Sirens who sing in the\nsea. These have a woman's breast and a fish's tail. Such also are the\nCentaurs, men down to the waist and the remainder horses. They are a\nnoble race of monsters. One of them, as you know, was able, guided\nby the light of reason alone, to direct his steps towards eternal\nblessedness, and you sometimes see his heroic bosom prancing on the\nclouds. Chiron, the Centaur, deserved for his works on the earth\nto share the abode of the blessed; he it was who gave Achilles his\neducation; and that young hero, when he left the Centaur's hands, lived\nfor two years, dressed as a young girl, among the daughters of King\nLycomedes. He shared their games and their bed without allowing any\nsuspicion to arise that he was not a young virgin like them. Chiron,\nwho taught him such good morals, is, with the Emperor Trajan, the only\nrighteous man who obtained celestial glory by following the law of\nnature. And yet he was but half human.\n\n\"I think I have proved by this example that, to reach eternal\nblessedness, it is enough to possess some parts of humanity, always on\nthe condition that they are noble. And what Chiron, the Centaur,\ncould obtain without having been regenerated by baptism, would not the\npenguins deserve too, if they became half penguins and half men? That\nis why, Lord, I entreat you to give old Mael's penguins a human head\nand breast so that they can praise you worthily. And grant them also an\nimmortal soul--but one of small size.\"\n\nThus Catherine spoke, and the fathers, doctors, confessors, and pontiffs\nheard her with a murmur of approbation.\n\nBut St. Anthony, the Hermit, arose and stretching two red and knotty\narms towards the Most High:\n\n\"Do not so, O Lord God,\" he cried, \"in the name of your holy Paraclete,\ndo not so!\"\n\nHe spoke with such vehemence that his long white beard shook on his chin\nlike the empty nose-bag of a hungry horse.\n\n\"Lord, do not so. Birds with human heads exist already. St. Catherine\nhas told us nothing new.\"\n\n\"The imagination groups and compares; it never creates,\" replied St.\nCatherine drily.\n\n\"They exist already,\" continued St. Antony, who would listen to nothing.\n\"They are called harpies, and they are the most obscene animals in\ncreation. One day as I was having supper in the desert with the Abbot\nSt. Paul, I placed the table outside my cabin under an old sycamore\ntree. The harpies came and sat in its branches; they deafened us with\ntheir shrill cries and cast their excrement over all our food. The\nclamour of the monsters prevented me from listening to the teaching of\nthe Abbot St. Paul, and we ate birds' dung with our bread and lettuces.\nLord, it is impossible to believe that harpies could give thee worthy\npraise.\n\n\"Truly in my temptations I have seen many hybrid beings, not only\nwomen-serpents and women-fishes, but beings still more confusedly formed\nsuch as men whose bodies were made out of a pot, a bell, a clock, a\ncupboard full of food and crockery, or even out of a house with doors\nand windows through which people engaged in their domestic tasks could\nbe seen. Eternity would not suffice were I to describe all the monsters\nthat assailed me in my solitude, from whales rigged like ships to a\nshower of red insects which changed the water of my fountain into blood.\nBut none were as disgusting as the harpies whose offal polluted the\nleaves of my sycamore.\"\n\n\"Harpies,\" observed Lactantius, \"are female Monsters with birds'\nbodies. They have a woman's head and breast. Their forwardness, their\nshamelessness, and their obscenity proceed from their female nature as\nthe poet Virgil demonstrated in his 'Aeneid.' They share the curse of\nEve.\"\n\n\"Let us not speak of the curse of Eve,\" said the Lord. \"The second Eve\nhas redeemed the first.\"\n\nPaul Orosius, the author of a universal history that Bossuet was to\nimitate in later years, arose and prayed to the Lord:\n\n\"Lord, hear my prayer and Anthony's. Do not make any more monsters like\nthe Centaurs, Sirens, and Fauns, whom the Greeks, those collectors of\nfables, loved. You will derive no satisfaction from them. Those species\nof monsters have pagan inclinations and their double nature does not\ndispose them to purity of morals.\"\n\nThe bland Lactantius replied in these terms:\n\n\"He who has just spoken is assuredly the best historian in Paradise, for\nHerodotus, Thucydides, Polybius, Livy, Velleius Paterculus, Cornelius\nNepos, Suetonius, Manetho, Diodorus Siculus, Dion Cassius, and\nLampridius are deprived of the sight of God, and Tacitus suffers in hell\nthe torments that are reserved for blasphemers. But Paul Orosius does\nnot know heaven as well as he knows the earth, for he does not seem to\nbear in mind that the angels, who proceed from man and bird, are purity\nitself.\"\n\n\"We are wandering,\" said the Eternal. \"What have we to do with all those\ncentaurs, harpies, and angels? We have to deal with penguins.\"\n\n\"You have spoken to the point, Lord,\" said the chief of the fifty\ndoctors, who, during their mortal life had been confounded by the Virgin\nof Alexandria, \"and I dare express the opinion that, in order to put an\nend to the scandal by which heaven is now stirred, old Mael's penguins\nshould, as St. Catherine who confounded us has proposed, be given half\nof a human body with an eternal soul proportioned to that half.\"\n\nAt this speech there arose in the assembly a great noise of private\nconversations and disputes of the doctors. The Greek fathers argued with\nthe Latins concerning the substance, nature, and dimensions of the soul\nthat should be given to the penguins.\n\n\"Confessors and pontiffs,\" exclaimed the Lord, \"do not imitate the\nconclaves and synods of the earth. And do not bring into the Church\nTriumphant those violences that trouble the Church Militant. For it is\nbut too true that in all the councils held under the inspiration of my\nspirit, in Europe, in Asia, and in Africa, fathers have torn the\nbeards and scratched the eyes of other fathers. Nevertheless they were\ninfallible, for I was with them.\"\n\nOrder being restored, old Hermas arose and slowly uttered these words:\n\n\"I will praise you, Lord, for that you caused my mother, Saphira, to be\nborn amidst your people, in the days when the dew of heaven refreshed\nthe earth which was in travail with its Saviour. And will praise you,\nLord, for having granted to me to see with my mortal eyes the Apostles\nof your divine Son. And I will speak in this illustrious assembly\nbecause you have willed that truth should proceed out of the mouths of\nthe humble, and I will say: 'Change these penguins to men. It is the\nonly determination conformable to your justice and your mercy.'\"\n\nSeveral doctors asked permission to speak, others began to do so. No one\nlistened, and all the confessors were tumultuously shaking their palms\nand their crowns.\n\nThe Lord, by a gesture of his right hand, appeased the quarrels of his\nelect.\n\n\"Let us not deliberate any longer,\" said he. \"The opinion broached by\ngentle old Hermas is the only one conformable to my eternal designs.\nThese birds will be changed into men. I foresee in this several\ndisadvantages. Many of those men will commit sins they would not have\ncommitted as penguins. Truly their fate through this change will be\nfar less enviable than if they had been without this baptism and this\nincorporation into the family of Abraham. But my foreknowledge must not\nencroach upon their free will.\n\n\"In order not to impair human liberty, I will be ignorant of what I\nknow, I will thicken upon my eyes the veils I have pierced, and in my\nblind clearsightedness I will let myself be surprised by what I have\nforeseen.\"\n\nAnd immediately calling the archangel Raphael:\n\n\"Go and find the holy Mael,\" said he to him; \"inform him of his mistake\nand tell him, armed with my Name, to change these penguins into men.\"\n\n\n\n\nVIII. METAMORPHOSIS OF THE PENGUINS\n\nThe archangel, having gone down into the Island of the Penguins, found\nthe holy man asleep in the hollow of a rock surrounded by his new\ndisciples. He laid his hand on his shoulder and, having waked him, said\nin a gentle voice:\n\n\"Mael, fear not!\"\n\nThe holy man, dazzled by a vivid light, inebriated by a delicious\nodour, recognised the angel of the Lord, and prostrated himself with his\nforehead on the ground.\n\nThe angel continued:\n\n\"Mael, know thy error, believing that thou wert baptizing children of\nAdam thou hast baptized birds; and it is, through thee that penguins\nhave entered into the Church of God.\"\n\nAt these words the old man remained stupefied.\n\nAnd the angel resumed:\n\n\"Arise, Mael, arm thyself with the mighty Name of the Lord, and say to\nthese birds, 'Be ye men!'\"\n\nAnd the holy Mael, having wept and prayed, armed himself with the mighty\nName of the Lord and said to the birds:\n\n\"Be ye men!\"\n\nImmediately the penguins were transformed. Their foreheads enlarged and\ntheir heads grew round like the dome of St. Maria Rotunda in Rome. Their\noval eyes opened more widely on the universe; a fleshy nose clothed the\ntwo clefts of their nostrils; their beaks were changed into mouths, and\nfrom their mouths went forth speech; their necks grew short and thick;\ntheir wings became arms and their claws legs; a restless soul dwelt\nwithin the breast of each of them.\n\nHowever, there remained with them some traces of their first nature.\nThey were inclined to look sideways; they balanced themselves on their\nshort thighs; their bodies were covered with fine down.\n\nAnd Mael gave thanks to the Lord, because he had incorporated these\npenguins into the family of Abraham.\n\nBut he grieved at the thought that he would soon leave the island to\ncome back no more, and that perhaps when he was far away the faith\nof the penguins would perish for want of care like a young and tender\nplant.\n\nAnd he formed the idea of transporting their island to the coasts of\nArmorica.\n\n\"I know not the designs of eternal Wisdom,\" said he to himself. \"But if\nGod wills that this island be transported, who could prevent it?\"\n\nAnd the holy man made a very fine cord about forty feet long out of the\nflax of his stole. He fastened one end of the cord round a point of rock\nthat jutted up through the sand of the shore and, holding the other end\nof the cord in his hand, he entered the stone trough.\n\nThe trough glided over the sea and towed Penguin Island behind it; after\nnine days' sailing it approached the Breton coast, bringing the island\nwith it.\n\n\n\n\n\nBOOK II. THE ANCIENT TIMES\n\n\n\n\nI. THE FIRST CLOTHES\n\nOne day St. Mael was sitting by the seashore on a warm stone that he\nfound. He thought it had been warmed by the sun and he gave thanks\nto God for it, not knowing that the Devil had been resting on it. The\napostle was waiting for the monks of Yvern who had been commissioned to\nbring a freight of skins and fabrics to clothe the inhabitants of the\nisland of Alca.\n\nSoon he saw a monk called Magis coming ashore and carrying a chest upon\nhis back. This monk enjoyed a great reputation for holiness.\n\nWhen he had drawn near to the old man he laid the chest on the ground\nand wiping his forehead with the back of his sleeve, he said:\n\n\"Well, father, you wish then to clothe these penguins?\"\n\n\"Nothing is more needful, my son,\" said the old man. \"Since they have\nbeen incorporated into the family of Abraham these penguins share the\ncurse of Eve, and they know that they are naked, a thing of which they\nwere ignorant before. And it is high time to clothe them, for they are\nlosing the down that remained on them after their metamorphosis.\"\n\n\"It is true,\" said Magis as he cast his eyes over the coast where\nthe penguins were to be seen looking for shrimps, gathering mussels,\nsinging, or sleeping, \"they are naked. But do you not think, father,\nthat it would be better to leave them naked? Why clothe them? When they\nwear clothes and are under the moral law they will assume an immense\npride, a vile hypocrisy, and an excessive cruelty.\"\n\n\"Is it possible, my son,\" sighed the old man, \"that you understand so\nbadly the effects of the moral law to which even the heathen submit?\"\n\n\"The moral law,\" answered Magis, \"forces men who are beasts to live\notherwise than beasts, a thine that doubtless puts a constraint upon\nthem, but that also flatters and reassures them; and as they are proud,\ncowardly, and covetous of pleasure, they willingly submit to restraints\nthat tickle their vanity and on which they found both their present\nsecurity and the hope of their future happiness. That is the principle\nof all morality. . . . But let us not mislead ourselves. My companions\nare unloading their cargo of stuffs and skins on the island. Think,\nfather, while there is still time I To clothe the penguins is a very\nserious business. At present when a penguin desires a penguin he knows\nprecisely what he desires and his lust is limited by an exact knowledge\nof its object. At this moment two or three couples of penguins are\nmaking love on the beach. See with what simplicity! No one pays\nany attention and the actors themselves do not seem to be greatly\npreoccupied. But when the female penguins are clothed, the male penguin\nwill not form so exact a notion of what it is that attracts him to them.\nHis indeterminate desires will fly out into all sorts of dreams and\nillusions; in short, father, he will know love and its mad torments.\nAnd all the time the female penguins will cast down their eyes and bite\ntheir lips, and take on airs as if they kept a treasure under their\nclothes! . . . what a pity!\n\n\"The evil will be endurable as long as these people remain rude and\npoor; but only wait for a thousand years and you will see, father, with\nwhat powerful weapons you have endowed the daughters of Alca. If you\nwill allow me, I can give you some idea of it beforehand. I have some\nold clothes in this chest. Let us take at hazard one of these female\npenguins to whom the male penguins give such little thought, and let us\ndress her as well as we can.\n\n\"Here is one coming towards us. She is neither more beautiful nor\nuglier than the others; she is young. No one looks at her. She strolls\nindolently along the shore, scratching her back and with her finger\nat her nose as she walks. You cannot help seeing, father, that she has\nnarrow shoulders, clumsy breasts, a stout figure, and short legs. Her\nreddish knees pucker at every step she takes, and there is, at each of\nher joints, what looks like a little monkey's head. Her broad and sinewy\nfeet cling to the rock with their four crooked toes, while the great\ntoes stick up like the heads of two cunning serpents. She begins to\nwalk, all her muscles are engaged in the task, and, when we see them\nworking, we think of her as a machine intended for walking rather than\nas a machine intended for making love, although visibly she is both,\nand contains within herself several other pieces of machinery, besides.\nWell, venerable apostle, you will see what I am going to make of her.\"\n\nWith these words the monk, Magis, reached the female penguin in three\nbounds, lifted her up, carried her in his arms with her hair trailing\nbehind her, and threw her, overcome with fright, at the feet of the holy\nMael.\n\nAnd whilst she wept and begged him to do her no harm, he took a pair of\nsandals out of his chest and commanded her to put them on.\n\n\"Her feet,\" observed the old man, \"will appear smaller when squeezed in\nby the woollen cords. The soles, being two fingers high, will give\nan elegant length to her legs and the weight they bear will seem\nmagnified.\"\n\nAs the penguin tied on her sandals she threw a curious look towards\nthe open coffer, and seeing that it was full of jewels and finery, she\nsmiled through her tears.\n\nThe monk twisted her hair on the back of her head and covered it with\na chaplet of flowers. He encircled her wrist with golden bracelets\nand making her stand upright, he passed a large linen band beneath her\nbreasts, alleging that her bosom would thereby derive a new dignity and\nthat her sides would be compressed to the greater glory of her hips.\n\nHe fixed this band with pins, taking them one by one out of his mouth.\n\n\"You can tighten it still more,\" said the penguin.\n\nWhen he had, with much care and study, enclosed the soft parts of her\nbust in this way, he covered her whole body with a rose-coloured tunic\nwhich gently followed the lines of her figure.\n\n\"Does it hang well?\" asked the penguin.\n\nAnd bending forward with her head on one side and her chin on her\nshoulder, she kept looking attentively at the appearance of her toilet.\n\nMagis asked her if she did not think the dress a little long, but she\nanswered with assurance that it was not--she would hold it up.\n\nImmediately, taking the back of her skirt in her left hand, she drew\nit obliquely across her hips, taking care to disclose a glimpse of her\nheels. Then she went away, walking with short steps and swinging her\nhips.\n\nShe did not turn her head, but as she passed near a stream she glanced\nout of the corner of her eye at her own reflection.\n\nA male penguin, who met her by chance, stopped in surprise, and\nretracing his steps began to follow her. As she went along the shore,\nothers coming back from fishing, went up to her, and after looking at\nher, walked behind her. Those who were lying on the sand got up and\njoined the rest.\n\nUnceasingly, as she advanced, fresh penguins, descending from the paths\nof the mountain, coming out of clefts of the rocks, and emerging from\nthe water, added to the size of her retinue.\n\nAnd all of them, men of ripe age with vigorous shoulders and hairy\nbreasts, agile youths, old men shaking the multitudinous wrinkles of\ntheir rosy, and white-haired skins, or dragging their legs thinner and\ndrier than the juniper staff that served them as a third leg, hurried\non, panting and emitting an acrid odour and hoarse gasps. Yet she went\non peacefully and seemed to see nothing.\n\n\"Father,\" cried Magis, \"notice how each one advances with his nose\npointed towards the centre of gravity of that young damsel now that the\ncentre is covered by a garment. The sphere inspires the meditations\nof geometers by the number of its properties. When it proceeds from a\nphysical and living nature it acquires new qualities, and in order that\nthe interest of that figure might be fully revealed to the penguins it\nwas necessary that, ceasing to see it distinctly with their eyes, they\nshould be led to represent it to themselves in their minds. I myself\nfeel at this moment irresistibly attracted towards that penguin. Whether\nit be because her skirt gives more importance to her hips, and that in\nits simple magnificence it invests them with a synthetic and general\ncharacter and allows only the pure idea, the divine principle, of them\nto be seen, whether this be the cause I cannot say, but I feel that if\nI embraced her I would hold in my hands the heaven of human pleasure. It\nis certain that modesty communicates an invincible attraction to women.\nMy uneasiness is so great that it would be vain for me to try to conceal\nit.\"\n\nHe spoke, and, gathering up his habit, he rushed among the crowd of\npenguins, pushing, jostling, trampling, and crushing, until he reached\nthe daughter of Alca, whom he seized and suddenly carried in his arms\ninto a cave that had been hollowed out by the sea.\n\nThen the penguins felt as if the sun had gone out. And the holy Mael\nknew that the Devil had taken the features of the monk, Magis, in order\nthat he might give clothes to the daughter of Alca. He was troubled in\nspirit, and his soul was sad. As with slow steps he went towards his\nhermitage he saw the little penguins of six and seven years of age\ntightening their waists with belts made of sea-weed and walking along\nthe shore to see if anybody would follow them.\n\n\n\n\nII. THE FIRST CLOTHES (Continuation and End)\n\nThe holy Mael felt a profound sadness that the first clothes put upon\na daughter of Alca should have betrayed the penguin modesty instead of\nhelping it. He persisted, none the less, in his design of giving clothes\nto the inhabitants of the miraculous island. Assembling them on the\nshore, he distributed to them the garments that the monks of Yvern\nhad brought. The male penguins received short tunics and breeches, the\nfemale penguins long robes. But these robes were far from creating the\neffect that the former one had produced. They were not so beautiful,\ntheir shape was uncouth and without art, and no attention was paid to\nthem since every woman bad one. As they prepared the meals and worked\nin the fields they soon had nothing but slovenly bodices and soiled\npetticoats.\n\nThe male penguins loaded their unfortunate consorts with work until they\nlooked like beasts of burden. They knew nothing of the troubles of the\nheart and the disorders of passion. Their habits were innocent. Incest,\nthough frequent, was a sign of rustic simplicity and if drunkenness led\na youth to commit some such crime he thought nothing more about it the\nday afterwards.\n\n\n\n\nIII. SETTING BOUNDS TO THE FIELDS AND THE ORIGIN OF PROPERTY\n\nThe island did not preserve the rugged appearance that it had formerly,\nwhen, in the midst of floating icebergs it sheltered a population of\nbirds within its rocky amphitheatre. Its snow-clad peak had sunk\ndown into a hill from the summit of which one could see the coasts of\nArmorica eternally covered with mist, and the ocean strewn with sullen\nreefs like monsters half raised out of its depths.\n\nIts coasts were now very extensive and clearly defined and its shape\nreminded one of a mulberry leaf. It was suddenly covered with coarse\ngrass, pleasing to the flocks, and with willows, ancient figtrees, and\nmighty oaks. This fact is attested by the Venerable Bede and several\nother authors worthy of credence.\n\nTo the north the shore formed a deep bay that in after years became one\nof the most famous ports in the universe. To the east, along a rocky\ncoast beaten by a foaming sea, there stretched a deserted and fragrant\nheath. It was the Beach of Shadows, and the inhabitants of the island\nnever ventured on it for fear of the serpents that lodged in the hollows\nof the rocks and lest they might encounter the souls of the dead who\nresembled livid flames. To the south, orchards and woods bounded the\nlanguid Bay of Divers. On this fortunate shore old Mael built a wooden\nchurch and a monastery. To the west, two streams, the Clange and the\nSurelle, watered the fertile valleys of Dalles and Dombes.\n\nNow one autumn morning, as the blessed Mael was walking in the valley of\nClange in company with a monk of Yvern called Bulloch, he saw bands of\nfierce-looking men loaded with stones passing along the roads. At the\nsame time he heard in all directions cries and complaints mounting up\nfrom the valley towards the tranquil sky.\n\nAnd he said to Bulloch:\n\n\"I notice with sadness, my son, that since they became men the\ninhabitants of this island act with less wisdom than formerly. When they\nwere birds they only quarrelled during the season of their love affairs.\nBut now they dispute all the time; they pick quarrels with each other\nin summer as well as in winter. How greatly have they fallen from that\npeaceful majesty which made the assembly of the penguins look like the\nSenate of a wise republic!\n\n\"Look towards Surelle, Bulloch, my son. In yonder pleasant valley a\ndozen men penguins are busy knocking each other down with the spades and\npicks that they might employ better in tilling the ground. The women,\nstill more cruel than the men, are tearing their opponents' faces with\ntheir nails. Alas! Bulloch, my son, why are they murdering each other in\nthis way?\"\n\n\"From a spirit of fellowship, father, and through forethought for\nthe future,\" answered Bulloch. \"For man is essentially provident and\nsociable. Such is his character and it is impossible to imagine it apart\nfrom a certain appropriation of things. Those penguins whom you see are\ndividing the ground among themselves.\"\n\n\"Could they not divide it with less violence?\" asked the aged man. \"As\nthey fight they exchange invectives and threats. I do not distinguish\ntheir words, but they are angry ones, judging from the tone.\"\n\n\"They are accusing one another of theft and encroachment,\" answered\nBulloch. \"That is the general sense of their speech.\"\n\nAt that moment the holy Mael clasped his hands and sighed deeply.\n\n\"Do you see, my son,\" he exclaimed, \"that madman who with his teeth is\nbiting the nose of the adversary he has overthrown and that other one\nwho is pounding a woman's head with a huge stone?\"\n\n\"I see them,\" said Bulloch. \"They are creating law; they are founding\nproperty; they are establishing the principles of civilization, the\nbasis of society, and the foundations of the State.\"\n\n\"How is that?\" asked old Mael.\n\n\"By setting bounds to their fields. That is the origin of all\ngovernment. Your penguins, O Master, are performing the most august\nof functions. Throughout the ages their work will be consecrated by\nlawyers, and magistrates will confirm it.\"\n\nWhilst the monk, Bulloch, was pronouncing these words a big penguin with\na fair skin and red hair went down into the valley carrying a trunk of a\ntree upon his shoulder. He went up to a little penguin who was watering\nhis vegetables in the heat of the sun, and shouted to him:\n\n\"Your field is mine!\"\n\nAnd having delivered himself of this stout utterance he brought down\nhis club on the head of the little penguin, who fell dead upon the field\nthat his own hands had tilled.\n\nAt this sight the holy Mael shuddered through his whole body and poured\nforth a flood of tears.\n\nAnd in a voice stifled by horror and fear he addressed this prayer to\nheaven:\n\n\"O Lord, my God, O thou who didst receive young Abel's sacrifices, thou\nwho didst curse Cain, avenge, O Lord, this innocent penguin sacrificed\nupon his own field and make the murderer feel the weight of thy arm.\nIs there a more odious crime, is there a graver offence against thy\njustice, O Lord, than this murder and this robbery?\"\n\n\"Take care, father,\" said Bulloch gently, \"that what you call murder and\nrobbery may not really be war and conquest, those sacred foundations\nof empires, those sources of all human virtues and all human greatness.\nReflect, above all, that in blaming the big penguin you are attacking\nproperty in its origin and in its source. I shall have no trouble\nin showing you how. To till the land is one thing, to possess it is\nanother, and these two things must not be confused; as regards ownership\nthe right of the first occupier is uncertain and badly founded. The\nright of conquest, on the other hand, rests on more solid foundations.\nIt is the only right that receives respect since it is the only one that\nmakes itself respected. The sole and proud origin of property is force.\nIt is born and preserved by force. In that it is august and yields\nonly to a greater force. This is why it is correct to say that he\nwho possesses is noble. And that big red man, when he knocked down a\nlabourer to get possession of his field, founded at that moment a very\nnoble house upon this earth. I congratulate him upon it.\"\n\nHaving thus spoken, Bulloch approached the big penguin, who was leaning\nupon his club as he stood in the blood-stained furrow:\n\n\"Lord Greatauk, dreaded Prince,\" said he, bowing to the ground, \"I\ncome to pay you the homage due to the founder of legitimate power and\nhereditary wealth. The skull of the vile Penguin you have overthrown\nwill, buried in your field, attest for ever the sacred rights of your\nposterity over this soil that you have ennobled. Blessed be your suns\nand your sons' sons! They shall be Greatauks, Dukes of Skull, and they\nshall rule over this island of Alca.\"\n\nThen raising his voice and turning towards the holy Mael:\n\n\"Bless Greatauk, father, for all power comes from God.\"\n\nMael remained silent and motionless, with his eyes raised towards\nheaven; he felt a painful uncertainty in judging the monk Bulloch's\ndoctrine. It was, however, the doctrine destined to prevail in epochs of\nadvanced civilization. Bulloch can be considered as the creator of civil\nlaw in Penguinia.\n\n\n\n\nIV. THE FIRST ASSEMBLY OF THE ESTATES OF PENGUINIA\n\n\"Bulloch, my son,\" said old Mael, \"we ought to make a census of the\nPenguins and inscribe each of their names in a book.\"\n\n\"It is a most urgent matter,\" answered Bulloch, \"there can be no good\ngovernment without it.\"\n\nForthwith, the apostle, with the help of twelve monks, proceeded to make\na census of the people.\n\nAnd old Mael then said:\n\n\"Now that we keep a register of all the inhabitants, we ought, Bulloch,\nmy son, to levy a just tax so as to provide for public expenses and\nthe maintenance of the Abbey. Each ought to contribute according to his\nmeans. For this reason, my son, call together the Elders of Alca, and in\nagreement with them we shall establish the tax.\"\n\nThe Elders, being called together, assembled to the number of thirty\nunder the great sycamore in the courtyard of the wooden monastery.\nThey were the first Estates of Penguinia. Three-fourths of them were\nsubstantial peasants of Surelle and Clange. Greatauk, as the noblest of\nthe Penguins, sat upon the highest stone.\n\nThe venerable Mael took his place in the midst of his monks and uttered\nthese words:\n\n\"Children, the Lord when he pleases grants riches to men and he\ntakes them away from them. Now I have called you together to levy\ncontributions from the people so as to provide for public expenses and\nthe maintenance of the monks. I consider that these contributions\nought to be in proportion to the wealth of each. Therefore he who has a\nhundred oxen will give ten; he who has ten will give one.\"\n\nWhen the holy man had spoken, Morio, a labourer at Anis-on-the-Clange,\none of the richest of the Penguins, rose up and said:\n\n\"O Father Mael, I think it right that each should contribute to the\npublic expenses and to the support of the Church, on my part I am ready\nto give up all that I possess in the interest of my brother Penguins,\nand if it were necessary I would even cheerfully part with my shirt. All\nthe elders of the people are ready, like me, to sacrifice their goods,\nand no one can doubt their absolute devotion to their country and their\ncreed. We have, then, only to consider the public interest and to do\nwhat it requires. Now, Father, what it requires, what it demands, is not\nto ask much from those who possess much, for then the rich would be less\nrich and the poor still poorer. The poor live on the wealth of the rich\nand that is the reason why that wealth is sacred. Do not touch it, to do\nso would be an uncalled for evil. You will get no great profit by taking\nfrom the rich, for they are very few in number; on the contrary you will\nstrip yourself of all your resources and plunge the country into misery.\nWhereas if you ask a little from each inhabitant without regard to his\nwealth, you will collect enough for the public necessities and you will\nhave no need to enquire into each citizen's resources, a thing that\nwould be regarded by all as a most vexatious measure. By taxing all\nequally and easily you will spare the poor, for you Will leave them\nthe wealth of the rich. And how could you possibly proportion taxes to\nwealth? Yesterday I had two hundred oxen, to-day I have sixty, to-morrow\nI shall have a hundred. Clunic has three cows, but they are thin; Nicclu\nhas only two, but they are fat. Which is the richer, Clunic or Nicclu?\nThe signs of opulence are deceitful. What is certain is that everyone\neats and drinks. Tax people according to what they consume. That would\nbe wisdom and it would be justice.\"\n\nThus spoke Morio amid the applause of the Elders.\n\n\"I ask that this speech be graven on bronze,\" cried the monk, Bulloch.\n\"It is spoken for the future; in fifteen hundred years the best of the\nPenguins will not speak otherwise.\"\n\nThe Elders were still applauding when Greatauk, his hand on the pommel\nof his sword, made this brief declaration:\n\n\"Being noble, I shall not contribute; for to contribute is ignoble. It\nis for the rabble to pay.\"\n\nAfter this warning the Elders separated in silence.\n\nAs in Rome, a new census was taken every five years; and by this means\nit was observed that the population increased rapidly. Although children\ndied in marvellous abundance and plagues and famines came with perfect\nregularity to devastate entire villages, new Penguins, in continually\ngreater numbers, contributed by their private misery to the public\nprosperity.\n\n\n\n\nV. THE MARRIAGE OF KRAKEN AND ORBEROSIA\n\nDuring these times there lived in the island of Alca a Penguin whose arm\nwas strong and whose mind was subtle. He was called Kraken, and had his\ndwelling on the Beach of Shadows whither the inhabitants never ventured\nfor fear of serpents that lodged in the hollows of the rocks and\nlest they might encounter the souls of Penguins that had died without\nbaptism. These, in appearance like livid flames, and uttering doleful\ngroans, wandered night and day along the deserted beach. For it was\ngenerally believed, though without proof, that among the Penguins that\nhad been changed into men at the blessed Mael's prayer, several had\nnot received baptism and returned after their death to lament amid the\ntempests. Kraken dwelt on this savage coast in an inaccessible cavern.\nThe only way to it was through a natural tunnel a hundred feet long, the\nentrance of which was concealed by a thick wood. One evening as Kraken\nwas walking through this deserted plain he happened to meet a young and\ncharming woman Penguin. She was the one that the monk Magis had clothed\nwith his own hands and thus was the first to have worn the garments\nof chastity. In remembrance of the day when the astonished crowd of\nPenguins had seen her moving gloriously in her robe tinted like the\ndawn, this maiden had received the name of Orberosia.*\n\n     * \"Orb, poetically, a globe when speaking of the heavenly\n     bodies. By extension any species of globular body.\"--Littre\n\nAt the sight of Kraken she uttered a cry of alarm and darted forward to\nescape from him. But the hero seized her by the garments that floated\nbehind, her, and addressed her in these words:\n\n\"Damsel, tell me thy name, thy family and thy country.\"\n\nBut Orberosia kept looking at Kraken with alarm.\n\n\"Is it you, I see, sir,\" she asked him, trembling, \"or is it not rather\nyour troubled spirit?\"\n\nShe spoke in this way because the inhabitants of Alca, having no news of\nKraken since he went to live on the Beach of Shadows, believed that he\nhad died and descended among the demons of night.\n\n\"Cease to fear, daughter of Alca,\" answered Kraken. \"He who speaks to\nthee is not a wandering spirit, but a man full of strength and might. I\nshall soon possess great riches.\"\n\nAnd young Orberosia asked:\n\n\"How dost thou think of acquiring great riches, O Kraken, since thou art\na child of Penguins?\"\n\n\"By my intelligence,\" answered Kraken.\n\n\"I know,\" said Orberosia, \"that in the time that thou dwelt among us\nthou wert renowned for thy skill in hunting and fishing. No one equalled\nthee in taking fishes in a net or in piercing with thy arrows the\nswift-flying birds.\"\n\n\"It was but a vulgar and laborious industry, O maiden. I have found a\nmeans of gaining much wealth for myself without fatigue. But tell me who\nthou art?\"\n\n\"I am called Orberosia,\" answered the young girl.\n\n\"Why art thou so far away from thy dwelling and in the night?\"\n\n\"Kraken, it was not without the will of Heaven.\"\n\n\"What meanest thou, Orberosia?\"\n\n\"That Heaven, O Kraken, placed me in thy path, for what reason I know\nnot.\"\n\nKraken beheld her for a long time in silence.\n\nThen he said with gentleness:\n\n\"Orberosia, come into my house; it is that of the bravest and most\ningenious of the sons of the Penguins. If thou art willing to follow me,\nI will make thee my companion.\"\n\nThen casting down her eyes, she murmured:\n\n\"I will follow thee, master.\"\n\nIt is thus that the fair Orberosia became the consort of the hero\nKraken. This marriage was not celebrated with songs and torches because\nKraken did not consent to show himself to the people of the Penguins;\nbut hidden in his cave he planned great designs.\n\n\n\n\nVI. THE DRAGON OF ALCA\n\n\"We afterwards went to visit the cabinet of natural history. . . . The\ncare-taker showed us a sort of packet bound in straw that he told us\ncontained the skeleton of a dragon; a proof, added he, that the dragon\nis not a fabulous animal.\"--Memoirs of Jacques Casanova, Paris, 1843.\nVol. IV., pp. 404, 405\n\nIn the meantime the inhabitants of Alca practised the labours of peace.\nThose of the northern coast went in boats to fish or to search for\nshell-fish. The labourers of Dombes cultivated oats, rye, and wheat.\nThe rich Penguins of the valley of Dalles reared domestic animals,\nwhile those of the Bay of Divers cultivated their orchards. Merchants of\nPort-Alca carried on a trade in salt fish with Armorica and the gold\nof the two Britains, which began to be introduced into the island,\nfacilitated exchange. The Penguin people were enjoying the fruit of\ntheir labours in perfect tranquillity when suddenly a sinister rumour\nran from village to village. It was said everywhere that frightful\ndragon had ravaged two farms in the Bay of Divers.\n\nA few days before, the maiden Orberosia had disappeared. Her absence had\nat first caused no uneasiness because on several occasions she had been\ncarried off by violent men who were consumed with love. And thoughtful\npeople were not astonished at this, reflecting that the maiden was the\nmost beautiful of the Penguins. It was even remarked that she sometimes\nwent to meet her ravishers, for none of us can escape his destiny. But\nthis time, as she did not return, it was feared that the dragon had\ndevoured her. The more so as the inhabitants of the valley of Dalles\nsoon knew that the dragon was not a fable told by the women around the\nfountains. For one night the monster devoured out of the village of Anis\nsix hens, a sheep, and a young orphan child called little Elo. The next\nmorning nothing was to be found either of the animals or of the child.\n\nImmediately the Elders of the village assembled in the public place and\nseated themselves on the stone bench to take counsel concerning what it\nwas expedient to do in these terrible circumstances.\n\nHaving called all those Penguins who had seen the dragon during the\ndisastrous night, they asked them:\n\n\"Have you not noticed his form and his behaviour?\"\n\nAnd each answered in his turn:\n\n\"He has the claws of a lion, the wings of an eagle, and the tail of a\nserpent.\"\n\n\"His back bristles with thorny crests.\"\n\n\"His whole body is covered with yellow scales.\"\n\n\"His look fascinates and confounds. He vomits flames.\"\n\n\"He poisons the air with his breath.\"\n\n\"He has the head of a dragon, the claws of a lion, and the tail of a\nfish.\"\n\nAnd a woman of Anis, who was regarded as intelligent and of sound\njudgment and from whom the dragon had taken three hens, deposed as\nfollows:\n\n\"He is formed like a man. The proof is that I thought he was my husband,\nand I said to him, 'Come to bed, you old fool.'\"\n\nOthers said:\n\n\"He is formed like a cloud.\"\n\n\"He looks like a mountain.\"\n\nAnd a little child came and said:\n\n\"I saw the dragon taking off his head in the barn so that he might give\na kiss to my sister Minnie.\"\n\nAnd the Elders also asked the inhabitants:\n\n\"How big is the dragon?\"\n\nAnd it was answered:\n\n\"As big as an ox.\"\n\n\"Like the big merchant ships of the Bretons.\"\n\n\"He is the height of a man.\"\n\n\"He is higher than the fig-tree under which you are sitting.\"\n\n\"He is as large as a dog.\"\n\nQuestioned finally on his colour, the inhabitants said:\n\n\"Red.\"\n\n\"Green.\"\n\n\"Blue.\"\n\n\"Yellow.\"\n\n\"His head is bright green, his wings are brilliant orange tinged with\npink, his limbs are silver grey, his hind-quarters and his tail are\nstriped with brown and pink bands, his belly bright yellow spotted with\nblack.\"\n\n\"His colour? He has no colour.\"\n\n\"He is the colour of a dragon.\"\n\nAfter hearing this evidence the Elders remained uncertain as to what\nshould be done. Some advised to watch for him, to surprise him and\noverthrow him by a multitude of arrows. Others, thinking it vain to\noppose so powerful a monster by force, counselled that he should be\nappeased by offerings.\n\n\"Pay him tribute,\" said one of them who passed for a wise man. \"We can\nrender him propitious to us by giving him agreeable presents, fruits,\nwine, lambs, a young virgin.\"\n\nOthers held for poisoning the fountains where he was accustomed to drink\nor for smoking him out of his cavern.\n\nBut none of these counsels prevailed. The dispute was lengthy and the\nElders dispersed without coming to any resolution.\n\n\n\n\nVII. THE DRAGON OF ALCA (Continuation)\n\nDuring all the month dedicated by the Romans to their false god Mars or\nMavors, the dragon ravaged the farms of Dalles and Dombes. He carried\noff fifty sheep, twelve pigs, and three young boys. Every family was in\nmourning and the island was full of lamentations. In order to remove the\nscourge, the Elders of the unfortunate villages watered by the Clange\nand the Surelle resolved to assemble and together go and ask the help of\nthe blessed Mael.\n\nOn the fifth day of the month whose name among the Latins signifies\nopening, because it opens the year, they went in procession to the\nwooden monastery that had been built on the southern coast of the\nisland. When they were introduced into the cloister they filled it with\ntheir sobs and groans. Moved by their lamentations, old Mael left the\nroom in which he devoted himself to the study of astronomy and the\nmeditation of the Scriptures, and went down to them, leaning on his\npastoral staff. At his approach, the Elders, prostrating themselves,\nheld out to him green branches of trees and some of them burnt aromatic\nherbs.\n\nAnd the holy man, seating himself beside the cloistral fountain under an\nancient fig-tree, uttered these words:\n\n\"O my sons, offspring of the Penguins, why do you weep and groan? Why do\nyou hold out those suppliant boughs towards me? Why do you raise towards\nheaven the smoke of those herbs? What calamity do you expect that I can\navert from your heads? Why do you beseech me? I am ready to give my life\nfor you. Only tell your father what it is you hope from him.\"\n\nTo these questions the chief of the Elders answered:\n\n\"O Mael, father of the sons of Alca, I will speak for all. A horrible\ndragon is laying waste our lands, depopulating our cattle-sheds, and\ncarrying off the flower of our youth. He has devoured the child Elo and\nseven young boys; he has mangled the maiden Orberosia, the fairest of\nthe Penguins with his teeth. There is not a village in which he does not\nemit his poisoned breath and which he has not filled with desolation.\nA prey to this terrible scourge, we come, O Mael, to pray thee, as the\nwisest, to advise us concerning the safety of the inhabitants of this\nisland lest the ancient race of Penguins be extinguished.\"\n\n\"O chief of the Elders of Alca,\" replied Mael, \"thy words fill me with\nprofound grief, and I groan at the thought that this island is the prey\nof a terrible dragon. But such an occurrence is not unique, for we find\nin books several tales of very fierce dragons. The monsters are oftenest\nfound in caverns, by the brinks of waters, and, in preference, among\npagan peoples. Perhaps there are some among you who, although they have\nreceived holy baptism and been incorporated into the family of Abraham,\nhave yet worshipped idols, like the ancient Romans, or hung up images,\nvotive tablets, fillets of wool, and garlands of flowers on the branches\nof some sacred tree. Or perhaps some of the women Penguins have danced\nround a magic stone and drunk water from the fountains where the nymphs\ndwell. If it be so, believe, O Penguins, that the Lord has sent this\ndragon to punish all for the crimes of some, and to lead you, O children\nof the Penguins, to exterminate blasphemy, superstition, and impiety\nfrom amongst you. For this reason I advise, as a remedy against the\ngreat evil from which you suffer, that you carefully search your\ndwellings for idolatry, and extirpate it from them. I think it would be\nalso efficacious to pray and do penance.\"\n\nThus spoke the holy Mael. And the Elders of the Penguin people kissed\nhis feet and returned to their villages with renewed hope.\n\n\n\n\nVIII. THE DRAGON OF ALCA (Continuation)\n\nFollowing the counsel of the holy Mael the inhabitants of Alca\nendeavoured to uproot the superstitions that had sprung up amongst them.\nThey took care to prevent the girls from dancing with incantations\nround the fairy tree. Young mothers were sternly forbidden to rub their\nchildren against the stones that stood upright in the fields so as\nto make them strong. An old man of Dombes who foretold the future by\nshaking grains of barley on a sieve, was thrown into a well.\n\nHowever, each night the monster still raided the poultry-yards and the\ncattle-sheds. The frightened peasants barricaded themselves in their\nhouses. A woman with child who saw the shadow of a dragon on the road\nthrough a window in the moonlight, was so terrified that she was brought\nto bed before her time.\n\nIn those days of trial, the holy Mael meditated unceasingly on the\nnature of dragons and the means of combating them. After six months of\nstudy and prayer he thought he had found what he sought. One evening as\nhe was walking by the sea with a young monk called Samuel, he to him in\nthese terms:\n\n\"I have studied at length the history and habits of dragons, not to\nsatisfy a vain curiosity, but to discover examples to follow in the\npresent circumstances. For such, Samuel, my son, is the use of history.\n\n\"It is an invariable fact that dragons are extremely vigilant. They\nnever sleep, and for this reason we often find them employed in guarding\ntreasures. A dragon guarded at Colchis the golden fleece that Jason\nconquered from him. A dragon watched over the golden apples in the\ngarden of the Hesperides. He was killed by Hercules and transformed into\na star by Juno. This fact is related in some books, and if it be true,\nit was done by magic, for the gods of the pagans are in reality demons.\nA dragon prevented barbarous and ignorant men from drinking at the\nfountain of Castalia. We must also remember the dragon of Andromeda,\nwhich was slain by Perseus. But let us turn from these pagan fables, in\nwhich error is always mixed with truth. We meet dragons in the histories\nof the glorious archangel Michael, of St. George, St. Philip, St. James\nthe Great, St. Patrick, St. Martha, and St. Margaret. And it is in such\nwritings, since they are worthy of full credence, that we ought to look\nfor comfort and counsel.\n\n\"The story of the dragon of Silena affords us particularly precious\nexamples. You must know, my son, that on the banks of a vast pool close\nto that town there dwelt a dragon who sometimes approached the walls\nand poisoned with his breath all who dwelt in the suburbs. And that\nthey might not be devoured by the monster, the inhabitants of Silena\ndelivered up to him one of their number expressed his thought every\nmorning. The victim was chosen by lot, and after a hundred others, the\nlot fell upon the king's daughter.\n\n\"Now St. George, who was a military tribune, as he passed through the\ntown of Silena, learned that the king's daughter had just been given to\nthe fierce beast. He immediately mounted his horse, and, armed with\nhis lance, rushed to encounter the dragon, whom he reached just as the\nmonster was about to devour the royal virgin. And when St. George had\noverthrown the dragon, the king's daughter fastened her girdle round the\nbeast's neck and he followed her like a dog led on a leash.\n\n\"That is an example for us of the power of virgins over dragons. The\nhistory of St. Martha furnishes us with a still more certain proof. Do\nyou know the story, Samuel, my son?\"\n\n\"Yes, father,\" answered Samuel.\n\nAnd the blessed Mael went on:\n\n\"There was in a forest on the banks of the Rhone, between Arles and\nAvignon, a dragon half quadruped and half fish, larger than an ox, with\nsharp teeth like horns and huge-wings at his shoulders. He sank the\nboats and devoured their passengers. Now St. Martha, at the entreaty of\nthe people, approached this dragon, whom she found devouring a man. She\nput her girdle round his neck and led him easily into the town.\n\n\"These two examples lead me to think that we should have recourse to the\npower of some virgin so as to conquer the dragon who scatters terror and\ndeath through the island of Alca.\n\n\"For this reason, Samuel thy son, gird up thy loins and go, I pray thee,\nwith two of thy companions, into all the villages of this island, and\nproclaim everywhere that a virgin alone shall be able to deliver the\nisland from the monster that devastates it.\n\n\"Thou shalt sing psalms and canticles and thou shalt say:\n\n\"'O sons of the Penguins, if there be among you a pure virgin, let her\narise and go, armed with the sign of the cross, to combat the dragon!'\"\n\nThus the old man spake, and Samuel promised to obey him. The next day he\ngirded up his loins and set out with two of his companions to proclaim\nto the inhabitants of Alca that a virgin alone would be able to deliver\nthe Penguins from the rage of the dragon.\n\n\n\n\nIX. THE DRAGON OF ALCA (Continuation)\n\nOrberosia loved her husband, but she did not love him alone. At the\nhour when Venus lightens in the pale sky, whilst Kraken scattered terror\nthrough the villages, she used to visit in his moving hut, a young\nshepherd of Dalles called Marcel, whose pleasing form was invested with\ninexhaustible vigour. The fair Orberosia shared the shepherd's aromatic\ncouch with delight, but far from making herself known to him, she took\nthe name of Bridget, and said that she was the daughter of a gardener in\nthe Bay of Divers. When regretfully she left his arms she walked across\nthe smoking fields towards the Coast of Shadows, and if she happened to\nmeet some belated peasant she immediately spread out her garments like\ngreat wings and cried:\n\n\"Passer by, lower your eyes, that you may not have to say, 'Alas! alas!\nwoe is me, for I have seen the angel of the Lord.'\"\n\nThe villagers tremblingly knelt with their faces to the round. And\nseveral of them used to say that angels, whom it would be death to see,\npassed along the roads of the island in the night time.\n\nKraken did not know of the loves of Orberosia and Marcel, for he was a\nhero, and heroes never discover the secrets of their wives. But though\nhe did not know of these loves, he reaped the benefit of them. Every\nnight he found his companion more good-humoured and more beautiful,\nexhaling pleasure and perfuming the nuptial bed with a delicious odour\nof fennel and vervain. She loved Kraken with a love that never became\nimportunate or anxious, because she did not rest its whole weight on him\nalone.\n\nThis lucky infidelity of Orberosia was destined soon to save the hero\nfrom a great peril and to assure his fortune and his glory for ever.\nFor it happened that she saw passing in the twilight a neatherd from\nBelmont, who was goading on his oxen, and she fell more deeply in\nlove with him than she had ever been with the shepherd Marcel. He was\nhunch-backed; his shoulders were higher than his ears; his body was\nsupported by legs of different lengths; his rolling eyes flashed, from\nbeneath his matted hair. From his throat issued a hoarse voice and\nstrident laughter; he smelt of the cow-shed. However, to her he was\nbeautiful. \"A plant,\" as Gnatho says, \"has been loved by one, a stream\nby another, a beast by a third.\"\n\nNow, one day, as she was sighing within the neatherd's arms in a village\nbarn, suddenly the blasts of a trumpet, with sounds and footsteps, fell\nupon her ears; she looked through the window and saw the inhabitants\ncollected in the marketplace round a young monk, who, standing upon a\nrock, uttered these words in a distinct voice:\n\n\"Inhabitants of Belmont, Abbot Mael, our venerable father, informs you\nthrough my mouth that neither by strength nor skill in arms shall you\nprevail against the dragon; but the beast shall be overcome by a virgin.\nIf, then, there be among you a perfectly pure virgin, let her arise and\ngo towards the monster; and when she meets him let her tie her girdle\nround his neck and she shall lead him as easily as if he were a little\ndog.\"\n\nAnd the young monk, replacing his hood upon his head, departed to carry\nthe proclamation of the blessed Mael to other villages.\n\nOrberosia sat in the amorous straw, resting her head in her hand and\nsupporting her elbow upon her knee, meditating on what she had just\nheard.\n\nAlthough, so far as Kraken was concerned, she feared the power of\na virgin much less than the strength of armed men, she did not feel\nreassured by the proclamation of the blessed Mael. A vague but sure\ninstinct ruled her mind and warned her that Kraken could not henceforth\nbe a dragon with safety.\n\nShe said to the neatherd:\n\n\"My own heart, what do you think about the dragon?\"\n\nThe rustic shook his head.\n\n\"It is certain that dragons laid waste the earth in ancient times and\nsome have been seen as large as mountains. But they come no longer, and\nI believe that what has been taken for a dragon is not one at all, but\npirates or merchants who have carried off the fair Orberosia and\nthe best of the children of Alca in their ships. But if one of those\nbrigands attempts to rob me of my oxen, I will either by force or craft\nfind a way to prevent him from doing me any harm.\"\n\nThis remark of the neatherd increased Orberosia's apprehensions and\nadded to her solicitude for the husband whom she loved.\n\n\n\n\nX. THE DRAGON OF ALCA (Continuation)\n\nThe days passed by and no maiden arose in the island to combat the\nmonster. And in the wooden monastery old Mael, seated on a bench in the\nshade of an old fig-tree, accompanied by a pious monk called Regimental,\nkept asking himself anxiously and sadly how it was that there was not in\nAlca a single virgin fit to overthrow the monster.\n\nHe sighed and brother Regimental sighed too. At that moment old Mael\ncalled young Samuel, who happened to pass through the garden, and said\nto him:\n\n\"I have meditated anew, my son, on the means of destroying the dragon\nwho devours the flower of our youth, our flocks, and our harvests. In\nthis respect the story of the dragons of St. Riok and of St. Pol de Leon\nseems to me particularly instructive. The dragon of St. Riok was six\nfathoms long; his head was derived from the cock and the basilisk, his\nbody from the ox and the serpent; he ravaged the banks of the Elorn in\nthe time of King Bristocus. St. Riok, then aged two years, led him by\na leash to the sea, in which the monster drowned himself of his own\naccord. St. Pol's dragon was sixty feet long and not less terrible. The\nblessed apostle of Leon bound him with his stole and allowed a young\nnoble of great purity of life to lead him. These examples prove that\nin the eyes of God a chaste young man is as agreeable as a chaste girl.\nHeaven makes no distinction between them. For this reason, my son, if\nyou believe what I say, we will both go to the Coast of Shadows; when we\nreach the dragon's cavern we will call the monster in a loud voice, and\nwhen he comes forth I will tie my stole round his neck and you will lead\nhim to the sea, where he will not fail to drown himself.\"\n\nAt the old man's words Samuel cast down his head and did not answer.\n\n\"You seem to hesitate, my son,\" said Mael.\n\nBrother Regimental, contrary to his custom, spoke without being\naddressed.\n\n\"There is at least cause for some hesitation,\" said he. \"St. Riok was\nonly two years old when he overcame the dragon. Who says that nine or\nten years later he could have done as much? Remember, father, that the\ndragon who is devastating our island has devoured little Elo and four\nor five other young boys. Brother Samuel is not go presumptuous as to\nbelieve that at nineteen years of age he is more innocent than they were\nat twelve and fourteen.\n\n\"Alas!\" added the monk, with a groan, \"who can boast of being chaste in\nthis world, where everything gives the example and model of love, where\nall things in nature, animals, and plants, show us the caresses of love\nand advise us to share them? Animals are eager to unite in their own\nfashion, but the various marriages of quadrupeds, birds, fishes, and\nreptiles are far from equalling in lust the nuptials of the trees. The\ngreatest extremes of lewdness that the pagans have imagined in their\nfables are outstripped by the simple flowers of the field, and, if\nyou knew the irregularities of lilies and roses you would take those\nchalices of impurity, those vases of scandal, away from your altars.\"\n\n\"Do not speak in this way, Brother Regimental,\" answered old Mael.\n\"Since they are subject to the law of nature, animals and plants are\nalways innocent. They have no souls to save, whilst man--\"\n\n\"You are right,\" replied Brother Regimental, \"it is quite a different\nthing. But do not send young Samuel to the dragon--the dragon might\ndevour him. For the last five years Samuel is not in a state to show his\ninnocence to monsters. In the year of the comet, the Devil in order to\nseduce him, put in his path a milkmaid, who was lifting up her petticoat\nto cross a ford. Samuel was tempted, but he overcame the temptation.\nThe Devil, who never tires, sent him the image of that young girl in\na dream. The shade did what the reality was unable to accomplish, and\nSamuel yielded. When he awoke be moistened his couch with his tears, but\nalas! repentance did not give him back his innocence.\"\n\nAs he listened to this story Samuel asked himself how his secret could\nbe known, for he was ignorant that the Devil had borrowed the appearance\nof Brother Regimental, so as to trouble the hearts of the monks of Alca.\n\nAnd old Mael remained deep in thought and kept asking himself in grief:\n\n\"Who will deliver us from the dragon's tooth? Who will preserve us from\nhis breath? Who will save us from his look?\"\n\nHowever, the inhabitants of Alca began to take courage. The labourers of\nDombes and the neatherds of Belmont swore that they themselves would\nbe of more avail than a girl against the ferocious beast, and they\nexclaimed as they stroked the muscles on their arms, \"Let the dragon\ncome!\" Many men and women had seen him. They did not agree about his\nform and his figure, but all now united in saying that he was not as\nbig as they had thought, and that his height was not much greater than\na man's. The defence was organised; towards nightfall watches were\nstationed at the entrances of the villages ready to give the alarm; and\nduring the night companies armed with pitchforks and scythes protected\nthe paddocks in which the animals were shut up. Indeed, once in the\nvillage of Anis some plucky labourers surprised him as he was scaling\nMorio's wall, and, as they had flails, scythes, and pitchforks, they\nfell upon him and pressed him hard. One of them, a very quick and\ncourageous man, thought to have run him through with his pitchfork; but\nhe slipped in a pool and so let him escape. The others would certainly\nhave caught him had they not waited to pick up the rabbits and fowls\nthat he dropped in his flight.\n\nThose labourers declared to the Elders of the village that the monster's\nform and proportions appeased to them human enough except for his head\nand his tail, which were, in truth, terrifying.\n\n\n\n\nXI. THE DRAGON OF ALCA (Continuation)\n\nOn that day Kraken came back to his cavern sooner than usual. He took\nfrom his head his sealskin helmet with its two bull's horns and its\nvisor trimmed with terrible hooks. He threw on the table his gloves that\nended in horrible claws--they were the beaks of sea-birds. He unhooked\nhis belt from which hung a long green tail twisted into many folds. Then\nhe ordered his page, Elo, to help him off with his boots and, as the\nchild did not succeed in doing this very quickly, he gave him a kick\nthat sent him to the other end of the grotto.\n\nWithout looking at the fair Orberosia, who was spinning, he seated\nhimself in front of the fireplace, on which a sheep was roasting, and he\nmuttered:\n\n\"Ignoble Penguins. . . . There is no worse trade than a dragon's.\"\n\n\"What does my master say?\" asked the fair Orberosia.\n\n\"They fear me no longer,\" continued Kraken. \"Formerly everyone fled at\nmy approach. I carried away hens and rabbits in my bag; I drove sheep\nand pigs, cows, and oxen before me. To-day these clod-hoppers keep a\ngood guard; they sit up at night. Just now I was pursued in the\nvillage of Anis by doughty labourers armed with flails and scythes and\npitchforks. I had to drop the hens and rabbits, put my tail under my\narm, and run as fast as I could. Now I ask you, is it seemly for a\ndragon of Cappadocia to run away like a robber with his tail under his\narm? Further, incommoded as I was by crests, horns, hooks, claws, and\nscales, I barely escaped a brute who ran half an inch of his pitchfork\ninto my left thigh.\"\n\nAs he said this he carefully ran his hand over the insulted part, and,\nafter giving himself up for a few moments to bitter meditation:\n\n\"What idiots those Penguins are! I am tired of blowing flames in the\nfaces of such imbeciles. Orberosia, do you hear me?\"\n\nHaving thus spoken the hero raised his terrible helmet in his hands and\ngazed at it for a long time in gloomy silence. Then he pronounced these\nrapid words:\n\n\"I have made this helmet with my own hands in the shape of a fish's\nhead, covering it with the skin of a seal. To make it more terrible I\nhave put on it the horns of a bull and I have given it a boar's jaws;\nI have hung from it a horse's tail dyed vermilion. When in the gloomy\ntwilight I threw it over my shoulders no inhabitant of this island had\ncourage to withstand its sight. Women and children, young men and old\nmen fled distracted at its approach, and I carried terror among the\nwhole race of Penguins. By what advice does that insolent people lose\nits earlier fears and dare to-day to behold these horrible jaws and to\nattack this terrible crest?\"\n\nAnd throwing his helmet on the rocky soil:\n\n\"Perish, deceitful helmet!\" cried Kraken. \"I swear by all the demons of\nArmor that I will never bear you upon my head again.\"\n\nAnd having uttered this oath he stamped upon his helmet, his gloves, his\nboots, and upon his tail with its twisted folds.\n\n\"Kraken,\" said the fair Orberosia, \"will you allow your servant to\nemploy artifice to save your reputation and your goods? Do not despise a\nwoman's help. You need it, for all men are imbeciles.\"\n\n\"Woman,\" asked Kraken, \"what are your plans?\"\n\nAnd the fair Orberosia informed her husband that the monks were going\nthrough the villages teaching the inhabitants the best way of combating\nthe dragon; that, according to their instructions, the beast would be\novercome by a virgin, and that if a maid placed her girdle around the\ndragon's neck she could lead him as easily as if he were a little dog.\n\n\"How do you know that the monks teach this?\" asked Kraken.\n\n\"My friend,\" answered Orberosia, \"do not interrupt a serious subject\nby frivolous questions. . . . 'If, then,' added the monks, 'there be in\nAlca a pure virgin, let her arise!' Now, Kraken, I have determined to\nanswer their call. I will go and find the holy Mael and I will say to\nhim: 'I am the virgin destined by Heaven to overthrow the dragon.'\"\n\nAt these words Kraken exclaimed: \"How can you be that pure virgin? And\nwhy do you want to overthrow me, Orberosia? Have you lost your reason?\nBe sure that I will not allow myself to be conquered by you!\"\n\n\"Can you not try and understand me before you get angry?\" sighed the\nfair Orberosia with deep though gentle contempt.\n\nAnd she explained the cunning designs that she had formed.\n\nAs he listened, the hero remained pensive. And when she ceased speaking:\n\n\"Orberosia, your cunning, is deep,\" said he, \"And if your plans are\ncarried out according to your intentions I shall derive great advantages\nfrom them. But how can you be the virgin destined by heaven?\"\n\n\"Don't bother about that,\" she replied, \"and come to bed.\"\n\nThe next day in the grease-laden atmosphere of the cavern, Kraken\nplaited a deformed skeleton out of osier rods and covered it with\nbristling, scaly, and filthy skins. To one extremity of the skeleton\nOrberosia sewed the fierce crest and the hideous mask that Kraken used\nto wear in his plundering expeditions, and to the other end she fastened\nthe tail with twisted folds which the hero was wont to trail behind him.\nAnd when the work was finished they showed little Elo and the other five\nchildren who waited on them how to get inside this machine, how to make\nit walk, how to blow horns and burn tow in it so as to send forth smoke\nand flames through the dragon's mouth.\n\n\n\n\nXII. THE DRAGON OF ALCA (Continuation)\n\nOrberosia, having clothed herself in a robe made of coarse stuff and\ngirt herself with a thick cord, went to the monastery and asked to\nspeak to the blessed Mael. And because women were forbidden to enter\nthe enclosure of the monastery the old man advanced outside the gates,\nholding his pastoral cross in his right hand and resting his left on the\nshoulder of Brother Samuel, the youngest of his disciples.\n\nHe asked:\n\n\"Woman, who art thou?\"\n\n\"I am the maiden Orberosia.\"\n\nAt this reply Mael raised his trembling arms to heaven.\n\n\"Do you speak truth, woman? It is a certain fact that Orberosia was\ndevoured by the dragon. And yet I see Orberosia and hear her. Did you\nnot, O my daughter, while within the dragon's bowels arm yourself with\nthe sign of the cross and come uninjured out of his throat? That is what\nseems to me the most credible explanation.\"\n\n\"You are not deceived, father,\" answered Orberosia. \"That is precisely\nwhat happened to me. Immediately I came out of the creature's bowels\nI took refuge in a hermitage on the Coast of Shadows. I lived there\nin solitude, giving myself up to prayer and meditation, and performing\nunheard of austerities, until I learnt by a revelation from heaven that\na maid alone could overcome the dragon, and that I was that maid.\"\n\n\"Show me a sign of your mission,\" said the old man.\n\n\"I myself am the sign,\" answered Orberosia.\n\n\"I am not ignorant of the power of those who have placed a seal upon\ntheir flesh,\" replied the apostle of the Penguins. \"But are you indeed\nsuch as you say?\"\n\n\"You will see by the result,\" answered Orberosia.\n\nThe monk Regimental drew near:\n\n\"That will,\" said he, \"be the best proof. King Solomon has said: 'Three\nthings are hard to understand and a fourth is impossible: they are the\nway of a serpent on the earth, the way of a bird in the air, the way\nof a ship in the sea, and the way of a man with a maid!' I regard\nsuch matrons as nothing less than presumptuous who claim to compare\nthemselves in these matters with the wisest of kings. Father, if you are\nled by me you will not consult them in regard to the pious Orberosia.\nWhen they have given their opinion you will not be a bit farther on than\nbefore. Virginity is not less difficult to prove than to keep. Pliny\ntells us in his history that its signs are either imaginary or very\nuncertain.* One who bears upon her the fourteen signs of corruption may\nyet be pure in the eyes of the angels, and, on the contrary, another who\nhas been pronounced pure by the matrons who inspected her may know that\nher good appearance is due to the artifices of a cunning perversity. As\nfor the purity of this holy girl here, I would put my hand in the fire\nin witness of it.\"\n\n     * We have vainly sought for this phrase in Pliny's \"Natural\n     History.\"--Editor.\n\nHe spoke thus because he was the Devil. But old Mael did not know it. He\nasked the pious Orberosia:\n\n\"My daughter, how, would you proceed to conquer so fierce an animal as\nhe who devoured you?\"\n\nThe virgin answered:\n\n\"To-morrow at sunrise, O Mael, you will summon the people together on\nthe hill in front of the desolate moor that extends to the Coast of\nShadows, and you will take care that no man of the Penguins remains less\nthan five hundred paces from those rocks so that he may not be poisoned\nby the monster's breath. And the dragon will come out of the rocks and I\nwill put my girdle round his neck and lead him like an obedient dog.\"\n\n\"Ought you not to be accompanied by a courageous and pious man who will\nkill the dragon?\" asked Mael.\n\n\"It will be as thou sayest, venerable father. I shall deliver the\nmonster to Kraken, who will stay him with his flashing sword. For I tell\nthee that the noble Kraken, who was believed to be dead, will return\namong the Penguins and he shall slay the dragon. And from the creature's\nbelly will come forth the little children whom he has devoured.\"\n\n\"What you declare to me, O virgin,\" cried the apostle, \"seems wonderful\nand beyond human power.\"\n\n\"It is,\" answered the virgin Orberosia. \"But learn, O Mael, that I have\nhad a revelation that as a reward for their deliverance, the Penguin\npeople will pay to the knight Kraken an annual tribute of three hundred\nfowls, twelve sheep, two oxen, three pigs, one thousand eight hundred\nbushels of corn, and vegetables according to their season; and that,\nmoreover, the children who will come out of the dragon's belly will be\ngiven and committed to the said Kraken to serve him and obey him in\nall things. If the Penguin people fail to keep their engagements a new\ndragon will come upon the island more terrible than the first. I have\nspoken.\"\n\n\n\n\nXIII. THE DRAGON OF ALCA (Continuation and End)\n\nThe people of the Penguins were assembled by Mael and they spent the\nnight on the Coast of Shadows within the bounds which the holy man had\nprescribed in order that none among the Penguins should be poisoned by\nthe monster's breath.\n\nThe veil of night still covered the earth when, preceded by a hoarse\nbellowing, the dragon showed his indistinct and monstrous form upon\nthe rocky coast. He crawled like a serpent and his writhing body seemed\nabout fifteen feet long. At his appearance the crowd drew back in\nterror. But soon all eyes were turned towards the Virgin Orberosia,\nwho, in the first light of the dawn, clothed in white, advanced over the\npurple heather. With an intrepid though modest gait she walked towards\nthe beast, who, uttering awful bellowings, opened his flaming throat. An\nimmense cry of terror and pity arose from the midst of the Penguins. But\nthe virgin, unloosing her linen girdle, put it round the dragon's neck\nand led him on the leash like a faithful dog amid the acclamations of\nthe spectators.\n\nShe had walked over a long stretch of the heath when Kraken appeared\narmed with a flashing sword. The people, who believed him dead, uttered\ncries of joy and surprise. The hero rushed towards the beast, turned\nhim over on his back, and with his sword cut open his belly, from whence\ncame forth in their shirts, with curling hair and folded hands, little\nElo and the five other children whom the monster had devoured.\n\nImmediately they threw themselves on their knees before the virgin\nOrberosia, who took them in her arms and whispered into their ears:\n\n\"You will go through the villages saying: 'We are the poor little\nchildren who were devoured by the dragon, and we came out of his belly\nin our shirts.' The inhabitants will give you abundance of all that you\ncan desire. But if you say anything else you will get nothing but cuffs\nand whippings. Go!\"\n\nSeveral Penguins, seeing the dragon disembowelled, rushed forward to cut\nhim to pieces, some from a feeling of rage and vengeance, others to get\nthe magic stone called dragonite, that is engendered in his head. The\nmothers of the children who had come back to life ran to embrace their\nlittle ones. But the holy Mael kept them back, saying that none of them\nwere holy enough to approach a dragon without dying.\n\nAnd soon little Elo, and the five other children came towards the people\nand said:\n\n\"We are the poor little children who were devoured by the dragon and we\ncame out of his belly in our shirts.\"\n\nAnd all who heard them kissed them and said:\n\n\"Blessed children, we will give you abundance of all that you can\ndesire.\"\n\nAnd the crowd of people dispersed, full of joy, singing hymns and\ncanticles.\n\nTo commemorate this day on which Providence delivered the people from\na cruel scourge, processions were established in which the effigy of a\nchained dragon was led about.\n\nKraken levied the tribute and became the richest and most powerful of\nthe Penguins. As a sign of his victory and so as to inspire a salutary\nterror, he wore a dragon's crest upon his head and he had a habit of\nsaying to the people:\n\n\"Now that the monster is dead I am the dragon.\"\n\nFor many years Orberosia bestowed her favours upon neatherds and\nshepherds, whom she thought equal to the gods. But when she was no\nlonger beautiful she consecrated herself to the Lord.\n\nAt her death she became the object of public veneration, and was\nadmitted into the calendar of the saints and adopted as the patron saint\nof Penguinia.\n\nKraken left a son, who, like his father, wore a dragon's crest, and\nhe was for this reason surnamed Draco. He was the founder of the first\nroyal dynasty of the Penguins.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBOOK III. THE MIDDLE AGES AND THE RENAISSANCE\n\n\n\n\nI. BRIAN THE GOOD AND QUEEN GLAMORGAN\n\nThe kings of Alca were descended from Draco, the son of Kraken, and they\nwore on their heads a terrible dragon's crest, as a sacred badge whose\nappearance alone inspired the people with veneration, terror, and love.\nThey were perpetually in conflict either with their own vassals and\nsubjects or with the princes of the adjoining islands and continents.\n\nThe most ancient of these kings has left but a name. We do not even know\nhow to pronounce or write it. The first of the Draconides whose history\nis known was Brian the Good, renowned for his skill and courage in war\nand in the chase.\n\nHe was a Christian and loved learning. He also favoured men who had\nvowed themselves to the monastic life. In the hall of his palace where,\nunder the sooty rafters, there hung the heads, pelts, and horns of\nwild beasts, he held feasts to which all the harpers of Alca and of\nthe neighbouring islands were invited, and he himself used to join in\nsinging the praises of the heroes. He was just and magnanimous, but\ninflamed by so ardent a love of glory that he could not restrain himself\nfrom putting to death those who had sung better than himself.\n\nThe monks of Yvern having been driven out by the pagans who ravaged\nBrittany, King Brian summoned them into his kingdom and built a wooden\nmonastery for them near his palace. Every day he went with Queen\nGlamorgan, his wife, into the monastery chapel and was present at the\nreligious ceremonies and joined in the hymns.\n\nNow among these monks there was a brother called Oddoul, who, while\nstill in the flower of his youth, had adorned himself with knowledge and\nvirtue. The devil entertained a great grudge against him, and attempted\nseveral times to lead him into temptation. He took several shapes and\nappeared to him in turn as a war-horse, a young maiden, and a cup of\nmead. Then he rattled two dice in a dicebox and said to him:\n\n\"Will you play with me for the kingdoms of, the world against one of the\nhairs of your head?\"\n\nBut the man of the Lord, armed with the sign of the Cross, repulsed the\nenemy. Perceiving that he could not seduce him, the devil thought of an\nartful plan to ruin him. One summer night he approached the queen, who\nslept upon her couch, showed her an image of the young monk whom she\nsaw every day in the wooden monastery, and upon this image he placed\na spell. Forthwith, like a subtle poison, love flowed into Glamorgan's\nveins, and she burned with an ardent desire to do as she listed with\nOddoul. She found unceasing pretexts to have him near her. Several times\nshe asked him to teach reading and singing to her children.\n\n\"I entrust them to you,\" said she to him. \"And will follow the lessons\nyou will give them so that I myself may learn also. You will teach both\nmother and sons at the same time.\"\n\nBut the young monk kept making excuses. At times he would say that he\nwas not a learned enough teacher, and on other occasions that his\nstate forbade him all intercourse with women. This refusal inflamed\nGlamorgan's passion. One day as she lay pining upon her couch, her\nmalady having become intolerable, she summoned Oddoul to her chamber.\nHe came in obedience to her orders, but remained with his eyes cast\ndown towards the threshold of the door. With impatience and grief she\nresented his not looking at her.\n\n\"See,\" said she to him, \"I have no more strength, a shadow is on my\neyes. My body is both burning and freezing.\"\n\nAnd as he kept silence and made no movement, she called him in a voice\nof entreaty:\n\n\"Come to me, come!\"\n\nWith outstretched arms to which passion gave more length, she\nendeavoured to seize him and draw him towards her.\n\nBut he fled away, reproaching her for her wantonness.\n\nThen, incensed with rage and fearing that Oddoul might divulge the shame\ninto which she had fallen, she determined to ruin him so that he might\nnot ruin her.\n\nIn a voice of lamentation that resounded throughout all the palace she\ncalled for help, as if, in truth, she were in some great danger. Her\nservants rushed up and saw the young monk fleeing and the queen pulling\nback the sheets upon her couch. They all cried out together. And when\nKing Brian, attracted by the noise, entered the chamber, Glamorgan,\nshowing him her dishevelled hair, her eyes flooded with tears, and her\nbosom that in the fury of her love she had torn with her nails, said:\n\n\"My lord and husband, behold the traces of the insults I have undergone.\nDriven by an infamous desire Oddoul has approached me and attempted to\ndo me violence.\"\n\nWhen he heard these complaints and saw the blood, the king, transported\nwith fury, ordered his guards to seize the young monk and burn him alive\nbefore the palace under the queen's eyes.\n\nBeing told of the affair, the Abbot of Yvern went to the king and said\nto him:\n\n\"King Brian, know by this example the difference between a Christian\nwoman and a pagan. Roman Lucretia was the most virtuous of idolatrous\nprincesses, yet she had not the strength to defend herself against the\nattacks of an effeminate youth, and, ashamed of her weakness, she gave\nway to despair, whilst Glamorgan has successfully withstood the assaults\nof a criminal filled with rage, and possessed by the most terrible of\ndemons.\" Meanwhile Oddoul, in the prison of the palace, was waiting for\nthe moment when he should be burned alive. But God did not suffer an\ninnocent to perish. He sent to him an angel, who, taking the form of one\nof the queen's servants called Gudrune, took him out of his prison and\nled him into the very room where the woman whose appearance he had taken\ndwelt.\n\nAnd the angel said to young Oddoul:\n\n\"I love thee because thou art daring.\"\n\nAnd young Oddoul, believing that it was Gudrune herself, answered with\ndowncast looks:\n\n\"It is by the grace of the Lord that I have resisted the violence of the\nqueen and braved the anger of that powerful woman.\"\n\nAnd the angel asked:\n\n\"What? Hast thou not done what the queen accuses thee of?\"\n\n\"In truth no, I have not done it,\" answered Oddoul, his hand on his\nheart.\n\n\"Thou hast not done it?\"\n\n\"No, I have not done it. The very thought of such an action fills me\nwith horror.\"\n\n\"Then,\" cried the angel, \"what art thou doing here, thou impotent\ncreature?\" *\n\n     * The Penguin chronicler who relates the fact employs the\n     expression, Species inductilis. I have endeavoured to\n     translate it literally.\n\n\nAnd she opened the door to facilitate the young man's escape. Oddoul\nfelt himself pushed violently out. Scarcely had he gone down into the\nstreet than a chamber-pot was poured over his head; and he thought:\n\n\"Mysterious are thy designs, O Lord, and thy ways past finding out.\"\n\n\n\n\nII. DRACO THE GREAT (Translation of the Relics of St. Orberosia)\n\nThe direct posterity of Brian the Good was extinguished about the year\n900 in the person of Collic of the Short Nose. A cousin of that prince,\nBosco the Magnanimous, succeeded him, and took care, in order to assure\nhimself of the throne, to put to death all his relations. There issued\nfrom him a long line of powerful kings.\n\nOne of them, Draco the Great, attained great renown as a man of war. He\nwas defeated more frequently than the others. It is by this constancy\nin defeat that great captains are recognized. In twenty years he burned\ndown more than a hundred thousand hamlets, market towns, unwalled\ntowns, villages, walled towns, cities, and universities. He set fire\nimpartially to his enemies' territory and to his own domains. And he\nused to explain his conduct by saying:\n\n\"War without fire is like tripe without mustard: it is an insipid\nthing.\"\n\nHis justice was rigorous. When the peasants whom he made prisoners were\nunable to raise the money for their ransoms he had them hanged from a\ntree, and if any unhappy woman came to plead for her destitute husband\nhe dragged her by the hair at his horse's tail. He lived like a soldier\nwithout effeminacy. It is satisfactory to relate that his manner of\nlife was pure. Not only did he not allow his kingdom to decline from its\nhereditary glory, but, even in his reverses he valiantly supported the\nhonour of the Penguin people.\n\nDraco the Great caused the relics of St. Orberosia to be transferred to\nAlca.\n\nThe body of the blessed saint had been buried in a grotto on the Coast\nof Shadows at the end of a scented heath. The first pilgrims who went\nto visit it were the boys and girls from the neighbouring villages. They\nused to go there in the evening, by preference in couples, as if their\npious desires naturally sought satisfaction in darkness and solitude.\nThey worshipped the saint with a fervent and discreet worship whose\nmystery they seemed jealously to guard, for they did not like to publish\ntoo openly the experiences they felt. But they were heard to murmur one\nto another words of love, delight, and rapture with which they mingled\nthe name of Orberosia. Some would sigh that there they forgot the world;\nothers would say that they came out of the grotto in peace and calm; the\nyoung girls among them used to recall to each other the joy with which\nthey had been filled in it.\n\nSuch were the marvels that the virgin of Alca performed in the morning\nof her glorious eternity; they had the sweetness and indefiniteness\nof the dawn. Soon the mystery of the grotto spread like a perfume\nthroughout the land; it was a ground of joy and edification for pious\nsouls, and corrupt men endeavoured, though in vain, by falsehood and\ncalumny, to divert the faithful from the springs of grace that flowed\nfrom the saint's tomb. The Church took measures so that these graces\nshould not remain reserved for a few children, but should be diffused\nthroughout all Penguin Christianity. Monks took up their quarters in the\ngrotto, they built a monastery, a chapel, and a hostelry on the coast,\nand pilgrims began to flock thither.\n\nAs if strengthened by a longer sojourn in heaven, the blessed Orberosia\nnow performed still greater miracles for those who came to lay their\nofferings on her tomb. She gave hopes to women who had been hitherto\nbarren, she sent dreams to reassure jealous old men concerning the\nfidelity of the young wives whom they had suspected without cause, and\nshe protected the country from plagues, murrains, famines, tempests, and\ndragons of Cappadocia.\n\nBut during the troubles that desolated the kingdom in the time of King\nCollic and his successors, the tomb of St. Orberosia was plundered of\nits wealth, the monastery burned down, and the monks dispersed. The\nroad that had been so long trodden by devout pilgrims was overgrown with\nfurze and heather, and the blue thistles of the sands. For a hundred\nyears the miraculous tomb had been visited by none save vipers,\nweasels, and bats, when, one day the saint appeared to a peasant of the\nneighbourhood, Momordic by name.\n\n\"I am the virgin Orberosia,\" said she to him; \"I have chosen thee to\nrestore my sanctuary. Warn the inhabitants of the country that if they\nallow my memory to be blotted out, and leave my tomb without honour and\nwealth, a new dragon will come and devastate Penguinia.\"\n\nLearned churchmen held an inquiry concerning this apparition, and\npronounced it genuine, and not diabolical but truly heavenly, and in\nlater years it was remarked that in France, in like circumstances, St.\nFoy and St. Catherine had acted in the same way and made use of similar\nlanguage.\n\nThe monastery was restored and pilgrims flocked to it anew. The virgin\nOrberosia worked greater and greater miracles. She cured divers hurtful\nmaladies, particularly club-foot, dropsy, paralysis, and St. Guy's\ndisease. The monks who kept the tomb were enjoying an enviable opulence,\nwhen the saint, appearing to King Draco the Great, ordered him to\nrecognise her as the heavenly patron of the kingdom and to transfer her\nprecious remains to the cathedral of Alca.\n\nIn consequence, the odoriferous relics of that virgin were carried with\ngreat pomp to the metropolitan church and placed in the middle of the\nchoir in a shrine made of gold and enamel and ornamented with precious\nstones.\n\nThe chapter kept a record of the miracles wrought by the blessed\nOrberosia.\n\nDraco the Great, who had never ceased to defend and exalt the Christian\nfaith, died fulfilled with the most pious sentiments and bequeathed his\ngreat possessions to the Church.\n\n\n\n\nIII. QUEEN CRUCHA\n\nTerrible disorders followed the death of Draco the Great. That prince's\nsuccessors have often been accused of weakness, and it is true that none\nof them followed, even from afar, the example of their valiant ancestor.\n\nHis son, Chum, who was lame, failed to increase the territory of the\nPenguins. Bolo, the son of Chum, was assassinated by the palace guards\nat the age of nine, just as he was ascending the throne. His brother\nGun succeeded him. He was only seven years old and allowed himself to be\ngoverned by his mother, Queen Crucha.\n\nCrucha was beautiful, learned, and intelligent; but she was unable to\ncurb her own passions.\n\nThese are the terms in which the venerable Talpa expresses himself in\nhis chronicle regarding that illustrious queen:\n\n\"In beauty of face and symmetry of figure Queen Crucha yields neither\nto Semiramis of Babylon nor to Penthesilea, queen of the Amazons; nor to\nSalome, the daughter of Herodias. But she offers in her person certain\nsingularities that will appear beautiful or uncomely according to the\ncontradictory opinions of men and the varying judgments of the world.\nShe has on her forehead two small horns which she conceals in the\nabundant folds of her golden hair; one of her eyes is blue and one is\nblack; her neck is bent towards the left side; and, like Alexander\nof Macedon, she has six fingers on her right hand, and a stain like a\nlittle monkey's head upon her skin.\n\n\"Her gait is majestic and her manner affable. She is magnificent in her\nexpenses, but she is not always able to rule desire by reason.\n\n\"One day, having noticed in the palace stables, a young groom of great\nbeauty, she immediately fell violently in love with him, and entrusted\nto him the command of her armies. What one must praise unreservedly\nin this great queen is the abundance of gifts that she makes to the\nchurches, monasteries, and chapels in her kingdom, and especially to\nthe holy house of Beargarden, where, by the grace of the Lord, I made my\nprofession in my fourteenth year. She has founded masses for the repose\nof her soul in such great numbers that every priest in the Penguin\nChurch is, so to speak, transformed into a taper lighted in the sight of\nheaven to draw down the divine mercy upon the august Crucha.\"\n\nFrom these lines and from some others with which have enriched my text\nthe reader can judge of the historical and literary value of the \"Gesta\nPenguinorum.\" Unhappily, that chronicle suddenly comes suddenly to an\nend at third year of Draco the Simple, the successor of Gun the Weak.\nHaving reached that point of my history, I deplore the loss of an\nagreeable and trustworthy guide.\n\nDuring the two centuries that followed, the Penguins remained plunged\nin blood-stained disorder. All the arts perished. In the midst of the\ngeneral ignorance, the monks in the shadow of their cloister devoted\nthemselves to study, and copied the Holy Scriptures with indefatigable\nzeal. As parchment was scarce, they scraped the writing off old\nmanuscripts in order to transcribe upon them the divine word. Thus\nthroughout the breadth of Penguinia Bibles blossomed forth like roses on\na bush.\n\nA monk of the order of St. Benedict, Ermold the Penguin, had himself\nalone defaced four thousand Greek and Latin manuscripts so as to copy\nout the Gospel of St. John four thousand times. Thus the masterpieces of\nancient poetry and eloquence were destroyed in great numbers. Historians\nare unanimous in recognising that the Penguin convents were the refuge\nof learning during the Middle Ages.\n\nUnending wars between the Penguins and the Porpoises filled the close\nof this period. It is extremely difficult to know the truth concerning\nthese wars, not because accounts are wanting, but because there are so\nmany of them. The Porpoise Chronicles contradict the Penguin Chronicles\nat every point. And, moreover, the Penguins contradict each other as\nwell as the Porpoises. I have discovered two chronicles that are in\nagreement, but one has copied from the other. A single fact is certain,\nnamely, that massacres, rapes, conflagrations, and plunder succeeded one\nanother without interruption.\n\nUnder the unhappy prince Bosco IX. the kingdom was at the verge of\nruin. On the news that the Porpoise fleet, composed of six hundred great\nships, was in sight of Alca, the bishop ordered a solemn procession. The\ncathedral chapter, the elected magistrates, the members of Parliament,\nand the clerics of the University entered the Cathedral and, taking up\nSt. Orberosia's shrine, led it in procession through the town, followed\nby the entire people singing hymns. The holy patron of Penguinia was not\ninvoked in vain. Nevertheless, the Porpoises besieged the town both by\nland and sea, took it by assault, and for three days and three nights\nkilled, plundered, violated, and burned, with all the indifference that\nhabit produces.\n\nOur astonishment cannot be too great at the fact that, during those iron\nages, the faith was preserved intact among the Penguins. The splendour\nof the truth in those times illumined all souls that had not been\ncorrupted by sophisms. This is the explanation of the unity of belief.\nA constant practice of the Church doubtless contributed also to\nmaintain this happy communion of the faithful--every Penguin who thought\ndifferently from the others was immediately burned at the stake.\n\n\n\n\nIV. LETTERS: JOHANNES TALPA\n\nDuring the minority of King Gun, Johannes Talpa, in the monastery of\nBeargarden, where at the age of fourteen he had made his profession\nand from which he never departed for a single day throughout his life,\ncomposed his celebrated Latin chronicle in twelve books called \"De\nGestis Penguinorum.\"\n\nThe monastery of Beargarden lifts its high walls on the summit of an\ninaccessible peak. One sees around it only the blue tops of mountains,\ndivided by the clouds.\n\nWhen he began to write his \"Gesta Penguinorum,\" Johannes Talpa was\nalready old. The good monk has taken care to tell us this in his book:\n\"My head has long since lost,\" he says, \"its adornment of fair hair,\nand my scalp resembles those convex mirrors of metal which the Penguin\nladies consult with so much care and zeal. My stature, naturally small,\nhas with years become diminished and bent. My white beard gives warmth\nto my breast.\"\n\nWith a charming simplicity, Talpa informs us of certain circumstances in\nhis life and some features in his character. \"Descended,\" he tells us,\n\"from a noble family, and destined from childhood for the ecclesiastical\nstate, I was taught grammar and music. I learnt to read under the\nguidance of a master who was called Amicus, and who would have been\nbetter named Inimicus. As I did not easily attain to a knowledge of\nmy letters, he beat me violently with rods so that I can say that he\nprinted the alphabet in strokes upon my back.\"\n\nIn another passage Talpa confesses his natural inclination towards\npleasure. These are his expressive words: \"In my youth the ardour of\nmy senses was such that in the shadow of the woods I experienced a\nsensation of boiling in a pot rather than of breathing the fresh air. I\nfled from women, but in vain, for every object recalled them to me.\"\n\nWhile he was writing his chronicle, a terrible war, at once foreign and\ndomestic, laid waste the Penguin land. The soldiers of Crucha came to\ndefend the monastery of Beargarden against the Penguin barbarians and\nestablished themselves strongly within its walls. In order to render it\nimpregnable they pierced loop-holes through the walls and they took the\nlead off the church roof to make balls for their slings. At night they\nlighted huge fires in the courts and cloisters and on them they roasted\nwhole oxen which they spitted upon the ancient pine-trees of the\nmountain. Sitting around the flames, amid smoke filled with a mingled\nodour of resin and fat, they broached huge casks of wine and beer. Their\nsongs, their blasphemies, and the noise of their quarrels drowned the\nsound of the morning bells.\n\nAt last the Porpoises, having crossed the defiles, laid siege to the\nmonastery. They were warriors from the North, clad in copper armour.\nThey fastened ladders a hundred and fifty fathoms long to the sides of\nthe cliffs and sometimes in the darkness and storm these broke beneath\nthe weight of men and arms, and bunches of the besiegers were hurled\ninto the ravines and precipices. A prolonged wail would be heard going\ndown into the darkness, and the assault would begin again. The Penguins\npoured streams of burning wax upon their assailants, which made them\nblaze like torches. Sixty times the enraged Porpoises attempted to scale\nthe monastery and sixty times they were repulsed.\n\nFor six months they had closely invested the monastery, when, on the day\nof the Epiphany, a shepherd of the valley showed them a hidden path\nby which they climbed the mountain, penetrated into the vaults of the\nabbey, ran through the cloisters, the kitchens, the church, the chapter\nhalls, the library, the laundry, the cells, the refectories, and the\ndormitories, and burned the buildings, killing and violating without\ndistinction of age or sex. The Penguins, awakened unexpectedly, ran to\narms, but in the darkness and alarm they struck at one another, whilst\nthe Porpoises with blows of their axes disputed the sacred vessels, the\ncensers, the candlesticks, dalmatics, reliquaries, golden crosses, and\nprecious stones.\n\nThe air was filled with an acrid odour of burnt flesh. Groans and\ndeath-cries arose in the midst of the flames, and on the edges of the\ncrumbling roofs monks ran in thousands like ants, and fell into the\nvalley. Yet Johannes Talpa kept on writing his Chronicle. The soldiers\nof Crucha retreated speedily and filled up all the issues from the\nmonastery with pieces of rock so as to shut up the Porpoises in the\nburning buildings. And to crush the enemy beneath the ruin they employed\nthe trunks of old oaks as battering-rams. The burning timbers fell in\nwith a noise like thunder and the lofty arches of the naves crumbled\nbeneath the shock of these giant trees when moved by six hundred men\ntogether. Soon there was left nothing of the rich and extensive abbey\nbut the cell of Johannes Talpa, which, by a marvellous chance, hung from\nthe ruin of a smoking gable. The old chronicler still kept writing.\n\nThis admirable intensity of thought may seem excessive in the case of\nan annalist who applies himself to relate the events of his own time.\nHowever abstracted and detached we may be from surrounding things,\nwe nevertheless resent their influence. I have consulted the original\nmanuscript of Johannes Talpa in the National Library, where it is\npreserved (Monumenta Peng., K. L6., 12390 four). It is a parchment\nmanuscript of 628 leaves. The writing is extremely confused, the letters\ninstead of being in a straight line, stray in all directions and are\nmingled together in great disorder, or, more correctly speaking, in\nabsolute confusion. They are so badly formed that for the most part it\nis impossible not merely to say what they are, but even to distinguish\nthem from the splashes of ink with which they are plentifully\ninterspersed. Those inestimable pages bear witness in this way to the\ntroubles amid which they were written. To read them is difficult. On the\nother hand, the monk of Beargarden's style shows no trace of emotion.\nThe tone of the \"Gesta Penguinorum\" never departs from simplicity.\nThe narration is rapid and of a conciseness that sometimes approaches\ndryness. The reflections are rare and, as a rule, judicious.\n\n\n\n\nV. THE ARTS: THE PRIMITIVES OF PENGUIN PAINTING\n\nThe Penguin critics vie with one another in affirming that Penguin\nart has from its origin been distinguished by a powerful and pleasing\noriginality, and that we may look elsewhere in vain for the qualities of\ngrace and reason that characterise its earliest works. But the Porpoises\nclaim that their artists were undoubtedly the instructors and masters of\nthe Penguins. It is difficult to form an opinion on the matter, because\nthe Penguins, before they began to admire their primitive painters,\ndestroyed all their works.\n\nWe cannot be too sorry for this loss. For my own part I feel it cruelly,\nfor I venerate the Penguin antiquities and I adore the primitives.\nThey are delightful. I do not say the are all alike, for that would be\nuntrue, but they have common characters that are found in all schools--I\nmean formulas from which they never depart--and there is besides\nsomething finished in their work, for what they know they know well.\nLuckily we can form a notion of the Penguin primitives from the Italian,\nFlemish, and Dutch primitives, and from the French primitives, who are\nsuperior to all the rest; as M. Gruyer tells us they are more logical,\nlogic being a peculiarly French quality. Even if this is denied it must\nat least be admitted that to France belongs the credit of having kept\nprimitives when the other nations knew them no longer. The Exhibition\nof French Primitives at the Pavilion Marsan in 1904 contained several\nlittle panels contemporary with the later Valois kings and with Henry\nIV.\n\nI have made many journeys to see the pictures of the brothers Van Eyck,\nof Memling, of Roger van der Weyden, of the painter of the death of\nMary, of Ambrogio Lorenzetti, and of the old Umbrian masters. It was,\nhowever, neither Bruges, nor Cologne, nor Sienna, nor Perugia, that\ncompleted my initiation; it was in the little town of Arezzo that I\nbecame a conscious adept in primitive painting. That was ten years\nago or even longer. At that period of indigence and simplicity, the\nmunicipal museums, though usually kept shut, were always opened to\nforeigners. One evening an old woman with a candle showed me, for half a\nlira, the sordid museum of Arezzo, and in it I discovered a painting\nby Margaritone, a \"St. Francis,\" the pious sadness of which moved me to\ntears. I was deeply touched, and Margaritone, of Arezzo became from that\nday my dearest primitive.\n\nI picture to myself the Penguin primitives in conformity with the works\nof that master. It will not therefore be thought superfluous if in this\nplace I consider his works with some attention, if not in detail,\nat least under their more general and, if I dare say so, most\nrepresentative aspect.\n\nWe possess five or six pictures signed with his hand. His masterpiece,\npreserved in the National Gallery of London, represents the Virgin\nseated on a throne and holding the infant Jesus in her arms. What\nstrikes one first when one looks at this figure is the proportion. The\nbody from the neck to the feet is only twice as long as the head,\nso that it appears extremely short and podgy. This work is not less\nremarkable for its painting than for its drawing. The great Margaritone\nhad but a limited number of colours in his possession, and he used\nthem in all their purity without ever modifying the tones. From this it\nfollows that his colouring has more vivacity than harmony. The cheeks\nof the Virgin and those of the Child are of a bright vermilion which the\nold master, from a naive preference for clear definitions, has placed on\neach face in two circumferences as exact as if they had been traced out\nby a pair of compasses.\n\nA learned critic of the eighteenth century, the Abbe Lanzi, has treated\nMargaritone's works with profound disdain. \"They are,\" he says, \"merely\ncrude daubs. In those unfortunate times people could neither draw nor\npaint.\" Such was the common opinion of the connoisseurs of the days of\npowdered wigs. But the great Margaritone and his contemporaries were\nsoon to be avenged for this cruel contempt. There was born in the\nnineteenth century, in the biblical villages and reformed cottages of\npious England, a multitude of little Samuels and little St. Johns, with\nhair curling like lambs, who, about 1840, and 1850, became spectacled\nprofessors and founded the cult of the primitives.\n\nThat eminent theorist of Pre-Raphaelitism, Sir James Tuckett, does not\nshrink from placing the Madonna of the National Gallery on a level with\nthe masterpieces of Christian art. \"By giving to the Virgin's head,\"\nsays Sir James Tuckett, \"a third of the total height of the figure,\nthe old master attracts the spectator's attention and keeps it directed\ntowards the more sublime parts of the human figure, and in particular\nthe eyes, which we ordinarily describe as the spiritual organs. In this\npicture, colouring and design conspire to produce an ideal and mystical\nimpression. The vermilion of the cheeks does not recall the natural\nappearance of the skin; it rather seems as if the old master has applied\nthe roses of Paradise to the faces of the Mother and the Child.\"\n\nWe see, in such a criticism as this, a shining reflection, so to speak,\nof the work which it exalts; yet MacSilly, the seraphic aesthete of\nEdinburgh, has expressed in a still more moving and penetrating fashion\nthe impression produced upon his mind by the sight of this primitive\npainting. \"The Madonna of Margaritone,\" says the revered MacSilly,\n\"attains the transcendent end of art. It inspires its beholders with\nfeelings of innocence and purity; it makes them like little children.\nAnd so true is this, that at the age of sixty-six, after having had the\njoy of contemplating it closely for three hours, I felt myself suddenly\ntransformed into a little child. While my cab was taking me through\nTrafalgar Square I kept laughing and prattling and shaking my\nspectacle-case as if it were a rattle. And when the maid in my\nboarding-house had served my meal I kept pouring spoonfuls of soup into\nmy ear with all the artlessness of childhood.\"\n\n\"It is by such results,\" adds MacSilly, \"that the excellence of a work\nof art is proved.\"\n\nMargaritone, according to Vasari, died at the age of seventy-seven,\n\"regretting that he had lived to see a new form of art arising and the\nnew artists crowned with fame.\"\n\nThese lines, which I translate literally, have inspired Sir James\nTuckett with what are perhaps the finest pages in his work. They form\npart of his \"Breviary for Aesthetes\"; all the Pre-Raphaelites know them\nby heart. I place them here as the most precious ornament of this book.\nYou will agree that nothing more sublime has been written since the days\nof the Hebrew prophets.\n\nMARGARITONE'S VISION\n\nMargaritone, full of years and labours, went one day to visit the studio\nof a young painter who had lately settled in the town. He noticed in\nthe studio a freshly painted Madonna, which, although severe and rigid,\nnevertheless, by a certain exactness in the proportions and a devilish\nmingling of light and shade, assumed an appearance of relief and life.\nAt this sight the artless and sublime worker of Arezzo perceived with\nhorror what the future of painting would be. With his brow clasped in\nhis hands he exclaimed:\n\n\"What things of shame does not this figure show forth! I discern in it\nthe end of that Christian art which paints the soul and inspires the\nbeholder with an ardent desire for heaven. Future painters will not\nrestrain themselves as does this one to portraying on the side of a wall\nor on a wooden panel the cursed matter of which our bodies are formed;\nthey will celebrate and glorify it. They will clothe their figures with\ndangerous appearances of flesh, and these figures will seem like real\npersons. Their bodies will be seen; their forms will appear through\ntheir clothing. St. Magdalen will have a bosom. St. Martha a belly, St.\nBarbara hips, St. Agnes buttocks; St. Sebastian will unveil his youthful\nbeauty, and St. George will display beneath his armour the muscular\nwealth of a robust virility; apostles, confessors, doctors, and God\nthe Father himself will appear as ordinary beings like you and me; the\nangels will affect an equivocal, ambiguous, mysterious beauty which\nwill trouble hearts. What desire for heaven will these representations\nimpart? None; but from them you will learn to take pleasure in the\nforms of terrestrial life. Where will painters stop in their indiscreet\ninquiries? They will stop nowhere. They will go so far as to show men\nand women naked like the idols of the Romans. There will be a sacred art\nand a profane art, and the sacred art will not be less profane than the\nother.\"\n\n\"Get ye behind me, demons,\" exclaimed the old master. For in prophetic\nvision he saw the righteous and the saints assuming the appearance of\nmelancholy athletes. He saw Apollos playing the lute on a flowery hill,\nin the midst of the Muses wearing light tunics. He saw Venuses lying\nunder shady myrtles and the Danae exposing their charming sides to the\ngolden rain. He saw pictures of Jesus under the pillar's of the temple\namidst patricians, fair ladies, musicians, pages, negroes, dogs, and\nparrots. He saw in an inextricable confusion of human limbs, outspread\nwings, and flying draperies, crowds of tumultuous Nativities, opulent\nHoly Families, emphatic Crucifixions. He saw St. Catherines, St.\nBarbaras, St. Agneses humiliating patricians by the sumptuousness of\ntheir velvets, their brocades, and their pearls, and by the splendour of\ntheir breasts. He saw Auroras scattering roses, and a multitude of naked\nDianas and Nymphs surprised on the banks of retired streams. And the\ngreat Margaritone died, strangled by so horrible a presentiment of the\nRenaissance and the Bolognese School.\n\n\n\n\nVI. MARBODIUS\n\nWe possess a precious monument of the Penguin literature of the\nfifteenth century. It is a narrative of a journey to hell undertaken\nby the monk Marbodius, of the order of St. Benedict, who professed\na fervent admiration for the poet Virgil. This narrative, written in\nfairly good Latin, has been published by M. du Clos des Limes. It is\nhere translated for the first time. I believe that I am doing a service\nto my fellow-countrymen in making them acquainted with these pages,\nthough doubtless they are far from forming a unique example of this\nclass of mediaeval Latin literature. Among the fictions that may be\ncompared with them we may mention \"The Voyage of St. Brendan,\"\n\"The Vision of Albericus,\" and \"St. Patrick's Purgatory,\" imaginary\ndescriptions, like Dante Alighieri's \"Divine Comedy,\" of the supposed\nabode of the dead. The narrative of Marbodius is one of the latest works\ndealing with this theme, but it is not the least singular.\n\nTHE DESCENT OF MARBODIUS INTO HELL\n\nIn the fourteen hundred and fifty-third year of the incarnation of the\nSon of God, a few days before the enemies of the Cross entered the\ncity of Helena and the great Constantine, it was given to me, Brother\nMarbodius, an unworthy monk, to see and to hear what none had hitherto\nseen or heard. I have composed a faithful narrative of those things so\nthat their memory may not perish with me, for man's time is short.\n\nOn the first day of May in the aforesaid year, at the hour of vespers, I\nwas seated in the Abbey of Corrigan on a stone in the cloisters and, as\nmy custom was, I read the verses of the poet whom I love best of all,\nVirgil, who has sung of the labours: of the field, of shepherds, and\nof heroes. Evening was hanging its purple folds from the arches of the\ncloisters and in a voice of emotion I was murmuring the verses which\ndescribe how Dido, the Phoenician queen, wanders with her ever-bleeding\nwound beneath the myrtles of hell. At that moment Brother Hilary\nhappened to pass by, followed by Brother Jacinth, the porter.\n\nBrought up in the barbarous ages before the resurrection of the Muses,\nBrother Hilary has not been initiated into the wisdom of the ancients;\nnevertheless, the poetry of the Mantuan has, like a subtle torch, shed\nsome gleams of light into his understanding.\n\n\"Brother Marbodius,\" he asked me, \"do those verses that you utter\nwith swelling breast and sparkling eyes--do they belong to that great\n'Aeneid' from which morning or evening your glances are never withheld?\"\n\nI answered that I was reading in Virgil how the son of Anchises\nperceived Dido like a moon behind the foliage.*\n\n     * The text runs\n\n     . . .qualem primo qui syrgere mense\n     Aut videt aut vidisse putat per nubila lunam.\n\nBrother Marbodius, by a strange misunderstanding, substitutes an\nentirely different image for the one created by the poet.\n\n\n\"Brother Marbodius,\" he replied, \"I am certain that on all occasions\nVirgil gives expression to wise maxims and profound thoughts. But the\nsongs that he modulates on his Syracusan flute hold such a lofty meaning\nand such exalted doctrine that I am continually puzzled by them.\"\n\n\"Take care, father,\" cried Brother Jacinth, in an agitated voice.\n\"Virgil was a magician who wrought marvels by the help of demons. It is\nthus he pierced through a mountain near Naples and fashioned a bronze\nhorse that had power to heal all the diseases of horses. He was a\nnecromancer, and there is still shown, in a certain town in Italy, the\nmirror in which he made the dead appear. And yet a woman deceived this\ngreat sorcerer. A Neapolitan courtesan invited him to hoist himself up\nto her window in the basket that was used to bring the provisions, and\nshe left him all night suspended between two storeys.\"\n\nBrother Hilary did not appear to hear these observations.\n\n\"Virgil is a prophet,\" he replied, \"and a prophet who leaves far behind\nhim the sibyls with their sacred verses as well as the daughter of King\nPriam, and that great diviner of future things, Plato of Athens. You\nwill find in the fourth of his Syracusan cantos the birth of our Lord\nforetold in a lancune that seems of heaven rather than of earth.* In the\ntime of my early studies, when I read for the first time JAM REDIT ET\nVIRGO, I felt myself bathed in an infinite delight, but I immediately\nexperienced intense grief at the thought that, for ever deprived of the\npresence of God, the author of this prophetic verse, the noblest that\nhas come from human lips, was pining among the heathen in eternal\ndarkness. This cruel thought did not leave me. It pursued me even in\nmy studies, my prayers, my meditations, and my ascetic labours. Thinkin\nthat Virgil was deprived of the sight of God and that possibly he might\neven be suffering the fate of the reprobate in hell, I could neither\nenjoy peace nor rest, and I went so far as to exclaim several times a\nday with my arms outstretched to heaven:\n\n\"'Reveal to me, O Lord, the lot thou hast assigned to him who sang on\nearth as the angels sing in heaven!'\n\n     *Three centuries before the epoch in which our Marbodius\n     lived the words--\n\n     'Maro, vates gentilium\n     Da Christo testimonium.'\n\n     Were sung in the churches on Christmas Day.\n\n\n\"After some years my anguish ceased when I read in an old book that\nthe great apostle St. Paul, who called the Gentiles into the Church of\nChrist, went to Naples and sanctified with his tears the tomb of the\nprince of poets.* This was some ground for believing that Virgil, like\nthe Emperor Trajan, was admitted to Paradise because even in error he\nhad a presentiment of the truth. We are not compelled to believe it, but\nI can easily persuade myself that it is true.\"\n\n     *Ad maronis mausoleum\n     Ductus, fudit super eum\n     Piae rorem lacrymae.\n     Quem te, intuit, reddidissem,\n     Si te vivum invenissem\n     Poetarum maxime!\n\nHaving thus spoken, old Hilary wished me the peace of a holy night and\nwent away with Brother Jacinth.\n\nI resumed the delightful study of my poet. Book in hand, I meditated\nupon the way in which those whom Love destroys with its cruel malady\nwander through the secret paths in the depth of the myrtle forest, and,\nas I meditated, the quivering reflections of the stars came and mingled\nwith those of the leafless eglantines in the waters of the cloister\nfountain. Suddenly the lights and the perfumes and the stillness of the\nsky were overwhelmed, a fierce Northwind charged with storm and darkness\nburst roaring upon me. It lifted me up and carried me like a wisp of\nstraw over fields, cities, rivers, and mountains, and through the midst\nof thunder-clouds, during a long night composed of a whole series of\nnights and days. And when, after this prolonged and cruel rage, the\nhurricane was at last stilled, I found myself far from my native land at\nthe bottom of a valley bordered by cypress trees. Then a woman of wild\nbeauty, trailing long garments behind her, approached me. She placed\nher left hand on my shoulder, and, pointing her right arm to an oak with\nthick foliage:\n\n\"Look!\" said she to me.\n\nImmediately I recognised the Sibyl who guards the sacred wood of\nAvernus, and I discerned the fair Proserpine's beautiful golden twig\namongst the tufted boughs of the tree to which her finger pointed.\n\n\"O prophetic Virgin,\" I exclaimed, \"thou hast comprehended my desire and\nthou hast satisfied it in this way. Thou hast revealed to me the tree\nthat bears the shining twig without which none can enter alive into the\ndwelling-place of the dead. And in truth, eagerly did I long to converse\nwith the shade of Virgil.\"\n\nHaving said this, I snatched the golden branch from its ancient trunk\nand I advanced without fear into the smoking gulf that leads to the\nmiry banks of the Styx, upon which the shades are tossed about like dead\nleaves. At sight of the branch dedicated to Proserpine, Charon took\nme in his bark, which groaned beneath my weight, and I alighted on the\nshores of the dead, and was greeted by the mute baying of the threefold\nCerberus. I pretended to throw the shade of a stone at him, and the vain\nmonster fled into his cave. There, amidst the rushes, wandered the souls\nof those children whose eyes had but opened and shut to the kindly light\nof day, and there in a gloomy cavern Minos judges men. I penetrated\ninto the myrtle wood in which the victims of love wander languishing,\nPhaedra, Procris, the sad Eriphyle, Evadne, Pasiphae, Laodamia, and\nCenis, and the Phoenician Dido. Then I went through the dusty plains\nreserved for famous warriors. Beyond them open two ways. That to the\nleft leads to Tartarus, the abode of the wicked. I took that to the\nright, which leads to Elysium and to the dwellings of Dis. Having hung\nthe sacred branch at the goddess's door, I reached pleasant fields\nflooded with purple light. The shades of philosophers and poets hold\ngrave converse there. The Graces and the Muses formed sprightly choirs\nupon the grass. Old Homer sang, accompanying himself upon his rustic\nlyre. His eyes were closed, but divine images shone upon his lips. I saw\nSolon, Democritus, and Pythagoras watching the games of the young men in\nthe meadow, and, through the foliage of an ancient laurel, I perceived\nalso Hesiod, Orpheus, the melancholy Euripides, and the masculine\nSappho. I passed and recognised, as they sat on the bank of a fresh\nrivulet, the poet Horace, Varius, Gallus, and Lycoris. A little\napart, leaning against the trunk of a dark holm-oak, Virgil was gazing\npensively at the grove. Of lofty stature, though spare, he still\npreserved that swarthy complexion, that rustic air, that negligent\nbearing, and unpolished appearance which during his lifetime concealed\nhis genius. I saluted him piously and remained for a long time without\nspeech.\n\nAt last when my halting voice could proceed out of my throat:\n\n\"O thou, so dear to the Ausonian Muses, thou honour of the Latin name,\nVirgil,\" cried I, \"it is through thee I have known what beauty is, it\nis through thee I have known what the tables of the gods and the beds\nof the goddesses are like. Suffer the praises of the humblest of thy\nadorers.\"\n\n\"Arise, stranger,\" answered the divine poet. \"I perceive that thou art\na living being among the shades, and that thy body treads down the grass\nin this eternal evening. Thou art not the first man who has descended\nbefore his death into these dwellings, although all intercourse between\nus and the living is difficult. But cease from praise; I do not like\neulogies and the confused sounds of glory have always offended my ears.\nThat is why I fled from Rome, where I was known to the idle and curious,\nand laboured in the solitude of my beloved Parthenope. And then I am not\nso convinced that the men of thy generation understand my verses that\nshould be gratified by thy praises. Who art thou?\"\n\n\"I am called Marbodius of the Kingdom of Alca. I made my profession in\nthe Abbey of Corrigan. I read thy poems by day and I read them by night.\nIt is thee whom I have come to see in Hell; I was impatient to know what\nthy fate was. On earth the learned often dispute about it. Some hold\nit probable that, having lived under the power of demons, thou art now\nburning in inextinguishable flames; others, more cautious, pronounce\nno opinion, believing that all which is said concerning the dead is\nuncertain and full of lies; several, though not in truth the ablest,\nmaintain that, because thou didst elevate the tone of the Sicilian Muses\nand foretell that a new progeny would descend from heaven, thou wert\nadmitted, like the Emperor Trajan, to enjoy eternal blessedness in the\nChristian heaven.\"\n\n\"Thou seest that such is not the case,\" answered the shade, smiling.\n\n\"I meet thee in truth, O Virgil, among the heroes and sages in those\nElysian Fields which thou thyself hast described. Thus, contrary to what\nseveral on earth believe, no one has come to seek thee on the part of\nHim who reigns on high?\"\n\nAfter a rather long silence:\n\n\"I will conceal nought from thee. He sent for me; one of his messengers,\na simple man, came to say that I was expected, and that, although I\nhad not been initiated into their mysteries, in consideration of my\nprophetic verses, a place had been reserved for me among those of the\nnew sect. But I refused to accept that invitation; I had no desire\nto change my lace. I did so not because I share the admiration of the\nGreeks for the Elysian fields, or because I taste here those joys\nwhich caused Proserpine to lose the remembrance of her mother. I never\nbelieved much myself in what I say about these things in the 'Aeneid.'\nI was instructed by philosophers and men of science and I had a correct\nforeboding of the truth. Life in hell is extremely attenuated; we feel\nneither pleasure nor pain; we are as if we were not. The dead have\nno existence here except such as the living lend them. Nevertheless I\nprefer to remain here.\"\n\n\"But what reason didst thou give, O Virgil, for so strange a refusal?\"\n\n\"I gave excellent ones. I said to the messenger of the god that I did\nnot deserve the honour he brought me, and that a meaning had been given\nto my verses which they did not bear. In truth I have not in my fourth\nEclogue betrayed the faith of my ancestors. Some ignorant Jews alone\nhave interpreted in favour of a barbarian god a verse which celebrates\nthe return of the golden age predicted by the Sibylline oracles. I\nexcused myself then on the ground that I could not occupy a place which\nwas destined for me in error and to which I recognised that I had no\nright. Then I alleged my disposition and my tastes, which do not accord\nwith the customs of the new heavens.\n\n\"'I am not unsociable,' said I to this man. 'I have shown in life a\ncomplaisant and easy disposition, although the extreme simplicity of my\nhabits caused me to be suspected of avarice. I kept nothing for myself\nalone. My library was open to all and I have conformed my conduct to\nthat fine saying of Euripides, \"all ought to be common among friends.\"\nThose praises that seemed obtrusive when I myself received them became\nagreeable to me when addressed to Varius or to Macer. But at bottom I\nam rustic and uncultivated. I take pleasure in the society of animals;\nI was so zealous in observing them and took so much care of them that I\nwas regarded, not altogether wrongly, as a good veterinary surgeon. I am\ntold that the people of thy sect claim an immortal soul for themselves,\nbut refuse one to the animals. That is a piece of nonsense that makes\nme doubt their judgment. Perhaps I love the flocks and the shepherds a\nlittle too much. That would not seem right amongst you. There is a maxim\nto which I endeavour to conform my actions, \"Nothing too much.\" More\neven than my feeble health my philosophy teaches me to use things with\nmeasure. I am sober; a lettuce and some olives with a drop of Falernian\nwine form all my meals. I have, indeed, to some extent gone with strange\nwomen, but I have not delayed over long in taverns to watch the young\nSyrians dance to the sound of the crotalum.* But if I have restrained\nmy desires it was for my own satisfaction and for the sake of good\ndiscipline. To fear pleasure and to fly from joy appears to me the worst\ninsult that one can offer to nature. I am assured that during their\nlives certain of the elect of thy god abstained from food and avoided\nwomen through love of asceticism, and voluntarily exposed themselves to\nuseless sufferings. I should be afraid of meeting those, criminals whose\nfrenzy horrifies me. A poet must not be asked to attach himself too\nstrictly to any scientific or moral doctrine. Moreover, I am a Roman,\nand the Romans, unlike the Greeks, are unable to pursue profound\nspeculations in a subtle manner. If they adopt a philosophy it is above\nall in order to derive some practical advantages from it. Siro, who\nenjoyed great renown among us, taught me the system of Epicurus and thus\nfreed me from vain terrors and turned me aside from the cruelties to\nwhich religion persuades ignorant men. I have embraced the views of\nPythagoras concerning the souls of men and animals, both of which are of\ndivine essence; this invites us to look upon ourselves without pride\nand without shame. I have learnt from the Alexandrines how the earth, at\nfirst soft and without form, hardened in proportion as Nereus withdrew\nhimself from it to dig his humid dwellings; I have learned how things\nwere formed insensibly; in what manner the rains, falling from the\nburdened clouds, nourished the silent forests, and by what progress a\nfew animals at last began to wander over the nameless mountains. I could\nnot accustom myself to your cosmogony either, for it seems to me\nfitter for a camel-driver on the Syrian sands than for a disciple of\nAristarchus of Samos. And what would become of me in the abode of your\nbeatitude if I did not find there my friends, my ancestors, my masters,\nand my gods, and if it is not given to me to see Rhea's noble son, or\nVenus, mother of Aeneas, with her winning smile, or Pan, or the young\nDryads, or the Sylvans, or old Silenus, with his face stained by Aegle's\npurple mulberries.' These are the reasons which I begged that simple man\nto plead before the successor of Jupiter.\"\n\n     * This phrase seems to indicate that, if one is to believe\n     Macrobius, the \"Copa\" is by Virgil.\n\n\"And since then, O great shade, thou hast received no other messages?\"\n\n\"I have received none.\"\n\n\"To console themselves for thy absence, O Virgil, they have three poets,\nCommodianus, Prudentius, and Fortunatus, who were all three born in\nthose dark plays when neither prosody nor grammar were known. But tell\nme, O Mantuan, hast thou never received other intelligence of the God\nwhose company thou didst so deliberately refuse?\"\n\n\"Never that I remember.\"\n\n\"Hast thou not told me that I am not the first who descended alive into\nthese abodes and presented himself before thee?\"\n\n\n\"Thou dost remind me of it. A century and a half ago, or so it seems\nto me (it is difficult to reckon days and years amid the shades),\nmy profound peace was intruded upon by a strange visitor. As I was\nwandering beneath the gloomy foliage that borders the Styx, I saw\nrising before me a human form more opaque and darker than that of the\ninhabitants of these shores. I recognised a living person. He was\nof high stature, thin, with an aquiline nose, sharp chin, and hollow\ncheeks. His dark eyes shot forth fire; a red hood girt with a crown of\nlaurels bound his lean brows. His bones pierced through the tight\nbrown cloak that descended to his heels. He saluted me with deference,\ntempered by a sort of fierce pride, and addressed me in a speech more\nobscure and incorrect than that of those Gauls with whom the divine\nJulius filled both his legions and the Curia. At last I understood that\nhe had been born near Fiesole, in an ancient Etruscan colony that Sulla\nhad founded on the banks of the Arno, and which had prospered; that\nhe had obtained municipal honours, but that he had thrown himself\nvehemently into the sanguinary quarrels which arose between the senate,\nthe knights, and the people, that he had been defeated and banished, and\nnow he wandered in exile throughout the world. He described Italy to me\nas distracted by more wars and discords than in the time of my youth,\nand as sighing anew for a second Augustus. I pitied his misfortune,\nremembering what I myself had formerly endured.\n\n\"An audacious spirit unceasingly disquieted him, and his mind harboured\ngreat thoughts, but alas! his rudeness and ignorance displayed the\ntriumph of barbarism. He knew neither poetry, nor science, nor even\nthe tongue of the Greeks, and he was ignorant, too, of the ancient\ntraditions concerning the origin of the world and the nature of the\ngods. He bravely repeated fables which in my time would have brought\nsmiles to the little children who were not yet old enough to pay for\nadmission at the baths. The vulgar easily believe in monsters. The\nEtruscans especially peopled hell with demons, hideous as a sick man's\ndreams. That they have not abandoned their childish imaginings after\nso many centuries is explained by the continuation and progress of\nignorance and misery, but that one of their magistrates whose mind is\nraised above the common level should share these popular illusions and\nshould be frightened by the hideous demons that the inhabitants of that\ncountry painted on the walls of their tombs in the time of Porsena--that\nis something which might sadden even a sage. My Etruscan visitor\nrepeated verses to me which he had composed in a new dialect, called\nby him the vulgar tongue, the sense of which I could not understand.\nMy ears were more surprised than charmed as I heard him repeat the same\nsound three or four times at regular intervals in his efforts to mark\nthe rhythm. That artifice did not seem ingenious to me; but it is not\nfor the dead to judge of novelties.\n\n\"But I do not reproach this colonist of Sulla, born in an unhappy time,\nfor making inharmonious verses or for being, if it be possible, as bad a\npoet as Bavius or Maevius. I have grievances against him which touch\nme more closely. The thing is monstrous and scarcely credible, but when\nthis man returned to earth he disseminated the most odious lies about\nme. He affirmed in several passages of his barbarous poems that I had\nserved him as a guide in the modern Tartarus, a place I know nothing of.\nHe insolently proclaimed that I had spoken of the gods of Rome as false\nand lying gods, and that I held as the true God the present successor of\nJupiter. Friend, when thou art restored to the kindly light of day and\nbeholdest again thy native land, contradict those abominable falsehoods.\nSay to thy people that the singer of the pious Aeneas has never\nworshipped the god of the Jews. I am assured that his power is declining\nand that his approaching fall is manifested by undoubted indications.\nThis news would give me some pleasure if one could rejoice in these\nabodes where we feel neither fears nor desires.\"\n\nHe spoke, and with a gesture of farewell he went away. I beheld his.\nshade gliding over the asphodels without bending their stalks. I saw\nthat it became fainter and vaguer as it receded farther from me, and\nit vanished before it reached the wood of evergreen laurels. Then I\nunderstood the meaning of the words, \"The dead have no life, but that\nwhich the living lend them,\" and I walked slowly through the pale meadow\nto the gate of horn.\n\nI affirm that all in this writing is true.*\n\n     * There is in Marbodius's narrative a passage very worthy of\n     notice, viz., that in which the monk of Corrigan describes\n     Dante Alighieri such as we picture him to ourselves to-day.\n     The miniatures in a very old manuscript of the \"Divine\n     Comedy,\" the \"Codex Venetianus,\" represent the poet as a\n     little fat man clad in a short tunic, the skirts of which\n     fall above his knees. As for Virgil, he still wears the\n     philosophical beard, in the wood-engravings of the sixteenth\n     century.\n\nOne would not have thought either that Marbodius, or even Virgil, could\nhave known the Etruscan tombs of Chiusi and Corneto, where, in fact,\nthere are horrible and burlesque devils closely resembling those of\nOrcagna. Nevertheless, the authenticity of the \"Descent of Marbodius\ninto Hell\" is indisputable. M. du Clos des Lunes has firmly established\nit. To doubt it would be to doubt palaeography itself.\n\n\n\n\nVII. SIGNS IN THE MOON\n\nAt that time, whilst Penguinia was still plunged in ignorance and\nbarbarism, Giles Bird-catcher, a Franciscan monk, known by his writings\nunder the name Aegidius Aucupis, devoted himself with indefatigable\nzeal to the study of letters and the sciences. He gave his nights to\nmathematics and music, which he called the two adorable sisters,\nthe harmonious daughters of Number and Imagination. He was versed in\nmedicine and astrology. He was suspected of practising magic, and it\nseemed true that he wrought metamorphoses and discovered hidden things.\n\nThe monks of his convent, finding in his cell Greek books which they\ncould not read, imagined them to be conjuring-books, and denounced their\ntoo learned brother as a wizard. Aegidius Aucupis fled, and reached the\nisland of Ireland, where he lived for thirty studious years. He went\nfrom monastery to monastery, searching for and copying the Greek and\nLatin manuscripts which they contained. He also studied physics and\nalchemy. He acquired a universal knowledge and discovered notable\nsecrets concerning animals, plants, and stones. He was found one day in\nthe company of a very beautiful woman who sang to her own accompaniment\non the lute, and who was afterwards discovered to be a machine which he\nhad himself constructed.\n\nHe often crossed the Irish Sea to go into the land of Wales and to visit\nthe libraries of the monasteries there. During one of these crossings,\nas he remained during the night on the bridge of the ship, he saw\nbeneath the waters two sturgeons swimming side by side. He had very\ngood hearing and he knew the language of fishes. Now he heard one of the\nsturgeons say to the other:\n\n\"The man in the moon, whom we have often seen carrying fagots on his\nshoulders, has fallen into the sea.\"\n\nAnd the other sturgeon said in its turn:\n\n\"And in the silver disc there will be seen the image of two lovers\nkissing each other on the mouth.\"\n\nSome years later, having returned to his native country, Aegidius\nAucupis found that ancient learning had been restored. Manners had\nsoftened. Men no longer pursued the nymphs of the fountains, of the\nwoods, and of the mountains with their insults. They placed images of\nthe Muses and of the modest Graces in their gardens, and they rendered\nher former honours to the Goddess with ambrosial lips, the joy of men\nand gods. They were becoming reconciled to nature. They trampled vain\nterrors beneath their feet and raised their eyes to heaven without\nfearing, as they formerly did, to read signs of anger and threats of\ndamnation in the skies.\n\nAt this spectacle Aegidius Aucupis remembered what the two sturgeons of\nthe sea of Erin had foretold.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBOOK IV. MODERN TIMES: TRINCO\n\n\n\n\nI. MOTHER ROUQUIN\n\nAegidius Aucupis, the Erasmus of the Penguins, was not mistaken; his age\nwas an age of free inquiry. But that great man mistook the elegances\nof the humanists for softness of manners, and he did not foresee\nthe effects that the awaking of intelligence would have amongst\nthe Penguins. It brought about the religious Reformation; Catholics\nmassacred Protestants and Protestants massacred Catholics. Such were\nthe first results of liberty of thought. The Catholics prevailed in\nPenguinia. But the spirit of inquiry had penetrated among them without\ntheir knowing it. They joined reason to faith, and claimed that religion\nhad been divested of the superstitious practices that dishonoured it,\njust as in later days the booths that the cobblers, hucksters, and\ndealers in old clothes had built against the walls of the cathedrals\nwere cleared away. The word, legend, which at first indicated what the\nfaithful ought to read, soon suggested the idea of pious fables and\nchildish tales.\n\nThe saints had to suffer from this state of mind. An obscure canon\ncalled Princeteau, a very austere and crabbed man, designated so great a\nnumber of them as not worthy of having their days observed, that he was\nsurnamed the exposer of the saints. He did not think, for instance,\nthat if St. Margaret's prayer were applied as a poultice to a woman in\ntravail that the pains of childbirth would be softened.\n\nEven the venerable patron saint of Penguinia did not escape his rigid\ncriticism. This is what he says of her in his \"Antiquities of Alca\":\n\n\"Nothing is more uncertain than the history, or even the existence, of\nSt. Orberosia. An ancient anonymous annalist, a monk of Dombes, relates\nthat a woman called Orberosia was possessed by the devil in a cavern\nwhere, even down to his own days, the little boys and girls of the\nvillage used to play at a sort of game representing the devil and\nthe fair Orberosia. He adds that this woman became the concubine of a\nhorrible dragon, who ravaged the country. Such a statement is hardly\ncredible, but the history of Orberosia, as it has since been related,\nseems hardly more worthy of belief. The life of that saint by the Abbot\nSimplicissimus is three hundred years later than the pretended events\nwhich it relates and that author shows himself excessively credulous and\ndevoid of all critical faculty.\"\n\nSuspicion attacked even the supernatural origin of the Penguins. The\nhistorian Ovidius Capito went so far as to deny the miracle of their\ntransformation. He thus begins his \"Annals of Penguinia\":\n\n\"A dense obscurity envelopes this history, and it would be no\nexaggeration to say that it is a tissue of puerile fables and popular\ntales. The Penguins claim that they are descended from birds who were\nbaptized by St. Mael and whom God changed into men at the intercession\nof that glorious apostle. They hold that, situated at first in the\nfrozen ocean, their island, floating like Delos, was brought to anchor\nin these heaven-favoured seas, of which it is to-day the queen. I\nconclude that this myth is a reminiscence of the ancient migrations of\nthe Penguins.\"\n\nIn the following century, which was that of the philosophers, scepticism\nbecame still more acute. No further evidence of it is needed than the\nfollowing celebrated passage from the \"Moral Essay\":\n\n\"Arriving we know not from whence (for indeed their origins are not very\nclear), and successively invaded and conquered by four or five peoples\nfrom the north, south, east, and west, miscegenated, interbred,\namalgamated, and commingled, the Penguins boast of the purity of their\nrace, and with justice, for they have become a pure race. This mixture\nof all mankind, red, black, yellow, and white, round-headed and\nlong-headed, as formed in the course of ages a fairly homogeneous human\nfamily, and one which is recognisable by certain features due to a\ncommunity of life and customs.\n\n\"This idea that they belong to the best race in the world, and that\nthey are its finest family, inspires them with noble pride, indomitable\ncourage, and a hatred for the human race.\n\n\"The life of a people is but a succession of miseries, crimes, and\nfollies. This is true of the Penguin nation, as of all other nations.\nSave for this exception its history is admirable from beginning to end.\"\n\nThe two classic ages of the Penguins are too well-known for me to lay\nstress upon them. But what has not been sufficiently noticed is the way\nin which the rationalist theologians such as Canon Princeteau called\ninto existence the unbelievers of the succeeding age. The former\nemployed their reason to destroy what did not seem to them, essential\nto their religion; they only left untouched the most rigid article of\nfaith. Their intellectual successors, being taught by them how to\nmake use of science and reason, employed them against whatever beliefs\nremained. Thus rational theology engendered natural philosophy.\n\nThat is why (if I may turn from the Penguins of former days to the\nSovereign Pontiff, who, to-day governs the universal Church) we cannot\nadmire too greatly the wisdom of Pope Pius X. in condemning the study\nof exegesis as contrary to revealed truth, fatal to sound theological\ndoctrine, and deadly to the faith. Those clerics who maintain the rights\nof science in opposition to him are pernicious doctors and pestilent\nteachers, and the faithful who approve of them are lacking in either\nmental or moral ballast.\n\nAt the end of the age of philosophers, the ancient kingdom of Penguinia\nwas utterly destroyed, the king put to death, the privileges of the\nnobles abolished, and a Republic proclaimed in the midst of public\nmisfortunes and while a terrible war was raging. The assembly which\nthen governed Penguinia ordered all the metal articles contained in the\nchurches to be melted down. The patriots even desecrated the tombs of\nthe kings. It is said that when the tomb of Draco the Great was opened,\nthat king presented an appearance as black as ebony and so majestic\nthat those who profaned his corpse fled in terror. According to other\naccounts, these churlish men insulted him by putting a pipe in his mouth\nand derisively offering him a glass of wine.\n\nOn the seventeenth day of the month of Mayflowers, the shrine of\nSt. Orberosia, which had for five hundred years been exposed to the\nveneration of the faithful in the Church of St. Mael, was transported\ninto the town-hall and submitted to the examination of a jury of experts\nappointed by the municipality. It was made of gilded copper in shape\nlike the nave of a church, entirely covered with enamels and decorated\nwith precious stones, which latter were perceived to be false. The\nchapter in its foresight had removed the rubies, sapphires, emeralds,\nand great balls of rock-crystal, and had substituted pieces of glass in\ntheir place. It contained only a little dust and a piece of old linen,\nwhich were thrown into a great fire that had been lighted on the Place\nde Greve to burn the relics of the saints. The people danced around it\nsinging patriotic songs.\n\nFrom the threshold of their booth, which leant against the town-hall,\na man called Rouquin and his wife were watching this group of madmen.\nRouquin clipped dogs and gelded cats; he also frequented the inns. His\nwife was a ragpicker and a bawd, but she had plenty of shrewdness.\n\n\"You see, Rouquin,\" said she to her man, \"they are committing a\nsacrilege. They will repent of it.\"\n\n\"You know nothing about it, wife,\" answered Rouquin; \"they, have become\nphilosophers, and when one is once a philosopher he is a philosopher for\never.\"\n\n\"I tell you, Rouquin, that sooner or later they will regret what they\nare doing to-day. They ill-treat the saints because they have not helped\nthem enough, but for all that the quails won't fall ready cooked into\ntheir mouths. They will soon find themselves as badly off as before, and\nwhen they have put out their tongues for enough they will become pious\nagain. Sooner than people think the day will come when Penguinia will\nagain begin to honour her blessed patron. Rouquin, it would be a good\nthing, in readiness for that day, if we kept a handful of ashes and some\nrags and bones in an old pot in our lodgings. We will say that they are\nthe relics of St. Orberosia and that we have saved them from the flames\nat the peril of our lives. I am greatly mistaken if we don't get honour\nand profit out of them. That good action might be worth a place from the\nCure to sell tapers and hire chairs in the chapel of St. Orberosia.\"\n\nOn that same day Mother Rouquin took home with her a little ashes and\nsome bones, and put them in an old jam-pot in her cupboard.\n\n\n\n\nII. TRINCO\n\nThe sovereign Nation had taken possession of the lands of the nobility\nand clergy to sell them at a low price to the middle classes and\nthe peasants. The middle classes and the peasants thought that the\nrevolution was a good thing for acquiring lands and a bad one for\nretaining them.\n\nThe legislators of the Republic made terrible laws for the defence of\nproperty, and decreed death to anyone who should propose a division of\nwealth. But that did not avail the Republic. The peasants who had become\nproprietors bethought themselves that though it had made them rich,\nthe Republic had nevertheless caused a disturbance to wealth, and they\ndesired a system more respectful of private property and more capable of\nassuring the permanence of the new institutions.\n\nThey had not long to wait. The Republic, like Agrippina, bore her\ndestroyer in her bosom.\n\nHaving great wars to carry on, it created military forces, and these\nwere destined both to save it and to destroy it. Its legislators thought\nthey could restrain their generals by the fear of punishment, but if\nthey sometimes cut off the heads of unlucky soldiers they could not do\nthe same to the fortunate soldiers who obtained over it the advantages\nof having saved its existence.\n\nIn the enthusiasm of victory the renovated Penguins delivered themselves\nup to a dragon, more terrible than that of their fables, who, like\na stork amongst frogs, devoured them for fourteen years with his\ninsatiable beak.\n\nHalf a century after the reign of the new dragon a young Maharajah\nof Malay, called Djambi, desirous, like the Scythian Anacharsis,\nof instructing himself by travel, visited Penguinia and wrote an\ninteresting account of his travels. I transcribe the first page of his\naccount:\n\nACCOUNT OF THE TRAVELS OF YOUNG DJAMBI IN PENGUINIA\n\nAfter a voyage of ninety days I landed at the vast and deserted port of\nthe Penguins and travelled over untilled fields to their ruined capital.\nSurrounded by ramparts and full of barracks and arsenals it had a\nmartial though desolate appearance. Feeble and crippled men wandered\nproudly through the streets, wearing old uniforms and carrying rusty\nweapons.\n\n\"What do you want?\" I was rudely asked at the gate of the city by a\nsoldier whose moustaches pointed to the skies.\n\n\"Sir,\" I answered, \"I come as an inquirer to visit this island.\"\n\n\"It is not an island,\" replied the soldier.\n\n\"What!\" I exclaimed, \"Penguin Island is not an island?\"\n\n\"No, sir, it is an insula. It was formerly called an island, but for a\ncentury it has been decreed that it shall bear the name of insula. It is\nthe only insula in the whole universe. Have you a passport?\"\n\n\"Here it is.\"\n\n\"Go and get it signed at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\"\n\nA lame guide who conducted me came to a pause in a vast square.\n\n\"The insula,\" said he, \"has given birth, as you know, to Trinco, the\ngreatest genius of the universe, whose statue you see before you. That\nobelisk standing to your right commemorates Trinco's birth; the column\nthat rises to your left has Trinco crowned with a diadem upon its\nsummit. You see here the triumphal arch dedicated to the glory of Trinco\nand his family.\"\n\n\"What extraordinary feat has Trinco performed?\" I asked.\n\n\"War.\"\n\n\"That is nothing extraordinary. We Malayans make war constantly.\"\n\n\"That may be, but Trinco is the greatest warrior of all countries and\nall times. There never existed a greater conqueror than he. As you\nanchored in our port you saw to the east a volcanic island called\nAmpelophoria, shaped like a cone, and of small size, but renowned for\nits wines. And to the west a larger island which raises to the sky a\nlong range of sharp teeth; for this reason it is called the Dog's Jaws.\nIt is rich in copper mines. We possessed both before Trinco's reign\nand they were the boundaries of our empire. Trinco extended the Penguin\ndominion over the Archipelago of the Turquoises and the Green Continent,\nsubdued the gloomy Porpoises, and planted his flag amid the icebergs\nof the Pole and on the burning sands of the African deserts. He raised\ntroops in all the countries he conquered, and when his armies marched\npast in the wake of our own light infantry, our island grenadiers, our\nhussars, our dragoons, our artillery, and our engineers there were to be\nseen yellow soldiers looking in their blue armour like crayfish standing\non their tails; red men with parrots' plumes, tattooed with solar and\nPhallic emblems, and with quivers of poisoned arrows resounding on\ntheir backs; naked blacks armed only with their teeth and nails; pygmies\nriding on cranes; gorillas carrying trunks of trees and led by an old\nape who wore upon his hairy breast the cross of the Legion of Honour.\nAnd all those troops, led to Trinco's banner by the most ardent\npatriotism, flew on from victory to victory, and in thirty years of war\nTrinco conquered half the known world.\"\n\n\"What!\" cried I, \"you possess half of the world.\"\n\n\"Trinco conquered it for us, and Trinco lost it to us. As great in his\ndefeats as in his victories he surrendered all that he had conquered.\nHe even allowed those two islands we possessed before his time,\nAmpelophoria and the Dog's Jaws, to be taken from us. He left Penguinia\nimpoverished and depopulated. The flower of the insula perished in his\nwars. At the time of his fall there were left in our country none but\nthe hunchbacks and cripples from whom we are descended. But he gave us\nglory.\"\n\n\"He made you pay dearly for it!\"\n\n\"Glory never costs too much,\" replied my guide.\n\n\n\n\nIII. THE JOURNEY OF DOCTOR OBNUBILE\n\nAfter a succession of amazing vicissitudes, the memory of which is in\ngreat part lost by the wrongs of time and the bad style of historians,\nthe Penguins established the government of the Penguins by themselves.\nThey elected a diet or assembly, and invested it with the privilege of\nnaming the Head of the State. The latter, chosen from among the simple\nPenguins, wore no formidable monster's crest upon his head and exercised\nno absolute authority over the people. He was himself subject to the\nlaws of the nation. He was not given the title of king, and no ordinal\nnumber followed his name. He bore such names as Paturle, Janvion,\nTraffaldin, Coquenhot, and Bredouille. These magistrates did not make\nwar. They were not suited for that.\n\nThe new state received the name of Public Thing or Republic. Its\npartisans were called republicanists or republicans. They were also\nnamed Thingmongers and sometimes Scamps, but this latter name was taken\nin ill part.\n\nThe Penguin democracy did not itself govern. It obeyed a financial\noligarchy which formed opinion by means of the newspapers, and held\nin its hands the representatives, the ministers, and the president.\nIt controlled the finances of the republic, and directed the foreign\naffairs of the country as if it were possessed of sovereign power.\n\nEmpires and kingdoms in those days kept up enormous fleets. Penguinia,\ncompelled to do as they did, sank under the pressure of her armaments.\nEverybody deplored or pretended to deplore so grievous a necessity.\nHowever, the rich, and those engaged in business or affairs, submitted\nto it with a good heart through a spirit of patriotism, and because they\ncounted on the soldiers and sailors to defend their goods at home and\nto acquire markets and territories abroad. The great manufacturers\nencouraged the making of cannons and ships through a zeal for the\nnational defence and in order to obtain orders. Among the citizens of\nmiddle rank and of the liberal professions some resigned themselves to\nthis state of affairs without complaining, believing that it would last\nfor ever; others waited impatiently for its end and thought they might\nbe able to lead the powers to a simultaneous disarmament.\n\nThe illustrious Professor Obnubile belonged to this latter class.\n\n\"War,\" said he, \"is a barbarity to which the progress of civilization\nwill put an end. The great democracies are pacific and will soon impose\ntheir will upon the aristocrats.\"\n\nProfessor Obnubile, who had for sixty years led a solitary and retired\nlife in his laboratory, whither external noises did not penetrate,\nresolved to observe the spirit of the peoples for himself. He began\nhis studies with the greatest of all democracies and set sail for New\nAtlantis.\n\nAfter a voyage of fifteen days his steamer entered, during the night,\nthe harbour of Titanport, where thousands of ships were anchored. An\niron bridge thrown across the water and shining with lights, stretched\nbetween two piers so far apart that Professor Obnubile imagined he was\nsailing on the seas of Saturn and that he saw the marvellous ring which\ngirds the planet of the Old Man. And this immense conduit bore upon it\nmore than a quarter of the wealth of the world. The learned Penguin,\nhaving disembarked, was waited on by automatons in a hotel forty-eight\nstories high. Then he took the great railway that led to Gigantopolis,\nthe capital of New Atlantis. In the train there were restaurants,\ngaming-rooms, athletic arenas, telegraphic, commercial, and financial\noffices, a Protestant Church, and the printing-office of a great\nnewspaper, which latter the doctor was unable to read, as he did not\nknow the language of the New Atlantans. The train passed along the banks\nof great rivers, through manufacturing cities which concealed the sky\nwith the smoke from their chimneys, towns black in the day, towns red at\nnight, full of noise by day and full of noise also by night.\n\n\"Here,\" thought the doctor, \"is a people far too much engaged in\nindustry and trade to make war. I am already certain that the New\nAtlantans pursue a policy of peace. For it is an axiom admitted by all\neconomists that peace without and peace within are necessary for the\nprogress of commerce and industry.\"\n\nAs he surveyed Gigantopolis, he was confirmed in this opinion. People\nwent through the streets so swiftly propelled by hurry that they knocked\ndown all who were in their way. Obnubile was thrown down several times,\nbut soon succeeded in learning how to demean himself better; after an\nhour's walking he himself knocked down an Atlantan.\n\nHaving reached a great square he saw the portico of a palace in the\nClassic style, whose Corinthian columns reared their capitals of\narborescent acanthus seventy metres above the stylobate.\n\nAs he stood with his head thrown back admiring the building, a man of\nmodest appearance approached him and said in Penguin:\n\n\"I see by your dress that you are from Penguinia. I know your language;\nI am a sworn interpreter. This is the Parliament palace. At the present\nmoment the representatives of the States are in deliberation. Would you\nlike to be present at the sitting?\"\n\nThe doctor was brought into the hall and cast his looks upon the crowd\nof legislators who were sitting on cane chairs with their feet upon\ntheir desks.\n\nThe president arose and, in the midst of general inattention, muttered\nrather than spoke the following formulas which the interpreter\nimmediately translated to the doctor.\n\n\"The war for the opening of the Mongol markets being ended to the\nsatisfaction of the States, I propose that the accounts be laid before\nthe finance committee . . . .\"\n\n\"Is there any opposition? . . .\"\n\n\"The proposal is carried.\"\n\n\"The war for the opening of the markets of Third-Zealand being ended\nto the satisfaction of the States, I propose that the accounts be laid\nbefore the finance committee. . . .\"\n\n\"Is there any opposition? . . .\"\n\n\"The proposal is carried.\"\n\n\"Have I heard aright?\" asked Professor Obnubile. \"What? you an\nindustrial people and engaged in all these wars!\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" answered the interpreter, \"these are industrial wars.\nPeoples who have neither commerce nor industry are not obliged to make\nwar, but a business people is forced to adopt a policy of conquest. The\nnumber of wars necessarily increases with our productive activity. As\nsoon as one of our industries fails to find a market for its products\na war is necessary to open new outlets. It is in this way we have had\na coal war, a copper war, and a cotton war. In Third-Zealand we have\nkilled two-thirds of the inhabitants in order to compel the remainder to\nbuy our umbrellas and braces.\"\n\nAt that moment a fat man who was sitting in the middle of the assembly\nascended the tribune.\n\n\"I claim,\" said he, \"a war against the Emerald Republic, which\ninsolently contends with our pigs for the hegemony of hams and sauces in\nall the markets of the universe.\"\n\n\"Who is that legislator?\" asked Doctor Obnubile.\n\n\"He is a pig merchant.\"\n\n\"Is there any opposition?\" said the President. \"I put the proposition to\nthe vote.\"\n\nThe war against the Emerald Republic was voted with uplifted hands by a\nvery large majority.\n\n\"What?\" said Obnubile to the interpreter; \"you have voted a war with\nthat rapidity and that indifference!\"\n\n\"Oh! it is an unimportant war which will hardly cost eight million\ndollars.\"\n\n\"And men . . .\"\n\n\"The men are included in the eight million dollars.\"\n\nThen Doctor Obnubile bent his head in bitter reflection.\n\n\"Since wealth and civilization admit of as many causes of wars as\npoverty and barbarism, since the folly and wickedness of men are\nincurable, there remains but one good action to be done. The wise man\nwill collect enough dynamite to blow up this planet. When its fragments\nfly through space an imperceptible amelioration will be accomplished\nin the universe and a satisfaction will be given to the universal\nconscience. Moreover, this universal conscience does not exist.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBOOK V. MODERN TIMES: CHATILLON\n\n\n\n\nI. THE REVEREND FATHERS AGARIC AND CORNEMUSE\n\nEvery system of government produces people who are dissatisfied. The\nRepublic or Public Thing produced them at first from among the nobles\nwho had been despoiled of their ancient privileges. These looked with\nregret and hope to Prince Crucho, the last of the Draconides, a prince\nadorned both with the grace of youth and the melancholy of exile.\nIt also produced them from among the smaller traders, who, owing to\nprofound economic causes, no longer gained a livelihood. They believed\nthat this was the fault of the republic which they had at first adored\nand from which each day they were now becoming more detached. The\nfinanciers, both Christians and Jews, became by their insolence and\ntheir cupidity the scourge of the country, which they plundered and\ndegraded, as well as the scandal of a government which they never\ntroubled either to destroy or preserve, so confident were they that they\ncould operate without hindrance under all governments. Nevertheless,\ntheir sympathies inclined to absolute power as the best protection\nagainst the socialists, their puny but ardent adversaries. And just\nas they imitated the habits of the aristocrats, so they imitated their\npolitical and religious sentiments. Their women, in particular, loved\nthe Prince and had dreams of appearing one day at his Court.\n\nHowever, the Republic retained some partisans and defenders. If it was\nnot in a position to believe in the fidelity of its own officials it\ncould at least still count on the devotion of the manual labourers,\nalthough it had never relieved their misery. These came forth in crowds\nfrom their quarries and their factories to defend it, and marched in\nlong processions, gloomy, emaciated, and sinister. They would have died\nfor it because it had given them hope.\n\nNow, under the Presidency of Theodore Formose, there lived in a\npeaceable suburb of Alca a monk called Agaric, who kept a school and\nassisted in arranging marriages. In his school he taught fencing and\nriding to the sons of old families, illustrious by their birth, but now\nas destitute of wealth as of privilege. And as soon as they were old\nenough he married them to the daughters of the opulent and despised\ncaste of financiers.\n\nTall, thin, and dark, Agaric used to walk in deep thought, with\nhis breviary in his hand and his brow loaded with care, through the\ncorridors of the school and the alleys of the garden. His care was not\nlimited to inculcating in his pupils abstruse doctrines and mechanical\nprecepts and to endowing them afterwards with legitimate and rich\nwives. He entertained political designs and pursued the realisation of\na gigantic plan. His thought of thoughts and labour of labours was\nto overthrow the Republic. He was not moved to this by any personal\ninterest. He believed that a democratic state was opposed to the holy\nsociety to which body and soul he belonged. And all the other monks, his\nbrethren, thought the same. The Republic was perpetually at strife with\nthe congregation of monks and the assembly of the faithful. True,\nto plot the death of the new government was a difficult and perilous\nenterprise. Still, Agaric was in a position to carry on a formidable\nconspiracy. At that epoch, when the clergy guided the superior classes\nof the Penguins, this monk exercised a tremendous influence over the\naristocracy of Alca.\n\nAll the young men whom he had brought up waited only for a favourable\nmoment to march against the popular power. The sons of the ancient\nfamilies did not practise the arts or engage in business. They were\nalmost all soldiers and served the Republic. They served it, but\nthey did not love it; they regretted the dragon's crest. And the fair\nJewesses shared in these regrets in order that they might be taken for\nChristians.\n\nOne July as he was walking in a suburban street which ended in some\ndusty fields, Agaric heard groans coming from a moss-grown well that had\nbeen abandoned by the gardeners. And almost immediately he was told by\na cobbler of the neighbourhood that a ragged man who had shouted out\n\"Hurrah for the Republic!\" had been thrown into the well by some cavalry\nofficers who were passing, and had sunk up to his ears in the mud.\nAgaric was quite ready to see a general significance in this particular\nfact. He inferred a great fermentation in the whole aristocratic and\nmilitary caste, and concluded that it was the moment to act.\n\nThe next day he went to the end of the Wood of Conils to visit the\ngood Father Cornemuse. He found the monk in his laboratory pouring a\ngolden-coloured liquor into a still. He was a short, fat, little man,\nwith vermilion-tinted cheeks and an elaborately polished bald head. His\neyes had ruby-coloured pupils like a guinea-pig's. He graciously saluted\nhis visitor and offered him a glass of the St. Orberosian liqueur, which\nhe manufactured, and from the sale of which he gained immense wealth.\n\nAgaric made a gesture of refusal. Then, standing on his long feet and\npressing his melancholy hat against his stomach, he remained silent.\n\n\"Take a seat,\" said Cornemuse to him.\n\nAgaric sat down on a rickety stool, but continued mute.\n\nThen the monk of Conils inquired:\n\n\"Tell me some news of your young pupils. Have the dear children sound\nviews?\"\n\n\"I am very satisfied with them,\" answered the teacher. \"It is everything\nto be nurtured in sound principles. It is necessary to have sound views\nbefore having any views at all, for afterwards it is too late. . . .\nYes, I have great grounds for comfort. But we live in a sad age.\"\n\n\"Alas!\" sighed Cornemuse.\n\n\"We are passing through evil days. . . .\"\n\n\"Times of trial.\"\n\n\"Yet, Cornemuse, the mind of the public is not so entirely corrupted as\nit seems.\"\n\n\"Perhaps you are right.\"\n\n\"The people are tired of a government that ruins them and does nothing\nfor them. Every day fresh scandals spring up. The Republic is sunk in\nshame. It is ruined.\"\n\n\"May God grant it!\"\n\n\"Cornemuse, what do you think of Prince Crucho?\"\n\n\"He is an amiable young man and, I dare say, a worthy scion of an august\nstock. I pity him for having to endure the pains of exile at so early an\nage. Spring has no flowers for the exile, and autumn no fruits. Prince\nCrucho has sound views; he respects the clergy; he practises our\nreligion; besides, he consumes a good deal of my little products.\"\n\n\"Cornemuse, in many homes, both rich and poor, his return is hoped for.\nBelieve me, he will come back.\"\n\n\"May I live to throw my mantle beneath his feet!\" sighed Cornemuse.\n\nSeeing that he held these sentiments, Agaric depicted to him the state\nof people's minds such as he himself imagined them. He showed him the\nnobles and the rich exasperated against the popular government; the army\nrefusing to endure fresh insults; the officials willing to betray their\nchiefs; the people discontented, riot ready to burst forth, and the\nenemies of the monks, the agents of the constituted authority, thrown\ninto the wells of Alca. He concluded that it was the moment to strike a\ngreat blow.\n\n\"We can,\" he cried, \"save the Penguin people, we can deliver it from\nits tyrants, deliver it from itself, restore the Dragon's crest,\nre-establish the ancient State, the good State, for the honour of the\nfaith and the exaltation of the Church. We can do this if we will. We\npossess great wealth and we exert secret influences; by our evangelistic\nand outspoken journals we communicate with all the ecclesiastics\nin towns and county alike, and we inspire them with our own eager\nenthusiasm and our own burning faith. They will kindle their penitents\nand their congregations. I can dispose of the chiefs of the army; I have\nan understanding with the men of the people. Unknown to them I sway\nthe minds of umbrella sellers, publicans, shopmen, gutter merchants,\nnewspaper boys, women of the streets, and police agents. We have more\npeople on our side than we need. What are we waiting for? Let us act!\"\n\n\"What do you think of doing?\" asked Cornemuse.\n\n\"Of forming a vast conspiracy and overthrowing the Republic, of\nre-establishing Crucho on the throne of the Draconides.\"\n\nCornemuse moistened his lips with his tongue several times. Then he said\nwith unction:\n\n\"Certainly the restoration of the Draconides is desirable; it is\neminently desirable; and for my part, desire it with all my heart. As\nfor the Republic, you know what I think of it. . . . But would it not te\nbetter to abandon it to its fate and let it die of the vices of its own\nconstitution? Doubtless, Agaric, what you propose is noble and generous.\nIt would be a fine thing to save this great and unhappy country, to\nre-establish it in its ancient splendour. But reflect on it, we\nare Christians before we are Penguins. And we must take heed not to\ncompromise religion in political enterprises.\"\n\nAgaric replied eagerly:\n\n\"Fear nothing. We shall hold all the threads of the plot, but we\nourselves shall remain in the background. We shall not be seen.\"\n\n\"Like flies in milk,\" murmured the monk of Conils.\n\nAnd turning his keen ruby-coloured eyes towards his brother monk:\n\n\"Take care. Perhaps the Republic is stronger than it seems. Possibly,\ntoo, by dragging it out of the nerveless inertia in which it now rests\nwe may only consolidate its forces. Its malice is great; if we attack\nit, it will defend itself. It makes bad laws which hardly affect us;\nif it is frightened it will make terrible ones against us. Let us not\nlightly engage in an adventure in which we may get fleeced. You think\nthe opportunity a good one. I don't, and I am going to tell you why. The\npresent government is not yet known by everybody, that is to say, it is\nknown by nobody. It proclaims that it is the Public Thing, the common\nthing. The populace believes it and remains democratic and Republican.\nBut patience! This same people will one day demand that the public thing\nbe the people's thing. I need not tell you how insolent, unregulated,\nand contrary to Scriptural polity such claims seem to me. But the people\nwill make them, and enforce them, and then there will be an end of the\npresent government. The moment cannot now be far distant; and it is then\nthat we ought to act in the interests of our august body. Let us wait.\nWhat hurries us? Our existence is not in peril. It has not been\nrendered absolutely intolerable to us. The Republic fails in respect and\nsubmission to us; it does not give the priests the honours it owes them.\nBut it lets us live. And such is the excellence of our position that\nwith us to live is to prosper. The Republic is hostile to us, but women\nrevere us. President Formose does not assist at the celebration of our\nmysteries, but I have seen his wife and daughters at my feet. They\nbuy my phials by the gross. I have no better clients even among the\naristocracy. Let us say what there is to be said for it. There is no\ncountry in the world as good for priests and monks as Penguinia. In what\nother country would you find our virgin wax, our virile incense, our\nrosaries, our scapulars, our holy water, and our St. Orberosian liqueur\nsold in such great quantities? What other people would, like the\nPenguins, give a hundred golden crowns for a wave of our hands, a sound\nfrom our mouths, a movement of our lips? For my part, I gain a thousand\ntimes more, in this pleasant, faithful, and docile Penguinia, by\nextracting the essence from a bundle of thyme, than I could make\nby tiring my lungs with preaching the remission of sins in the most\npopulous states of Europe and America. Honestly, would Penguinia be\nbetter off if a police officer came to take me away from here and put me\non a steamboat bound for the Islands of Night?\"\n\nHaving thus spoken, the monk of Conils got up and led his guest into\na huge shed where hundreds of orphans clothed in blue were packing\nbottles, nailing up cases, and gumming tickets. The ear was deafened\nby the noise of hammers mingled with the dull rumbling of bales being\nplaced upon the rails.\n\n\"It is from here that consignments are forwarded,\" said Cornemuse.\n\"I have obtained from the government a railway through the Wood and\na station at my door. Every three days I fill a truck with my own\nproducts. You see that the Republic has not killed all beliefs.\"\n\nAgaric made a last effort to engage the wise distiller in his\nenterprise. He pointed him to a prompt, certain, dazzling success.\n\n\"Don't you wish to share in it?\" he added. \"Don't you wish to bring back\nyour king from exile?\"\n\n\"Exile is pleasant to men of good will,\" answered the monk of Conils.\n\"If you are guided by me, my dear Brother Agaric, you will give up your\nproject for the present. For my own part I have no illusions. Whether or\nnot I belong to your party, if you lose, I shall have to pay like you.\"\n\nFather Agaric took leave of his friend and went back satisfied to his\nschool. \"Cornemuse,\" thought he, \"not being able to prevent the plot,\nwould like to make it succeed and he will give money.\" Agaric was not\ndeceived. Such, indeed, was the solidarity among priests and monks that\nthe acts of a single one bound them all. That was at once both their\nstrength and their weakness.\n\n\n\n\nII. PRINCE CRUCHO\n\nAgaric resolved to proceed without delay to Prince Crucho, who honoured\nhim with his familiarity. In the dusk of the evening he went out of his\nschool by the side door, disguised as a cattle merchant and took passage\non board the St. Mael.\n\nThe next day he landed in Porpoisea, for it was at Chitterlings Castle\non this hospitable soil that Crucho ate the bitter bread of exile.\n\nAgaric met the Prince on the road driving in a motor-car with two young\nladies at the rate of a hundred miles an hour. When the monk saw him he\nshook his red umbrella and the prince stopped his car.\n\n\"Is it you, Agaric? Get in! There are already three of us, but we can\nmake room for you. You can take one of these young ladies on your knee.\"\n\nThe pious Agaric got in.\n\n\"What news, worthy father?\" asked the young prince.\n\n\"Great news,\" answered Agaric. \"Can I speak?\"\n\n\"You can. I have nothing secret from these two ladies.\"\n\n\"Sire, Penguinia claims you. You will not be deaf to her call.\"\n\nAgaric described the state of feeling and outlined a vast plot.\n\n\"On my first signal,\" said he, \"all your partisans will rise at once.\nWith cross in hand and habits girded up, your venerable clergy will lead\nthe armed crowd into Formose's palace. We shall carry terror and death\namong your enemies. For a reward of our efforts we only ask of you,\nSire, that you will not render them useless. We entreat you to come and\nseat yourself on the throne that we shall prepare.\"\n\nThe prince returned a simple answer:\n\n\"I shall enter Alca on a green horse.\"\n\nAgaric declared that he accepted this manly response. Although, contrary\nto his custom, he had a lady on his knee, he adjured the young prince,\nwith a sublime loftiness of soul, to be faithful to his royal duties.\n\n\"Sire,\" he cried, with tears in his eyes, \"you will live to remember\nthe day on which you have been restored from exile, given back to your\npeople, reestablished on the throne of your ancestors by the hands of\nyour monks, and crowned by them with the august crest of the Dragon.\nKing Crucho, may you equal the glory of your ancestor Draco the Great!\"\n\nThe young prince threw himself with emotion on his restorer and\nattempted to embrace him, but he was prevented from reaching him by\nthe girth of the two ladies, so tightly packed were they all in that\nhistoric carriage.\n\n\"Worthy father,\" said he, \"I would like all Penguinia to witness this\nembrace.\"\n\n\"It would be a cheering spectacle,\" said Agaric.\n\nIn the mean time the motor-car rushed like a tornado through hamlets\nand villages, crushing hens, geese, turkeys, ducks, guinea-fowls, cats,\ndogs, pigs, children, labourers, and women beneath its insatiable tyres.\nAnd the pious Agaric turned over his great designs in his mind. His\nvoice, coming from behind one of the ladies, expressed this thought:\n\n\"We must have money, a great deal of money.\"\n\n\"That is your business,\" answered the prince.\n\nBut already the park gates were opening to the formidable motor-car.\n\nThe dinner was sumptuous. They toasted the Dragon's crest. Everybody\nknows that a closed goblet is a sign of sovereignty; so Prince\nCrucho and Princess Gudrune, his wife, drank out of goblets that were\ncovered-over like ciboriums. The prince had his filled several times\nwith the wines of Penguinia, both white and red.\n\nCrucho had received a truly princely education, and he excelled in\nmotoring, but was not ignorant of history either. He was said to be well\nversed in the antiquities and famous deeds of his family; and, indeed,\nhe gave a notable proof of his knowledge in this respect. As they were\nspeaking of the various remarkable peculiarities that had been noticed\nin famous women.\n\n\"It is perfectly true,\" said he, \"that Queen Crucha, whose name I bear,\nhad the mark of a little monkey's head upon her body.\"\n\nDuring the evening Agaric had a decisive interview with three of the\nprince's oldest councillors. It was decided to ask for funds from\nCrucho's father-in-law, as he was anxious to have a king for son-in-law,\nfrom several Jewish ladies, who were impatient to become ennobled, and,\nfinally, from the Prince Regent of the Porpoises, who had promised his\naid to the Draconides, thinking that by Crucho's restoration he would\nweaken the Penguins, the hereditary enemies of his people. The three\nold councillors divided among themselves the three chief offices of the\nCourt, those of Chamberlain, Seneschal, and High Steward, and authorised\nthe monk to distribute the other places to the prince's best advantage.\n\n\"Devotion has to be rewarded,\" said the three old councillors.\n\n\"And treachery also,\" said Agaric.\n\n\"It is but too true,\" replied one of them, the Marquis of Sevenwounds,\nwho had experience of revolutions.\n\nThere was dancing, and after the ball Princess Gudrune tore up her green\nrobe to make cockades. With her own hands she sewed a piece of it on the\nmonk's breast, upon which he shed tears of sensibility and gratitude.\n\nM. de Plume, the prince's equerry, set out the same evening to look for\na green horse.\n\n\n\n\nIII. THE CABAL\n\nAfter his return to the capital of Penguinia, the Reverend Father\nAgaric disclosed his projects to Prince Adelestan des Boscenos, of whose\nDraconian sentiments he was well aware.\n\nThe prince belonged to the highest nobility. The Torticol des Boscenos\nwent back to Brian the Good, and under the Draconides had held the\nhighest offices in the kingdom. In 1179, Philip Torticol, High Admiral\nof Penguinia, a brave, faithful, and generous, but vindictive man,\ndelivered over the port of La Crique and the Penguin fleet to the\nenemies of the kingdom, because he suspected that Queen Crucha, whose\nlover he was, had been unfaithful to him and loved a stable-boy. It was\nthat great queen who gave to the Boscenos the silver warming-pan which\nthey bear in their arms. As for their motto, it only goes back to the\nsixteenth century. The story of its origin is as follows: One gala\nnight, as he mingled with the crowd of courtiers who were watching the\nfire-works in the king's garden, Duke John des Boscenos approached the\nDuchess of Skull and put his hand under the petticoat of that lady, who\nmade no complaint at the gesture. The king, happening to pass, surprised\nthem and contented himself with saying, \"And thus I find you.\" These\nfour words became the motto of the Boscenos.\n\nPrince Adelestan had not degenerated from his ancestors. He preserved an\nunalterable fidelity for the race of the Draconides and desired nothing\nso much as the restoration of Prince Crucho, an event which was in his\neyes to be the fore-runner of the restoration of his own fortune. He\ntherefore readily entered into the Reverend Father Agaric's plans. He\njoined himself at once to the monk's projects, and hastened to put him\ninto communication with the most loyal Royalists of his acquaintance,\nCount Clena, M. de La Trumelle, Viscount Olive, and M. Bigourd. They\nmet together one night in the Duke of Ampoule's country house, six miles\neastward of Alca, to consider ways and means.\n\nM. de La Trumelle was in favour of legal action.\n\n\"We ought to keep within the law,\" said he in substance. \"We are for\norder. It is by an untiring propaganda that we shall best pursue the\nrealisation of our hopes. We must change the feeling of the country. Our\ncause will conquer because it is just.\"\n\nThe Prince des Boscenos expressed a contrary opinion. He thought that,\nin order to triumph, just causes need force quite as much and even more\nthan unjust causes require it.\n\n\"In the present situation,\" said he tranquilly, \"three methods of action\npresent themselves: to hire the butcher boys, to corrupt the ministers,\nand to kidnap President Formose.\"\n\n\"It would be a mistake to kidnap Formose,\" objected M. de La Trumelle.\n\"The President is on our side.\"\n\nThe attitude and sentiments of the President of the Republic are\nexplained by the fact that one Dracophil proposed to seize Formose\nwhile another Dracophil regarded him as a friend. Formose showed himself\nfavourable to the Royalists, whose habits he admired and imitated. If\nhe smiled at the mention of the Dragon's crest it was at the thought\nof putting it on his own head. He was envious of sovereign power, not\nbecause he felt himself capable of exercising it, but because he loved\nto appear so. According to the expression of a Penguin chronicler, \"he\nwas a goose.\"\n\nPrince des Boscenos maintained his proposal to march against Formose's\npalace and the House of Parliament.\n\nCount Clena was even still more energetic.\n\n\"Let us begin,\" said he, \"by slaughtering, disembowelling, and braining\nthe Republicans and all partisans of the government. Afterwards we shall\nsee what more need be done.\"\n\nM. de La Trumelle was a moderate, and moderates are always moderately\nopposed to violence. He recognised that Count Clena's policy was\ninspired by a noble feeling and that it was high-minded, but he timidly\nobjected that perhaps it was not conformable to principle, and that it\npresented certain dangers. At last he consented to discuss it.\n\n\"I propose,\" added he, \"to draw up an appeal to the people. Let us show\nwho we are. For my own part I can assure you that I shall not hide my\nflag in my pocket.\"\n\nM. Bigourd began to speak.\n\n\"Gentlemen, the Penguins are dissatisfied with the new order because it\nexists, and it is natural for men to complain of their condition. But at\nthe same time the Penguins are afraid to change their government because\nnew things alarm them. They have not known the Dragon's crest and,\nalthough they sometimes say that they regret it, we must not believe\nthem. It is easy to see that they speak in this way either without\nthought or because they are in an ill-temper. Let us not have any\nillusions about their feelings towards ourselves. They do not like us.\nThey hate the aristocracy both from a base envy and from a generous love\nof equality. And these two united feelings are very strong in a people.\nPublic opinion is not against us, because it knows nothing about us. But\nwhen it knows what we want it will not follow us. If we let it be seen\nthat we wish to destroy democratic government and restore the Dragon's\ncrest, who will be our partisans? Only the butcher-boys and the little\nshopkeepers of Alca. And could we even count on them to the end?\nThey are dissatisfied, but at the bottom of their hearts they are\nRepublicans. They are more anxious to sell their cursed wares than to\nsee Crucho again. If we act openly we shall only cause alarm.\n\n\"To make people sympathise with us and follow us we must make them\nbelieve that we want, not to overthrow the Republic, but, on the\ncontrary, to restore it, to cleanse, to purify, to embellish, to adorn,\nto beautify, and to ornament it, to render it, in a word, glorious and\nattractive. Therefore, we ought not to act openly ourselves. It is known\nthat we are not favourable to the present order. We must have recourse\nto a friend of the Republic, and, if we are to do what is best, to a\ndefender of this government. We have plenty to choose from. It would\nbe well to prefer the most popular and, if I dare say so, the most\nrepublican of them. We shall win him over to us by flattery, by\npresents, and above all by promises. Promises cost less than presents,\nand are worth more. No one gives as much as he who gives hopes. It is\nnot necessary for the man we choose to be of brilliant intellect. I\nwould even prefer him to be of no great ability. Stupid people show an\ninimitable grace in roguery. Be guided by me, gentlemen, and overthrow\nthe Republic by the agency of a Republican. Let us be prudent. But\nprudence does not exclude energy. If you need me you will find me at\nyour disposal.\"\n\nThis speech made a great impression upon those who heard it. The mind\nof the pious Agaric was particularly impressed. But each of them was\nanxious to appoint himself to a position of honour and profit. A secret\ngovernment was organised of which all those present were elected active\nmembers. The Duke of Ampoule, who was the great financier of the\nparty, was chosen treasurer and charged with organising funds for the\npropaganda.\n\nThe meeting was on the point of coming to an end when a rough voice was\nheard singing an old air:\n\n     Boscenos est un gros cochon;\n     On en va faire des andouilles\n     Des saucisses et du jambon\n     Pour le reveillon des pauv' bougres.\n\nIt had, for two hundred years, been a well-known song in the slums of\nAlca. Prince Boscenos did not like to hear it. He went down into the\nstreet, and, perceiving that the singer was a workman who was placing\nsome slates on the roof of a church, he politely asked him to sing\nsomething else.\n\n\"I will sing what I like,\" answered the man.\n\n\"My friend, to please me. . . .\"\n\n\"I don't want to please you.\"\n\nPrince Boscenos was as a rule good-tempered, but he was easily angered\nand a man of great strength.\n\n\"Fellow, come down or I will go up to you,\" cried he, in a terrible\nvoice.\n\nAs the workman, astride on his coping, showed no sign of budging, the\nprince climbed quickly up the staircase of the tower and attacked the\nsinger. He gave him a blow that broke his jaw-bone and sent him rolling\ninto a water-spout. At that moment seven or eight carpenters, who were\nworking on the rafters, heard their companion's cry and looked through\nthe window. Seeing the prince on the coping they climbed along a ladder\nthat was leaning on the slates and reached him just as he was slipping\ninto the tower. They sent him, head foremost, down the one hundred and\nthirty-seven steps of the spiral staircase.\n\n\n\n\nIV. VISCOUNTESS OLIVE\n\nThe Penguins had the finest army in the world. So had the Porpoises. And\nit was the same with the other nations of Europe. The smallest amount of\nthought will prevent any surprise at this. For all armies are the finest\nin the world. The second finest army, if one could exist, would be in\na notoriously inferior position; it would be certain to be beaten. It\nought to be disbanded at once. Therefore, all armies are the finest in\nthe world. In France the illustrious Colonel Marchand understood\nthis when, before the passage of the Yalou, being questioned by some\njournalists about the Russo-Japanese war, he did not hesitate to\ndescribe the Russian army as the finest in the world, and also the\nJapanese. And it should be noticed that even after suffering the most\nterrible reverses an army does not fall from its position of being\nthe finest in the world. For if nations ascribe their victories to the\nability of their generals and the courage of their soldiers, they always\nattribute their defeats to an inexplicable fatality. On the other hand,\nnavies are classed according to the number of their ships. There is a\nfirst, a second, a third, and so on. So that there exists no doubt as to\nthe result of naval wars.\n\nThe Penguins had the finest army and the second navy in the world.\nThis navy was commanded by the famous Chatillon, who bore the title\nof Emiralbahr, and by abbreviation Emiral. It is the same word which,\nunfortunately in a corrupt form, is used to-day among several European\nnations to designate the highest grade in the naval service. But as\nthere was but one Emiral among the Penguins, a singular prestige, if I\ndare say so, was attached to that rank.\n\nThe Emiral did not belong to the nobility. A child of the people, he was\nloved by the people. They were flattered to see a man who sprang from\ntheir own ranks holding a position of honour. Chatillon was good-looking\nand fortune favoured him. He was not over-addicted to thought. No event\never disturbed his serene outlook.\n\nThe Reverend Father Agaric, surrendering to M. Bigourd's reasons and\nrecognising that the existing government could only be destroyed by one\nof its defenders, cast his eyes upon Emiral Chatillon. He asked a large\nsum of money from his friend, the Reverend Father Cornemuse, which the\nlatter handed him with a sigh. And with this sum he hired six hundred\nbutcher boys of Alca to run behind Chatillon's horse and shout, \"Hurrah\nfor the Emiral!\" Henceforth Chatillon could not take a single step\nwithout being cheered.\n\nViscountess Olive asked him for a private interview. He received her at\nthe Admiralty* in a room decorated with anchors, shells, and grenades.\n\n     * Or better, Emiralty.\n\nShe was discreetly dressed in greyish blue. A hat trimmed with roses\ncovered her pretty, fair hair, Behind her veil her eyes shone like\nsapphires. Although she came of Jewish origin there was no more\nfashionable woman in the whole nobility. She was tall and well shaped;\nher form was that of the year, her figure that of the season.\n\n\"Emiral,\" said she, in a delightful voice, \"I cannot conceal my emotion\nfrom you. . . . It is very natural . . . before a hero.\"\n\n\"You are too kind. But tell me, Viscountess, what brings me the honour\nof your visit.\"\n\n\"For a long time I have been anxious to see you, to speak to you. . . .\nSo I very willingly undertook to convey a message to you.\"\n\n\"Please take a seat.\"\n\n\"How still it is here.\"\n\n\"Yes, it is quiet enough.\"\n\n\"You can hear the birds singing.\"\n\n\"Sit down, then, dear lady.\"\n\nAnd he drew up an arm-chair for her.\n\nShe took a seat with her back to the light.\n\n\"Emiral, I came to bring you a very important message, a message. . .\"\n\n\"Explain.\"\n\n\"Emiral, have you ever seen Prince Crucho?\"\n\n\"Never.\"\n\nShe sighed.\n\n\"It is a great pity. He would be so delighted to see you! He esteems and\nappreciates you. He has your portrait on his desk beside his mother's.\nWhat a pity it is he is not better known! He is a charming prince and so\ngrateful for what is done for him! He will be a great king. For he will\nbe king without doubt. He will come back and sooner than people think.\n. . . What I have to tell you, the message with which I am entrusted,\nrefers precisely to. . .\"\n\nThe Emiral stood up.\n\n\"Not a word more, dear lady. I have the esteem, the confidence of the\nRepublic. I will not betray it. And why should I betray it? I am loaded\nhonours and dignities.\"\n\n\"Allow me to tell you, my dear Emiral, that your honours and dignities\nare far from equalling what you deserve. If your services were\nproperly rewarded, you would be Emiralissimo and Generalissimo,\nCommander-in-chief of the troops both on land and sea. The Republic is\nvery ungrateful to you.\"\n\n\"All governments are more or less ungrateful.\"\n\n\"Yes, but the Republicans are jealous of you. That class of person\nis always afraid of his superiors. They cannot endure the Services.\nEverything that has to do with the navy and the army is odious to them.\nThey are afraid of you.\"\n\n\"That is possible.\"\n\n\"They are wretches; they are ruining the country. Don't you wish to save\nPenguinia?\n\n\"In what way?\"\n\n\"By sweeping away all the rascals of the Republic, all the Republicans.\"\n\n\"What a proposal to make to me, dear lady!\"\n\n\"It is what will certainly be done, if not by you, then by some one\nelse. The Generalissimo, to mention him alone, is ready to throw all\nthe ministers, deputies, and senators into the sea, and to recall Prince\nCrucho.\"\n\n\"Oh, the rascal, the scoundrel,\" exclaimed the Emiral.\n\n\"Do to him what he would do to you. The prince will know how to\nrecognise your services, He will give you the Constable's sword and a\nmagnificent grant. I am commissioned, in the mean time, to hand you a\npledge of his royal friendship.\"\n\nAs she said these words she drew a green cockade from her bosom.\n\n\"What is that?\" asked the Emiral.\n\n\"It is his colours which Crucho sends you.\"\n\n\"Be good enough to take them back.\"\n\n\"So that they may be offered to the Generalissimo who will accept them!\n. . . No, Emiral, let me place them on your glorious breast.\"\n\nChatillon gently repelled the lady. But for some minutes he thought her\nextremely pretty, and he felt this impression still more when two bare\narms and the rosy palms of two delicate hands touched him lightly. He\nyielded almost immediately. Olive was slow in fastening the ribbon. Then\nwhen it was done she made a low courtesy and saluted Chatillon with the\ntitle of Constable.\n\n\"I have been ambitious like my comrades,\" answered the sailor, \"I don't\nhide it, and perhaps I am so still; but u on my word of honour, when I\nlook at you, the only, desire I feel is for a cottage and a heart.\"\n\nShe turned upon him the charming sapphire glances that flashed from\nunder her eyelids.\n\n\"That is to be had also . . . what are you doing, Emiral?\"\n\n\"I am looking for the heart.\"\n\nWhen she left the Admiralty, the Viscountess went immediately to the\nReverend Father Agaric to give an account of her visit.\n\n\"You must go to him again, dear lady,\" said that austere monk.\n\n\n\n\nV. THE PRINCE DES BOSCENOS\n\nMorning and evening the newspapers that had been bought by the\nDracophils proclaimed Chatillon's praises and hurled shame and\nopprobrium upon the Ministers of the Republic. Chatillon's portrait was\nsold through the streets of Alca. Those young descendants of Remus who\ncarry plaster figures on their heads, offered busts of Chatillon for\nsale upon the bridges.\n\nEvery evening Chatillon rode upon his white horse round the Queen's\nMeadow, a place frequented by the people of fashion. The Dracophils\nposted along the Emiral's route a crowd of needy Penguins who kept\nshouting: \"It is Chatillon we want.\" The middle classes of Alca\nconceived a profound admiration for the Emiral. Shopwomen murmured:\n\"He is good-looking.\" Women of fashion slackened the speed of their\nmotor-cars and kissed hands to him as they passed, amidst the hurrahs of\nan enthusiastic populace.\n\nOne day, as he went into a tobacco shop, two Penguins who were putting\nletters in the box recognized Chatillon and cried at the top of their\nvoices: \"Hurrah for the Emiral! Down with the Republicans.\" All those\nwho were passing stopped in front of the shop. Chatillon lighted his\ncigar before the eyes of a dense crowd of frenzied citizens who waved\ntheir hats and cheered. The crowd kept increasing, and the whole\ntown, singing and marching behind its hero, went back with him to the\nAdmiralty.\n\nThe Emiral had an old comrade in arms, Under-Emiral Vulcanmould, who had\nserved with great distinction, a man as true as gold and as loyal as his\nsword. Vulcanmould plumed himself on his thoroughgoing independence and\nhe went among the partisans of Crucho and the Minister of the Republic\ntelling both parties what he thought of them. M. Bigourd maliciously\ndeclared that he told each party what the other party thought of it.\nIn truth he had on several occasions been guilty of regrettable\nindiscretions, which were overlooked as being the freedoms of a soldier\nwho knew nothing of intrigue. Every morning he went to see Chatillon,\nwhom he treated with the cordial roughness of a brother in arms.\n\n\"Well, old buffer, so you are popular,\" said he to him. \"Your phiz is\nsold on the heads of pipes and on liqueur bottles and every drunkard in\nAlca spits out your name as he rolls in the gutter. . . . Chatillon, the\nhero of the Penguins! Chatillon, defender of the Penguin glory! . . .\nWho would have said it? Who would have thought it?\"\n\nAnd he laughed with his harsh laugh. Then changing his tone: \"But,\njoking aside, are you not a bit surprised at what is happening to you?\"\n\n\"No, indeed,\" answered Chatillon.\n\nAnd out went the honest Vulcanmould, banging the door behind him.\n\nIn the mean time Chatillon had taken a little flat at number 18\nJohannes-Talpa Street, so that he might receive Viscountess Olive. They\nmet there every day. He was desperately in love with her. During his\nmartial and neptunian life he had loved crowds of women, red, black,\nyellow, and white, and some of them had been very beautiful. But before\nhe met the Viscountess he did not know what a woman really was. When the\nViscountess Olive called him her darling, her dear darling, he felt in\nheaven and it seemed to him that the stars shone in her hair.\n\nShe would come a little late, and, as she put her bag on the table, she\nwould ask pensively:\n\n\"Let me sit on your knee.\"\n\nAnd then she would talk of subjects suggested by the pious Agaric,\ninterrupting the conversation with sighs and kisses. She would ask him\nto dismiss such and such an officer, to give a command to another,\nto send the squadron here or there. And at the right moment she would\nexclaim:\n\n\"How young you are, my dear!\"\n\nAnd he did whatever she wished, for he was simple, he was anxious to\nwear the Constable's sword, and to receive a large grant; he did not\ndislike playing a double part, he had a vague idea of saving Penguinia,\nand he was in love.\n\nThis delightful woman induced him to remove the troops that were at La\nCirque, the port where Crucho was to land. By this means it was made\ncertain that there would be no obstacle to prevent the prince from\nentering Penguinia.\n\nThe pious Agaric organised public meetings so as to keep up the\nagitation. The Dracophils held one or two every day in some of the\nthirty-six districts of Alca, and preferably in the poorer quarters.\nThey desired to win over the poor, for they are the most numerous.\nOn the fourth of May a particularly fine meeting was held in an old\ncattle-market, situated in the centre of a populous suburb filled with\nhousewives sitting on the doorsteps and children playing in the gutters.\nThere were present about two thousand people, in the opinion of\nthe Republicans, and six thousand according to the reckoning of the\nDracophils. In the audience was to be seen the flower of Penguin\nsociety, including Prince and Princess des Boscenos, Count Clena, M. de\nLa Trumelle, M. Bigourd, and several rich Jewish ladies.\n\nThe Generalissimo of the national army had come in uniform. He was\ncheered.\n\nThe committee had been carefully formed. A man of the people, a workman,\nbut a man of sound principles, M. Rauchin, the secretary of the yellow\nsyndicate, was asked to preside, supported by Count Clena and M.\nMichaud, a butcher.\n\nThe government which Penguinia had freely given itself was called by\nsuch names as cesspool and drain in several eloquent speeches. But\nPresident Formose was spared and no mention was made of Crucho or the\npriests.\n\nThe meeting was not unanimous. A defender of the modern State and of the\nRepublic, a manual labourer, stood up.\n\n\"Gentlemen,\" said M. Rauchin, the chairman, \"we have told you that this\nmeeting would not be unanimous. We are not like our opponents, we are\nhonest men. I allow our opponent to speak. Heaven knows what you are\ngoing to hear. Gentlemen, I beg of you to restrain as long as you can\nthe expression of your contempt, your disgust, and your indignation.\"\n\n\"Gentlemen,\" said the opponent. . . .\n\nImmediately he was knocked down, trampled beneath the feet of the\nindignant crowd, and his unrecognisable remains thrown out of the hall.\n\nThe tumult was still resounding when Count Clena ascended the tribune.\nCheers took the place of groans and when silence was restored the orator\nuttered these words:\n\n\"Comrades, we are going to see whether you have blood in your veins.\nWhat we have got to do is to slaughter, disembowel, and brain all the\nRepublicans.\"\n\nThis speech let loose such a thunder of applause that the old shed\nrocked with it, and a cloud of acrid and thick dust fell from its filthy\nwalls and worm-eaten beams and enveloped the audience.\n\nA resolution was carried vilifying the government and acclaiming\nChatillon. And the audience departed singing the hymn of the liberator:\n\"It is Chatillon we want.\"\n\nThe only way out of the old market was through a muddy alley shut in by\nomnibus stables and coal sheds. There was no moon and a cold drizzle was\ncoming down. The police, who were assembled in great numbers, blocked\nthe alley and compelled the Dracophils to disperse in little groups.\nThese were the instructions they had received from their chief, who was\nanxious to check the enthusiasm of the excited crowd.\n\nThe Dracophils who were detained in the alley kept marking time and\nsinging, \"It is Chatillon we want.\" Soon, becoming impatient of the\ndelay, the cause of which they did not know, they began to push those in\nfront of them. This movement, propagated along the alley, threw those in\nfront against the broad chests of the police. The latter had no hatred\nfor the Dracophils. In the bottom of their hearts they liked Chatillon.\nBut it is natural to resist aggression and strong men are inclined to\nmake use of their strength. For these reasons the police kicked the\nDracophils with their hob-nailed boots. As a result there were sudden\nrushes backwards and forwards. Threats and cries mingled with the songs.\n\n\"Murder! Murder! . . . It is Chatillon we want! Murder! Murder!\"\n\nAnd in the gloomy alley the more prudent kept saying, \"Don't push.\"\nAmong these latter, in the darkness, his lofty figure rising above the\nmoving crowd, his broad shoulders and robust body noticeable among\nthe trampled limbs and crushed sides of the rest, stood the Prince\ndes Boscenos, calm, immovable, and placid. Serenely and indulgently he\nwaited. In the mean time, as the exit was opened at regular intervals\nbetween the ranks of the police, the pressure of elbows against the\nchests of those around the prince diminished and people began to breathe\nagain.\n\n\"You see we shall soon be able to go out,\" said that kindly giant, with\na pleasant smile. \"Time and patience . . .\"\n\nHe took a cigar from his case, raised it to his lips and struck a match.\nSuddenly, in the light of the match, he saw Princess Anne, his wife,\nclasped in Count Clena's arms. At this sight he rushed towards them,\nstriking both them and those around with his cane. He was disarmed,\nthough not without difficulty, but he could not be separated from his\nopponent. And whilst the fainting princess was lifted from arm to arm\nto her carriage over the excited and curious crowd, the two men still\nfought furiously. Prince des Boscenos lost his hat, his eye-glass,\nhis cigar, his necktie, and his portfolio full of private letters and\npolitical correspondence; he even lost the miraculous medals that he\nhad received from the good Father Cornemuse. But he gave his opponent\nso terrible a kick in the stomach that the unfortunate Count was knocked\nthrough an iron grating and went, head foremost, through a glass door\nand into a coal-shed.\n\nAttracted by the struggle and the cries of those around, the police\nrushed towards the prince, who furiously resisted them. He stretched\nthree of them gasping at his feet and put seven others to flight,\nwith, respectively, a broken jaw, a split lip, a nose pouring blood, a\nfractured skull, a torn ear, a dislocated collar-bone, and broken ribs.\nHe fell, however, and was dragged bleeding and disfigured, with his\nclothes in rags, to the nearest police-station, where, jumping about and\nbellowing, he spent the night.\n\nAt daybreak groups of demonstrators went about the town singing, \"It is\nChatillon we want,\" and breaking the windows of the houses in which the\nMinisters of the Republic lived.\n\n\n\n\nVI. THE EMIRAL'S FALL\n\nThat night marked the culmination of the Dracophil movement. The\nRoyalists had no longer any doubt of its triumph. Their chiefs sent\ncongratulations to Prince Crucho by wireless telegraphy. Their ladies\nembroidered scarves and slippers for him. M. de Plume had found the\ngreen horse.\n\nThe pious Agaric shared the common hope. But he still worked to\nwin partisans for the Pretender. They ought, he said, to lay their\nfoundations upon the bed-rock.\n\nWith this design he had an interview with three Trade Union workmen.\n\nIn these times the artisans no longer lived, as in the days of the\nDraconides, under the government of corporations. They were free, but\nthey had no assured pay. After having remained isolated from each other\nfor a long time, without help and without support, they had formed\nthemselves into unions. The coffers of the unions were empty, as it was\nnot the habit of the unionists to pay their subscriptions. There were\nunions numbering thirty thousand members, others with a thousand,\nfive hundred, two hundred, and so forth. Several numbered two or three\nmembers only, or even a few less. But as the lists of adherents were\nnot published, it was not easy to distinguish the great unions from the\nsmall ones.\n\nAfter some dark and indirect steps the pious Agaric was put into\ncommunication in a room in the Moulin de la Galette, with comrades\nDagobert, Tronc, and Balafille, the secretaries of three unions of which\nthe first numbered fourteen members, the second twenty-four, and the\nthird only one. Agaric showed extreme cleverness at this interview.\n\n\"Gentlemen,\" said he, \"you and I have not, in most respects, the same\npolitical and social views, but there are points in which we may come\nto an understanding. We have a common enemy. The government exploits you\nand despises us. Help us to overthrow it; we will supply you with\nthe means so far as we are able, and you can in addition count on our\ngratitude.\"\n\n\"Fork out the tin,\" said Dagobert.\n\nThe Reverend Father placed on the table a bag which the distiller of\nConils had given him with tears in his eyes.\n\n\"Done!\" said the three companions.\n\nThus was the solemn compact sealed.\n\nAs soon as the monk had departed, carrying with him the joy of having\nwon over the masses to his cause, Dagobert, Tronc, and Balafille\nwhistled to their wives, Amelia, Queenie, and Matilda, who were waiting\nin the street for the signal, and all six holding each other's hands,\ndanced around the bag, singing:\n\n     J'ai du bon pognon,\n     Tu n'l'auras pas Chatillon!\n     Hou! Hou! la calotte!\n\nAnd they ordered a salad-bowl full of warm wine.\n\nIn the evening all six went through the street from stall to stall\nsinging their new song. The song became popular, for the detectives\nreported that every day showed an increase of the number of workpeople\nwho sang through the slums:\n\n     J'ai du bon pognon;\n     Tu n'l'auras pas Chatillon!\n     Hou! Hou! la calotte!\n\nThe Dracophil agitation made no progress in the provinces. The pious\nAgaric sought to find the cause of this, but was unable to discover it\nuntil old Cornemuse revealed it to him.\n\n\"I have proofs,\" sighed the monk of Conils, \"that the Duke of Ampoule,\nthe treasurer of the Dracophils, has brought property in Porpoisia with\nthe funds that he received for the propaganda.\"\n\nThe party wanted money. Prince des Boscenos had lost his portfolio in a\nbrawl and he was reduced to painful expedients which were repugnant to\nhis impetuous character. The Viscountess Olive was expensive. Cornemuse\nadvised that the monthly allowance of that lady should be diminished.\n\n\"She is very useful to us,\" objected the pious Agaric.\n\n\"Undoubtedly,\" answered Cornemuse, \"but she does us an injury by ruining\nus.\"\n\nA schism divided the Dracophils. Misunderstandings reigned in their\ncouncils. Some wished that in accordance with the policy of M. Bigourd\nand the pious Agaric, they should carry on the design of reforming the\nRepublic. Others, wearied by their long constraint, had resolved to\nproclaim the Dragon's crest and swore to conquer beneath that sign.\n\nThe latter urged the advantage of a clear situation and the\nimpossibility of making a pretence much longer, and in truth, the public\nbegan to see whither the agitation was tending and that the Emiral's\npartisans wanted to destroy the very foundations of the Republic.\n\nA report was spread that the prince was to land at La Cirque and make\nhis entry into Alca on a green horse.\n\nThese rumours excited the fanatical monks, delighted the poor nobles,\nsatisfied the rich Jewish ladies, and put hope in the hearts of the\nsmall traders. But very few of them were inclined to purchase these\nbenefits at the price of a social catastrophe and the overthrow of the\npublic credit; and there were fewer still who would have risked their\nmoney, their peace, their liberty, or a single hour from their pleasures\nin the business. On the other hand, the workmen held themselves ready,\nas ever, to give a day's work to the Republic, and a strong resistance\nwas being formed in the suburbs.\n\n\"The people are with us,\" the pious Agaric used to say.\n\nHowever, men, women, and children, when leaving their factories, used to\nshout with one voice:\n\n     A bas Chatillon!\n     Hou! Hou! la calotte!\n\nAs for the government, it showed the weakness, indecision, flabbiness,\nand heedlessness common to all governments, and from which none has ever\ndeparted without falling into arbitrariness and violence. In three words\nit knew nothing, wanted nothing, and would do nothing. Formose, shut in\nhis presidential palace, remained blind, dumb, deaf, huge, invisible,\nwrapped up in his pride as in an eider-down.\n\nCount Olive advised the Dracophils to make a last appeal for funds and\nto attempt a great stroke while Alca was still in a ferment.\n\nAn executive committee, which he himself had chosen, decided to kidnap\nthe members of the Chamber of Deputies, and considered ways and means.\n\nThe affair was fixed for the twenty-eighth of July. On that day the sun\nrose radiantly over the city. In front of the legislative palace women\npassed to market with their baskets; hawkers cried their peaches, pears,\nand grapes; cab horses with their noses in their bags munched their\nhay. Nobody expected anything, not because the secret had been kept\nbut because it met with nothing but unbelievers. Nobody believed in a\nrevolution, and from this fact we may conclude that nobody desired one.\nAbout two o'clock the deputies began to pass, few and unnoticed, through\nthe side-door of the palace. At three o'clock a few groups of badly\ndressed men had formed. At half past three black masses coming from the\nadjacent streets spread over Revolution Square. This vast expanse was\nsoon covered by an ocean of soft hats, and the crowd of demonstrators,\ncontinually increased by sight-seers, having crossed the bridge, struck\nits dark wave against the walls of the legislative enclosure. Cries,\nmurmurs, and songs went up to the impassive sky. \"It is Chatillon we\nwant!\" \"Down with the Deputies!\" \"Down with the Republicans!\" \"Death\nto the Republicans!\" The devoted band of Dracophils, led by Prince des\nBoscenos, struck up the august canticle:\n\n     Vive Crucho,\n     Vaillant et sage,\n     Plein de courage\n     Des le berceau!\n\nBehind the wall silence alone replied.\n\nThis silence and the absence of guards encouraged and at the same time\nfrightened the crowd. Suddenly a formidable voice cried out:\n\n\"Attack!\"\n\nAnd Prince des Boscenos was seen raising his gigantic form to the top\nof the wall, which was covered with barbs and iron spikes. Behind him\nrushed his companions, and the people followed. Some hammered against\nthe wall to make holes in it; others endeavoured to tear down the spikes\nand to pull out the barbs. These defences had given way in places and\nsome of the invaders had stripped the wall and were sitting astride on\nthe top. Prince des Boscenos was waving an immense green flag. Suddenly\nthe crowd wavered and from it came a long cry of terror. The police\nand the Republican carabineers issuing out of all the entrances of the\npalace formed themselves into a column beneath the wall and in a moment\nit was cleared of its besiegers. After a long moment of suspense the\nnoise of arms was heard, and the police charged the crowd with fixed\nbayonets. An instant afterwards and on the deserted square strewn with\nhats and walking-sticks there reigned a sinister silence. Twice again\nthe Dracophils attempted to form, twice they were repulsed. The rising\nwas conquered. But Prince des Boscenos, standing on the wall of the\nhostile palace, his flag in his hand, still repelled the attack of a\nwhole brigade. He knocked down all who approached him. At last he, too,\nwas thrown down, and fell on an iron spike, to which he remained hooked,\nstill clasping the standard of the Draconides.\n\nOn the following day the Ministers of the Republic and the Members of\nParliament determined to take energetic measures. In vain, this time,\ndid President Formose attempt to evade his responsibilities. The\ngovernment discussed the question of depriving Chatillon of his rank and\ndignities and of indicting him before the High Court as a conspirator,\nan enemy of the public good, a traitor, etc.\n\nAt this news the Emiral's old companions in arms, who the very evening\nbefore had beset him with their adulations, made no effort to conceal\ntheir joy. But Chatillon remained popular with the middle classes of\nAlca and one still heard the hymn of the liberator sounding in the\nstreets, \"It is Chatillon we want.\"\n\nThe Ministers were embarrassed. They intended to indict Chatillon before\nthe High Court. But they knew nothing; they remained in that total\nignorance reserved for those who govern men. They were incapable of\nadvancing any grave charges against Chatillon. They could supply\nthe prosecution with nothing but the ridiculous lies of their spies.\nChatillon's share in the plot and his relations with Prince Crucho\nremained the secret of the thirty thousand Dracophils. The Ministers\nand the Deputies had suspicions and even certainties, but they had no\nproofs. The Public Prosecutor said to the Minister of justice: \"Very\nlittle is needed for a political prosecution! but I have nothing at all\nand that is not enough.\" The affair made no progress. The enemies of the\nRepublic were triumphant.\n\nOn the eighteenth of September the news ran in Alca that Chatillon had\ntaken flight. Everywhere there was surprise and astonishment. People\ndoubted, for they could not understand.\n\nThis is what had happened: One day as the brave Under-Emiral Vulcanmould\nhappened, as if by chance, to go into the office of M. Barbotan, the\nMinister of Foreign Affairs, he remarked with his usual frankness:\n\n\"M. Barbotan, your colleagues do not seem to me to be up to much; it is\nevident that they have never commanded a ship. That fool Chatillon gives\nthem a deuced bad fit of the shivers.\"\n\nThe Minister, in sign of denial, waved his paper-knife in the air above\nhis desk.\n\n\"Don't deny it,\" answered Vulcanmould. \"You don't know how to get rid of\nChatillon. You do not dare to indict him before the High Court because\nyou are not sure of being able to bring forward a strong enough charge.\nBigourd will defend him, and Bigourd is a clever advocate. . . . You are\nright, M. Barbotan, you are right. It would be a dangerous trial.\"\n\n\"Ah! my friend,\" said the Minister, in a careless tone, \"if you knew\nhow satisfied we are. . . . I receive the most reassuring news from\nmy prefects. The good sense of the Penguins will do justice to the\nintrigues of this mutinous soldier. Can you suppose for a moment that\na great people, an intelligent, laborious people, devoted to liberal\ninstitutions which. . .\"\n\nVulcanmould interrupted with a great sigh:\n\n\"Ah! If I had time to do it I would relieve you of your difficulty. I\nwould juggle away my Chatillon like a nutmeg out of a thimble. I would\nfillip him off to Porpoisia.\"\n\nThe Minister paid close attention.\n\n\"It would not take long,\" continued the sailor. \"I would rid you in a\ntrice of the creature. . . . But just now I have other fish to fry. . . .\nI am in a bad hole. I must find a pretty big sum. But, deuce take it,\nhonour before everything.\"\n\nThe Minister and the Under-Emiral looked at each other for a moment in\nsilence. Then Barbotan said with authority:\n\n\"Under-Emiral Vulcanmould, get rid of this seditious soldier. You will\nrender a great service to Penguinia, and the Minister of Home Affairs\nwill see that your gambling debts are paid.\"\n\nThe same evening Vulcanmould called on Chatillon and looked at him for\nsome time with an expression of grief and mystery.\n\n\"My do you look like that?\" asked the Emiral in an uneasy tone.\n\nVulcanmould said to him sadly:\n\n\"Old brother in arms, all is discovered. For the past half-hour the\ngovernment knows everything.\"\n\nAt these words Chatillon sank down overwhelmed.\n\nVulcanmould continued:\n\n\"You may be arrested any moment. I advise you to make off.\"\n\nAnd drawing out his watch:\n\n\"Not a minute to lose.\"\n\n\"Have I time to call on the Viscountess Olive?\"\n\n\"It would be mad,\" said Vulcanmould, handing him a passport and a pair\nof blue spectacles, and telling him to have courage.\n\n\"I will,\" said Chatillon.\n\n\"Good-bye! old chum.\"\n\n\"Good-bye and thanks! You have saved my life.\"\n\n\"That is the least I could do.\"\n\nA quarter of an hour later the brave Emiral had left the city of Alca.\n\nHe embarked at night on an old cutter at La Cirque and set sail\nfor Porpoisia. But eight miles from the coast he was captured by a\ndespatch-boat which was sailing without lights and which was under, the\nflag of the Queen of the Black Islands. That Queen had for a long time\nnourished a fatal passion for Chatillon.\n\n\n\n\nVII. CONCLUSION\n\nNunc est bibendum. Delivered from its fears and pleased at having\nescaped from so great a danger, the government resolved to celebrate\nthe anniversary of the Penguin regeneration and the establishment of the\nRepublic by holding a general holiday.\n\nPresident Formose, the Ministers, and the members of the Chamber and of\nthe Senate were present at the ceremony.\n\nThe Generalissimo of the Penguin army was present in uniform. He was\ncheered.\n\nPreceded by the black flag of misery and the red flag of revolt,\ndeputations of workmen walked in the procession, their aspect one of\ngrim protection.\n\nPresident, Ministers, Deputies, officials, heads of the magistracy and\nof the army, each, in their own names and in the name of the sovereign\npeople, renewed the ancient oath to live in freedom or to die. It was\nan alternative upon which they were resolutely determined. But they\npreferred to live in freedom. There were games, speeches, and songs.\n\nAfter the departure of the representatives of the State the crowd of\ncitizens separated slowly and peaceably, shouting out, \"Hurrah for the\nRepublic!\" \"Hurrah for liberty!\" \"Down with the shaven pates!\"\n\nThe newspapers mentioned only one regrettable incident that happened on\nthat wonderful day. Prince des Boscenos was quietly smoking a cigar\nin the Queen's Meadow when the State procession passed by. The prince\napproached the Minister's carriage and said in a loud voice: \"Death to\nthe Republicans!\" He was immediately apprehended by the police, to whom\nhe offered a most desperate resistance. He knocked them down in crowds,\nbut he was conquered by numbers, and, bruised, scratched, swollen, and\nunrecognisable even to the eyes of his wife, he was dragged through the\njoyous streets into an obscure prison.\n\nThe magistrates carried on the case against Chatillon in a peculiar\nstyle. Letters were found at the Admiralty which revealed the complicity\nof the Reverend Father Agaric in the plot. Immediately public opinion\nwas inflamed against the monks, and Parliament voted, one after the\nother, a dozen laws which restrained, diminished, limited, prescribed,\nsuppressed, determined, and curtailed, their rights, immunities,\nexemptions, privileges, and benefits, and created many invalidating\ndisqualifications against them.\n\nThe Reverend Father Agaric steadfastly endured the rigour of the laws\nwhich struck himself personally, as well as the terrible fall of the\nEmiral of which he was the chief cause. Far from yielding to evil\nfortune, he regarded it as but a bird of passage. He was planning new\npolitical designs more audacious than the first.\n\nWhen his projects were sufficiently ripe he went one day to the Wood of\nConils. A thrush sang in a tree and a little hedgehog crossed the\nstony path in front of him with awkward steps. Agaric walked with great\nstrides, muttering fragments of sentences to himself.\n\nWhen he reached the door of the laboratory in which, for so many\nyears, the pious manufacturer bad distilled the golden liqueur of St.\nOrberosia, he found the place deserted and the door shut. Having walked\naround the building he saw in the backyard the venerable Cornemuse, who,\nwith his habit pinned up, was climbing a ladder that leant against the\nwall.\n\n\"Is that you, my dear friend?\" said he to him. \"What are you doing\nthere?\"\n\n\"You can see for yourself,\" answered the monk of Conils in a feeble\nvoice, turning a sorrowful look Upon Agaric. \"I am going into my house.\"\n\nThe red pupils of his eyes no longer imitated the triumph and brilliance\nof the ruby, they flashed mournful and troubled glances. His countenance\nhad lost its happy fulness. His shining head was no longer pleasant\nto the sight; perspiration and inflamed blotches bad altered its\ninestimable perfection.\n\n\"I don't understand,\" said Agaric.\n\n\"It is easy enough to understand. You see the consequences of your plot.\nAlthough a multitude of laws are directed against me I have managed to\nelude the greater number of them. Some, however, have struck me. These\nvindictive men have closed my laboratories and my shops, and confiscated\nmy bottles, my stills, and my retorts. They have put seals on my doors\nand now I am compelled to go in through the window. I am barely able to\nextract in secret and from time to time the juice of a few plants and\nthat with an apparatus which the humblest labourer would despise.\"\n\n\"You suffer from the persecution,\" said Agaric. \"It strikes us all.\"\n\nThe monk of Conils passed his hand over his afflicted brow:\n\n\"I told you so, Brother Agaric; I told you that your enterprise would\nturn against ourselves.\"\n\n\"Our defeat is only momentary,\" replied Agaric eagerly. \"It is due to\npurely accidental causes; it results from mere contingencies. Chatillon\nwas a fool; he has drowned himself in his own ineptitude. Listen to\nme, Brother Cornemuse. We have not a moment to lose. We must free the\nPenguin people, we must deliver them from their tyrants, save them from\nthemselves, restore the Dragon's crest, reestablish the ancient State,\nthe good State, for the honour of religion and the exaltation of the\nCatholic faith. Chatillon was a bad instrument; he broke in our hands.\nLet us take a better instrument to replace him. I have the man who will\ndestroy this impious democracy. He is a civil official; his name is\nGomoru. The Penguins worship him, He has already betrayed his party for\na plate of rice. There's the man we want!\"\n\nAt the beginning of this speech the monk of Conils had climbed into his\nwindow and pulled up the ladder.\n\n\"I foresee,\" answered he, with his nose through the sash, \"that you will\nnot stop until you have us all expelled from this pleasant, agreeable,\nand sweet land of Penguinia. Good night; God keep you!\"\n\nAgaric, standing before the wall, entreated his dearest brother to\nlisten to him for a moment:\n\n\"Understand your own interest better, Cornemuse! Penguinia is ours. What\ndo we need to conquer it? just one effort more . . . one more little\nsacrifice of money and . . .\"\n\nBut without listening further, the monk of Conils drew in his head and\nclosed his window.\n\n\n\n\n\nBOOK VI. MODERN TIMES.\n\nTHE AFFAIR OF THE EIGHTY THOUSAND TRUSSES OF HAY\n\nO Father Zeus, only save thou the sons of the Acheans from the darkness,\nand make clear sky and vouchsafe sight to our eyes, and then, so it be\nbut light, slay us, since such is thy good pleasure. (Iliad, xvii. 645\net seq.)\n\n\n\n\nI. GENERAL GREATAUK, DUKE OF SKULL\n\nA short time after the flight of the Emiral, a middle-class Jew called\nPyrot, desirous of associating with the aristocracy and wishing to serve\nhis country, entered the Penguin army. The Minister of War, who at the\ntime was Greatauk, Duke of Skull, could not endure him. He blamed him\nfor his zeal, his hooked nose, his vanity, his fondness for study, his\nthick lips, and his exemplary conduct. Every time the author of any\nmisdeed was looked for, Greatauk used to say:\n\n\"It must be Pyrot!\"\n\nOne morning General Panther, the Chief of the Staff, informed Greatauk\nof a serious matter. Eighty thousand trusses of hay intended for the\ncavalry had disappeared and not a trace of them was to be found.\n\nGreatauk exclaimed at once:\n\n\"It must be Pyrot who has stolen them!\"\n\nHe remained in thought for some time and said: \"The more I think of\nit the more I am convinced that Pyrot has stolen those eighty thousand\ntrusses of hay. And I know it by this: he stole them in order that he\nmight sell them to our bitter enemies the Porpoises. What an infamous\npiece of treachery!\n\n\"There is no doubt about it,\" answered Panther; \"it only remains to\nprove it.\"\n\nThe same day, as he passed by a cavalry barracks, Prince des Boscenos\nheard the troopers as they were sweeping out the yard, singing:\n\n     Boscenos est un gros cochon;\n     On en va faire des andouilles,\n     Des saucisses et du jambon\n     Pour le riveillon des pauy' bougres.\n\nIt seemed to him contrary to all discipline that soldiers should sing\nthis domestic and revolutionary refrain which on days of riot had been\nuttered by the lips of jeering workmen. On this occasion he deplored the\nmoral degeneration of the army, and thought with a bitter smile that his\nold comrade Greatauk, the head of this degenerate army, basely exposed\nhim to the malice of an unpatriotic government. And he promised himself\nthat he would make an improvement before long.\n\n\"That scoundrel Greatauk,\" said he to himself, \"will, not remain long a\nMinister.\"\n\nPrince des Boscenos was the most irreconcilable of the opponents of\nmodern democracy, free thought, and the government which the Penguins had\nvoluntarily given themselves. He had a vigorous and undisguised hatred\nfor the Jews, and he worked in public and in private, night and day, for\nthe restoration of the line of the Draconides. His ardent royalism was\nstill further excited by the thought of his private affairs, which were\nin a bad way and were hourly growing worse. He had no hope of seeing an\nend to his pecuniary embarrassments until the heir of Draco the Great\nentered the city of Alca.\n\nWhen he returned to his house, the prince took out of his safe a bundle\nof old letters consisting of a private correspondence of the most secret\nnature, which he had obtained from a treacherous secretary. They proved\nthat his old comrade Greatauk, the Duke of Skull, had been guilty of\njobbery regarding the military stores and had received a present of no\ngreat value from a manufacturer called Maloury. The very smallness of\nthis present deprived the Minister who had accepted it of all excuse.\n\nThe prince re-read the letters with a bitter satisfaction, put them\ncarefully back into his safe, and dashed to the Minister of War. He was\na man of resolute character. On being told that the Minister could see\nno one he knocked down the ushers, swept aside the orderlies, trampled\nunder foot the civil and military clerks, burst through the doors, and\nentered the room of the astonished Greatauk.\n\n\"I will not say much,\" said he to him, \"but I will speak to the point.\nYou are a confounded cad. I have asked you to put a flea in the ear of\nGeneral Mouchin, the tool of those Republicans, and you would not do it.\nI have asked you to give a command to General des Clapiers, who works\nfor the Dracophils, and who has obliged me personally, and you would not\ndo it. I have asked you to dismiss General Tandem, the commander of Port\nAlca, who robbed me of fifty louis at cards, and who had me handcuffed\nwhen I was brought before the High Court as Emiral Chatillon's\naccomplice. You would not do it. I asked you for the hay and bran\nstores. You would not give them. I asked you to send me on a secret\nmission to Porpoisia. You refused. And not satisfied with these repeated\nrefusals you have designated me to your Government colleagues as a\ndangerous person, who ought to be watched, and it is owing to you that\nI have been shadowed by the police. You old traitor! I ask nothing more\nfrom you and I have but one word to say to you: Clear out; you have\nbothered us too long. Besides, we will force the vile Republic to\nreplace you by one of our own party. You know that I am a man of my\nword. If in twenty-four hours you have not handed in your resignation I\nwill publish the Maloury dossier in the newspapers.\"\n\nBut Greatauk calmly and serenely replied:\n\n\"Be quiet, you fool. I am just having a Jew transported. I am handing\nover Pyrot to justice as guilty of having stolen eighty thousand trusses\nof hay.\"\n\nPrince Boscenos, whose anger vanished like a dream, smiled.\n\n\"Is that true?\"\n\n\"You will see.\"\n\n\"My congratulations, Greatauk. But as one always needs to take\nprecautions with you I shall immediately publish the good news. People\nwill read this evening about Pyrot's arrest in every newspaper in\nAlca . . . .\"\n\nAnd he went away muttering:\n\n\"That Pyrot! I suspected he would come to a bad end.\"\n\nA moment later General Panther appeared before Greatauk.\n\n\"Sir,\" said he, \"I have just examined the business of the eighty\nthousand trusses of hay. There is no evidence against Pyrot.\"\n\n\"Let it be found,\" answered Greatauk. \"Justice requires it. Have Pyrot\narrested at once.\"\n\n\n\n\nII. PYROT\n\nAll Penguinia heard with horror of Pyrot's crime; at the same time\nthere was a sort of satisfaction that this embezzlement combined with\ntreachery and even bordering on sacrilege, had been committed by a Jew.\nIn order to understand this feeling it is necessary to be acquainted\nwith the state of public opinion regarding the Jews both great and\nsmall. As we have had occasion to say in this history, the universally\ndetested and all powerful financial caste was composed of Christians and\nof Jews. The Jews who formed part of it and on whom the people poured\nall their hatred were the upper-class Jews. They possessed immense\nriches and, it was said, held more than a fifth part of the total\nproperty of Penguinia. Outside this formidable caste there was a\nmultitude of Jews of a mediocre condition, who were not more loved than\nthe others and who were feared much less. In every ordered State, wealth\nis a sacred thing: in democracies it is the only sacred thing. Now\nthe Penguin State was democratic. Three or four financial companies\nexercised a more extensive, and above all, more effective and continuous\npower, than that of the Ministers of the Republic. The latter were\npuppets whom the companies ruled in secret, whom they compelled by\nintimidation or corruption to favour themselves at the expense of the\nState, and whom they ruined by calumnies in the press if they remained\nhonest. In spite of the secrecy of the Exchequer, enough appeared to\nmake the country indignant, but the middle-class Penguins had, from the\ngreatest to the least of them, been brought up to hold money in great\nreverence, and as they all had property, either much or little, they\nwere strongly impressed with the solidarity of capital and understood\nthat a small fortune is not safe unless a big one is protected. For\nthese reasons they conceived a religious respect for the Jews' millions,\nand self-interest being stronger with them than aversion, they were as\nmuch afraid as they were of death to touch a single hair of one of the\nrich Jews whom they detested. Towards the poorer Jews they felt less\nceremonious and when they saw any of them down they trampled on them.\nThat is why the entire nation learnt with thorough satisfaction that the\ntraitor was a Jew. They could take vengeance on all Israel in his person\nwithout any fear of compromising the public credit.\n\nThat Pyrot had stolen the eighty thousand trusses of hay nobody\nhesitated for a moment to believe. No one doubted because the general\nignorance in which everybody was concerning the affair did not allow of\ndoubt, for doubt is a thing that demands motives. People do not doubt\nwithout reasons in the same way that people believe without reasons. The\nthing was not doubted because it was repeated everywhere and, with the\npublic, to repeat is to prove. It was not doubted because people wished\nto believe Pyrot guilty and one believes what one wishes to believe.\nFinally, it was not doubted because the faculty of doubt is rare amongst\nmen; very few minds carry in them its germs and these are not developed\nwithout cultivation. Doubt is singular, exquisite, philosophic, immoral,\ntranscendent, monstrous, full of malignity, injurious to persons and\nto property, contrary to the good order of governments, and to the\nprosperity of empires, fatal to humanity, destructive of the gods, held\nin horror by heaven and earth. The mass of the Penguins were ignorant\nof doubt: it believed in Pyrot's guilt and this conviction immediately\nbecame one of its chief national beliefs and an essential truth in its\npatriotic creed.\n\nPyrot was tried secretly and condemned.\n\nGeneral Panther immediately went to the Minister of War to tell him the\nresult.\n\n\"Luckily,\" said he, \"the judges were certain, for they had no proofs.\"\n\n\"Proofs,\" muttered Greatauk, \"Proofs, what do they prove? There is only\none certain, irrefragable proof--the confession of the guilty person.\nHas Pyrot confessed?\"\n\n\"No, General.\"\n\n\"He will confess, he ought to. Panther, we must induce him; tell him it\nis to his interest. Promise him that, if he confesses, he will obtain\nfavours, a reduction of his sentence, full pardon; promise him that if\nhe confesses his innocence will be admitted, that he will be decorated.\nAppeal to his good feelings. Let him confess from patriotism, for the\nflag, for the sake of order, from respect for the hierarchy, at the\nspecial command of the Minister of War militarily. . . . But tell me,\nPanther, has he not confessed already? There are tacit confessions;\nsilence is a confession.\"\n\n\"But, General, he is not silent; he keeps on squealing like a pig that\nhe is innocent.\"\n\n\"Panther, the confessions of a guilty man sometimes result from the\nvehemence of his denials. To deny desperately is to confess. Pyrot has\nconfessed; we must have witnesses of his confessions, justice requires\nthem.\"\n\nThere was in Western Penguinia a seaport called La Cirque, formed of\nthree small bays and formerly greatly frequented by ships, but now\nsolitary and deserted. Gloomy lagoons stretched along its low coasts\nexhaling a pestilent odour, while fever hovered over its sleepy waters.\nHere, on the borders of the sea, there was built a high square tower,\nlike the old Campanile at Venice, from the side of which, close to the\nsummit hung an open cage which was fastened by a chain to a transverse\nbeam. In the times of the Draconides the Inquisitors of Alca used to\nput heretical clergy into this cage. It had been empty for three hundred\nyears, but now Pirot was imprisoned in it under the guard of sixty\nwarders, who lived in the tower and did not lose sight of him night or\nday, spying on him for confessions that they might afterwards report\nto the Minister of War. For Greatauk, careful and prudent, desired\nconfessions and still further confessions. Greatauk, who was looked\nupon as a fool, was in reality a man of great ability and full of rare\nforesight.\n\nIn the mean time Pyrot, burnt by the sun, eaten by mosquitoes, soaked\nin the rain, hail and snow, frozen by the cold, tossed about terribly by\nthe wind, beset by the sinister croaking of the ravens that perched upon\nhis cage, kept writing down his innocence on pieces torn off his shirt\nwith a tooth-pick dipped in blood. These rags were lost in the sea or\nfell into the hands of the gaolers. But Pyrot's protests moved nobody\nbecause his confessions had been published.\n\n\n\n\nIII. COUNT DE MAUBEC DE LA DENTDULYNX\n\nThe morals of the Jews were not always pure; in most cases they were\naverse from none of the vices of Christian civilization, but they\nretained from the Patriarchal age a recognition of family, ties and\nan attachment to the interests of the tribe. Pyrot's brothers,\nhalf-brothers, uncles, great-uncles, first, second, and third cousins,\nnephews and great-nephews, relations by blood and relations by marriage,\nand all who were related to him to the number of about seven hundred,\nwere at first overwhelmed by the blow that had struck their relative,\nand they shut themselves up in their houses, covering themselves with\nashes and blessing the hand that had chastised them. For forty days they\nkept a strict fast. Then they bathed themselves and resolved to search,\nwithout rest, at the cost of any toil and at the risk of eve danger,\nfor the demonstration of an innocence which they did not doubt. And how\ncould they have doubted? Pyrot's innocence had been revealed to them in\nthe same way that his guilt had been revealed to Christian Penguinia's;\nfor these things, being hidden, assume a mystic character and take on\nthe authority of religious truths. The seven hundred Pyrotists set to\nwork with as much zeal as prudence, and made the most thorough inquiries\nin secret. They were everywhere; they were seen nowhere. One would have\nsaid that, like the pilot of Ulysses, they wandered freely over the\nearth. They penetrated into the War Office and approached, under\ndifferent disguises, the judges, the registrars, and the witnesses of\nthe affair. Then Greatauk's cleverness was seen. The witnesses knew\nnothing; the judges and registrars knew nothing. Emissaries reached\neven Pyrot and anxiously questioned him in his cage amid the prolonged\nmoanings of the sea and the hoarse croaks of the ravens. It was in vain;\nthe prisoner knew nothing. The seven hundred Pyrotists could not subvert\nthe proofs of the accusation because they could not know what they were,\nand they could not know what they were because there were none. Pyrot's\nguilt was indefeasible through its very nullity. And it was with a\nlegitimate pride that Greatauk, expressing himself as a true artist,\nsaid one day to General Panther: \"This case is a master-piece: it is\nmade out of nothing.\" The seven hundred Pyrotists despaired of ever\nclearing up this dark business, when suddenly they discovered, from\na stolen letter, that the eighty thousand trusses of hay had never\nexisted, that a most distinguished nobleman, Count de Maubec, had\nsold them to the State, that he had received the price but had never\ndelivered them. Indeed seeing that he was descended from the richest\nlanded proprietors of ancient Penguinia, the heir of the Maubecs of\nDentdulynx, once the possessors of four duchies, sixty counties, and six\nhundred and twelve marquisates, baronies, and viscounties, he did not\npossess as much land as he could cover with his hand, and would not have\nbeen able to cut a single day's mowing of forage off his own domains. As\nto his getting a single rush from a land-owner or a merchant, that would\nhave been quite impossible, for everybody except the Ministers of State\nand the Government officials knew that it would be easier to get blood\nfrom a stone than a farthing from a Maubec.\n\nThe seven hundred Pyrotists made a minute inquiry concerning the Count\nMaubec de la Dentdulynx's financial resources, and they proved that that\nnobleman was chiefly supported by a house in which some generous ladies\nwere ready to furnish all comers with the most lavish hospitality.\nThey publicly proclaimed that he was guilty of the theft of the eighty\nthousand trusses of straw for which an innocent man had been condemned\nand was now imprisoned in the cage.\n\nMaubec belonged to an illustrious family which was allied to the\nDraconides. There is nothing that a democracy esteems more highly than\nnoble birth. Maubec had also served in the Penguin army, and since the\nPenguins were all soldiers, they loved their army to idolatry. Maubec,\non the field of battle, had received the Cross, which is a sign of\nhonour among the Penguins and which they valued even more highly than\nthe embraces of their wives. All Penguinia declared for Maubec, and the\nvoice of the people which began to assume a threatening tone, demanded\nsevere punishments for the seven hundred calumniating Pyrotists.\n\nMaubec was a nobleman; he challenged the seven hundred Pyrotists to\ncombat with either sword, sabre, pistols, carabines, or sticks.\n\n\"Vile dogs,\" he wrote to them in a famous letter, \"you have crucified\nmy God and you want my life too; I warn you that I will not be such a\nduffer as He was and that I will cut off your fourteen hundred ears.\nAccept my boot on your seven hundred behinds.\"\n\nThe Chief of the Government at the time was a peasant called Robin\nMielleux, a man pleasant to the rich and powerful, but hard towards the\npoor, a man of small courage and ignorant of his own interests. In a\npublic declaration he guaranteed Maubec's innocence and honour, and\npresented the seven hundred Pyrotists: to the criminal courts where they\nwere condemned, as libellers, to imprisonment, to enormous fines, and to\nall the damages that were claimed by their innocent victim.\n\nIt seemed as if Pyrot was destined to remain for ever shut in the cage\non which the ravens perched. But all the Penguins being anxious to know\nand prove that this Jew was guilty, all the proofs brought forward were\nfound not to be good, while some of them were also contradictory. The\nofficers of the Staff showed zeal but lacked prudence. Whilst Greatauk\nkept an admirable silence, General Panther made inexhaustible speeches\nand every morning demonstrated in the newspapers that the condemned man\nwas guilty. He would have done better, perhaps, if he had said nothing.\nThe guilt was evident and what is evident cannot be demonstrated. So\nmuch reasoning disturbed people's minds; their faith, though still\nalive, became less serene. The more proofs one gives a crowd the more\nthey ask for.\n\nNevertheless the danger of proving too much would not have been great if\nthere had not been in Penguinia, as there are, indeed, everywhere, minds\nframed for free inquiry, capable of studying a difficult question, and\ninclined to philosophic doubt. They were few; they were not all inclined\nto speak, and the public was by no means inclined to listen to them.\nStill, they did not always meet with deaf ears. The great Jews, all the\nIsraelite millionaires of Alca, when spoken to of Pyrot, said: \"We do\nnot know the man\"; but they thought of saving him. They preserved the\nprudence to which their wealth inclined them and wished that others\nwould be less timid. Their wish was to be gratified.\n\n\n\n\nIV. COLOMBAN\n\nSome weeks after the conviction of the seven hundred Pyrotists, a\nlittle, gruff, hairy, short-sighted man left his house one morning\nwith a paste-pot, a ladder, and a bundle of posters and went about the\nstreets pasting placards to the walls on which might be read in large\nletters: Pyrot is innocent, Maubec is guilty. He was not a bill-poster;\nhis name was Colomban, and as the author of sixty volumes on Penguin\nsociology he was numbered among the most laborious and respected writers\nin Alca. Having given sufficient thought to the matter and no longer\ndoubting Pyrot's innocence, he proclaimed it in the manner which he\nthought would be most sensational. He met with no hindrance while\nposting his bills in the quiet streets, but when he came to the populous\nquarters, every time he mounted his ladder, inquisitive people crowded\nround him and, dumbfounded with surprise and indignation, threw at\nhim threatening looks which he received with the calm that comes from\ncourage and short-sightedness. Whilst caretakers and tradespeople tore\ndown the bills he had posted, he kept on zealously placarding, carrying\nhis tools and followed by little boys who, with their baskets under\ntheir arms or their satchels on their backs, were in no hurry to reach\nschool. To the mute indignation against him, protests and murmurs were\nnow added. But Colomban did not condescend to see or hear anything.\nAs, at the entrance to the Rue St. Orberosia, he was posting one of his\nsquares of paper bearing the words: Pyrot is innocent, Maubec is guilty,\nthe riotous crowd showed signs of the most violent anger. They called\nafter him, \"Traitor, thief, rascal, scoundrel.\" A woman opened a window\nand emptied a vase full of filth over his head, a cabby sent his hat\nflying from one end of the street to the other by a blow of his\nwhip amid the cheers of the crowd who now felt themselves avenged. A\nbutcher's boy knocked Colomban with his paste-pot, his brush, and his\nposters, from the top of his ladder into the gutter, and the proud\nPenguins then felt the greatness of their country. Colomban stood up,\ncovered with filth, lame, and with his elbow injured, but tranquil and\nresolute.\n\n\"Low brutes,\" he muttered, shrugging his shoulders.\n\nThen he went down on all-fours in the gutter to look for his glasses\nwhich he had lost in his fall. It was then seen that his coat was split\nfrom the collar to the tails and that his trousers were in rags. The\nrancour of the crowd grew stronger.\n\nOn the other side of the street stretched the big St. Orberosian Stores.\nThe patriots seized whatever they could lay their hands on from the shop\nfront, and hurled at Colomban oranges, lemons, pots of jam, pieces of\nchocolate, bottles of liqueurs, boxes of sardines, pots of foie gras,\nhams, fowls, flasks of oil, and bags of haricots. Covered with the\ndebris of the food, bruised, tattered, lame, and blind, he took to\nflight, followed by the shop-boys, bakers, loafers, citizens, and\nhooligans whose number increased each moment and who kept shouting:\n\"Duck him! Death to the traitor! Duck him!\" This torrent of vulgar\nhumanity swept along the streets and rushed into the Rue St. Mael.\nThe police did their duty. From all the adjacent streets constables\nproceeded and, holding their scabbards with their left hands, they\nwent at full speed in front of the pursuers. They were on the point of\ngrabbing Colomban in their huge hands when he suddenly escaped them by\nfalling through an open man-hole to the bottom of a sewer.\n\nHe spent the night there in the darkness, sitting close by the dirty\nwater amidst the fat and slimy rats. He thought of his task, and his\nswelling heart filled with courage and pity. And when the dawn threw\na pale ray of light into the air-hole he got up and said, speaking to\nhimself:\n\n\"I see that the fight will be a stiff one.\"\n\nForthwith he composed a memorandum in which he clearly showed that\nPyrot could not have stolen from the Ministry of War the eighty thousand\ntrusses of hay which it had never received, for the reason that Maubec\nhad never delivered them, though he had received the money. Colomban\ncaused this statement to be distributed in the streets of Alca. The\npeople refused to read it and tore it up in anger. The shop-keepers\nshook their fists at the distributers, who made off, chased by angry\nwomen armed with brooms. Feelings grew warm and the ferment lasted the\nwhole day. In the evening bands of wild and ragged men went about\nthe streets yelling: \"Death to Colomban!\" The patriots snatched whole\nbundles of the memorandum from the newsboys and burned them in the\npublic squares, dancing wildly round these bon-fires with girls whose\npetticoats were tied up to their waists.\n\nSome of the more enthusiastic among them went and broke the windows of\nthe house in which Colomban had lived in perfect tranquillity during his\nforty years of work.\n\nParliament was roused and asked the Chief of the Government what\nmeasures he proposed to take in order to repel the odious attacks\nmade by Colomban upon the honour of the National Arm and the safety\nof Penguinia. Robin Mielleux denounced Colomban's impious audacity and\nproclaimed amid the cheers of the legislators that the man would be\nsummoned before the Courts to answer for his infamous libel.\n\nThe Minister of War was called to the tribune and appeared in it\ntransfigured. He had no longer the air, as in former days, of one of the\nsacred geese of the Penguin citadels. Now, bristling, with outstretched\nneck and hooked beak, he seemed the symbolical vulture fastened to the\nlivers of his country's enemies.\n\nIn the august silence of the assembly he pronounced these words only:\n\n\"I swear that Pyrot is a rascal.\"\n\nThis speech of Greatauk was reported all over Penguinia and satisfied\nthe public conscience.\n\n\n\n\nV. THE REVEREND FATHERS AGARIC AND CORNEMUSE\n\nColomban bore with meekness and surprise the weight of the general\nreprobation. He could not go out without being stoned, so he did not\ngo out. He remained in his study with a superb obstinacy, writing new\nmemoranda in favour of the encaged innocent. In the mean time among\nthe few readers that he found, some, about a dozen, were struck by his\nreasons and began to doubt Pyrot's guilt. They broached the subject to\ntheir friends and endeavoured to spread the light that had arisen in\ntheir minds. One of them was a friend of Robin Mielleux and confided to\nhim his perplexities, with the result that he was no longer received by\nthat Minister. Another demanded explanations in an open letter to the\nMinister of War. A third published a terrible pamphlet. The latter,\nwhose name was Kerdanic, was a formidable controversialist. The public\nwas unmoved. It was said that these defenders of the traitor had been\nbribed by the rich Jews; they were stigmatized by the name of Pyrotists\nand the patriots swore to exterminate them. There were only a thousand\nor twelve hundred Pyrotists in the whole vast Republic, but it was\nbelieved that they were everywhere. People were afraid of finding\nthem in the promenades, at meetings, at receptions, in fashionable\ndrawing-rooms, at the dinner-table, even in the conjugal couch. One half\nof the population was suspected by the other half. The discord set all\nAlca on fire.\n\nIn the mean time Father Agaric, who managed his big school for young\nnobles, followed events with anxious attention. The misfortunes of the\nPenguin Church had not disheartened him. He remained faithful to Prince\nCrucho and preserved the hope of restoring the heir of the Draconides\nto the Penguin throne. It appeared to him that the events that were\nhappening or about to happen in the country, the state of mind of\nwhich they were at once the effect and the cause, and the troubles that\nnecessarily resulted from them might--if they were directed, guided, and\nled by the profound wisdom of a monk--overthrow the Republic and incline\nthe Penguins to restore Prince Crucho, from whose piety the faithful\nhoped for so much solace. Wearing his huge black hat, the brims of which\nlooked like the wings of Night, he walked through the Wood of Conils\ntowards the factory where his venerable friend, Father Cornemuse,\ndistilled the hygienic St. Orberosian liqueur, The good monk's industry,\nso cruelly affected in the time of Emiral Chatillon, was being restored\nfrom its ruins. One heard goods trains rumbling through the Wood and one\nsaw in the sheds hundreds of orphans clothed in blue, packing bottles\nand nailing up cases.\n\nAgaric found the venerable Cornemuse standing before his stoves and\nsurrounded by his retorts. The shining pupils of the old man's eyes had\nagain become as rubies, his skull shone with its former elaborate and\ncareful polish.\n\nAgaric first congratulated the pious distiller on the restored activity\nof his laboratories and workshops.\n\n\"Business is recovering. I thank God for it,\" answered the old man of\nConils. \"Alas! it had fallen into a bad state, Brother Agaric. You raw\nthe desolation of this establishment. I need say no more.\"\n\nAgaric turned away his head.\n\n\"The St. Orberosian liqueur,\" continued Cornemuse, \"is making fresh\nconquests. But none the less my industry remains uncertain and\nprecarious. The laws of ruin and desolation that struck it have not been\nabrogated, they have only been suspended.\"\n\nAnd the monk of Conils lifted his ruby eyes to heaven.\n\nAgaric put his hand on his shoulder.\n\n\"What a sight, Cornemuse, does unhappy Penguinia present to us!\nEverywhere disobedience, independence, liberty! We seethe proud, the\nhaughty, the men of revolt rising up. After having braved the Divine\nlaws they now rear themselves against human laws, so true is it that in\norder to be a good citizen a man must be a good Christian. Colomban\nis trying to imitate Satan. Numerous criminals are following his fatal\nexample. They want, in their rage, to put aside all checks, to throw off\nall yokes, to free themselves from the most sacred bonds, to escape from\nthe most salutary restraints. They strike their country to make it obey\nthem. But they will be overcome by the weight of public animadversion,\nvituperation, indignation, fury, execration, and abomination. That is\nthe abyss to which they have been led by atheism, free thought, and the\nmonstrous claim to judge for themselves and to form their own opinions.\"\n\n\"Doubtless, doubtless,\" replied Father Cornemuse, shaking his head, \"but\nI confess that the care of distilling these simples has prevented me\nfrom following public affairs. I only know that people are talking a\ngreat deal about a man called Pyrot. Some maintain that he is guilty,\nothers affirm that he is innocent, but I do not clearly understand the\nmotives that drive both parties to mix themselves up in a business that\nconcerns neither of them.\"\n\nThe pious Agaric asked eagerly:\n\n\"You do not doubt Pyrot's guilt?\"\n\n\"I cannot doubt it, dear Agaric,\" answered the monk of Conils. \"That\nwould be contrary to the laws of my country which we ought to respect as\nlong as they are not opposed to the Divine laws. Pyrot is guilty, for\nhe has been convicted. As to saying more for or against his guilt, that\nwould be to erect my own authority against that of the judges, a thing\nwhich I will take good care not to do. Besides, it is useless, for Pyrot\nhas been convicted. If he has not been convicted because he is guilty,\nhe is guilty because he has been convicted; it comes to the same thing.\nI believe in his guilt as every good citizen ought to believe in it; and\nI will believe in it as long as the established jurisdiction will order\nme to believe in it, for it is not for a private person but for a\njudge to proclaim the innocence of a convicted person. Human justice\nis venerable even in the errors inherent in its fallible and limited\nnature. These errors are never irreparable; if the judges do not repair\nthem on earth, God will repair them in Heaven. Besides I have great\nconfidence in general Greatauk, who, though he certainly does not look\nit, seems to me to be an abler man than all those who are attacking\nhim.\"\n\n\"Dearest Cornemuse,\" cried the pious Agaric, \"the Pyrot affair, if\npushed to the point whither we can lead it by the help of God and the\nnecessary funds, will produce the greatest benefits. It will lay bare\nthe vices of this Anti-Christian Republic and will incline the Penguins\nto restore the throne of the Draconides and the prerogatives of the\nChurch. But to do that it is necessary for the people to see the clergy\nin the front rank of its defenders. Let us march against the enemies of\nthe army, against those who insult our heroes, and everybody will follow\nus.\"\n\n\"Everybody will be too many,\" murmured the monk of Conils, shaking his\nhead. \"I see that the Penguins want to quarrel. If we mix ourselves up\nin their quarrel they will become reconciled at our expense and we shall\nhave to pay the cost of the war. That is why, if you are guided by me,\ndear Agaric, you will not engage the Church in this adventure.\"\n\n\"You know my energy; you know my prudence. I will compromise nothing.\n. . . Dear Cornemuse, I only want from you the funds necessary for us to\nbegin the campaign.\"\n\nFor a long time Cornemuse refused to bear the expenses of what he\nthought was a fatal enterprise. Agaric was in turn pathetic and\nterrible. At last, yielding to his prayers and threats, Cornemuse, with\nbanging head and swinging arms, went to the austere cell that concealed\nhis evangelical poverty. In the whitewashed wall under a branch of\nblessed box, there was fixed a safe. He opened it, and with a sigh took\nout a bundle of bills which, with hesitating hands, he gave to the pious\nAgaric.\n\n\"Do not doubt it, dear Cornemuse,\" said the latter, thrusting the papers\ninto the pocket of his overcoat, \"this Pyrot affair has been sent us by\nGod for the glory and exaltation of the Church of Penguinia.\"\n\n\"I pray that you may be right!\" sighed the monk of Conils.\n\nAnd, left alone in his laboratory, he gazed, through his exquisite eyes,\nwith an ineffable sadness at his stoves and his retorts.\n\n\n\n\nVI. THE SEVEN HUNDRED PYROTISTS\n\nThe seven hundred Pyrotists inspired the public with an increasing\naversion. Every day two or three of them were beaten to death in the\nstreets. One of them was publicly whipped, another thrown into the\nriver, a third tarred and feathered and led through a laughing crowd, a\nfourth had his nose cut off by a captain of dragoons. They did not dare\nto show themselves at their clubs, at tennis, or at the races; they\nput on a disguise when they went to the Stock Exchange. In these\ncircumstances the Prince des Boscenos thought it urgent to curb their\naudacity and repress their insolence. For this purpose he joined with\nCount Clena, M. de La Trumelle, Viscount Olive, and M. Bigourd in\nfounding a great anti-Pyrotist association to which citizens in hundreds\nof thousands, soldiers in companies, regiments, brigades, divisions, and\narmy corps, towns, districts, and provinces, all gave their adhesion.\n\nAbout this time the Minister of War happening to visit one day his Chief\nof Staff, saw with surprise that the large room where General Panther\nworked, which was formerly quite bare, had now along each wall from\nfloor to ceiling in sets of deep pigeon-holes, triple and quadruple rows\nof paper bundles of every as form and colour. These sudden and monstrous\nrecords had in a few days reached the dimensions of a pile of archives\nsuch as it takes centuries to accumulate.\n\n\"What is this?\" asked the astonished minister.\n\n\"Proofs against Pyrot,\" answered General Panther with patriotic\nsatisfaction. \"We had not got them when we convicted him, but we have\nplenty of them now.\"\n\nThe door was open, and Greatauk saw coming up the stair-case a long file\nof porters who were unloading heavy bales of papers in the hall, and he\nsaw the lift slowly rising heavily loaded with paper packets.\n\n\"What are those others?\" said he.\n\n\"They are fresh proofs against Pyrot that are now reaching us,\" said\nPanther. \"I have asked for them in every county of Penguinia, in every\nStaff Office and in every Court in Europe. I have ordered them in every\ntown in America and in Australia, and in every factory in Africa, and I\nam expecting bales of them from Bremen and a ship-load from Melbourne.\"\nAnd Panther turned towards the Minister of War the tranquil and radiant\nlook of a hero. However, Greatauk, his eye-glass in his eye, was looking\nat the formidable pile of papers with less satisfaction than uneasiness.\n\n\"Very good,\" said he, \"very good! but I am afraid that this Pyrot\nbusiness may lose its beautiful simplicity. It was limpid; like a\nrock-crystal its value lay in its transparency. You could have searched\nit in vain with a magnifying-glass for a straw, a bend, a blot, for the\nleast fault. When it left my hands it was as pure as the light. Indeed\nit was the light. I give you a pearl and you make a mountain out of it.\nTo tell you the truth I am afraid that by wishing to do too well you\nhave done less well. Proofs! of course it is good to have proofs, but\nperhaps it is better to have none at all. I have already told you,\nPanther, there is only one irrefutable proof, the confession of the\nguilty person (or if the innocent what matter!). The Pyrot affair, as\nI arranged it, left no room for criticism; there was no spot where it\ncould be touched. It defied assault. It was invulnerable because it was\ninvisible. Now it gives an enormous handle for discussion. I advise\nyou, Panther, to use your paper packets with great reserve. I should\nbe particularly grateful if you would be more sparing of your\ncommunications to journalists. You speak well, but you say too much.\nTell me, Panther, are there any forged documents among these?\"\n\n\"There are some adapted ones.\"\n\n\"That is what I meant. There are some adapted ones. So much the better.\nAs proofs, forged documents, in general, are better than genuine ones,\nfirst of all because they have been expressly made to suit the needs\nof the case, to order and measure, and therefore they are fitting and\nexact. They are also preferable because they carry the mind into an\nideal world and turn it aside from the reality which, alas! in this\nworld is never without some alloy. . . . Nevertheless, I think I should\nhave preferred, Panther, that we had no proofs at all.\"\n\nThe first act of the Anti-Pyrotist Association was to ask the Government\nimmediately to summon the seven hundred Pyrotists and their accomplices\nbefore the High Court of Justice as guilty of high treason. Prince des\nBoscenos was charged to speak on behalf of the Association and presented\nhimself before the Council which had assembled to hear him. He expressed\na hope that the vigilance and firmness of the Government would rise to\nthe height of the occasion. He shook hands with each of the ministers\nand as he passed General Greatauk he whispered in his ear:\n\n\"Behave properly, you ruffian, or I will publish the Maloury dossier!\"\n\nSome days later by a unanimous vote of both Houses, on a motion proposed\nby the Government, the Anti-Pyrotist Association was granted a charter\nrecognising it as beneficial to the public interest.\n\nThe Association immediately sent a deputation to Chitterlings Castle in\nPorpoisia, where Crucho was eating the bitter bread of exile, to assure\nthe prince of the love and devotion of the Anti-Pyrotist members.\n\nHowever, the Pyrotists grew in numbers, and now counted ten thousand.\nThey had their regular cafes on the boulevards. The patriots had theirs\nalso, richer and bigger, and every evening glasses of beer, saucers,\nmatch-stands, jugs, chairs, and tables were hurled from one to the\nother. Mirrors were smashed to bits, and the police ended the struggles\nby impartially trampling the combatants of both parties under their\nhob-nailed shoes.\n\nOn one of these glorious nights, as Prince des Boscenos was leaving\na fashionable cafe in the company of some patriots, M. de La Trumelle\npointed out to him a little, bearded man with glasses, hatless, and\nhaving only one sleeve to his coat, who was painfully dragging himself\nalong the rubbish-strewn pavement.\n\n\"Look!\" said he, \"there is Colomban!\"\n\nThe prince had gentleness as well as strength; he was exceedingly mild;\nbut at the name of Colomban his blood boiled. He rushed at the little\nspectacled man, and knocked him down with one blow of his fist on the\nnose.\n\nM. de La Trumelle then perceived that, misled by an undeserved\nresemblance, he had mistaken for Colomban, M. Bazile, a retired lawyer,\nthe secretary of the Anti-pyrotist Association, and an ardent and\ngenerous patriot. Prince des Boscenos was one of those antique souls who\nnever bend. However, he knew how to recognise his faults.\n\n\"M. Bazile,\" said he, raising his hat, \"if I have touched your face with\nmy hand you will excuse me and you will understand me, you will approve\nof me, nay, you will compliment me, you will congratulate me and\nfelicitate me, when you know the cause of that act. I took you for\nColomban.\"\n\nM. Bazile, wiping his bleeding nostrils with his handkerchief and\ndisplaying an elbow laid bare by the absence of his sleeve:\n\n\"No, sir,\" answered he drily, \"I shall not felicitate you, I shall not\ncongratulate you, I shall not compliment you, for your action was, at\nthe very least, superfluous; it was, I will even say, supererogatory.\nAlready this evening I have been three times mistaken for Colomban and\nreceived a sufficient amount of the treatment he deserves. The patriots\nhave knocked in my ribs and broken my back, and, sir, I was of opinion\nthat that was enough.\"\n\nScarcely had he finished this speech than a band of Pyrotists appeared,\nand misled in their turn by that insidious resemblance, they believed\nthat the patriots were killing Colomban. They fell on Prince des\nBoscenos and his companions with loaded canes and leather thongs, and\nleft them for dead. Then seizing Bazile they carried him in triumph, and\nin spite of his protests, along the boulevards, amid cries of: \"Hurrah\nfor Colomban! Hurrah for Pyrot!\" At last the police, who had been sent\nafter them, attacked and defeated them and dragged them ignominiously to\nthe station, where Bazile, under the name of Colomban, was trampled on\nby an innumerable quantity of thick, hob-nailed shoes.\n\n\n\n\nVII. BIDAULT-COQUILLE AND MANIFLORE, THE SOCIALISTS\n\nWhilst the wind of anger and hatred blew in Alca, Eugine\nBidault-Coquille, poorest and happiest of astronomers, installed in\nan old steam-engine of the time of the Draconides, was observing the\nheavens through a bad telescope, and photographing the paths of the\nmeteors upon some damaged photographic plates. His genius corrected the\nerrors of his instruments and his love of science triumphed over the\nworthlessness of his apparatus. With an inextinguishable ardour he\nobserved aerolites, meteors, and fire-balls, and all the glowing ruins\nand blazing sparks which pass through the terrestrial atmosphere with\nprodigious speed, and as a reward for is studious vigils he received the\nindifference of the public, the ingratitude of the State and the blame\nof the learned societies. Engulfed in the celestial spaces he knew\nnot what occurred upon the surface of the earth. He never read the\nnewspapers, and when he walked through the town his mind was occupied\nwith the November asteroids, and more than once he found himself at the\nbottom of a pond in one of the public parks or beneath the wheels of a\nmotor omnibus.\n\nElevated in stature as in thought he respected himself and others. This\nwas shown by his cold politeness as well as by a very thin black frock\ncoat and a tall hat which gave to his person an appearance at once\nemaciated and sublime. He took his meals in a little restaurant from\nwhich all customers less intellectual than himself had fled, and\nthenceforth his napkin bound by its wooden ring rested alone in the\nabandoned rack.\n\nIn this cook-shop his eyes fell one evening upon Colomban's memorandum\nin favour of Pyrot. He read it as he was cracking some bad nuts and\nsuddenly, exalted with astonishment, admiration, horror, and pity, he\nforgot all about falling meteors and shooting stars and saw nothing but\nthe innocent man hanging in his cage exposed to the winds of heaven and\nthe ravens perching upon it.\n\nThat image did not leave him. For a week he had been obsessed by the\ninnocent convict, when, as he was leaving his cook-shop, he saw a crowd\nof citizens entering a public-house in which a public meeting was going\non. He went in. The meeting was disorderly; they were yelling, abusing\none another and knocking one another down in the smoke-laden hall. The\nPyrotists and the Anti-Pyrotists spoke in turn and were alternately\ncheered and hissed at. An obscure and confused enthusiasm moved the\naudience. With the audacity of a timid and retired man Bidault-Coquille\nleaped upon the platform and spoke for three-quarters of an hour. He\nspoke very quickly, without order, but with vehemence, and with all the\nconviction of a mathematical mystic. He was cheered. When he got down\nfrom the platform a big woman of uncertain age, dressed in red, and\nwearing an immense hat trimmed with heroic feathers, throwing herself\ninto his arms, embraced him, and said to him:\n\n\"You are splendid!\"\n\nHe thought in his simplicity that there was some truth in the statement.\n\nShe declared to him that henceforth she would live but for Pyrot's\ndefence and Colomban's glory. He thought her sublime and beautiful. She\nwas Maniflore, a poor old courtesan, now forgotten and discarded, who\nhad suddenly become a vehement politician.\n\nShe never left him. They spent glorious hours together in doss-houses\nand in lodgings beautified by their love, in newspaper offices, in\nmeeting-halls and in lecture-halls. As he was an idealist, he persisted\nin thinking her beautiful, although she gave him abundant opportunity of\nseeing that she had preserved no charm of any kind. From her past beauty\nshe only retained a confidence in her capacity for pleasing and a lofty\nassurance in demanding homage. Still, it must be admitted that this\nPyrot affair, so fruitful in prodigies, invested Maniflore with a sort\nof civic majesty, and transformed her, at public meetings, into an\naugust symbol of justice and truth.\n\nBidault-Coquille and Maniflore did not kindle the least spark of irony\nor amusement in a single Anti-Pyrotist, a single defender of Greatauk,\nor a single supporter of the army. The gods, in their anger, had refused\nto those men the precious gift of humour. They gravely accused the\ncourtesan and the astronomer of being spies, of treachery, and of\nplotting against their country. Bidault-Coquille and Maniflore grew\nvisibly greater beneath insult, abuse, and calumny.\n\nFor long months Penguinia had been divided into two camps and, though at\nfirst sight it may appear strange, hitherto the socialists had taken\nno part in the contest. Their groups comprised almost all the manual\nworkers in the country, necessarily scattered, confused, broken up, and\ndivided, but formidable. The Pyrot affair threw the group leaders into a\nsingular embarrassment. They did not wish to place themselves either on\nthe side of the financiers or on the side of the army. They regarded\nthe Jews, both great and small, as their uncompromising opponents. Their\nprinciples were not at stake, nor were their interests concerned in the\naffair. Still the greater number felt how difficult it was growing for\nthem to remain aloof from struggles in which all Penguinia was engaged.\n\nTheir leaders called a sitting of their federation at the Rue de la\nQueue-du-diable-St. Mael, to take into consideration the conduct they\nought to adopt in the present circumstances and in future eventualities.\n\nComrade Phoenix was the first to speak.\n\n\"A crime,\" said he, \"the most odious and cowardly of crimes, a judicial\ncrime, has been committed. Military judges, coerced or misled by their\nsuperior officers, have condemned an innocent man to an infamous and\ncruel punishment. Let us not say that the victim is not one of our own\nparty, that he belongs to a caste which was, and always will be, our\nenemy. Our party is the party of social justice; it can look upon no\niniquity with indifference.\n\n\"It would be a shame for us if we left it to Kerdanic, a radical,\nto Colomban, a member of the middle classes, and to a few moderate\nRepublicans, alone to proceed against the crimes of the army. If\nthe victim is not one of us, his executioners are our brothers'\nexecutioners, and before Greatauk struck down this soldier he shot our\ncomrades who were on strike.\n\n\"Comrades, by an intellectual, moral and material effort you must rescue\nPyrot from his torment, and in performing this generous act you are\nnot turning aside from the liberating and revolutionary task you have\nundertaken, for Pyrot his become the symbol of the oppressed and of all\nthe social iniquities that now exist; by destroying one you make all the\nothers tremble.\"\n\nWhen Phoenix ended, comrade Sapor spoke in these terms:\n\n\"You are advised to abandon your task in order to do something with\nwhich you have no concern. Why throw yourselves into a conflict\nwhere, on whatever side you turn, you will find none but your natural,\nuncompromising, even necessary opponents? Are the financiers to be less\nhated by us than the army? What inept and criminal generosity is it that\nhurries you to save those seven hundred Pyrotists whom you will always\nfind confronting you in the social war?\n\n\"It is proposed that you act the part of the police for your enemies,\nand that you are to re-establish for them the order which their own\ncrimes have disturbed. Magnanimity pushed to this degree changes its\nname.\n\n\"Comrades, there is a point at which infamy becomes fatal to a society.\nPenguin society is being strangled by its infamy, and you are requested\nto save it, to give it air that it can breathe. This is simply turning\nyou into ridicule.\n\n\"Leave is to smother itself and let us gaze at its last convulsions with\njoyful contempt, only regretting that it has so entirely corrupted the\nsoil on which it has been built that we shall find nothing but poisoned\nmud on which to lay the foundations of a new society.\"\n\nWhen Sapor had ended his speech comrade Lapersonne pronounced these few\nwords:\n\n\"Phoenix calls us to Pyrot's help for the reason that Pyrot is innocent.\nIt seems to me that that is a very bad reason. If Pyrot is innocent he\nhas behaved like a good soldier and has always conscientiously worked\nat his trade, which principally consists in shooting the people. That is\nnot a motive to make the people brave all dangers in his defence. When\nit is demonstrated to me that Pyrot is guilty and that he stole the army\nhay, I shall be on his side.\"\n\nComrade Larrivee afterwards spoke.\n\n\"I am not of my friend, Phoenix's opinion but I am not with my friend\nSapor either. I do not believe that the party is bound to embrace a\ncause as soon as we are told that that cause is just. That, I am afraid,\nis a grievous abuse of words and a dangerous equivocation. For social\njustice is not revolutionary justice. They are both in perpetual\nantagonism: to serve the one is to oppose the other. As for me, my\nchoice is made. I am for revolutionary justice as against social\njustice. Still, in the present case I am against abstention. I say that\nwhen a lucky chance brings us an affair like this we should be fools not\nto profit by it.\n\n\"How? We are given an opportunity of striking terrible, perhaps\nfatal, blows against militarism. And am I to fold my arms? I tell you,\ncomrades, I am not a fakir, I have never been a fakir, and if there are\nfakirs here let them not count on me. To sit in meditation is a policy\nwithout results and one which I shall never adopt.\n\n\"A party like ours ought to be continually asserting itself. It ought to\nprove its existence by continual action. We will intervene in the Pyrot\naffair but we will intervene in it in a revolutionary manner; we\nwill adopt violent action. . . . Perhaps you think that violence is\nold-fashioned and superannuated, to be scrapped along with diligences,\nhand-presses and aerial telegraphy. You are mistaken. To-day as\nyesterday nothing is obtained except by violence; it is the one\nefficient instrument. The only thing necessary is to know how to use it.\nYou ask what will our action be? I will tell you: it will be to stir up\nthe governing classes against one another, to put the army in conflict\nwith the capitalists, the government with the magistracy, the nobility\nand clergy with the Jews, and if possible to drive them all to destroy\none another. To do this would be to carry on an agitation which would\nweaken government in the same way that fever wears out the sick.\n\n\"The Pyrot affair, little as we know how to turn it to advantage,\nwill put forward by ten years the growth of the Social party and the\nemancipation of the proletariat, by disarmament, the general strike, and\nrevolution.\"\n\nThe leaders of the party having each expressed a different opinion, the\ndiscussion was continued, not without vivacity. The orators, as always\nhappens in such a case, reproduced the arguments they had already\nbrought forward, though with less order and moderation than before. The\ndispute was prolonged and none changed his opinion. These opinions, in\nthe final analysis, were reduced to two: that of Sapor and Lapersonne\nwho advised abstention, and that of Phoenix and Larrivee, who wanted\nintervention. Even these two contrary opinions were united in a common\nhatred of the heads of the army and of their justice, and in a common\nbelief in Pyrot's innocence. So that public opinion was hardly mistaken\nin regarding all the Socialist leaders as pernicious Anti-Pyrotists.\n\nAs for the vast masses in whose name they spoke and whom they\nrepresented as far as speech can express the impossible--as for the\nproletarians whose thought is difficult to know and who do not know it\nthemselves, it seemed that the Pyrot affair did not interest them. It\nwas too literary for them, it was in too classical a style, and had an\nupper-middle-class and high-finance tone about it that did not please\nthem much.\n\n\n\n\nVIII. THE COLOMBAN TRIAL\n\nWhen the Colomban trial began, the Pyrotists were not many more than\nthirty thousand, but they were every where and might be found even among\nthe priests and millionaires. What injured them most was the sympathy of\nthe rich Jews. On the other hand they derived valuable advantages from\ntheir feeble number. In the first place there were among them fewer\nfools than among their opponents, who were over-burdened with them.\nComprising but a feeble minority, they co-operated easily, acted\nwith harmony, and had no temptation to divide and thus counteract one\nanother's efforts. Each of them felt the necessity of doing the best\npossible and was the more careful of his conduct as he found himself\nmore in the public eye. Finally, they had every reason to hope that they\nwould gain fresh adherents, while their opponents, having had everybody\nwith them at the beginning, could only decrease.\n\nSummoned before the judges at a public sitting, Colomban immediately\nperceived that his judges were not anxious to discover the truth. As\nsoon as he opened his mouth the President ordered him to be silent in\nthe superior interests of the State. For the same reason, which is the\nsupreme reason, the witnesses for the defence were not heard. General\nPanther, the Chief of the Staff, appeared in the witness-box, in full\nuniform and decorated with all his orders. He deposed as follows:\n\n\"The infamous Colomban states that we have no proofs against Pyrot. He\nlies; we have them. I have in my archives seven hundred and thirty-two\nsquare yards of them which at five hundred pounds each make three\nhundred and sixty-six thousand pounds.\"\n\nThat superior officer afterwards gave, with elegance and ease, a summary\nof those proofs.\n\n\"They are of all colours and all shades,\" said he in substance, \"they\nare of every form--pot, crown, sovereign, grape, dove-cot, grand eagle,\netc. The smallest is less than the hundredth part of a square inch, the\nlargest measures seventy yards long by ninety yards broad.\"\n\nAt this revelation the audience shuddered with horror.\n\nGreatauk came to give evidence in his turn. Simpler, and perhaps\ngreater, he wore a grey tunic and held his hands joined behind his back.\n\n\"I leave,\" said he calmly and in a slightly raised voice, \"I leave to M.\nColomban the responsibility for an act that has brought our country\nto the brink of ruin. The Pyrot affair is secret; it ought to remain\nsecret. If it were divulged the cruelest ills, wars, pillages,\ndepredations, fires, massacres, and epidemics would immediately burst\nupon Penguinia. I should consider myself guilty of high treason if I\nuttered another word.\"\n\nSome persons known for their political experience, among others M.\nBigourd, considered the evidence of the Minister of War as abler and of\ngreater weight than that of his Chief of Staff.\n\nThe evidence of Colonel de Boisjoli made a great impression.\n\n\"One evening at the Ministry of War,\" said that officer, \"the attache of\na neighbouring Power told me that while visiting his sovereign's stables\nhe had once admired some soft and fragrant hay, of a pretty green\ncolour, the finest hay he had ever seen! 'Where did it come from?' I\nasked him. He did not answer, but there seemed to me no doubt about its\norigin. It was the hay Pyrot had stolen. Those qualities of verdure,\nsoftness, and aroma, are those of our national hay. The forage of the\nneighbouring Power is grey and brittle; it sounds under the fork and\nsmells of dust. One can draw one own conclusions.\"\n\nLieutenant-Colonel Hastaing said in the witness-box, amid hisses, that\nhe did not believe Pyrot guilty. He was immediately seized by the police\nand thrown into the bottom of a dungeon where, amid vipers, toads, and\nbroken glass, he remained insensible both to promises and threats.\n\nThe usher called:\n\n\"Count Pierre Maubec de la Dentdulynx.\"\n\nThere was deep silence, and a stately but ill-dressed nobleman, whose\nmoustaches pointed to the skies and whose dark eyes shot forth flashing\nglances, was seen advancing toward the witness-box.\n\nHe approached Colomban and casting upon him a look of ineffable disdain:\n\n\"My evidence,\" said he, \"here it is: you excrement!\"\n\nAt these words the entire hall burst into enthusiastic applause and\njumped up, moved by one of those transports that stir men's hearts and\nrouse them to extraordinary actions. Without another word Count Maubec\nde la Dentdulynx withdrew.\n\nAll those present left the Court and formed a procession behind him.\nProstrate at his feet, Princess des Boscenos held his legs in a close\nembrace, but he went on, stern and impassive, beneath a shower of\nhandkerchiefs and flowers. Viscountess Olive, clinging to his neck,\ncould not be removed, and the calm hero bore her along with him,\nfloating on his breast like a light scarf.\n\nWhen the court resumed its sitting, which it had been compelled to\nsuspend, the President called the experts.\n\nVermillard, the famous expert in handwriting, gave the results of his\nresearches.\n\n\"Having carefully studied,\" said he, \"the papers found in Pyrot's house,\nin particular his account book and his laundry books, I noticed that,\nthough apparently not out of the common, they formed an impenetrable\ncryptogram, the key to which, however, I discovered. The traitor's\ninfamy is to be seen in every line. In this system of writing the\nwords 'Three glasses of beer and twenty francs for Adele' mean 'I have\ndelivered thirty thousand trusses of hay to a neighbouring Power! From\nthese documents I have even been able to establish the composition of\nthe hay delivered by this officer. The words waistcoat, drawers, pocket\nhandkerchief, collars, drink, tobacco, cigars, mean clover, meadowgrass,\nlucern, burnet, oats, rye-grass, vernal-grass, and common cat's tail\ngrass. And these are precisely the constituents of the hay furnished\nby Count Maubec to the Penguin cavalry. In this way Pyrot mentioned\nhis crimes in a language that he believed would always remain\nindecipherable. One is confounded by so much astuteness and so great a\nwant of conscience.\"\n\nColomban, pronounced guilty without any extenuating circumstances,\nwas condemned to the severest penalty. The judges immediately signed a\nwarrant consuming him to solitary confinement.\n\nIn the Place du Palais on the sides of a river whose banks had during\nthe course of twelve centuries seen so great a history, fifty thousand\npersons were tumultuously awaiting the result of the trial. Here were\nthe heads of the Anti-Pyrotist Association, among whom might be seen\nPrince des Boscenos, Count Clena, Viscount Olive, and M. de La Trumelle;\nhere crowded the Reverend Father Agaric and the teachers of St. Mael\nCollege with their pupils; here the monk Douillard and General Caraguel,\nembracing each other, formed a sublime group. The market women and\nlaundry women with spits, shovels, tongs, beetles, and kettles full of\nwater might be seen running across the Pont-Vieux. On the steps in front\nof the bronze gates were assembled all the defenders of Pyrot in Alca,\nprofessors, publicists, workmen, some conservatives, others Radicals or\nRevolutionaries, and by their negligent dress and fierce aspect could\nbe recognised comrades Phoenix, Larrivee, Lapersonne, Dagobert, and\nVarambille. Squeezed in his funereal frock-coat and wearing his hat of\nceremony, Bidault-Coquille invoked the sentimental mathematics on\nbehalf of Colomban and Colonel Hastaing. Maniflore shone smiling and\nresplendent on the topmost step, anxious, like Leaena, to deserve\na glorious monument, or to be given, like Epicharis, the praises of\nhistory.\n\nThe seven hundred Pyrotists disguised as lemonade sellers,\nutter-merchants, collectors of odds and ends, or anti-Pyrotists,\nwandered round the vast building.\n\nWhen Colomban appeared, so great an uproar burst forth that, struck by\nthe commotion of air and water, birds fell from the trees and fishes\nfloated on the surface of the stream.\n\nOn all sides there were yells:\n\n\"Duck Colomban, duck him, duck him!\"\n\nThere were some cries of \"Justice and truth!\" and a voice was even heard\nshouting:\n\n\"Down with the Army!\"\n\nThis was the signal for a terrible struggle. The combatants fell in\nthousands, and their bodies formed howling and moving mounds on top of\nwhich fresh champions gripped each other by the throats. Women, eager,\npale, and dishevelled, with clenched teeth and frantic nails, rushed\non the man, in transports that, in the brilliant light of the public\nsquare, gave to their faces expressions unsurpassed even in the shade\nof curtains and in the hollows of pillows. They were going to seize\nColomban, to bite him, to strangle, dismember and rend him, when\nManiflore, tall and dignified in her red tunic, stood forth, serene\nand terrible, confronting these furies who recoiled from before her in\nterror. Colomban seemed to be saved; his partisans succeeded in clearing\na passage for him through the Place du Palais and in putting him into a\ncab stationed at the corner of the Pont-Vieux. The horse was already in\nfull trot when Prince des Boscenos, Count Clena, and M. de La Trumelle\nknocked the driver off his seat. Then, making the animal back and\npushing the spokes of the wheels, they ran the vehicle on to the parapet\nof the bridge, whence they overturned it into the river amid the cheers\nof the delirious crowd. With a resounding splash a jet of water rose\nupwards, and then nothing but a slight eddy was to be seen on the\nsurface of the stream.\n\nAlmost immediately comrades Dagobert and Varambille, with the help of\nthe seven hundred disguised Pyrotists, sent Prince des Boscenos head\nforemost into a river-laundry in which he was lamentably swallowed up.\n\nSerene night descended over the Place du Palais and shed silence and\npeace upon the frightful ruins with which it was strewed. In the mean\ntime, Colomban, three thousand yards down the stream, cowering beside\na lame old horse on a bridge, was meditating on the ignorance and\ninjustice of crowds.\n\n\"The business,\" said he to himself, \"is even more troublesome than I\nbelieved. I foresee fresh difficulties.\"\n\nHe got up and approached the unhappy animal.\n\n\"What have you, poor friend, done to them?\" said he. \"It is on my\naccount they have used you so cruelly.\"\n\nHe embraced the unfortunate beast and kissed the white star on his\nforehead. Then he took him by the bridle and led him, both of them\nlimping, trough the sleeping city to his house, where sleep soon allowed\nthem to forget mankind.\n\n\n\n\nIX. FATHER DOUILLARD\n\nIn their infinite gentleness and at the suggestion of the common father\nof the faithful, the bishops, canons, vicars, curates, abbots, and\nfriars of Penguinia resolved to hold a solemn service in the cathedral\nof Alca, and to pray that Divine mercy would deign to put an end to the\ntroubles that distracted one of the noblest countries in Christendom,\nand grant to repentant Penguinia pardon for its crimes against God and\nthe ministers of religion.\n\nThe ceremony took place on the fifteenth of June. General Caraguel,\nsurrounded by his staff, occupied the churchwarden's pew. The\ncongregation was numerous and brilliant. According to M. Bigourd's\nexpression it was both crowded and select. In the front rank was to be\nseen M. de la Bertheoseille, Chamberlain to his Highness Prince Crucho.\nNear the pulpit, which was to be ascended by the Reverend Father\nDouillard, of the Order of St. Francis, were gathered, in an attitude of\nattention with their hands crossed upon their wands of office, the great\ndignitaries of the Anti-Pyrotist association, Viscount Olive, M. de\nLa Trumelle, Count Clena, the Duke d'Ampoule, and Prince des Boscenos.\nFather Agaric was in the apse with the teachers and pupils of St. Mael\nCollege. The right-hand transept and aisle were reserved for officers\nand soldiers in uniform, this side being thought the more honourable,\nsince the Lord leaned his head to the right when he died on the\nCross. The ladies of the aristocracy, and among them Countess Clena,\nViscountess Olive, and Princess des Boscenos, occupied reserved seats.\nIn the immense building and in the square outside were gathered twenty\nthousand clergy of all sorts, as well as thirty thousand of the laity.\n\nAfter the expiatory and propitiatory ceremony the Reverend Father\nDouillard ascended the pulpit. The sermon had at first been entrusted to\nthe Reverend Father Agaric, but, in spite of his merits, he was thought\nunequal to the occasion in zeal and doctrine, and the eloquent Capuchin\nfriar, who for six months had gone through the barracks preaching\nagainst the enemies of God and authority, had been chosen in his place.\n\nThe Reverend Father Douillard, taking as his text, \"He hath put down the\nmighty from their seat,\" established that all temporal power has God as\nits principle and its end, and that it is ruined and destroyed when it\nturns aside from the path that Providence has traced out for it and from\nthe end to which He has directed it.\n\nApplying these sacred rules to the government of Penguinia, he drew a\nterrible picture of the evils that the country's rulers had been unable\neither to prevent or to foresee.\n\n\"The first author of all these miseries and degradations, my brethren,\"\nsaid he, \"is only too well known to you. He is a monster whose destiny\nis providentially proclaimed by his name, for it is derived from the\nGreek word, pyros, which means fire. Eternal wisdom warns us by this\netymology that a Jew was to set ablaze the country that had welcomed\nhim.\"\n\nHe depicted the country, persecuted by the persecutors of the Church,\nand crying in its agony:\n\n\"O woe! O glory! Those who have crucified my God are crucifying me!\"\n\nAt these words a prolonged shudder passed through the assembly.\n\nThe powerful orator excited still greater indignation when he described\nthe proud and crime-stained Colomban, plunged into the stream, all\nthe waters of which could not cleanse him. He gathered up all the\nhumiliations and all the perils of the Penguins in order to reproach the\nPresident of the Republic and his Prime Minister with them.\n\n\"That Minister,\" said he, \"having been guilty of degrading cowardice\nin not exterminating the seven hundred Pyrotists with their allies and\ndefenders, as Saul exterminated the Philistines at Gibeah, has rendered\nhimself unworthy of exercising the power that God delegated to him,\nand every good citizen ought henceforth to insult his contemptible\ngovernment. Heaven will look favourably on those who despise him.\n'He hath put down the mighty from their seat.' God will depose these\npusillanimous chiefs and will put in their place strong men who\nwill call upon Him. I tell you, gentlemen, I tell you officers,\nnon-commissioned officers, and soldiers who listen to me, I tell you\nGeneral of the Penguin armies, the hour has come! If you do not obey\nGod's orders, if in His name you do not depose those now in authority,\nif you do not establish a religious and strong government in Penguinia,\nGod will none the less destroy what He has condemned, He will none the\nless save His people. He will save them, but, if you are wanting, He\nwill do so by means of a humble artisan or a simple corporal. Hasten!\nThe hour will soon be past.\"\n\nExcited by this ardent exhortation, the sixty thousand people present\nrose up trembling and shouting: \"To arms! To arms! Death to the\nPyrotists! Hurrah for Crucho!\" and all of them, monks, women, soldiers,\nnoblemen, citizens, and loafers, who were gathered beneath the\nsuperhuman arm uplifted in the pulpit, struck up the hymn, \"Let us save\nPenguinia!\" They rushed impetuously from the basilica and marched along\nthe quays to the Chamber of Deputies.\n\nLeft alone in the deserted nave, the wise Cornemuse, lifting his arms to\nheaven, murmured in broken accents:\n\n\"Agnosco fortunam ecclesiae penguicanae! I see but too well whither this\nwill lead us.\"\n\nThe attack which the crowd made upon the legislative palace was\nrepulsed. Vigorously charged by the police and Alcan guards, the\nassailants were already fleeing in disorder, when the Socialists,\nrunning from the slums and led by comrades Phoenix, Dagobert,\nLapersonne, and Varambille, threw themselves upon them and completed\ntheir discomfiture. MM. de La Trumelle and d'Ampoule were taken to the\npolice station. Prince des Boscenos, after a valiant struggle, fell upon\nthe bloody pavement with a fractured skull.\n\nIn the enthusiasm of victory, the comrades, mingled with an innumerable\ncrowd of paper-sellers and gutter-merchants, ran through the boulevards\nall night, carrying, Maniflore in triumph, and breaking the mirrors of\nthe cafes and the glasses of the street lamps amid cries of \"Down with\nCrucho! Hurrah for the Social Revolution!\" The Anti-Pyrotists in their\nturn upset the newspaper kiosks and tore down the hoardings.\n\nThese were spectacles of which cool reason cannot approve and they\nwere fit causes for grief to the municipal authorities, who desired to\npreserve the good order of the roads and streets. But, what was sadder\nfor a man of heart was the sight or the canting humbugs, who, from\nfear of blows, kept at an equal distance from the two camps, and who,\nalthough they allowed their selfishness and cowardice to be visible,\nclaimed admiration for the generosity of their sentiments and the\nnobility of their souls. They rubbed their eyes with onions, gaped like\nwhitings, blew violently into their handkerchiefs, and, bringing their\nvoices out of the depths of their stomachs, groaned forth: \"O Penguins,\ncease these fratricidal struggles; cease to rend your mother's bosom!\"\nAs if men could live in society without disputes and without quarrels,\nand as if civil discords were not the necessary conditions of national\nlife and progress. They showed themselves hypocritical cowards by\nproposing a compromise between the just and the unjust, offending\nthe just in his rectitude and the unjust in his courage. One of these\ncreatures, the rich and powerful Machimel, a champion coward, rose upon\nthe town like a colossus of grief; his tears formed poisonous lakes at\nhis feet and his sighs capsized the boats of the fishermen.\n\nDuring these stormy nights Bidault-Coquille at the top of his old\nsteam-engine, under the serene sky, boasted in his heart, while the\nshooting stars registered themselves upon his photographic plates. He\nwas fighting for justice. He loved and was loved with a sublime passion.\nInsult and calumny raised him to the clouds. A caricature of him in\ncompany with those of Colomban, Kerdanic, and Colonel Hastaing was to be\nseen in the newspaper kiosks. The Anti-Pyrotists proclaimed that he\nhad received fifty thousand francs from the big Jewish financiers.\nThe reporters of the militarist sheets held interviews regarding his\nscientific knowledge with official scholars, who declared he had no\nknowledge of the stars, disputed his most solid observations, denied\nhis most certain discoveries, and condemned his most ingenious and most\nfruitful hypotheses. He exulted under these flattering blows of hatred\nand envy.\n\nHe contemplated the black immensity pierced by a multitude of lights,\nwithout giving a thought to all the heavy slumbers, cruel insomnias,\nvain dreams, spoilt pleasures, and infinitely diverse miseries that a\ngreat city contains.\n\n\"It is in this enormous city,\" said he to himself, \"that the just and\nthe unjust are joining battle.\"\n\nAnd substituting a simple and magnificent poetry for the multiple and\nvulgar reality, he represented to himself the Pyrot affair as a struggle\nbetween good and bad angels. He awaited the eternal triumph of the\nSons of Light and congratulated himself on being a Child of the Day\nconfounding the Children of Night.\n\n\n\n\nX. MR. JUSTICE CHAUSSEPIED\n\nHitherto blinded by fear, incautious and stupid before the bands of\nFriar Douillard and the partisans of Prince Crucho, the Republicans at\nlast opened their eyes and grasped the real meaning of the Pyrot affair.\nThe deputies who had for two years turned pale at the shouts of the\npatriotic crowds became, not indeed more courageous, but altered their\ncowardice and blamed Robin Mielleux for disorders which their own\ncompliance had encouraged, and the instigators of which they had several\ntimes slavishly congratulated. They reproached him for having imperilled\nthe Republic by a weakness which was really theirs and a timidity\nwhich they themselves had imposed upon him. Some of them began to doubt\nwhether it was not to their interest to believe in Pyrot's innocence\nrather than in his guilt, and thenceforward they felt a bitter anguish\nat the thought that the unhappy man might have been wrongly convicted\nand that in his aerial cage he might be expiating another man's crimes.\n\"I cannot sleep on account of it!\" was what several members of Minister\nGuillaumette's majority used to say. But these were ambitious to replace\ntheir chief.\n\nThese generous legislators overthrew the cabinet, and the President of\nthe Republic put in Robin Mielleux's place, a patriarchal Republican\nwith a flowing beard, La Trinite by name, who, like most of the\nPenguins, understood nothing about the affair, but thought that too many\nmonks were mixed up in it.\n\nGeneral Greatauk before leaving the Ministry of War, gave his final\nadvice to Pariler, the Chief of the Staff.\n\n\"I go and you remain,\" said he, as he shook hands with him. \"The Pyrot\naffair is my daughter; I confide her to you, she is worthy of your love\nand your care; she is beautiful. Do not forget that her beauty loves\nthe shade, is leased with mystery, and likes to remain veiled. Great her\nmodesty with gentleness. Too many indiscreet looks have already profaned\nher charms. . . . Panther, you desired proofs and you obtained them. You\nhave many, perhaps too many, in your possession. I see that there will\nbe many tiresome interventions and much dangerous curiosity. If I were\nin your place I would tear up all those documents. Believe me, the best\nof proofs is none at all. That is the only one which nobody discusses.\"\n\nAlas! General Panther did not realise the wisdom of this advice. The\nfuture was only too thoroughly to justify Greatauk's perspicacity. La\nTrinite demanded the documents belonging, to the Pyrot affair. Peniche,\nhis Minister of War, refused them in the superior interests of the\nnational defence, telling him that the documents under General Panther's\ncare formed the hugest mass of archives in the world. La Trinite studied\nthe case as well as he could, and, without penetrating to the bottom of\nthe matter, suspected it of irregularity. Conformably to his rights\nand prerogatives he then ordered a fresh trial to be held. Immediately,\nPeniche, his Minister of War, accused him of insulting the army and\nbetraying the country and flung his portfolio at his head. He was\nreplaced by a second, who did the same. To him succeeded a third, who\nimitated these examples, and those after him to the number of seventy\nacted like their predecessors, until the venerable La Trinite groaned\nbeneath the weight of bellicose portfolios. The seventy-first Minister\nof War, van Julep, retained office. Not that he was in disagreement with\nso many and such noble colleagues, but he had been commissioned by them\ngenerously to betray his Prime Minister, to cover him with shame and\nopprobrium, and to convert the new trial to the glory of Greatauk, the\nsatisfaction of the Anti-Pyrotists, the profit of the monks, and the\nrestoration of Prince Crucho.\n\nGeneral van Julep, though endowed with high military virtues, was not\nintelligent enough to employ the subtle conduct and exquisite methods of\nGreatauk. He thought, like General Panther, that tangible proofs against\nPyrot were necessary, that they could never ave too many of them, that\nthey could never have even enough. He expressed these' sentiments to his\nChief of Staff, who was only too inclined to agree with them.\n\n\"Panther,\" said he, \"we are at the moment when we need abundant and\nsuperabundant proofs.\"\n\n\"You have said enough, General,\" answered Panther, \"I will complete my\npiles of documents.\"\n\nSix months later the proofs against Pyrot filled two storeys of the\nMinistry of War. The ceiling fell in beneath the weight of the bundles,\nand the avalanche of falling documents crushed two head clerks, fourteen\nsecond clerks, and sixty copying clerks, who were at work upon the\nground floor arranging a change in the fashion of the cavalry gaiters.\nThe walls of the huge edifice had to be propped. Passers-by saw\nwith amazement enormous beams and monstrous stanchions which reared\nthemselves obliquely against the noble front of the building, now\ntottering and disjointed, and blocked up the streets, stopped the\ncarriages, and presented to the motor-omnibuses an obstacle against\nwhich they dashed with their loads of passengers.\n\nThe judges who had condemned Pyrot were not, properly speaking, judges\nbut soldiers. The judges who had condemned Colomban were real judges,\nbut of inferior rank, wearing seedy black clothes like church vergers,\nunlucky wretches of judges, miserable judgelings. Above them were the\nsuperior judges who wore ermine robes over their black gowns. These,\nrenowned for their knowledge and doctrine, formed a court whose terrible\nname expressed power. It was called the Court of Appeal (Cassation) so\nas to make it clear that it was the hammer suspended over the judgments\nand decrees of all other jurisdictions.\n\nOne of these superior red Judges of the Supreme Court, called\nChaussepied, led a modest and tranquil life in a suburb of Alca. His\nsoul was pure, his heart honest, his spirit just. When he had finished\nstudying his documents he used to play the violin and cultivate\nhyacinths. Every Sunday he dined with his neighbours the Mesdemoiselles\nHelbivore. His old age was cheerful and robust and his friends often\npraised the amenity of his character.\n\nFor some months, however, he had been irritable and touchy, and when he\nopened a newspaper his broad and ruddy face would become covered with\ndolorous wrinkles and darkened with an angry purple. Pyrot was the cause\nof it. Justice Chaussepied could not understand how an officer could\nhave committed so black a crime as to hand over eighty thousand trusses\nof military hay to a neighbouring and hostile Power. And he could still\nless conceive how a scoundrel should have found official defenders in\nPenguinia. The thought that there existed in his country a Pyrot,\na Colonel Hastaing, a Colomban, a Kerdanic, a Phoenix, spoilt his\nhyacinths, his violin, his heaven, and his earth, all nature, and even\nhis dinner with the Mesdemoiselles Helbivore!\n\nIn the mean time the Pyrot case, having been presented to the Supreme\nCourt by the Keeper of Seals, it fell to Chaussepied to examine it and\ncover its defects, in case any existed. Although as upright and honest\nas a man can be, and trained by long habit to exercise his magistracy\nwithout fear or favour, he expected to find in the documents he\nsubmitted to him proofs of certain guilt and obvious criminality. After\nlengthened difficulties and repeated refusals on the part of General\nJulep, Justice Chaussepied was allowed to examine the documents.\nNumbered and initialed they ran to the number of fourteen millions six\nhundred and twenty-six thousand three hundred and twelve. As he studied\nthem the judge was at first surprised, then astonished, then stupefied,\namazed, and, if I dare say so, flabbergasted. He found among the\ndocuments prospectuses of new fancy shops, newspapers, fashion-plates,\npaper bags, old business letters, exercise books, brown paper, green\npaper for rubbing parquet floors, playing cards, diagrams, six thousand\ncopies of the \"Key to Dreams,\" but not a single document in which any\nmention was made of Pyrot.\n\n\n\n\nXI. CONCLUSION\n\nThe appeal was allowed, and Pyrot was brought down from his cage. But\nthe Anti-Pyrotists did not regard themselves as beaten. The military\njudges re-tried Pyrot. Greatauk, in this second affair, surpassed\nhimself. He obtained a second conviction; he obtained it by declaring\nthat the proofs communicated to the Supreme Court were worth nothing,\nand that great care had been taken to keep back the good ones, since\nthey ought to remain secret. In the opinion of connoisseurs he had never\nshown so much address. On leaving the court, as he passed through the\nvestibule with a tranquil step, and his hands behind his back, amidst a\ncrowd of sight-seers, a woman dressed in red and with her face covered\nby a black veil rushed at him, brandishing a kitchen knife.\n\n\"Die, scoundrel!\" she cried. It was Maniflore. Before those present\ncould understand what was happening, the general seized her by the\nwrist, and with apparent gentleness, squeezed it so forcibly that the\nknife fell from her aching hand.\n\nThen he picked it up and handed it to Maniflore.\n\n\"Madam,\" said he with a bow, \"you have dropped a household utensil.\"\n\nHe could not prevent the heroine from being taken to the police-station;\nbut he had her immediately released and afterwards he employed all his\ninfluence to stop the prosecution.\n\nThe second conviction of Pyrot was Greatauk's last victory.\n\nJustice Chaussepied, who had formerly liked soldiers so much, and\nesteemed their justice so highly, being now enraged with the\nmilitary judges, quashed their judgments as a monkey cracks nuts.\nHe rehabilitated Pyrot a second time; he would, if necessary, have\nrehabilitated him five hundred times.\n\nFurious at having been cowards and at having allowed themselves to be\ndeceived and made game of, the Republicans turned against the monks\nand clergy. The deputies passed laws of expulsion, separation, and\nspoliation against them. What Father Cornemuse had foreseen took place.\nThat good monk was driven from the Wood of Conils. Treasury officers\nconfiscated his retorts and his stills, and the liquidators divided\namongst them his bottles of St. Oberosian liqueur. The pious distiller\nlost the annual income of three million five hundred thousand francs\nthat his products procured for him. Father Agaric went into exile,\nabandoning his school into the hands of laymen, who soon allowed it to\nfall into decay. Separated from its foster-mother, the State, the Church\nof Penguinia withered like a plucked flower.\n\nThe victorious defenders of the innocent man now abused each other and\noverwhelmed each other reciprocally with insults and calumnies. The\nvehement Kerdanic hurled himself upon Phoenix as if ready to devour\nhim. The wealthy Jews and the seven hundred Pyrotists turned away with\ndisdain from the socialist comrades whose aid they had humbly implored\nin the past.\n\n\"We know you no longer,\" said they. \"To the devil with you and your\nsocial justice. Social justice is the defence of property.\"\n\nHaving been elected a Deputy and chosen to be the leader of the new\nmajority, comrade Larrivee was appointed by the Chamber and public\nopinion to the Premiership. He showed himself an energetic defender\nof the military tribunals that had condemned Pyrot. When his former\nsocialist comrades claimed a little more justice and liberty for the\nemployes of the State as well as for manual workers, he opposed their\nproposals in an eloquent speech.\n\n\"Liberty,\" said he, \"is not licence. Between order and disorder my\nchoice is made: revolution is impotence. Progress has no more formidable\nenemy than violence. Gentlemen, those who, as I am, are anxious for\nreform, ought to apply themselves before everything else to cure this\nagitation which enfeebles government just as fever exhausts those who\nare ill. It is time to reassure honest people.\"\n\nThis speech was received with applause. The government of the Republic\nremained in subjection to the great financial companies, the army was\nexclusively devoted to the defence of capital, while the fleet was\ndesigned solely to procure fresh orders for the mine-owners. Since the\nrich refused to pay their just share of the taxes, the poor, as in the\npast, paid for them.\n\nIn the mean time from the height of his old steamline, beneath the\ncrowded stars of night, Bidault-Coquille gazed sadly at the sleeping\ncity. Maniflore had left him. Consumed with a desire for fresh devotions\nand fresh sacrifices, she had gone in company with a young Bulgarian\nto bear justice and vengeance to Sofia. He did not regret her, having\nperceived after the Affair, that she was less beautiful in form and in\nthought than he had at first imagined. His impressions had been modified\nin the same direction concerning many other forms and many other\nthoughts. And what was cruelest of all to him, he regarded himself as\nnot so great, not so splendid, as he had believed.\n\nAnd he reflected:\n\n\"You considered yourself sublime when you had but candour and good-will.\nOf what were you proud, Bidault-Coquille? Of having been one of the\nfirst to know that Pyrot was innocent and Greatauk a scoundrel. But\nthree-fourths of those who defended Greatauk against the attacks of the\nseven hundred Pyrotists knew that better than you. Of what then did you\nshow yourself so proud? Of having dared to say what you thought? That\nis civic courage, and, like military courage, it is a mere result of\nimprudence. You have been imprudent. So far so good, but that is\nno reason for praising yourself beyond measure. Your imprudence was\ntrifling; it exposed you to trifling perils; you did not risk your head\nby it. The Penguins have lost that cruel and sanguinary pride which\nformerly gave a tragic grandeur to their revolutions; it is the fatal\nresult of the weakening of beliefs and character. Ought one to look\nupon oneself as a superior spirit for having shown a little more\nclear-sightedness than the vulgar? I am very much afraid, on the\ncontrary, Bidault-Coquille, that you have given proof of a gross\nmisunderstanding of the conditions of the moral and intellectual\ndevelopment of a people. You imagined that social injustices were\nthreaded together like pearls and that it would be enough to pull off\none in order to unfasten the whole necklace. That is a very ingenuous\nconception. You flattered yourself that at one stroke you were\nestablishing justice in your own country and in the universe. You were\na brave man, an honest idealist, though without much experimental\nphilosophy. But go home to your own heart and you will recognise that\nyou had in you a spice of malice and that our ingenuousness was not\nwithout cunning. You believed you were performing a fine moral action.\nYou said to yourself: 'Here am I, just and courageous once for all.\nI can henceforth repose in the public esteem and the praise of\nhistorians.' And now that you have lost your illusions, now that you\nknow how hard it is to redress wrongs, and that the task must ever be\nbegun afresh, you are going back to your asteroids. You are right; but\ngo back to them with modesty, Bidault-Coquille!\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBOOK VII. MODERN TIMES\n\n\nMADAME CERES\n\n\"Only extreme things are tolerable.\" Count Robert de Montesquiou.\n\n\n\n\n\nI. MADAME CLARENCE'S DRAWING-ROOM\n\nMadame Clarence, the widow of an exalted functionary of the Republic,\nloved to entertain. Every Thursday she collected together some friends\nof modest condition who took pleasure in conversation. The ladies who\nwent to see her, very different in age and rank, were all without\nmoney, and had all suffered much. There was a duchess who looked like\na fortune-teller and a fortune-teller who looked like a duchess. Madame\nClarence was pretty enough to maintain some old liaisons, but not to\nform new ones, and she generally inspired a quiet esteem. She had a very\npretty daughter, who, since she had no dower, caused some alarm among\nthe male guests; for the Penguins were as much afraid of portionless\ngirls as they were of the devil himself. Eveline Clarence, noticing\ntheir reserve and perceiving its cause, used to hand them their tea\nwith an air of disdain. Moreover, she seldom appeared at the parties\nand talked only to the ladies or the very young people. Her discreet and\nretiring presence put no restraint upon the conversation, since those\nwho took part in it thought either that as she was a young girl she\nwould not understand it, or that, being twenty-five years old, she might\nlisten to everything.\n\nOne Thursday therefore, in Madame Clarence's drawing-room, the\nconversation turned upon love. The ladies spoke of it with pride,\ndelicacy, and mystery, the men with discretion and fatuity; everyone\ntook an interest in the conversation, for each one was interested in\nwhat he or she said. A great deal of wit flowed; brilliant apostrophes\nwere launched forth and keen repartees were returned. But when Professor\nHaddi began to speak he overwhelmed everybody.\n\n\"It is the same with our ideas on love as with our ideas on everything\nelse,\" said he, \"they rest upon anterior habits whose very memory has\nbeen effaced. In morals, the limitations that have lost their grounds\nfor existing, the most useless obligations, the cruelest and most\ninjurious restraints, are because of their profound antiquity and the\nmystery of their origin, the least disputed and the least disputable as\nwell as the most respected, and they are those that cannot be violated\nwithout incurring the most severe blame. All morality relative to the\nrelations of the sexes is founded on this principle: that a woman once\nobtained belongs to the man, that she is his property like his horse or\nhis weapons. And this having ceased to be true, absurdities result from\nit, such as the marriage or contract of sale of a woman to a man, with\nclauses restricting the right of ownership introduced as a consequence\nof the gradual diminution of the claims of the possessor.\n\n\"The obligation imposed on a girl that she should bring her virginity\nto her husband comes from the times when girls were married immediately\nthey were of a marriageable age. It is ridiculous that a girl who\nmarries at twenty-five or thirty should be subject to that obligation.\nYou will, perhaps, say that it is a present with which her husband, if\nshe gets one at last, will be gratified; but every moment we see men\nwooing married women and showing themselves perfectly satisfied to take\nthem as they find them.\n\n\"Still, even in our own day, the duty of girls is determined in\nreligious morality by the old belief that God, the most powerful of\nwarriors, is polygamous, that he has reserved all maidens for himself,\nand that men can only take those whom he has left. This belief, although\ntraces of it exist in several metaphors of mysticism, is abandoned\nto-day, by most civilised peoples. However, it still dominates the\neducation of girls not only among our believers, but even among our\nfree-thinkers, who, as a rule, think freely for the reason that they do\nnot think at all.\n\n\"Discretion means ability to separate and discern. We say that a girl is\ndiscreet when she knows nothing at all. We cultivate her ignorance. In\nspite of all our care the most discreet know something, for we cannot\nconceal from them their own nature and their own sensations. But they\nknow badly, they know in a wrong way. That is all we obtain by our\ncareful education. . . .\"\n\n\"Sir,\" suddenly said Joseph Boutourle, the High Treasurer of Alca,\n\"believe me, there are innocent girls, perfectly innocent girls, and it\nis a great pity. I have known three. They married, and the result was\ntragical.\"\n\n\"I have noticed,\" Professor Haddock went on, \"that Europeans in general\nand Penguins in particular occupy themselves, after sport and motoring,\nwith nothing so much as with love. It is giving a great deal of\nimportance to a matter that has very little weight.\"\n\n\"Then, Professor,\" exclaimed Madame Cremeur in a choking voice, \"when\na woman has completely surrendered herself to you, you think it is a\nmatter of no importance?\"\n\n\"No, Madame; it can have its importance,\" answered Professor Haddock,\n\"but it is necessary to examine if when she surrenders herself to us she\noffers us a delicious fruit-garden or a plot of thistles and dandelions.\nAnd then, do we not misuse words? In love, a woman lends herself rather\nthan gives herself. Look at the pretty Madame Pensee. . . .\"\n\n\"She is my mother,\" said a tall, fair young man.\n\n\"Sir, I have the greatest respect for her,\" replied Professor Haddock;\n\"do not be afraid that I intend to say anything in the least offensive\nabout her. But allow me to tell you that, as a rule, the opinions of\nsons about their mothers are not to be relied on. They do not bear\nenough in mind that a mother is a mother only because she loved, and\nthat she can still love. That, however, is the case, and it would be\ndeplorable were it otherwise. I have noticed, on the contrary, that\ndaughters do not deceive themselves about their mothers' faculty for\nloving or about the use they make of it; they are rivals; they have\ntheir eyes upon them.\"\n\nThe insupportable Professor spoke a great deal longer, adding\nindecorum to awkwardness, and impertinence to incivility, accumulating\nincongruities, despising what is respectable, respecting what is\ndespicable; but no one listened to him further.\n\nDuring this time in a room that was simple without grace, a room sad\nfor the want of love, a room which, like all young girls' rooms, had\nsomething of the cold atmosphere of a place of waiting about it, Eveline\nClarence turned over the pages of club annuals and prospectuses of\ncharities in order to obtain from them some acquaintance with society.\nBeing convinced that her mother, shut up in her own intellectual but\npoor world, could neither bring her out or push her into prominence, she\ndecided that she herself would seek the best means of winning a husband.\nAt once calm and obstinate, without dreams or illusions, and regarding\nmarriage as but a ticket of admission or a passport, she kept before\nher mind a clear notion of the hazards, difficulties, and chances of her\nenterprise. She had the art of pleasing and a coldness of temperament\nthat enabled her to turn it to its fullest advantage. Her weakness lay\nin the fact that she was dazzled by anything that had an aristocratic\nair.\n\nWhen she was alone with her mother she said:\n\n\"Mamma, we will go to-morrow to Father Douillard's retreat.\"\n\n\n\n\nII. THE CHARITY OF ST. ORBEROSIA\n\nEvery Friday evening at nine o'clock the choicest of Alcan society\nassembled in the aristocratic church of St. Mael for the Reverend Father\nDouillard's retreat. Prince and Princess des Boscenos, Viscount and\nViscountess Olive, M. and Madame Bigourd, Monsieur and Madame de La\nTrumelle were never absent. The flower of the aristocracy might be seen\nthere, and fair Jewish baronesses also adorned it by their presence, for\nthe Jewish baronesses of Alca were Christians.\n\nThis retreat, like all religious retreats, had for its object to procure\nfor those living in the world opportunities for recollection so that\nthey might think of their eternal salvation. It was also intended to\ndraw down upon so man noble and illustrious families the benediction\nof L. Orberosia, who loves the Penguins. The Reverend Father Douillard\nstrove for the completion of his task with a truly apostolical zeal. He\nhoped to restore the prerogatives of St. Orberosia as the patron saint\nof Penguinia and to dedicate to her a monumental church on one of the\nhills that dominate the city. His efforts had been crowned with great\nsuccess, and for the accomplishing of this national enterprise he had\nalready united more than a hundred thousand adherents and collected more\nthan twenty millions of francs.\n\nIt was in the choir of St. Mael's that St. Orberosia's new shrine,\nshining with gold, sparkling with precious stones, and surrounded by\ntapers and flowers, had been erected.\n\nThe following account may be read in the \"History of the Miracles of the\nPatron Saint of Alca\" by the Abbe Plantain:\n\n\"The ancient shrine had been melted down during the Terror and the\nprecious relics of the saint thrown into a fire that had been lit on the\nPlace de Greve; but a poor woman of great piety, named Rouquin, went by\nnight at the peril of her life to gather up the calcined bones and the\nashes of the blessed saint. She preserved them in a jam-pot, and when\nreligion was again restored, brought them to the venerable Cure of\nSt. Maels. The woman ended her days piously as a vendor of tapers and\ncustodian of seats in the saint's chapel.\"\n\nIt is certain that in the time of Father Douillard, although faith was\ndeclining, the cult of St. Orberosia, which for three hundred years had\nfallen under the criticism of Canon Princeteau and the silence of the\nDoctors of the Church, recovered, and was surrounded with more pomp,\nmore splendour, and more fervour than ever. The theologians did not\nnow subtract a single iota from the legend. They held as certainly\nestablished all the facts related by Abbot Simplicissimus, and in\nparticular declared, on the testimony of that monk, that the devil,\nassuming a monk's form had carried off the saint to a cave and had there\nstriven with her until she overcame him. Neither places nor dates caused\nthem any embarrassment. They paid no heed to exegesis and took good\ncare not to grant as much to science as Canon Princeteau had formerly\nconceded. They knew too well whither that would lead.\n\nThe church shone with lights and flowers. An operatic tenor sang the\nfamous canticle of St. Orberosia:\n\n     Virgin of Paradise\n     Come, come in the dusky night\n     And on us shed\n     Thy beams of light.\n\nMademoiselle Clarence sat beside her mother and in front of Viscount\nClena. She remained kneeling during a considerable time, for the\nattitude of prayer is natural to discreet virgins and it shows off their\nfigures.\n\nThe Reverend Father Douillard ascended the pulpit. He was a powerful\norator and could, at once melt, surprise, and rouse his hearers. Women\ncomplained only that he fulminated against vice with excessive harshness\nand in crude terms that made them blush. But they liked him none the\nless for it.\n\nHe treated in his sermon of the seventh trial of St. Orberosia, who was\ntempted by the dragon which she went forth to combat. But she did not\nyield, and she disarmed the monster. The orator demonstrated without\ndifficulty that we, also, by the aid of St. Orberosia, and strong in the\nvirtue which she inspires, can in our turn overthrow the dragons that\ndart upon us and are waiting to devour us, the dragon of doubt, the\ndragon of impiety, the dragon of forgetfulness of religious duties.\nHe proved that the charity of St. Orberosia was a work of social\nregeneration, and he concluded by an ardent appeal to the faithful \"to\nbecome instruments of the Divine mercy, eager upholders and supporters\nof the charity of St. Orberosia, and to furnish it with all the means\nwhich it required to take its flight and bear its salutary fruits.\" *\n\n     * Cf. J. Ernest Charles in the \"Censeur,\" May-August, 1907,\n     p. 562, col. 2.\n\nAfter the ceremony, the Reverend Father Douillard remained in\nthe sacristy at the disposal of those of the faithful who desired\ninformation concerning the charity, or who wished to bring their\ncontributions. Mademoiselle Clarence wished to speak to Father\nDouillard, so did Viscount Clena. The crowd was large, and a queue was\nformed. By chance Viscount Clena and Mademoiselle Clarence were side by\nside and possibly they were squeezed a little closely to each other\nby the crowd. Eveline had noticed this fashionable young man, who was\nalmost as well known as his father in the world of sport. Clena had\nnoticed her, and, as he thought her pretty, he bowed to her, then\napologised and pretended to believe that he had been introduced to the\nladies, but could not remember where. They pretended to believe it also.\n\nHe presented himself the following week at Madame Clarence's, thinking\nthat her house was a bit fast--a thing not likely to displease him--and\nwhen he saw Eveline again he felt he had not been mistaken and that she\nwas an extremely pretty girl.\n\nViscount Clena had the finest motor-car in Europe. For three months he\ndrove the Clarences every day over hills and plains, through woods and\nvalleys; they visited famous sites and went over celebrated castles. He\nsaid to Eveline all that could be said and did all that could be done\nto overcome her resistance. She did not conceal from him that she\nloved him, that she would always love him, and love no one but him. She\nremained grave and trembling by his side. To his devouring passion she\nopposed the invincible defence of a virtue conscious of its danger. At\nthe end of three months, after having gone uphill and down hill,\nturned sharp corners, and negotiated level crossings, and experienced\ninnumerable break-downs, he knew her as well as he knew the fly-wheel of\nhis car, but not much better. He employed surprises, adventures,\nsudden stoppages in the depths of forests and before hotels, but he had\nadvanced no farther. He said to himself that it was absurd; then, taking\nher again in his car he set off at fifty miles an hour quite prepared to\nupset her in a ditch or to smash himself and her against a tree.\n\nOne day, having come to take her on some excursion, he found her more\ncharming than ever, and more provoking. He darted upon her as a storm\nfalls upon the reeds that border a lake. She bent with adorable weakness\nbeneath the breath of the storm, and twenty times was almost carried\naway by its strength, but twenty times she arose, supple and, bowing to\nthe wind. After all these shocks one would have said that a light breeze\nhad barely touched her charming stem; she smiled as if ready to be\nplucked by a bold hand. Then her unhappy aggressor, desperate, enraged,\nand three parts mad, fled so as not to kill her, mistook the door, went\ninto the bedroom of Madame Clarence, whom he found putting on her hat in\nfront of a wardrobe, seized her, flung her on the bed, and possessed her\nbefore she knew what had happened.\n\nThe same day Eveline, who had been making inquiries, learned that\nViscount Clena had nothing but debts, lived on money given him by an\nelderly lady, and promoted the sale of the latest models of a motor-car\nmanufacturer. They separated with common accord and Eveline began again\ndisdainfully to serve tea to her mother's guests.\n\n\n\n\nIII. HIPPOLYTE CERES\n\nIn Madame Clarence's drawing-room the conversation turned upon love, and\nmany charming things were said about it.\n\n\"Love is a sacrifice,\" sighed Madame Cremeur.\n\n\"I agree with you,\" replied M. Boutourle with animation.\n\nBut Professor Haddock soon displayed his fastidious insolence.\n\n\"It seems to me,\" said he, \"that the Penguin ladies have made a great\nfuss since, through St. Mael's agency, they became viviparous. But there\nis nothing to be particularly proud of in that, for it is a state they\nshare in common with cows and pigs, and even with orange and lemon\ntrees, for the seeds of these plants germinate in the pericarp.\"\n\n\"The self-importance which the Penguin ladies give themselves does not\ngo so far back as that,\" answered M. Boutourle. \"It dates from the day\nwhen the holy apostle gave them clothes. But this self-importance was\nlong kept in restraint, and displayed itself fully only with increased\nluxury of dress and in a small section of society. For go only two\nleagues from Alca into the country at harvest time, and you will see\nwhether women are over-precise or self-important.\"\n\nOn that day M. Hippolyte Ceres paid his first call. He was a Deputy of\nAlca, and one of the youngest members of the House. His father was\nsaid to have kept a dram shop, but he himself was a lawyer of robust\nphysique, a good though prolix speaker, with a self-important air and a\nreputation for ability.\n\n\"M. Ceres,\" said the mistress of the house, \"your constituency is one of\nthe finest in Alca.\"\n\n\"And there are fresh improvements made in it every day, Madame.\"\n\n\"Unfortunately, it is impossible to take a stroll through it any\nlonger,\" said M. Boutourle.\n\n\"Why?\" asked M. Ceres.\n\n\"On account of the motors, of course.\"\n\n\"Do not give them a bad name,\" answered the Deputy. \"They are our great\nnational industry.\"\n\n\"I know. The Penguins of to-day make me think of the ancient Egyptians.\nAccording to Clement of Alexandria, Taine tells us--though he misquotes\nthe text--the Egyptians worshipped the crocodiles that devoured them.\nThe Penguins to-day worship the motors that crush them. Without a doubt\nthe future belongs to the metal beast. We are no more likely to go back\nto cabs than we are to go back to the diligence. And the long martyrdom\nof the horse will come to an end. The motor, which the frenzied cupidity\nof manufacturers hurls like a juggernaut's car upon the bewildered\npeople and of which the idle and fashionable make a foolish though fatal\nelegance, will soon begin to perform its true function, and putting its\nstrength at the service of the entire people, will behave like a docile,\ntoiling monster. But in order that the motor may cease to be injurious\nand become beneficent we must build roads suited to its speed, roads\nwhich it cannot tear up with its ferocious tyres, and from which it will\nsend no clouds of poisonous dust into human lungs. We ought not to allow\nslower vehicles or mere animals to go upon those roads, and we should\nestablish garages upon them and foot-bridges over them, and so create\norder and harmony among the means of communication of the future. That\nis the wish of every good citizen.\"\n\nMadame Clarence led the conversation back to the improvements in M.\nCeres' constituency. M. Ceres showed his enthusiasm for demolitions,\ntunnelings, constructions, reconstructions, and all other fruitful\noperations.\n\n\"We build to-day in an admirable style,\" said he; \"everywhere majestic\navenues are being reared. Was ever anything as fine as our arcaded\nbridges and our domed hotels!\"\n\n\"You are forgetting that big palace surmounted an immense melon-shaped\ndome,\" grumbled by M. Daniset, an old art amateur, in a voice of\nrestrained rage. \"I am amazed at the degree of ugliness which a modern\ncity can attain. Alca is becoming Americanised. Everywhere we are\ndestroying all that is free, unexpected, measured, restrained, human,\nor traditional among the things that are left us. Everywhere we are\ndestroying that charming object, a piece of an old wall that bears up\nthe branches of a tree. Everywhere we are suppressing some fragment\nof light and air, some fragment of nature, some fragment of the\nassociations that still remain with us, some fragment of our fathers,\nsome fragment of ourselves. And we are putting up frightful, enormous,\ninfamous houses, surmounted in Viennese style by ridiculous domes, or\nfashioned after the models of the 'new art' without mouldings, or\nhaving profiles with sinister corbels and burlesque pinnacles, and such\nmonsters as these shamelessly peer over the surrounding buildings. We\nsee bulbous protuberances stuck on the fronts of buildings and we are\ntold they are 'new art' motives. I have seen the 'new art' in other\ncountries, but it is not so ugly as with us; it has fancy and it has\nsimplicity. It is only in our own country that by a sad privilege we may\nbehold the newest and most diverse styles of architectural ugliness. Not\nan enviable privilege!\"\n\n\"Are you not afraid,\" asked M. Ceres severely, \"are you not afraid that\nthese bitter criticisms tend to keep out of our capital the foreigners\nwho flow into it from all arts of the world and who leave millions\nbehind them?\"\n\n\"You may set your mind at rest about that,\" answered M. Daniset.\n\"Foreigners do not come to admire our buildings; they come to see our\ncourtesans, our dressmakers, and our dancing saloons.\"\n\n\"We have one bad habit,\" sighed M. Ceres, \"it is that we calumniate\nourselves.\"\n\nMadame Clarence as an accomplished hostess thought it was time to return\nto the subject of love and asked M. Jumel his opinion of M. Leon Blum's\nrecent book in which the author complained. . . .\n\n\". . . That an irrational custom,\" went on Professor Haddock, \"prevents\nrespectable young ladies from making love, a thing they would enjoy\ndoing, whilst mercenary girls do it too much and without getting any\nenjoyment out of it. It is indeed deplorable. But M. Leon Blum need\nnot fret too much. If the evil exists, as he says it does, in our\nmiddle-class society, I can assure him that everywhere else he would see\na consoling spectacle. Among the people, the mass of the people through\ntown and country, girls do not deny themselves that pleasure.\"\n\n\"It is depravity!\" said Madame Cremeur.\n\nAnd she praised the innocence of young girls in terms full of modesty\nand grace. It was charming to hear her.\n\nProfessor Haddock's views on the same subject were, on the contrary,\npainful to listen to.\n\n\"Respectable young girls,\" said he, \"are guarded and watched over.\nBesides, men do not, as a rule, pursue them much, either through\nprobity, or from a fear of grave responsibilities, or because the\nseduction of a young girl would not be to their credit. Even then we do\nnot know what really takes place, for the reason that what is hidden is\nnot seen. This is a condition necessary to the existence of all society.\nThe scruples of respectable young girls could be more easily overcome\nthan those of married women if the same pressure were brought to bear on\nthem, and for this there are two reasons: they have more illusions, and\ntheir curiosity has not been satisfied. Women, for the most part, have\nbeen so disappointed by their husbands that they have not courage\nenough to begin again with somebody else. I myself have been met by this\nobstacle several times in my attempts at seduction.\"\n\nAt the moment when Professor Haddock ended his unpleasant remarks,\nMademoiselle Eveline Clarence entered the drawing-room and listlessly\nhanded about tea with that expression of boredom which gave an oriental\ncharm to her beauty.\n\n\"For my part,\" said Hippolyte Ceres, looking at her, \"I declare myself\nthe young ladies' champion.\"\n\n\"He must be a fool,\" thought the girl.\n\nHippolyte Ceres, who had never set foot outside of his political world\nof electors and elected, thought Madame Clarence's drawing-room most\nselect, its mistress exquisite, and her daughter amazingly beautiful.\nHis visits became frequent and he paid court to both of them. Madame\nClarence, who now liked attention, thought him agreeable. Eveline showed\nno friendliness towards him, and treated him with a hauteur and disdain\nthat he took for aristocratic behaviour and fashionable manners, and\nhe thought all the more of her on that account. This busy man taxed his\ningenuity to please them, and he sometimes succeeded. He got them\ncards for fashionable functions and boxes at the Opera. He furnished\nMademoiselle Clarence with several opportunities of appearing to great\nadvantage and in particular at a garden party which, although given by\na Minister, was regarded as really fashionable, and gained its first\nsuccess in society circles for the Republic.\n\nAt that party Eveline had been much noticed and had attracted the\nspecial attention of a young diplomat called Roger Lambilly who,\nimagining that she belonged to a rather fast set, invited her to his\nbachelor's flat. She thought him handsome and believed him rich, and she\naccepted. A little moved, almost disquieted, she very nearly became the\nvictim of her daring, and only avoided defeat by an offensive measure\naudaciously carried out. This was the most foolish escapade in her\nunmarried life.\n\nBeing now on friendly terms with Ministers and with the President,\nEveline continued to wear her aristocratic and pious affectations,\nand these won for her the sympathy of the chief personages in the\nanti-clerical and democratic Republic. M. Hippolyte Ceres, seeing that\nshe was succeeding and doing him credit, liked her still more. He even\nwent so far as to fall madly in love with her.\n\nHenceforth, in spite of everything, she began to observe him with\ninterest, being curious to see if his passion would increase. He\nappeared to her without elegance or grace, and not well bred, but\nactive, clear-sighted, full of resource, and not too great a bore. She\nstill made fun of him, but he had now won her interest.\n\nOne day she wished to test him. It was during the elections, when\nmembers of Parliament were, as the phrase runs, requesting a renewal of\ntheir mandates. He had an opponent, who, though not dangerous at first\nand not much of an orator, was rich and was reported to be gaining votes\nevery day. Hippolyte Ceres, banishing both dull security and foolish\nalarm from his mind, redoubled his care. His chief method of action\nwas by public meetings at which he spoke vehemently against the rival\ncandidate. His committee held huge meetings on Saturday evenings and\nat three o'clock on Sunday afternoons. One Sunday, as he called on\nthe Clarences, he found Eveline alone in the drawing-room. He had been\nchatting for about twenty or twenty-five minutes, when, taking out his\nwatch, he saw that it was a quarter to three. The young girl showed\nherself amiable, engaging, attractive, and full of promises. Ceres was\nfascinated, but he stood up to go.\n\n\"Stay a little longer,\" said she in a pressing and agreeable voice which\nmade him promptly sit down again.\n\nShe was full of interest, of abandon, curiosity, and weakness. He\nblushed, turned pale, and again got up.\n\nThen, in order to keep him still longer, she looked at him out of two\ngrey and melting eyes, and though her bosom was heaving, she did not say\nanother word. He fell at her feet in distraction, but once more looking\nat his watch, he jumped up with a terrible oath.\n\n\"D--! a quarter to four! I must be off.\"\n\nAnd immediately he rushed down the stairs.\n\nFrom that time onwards she had a certain amount of esteem for him.\n\n\n\n\nIV. A POLITICIAN'S MARRIAGE\n\nShe was not quite in love with him, but she wished him to be in love\nwith her. She was, moreover, very reserved with him, and that not solely\nfrom any want of inclination to be otherwise, since in affairs of\nlove some things are due to indifference, to inattention, to woman's\ninstinct, to traditional custom and feeling, to a desire to try one's\npower, and to satisfaction at seeing its results. The reason of her\nprudence was that she knew him to be very much infatuated and capable\nof taking advantage of any familiarities she allowed as well as of\nreproaching her coarsely afterwards if she discontinued them.\n\nAs he was a professed anti-clerical and free-thinker, she thought it\na good plan to affect an appearance of piety in his presence and to\nbe seen with prayer-books bound in red morocco, such as Queen Marie\nLeczinska's or the Dauphiness Marie Josephine's \"The Last Two Weeks of\nLent.\" She lost no opportunity, either, of showing him the subscriptions\nthat she collected for the endowment of the national cult of St.\nOrberosia. Eveline did not act in this way because she wished to tease\nhim. Nor did it spring from a young girl's archness, or a spirit of\nconstraint, or even from snobbishness, though there was more than\na suspicion of this latter in her behaviour. It was but her way of\nasserting herself, of stamping herself with a definite character, of\nincreasing her value. To rouse the Deputy's courage she wrapped herself\nup in religion, just as Brunhild surrounded herself with flames so as to\nattract Sigurd. Her audacity was successful. He thought her still more\nbeautiful thus. Clericalism was in his eyes a sign of good form.\n\nCeres was re-elected by an enormous majority and returned to a House\nwhich showed itself more inclined to the Left, more advanced, and, as it\nseemed, more eager for reform than its predecessor. Perceiving at once\nthat so much zeal was but intended to hide a fear of change, and a\nsincere desire to do nothing, he determined to adopt a policy that would\nsatisfy these aspirations. At the beginning of the session he made a\ngreat speech, cleverly thought out and well arranged, dealing with the\nidea that all reform ought to be put off for a long time. He showed\nhimself heated, even fervid; holding the principle that an orator should\nrecommend moderation with extreme vehemence. He was applauded by the\nentire assembly. The Clarences listened to him from the President's\nbox and Eveline trembled in spite of herself at the solemn sound of\nthe applause. On the same bench the fair Madame Pensee shivered at the\nintonations of his virile voice.\n\nAs soon as he descended from the tribune, Ceres, even while the audience\nwere still clapping, went without a moment's delay to salute the\nClarences in their box. Eveline saw in him the beauty of success, and as\nhe leaned towards the ladies, wiping his neck with his handkerchief\nand receiving their congratulations with an air of modesty though not\nwithout a tinge of self-conceit, the young girl glanced towards Madame\nPensee and saw her, palpitating and breathless, drinking in the hero's\napplause with her head thrown backwards. It seemed as if she were on the\npoint of fainting. Eveline immediately smiled tenderly on M. Ceres.\n\nThe Alcan deputy's speech had a great vogue. In political \"spheres\"\nit was regarded as extremely able. \"We have at last heard an honest\npronouncement,\" said the chief Moderate journal. \"It is a regular\nprogramme!\" they said in the House. It was agreed that he was a man of\nimmense talent.\n\nHippolyte Ceres had now established himself as leader of the radicals,\nsocialists, and anti-clericals, and they appointed him President of\ntheir group, which was then the most considerable in the House. He thus\nfound himself marked out for office in the next ministerial combination.\n\nAfter a long hesitation Eveline Clarence accepted the idea of marrying\nM. Hippolyte Ceres. The great man was a little common for her taste.\nNothing had yet proved that he would one day reach the point where\npolitics bring in large sums of money. But she was entering her\ntwenty-seventh year and knew enough of life to see that she must not be\ntoo fastidious or show herself too difficult to please.\n\nHippolyte Ceres was celebrated; Hippolyte Ceres was happy. He was no\nlonger recognisable; the elegance of his clothes and deportment had\nincreased tremendously. He wore an undue number of white gloves. Now\nthat he was too much of a society man, Eveline began to doubt if it was\nnot worse than being too little of one. Madame Clarence regarded the\nengagement with favour. She was reassured concerning her daughter's\nfuture and pleased to have flowers given her every Thursday for her\ndrawing-room.\n\nThe celebration of the marriage raised some difficulties. Eveline was\npious and wished to receive the benediction of the Church. Hippolyte\nCeres, tolerant but a free-thinker, wanted only a civil marriage. There\nwere many discussions and even some violent scenes upon the subject.\nThe last took place in the young girl's room at the moment when the\ninvitations were being written. Eveline declared that if she did not go\nto church she would not believe herself married. She spoke of breaking\noff the engagement, and of going abroad with her mother, or of retiring\ninto a convent. Then she became tender, weak, suppliant. She sighed,\nand everything in her virginal chamber sighed in chorus, the holy-water\nfont, the palm-branch above her white bed, the books of devotion on\ntheir little shelves, and the blue and white statuette of St.\nOrberosia chaining the dragon of Cappadocia, that stood upon the marble\nmantelpiece. Hippolyte Ceres was moved, softened, melted.\n\nBeautiful in her grief, her eyes shining with tears, her wrists girt\nby a rosary of lapis lazuli and, so to speak, chained by her faith,\nshe suddenly flung herself at Hippolyte's feet, and dishevelled, almost\ndying, she embraced his knees.\n\nHe nearly yielded.\n\n\"A religious marriage,\" he muttered, \"a marriage in church, I could\nmake my constituents stand that, but my committee would not swallow the\nmatter so easily. . . . Still I'll explain it to them . . . toleration,\nsocial necessities . . . . They all send their daughters to Sunday\nschool . . . . But as for office, my dear I am afraid we are going to\ndrown all hope of that in your holy water.\"\n\nAt these words she stood up grave, generous, resigned, conquered also in\nher turn.\n\n\"My dear, I insist no longer.\"\n\n\"Then we won't have a religious marriage. It will be better, much better\nnot.\"\n\n\"Very well, but be guided by me. I am going to try and arrange\neverything both to your satisfaction and mine.\"\n\nShe sought the Reverend Father Douillard and explained the situation. He\nshowed himself even more accommodating and yielding than she had hoped.\n\n\"Your husband is an intelligent man, a man of order and reason; he will\ncome over to us. You will sanctify him. It is not in vain that God has\ngranted him the blessing of a Christian wife. The Church needs no pomp\nand ceremonial display for her benedictions. Now that she is persecuted,\nthe shadow of the crypts and the recesses of the catacombs are in better\naccord with her festivals. Mademoiselle, when you have performed the\ncivil formalities come here to my private chapel in costume with M.\nCeres. I will marry you, a observe the most absolute discretion. I will\nobtain the necessary dispensations from the Archbishop as well as all\nfacilities regarding the banns, confession-tickets, etc.\"\n\nHippolyte, although he thought the combination a little dangerous,\nagreed to it, a good deal flattered, at bottom.\n\n\"I will go in a short coat,\" he said.\n\nHe went in a frock coat with white gloves and varnished shoes, and he\ngenuflected.\n\n\"Politeness demands. . . .\"\n\n\n\n\nV. THE VISIRE CABINET\n\nThe Ceres household was established with modest decency in a pretty flat\nsituated in a new building. Ceres loved his wife in a calm and tranquil\nfashion. He was often kept late from home by the Commission on the\nBudget and he worked more than three nights a week at a report on the\npostal finances of which he hoped to make a masterpiece. Eveline thought\nshe could twist him round her finger, and this did not displease him.\nThe bad side of their situation was that they had not much money; in\ntruth they had very little. The servants of the Republic do not grow\nrich in her service as easily as people think. Since the sovereign is no\nlonger there to distribute favours, each of them takes what he can, and\nhis depredations, limited by the depredations of all the others, are\nreduced to modest proportions. Hence that austerity of morals that is\nnoticed in democratic leaders. They can only grow rich during periods\nof great business activity and then they find themselves exposed to the\nenvy of their less favoured colleagues. Hippolyte Ceres had for a\nlong time foreseen such a period. He was one of those who had made\npreparations for its arrival. Whilst waiting for it he endured his\npoverty with dignity, and Eveline shared that poverty without suffering\nas much as one might have thought. She was in close intimacy with the\nReverend Father Douillard and frequented the chapel of St. Orberosia,\nwhere she met with serious society and people in a position to render\nher useful services. She knew how to choose among them and gave her\nconfidence to none but those who deserved it. She had gained experience\nsince her motor excursions with Viscount Clena, and above all she had\nnow acquired the value of a married woman.\n\nThe deputy was at first uneasy about these pious practices, which were\nridiculed by the demagogic newspapers, but he was soon reassured, for\nhe saw all around him democratic leaders joyfully becoming reconciled to\nthe aristocracy and the Church.\n\nThey found that they had reached one of those periods (which often\nrecur) when advance had been carried a little too far. Hippolyte Ceres\ngave a moderate support to this view. His policy was not a policy of\npersecution but a policy of tolerance. He had laid its foundations in\nhis splendid speech on the preparations for reform. The Prime Minister\nwas looked upon as too advanced. He proposed schemes which were admitted\nto be dangerous to capital, and the great financial companies were\nopposed to him. Of course it followed that the papers of all views\nsupported the companies. Seeing the danger increasing, the Cabinet\nabandoned its schemes, its programme, and its opinions, but it was too\nlate. A new administration was already ready. An insidious question by\nPaul Visire which was immediately made the subject of a resolution, and\na fine speech by Hippolyte Ceres, overthrew the Cabinet.\n\nThe President of the Republic entrusted the formation of a new Cabinet\nto this same Paul Visire, who, though still very young, had been a\nMinister twice. He was a charming man, spending much of his time in the\ngreen-rooms of theatres, very artistic, a great society man, of amazing\nability and industry. Paul Visire formed a temporary ministry intended\nto reassure public feeling which had taken alarm, and Hippolyte Ceres\nwas invited to hold office in it.\n\nThe new ministry, belonging to all the groups in the majority,\nrepresented the most diverse and contrary opinions, but they were all\nmoderate and convinced conservatives.* The Minister of Foreign Affairs\nwas retained from the former cabinet. He was a little dark man called\nCrombile, who worked fourteen hours a day with the conviction that\nhe dealt with tremendous questions. He refused to see even his own\ndiplomatic agents, and was terribly uneasy, though he did not disturb\nanybody else, for the want of foresight of peoples is infinite and that\nof governments is just as great.\n\n     * As this ministry exercised considerable influence upon the\n     destinies of the country and of the world, we think it well\n     to give its composition: Minister of the Interior and Prime\n     Minister, Paul Visire; Minister of Justice, Pierre Bouc;\n     Foreign Affairs, Victor Crombile; Finance, Terrasson;\n     Education, Labillette; Commerce, Posts and Telegraphs,\n     Hippolyte Ceres; Agriculture, Aulac; Public Works,\n     Lapersonne; War, General Debonnaire; Admiralty, Admiral\n     Vivier des Murenes.\n\nThe office of Public Works was given to a Socialist, Fortune Lapersonne.\nIt was then a political custom and one of the most solemn, most severe,\nmost rigorous, and if I may dare say so, the most terrible and cruel\nof all political customs, to include a member of the Socialist party\nin each ministry intended to oppose Socialism, so that the enemies of\nwealth and property should suffer the shame of being attacked by one of\ntheir own party, and so that they could not unite against these forces\nwithout turning to some one who might possibly attack themselves in the\nfuture. Nothing but a profound ignorance of the human heart would permit\nthe belief that it was difficult to find a Socialist to occupy these\nfunctions. Citizen Fortune Lapersonne entered the Visire cabinet of\nhis own free will and without any constraint; and he found those who\napproved of his action even among his former friends, so great was the\nfascination that power exercised over the Penguins!\n\nGeneral Debonnaire went to the War Office. He was looked upon as one\nof the ablest generals in the army, but he was ruled by a woman, the\nBaroness Bildermann, who, though she had reached the age of intrigue,\nwas still beautiful. She was in the pay of a neighbouring and hostile\nPower.\n\nThe new Minister of Marine, the worthy Admiral Vivier des Murenes, was\ngenerally regarded as an excellent seaman. He displayed a piety that\nwould have seemed excessive in an anti-clerical minister, if the\nRepublic had not recognised that religion was of great maritime utility.\nActing on the instruction of his spiritual director, the Reverend Father\nDouillard, the worthy Admiral had dedicated his fleet to St. Orberosia\nand directed canticles in honour of the Alcan Virgin to be composed by\nChristian bards. These replaced the national hymn in the music played by\nthe navy.\n\nPrime Minister Visire declared himself to be distinctly anticlerical\nbut ready to respect all creeds; he asserted that he was a sober-minded\nreformer. Paul Visire and his colleagues desired reforms, and it was in\norder not to compromise reform that they proposed none; for they were\ntrue politicians and knew that reforms are compromised the moment they\nare proposed. The government was well received, respectable people were\nreassured, and the funds rose.\n\nThe administration announced that four new ironclads would be put\ninto commission, that prosecutions would be undertaken against the\nSocialists, and it formally declared its intention to have nothing to do\nwith any inquisitorial income-tax. The choice of Terrasson as Minister\nof Finance was warmly approved by the press. Terrasson, an old minister\nfamous for his financial operations, gave warrant to all the hopes of\nthe financiers and shadowed forth a period of great business activity.\nSoon those three udders of modern nations, monopolies, bill discounting,\nand fraudulent speculation, were swollen with the milk of wealth.\nAlready whispers were heard of distant enterprises, and of planting\ncolonies, and the boldest put forward in the newspapers the project of a\nmilitary and financial protectorate over Nigritia.\n\nWithout having yet shown what he was capable of, Hippolyte Ceres was\nconsidered a man of weight. Business people thought highly of him.\nHe was congratulated on all sides for having broken with the\nextreme sections, the dangerous men, and for having realised the\nresponsibilities of government.\n\nMadame Ceres shone alone amid the Ministers' wives. Crombile withered\naway in bachelordom. Paul Visire had married money in the person of\nMademoiselle Blampignon, an accomplished, estimable, and simple lady who\nwas always ill, and whose feeble health compelled her to stay with her\nmother in the depths of a remote province. The other Ministers' wives\nwere not born to charm the sight, and people smiled when they read\nthat Madame Labillette had appeared at the Presidency Ball wearing a\nheaddress of birds of paradise. Madame Vivier des Murenes, a woman of\ngood family, was stout rather than tall, had a face like a beef-steak\nand the voice of a newspaper-seller. Madame Debonnaire, tall, dry,\nand florid, was devoted to young officers. She ruined herself by her\nescapades and crimes and only regained consideration by dint of ugliness\nand insolence.\n\nMadame Ceres was the charm of the Ministry and its tide to\nconsideration. Young, beautiful, and irreproachable, she charmed alike\nsociety and the masses by her combination of elegant costumes and\npleasant smiles.\n\nHer receptions were thronged by the great Jewish financiers. She gave\nthe most fashionable garden parties in the Republic. The newspapers\ndescribed her dresses and the milliners did not ask her to pay for them.\nShe went to Mass; she protected the chapel of St. Orberosia from the\nill-will of the people; and she aroused in aristocratic hearts the hope\nof a fresh Concordat.\n\nWith her golden hair, grey eyes, and supple and slight though rounded\nfigure, she was indeed pretty. She enjoyed an excellent reputation and\nshe was so adroit, and calm, so much mistress of herself, that she would\nhave preserved it intact even if she had been discovered in the very act\nof ruining it.\n\nThe session ended with a victory for the cabinet which, amid the\nalmost unanimous applause of the House, defeated a proposal for an\ninquisitorial tax, and with a triumph for Madame Ceres who gave parties\nin honour of three kings who were at the moment passing through Alca.\n\n\n\n\nVI. THE SOFA OF THE FAVOURITE\n\nThe Prime Minister invited Monsieur and Madame Ceres to spend a couple\nof weeks of the holidays in a little villa that he had taken in the\nmountains, and in which he lived alone. The deplorable health of Madame\nPaul Visire did not allow her to accompany her husband, and she remained\nwith her relatives in one of the southern provinces.\n\nThe villa had belonged to the mistress of one of the last Kings of Alca:\nthe drawing-room retained its old furniture, and in it was still to be\nfound the Sofa of the Favourite. The country was charming; a pretty blue\nstream, the Aiselle, flowed at the foot of the hill that dominated the\nvilla. Hippolyte Ceres loved fishing; when engaged at this monotonous\noccupation he often formed his best Parliamentary combinations, and\nhis happiest oratorical inspirations. Trout swarmed in the Aiselle; he\nfished it from morning till evening in a boat that the Prime Minister\nreadily placed at is disposal.\n\nIn the mean time, Eveline and Paul Visire sometimes took a turn together\nin the garden, or had a little chat in the drawing-room. Eveline,\nalthough she recognised the attraction that Visire had for women, had\nhitherto displayed towards him only an intermittent and superficial\ncoquetry, without any deep intentions or settled design. He was a\nconnoisseur and saw that she was pretty. The House and the Opera had\ndeprived him of all leisure, but, in a little villa, the grey eyes\nand rounded figure of Eveline took on a value in his eyes. One day as\nHippolyte Ceres was fishing in the Aiselle, he made her sit beside him\non the Sofa of the Favourite. Long rays of gold struck Eveline like\narrows from a hidden Cupid through the chinks of the curtains which\nprotected her from the heat and glare of a brilliant day. Beneath her\nwhite muslin dress her rounded yet slender form was outlined in its\ngrace and youth. Her skin was cool and fresh, and had the fragrance of\nfreshly mown hay. Paul Visire behaved as the occasion warranted, and for\nher part, she was opposed neither to the games of chance or of society.\nShe believed it would be nothing or a trifle; she was mistaken.\n\n\"There was,\" says the famous German ballad, \"on the sunny side of the\ntown square, beside a wall whereon the creeper grew, a pretty little\nletter-box, as blue as the corn-flowers, smiling and tranquil.\n\n\"All day long there came to it, in their heavy shoes, small\nshop-keepers, rich farmers, citizens, the tax-collector and the\npoliceman, and they put into it their business letters, their invoices,\ntheir summonses their notices to pay taxes, the judges' returns, and\norders for the recruits to assemble. It remained smiling and tranquil.\n\n\"With joy, or in anxiety, there advanced towards it workmen and farm\nservants, maids and nursemaids, accountants, clerks, and women carrying\ntheir little children in their arms; they put into it notifications of\nbirths, marriages, and deaths, letters between engaged couples, between\nhusbands and wives, from mothers to their sons, and from sons to their\nmothers. It remained smiling and tranquil.\n\n\"At twilight, young lads and young girls slipped furtively to it, and\nput in love-letters, some moistened with tears that blotted the ink,\nothers with a little circle to show the place to kiss, all of them very\nlong. It remained smiling and tranquil.\n\n\"Rich merchants came themselves through excess of carefulness at the\nhour of daybreak, and put into it registered letters, and letters with\nfive red seals, full of bank notes or cheques on the great financial\nestablishments of the Empire. It remained smiling and tranquil.\n\n\"But one day, Gaspar, whom it had never seen, and whom it did not know\nfrom Adam, came to put in a letter, of which nothing is known but that\nit was folded like a little hat. Immediately the pretty letter-box fell\ninto a swoon. Henceforth it remains no longer in its place; it runs\nthrough streets, fields, and woods, girdled with ivy, and crowned with\nroses. It keeps running up hill and down dale; the country policeman\nsurprises it sometimes, amidst the corn, in Gaspar's arms kissing him\nupon the mouth.\"\n\nPaul Visire had recovered all his customary nonchalance. Eveline\nremained stretched on the Divan of the Favourite in an attitude of\ndelicious astonishment.\n\nThe Reverend Father Douillard, an excellent moral theologian, and a man\nwho in the decadence of the Church has preserved his principles, was\nvery right to teach, in conformity with the doctrine of the Fathers,\nthat while a woman commits a great sin by giving herself for money, she\ncommits a much greater one by giving herself for nothing. For, in the\nfirst case she acts to support her life, and that is sometimes not\nmerely excusable but pardonable, and even worthy of the Divine Grace,\nfor God forbids suicide, and is unwilling that his creatures should\ndestroy themselves. Besides, in giving herself in order to live, she\nremains humble, and derives no pleasure from it a thing which diminishes\nthe sin. But a woman who gives herself for nothing sins with pleasure\nand exults in her fault. The pride and delight with which she burdens\nher crime increase its load of moral guilt.\n\nMadame Hippolyte Ceres' example shows the profundity of these moral\ntruths. She perceived that she had senses. A second was enough to bring\nabout this discovery, to change her soul, to alter her whole life. To\nhave learned to know herself was at first a delight. The {greek here}\nof the ancient philosophy is not a precept the moral fulfilment of which\nprocures any pleasure, since one enjoys little satisfaction from knowing\none's soul. It is not the same with the flesh, for in it sources of\npleasure may be revealed to us. Eveline immediately felt an obligation\nto her revealer equal to the benefit she had received, and she imagined\nthat he who had discovered these heavenly depths was the sole possessor\nof the key to them. Was this an error, and might she not be able to\nfind others who also had the golden key? It is difficult to decide; and\nProfessor Haddock, when the facts were divulged (which happened without\nmuch delay as we shall see), treated the matter from an experimental\npoint of view, in a scientific review, and concluded that the chances\nMadame C-- would have of finding the exact equivalent of M. V-- were\nin the proportion of 305 to 975008. This is as much as to say that she\nwould never find it. Doubtless her instinct told her the same, for she\nattached herself distractedly to him.\n\nI have related these facts with all the circumstances which seemed to me\nworthy of attracting the attention of meditative and philosophic minds.\nThe Sofa of the Favourite is worthy of the majesty of history; on\nit were decided the destinies of a great people; nay, on it was\naccomplished an act whose renown was to extend over the neighbouring\nnations both friendly and hostile, and even over all humanity. Too often\nevents of this nature escape the superficial minds and shallow spirits\nwho inconsiderately assume the task of writing history. Thus the secret\nsprings of events remain hidden from us. The fall of Empires and the\ntransmission of dominions astonish us and remain incomprehensible to us,\nbecause we have not discovered the imperceptible point, or touched the\nsecret spring which when put in movement has destroyed and overthrown\neverything. The author of this great history knows better than\nanyone else his faults and his weaknesses, but he can do himself this\njustice--that he has always kept the moderation, the seriousness, the\nausterity, which an account of affairs of State demands, and that he has\nnever departed from the gravity which is suitable to a recital of human\nactions.\n\n\n\n\nVII. THE FIRST CONSEQUENCES\n\nWhen Eveline confided to Paul Visire that she had never experienced\nanything similar, he did not believe her. He had had a good deal to do\nwith women and knew that they readily say these things to men in order\nto make them more in love with them. Thus his experience, as sometimes\nhappens, made him disregard the truth. Incredulous, but gratified all\nthe same, he soon felt love and something more for her. This state at\nfirst seemed favourable to his intellectual faculties. Visire delivered\nin the chief town of his constituency a speech full of grace, brilliant\nand happy, which was considered to be a masterpiece.\n\nThe re-opening of Parliament was serene. A few isolated jealousies, a\nfew timid ambitions raised their heads in the House, and that was all. A\nsmile from the Prime Minister was enough to dissipate these shadows.\nShe and he saw each other twice a day, and wrote to each other in the\ninterval. He was accustomed to intimate relationships, was adroit, and\nknew how to dissimulate; but Eveline displayed a foolish imprudence: she\nmade herself conspicuous with him in drawing-rooms, at the theatre, in\nthe House, and at the Embassies; she wore her love upon her face, upon\nher whole person, in her moist glances, in the languishing smile of her\nlips, in the heaving of her breast, in all her heightened, agitated,\nand distracted beauty. Soon the entire country knew of their intimacy.\nForeign Courts were informed of it. The President of the Republic and\nEveline's husband alone remained in ignorance. The President became\nacquainted with it in the country, through a misplaced police report\nwhich found its way, it is not known how, into his portmanteau.\n\nHippolyte Ceres, without being either very subtle, or very\nperspicacious, noticed that there was something different in his home.\nEveline, who quite lately had interested herself in his affairs, and\nshown, if not tenderness, at least affection, towards him, displayed\nhenceforth nothing but indifference and repulsion. She had always had\nperiods of absence, and made prolonged visits to the Charity of St.\nOrberosia; now, she went out in the morning, remained out all day, and\nsat down to dinner at nine o'clock in the evening with the face of a\nsomnambulist. Her husband thought it absurd; however, he might perhaps\nhave never known the reason for this; a profound ignorance of women, a\ncrass confidence in his own merit, and in his own fortune, might perhaps\nhave always hidden the truth from him, if the two lovers had not, so to\nspeak, compelled him to discover it.\n\nWhen Paul Visire went to Eveline's house and found her alone, they\nused to say, as they embraced each other; \"Not here! not here!\" and\nimmediately they affected an extreme reserve. That was their invariable\nrule. Now, one day, Paul Visire went to the house of his colleague\nCeres, with whom he had an engagement. It was Eveline who received him,\nthe Minister of Commerce being delayed by a commission.\n\n\"Not here!\" said the lovers, smiling.\n\nThey said it, mouth to mouth, embracing, and clasping each other. They\nwere still saying it, when Hippolyte Ceres entered the drawing-room.\n\nPaul Visire did not lose his presence of mind. He declared to Madame\nCeres that he would give up his attempt to take the dust out of her\neye. By this attitude he did not deceive the husband, but he was able to\nleave the room with some dignity.\n\nHippolyte Ceres was thunderstruck. Eveline's conduct appeared\nincomprehensible to him; he asked her what reasons she had for it.\n\n\"Why? why?\" he kept repeating continually, \"why?\"\n\nShe denied everything, not to convince him, for he had seen them, but\nfrom expediency and good taste, and to avoid painful explanations.\nHippolyte Ceres suffered all the tortures of jealousy. He admitted it\nto himself, he kept saying inwardly, \"I am a strong man; I am clad in\narmour; but the wound is underneath, it is in my heart,\" and turning\ntowards his wife, who looked beautiful in her guilt, he would say:\n\n\"It ought not to have been with him.\"\n\nHe was right--Eveline ought not to have loved in government circles.\n\nHe suffered so much that he took up his revolver, exclaiming: \"I will go\nand kill him!\" But he remembered that a Minister of Commerce cannot kill\nhis own Prime Minister, and he put his revolver back into his drawer.\n\nThe weeks passed without calming his sufferings. Each morning he buckled\nhis strong man's armour over his wound and sought in work and fame the\npeace that fled from him. Every Sunday he inaugurated busts, statues,\nfountains, artesian wells, hospitals, dispensaries, railways, canals,\npublic markets, drainage systems, triumphal arches, and slaughter\nhouses, and delivered moving speeches on each of these occasions.\nHis fervid activity devoured whole piles of documents; he changed the\ncolours of the postage stamps fourteen times in one week. Nevertheless,\nhe gave vent to outbursts of grief and rage that drove him insane; for\nwhole days his reason abandoned him. If he had been in the employment of\na private administration this would have been noticed immediately, but\nit is much more difficult to discover insanity or frenzy in the conduct\nof affairs of State. At that moment the government employees were\nforming themselves into associations and federations amid a ferment\nthat was giving alarm both to the Parliament and to public feeling. The\npostmen were especially prominent in their enthusiasm for trade unions.\n\nHippolyte Ceres informed them in a circular that their action was\nstrictly legal. The following day he sent out a second circular\nforbidding all associations of government employees as illegal. He\ndismissed one hundred and eighty postmen, reinstated them, reprimanded\nthem--and awarded them gratuities. At Cabinet councils he was always\non the point of bursting forth. The presence of the Head of the State\nscarcely restrained him within the limits of the decencies, and as\nhe did not dare to attack his rival he consoled himself by heaping\ninvectives upon General Debonnaire, the respected Minister of War.\nThe General did not hear them, for he was deaf and occupied himself in\ncomposing verses for the Baroness Bildermann. Hippolyte Ceres offered\nan indistinct opposition to everything the Prime Minister proposed. In\na word, he was a madman. One faculty alone escaped the ruin of his\nintellect: he retained his Parliamentary sense, his consciousness of\nthe temper of majorities, his thorough knowledge of groups, and his\ncertainty of the direction in which affairs were moving.\n\n\n\n\nVIII. FURTHER CONSEQUENCES\n\nThe session ended calmly, and the Ministry saw no dangerous signs\nupon the benches where the majority sat. It was visible, however, from\ncertain articles in the Moderate journals, that the demands of the\nJewish and Christian financiers were increasing daily, that the\npatriotism of the banks required a civilizing expedition to Nigritia,\nand that the steel trusts, eager in the defence of our coasts and\ncolonies, were crying out for armoured cruisers and still more armoured\ncruisers. Rumours of war began to be heard. Such rumours sprang up every\nyear as regularly as the trade winds; serious people paid no heed\nto them and the government usually let them die away from their own\nweakness unless they grew stronger and spread. For in that case the\ncountry would be alarmed. The financiers only wanted colonial wars and\nthe people did not want any wars at all. It loved to see its government\nproud and even insolent, but at the least suspicion that a European war\nwas brewing, its violent emotion would quickly have reached the House.\nPaul Visire was not uneasy. The European situation was in his view\ncompletely reassuring. He was only irritated by the maniacal silence of\nhis Minister of Foreign Affairs. That gnome went to the Cabinet meetings\nwith a portfolio bigger than himself stuffed full of papers, said\nnothing, refused to answer all questions, even those asked him by the\nrespected President of the Republic, and, exhausted by his obstinate\nlabours, took a few moments' sleep in his arm-chair in which nothing\nbut the top of his little black head was to be seen above the green\ntablecloth.\n\nIn the mean time Hippolyte Ceres became a strong man again. In company\nwith his colleague Lapersonne he formed numerous intimacies with ladies\nof the theatre. They were both to be seen at night entering fashionable\nrestaurants in the company of ladies whom they over-topped by their\nlofty stature and their new hats, and they were soon reckoned amongst\nthe most sympathetic frequenters of the boulevards. Fortune Lapersonne\nhad his own wound beneath his armour, His wife, a young milliner whom he\ncarried off from a marquis, had gone to live with a chauffeur. He loved\nher still, and could not console himself for her loss, so that very\noften in the private room of a restaurant, in the midst of a group of\ngirls who laughed and ate crayfish, the two ministers exchanged a look\nfull of their common sorrow and wiped away an unbidden tear.\n\nHippolyte Ceres, although wounded to the heart, did not allow himself to\nbe beaten. He swore that he would be avenged.\n\nMadame Paul Visire, whose deplorable health forced her to live with her\nrelatives in a distant province, received an anonymous letter specifying\nthat M. Paul Visire, who had not a half-penny when he married her, was\nspending her dowry on a married woman, E-- C--, that he gave this\nwoman thirty-thousand-franc motor-cars, and pearl necklaces costing\ntwenty-five thousand francs, and that he was going straight to dishonour\nand ruin. Madame Paul Visire read the letter, fell into hysterics, and\nhanded it to her father.\n\n\"I am going to box your husband's ears,\" said M. Blampignon; \"he is a\nblackguard who will land you both in the workhouse unless we look out.\nHe may be Prime Minister, but he won't frighten me.\"\n\nWhen he stepped off the train M. Blampignon presented himself at the\nMinistry of the Interior, and was immediately received. He entered the\nPrime Minister's room in a fury.\n\n\"I have something to say to you, sir!\" And he waved the anonymous\nletter.\n\nPaul Visire welcomed him smiling.\n\n\"You are welcome, my dear father. I was going to write to you. . . .\nYes, to tell you of your nomination to the rank of officer of the Legion\nof Honour. I signed the patent this morning.\"\n\nM. Blampignon thanked his son-in-law warmly and threw the anonymous\nletter into the fire.\n\nHe returned to his provincial house and found his daughter fretting and\nagitated.\n\n\"Well! I saw your husband. He is a delightful fellow. But then, you\ndon't understand how to deal with him.\"\n\nAbout this time Hippolyte Ceres learned through a little scandalous\nnewspaper (it is always through the newspapers that ministers are\ninformed of the affairs of State) that the Prime Minister dined every\nevening with Mademoiselle Lysiane of the Folies Dramatiques, whose charm\nseemed to have made a great impression on him. Thenceforth Ceres took\na gloomy joy in watching his wife. She came in every evening to dine or\ndress with an air of agreeable fatigue and the serenity that comes from\nenjoyment.\n\nThinking that she knew nothing, he sent her anonymous communications.\nShe read them at the table before him and remained still listless and\nsmiling.\n\nHe then persuaded himself that she gave no heed to these vague reports,\nand that in order to disturb her it would be necessary to enable her to\nverify her lover's infidelity and treason for herself. There were at the\nMinistry a number of trustworthy agents charged with secret inquiries\nregarding the national defence. They were then employed in watching the\nspies of a neighbouring and hostile Power who had succeeded in entering\nthe Postal and Telegraphic service. M. Ceres ordered them to suspend\ntheir work for the present and to inquire where, when, and how, the\nMinister of the Interior saw Mademoiselle Lysiane. The agents performed\ntheir missions faithfully and told the minister that they had several\ntimes seen the Prime Minister with a woman, but that she was not\nMademoiselle Lysiane. Hippolyte Ceres asked them nothing further. He was\nright; the loves of Paul Visire and Lysiane were but an alibi invented\nby Paul Visire himself, with Eveline's approval, for his fame was rather\ninconvenient to her, and she sighed for secrecy and mystery.\n\nThey were not shadowed by the agents of the Ministry of Commerce alone.\nThey were also followed by those of the Prefect of Police, and even by\nthose of the Minister of the Interior, who disputed with each other\nthe honour of protecting their chief. Then there were the emissaries\nof several royalist, imperialist, and clerical organisations, those of\neight or ten blackmailers, several amateur detectives, a multitude of\nreporters, and a crowd of photographers, who all made their appearance\nwherever these two took refuge in their perambulating love affairs,\nat big hotels, small hotels, town houses, country houses, private\napartments, villas, museums, palaces, hovels. They kept watch in the\nstreets, from neighbouring houses, trees, walls, stair-cases, landings,\nroofs, adjoining rooms, and even chimneys. The Minister and his friend\nsaw with alarm all round their bed room, gimlets boring through doors\nand shutters, and drills making holes in the walls. A photograph of\nMadame Ceres in night attire buttoning her boots was the utmost that had\nbeen obtained.\n\nPaul Visire grew impatient and irritable, and often lost his good humour\nand agreeableness. He came to the cabinet meetings in a rage and he,\ntoo, poured invectives upon General Debonnaire--a brave man under fire\nbut a lax disciplinarian--and launched his sarcasms at against the\nvenerable admiral Vivier des Murenes whose ships went to the bottom\nwithout any apparent reason.\n\nFortune Lapersonne listened open-eyed, and grumbled scoffingly between\nhis teeth:\n\n\"He is not satisfied with robbing Hippolyte Ceres of his wife, but he\nmust go and rob him of his catchwords too.\"\n\nThese storms were made known by the indiscretion of some ministers and\nby the complaints of the two old warriors, who declared their intention\nof flinging their portfolios at the beggar's head, but who did nothing\nof the sort. These outbursts, far from injuring the lucky Prime\nMinister, had an excellent effect on Parliament and public opinion,\nwho looked on them as signs of a keen solicitude for the welfare of the\nnational army and navy. The Prime Minister was the recipient of general\napprobation.\n\nTo the congratulations of the various groups and of notable personages,\nhe replied with simple firmness: \"Those are my principles!\" and he had\nseven or eight Socialists put in prison.\n\nThe session ended, and Paul Visire, very exhausted, went to take the\nwaters. Hippolyte Ceres refused to leave his Ministry, where the trade\nunion of telephone girls was in tumultuous agitation. He opposed it with\nan unheard of violence, for he had now become a woman-hater. On Sundays\nhe went into the suburbs to fish along with his colleague Lapersonne,\nwearing the tall hat that never left him since he had become a Minister.\nAnd both of them, forgetting the fish, complained of the inconstancy of\nwomen and mingled their griefs.\n\nHippolyte still loved Eveline and he still suffered. However, hope\nhad slipped into his heart. She was now separated from her lover, and,\nthinking to win her back, he directed all his efforts to that end.\nHe put forth all his skill, showed himself sincere, adaptable,\naffectionate, devoted, even discreet; his heart taught him the\ndelicacies of feeling. He said charming and touching things to the\nfaithless one, and, to soften her, he told her all that he had suffered.\n\nCrossing the band of his trousers upon his stomach.\n\n\"See,\" said he, \"how thin I have got.\"\n\nHe promised her everything he thought could gratify a woman, country\nparties, hats, jewels.\n\nSometimes he thought she would take pity on him.\n\nShe no longer displayed an insolently happy countenance. Being separated\nfrom Paul, her sadness had an air of gentleness. But the moment he made\na gesture to recover her she turned away fiercely and gloomily, girt\nwith her fault as if with a golden girdle.\n\nHe did not give up, making himself humble, suppliant, lamentable.\n\nOne day he went to Lapersonne and said to him with tears in his eyes:\n\n\"Will you speak to her?\"\n\nLapersonne excused himself, thinking that his intervention would be\nuseless, but he gave some advice to his friend.\n\n\"Make her think that you don't care about her, that you love another,\nand she will come back to you.\"\n\nHippolyte, adopting this method, inserted in the newspapers that he was\nalways to be found in the company of Mademoiselle Guinaud of the Opera.\nHe came home late or did not come home at all, assumed in Eveline's\npresence an appearance of inward joy impossible to restrain, took out of\nhis pocket, at dinner, a letter on scented paper which he pretended to\nread with delight, and his lips seemed as in a dream to kiss invisible\nlips. Nothing happened. Eveline did not even notice the change.\nInsensible to all around her, she only came out of her lethargy to ask\nfor some louis from her husband, and if he did not give them she threw\nhim a look of contempt, ready to upbraid him with the shame which she\npoured upon him in the sight of the whole world. Since she had loved\nshe spent a great deal on dress. She needed money, and she had only her\nhusband to secure it for her; she was so far faithful to him.\n\nHe lost patience, became furious, and threatened her with his revolver.\nHe said one day before her to Madame Clarence:\n\n\"I congratulate you, Madame; you have brought up your daughter to be a\nwanton hussy.\"\n\n\"Take me away, Mamma,\" exclaimed Eveline. \"I will get a divorce!\"\n\nHe loved her more ardently than ever. In his jealous rage, suspecting\nher, not without probability, of sending and receiving letters, he swore\nthat he would intercept them, re-established a censorship over the post,\nthrew private correspondence into confusion, delayed stock-exchange\nquotations, prevented assignations, brought about bankruptcies, thwarted\npassions, and caused suicides. The independent press gave utterance to\nthe complaints of the public and indignantly supported them. To justify\nthese arbitrary measures, the ministerial journals spoke darkly of plots\nand public dangers, and promoted a belief in a monarchical conspiracy.\nThe less well-informed sheets gave more precise information, told of\nthe seizure of fifty thousand guns, and the landing of Prince Crucho.\nFeeling grew throughout the country, and the republican organs called\nfor the immediate meeting of Parliament. Paul Visire returned to\nParis, summoned his colleagues, held an important Cabinet Council, and\nproclaimed through his agencies that a plot had been actually formed\nagainst the national representation, but that the Prime Minister held\nthe threads of it in his hand, and that a judicial inquiry was about to\nbe opened.\n\nHe immediately ordered the arrest of thirty Socialists, and whilst\nthe entire country was acclaiming him as its saviour, baffling the\nwatchfulness of his six hundred detectives, he secretly took Eveline to\na little house near the Northern railway station, where they remained\nuntil night. After their departure, the maid of their hotel, as she\nwas putting their room in order, saw seven little crosses traced by a\nhairpin on the wall at the head of the bed.\n\nThat is all that Hippolyte Ceres obtained as a reward of his efforts.\n\n\n\n\nIX. THE FINAL CONSEQUENCES\n\nJealousy is a virtue of democracies which preserves them from tyrants.\nDeputies began to envy the Prime Minister his golden key. For a year his\ndomination over the beauteous Madame Ceres had been known to the whole\nuniverse. The provinces, whither news and fashions only arrive after a\ncomplete revolution of the earth round the sun, were at last informed of\nthe illegitimate loves of the Cabinet. The provinces preserve an austere\nmorality; women are more virtuous there than they are in the capital.\n\nVarious reasons have been alleged for this: Education, example,\nsimplicity of life. Professor Haddock asserts that this virtue of\nprovincial ladies is solely due to the fact that the heels of their\nshoes are low. \"A woman,\" said he, in a learned article in the\n\"Anthropological Review\", \"a woman attracts a civilized man in\nproportion as her feet make an angle with the ground. If this angle is\nas much as thirty-five degrees, the attraction becomes acute. For the\nposition of the feet upon the ground determines the whole carriage of\nthe body, and it results that provincial women, since they wear low\nheels, are not very attractive, and preserve their virtue with ease.\"\nThese conclusions were not generally accepted. It was objected that\nunder the influence of English and American fashions, low heels had been\nintroduced generally without producing the results attributed to them\nby the learned Professor; moreover, it was said that the difference he\npretended to establish between the morals of the metropolis and those\nof the provinces is perhaps illusory, and that if it exists, it is\napparently due to the fact that great cities offer more advantages and\nfacilities for love than small towns provide. However that may be, the\nprovinces began to murmur against the Prime Minister, and to raise a\nscandal. This was not yet a danger, but there was a possibility that it\nmight become one.\n\nFor the moment the peril was nowhere and yet everywhere. The majority\nremained solid; but the leaders became stiff and exacting. Perhaps\nHippolyte Ceres would never have intentionally sacrificed his interests\nto his vengeance. But thinking that he could henceforth, without\ncompromising his own fortune, secretly damage that of Paul Visire, he\ndevoted himself to the skilful and careful preparation of difficulties\nand perils for the Head of the Government. Though far from equalling his\nrival in talent, knowledge, and authority, he greatly surpassed him in\nhis skill as a lobbyist. The most acute parliamentarians attributed\nthe recent misfortunes of the majority to his refusal to vote. At\ncommittees, by a calculated imprudence, he favoured motions which\nhe knew the Prime Minister could not accept. One day his intentional\nawkwardness provoked a sudden and violent conflict between the Minister\nof the Interior, and his departmental Treasurer. Then Ceres became\nfrightened and went no further. It would have been dangerous for him to\noverthrow the ministry too soon. His ingenious hatred found an issue by\ncircuitous paths. Paul Visire had a poor cousin of easy morals who bore\nhis name. Ceres, remembering this lady, Celine Visire, brought her\ninto prominence, arranged that she should become intimate with several\nforeigners, and procured her engagements in the music-halls. One summer\nnight, on a stage in the Champs Elysees before a tumultuous crowd, she\nperformed risky dances to the sounds of wild music which was audible\nin the gardens where the President of the Republic was entertaining\nRoyalty. The name of Visire, associated with these scandals, covered the\nwalls of the town, filled the newspapers, was repeated in the cafes and\nat balls, and blazed forth in letters of fire upon the boulevards.\n\nNobody regarded the Prime Minister as responsible for the scandal of\nhis relatives, but a bad idea of his family came into existence, and the\ninfluence of the statesman was diminished.\n\nAlmost immediately he was made to feel this in a pretty sharp fashion.\nOne day in the House, on a simple question, Labillette, the Minister of\nReligion and Public Worship, who was suffering from an attack of liver,\nand beginning to be exasperated by the intentions and intrigues of\nthe clergy, threatened to close the Chapel of St. Orberosia, and spoke\nwithout respect of the National Virgin. The entire Right rose up in\nindignation; the Left appeared to give but a half-hearted support to\nthe rash Minister. The leaders of the majority did not care to attack a\npopular cult which brought thirty millions a year into the country.\nThe most moderate of the supporters of the Right, M. Bigourd, made\nthe question the subject of a resolution and endangered the Cabinet.\nLuckily, Fortune Lapersonne, the Minister of Public Works, always\nconscious of the obligations of power, was able in the Prime Minister's\nabsence to repair the awkwardness and indecorum of his colleague, the\nMinister of Public Worship. He ascended the tribune and bore witness\nto the respect in which the Government held the heavenly Patron of\nthe country, the consoler of so many ills which science admitted its\npowerlessness to relieve.\n\nWhen Paul Visire, snatched at last from Eveline's arms, appeared in the\nHouse, the administration was saved; but the Prime Minister saw himself\ncompelled to grant important concessions to the upper classes. He\nproposed in Parliament that six armoured cruisers should be laid down,\nand thus won the sympathies of the Steel Trust; he gave new assurances\nthat the income tax would not be imposed, and he had eighteen Socialists\narrested.\n\nHe was soon to find himself opposed by more formidable obstacles. The\nChancellor of the neighbouring Empire in an ingenious and profound\nspeech upon the foreign relations of his sovereign, made a sly allusion\nto the intrigues that inspired the policy of a great country. This\nreference, which was receive with smiles by the Imperial Parliament,\nwas certain to irritate a punctilious republic. It aroused the national\nsusceptibility, which directed its wrath against its amorous\nMinister. The Deputies seized upon a frivolous pretext to show their\ndissatisfaction. A ridiculous incident, the fact that the wife of a\nsubprefect had danced at the Moulin Rouge, forced the minister to face\na vote of censure, and he was within a few votes of being defeated.\nAccording to general opinion, Paul Visire had never been so weak, so\nvacillating, or so spiritless, as on that occasion.\n\nHe understood that he could only keep himself in office by a great\npolitical stroke, and he decided on the expedition to Nigritia. This\nmeasure was demanded by the great financial and industrial corporations\nand was one which would bring concessions of immense forests to the\ncapitalists, a loan of eight millions to the banking companies, as well\nas promotions and decorations to the naval and military officers. A\npretext presented itself; some insult needed to be avenged, or some\ndebt to be collected. Six battleships, fourteen cruisers, and eighteen\ntransports sailed up the mouth of the river Hippopotamus. Six hundred\ncanoes vainly opposed the landing of the troops. Admiral Vivier des\nMurenes' cannons produced an appalling effect upon the blacks, who\nreplied to them with flights of arrows, but in spite of their fanatical\ncourage they were entirely defeated. Popular enthusiasm was kindled by\nthe newspapers which the financiers subsidised, and burst into a blaze.\nSome Socialists alone protested against this barbarous, doubtful, and\ndangerous enterprise. They were at once arrested.\n\nAt that moment when the Minister, supported by wealth, and now beloved\nby the poor, seemed unconquerable, the light of hate showed Hippolyte\nCeres alone the danger, and looking with a gloomy joy at his rival, he\nmuttered between his teeth, \"He is wrecked, the brigand!\"\n\nWhilst the country intoxicated itself with glory, the neighbouring\nEmpire protested against the occupation of Nigritia by a European\npower, and these protests following one another at shorter and\nshorter intervals became more and more vehement. The newspapers of the\ninterested Republic concealed all causes for uneasiness; but Hippolyte\nCeres heard the growing menace, and determined at last to risk\neverything, even the fate of the ministry, in order to ruin his enemy.\nHe got men whom he could trust to write and insert articles in several\nof the official journals, which, seeming to express Paul Visire's\nprecise views, attributed warlike intentions to the Head of the\nGovernment.\n\nThese articles roused a terrible echo abroad, and they alarmed the\npublic opinion of a nation which, while fond of soldiers, was not fond\nof war. Questioned in the House on the foreign policy of his government,\nPaul Visire made a re-assuring statement, and promised to maintain a\nface compatible with the dignity of a great nation. His Minister of\nForeign Affairs, Crombile, read a declaration which was absolutely\nunintelligible, for the reason that it was couched in diplomatic\nlanguage. The Minister obtained a large majority.\n\nBut the rumours of war did not cease, and in order to avoid a new and\ndangerous motion, the Prime Minister distributed eighty thousand acres\nof forests in Nigritia among the Deputies, and had fourteen Socialists\narrested. Hippolyte Ceres went gloomily about the lobbies, confiding to\nthe Deputies of his group that he was endeavouring to induce the Cabinet\nto adopt a pacific policy, and that he still hoped to succeed. Day by\nday the sinister rumours grew in volume, and penetrating amongst the\npublic, spread uneasiness and disquiet. Paul Visire himself began to\ntake alarm. What disturbed him most were the silence and absence of the\nMinister of Foreign Affairs. Crombile no longer came to the meetings of\nthe Cabinet. Rising at five o'clock in the morning, he worked eighteen\nhours at his desk, and at last fell exhausted into his waste-paper\nbasket, from whence the registrars removed him, together with the\npapers which they were going to sell to the military attaches of the\nneighbouring Empire.\n\nGeneral Debonnaire believed that a campaign was imminent, and prepared\nfor it. Far from fearing war, he prayed for it, and confided his\ngenerous hopes to Baroness Bildermann, who informed the neighbouring\nnation, which, acting on her information, proceeded to a rapid\nmobilization.\n\nThe Minister of Finance unintentionally precipitated events. At the\nmoment, he was speculating for a fall, and in order to bring about\na panic on the Stock Exchange, he spread the rumour that war was now\ninevitable. The neighbouring Empire, deceived by this action, and\nexpecting to see its territory invaded, mobilized its troops in all\nhaste. The terrified Chamber overthrew the Visire ministry by an\nenormous majority (814 votes to 7, with 28 abstentions). It was too\nlate. The very day of this fall the neighbouring and hostile nation\nrecalled its ambassador and flung eight millions of men into Madame\nCeres' country. War became universal, and the whole world was drowned in\na torrent of blood.\n\n\nTHE ZENITH OF PENGUIN CIVILIZATION\n\nHalf a century after the events we have just related, Madame Ceres died\nsurrounded with respect and veneration, in the eighty-ninth year of her\nage. She had long been the widow of a statesman whose name she bore with\ndignity. Her modest and quiet funeral was followed by the orphans of the\nparish and the sisters of the Sacred Compassion.\n\nThe deceased left all her property to the Charity of St. Orberosia.\n\n\"Alas!\" sighed M. Monnoyer, a canon of St. Mael, as he received the\npious legacy, \"it was high time for a generous benefactor to come to\nthe relief of our necessities. Rich and poor, learned and ignorant\nare turning away from us. And when we try to lead back these misguided\nsouls, neither threats nor promises, neither gentleness nor violence,\nnor anything else is now successful. The Penguin clergy pine in\ndesolation; our country priests, reduced to following the humblest of\ntrades, are shoeless, and compelled to live upon such scraps as they\ncan pick up. In our ruined churches the rain of heaven falls upon the\nfaithful, and during the holy offices they can hear the noise of stones\nfalling from the arches. The tower of the cathedral is tottering and\nwill soon fall. St. Orberosia is forgotten by the Penguins, her devotion\nabandoned, and her sanctuary deserted. On her shrine, bereft of its gold\nand precious stones, the spider silently weaves her web.\"\n\nHearing these lamentations, Pierre Mille, who at the age of ninety-eight\nyears had lost nothing of his intellectual and moral power, asked, the\ncanon if he did not think that St. Orberosia would one day rise out of\nthis wrongful oblivion.\n\n\"I hardly dare to hope so,\" sighed M. Monnoyer.\n\n\"It is a pity!\" answered Pierre Mille. \"Orberosia is a charming figure\nand her legend is a beautiful one. I discovered the other day by the\nmerest chance, one of her most delightful miracles, the miracle of Jean\nViolle. Would you like to hear it, M. Monnoyer?\"\n\n\"I should be very pleased, M. Mille.\"\n\n\"Here it is, then, just as I found it in a fifteenth-century manuscript\n\n\"Cecile, the wife of Nicolas Gaubert, a jeweller on the Pont-au-Change,\nafter having led an honest and chaste life for many years, and being\nnow past her prime, became infatuated with Jean Violle, the Countess de\nMaubec's page, who lived at the Hotel du Paon on the Place de Greve. He\nwas not yet eighteen years old, and his face and figure were attractive.\nNot being able to conquer her passion, Cecile resolved to satisfy it.\nShe attracted the page to her house, loaded him with caresses, supplied\nhim with sweetmeats and finally did as she wished with him.\n\n\"Now one day, as they were together in the jeweller's bed, Master\nNicholas came home sooner than he was expected. He found the bolt drawn,\nand heard his wife on the other side of the door exclaiming, 'My heart!\nmy angel! my love!' Then suspecting that she was shut up with a gallant,\nhe struck great blows upon the door and began to shout 'Slut! hussy!\nwanton! open so that I may cut off your nose and ears!' In this peril,\nthe jeweller's wife besought St. Orberosia, and vowed her a large candle\nif she helped her and the little page, who was dying of fear beside the\nbed, out of their difficulty.\n\n\"The saint heard the prayer. She immediately changed Jean Violle into\na girl. Seeing this, Cecile was completely reassured, and began to call\nout to her husband: 'Oh! you brutal villain, you jealous wretch! Speak\ngently if you want the door to be opened.' And scolding in this way, she\nran to the wardrobe and took out of it an old hood, a pair of stays,\nand a long grey petticoat, in which she hastily wrapped the transformed\npage. Then when this was done, 'Catherine, dear Catherine,' said she,\nloudly, 'open the door for your uncle; he is more fool than knave, and\nwon't do you any harm.' The boy who had become a girl, obeyed. Master\nNicholas entered the room and found in it a young maid whom he did not\nknow, and his wife in bed. 'Big booby,' said the latter to him, 'don't\nstand gaping at what you see, just as I had come to bed because had\na stomach ache, I received a visit from Catherine, the daughter of my\nsister Jeanne de Palaiseau, with whom we quarrelled fifteen years ago.\nKiss your niece. She is well worth the trouble.' The jeweller gave\nViolle a hug, and from that moment wanted nothing so much as to be alone\nwith her a moment, so that he might embrace her as much as he liked. For\nthis reason he led her without any delay down to the kitchen, under the\npretext of giving her some walnuts and wine, and he was no sooner there\nwith her than he began to caress her very affectionately. He would not\nhave stopped at that if St. Orberosia had not inspired his good wife\nwith the idea of seeing what he was about. She found him with the\npretended niece sitting on his knee. She called him a debauched\ncreature, boxed his ears, and forced him to beg her pardon. The next day\nViolle resumed his previous form.\"\n\nHaving heard this story the venerable Canon Monnoyer thanked Pierre\nMille for having told it, and, taking up his pen, began to write out\na list of horses that would win at the next race meeting. For he was a\nbook-maker's clerk.\n\nIn the mean time Penguinia gloried in its wealth. Those who produced the\nthings necessary for life, wanted them; those who did not produce them\nhad more than enough. \"But these,\" as a member of the Institute said,\n\"are necessary economic fatalities.\" The great Penguin people had no\nlonger either traditions, intellectual culture, or arts. The progress\nof civilisation manifested itself among them by murderous industry,\ninfamous speculation, and hideous luxury. Its capital assumed, as\ndid all the great cities of the time, a cosmopolitan and financial\ncharacter. An immense and regular ugliness reigned within it. The\ncountry enjoyed perfect tranquillity. It had reached its zenith.\n\n\n\n\n\nBOOK VIII. FUTURE TIMES\n\nTHE ENDLESS HISTORY\n\n\nAlca is becoming Americanised.--M.

I\n\nThe houses were never high enough to satisfy them; they kept on making\nthem still higher and built them of thirty or forty storeys: with\noffices, shops, banks, societies one above another; they dug cellars and\ntunnels ever deeper downwards.\n\nFifteen millions of men laboured in a giant town by the light of beacons\nwhich shed forth their glare both day and night. No light of heaven\npierced through the smoke of the factories with which the town was girt,\nbut sometimes the red disk of a rayless sun might be seen riding in the\nblack firmament through which iron bridges ploughed their way, and from\nwhich there descended a continual shower of soot and cinders. It was\nthe most industrial of all the cities in the world and the richest.\nIts organisation seemed perfect. None of the ancient aristocratic or\ndemocratic forms remained; everything was subordinated to the interests\nof the trusts. This environment gave rise to what anthropologists called\nthe multi-millionaire type. The men of this type were at once energetic\nand frail, capable of great activity in forming mental combinations\nand of prolonged labour in offices, but men whose nervous irritability\nsuffered from hereditary troubles which increased as time went on.\n\nLike all true aristocrats, like the patricians of republican Rome or the\nsquires of old England, these powerful men affected a great severity\nin their habits and customs. They were the ascetics of wealth. At the\nmeetings of the trusts an observer would have noticed their smooth and\npuffy faces, their lantern cheeks, their sunken eyes and wrinkled brows.\nWith bodies more withered, complexions yellower, lips drier, and eyes\nfilled with a more burning fanaticism than those of the old Spanish\nmonks, these multimillionaires gave themselves up with inextinguishable\nardour to the austerities of banking and industry. Several, denying\nthemselves all happiness, all pleasure, and all rest, spent their\nmiserable lives in rooms without light or air, furnished only with\nelectrical apparatus, living on eggs and milk, and sleeping on camp\nbeds. By doing nothing except pressing nickel buttons with their\nfingers, these mystics heaped up riches of which they never even saw the\nsigns, and acquired the vain possibility of gratifying desires that they\nnever experienced.\n\nThe worship of wealth had its martyrs. One of these multi-millionaires,\nthe famous Samuel Box, preferred to die rather than surrender the\nsmallest atom of his property. One of his workmen, the victim of an\naccident while at work, being refused any indemnity by his employer,\nobtained a verdict in the courts, but repelled by innumerable obstacles\nof procedure, he fell into the direst poverty. Being thus reduced to\ndespair, he succeeded by dint of cunning and audacity in confronting his\nemployer with a loaded revolver in his hand, and threatened to blow\nout his brains if he did not give him some assistance. Samuel Box gave\nnothing, and let himself be killed for the sake of principle.\n\nExamples that come from high quarters are followed. Those who possessed\nsome small capital (and they were necessarily the greater number),\naffected the ideas and habits of the multi-millionaires, in order\nthat they might be classed among them. All passions which injured the\nincrease or the preservation of wealth, were regarded as dishonourable;\nneither indolence, nor idleness, nor the taste for disinterested study,\nnor love of the arts, nor, above all, extravagance, was ever forgiven;\npity was condemned as a dangerous weakness. Whilst every inclination\nto licentiousness excited public reprobation, the violent and brutal\nsatisfaction of an appetite was, on the contrary, excused; violence, in\ntruth, was regarded as less injurious to morality, since it manifested\na form of social energy. The State was firmly based on two great public\nvirtues: respect for the rich and contempt for the poor. Feeble spirits\nwho were still moved by human suffering had no other resource than to\ntake refuge in a hypocrisy which it was impossible to blame, since\nit contributed to the maintenance of order and the solidity of\ninstitutions.\n\nThus, among the rich, all were devoted to their social order, or seemed\nto be so; all gave good examples, if all did not follow them. Some felt\nthe gravity of their position cruelly; but they endured it either from\npride or from duty. Some attempted, in secret and by subterfuge, to\nescape from it for a moment. One of these, Edward Martin, the President,\nof the Steel Trust, sometimes dressed himself as a poor man, went: forth\nto beg his bread, and allowed himself to be jostled by the passers-by.\nOne day, as he asked alms on a bridge, he engaged in a quarrel with a\nreal beggar, and filled with a fury of envy, he strangled him.\n\nAs they devoted their whole intelligence to business, they sought\nno intellectual pleasures. The theatre, which had formerly been very\nflourishing among them, was now reduced to pantomimes and comic dances.\nEven the pieces in which women acted were given up; the taste for pretty\nforms and brilliant toilettes had been lost; the somersaults of clowns\nand the music of negroes were preferred above them, and what roused\nenthusiasm was the sight of women upon the stage whose necks were\nbedizened with diamonds, or processions carrying golden bars in triumph.\nLadies of wealth were as much compelled as the men to lead a respectable\nlife. According to a tendency common to all civilizations, public\nfeeling set them up as symbols; they were, by their austere\nmagnificence, to represent both the splendour of wealth and its\nintangible. The old habits of gallantry had been reformed, Tut\nfashionable lovers were now secretly replaced by muscular labourers\nor stray grooms. Nevertheless, scandals were rare, a foreign journey\nconcealed nearly all of them, and the Princesses of the Trusts remained\nobjects of universal esteem.\n\nThe rich formed only a small minority, but their collaborators, who\ncomposed the entire people, had been completely won over or completely\nsubjugated by them. They formed two classes, the agents of commerce or\nbanking, and workers in the factories. The former contributed an immense\namount of work and received large salaries. Some of them succeeded in\nfounding establishments of their own; for in the constant increase of\nthe public wealth the more intelligent and audacious could hope for\nanything. Doubtless it would have been possible to find a certain\nnumber of discontented and rebellious persons among the immense crowd of\nengineers and accountants, but this powerful society had imprinted its\nfirm discipline even on the minds of its opponents. The very anarchists\nwere laborious and regular.\n\nAs for the workmen who toiled in the factories that surrounded the\ntown, their decadence, both physical and moral, was terrible; they were\nexamples of the type of poverty as it is set forth by anthropology.\nAlthough the development among them of certain muscles, due to the\nparticular nature of their work, might give a false idea of their\nstrength, they presented sure signs of morbid debility. Of low stature,\nwith small heads and narrow chests, they were further distinguished from\nthe comfortable classes by a multitude of physiological anomalies, and,\nin particular, by a common want of symmetry between the head and the\nlimbs. And they were destined to a gradual and continuous degeneration,\nfor the State made soldiers of the more robust among them, and the\nhealth of these did not long withstand the brothels and the drink-shops\nthat sprang up around their barracks. The proletarians became more\nand more feeble in mind. The continued weakening of their intellectual\nfaculties was not entirely due to their manner of life; it resulted also\nfrom a methodical selection carried out by the employers. The latter,\nfearing that workmen of too great ability might be inclined to put\nforward legitimate demands, took care to eliminate them by every\npossible means, and preferred to engage ignorant and stupid labourers,\nwho were incapable of defending their rights, but were yet intelligent\nenough to perform their toil, which highly perfected machines rendered\nextremely simple. Thus the proletarians were unable to do anything to\nimprove their lot. With difficulty did they succeed by means of strikes\nin maintaining the rate of their wages. Even this means began to fail\nthem. The alternations of production inherent in the capitalist system\ncaused such cessations of work that, in several branches of industry, as\nsoon as a strike was declared, the accumulation of products allowed\nthe employers to dispense with the strikers. In a word, these miserable\nemployees were plunged in a gloomy apathy that nothing enlightened and\nnothing exasperated. They were necessary instruments for the social\norder and well adapted to their purpose.\n\nUpon the whole, this social order seemed the most firmly established\nthat had yet been seen, at least amon kind, for that of bees and ants is\nincomparably more stable. Nothing could foreshadow the ruin of a system\nfounded on what is strongest in human nature, pride and cupidity.\nHowever, keen observers discovered several grounds for uneasiness. The\nmost certain, although the least apparent, were of an economic order,\nand consisted in the continually increasing amount of over-production,\nwhich entailed long and cruel interruptions of labour, though these\nwere, it is true, utilized by the manufacturers as a means of breaking\nthe power of the workmen, by facing them with the prospect of a\nlock-out. A more obvious peril resulted from the physiological state of\nalmost the entire population. \"The health of the poor is what it must\nbe,\" said the experts in hygiene, \"but that of the rich leaves much to\nbe desired.\" It was not difficult to find the causes of this. The supply\nof oxygen necessary for life was insufficient in the city, and men\nbreathed in an artificial air. The food trusts, by means of the most\ndaring chemical syntheses, produced artificial wines, meat, milk, fruit,\nand vegetables, and the diet thus imposed gave rise to stomach and brain\ntroubles. The multi-millionaires were bald at the age of eighteen; some\nshowed from time to time a dangerous weakness of mind. Over-strung and\nenfeebled, they gave enormous sums to ignorant charlatans; and it was a\ncommon thing for some bath-attendant or other trumpery who turned healer\nor prophet, to make a rapid fortune by the practice of medicine or\ntheology. The number of lunatics increased continually; suicides\nmultiplied in the world of wealth, and many of them were accompanied\nby atrocious and extraordinary circumstances, which bore witness to an\nunheard o perversion of intelligence and sensibility.\n\nAnother fatal symptom created a strong impression upon average minds.\nTerrible accidents, henceforth periodical and regular, entered\ninto people's calculations, and kept mounting higher and higher in\nstatistical tables. Every day, machines burst into fragments, houses\nfell down, trains laden with merchandise fell on to the streets,\ndemolishing entire buildings and crushing hundreds of passers-by.\nThrough the ground, honey-combed with tunnels, two or three storeys of\nwork-shops would often crash, engulfing all those who worked in them.\n\nS. 2\n\nIn the southwestern district of the city, on an eminence which had\npreserved its ancient name of Fort Saint-Michel, there stretched a\nsquare where some old trees still spread their exhausted arms above the\ngreensward. Landscape gardeners had constructed a cascade, grottos, a\ntorrent, a lake, and an island, on its northern slope. From this side\none could see the whole town with its streets, its boulevards, its\nsquares, the multitude of its roofs and domes, its air-passages, and its\ncrowds of men, covered with a veil of silence, and seemingly enchanted\nby the distance. This square was the healthiest place in the capital;\nhere no smoke obscured the sky, and children were brought here to play.\nIn summer some employees from the neighbouring offices and laboratories\nused to resort to it for a moment after their luncheons, but they did\nnot disturb its solitude and peace.\n\nIt was owing to this custom that, one day in June, about mid-day, a\ntelegraph clerk, Caroline Meslier, came and sat down on a bench at the\nend of a terrace. In order to refresh her eyes by the sight of a little\ngreen, she turned her back to the town. Dark, with brown eyes, robust\nand placid, Caroline appeared to be from twenty-five to twenty-eight\nyears of age. Almost immediately, a clerk in the Electricity Trust,\nGeorge Clair, took his place beside her. Fair, thin, and supple, he had\nfeatures of a feminine delicacy; he was scarcely older than she, and\nlooked still younger. As they met almost every day in this place,\na comradeship had sprung up between them, and they enjoyed chatting\ntogether. But their conversation had never been tender, affectionate, or\neven intimate. Caroline, although it had happened to her in the past to\nrepent of her confidence, might perhaps have been less reserved had\nnot George Clair always shown himself extremely restrained in his\nexpressions and behaviour. He always gave a purely intellectual\ncharacter to the conversation, keeping it within the realm of general\nideas, and, moreover, expressing himself on all subjects with the\ngreatest freedom. He spoke frequently of the organization of society,\nand the conditions of labour.\n\n\"Wealth,\" said he, \"is one of the means of living happily; but people\nhave made it the sole end of existence.\"\n\nAnd this state of things seemed monstrous to both of them.\n\nThey returned continually to various scientific subjects with which they\nwere both familiar.\n\nOn that day they discussed the evolution of chemistry.\n\n\"From the moment,\" said Clair, \"that radium was seen to be transformed\ninto helium, people ceased to affirm the immutability of simple bodies;\nin this way all those old laws about simple relations and about the\nindestructibility of matter were abolished.\"\n\n\"However,\" said she, \"chemical laws exist.\"\n\nFor, being a woman, she had need of belief.\n\nHe resumed carelessly:\n\n\"Now that we can procure radium in sufficient quantities, science\npossesses incomparable means of analysis; even at present we get\nglimpses, within what are called simple bodies, of extremely diversified\ncomplex ones, and we discover energies in matter which seem to increase\neven by reason of its tenuity.\"\n\nAs they talked, they threw bits of bread to the birds, and some children\nplayed around them.\n\nPassing from one subject to another:\n\n\"This hill, in the quaternary epoch,\" said Clair, \"was inhabited by wild\nhorses. Last year, as they were tunnelling for the water mains, they\nfound a layer of the bones of primeval horses.\"\n\nShe was anxious to know whether, at that distant epoch, man had yet\nappeared.\n\nHe told her that man used to hunt the primeval horse long before he\ntried to domesticate him.\n\n\"Man,\" he added, \"was at first a hunter, then he became a shepherd,\na cultivator, a manufacturer . . . and these diverse civilizations\nsucceeded each other at intervals of time that the mind cannot\nconceive.\"\n\nHe took out his watch.\n\nCaroline asked if it was already time to go back to the office.\n\nHe said it was not, that it was scarcely half-past twelve.\n\nA little girl was making mud pies at the foot of their bench; a little\nboy of seven or eight years was playing in front of them. Whilst his\nmother was sewing on an adjoining bench, he played all alone at being a\nrun-away horse, and with that power of illusion, of which children are\ncapable, he imagined that he was at the same time the horse, and those\nwho ran after him, and those who fled in terror before him. He kept\nstruggling with himself and shouting: \"Stop him, Hi! Hi! This is an\nawful horse, he has got the bit between his teeth.\"\n\nCaroline asked the question:\n\n\"Do you think that men were happy formerly?\"\n\nHer companion answered:\n\n\"They suffered less when they were younger. They acted like that little\nboy: they played; they played at arts, at virtues, at vices, at heroism,\nat beliefs, at pleasures; they had illusions which entertained them;\nthey made a noise; they amused themselves. But now. . . .\"\n\nHe interrupted himself, and looked again at his watch.\n\nThe child, who was running, struck his foot against the little girl's\npail, and fell his full length on the gravel. He remained a moment\nstretched out motionless, then raised himself up on the palms of his\nhands. His forehead puckered, his mouth opened, and he burst into tears.\nHis mother ran up, but Caroline had lifted him from the ground and was\nwiping his eyes and mouth with her handkerchief.\n\nThe child kept on sobbing and Clair took him in his arms.\n\n\"Come, don't cry, my little man! I am going to tell you a story.\n\n\"A fisherman once threw his net into the sea and drew out a little,\nsealed, copper pot, which he opened with his knife. Smoke came out\nof it, and as it mounted up to the clouds the smoke grew thicker and\nthicker and became a giant who gave such a terrible yawn that the whole\nworld was blown to dust.\"\n\nClair stopped himself, gave a dry laugh, and handed the child back to\nhis mother. Then he took out his watch again, and kneeling on the bench\nwith his elbows resting on its back he gazed at the town. As far as\nthe eye could reach, the multitude of houses stood out in their tiny\nimmensity.\n\nCaroline turned her eyes in the same direction.\n\n\"What splendid weather it is!\" said she. \"The sun's rays change the\nsmoke on the horizon into gold. The worst thing about civilization is\nthat it deprives one of the light of day.\"\n\nWe did not answer; his looks remained fixed on a place in the town.\n\nAfter some seconds of silence they saw about half a mile away, in the\nricher district on the other side of the river, a sort of tragic fog\nrearing itself upwards. A moment afterwards an explosion was heard even\nwhere they were sitting, and an immense tree of smoke mounted towards\nthe pure sky. Little by little the air was filled with an imperceptible\nmurmur caused by the shouts of thousands of men. Cries burst forth quite\nclose to the square.\n\n\"What has been blown up?\"\n\nThe bewilderment was great, for although accidents were common, such\na violent explosion as this one had never been seen, and everybody\nperceived that something terribly strange had happened.\n\nAttempts were made to locate the place of the accident; districts,\nstreets, different buildings, clubs, theatres, and shops were mentioned.\nInformation gradually became more precise and at last the truth was\nknown.\n\n\"The Steel Trust has just been blown up.\"\n\nClair put his watch back into his pocket.\n\nCaroline looked at him closely and her eyes filled with astonishment.\n\nAt last she whispered in his ear:\n\n\"Did you know it? Were you expecting it? Was it you . . . ?\"\n\nHe answered very calmly:\n\n\"That town ought to be destroyed.\"\n\nShe replied in a gentle and thoughtful tone:\n\n\"I think so too.\"\n\nAnd both of them returned quietly to their work.\n\n\nS. 3\n\nFrom that day onward, anarchist attempts followed one another every week\nwithout interruption. The victims were numerous, and almost all of them\nbelonged to the poorer classes. These crimes roused public resentment.\nIt was among domestic servants, hotel-keepers, and the employees of such\nsmall shops as the Trusts still allowed to exist, that indignation\nburst forth most vehemently. In popular districts women might be heard\ndemanding unusual punishments for the dynamitards. (They were called\nby this old name, although it was hardly appropriate to them, since, to\nthese unknown chemists, dynamite was an innocent material only fit to\ndestroy ant-hills, and they considered it mere child's play to explode\nnitro-glycerine with a cartridge made of fulminate of mercury.) Business\nceased suddenly, and those who were least rich were the first to feel\nthe effects. They spoke of doing justice themselves to the anarchists.\nIn the mean time the factory workers remained hostile or indifferent\nto violent action. They were threatened, as a result of the decline of\nbusiness, with a likelihood of losing their work, or even a lock-out\nin all the factories. The Federation of Trade Unions proposed a general\nstrike as the most powerful means of influencing the employers, and the\nbest aid that could be given to the revolutionists, but all the trades\nwith the exception of the gliders refused to cease work.\n\nThe police made numerous arrests. Troops summoned from all parts of the\nNational Federation protected the offices of the Trusts, the houses of\nthe multi-millionaires, the public halls, the banks, and the big shops.\nA fortnight passed without a single explosion, and it was concluded that\nthe dynamitards, in all probability but a handful of persons, perhaps\neven Still fewer, had all been killed or captured, or that they were in\nhiding, or had taken flight. Confidence returned; it returned at first\namong the poorer classes. Two or three hundred thousand soldiers, who\nbad been lodged in the most closely populated districts, stimulated\ntrade, and people began to cry out: \"Hurrah for the army!\"\n\nThe rich, who had not been so quick to take alarm, were reassured more\nslowly. But at the Stock Exchange a group of \"bulls\" spread optimistic\nrumours and by a powerful effort put a brake upon the fall in prices.\nBusiness improved. Newspapers with big circulations supported the\nmovement. With patriotic eloquence they depicted capital as laughing in\nits impregnable position at the assaults of a few dastardly criminals,\nand public wealth maintaining its serene ascendency in spite of the vain\nthreats made against it. They were sincere in their attitude, though at\nthe same time they found it benefited them. Outrages were forgotten or\ntheir occurrence denied. On Sundays, at the race-meetings, the stands\nwere adorned by women covered with pearls and diamonds. It was observed\nwith joy that the capitalists had not suffered. Cheers were given for\nthe multi-millionaires in the saddling rooms.\n\nOn the following day the Southern Railway Station, the Petroleum Trust,\nand the huge church built at the expense of Thomas Morcellet were all\nblown up. Thirty houses were in flames, and the beginning of a fire\nwas discovered at the docks. The firemen showed amazing intrepidity and\nzeal. They managed their tall fire-escapes with automatic precision,\nand climbed as high as thirty storeys to rescue the luckless inhabitants\nfrom the flames. The soldiers performed their duties with spirit, and\nwere given a double ration of coffee. But these fresh casualties started\na panic. Millions of people, who wanted to take their money with them\nand leave the town at once, crowded the great banking houses. These\nestablishments, after paying out money for three days, closed their\ndoors amid mutterings of a riot. A crowd of fugitives, laden with their\nbaggage, besieged the railway stations and took the town by storm. Many\nwho were anxious to lay in a stock of provisions and take refuge in\nthe cellars, attacked the grocery stores, although they were guarded by\nsoldiers with fixed bayonets. The public authorities displayed energy.\nNumerous arrests were made and thousands of warrants issued against\nsuspected persons.\n\nDuring the three weeks that followed no outrage was committed. There was\na rumour that bombs had been found in the Opera House, in the cellars of\nthe Town Hall, and beside one of the Pillars of the Stock Exchange. But\nit was soon known that these were boxes of sweets that had been put in\nthose places by practical jokers or lunatics. One of the accused, when\nquestioned by a magistrate, declared that he was the chief author of\nthe explosions, and said that all his accomplices had lost their\nlives. These confessions were published by the newspapers and helped\nto reassure public opinion. It was only towards the close of the\nexamination that the magistrates saw they had to deal with a pretender\nwho was in no way connected with any of the crimes.\n\nThe experts chosen by the courts discovered nothing that enabled them to\ndetermine the engine employed in the work of destruction. According to\ntheir conjectures the new explosive emanated from a gas which radium\nevolves, and it was supposed that electric waves, produced by a special\ntype of oscillator, were propagated through space and thus caused the\nexplosion. But even the ablest chemist could say nothing precise or\ncertain. At last two policemen, who were passing in front of the Hotel\nMeyer, found on the pavement, close to a ventilator, an egg made of\nwhite metal and provided with a capsule at each end. They picked it\nup carefully, and, on the orders of their chief, carried it to the\nmunicipal laboratory. Scarcely had the experts assembled to examine it,\nthan the egg burst and blew up the amphitheatre and the dome. All the\nexperts perished, and with them Collin, the General of Artillery, and\nthe famous Professor Tigre.\n\nThe capitalist society did not allow itself to be daunted by this fresh\ndisaster. The great banks re-opened their doors, declaring that\nthey would meet demands partly in bullion and partly in paper money\nguaranteed by the State: The Stock Exchange and the Trade Exchange,\nin spite of the complete cessation of business, decided not to suspend\ntheir sittings.\n\nIn the mean time the magisterial investigation into the case of those\nwho had been first accused had come to an end. Perhaps the evidence\nbrought against them might have appeared insufficient under other\ncircumstances, but the zeal both of the magistrates and the public made\nup for this insufficiency. On the eve of the day fixed for the trial the\nCourts of justice were blown up and eight hundred people were killed,\nthe greater number of them being judges and lawyers. A furious crowd\nbroke into the prison and lynched the prisoners. The troops sent to\nrestore order were received with showers of stones and revolver shots;\nseveral soldiers being dragged from their horses and trampled underfoot.\nThe soldiers fired on the mob and many persons were killed. At last the\npublic authorities succeeded in establishing tranquillity. Next day the\nBank was blown up.\n\nFrom that time onwards unheard-of things took place. The factory\nworkers, who had refused to strike, rushed in crowds into the town and\nset fire to the houses. Entire regiments, led by their officers, joined\nthe workmen, went with them through the town singing revolutionary\nhymns, and took barrels of petroleum from the docks with which to feed\nthe fires. Explosions were continual. One morning a monstrous tree of\nsmoke, like the ghost of a huge palm tree half a mile in height, rose\nabove the giant Telegraph Hall which suddenly fell into a complete ruin.\n\nWhilst half the town was in flames, the other half pursued its\naccustomed life. In the mornings, milk pails could be heard jingling\nin the dairy carts. In a deserted avenue some old navvy might be seen\nseated against a wall slowly eating hunks of bread with perhaps a little\nmeat. Almost all the presidents of the trusts remained at their posts.\nSome of them performed their duty with heroic simplicity. Raphael\nBox, the son of a martyred multi-millionaire, was blown up as he was\npresiding at the general meeting of the Sugar Trust. He was given a\nmagnificent funeral and the procession on its way to the cemetery had\nto climb six times over piles of ruins or cross upon planks over the\nuprooted roads.\n\nThe ordinary helpers of the rich, the clerks, employees, brokers, and\nagents, preserved an unshaken fidelity. The surviving clerks of the Bank\nthat had been blown up, made their way along the ruined streets through\nthe midst of smoking houses to hand in their bills of exchange, and\nseveral were swallowed up in the flames while endeavouring to present\ntheir receipts.\n\nNevertheless, any illusion concerning the state of affairs was\nimpossible. The enemy was master of the town. Instead of silence the\nnoise of explosions was now continuous and produced an insurmountable\nfeeling of horror. The lighting apparatus having been destroyed, the\ncity was plunged in darkness all through the night, and appalling crimes\nwere committed. The populous districts alone, having suffered the least,\nstill preserved measures of protection. The were paraded by patrols of\nvolunteers who shot the robbers, and at every street corner one stumbled\nover a body lying in a pool of blood, the hands bound behind the back, a\nhandkerchief over the face, and a placard pinned upon the breast.\n\nIt became impossible to clear away the ruins or to bury the dead. Soon\nthe stench from the corpses became intolerable. Epidemics raged and\ncaused innumerable deaths, while they also rendered the survivors feeble\nand listless. Famine carried off almost all who were left. A hundred\nand one days after the first outrage, whilst six army corps with field\nartillery and siege artillery were marching, at night, into the poorest\nquarter of the city, Caroline and Clair, holding each other's hands,\nwere watching from the roof a lofty house, the only one still left\nstanding, but now surrounded by smoke and flame, joyous songs ascended\nfrom the street, where the crowd was dancing in delirium.\n\n\"To-morrow it will be ended,\" said the man, \"and it will be better.\"\n\nThe young woman, her hair loosened and her face shining with the\nreflection of the flames, gazed with a pious joy at the circle of fire\nthat was growing closer around them.\n\n\"It will be better,\" said she also.\n\nAnd throwing herself into the destroyer's arms she pressed a passionate\nkiss upon his lips.\n\nS. 4\n\nThe other towns of the federation also suffered from disturbances and\noutbreaks, and then order was restored. Reforms were introduced into\ninstitutions and great changes took place in habits and customs, but the\ncountry never recovered the loss of its capital, and never regained its\nformer prosperity. Commerce and industry dwindled away, and civilization\nabandoned those countries which for so long it bad preferred to all\nothers. They became insalubrious and sterile; the territory that had\nsupported so many millions of men became nothing more than a desert. On\nthe hill of Fort St. Michel wild horses cropped the coarse grass.\n\nDays flowed by like water from the fountains, and the centuries passed\nlike drops falling from the ends of stalactites. Hunters came to chase\nthe bears upon the hills that covered the forgotten city; shepherds led\ntheir flocks upon them; labourers turned up the soil with their ploughs;\ngardeners cultivated their lettuces and grafted their pear trees. They\nwere not rich, and they had no arts. The walls of their cabins were\ncovered with old vines and roses, A goat-skin clothed their tanned\nlimbs, while their wives dressed themselves with the wool that they\nthemselves had spun. The goat-herds moulded little figures of men and\nanimals out of clay, or sang songs about the young girl who follows her\nlover through woods or among the browsing goats while the pine trees\nwhisper together and the water utters its murmuring sound. The master of\nthe house grew angry with the beetles who devoured his figs; he planned\nsnares to protect his fowls from the velvet-tailed fox, and he poured\nout wine for his neighbours saying:\n\n\"Drink! The flies have not spoilt my vintage; the vines were dry before\nthey came.\"\n\nThen in the course of ages the wealth of the villages and the corn\nthat filled the fields were pillaged by barbarian invaders. The country\nchanged its masters several times. The conquerors built castles upon the\nhills; cultivation increased; mills, forges, tanneries, and looms were\nestablished; roads were opened through the woods and over the marshes;\nthe river was covered with boats. The hamlets became large villages and\njoining together formed a town which protected itself by deep trenches\nand lofty walls. Later, becoming the capital of a great State, it found\nitself straitened within its now useless ramparts and it converted them\ninto grass-covered walks.\n\nIt grew very rich and large beyond measure. The houses were never high\nenough to satisfy the people; they kept on making them still higher\nand built them of thirty or forty storeys, with offices, shops, banks,\nsocieties one above another; they dug cellars and tunnels ever deeper\ndownwards. Fifteen millions of men laboured in the giant town.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Penguin Island, by Anatole France\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK PENGUIN ISLAND ***\n\n***** This file should be named 1930.txt or 1930.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/1\/9\/3\/1930\/\n\nProduced by Aaron Cannon and David Widger\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http:\/\/www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http:\/\/pglaf.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":150,"split":"train"}
