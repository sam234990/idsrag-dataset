Dissatisfied with his life in fashionable London circles, he instead leaves his parents and retraces the steps of his Crusader ancestors to the Holy Land, hoping there to \"penetrate the great Asian mystery\"  and understand the roots of Christianity. He meets the beautiful Eva, daughter of a Jewish financier, and becomes involved in the political machinations of her foster-brother, the brilliant Fakredeen, a Lebanese emir. At Fakredeen's instigation Tancred is kidnapped and held captive, but is nevertheless allowed to visit Mount Sinai. Here he has a vision of an angel who tells him he must be the prophet of \"the sublime and solacing doctrine of theocratic equality\", a concept which Disraeli leaves somewhat hazy. Tancred falls ill, and is released at the instigation of Eva, who nurses him back to health. She teaches him about the glories of Mediterranean civilization and the debt that Christianity owes to Judaism. Tancred, in love with Eva and utterly convinced that she is right, proposes marriage, but the romance is broken off when his parents appear to reclaim their son and take him back to England.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg EBook of Tancred, by Benjamin Disraeli\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

Sometimes a group of courts develops itself, and\nyou may even chance to find your way into a small market-place. Those,\nhowever, who are accustomed to connect these hidden residences of\nthe humble with scenes of misery and characters of violence, need not\napprehend in this district any appeal to their sympathies, or any shock\nto their tastes. All is extremely genteel; and there is almost as much\nrepose as in the golden saloons of the contiguous palaces. At any rate,\nif there be as much vice, there is as little crime.\n\nNo sight or sound can be seen or heard at any hour, which could pain the\nmost precise or the most fastidious. Even if a chance oath may float on\nthe air from the stable-yard to the lodging of a French cook, \u00e2\u0080\u0098tis of\nthe newest fashion, and, if responded to with less of novel charm, the\nrepartee is at least conveyed in the language of the most polite of\nnations. They bet upon the Derby in these parts a little, are interested\nin Goodwood, which they frequent, have perhaps, in general, a weakness\nfor play, live highly, and indulge those passions which luxury and\nrefinement encourage; but that is all.\n\nA policeman would as soon think of reconnoitring these secluded streets\nas of walking into a house in Park Lane or Berkeley Square, to which,\nin fact, this population in a great measure belongs. For here reside the\nwives of house-stewards and of butlers, in tenements furnished by the\nhonest savings of their husbands, and let in lodgings to increase their\nswelling incomes; here dwells the retired servant, who now devotes\nhis practised energies to the occasional festival, which, with his\naccumulations in the three per cents., or in one of the public-houses of\nthe quarter, secures him at the same time an easy living, and the casual\nenjoyment of that great world which lingers in his memory. Here may be\nfound his grace\u00e2\u0080\u0099s coachman, and here his lordship\u00e2\u0080\u0099s groom, who keeps a\nbook and bleeds periodically too speculative footmen, by betting odds\non his master\u00e2\u0080\u0099s horses. But, above all, it is in this district that\nthe cooks have ever sought a favourite and elegant abode. An air of\nstillness and serenity, of exhausted passions and suppressed emotion,\nrather than of sluggishness and of dullness, distinguishes this quarter\nduring the day.\n\nWhen you turn from the vitality and brightness of Piccadilly, the\npark, the palace, the terraced mansions, the sparkling equipages, the\ncavaliers cantering up the hill, the swarming multitude, and enter\nthe region of which we are speaking, the effect is at first almost\nunearthly. Not a carriage, not a horseman, scarcely a passenger; there\nseems some great and sudden collapse in the metropolitan system, as if\na pest had been announced, or an enemy were expected in alarm by a\nvanquished capital. The approach from Curzon Street has not this effect.\nHyde Park has still about it something of Arcadia. There are woods and\nwaters, and the occasional illusion of an illimitable distance of sylvan\njoyance. The spirit is allured to gentle thoughts as we wander in what\nis still really a lane, and, turning down Stanhope Street, behold that\nhouse which the great Lord Chesterfield tells us, in one of his letters,\nhe was \u00e2\u0080\u0098building among the fields.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 The cawing of the rooks in his\ngardens sustains the tone of mind, and Curzon Street, after a long,\nstraggling, sawney course, ceasing to be a thoroughfare, and losing\nitself in the gardens of another palace, is quite in keeping with all\nthe accessories.\n\nIn the night, however, the quarter of which we are speaking is alive.\nThe manners of the population follow those of their masters. They keep\nlate hours. The banquet and the ball dismiss them to their homes at a\ntime when the trades of ordinary regions move in their last sleep, and\ndream of opening shutters and decking the windows of their shops.\n\nAt night, the chariot whirls round the frequent corners of these little\nstreets, and the opening valves of the mews vomit forth their legion\nof broughams. At night, too, the footman, taking advantage of a ball\nat Holdernesse, or a concert at Lansdowne House, and knowing that,\nin either instance, the link-boy will answer when necessary for his\nsummoned name, ventures to look in at his club, reads the paper, talks\nof his master or his mistress, and perhaps throws a main. The shops of\nthis district, depending almost entirely for their custom on the classes\nwe have indicated, and kept often by their relations, follow the order\nof the place, and are most busy when other places of business are\nclosed.\n\nA gusty March morning had subsided into a sunshiny afternoon, nearly two\nyears ago, when a young man, slender, above the middle height, with a\nphysiognomy thoughtful yet delicate, his brown hair worn long, slight\nwhiskers, on his chin a tuft, knocked at the door of a house in\nCarrington Street, May Fair. His mien and his costume denoted a\ncharacter of the class of artists. He wore a pair of green trousers,\nbraided with a black stripe down their sides, puckered towards the\nwaist, yet fitting with considerable precision to the boot of French\nleather that enclosed a well-formed foot. His waistcoat was of maroon\nvelvet, displaying a steel watch-chain of refined manufacture, and a\nblack satin cravat, with a coral brooch. His bright blue frockcoat was\nfrogged and braided like his trousers. As the knocker fell from the\nprimrose-coloured glove that screened his hand, he uncovered, and\npassing his fingers rapidly through his hair, resumed his new silk hat,\nwhich he placed rather on one side of his head.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Ah! Mr. Leander, is it you?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 exclaimed a pretty girl, who opened the\ndoor and blushed.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098And how is the good papa, Eugenie? Is he at home? For I want to see him\nmuch.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I will show you up to him at once, Mr. Leander, for he will be very\nhappy to see you. We have been thinking of hearing of you,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 she added,\ntalking as she ushered her guest up the narrow staircase. \u00e2\u0080\u0098The good papa\nhas a little cold: \u00e2\u0080\u0098tis not much, I hope; caught at Sir Wallinger\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, a\nlarge dinner; they would have the kitchen windows open, which spoilt all\nthe entr\u00c3\u00a9es, and papa got a cold; but I think, perhaps, it is as much\nvexation as anything else, you know if anything goes wrong, especially\nwith the entr\u00c3\u00a9es------\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098He feels as a great artist must,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Leander, finishing her sentence.\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098However, I am not sorry at this moment to find him a prisoner, for I\nam pressed to see him. It is only this morning that I have returned from\nMr. Coningsby\u00e2\u0080\u0099s at Hellingsley: the house full, forty covers every\nday, and some judges. One does not grudge one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s labour if we are\nappreciated,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 added Leander; \u00e2\u0080\u0098but I have had my troubles. One of my\nmarmitons has disappointed me: I thought I had a genius, but on the\nthird day he lost his head; and had it not been---- Ah! good papa,\u00e2\u0080\u0099\nhe exclaimed, as the door opened, and he came forward and warmly shook\nthe hand of a portly man, advanced in middle life, sitting in an easy\nchair, with a glass of sugared water by his side, and reading a French\nnewspaper in his chamber robe, and with a white cotton nightcap on his\nhead.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Ah! my child,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Papa Prevost, \u00e2\u0080\u0098is it you? You see me a prisoner;\nEugenie has told you; a dinner at a merchant\u00e2\u0080\u0099s; dressed in a draught;\neverything spoiled, and I------\u00e2\u0080\u0099 and sighing, Papa Prevost sipped his\n_eau sucr\u00c3\u00a9e_.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098We have all our troubles,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Leander, in a consoling tone; \u00e2\u0080\u0098but\nwe will not speak now of vexations. I have just come from the country;\nDaubuz has written to me twice; he was at my house last night; I found\nhim on my steps this morning. There is a grand affair on the tapis.\nThe son of the Duke of Bellamont comes of age at Easter; it is to be a\nbusiness of the thousand and one nights; the whole county to be feasted.\nCamacho\u00e2\u0080\u0099s wedding will do for the peasantry; roasted oxen, and a\ncapon in every platter, with some fountains of ale and good Porto. Our\nmarmitons, too, can easily serve the provincial noblesse; but there is\nto be a party at the Castle, of double cream; princes of the blood,\nhigh relatives and grandees of the Golden Fleece. The duke\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cook is not\nequal to the occasion. \u00e2\u0080\u0098Tis an hereditary chef who gives dinners of the\ntime of the continental blockade. They have written to Daubuz to send\nthem the first artist of the age,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Leander; \u00e2\u0080\u0098and,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 added he, with\nsome hesitation, \u00e2\u0080\u0098Daubuz has written to me.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098And he did quite right, my child,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Prevost, \u00e2\u0080\u0098for there is not a\nman in Europe that is your equal. What do they say? That Abreu rivals\nyou in flavour, and that Gaillard has not less invention. But who can\ncombine _go\u00c3\u00bbt_ with new combinations? \u00e2\u0080\u0098Tis yourself, Leander; and there\nis no question, though you have only twenty-five years, that you are the\nchef of the age.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098You are always very good to me, sir,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Leander, bending his head\nwith great respect; \u00e2\u0080\u0098and I will not deny that to be famous when you are\nyoung is the fortune of the gods. But we must never forget that I had an\nadvantage which Abreu and Gaillard had not, and that I was your pupil.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I hope that I have not injured you,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Papa Prevost, with an air of\nproud self-content. \u00e2\u0080\u0098What you learned from me came at least from a good\nschool. It is something to have served under Napoleon,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 added Prevost,\nwith the grand air of the Imperial kitchen. \u00e2\u0080\u0098Had it not been for\nWaterloo, I should have had the cross. But the Bourbons and the cooks\nof the Empire never could understand each other: They brought over an\nemigrant chef, who did not comprehend the taste of the age. He wished to\nbring everything back to the time of the _oeil de bouf_. When Monsieur\npassed my soup of Austerlitz untasted, I knew the old family was doomed.\nBut we gossip. You wished to consult me?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I want not only your advice but your assistance. This affair of the\nDuke of Bellamont requires all our energies. I hope you will accompany\nme; and, indeed, we must muster all our forces. It is not to be denied\nthat there is a want, not only of genius, but of men, in our art. The\ncooks are like the civil engineers: since the middle class have taken to\ngiving dinners, the demand exceeds the supply.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098There is Andrien,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Papa Prevost; \u00e2\u0080\u0098you had some hopes of him?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098He is too young; I took him to Hellingsley, and he lost his head on\nthe third day. I entrusted the souffl\u00c3\u00a9es to him, and, but for the most\ndesperate personal exertions, all would have been lost. It was an affair\nof the bridge of Areola.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Ah! _mon Dieu!_ those are moments!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 exclaimed Prevost. \u00e2\u0080\u0098Gaillard and\nAbreu will not serve under you, eh? And if they would, they could not be\ntrusted. They would betray you at the tenth hour.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098What I want are generals of division, not commanders-in-chief. Abreu is\nsufficiently _bon gar\u00c3\u00a7on_, but he has taken an engagement with Monsieur\nde Sidonia, and is not permitted to go out.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098With Monsieur de Sidonia! You once thought of that, my Leander. And\nwhat is his salary?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Not too much; four hundred and some perquisites. It would not suit me;\nbesides, I will take no engagement but with a crowned head. But Abreu\nlikes travelling, and he has his own carriage, which pleases him.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098There are Philippon and Dumoreau,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Prevost; \u00e2\u0080\u0098they are very safe.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I was thinking of them,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Leander, \u00e2\u0080\u0098they are safe, under you.\nAnd there is an Englishman, Smit, he is chef at Sir Stanley\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, but his\nmaster is away at this moment. He has talent.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Yourself, four chefs, with your marmitons; it would do,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Prevost.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098For the kitchen,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Leander; \u00e2\u0080\u0098but who is to dress the tables?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098A-h!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 exclaimed Papa Prevost, shaking his head.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Daubuz\u00e2\u0080\u0099 head man, Trenton, is the only one I could trust; and he wants\nfancy, though his style is broad and bold. He made a pyramid of pines\nrelieved with grapes, without destroying the outline, very good, this\nlast week, at Hellingsley. But Trenton has been upset on the railroad,\nand much injured. Even if he recover, his hand will tremble so for the\nnext month that! could have no confidence in him.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Perhaps you might find some one at the Duke\u00e2\u0080\u0099s?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Out of the question!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Leander; \u00e2\u0080\u0098I make it always a condition\nthat the head of every department shall be appointed by myself. I take\nPellerini with me for the confectionery. How often have I seen the\neffect of a first-rate dinner spoiled by a vulgar dessert! laid flat on\nthe table, for example, or with ornaments that look as if they had been\nhired at a pastrycook\u00e2\u0080\u0099s: triumphal arches, and Chinese pagodas, and\nsolitary pines springing up out of ice-tubs surrounded with peaches, as\nif they were in the window of a fruiterer of Covent Garden.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Ah! it is incredible what uneducated people will do,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Prevost.\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098The dressing of the tables was a department of itself in the Imperial\nkitchen.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098It demands an artist of a high calibre,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Leander. \u00e2\u0080\u0098I know only\none man who realises my idea, and he is at St. Petersburg. You do not\nknow Anastase? There is a man! But the Emperor has him secure. He can\nscarcely complain, however, since he is decorated, and has the rank of\nfull colonel.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Ah!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Prevost, mournfully, \u00e2\u0080\u0098there is no recognition of genius in\nthis country. What think you of Vanesse, my child? He has had a regular\neducation.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098In a bad school: as a pis aller one might put up with him. But his\neternal tiers of bonbons! As if they were ranged for a supper of the\nCarnival, and my guests were going to pelt each other! No, I could not\nstand Vanesse, papa.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098The dressing of the table: \u00e2\u0080\u0098tis a rare talent,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Prevost,\nmournfully, \u00e2\u0080\u0098and always was. In the Imperial kitchen------\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Papa,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Eugenie, opening the door, and putting in her head, \u00e2\u0080\u0098here\nis Monsieur Vanillette just come from Brussels. He has brought you a\nbasket of truffles from Ardennes. I told him you were on business, but\nto-night, if you be at home, he could come.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Vanillette!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 exclaimed Prevost, starting in his chair, \u00e2\u0080\u0098our little\nVanillette! There is your man, Le-ander. He was my first pupil, as you\nwere my last, my child. Bring up our little Vanillette, Eugenie. He is\nin the household of King Leopold, and his forte is dressing the table!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II.\n\n     _The House of Bellamont_\n\nTHE Duke of Bellamont was a personage who, from his rank, his blood, and\nhis wealth, might almost be placed at the head of the English nobility.\nAlthough the grandson of a mere country gentleman, his fortunate\nancestor, in the decline of the last century, had captivated the heiress\nof the Montacutes, Dukes of Bellamont, a celebrated race of the times\nof the Plantagenets. The bridegroom, at the moment of his marriage,\nhad adopted the illustrious name of his young and beautiful wife. Mr.\nMontacute was by nature a man of energy and of an enterprising spirit.\nHis vast and early success rapidly developed his native powers. With the\ncastles and domains and boroughs of the Bellamonts, he resolved also to\nacquire their ancient baronies and their modern coronets. The times were\nfavourable to his projects, though they might require the devotion of\na life. He married amid the disasters of the American war. The king and\nhis minister appreciated the independent support afforded them by Mr.\nMontacute, who represented his county, and who commanded five votes\nin the House besides his own. He was one of the chief pillars of their\ncause; but he was not only independent, he was conscientious and had\nscruples. Saratoga staggered him. The defection of the Montacute votes,\nat this moment, would have at once terminated the struggle between\nEngland and her colonies. A fresh illustration of the advantages of\nour parliamentary constitution! The independent Mr. Montacute, however,\nstood by his sovereign; his five votes continued to cheer the noble lord\nin the blue ribbon, and their master took his seat and the oaths in the\nHouse of Lords, as Earl of Bellamont and Viscount Montacute. This might\nbe considered sufficiently well for one generation; but the silver spoon\nwhich some fairy had placed in the cradle of the Earl of Bellamont was\nof colossal proportions. The French Revolution succeeded the American\nwar, and was occasioned by it. It was but just, therefore, that it also\nshould bring its huge quota to the elevation of the man whom a colonial\nrevolt had made an earl. Amid the panic of Jacobinism, the declamations\nof the friends of the people, the sovereign having no longer Hanover for\na refuge, and the prime minister examined as a witness in favour of the\nvery persons whom he was trying for high treason, the Earl of Bellamont\nmade a calm visit to Downing Street, and requested the revival of all\nthe honours of the ancient Earls and Dukes of Bellamont in his own\nperson. Mr. Pitt, who was far from favourable to the exclusive character\nwhich distinguished the English peerage in the last century, was\nhimself not disinclined to accede to the gentle request of his powerful\nsupporter; but the king was less flexible. His Majesty, indeed, was on\nprinciple not opposed to the revival of titles in families to whom the\ndomains without the honours of the old nobility had descended; and he\nrecognised the claim of the present Earls of Bellamont eventually to\nregain the strawberry leaf which had adorned the coronet of the father\nof the present countess. But the king was of opinion that this supreme\ndistinction ought only to be conferred on the blood of the old house,\nand that a generation, therefore, must necessarily elapse before a\nDuke of Bellamont could again figure in the golden book of the English\naristocracy.\n\nBut George the Third, with all his firmness, was doomed to frequent\ndiscomfiture. His lot was cast in troubled waters, and he had often to\ndeal with individuals as inflexible as himself. Benjamin Franklin was\nnot more calmly contumacious than the individual whom his treason had\nmade an English peer. In that age of violence, change and panic, power,\ndirected by a clear brain and an obdurate spirit, could not fail of its\naim; and so it turned out, that, in the very teeth of the royal will,\nthe simple country gentleman, whose very name was forgotten, became,\nat the commencement of this century, Duke of Bellamont, Marquis of\nMontacute, Earl of Bellamont, Dacre, and Villeroy, with all the baronies\nof the Plantagenets in addition. The only revenge of the king was, that\nhe never would give the Duke of Bellamont the garter. It was as well\nperhaps that there should be something for his son to desire.\n\nThe Duke and Duchess of Bellamont were the handsomest couple in England,\nand devoted to each other, but they had only one child. Fortunately,\nthat child was a son. Precious life! The Marquis of Montacute was\nmarried before he was of age. Not a moment was to be lost to find heirs\nfor all these honours. Perhaps, had his parents been less precipitate,\ntheir object might have been more securely obtained. The union\u00e2\u0080\u0099 was not\na happy one. The first duke had, however, the gratification of dying a\ngrandfather. His successor bore no resemblance to him, except in that\nbeauty which became a characteristic of the race. He was born to enjoy,\nnot to create. A man of pleasure, the chosen companion of the Regent in\nhis age of riot, he was cut off in his prime; but he lived long enough\nto break his wife\u00e2\u0080\u0099s heart and his son\u00e2\u0080\u0099s spirit; like himself, too, an\nonly child.\n\nThe present Duke of Bellamont had inherited something of the clear\nintelligence of his grandsire, with the gentle disposition of his\nmother. His fair abilities, and his benevolent inclinations, had been\ncultivated. His mother had watched over the child, in whom she found\nalike the charm and consolation of her life. But, at a certain period of\nyouth, the formation of character requires a masculine impulse, and that\nwas wanting. The duke disliked his son; in time he became even jealous\nof him. The duke had found himself a father at too early a period of\nlife. Himself in his lusty youth, he started with alarm at the form that\nrecalled his earliest and most brilliant hour, and who might prove a\nrival. The son was of a gentle and affectionate nature, and sighed for\nthe tenderness of his harsh and almost vindictive parent. But he had not\nthat passionate soul which might have appealed, and perhaps not in vain,\nto the dormant sympathies of the being who had created him. The young\nMontacute was by nature of an extreme shyness, and the accidents of his\nlife had not tended to dissipate his painful want of self-confidence.\nPhysically courageous, his moral timidity was remarkable. He alternately\nblushed or grew pale in his rare interviews with his father, trembled\nin silence before the undeserved sarcasm, and often endured the unjust\naccusation without an attempt to vindicate himself. Alone, and in\ntears alike of woe and indignation, he cursed the want of resolution or\nability which had again missed the opportunity that, both for his mother\nand himself, might have placed affairs in a happier position. Most\npersons, under these circumstances, would have become bitter, but\nMontacute was too tender for malice, and so he only turned melancholy.\nOn the threshold of manhood, Montacute lost his mother, and this seemed\nthe catastrophe of his unhappy life. His father neither shared his\ngrief, nor attempted to alleviate it. On the contrary, he seemed to\nredouble his efforts to mortify his son. His great object was to prevent\nLord Montacute from entering society, and he was so complete a master\nof the nervous temperament on which he was acting that there appeared\na fair chance of his succeeding in his benevolent intentions. When his\nson\u00e2\u0080\u0099s education was completed, the duke would not furnish him with the\nmeans of moving in the world in a becoming manner, or even sanction his\ntravelling. His Grace was resolved to break his son\u00e2\u0080\u0099s spirit by keeping\nhim immured in the country. Other heirs apparent of a rich seignory\nwould soon have removed these difficulties. By bill or by bond, by\nliving usury, or by post-obit liquidation, by all the means that private\nfriends or public offices could supply, the sinews of war would have\nbeen forthcoming. They would have beaten their fathers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 horses at\nNewmarket, eclipsed them with their mistresses, and, sitting for their\nboroughs, voted against their party. But Montacute was not one of those\nyoung heroes who rendered so distinguished the earlier part of this\ncentury. He had passed his life so much among women and clergymen that\nhe had never emancipated himself from the old law that enjoined him\nto honour a parent. Besides, with all his shyness and timidity, he was\nextremely proud. He never forgot that he was a Montacute, though he had\nforgotten, like the world in general, that his grandfather once bore a\ndifferent and humbler name. All merged in the great fact, that he was\nthe living representative of those Montacutes of Bellamont, whose wild\nand politic achievements, or the sustained splendour of whose stately\nlife had for seven hundred years formed a stirring and superb portion\nof the history and manners of our country. Death was preferable, in\nhis view, to having such a name soiled in the haunts of jockeys and\ncourtesans and usurers; and, keen as was the anguish which the conduct\nof the duke to his mother or himself had often occasioned him, it\nwas sometimes equalled in degree by the sorrow and the shame which he\nendured when he heard of the name of Bellamont only in connection with\nsome stratagem of the turf or some frantic revel. Without a friend,\nalmost without an acquaintance, Montacute sought refuge in love. She who\nshed over his mournful life the divine ray of feminine sympathy was\nhis cousin, the daughter of his mother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s brother, an English peer, but\nresident in the north of Ireland, where he had vast possessions. It was\na family otherwise little calculated to dissipate the reserve and gloom\nof a depressed and melancholy youth; puritanical, severe and formal in\ntheir manners, their relaxations a Bible Society, or a meeting for the\nconversion of the Jews. But Lady Katherine was beautiful, and all were\nkind to one to whom kindness was strange, and the soft pathos of whose\nsolitary spirit demanded affection.\n\nMontacute requested his father\u00e2\u0080\u0099s permission to marry his cousin, and was\nimmediately refused. The duke particularly disliked his wife\u00e2\u0080\u0099s family;\nbut the fact is, he had no wish that his son should ever marry. He meant\nto perpetuate his race himself, and was at this moment, in the midst of\nhis orgies, meditating a second alliance, which should compensate him\nfor his boyish blunder. In this state of affairs, Montacute, at length\nstung to resistance, inspired by the most powerful of passions, and\nacted upon by a stronger volition than his own, was planning a marriage\nin spite of his father (love, a cottage by an Irish lake, and seven\nhundred a-year) when intelligence arrived that his father, whose\npowerful frame and vigorous health seemed to menace a patriarchal term,\nwas dead.\n\nThe new Duke of Bellamont had no experience of the world; but, though\nlong cowed by his father, he had a strong character. Though the circle\nof his ideas was necessarily contracted, they were all clear and firm.\nIn his moody youth he had imbibed certain impressions and arrived at\ncertain conclusions, and they never quitted him. His mother was his\nmodel of feminine perfection, and he had loved his cousin because she\nbore a remarkable resemblance to her aunt. Again, he was of opinion\nthat the tie between the father and the son ought to be one of intimate\nconfidence and refined tenderness, and he resolved that, if Providence\nfavoured him with offspring, his child should ever find in him absolute\ndevotion of thought and feeling.\n\nA variety of causes and circumstances had impressed him with a\nconviction that what is called fashionable life was a compound of\nfrivolity and fraud, of folly and vice; and he resolved never to enter\nit. To this he was, perhaps, in some degree unconsciously prompted by\nhis reserved disposition, and by his painful sense of inexperience, for\nhe looked forward to this world with almost as much of apprehension\nas of dislike. To politics, in the vulgar sense of the word, he had an\nequal repugnance. He had a lofty idea of his duty to his sovereign and\nhis country, and felt within him the energies that would respond to a\nconjuncture. But he acceded to his title in a period of calmness, when\nnothing was called in question, and no danger was apprehended; and as\nfor the fights of factions, the duke altogether held himself aloof from\nthem; he wanted nothing, not even the blue ribbon which he was soon\nobliged to take. Next to his domestic hearth, all his being was\nconcentrated in his duties as a great proprietor of the soil. On\nthese he had long pondered, and these he attempted to fulfil. That\nperformance, indeed, was as much a source of delight to him as of\nobligation. He loved the country and a country life. His reserve seemed\nto melt away the moment he was on his own soil. Courteous he ever\nwas, but then he became gracious and hearty. He liked to assemble \u00e2\u0080\u0098the\ncounty\u00e2\u0080\u0099 around him; to keep \u00e2\u0080\u0098the county\u00e2\u0080\u0099 together; \u00e2\u0080\u0098the county\u00e2\u0080\u0099 seemed\nalways his first thought; he was proud of \u00e2\u0080\u0098the county,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 where he reigned\nsupreme, not more from his vast possessions than from the influence of\nhis sweet yet stately character, which made those devoted to him who\notherwise were independent of his sway.\n\nFrom straitened circumstances, and without having had a single fancy of\nyouth gratified, the Duke of Bellamont had been suddenly summoned to\nthe lordship of an estate scarcely inferior in size and revenue to\nsome continental principalities; to dwell in palaces and castles, to\nbe surrounded by a disciplined retinue, and to find every wish and want\ngratified before they could be expressed or anticipated. Yet he showed\nno elation, and acceded to his inheritance as serene as if he had never\nfelt a pang or proved a necessity. She whom in the hour of trial he had\nselected for the future partner of his life, though a remarkable woman,\nby a singular coincidence of feeling, for it was as much from her\noriginal character as from sympathy with her husband, confirmed him in\nall his moods.\n\nKatherine, Duchess of Bellamont, was beautiful: small and delicate in\nstructure, with a dazzling complexion, and a smile which, though rare,\nwas of the most winning and brilliant character. Her rich brown hair\nand her deep blue eye might have become a dryad; but her brow denoted\nintellect of a high order, and her mouth spoke inexorable resolution.\nShe was a woman of fixed opinions, and of firm and compact prejudices.\nBrought up in an austere circle, where on all matters irrevocable\njudgment had been passed, which enjoyed the advantages of knowing\nexactly what was true in dogma, what just in conduct, and what correct\nin manners, she had early acquired the convenient habit of decision,\nwhile her studious mind employed its considerable energies in mastering\nevery writer who favoured those opinions which she had previously\ndetermined were the right ones.\n\nThe duchess was deep in the divinity of the seventeenth century. In the\ncontroversies between the two churches, she could have perplexed St.\nOmers or Maynooth. Chillingworth might be found her boudoir. Not that\nher Grace\u00e2\u0080\u0099s reading was confined to divinity; on the contrary, it was\nvarious and extensive. Puritan in religion, she was precisian in morals;\nbut in both she was sincere. She was so in all things. Her nature was\nfrank and simple; if she were inflexible, she at least wished to be\njust; and though very conscious of the greatness of her position, she\nwas so sensible of its duties that there was scarcely any exertion which\nshe would evade, or any humility from which she would shrink, if she\nbelieved she were doing her duty to her God or to her neighbour.\n\nIt will be seen, therefore, that the Duke of Bellamont found no obstacle\nin his wife, who otherwise much influenced his conduct, to the plans\nwhich he had pre-conceived for the conduct of his life after marriage.\nThe duchess shrank, with a feeling of haughty terror from that world of\nfashion which would have so willingly greeted her. During the greater\npart of the year, therefore, the Bellamonts resided in their magnificent\ncastle, in their distant county, occupied with all the business and\nthe pleasures of the provinces. While the duke, at the head of the\nmagistracy, in the management of his estates, and in the sports of which\nhe was fond, found ample occupation, his wife gave an impulse to the\ncharity of the county, founded schools, endowed churches, received\ntheir neighbours, read her books, and amused herself in the creation of\nbeautiful gardens, for which she had a passion.\n\nAfter Easter, Parliament requiring their presence, the courtyard of one\nof the few palaces in London opened, and the world learnt that the Duke\nand Duchess of Bellamont had arrived at Bellamont House, from Montacute\nCastle. During their stay in town, which they made as brief as they\nwell could, and which never exceeded three months, they gave a series\nof great dinners, principally attended by noble relations and those\nfamilies of the county who were so fortunate as to have also a residence\nin London. Regularly every year, also, there was a grand banquet\ngiven to some members of the royal family by the Duke and Duchess of\nBellamont, and regularly every year the Duke and Duchess of Bellamont\nhad the honour of dining at the palace. Except at a ball or concert\nunder the royal roof, the duke and duchess were never seen anywhere\nin the evening. The great ladies indeed, the Lady St. Julians and the\nMarchionesses of Deloraine, always sent them invitations, though they\nwere ever declined. But the Bellamonts maintained a sort of\ntraditional acquaintance with a few great houses, either by the ties\nof relationship, which, among the aristocracy, are very ramified, or\nby occasionally receiving travelling magnificoes at their hospitable\ncastle.\n\nTo the great body, however, of what is called \u00e2\u0080\u0098the world,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 the world\nthat lives in St. James\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Street and Pall Mall, that looks out of a club\nwindow, and surveys mankind as Lucretius from his philosophic tower; the\nworld of the Georges and the Jemmys; of Mr. Cassilis and Mr. Melton; of\nthe Milfords and the Fitz-Herons, the Berners and the Egertons, the Mr.\nOrmsbys and the Alfred Mountchesneys, the Duke and Duchess of Bellamont\nwere absolutely unknown.\n\nAll that the world knew was, that there was a great peer who was called\nDuke of Bellamont; that there was a great house in London, with a\ncourtyard, which bore his name; that he had a castle in the country,\nwhich was one of the boasts of England; and that this great duke had a\nduchess; but they never met them anywhere, nor did their wives and their\nsisters, and the ladies whom they admired, or who admired them,\neither at ball or at breakfast, either at morning dances or at evening\nd\u00c3\u00a9jeuners. It was clear, therefore, that the Bellamonts might be very\ngreat people, but they were not in \u00e2\u0080\u0098society.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nIt must have been some organic law, or some fate which uses structure\nfor its fulfilment, but again it seemed that the continuance of the\ngreat house of Montacute should depend upon the life of a single being.\nThe duke, like his father and his grandfather, was favoured only with\none child, but that child was again a son. From the moment of his birth,\nthe very existence of his parents seemed identified with his welfare.\nThe duke and his wife mutually assumed to each other a secondary\nposition, in comparison with that occupied by their offspring. From the\nhour of his birth to the moment when this history opens, and when he was\nabout to complete his majority, never had such solicitude been lavished\non human being as had been continuously devoted to the life of the young\nLord Montacute. During his earlier education he scarcely quitted\nhome. He had, indeed, once been shown to Eton, surrounded by faithful\ndomestics, and accompanied by a private tutor, whose vigilance would\nnot have disgraced a superintendent of police; but the scarlet fever\nhappened to break out during his first half, and Lord Montacute was\ninstantly snatched away from the scene of danger, where he was never\nagain to appear. At eighteen he went to Christ-church. His mother, who\nhad nursed him herself, wrote to him every day; but this was not found\nsufficient, and the duke hired a residence in the neighourhood of the\nuniversity, in order that they might occasionally see their son during\nterm.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III.\n\n     _A Discussion about Money_\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098SAW Eskdale just now,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Mr. Cassilis, at White\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, \u00e2\u0080\u0098going down to\nthe Duke of Bellamont\u00e2\u0080\u0099s. Great doings there: son comes of age at Easter.\nWonder what sort of fellow he is? Anybody know anything about him?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I wonder what his father\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rent-roll is?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Mr. Ormsby.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098They say it is quite clear,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Lord Fitz-Heron. \u00e2\u0080\u0098Safe for that,\u00e2\u0080\u0099\nsaid Lord Milford; \u00e2\u0080\u0098and plenty of ready money, too, I should think, for\none never heard of the present duke doing anything.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098He does a good deal in his county,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Lord Valentine.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t call that anything,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Lord Milford; \u00e2\u0080\u0098but I mean to say he\nnever played, was never seen at Newmarket, or did anything which anybody\ncan remember. In fact, he is a person whose name you never by any chance\nhear mentioned.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098He is a sort of cousin of mine,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Lord Valentine; \u00e2\u0080\u0098and we are all\ngoing down to the coming of age: that is, we are asked.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 \u00e2\u0080\u0098Then you can\ntell us what sort of fellow the son is.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I never saw him,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Lord Valentine; \u00e2\u0080\u0098but I know the duchess told\nmy mother last year, that Montacute, throughout his life, had never\noccasioned her a single moment\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pain.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nHere there was a general laugh.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Well, I have no doubt he will make up for lost time,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Mr. Ormsby,\ndemurely.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Nothing like mamma\u00e2\u0080\u0099s darling for upsetting a coach,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Lord Milford.\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098You ought to bring your cousin here, Valentine; we would assist the\ndevelopment of his unsophisticated intelligence.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098If I go down, I will propose it to him.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Why if?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Mr. Cassilis; \u00e2\u0080\u0098sort of thing I should like to see once\nuncommonly: oxen roasted alive, old armour, and the girls of the village\nall running about as if they were behind the scenes.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Is that the way you did it at your majority, George?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Lord\nFitz-Heron.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Egad! I kept my arrival at years of discretion at Brighton. I believe\nit was the last fun there ever was at the Pavilion. The poor dear king,\nGod bless him! proposed my health, and made the devil\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own speech; we\nall began to pipe. He was Regent then. Your father was there, Valentine;\nask him if he remembers it. That was a scene! I won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t say how it ended;\nbut the best joke is, I got a letter from my governor a few days after,\nwith an account of what they had all been doing at Brandingham, and\nrowing me for not coming down, and I found out I had kept my coming of\nage the wrong day.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Did you tell them?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Not a word: I was afraid we might have had to go through it over\nagain.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I suppose old Bellamont is the devil\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own screw,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Lord Milford.\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Rich governors, who have never been hard up, always are.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098No: I believe he is a very good sort of fellow,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Lord Valentine;\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098at least my people always say so. I do not know much about him, for\nthey never go anywhere.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098They have got Leander down at Montacute,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Mr. Cassilis. \u00e2\u0080\u0098Had\nnot such a thing as a cook in the whole county. They say Lord Eskdale\narranged the cuisine for them; so you will feed well, Valentine.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098That is something: and one can eat before Easter; but when the balls\nbegin----\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Oh! as for that, you will have dancing enough at Montacute; it is\nexpected on these occasions: Sir Roger de Coverley, tenants\u00e2\u0080\u0099 daughters,\nand all that sort of thing. Deuced funny, but I must say, if I am to\nhave a lark, I like Vauxhall.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I never met the Bellamonts,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Lord Milford, musingly. \u00e2\u0080\u0098Are there\nany daughters?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098None.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098That is a bore. A single daughter, even if there be a son, may be made\nsomething of; because, in nine cases out of ten, there is a round sum in\nthe settlements for the younger children, and she takes it all.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098That is the case of Lady Blanche Bickerstaffe,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Lord Fitz-Heron.\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098She will have a hundred thousand pounds.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098You don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mean that!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Lord Valentine; \u00e2\u0080\u0098and she is a very nice\ngirl, too.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098You are quite wrong about the hundred thousand, Fitz,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Lord\nMilford; \u00e2\u0080\u0098for I made it my business to inquire most particularly into\nthe affair: it is only fifty.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098In these cases, the best rule is only to believe half,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Mr.\nOrmsby.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Then you have only got twenty thousand a-year, Ormsby,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Lord\nMilford, laughing, \u00e2\u0080\u0098because the world gives you forty.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Well, we must do the best we can in these hard times,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Mr. Ormsby,\nwith an air of mock resignation. \u00e2\u0080\u0098With your Dukes of Bellamont and all\nthese grandees on the stage, we little men shall be scarcely able to\nhold up our heads.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Come, Ormsby,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Lord Milford; \u00e2\u0080\u0098tell us the amount of your income\ntax.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098They say Sir Robert quite blushed when he saw the figure at which you\nwere sacked, and declared it was downright spoliation.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098You young men are always talking about money,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Mr. Ormsby, shaking\nhis head; \u00e2\u0080\u0098you should think of higher things.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I wonder what young Montacute will be thinking of this time next year,\u00e2\u0080\u0099\nsaid Lord Fitz-Heron.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098There will be plenty of people thinking of him,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Mr. Cassilis.\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Egad! you gentlemen must stir yourselves, if you mean to be turned off.\nYou will have rivals.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098He will be no rival to me,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Lord Milford; \u00e2\u0080\u0098for I am an avowed\nfortune-hunter, and that you say he does not care for, at least, at\npresent.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098And I marry only for love,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Lord Valentine, laughing; \u00e2\u0080\u0098and so we\nshall not clash.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Ay, ay; but if he will not go to the heiresses, the heiresses will go\nto him,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Mr. Ormsby. \u00e2\u0080\u0098I have seen a good deal of these things, and\nI generally observe the eldest son of a duke takes a fortune out of the\nmarket. Why, there is Beaumanoir, he is like Valentine; I suppose\nhe intends to marry for love, as he is always in that way; but the\nheiresses never leave him alone, and in the long run you cannot\nwithstand it; it is like a bribe; a man is indignant at the bare\nthought, refuses the first offer, and pockets the second.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098It is very immoral, and very unfair,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Lord Milford, \u00e2\u0080\u0098that any man\nshould marry for tin who does not want it.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV.\n\n     _Montacute  Castle_\n\nTHE forest of Montacute, in the north of England, is the name given to\nan extensive district, which in many parts offers no evidence of the\npropriety of its title. The land, especially during the last century,\nhas been effectively cleared, and presents, in general, a champaign\nview; rich and rural, but far from picturesque. Over a wide expanse, the\neye ranges on cornfields and rich hedgerows, many a sparkling spire, and\nmany a merry windmill. In the extreme distance, on a clear day, may\nbe discerned the blue hills of the Border, and towards the north the\ncultivated country ceases, and the dark form of the old forest spreads\ninto the landscape. The traveller, however, who may be tempted to\npenetrate these sylvan recesses, will find much that is beautiful, and\nlittle that is savage. He will be struck by the capital road that winds\namong the groves of ancient oak, and the turfy and ferny wilderness\nwhich extends on each side, whence the deer gaze on him with haughty\ncomposure, as if conscious that he was an intruder into their kingdom of\nwhom they need have no fear. As he advances, he observes the number of\ncross routes which branch off from the main road, and which, though of\nless dimensions, are equally remarkable for their masterly structure and\ncompact condition.\n\nSometimes the land is cleared, and he finds himself by the homestead\nof a forest farm, and remarks the buildings, distinguished not only by\ntheir neatness, but the propriety of their rustic architecture. Still\nadvancing, the deer become rarer, and the road is formed by an avenue\nof chestnuts; the forest, on each side, being now transformed into\nvegetable gardens. The stir of the population is soon evident. Persons\nare moving to and fro on the side path of the road. Horsemen and carts\nseem returning from market; women with empty baskets, and then the rare\nvision of a stage-coach. The postilion spurs his horses, cracks his\nwhip, and dashes at full gallop into the town of Montacute, the capital\nof the forest.\n\nIt is the prettiest little town in the world, built entirely of hewn\nstone, the well-paved and well-lighted streets as neat as a Dutch\nvillage. There are two churches: one of great antiquity, the other\nraised by the present duke, but in the best style of Christian\narchitecture. The bridge that spans the little but rapid river Belle,\nis perhaps a trifle too vast and Roman for its site; but it was built\nby the first duke of the second dynasty, who was always afraid of\nunderbuilding his position. The town was also indebted to him for their\nhall, a Palladian palace. Montacute is a corporate town, and, under\nthe old system, returned two members to Parliament. The amount of\nits population, according to the rule generally observed, might have\npreserved it from disfranchisement, but, as every house belonged to\nthe duke, and as he was what, in the confused phraseology of the\nrevolutionary war, was called a Tory, the Whigs took care to put\nMontacute in Schedule A.\n\nThe town-hall, the market-place, a literary institution, and the new\nchurch, form, with some good houses of recent erection, a handsome\nsquare, in which there is a fountain, a gift to the town from the\npresent duchess.\n\nAt the extremity of the town, the ground rises, and on a woody steep,\nwhich is in fact the termination of a long range of tableland, may be\nseen the towers of the outer court of Montacute Castle. The principal\nbuilding, which is vast and of various ages, from the Plantagenets to\nthe Guelphs, rises on a terrace, from which, on the side opposite to the\ntown, you descend into a well-timbered inclosure, called the Home Park.\nFurther on, the forest again appears; the deer again crouch in their\nfern, or glance along the vistas; nor does this green domain terminate\ntill it touches the vast and purple moors that divide the kingdoms of\nGreat Britain.\n\nIt was on an early day of April that the duke was sitting in his private\nroom, a pen in one hand, and looking up with a face of pleasurable\nemotion at his wife, who stood by his side, her right arm sometimes on\nthe back of his chair, and sometimes on his shoulder, while with her\nother hand, between the intervals of speech, she pressed a handkerchief\nto her eyes, bedewed with the expression of an affectionate excitement.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098It is too much,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said her Grace.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098And done in such a handsome manner!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said the duke.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I would not tell our dear child of it at this moment,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said the\nduchess; \u00e2\u0080\u0098he has so much to go through!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098You are right, Kate. It will keep till the celebration is over. How\ndelighted he will be!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098My dear George, I sometimes think we are too happy.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098You are not half as happy as you deserve to be,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 replied her husband,\nlooking up with a smile of affection; and then he finished his reply to\nthe letter of Mr. Hungerford, one of the county members, informing\nthe duke, that now Lord Montacute was of age, he intended at once to\nwithdraw from Parliament, having for a long time fixed on the majority\nof the heir of the house of Bellamont as the signal for that event. \u00e2\u0080\u0098I\naccepted the post,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Mr. Hungerford, \u00e2\u0080\u0098much against my will. Your\nGrace behaved to me at the time in the handsomest manner, and, indeed,\never since, with respect to this subject. But a Marquis of Montacute is,\nin my opinion, and, I believe I may add, in that of the whole county,\nour proper representative; besides, we want young blood in the House.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098It certainly is done in the handsomest manner,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said the duke.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098But then you know, George, you behaved to him in the handsomest manner;\nhe says so, as you do indeed to everybody; and this is your reward.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I should be very sorry, indeed, if Hungerford did not withdraw with\nperfect satisfaction to himself, and his family too,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 urged the duke;\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098they are most respectable people, one of the most respectable families\nin the county; I should be quite grieved if this step were taken without\ntheir entire and hearty concurrence.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Of course it is,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said the duchess, \u00e2\u0080\u0098with the entire and hearty\nconcurrence of every one. Mr. Hungerford says so. And I must say that,\nthough few things could have gratified me more, I quite agree with Mr.\nHungerford that a Lord Montacute is the natural member for the county;\nand I have no doubt that if Mr. Hungerford, or any one else in his\nposition, had not resigned, they never could have met our child without\nfeeling the greatest embarrassment.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098A man though, and a man of Hungerford\u00e2\u0080\u0099s position, an old family in\nthe county, does not like to figure as a warming-pan,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said the duke,\nthoughtfully. \u00e2\u0080\u0098I think it has been done in a very handsome manner.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098And we will show our sense of it,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said the duchess. \u00e2\u0080\u0098The Hungerfords\nshall feel, when they come here on Thursday, that they are among our\nbest friends.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098That is my own Kate! Here is a letter from your brother. They will be\nhere to-morrow. Eskdale cannot come over till Wednesday. He is at home,\nbut detained by a meeting about his new harbour.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I am delighted that they will be here to-morrow,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said the duchess. \u00e2\u0080\u0098I\nam so anxious that he should see Kate before the castle is full, when he\nwill have a thousand calls upon his time! I feel persuaded that he will\nlove her at first sight. And as for their being cousins, why, we were\ncousins, and that did not hinder us from loving each other.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098If she resemble you as much as you resembled your aunt ----\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said the\nduke, looking up.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098She is my perfect image, my very self, Harriet says, in disposition, as\nwell as face and form.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Then our son has a good chance of being a very happy man,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said the\nduke.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098That he should come of age, enter Parliament, and marry in the same\nyear! We ought to be very thankful. What a happy year!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098But not one of these events has yet occurred,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said the duke, smiling.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098But they all will,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said the duchess, \u00e2\u0080\u0098under Providence.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I would not precipitate marriage.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Certainly not; nor should I wish him to think of it before the autumn.\nI should like him to be married on our wedding-day.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V.\n\n     _The Heir Comes of Age_\n\nTHE sun shone brightly, there was a triumphal arch at every road;\nthe market-place and the town-hall were caparisoned like steeds for a\ntournament, every house had its garland; the flags were flying on every\ntower and steeple. There was such a peal of bells you could scarcely\nhear your neighbour\u00e2\u0080\u0099s voice; then came discharges of artillery, and then\nbursts of music from various bands, all playing different tunes. The\ncountry people came trooping in, some on horseback, some in carts, some\nin procession. The Temperance band made an immense noise, and the\nOdd Fellows were loudly cheered. Every now and then one of the duke\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nyeomanry galloped through the town in his regimentals of green and\nsilver, with his dark flowing plume and clattering sabre, and with an\nair of business-like desperation, as if he were carrying a message from\nthe commander-in-chief in the thickest of the fight.\n\nBefore the eventful day of which this, merry morn was the harbinger, the\narrivals of guests at the castle had been numerous and important. First\ncame the brother of the duchess, with his countess, and their fair\ndaughter the Lady Katherine, whose fate, unconsciously to herself, had\nalready been sealed by her noble relatives. She was destined to be the\nthird Katherine of Bellamont that her fortunate house had furnished to\nthese illustrious walls. Nor, if unaware of her high lot, did she seem\nunworthy of it. Her mien was prophetic of the state assigned to her.\nThis was her first visit to Montacute since her early childhood, and she\nhad not encountered her cousin since their nursery days. The day after\nthem, Lord Eskdale came over from his principal seat in the contiguous\ncounty, of which he was lord-lieutenant. He was the first cousin of the\nduke, his father and the second Duke of Bellamont having married two\nsisters, and of course intimately related to the duchess and her family.\nLord Eskdale exercised a great influence over the house of Montacute,\nthough quite unsought for by him. He was the only man of the world\nwhom they knew, and they never decided upon anything out of the limited\ncircle of their immediate experience without consulting him. Lord\nEskdale had been the cause of their son going to Eton; Lord Eskdale had\nrecommended them to send him to Christ-church. The duke had begged his\ncousin to be his trustee when he married; he had made him his executor,\nand had intended him as the guardian of his son. Although, from the\ndifference of their habits, little thrown together in their earlier\nyouth, Lord Eskdale had shown, even then, kind consideration for his\nrelative; he had even proposed that they should travel together, but\nthe old duke would not consent to this. After his death, however, being\nneighbours as well as relatives, Lord Eskdale had become the natural\nfriend and counsellor of his Grace.\n\nThe duke deservedly reposed in him implicit confidence, and entertained\nan almost unbounded admiration of his cousin\u00e2\u0080\u0099s knowledge of mankind. He\nwas scarcely less a favourite or less an oracle with the duchess, though\nthere were subjects on which she feared Lord Eskdale did not entertain\nviews as serious as her own; but Lord Eskdale, with an extreme\ncarelessness of manner, and an apparent negligence of the minor arts\nof pleasing, was a consummate master of the feminine idiosyncrasy, and,\nfrom a French actress to an English duchess, was skilled in guiding\nwomen without ever letting the curb be felt. Scarcely a week elapsed,\nwhen Lord Eskdale was in the country, that a long letter of difficulties\nwas not received by him from Montacute, with an earnest request for his\nimmediate advice. His lordship, singularly averse to letter writing, and\nespecially to long letter writing, used generally in reply to say that,\nin the course of a day or two, he should be in their part of the world,\nand would talk the matter over with them.\n\nAnd, indeed, nothing was more amusing than to see Lord Eskdale,\nimperturbable, yet not heedless, with his peculiar calmness, something\nbetween that of a Turkish pasha and an English jockey, standing up\nwith his back to the fire and his hands in his pockets, and hearing the\nunited statement of a case by the Duke and Duchess of Bellamont;\nthe serious yet quiet and unexaggerated narrative of his Grace, the\nimpassioned interruptions, decided opinions, and lively expressions\nof his wife, when she felt the duke was not doing justice to the\ncircumstances, or her view of them, and the Spartan brevity with which,\nwhen both his clients were exhausted, their counsel summed up the whole\naffair, and said three words which seemed suddenly to remove all\ndoubts, and to solve all difficulties. In all the business of life, Lord\nEskdale, though he appreciated their native ability, and respected\ntheir considerable acquirements, which he did not share, looked upon his\ncousins as two children, and managed them as children; but he was really\nattached to them, and the sincere attachment of such a character is\noften worth more than the most passionate devotion. The last great\ndomestic embarrassment at Montacute had been the affair of the cooks.\nLord Eskdale had taken this upon his own shoulders, and, writing to\nDaubuz, had sent down Leander and his friends to open the minds and\ncharm the palates of the north.\n\nLord Valentine and his noble parents, and their daughter, Lady\nFlorentina, who was a great horsewoman, also arrived. The countess, who\nhad once been a beauty with the reputation of a wit, and now set up for\nbeing a wit on the reputation of having been a beauty, was the lady of\nfashion of the party, and scarcely knew anybody present, though there\nwere many who were her equals and some her superiors in rank. Her way\nwas to be a little fine, always smiling and condescendingly amiable;\nwhen alone with her husband shrugging her shoulders somewhat, and vowing\nthat she was delighted that Lord Eskdale was there, as she had somebody\nto speak to. It was what she called \u00e2\u0080\u0098quite a relief.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 A relief, perhaps,\nfrom Lord and Lady Mountjoy, whom she had been avoiding all her life;\nunfortunate people, who, with a large fortune, lived in a wrong square,\nand asked to their house everybody who was nobody; besides, Lord\nMountjoy was vulgar, and laughed too loud, and Lady Mountjoy called you\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098my dear,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 and showed her teeth. A relief, perhaps, too, from the Hon.\nand Rev. Montacute Mountjoy, who, with Lady Eleanor, four daughters\nand two sons, had been invited to celebrate the majority of the future\nchieftain of their house. The countess had what is called \u00e2\u0080\u0098a horror of\nthose Mountjoys, and those Montacute Mountjoys,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 and what added to her\nannoyance was, that Lord Valentine was always flirting with the Misses\nMontacute Mountjoy.\n\nThe countess could find no companions in the Duke and Duchess of\nClanronald, because, as she told her husband, as they could not speak\nEnglish and she could not speak Scotch, it was impossible to exchange\nideas. The bishop of the diocese was there, toothless and tolerant,\nand wishing to be on good terms with all sects, provided they pay\nchurch-rates, and another bishop far more vigorous and of greater fame.\nBy his administration the heir of Bellamont had entered the Christian\nChurch, and by the imposition of his hands had been confirmed in it. His\nlordship, a great authority with the duchess, was specially invited to\nbe present on the interesting occasion, when the babe that he had held\nat the font, and the child that he had blessed at the altar, was about\nthus publicly to adopt and acknowledge the duties and responsibility of\na man. But the countess, though she liked bishops, liked them, as she\ntold her husband, \u00e2\u0080\u0098in their place.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 What that exactly was, she did not\ndefine; but probably their palaces or the House of Lords.\n\nIt was hardly to be expected that her ladyship would find any relief\nin the society of the Marquis and Marchioness of Hampshire; for his\nlordship passed his life in being the President of scientific and\nliterary societies, and was ready for anything from the Royal, if his\nturn ever arrived, to opening a Mechanics\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Institute in his neighbouring\ntown. Lady Hampshire was an invalid; but her ailment was one of those\nmysteries which still remained insoluble, although, in the most liberal\nmanner, she delighted to afford her friends all the information in her\npower. Never was a votary endowed with a faith at once so lively and\nso capricious. Each year she believed in some new remedy, and announced\nherself on the eve of some miraculous cure. But the saint was scarcely\ncanonised before his claims to beatitude were impugned. One year Lady\nHampshire never quitted Leamington; another, she contrived to combine\nthe infinitesimal doses of Hahnemann with the colossal distractions\nof the metropolis. Now her sole conversation was the water cure. Lady\nHampshire was to begin immediately after her visit to Montacute, and she\nspoke in her sawney voice of factitious enthusiasm, as if she pitied the\nlot of all those who were not about to sleep in wet sheets.\n\nThe members for the county, with their wives and daughters, the\nHungerfords and the Ildertons, Sir Russell Malpas, or even Lord Hull,\nan Irish peer with an English estate, and who represented one of the\ndivisions, were scarcely a relief. Lord Hull was a bachelor, and had\ntwenty thousand a year, and would not have been too old for Florentina,\nif Lord Hull had only lived in \u00e2\u0080\u0098society,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 learnt how to dress and how\nto behave, and had avoided that peculiar coarseness of manners and\ncomplexion which seem the inevitable results of a provincial life. What\nare forty-five or even forty-eight years, if a man do not get up too\nearly or go to bed too soon, if he be dressed by the right persons, and,\nearly accustomed to the society of women, he possesses that flexibility\nof manner and that readiness of gentle repartee which a feminine\napprenticeship can alone confer? But Lord Hull was a man with a red face\nand a grey head on whom coarse indulgence and the selfish negligence of\na country life had already conferred a shapeless form; and who,\ndressed something like a groom, sat at dinner in stolid silence by Lady\nHampshire, who, whatever were her complaints, had certainly the art,\nif only from her questions, of making her neighbours communicative. The\ncountess examined Lord Hull through her eye-glass with curious pity at\nso fine a fortune and so good a family being so entirely thrown away.\nHad he been brought up in a civilised manner, lived six months in May\nFair, passed his carnival at Paris, never sported except in Scotland,\nand occasionally visited a German bath, even Lord Hull might have \u00e2\u0080\u0098fined\ndown.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 His hair need not have been grey if it had been attended to; his\ncomplexion would not have been so glaring; his hands never could have\ngrown to so huge a shape.\n\nWhat a party, where the countess was absolutely driven to speculate on\nthe possible destinies of a Lord Hull! But in this party there was not a\nsingle young man, at least not a single young man one had ever heard\nof, except her son, and he was of no use. The Duke of Bellamont knew\nno young men; the duke did not even belong to a club; the Duchess of\nBellamont knew no young men; she never gave and she never attended an\nevening party. As for the county youth, the young Hungerfords and the\nyoung Ildertons, the best of them formed part of the London crowd.\n\nSome of them, by complicated manouvres, might even have made their way\ninto the countess\u00e2\u0080\u0099s crowded saloons on a miscellaneous night. She knew\nthe length of their tether. They ranged, as the Price Current says, from\neight to three thousand a year. Not the figure that purchases a Lady\nFlorentina!\n\nThere were many other guests, and some of them notable, though not\nof the class and character to interest the fastidious mother of Lord\nValentine; but whoever and whatever they might be, of the sixty\nor seventy persons who were seated each day in the magnificent\nbanqueting-room of Montacute Castle, feasting, amid pyramids of gold\nplate, on the masterpieces of Leander, there was not a single individual\nwho did not possess one of the two great qualifications: they were all\nof them cousins of the Duke of Bellamont, or proprietors in his county.\n\nBut we must not anticipate, the great day of the festival having hardly\nyet commenced.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI.\n\n     _A Festal Day_\n\nIN THE Home Park was a colossal pavilion, which held more than two\nthousand persons, and in which the townsfolk of Montacute were to dine;\nat equal distances were several smaller tents, each of different colours\nand patterns, and each bearing on a standard the name of one of the\nsurrounding parishes which belonged to the Duke of Bellamont, and to\nthe convenience and gratification of whose inhabitants these tents were\nto-day dedicated. There was not a man of Buddleton or Fuddleton; not a\nyeoman or peasant of Montacute super Mare or Montacute Abbotts, nor\nof Percy Bellamont nor Friar\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Bellamont, nor Winch nor Finch, nor of\nMandeville Stokes nor Mandeville Bois; not a goodman true of Carleton\nand Ingleton and Kirkby and Dent, and Gillamoor and Padmore and Hutton\nle Hale; not a stout forester from the glades of Thorp, or the sylvan\nhomes of Hurst Lydgate and Bishopstowe, that knew not where foamed and\nflowed the duke\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ale, that was to quench the longings of his thirsty\nvillage. And their wives and daughters were equally welcome. At the\nentrance of each tent, the duke\u00e2\u0080\u0099s servants invited all to enter,\nsupplied them with required refreshments, or indicated their appointed\nplaces at the approaching banquet. In general, though there were many\nmiscellaneous parties, each village entered the park in procession, with\nits flag and its band.\n\nAt noon the scene presented the appearance of an immense but\nwell-ordered fair. In the background, men and boys climbed poles or\nraced in sacks, while the exploits of the ginglers, their mischievous\nmanoeuvres and subtle combinations, elicited frequent bursts of\nlaughter. Further on, two long-menaced cricket matches called forth all\nthe skill and energy of Fuddleton and Buddleton, and Winch and Finch.\nThe great throng of the population, however, was in the precincts of the\nterrace, where, in the course of the morning, it was known that the duke\nand duchess, with the hero of the day and all their friends, were to\nappear, to witness the sports of the people, and especially the feats\nof the morrice-dancers, who were at this moment practising before a\nvery numerous and delighted audience. In the meantime, bells, drums, and\ntrumpets, an occasional volley, and the frequent cheers and laughter\nof the multitude, combined with the brilliancy of the sun and the\nbrightness of the ale to make a right gladsome scene.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nothing to what it will be at night,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said one of the duke\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nfootmen to his family, his father and mother, two sisters and a young\nbrother, listening to him with open mouths, and staring at his state\nlivery with mingled feelings of awe and affection. They had come over\nfrom Bellamont Friars, and their son had asked the steward to give him\nthe care of the pavilion of that village, in order that he might\nlook after his friends. Never was a family who esteemed themselves so\nfortunate or felt so happy. This was having a friend at court, indeed.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nothing to what it will be at night,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Thomas. \u00e2\u0080\u0098You will have\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHail, star of Bellamont!\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cGod save the Queen!\u00e2\u0080\u009d a crown, three\nstars,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 four flags, and two coronets, all in coloured lamps, letters six\nfeet high, on the castle. There will be one hundred beacons lit over\nthe space of fifty miles the moment a rocket is shot off from the\nRound Tower; and as for fireworks, Bob, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll see them at last. Bengal\nlights, and the largest wheels will be as common as squibs and crackers;\nand I have heard say, though it is not to be mentioned----\u00e2\u0080\u0099 And he\npaused.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll not open our mouths,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said his father, earnestly.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098You had better not tell us,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said his mother, in a nervous paroxysm;\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098for I am in such a fluster, I am sure I cannot answer for myself, and\nthen Thomas may lose his place for breach of conference.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Nonsense, mother,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said his sisters, who snubbed their mother almost as\nreadily as is the gracious habit of their betters. \u00e2\u0080\u0098Pray tell us, Tom.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Ay, ay, Tom,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said his younger brother.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Well,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Tom, in a confidential whisper, \u00e2\u0080\u0098won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t there be a\ntransparency! I have heard say the Queen never had anything like it. You\nwon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be able to see it for the first quarter of an hour, there will be\nsuch a blaze of fire and rockets; but when it does come, they say it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nlike heaven opening; the young markiss on a cloud, with his hand on his\nheart, in his new uniform.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Dear me!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said the mother. \u00e2\u0080\u0098I knew him before he was weaned. The\nduchess suckled him herself, which shows her heart is very true; for\nthey may say what they like, but if another\u00e2\u0080\u0099s milk is in your child\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nveins, he seems, in a sort of way, as much her bairn as your own.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Mother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s milk makes a true born Englishman,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said the father; \u00e2\u0080\u0098and I\nmake no doubt our young markiss will prove the same.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098How I long to see him!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 exclaimed one of the daughters.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098And so do I!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said her sister; \u00e2\u0080\u0098and in his uniform! How beautiful it\nmust be!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Well, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said the mother; \u00e2\u0080\u0098and perhaps you will laugh at me\nfor saying so, but after seeing my Thomas in his state livery, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\ncare much for seeing anything else.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Mother, how can you say such things? I am afraid the crowd will be very\ngreat at the fireworks. We must try to get a good place.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I have arranged all that,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Thomas, with a triumphant look. \u00e2\u0080\u0098There\nwill be an inner circle for the steward\u00e2\u0080\u0099s friends, and you will be let\nin.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Oh!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 exclaimed his sisters.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Well, I hope I shall get through the day,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said his mother; \u00e2\u0080\u0098but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nrather a trial, after our quiet life.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098And when will they come on the terrace, Thomas?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098You see, they are waiting for the corporation, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the mayor and\ntown council of Montacute; they are coming up with an address. There! Do\nyou hear that? That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the signal gun. They are leaving the town-hall at\nthis same moment. Now, in three-quarters of an hour\u00e2\u0080\u0099s time or so, the\nduke and duchess, and the young markiss, and all of them, will come on\nthe terrace. So you be alive, and draw near, and get a good place. I\nmust look after these people.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nAbout the same time that the cannon announced that the corporation\nhad quitted the town-hall, some one tapped at the chamber-door of Lord\nEskdale, who was sealing a letter in his private room.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Well, Harris?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Lord Eskdale, looking up, and recognising his\nvalet.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098His Grace has been inquiring for your lordship several times,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 replied\nMr. Harris, with a perplexed air.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I shall be with him in good time,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 replied his lordship, again looking\ndown.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098If you could manage to come down at once, my lord,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Mr. Harris.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Why?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Mr. Leander wishes to see your lordship very much.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Ah! Leander!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Lord Eskdale, in a more interested tone. \u00e2\u0080\u0098What does\nhe want?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I have not seen him,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Mr. Harris; \u00e2\u0080\u0098but Mr. Prevost tells me that\nhis feelings are hurt.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I hope he has not struck,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Lord Eskdale, with a comical glance.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Something of that sort,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Mr. Harris, very seriously.\n\nLord Eskdale had a great sympathy with artists; he was well acquainted\nwith that irritability which is said to be the characteristic of the\ncreative power; genius always found in him an indulgent arbiter. He was\nconvinced that if the feelings of a rare spirit like Leander were hurt,\nthey were not to be trifled with. He felt responsible for the presence\nof one so eminent in a country where, perhaps, he was not properly\nappreciated; and Lord Eskdale descended to the steward\u00e2\u0080\u0099s room with the\nconsciousness of an important, probably a difficult, mission.\n\nThe kitchen of Montacute Castle was of the old style, fitted for\nbaronial feasts. It covered a great space, and was very lofty. Now\nthey build them in great houses on a different system; even more\ndistinguished by height, but far more condensed in area, as it is\nthought that a dish often suffers from the distances which the cook\nhas to move over in collecting its various component parts. The new\nprinciple seems sound; the old practice, however, was more picturesque.\nThe kitchen at Montacute was like the preparation for the famous wedding\nfeast of Prince Riquet with the Tuft, when the kind earth opened, and\nrevealed that genial spectacle of white-capped cooks, and endless stoves\nand stewpans. The steady blaze of two colossal fires was shrouded by\nvast screens. Everywhere, rich materials and silent artists; business\nwithout bustle, and the all-pervading magic of method. Philippon was\npreparing a sauce; Dumoreau, in another quarter of the spacious chamber,\nwas arranging some truffles; the Englishman, Smit, was fashioning\na cutlet. Between these three generals of division aides-de-camp\nperpetually passed, in the form of active and observant marmitons, more\nthan one of whom, as he looked on the great masters around him, and\nwith the prophetic faculty of genius surveyed the future, exclaimed to\nhimself, like Cor-reggio, \u00e2\u0080\u0098And I also will be a cook.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nIn this animated and interesting scene was only one unoccupied\nindividual, or rather occupied only with his own sad thoughts. This was\nPapa Prevost, leaning against rather than sitting on a dresser, with his\narms folded, his idle knife stuck in his girdle, and the tassel of his\ncap awry with vexation. His gloomy brow, however, lit up as Mr. Harris,\nfor whom he was waiting with anxious expectation, entered, and summoned\nhim to the presence of Lord Eskdale, who, with a shrewd yet lounging\nair, which concealed his own foreboding perplexity, said, \u00e2\u0080\u0098Well,\nPrevost, what is the matter? The people here been impertinent?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nPrevost shook his head. \u00e2\u0080\u0098We never were in a house, my lord, where they\nwere more obliging. It is something much worse.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Nothing wrong about your fish, I hope? Well, what is it?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Leander, my lord, has been dressing dinners for a week: dinners, I will\nbe bound to say, which were never equalled in the Imperial kitchen,\nand the duke has never made a single observation, or sent him a single\nmessage. Yesterday, determined to outdo even himself, he sent up some\n_escalopes de laitances de carpes \u00c3\u00a0 la Bellamont_. In my time I have\nseen nothing like it, my lord. Ask Philippon, ask Dumoreau, what they\nthought of it! Even the Englishman, Smit, who never says anything,\nopened his mouth and exclaimed; as for the marmitons, they were\nbreathless, and I thought Achille, the youth of whom I spoke to you, my\nlord, and who appears to me to be born with the true feeling, would have\nbeen overcome with emotion. When it was finished, Leander retired to\nhis room--I attended him--and covered his face with his hands. Would you\nbelieve it, my lord! Not a word; not even a message. All this morning\nLeander has waited in the last hope. Nothing, absolutely nothing! How\ncan he compose when he is not appreciated? Had he been appreciated, he\nwould to-day not only have repeated the _escalopes \u00c3\u00a0 la Bellamont_, but\nperhaps even invented what might have outdone it. It is unheard of,\nmy lord. The late lord Monmouth would have sent for Leander the very\nevening, or have written to him a beautiful letter, which would have\nbeen preserved in his family; M. de Sidonia would have sent him a\ntankard from his table. These things in themselves are nothing; but they\nprove to a man of genius that he is understood. Had Leander been in the\nImperial kitchen, or even with the Emperor of Russia, he would have been\ndecorated!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Where is he?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Lord Eskdale.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098He is alone in the cook\u00e2\u0080\u0099s room.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I will go and say a word to him.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nAlone, in the cook\u00e2\u0080\u0099s room, gazing in listless vacancy on the fire,\nthat fire which, under his influence, had often achieved so many\nmaster-works, was the great artist who was not appreciated. No longer\nsuffering under mortification, but overwhelmed by that exhaustion which\nfollows acute sensibility and the over-tension of the creative faculty,\nhe looked round as Lord Eskdale entered, and when he perceived who was\nhis visitor, he rose immediately, bowed very low, and then sighed.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Prevost thinks we are not exactly appreciated here,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Lord Eskdale.\n\nLeander bowed again, and still sighed.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Prevost does not understand the affair,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 continued Lord Eskdale. \u00e2\u0080\u0098Why\nI wished you to come down here, Leander, was not to receive the applause\nof my cousin and his guests, but to form their taste.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nHere was a great idea; exciting and ennobling. It threw quite a new\nlight upon the position of Leander. He started; his brow seemed to\nclear. Leander, then, like other eminent men, had duties to perform as\nwell as rights to enjoy; he had a right to fame, but it was also his\nduty to form and direct public taste. That then was the reason he\nwas brought down to Bellamont Castle; because some of the greatest\npersonages in England, who never had eaten a proper dinner in their\nlives, would have an opportunity, for the first time, of witnessing art.\nWhat could the praise of the Duke of Clanronald, or Lord Hampshire,\nor Lord Hull, signify to one who had shared the confidence of a Lord\nMonmouth, and whom Sir Alexander Grant, the first judge in Europe,\nhad declared the only man of genius of the age? Leander erred too\nin supposing that his achievements had been lost upon the guests at\nBellamont. Insensibly his feats had set them a-thinking. They had been\nlike Cossacks in a picture-gallery; but the Clanronalds, the Hampshires,\nthe Hulls, would return to their homes impressed with a great truth,\nthat there is a difference between eating and dining. Was this nothing\nfor Leander to have effected? Was it nothing, by this development of\ntaste, to assist in supporting that aristocratic influence which he\nwished to cherish, and which can alone encourage art? If anything can\nsave the aristocracy in this levelling age, it is an appreciation of men\nof genius. Certainly it would have been very gratifying to Leander\nif his Grace had only sent him a message, or if Lord Montacute had\nexpressed a wish to see him. He had been long musing over some dish\n_\u00c3\u00a0 la Montacute_ for this very day. The young lord was reputed to have\ntalent; this dish might touch his fancy; the homage of a great artist\nflatters youth; this offering of genius might colour his destiny. But\nwhat, after all, did this signify? Leander had a mission to perform.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098If I were you, I would exert myself, Leander,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Lord Eskdale.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Ah! my lord, if all men were like you! If artists were only sure of\nbeing appreciated; if we were but understood, a dinner would become a\nsacrifice to the gods, and a kitchen would be Paradise.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nIn the meantime, the mayor and town-councillors of Montacute, in their\nrobes of office, and preceded by their bedels and their mace-bearer,\nhave entered the gates of the castle. They pass into the great hall,\nthe most ancient part of the building, with its open roof of Spanish\nchestnut, its screen and gallery and dais, its painted windows and\nmarble floor. Ascending the dais, they are ushered into an antechamber,\nthe first of that suite of state apartments that opens on the terrace.\nLeaving on one side the principal dining-room and the library, they\nproceeded through the green drawing-room, so called from its silken\nhangings, the red drawing-room, covered with ruby velvet, and both\nadorned, but not encumbered, with pictures of the choicest art, into the\nprincipal or duchesses\u00e2\u0080\u0099 drawing-room, thus entitled from its complete\ncollection of portraits of Duchesses of Bellamont. It was a spacious and\nbeautifully proportioned chamber, hung with amber satin, its ceiling by\nZucchero, whose rich colours were relieved by the burnished gilding.\nThe corporation trod tremblingly over the gorgeous carpet of Axminster,\nwhich displayed, in vivid colours and colossal proportions, the shield\nand supporters of Bellamont, and threw a hasty glance at the vases of\nporphyry and malachite, and mosaic tables covered with precious toys,\nwhich were grouped about.\n\nThence they were ushered into the Montacute room, adorned, among many\ninteresting pictures, by perhaps the finest performance of Lawrence,\na portrait of the present duke, just after his marriage. Tall and\ngraceful, with a clear dark complexion, regular features, eyes of liquid\ntenderness, a frank brow, and rich clustering hair, the accomplished\nartist had seized and conveyed the character of a high-spirited but\ngentle-hearted cavalier. From the Montacute chamber they entered\nthe ball-room; very spacious, white and gold, a coved ceiling, large\nVenetian lustres, and the walls of looking-glass, enclosing friezes of\nfestive sculpture. Then followed another antechamber, in the centre\nof which was one of the masterpieces of Canova. This room, lined with\nfootmen in state liveries, completed the suite that opened on the\nterrace. The northern side of this chamber consisted of a large door,\ndivided, and decorated in its panels with emblazoned shields of arms.\n\nThe valves being thrown open, the mayor and town-council of Montacute\nwere ushered into a gallery one hundred feet long, and which occupied\na great portion of the northern side of the castle. The panels of this\ngallery enclosed a series of pictures in tapestry, which represented the\nprincipal achievements of the third crusade. A Montacute had been one\nof the most distinguished knights in that great adventure, and had saved\nthe life of Cour de Lion at the siege of Ascalon. In after-ages a Duke\nof Bellamont, who was our ambassador at Paris, had given orders to\nthe Gobelins factory for the execution of this series of pictures from\ncartoons by the most celebrated artists of the time. The subjects of the\ntapestry had obtained for the magnificent chamber, which they adorned\nand rendered so interesting, the title of \u00e2\u0080\u0098The Crusaders\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Gallery.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nAt the end of this gallery, surrounded by their guests, their relatives,\nand their neighbours; by high nobility, by reverend prelates, by the\nmembers and notables of the county, and by some of the chief tenants of\nthe duke, a portion of whom were never absent from any great carousing\nor high ceremony that occurred within his walls, the Duke and Duchess\nof Bellamont and their son, a little in advance of the company, stood\nto receive the congratulatory addresses of the mayor and corporation\nof their ancient and faithful town of Montacute; the town which their\nfathers had built and adorned, which they had often represented in\nParliament in the good old days, and which they took care should then\nenjoy its fair proportion of the good old things; a town, every house in\nwhich belonged to them, and of which there was not an inhabitant who, in\nhis own person or in that of his ancestry, had not felt the advantages\nof the noble connection.\n\nThe duke bowed to the corporation, with the duchess on his left hand;\nand on his right there stood a youth, above the middle height and of a\nframe completely and gracefully formed. His dark brown hair, in those\nhyacinthine curls which Grecian poets have celebrated, and which Grecian\nsculptors have immortalised, clustered over his brow, which,\nhowever, they only partially concealed. It was pale, as was his whole\ncountenance, but the liquid richness of the dark brown eye, and the\ncolour of the lip, denoted anything but a languid circulation. The\nfeatures were regular, and inclined rather to a refinement which might\nhave imparted to the countenance a character of too much delicacy, had\nit not been for the deep meditation of the brow, and for the lower part\nof the visage, which intimated indomitable will and an iron resolution.\n\nPlaced for the first time in his life in a public position, and under\ncircumstances which might have occasioned some degree of embarrassment\neven to those initiated in the world, nothing was more remarkable in the\ndemeanour of Lord Montacute than his self-possession; nor was there\nin his carriage anything studied, or which had the character of being\npreconceived. Every movement or gesture was distinguished by what may be\ncalled a graceful gravity. With a total absence of that excitement which\nseemed so natural to his age and situation, there was nothing in his\nmanner which approached to nonchalance or indifference. It would\nappear that he duly estimated the importance of the event they were\ncommemorating, yet was not of a habit of mind that overestimated\nanything.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII.\n\n     _A Strange Proposal_\n\nTHE week of celebration was over: some few guests remained, near\nrelatives, and not very rich, the Montacute Mountjoys, for example.\nThey came from a considerable distance, and the duke insisted that they\nshould remain until the duchess went to London, an event, by-the-bye,\nwhich was to occur very speedily. Lady Eleanor was rather agreeable, and\nthe duchess a little liked her; there were four daughters, to be sure,\nand not very lively, but they sang in the evening.\n\nIt was a bright morning, and the duchess, with a heart prophetic of\nhappiness, wished to disburthen it to her son; she meant to propose to\nhim, therefore, to be her companion in her walk, and she had sent to his\nrooms in vain, and was inquiring after him, when she was informed that\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Lord Montacute was with his Grace.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nA smile of satisfaction flitted over her face, as she recalled the\npleasant cause of the conference that was now taking place between the\nfather and the son.\n\nLet us see how it advanced.\n\nThe duke is in his private library, consisting chiefly of the statutes\nat large, Hansard, the Annual Register, Parliamentary Reports, and legal\ntreatises on the powers and duties of justices of the peace. A portrait\nof his mother is over the mantel-piece: opposite it a huge map of the\ncounty. His correspondence on public business with the secretary of\nstate, and the various authorities of the shire, is admirably arranged:\nfor the duke was what is called an excellent man of business, that is\nto say, methodical, and an adept in all the small arts of routine. These\npapers were deposited, after having been ticketed with a date and a\nsummary of their contents, and tied with much tape, in a large cabinet,\nwhich occupied nearly one side of the room, and on the top of which were\nbusts in marble of Mr. Pitt, George III., and the Duke of Wellington.\n\nThe duke was leaning back in his chair, which it seemed, from his air\nand position, he had pushed back somewhat suddenly from his writing\ntable, and an expression of painful surprise, it cannot be denied, dwelt\non his countenance. Lord Montacute was on his legs, leaning with his\nleft arm on the chimney-piece, very serious, and, if possible, paler\nthan usual.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098You take me quite by surprise,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said the duke; \u00e2\u0080\u0098I thought it was an\narrangement that would have deeply gratified you.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nLord Montacute slightly bowed his head, but said nothing. His father\ncontinued.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Not wish to enter Parliament at present! Why, that is all very well,\nand if, as was once the case, we could enter Parliament when we liked,\nand how we liked, the wish might be very reasonable. If I could ring my\nbell, and return you member for Montacute with as much ease as I could\nsend over to Bellamont to engage a special train to take us to town, you\nmight be justified in indulging a fancy. But how and when, I should like\nto know, are you to enter Parliament now? This Parliament will last:\nit will go on to the lees. Lord Eskdale told me so not a week ago. Well\nthen, at any rate, you lose three years: for three years you are an\nidler. I never thought that was your character. I have always had an\nimpression you would turn your mind to public business, that the county\nmight look up to you. If you have what are called higher views, you\nshould not forget there is a great opening now in public life, which\nmay not offer again. The Duke is resolved to give the preference, in\ncarrying on the business of the country, to the aristocracy. He believes\nthis is our only means of preservation. He told me so himself. If it be\nso, I fear we are doomed. I hope we may be of some use to our country\nwithout being ministers of state. But let that pass. As long as the\nDuke lives, he is omnipotent, and will have his way. If you come into\nParliament now, and show any disposition for office, you may rely upon\nit you will not long be unemployed. I have no doubt I could arrange that\nyou should move the address of next session. I dare say Lord Eskdale\ncould manage this, and, if he could not, though I abhor asking a\nminister for anything, I should, under the circumstances, feel perfectly\njustified in speaking to the Duke on the subject myself, and,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 added his\nGrace, in a lowered tone, but with an expression of great earnestness\nand determination, \u00e2\u0080\u0098I flatter myself that if the Duke of Bellamont\nchooses to express a wish, it would not be disregarded.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nLord Montacute cast his dark, intelligent eyes upon the floor, and\nseemed plunged in thought.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Besides,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 added the duke, after a moment\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pause, and inferring, from\nthe silence of his son, that he was making an impression, \u00e2\u0080\u0098suppose\nHungerford is not in the same humour this time three years which he is\nin now. Probably he may be; possibly he may not. Men do not like to\nbe baulked when they think they are doing a very kind and generous and\nmagnanimous thing. Hungerford is not a warming-pan; we must remember\nthat; he never was originally, and if he had been, he has been member\nfor the county too long to be so considered now. I should be placed in\na most painful position, if, this time three years, I had to withdraw my\nsupport from Hungerford, in order to secure your return.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098There would be no necessity, under any circumstances, for that, my dear\nfather,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Lord Montacute, looking up, and speaking in a voice which,\nthough somewhat low, was of that organ that at once arrests attention; a\nvoice that comes alike from the brain and from the heart, and seems made\nto convey both profound thought and deep emotion. There is no index of\ncharacter so sure as the voice. There are tones, tones brilliant and\ngushing, which impart a quick and pathetic sensibility: there are others\nthat, deep and yet calm, seem the just interpreters of a serene and\nexalted intellect. But the rarest and the most precious of all voices\nis that which combines passion and repose; and whose rich and restrained\ntones exercise, perhaps, on the human frame a stronger spell than even\nthe fascination of the eye, or that bewitching influence of the hand,\nwhich is the privilege of the higher races of Asia.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098There would be no necessity, under any circumstances, for that, my dear\nfather,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Lord Montacute, \u00e2\u0080\u0098for, to be frank, I believe I should feel\nas little disposed to enter Parliament three years hence as now.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nThe duke looked still more surprised. \u00e2\u0080\u0098Mr. Fox was not of age when he\ntook his seat,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said his Grace. \u00e2\u0080\u0098You know how old Mr. Pitt was when\nhe was a minister. Sir Robert, too, was in harness very early. I have\nalways heard the good judges say, Lord Esk-dale, for example, that a man\nmight speak in Parliament too soon, but it was impossible to go in too\nsoon.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098If he wished to succeed in that assembly,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 replied Lord Montacute,\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I can easily believe it. In all things an early initiation must be of\nadvantage. But I have not that wish.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t like to see a man take his seat in the House of Lords who has\nnot been in the House of Commons. He seems to me always, in a manner,\nunfledged.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098It will be a long time, I hope, my dear father, before I take my seat\nin the House of Lords,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Lord Montacute, \u00e2\u0080\u0098if, indeed, I ever do.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098In the course of nature \u00e2\u0080\u0098tis a certainty.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Suppose the Duke\u00e2\u0080\u0099s plan for perpetuating an aristocracy do not\nsucceed,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Lord Montacute, \u00e2\u0080\u0098and our house ceases to exist?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nHis father shrugged his shoulders. \u00e2\u0080\u0098It is not our business to suppose\nthat. I hope it never will be the business of any one, at least\nseriously. This is a great country, and it has become great by its\naristocracy.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098You think, then, our sovereigns did nothing for our greatness,--Queen\nElizabeth, for example, of whose visit to Montacute you are so proud?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098They performed their part.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098And have ceased to exist. We may have performed our part, and may meet\nthe same fate.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Why, you are talking liberalism!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Hardly that, my dear father, for I have not expressed an opinion.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I wish I knew what your opinions were, my dear boy, or even your\nwishes.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Well, then, to do my duty.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Exactly; you are a pillar of the State; support the State.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Ah! if any one would but tell me what the State is,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Lord\nMontacute, sighing. \u00e2\u0080\u0098It seems to me your pillars remain, but they\nsupport nothing; in that case, though the shafts may be perpendicular,\nand the capitals very ornate, they are no longer props, they are a\nruin.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098You would hand us over, then, to the ten-pounders?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098They do not even pretend to be a State,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Lord Montacute; \u00e2\u0080\u0098they do\nnot even profess to support anything; on the contrary, the essence of\ntheir philosophy is, that nothing is to be established, and everything\nis to be left to itself.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098The common sense of this country and the fifty pound clause will carry\nus through,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said the duke.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Through what?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 inquired his son.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098This--this state of transition,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 replied his father.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098A passage to what?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Ah! that is a question the wisest cannot answer.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098But into which the weakest, among whom I class myself, have surely a\nright to inquire.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Unquestionably; and I know nothing that will tend more to assist you in\nyour researches than acting with practical men.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098And practising all their blunders,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Lord Montacute. \u00e2\u0080\u0098I can\nconceive an individual who has once been entrapped into their haphazard\ncourses, continuing in the fatal confusion to which he has contributed\nhis quota; but I am at least free, and I wish to continue so.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098And do nothing?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098But does it follow that a man is infirm of action because he declines\nfighting in the dark?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098And how would you act, then? What are your plans? Have you any?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I have.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Well, that is satisfactory,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said the duke, with animation. \u00e2\u0080\u0098Whatever\nthey are, you know you may count upon my doing everything that is\npossible to forward your wishes. I know they cannot be unworthy ones,\nfor I believe, my child, you are incapable of a thought that is not good\nor great.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I wish I knew what was good and great,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Lord Montacute; \u00e2\u0080\u0098I would\nstruggle to accomplish it.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098But you have formed some views; you have some plans. Speak to me of\nthem, and without reserve; as to a friend, the most affectionate, the\nmost devoted.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098My father,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Lord Montacute, and moving, he drew a chair to the\ntable, and seated himself by the duke, \u00e2\u0080\u0098you possess and have a right to\nmy confidence. I ought not to have said that I doubted about what was\ngood; for I know you.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Sons like you make good fathers.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098It is not always so,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Lord Montacute; \u00e2\u0080\u0098you have been to me more\nthan a father, and I bear to you and to my mother a profound and fervent\naffection; an affection,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he added, in a faltering tone, \u00e2\u0080\u0098that is rarer,\nI believe, in this age than it was in old days. I feel it at this moment\nmore deeply,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he continued, in a firmer tone, \u00e2\u0080\u0098because I am about to\npropose that we should for a time separate.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nThe duke turned pale, and leant forward in his chair, but did not speak.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098You have proposed to me to-day,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 continued Lord Montacute, after a\nmomentary pause, \u00e2\u0080\u0098to enter public life. I do not shrink from its duties.\nOn the contrary, from the position in which I am born, still more from\nthe impulse of my nature, I am desirous to fulfil them. I have meditated\non them, I may say, even for years. But I cannot find that it is part of\nmy duty to maintain the order of things, for I will not call it system,\nwhich at present prevails in our country. It seems to me that it cannot\nlast, as nothing can endure, or ought to endure, that is not founded\nupon principle; and its principle I have not discovered. In nothing,\nwhether it be religion, or government, or manners, sacred or political\nor social life, do I find faith; and if there be no faith, how can there\nbe duty? Is there such a thing as religious truth? Is there such a thing\nas political right? Is there such a thing as social propriety? Are these\nfacts, or are they mere phrases? And if they be facts, where are they\nlikely to be found in England? Is truth in our Church? Why, then, do\nyou support dissent? Who has the right to govern? The monarch? You have\nrobbed him of his prerogative. The aristocracy? You confess to me that\nwe exist by sufferance. The people? They themselves tell you that they\nare nullities. Every session of that Parliament in which you wish to\nintroduce me, the method by which power is distributed is called in\nquestion, altered, patched up, and again impugned. As for our morals,\ntell me, is charity the supreme virtue, or the greatest of errors? Our\nsocial system ought to depend on a clear conception of this point. Our\nmorals differ in different counties, in different towns, in different\nstreets, even in different Acts of Parliament. What is moral in London\nis immoral in Montacute; what is crime among the multitude is only vice\namong the few.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098You are going into first principles,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said the duke, much surprised.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Give me then second principles,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 replied his son; \u00e2\u0080\u0098give me any.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098We must take a general view of things to form an opinion,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said his\nfather, mildly. \u00e2\u0080\u0098The general condition of England is superior to that of\nany other country; it cannot be denied that, on the whole, there is more\npolitical freedom, more social happiness, more sound religion, and more\nmaterial prosperity among us, than in any nation in the world.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I might question all that,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said his son; \u00e2\u0080\u0098but they are considerations\nthat do not affect my views. If other States are worse than we are, and\nI hope they are not, our condition is not mended, but the contrary, for\nwe then need the salutary stimulus of example.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098There is no sort of doubt,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said the duke, \u00e2\u0080\u0098that the state of England\nat this moment is the most flourishing that has ever existed, certainly\nin modern times. What with these railroads, even the condition of the\npoor, which I admit was lately far from satisfactory, is infinitely\nimproved. Every man has work who needs it, and wages are even high.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098The railroads may have improved, in a certain sense, the condition of\nthe working classes almost as much as that of members of Parliament.\nThey have been a good thing for both of them. And if you think that more\nlabour is all that is wanted by the people of England, we may be\neasy for a time. I see nothing in this fresh development of material\nindustry, but fresh causes of moral deterioration. You have announced to\nthe millions that there welfare is to be tested by the amount of their\nwages. Money is to be the cupel of their worth, as it is of all other\nclasses. You propose for their conduct the least ennobling of all\nimpulses. If you have seen an aristocracy invariably become degraded\nunder such influence; if all the vices of a middle class may be traced\nto such an absorbing motive; why are we to believe that the people\nshould be more pure, or that they should escape the catastrophe of the\npolicy that confounds the happiness with the wealth of nations?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nThe duke shook his head and then said, \u00e2\u0080\u0098You should not forget we live in\nan artificial state.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098So I often hear, sir,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 replied his son; \u00e2\u0080\u0098but where is the art? It seems\nto me the very quality wanting to our present condition. Art is order,\nmethod, harmonious results obtained by fine and powerful principles. I\nsee no art in our condition. The people of this country have ceased to\nbe a nation. They are a crowd, and only kept in some rude provisional\ndiscipline by the remains of that old system which they are daily\ndestroying.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098But what would you do, my dear boy?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said his Grace, looking up\nvery distressed. \u00e2\u0080\u0098Can you remedy the state of things in which we find\nourselves?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I am not a teacher,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Lord Montacute, mournfully; \u00e2\u0080\u0098I only ask you,\nI supplicate you, my dear father, to save me from contributing to this\nquick corruption that surrounds us.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098You shall be master of your own actions. I offer you counsel, I give no\ncommands; and, as for the rest, Providence will guard us.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098If an angel would but visit our house as he visited the house of Lot!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\nsaid Montacute, in a tone almost of anguish.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Angels have performed their part,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said the duke. \u00e2\u0080\u0098We have received\ninstructions from one higher than angels. It is enough for all of us.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098It is not enough for me,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Lord Montacute, with a glowing cheek,\nand rising abruptly. \u00e2\u0080\u0098It was not enough for the Apostles; for though\nthey listened to the sermon on the mount, and partook of the first\ncommunion, it was still necessary that He should appear to them\nagain, and promise them a Comforter. I require one,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he added, after\na momentary pause, but in an agitated voice. \u00e2\u0080\u0098I must seek one. Yes! my\ndear father, it is of this that I would speak to you; it is this which\nfor a long time has oppressed my spirit, and filled me often with\nintolerable gloom. We must separate. I must leave you, I must leave\nthat dear mother, those beloved parents, in whom are concentred all\nmy earthly affections; but I obey an impulse that I believe comes\nfrom above. Dearest and best of men, you will not thwart me; you will\nforgive, you will aid me!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 And he advanced and threw himself into the\narms of his father.\n\nThe duke pressed Lord Montacute to his heart, and endeavoured, though\nhimself agitated and much distressed, to penetrate the mystery of this\nebullition. \u00e2\u0080\u0098He says we must separate,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 thought the duke to himself.\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Ah! he has lived too much at home, too much alone; he has read and\npondered too much; he has moped. Eskdale was right two years ago. I wish\nI had sent him to Paris, but his mother was so alarmed; and, indeed,\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098tis a precious life! The House of Commons would have been just the\nthing for him. He would have worked on committees and grown practical.\nBut something must be done for him, dear child! He says we must\nseparate; he wants to travel. And perhaps he ought to travel. But a life\non which so much depends! And what will Katherine say? It will kill her.\nI could screw myself up to it. I would send him well attended. Brace\nshould go with him; he understands the Continent; he was in the\nPeninsular war; and he should have a skilful physician. I see how it is;\nI must act with decision, and break it to his mother.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nThese ideas passed through the duke\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mind during the few seconds\nthat he embraced his son, and endeavoured at the same time to convey\nconsolation by the expression of his affection, and his anxiety at all\ntimes to contribute to his child\u00e2\u0080\u0099s happiness.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098My dear son,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said the duke, when Lord Montacute had resumed his seat,\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I see how it is; you wish to travel?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nLord Montacute bent his head, as if in assent.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098It will be a terrible blow to your mother; I say nothing of myself.\nYou know what I feel for you. But neither your mother nor myself have a\nright to place our feelings in competition with any arrangement for your\nwelfare. It would be in the highest degree selfish and unreasonable;\nand perhaps it will be well for you to travel awhile; and, as for\nParliament, I am to see Hungerford this morning at Bellamont. I will try\nand arrange with him to postpone his resignation until the autumn,\nor, if possible, for some little time longer. You will then have\naccomplished your purpose. It will do you a great deal of good. You will\nhave seen the world, and you can take your seat next year.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nThe duke paused. Lord Montacute looked perplexed and distressed; he\nseemed about to reply, and then, leaning on the table, with his face\nconcealed from his father, he maintained his silence. The duke rose,\nlooked at his watch, said he must be at Bellamont by two o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock,\nhoped that Brace would dine at the castle to-day, thought it not at\nall impossible Brace might, would send on to Montacute for him, perhaps\nmight meet him at Bellamont. Brace understood the Continent, spoke\nseveral languages, Spanish among them, though it was not probable his\nson would have any need of that, the present state of Spain not being\nvery inviting to the traveller.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098As for France,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said the duke, \u00e2\u0080\u0098France is Paris, and I suppose that\nwill be your first step; it generally is. We must see if your cousin,\nHenry Howard, is there. If so, he will put you in the way of everything.\nWith the embassy and Brace, you would manage very well at Paris. Then, I\nsuppose, you would like to go to Italy; that, I apprehend, is your great\npoint. Your mother will not like your going to Rome. Still, at the same\ntime, a man, they say, should see Rome before he dies. I never did. I\nhave never crossed the sea except to go to Ireland. Your grandfather\nwould never let me travel; I wanted to, but he never would. Not,\nhowever, for the same reasons which have kept you at home. Suppose you\neven winter at Rome, which I believe is the right thing, why, you might\nvery well be back by the spring. However, we must manage your mother a\nlittle about remaining over the winter, and, on second thoughts, we will\nget Bernard to go with you, as well as Brace and a physician, and then\nshe will be much more easy. I think, with Brace, Bernard, and a medical\nman whom we can really trust, Harry Howard at Paris, and the best\nletters for every other place, which we will consult Lord Eskdale about,\nI think the danger will not be extreme.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I have no wish to see Paris,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Lord Montacute, evidently\nembarrassed, and making a great effort to relieve his mind of some\nburthen. \u00e2\u0080\u0098I have no wish to see Paris.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I am very glad to hear that,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said his father, eagerly.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Nor do I wish either to go to Rome,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 continued his son.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Well, well, you have taken a load off my mind, my dear boy. I would not\nconfess it, because I wish to save you pain; but really, I believe\nthe idea of your going to Rome would have been a serious shock to your\nmother. It is not so much the distance, though that is great, nor the\nclimate, which has its dangers, but, you understand, with her peculiar\nviews, her very strict----\u00e2\u0080\u0099 The duke did not care to finish his\nsentence.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Nor, my dear father,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 continued Lord Montacute, \u00e2\u0080\u0098though I did not like\nto interrupt you when you were speaking with so much solicitude and\nconsideration for me, is it exactly travel, in the common acceptation of\nthe term, that I feel the need of. I wish, indeed, to leave England; I\nwish to make an expedition; a progress to a particular point; without\nwandering, without any intervening residence. In a word, it is the Holy\nLand that occupies my thought, and I propose to make a pilgrimage to the\nsepulchre of my Saviour.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nThe duke started, and sank again into his chair. \u00e2\u0080\u0098The Holy Land! The\nHoly Sepulchre!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he exclaimed, and repeated to himself, staring at his\nson.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Yes, sir, the Holy Sepulchre,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 repeated Lord Mon-tacute, and now\nspeaking with his accustomed repose. \u00e2\u0080\u0098When I remember that the Creator,\nsince light sprang out of darkness, has deigned to reveal Himself to His\ncreature only in one land, that in that land He assumed a manly form,\nand met a human death, I feel persuaded that the country sanctified by\nsuch intercourse and such events must be endowed with marvellous and\npeculiar qualities, which man may not in all ages be competent\nto penetrate, but which, nevertheless, at all times exercise an\nirresistible influence upon his destiny. It is these qualities that many\ntimes drew Europe to Asia during the middle centuries. Our castle has\nbefore this sent forth a De Montacute to Palestine. For three days and\nthree nights he knelt at the tomb of his Redeemer. Six centuries and\nmore have elapsed since that great enterprise. It is time to restore and\nrenovate our communications with the Most High. I, too, would kneel at\nthat tomb; I, too, surrounded by the holy hills and sacred groves of\nJerusalem, would relieve my spirit from the bale that bows it down;\nwould lift up my voice to heaven, and ask, What is duty, and what is\nfaith? What ought I to do, and what ought I to believe?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nThe Duke of Bellamont rose from his seat, and walked up and down the\nroom for some minutes, in silence and in deep thought. At length,\nstopping and leaning against the cabinet, he said, \u00e2\u0080\u0098What has occurred\nto-day between us, my beloved child, is, you may easily believe, as\nstrange to me as it is agitating. I will think of all you have said;\nI will try to comprehend all you mean and wish. I will endeavour to do\nthat which is best and wisest; placing above all things your happiness,\nand not our own. At this moment I am not competent to the task: I need\nquiet, and to be alone. Your mother, I know, wishes to walk with you\nthis morning. She may be speaking to you of many things. Be silent upon\nthis subject, until I have communicated with her. At present I will ride\nover to Bellamont. I must go; and, besides, it will do me good. I never\ncan think very well except in the saddle. If Brace comes, make him dine\nhere. God bless you.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nThe duke left the room; his son remained in meditation. The first step\nwas taken. He had poured into the interview of an hour the results of\nthree years of solitary thought. A sound roused him; it was his mother.\nShe had only learnt casually that the duke was gone; she was surprised\nhe had not come into her room before he went; it seemed the first time\nsince their marriage that the duke had gone out without first coming to\nspeak to her. So she went to seek her son, to congratulate him on being\na member of Parliament, on representing the county of which they were\nso fond, and of breaking to him a proposition which she doubted not he\nwould find not less interesting and charming. Happy mother, with her\nonly son, on whom she doted and of whom she was so justly proud, about\nto enter public life in which he was sure to distinguish himself, and to\nmarry a woman who was sure to make him happy! With a bounding heart the\nduchess opened the library door, where she had been informed she should\nfind Lord Montacute. She had her bonnet on, ready for the walk of\nconfidence, and, her face flushed with delight, she looked even\nbeautiful. \u00e2\u0080\u0098Ah!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 she exclaimed, \u00e2\u0080\u0098I have been looking for you, Tancred!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n[Illustration: frontis-p72]\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII.\n\n     _The Decision_\n\nTHE duke returned rather late from Bellamont, and went immediately to\nhis dressing-room. A few minutes before dinner the duchess knocked at\nhis door and entered. She seemed disconcerted, and reminded him, though\nwith great gentleness, that he had gone out to-day without first bidding\nher adieu; she really believed it was the only time he had done so since\ntheir marriage. The duke, who, when she entered, anticipated something\nabout their son, was relieved by her remark, embraced her, and would\nhave affected a gaiety which he did not really feel.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I am glad to hear that Brace dines here to-day, Kate, for I\nparticularly wanted to see him.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nThe duchess did not reply, and seemed absent; the duke, to say\nsomething, tying his cravat, kept harping upon Brace.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Never mind Brace, George,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said the duchess; \u00e2\u0080\u0098tell me what is this\nabout Tancred? Why is his coming into Parliament put off?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nThe duke was perplexed; he wished to know how far at this moment his\nwife was informed upon the matter; the feminine frankness of the\nduchess put him out of suspense. \u00e2\u0080\u0098I have been walking with Tancred,\u00e2\u0080\u0099\nshe continued, \u00e2\u0080\u0098and intimated, but with great caution, all our plans and\nhopes. I asked him what he thought of his cousin; he agrees with us\nshe is by far the most charming girl he knows, and one of the\nmost agreeable. I impressed upon him how good she was. I wished to\nprecipitate nothing. I never dreamed of their marrying until late in the\nautumn. I wished him to become acquainted with his new life, which would\nnot prevent him seeing a great deal of Katherine in London, and then to\nvisit them in Ireland, as you visited us, George; and then, when I was\nsettling everything in the most delightful manner, what he was to do\nwhen he was kept up very late at the House, which is the only part I\ndon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t like, and begging him to be very strict in making his servant\nalways have coffee ready for him, very hot, and a cold fowl too, or\nsomething of the sort, he tells me, to my infinite astonishment, that\nthe vacancy will not immediately occur, that he is not sorry for it, as\nhe thinks it may be as well that he should go abroad. What can all this\nmean? Pray tell me; for Tancred has told me nothing, and, when I pressed\nhim, waived the subject, and said we would all of us consult together.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098And so we will, Kate,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said the duke, \u00e2\u0080\u0098but hardly at this moment, for\ndinner must be almost served. To be brief,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he added, speaking in a\nlight tone, \u00e2\u0080\u0098there are reasons which perhaps may make it expedient that\nHungerford should not resign at the present moment; and as Tancred has a\nfancy to travel a little, it may be as well that we should take it into\nconsideration whether he might not profitably occupy the interval in\nthis manner.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Profitably!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said the duchess. \u00e2\u0080\u0098I never can understand how going\nto Paris and Rome, which young men always mean when they talk of\ntravelling, can be profitable to him; it is the very thing which, all my\nlife, I have been endeavouring to prevent. His body and his soul will be\nboth imperilled; Paris will destroy his constitution, and Rome, perhaps,\nchange his faith.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I have more confidence in his physical power and his religious\nprinciple than you, Kate,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said the duke, smiling. \u00e2\u0080\u0098But make yourself\neasy on these heads; Tancred told me this morning that he had no wish to\nvisit either Rome or Paris.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Well!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 exclaimed the duchess, somewhat relieved, \u00e2\u0080\u0098if he wants to make\na little tour in Holland, I think I could bear it; it is a Protestant\ncountry, and there are no vermin. And then those dear Disbrowes, I am\nsure, would take care of him at The Hague.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098We will talk of all this to-night, my love,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said the duke; and\noffering his arm to his wife, who was more composed, if not more\ncheerful, they descended to their guests.\n\nColonel Brace was there, to the duke\u00e2\u0080\u0099s great satisfaction. The colonel\nhad served as a cornet in a dragoon regiment in the last campaign of\nthe Peninsular war, and had marched into Paris. Such an event makes an\nindelible impression on the memory of a handsome lad of seventeen, and\nthe colonel had not yet finished recounting his strange and fortunate\nadventures.\n\nHe was tall, robust, a little portly, but, well buckled, still presented\na grand military figure. He was what you call a fine man; florid, with\nstill a good head of hair though touched with grey, splendid moustaches,\nlarge fat hands, and a courtly demeanour not unmixed with a slight\nswagger. The colonel was a Montacute man, and had inherited a large\nhouse in the town and a small estate in the neighbourhood. Having\nsold out, he had retired to his native place, where he had become a\nconsiderable personage. The duke had put him in the commission, and\nhe was the active magistrate of the district; he had reorganised the\nBellamont regiment of yeomanry cavalry, which had fallen into sad\ndecay during the late duke\u00e2\u0080\u0099s time, but which now, with Brace for its\nlieutenant-colonel, was second to none in the kingdom. Colonel Brace was\none of the best shots in the county; certainly the boldest rider among\nthe heavy weights; and bore the palm from all with the rod, in a county\nfamous for its feats in lake and river.\n\nThe colonel was a man of great energy, of good temper, of ready\nresource, frank, a little coarse, but hearty and honest. He adored the\nDuke and Duchess of Bellamont. He was sincere; he was not a parasite;\nhe really believed that they were the best people in the world, and I am\nnot sure that he had not some foundation for his faith. On the whole,\nhe might be esteemed the duke\u00e2\u0080\u0099s right-hand man. His Grace generally\nconsulted the colonel on county affairs; the command of the yeomanry\nalone gave him a considerable position; he was the chief also of the\nmilitia staff; could give his opinion whether a person was to be made a\nmagistrate or not; and had even been called into council when there was\na question of appointing a deputy-lieutenant. The colonel, who was a\nleading member of the corporation of Montacute, had taken care to be\nchosen mayor this year; he had been also chairman of the Committee of\nManagement during the celebration of Tancred\u00e2\u0080\u0099s majority; had had the\nentire ordering of the fireworks, and was generally supposed to have\ngiven the design, or at least the leading idea, for the transparency.\n\nWe should notice also Mr. Bernard, a clergyman, and recently the private\ntutor of Lord Montacute, a good scholar; in ecclesiastical opinions,\nwhat is called high and dry. He was about five-and-thirty; well-looking,\nbashful. The duke intended to prefer him to a living when one was\nvacant; in the meantime he remained in the family, and at present\ndischarged the duties of chaplain and librarian at Montacute, and\noccasionally assisted the duke as private secretary. Of his life, one\nthird had been passed at a rural home, and the rest might be nearly\ndivided between school and college.\n\nThese gentlemen, the distinguished and numerous family of the Montacute\nMountjoys, young Hunger-ford, whom the duke had good-naturedly brought\nover from Bellamont for the sake of the young ladies, the duke and\nduchess, and their son, formed the party, which presented rather a\ncontrast, not only in its numbers, to the series of recent banquets.\nThey dined in the Montacute chamber. The party, without intending\nit, was rather dull and silent. The duchess was brooding over the\ndisappointment of the morning; the duke trembled for the disclosures\nof the morrow. The Misses Mountjoy sang better than they talked; their\nmother, who was more lively, was seated by the duke, and confined her\npowers of pleasing to him. The Honourable and Reverend Montacute himself\nwas an epicure, and disliked conversation during dinner. Lord Montacute\nspoke to Mr. Hungerford across the table, but Mr. Hungerford was\nwhispering despairing nothings in the ear of Arabella Mountjoy, and\nreplied to his question without originating any in return, which of\ncourse terminates talk.\n\nWhen the second course had arrived, the duke, who wanted a little more\nnoise and distraction, fired off in despair a shot at Colonel Brace,\nwho was on the left hand of the duchess, and set him on his yeomanry\ncharger. From this moment affairs improved. The colonel made continual\ncharges, and carried all before him. Nothing could be more noisy in a\ngenteel way. His voice sounded like the bray of a trumpet amid the din\nof arms; it seemed that the moment he began, everybody and everything\nbecame animated and inspired by his example. All talked; the duke set\nthem the fashion of taking wine with each other; Lord Montacute managed\nto entrap Arminta Mountjoy into a narrative in detail of her morning\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nride and adventures; and, affecting scepticism as to some of the\nincidents, and wonder at some of the feats, produced a considerable\naddition to the general hubbub, which he instinctively felt that his\nfather wished to encourage.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know whether it was the Great Western or the South Eastern,\u00e2\u0080\u0099\ncontinued Colonel Brace; \u00e2\u0080\u0098but I know his leg is broken.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098God bless me!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said the duke; \u00e2\u0080\u0098and only think of my not hearing of it\nat Bellamont to-day!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t suppose they know anything about it,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 replied the colonel. \u00e2\u0080\u0098The\nway I know it is this: I was with Roby to-day, when the post came in,\nand he said to me, \u00e2\u0080\u009cHere is a letter from Lady Malpas; I hope nothing\nis the matter with Sir Russell or any of the children.\u00e2\u0080\u009d And then it all\ncame out. The train was blown up behind; Sir Russell was in a centre\ncarriage, and was pitched right into a field. They took him into an inn,\nput him to bed, and sent for some of the top-sawyers from London, Sir\nBenjamin Brodie, and that sort of thing; and the moment Sir Russell came\nto himself, he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI must have Roby, send for Roby, Roby knows my\nconstitution.\u00e2\u0080\u009d And they sent for Roby. And I think he was right. The\nquantity of young officers I have seen sent rightabout in the Peninsula,\nbecause they were attended by a parcel of men who knew nothing of their\nconstitution! Why, I might have lost my own leg once, if I had not been\nsharp. I got a scratch in a little affair at Almeidas, charging the\nenemy a little too briskly; but we really ought not to speak of these\nthings before the ladies----\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098My dear colonel,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Lord Montacute, \u00e2\u0080\u0098on the contrary, there\nis nothing more interesting to them. Miss Mountjoy was saying only\nyesterday, that there was nothing she found so difficult to understand\nas the account of a battle, and how much she wished to comprehend it.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098That is because, in general, they are not written by soldiers,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said\nthe colonel; \u00e2\u0080\u0098but Napier\u00e2\u0080\u0099s battles are very clear. I could fight every\none of them on this table. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a great book, that history of Napier;\nit has faults, but they are rather omissions than mistakes. Now that\naffair of Almeidas of which I was just speaking, and which nearly cost\nme my leg, it is very odd, but he has omitted mentioning it altogether.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098But you saved your leg, colonel,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said the duke.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Yes, I had the honour of marching into Paris, and that is an event\nnot very easy to be forgotten, let me tell your Grace. I saved my leg\nbecause I knew my constitution. For the very same reason by which I hope\nSir Russell Malpas will save his leg. Because he will be attended by\na person who knows his constitution. He never did a wiser thing than\nsending for Roby. For my part, if I were in garrison at Gibraltar\nto-morrow, and laid up, I would do the same; I would send for Roby. In\nall these things, depend upon it, knowing the constitution is half the\nbattle.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nAll this time, while Colonel Brace was indulging in his garrulous\ncomments, the Duke of Bellamont was drawing his moral. He had a great\nopinion of Mr. Roby, who was the medical attendant of the castle, and an\nable man. Mr. Roby was perfectly acquainted with the constitution of\nhis son; Mr. Roby must go to the Holy Sepulchre. Cost what it might, Mr.\nRoby must be sent to Jerusalem. The duke was calculating all this time\nthe income that Mr. Roby made. He would not put it down at more than\nfive hundred pounds per annum, and a third of that was certainly\nafforded by the castle. The duke determined to offer Roby a thousand and\nhis expenses to attend Lord Montacute. He would not be more than a\nyear absent, and his practice could hardly seriously suffer while away,\nbacked as he would be, when he returned, by the castle. And if it did,\nthe duke must guarantee Roby against loss; it was a necessity, absolute\nand of the first class, that Tancred should be attended by a medical man\nwho knew his constitution. The duke agreed with Colonel Brace that it\nwas half the battle.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX.\n\n     _Tancred, the New Crusader_\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098MISERABLE mother that I am!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 exclaimed the duchess, and she clasped her\nhands in anguish.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098My dearest Katherine!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said the duke, \u00e2\u0080\u0098calm yourself.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098You ought to have prevented this, George; you ought never to have let\nthings come to this pass.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098But, my dearest Katherine, the blow was as unlooked-for by me as by\nyourself. I had not, how could I have, a remote suspicion of what was\npassing through his mind?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098What, then, is the use of your boasted confidence with your child,\nwhich you tell me you have always cultivated? Had I been his father, I\nwould have discovered his secret thoughts.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Very possibly, my dear Katherine; but you are at least his mother,\ntenderly loving him, and tenderly loved by him. The intercourse between\nyou has ever been of an extreme intimacy, and especially on the subjects\nconnected with this fancy of his, and yet, you see, even you are\ncompletely taken by surprise.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 \u00e2\u0080\u0098I once had a suspicion he was inclined\nto the Puseyite heresy, and I spoke to Mr. Bernard on the subject, and\nafterwards to him, but I was convinced that I was in error. I am sure,\u00e2\u0080\u0099\nadded the duchess, in a mournful tone, \u00e2\u0080\u0098I have lost no opportunity of\ninstilling into him the principles of religious truth. It was only\nlast year, on his birthday, that I sent him a complete set of the\npublications of the Parker Society, my own copy of Jewel, full of\nnotes, and my grandfather, the primate\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, manuscript commentary on\nChillingworth; a copy made purposely by myself.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I well know,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said the duke, \u00e2\u0080\u0098that you have done everything for his\nspiritual welfare which ability and affection combined could suggest.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098And it ends in this!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 exclaimed the duchess. \u00e2\u0080\u0098The Holy Land! Why, if he\neven reach it, the climate is certain death. The curse of the Almighty,\nfor more than eighteen centuries, has been on that land. Every year\nit has become more sterile, more savage, more unwholesome, and more\nunearthly. It is the abomination of desolation. And now my son is to go\nthere! Oh! he is lost to us for ever!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098But, my dear Katherine, let us consult a little.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 \u00e2\u0080\u0098Consult! Why should\nI consult? You have settled everything, you have agreed to everything.\nYou do not come here to consult me; I understand all that; you come here\nto break a foregone conclusion to a weak and miserable woman.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Do not say such things, Katherine!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 \u00e2\u0080\u0098What should I say? What can I\nsay?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 \u00e2\u0080\u0098Anything but that. I hope that nothing will be ever done in this\nfamily without your full sanction.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 I Rest assured, then, that I will\nnever sanction the departure of Tancred on this crusade.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Then he will never go, at least, with my consent,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said the duke; \u00e2\u0080\u0098but\nKatherine, assist me, my dear wife. All shall be, shall ever be, as\nyou wish; but I shrink from being placed, from our being placed, in\ncollision with our child. The mere exercise of parental authority is a\nlast resource; I would appeal first, rather to his reason, to his heart;\nyour arguments, his affection for us, may yet influence him.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 \u00e2\u0080\u0098You tell\nme you have argued with him,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said the duchess in a melancholy tone.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Yes, but you know so much more on these subjects than I do, indeed,\nupon all subjects; you are so clever, that I do not despair, my dear\nKatherine, of your producing an impression on him.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I would tell him at once,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said the duchess, firmly, \u00e2\u0080\u0098that the\nproposition cannot be listened to.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nThe duke looked very distressed. After a momentary pause, he said, \u00e2\u0080\u0098If,\nindeed, you think that the best; but let us consult before we take that\nstep, because it would seem to terminate all discussion, and discussion\nmay yet do good. Besides, I cannot conceal from myself that Tancred in\nthis affair is acting under the influence of very powerful motives; his\nfeelings are highly strung; you have no idea, you can have no idea from\nwhat we have seen of him hitherto, how excited he is. I had no idea of\nhis being capable of such excitement. I always thought him so very calm,\nand of such a quiet turn. And so, in short, my dear Katherine, were we\nto be abrupt at this moment, peremptory, you understand, I--I should not\nbe surprised, were Tancred to go without our permission.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Impossible!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 exclaimed the duchess, starting in her chair, but with\nas much consternation as confidence in her countenance. \u00e2\u0080\u0098Throughout his\nlife he has never disobeyed us.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098And that is an additional reason,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said the duke, quietly, but in his\nsweetest tone, \u00e2\u0080\u0098why we should not treat as a light ebullition this\nfirst instance of his preferring his own will to that of his father and\nmother.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098He has been so much away from us these last three years,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said the\nduchess in a tone of great depression, \u00e2\u0080\u0098and they are such important\nyears in the formation of character! But Mr. Bernard, he ought to have\nbeen aware of all this; he ought to have known what was passing through\nhis pupil\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mind; he ought to have warned us. Let us speak to him;\nlet us speak to him at once. Ring, my dear George, and request the\nattendance of Mr. Bernard.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nThat gentleman, who was in the library, kept them waiting but a few\nminutes. As he entered the room, he perceived, by the countenances\nof his noble patrons, that something remarkable, and probably not\nagreeable, had occurred. The duke opened the case to Mr. Bernard with\ncalmness; he gave an outline of the great catastrophe; the duchess\nfilled up the parts, and invested the whole with a rich and even\nterrible colouring.\n\nNothing could exceed the astonishment of the late private tutor of\nLord Montacute. He was fairly overcome; the communication itself was\nstartling, the accessories overwhelmed him. The unspoken reproaches\nthat beamed from the duke\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mild eye; the withering glance of maternal\ndesolation that met him from the duchess; the rapidity of her anxious\nand agitated questions; all were too much for the simple, though\ncorrect, mind of one unused to those passionate developments which are\ncommonly called scenes. All that Mr. Bernard for some time could do\nwas to sit with his eyes staring and mouth open, and repeat, with a\nbewildered air, \u00e2\u0080\u0098The Holy Land, the Holy Sepulchre!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 No, most certainly\nnot; most assuredly; never in any way, by any word or deed, had Lord\nMontacute ever given him reason to suppose or imagine that his lordship\nintended to make a pilgrimage to the Holy Sepulchre, or that he was\ninfluenced by any of those views and opinions which he had so strangely\nand so uncompromisingly expressed to his father.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098But, Mr. Bernard, you have been his companion, his instructor, for many\nyears,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 continued the duchess, \u00e2\u0080\u0098for the last three years especially,\nyears so important in the formation of character. You have seen much\nmore of Montacute than we have. Surely you must have had some idea of\nwhat was passing in his mind; you could not help knowing it; you ought\nto have known it; you ought to have warned, to have prepared us.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Madam,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 at length said Mr. Bernard, more collected, and feeling the\nnecessity and excitement of self-vindication, \u00e2\u0080\u0098Madam, your noble son,\nunder my poor tuition, has taken the highest honours of his university;\nhis moral behaviour during that period has been immaculate; and as for\nhis religious sentiments, even this strange scheme proves that they are,\nat any rate, of no light and equivocal character.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098To lose such a son!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 exclaimed the duchess, in a tone of anguish, and\nwith streaming eyes.\n\nThe duke took her hand, and would have soothed her; and then, turning to\nMr. Bernard, he said, in a lowered tone, \u00e2\u0080\u0098We are very sensible how much\nwe owe you; the duchess equally with myself. All we regret is, that some\nof us had not obtained a more intimate acquaintance with the character\nof my son than it appears we have acquired.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098My lord duke,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Mr. Bernard, \u00e2\u0080\u0098had yourself or her Grace ever spoken\nto me on this subject, I would have taken the liberty of expressing what\nI say now. I have ever found Lord Montacute inscrutable. He has formed\nhimself in solitude, and has ever repelled any advance to intimacy,\neither from those who were his inferiors or his equals in station. He\nhas never had a companion. As for myself, during the ten years that I\nhave had the honour of being connected with him, I cannot recall a\nword or a deed on his part which towards me has not been courteous and\nconsiderate; but as a child he was shy and silent, and as a man, for I\nhave looked upon him as a man in mind for these four or even five years,\nhe has employed me as his machine to obtain knowledge. It is not very\nflattering to oneself to make these confessions, but at Oxford he had\nthe opportunity of communicating with some of the most eminent men\nof our time, and I have always learnt from them the same result. Lord\nMontacute never disburthened. His passion for study has been ardent; his\npower of application is very great; his attention unwearied as long\nas there is anything to acquire; but he never seeks your opinions, and\nnever offers his own. The interview of yesterday with your Grace is the\nonly exception with which I am acquainted, and at length throws some\nlight on the mysteries of his mind.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nThe duke looked sad; his wife seemed plunged in profound thought; there\nwas a silence of many moments. At length the duchess looked up, and\nsaid, in a calmer tone, and with an air of great seriousness, \u00e2\u0080\u0098It seems\nthat we have mistaken the character of our son. Thank you very much for\ncoming to us so quickly in our trouble, Mr. Bernard. It was very kind,\nas you always are.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Mr. Bernard took the hint, rose, bowed, and retired.\n\nThe moment that he had quitted the room, the eyes of the Duke and\nDuchess of Bellamont met. Who was to speak first? The duke had nothing\nto say, and therefore he had the advantage: the duchess wished her\nhusband to break the silence, but, having something to say herself, she\ncould not refrain from interrupting it. So she said, with a tearful eye,\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Well, George, what do you think we ought to do?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 The duke had a great\nmind to propose his plan of sending Tancred to Jerusalem, with Colonel\nBrace, Mr. Bernard, and Mr. Roby, to take care of him, but he hardly\nthought the occasion was ripe enough for that; and so he suggested that\nthe duchess should speak to Tancred herself.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098No,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said her Grace, shaking her head, \u00e2\u0080\u0098I think it better for me to\nbe silent; at least at present. It is necessary, however, that the most\nenergetic means should be adopted to save him, nor is there a moment to\nbe lost. We must shrink from nothing for such an object. I have a plan.\nWe will put the whole matter in the hands of our friend, the bishop.\nWe will get him to speak to Tancred. I entertain not a doubt that the\nbishop will put his mind all right; clear all his doubts; remove all his\nscruples. The bishop is the only person, because, you see, it is a case\npolitical as well as theological, and the bishop is a great statesman as\nwell as the first theologian of the age. Depend upon it, my dear George,\nthat this is the wisest course, and, with the blessing of Providence,\nwill effect our purpose. It is, perhaps, asking a good deal of the\nbishop, considering his important and multifarious duties, to undertake\nthis office, but we must not be delicate when everything is at stake;\nand, considering he christened and confirmed Tancred, and our long\nfriendship, it is quite out of the question that he can refuse. However,\nthere is no time to be lost. We must get to town as soon as possible;\ntomorrow, if we can. I shall advance affairs by writing to the bishop\non the subject, and giving him an outline of the case, so that he may be\nprepared to see Tancred at once on our arrival. What think you, George,\nof my plan?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I think it quite admirable,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 replied his Grace, only too happy that\nthere was at least the prospect of a lull of a few days in this great\nembarrassment.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X.\n\n     _A Visionary_\n\nABOUT the time of the marriage of the Duchess of Bellamont, her noble\nfamily, and a few of their friends, some of whom also believed in the\nmillennium, were persuaded that the conversion of the Roman Catholic\npopulation of Ireland to the true faith, which was their own, was at\nhand. They had subscribed very liberally for the purpose, and formed an\namazing number of sub-committees. As long as their funds lasted, their\nmissionaries found proselytes. It was the last desperate effort of a\nChurch that had from the first betrayed its trust. Twenty years ago,\nstatistics not being so much in vogue, and the people of England being\nin the full efflorescence of that public ignorance which permitted them\nto believe themselves the most enlightened nation in the world, the\nIrish \u00e2\u0080\u0098difficulty\u00e2\u0080\u0099 was not quite so well understood as at the present\nday. It was then an established doctrine, and all that was necessary\nfor Ireland was more Protestantism, and it was supposed to be not more\ndifficult to supply the Irish with Protestantism than it had proved, in\nthe instance of a recent famine, 1822, to furnish them with potatoes.\nWhat was principally wanted in both cases were subscriptions.\n\nWhen the English public, therefore, were assured by their\nco-religionists on the other side of St. George\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Channel, that at last\nthe good work was doing; that the flame spread, even rapidly; that\nnot only parishes but provinces were all agog, and that both town and\ncountry were quite in a heat of proselytism, they began to believe that\nat last the scarlet lady was about to be dethroned; they loosened\ntheir purse-strings; fathers of families contributed their zealous five\npounds, followed by every other member of the household, to the babe\nin arms, who subscribed its fanatical five shillings. The affair\nlooked well. The journals teemed with lists of proselytes and cases of\nconversion; and even orderly, orthodox people, who were firm in their\nown faith, but wished others to be permitted to pursue their errors in\npeace, began to congratulate each other on the prospect of our at last\nbecoming a united Protestant people.\n\nIn the blaze and thick of the affair, Irish Protestants jubilant, Irish\nPapists denouncing the whole movement as fraud and trumpery, John Bull\nperplexed, but excited, and still subscribing, a young bishop rose in\nhis place in the House of Lords, and, with a vehemence there unusual,\ndeclared that he saw \u00e2\u0080\u0098the finger of God in this second Reformation,\u00e2\u0080\u0099\nand, pursuing the prophetic vein and manner, denounced \u00e2\u0080\u0098woe to those who\nshould presume to lift up their hands and voices in vain and impotent\nattempts to stem the flood of light that was bursting over Ireland.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nIn him, who thus plainly discerned \u00e2\u0080\u0098the finger of God\u00e2\u0080\u0099 in transactions\nin which her family and feelings were so deeply interested, the young\nand enthusiastic Duchess of Bellamont instantly recognised the \u00e2\u0080\u0098man of\nGod;\u00e2\u0080\u0099 and from that moment the right reverend prelate became, in all\nspiritual affairs, her infallible instructor, although the impending\nsecond Reformation did chance to take the untoward form of the\nemancipation of the Roman Catholics, followed in due season by the\ndestruction of Protestant bishoprics, the sequestration of Protestant\ntithes, and the endowment of Maynooth.\n\nIn speculating on the fate of public institutions and the course of\npublic affairs, it is important that we should not permit our attention\nto be engrossed by the principles on which they are founded and the\ncircumstances which they present, but that we should also remember\nhow much depends upon the character of the individuals who are in the\nposition to superintend or to direct them.\n\nThe Church of England, mainly from its deficiency of oriental knowledge,\nand from a misconception of the priestly character which has been the\nconsequence of that want, has fallen of late years into great straits;\nnor has there ever been a season when it has more needed for its guides\nmen possessing the higher qualities both of intellect and disposition.\nAbout five-and-twenty years ago, it began to be discerned that the time\nhad gone by, at least in England, for bishoprics to serve as appanages\nfor the younger sons of great families. The Arch-Mediocrity who\nthen governed this country, and the mean tenor of whose prolonged\nadministration we have delineated in another work, was impressed with\nthe necessity of reconstructing the episcopal bench on principles of\npersonal distinction and ability. But his notion of clerical capacity\ndid not soar higher than a private tutor who had suckled a young noble\ninto university honours; and his test of priestly celebrity was the\ndecent editorship of a Greek play. He sought for the successors of the\napostles, for the stewards of the mysteries of Sinai and of Calvary,\namong third-rate hunters after syllables.\n\nThese men, notwithstanding their elevation, with one exception, subsided\ninto their native insignificance; and during our agitated age, when the\nprinciples of all institutions, sacred and secular, have been called\nin question; when, alike in the senate and the market-place, both the\ndoctrine and the discipline of the Church have been impugned, its power\nassailed, its authority denied, the amount of its revenues investigated,\ntheir disposition criticised, and both attacked; not a voice has been\nraised by these mitred nullities, either to warn or to vindicate; not a\nphrase has escaped their lips or their pens, that ever influenced public\nopinion, touched the heart of nations, or guided the conscience of a\nperplexed people. If they were ever heard of it was that they had been\npelted in a riot.\n\nThe exception which we have mentioned to their sorry careers was that\nof the too adventurous prophet of the second Reformation; the _ductor\ndubitantium_ appealed to by the Duchess of Bellamont, to convince her\nson that the principles of religious truth, as well as of political\njustice, required no further investigation; at least by young\nmarquesses.\n\nThe ready audacity with which this right reverend prelate had stood\nsponsor for the second Reformation is a key to his character. He\ncombined a great talent for action with very limited powers of thought.\n\nBustling, energetic, versatile, gifted with an indomitable perseverance,\nand stimulated by an ambition that knew no repose, with a capacity for\nmastering details and an inordinate passion for affairs, he could\npermit nothing to be done without his interference, and consequently\nwas perpetually involved in transactions which were either failures or\nblunders. He was one of those leaders who are not guides. Having little\nreal knowledge, and not endowed with those high qualities of intellect\nwhich permit their possessor to generalise the details afforded by study\nand experience, and so deduce rules of conduct, his lordship, when he\nreceived those frequent appeals which were the necessary consequence\nof his officious life, became obscure, confused, contradictory,\ninconsistent, illogical. The oracle was always dark.\n\nPlaced in a high post in an age of political analysis, the bustling\nintermeddler was unable to supply society with a single solution.\nEnunciating secondhand, with characteristic precipitation, some big\nprinciple in vogue, as if he were a discoverer, he invariably shrank\nfrom its subsequent application the moment that he found it might be\nunpopular and inconvenient. All his quandaries terminated in the same\ncatastrophe; a compromise. Abstract principles with him ever ended\nin concrete expediency. The aggregate of circumstances outweighed the\nisolated cause. The primordial tenet, which had been advocated with\nuncompromising arrogance, gently subsided into some second-rate measure\nrecommended with all the artifice of an impenetrable ambiguity.\n\nBeginning with the second Reformation, which was a little rash but\ndashing, the bishop, always ready, had in the course of his episcopal\ncareer placed himself at the head of every movement in the Church which\nothers had originated, and had as regularly withdrawn at the right\nmoment, when the heat was over, or had become, on the contrary,\nexcessive. Furiously evangelical, soberly high and dry, and fervently\nPuseyite, each phasis of his faith concludes with what the Spaniards\nterm a \u00e2\u0080\u0098transaction.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 The saints are to have their new churches, but\nthey are also to have their rubrics and their canons; the universities\nmay supply successors to the apostles, but they are also presented\nwith a church commission; even the Puseyites may have candles on their\naltars, but they must not be lighted.\n\nIt will be seen, therefore, that his lordship was one of those\ncharacters not ill-adapted to an eminent station in an age like the\npresent, and in a country like our own; an age of movement, but of\nconfused ideas; a country of progress, but too rich to risk much change.\nUnder these circumstances, the spirit of a period and a people seeks a\nsafety-valve in bustle. They do something, lest it be said that they\ndo nothing. At such a time, ministers recommend their measures as\nexperiments, and parliaments are ever ready to rescind their votes.\nFind a man who, totally destitute of genius, possesses nevertheless\nconsiderable talents; who has official aptitude, a volubility of routine\nrhetoric, great perseverance, a love of affairs; who, embarrassed\nneither by the principles of the philosopher nor by the prejudices of\nthe bigot, can assume, with a cautious facility, the prevalent tone, and\ndisembarrass himself of it, with a dexterous ambiguity, the moment it\nceases to be predominant; recommending himself to the innovator by his\napprobation of change \u00e2\u0080\u0098in the abstract,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 and to the conservative by his\nprudential and practical respect for that which is established; such\na man, though he be one of an essentially small mind, though his\nintellectual qualities be less than moderate, with feeble powers of\nthought, no imagination, contracted sympathies, and a most loose public\nmorality; such a man is the individual whom kings and parliaments\nwould select to govern the State or rule the Church. Change, \u00e2\u0080\u0098in the\nabstract,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 is what is wanted by a people who are at the same time\ninquiring and wealthy. Instead of statesmen they desire shufflers; and\ncompromise in conduct and ambiguity in speech are, though nobody will\nconfess it, the public qualities now most in vogue.\n\nNot exactly, however, those calculated to meet the case of Tancred.\nThe interview was long, for Tan-cred listened with apparent respect\nand deference to the individual under whose auspices he had entered the\nChurch of Christ; but the replies to his inquiries, though more adroit\nthan the duke\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, were in reality not more satisfactory, and could not,\nin any way, meet the inexorable logic of Lord Montacute. The bishop\nwas as little able as the duke to indicate the principle on which the\npresent order of things in England was founded; neither faith nor\nits consequence, duty, was at all illustrated or invigorated by his\nhandling. He utterly failed in reconciling a belief in ecclesiastical\ntruth with the support of religious dissent. When he tried to define\nin whom the power of government should repose, he was lost in a maze of\nphrases, and afforded his pupil not a single fact.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098It cannot be denied,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 at length said Tancred, with great calmness,\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098that society was once regulated by God, and that now it is regulated by\nman. For my part, I prefer divine to self-government, and I wish to know\nhow it is to be attained.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098The Church represents God upon earth,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said the bishop.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098But the Church no longer governs man,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 replied Tancred.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098There is a great spirit rising in the Church,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 observed the bishop,\nwith thoughtful solemnity; \u00e2\u0080\u0098a great and excellent spirit. The Church of\n1845 is not the Church of 1745. We must remember that; we know not what\nmay happen. We shall soon see a bishop at Manchester.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098But I want to see an angel at Manchester.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098An angel!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Why not? Why should there not be heavenly messengers, when heavenly\nmessages are most wanted?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098We have received a heavenly message by one greater than the angels,\u00e2\u0080\u0099\nsaid the bishop. \u00e2\u0080\u0098Their visits to man ceased with the mightier advent.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Then why did angels appear to Mary and her companions at the holy\ntomb?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 inquired Tancred.\n\nThe interview from which so much was anticipated was not satisfactory.\nThe eminent prelate did not realise Tancred\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ideal of a bishop, while\nhis lordship did not hesitate to declare that Lord Montacute was a\nvisionary.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI.\n\n     _Advice from a Man of the World_\n\nWHEN the duchess found that the interview with the bishop had been\nfruitless of the anticipated results, she was staggered, disheartened;\nbut she was a woman of too high a spirit to succumb under a first\ndefeat. She was of opinion that his lordship had misunderstood the case,\nor had mismanaged it; her confidence in him, too, was not so illimitable\nsince he had permitted the Puseyites to have candles on their altars,\nalthough he had forbidden their being lighted, as when he had declared,\ntwenty years before, that the finger of God was about to protestantise\nIreland. His lordship had said and had done many things since that\ntime which had occasioned the duchess many misgivings, although she had\nchosen that they should not occur to her recollection until he failed in\nconvincing her son that religious truth was to be found in the parish\nof St. James, and political justice in the happy haunts of Montacute\nForest.\n\nThe Bishop had voted for the Church Temporalities\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Bill in 1833, which\nat one swoop had suppressed ten Irish episcopates. This was a queer\nsuffrage for the apostle of the second Reformation. True it is that\nWhiggism was then in the ascendant, and two years afterwards, when\nWhiggism had received a heavy blow and great discouragement; when we had\nbeen blessed in the interval with a decided though feeble Conservative\nadministration, and were blessed at the moment with a strong though\nundecided Conservative opposition; his lordship, with characteristic\nactivity, had galloped across country into the right line again,\ndenounced the Appropriation Clause in a spirit worthy of his earlier\ndays, and, quite forgetting the ten Irish bishoprics, that only\nfour-and-twenty months before he had doomed to destruction, was all for\nproselytising Ireland again by the efficacious means of Irish Protestant\nbishops.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098The bishop says that Tancred is a visionary,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said the duchess to her\nhusband, with an air of great displeasure. \u00e2\u0080\u0098Why, it is because he is\na visionary that we sent him to the bishop. I want to have his false\nimaginings removed by one who has the competent powers of learning and\nargument, and the authority of a high and holy office. A visionary,\nindeed! Why, so are the Puseyites; they are visionaries, and his\nlordship has been obliged to deal with them; though, to be sure, if he\nspoke to Tancred in a similar fashion, I am not surprised that my son\nhas returned unchanged! This is the most vexatious business that ever\noccurred to us. Something must be done; but what to fix on? What do\nyou think, George? Since speaking to the bishop, of which you so much\napproved, has failed, what do you recommend?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nWhile the duchess was speaking, she was seated in her boudoir, looking\ninto the Green Park; the duke\u00e2\u0080\u0099s horses were in the courtyard, and he was\nabout to ride down to the House of Lords; he had just looked in, as was\nhis custom, to say farewell till they met again.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I am sorry that the interview with the bishop has failed,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said the\nduke, in a hesitating tone, and playing with his riding-stick; and then\nwalking up to the window and looking into the Park, he said, apparently\nafter reflection, \u00e2\u0080\u0098I always think the best person to deal with a\nvisionary is a man of the world.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098But what can men of the world know of such questions?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said the\nduchess, mournfully.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Very little,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said her husband, \u00e2\u0080\u0098and therefore they are never betrayed\ninto arguments, which I fancy always make people more obstinate, even if\nthey are confuted. Men of the world have a knack of settling everything\nwithout discussion; they do it by tact. It is astonishing how many\ndifficulties I have seen removed--by Eskdale, for example--which it\nseemed that no power on earth could change, and about which we had been\narguing for months. There was the Cheadle churches case, for example; it\nbroke up some of the oldest friendships in the county; even Hungerford\nand Ilderton did not speak. I never had a more anxious time of it; and,\nas far as I was personally concerned, I would have made any sacrifice\nto keep a good understanding in the county. At last I got the business\nreferred to Eskdale, and the affair was ultimately arranged to\neverybody\u00e2\u0080\u0099s satisfaction. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know how he managed: it was quite\nimpossible that he could have offered any new arguments, but he did it\nby tact. Tact does not remove difficulties, but difficulties melt away\nunder tact.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Heigho!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 sighed the duchess. \u00e2\u0080\u0098I cannot understand how tact can tell\nus what is religious truth, or prevent my son from going to the Holy\nSepulchre.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Try,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said the duke.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Shall you see our cousin to-day, George?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098He is sure to be at the House,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 replied the duke, eagerly. \u00e2\u0080\u0098I tell you\nwhat I propose, Kate: Tancred is gone to the House of Commons to hear\nthe debate on Maynooth; I will try and get our cousin to come home and\ndine with us, and then we can talk over the whole affair at once. What\nsay you?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Very well.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098We have failed with a bishop; we will now try a man of the world; and\nif we are to have a man of the world, we had better have a firstrate\none, and everybody agrees that our cousin----\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Yes, yes, George,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said the duchess, \u00e2\u0080\u0098ask him to come; tell him it is\nvery urgent, that we must consult him immediately; and then, if he be\nengaged, I dare say he will manage to come all the same.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nAccordingly, about half-past eight o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock, the two peers arrived at\nBellamont House together. They were unexpectedly late; they had been\ndetained at the House. The duke was excited; even Lord Esk-dale looked\nas if something had happened. Something had happened; there had been a\ndivision in the House of Lords. Rare and startling event! It seemed\nas if the peers were about to resume their functions. Divisions in\nthe House of Lords are now-a-days so thinly scattered, that, when one\noccurs, the peers cackle as if they had laid an egg. They are quite\nproud of the proof of their still procreative powers. The division\nto-night had not been on a subject of any public interest or importance;\nbut still it was a division, and, what was more, the Government had been\nleft in a minority. True, the catastrophe was occasioned by a mistake.\nThe dictator had been asleep during the debate, woke suddenly from a\ndyspeptic dream, would make a speech, and spoke on the wrong side.\nA lively colleague, not yet sufficiently broken in to the frigid\ndiscipline of the High Court of Registry, had pulled the great man once\nby his coat-tails, a House of Commons practice, permitted to the Cabinet\nwhen their chief is blundering, very necessary sometimes for a lively\nleader, but of which Sir Robert highly disapproves, as the arrangement\nof his coat-tails, next to beating the red box, forms the most important\npart of his rhetorical accessories. The dictator, when he at length\ncomprehended that he had made a mistake, persisted in adhering to it;\nthe division was called, some of the officials escaped, the rest were\nobliged to vote with their ruthless master; but his other friends, glad\nof an opportunity of asserting their independence and administering to\nthe dictator a slight check in a quiet inoffensive way, put him in a\nminority; and the Duke of Bellamont and Lord Eskdale had contributed to\nthis catastrophe.\n\nDinner was served in the library; the conversation during it was chiefly\nthe event of the morning. The duchess, who, though not a partisan, was\nsomething of a politician, thought it was a pity that the dictator had\never stepped out of his military sphere; her husband, who had never\nbefore seen a man\u00e2\u0080\u0099s coat-tails pulled when he was speaking, dilated much\nupon the singular circumstance of Lord Spur so disporting himself on the\npresent occasion; while Lord Eskdale, who had sat for a long time in\nthe House of Commons, and who was used to everything, assured his cousin\nthat the custom, though odd, was by no means irregular. \u00e2\u0080\u0098I remember,\u00e2\u0080\u0099\nsaid his lordship, \u00e2\u0080\u0098seeing Ripon, when he was Robinson, and Huskisson,\neach pulling one of Canning\u00e2\u0080\u0099s coat-tails at the same time.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nThroughout dinner not a word about Tancred. Lord Eskdale neither asked\nwhere he was nor how he was. At length, to the great relief of the\nduchess, dinner was finished; the servants had disappeared. The duke\npushed away the table; they drew their chairs round the hearth; Lord\nEskdale took half a glass of Madeira, then stretched his legs a little,\nthen rose, stirred the fire, and then, standing with his back to it\nand his hands in his pockets, said, in a careless tone approaching to a\ndrawl, \u00e2\u0080\u0098And so, duchess, Tancred wants to go to Jerusalem?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098George has told you, then, all our troubles?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 \u00e2\u0080\u0098Only that; he left the\nrest to you, and I came to hear it.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nWhereupon the duchess went off, and spoke for a considerable time\nwith great animation and ability, the duke hanging on every word with\nvigilant interest, Lord Eskdale never interrupting her for an instant;\nwhile she stated the case not only with the impassioned feeling of\na devoted mother, but occasionally with all the profundity of a\ntheologian. She did not conceal from him the interview between Tancred\nand the bishop; it was her last effort, and had failed; and so, \u00e2\u0080\u0098after\nall our plans,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 she ended, \u00e2\u0080\u0098as far as I can form an opinion, he is\nabsolutely more resolved than ever to go to Jerusalem.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Well,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said his lordship, \u00e2\u0080\u0098it is at least better than going to the\nJews, which most men do at his time of life.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I cannot agree even to that,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said the duchess; \u00e2\u0080\u0098for I would rather\nthat he should be ruined than die.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Men do not die as they used,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said his lordship. \u00e2\u0080\u0098Ask the annuity\noffices; they have all raised their rates.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I know nothing about annuity offices, but I know that almost everybody\ndies who goes to those countries; look at young Fernborough, he was just\nTancred\u00e2\u0080\u0099s age; the fevers alone must kill him.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098He must take some quinine in his dressing-case,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Lord Eskdale.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098You jest, Henry,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said the duchess, disappointed, \u00e2\u0080\u0098when I am in\ndespair.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098No,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Lord Eskdale, looking up to the ceiling, \u00e2\u0080\u0098I am thinking how\nyou may prevent Tancred from going to Jerusalem, without, at the same\ntime, opposing his wishes.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Ay, ay,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said the duke, \u00e2\u0080\u0098that is it.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 And he looked triumphantly to\nhis wife, as much as to say, \u00e2\u0080\u0098Now you see what it is to be a man of the\nworld.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098A man cannot go to Jerusalem as he would to Birmingham, by the next\ntrain,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 continued his lordship; \u00e2\u0080\u0098he must get something to take him; and\nif you make the sacrifice of consenting to his departure, you have a\nright to stipulate as to the manner in which he should depart. Your son\nought to travel with a suite; he ought to make the voyage in his own\nyacht. Yachts are not to be found like hack cabs, though there are\nseveral for sale now; but then they are not of the admeasurement of\nwhich you approve for such a voyage and such a sea. People talk very\nlightly of the Mediterranean, but there are such things as white\nsqualls. Anxious parents, and parents so fond of a son as you are, and a\nson whose life for so many reasons is so precious, have a right to make\nit a condition of their consent to his departure, that he should embark\nin a vessel of considerable tonnage. He will find difficulty in buying\none second-hand; if he finds one it will not please him. He will get\ninterested in yacht-building, as he is interested now about Jerusalem:\nboth boyish fancies. He will stay another year in England to build a\nyacht to take him to the Holy Land; the yacht will be finished this time\ntwelvemonths; and, instead of going to Palestine, he will go to Cowes.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098That is quite my view of the case,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said the duke.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098It never occurred to me,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said the duchess.\n\nLord Eskdale resumed his seat, and took another half-glass of Madeira.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Well, I think it is very satisfactory, Katherine,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said the duke, after\na short pause.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098And what do you recommend us to do first?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said the duchess to Lord\nEskdale.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Let Tancred go into society: the best way for him to forget Jerusalem\nis to let him see London.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098But how can I manage it?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said the duchess. \u00e2\u0080\u0098I never go anywhere;\nnobody knows him, and he does not wish to know anybody.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I will manage it, with your permission; \u00e2\u0080\u0098tis not difficult; a young\nmarquess has only to evince an inclination, and in a week\u00e2\u0080\u0099s time he will\nbe everywhere. I will tell Lady St. Julians and the great ladies to send\nhim invitations; they will fall like a snow-storm. All that remains is\nfor you to prevail upon him to accept them.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098And how shall I contrive it?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said the duchess.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Easily,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Lord Eskdale. \u00e2\u0080\u0098Make his going into society, while his\nyacht is preparing, one of the conditions of the great sacrifice you are\nmaking. He cannot refuse you: \u00e2\u0080\u0098tis but the first step. A youth feels a\nlittle repugnance to launching into the great world: \u00e2\u0080\u0098tis shyness; but\nafter the plunge, the great difficulty is to restrain rather than to\nincite. Let him but once enter the world, and be tranquil, he will soon\nfind something to engage him.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098As long as he does not take to play,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said the duke, \u00e2\u0080\u0098I do not much\ncare what he does.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098My dear George!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said the duchess, \u00e2\u0080\u0098how can you say such things! I was\nin hopes,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 she added, in a mournful tone, \u00e2\u0080\u0098that we might have settled\nhim, without his entering what you call the world, Henry. Dearest child!\nI fancy him surrounded by pitfalls.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII.\n\n     _The Dreamer Enters Society_\n\nAFTER this consultation with Lord Eskdale, the duchess became easier in\nher mind. She was of a sanguine temper, and with facility believed what\nshe wished. Affairs stood thus: it was agreed by all that Tancred should\ngo to the Holy Land, but he was to go in his own yacht; which yacht\nwas to be of a firstrate burthen, and to be commanded by an officer in\nH.M.S.; and he was to be accompanied by Colonel Brace, Mr. Bernard, and\nMr. Roby; and the servants were to be placed entirely under the control\nof some trusty foreigner accustomed to the East, and who was to be\nchosen by Lord Eskdale. In the meantime, Tancred had acceded to the wish\nof his parents, that until his departure he should mix much in society.\nThe duchess calculated that, under any circumstances, three months\nmust elapse before all the arrangements were concluded; and she felt\npersuaded that, during that period, Tancred must become enamoured of his\ncousin Katherine, and that the only use of the yacht would be to take\nthem all to Ireland. The duke was resolved only on two points: that his\nson should do exactly as his son liked, and that he himself would never\ntake the advice, on any subject, of any other person than Lord Eskdale.\n\nIn the meantime Tancred was launched, almost unconsciously, into the\ngreat world. The name of the Marquess of Montacute was foremost in those\ndelicate lists by which an eager and admiring public is apprised who,\namong their aristocracy, eat, drink, dance, and sometimes pray. From the\nsaloons of Bel-grave and Grosvenor Square to the sacred recesses of\nthe Chapel Royal, the movements of Lord Montacute were tracked and\nregistered, and were devoured every morning, oftener with a keener\nrelish than the matin meal of which they formed a regular portion.\nEngland is the only country which enjoys the unspeakable advantage of\nbeing thus regularly, promptly, and accurately furnished with catalogues\nof those favoured beings who are deemed qualified to enter the houses of\nthe great. What condescension in those who impart the information! What\nindubitable evidence of true nobility! What superiority to all petty\nvanity! And in those who receive it, what freedom from all little\nfeelings! No arrogance on one side; on the other, no envy. It is only\ncountries blessed with a free press that can be thus favoured. Even a\nfree press is not alone sufficient. Besides a free press, you must have\na servile public.\n\nAfter all, let us be just. The uninitiated world is apt to believe that\nthere is sometimes, in the outskirts of fashion, an eagerness, scarcely\nconsistent with self-respect, to enter the mansions of the great. Not at\nall: few people really want to go to their grand parties. It is not the\ncharms of conversation, the flash of wit or the blaze of beauty, the\ninfluential presence of the powerful and celebrated, all the splendour\nand refinement, which, combined, offer in a polished saloon so much\nto charm the taste and satisfy the intellect, that the mass of social\npartisans care anything about. What they want is, not so much to be\nin her ladyship\u00e2\u0080\u0099s house as in her ladyship\u00e2\u0080\u0099s list. After the party at\nConingsby Castle, our friend, Mrs. Guy Flouncey, at length succeeded\nin being asked to one of Lady St. Julians\u00e2\u0080\u0099 assemblies. It was a great\ntriumph, and Mrs. Guy Flouncey determined to make the most of it. She\nwas worthy of the occasion. But alas! next morning, though admitted to\nthe rout, Mrs. Guy Flouncey was left out of the list! It was a severe\nblow! But Mrs. Guy Flouncey is in every list now, and even strikes\nout names herself. But there never was a woman who advanced with such\ndexterity.\n\nLord Montacute was much shocked, when, one morning, taking up a journal,\nhe first saw his name in print. He was alone, and he blushed; felt,\nindeed, extremely distressed, when he found that the English people were\nformally made acquainted with the fact that he had dined on the previous\nSaturday with the Earl and Countess of St. Julians; \u00e2\u0080\u0098a grand banquet,\u00e2\u0080\u0099\nof which he was quite unconscious until he read it; and that he was\nafterwards \u00e2\u0080\u0098observed\u00e2\u0080\u0099 at the Opera.\n\nHe found that he had become a public character, and he was not by any\nmeans conscious of meriting celebrity. To be pointed at as he walked\nthe streets, were he a hero, or had done, said, or written anything that\nanybody remembered, though at first painful and embarrassing, for he was\nshy, he could conceive ultimately becoming endurable, and not without a\ndegree of excitement, for he was ambitious; but to be looked at because\nhe was a young lord, and that this should be the only reason why the\npublic should be informed where he dined, or where he amused himself,\nseemed to him not only vexatious but degrading. When he arrived,\nhowever, at a bulletin of his devotions, he posted off immediately to\nthe Surrey Canal to look at a yacht there, and resolved not to lose\nunnecessarily one moment in setting off for Jerusalem.\n\nHe had from the first busied himself about the preparations for his\nvoyage with all the ardour of youth; that is, with all the energy of\ninexperience, and all the vigour of simplicity. As everything seemed\nto depend upon his obtaining a suitable vessel, he trusted to no third\nperson; had visited Cowes several times; advertised in every paper;\nand had already met with more than one yacht which at least deserved\nconsideration. The duchess was quite frightened at his progress. \u00e2\u0080\u0098I\nam afraid he has found one,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 she said to Lord Eskdale; \u00e2\u0080\u0098he will be off\ndirectly.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nLord Eskdale shook his head. \u00e2\u0080\u0098There are always things of this sort in\nthe market. He will inquire before he purchases, and he will find that\nhe has got hold of a slow coach.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098A slow coach!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said the duchess, looking inquiringly. \u00e2\u0080\u0098What is that?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098A tub that sails like a collier, and which, instead of taking him to\nJerusalem, will hardly take him to Newcastle.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nLord Eskdale was right. Notwithstanding all his ardour, all his\ninquiries, visits to Cowes and the Surrey Canal, advertisements and\nanswers to advertisements, time flew on, and Tancred was still without a\nyacht.\n\nIn this unsettled state, Tancred found himself one evening at Deloraine\nHouse. It was not a ball, it was only a dance, brilliant and select;\nbut, all the same, it seemed to Tancred that the rooms could not be\nmuch more crowded. The name of the Marquess of Montacute, as it was sent\nalong by the servants, attracted attention. Tancred had scarcely entered\nthe world, his appearance had made a sensation, everybody talked of him,\nmany had not yet seen him.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Oh! that is Lord Montacute,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said a great lady, looking through her\nglass; \u00e2\u0080\u0098very distinguished!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I tell you what,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 whispered Mr. Ormsby to Lord Valentine, \u00e2\u0080\u0098you young\nmen had better look sharp; Lord Montacute will cut you all out!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Oh! he is going to Jerusalem,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Lord Valentine.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Jerusalem!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Mr. Ormsby, shrugging his shoulders. \u00e2\u0080\u0098What can he find\nto do at Jerusalem?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098What, indeed,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Lord Milford. \u00e2\u0080\u0098My brother was there in \u00e2\u0080\u009839; he got\nleave after the bombardment of Acre, and he says there is absolutely no\nsport of any kind.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098There used to be partridges in the time of Jeremiah,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Mr. Ormsby;\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098at least they told us so at the Chapel Royal last Sunday, where,\nby-the-bye, I saw Lord Montacute for the first time; and a deuced\ngood-looking fellow he is,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he added, musingly.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Well, there is not a bird in the whole country now,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Lord Milford.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Montacute does not care for sport,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Lord Valentine.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098What does he care for?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 asked Lord Milford. \u00e2\u0080\u0098Because, if he wants any\nhorses, I can let him have some.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098He wants to buy a yacht,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Lord Valentine; \u00e2\u0080\u0098and that reminds me\nthat I heard to-day Exmouth wanted to get rid of \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Flower of Yarrow,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n and I think it would suit my cousin. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll tell him of it.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 And he\nfollowed Tancred.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098You and Valentine must rub up your harness, Milford,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Mr.\nOrmsby; \u00e2\u0080\u0098there is a new champion in the field. We are talking of Lord\nMontacute,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 continued Mr. Ormsby, addressing himself to Mr. Melton, who\njoined them; \u00e2\u0080\u0098I tell Milford he will cut you all out.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Well,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Mr. Melton, \u00e2\u0080\u0098for my part I have had so much success, that I\nhave no objection, by way of change, to be for once eclipsed.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Well done, Jemmy,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Lord Milford.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I see, Melton,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Mr. Ormsby, \u00e2\u0080\u0098you are reconciled to your fate like\na philosopher.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Well, Montacute,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Lord St. Patrick, a good-tempered, witty\nMilesian, with a laughing eye, \u00e2\u0080\u0098when are you going to Jericho?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Tell me,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Tancred, in reply, and rather earnestly, \u00e2\u0080\u0098who is that?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\nAnd he directed the attention of Lord St. Patrick to a young lady,\nrather tall, a brilliant complexion, classic features, a profusion of\nlight brown hair, a face of intelligence, and a figure rich and yet\ngraceful.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098That is Lady Constance Rawleigh; if you like, I will introduce you to\nher. She is my cousin, and deuced clever. Come along!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nIn the meantime, in the room leading to the sculpture gallery where they\nare dancing, the throng is even excessive. As the two great divisions,\nthose who would enter the gallery and those who are quitting it,\nencounter each other, they exchange flying phrases as they pass.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098They told me you had gone to Paris! I have just returned. Dear me,\nhow time flies! Pretty dance, is it not? Very. Do you know whether the\nMadlethorpes mean to come up this year? I hardly know; their little girl\nis very ill. Ah! so I hear; what a pity, and such a fortune! Such a pity\nwith such a fortune! How d\u00e2\u0080\u0099ye do? Mr. Coningsby here? No; he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s at the\nHouse. They say he is a very close attendant. It interests him. Well,\nLady Florentina, you never sent me the dances. Pardon, but you will find\nthem when you return. I lent them to Augusta, and she would copy them.\nIs it true that I am to congratulate you? Why? Lady Blanche? Oh! that is\na romance of Easter week. Well, I am really delighted; I think such an\nexcellent match for both; exactly suited to each other. They think so.\nWell, that is one point. How well Lady Everingham is looking! She is\nquite herself again. Quite. Tell me, have you seen M. de Talleyrand\nhere? I spoke to him but this moment. Shall you be at Lady Blair\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nto-morrow? No; I have promised to go to Mrs. Guy Flouncey\u00e2\u0080\u0099s. She has\ntaken Craven Cottage, and is to be at home every Saturday. Well, if you\nare going, I think I shall. I would; everybody will be there.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nLord Montacute had conversed some time with Lady Constance; then he had\ndanced with her; he had hovered about her during the evening. It was\nobserved, particularly by some of the most experienced mothers. Lady\nConstance was a distinguished beauty of two seasons; fresh, but adroit.\nIt was understood that she had refused offers of a high calibre; but\nthe rejected still sighed about her, and it was therefore supposed that,\nthough decided, she had the art of not rendering them desperate. One\nat least of them was of a rank equal to that of Tancred. She had the\nreputation of being very clever, and of being able, if it pleased her,\nto breathe scorpions as well as brilliants and roses. It had got about\nthat she admired intellect, and, though she claimed the highest social\nposition, that a booby would not content her, even if his ears were\ncovered with strawberry leaves.\n\nIn the cloak-room, Tancred was still at her side, and was presented to\nher mother, Lady Charmouth.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I am sorry to separate,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Tancred.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098And so am I,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Lady Constance, smiling; \u00e2\u0080\u0098but one advantage of this\nlife is, we meet our friends every day.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I am not going anywhere to-morrow, where I shall meet you,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said\nTancred, \u00e2\u0080\u0098unless you chance to dine at the Archbishop of York\u00e2\u0080\u0099s.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I am not going to dine with the Archbishop of York,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Lady\nConstance, \u00e2\u0080\u0098but I am going, where everybody else is going, to breakfast\nwith Mrs. Guy Flouncey, at Craven Cottage. Why, will not you be there?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I have not the honour of knowing her,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Tancred.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098That is not of the slightest consequence; she will be very happy to\nhave the honour of knowing you. I saw her in the dancing-room, but it\nis not worth while waiting to speak to her now. You shall receive an\ninvitation the moment you are awake.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098But to-morrow I have an engagement. I have to look at a yacht.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098But that you can look at on Monday; besides, if you wish to know\nanything about yachts, you had better speak to my brother, Fitz-Heron,\nwho has built more than any man alive.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Perhaps he has one that he wishes to part with?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Tancred.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I have no doubt of it. You can ask him tomorrow at Mrs. Guy\nFlouncey\u00e2\u0080\u0099s.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I will. Lady Charmouth\u00e2\u0080\u0099s carriage is called. May I have the honour?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\nsaid Tancred, offering his arm.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII.\n\n     _A Feminine Diplomatist_\n\nTHERE is nothing so remarkable as feminine influence. Although the\ncharacter of Tancred was not completely formed--for that result depends,\nin some degree, upon the effect of circumstances at a certain time of\nlife, as well as on the impulse of a natural bent--still the temper of\nhis being was profound and steadfast. He had arrived, in solitude and\nby the working of his own thought, at a certain resolution, which had\nassumed to his strong and fervent imagination a sacred character, and\nwhich he was determined to accomplish at all costs. He had brought\nhimself to the point that he would not conceive an obstacle that should\nbaulk him. He had acceded to the conditions which had been made by his\nparents, for he was by nature dutiful, and wished to fulfil his-purpose,\nif possible, with their sanction.\n\nYet he had entered society with repugnance, and found nothing in its\ngeneral tone with which his spirit harmonised. He was alone in the\ncrowd; silent, observing, and not charmed. There seemed to him generally\na want of simplicity and repose; too much flutter, not a little\naffectation. People met in the thronged chambers, and interchanged brief\nwords, as if they were always in a hurry. \u00e2\u0080\u0098Have you been here long?\nWhere are you going next?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 These were the questions which seemed to form\nthe staple of the small talk of a fashionable multitude. Why, too,\nwas there a smile on every countenance, which often also assumed the\ncharacter of a grin? No error so common or so grievous as to suppose\nthat a smile is a necessary ingredient of the pleasing. There are few\nfaces that can afford to smile. A smile is sometimes bewitching, in\ngeneral vapid, often a contortion. But the bewitching smile usually\nbeams from the grave face. It is then irresistible. Tancred, though he\nwas unaware of it, was gifted with this rare spell. He had inherited\nit from his mother; a woman naturally earnest and serious, and of a\nsingular simplicity, but whose heart when pleased spoke in the dimpling\nsunshine of her cheek with exquisite beauty. The smiles of the Duchess\nof Bellamont, however, were like her diamonds, brilliant, but rarely\nworn.\n\nTancred had not mounted the staircase of Deloraine House with any\nanticipation of pleasure. His thoughts were far away amid cities of the\ndesert, and by the palmy banks of ancient rivers. He often took refuge\nin these exciting and ennobling visions, to maintain himself when he\nunderwent the ceremony of entering a great house. He was so shy in\nlittle things, that to hear his name sounded from servant to servant,\nechoing from landing-place to landing-place, was almost overwhelming.\nNothing but his pride, which was just equal to his reserve, prevented\nhim from often turning back on the stairs and precipitately retreating.\nAnd yet he had not been ten minutes in Deloraine House, before he had\nabsolutely requested to be introduced to a lady. It was the first time\nhe had ever made such a request.\n\nHe returned home, softly musing. A tone lingered in his ear; he recalled\nthe countenance of one absent. In his dressing-room he lingered\nbefore he retired, with his arm on the mantel-piece, and gazing with\nabstraction on the fire.\n\nWhen his servant called him, late in the morning, he delivered to him a\ncard from Mrs. Guy Flouncey, inviting him on that day to Craven Cottage,\nat three o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock: \u00e2\u0080\u0098d\u00c3\u00a9je\u00c3\u00bbner at four o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock precisely.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Tancred took the\ncard, looked at it, and the letters seemed to cluster together and form\nthe countenance of Lady Constance. \u00e2\u0080\u0098It will be a good thing to go,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he\nsaid, \u00e2\u0080\u0098because I want to know Lord Fitz-Heron; he will be of great use\nto me about my yacht.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 So he ordered his carriage at three o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock.\n\nThe reader must not for a moment suppose that Mrs. Guy Flouncey, though\nshe was quite as well dressed, and almost as pretty, as she was when at\nConingsby Castle in 1837, was by any means the same lady who then strove\nto amuse and struggled to be noticed. By no means. In 1837, Mrs. Guy\nFlouncey was nobody; in 1845, Mrs. Guy Flouncey was somebody, and\nsomebody of very great importance. Mrs. Guy Flouncey had invaded\nsociety, and had conquered it, gradually, but completely, like the\nEnglish in India. Social invasions are not rare, but they are seldom\nfortunate, or success, if achieved, is partial, and then only sustained\nat immense cost, like the French in Algiers.\n\nThe Guy Flounceys were not people of great fortune. They had a good\nfortune; seven or eight thousand a year. But then, with an air of great\nexpenditure, even profusion, there was a basis of good management. And a\ngood fortune with good management, and without that equivocal luxury, a\ngreat country-house, is almost equal to the great fortune of a peer.\nBut they not only had no country-house, they had no children. And a good\nfortune, with good management, no country-house, and no children, is\nAladdin\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lamp.\n\nMr. Guy Flouncey was a sporting character. His wife had impressed upon\nhim that it was the only way in which he could become fashionable and\nacquainted with \u00e2\u0080\u0098the best men.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 He knew just enough of the affair not\nto be ridiculous; and, for the rest, with a great deal of rattle and\napparent heedlessness of speech and deed, he was really an extremely\nselfish and sufficiently shrewd person, who never compromised himself.\nIt is astonishing with what dexterity Guy Flouncey could extricate\nhimself from the jaws of a friend, who, captivated by his thoughtless\ncandour and ostentatiously good heart, might be induced to request Mr.\nFlouncey to lend him a few hundreds, only for a few months, or, more\ndiplomatically, might beg his friend to become his security for a few\nthousands, for a few years.\n\nMr. Guy Flouncey never refused these applications; they were exactly\nthose to which it delighted his heart to respond, because nothing\npleased him more than serving a friend. But then he always had to write\na preliminary letter of preparation to his banker, or his steward, or\nhis confidential solicitor; and, by some contrivance or other,\nwithout offending any one, rather with the appearance of conferring an\nobligation, it ended always by Mr. Guy Flouncey neither advancing the\nhundreds, nor guaranteeing the thousands. He had, indeed, managed,\nlike many others, to get the reputation of being what is called \u00e2\u0080\u0098a good\nfellow;\u00e2\u0080\u0099 though it would have puzzled his panegyrists to allege a single\nact of his that evinced a good heart. This sort of pseudo reputation,\nwhether for good or for evil, is not uncommon in the world. Man is\nmimetic; judges of character are rare; we repeat without thought the\nopinions of some third person, who has adopted them without inquiry;\nand thus it often happens that a proud, generous man obtains in time the\nreputation of being \u00e2\u0080\u0098a screw,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 because he has refused to lend money\nto some impudent spendthrift, who from that moment abuses him; and a\ncold-hearted, civil-spoken personage, profuse in costless services, with\na spice of the parasite in him, or perhaps hospitable out of vanity,\nis invested with all the thoughtless sympathies of society, and passes\ncurrent as that most popular of characters, \u00e2\u0080\u0098a good fellow.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nGuy Flouncey\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dinners began to be talked of among men: it became a\nsort of fashion, especially among sporting men, to dine with Mr. Guy\nFlouncey, and there they met Mrs. Guy Flouncey. Not an opening ever\nescaped her. If a man had a wife, and that wife was a personage, sooner\nor later, much as she might toss her head at first, she was sure to\nvisit Mrs. Guy Flouncey, and, when she knew her, she was sure to like\nher. The Guy Flounceys never lost a moment; the instant the season was\nover, they were at Cowes, then at a German bath, then at Paris, then at\nan English country-house, then in London.\n\nSeven years, to such people, was half a century of social experience.\nThey had half a dozen seasons in every year. Still, it was hard work,\nand not rapid. At a certain point they stuck, as all do. Most people,\nthen, give it up; but patience, Buffon tells us, is genius, and Mrs.\nGuy Flouncey was, in her way, a woman of genius. Their dinners were, in\na certain sense, established: these in return brought them to a certain\ndegree into the dinner world; but balls, at least balls of a high\ncalibre, were few, and as for giving a ball herself, Mrs. Guy Flouncey\ncould no more presume to think of that than of attempting to prorogue\nParliament. The house, however, got really celebrated for \u00e2\u0080\u0098the best\nmen.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Mrs. Guy Flouncey invited all the young dancing lords to dinner.\nMothers will bring their daughters where there are young lords. Mrs. Guy\nFlouncey had an opera-box in the best tier, which she took only to lend\nto her friends; and a box at the French play, which she took only to\nbribe her foes. They were both at everybody\u00e2\u0080\u0099s service, like Mr. Guy\nFlouncey\u00e2\u0080\u0099s yacht, provided the persons who required them were members\nof that great world in which Mrs. Guy Flouncey had resolved to plant\nherself.\n\nMrs. Guy Flouncey was pretty; she was a flirt on principle; thus she had\ncaught the Marquess of Beaumanoir, who, if they chanced to meet,\nalways spoke to her, which gave Mrs. Guy Flouncey fashion. But Mrs. Guy\nFlouncey was nothing more than a flirt. She never made a mistake; she\nwas born with strong social instincts. She knew that the fine ladies\namong whom, from the first, she had determined to place herself, were\nmoral martinets with respect to any one not born among themselves.\nThat which is not observed, or, if noticed, playfully alluded to in\nthe conduct of a patrician dame, is visited with scorn and contumely if\ncommitted by some \u00e2\u0080\u0098shocking woman,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 who has deprived perhaps a countess\nof the affections of a husband who has not spoken to her for years.\nBut if the countess is to lose her husband, she ought to lose him to a\nviscountess, at least. In this way the earl is not lost to \u00e2\u0080\u0098society.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nA great nobleman met Mrs. Guy Flouncey at a country-house, and was\nfairly captivated by her. Her pretty looks, her coquettish manner, her\nvivacity, her charming costume, above all, perhaps, her imperturbable\ngood temper, pierced him to the heart. The great nobleman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s wife had the\nweakness to be annoyed. Mrs. Guy Flouncey saw her opportunity. She threw\nover the earl, and became the friend of the countess, who could never\nsufficiently evince her gratitude to the woman who would not make love\nto her husband. This friendship was the incident for which Mrs. Guy\nFlouncey had been cruising for years. Men she had vanquished; they had\ngiven her a sort of _ton_ which she had prudently managed. She had not\ndestroyed herself by any fatal preference. Still, her fashion among men\nnecessarily made her unfashionable among women, who, if they did not\nabsolutely hate her, which they would have done had she had a noble\nlover, were determined not to help her up the social ladder. Now she had\na great friend, and one of the greatest of ladies. The moment she had\npondered over for years had arrived. Mrs. Guy Flouncey determined at\nonce to test her position. Mrs. Guy Flouncey resolved on giving a ball.\n\nBut some of our friends in the country will say, \u00e2\u0080\u0098Is that all? Surely\nit required no very great resolution, no very protracted pondering, to\ndetermine on giving a ball! Where is the difficulty? The lady has but to\nlight up her house, hire the fiddlers, line her staircase with American\nplants, perhaps enclose her balcony, order Mr. Gunter to provide plenty\nof the best refreshments, and at one o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock a superb supper, and, with\nthe company of your friends, you have as good a ball as can be desired\nby the young, or endured by the old.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nInnocent friends in the country! You might have all these things. Your\nhouse might be decorated like a Russian palace, blazing with the most\nbrilliant lights and breathing the richest odours; you might have\nJullien presiding over your orchestra, and a banquet worthy of the\nRomans. As for your friends, they might dance until daybreak, and agree\nthat there never was an entertainment more tasteful, more sumptuous,\nand, what would seem of the first importance, more merry. But, having\nall these things, suppose you have not a list? You have given a ball,\nyou have not a list. The reason is obvious: you are ashamed of your\nguests. You are not in \u00e2\u0080\u0098society.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nBut even a list is not sufficient for success. You must also get a\nday: the most difficult thing in the world. After inquiring among your\nfriends, and studying the columns of the _Morning Post_, you discover\nthat, five weeks hence, a day is disengaged. You send out your cards;\nyour house is dismantled; your lights are arranged; the American plants\nhave arrived; the band, perhaps two bands, are engaged. Mr. Gunter has\nhalf dressed your supper, and made all your ice, when suddenly, within\neight-and-forty hours of the festival which you have been five weeks\npreparing, the Marchioness of Deloraine sends out cards for a ball in\nhonour of some European sovereign who has just alighted on our isle, and\nmeans to stay only a week, and at whose court, twenty years ago, Lord\nDeloraine was ambassador. Instead of receiving your list, you are\nobliged to send messengers in all directions to announce that your\nball is postponed, although you are perfectly aware that not a single\nindividual would have been present whom you would have cared to welcome.\n\nThe ball is postponed; and next day the _Morning Post_ informs us it is\npostponed to that day week; and the day after you have circulated this\ninteresting intelligence, you yourself, perhaps, have the gratification\nof receiving an invitation, for the same day, to Lady St. Julians\u00e2\u0080\u0099: with\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098dancing\u00e2\u0080\u0099 neatly engraved in the corner. You yield in despair; and\nthere are some ladies who, with every qualification for an excellent\nball-guests, Gunter, American plants, pretty daughters have been\nwatching and waiting for years for an opportunity of giving it; and at\nlast, quite hopeless, at the end of the season, expend their funds in\na series of Greenwich banquets, which sometimes fortunately produce the\nresults expected from the more imposing festivity.\n\nYou see, therefore, that giving a ball is not that matter-of-course\naffair you imagined; and that for Mrs. Guy Flouncey to give a ball and\nsucceed, completely, triumphantly to succeed, was a feat worthy of that\nfine social general. Yet she did it. The means, like everything that is\ngreat, were simple. She induced her noble friend to ask her guests. Her\nnoble friend canvassed for her as if it were a county election of the\ngood old days, when the representation of a shire was the certain\navenue to a peerage, instead of being, as it is now, the high road to a\npoor-law commissionership.\n\nMany were very glad to make the acquaintance of Mrs. Guy Flouncey; many\nonly wanted an excuse to make the acquaintance of Mrs. Guy Flouncey;\nthey went to her party because they were asked by their dear friend,\nLady Kingcastle. As for the potentates, there is no disguise on these\nsubjects among them. They went to Mrs. Guy Flouncey\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ball because one\nwho was their equal, not only in rank, but in social influence, had\nrequested it as a personal favour, she herself, when the occasion\noffered, being equally ready to advance their wishes. The fact was, that\naffairs were ripe for the recognition of Mrs. Guy Flouncey as a member\nof the social body. Circumstances had been long maturing. The Guy\nFlounceys, who, in the course of their preparatory career, had hopped\nfrom Park Crescent to Portman Square, had now perched upon their\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098splendid mansion\u00e2\u0080\u0099 in Belgrave Square. Their dinners were renowned. Mrs.\nGuy Flouncey was seen at all the \u00e2\u0080\u0098best balls,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 and was always surrounded\nby the \u00e2\u0080\u0098best men.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Though a flirt and a pretty woman, she was a discreet\nparvenue, who did not entrap the affections of noble husbands. Above\nall, she was the friend of Lady Kingcastle, who called her and her\nhusband \u00e2\u0080\u0098those good Guy Flounceys.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nThe ball was given; you could not pass through Belgrave Square that\nnight. The list was published; it formed two columns of the Morning\nPost. Lady Kingcastle was honoured by the friendship of a royal duchess.\nShe put the friendship to the proof, and her royal highness was seen at\nMrs. Guy Flouncey\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ball. Imagine the reception, the canopy, the scarlet\ncloth, the \u00e2\u0080\u0098God save the King\u00e2\u0080\u0099 from the band of the first guards,\nbivouacked in the hall, Mrs. Guy Flouncey herself performing her part\nas if she had received princesses of the blood all her life; so reverent\nand yet so dignified, so very calm and yet with a sort of winning,\nsunny innocence. Her royal highness was quite charmed with her hostess,\npraised her much to Lady Kingcastle, told her that she was glad that she\nhad come, and even stayed half an hour longer than Mrs. Guy Flouncey\nhad dared to hope. As for the other guests, the peerage was gutted.\nThe Dictator himself was there, and, the moment her royal highness had\nretired, Mrs. Guy Flouncey devoted herself to the hero. All the great\nladies, all the ambassadors, all the beauties, a full chapter of the\nGarter, a chorus among the \u00e2\u0080\u0098best men\u00e2\u0080\u0099 that it was without doubt the\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098best ball\u00e2\u0080\u0099 of the year, happy Mrs. Guy Flouncey! She threw a glance at\nher swing-glass while Mr. Guy Flouncey, who \u00e2\u0080\u0098had not had time to get\nanything the whole evening,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 was eating some supper on a tray in her\ndressing-room at five o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock in the morning, and said, \u00e2\u0080\u0098We have done it\nat last, my love!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nShe was right; and from that moment Mrs. Guy Flouncey was asked to all\nthe great houses, and became a lady of the most unexceptionable _ton_.\n\nBut all this time we are forgetting her _d\u00c3\u00a9je\u00c3\u00bbner_, and that Tancred\nis winding his way through the garden lanes of Fulham to reach Craven\nCottage.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV.\n\n     _The Coningsbys_\n\nTHE day was brilliant: music, sunshine, ravishing bonnets, little\nparasols that looked like large butterflies. The new phaetons glided\nup, then carriages-and-four swept by; in general the bachelors were\nensconced in their comfortable broughams, with their glasses down and\ntheir blinds drawn, to receive the air and to exclude the dust; some\nless provident were cavaliers, but, notwithstanding the well-watered\nroads, seemed a little dashed as they cast an anxious glance at the\nrose which adorned their button-hole, or fancied that they felt a flying\nblack from a London chimney light upon the tip of their nose.\n\nWithin, the winding walks dimly echoed whispering words; the lawn was\nstudded with dazzling groups; on the terrace by the river a dainty\nmultitude beheld those celebrated waters which furnish flounders to\nRichmond and whitebait to Blackwall.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Mrs. Coningsby shall decide,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Lord Beaumanoir.\n\nEdith and Lady Theresa Lyle stood by a statue that glittered in the sun,\nsurrounded by a group of cavaliers; among them Lord Beaumanoir, Lord\nMil-ford, Lord Eugene de Vere. Her figure was not less lithe and\ngraceful since her marriage, a little more voluptuous; her rich\ncomplexion, her radiant and abounding hair, and her long grey eye, now\nmelting with pathos, and now twinkling with mockery, presented one of\nthose faces of witchery which are beyond beauty.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Mrs. Coningsby shall decide.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098It is the very thing,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Edith, \u00e2\u0080\u0098that Mrs. Coningsby will never do.\nDecision destroys suspense, and suspense is the charm of existence.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098But suspense may be agony,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Lord Eugene de Vere, casting a glance\nthat would read the innermost heart of Edith.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098And decision may be despair,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Mrs. Coningsby.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098But we agreed the other night that you were to decide everything for\nus,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Lord Beaumanoir; \u00e2\u0080\u0098and you consented.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I consented the other night, and I retract my consent to-day; and I am\nconsistent, for that is indecision.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098You are consistent in being charming,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Lord Eugene.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Pleasing and original!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Edith. \u00e2\u0080\u0098By-the-bye, when I consented that\nthe melancholy Jaques should be one of my aides-de-camp I expected him\nto maintain his reputation, not only for gloom but wit. I think you had\nbetter go back to the forest, Lord Eugene, and see if you cannot\nstumble upon a fool who may drill you in repartee. How do you do, Lady\nRiddlesworth?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 and she bowed to two ladies who seemed inclined to stop,\nbut Edith added, \u00e2\u0080\u0098I heard great applications for you this moment on the\nterrace.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Indeed!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 exclaimed the ladies; and they moved on.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098When Lady Riddlesworth joins the conversation it is like a stoppage in\nthe streets. I invented a piece of intelligence to clear the way, as\nyou would call out Fire! or The queen is coming! There used to be things\ncalled _vers de soci\u00c3\u00a9t\u00c3\u00a9_, which were not poetry; and I do not see why\nthere should not be social illusions which are not fibs.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I entirely agree with you,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Lord Milford; \u00e2\u0080\u0098and I move that we\npractise them on a large scale.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Like the verses, they might make life more light,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Lady Theresa.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098We are surrounded by illusions,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Lord Eugene, in a melancholy\ntone.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098And shams of all descriptions,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Edith; \u00e2\u0080\u0098the greatest, a man who\npretends he has a broken heart when all the time he is full of fun.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098There are a great many men who have broken hearts,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Lord\nBeaumanoir, smiling sorrowfully.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Cracked heads are much commoner,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Edith, \u00e2\u0080\u0098you may rely upon it.\nThe only man I really know with a broken heart is Lord Fitz-Booby. I do\nthink that paying Mount-Dullard\u00e2\u0080\u0099s debts has broken his heart. He takes\non so; \u00e2\u0080\u0098tis piteous. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMy dear Mrs. Coningsby,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said to me last night,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009conly think what that young man might have been; he might have been a\nlord of the treasury in \u00e2\u0080\u009835; why, if he had had nothing more in \u00e2\u0080\u009841,\nwhy, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a loss of between four and five thousand pounds; but with\nmy claims--Sir Robert, having thrown the father over, was bound on\nhis own principle to provide for the son--he might have got something\nbetter; and now he comes to me with his debts, and his reason for paying\nhis debts, too, Mrs. Coningsby, because he is going to be married; to\nbe married to a woman who has not a shilling. Why, if he had been in\noffice, and only got 1,500L. a year, and married a woman with only\nanother 1,500L., he would have had 3,000L. a year, Mrs. Coningsby; and\nnow he has nothing of his own except some debts, which he wants me to\npay, and settle 3,000L. a year on him besides.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nThey all laughed.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Ah!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Mrs. Coningsby, with a resemblance which made all start, \u00e2\u0080\u0098you\nshould have heard it with the Fitz-Booby voice.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nThe character of a woman rapidly develops after marriage, and sometimes\nseems to change, when in fact it is only complete. Hitherto we have\nknown Edith only in her girlhood, bred up in a life of great simplicity,\nand under the influence of a sweet fancy, or an absorbing passion.\nConingsby had been a hero to her before they met, the hero of nursery\nhours and nursery tales. Experience had not disturbed those dreams.\nFrom the moment they encountered each other at Millbank, he assumed that\nplace in her heart which he had long occupied in her imagination; and,\nafter their second meeting at Paris, her existence was merged in love.\nAll the crosses and vexations of their early affection only rendered\nthis state of being on her part more profound and engrossing.\n\nBut though Edith was a most happy wife, and blessed with two children\nworthy of their parents, love exercises quite a different influence\nupon a woman when she has married, and especially when she has assumed\na social position which deprives life of all its real cares. Under any\ncircumstances, that suspense, which, with all its occasional agony, is\nthe great spring of excitement, is over; but, generally speaking, it\nwill be found, notwithstanding the proverb, that with persons of a noble\nnature, the straitened fortunes which they share together, and\nmanage, and mitigate by mutual forbearance, are more conducive to the\nsustainment of a high-toned and romantic passion, than a luxurious\nprosperity.\n\nThe wife of a man of limited fortune, who, by contrivance, by the\nconcealed sacrifice of some necessity of her own, supplies him with some\nslight enjoyment which he has never asked, but which she fancies he may\nhave sighed for, experiences, without doubt, \u00c3\u00a0 degree of pleasure far\nmore ravishing than the patrician dame who stops her barouche at Storr\nand Mortimer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, and out of her pin-money buys a trinket for the husband\nwhom she loves, and which he finds, perhaps, on his dressing-table, on\nthe anniversary of their wedding-day. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pretty too and touching,\nand should be encouraged; but the other thrills, and ends in an embrace\nthat is still poetry.\n\nThe Coningsbys shortly after their marriage had been called to the\npossession of a great fortune, for which, in every sense, they were well\nadapted. But a great fortune necessarily brings with it a great change\nof habits. The claims of society proportionately increase with your\nincome. You live less for yourselves. For a selfish man, merely looking\nto his luxurious ease, Lord Eskdale\u00e2\u0080\u0099s idea of having ten thousand a\nyear, while the world suppose you have only five, is the right thing.\nConingsby, however, looked to a great fortune as one of the means,\nrightly employed, of obtaining great power. He looked also to his wife\nto assist him in this enterprise.\n\nEdith, from a native impulse, as well as from love for him, responded\nto his wish. When they were in the country, Hellingsley was a perpetual\nstream and scene of splendid hospitality; there the flower of London\nsociety mingled with all the aristocracy of the county. Leander was\noften retained specially, like a Wilde or a Kelly, to renovate the\ngenius of the habitual chief: not of the circuit, but the kitchen.\nA noble mansion in Park Lane received them the moment Parliament\nassembled. Coningsby was then immersed in affairs, and counted entirely\non Edith to cherish those social influences which in a public career\nare not less important than political ones. The whole weight of the\nmanagement of society rested on her. She had to cultivate his alliances,\nkeep together his friends, arrange his dinner-parties, regulate his\nengagements. What time for romantic love? They were never an hour alone.\nYet they loved not less; but love had taken the character of enjoyment\ninstead of a wild bewitchment; and life had become an airy bustle,\ninstead of a storm, an agony, a hurricane of the heart.\n\nIn this change in the disposition, not in the degree, of their\naffection, for there was the same amount of sweet solicitude, only it\nwas duly apportioned to everything that interested them, instead of\nbeing exclusively devoted to each other, the character of Edith, which\nhad been swallowed up by the absorbing passion, rapidly developed itself\namid the social circumstances. She was endued with great vivacity, a\nsanguine and rather saucy spirit, with considerable talents, and a large\nshare of feminine vanity: that divine gift which makes woman charming.\nEntirely sympathising with her husband, labouring with zeal to advance\nhis views, and living perpetually in the world, all these qualities\ncame to light. During her first season she had been very quiet, not less\nobservant, making herself mistress of the ground. It was prepared\nfor her next campaign. When she evinced a disposition to take a lead,\nalthough found faultless the first year, it was suddenly remembered that\nshe was a manufacturer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s daughter; and she was once described by a great\nlady as \u00e2\u0080\u0098that person whom Mr. Coningsby had married, when Lord Monmouth\ncut him off with a shilling.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nBut Edith had anticipated these difficulties, and was not to be daunted.\nProud of her husband, confident in herself, supported by a great\nestablishment, and having many friends, she determined to exchange\nsalutes with these social sharp-shooters, who are scarcely as courageous\nas they are arrogant. It was discovered that Mrs. Coningsby could be\nas malicious as her assailants, and far more epigrammatic. She could\ndescribe in a sentence and personify in a phrase. The _mot_ was\ncirculated, the _nom de nique_ repeated. Surrounded by a brilliant\nband of youth and wit, even her powers of mimickry were revealed to the\ninitiated. More than one social tyrant, whom all disliked, but whom\nnone had ventured to resist, was made ridiculous. Flushed by success and\nstimulated by admiration, Edith flattered herself that she was assisting\nher husband while she was gratifying her vanity. Her adversaries soon\nvanished, but the powers that had vanquished them were too choice to\nbe forgotten or neglected. The tone of raillery she had assumed for\nthe moment, and extended, in self-defence, to persons, was adopted as a\nhabit, and infused itself over affairs in general.\n\nMrs. Coningsby was the fashion; she was a wit as well as a beauty; a\nfascinating droll; dazzling and bewitching, the idol of every youth.\nEugene de Vere was roused from his premature exhaustion, and at last\nfound excitement again. He threw himself at her feet; she laughed at\nhim. He asked leave to follow her footsteps; she consented. He was\nonly one of a band of slaves. Lord Beaumanoir, still a bachelor, always\nhovered about her, feeding on her laughing words with a mild melancholy,\nand sometimes bandying repartee with a kind of tender and stately\ndespair. His sister, Lady Theresa Lyle, was Edith\u00e2\u0080\u0099s great friend. Their\ndispositions had some resemblance. Marriage had developed in both\nof them a frolic grace. They hunted in couple; and their sport was\nbrilliant. Many things may be said by a strong female alliance, that\nwould assume quite a different character were they even to fall from the\nlips of an Aspasia to a circle of male votaries; so much depends upon\nthe scene and the characters, the mode and the manner.\n\nThe good-natured world would sometimes pause in its amusement, and,\nafter dwelling with statistical accuracy on the number of times Mrs.\nConingsby had danced the polka, on the extraordinary things she said to\nLord Eugene de Vere, and the odd things she and Lady Theresa Lyle were\nperpetually doing, would wonder, with a face and voice of innocence,\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098how Mr. Coningsby liked all this?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 There is no doubt what was the\nanticipation by the good-natured world of Mr. Coningsby\u00e2\u0080\u0099s feelings. But\nthey were quite mistaken. There was nothing that Mr. Coningsby liked\nmore. He wished his wife to become a social power; and he wished his\nwife to be amused. He saw that, with the surface of a life of levity,\nshe already exercised considerable influence, especially over the young;\nand independently of such circumstances and considerations, he was\ndelighted to have a wife who was not afraid of going into society by\nherself; not one whom he was sure to find at home when he returned\nfrom the House of Commons, not reproaching him exactly for her social\nsacrifices, but looking a victim, and thinking that she retained her\nhusband\u00e2\u0080\u0099s heart by being a mope. Instead of that Con-ingsby wanted to be\namused when he came home, and more than that, he wanted to be instructed\nin the finest learning in the world.\n\nAs some men keep up their Greek by reading every day a chapter in the\nNew Testament, so Con-ingsby kept up his knowledge of the world, by\nalways, once at least in the four-and-twenty hours, having a delightful\nconversation with his wife. The processes were equally orthodox.\nExempted from the tax of entering general society, free to follow his\nown pursuits, and to live in that political world which alone interested\nhim, there was not an anecdote, a trait, a good thing said, or a bad\nthing done, which did not reach him by a fine critic and a lively\nnarrator. He was always behind those social scenes which, after all,\nregulate the political performers, knew the springs of the whole\nmachinery, the chang-ings and the shiftings, the fiery cars and golden\nchariots which men might mount, and the trap-doors down which men might\nfall.\n\nBut the Marquess of Montacute is making his reverence to Mrs. Guy\nFlouncey.\n\nThere was not at this moment a human being whom that lady was more glad\nto see at her _d\u00c3\u00a9je\u00c3\u00bbner_; but she did not show it in the least. Her\nself-possession, indeed, was the finest work of art of the day, and\nought to be exhibited at the Adelaide Gallery. Like all mechanical\ninventions of a high class, it had been brought to perfection very\ngradually, and after many experiments. A variety of combinations, and\nan almost infinite number of trials, must have been expended before the\ntoo-startling laugh of Con-ingsby Castle could have subsided into the\nhaughty suavity of that sunny glance, which was not familiar enough for\na smile, nor foolish enough for a simper. As for the rattling vein which\ndistinguished her in the days of our first acquaintance, that had long\nceased. Mrs. Guy Flouncey now seemed to share the prevalent passion for\ngenuine Saxon, and used only monosyllables; while Fine-ear himself would\nhave been sometimes at fault had he attempted to give a name to her\ndelicate breathings. In short, Mrs. Guy Flouncey never did or said\nanything but in \u00e2\u0080\u0098the best taste.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 It may, however, be a question,\nwhether she ever would have captivated Lord Monmouth, and those who\nlike a little nature and fun, if she had made her first advances in this\nstyle. But that showed the greatness of the woman. Then she was ready\nfor anything for promotion. That was the age of forlorn hopes; but now\nshe was a general of division, and had assumed a becoming carriage.\n\nThis was the first _d\u00c3\u00a9je\u00c3\u00bbner_ at which Tancred had been present. He\nrather liked it. The scene, lawns and groves and a glancing river, the\nair, the music, our beautiful countrywomen, who, with their brilliant\ncomplexions and bright bonnets, do not shrink from the daylight, these\nare circumstances which, combined with youth and health, make a morning\nfestival, say what they like, particularly for the first time, very\nagreeable, even if one be dreaming of Jerusalem. Strange power of the\nworld, that the moment we enter it, our great conceptions dwarf! In\nyouth it is quick sympathy that degrades them; more advanced, it is the\nsense of the ridiculous. But perhaps these reveries of solitude may not\nbe really great conceptions; perhaps they are only exaggerations;\nvague, indefinite, shadowy, formed on no sound principles, founded on no\nassured basis.\n\nWhy should Tancred go to Jerusalem? What does it signify to him whether\nthere be religious truth or political justice? He has youth, beauty,\nrank, wealth, power, and all in excess. He has a mind that can\ncomprehend their importance and appreciate their advantages. What more\ndoes he require? Unreasonable boy! And if he reach Jerusalem, why should\nhe find religious truth and political justice there? He can read of\nit in the travelling books, written by young gentlemen, with the best\nletters of introduction to all the consuls. They tell us what it is, a\nthird-rate city in a stony wilderness. Will the Providence of fashion\nprevent this great folly about to be perpetrated by one born to be\nfashion\u00e2\u0080\u0099s most brilliant subject? A folly, too, which may end in a\ncatastrophe? His parents, indeed, have appealed in vain; but the\nsneer of the world will do more than the supplication of the father. A\nmother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tear may be disregarded, but the sigh of a mistress has changed\nthe most obdurate. We shall see. At present Lady Constance Rawleigh\nexpresses her pleasure at Tancred\u00e2\u0080\u0099s arrival, and his heart beats a\nlittle.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV.\n\n     _Disenchantment_\n\nTHEY are talking about it,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Lord Eskdale to the duchess, as she\nlooked up to him with an expression of the deepest interest. \u00e2\u0080\u0098He asked\nSt. Patrick to introduce him to her at Deloraine House, danced with her,\nwas with her the whole evening, went to the breakfast on Saturday to\nmeet her, instead of going to Blackwall to see a yacht he was after.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098If it were only Katherine,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said the duchess, \u00e2\u0080\u0098I should be quite\nhappy.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be uneasy,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Lord Eskdale; \u00e2\u0080\u0098there will be plenty of\nKatherines and Constances, too, before he finishes. The affair is not\nmuch, but it shows, as I foretold, that, the moment he found something\nmore amusing, his taste for yachting would pass off.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 \u00e2\u0080\u0098You are right,\nyou always are.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 What really was this affair, which Lord Eskdale held\nlightly? With a character like Tancred, everything may become important.\nProfound and yet simple, deep in self-knowledge yet inexperienced, his\nreserve, which would screen him from a thousand dangers, was just the\nquality which would insure his thraldom by the individual who could once\neffectually melt the icy barrier and reach the central heat. At this\nmoment of his life, with all the repose, and sometimes even the high\nceremony, on the surface, he was a being formed for high-reaching\nexploits, ready to dare everything and reckless of all consequences, if\nhe proposed to himself an object which he believed to be just and great.\nThis temper of mind would, in all things, have made him act with that\nrapidity, which is rashness with the weak, and decision with the strong.\nThe influence of woman on him was novel. It was a disturbing influence,\non which he had never counted in those dreams and visions in which there\nhad figured more heroes than heroines. In the imaginary interviews in\nwhich he had disciplined his solitary mind, his antagonists had been\nstatesmen, prelates, sages, and senators, with whom he struggled and\nwhom he vanquished.\n\nHe was not unequal in practice to his dreams. His shyness would have\nvanished in an instant before a great occasion; he could have addressed\na public assembly; he was capable of transacting important affairs.\nThese were all situations and contingencies which he had foreseen, and\nwhich for him were not strange, for he had become acquainted with them\nin his reveries. But suddenly he was arrested by an influence for which\nhe was unprepared; a precious stone made him stumble who was to have\nscaled the Alps. Why should the voice, the glance, of another agitate\nhis heart? The cherubim of his heroic thoughts not only deserted him,\nbut he was left without the guardian angel of his shyness. He melted,\nand the iceberg might degenerate into a puddle.\n\nLord Eskdale drew his conclusions like a clever man of the world, and in\ngeneral he would have been right; but a person like Tancred was in much\ngreater danger of being captured than a common-place youth entering\nlife with second-hand experience, and living among those who ruled his\nopinions by their sneers and sarcasms. A malicious tale by a spiteful\nwoman, the chance ribaldry of a club-room window, have often been the\nimpure agencies which have saved many a youth from committing a great\nfolly; but Tancred was beyond all these influences. If they had\nbeen brought to bear on him, they would rather have precipitated the\ncatastrophe. His imagination would have immediately been summoned to the\nrescue of his offended pride; he would have invested the object of\nhis regard with supernatural qualities, and consoled her for the\nimpertinence of society by his devotion.\n\nLady Constance was clever; she talked like a married woman, was\ncritical, yet easy; and having guanoed her mind by reading French\nnovels, had a variety of conclusions on all social topics, which she\nthrew forth with unfaltering promptness, and with the well-arranged air\nof an impromptu. These were all new to Tancred, and startling. He was\nattracted by the brilliancy, though he often regretted the tone, which\nhe ascribed to the surrounding corruption from which he intended to\nescape, and almost wished to save her at the same time. Sometimes\nTancred looked unusually serious; but at last his rare and brilliant\nsmile beamed upon one who really admired him, was captivated by his\nintellect, his freshness, his difference from all around, his\npensive beauty and his grave innocence. Lady Constance was free from\naffectation; she was frank and natural; she did not conceal the pleasure\nshe had in his society; she conducted herself with that dignified\nfacility, becoming a young lady who had already refused the hands of two\nfuture earls, and of the heir of the Clan-Alpins.\n\nA short time after the _d\u00c3\u00a9je\u00c3\u00bbner_ at Craven Cottage, Lord Montacute\ncalled on Lady Charmouth. She was at home, and received him with great\ncordiality, looking up from her frame of worsted work with a benign\nmaternal expression; while Lady Constance, who was writing an urgent\nreply to a note that had just arrived, said rapidly some agreeable\nwords of welcome, and continued her task. Tancred seated himself by the\nmother, made an essay in that small talk in which he was by no means\npractised, but Lady Charmouth helped him on without seeming to do so.\nThe note was at length dispatched, Tancred of course still remaining at\nthe mother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s side, and Lady Constance too distant for his wishes. He had\nnothing to say to Lady Charmouth; he began to feel that the pleasure of\nfeminine society consisted in talking alone to her daughter.\n\nWhile he was meditating a retreat, and yet had hardly courage to rise\nand walk alone down a large long room, a new guest was announced.\nTancred rose, and murmured good-morning; and yet, somehow or other,\ninstead of quitting the apartment, he went and seated himself by Lady\nConstance. It really was as much the impulse of shyness, which sought\na nook of refuge, as any other feeling that actuated him; but Lady\nConstance seemed pleased, and said in a low voice and in a careless\ntone, \u00e2\u0080\u0098\u00e2\u0080\u0099Tis Lady Bran-cepeth; do you know her? Mamma\u00e2\u0080\u0099s great friend;\u00e2\u0080\u0099\nwhich meant, you need give yourself no trouble to talk to any one but\nmyself.\n\nAfter making herself very agreeable, Lady Constance took up a book\nwhich was at hand, and said, \u00e2\u0080\u0098Do you know this?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 And Tancred, opening a\nvolume which he had never seen, and then turning to its titlepage, found\nit was \u00e2\u0080\u0098The Revelations of Chaos,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 a startling work just published, and\nof which a rumour had reached him.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098No,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he replied; \u00e2\u0080\u0098I have not seen it.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I will lend it you if you like: it is one of those books one must read.\nIt explains everything, and is written in a very agreeable style.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098It explains everything!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Tancred; \u00e2\u0080\u0098it must, indeed, be a very\nremarkable book!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I think it will just suit you,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Lady Constance. \u00e2\u0080\u0098Do you know, I\nthought so several times while I was reading it.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098To judge from the title, the subject is rather obscure,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Tancred.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098No longer so,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Lady Constance. \u00e2\u0080\u0098It is treated scientifically;\neverything is explained by geology and astronomy, and in that way. It\nshows you exactly how a star is formed; nothing can be so pretty! A\ncluster of vapour, the cream of the Milky Way, a sort of celestial\ncheese, churned into light, you must read it, \u00e2\u0080\u0098tis charming.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Nobody ever saw a star formed,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Tancred.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Perhaps not. You must read the \u00e2\u0080\u009cRevelations;\u00e2\u0080\u009d it is all explained. But\nwhat is most interesting, is the way in which man has been developed.\nYou know, all is development. The principle is perpetually going on.\nFirst, there was nothing, then there was something; then, I forget the\nnext, I think there were shells, then fishes; then we came, let me see,\ndid we come next? Never mind that; we came at last. And the next change\nthere will be something very superior to us, something with wings. Ah!\nthat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s it: we were fishes, and I believe we shall be crows. But you must\nread it.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I do not believe I ever was a fish,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Tancred. \u00e2\u0080\u0098Oh! but it is all\nproved; you must not argue on my rapid sketch; read the book. It is\nimpossible to contradict anything in it. You understand, it is all\nscience; it is not like those books in which one says one thing and\nanother the contrary, and both may be wrong. Everything is proved: by\ngeology, you know. You see exactly how everything is made; how many\nworlds there have been; how long they lasted; what went before, what\ncomes next. We are a link in the chain, as inferior animals were that\npreceded us: we in turn shall be inferior; all that will remain of us\nwill be some relics in a new red sandstone. This is development. We had\nfins; we may have wings.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nTancred grew silent and thoughtful; Lady Bran-cepeth moved, and he\nrose at the same time. Lady Charmouth looked as if it were by no means\nnecessary for him to depart, but he bowed very low, and then bade\nfarewell to Lady Constance, who said, \u00e2\u0080\u0098We shall meet to-night.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I was a fish, and I shall be a crow,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Tancred to himself, when the\nhall door closed on him. \u00e2\u0080\u0098What a spiritual mistress! And yesterday, for\na moment, I almost dreamed of kneeling with her at the Holy Sepulchre! I\nmust get out of this city as quickly as possible; I cannot cope with\nits corruption. The acquaintance, however, has been of use to me, for\nI think I have got a yacht by it. I believe it was providential, and a\ntrial. I will go home and write instantly to Fitz-Heron, and accept his\noffer. One hundred and eighty tons: it will do; it must.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nAt this moment he met Lord Eskdale, who had observed Tancred from the\nend of Grosvenor Square, on the steps of Lord Charmouth\u00e2\u0080\u0099s door. This\ncircumstance ill prepared Lord Eskdale for Tancred\u00e2\u0080\u0099s salutation.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098My dear lord, you are just the person I wanted to meet. You promised to\nrecommend me a servant who had travelled in the East.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Well, are you in a hurry?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Lord Eskdale, gaining time, and\npumping.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I should like to get off as soon as practicable.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 \u00e2\u0080\u0098Humph!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Lord\nEskdale. \u00e2\u0080\u0098Have you got a yacht?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 \u00e2\u0080\u0098I have.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Oh! So you want a servant?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he added, after a moment\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pause.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I mentioned that, because you were so kind as to say you could help me\nin that respect.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Ah! I did,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Lord Eskdale, thoughtfully. \u00e2\u0080\u0098But I want a great many\nthings,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 continued Tancred. \u00e2\u0080\u0098I must make arrangements about money; I\nsuppose I must get some letters; in fact, I want generally your advice.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098What are you going to do about the colonel and the rest?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I have promised my father to take them,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Tancred, \u00e2\u0080\u0098though I feel\nthey will only embarrass me. They have engaged to be ready at a week\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nnotice; I shall write to them immediately. If they do not fulfil their\nengagement, I am absolved from mine.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098So you have got a yacht, eh?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Lord Eskdale. \u00e2\u0080\u0098I suppose you have\nbought the Basilisk?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Exactly.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098She wants a good deal doing to her.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Something, but chiefly for show, which I do not care about; but I mean\nto get away, and refit, if necessary, at Gibraltar. I must go.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Well, if you must go,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said his lordship, and then he added, \u00e2\u0080\u0098and in\nsuch a hurry; let me see. You want a firstrate managing man, used to the\nEast, and letters, and money, and advice. Hem! You don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know Sidonia?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Not at all.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098He is the man to get hold of, but that is so difficult now. He never\ngoes anywhere. Let me see, this is Monday; to-morrow is post-day, and\nI dine with him alone in the City. Well, you shall hear from me on\nWednesday morning early, about everything; but I would not write to the\ncolonel and his friends just yet.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI.\n\n     _Tancred Rescues a Lady in Distress_\n\nTHAT is most striking in London is its vastness. It is the illimitable\nfeeling that gives it a special character. London is not grand. It\npossesses only one of the qualifications of a grand city, size; but it\nwants the equally important one, beauty. It is the union of these two\nqualities that produced the grand cities, the Romes, the Babylons,\nthe hundred portals of the Pharaohs; multitudes and magnificence; the\nmillions influenced by art. Grand cities are unknown since the beautiful\nhas ceased to be the principle of invention. Paris, of modern capitals,\nhas aspired to this character; but if Paris be a beautiful city, it\ncertainly is not a grand one; its population is too limited, and, from\nthe nature of their dwellings, they cover a comparatively small space.\nConstantinople is picturesque; nature has furnished a sublime site, but\nit has little architectural splendour, and you reach the environs with a\nfatal facility. London overpowers us with its vastness.\n\nPlace a Forum or an Acropolis in its centre, and the effect of the\nmetropolitan mass, which now has neither head nor heart, instead of\nbeing stupefying, would be ennobling. Nothing more completely represents\na nation than a public building. A member of Parliament only represents,\nat the most, the united constituencies: but the Palace of the Sovereign,\na National Gallery, or a Museum baptised with the name of the country,\nthese are monuments to which all should be able to look up with pride,\nand which should exercise an elevating influence upon the spirit of the\nhumblest. What is their influence in London? Let us not criticise what\nall condemn. But how remedy the evil? What is wanted in architecture,\nas in so many things, is a man. Shall we find a refuge in a Committee of\nTaste? Escape from the mediocrity of one to the mediocrity of many? We\nonly multiply our feebleness, and aggravate our deficiencies. But one\nsuggestion might be made. No profession in England has done its duty\nuntil it has furnished its victim. The pure administration of justice\ndates from the deposition of Macclesfield. Even our boasted navy never\nachieved a great victory until we shot an admiral. Suppose an architect\nwere hanged? Terror has its inspiration as well as competition.\n\nThough London is vast, it is very monotonous. All those new districts\nthat have sprung up within the last half-century, the creatures of our\ncommercial and colonial wealth, it is impossible to conceive anything\nmore tame, more insipid, more uniform. Pancras is like Mary-le-bone,\nMary-le-bone is like Paddington; all the streets resemble each other,\nyou must read the names of the squares before you venture to knock at\na door. This amount of building capital ought to have produced a great\ncity. What an opportunity for architecture suddenly summoned to furnish\nhabitations for a population equal to that of the city of Bruxelles,\nand a population, too, of great wealth. Mary-le-bone alone ought to have\nproduced a revolution in our domestic architecture. It did nothing. It\nwas built by Act of Parliament. Parliament prescribed even a fa\u00c3\u00a7ade. It\nis Parliament to whom we are indebted for your Gloucester Places, and\nBaker Streets, and Harley Streets, and Wimpole Streets, and all those\nflat, dull, spiritless streets, resembling each other like a large\nfamily of plain children, with Portland Place and Portman Square for\ntheir respectable parents. The influence of our Parliamentary Government\nupon the fine arts is a subject worth pursuing. The power that produced\nBaker Street as a model for street architecture in its celebrated\nBuilding Act, is the power that prevented Whitehall from being\ncompleted, and which sold to foreigners all the pictures which the King\nof England had collected to civilise his people.\n\nIn our own days we have witnessed the rapid creation of a new\nmetropolitan quarter, built solely for the aristocracy by an aristocrat.\nThe Belgrave district is as monotonous as Mary-le-bone; and is so\ncontrived as to be at the same time insipid and tawdry.\n\nWhere London becomes more interesting is Charing Cross. Looking to\nNorthumberland House, and turning your back upon Trafalgar Square, the\nStrand is perhaps the finest street in Europe, blending the architecture\nof many periods; and its river ways are a peculiar feature and rich with\nassociations. Fleet Street, with its Temple, is not unworthy of being\ncontiguous to the Strand. The fire of London has deprived us of the\ndelight of a real old quarter of the city; but some bits remain, and\neverywhere there is a stirring multitude, and a great crush and crash of\ncarts and wains. The Inns of Court, and the quarters in the vicinity of\nthe port, Thames Street, Tower Hill, Billingsgate, Wapping, Rotherhithe,\nare the best parts of London; they are full of character: the buildings\nbear a nearer relation to what the people are doing than in the more\npolished quarters.\n\nThe old merchants of the times of the first Georges were a fine race.\nThey knew their position, and built up to it. While the territorial\naristocracy, pulling down their family hotels, were raising vulgar\nstreets and squares upon their site, and occupying themselves one of\nthe new tenements, the old merchants filled the straggling lanes, which\nconnected the Royal Exchange with the port of London, with mansions\nwhich, if not exactly equal to the palaces of stately Venice, might at\nleast vie with many of the hotels of old Paris. Some of these,\nthough the great majority have been broken up into chambers and\ncounting-houses, still remain intact.\n\nIn a long, dark, narrow, crooked street, which is still called a lane,\nand which runs from the south side of the street of the Lombards towards\nthe river, there is one of these old houses of a century past, and\nwhich, both in its original design and present condition, is a noble\nspecimen of its order. A pair of massy iron gates, of elaborate\nworkmanship, separate the street from its spacious and airy court-yard,\nwhich is formed on either side by a wing of the mansion, itself a\nbuilding of deep red brick, with a pediment, and pilasters, and copings\nof stone. A flight of steps leads to the lofty and central doorway; in\nthe middle of the court there is a garden plot, inclosing a fountain,\nand a fine plane tree.\n\nThe stillness, doubly effective after the tumult just quitted, the\nlulling voice of the water, the soothing aspect of the quivering\nfoliage, the noble building, and the cool and capacious quadrangle, the\naspect even of those who enter, and frequently enter, the precinct, and\nwho are generally young men, gliding in and out, earnest and full\nof thought, all contribute to give to this locality something of the\nclassic repose of a college, instead of a place agitated with the\nmost urgent interests of the current hour; a place that deals with the\nfortunes of kings and empires, and regulates the most important affairs\nof nations, for it is the counting-house in the greatest of modern\ncities of the most celebrated of modern financiers.\n\nIt was the visit of Tancred to the City, on the Wednesday morning after\nhe had met Lord Eskdale, that occasions me to touch on some of the\ncharacteristics of our capital. It was the first time that Tancred had\never been in the City proper, and it greatly interested him. His visit\nwas prompted by receiving, early on Wednesday morning, the following\nletter:\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Dear Tancred: I saw Sidonia yesterday, and spoke to him of what you\nwant. He is much occupied just now, as his uncle, who attended to\naffairs here, is dead, and, until he can import another uncle or cousin,\nhe must steer the ship, as times are critical. But he bade me say you\nmight call upon him in the City to-day, at two o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock. He lives in\nSequin Court, near the Bank. You will have no difficulty in finding\nit. I recommend you to go, as he is the sort of man who will really\nunderstand what you mean, which neither your father nor myself do\nexactly; and, besides, he is a person to know.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I enclose a line which you will send in, that there may be no mistake.\nI should tell you, as you are very fresh, that he is of the Hebrew race;\nso don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t go on too much about the Holy Sepulchre.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Yours faithfully,\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098ESKDALE.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Spring Gardens, Wednesday morning.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\nIt is just where the street is most crowded, where it narrows, and\nlosing the name of Cheapside, takes that of the Poultry, that the last\nof a series of stoppages occurred; a stoppage which, at the end of ten\nminutes, lost its inert character of mere obstruction, and\ndeveloped into the livelier qualities of the row. There were oaths,\ncontradictions, menaces: \u00e2\u0080\u0098No, you sha\u00e2\u0080\u0099n\u00e2\u0080\u0099t; Yes, I will; No, I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t;\nYes, you did; No, you haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t; Yes, I have;\u00e2\u0080\u0099 the lashing of a whip, the\ninterference of a policeman, a crash, a scream. Tan-cred looked out of\nthe window of his brougham. He saw a chariot in distress, a chariot such\nas would have become an Ondine by the waters of the Serpentine, and the\nvery last sort of equipage that you could expect to see smashed in the\nPoultry. It was really breaking a butterfly upon a wheel to crush its\ndelicate springs, and crack its dark brown panels, soil its dainty\nhammer-cloth, and endanger the lives of its young coachman in a flaxen\nwig, and its two tall footmen in short coats, worthy of Cinderella.\n\nThe scream, too, came from a fair owner, who was surrounded by clamorous\ncarmen and city marshals, and who, in an unknown land, was afraid she\nmight be put in a city compter, because the people in the city had\ndestroyed her beautiful chariot. Tan-cred let himself out of his\nbrougham, and not without difficulty contrived, through the narrow and\ncrowded passage formed by the two lines, to reach the chariot, which was\ncoming the contrary way to him. Some ruthless officials were persuading\na beautiful woman to leave her carriage, the wheel of which was broken.\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098But where am I to go?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 she exclaimed. \u00e2\u0080\u0098Icannot walk. I will not leave\nmy carriage until you bring me some conveyance. You ought to punish\nthese people, who have quite ruined my chariot.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098They say it was your coachman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fault; we have nothing to do with that;\nbesides, you know who they are. Their employers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 name is on the cart,\nBrown, Bugsby, and Co., Limehouse. You can have your redress against\nBrown, Bugsby, and Co., Lime-house, if your coachman is not in fault;\nbut you cannot stop up the way, and you had better get out, and let the\ncarriage be removed to the Steel-yard.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098What am I to do?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 exclaimed the lady with a tearful eye and agitated\nface.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I have a carriage at hand,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Tancred, who at this moment reached\nher, \u00e2\u0080\u0098and it is quite at your service.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nThe lady cast her beautiful eyes, with an expression of astonishment she\ncould not conceal, at the distinguished youth who thus suddenly appeared\nin the midst of insolent carmen, brutal policemen, and all the cynical\namateurs of a mob. Public opinion in the Poultry was against her; her\ncoachman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s wig had excited derision; the footmen had given themselves\nairs; there was a strong feeling against the shortcoats. As for the\nlady, though at first awed by her beauty and magnificence, they rebelled\nagainst the authority of her manner. Besides, she was not alone. There\nwas a gentleman with her, who wore moustaches, and had taken a part in\nthe proceedings at first, by addressing the carmen in French. This was\ntoo much, and the mob declared he was Don Carlos.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098You are too good,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said the lady, with a sweet expression.\n\n[Illustration: page152]\n\nTancred opened the door of the chariot, the policemen pulled down the\nsteps, the servants were told to do the best they could with the wrecked\nequipage; in a second the lady and her companion were in Tancred\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nbrougham, who, desiring his servants to obey all their orders,\ndisappeared, for the stoppage at this moment began to move, and there\nwas no time for bandying compliments.\n\nHe had gained the pavement, and had made his way as far as the Mansion\nHouse, when, finding a group of public buildings, he thought it prudent\nto inquire which was the Bank.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098That is the Bank,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said a good-natured man, in a bustle, but taken by\nTancred\u00e2\u0080\u0099s unusual appearance. \u00e2\u0080\u0098What do you want? I am going there.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I do not want exactly the Bank,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 replied Tancred, \u00e2\u0080\u0098but a place\nsomewhere near it. Do you happen to know, sir, a place called Sequin\nCourt?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I should think I did,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said the man, smiling. \u00e2\u0080\u0098So you are going to\nSidonia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII.\n\n     _The Wizard of Fortune_\n\nTANCRED entered Sequin Court; a chariot with a foreign coronet was at\nthe foot of the great steps which he ascended. He was received by a fat\nhall porter, who would not have disgraced his father\u00e2\u0080\u0099s establishment,\nand who, rising with lazy insolence from his hooded chair, when he\nobserved that Tancred did not advance, asked the new comer what\nhe wanted. \u00e2\u0080\u0098I want Monsieur de Sidonia.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 \u00e2\u0080\u0098Can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t see him now; he is\nengaged.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 \u00e2\u0080\u0098I have a note for him.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Very well, give it me; it will be sent in. You can sit here.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 And the\nporter opened the door of a waiting-room, which Tancred declined to\nenter. \u00e2\u0080\u0098I will wait here, thank you,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Tancred, and he looked round\nat the old oak hall, on the walls of which were hung several portraits,\nand from which ascended one of those noble staircases never found in a\nmodern London mansion. At the end of the hall, on a slab of porphyry,\nwas a marble bust, with this inscription on it, \u00e2\u0080\u0098_Fundator_.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 It was the\nfirst Sidonia, by Chantrey.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I will wait here, thank you,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Tancred, looking round; and then,\nwith some hesitation, he added, \u00e2\u0080\u0098I have an appointment here at two\no\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nAs he spoke, that hour sounded from the belfry of an old city church\nthat was at hand, and then was taken up by the chimes of a large German\nclock in the hall.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098It may be,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said the porter, \u00e2\u0080\u0098but I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t disturb master now; the\nSpanish ambassador is with him, and others are waiting. When he is gone,\na clerk will take in your letter with some others that are here.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nAt this moment, and while Tancred remained in the hall, various persons\nentered, and, without noticing the porter, pursued their way across the\napartment.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098And where are those persons going?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 inquired Tancred.\n\nThe porter looked at the enquirer with a blended gaze of curiosity and\ncontempt, and then negligently answered him without looking in Tancred\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nface, and while he was brushing up the hearth, \u00e2\u0080\u0098Some are going to the\ncounting-house, and some are going to the Bank, I should think.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I wonder if our hall porter is such an infernal bully as Monsieur de\nSidonia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 thought Tancred.\n\nThere was a stir. \u00e2\u0080\u0098The ambassador is coming out,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said the hall porter;\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098you must not stand in the way.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nThe well-trained ear of this guardian of the gate was conversant with\nevery combination of sound which the apartments of Sequin Court could\nproduce. Close as the doors might be shut, you could not rise from your\nchair without his being aware of it; and in the present instance he was\ncorrect. A door at the end of the hall opened, and the Spanish minister\ncame forth.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Stand aside,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said the hall porter to Tancred; and, summoning the\nservants without, he ushered his excellency with some reverence to his\ncarriage.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Now your letter will go in with the others,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he said to Tancred, whom\nfor a few moments he left alone, and then returned, taking no notice of\nour young friend, but, depositing his bulky form in his hooded chair, he\nresumed the city article of the _Times_.\n\nThe letter ran thus:\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Dear Sidonia: This will be given you by my cousin Montacute, of whom\nI spoke to you yesterday. He wants to go to Jerusalem, which very much\nperplexes his family, for he is an only child. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t suppose the\ndanger is what they imagine. But still there is nothing like experience,\nand there is no one who knows so much of these things as yourself. I\nhave promised his father and mother, very innocent people, whom of all\nmy relatives, I most affect, to do what I can for him. If, therefore,\nyou can aid Montacute, you will really serve me. He seems to have\ncharacter, though I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t well make him out. I fear I indulged in the\nhock yesterday, for I feel a twinge. Yours faithfully,\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098ESKDALE.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Wednesday morning.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\nThe hall clock had commenced the quarter chimes, when a young man,\nfair and intelligent, and wearing spectacles, came into the hall, and,\nopening the door of the waiting-room, looked as if he expected to find\nsome one there; then, turning to the porter, he said, \u00e2\u0080\u0098Where is Lord\nMontacute?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nThe porter rose from his hooded chair, and put down the newspaper, but\nTancred had advanced when he heard his name, and bowed, and followed the\nyoung man in spectacles, who invited Tancred to accompany him.\n\nTancred was ushered into a spacious and rather long apartment, panelled\nwith old oak up to the white coved ceiling, which was richly ornamented.\nFour windows looked upon the fountain and the plane tree. A portrait by\nLawrence, evidently of the same individual who had furnished the model\nto Chantrey, was over the high, old-fashioned, but very handsome marble\nmantel-piece. A Turkey carpet, curtains of crimson damask, some large\ntables covered with papers, several easy chairs, against the walls some\niron cabinets, these were the furniture of the room, at one corner of\nwhich was a glass door, which led to a vista of apartments fitted up as\ncounting-houses, filled with clerks, and which, if expedient, might be\ncovered by a baize screen, which was now unclosed.\n\nA gentleman writing at a table rose as he came in, and extending his\nhand said, as he pointed to a seat, \u00e2\u0080\u0098I am afraid I have made you come\nout at an unusual hour.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nThe young man in spectacles in the meanwhile retired; Tancred had bowed\nand murmured his compliments: and his host, drawing his chair a little\nfrom the table, continued: \u00e2\u0080\u0098Lord Eskdale tells me that you have some\nthoughts of going to Jerusalem.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I have for some time had that intention.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098It is a pity that you did not set out earlier in the year, and then you\nmight have been there during the Easter pilgrimage. It is a fine sight.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098It is a pity,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Tancred; \u00e2\u0080\u0098but to reach Jerusalem is with me an\nobject of so much moment, that I shall be content to find myself there\nat any time, and under any circumstances.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098It is no longer difficult to reach Jerusalem; the real difficulty is\nthe one experienced by the crusaders, to know what to do when you have\narrived there.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098It is the land of inspiration,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Tancred, slightly blushing; \u00e2\u0080\u0098and\nwhen I am there, I would humbly pray that my course may be indicated to\nme.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098And you think that no prayers, however humble, would obtain for you\nthat indication before your departure?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098This is not the land of inspiration,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 replied Tancred, timidly.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098But you have your Church,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Sidonia.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Which I hold of divine institution, and which should be under the\nimmediate influence of the Holy Spirit,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Tancred, dropping his\neyes, and colouring still more as he found himself already trespassing\non that delicate province of theology which always fascinated him, but\nwhich it had been intimated to him by Lord Eskdale that he should avoid.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Is it wanting to you, then, in this conjuncture?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 inquired his\ncompanion.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I find its opinions conflicting, its decrees contradictory, its conduct\ninconsistent,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 replied Tancred. \u00e2\u0080\u0098I have conferred with one who is\nesteemed its most eminent prelate, and I have left him with a conviction\nof what I had for some time suspected, that inspiration is not only a\ndivine but a local quality.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098You and I have some reason to believe so,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Sidonia. \u00e2\u0080\u0098I believe\nthat God spoke to Moses on Mount Horeb, and you believe that he was\ncrucified, in the person of Jesus, on Mount Calvary. Both were, at least\ncarnally, children of Israel: they spoke Hebrew to the Hebrews. The\nprophets were only Hebrews; the apostles were only Hebrews. The churches\nof Asia, which have vanished, were founded by a native Hebrew; and the\nchurch of Rome, which says it shall last for ever, and which converted\nthis island to the faith of Moses and of Christ, vanquishing the Druids,\nJupiter Olympius, and Woden, who had successively invaded it, was also\nfounded by a native Hebrew. Therefore, I say, your suspicion or your\nconviction is, at least, not a fantastic one.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nTancred listened to Sidonia as he spoke with great interest, and with an\nearnest and now quite unembarrassed manner. The height of the argument\nhad immediately surmounted all his social reserve. His intelligence\nresponded to the great theme that had so long occupied his musing\nhours; and the unexpected character of a conversation which, as he\nhad supposed, would have mainly treated of letters of credit, the more\nexcited him.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Then,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Tancred, with animation, \u00e2\u0080\u0098seeing how things are, that I am\nborn in an age and in a country divided between infidelity on one side\nand an anarchy of creeds on the other; with none competent to guide\nme, yet feeling that I must believe, for I hold that duty cannot exist\nwithout faith; is it so wild as some would think it, I would say is it\nunreasonable, that I should wish to do that which, six centuries ago,\nwas done by my ancestor whose name I bear, and that I should cross the\nseas, and----?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 He hesitated.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098And visit the Holy Sepulchre,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Sidonia.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098And visit the Holy Sepulchre,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Tancred, solemnly; \u00e2\u0080\u0098for that, I\nconfess, is my sovereign thought.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Well, the crusades were of vast advantage to Europe,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Sidonia,\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098and renovated the spiritual hold which Asia has always had upon the\nNorth. It seems to wane at present, but it is only the decrease that\nprecedes the new development.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098It must be so,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Tancred; \u00e2\u0080\u0098for who can believe that a country\nonce sanctified by the Divine Presence can ever be as other lands? Some\ncelestial quality, distinguishing it from all other climes, must for\never linger about it. I would ask those mountains, that were reached by\nangels, why they no longer receive heavenly visitants. I would appeal\nto that Comforter promised to man, on the sacred spot on which the\nassurance of solace was made. I require a Comforter. I have appealed\nto the holy influence in vain in England. It has not visited me; I know\nnone here on whom it has descended. I am induced, therefore, to believe\nthat it is part of the divine scheme that its influence should be local;\nthat it should be approached with reverence, not thoughtlessly and\nhurriedly, but with such difficulties and such an interval of time as a\npilgrimage to a spot sanctified can alone secure.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nSidonia listened to Tancred with deep attention. Lord Montacute was\nseated opposite the windows, so that there was a full light upon the\nplay of the countenance, the expression of which Sidonia watched, while\nhis keen and far-reaching vision traced at the same time the formation\nand development of the head of his visitor. He recognised in this youth\nnot a vain and vague visionary, but a being in whom the faculties of\nreason and imagination were both of the highest class, and both\nequally developed. He observed that he was of a nature passionately\naffectionate, and that he was of a singular audacity. He perceived that\nthough, at this moment, Tancred was as ignorant of the world as a\nyoung monk, he possessed all the latent qualities which in future would\nqualify him to control society. When Tancred had finished speaking,\nthere was a pause of a few seconds, during which Sidonia seemed lost in\nthought; then, looking up, he said, \u00e2\u0080\u0098It appears to me, Lord Montacute,\nthat what you want is to penetrate the great Asian mystery.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098You have touched my inmost thought,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Tancred, eagerly.\n\nAt this moment there entered the room, from the glass door, the same\nyoung man who had ushered Tancred into the apartment. He brought a\nletter to Sidonia. Lord Montacute felt confused; his shyness returned to\nhim; he deplored the unfortunate interruption, but he felt he was in\nthe way. He rose, and began to say good-morning, when Sidonia, without\ntaking his eyes off the letter, saw him, and waving his hand, stopped\nhim, saying, \u00e2\u0080\u0098I settled with Lord Eskdale that you were not to go away\nif anything occurred which required my momentary attention. So pray sit\ndown, unless you have engagements.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 And Tancred again seated himself.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Write,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 continued Sidonia to the clerk, \u00e2\u0080\u0098that my letters are twelve\nhours later than the despatches, and that the City continued quite\ntranquil. Let the extract from the Berlin letter be left at the same\ntime at the Treasury. The last bulletin?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Consols drooping at half-past two; all the foreign funds lower; shares\nvery active.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nThey were once more alone. \u00e2\u0080\u0098When do you propose going?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 \u00e2\u0080\u0098I hope in a\nweek.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 \u00e2\u0080\u0098Alone?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I fear I shall have many attendants.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 \u00e2\u0080\u0098That is a pity. Well, when\nyou arrive at Jerusalem, you will naturally go to the convent of Terra\nSanta. You will make there the acquaintance of the Spanish prior, Alonzo\nLara. He calls me cousin; he is a Nuevo of the fourteenth century. Very\northodox; but the love of the old land and the old language have come\nout in him, as they will, though his blood is no longer clear, but has\nbeen modified by many Gothic intermarriages, which was never our case.\nWe are pure Sephardim. Lara thoroughly comprehends Palestine and all\nthat pertains to it. He has been there a quarter of a century, and might\nhave been Archbishop of Seville. You see, he is master of the old as\nwell as the new learning; this is very important; they often explain\neach other. Your bishops here know nothing about these things. How\ncan they? A few centuries back they were tattooed savages. This is the\nadvantage which Rome has over you, and which you never can understand.\nThat Church was founded by a Hebrew, and the magnetic influence\nlingers. But you will go to the fountain head. Theology requires an\napprenticeship of some thousand years at least; to say nothing of clime\nand race. You cannot get on with theology as you do with chemistry and\nmechanics. Trust me, there is something deeper in it. I shall give you\na note to Lara; cultivate him, he is the man you want. You will want\nothers; they will come; but Lara has the first key.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I am sorry to trouble you about such things,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Tancred, in a\nhesitating voice, \u00e2\u0080\u0098but perhaps I may not have the great pleasure to see\nyou again, and Lord Eskdale said that I was to speak to you about some\nletters of credit.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Oh! we shall meet before you go. But what you say reminds me of\nsomething. As for money, there is only one banker in Syria; he is\neverywhere, at Aleppo, Damascus, Beiroot, Jerusalem. It is Besso. Before\nthe expulsion of the Egyptians, he really ruled Syria, but he is still\npowerful, though they have endeavoured to crush him at Constantinople. I\napplied to Metternich about him, and, besides that, he is mine.\n\nI shall give you a letter to him, but not merely for your money affairs.\nI wish you to know him. He lives in splendour at Damascus, moderately\nat Jerusalem, where there is little to do, but which he loves as a\nresidence, being a Hebrew. I wish you to know him. You will, I am sure,\nagree with me, that he is, without exception, the most splendid specimen\nof the animal man you ever became acquainted with. His name is Adam, and\nverily he looks as if he were in the garden of Eden before the fall. But\nhis soul is as grand and as fine as his body. You will lean upon this\nman as you would on a faithful charger. His divan is charming; you will\nalways find there the most intelligent people. You must learn to smoke.\nThere is nothing that Besso cannot do; make him do everything you want;\nhave no scruples; he will be gratified. Besides, he is one of those who\nkiss my signet. These two letters will open Syria to you, and any other\nland, if you care to proceed. Give yourself no trouble about any other\npreparations.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098And how am I to thank you?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Tancred, rising; \u00e2\u0080\u0098and how am I to\nexpress to you all my gratitude?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098What are you going to do with yourself to-morrow?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Sidonia. \u00e2\u0080\u0098I\nnever go anywhere; but I have a few friends who are so kind as to\ncome sometimes to me. There are two or three persons dining with me\nto-morrow, whom you might like to meet. Will you do so?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I shall be most proud and pleased.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s well. It is not here; it is in Carlton Gardens; at sunset.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 And\nSidonia continued the letter which he was writing when Tancred entered.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII.\n\n     _An Interesting Rencontre_\n\nWHEN Tancred returned home, musing, from a visit to Sidonia, he found\nthe following note:\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Lady Bertie and Bellair returns Lord Montacute his carriage with a\nthousand compliments and thanks. She fears she greatly incommoded\nLord Montacute, but begs to assure him how very sensible she is of his\nconsiderate courtesy.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Upper Brook Street, Wednesday.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\nThe handwriting was of that form of scripture which attracts; refined\nyet energetic; full of character. Tancred recognised the titles of\nBertie and Bellair as those of two not inconsiderable earldoms, now\ncentred in the same individual. Lady Bertie and Bellair was herself\na lady of the high nobility; a daughter of the present Duke of\nFitz-Aquitaine; the son of that duke who was the father-in-law of Lord\nde Mowbray, and whom Lady Firebrace, the present Lady Bardolf, and\nTadpole, had dexterously converted to conservatism by persuading him\nthat he was to be Sir Robert\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Irish viceroy. Lady Bertie and Bellair,\ntherefore, was first-cousin to Lady Joan Mountchesney, and her sister,\nwho is still Lady Maud Fitz-Warene. Tancred was surprised that he never\nrecollected to have met before one so distinguished and so beautiful.\nHis conversation with Sidonia, however, had driven the little adventure\nof the morning from his memory, and now that it was thus recalled to\nhim, he did not dwell upon it. His being was absorbed in his paramount\npurpose. The sympathy of Sidonia, so complete, and as instructive as it\nwas animating, was a sustaining power which we often need when we are\nmeditating great deeds. How often, when all seems dark, and hopeless,\nand spiritless, and tame, when slight obstacles figure in the cloudy\nlandscape as Alps, and the rushing cataracts of our invention have\nsubsided into drizzle, a single phrase of a great man instantaneously\nflings sunshine on the intellectual landscape, and the habitual\nfeatures of power and beauty, over which we have so long mused in secret\nconfidence and love, resume all their energy and lustre.\n\nThe haunting thought that occasionally, notwithstanding his strong will,\nwould perplex the soul and agitate the heart of Tancred; the haunting\nthought that, all this time, he was perhaps the dupe of boyish\nfantasies, was laid to-day. Sometimes he had felt, Why does no one\nsympathise with my views; why, though they treat them with conventional\nrespect, is it clear that all I have addressed hold them to be absurd?\nMy parents are pious and instructed; they are predisposed to view\neverything I say, or do, or think, with an even excessive favour.\nThey think me moonstruck. Lord Eskdale is a perfect man of the world;\nproverbially shrewd, and celebrated for his judgment; he looks upon me\nas a raw boy, and believes that, if my father had kept me at Eton and\nsent me to Paris, I should by this time have exhausted my crudities. The\nbishop is what the world calls a great scholar; he is a statesman\nwho, aloof from faction, ought to be accustomed to take just and\ncomprehensive views; and a priest who ought to be under the immediate\ninfluence of the Holy Spirit. He says I am a visionary. All this might\nwell be disheartening; but now comes one whom no circumstances impel to\njudge my project with indulgence; who would, at the first glance, appear\nto have many prejudices arrayed against it, who knows more of the world\nthan Lord Eskdale, and who appears to me to be more learned than\nthe whole bench of bishops, and he welcomes my ideas, approves my\nconclusions, sympathises with my suggestions; develops, illustrates,\nenforces them; plainly intimates that I am only on the threshold of\ninitiation, and would aid me to advance to the innermost mysteries.\n\nThere was this night a great ball at Lady Bardolfs, in Belgrave Square.\nOne should generally mention localities, because very often they\nindicate character. Lady Bardolf lived next door to Mrs. Guy Flouncey.\nBoth had risen in the world, though it requires some esoteric knowledge\nto recognise the patrician par-venue; and both had finally settled\nthemselves down in the only quarter which Lady Bardolf thought worthy of\nher new coronet, and Mrs. Guy Flouncey of her new visiting list.\n\nLady Bardolf had given up the old family mansion of the Firebraces in\nHanover Square, at the same time that she had resigned their old title.\nPolitics being dead, in consequence of the majority of 1841, who, after\na little kicking for the million, satisfactorily assured the minister\nthat there was no vice in them.\n\nLady Bardolf had chalked out a new career, and one of a still more\neminent and exciting character than her previous pursuit. Lady Bardolf\nwas one of those ladies--there are several--who entertain the curious\nidea that they need only to be known in certain high quarters to be\nimmediately selected as the principal objects of court favour. Lady\nBardolf was always putting herself in the way of it; she never lost an\nopportunity; she never missed a drawing-room, contrived to be at all the\ncourt balls, plotted to be invited to a costume f\u00c3\u00aate, and expended the\ntactics of a campaign to get asked to some grand ch\u00c3\u00a2teau honoured by\naugust presence. Still Her Majesty had not yet sent for Lady Bardolf.\nShe was still very good friends with Lord Masque, for he had social\ninfluence, and could assist her; but as for poor Tadpole, she had sadly\nneglected him, his sphere being merely political, and that being no\nlonger interesting. The honest gentleman still occasionally buzzed about\nher, slavering portentous stories about malcontent country gentlemen,\nmumbling Maynooth, and shaking his head at Young England. Tadpole was\nwont to say in confidence, that for his part he wished Sir Robert had\nleft alone religion and commerce, and confined himself to finance, which\nwas his forte as long as he had a majority to carry the projects which\nhe found in the pigeon-holes of the Treasury, and which are always at\nthe service of every minister.\n\nWell, it was at Lady Bardolfs ball, close upon midnight, that Tancred,\nwho had not long entered, and had not very far advanced in the crowded\nsaloons, turning his head, recognised his heroine of the morning,\nhis still more recent correspondent, Lady Bertie and Bellair. She was\nspeaking to Lord Valentine. It was impossible to mistake her; rapid as\nhad been his former observation of her face, it was too remarkable to\nbe forgotten, though the captivating details were only the result of his\npresent more advantageous inspection. A small head and large dark eyes,\ndark as her rich hair which was quite unadorned, a pale but delicate\ncomplexion, small pearly teeth, were charms that crowned a figure rather\ntoo much above the middle height, yet undulating and not without grace.\nHer countenance was calm without being grave; she smiled with her eyes.\n\nShe was for a moment alone; she looked round, and recognised Tancred;\nshe bowed to him with a beaming glance. Instantly he was at her side.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Our second meeting to-day,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 she said, in a low, sweet voice.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098How came it that we never met before?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he replied.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I have just returned from Paris; the first time I have been out;\nand, had it not been for you,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 she added, \u00e2\u0080\u0098I should not have been here\nto-night. I think they would have put me in prison.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Lady Bardolf ought to be very much obliged to me, and so ought the\nworld.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I am,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Lady Bertie and Bellair.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098That is worth everything else,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Tancred.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098What a pretty carriage you have! I do not think I shall ever get into\nmine again. I am almost glad they have destroyed my chariot. I am sure I\nshall never be able to drive in anything else now except a brougham.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Why did you not keep mine?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098You are magnificent; too gorgeous and oriental for these cold climes.\nYou shower your presents as if you were in the East, which Lord\nValentine tells me you are about to visit. When do you leave us?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I think of going immediately.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Indeed!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Lady Bertie and Bellair, and her countenance changed.\nThere was a pause, and then she continued playfully, yet as it were half\nin sadness, \u00e2\u0080\u0098I almost wish you had not come to my rescue this morning.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098And why?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 \u00e2\u0080\u0098Because I do not like to make agreeable acquaintances only\nto lose them.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I think that I am most to be pitied,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Tancred.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098You are wearied of the world very soon. Before you can know us, you\nleave us.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I am not wearied of the world, for indeed, as you say, I know nothing\nof it. I am here by accident, as you were in the stoppage to-day. It\nwill disperse, and then I shall get on.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Lord Valentine tells me that you are going to realise my dream of\ndreams, that you are going to Jerusalem.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Ah!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Tancred, kindling, \u00e2\u0080\u0098you too have felt that want?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098But I never can pardon myself for not having satisfied it,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Lady\nBertie and Bellair in a mournful tone, and looking in his face with her\nbeautiful dark eyes. \u00e2\u0080\u0098It is the mistake of my life, and now can never be\nremedied. But I have no energy. I ought, as a girl, when they opposed\nmy purpose, to have taken up my palmer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s staff, and never have rested\ncontent till I had gathered my shell on the strand of Joppa.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098It is the right feeling\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Tancred. \u00e2\u0080\u0098I am persuaded we ought all to\ngo.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098But we remain here,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said the lady, in a tone of suppressed and elegant\nanguish; \u00e2\u0080\u0098here, where we all complain of our hopeless lives; with not\na thought beyond the passing hour, yet all bewailing its wearisome and\ninsipid moments.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Our lot is cast in a material age,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Tancred.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098The spiritual can alone satisfy me,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Lady Bertie and Bellair.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Because you have a soul,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 continued Tancred, with animation, \u00e2\u0080\u0098still\nof a celestial hue. They are rare in the nineteenth century. Nobody now\nthinks about heaven. They never dream of angels. All their existence is\nconcentrated in steamboats and railways.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098You are right,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said the lady, earnestly; \u00e2\u0080\u0098and you fly from it.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I go for other purposes; I would say even higher ones,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Tancred.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I can understand you; your feelings are my own. Jerusalem has been\nthe dream of my life. I have always been endeavouring to reach it, but\nsomehow or other I never got further than Paris.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098And yet it is very easy now to get to Jerusalem,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Tancred; \u00e2\u0080\u0098the\ngreat difficulty, as a very remarkable man said to me this morning, is\nto know what to do when you are there.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Who said that to you?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 inquired Lady Bertie and Bellair, bending her\nhead.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098It was the person I was going to call upon when I met you; Monsieur de\nSidonia.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Monsieur de Sidonia!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said the lady, with animation. \u00e2\u0080\u0098Ah! you know\nhim?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Not as much as I could wish. I saw him to-day for the first time. My\ncousin, Lord Eskdale, gave me a letter of introduction to him, for\nhis advice and assistance about my journey. Sidonia has been a great\ntraveller.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098There is no person I wish to know so much as M. de Sidonia,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Lady\nBertie and Bellair. \u00e2\u0080\u0098He is a great friend of Lord Eskdale, I think?\nI must get Lord Eskdale,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 she added, musingly, \u00e2\u0080\u0098to give me a little\ndinner, and ask M. de Sidonia to meet me.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098He never goes anywhere; at least I have heard so,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Tancred.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098He once used to do, and to give us great f\u00c3\u00aates. I remember hearing of\nthem before I was out. We must make him resume them. He is immensely\nrich.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I dare say he may be,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Tancred. \u00e2\u0080\u0098I wonder how a man with his\nintellect and ideas can think of the accumulation of wealth.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098\u00e2\u0080\u0099Tis his destiny,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Lady Bertie and Bellair. \u00e2\u0080\u0098He can no more\ndisembarrass himself of his hereditary millions than a dynasty of the\ncares of empire. I wonder if he will get the Great Northern. They talked\nof nothing else at Paris.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Of what?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Tancred.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Oh! let us talk of Jerusalem!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Lady Bertie and Bellair. \u00e2\u0080\u0098Ah, here\nis Augustus! Let me make you and my husband acquainted.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nTancred almost expected to see the moustached companion of the\nmorning, but it was not so. Lord Bertie and Bellair was a tall, thin,\ndistinguished, withered-looking young man, who thanked Tancred for his\ncourtesy of the morning with a sort of gracious negligence, and, after\nsome easy talk, asked Tancred to dine with them on the morrow. He was\nengaged, but he promised to call on Lady Bertie and Bellair immediately,\nand see some drawings of the Holy Land.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX.\n\n     _Lord Henry Sympathises_\n\nPASSING through a marble antechamber, Tancred was ushered into an\napartment half saloon and half-library; the choicely-bound volumes,\nwhich were not too numerous, were ranged on shelves inlaid in the walls,\nso that they ornamented, without diminishing, the apartment. These walls\nwere painted in encaustic, corresponding with the coved ceiling, which\nwas richly adorned in the same fashion. A curtain of violet velvet,\ncovering if necessary the large window, which looked upon a balcony full\nof flowers, and the umbrageous Park; an Axminster carpet, manufactured\nto harmonise both in colour and design with the rest of the chamber; a\nprofusion of luxurious seats; a large table of ivory marquetry, bearing\na carved silver bell which once belonged to a pope; a Naiad, whose\ngolden urn served as an inkstand; some daggers that acted as paper\ncutters, and some French books just arrived; a group of beautiful\nvases recently released from an Egyptian tomb and ranged on a tripod of\nmalachite: the portrait of a statesman, and the bust of an emperor,\nand a sparkling fire, were all circumstances which made the room both\ninteresting and comfortable in which Sidonia welcomed Tancred and\nintroduced him to a guest who had preceded him, Lord Henry Sydney.\n\nIt was a name that touched Tancred, as it has all the youth of England,\nsignificant of a career that would rescue public life from that strange\nunion of lax principles and contracted sympathies which now form the\nspecial and degrading features of British politics. It was borne by one\nwhose boyhood we have painted amid the fields and schools of Eton, and\nthe springtime of whose earliest youth we traced by the sedgy waters\nof the Cam. We left him on the threshold of public life; and, in four\nyears, Lord Henry had created that reputation which now made him a\nsource of hope and solace to millions of his countrymen. But they were\nfour years of labour which outweighed the usual exertions of public men\nin double that space. His regular attendance in the House of Commons\nalone had given him as much Parliamentary experience as fell to the\nlot of many of those who had been first returned in 1837, and had been,\ntherefore, twice as long in the House. He was not only a vigilant member\nof public and private committees, but had succeeded in appointing and\nconducting several on topics which he esteemed of high importance. Add\nto this, that he took an habitual part in debate, and was a frequent\nand effective public writer; and we are furnished with an additional\ntestimony, if that indeed were wanting, that there is no incentive\nto exertion like the passion for a noble renown. Nor should it be\nforgotten, that, in all he accomplished, he had but one final purpose,\nand that the highest. The debate, the committee, the article in the\nJournal or the Review, the public meeting, the private research, these\nwere all means to advance that which he had proposed as the object of\nhis public life, namely, to elevate the condition of the people.\n\nAlthough there was no public man whose powers had more rapidly ripened,\nstill it was interesting to observe that their maturity had been\nfaithful to the healthy sympathies of his earlier years. The boy, whom\nwe have traced intent upon the revival of the pastimes of the people,\nhad expanded into the statesman, who, in a profound and comprehensive\ninvestigation of the elements of public wealth, had shown that a jaded\npopulation is not a source of national prosperity. What had been a\npicturesque emotion had now become a statistical argument. The material\nsystem that proposes the supply of constant toil to a people as the\nperfection of polity, had received a staggering blow from the exertions\nof a young patrician, who announced his belief that labour had its\nrights as well as its duties. What was excellent about Lord Henry\nwas, that he was not a mere philanthropist, satisfied to rouse public\nattention to a great social evil, or instantly to suggest for it some\ncrude remedy.\n\nA scholar and a man of the world, learned in history and not\ninexperienced in human nature, he was sensible that we must look to the\nconstituent principles of society for the causes and the cures of great\nnational disorders. He therefore went deeply into the question, nor\nshrank from investigating how far those disorders were produced by the\noperation or the desuetude of ancient institutions, and how far it might\nbe necessary to call new influences into political existence for\ntheir remedy. Richly informed, still studious, fond of labour and\nindefatigable, of a gentle disposition though of an ardent mind, calm\nyet energetic, very open to conviction, but possessing an inflexibility\namounting even to obstinacy when his course was once taken, a ready and\nimproving speaker, an apt and attractive writer, affable and sincere,\nand with the undesigning faculty of making friends, Lord Henry seemed\nto possess all the qualities of a popular leader, if we add to them\nthe golden ones: high lineage, an engaging appearance, youth, and a\ntemperament in which the reason had not been developed to the prejudice\nof the heart.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098And when do you start for the Holy Land?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Lord Henry to Tancred,\nin a tone and with a countenance which proved his sympathy.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I have clutched my staff, but the caravan lingers.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I envy you!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Why do you not go?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nLord Henry slightly shrugged his shoulders, and said, \u00e2\u0080\u0098It is too late. I\nhave begun my work and I cannot leave it.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098If a Parliamentary career could save this country,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Tancred, \u00e2\u0080\u0098I\nam sure you would be a public benefactor. I have observed what you and\nMr. Con-ingsby and some of your friends have done and said, with great\ninterest. But Parliament seems to me to be the very place which a man\nof action should avoid. A Parliamentary career, that old superstition of\nthe eighteenth century, was important when there were no other sources\nof power and fame. An aristocracy at the head of a people whom they had\nplundered of their means of education, required some cultivated tribunal\nwhose sympathy might stimulate their intelligence and satisfy their\nvanity. Parliament was never so great as when they debated with closed\ndoors. The public opinion, of which they never dreamed, has superseded\nthe rhetorical club of our great-grandfathers. They know this well\nenough, and try to maintain their unnecessary position by affecting\nthe character of men of business, but amateur men of business are very\ncostly conveniences. In this age it is not Parliament that does the real\nwork. It does not govern Ireland, for example. If the manufacturers want\nto change a tariff, they form a commercial league, and they effect their\npurpose. It is the same with the abolition of slavery, and all our great\nrevolutions. Parliament has become as really insignificant as for two\ncenturies it has kept the monarch. O\u00e2\u0080\u0099Connell has taken a good share of\nits power; Cobden has taken another; and I am inclined to believe,\u00e2\u0080\u0099\nsaid Tancred, \u00e2\u0080\u0098though I care little about it, that, if our order had\nany spirit or prescience, they would put themselves at the head of the\npeople, and take the rest.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Coningsby dines here to-day,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Sidonia, who, unobserved, had\nwatched Tancred as he spoke, with a searching glance.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Notwithstanding what you say,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Lord Henry, smiling, \u00e2\u0080\u0098I wish I\ncould induce you to remain and help us. You would be a great ally.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I go to a land,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Tancred, \u00e2\u0080\u0098that has never been blessed by that\nfatal drollery called a representative government, though Omniscience\nonce deigned to trace out the polity which should rule it.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nAt this moment the servant announced Lord and Lady Marney.\n\nPolitical sympathy had created a close intimacy between Lord Marney\nand Coningsby. They were necessary to each other. They were both men\nentirely devoted to public affairs, and sitting in different Houses,\nboth young, and both masters of fortunes of the first class, they were\nindicated as individuals who hereafter might take a lead, and, far\nfrom clashing, would co-operate with each other. Through Coningsby\nthe Marneys had become acquainted with Sidonia, who liked them both,\nparticularly Sybil. Although received by society with open arms,\nespecially by the high nobility, who affected to look upon Sybil quite\nas one of themselves, Lady Marney, notwithstanding the homage that\neverywhere awaited her, had already shown a disposition to retire as\nmuch as possible within the precinct of a chosen circle.\n\nThis was her second season, and Sybil ventured to think that she had\nmade, in the general gaieties of her first, a sufficient oblation to\nthe genius of fashion, and the immediate requirements of her social\nposition. Her life was faithful to its first impulse. Devoted to the\nimprovement of the condition of the people, she was the moving spring\nof the charitable development of this great city. Her house, without any\npedantic effort, had become the focus of a refined society, who, though\nobliged to show themselves for the moment in the great carnival,\nwear their masks, blow their trumpets, and pelt the multitude with\nsugarplums, were glad to find a place where they could at all times\ndivest themselves of their mummery, and return to their accustomed garb\nof propriety and good taste.\n\nSybil, too, felt alone in the world. Without a relation, without an\nacquaintance of early and other days, she clung to her husband with a\ndevotion which was peculiar as well as profound. Egremont was to her\nmore than a husband and a lover; he was her only friend; it seemed to\nSybil that he could be her only friend. The disposition of Lord Marney\nwas not opposed to the habits of his wife. Men, when they are married,\noften shrink from the glare and bustle of those social multitudes which\nare entered by bachelors with the excitement of knights-errant in a\nfairy wilderness, because they are supposed to be rife with adventures,\nand, perhaps, fruitful of a heroine. The adventure sometimes turns out\nto be a catastrophe, and the heroine a copy instead of an original; but\nlet that pass.\n\nLord Marney liked to be surrounded by those who sympathised with his\npursuit; and his pursuit was politics, and politics on a great scale.\nThe commonplace career of official distinction was at his command. A\ngreat peer, with abilities and ambition, a good speaker, supposed to be\na Conservative, he might soon have found his way into the cabinet,\nand, like the rest, have assisted in registering the decrees of one\ntoo powerful individual. But Lord Marney had been taught to think at\na period of life when he little dreamed of the responsibility which\nfortune had in store for him.\n\nThe change in his position had not altered the conclusions at which\nhe had previously arrived. He held that the state of England,\nnotwithstanding the superficies of a material prosperity, was one of\nimpending doom, unless it were timely arrested by those who were in high\nplaces. A man of fine mind rather than of brilliant talents, Lord Marney\nfound, in the more vivid and impassioned intelligence of Coningsby, the\ndirecting sympathy which he required. Tadpole looked upon his lordship\nas little short of insane. \u00e2\u0080\u0098Do you see that man?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he would say as Lord\nMarney rode by. \u00e2\u0080\u0098He might be Privy Seal, and he throws it all away for\nthe nonsense of Young England!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nMrs. Coningsby entered the room almost on the footsteps of the Marneys.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I am in despair about Harry,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 she said, as she gave a finger to\nSidonia, \u00e2\u0080\u0098but he told me not to wait for him later than eight. I suppose\nhe is kept at the House. Do you know anything of him, Lord Henry?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098You may make yourself quite easy about him,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Lord Henry. \u00e2\u0080\u0098He\npromised Vavasour to support a motion which he has to-day, and perhaps\nspeak on it. I ought to be there too, but Charles Buller told me there\nwould certainly be no division and so I ventured to pair off with him.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098He will come with Vavasour,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Sidonia, \u00e2\u0080\u0098who makes up our party.\nThey will be here before we have seated ourselves.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nThe gentlemen had exchanged the usual inquiry, whether there was\nanything new to-day, without waiting for the answer. Sidonia introduced\nTancred and Lord Marney.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098And what have you been doing to-day?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Edith to Sybil, by whose\nside she had seated herself. \u00e2\u0080\u0098Lady Bardolf did nothing last night but\ngronder me, because you never go to her parties. In vain I said that you\nlooked upon her as the most odious of her sex, and her balls the pest of\nsociety. She was not in the least satisfied. And how is Gerard?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Why, we really have been very uneasy about him,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Lady Marney, \u00e2\u0080\u0098but\nthe last bulletin,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 she added, with a smile, \u00e2\u0080\u0098announces a tooth.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Next year you must give him a pony, and let him ride with my Harry;\nI mean my little Harry, Harry of Monmouth I call him; he is so like a\nportrait Mr. Coningsby has of his grandfather, the same debauched look.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Your dinner is served, sir!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nSidonia offered his hand to Lady Marney; Edith was attended by Tancred.\nA door at the end of the room opened into a marble corridor, which led\nto the dining-room, decorated in the same style as the library. It was\na suite of apartments which Sidonia used for an intimate circle like the\npresent.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX.\n\n     _A Modern Troubadour_\n\nTHEY seated themselves at a round table, on which everything seemed\nbrilliant and sparkling; nothing heavy, nothing oppressive. There\nwas scarcely anything that Sidonia disliked so much as a small table,\ngroaning, as it is aptly termed, with plate. He shrunk from great masses\nof gold and silver; gigantic groups, colossal shields, and mobs of\ntankards and flagons; and never used them except on great occasions,\nwhen the banquet assumes an Egyptian character, and becomes too vast\nfor refinement. At present, the dinner was served on S\u00c3\u00a8vres porcelain of\nRose du Barri, raised on airy golden stands of arabesque workmanship;\na mule bore your panniers of salt, or a sea-nymph proffered it you on\na shell just fresh from the ocean, or you found it in a bird\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nest; by\nevery guest a different pattern. In the centre of the table, mounted on\na pedestal, was a group of pages in Dresden china. Nothing could be\nmore gay than their bright cloaks and flowing plumes, more elaborately\nexquisite than their laced shirts and rosettes, or more fantastically\nsaucy than their pretty affected faces, as each, with extended arm, held\na light to a guest. The room was otherwise illumined from the sides.\n\nThe guests had scarcely seated themselves when the two absent ones\narrived.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Well, you did not divide, Vavasour,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Lord Henry.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Did I not?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Vavasour; \u00e2\u0080\u0098and nearly beat the Government. You are a\npretty fellow!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I was paired.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098With some one who could not stay. Your brother, Mrs. Coningsby, behaved\nlike a man, sacrificed his dinner, and made a capital speech.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Oh! Oswald, did he speak? Did you speak, Harry?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098No; I voted. There was too much speaking as it was; if Vavasour had not\nreplied, I believe we should have won.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098But then, my dear fellow, think of my points; think how they laid\nthemselves open!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098A majority is always the best repartee,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Coningsby.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I have been talking with Montacute,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 whispered Lord Henry to Coningsby,\nwho was seated next to him. \u00e2\u0080\u0098Wonderful fellow! You can conceive nothing\nricher! Very wild, but all the right ideas; exaggerated of course. You\nmust get hold of him after dinner.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098But they say he is going to Jerusalem.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098But he will return.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I do not know that; even Napoleon regretted that he had ever re-crossed\nthe Mediterranean. The East is a career.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nMr. Vavasour was a social favourite; a poet and a real poet, and\na troubadour, as well as a member of Parliament; travelled,\nsweet-tempered, and good-hearted; amusing and clever. With catholic\nsympathies and an eclectic turn of mind, Mr. Vavasour saw something good\nin everybody and everything, which is certainly amiable, and perhaps\njust, but disqualifies a man in some degree for the business of life,\nwhich requires for its conduct a certain degree of prejudice. Mr.\nVavasour\u00e2\u0080\u0099s breakfasts were renowned. Whatever your creed, class, or\ncountry, one might almost add your character, you were a welcome guest\nat his matutinal meal, provided you were celebrated. That qualification,\nhowever, was rigidly enforced.\n\nIt not rarely happened that never were men more incongruously grouped.\nIndividuals met at his hospitable house who had never met before, but\nwho for years had been cherishing in solitude mutual detestation, with\nall the irritable exaggeration of the literary character. Vavasour liked\nto be the Amphitryon of a cluster of personal enemies. He prided himself\non figuring as the social medium by which rival reputations became\nacquainted, and paid each other in his presence the compliments which\nveiled their ineffable disgust. All this was very well at his rooms in\nthe Albany, and only funny; but when he collected his menageries at his\nancestral hall in a distant county, the sport sometimes became tragic.\n\nA real philosopher, alike from his genial disposition and from the\ninfluence of his rich and various information, Vavasour moved amid\nthe strife, sympathising with every one; and perhaps, after all, the\nphilanthropy which was his boast was not untinged by a dash of humour,\nof which rare and charming quality he possessed no inconsiderable\nportion. Vavasour liked to know everybody who was known, and to see\neverything which ought to be seen. He also was of opinion that everybody\nwho was known ought to know him; and that the spectacle, however\nsplendid or exciting, was not quite perfect without his presence.\n\nHis life was a gyration of energetic curiosity; an insatiable whirl of\nsocial celebrity. There was not a congregation of sages and philosophers\nin any part of Europe which he did not attend as a brother. He was\npresent at the camp of Kalisch in his yeomanry uniform, and assisted at\nthe festivals of Barcelona in an Andalusian jacket. He was everywhere,\nand at everything; he had gone down in a diving-bell and gone up in a\nballoon. As for his acquaintances, he was welcomed in every land; his\nuniversal sympathies seemed omnipotent. Emperor and king, jacobin and\ncarbonaro, alike cherished him. He was the steward of Polish balls and\nthe vindicator of Russian humanity; he dined with Louis Philippe, and\ngave dinners to Louis Blanc.\n\nThis was a dinner of which the guests came to partake. Though they\ndelighted in each other\u00e2\u0080\u0099s society, their meetings were not so rare that\nthey need sacrifice the elegant pleasures of a refined meal for the\nopportunity of conversation. They let that take its chance, and ate\nand drank without affectation. Nothing so rare as a female dinner where\npeople eat, and few things more delightful. On the present occasion some\ntime elapsed, while the admirable performances of Sidonia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cook were\ndiscussed, with little interruption; a burst now and then from the\nringing voice of Mrs. Coningsby crossing a lance with her habitual\nopponent, Mr. Vavasour, who, however, generally withdrew from the\nskirmish when a fresh dish was handed to him.\n\nAt length, the second course being served, Mrs. Coningsby said, \u00e2\u0080\u0098I think\nyou have all eaten enough: I have a piece of information for you. There\nis going to be a costume ball at the Palace.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nThis announcement produced a number of simultaneous remarks and\nexclamations. \u00e2\u0080\u0098When was it to be? What was it to be? An age, or a\ncountry; or an olio of all ages and all countries?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098An age is a masquerade,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Sidonia. \u00e2\u0080\u0098The more contracted the circle,\nthe more perfect the illusion.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Oh, no!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Vavasour, shaking his head. \u00e2\u0080\u0098An age is the thing; it is a\nmuch higher thing. What can be finer than to represent the spirit of an\nage?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098And Mr. Vavasour to perform the principal part,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Mrs. Coningsby.\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I know exactly what he means. He wants to dance the polka as Petrarch,\nand find a Laura in every partner.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098You have no poetical feeling,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Mr. Vavasour, waving his hand. \u00e2\u0080\u0098I\nhave often told you so.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098You will easily find Lauras, Mr. Vavasour, if you often write such\nbeautiful verses as I have been reading to-day,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Lady Marney.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098You, on the contrary,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Mr. Vavasour, bowing, \u00e2\u0080\u0098have a great deal of\npoetic feeling, Lady Marney; I have always said so.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098But give us your news, Edith,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Coningsby. \u00e2\u0080\u0098Imagine our suspense,\nwhen it is a question, whether we are all to look picturesque or\nquizzical.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Ah, you want to know whether you can go as Cardinal Mazarin, or the\nDuke of Ripperda, Harry. I know exactly what you all are now thinking\nof; whether you will draw the prize in the forthcoming lottery, and get\nexactly the epoch and the character which suit you. Is it not so, Lord\nMontacute? Would not you like to practise a little with your crusados at\nthe Queen\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ball before you go to the Holy Sepulchre?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I would rather hear your description of it,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Tancred.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Lord Henry, I see, is half inclined to be your companion as a Red-cross\nKnight,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 continued Edith. \u00e2\u0080\u0098As for Lady Marney, she is the successor\nof Mrs. Fry, and would wish, I am sure, to go to the ball as her\nrepresentative.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098And pray what are you thinking of being?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Mr. Vavasour. \u00e2\u0080\u0098We\nshould like very much to be favoured with Mrs. Coningsby\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ideal of\nherself.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Mrs. Coningsby leaves the ideal to poets. She is quite satisfied to\nremain what she is, and it is her intention to do so, though she means\nto go to Her Majesty\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ball.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I see that you are in the secret,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Lord Marney.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098If I could only keep secrets, I might turn out something.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Mrs.\nConingsby. \u00e2\u0080\u0098I am the depositary of so much that is occult-joys, sorrows,\nplots, and scrapes; but I always tell Harry, and he always betrays me.\nWell, you must guess a little. Lady Marney begins.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Well, we were at one at Turin,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Lady Marney, \u00e2\u0080\u0098and it was oriental,\nLalla Rookh. Are you to be a sultana?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nMrs. Coningsby shook her head.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Come, Edith,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said her husband; \u00e2\u0080\u0098if you know, which I doubt----\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Oh! you doubt----\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Valentine told me yesterday,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Mr. Vavasour, in a mock peremptory\ntone, \u00e2\u0080\u0098that there would not be a ball.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098And Lord Valentine told me yesterday that there would be a ball, and\nwhat the ball would be; and what is more, I have fixed on my dress,\u00e2\u0080\u0099\nsaid Mrs. Coningsby.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Such a rapid decision proves that much antiquarian research is not\nnecessary,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Sidonia. \u00e2\u0080\u0098Your period is modern.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Ah!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Edith, looking at Sidonia, \u00e2\u0080\u0098he always finds me out. Well, Mr.\nVavasour, you will not be able to crown yourself with a laurel wreath,\nfor the gentlemen will wear wigs.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Louis Quatorze?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said her husband. \u00e2\u0080\u0098Peel as Louvois.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098No, Sir Robert would be content with nothing less than _Le\nGrand Colbert, rue Richelieu, No. 75, grand magasin de nouveaut\u00c3\u00a9s\ntr\u00c3\u00a8s-anciennes: prix fix\u00c3\u00a9, avec quelques rabais._\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098A description of Conservatism,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Coningsby.\n\nThe secret was soon revealed: every one had a conjecture and a\ncommentary: gentlemen in wigs, and ladies powdered, patched, and sacked.\nVavasour pondered somewhat dolefully on the anti-poetic spirit of the\nage; Coningsby hailed him as the author of Leonidas.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098And you, I suppose, will figure as one of the \u00e2\u0080\u009cboys\u00e2\u0080\u009d arrayed against\nthe great Sir Robert?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Mr. Vavasour, with a countenance of mock\nveneration for that eminent personage.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098The \u00e2\u0080\u009cboys\u00e2\u0080\u009d beat him at last,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Coningsby; and then, with a rapid\nprecision and a richness of colouring which were peculiar to him, he\nthrew out a sketch which placed the period before them; and they\nbegan to tear it to tatters, select the incidents, and apportion the\ncharacters.\n\nTwo things which are necessary to a perfect dinner are noiseless\nattendants, and a precision in serving the various dishes of each\ncourse, so that they may all be placed upon the table at the same\nmoment. A deficiency in these respects produces that bustle and delay\nwhich distract many an agreeable conversation and spoil many a pleasant\ndish. These two excellent characteristics were never wanting at the\ndinners of Sidonia. At no house was there less parade. The appearance\nof the table changed as if by the waving of a wand, and silently as a\ndream. And at this moment, the dessert being arranged, fruits and their\nbeautiful companions, flowers, reposed in alabaster baskets raised on\nsilver stands of filigree work.\n\nThere was half an hour of merry talk, graceful and gay: a good story,\na _bon-mot_ fresh from the mint, some raillery like summer lightning,\nvivid but not scorching.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098And now,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Edith, as the ladies rose to return to the library,\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098and now we leave you to Maynooth.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098By-the-bye, what do they say to it in your House, Lord Marney?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\ninquired Henry Sydney, filling his glass.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098It will go down,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Lord Marney. \u00e2\u0080\u0098A strong dose for some, but they\nare used to potent potions.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098The bishops, they say, have not made up their minds.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Fancy bishops not having made up their minds,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 exclaimed Tancred: \u00e2\u0080\u0098the\nonly persons who ought never to doubt.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Except when they are offered a bishopric,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Lord Marney.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Why I like this Maynooth project,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Tancred, \u00e2\u0080\u0098though otherwise it\nlittle interests me, is, that all the shopkeepers are against it.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t tell that to the minister,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Coningsby, \u00e2\u0080\u0098or he will give up\nthe measure.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Well, that is the very reason,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Vavasour, \u00e2\u0080\u0098why, though otherwise\ninclined to the grant, I hesitate as to my vote. I have the highest\nopinion of the shopkeepers; I sympathise even with their prejudices.\nThey are the class of the age; they represent its order, its decency,\nits industry.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098And you represent them,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Coningsby. \u00e2\u0080\u0098Vavasour is the quintessence\nof order, decency, and industry.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098You may jest,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Vavasour, shaking his head with a spice of solemn\ndrollery; \u00e2\u0080\u0098but public opinion must and ought to be respected, right or\nwrong.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098What do you mean by public opinion?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Tancred.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098The opinion of the reflecting majority,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Vavasour.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Those who don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t read your poems,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Coningsby.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Boy, boy!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Vavasour, who could endure raillery from one he\nhad been at college with, but who was not over-pleased at Coningsby\nselecting the present occasion to claim his franchise, when a new man\nwas present like Lord Montacute, on whom Vavasour naturally wished to\nproduce an impression. It must be owned that it was not, as they say,\nvery good taste in the husband of Edith, but prosperity had developed in\nConingsby a native vein of sauciness which it required all the solemnity\nof the senate to repress. Indeed, even there, upon the benches, with\na grave face, he often indulged in quips and cranks that convulsed\nhis neighbouring audience, who often, amid the long dreary nights of\nstatistical imposture, sought refuge in his gay sarcasms, his airy\npersonalities, and happy quotations.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I do not see how there can be opinion without thought,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Tancred;\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098and I do not believe the public ever think. How can they? They have no\ntime. Certainly we live at present under the empire of general ideas,\nwhich are extremely powerful. But the public have not invented those\nideas. They have adopted them from convenience. No one has confidence in\nhimself; on the contrary, every one has a mean idea of his own strength\nand has no reliance on his own judgment. Men obey a general impulse,\nthey bow before an external necessity, whether for resistance or action.\nIndividuality is dead; there is a want of inward and personal energy\nin man; and that is what people feel and mean when they go about\ncomplaining there is no faith.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098You would hold, then,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Henry Sydney, \u00e2\u0080\u0098that the progress of public\nliberty marches with the decay of personal greatness?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098It would seem so.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098But the majority will always prefer public liberty to personal\ngreatness,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Lord Marney.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098But, without personal greatness, you never would have had public\nliberty,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Coningsby.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098After all, it is civilisation that you are kicking against,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said\nVavasour.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I do not understand what you mean by civilisation,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Tancred.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098The progressive development of the faculties of man,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Vavasour.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Yes, but what is progressive development?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Sidonia; \u00e2\u0080\u0098and what are\nthe faculties of man? If development be progressive, how do you\naccount for the state of Italy? One will tell you it is superstition,\nindulgences, and the Lady of Loretto; yet three centuries ago, when all\nthese influences were much more powerful, Italy was the soul of Europe.\nThe less prejudiced, a Puseyite for example, like our friend Vavasour,\nwill assure us that the state of Italy has nothing to do with the\nspirit of its religion, but that it is entirely an affair of commerce; a\nrevolution of commerce has convulsed its destinies. I cannot forget that\nthe world was once conquered by Italians who had no commerce. Has the\ndevelopment of Western Asia been progressive? It is a land of tombs and\nruins. Is China progressive, the most ancient and numerous of existing\nsocieties? Is Europe itself progressive? Is Spain a tithe as great as\nshe was? Is Germany as great as when she invented printing; as she was\nunder the rule of Charles the Fifth? France herself laments her relative\ninferiority to the past. But England flourishes. Is it what you\ncall civilisation that makes England flourish? Is it the universal\ndevelopment of the faculties of man that has rendered an island, almost\nunknown to the ancients, the arbiter of the world? Clearly not. It is\nher inhabitants that have done this; it is an affair of race. A Saxon\nrace, protected by an insular position, has stamped its diligent and\nmethodic character on the century. And when a superior race, with\na superior idea to work and order, advances, its state will be\nprogressive, and we shall, perhaps, follow the example of the desolate\ncountries. All is race; there is no other truth.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Because it includes all others?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Lord Henry.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098You have said it.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098As for Vavasour\u00e2\u0080\u0099s definition of civilisation,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Coningsby,\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098civilisation was more advanced in ancient than modern times; then what\nbecomes of the progressive principle? Look at the great centuries of the\nRoman Empire! You had two hundred millions of human beings governed by\na jurisprudence so philosophical that we have been obliged to adopt\nits laws, and living in perpetual peace. The means of communication,\nof which we now make such a boast, were far more vast and extensive in\nthose days. What were the Great Western and the London and Birmingham to\nthe Appian and Flaminian roads? After two thousand five hundred years,\nparts of these are still used. A man under the Antonines might travel\nfrom Paris to Antioch with as much ease and security as we go from\nLondon to York. As for free trade, there never was a really unshackled\ncommerce except in the days when the whole of the Mediterranean coasts\nbelonged to one power. What a chatter there is now about the towns, and\nhow their development is cited as the peculiarity of the age, and the\ngreat security for public improvement. Why, the Roman Empire was the\nempire of great cities. Man was then essentially municipal.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098What an empire!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Sidonia. \u00e2\u0080\u0098All the superior races in all the\nsuperior climes.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098But how does all this accord with your and Coningsby\u00e2\u0080\u0099s favourite theory\nof the influence of individual character?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Vavasour to Sidonia;\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098which I hold, by-the-bye,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he added rather pompously, \u00e2\u0080\u0098to be entirely\nfutile.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098What is individual character but the personification of race,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said\nSidonia, \u00e2\u0080\u0098its perfection and choice exemplar? Instead of being an\ninconsistency, the belief in the influence of the individual is a\ncorollary of the original proposition.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I look upon a belief in the influence of individual character as a\nbarbarous superstition,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Vavasour.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Vavasour believes that there would be no heroes if there were a\npolice,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Coningsby; \u00e2\u0080\u0098but I believe that civilisation is only fatal\nto minstrels, and that is the reason now we have no poets.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098How do you account for the Polish failure in 1831?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Lord Marney.\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098They had a capital army, they were backed by the population, but they\nfailed. They had everything but a man.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Why were the Whigs smashed in 1834,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Coningsby, \u00e2\u0080\u0098but because they\nhad not a man?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098What is the real explanation of the state of Mexico?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Sidonia. \u00e2\u0080\u0098It\nhas not a man.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098So much for progress since the days of Charles the Fifth,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Henry\nSydney. \u00e2\u0080\u0098The Spaniards then conquered Mexico, and now they cannot\ngovern it.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098So much for race,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Vavasour. \u00e2\u0080\u0098The race is the same; why are not\nthe results the same?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Because it is worn out,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Sidonia. \u00e2\u0080\u0098Why do not the Ethiopians build\nanother Thebes, or excavate the colossal temples of the cataracts? The\ndecay of a race is an inevitable necessity, unless it lives in deserts\nand never mixes its blood.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI.\n\n     _Sweet Sympathy_\n\nI AM sorry, my dear mother, that I cannot accompany you; but I must go\ndown to my yacht this morning, and on my return from Greenwich I have an\nengagement.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nThis was said about a week after the dinner at Sidonia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, by Lord\nMontacute to the duchess. \u00e2\u0080\u0098That terrible yacht!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 thought the duchess.\nHer Grace, a year ago, had she been aware of it, would have deemed\nTancred\u00e2\u0080\u0099s engagement as fearful an affair. The idea that her son should\nhave called every day for a week on a married lady, beautiful and\nattractive, would have filled her with alarm amounting almost to horror.\nYet such was the innocent case. It might at the first glance seem\ndifficult to reconcile the rival charms of the Basilisk and Lady Bertie\nand Bellair, and to understand how Tancred could be so interested in the\npreparations for a voyage which was to bear him from the individual in\nwhose society he found a daily gratification. But the truth is, that\nLady Bertie and Bellair was the only person who sympathised with his\nadventure.\n\nShe listened with the liveliest concern to his account of all his\nprogress; she even made many admirable suggestions, for Lady Bertie and\nBellair had been a frequent visitor at Cowes, and was quite initiated\nin the mysteries of the dilettante service of the Yacht Club. She was\na capital sailor; at least she always told Tancred so. But this was not\nthe chief source of sympathy, or the principal bond of union, between\nthem. It was not the voyage, so much as the object of the voyage, that\ntouched all the passion of Lady Bertie and Bellair. Her heart was at\nJerusalem. The sacred city was the dream of her life; and, amid the\ndissipations of May Fair and the distractions of Belgravia, she had in\nfact all this time only been thinking of Jehoshaphat and Sion. Strange\ncoincidence of sentiment--strange and sweet!\n\nThe enamoured Montacute hung over her with pious rapture, as they\nexamined together Mr. Roberts\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Syrian drawings, and she alike charmed\nand astonished him by her familiarity with every locality and each\ndetail. She looked like a beautiful prophetess as she dilated with\nsolemn enthusiasm on the sacred scene. Tancred called on her every day,\nbecause when he called the first time he had announced his immediate\ndeparture, and so had been authorised to promise that he would pay his\nrespects to her every day till he went. It was calculated that by these\nmeans, that is to say three or four visits, they might perhaps travel\nthrough Mr. Roberts\u00e2\u0080\u0099s views together before he left England, which would\nfacilitate their correspondence, for Tancred had engaged to write to the\nonly person in the world worthy of receiving his letters. But, though\nseparated, Lady Bertie and Bellair would be with him in spirit; and\nonce she sighed and seemed to murmur that if his voyage could only be\npostponed awhile, she might in a manner become his fellow-pilgrim, for\nLord Bertie, a great sportsman, had a desire to kill antelopes, and,\nwearied with the monotonous slaughter of English preserves, tired even\nof the eternal moors, had vague thoughts of seeking new sources of\nexcitement amid the snipes of the Grecian marshes, and the deer and wild\nboars of the desert and the Syrian hills.\n\nWhile his captain was repeating his inquiries for instructions on the\ndeck of the Basilisk at Greenwich, moored off the Trafalgar Hotel,\nTancred fell into reveries of female pilgrims kneeling at the Holy\nSepulchre by his side; then started, gave a hurried reply, and drove\nback quickly to town, to pass the remainder of the morning in Brook\nStreet.\n\nThe two or three days had expanded into two or three weeks, and Tancred\ncontinued to call daily on Lady Bertie and Bellair, to say farewell. It\nwas not wonderful: she was the only person in London who understood him;\nso she delicately intimated, so he profoundly felt. They had the same\nideas; they must have the same idiosyncrasy. The lady asked with a sigh\nwhy they had not met before; Tancred found some solace in the thought\nthat they had at least become acquainted. There was something about this\nlady very interesting besides her beauty, her bright intelligence, and\nher seraphic thoughts. She was evidently the creature of impulse; to\na certain degree perhaps the victim of her imagination. She seemed\nmisplaced in life. The tone of the century hardly suited her refined and\nromantic spirit. Her ethereal nature seemed to shrink from the coarse\nreality which invades in our days even the boudoirs of May Fair.\n\nThere was something in her appearance and the temper of her being which\nrebuked the material, sordid, calculating genius of our reign of Mammon.\n\nHer presence in this world was a triumphant vindication of the claims\nof beauty and of sentiment. It was evident that she was not happy;\nfor, though her fair brow always lighted up when she met the glance\nof Tancred, it was impossible not to observe that she was sometimes\nstrangely depressed, often anxious and excited, frequently absorbed in\nreverie. Yet her vivid intelligence, the clearness and precision of her\nthought and fancy, never faltered. In the unknown yet painful contest,\nthe intellectual always triumphed. It was impossible to deny that she\nwas a woman of great ability.\n\nNor could it for a moment be imagined that these fitful moods were\nmerely the routine intimations that her domestic hearth was not as happy\nas it deserved to be. On the contrary, Lord and Lady Bertie and Bellair\nwere the very best friends; she always spoke of her husband with\ninterest and kindness; they were much together, and there evidently\nexisted between them mutual confidence. His lordship\u00e2\u0080\u0099s heart, indeed,\nwas not at Jerusalem; and perhaps this want of sympathy on a subject\nof such rare and absorbing interest might account for the occasional\nmusings of his wife, taking refuge in her own solitary and devoutly\npassionate soul. But this deficiency on the part of his lordship could\nscarcely be alleged against him as a very heinous fault; it is far from\nusual to find a British noble who on such a topic entertains the notions\nand sentiments of Lord Montacute; almost as rare to find a British\npeeress who could respond to them with the same fervour and facility\nas the beautiful Lady Bertie and Bellair. The life of a British peer is\nmainly regulated by Arabian laws and Syrian customs at this moment;\nbut, while he sabbatically abstains from the debate or the rubber,\nor regulates the quarterly performance of his judicial duties in his\nprovince by the advent of the sacred festivals, he thinks little of the\nland and the race who, under the immediate superintendence of the Deity,\nhave by their sublime legislation established the principle of periodic\nrest to man, or by their deeds and their dogmas, commemorated by their\nholy anniversaries, have elevated the condition and softened the lot of\nevery nation except their own.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098And how does Tancred get on?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 asked Lord Eskdale one morning of the\nDuchess of Bellamont, with a dry smile. \u00e2\u0080\u0098I understand that, instead of\ngoing to Jerusalem, he is going to give us a fish dinner.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nThe Duchess of Bellamont had made the acquaintance of Lady Bertie and\nBellair, and was delighted with her, although her Grace had been told\nthat Lord Montacute called upon her every day. The proud, intensely\nproper, and highly prejudiced Duchess of Bellamont took the most\ncharitable view of this sudden and fervent friendship. A female friend,\nwho talked about Jerusalem, but kept her son in London, was in the\npresent estimation of the duchess a real treasure, the most interesting\nand admirable of her sex. Their intimacy was satisfactorily accounted\nfor by the invaluable information which she imparted to Tancred; what\nhe was to see, do, eat, drink; how he was to avoid being poisoned and\nassassinated, escape fatal fevers, regularly attend the service of\nthe Church of England in countries where there were no churches, and\nconverse in languages of which he had no knowledge. He could not have a\nbetter counsellor than Lady Bertie, who had herself travelled, at least\nto the Faubourg St. Honor\u00c3\u00a9, and, as Horace Walpole says, after Calais\nnothing astonishes. Certainly Lady Bertie had not been herself to\nJerusalem, but she had read about it, and every other place. The duchess\nwas delighted that Tancred had a companion who interested him. With\nall the impulse of her sanguine temperament, she had already accustomed\nherself to look upon the long-dreaded yacht as a toy, and rather an\namusing one, and was daily more convinced of the prescient shrewdness of\nher cousin, Lord Eskdale.\n\nTancred was going to give them a fish dinner! A what? A sort of\nbanquet which might have served for the marriage feast of Neptune and\nAmphitrite, and be commemorated by a constellation; and which ought\nto have been administered by the Nereids and the Naiads; terrines of\nturtle, pools of water _souch\u00c3\u00a9e_, flounders of every hue, and eels in\nevery shape, cutlets of salmon, salmis of carp, ortolans represented by\nwhitebait, and huge roasts carved out of the sturgeon. The appetite is\ndistracted by the variety of objects, and tantalised by the restlessness\nof perpetual solicitation; not a moment of repose, no pause for\nenjoyment; eventually, a feeling of satiety, without satisfaction, and\nof repletion without sustenance; till, at night, gradually recovering\nfrom the whirl of the anomalous repast, famished yet incapable of\nflavour, the tortured memory can only recall with an effort, that it has\ndined off pink champagne and brown bread and butter!\n\nWhat a ceremony to be presided over by Tancred of Montacute; who, if\nhe deigned to dine at all, ought to have dined at no less a round table\nthan that of King Arthur. What a consummation of a sublime project!\nWhat a catastrophe of a spiritual career! A Greenwich party and a tavern\nbill!\n\nAll the world now is philosophical, and therefore they can account for\nthis disaster. Without doubt we are the creatures of circumstances; and,\nif circumstances take the shape of a charming woman, who insists upon\nsailing in your yacht, which happens to to be at Blackwall or Greenwich,\nit is not easy to discover how the inevitable consequences can be\navoided. It would hardly do, off the Nore, to present your mistress\nwith a sea-pie, or abruptly remind your farewell friends and sorrowing\nparents of their impending loss by suddenly serving up soup hermetically\nsealed, and roasting the embalmed joint, which ought only to have smoked\namid the ruins of Thebes or by the cataracts of Nubia.\n\nThere are, however, two sides of every picture; a party may be pleasant,\nand even a fish dinner not merely a whirl of dishes and a clash of\nplates. The guests may be not too numerous, and well assorted; the\nattendance not too devoted, yet regardful; the weather may be charming,\nwhich is a great thing, and the giver of the dinner may be charmed, and\nthat is everything.\n\nThe party to see the Basilisk was not only the most agreeable of the\nseason, but the most agreeable ever known. They all said so when they\ncame back. Mr. Vavasour, who was there, went to all his evening parties;\nto the assembly by the wife of a minister in Carlton Terrace; to a rout\nby the wife of the leader of opposition in Whitehall; to a literary\nsoir\u00c3\u00a9e in Westminster, and a brace of balls in Portman and Belgrave\nSquares; and told them all that they were none of them to be compared\nto the party of the morning, to which, it must be owned, he had greatly\ncontributed by his good humour and merry wit. Mrs. Coningsby declared to\nevery one that, if Lord Monta-cute would take her, she was quite ready\nto go to Jerusalem; such a perfect vessel was the Basilisk, and such an\nadmirable sailor was Mrs. Coningsby, which, considering that the river\nwas like a mill-pond, according to Tancred\u00e2\u0080\u0099s captain, or like a mirror,\naccording to Lady Bertie and Bellair, was not surprising. The duke\nprotested that he was quite glad that Mon-tacute had taken to yachting,\nit seemed to agree with him so well; and spoke of his son\u00e2\u0080\u0099s future\nmovements as if there were no such place as Palestine in the world. The\nsanguine duchess dreamed of Cowes regattas, and resolved to agree to\nany arrangement to meet her son\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fancy, provided he would stay at home,\nwhich she convinced herself he had now resolved to do.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Our cousin is so wise,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 she said to her husband, as they were\nreturning. \u00e2\u0080\u0098What could the bishop mean by saying that Tancred was a\nvisionary? I agree with you, George, there is no counsellor like a man\nof the world.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I wish M. de Sidonia had come,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Lady Bertie and Bellair, gazing\nfrom the window of the Trafalgar on the moonlit river with an expression\nof abstraction, and speaking in a tone almost of melancholy.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I also wish it, since you do,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Tancred. \u00e2\u0080\u0098But they say he goes\nnowhere. It was almost presumptuous in me to ask him, yet I did so\nbecause you wished it.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I never shall know him,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Lady Bertie and Bellair, with some\nvexation.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098He interests you,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Tancred, a little piqued.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I had so many things to say to him,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said her ladyship.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Indeed!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Tancred; and then he continued, \u00e2\u0080\u0098I offered him every\ninducement to come, for I told him it was to meet you; but perhaps if\nhe had known that you had so many things to say to him, he might have\nrelented.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098So many things! Oh! yes. You know he has been a great traveller; he has\nbeen everywhere; he has been at Jerusalem.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Fortunate man!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 exclaimed Tancred, half to himself. \u00e2\u0080\u0098Would I were\nthere!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Would we were there, you mean,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Lady Bertie, in a tone of\nexquisite melody, and looking at Tancred with her rich, charged eyes.\n\nHis heart trembled; he was about to give utterance to some wild words,\nbut they died upon his lips. Two great convictions shared his being:\nthe absolute necessity of at once commencing his pilgrimage, and the\npersuasion that life, without the constant presence of this sympathising\ncompanion, must be intolerable. What was to be done? In his long\nreveries, where he had brooded over so many thoughts, some only of which\nhe had as yet expressed to mortal ear, Tancred had calculated, as he\nbelieved, every combination of obstacle which his projects might have\nto encounter; but one, it now seemed, he had entirely omitted, the\ninfluence of woman. Why was he here? Why was he not away? Why had he\nnot departed? The reflection was intolerable; it seemed to him even\ndisgraceful. The being who would be content with nothing less than\ncommuning with celestial powers in sacred climes, standing at a tavern\nwindow gazing on the moonlit mudbanks of the barbarous Thames, a river\nwhich neither angel nor prophet had ever visited! Before him, softened\nby the hour, was the Isle of Dogs! The Isle of Dogs! It should at least\nbe Cyprus!\n\nThe carriages were announced; Lady Bertie and Bellair placed her arm in\nhis.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXII.\n\n     _The Crusader Receives a Shock_\n\nTANCRED passed a night of great disquiet. His mind was agitated, his\npurposes indefinite; his confidence in himself seemed to falter. Where\nwas that strong will that had always sustained him? that faculty of\ninstant decision which had given such vigour to his imaginary deeds?\nA shadowy haze had suffused his heroic idol, duty, and he could not\nclearly distinguish either its form or its proportions. Did he wish to\ngo to the Holy Land or not? What a question? Had it come to that? Was\nit possible that he could whisper such an enquiry, even to his midnight\nsoul? He did wish to go to the Holy Land; his purpose was not in the\nleast faltering; he most decidedly wished to go to the Holy Land, but he\nwished also to go thither in the company of Lady Bertie and Bellair.\n\nTancred could not bring himself to desert the only being perhaps in\nEngland, excepting himself, whose heart was at Jerusalem; and that\nbeing a woman! There seemed something about it unknightly, unkind and\ncowardly, almost base. Lady Bertie was a heroine worthy of ancient\nChristendom rather than of enlightened Europe. In the old days, truly\nthe good old days, when the magnetic power of Western Asia on the Gothic\nraces had been more puissant, her noble yet delicate spirit might have\nbeen found beneath the walls of Ascalon or by the purple waters of\nTyre. When Tancred first met her, she was dreaming of Palestine amid her\nfrequent sadness; he could not, utterly void of all self-conceit as\nhe was, be insensible to the fact that his sympathy, founded on such\na divine congeniality, had often chased the cloud from her brow and\nlightened the burthen of her drooping spirit. If she were sad before,\nwhat would she be now, deprived of the society of the only being to whom\nshe could unfold the spiritual mysteries of her romantic soul? Was such\na character to be left alone in this world of slang and scrip; of coarse\nmotives and coarser words? Then, too, she was so intelligent and so\ngentle; the only person who understood him, and never grated for an\ninstant on his high ideal. Her temper also was the sweetest in the\nworld, eminent as her generous spirit. She spoke of others with so much\nkindness, and never indulged in that spirit of detraction or that love\nof personal gossip which Tancred had frankly told her he abhorred.\nSomehow or other it seemed that their tastes agreed on everything.\n\nThe agitated Tancred rose from the bed where the hope of slumber was\nvain. The fire in his dressing-room was nearly extinguished; wrapped in\nhis chamber robe, he threw himself into a chair, which he drew near the\nexpiring embers, and sighed.\n\nUnhappy youth! For you commences that great hallucination, which all\nmust prove, but which fortunately can never be repeated, and which,\nin mockery, we call first love. The physical frame has its infantile\ndisorders; the cough which it must not escape, the burning skin which it\nmust encounter. The heart has also its childish and cradle malady, which\nmay be fatal, but which, if once surmounted, enables the patient to meet\nwith becoming power all the real convulsions and fevers of passion that\nare the heirloom of our after-life. They, too, may bring destruction;\nbut, in their case, the cause and the effect are more proportioned.\nThe heroine is real, the sympathy is wild but at least genuine, the\ncatastrophe is that of a ship at sea which sinks with a rich cargo in a\nnoble venture.\n\nIn our relations with the softer sex it cannot be maintained that\nignorance is bliss. On the contrary, experience is the best security\nfor enduring love. Love at first sight is often a genial and genuine\nsentiment, but first love at first sight is ever eventually branded as\nspurious. Still more so is that first love which suffuses less rapidly\nthe spirit of the ecstatic votary, when he finds that by degrees his\nfeelings, as the phrase runs, have become engaged. Fondness is so new\nto him that he has repaid it with exaggerated idolatry, and become\nintoxicated by the novel gratification of his vanity. Little does he\nsuspect that all this time his seventh heaven is but the crapulence\nof self-love. In these cases, it is not merely that everything is\nexaggerated, but everything is factitious. Simultaneously, the imaginary\nattributes of the idol disappearing, and vanity being satiated, all ends\nin a crash of iconoclastic surfeit.\n\nThe embers became black, the night air had cooled the turbulent blood of\nLord Montacute, he shivered, returned to his couch, and found a deep and\ninvigorating repose.\n\nThe next morning, about two hours after noon, Tancred called on Lady\nBertie. As he drove up to the door, there came forth from it the\nforeigner who was her companion in the city fray when Tancred first saw\nher and went to her rescue. He recognised Lord Montacute, and bowed with\nmuch ceremony, though with a certain grace and bearing. He was a man\nwhose wrinkled visage strangely contrasted with his still gallant\nfigure, scrupulously attired; a blue frock-coat with a ribboned\nbutton-hole, a well-turned boot, hat a little too hidalgoish, but\nquite new. There was something respectable and substantial about him,\nnotwithstanding his moustaches, and a carriage a degree too debonair for\nhis years. He did not look like a carbonaro or a refugee. Who could he\nbe?\n\nTancred had asked himself this question before. This was not the first\ntime that he had encountered this distinguished foreigner since their\nfirst meeting. Tancred had seen him before this, quitting the door of\nLord Bertie and Bellair; had stumbled over him before this, more than\nonce, on the staircase; once, to his surprise, had met him as he entered\nthe personal saloon of Lady Bertie. As it was evident, on that occasion,\nthat his visit had been to the lady, it was thought necessary to say\nsomething, and he had been called the Baron, and described, though in a\nsomewhat flurried and excited manner, as a particular friend, a person\nin whom they had the most entire confidence, who had been most kind to\nthem at Paris, putting them in the way of buying the rarest china for\nnothing, and who was now over here on some private business of his own,\nof great importance. The Bertie and Bellairs felt immense interest in\nhis exertions, and wished him every success; Lord Bertie particularly.\nIt was not at all surprising, considering the innumerable kindnesses\nthey had experienced at his hands, was it?\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Nothing more natural,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 replied Tancred; and he turned the conversation.\n\nLady Bertie was much depressed this morning, so much so that it was\nimpossible for Tancred not to notice her unequal demeanour. Her hand\ntrembled as he touched it; her face, flushed when he entered, became\ndeadly pale.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098You are not well,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he said. \u00e2\u0080\u0098I fear the open carriage last night has\nmade you already repent our expedition.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nShe shook her head. It was not the open carriage, which was delightful,\nnor the expedition, which was enchanting, that had affected her. Would\nthat life consisted only of such incidents, of barouches and whitebait\nbanquets! Alas! no, it was not these. But she was nervous, her slumbers\nhad been disquieted, she had encountered alarming dreams; she had a\nprofound conviction that something terrible was impending over her.\nAnd Tancred took her hand, to prevent, if possible, what appeared to be\ninevitable hysterics. But Lady Bertie and Bellair was a strong-minded\nwoman, and she commanded herself.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I can bear anything,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Tancred, in a trembling voice, \u00e2\u0080\u0098but to see\nyou unhappy.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 And he drew his chair nearer to hers.\n\nHer face was hid, her beautiful face in her beautiful hand. There was\nsilence and then a sigh.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Dear lady,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Lord Montacute.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098What is it?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 murmured Lady Bertie and Bellair.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Why do you sigh?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Because I am miserable.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098No, no, no, don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t use such words,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said the distracted Tancred. \u00e2\u0080\u0098You\nmust not be miserable; you shall not be.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Can I help it? Are we not about to part?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098We need not part,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he said, in a low voice.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Then you will remain?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 she said, looking up, and her dark brown eyes\nwere fixed with all their fascination on the tortured Tancred.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Till we all go,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he said, in a soothing voice.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098That can never be,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Lady Bertie; \u00e2\u0080\u0098Augustus will never hear of it;\nhe never could be absent more than six weeks from London, he misses his\nclubs so. If Jerusalem were only a place one could get at, something\nmight be done; if there were a railroad to it for example.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098A railroad!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 exclaimed Tancred, with a look of horror. \u00e2\u0080\u0098A railroad to\nJerusalem!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098No, I suppose there never can be one,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 continued Lady Bertie, in a\nmusing tone. \u00e2\u0080\u0098There is no traffic. And I am the victim,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 she added, in\na thrilling voice; I am left here among people who do not comprehend me,\nand among circumstances with which I can have no sympathy. But go, Lord\nMontacute, go, and be happy, alone. I ought to have been prepared for\nall this; you have not deceived me. You told me from the first you were\na pilgrim, but I indulged in a dream. I believe that I should not only\nvisit Palestine, but even visit it with you.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 And she leant back in her\nchair and covered her face with her hands.\n\nTancred rose from his seat, and paced the chamber. His heart seemed to\nburst.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098What is all this?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he thought. \u00e2\u0080\u0098How came all this to occur? How has\narisen this singular combination of unforeseen causes and undreamed-of\ncircumstances, which baffles all my plans and resolutions, and seems, as\nit were, without my sanction and my agency, to be taking possession of\nmy destiny and life? I am bewildered, confounded, incapable of thought\nor deed.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nHis tumultuous reverie was broken by the sobs of Lady Bertie.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098By heaven, I cannot endure this!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Tancred, advancing. \u00e2\u0080\u0098Death seems\nto me preferable to her un-happiness. Dearest of women!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Do not call me that,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 she murmured. \u00e2\u0080\u0098I can bear anything from your lips\nbut words of fondness. And pardon all this; I am not myself to-day.\nI had thought that I had steeled myself to all, to our inevitable\nseparation; but I have mistaken myself, at least miscalculated my\nstrength. It is weak; it is very weak and very foolish, but you must\npardon it. I am too much interested in your career to wish you to delay\nyour departure a moment for my sake. I can bear our separation, at least\nI think I can. I shall quit the world, for ever. I should have done so\nhad we not met. I was on the point of doing so when we did meet, when,\nwhen my dream was at length realised. Go, go; do not stay. Bless you,\nand write to me, if I be alive to receive your letters.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I cannot leave her,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 thought the harrowed Tancred. \u00e2\u0080\u0098It never shall be\nsaid of me that I could blight a woman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s life, or break her heart.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 But,\njust as he was advancing, the door opened, and a servant brought in a\nnote, and, without looking at Tancred, who had turned to the window,\ndisappeared. The desolation and despair which had been impressed on the\ncountenance of Lady Bertie and Bellair vanished in an instant, as she\nrecognised the handwriting of her correspondent. They were succeeded by\nan expression of singular excitement. She tore open the note; a stupor\nseemed to spread over her features, and, giving a faint shriek, she fell\ninto a swoon.\n\nTancred rushed to her side; she was quite insensible, and pale as\nalabaster. The note, which was only two lines, was open and extended\nin her hands. It was from no idle curiosity, but it was impossible for\nTancred not to read it. He had one of those eagle visions that nothing\ncould escape, and, himself extremely alarmed, it was the first object\nat which he unconsciously glanced in his agitation to discover the cause\nand the remedy for this crisis. The note ran thus:\n\n\n_\u00e2\u0080\u00983 o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 The Narrow Gauge has won. We are utterly done; and\nSnicks tells me you bought five hundred more yesterday, at ten. Is it\npossible?_\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098_f._\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Is it possible?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 echoed Tancred, as, entrusting Lady Bertie to her\nmaid, he rapidly descended the staircase of her mansion. He almost ran\nto Davies Street, where he jumped into a cab, not permitting the driver\nto descend to let him in.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Where to?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 asked the driver.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098The city.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098What part?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Never mind; near the Bank.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nAlighting from the cab, Tancred hurried to Sequin Court and sent in his\ncard to Sidonia, who in a few moments received him. As he entered the\ngreat financier\u00e2\u0080\u0099s room, there came out of it the man called in Brook\nStreet the Baron.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Well, how did your dinner go off?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Sidonia, looking with some\nsurprise at the disturbed countenance of Tancred.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098It seems very ridiculous, very impertinent I fear you will think it,\u00e2\u0080\u0099\nsaid Tancred, in a hesitating confused manner, \u00e2\u0080\u0098but that person, that\nperson who has just left the room; I have a particular reason, I have\nthe greatest desire, to know who that person is.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098That is a French capitalist,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 replied Sidonia, with a slight smile,\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098an eminent French capitalist, the Baron Villebecque de Ch\u00c3\u00a2teau Neuf. He\nwants me to support him in a great railroad enterprise in his country:\na new line to Strasbourg, and looks to a great traffic, I suppose, in\npasties. But this cannot much interest you. What do you want really to\nknow about him? I can tell you everything. I have been acquainted with\nhim for years. He was the intendant of Lord Monmouth, who left\nhim thirty thousand pounds, and he set up upon this at Paris as a\nmillionaire. He is in the way of becoming one, has bought lands, is a\ndeputy and a baron. He is rather a favourite of mine,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 added Sidonia,\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098and I have been able, perhaps, to assist him, for I knew him long\nbefore Lord Monmouth did, in a very different position from that which\nhe now fills, though not one for which I have less respect. He was a\nfine comic actor in the courtly parts, and the most celebrated manager\nin Europe; always a fearful speculator, but he is an honest fellow, and\nhas a good heart.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098He is a great friend of Lady Bertie and Bellair,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Tancred, rather\nhesitatingly.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Naturally,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Sidonia.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098She also,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Tancred, with a becalmed countenance, but a palpitating\nheart, \u00e2\u0080\u0098is, I believe, much interested in railroads?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098She is the most inveterate female gambler in Europe,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Sidonia,\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098whatever shape her speculations take. Villebecque is a great ally\nof hers. He always had a weakness for the English aristocracy, and\nremembers that he owed his fortune to one of them. Lady Bertie was in\ngreat tribulation this year at Paris: that was the reason she did not\ncome over before Easter; and Villebecque extricated her from a scrape.\nHe would assist her now if he could. By-the-bye, the day that I had the\npleasure of making your acquaintance, she was here with Villebecque, an\nhour at my door, but I could not see her; she pesters me, too, with her\nletters. But I do not like feminine finance. I hope the worthy baron\nwill be discreet in his alliance with her, for her affairs, which I\nknow, as I am obliged to know every one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, happen to be at this moment\nmost critical.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I am trespassing on you,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Tancred, after a painful pause, \u00e2\u0080\u0098but I\nam about to set sail.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098When?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098To-morrow; to-day, if I could; and you were so kind as to promise\nme----\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098A letter of introduction and a letter of credit. I have not forgotten,\nand I will write them for you at once.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 And Sidonia took up his pen and\nwrote:\n\n\nA Letter of Introduction.\n\nTo Alonzo Lara, Spanish Prior, at the Convent of Terra Santa at\nJerusalem.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Most holy Father: The youth who will deliver to you this is a pilgrim\nwho aspires to penetrate the great Asian mystery. Be to him what you\nwere to me; and may the God of Sinai, in whom we all believe, guard over\nyou, and prosper his enterprise!\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Sidonia. \u00e2\u0080\u0098London, May, 1845.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098You can read Spanish,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Sidonia, giving him the letter. \u00e2\u0080\u0098The other\nI shall write in Hebrew, which you will soon read.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\nA Letter of Credit.\n\nTo Adam Besso at Jerusalem.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098London, May, 1845. \u00e2\u0080\u0098My good Adam: If the youth who bears this require\nadvances, let him have as much gold as would make the right-hand lion on\nthe first step of the throne of Solomon the king; and if he want more,\nlet him have as much as would form the lion that is on the left; and\nso on, through every stair of the royal seat. For all which will be\nresponsible to you the child of Israel, who among the Gentiles is called\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Sidonia.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIII.\n\n     _Jerusalem by Moonlight_\n\nTHE broad moon lingers on the summit of Mount Olivet, but its beam has\nlong left the garden of Gethsemane and the tomb of Absalom, the waters\nof Kedron and the dark abyss of Jehoshaphat. Full falls its splendour,\nhowever, on the opposite city, vivid and defined in its silver blaze. A\nlofty wall, with turrets and towers and frequent gates, undulates with\nthe unequal ground which it covers, as it encircles the lost capital of\nJehovah. It is a city of hills, far more famous than those of Rome:\nfor all Europe has heard of Sion and of Calvary, while the Arab and\nthe Assyrian, and the tribes and nations beyond, are as ignorant of\nthe Capitolian and Aventine Mounts as they are of the Malvern or the\nChiltern Hills.\n\nThe broad steep of Sion crowned with the tower of David; nearer still,\nMount Moriah, with the gorgeous temple of the God of Abraham, but built,\nalas! by the child of Hagar, and not by Sarah\u00e2\u0080\u0099s chosen one; close to\nits cedars and its cypresses, its lofty spires and airy arches, the\nmoonlight falls upon Bethesda\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pool; further on, entered by the gate\nof St. Stephen, the eye, though \u00e2\u0080\u0098tis the noon of night, traces with ease\nthe Street of Grief, a long winding ascent to a vast cupolaed pile that\nnow covers Calvary, called the Street of Grief because there the most\nillustrious of the human, as well as of the Hebrew, race, the descendant\nof King David, and the divine Son of the most favoured of women, twice\nsank under that burden of suffering and shame which is now throughout\nall Christendom the emblem of triumph and of honour; passing over groups\nand masses of houses built of stone, with terraced roofs, or surmounted\nwith small domes, we reach the hill of Salem, where Melchisedek built\nhis mystic citadel; and still remains the hill of Scopas, where Titus\ngazed upon Jerusalem on the eve of his final assault. Titus destroyed\nthe temple. The religion of Judaea has in turn subverted the fanes which\nwere raised to his father and to himself in their imperial capital;\nand the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob is now worshipped before\nevery altar in Rome.\n\nJerusalem by moonlight! \u00e2\u0080\u0098Tis a fine spectacle, apart from all its\nindissoluble associations of awe and beauty. The mitigating hour softens\nthe austerity of a mountain landscape magnificent in outline, however\nharsh and severe in detail; and, while it retains all its sublimity,\nremoves much of the savage sternness of the strange and unrivalled\nscene. A fortified city, almost surrounded by ravines, and rising in the\ncentre of chains of far-spreading hills, occasionally offering, through\ntheir rocky glens, the gleams of a distant and richer land!\n\nThe moon has sunk behind the Mount of Olives, and the stars in the\ndarker sky shine doubly bright over the sacred city. The all-pervading\nstillness is broken by a breeze that seems to have travelled over the\nplain of Sharon from the sea. It wails among the tombs, and sighs among\nthe cypress groves. The palm-tree trembles as it passes, as if it were\na spirit of woe. Is it the breeze that has travelled over the plain of\nSharon from the sea?\n\nOr is it the haunting voice of prophets mourning over the city that\nthey could not save? Their spirits surely would linger on the land\nwhere their Creator had deigned to dwell, and over whose impending fate\nOmnipotence had shed human tears. From this Mount! Who can but believe\nthat, at the midnight hour, from the summit of the Ascension, the great\ndeparted of Israel assemble to gaze upon the battlements of their mystic\ncity? There might be counted heroes and sages, who need shrink from\nno rivalry with the brightest and the wisest of other lands; but the\nlawgiver of the time of the Pharaohs, whose laws are still obeyed; the\nmonarch, whose reign has ceased for three thousand years, but whose\nwisdom is a proverb in all nations of the earth; the teacher, whose\ndoctrines have modelled civilised Europe; the greatest of legislators,\nthe greatest of administrators, and the greatest of reformers; what\nrace, extinct or living, can produce three such men as these?\n\nThe last light is extinguished in the village of Bethany. The wailing\nbreeze has become a moaning wind; a white film spreads over the purple\nsky; the stars are veiled, the stars are hid; all becomes as dark as\nthe waters of Kedron and the valley of Jehosha-phat. The tower of David\nmerges into obscurity; no longer glitter the minarets of the mosque\nof Omar; Bethesda\u00e2\u0080\u0099s angelic waters, the gate of Stephen, the street\nof sacred sorrow, the hill of Salem, and the heights of Scopas can no\nlonger be discerned. Alone in the increasing darkness, while the very\nline of the walls gradually eludes the eye, the Church of the Holy\nSepulchre is a beacon light.\n\nAnd why is the Church of the Holy Sepulchre a beacon light? Why, when\nis it already past the noon of darkness, when every soul slumbers in\nJerusalem, and not a sound disturbs the deep repose, except the howl\nof the wild dog crying to the wilder wind; why is the cupola of the\nsanctuary illumined, though the hour has long since been numbered when\npilgrims there kneel and monks pray?\n\nAn armed Turkish guard are bivouacked in the court of the Church; within\nthe Church itself, two brethren of the convent of Terra Santa keep holy\nwatch and ward; while, at the tomb beneath, there kneels a solitary\nyouth, who prostrated himself at sunset, and who will there pass unmoved\nthe whole of the sacred night.\n\nYet the pilgrim is not in communion with the Latin Church; neither is\nhe of the Church Armenian, or the Church Greek; Maronite, Coptic, or\nAbyssinian; these also are Christian churches which cannot call him\nchild.\n\nHe comes from a distant and a northern isle to bow before the tomb of\na descendant of the kings of Israel, because he, in common with all the\npeople of that isle, recognises in that sublime Hebrew incarnation the\npresence of a Divine Redeemer. Then why does he come alone? It is not\nthat he has availed himself of the inventions of modern science to\nrepair first to a spot which all his countrymen may equally desire to\nvisit, and thus anticipate their hurrying arrival. Before the inventions\nof modern science, all his countrymen used to flock hither. Then why do\nthey not now? Is the Holy Land no longer hallowed? Is it not the land of\nsacred and mysterious truths? The land of heavenly messages and earthly\nmiracles? The land of prophets and apostles? Is it not the land upon\nwhose mountains the Creator of the Universe parleyed with man, and the\nflesh of whose anointed race He mystically assumed, when He struck the\nlast blow at the powers of evil? Is it to be believed that there are no\npeculiar and eternal qualities in a land thus visited, which distinguish\nit from all others? That Palestine is like Normandy or Yorkshire, or\neven Attica or Rome.\n\nThere may be some who maintain this; there have been some, and those,\ntoo, among the wisest and the wittiest of the northern and western\nraces, who, touched by a presumptuous jealousy of the long predominance\nof that oriental intellect to which they owed their civilisation, would\nhave persuaded themselves and the world that the traditions of Sinai\nand Calvary were fables. Half a century ago, Europe made a violent and\napparently successful effort to disembarrass itself of its Asian faith.\nThe most powerful and the most civilised of its kingdoms, about to\nconquer the rest, shut up its churches, desecrated its altars, massacred\nand persecuted their sacred servants, and announced that the Hebrew\ncreeds which Simon Peter brought from Palestine, and which his\nsuccessors revealed to Clovis, were a mockery and a fiction. What has\nbeen the result? In every city, town, village, and hamlet of that great\nkingdom, the divine image of the most illustrious of Hebrews has been\nagain raised amid the homage of kneeling millions; while, in the\nheart of its bright and witty capital, the nation has erected the most\ngorgeous of modern temples, and consecrated its marble and golden\nwalls to the name, and memory, and celestial efficacy of a Hebrew woman.\n\nThe country of which the solitary pilgrim, kneeling at this moment\nat the Holy Sepulchre, was a native, had not actively shared in that\ninsurrection against the first and second Testament which distinguished\nthe end of the eighteenth century. But, more than six hundred years\nbefore, it had sent its king, and the flower of its peers and people,\nto rescue Jerusalem from those whom they considered infidels! and now,\ninstead of the third crusade, they expend their superfluous energies in\nthe construction of railroads.\n\nThe failure of the European kingdom of Jerusalem, on which such vast\ntreasure, such prodigies of valour, and such ardent belief had been\nwasted, has been one of those circumstances which have tended to disturb\nthe faith of Europe, although it should have carried convictions of\na very different character. The Crusaders looked upon the Saracens as\ninfidels, whereas the children of the desert bore a much nearer affinity\nto the sacred corpse that had, for a brief space, consecrated the Holy\nSepulchre, than any of the invading host of Europe. The same blood\nflowed in their veins, and they recognised the divine missions both\nof Moses and of his great successor. In an age so deficient in\nphysiological learning as the twelfth century, the mysteries of race\nwere unknown. Jerusalem, it cannot be doubted, will ever remain the\nappanage either of Israel or of Ishmael; and if, in the course of those\ngreat vicissitudes which are no doubt impending for the East, there be\nany attempt to place upon the throne of David a prince of the House of\nCoburg or Deuxponts, the same fate will doubtless await him as, with all\ntheir brilliant qualities and all the sympathy of Europe, was the final\ndoom of the Godfreys, the Baldwins, and the Lusignans.\n\nLike them, the ancestor of the kneeling pilgrim had come to Jerusalem\nwith his tall lance and his burnished armour; but his descendant, though\nnot less daring and not less full of faith, could profit by the splendid\nbut fruitless achievements of the first Tancred de Montacute. Our hero\ncame on this new crusade with an humble and contrite spirit, to pour\nforth his perplexities and sorrows on the tomb of his Redeemer, and to\nask counsel of the sacred scenes which the presence of that Redeemer and\nhis great predecessors had consecrated.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIV.\n\n     _A Gathering of Sages_\n\nNEAR the gate of Sion there is a small, still, hilly street, the houses\nof which, as is general in the East, present to the passenger, with the\nexception of an occasional portal, only blank walls, built, as they are\nat Jerusalem, of stone, and very lofty. These walls commonly enclose\na court, and, though their exterior offers always a sombre and often\nsqualid appearance, it by no means follows that within you may not be\nwelcomed with cheerfulness and even luxury.\n\nAt this moment a man in the Syrian dress, turban and flowing robe, is\npassing through one of the gateways of this street, and entering the\nlarge quadrangle to which it leads. It is surrounded by arcades; on one\nside indications of commerce, piles of chests, cases, and barrels; the\nother serving for such simple stables as are sufficient in the East.\nCrossing this quadrangle, the stranger passed by a corridor into a\nsquare garden of orange and lemon trees and fountains. This garden court\nwas surrounded by inhabited chambers, and, at the end of it, passing\nthrough a low arch at the side, and then mounting a few steps, he was at\nonce admitted into a spacious and stately chamber. Its lofty ceiling was\nvaulted and lightly painted in arabesque; its floor was of white marble,\nvaried with mosaics of fruit and flowers; it was panelled with cedar,\nand in six of the principal panels were Arabic inscriptions emblazoned\nin blue and gold. At the top of this hall, and ranging down its two\nsides, was a divan or seat, raised about one foot from the ground, and\ncovered with silken cushions; and the marble floor before this divan was\nspread at intervals with small bright Persian carpets.\n\nIn this chamber some half dozen persons were seated in the Eastern\nfashion, and smoking either the choice tobaccoes of Syria through the\ncherry-wood or jasmine tube of a Turkish or Egyptian chibouque, or\ninhaling through rose-water the more artificial flavour of the nargileh,\nwhich is the hookah of the Levant. If a guest found his pipe exhausted,\nhe clapped his hands, and immediately a negro page appeared, dressed\nin scarlet or in white, and, learning his pleasure, returned in a few\nmoments, and bowing presented him with a fresh and illumined chibouque.\nAt intervals, these attendants appeared without a summons, and offered\ncups of Mocha coffee or vases of sherbet.\n\nThe lord of this divan, who was seated at the upper end of the room,\nreclining on embroidered cushions of various colours, and using a\nnargileh of fine workmanship, was a man much above the common height,\nbeing at least six feet two without his red cap of Fez, though so well\nproportioned, that you would not at the first glance give him credit for\nsuch a stature. He was extremely handsome, retaining ample remains of\none of those countenances of blended regularity and lustre which are\nfound only in the cradle of the human race. Though he was fifty years\nof age, time had scarcely brought a wrinkle to his still brilliant\ncomplexion, while his large, soft, dark eyes, his arched brow, his\nwell-proportioned nose, his small mouth and oval cheek presented\naltogether one of those faces which, in spite of long centuries of\nphysical suffering and moral degradation, still haunt the cities of Asia\nMinor, the isles of Greece, and the Syrian coasts. It is the archetype\nof manly beauty, the tradition of those races who have wandered the\nleast from Paradise; and who, notwithstanding many vicissitudes and\nmuch misery, are still acted upon by the same elemental agencies as\ninfluenced the Patriarchs; are warmed by the same sun, freshened by the\nsame air, and nourished by the same earth as cheered and invigorated\nand sustained the earlier generations. The costume of the East certainly\ndoes not exaggerate the fatal progress of time; if a figure becomes too\nportly, the flowing robe conceals the incumbrance which is aggravated\nby a western dress; he, too, who wears a turban has little dread of grey\nhairs; a grizzly beard indeed has few charms, but whether it were the\nlenity of time or the skill of his barber in those arts in which Asia\nis as experienced as Europe, the beard of the master of the divan became\nthe rest of his appearance, and flowed to his waist in rich dark curls,\nlending additional dignity to a countenance of which the expression was\nat the same time grand and benignant.\n\nUpon the right of the master of the divan was, smoking a jasmine pipe,\nScheriff Effendi, an Egyptian merchant, of Arab race, a dark face in a\nwhite turban, mild and imperturbable, and seated as erect on his crossed\nlegs as if he were administering justice; a remarkable contrast to the\nindividual who was on the left of the host, who might have been mistaken\nfor a mass of brilliant garments huddled together, had not the gurgling\nsound of the nargileh occasionally assured the spectator that it was\nanimated by human breath. This person was apparently lying on his back,\nhis face hid, his form not to be traced, a wild confusion of shawls and\ncushions, out of which, like some wily and dangerous reptile, glided the\nspiral involutions of his pipe. Next to the invisible sat a little wiry\nman with a red nose, sparkling eyes, and a white beard. His black turban\nintimated that he was a Hebrew, and indeed he was well known as Barizy\nof the Tower, a description which he had obtained from his residence\nnear the Tower of David, and which distinguished him from his cousin,\nwho was called Barizy of the Gate. Further on an Armenian from Stamboul,\nin his dark robes and black protuberant head-dress, resembling a\ncolossal truffle, solaced himself with a cherry stick which reminded him\nof the Bosphorus, and he found a companion in this fashion in the\nyoung officer of a French brig-of-war anchored at Beiroot, and who had\nobtained leave to visit the Holy Land, as he was anxious to see the\nwomen of Bethlehem, of whose beauty he had heard much.\n\nAs the new comer entered the hall, he shuffled off his slippers at the\nthreshold, and then advancing, and pressing a hand to his brow, his\nmouth and his heart, a salutation which signifies that in thought,\nspeech, and feeling he was faithful to his host, and which salutation\nwas immediately returned, he took his seat upon the divan, and the\nmaster of the house, letting the flexible tube of his nargileh fall on\none of the cushions, and clapping his hands, a page immediately brought\na pipe to the new guest. This was Signor Pasqualigo, one of those noble\nVenetian names that every now and then turn up in the Levant, and borne\nin the present case by a descendant of a family who for centuries had\nenjoyed a monopoly of some of the smaller consular offices of the\nSyrian coast. Signor Pasqualigo had installed his son as deputy in the\nambiguous agency at Jaffa, which he described as a vice-consulate, and\nhimself principally resided at Jerusalem, of which he was the prime\ngossip, or second only to his rival, Barizy of the Tower. He had only\ntaken a preliminary puff of his chibouque, to be convinced that there\nwas no fear of its being extinguished, before he said,\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098So there was a fine pilgrimage last night; the Church of the Holy\nSepulchre lighted up from sunset to sunrise, an extra guard in the\ncourt, and only the Spanish prior and two brethren permitted to enter.\nIt must be 10,000 piastres at least in the coffers of the Terra Santa.\nWell, they want something! It is a long time since we have had a Latin\npilgrim in El Khuds.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098And they say, after all, that this was not a Latin pilgrim,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said\nBarizy of the Tower.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098He could not have been one of my people,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said the Armenian, \u00e2\u0080\u0098or he\nnever would have gone to the Holy Sepulchre with the Spanish prior.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Had he been one of your people,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Pasqualigo, \u00e2\u0080\u0098he could not have\npaid 10,000 piastres for a pilgrimage.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I am sure a Greek never would,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Barizy, \u00e2\u0080\u0098unless he were a Russian\nprince.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098And a Russian does not care much for rosaries unless they are made of\ndiamonds,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Pasqualigo.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098As far as I can make out this morning,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Barizy of the Tower, \u00e2\u0080\u0098it\nis a brother of the Queen of England.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I was thinking it might be that,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Pasqualigo, nettled at his\nrival\u00e2\u0080\u0099s early information, \u00e2\u0080\u0098the moment I heard he was an Englishman.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098The English do not believe in the Holy Sepulchre,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said the Armenian,\ncalmly.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098They do not believe in our blessed Saviour,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Pasqualigo, \u00e2\u0080\u0098but they\ndo believe in the Holy Sepulchre.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nPasqualigo\u00e2\u0080\u0099s strong point was theology, and there were few persons in\nJerusalem who on this head ventured to maintain an argument with him.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098How do you know that the pilgrim is an Englishman?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 asked their host.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Because his servants told me so,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Pasqualigo.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098He has got an English general for the principal officer of his\nhousehold,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Barizy, \u00e2\u0080\u0098which looks like blood royal; a very fine man,\nwho passes the whole day at the English consulate.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098They have taken a house in the Via Dolorosa,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Pasqualigo.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Of Hassan Nejed?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 continued Barizy of the Tower, clutching the words\nout of his rival\u00e2\u0080\u0099s grasp; \u00e2\u0080\u0098Hassan asked five thousand piastres per\nmonth, and they gave it. What think you of that?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098He must indeed be an Englishman,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Scheriff Effendi, taking his\npipe slowly from his mouth. There was a dead silence when he spoke; he\nwas much respected.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098He is very young,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Barizy of the Tower; \u00e2\u0080\u0098younger than the Queen,\nwhich is one reason why he is not on the throne, for in England the\neldest always succeeds, except in moveables, and those always go to the\nyoungest.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nBarizy of the Tower, though he gave up to Pasqualigo in theology, partly\nfrom delicacy, being a Jew, would yield to no man in Jerusalem in his\nknowledge of law.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098If he goes on at this rate,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said the Armenian, \u00e2\u0080\u0098he will soon spend all\nhis money; this place is dearer than Stamboul.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098There is no fear of his spending all his money,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said their host, \u00e2\u0080\u0098for\nthe young man has brought me such a letter that if he were to tell me to\nrebuild the temple, I must do it.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098And who is this young man, Besso?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 exclaimed the Invisible, starting\nup, and himself exhibiting a youthful countenance; fair, almost\neffeminate, no beard, a slight moustache, his features too delicate, but\nhis brow finely arched, and his blue eye glittering with fire.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098He is an English lord,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Besso, \u00e2\u0080\u0098and one of the greatest; that is\nall I know.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098And why does he come here?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 inquired the youth. \u00e2\u0080\u0098The English do not\nmake pilgrimages.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 \u00e2\u0080\u0098Yet you have heard what he has done.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 \u00e2\u0080\u0098And why\nis this silent Frenchman smoking your Latakia,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he continued in a low\nvoice. \u00e2\u0080\u0098He comes to Jerusalem at the same time as this Englishman.\nThere is more in this than meets our eye. You do not know the northern\nnations. They exist only in political combinations. You are not a\npolitician, my Besso. Depend upon it, we shall hear more of this\nEnglishman, and of his doing something else than praying at the Holy\nSepulchre.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098It may be so, most noble Emir, but as you say, I am no politician.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Would that you were, my Besso! It would be well for you and for all of\nus. See now,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he added in a whisper, \u00e2\u0080\u0098that apparently inanimate mass,\nScheriff Effendi--that man has a political head, he understands a\ncombination, he is going to smuggle me five thousand English muskets\ninto the desert, he will deliver them to a Bedouin tribe, who have\nengaged to convey them safely to the Mountain. There, what do you think\nof that, my Besso? Do you know now what are politics? Tell the Rose of\nSharon of it. She will say it is beautiful. Ask the Rose what she thinks\nof it, my Besso.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Well, I shall see her to-morrow.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I have done well; have I not?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098You are satisfied; that is well.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Not quite, my Besso; but I can be satisfied if you please. You see that\nScheriff Effendi there, sitting like an Afrite; he will not give me the\nmuskets unless I pay him for them; and the Bedouin chief, he will not\ncarry the arms unless I give him 10,000 piastres. Now, if you will pay\nthese people for me, my Besso, and deduct the expenses from my Lebanon\nloan when it is negotiated, that would be a great service. Now, now, my\nBesso, shall it be done?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he continued with the coaxing voice and with\nthe wheedling manner of a girl. \u00e2\u0080\u0098You shall have any terms you like, and\nI will always love you so, my Besso. Let it be done, let it be done! I\nwill go down on my knees and kiss your hand before the Frenchman, which\nwill spread your fame throughout Europe, and make Louis Philippe take\nyou for the first man in Syria, if you will do it for me. Dear, dear\nBesso, you will pay that old camel Scheriff Ef-fendi for me, will you\nnot? and please the Rose of Sharon as much as me!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098My prince,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Besso, \u00e2\u0080\u0098have a fresh pipe; I never can transact\nbusiness after sunset.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nThe reader will remember that Sidonia had given Tancred a letter of\ncredit on Besso. He is the same Besso who was the friend at Jerusalem of\nContarini Fleming, and this is the same chamber in which Contarini, his\nhost, and others who were present, inscribed one night, before their\nfinal separation, certain sentences in the panels of the walls. The\noriginal writing remains, but Besso, as we have already seen, has had\nthe sentences emblazoned in a manner more permanent and more striking\nto the eye. They may, however, be both seen by all those who visit\nJerusalem, and who enjoy the flowing hospitality and experience the\nboundless benevolence of this prince of Hebrew merchants.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXV.\n\n     _Gethsemane_\n\nTHE Christian convents form one of the most remarkable features of\nmodern Jerusalem. There are three principal ones; the Latin Convent\nof Terra Santa, founded, it is believed, during the last crusade, and\nrichly endowed by the kings of Christendom; the Armenian and the Greek\nconvents, whose revenues are also considerable, but derived from the\nnumerous pilgrims of their different churches, who annually visit the\nHoly Sepulchre, and generally during their sojourn reside within the\nwalls of their respective religious houses. To be competent to supply\nsuch accommodation, it will easily be apprehended that they are of\nconsiderable size. They are in truth monastic establishments of the\nfirst class, as large as citadels, and almost as strong. Lofty stone\nwalls enclose an area of acres, in the centre of which rises an\nirregular mass of buildings and enclosures; courts of all shapes,\ngalleries of cells, roofs, terraces, gardens, corridors, churches,\nhouses, and even streets. Sometimes as many as five thousand pilgrims\nhave been lodged, fed, and tended during Easter in one of these\nconvents.\n\nNot in that of Terra Santa, of which a Protestant traveller, passing for\na pilgrim, is often the only annual guest; as Tancred at present. In a\nwhitewashed cell, clean, and sufficiently airy and spacious, Tancred was\nlying on an iron bedstead, the only permanent furniture of the chamber,\nwith the exception of a crucifix, but well suited to the fervent and\nprocreative clime. He was smoking a Turkish pipe, which stretched nearly\nacross the apartment, and his Italian attendant, Baroni, on one knee,\nwas arranging the bowl. \u00e2\u0080\u0098I begin rather to like it,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Tancred. \u00e2\u0080\u0098I am\nsure you would, my lord. In this country it is like mother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s milk,\nnor is it possible to make way without it. \u00e2\u0080\u0098Tis the finest tobacco of\nLatakia, the choicest in the world, and I have smoked all. I begged it\nmyself from Signor Besso, whose divan is renowned, the day I called on\nhim with your lordship\u00e2\u0080\u0099s letter.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nSaying this, Baroni quickly rose (a man from thirty-two to thirty-five);\nrather under the middle height, slender, lithe, and pliant; a long black\nbeard, cleared off his chin when in Europe, and concealed under his\ncravat, but always ready for the Orient; whiskers closely shaved but\nstrongly marked, sallow, an aquiline nose, white teeth, a sparkling\nblack eye. His costume entirely white, fashion Mamlouk, that is to say,\ntrousers of a prodigious width, and a light jacket; a white shawl wound\nround his waist, enclosing his dagger; another forming his spreading\nturban. Temperament, remarkable vivacity modified by extraordinary\nexperience.\n\nAvailing himself of the previous permission of his master, Baroni,\nhaving arranged the pipe, seated himself cross-legged on the floor.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098And what are they doing about the house?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 inquired Tancred.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098They will be all stowed to-day,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 replied Baroni. \u00e2\u0080\u0098I shall not quit this\nplace, \u00e2\u0080\u0098said Tancred; \u00e2\u0080\u0098I wish to be quite undisturbed.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Be not alarmed, my lord; they are amused. The colonel never quits the\nconsulate; dines there every day, and tells stories about the Peninsular\nwar and the Bellamont cavalry, just as he did on board. Mr. Bernard is\nalways with the English bishop, who is delighted to have an addition to\nhis congregation, which is not too much, consisting of his own family,\nthe English and Prussian consuls, and five Jews, whom they have\nconverted at twenty piastres a-week; but I know they are going to\nstrike for wages. As for the doctor, he has not a minute to himself. The\ngovernor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s wife has already sent for him; he has been admitted to the\nharem; has felt all their pulses without seeing any of their faces, and\nhis medicine chest is in danger of being exhausted before your lordship\nrequires its aid.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Take care that they are comfortable,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Tancred. \u00e2\u0080\u0098And what does your\nlordship wish to do today?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I must go to Gethsemane.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098\u00e2\u0080\u0099Tis the shot of an arrow; go out by the gate of Sion, pass through the\nTurkish cemetery, cross the Kedron, which is so dry this weather that\nyou may do so in your slippers, and you will find the remnant of an\nolive grove at the base of the mount.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098You talk as if you were giving a direction in London.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I wish I knew London as well as I know Jerusalem! This is not a very\ngreat place, and I think I have been here twenty times. Why, I made\neight visits here in \u00e2\u0080\u009840 and \u00e2\u0080\u009841; twice from England, and six times from\nEgypt.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Active work!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Ah! those were times! If the Pasha had taken M. de Sidonia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s advice, in\n\u00e2\u0080\u009841, something would have happened in this city----\u00e2\u0080\u0099 And here Baroni\npulled up: \u00e2\u0080\u0098Your lordship\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pipe draws easy?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Very well. And when was your first visit here, Baroni?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098When M. de Sidonia travelled. I came in his suite from Naples, eighteen\nyears ago, the next Annunciation of our blessed Lady,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 and he crossed\nhimself.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098You must have been very young then?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Young enough; but it was thought, I suppose, that I could light a pipe.\nWe were seven when we left Naples, all picked men; but I was the only\none who was in Paraguay with M. de Sidonia, and that was nearly the end\nof our travels, which lasted five years.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098And what became of the rest?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Got ill or got stupid; no mercy in either case with M. de Sidonia,\npacked off instantly, wherever you may be; whatever money you like,\nbut go you must. If you were in the middle of the desert, and the least\ngrumbling, you would be spliced on a camel, and a Bedouin tribe would\nbe hired to take you to the nearest city, Damascus or Jerusalem, or\nanywhere, with an order on Signor Besso, or some other signor, to pay\nthem.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098And you were never invalided?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Never; I was young and used to tumble about as long as I can remember\nday; but it was sharp practice sometimes; five years of such work as few\nmen have been through. It educated me and opened my mind amazingly.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098It seems to have done so,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Tancred, quietly.\n\nShortly after this, Tancred, attended by Baroni, passed the gate of\nSion. Not a human being was visible, except the Turkish sentries. It was\nmidsummer, but no words and no experience of other places can convey an\nidea of the canicular heat of Jerusalem. Bengal, Egypt, even Nubia, are\nnothing to it; in these countries there are rivers, trees, shade, and\nbreezes; but Jerusalem at midday in midsummer is a city of stone in a\nland of iron with a sky of brass. The wild glare and savage lustre of\nthe landscape are themselves awful. We have all read of the man who had\nlost his shadow; this is a shadowless world. Everything is so flaming\nand so clear, that it would remind one of a Chinese painting, but that\nthe scene is one too bold and wild for the imagination of the Mongol\nrace.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098There,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Baroni, pointing to a group of most ancient olive trees\nat the base of the opposite hill, and speaking as if he were showing the\nway to Kensington, \u00e2\u0080\u0098there is Gethsemane; the path to the right leads to\nBethany.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Leave me now,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Tancred.\n\nThere are moments when we must be alone, and Tancred had fixed upon this\nhour for visiting Gethsemane, because he felt assured that no one would\nbe stirring. Descending Mount Sion, and crossing Kedron, he entered the\nsacred grove.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVI.\n\n     _The Lady of Bethany_\n\nTHE sun had been declining for some hours, the glare of the earth had\nsubsided, the fervour of the air was allayed. A caravan came winding\nround the hills, with many camels and persons in rich, bright Syrian\ndresses; a congregation that had assembled at the Church of the\nAscension on Mount Olivet had broken up, and the side of the hill was\nstudded with brilliant and picturesque groups; the standard of the\nCrescent floated on the Tower of David; there was the clang of Turkish\nmusic, and the governor of the city, with a numerous cavalcade, might be\ndiscerned on Mount Moriah, caracoling without the walls; a procession\nof women bearing classic vases on their heads, who had been fetching\nthe waters of Siloah from the well of Job, came up the valley of\nJehosha-phat, to wind their way to the gate of Stephen and enter\nJerusalem by the street of Calvary.\n\nTancred came forth from the garden of Gethsemane, his face was flushed\nwith the rapt stillness of pious ecstasy; hours had vanished during his\npassionate reverie, and he stared upon the declining sun.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098The path to the right leads to Bethany.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 The force of association\nbrought back the last words that he had heard from a human voice.\nAnd can he sleep without seeing Bethany? He mounts the path. What a\nlandscape surrounds him as he moves! What need for nature to be fair\nin a scene like this, where not a spot is visible that is not heroic\nor sacred, consecrated or memorable; not a rock that is not the cave of\nprophets; not a valley that is not the valley of heaven-anointed kings;\nnot a mountain that is not the mountain of God!\n\nBefore him is a living, a yet breathing and existing city, which\nAssyrian monarchs came down to besiege, which the chariots of Pharaohs\nencompassed, which Roman Emperors have personally assailed, for which\nSaladin and Coeur de Lion, the desert and Christendom, Asia and Europe,\nstruggled in rival chivalry; a city which Mahomet sighed to rule, and\nover which the Creator alike of Assyrian kings and Egyptian Pharaohs and\nRoman Caesars, the Framer alike of the desert and of Christendom, poured\nforth the full effusion of His divinely human sorrow.\n\nWhat need of cascade and of cataract, the deep green turf, the foliage\nof the fairest trees, the impenetrable forest, the abounding river,\nmountains of glaciered crest, the voice of birds, the bounding forms of\nbeauteous animals; all sights and sounds of material loveliness that\nmight become the delicate ruins of some archaic theatre, or the\nlingering fanes of some forgotten faith? They would not be observed as\nthe eye seized on Sion and Calvary; the gates of Bethlehem and Damascus;\nthe hill of Titus; the Mosque of Mahomet and the tomb of Christ. The\nview of Jerusalem is the history of the world; it is more, it is the\nhistory of earth and of heaven.\n\nThe path winding round the southern side of the Mount of Olives at\nlength brought Tancred in sight of a secluded village, situate among the\nhills on a sunny slope, and shut out from all objects excepting the\nwide landscape which immediately faced it; the first glimpse of Arabia\nthrough the ravines of the Jud\u00c3\u00a6an hills; the rapid Jordan quitting its\ngreen and happy valley for the bitter waters of Asphaltites, and, in the\nextreme distance, the blue mountains of Moab.\n\nEre he turned his reluctant steps towards the city, he was attracted by\na garden, which issued, as it were, from a gorge in the hills, so that\nits limit was not perceptible, and then spread over a considerable\nspace, comparatively with the inclosures in its vicinity, until it\nreached the village. It was surrounded by high stone walls, which\nevery now and then the dark spiral forms of a cypress or a cedar would\novertop, and in the more distant and elevated part rose a tall palm\ntree, bending its graceful and languid head, on which the sunbeam\nglittered. It was the first palm that Tancred had ever seen, and his\nheart throbbed as he beheld that fair and sacred tree.\n\nAs he approached the garden, Tancred observed that its portal was open:\nhe stopped before it, and gazed upon its walks of lemon trees with\ndelight and curiosity. Tancred had inherited from his mother a passion\nfor gardens; and an eastern garden, a garden in the Holy Land, such\nas Gethsemane might have been in those days of political justice when\nJerusalem belonged to the Jews; the occasion was irresistible; he could\nnot withstand the temptation of beholding more nearly a palm tree; and\nhe entered.\n\nLike a prince in a fairy tale, who has broken the mystic boundary of\nsome enchanted pleasaunce, Tancred traversed the alleys which were\nformed by the lemon and pomegranate tree, and sometimes by the myrtle\nand the rose. His ear caught the sound of falling water, bubbling with\na gentle noise; more distinct and more forcible every step that he\nadvanced. The walk in which he now found himself ended in an open space\ncovered with roses; beyond them a gentle acclivity, clothed so thickly\nwith a small bright blue flower that it seemed a bank of turquoise, and\non its top was a kiosk of white marble, gilt and painted; by its side,\nrising from a group of rich shrubs, was the palm, whose distant crest\nhad charmed Tancred without the gate.\n\nIn the centre of the kiosk was the fountain, whose alluring voice\nhad tempted Tancred to proceed further than he had at first dared to\nproject. He must not retire without visiting the waters which had been\nspeaking to him so long. Following the path round the area of roses,\nhe was conducted to the height of the acclivity, and entered the kiosk;\nsome small beautiful mats were spread upon its floor, and, reposing upon\none of them, Tancred watched the bright clear water as it danced and\nsparkled in its marble basin.\n\nThe reader has perhaps experienced the effect of falling water. Its\nlulling influence is proverbial. In the present instance, we must\nremember that Tancred had been exposed to the meridian fervour of a\nSyrian sun, that he had been the whole day under the influence of that\nexcitement which necessarily ends in exhaustion; and that, in addition\nto this, he had recently walked some distance; it will not, therefore,\nbe looked upon as an incident improbable or astonishing, that Lord\nMontacute, after pursuing for some time that train of meditation which\nwas his custom, should have fallen asleep.\n\nHis hat had dropped from his head; his rich curls fell on his\noutstretched arm that served as a pillow for a countenance which in the\nsweet dignity of its blended beauty and stillness might have become an\narchangel; and, lying on one of the mats, in an attitude of unconscious\ngracefulness, which a painter might have transferred to his portfolio,\nTancred sank into a deep and dreamless repose.\n\n[Illustration: frontis2-p26]\n\nHe woke refreshed and renovated, but quite insensible of all that had\nrecently occurred. He stretched his limbs; something seemed to embarrass\nhim; he found himself covered with a rich robe. He was about to rise,\nresting on his arm, when turning his head he beheld the form of a woman.\n\nShe was young, even for the East; her stature rather above the ordinary\nheight, and clothed in the rich dress usual among the Syrian ladies.\nShe wore an amber vest of gold-embroidered silk, fitting closely to her\nshape, and fastening with buttons of precious stones from the bosom to\nthe waist, there opening like a tunic, so that her limbs were free to\nrange in her huge Mamlouk trousers, made of that white Cashmere a shawl\nof which can be drawn through a ring. These, fastened round her ankles\nwith clasps of rubies, fell again over her small slippered feet. Over\nher amber vest she had an embroidered pelisse of violet silk, with long\nhanging sleeves, which showed occasionally an arm rarer than the costly\njewels which embraced it; a many-coloured Turkish scarf inclosed her\nwaist; and then, worn loosely over all, was an outer pelisse of amber\nCashmere, lined with the fur of the white fox. At the back of her\nhead was a cap, quite unlike the Greek and Turkish caps which we are\naccustomed to see in England, but somewhat resembling the head-dress of\na Mandarin; round, not flexible, almost flat; and so thickly in-crusted\nwith pearls, that it was impossible to detect the colour of the velvet\nwhich covered it. Beneath it descended two broad braids of dark brown\nhair, which would have swept the ground had they not been turned\nhalf-way up, and there fastened with bunches of precious stones; these,\ntoo, restrained the hair which fell, in rich braids, on each side of her\nface.\n\nThat face presented the perfection of oriental beauty; such as it\nexisted in Eden, such as it may yet occasionally be found among the\nfavoured races in the favoured climes, and such as it might have been\nfound abundantly and for ever, had not the folly and malignity of man\nbeen equal to the wisdom and beneficence of Jehovah. The countenance was\noval, yet the head was small. The complexion was neither fair nor dark,\nyet it possessed the brilliancy of the north without its dryness, and\nthe softness peculiar to the children of the sun without its moisture.\nA rich, subdued and equable tint overspread this visage, though the skin\nwas so transparent that you occasionally caught the streaky splendour of\nsome vein like the dappled shades in the fine peel of beautiful fruit.\n\nBut it was in the eye and its overspreading arch that all the Orient\nspake, and you read at once of the starry vaults of Araby and the\nsplendour of Chaldean skies. Dark, brilliant, with pupil of great\nsize and prominent from its socket, its expression and effect,\nnotwithstanding the long eyelash of the desert, would have been those\nof a terrible fascination had not the depth of the curve in which it\nreposed softened the spell and modified irresistible power by ineffable\ntenderness. This supreme organisation is always accompanied, as in the\npresent instance, by a noble forehead, and by an eyebrow of perfect\nform, spanning its space with undeviating beauty; very narrow, though\nits roots are invisible.\n\nThe nose was small, slightly elevated, with long oval nostrils fully\ndeveloped. The small mouth, the short upper lip, the teeth like the\nneighbouring pearls of Ormuz, the round chin, polished as a statue,\nwere in perfect harmony with the delicate ears, and the hands with nails\nshaped like almonds.\n\nSuch was the form that caught the eye of Tan-cred. She was on the\nopposite side of the fountain, and stood gazing on him with calmness,\nand with a kind of benignant curiosity: The garden, the kiosk, the\nfalling waters, recalled the past, which flashed over his mind almost at\nthe moment when he beheld the beautiful apparition. Half risen, yet\nnot willing to remain until he was on his legs to apologise for his\npresence, Tancred, still leaning on his arm and looking up at his\nunknown companion, said, \u00e2\u0080\u0098Lady, I am an intruder.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nThe lady, seating herself on the brink of the fountain, and motioning at\nthe same time with her hand to Tancred not to rise, replied, \u00e2\u0080\u0098We are so\nnear the desert that you must not doubt our hospitality.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I was tempted by the first sight of a palm tree to a step too bold; and\nthen sitting by this fountain, I know not how it was----\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098You yielded to our Syrian sun,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said the lady.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098It has been the doom of many; but you, I trust, will not find it\nfatal. Walking in the garden with my maidens, we observed you, and one\nof us covered your head. If you remain in this land you should wear the\nturban.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098This garden seems a paradise,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Tancred. \u00e2\u0080\u0098I had not thought that\nanything so fair could be found among these awful mountains. It is a\nspot that quite becomes Bethany.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098You Franks love Bethany?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Naturally; a place to us most dear and interesting.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Pray, are you of those Franks who worship a Jewess; or of those other\nwho revile her, break her images, and blaspheme her pictures?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I venerate, though I do not adore, the mother of God,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Tancred,\nwith emotion.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Ah! the mother of Jesus!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said his companion. \u00e2\u0080\u0098He is your God. He lived\nmuch in this village. He was a great man, but he was a Jew; and you\nworship him.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098And you do not worship him?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Tancred, looking up to her with an\ninquiring glance, and with a reddening cheek.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098It sometimes seems to me that I ought,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said the lady, \u00e2\u0080\u0098for I am of his\nrace, and you should sympathise with your race.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098You are, then, a Hebrew?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I am of the same blood as Mary whom you venerate, but do not adore.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098You just now observed,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Tancred, after a momentary pause, \u00e2\u0080\u0098that it\nsometimes almost seems to you that you ought to acknowledge my Lord and\nMaster. He made many converts at Bethany, and found here some of his\ngentlest disciples. I wish that you had read the history of his life.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I have read it. The English bishop here has given me the book. It is a\ngood one, written, I observe, entirely by Jews. I find in it many things\nwith which I agree; and if there be some from which I dissent, it may be\nthat I do not comprehend them.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098You are already half a Christian!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Tancred, with animation.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098But the Christianity which I draw from your book does not agree with\nthe Christianity which you practise,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said the lady, \u00e2\u0080\u0098and I fear,\ntherefore, it may be heretical.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098The Christian Church would be your guide.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Which?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 inquired the lady; \u00e2\u0080\u0098there are so many in Jerusalem. There is\nthe good bishop who presented me with this volume, and who is himself a\nHebrew: he is a Church; there is the Latin Church, which was founded\nby a Hebrew; there is the Armenian Church, which belongs to an Eastern\nnation who, like the Hebrews, have lost their country and are scattered\nin every clime; there is the Abyssinian Church, who hold us in great\nhonour, and practise many of our rites and ceremonies; and there are the\nGreek, the Maronite, and the Coptic Churches, who do not favour us,\nbut who do not treat us as grossly as they treat each other. In this\nperplexity it may be wise to remain within the pale of a church older\nthan all of them, the church in which Jesus was born and which he never\nquitted, for he was born a Jew, lived a Jew, and died a Jew; as became\na Prince of the House of David, which you do and must acknowledge him to\nhave been. Your sacred genealogies prove the fact; and if you could not\nestablish it, the whole fabric of your faith falls to the ground.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098If I had no confidence in any Church,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Tancred, with agitation, \u00e2\u0080\u0098I\nwould fall down before God and beseech him to enlighten me; and, in this\nland,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he added, in a tone of excitement, \u00e2\u0080\u0098I cannot believe that the\nappeal to the Mercy-seat would be made in vain.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098But human wit ought to be exhausted before we presume to invoke divine\ninterposition,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said the lady. \u00e2\u0080\u0098I observe that Jesus was as fond of\nasking questions as of performing miracles; an inquiring spirit will\nsolve mysteries. Let me ask you: you think that the present state of my\nrace is penal and miraculous?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nTancred gently bowed assent.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Why do you?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 asked the lady.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098It is the punishment ordained for their rejection and crucifixion of\nthe Messiah.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Where is it ordained?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Upon our heads and upon our children be his blood.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098The criminals said that, not the judge. Is it a principle of your\njurisprudence to permit the guilty to assign their own punishment?\nThey might deserve a severer one. Why should they transfer any of the\ninfliction to their posterity? What evidence have you that Omnipotence\naccepted the offer? It is not so announced in your histories. Your\nevidence is the reverse. He, whom you acknowledge as omnipotent, prayed\nto Jehovah to forgive them on account of their ignorance. But, admit\nthat the offer was accepted, which in my opinion is blasphemy, is the\ncry of a rabble at a public execution to bind a nation? There was\na great party in the country not disinclined to Jesus at the time,\nespecially in the provinces where he had laboured for three years, and\non the whole with success; are they and their children to suffer? But\nyou will say they became Christians. Admit it. We were originally a\nnation of twelve tribes; ten, long before the advent of Jesus, had been\ncarried into captivity and scattered over the East and the Mediterranean\nworld; they are probably the source of the greater portion of the\nexisting Hebrews; for we know that, even in the time of Jesus, Hebrews\ncame up to Jerusalem at the Passover from every province of the Roman\nEmpire. What had they to do with the crucifixion or the rejection?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098The fate of the Ten Tribes is a deeply interesting question,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said\nTancred; \u00e2\u0080\u0098but involved in, I fear, inexplicable-obscurity. In England\nthere are many who hold them to be represented by the Afghans, who state\nthat their ancestors followed the laws of Moses. But perhaps they ceased\nto exist and were blended with their conquerors.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098The Hebrews have never blended with their conquerors,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said the lady,\nproudly. \u00e2\u0080\u0098They were conquered frequently, like all small states situate\namid rival empires. Syria was the battlefield of the great monarchies.\nJerusalem has not been conquered oftener than Athens, or treated worse;\nbut its people, unhappily, fought too bravely and rebelled too often, so\nat last they were expatriated. I hold that, to believe that the Hebrew\ncommunities are in a principal measure the descendants of the Ten\nTribes, and of the other captivities preceding Christ, is a just,\nand fair, and sensible inference, which explains circumstances that\notherwise could not be explicable. But let that pass. We will suppose\nall the Jews in all the cities of the world to be the lineal descendants\nof the mob who shouted at the crucifixion. Yet another question! My\ngrandfather is a Bedouin sheikh, chief of one of the most powerful\ntribes of the desert. My mother was his daughter. He is a Jew; his whole\ntribe are Jews; they read and obey the five books, live in tents, have\nthousands of camels, ride horses of the Nedjed breed, and care for\nnothing except Jehovah, Moses, and their mares. Were they at Jerusalem\nat the crucifixion, and does the shout of the rabble touch them? Yet my\nmother marries a Hebrew of the cities, and a man, too, fit to sit on the\nthrone of King Solomon; and a little Christian Yahoor with a round hat,\nwho sells figs at Smyrna, will cross the street if he see her, lest he\nshould be contaminated by the blood of one who crucified his Saviour;\nhis Saviour being, by his own statement, one of the princes of our royal\nhouse. No; I will never become a Christian, if I am to eat such sand! It\nis not to be found in your books. They were written by Jews, men far\ntoo well acquainted with their subject to indite such tales of the\nPhilistines as these!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nTancred looked at her with deep interest as her eye flashed fire, and\nher beautiful cheek was for a moment suffused with the crimson cloud of\nindignant passion; and then he said, \u00e2\u0080\u0098You speak of things that deeply\ninterest me, or I should not be in this land. But tell me: it cannot\nbe denied that, whatever the cause, the miracle exists; and that the\nHebrews, alone of the ancient races, remain, and are found in every\ncountry, a memorial of the mysterious and mighty past.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Their state may be miraculous without being penal. But why miraculous?\nIs it a miracle that Jehovah should guard his people? And can He guard\nthem better than by endowing them with faculties superior to those of\nthe nations among whom they dwell?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I cannot believe that merely human agencies could have sustained a\ncareer of such duration and such vicissitudes.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098As for human agencies, we have a proverb: \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe will of man is the\nservant of God.\u00e2\u0080\u009d But if you wish to make a race endure, rely upon it\nyou should expatriate them. Conquer them, and they may blend with\ntheir conquerors; exile them, and they will live apart and for ever.\nTo expatriate is purely oriental, quite unknown to the modern world. We\nwere speaking of the Armenians, they are Christians, and good ones, I\nbelieve.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I have understood very orthodox.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 \u00e2\u0080\u0098Go to Armenia, and you will not find\nan Armenian. They, too, are an expatriated nation, like the Hebrews. The\nPersians conquered their land, and drove out the people. The Armenian\nhas a proverb: \u00e2\u0080\u009cIn every city of the East I find a home.\u00e2\u0080\u009d They are\neverywhere; the rivals of my people, for they are one of the great\nraces, and little degenerated: with all our industry, and much of our\nenergy; I would say, with all our human virtues, though it cannot be\nexpected that they should possess our divine qualities; they have not\nproduced Gods and prophets, and are proud that they can trace up their\nfaith to one of the obscurest of the Hebrew apostles, and who never knew\nhis great master.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098But the Armenians are found only in the East,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Tancred.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Ah!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said the lady, with a sarcastic smile; \u00e2\u0080\u0098it is exile to Europe,\nthen, that is the curse: well, I think you have some reason. I do not\nknow much of your quarter of the globe: Europe is to Asia what America\nis to Europe. But I have felt the winds of the Exuine blowing up the\nBosphorus; and, when the Sultan was once going to cut off our heads for\nhelping the Egyptians, I passed some months at Vienna. Oh! how I sighed\nfor my beautiful Damascus!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098And for your garden at Bethany?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Tancred.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098It did not exist then. This is a recent creation,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said the lady. \u00e2\u0080\u0098I\nhave built a nest in the chink of the hills, that I might look upon\nArabia; and the palm tree that invited you to honour my domain was the\ncontribution of my Arab grandfather to the only garden near Jerusalem.\nBut I want to ask you another question. What, on the whole, is the thing\nmost valued in Europe?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nTancred pondered; and, after a slight pause, said, \u00e2\u0080\u0098I think I know what\nought to be most valued in Europe; it is something very different from\nwhat I fear I must confess is most valued there. My cheek burns while I\nsay it; but I think, in Europe, what is most valued is money.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098On the whole,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said the lady, \u00e2\u0080\u0098he that has most money there is most\nhonoured?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Practically, I apprehend so.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Which is the greatest city in Europe?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Without doubt, the capital of my country, London.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Greater I know it is than Vienna; but is it greater than Paris?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Perhaps double the size of Paris.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098And four times that of Stamboul! What a city! Why \u00e2\u0080\u0098tis Babylon! How\nrich the most honoured man must be there! Tell me, is he a Christian?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I believe he is one of your race and faith.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 \u00e2\u0080\u0098And in Paris; who is the\nrichest man in Paris?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 \u00e2\u0080\u0098The brother, I believe, of the richest man in\nLondon.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I know all about Vienna,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said the lady, smiling. \u00e2\u0080\u0098C\u00c3\u00a6sar makes my\ncountrymen barons of the empire, and rightly, for it would fall to\npieces in a week without their support. Well, you must admit that the\nEuropean part of the curse has not worked very fatally.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I do not see,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Tancred thoughtfully, after a short pause, \u00e2\u0080\u0098that\nthe penal dispersion of the Hebrew nation is at all essential to the\ngreat object of the Christian scheme. If a Jew did not exist, that would\nequally have been obtained.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098And what do you hold to be the essential object of the Christian\nscheme?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 \u00e2\u0080\u0098The Expiation.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Ah!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said the lady, in a tone of much solemnity, \u00e2\u0080\u0098that is a great idea;\nin harmony with our instincts, with our traditions, our customs. It\nis deeply impressed upon the convictions of this land. Shaped as you\nChristians offer the doctrine, it loses none of its sublimity; or its\nassociations, full at the same time of mystery, power, and solace. A\nsacrificial Mediator with Jehovah, that expiatory intercessor born from\nthe chosen house of the chosen people, yet blending in his inexplicable\nnature the divine essence with the human elements, appointed before all\ntime, and purifying, by his atoning blood, the myriads that preceded and\nthe myriads that will follow us, without distinction of creed or clime,\nthis is what you believe. I acknowledge the vast conception, dimly as my\nbrain can partially embrace it. I understand thus much: the human race\nis saved; and, without the apparent agency of a Hebrew prince, it could\nnot have been saved. Now tell me: suppose the Jews had not prevailed\nupon the Romans to crucify Jesus, what would have become of the\nAtonement?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I cannot permit myself to contemplate such contingencies,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said\nTancred. \u00e2\u0080\u0098The subject is too high for me to touch with speculation.\nI must not even consider an event that had been pre-ordained by the\nCreator of the world for countless ages.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Ah!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said the lady; \u00e2\u0080\u0098pre-ordained by the Creator of the world for\ncountless ages! Where, then, was the inexpiable crime of those who\nfulfilled the beneficent intention? The holy race supplied the victim\nand the immolators. What other race could have been entrusted with such\na consummation? Was not Abraham prepared to sacrifice even his son? And\nwith such a doctrine, that embraces all space and time; nay more, chaos\nand eternity; with divine persons for the agents, and the redemption of\nthe whole family of man for the subject; you can mix up the miserable\npersecution of a single race! And this is practical, not doctrinal\nChristianity. It is not found in your Christian books, which were all\nwritten by Jews; it must have been made by some of those Churches to\nwhich you have referred me. Persecute us! Why, if you believe what you\nprofess, you should kneel to us! You raise statues to the hero who saves\na country. We have saved the human race, and you persecute us for doing\nit.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I am no persecutor,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Tancred, with emotion; \u00e2\u0080\u0098and, had I been so,\nmy visit to Bethany would have cleansed my heart of such dark thoughts.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098We have some conclusions in common,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said his companion, rising. \u00e2\u0080\u0098We\nagree that half Christendom worships a Jewess, and the other half a\nJew. Now let me ask one more question. Which is the superior race, the\nworshipped or the worshippers?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nTancred looked up to reply, but the lady had disappeared.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVII.\n\n     _Fakredeen and the Rose of Sharon_\n\nBEFORE Tancred could recover from his surprise, the kiosk was invaded\nby a crowd of little grinning negro pages, dressed in white tunics, with\nred caps and slippers. They bore a number of diminutive trays of ebony\ninlaid with tortoiseshell, and the mother-o\u00e2\u0080\u0099-pearl of Joppa, and covered\nwith a great variety of dishes. It was in vain that he would have\nsignified to them that he had no wish to partake of the banquet, and\nthat he attempted to rise from his mat. They understood nothing that he\nsaid, but always grinning and moving about him with wonderful quickness,\nthey fastened a napkin of the finest linen, fringed with gold, round his\nneck, covered the mats and the border of the fountain with their\ndishes and vases of differently-coloured sherbets, and proceeded,\nnotwithstanding all his attempts at refusal, to hand him their dainties\nin due order. Notwithstanding his present tone of mind, which was\nill-adapted to any carnal gratification, Tancred had nevertheless been\nan unusual number of hours without food. He had made during the period\nno inconsiderable exertion, and was still some distance from the\ncity. Though he resigned himself perforce to the care of his little\nattendants, their solicitude therefore was not inappropriate. He\npartook of some of their dishes, and when he had at length succeeded\nin conveying to them his resolution to taste no more, they cleared the\nkiosk with as marvellous a celerity as they had stored it, and then two\nof them advanced with a nargileh and a chibouque, to offer their choice\nto their guest. Tan-cred placed the latter for a moment to his mouth,\nand then rising, and making signs to the pages that he would now return,\nthey danced before him in the path till he had reached the other side\nof the area of roses, and then, with a hundred bows, bending, they took\ntheir leave of him.\n\nThe sun had just sunk as Tancred quitted the garden: a crimson glow,\nshifting, as he proceeded, into rich tints of purple and of gold,\nsuffused the stern Jud\u00c3\u00a6an hills, and lent an almost supernatural lustre\nto the landscape; lighting up the wild gorges, gilding the distant\nglens, and still kindling the superior elevations with its living blaze.\nThe air, yet fervid, was freshened by a slight breeze that came over the\nwilderness from the Jordan, and the big round stars that were already\nfloating in the skies were the brilliant heralds of the splendour of\na Syrian night. The beauteous hour and the sacred scene were alike in\nunison with the heart of Tancred, softened and serious. He mused in\nfascinated reverie over the dazzling incident of the day. Who was this\nlady of Bethany, who seemed not unworthy to have followed Him who had\nmade her abiding place so memorable? Her beauty might have baffled the\nmost ideal painter of the fair Hebrew saints. Raffaelle himself could\nnot have designed a brow of more delicate supremacy. Her lofty but\ngracious bearing, the vigour of her clear, frank mind, her earnestness,\nfree from all ecstasy and flimsy enthusiasm, but founded in knowledge\nand deep thought, and ever sustained by exact expression and ready\nargument, her sweet witty voice, the great and all-engaging theme on\nwhich she was so content to discourse, and which seemed by right to\nbelong to her: all these were circumstances which wonderfully affected\nthe imagination of Tancred.\n\nHe was lost in the empyrean of high abstraction, his gaze apparently\nfixed on the purple mountains, and the golden skies, and the glittering\norbs of coming night, which yet in truth he never saw, when a repeated\nshout at length roused him. It bade him stand aside on the narrow path\nthat winds round the Mount of Olives from Jerusalem to Bethany, and let\na coming horseman pass. The horseman was the young Emir who was a guest\nthe night before in the divan of Besso. Though habited in the Mamlouk\ndress, as if only the attendant of some great man, huge trousers and\njacket of crimson cloth, a white turban, a shawl round his waist holding\nhis pistols and sabre, the horse he rode was a Kochlani of the highest\nbreed., By him was a running footman, holding his nargileh, to which\nthe Emir frequently applied his mouth as he rode along. He shot a keen\nglance at Tancred as he passed by, and then throwing his tube to his\nattendant, he bounded on.\n\nIn the meantime, we must not forget the lady of Bethany after she so\nsuddenly disappeared from the kiosk. Proceeding up her mountain garden,\nwhich narrowed as she advanced, and attended by two female slaves, who\nhad been in waiting without the kiosk, she was soon in that hilly chink\nin which she had built her nest; a long, low pavilion, with a shelving\nroof, and surrounded by a Saracenic arcade; the whole painted in fresco;\na golden pattern of flowing fancy on a white ground. If there were door\nor window, they were entirely concealed by the blinds which appeared to\ncover the whole surface of the building. Stepping into the arcade, the\nlady entered the pavilion by a side portal, which opened by a secret\nspring, and which conducted her into a small corridor, and this again\nthrough two chambers, in both of which were many females, who mutely\nsaluted her without rising from their employments.\n\nThen the mistress entered a more capacious and ornate apartment.\nIts ceiling, which described the horseshoe arch of the Saracens, was\nencrusted with that honeycomb work which is peculiar to them, and which,\nin the present instance, was of rose colour and silver. Mirrors were\ninserted in the cedar panels of the walls; a divan of rose-coloured silk\nsurrounded the chamber, and on the thick soft carpet of many colours,\nwhich nearly covered the floor, were several cushions surrounding an\nantique marble tripod of wreathed serpents. The lady, disembarrassing\nherself of her slippers, seated herself on the divan in the fashion of\nher country; one of her attendants brought a large silver lamp, which\ndiffused a delicious odour as well as a brilliant light, and placed\nit on the tripod; the other clapped her hands, and a band of beautiful\ngirls entered the room, bearing dishes of confectionery, plates of\nchoice fruits, and vases of delicious sherbets. The lady, partaking of\nsome of these, directed, after a short time, that they should be offered\nto her immediate attendants, who thereupon kissed their hands with a\ngrave face, and pressed them to their hearts. Then one of the girls,\nleaving the apartment for a moment, returned with a nargileh of crystal,\nset by the most cunning artists of Damascus in a framework of golden\nfiligree crusted with precious stones. She presented the flexible silver\ntube, tipped with amber, to the lady, who, waving her hand that the room\nshould be cleared, smoked a confection of roses and rare nuts, while she\nlistened to a volume read by one of her maidens, who was seated by the\nsilver lamp.\n\nWhile they were thus employed, an opposite curtain to that by which they\nhad entered was drawn aside, and a woman advanced, and whispered some\nwords to the lady, who seemed to signify her assent. Immediately, a tall\nnegro of Dongola, richly habited in a flowing crimson vest, and with\na large silver collar round his neck, entered the hall, and, after the\nusual salutations of reverence to the lady, spoke earnestly in a low\nvoice. The lady listened with great attention, and then, taking out her\ntablets from her girdle, she wrote a few words and gave a leaf to the\ntall negro, who bowed and retired. Then she waved her hand, and the\nmaiden who was reading closed her book, rose, and, pressing her hand to\nher heart, retired.\n\nIt seemed that the young Emir had arrived at the pavilion, and prayed\nthat, without a moment\u00e2\u0080\u0099s delay, he might speak with the Lady of Bethany.\n\nThe curtain was again withdrawn, a light step was heard, the young man\nwho had recently passed Tancred on the road to Jerusalem bounded into\nthe room.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098How is the Rose of Sharon?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he exclaimed. He threw himself at her feet,\nand pressed the hem of her garment to his lips with an ecstasy which\nit would have been difficult for a bystander to decide whether it were\nmockery or enthusiasm, or genuine feeling, which took a sportive air to\nveil a devotion which it could not conceal, and which it cared not too\ngravely to intimate.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Ah, Fakredeen!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said the lady, \u00e2\u0080\u0098and when did you leave the Mountain?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I arrived at Jerusalem yesterday by sunset; never did I want to see you\nso much. The foreign consuls have stopped my civil war, which cost me a\nhundred thousand piastres. We went down to Beiroot and signed articles\nof peace; I thought it best to attend to escape suspicion. However,\nthere is more stirring than you can conceive: never had I such\ncombinations! First, let me shortly tell you what I have done, then what\nI wish you to do. I have made immense hits, but I am also in a scrape.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098That I think you always are,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said the lady.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098But you will get me out of it, Rose of Sharon! You always do, brightest\nand sweetest of friends! What an alliance is ours! My invention, your\njudgment; my combinations, your criticism. It must carry everything\nbefore it.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I do not see that it has effected much hitherto,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said the lady.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\nHowever, give me your mountain news. What have you done?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098In the first place,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Fakredeen, \u00e2\u0080\u0098until this accursed peace\nintrigue of the foreign consuls, which will not last as long as the\ncarnival, the Mountain was more troubled than ever, and the Porte,\nbacked up by Sir Canning, is obstinate against any prince of our house\nexercising the rule.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Do you call that good news?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098It serves. In the first place it keeps my good uncle, the Emir Bescheer\nand his sons, prisoners at the Seven Towers. Now, I will tell you what I\nhave done. I have sent to my uncle and offered him two hundred thousand\npiastres a year for his life and that of his sons, if they will\nrepresent to the Porte that none but a prince of the house of Shehaab\ncan possibly pacify and administer Lebanon, and that, to obtain this\nnecessary end, they are ready to resign their rights in favour of any\nother member of the family.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098What then?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said the Lady of Bethany, taking her nargileh from her\nmouth.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Why, then,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Fakredeen, \u00e2\u0080\u0098I am by another agent working upon Riza\nPasha to this effect, that of all the princes of the great house of\nShehaab, there is none so well adapted to support the interests of the\nPorte as the Emir Fakredeen, and for these three principal reasons: in\nthe first place, because he is a prince of great qualities----\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Your proof of them to the vizir would be better than your assertion.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Exactly,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Fakredeen. \u00e2\u0080\u0098I prove them by my second reason, which is a\nguaranty to his excellency of the whole revenue of the first year of my\nprincedom, provided I receive the berat.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I can tell you something,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said the lady, \u00e2\u0080\u0098Riza shakes a little. He is\ntoo fond of first-fruits. His nomination will not be popular.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Yes it will, when the divan takes into consideration the third reason\nfor my appointment,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said the prince. \u00e2\u0080\u0098Namely, that the Emir Fakredeen\nis the only prince of the great house of Shehaab who is a good\nMussulman.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098You a good Mussulman! Why, I thought you had sent two months ago\nArchbishop Murad to Paris, urging King Louis to support you, because,\namongst other reasons, being a Christian prince, you would defend the\nfaith and privileges of the Maronites.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098And devote myself to France,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Fakredeen. \u00e2\u0080\u0098It is very true, and an\nexcellent combination it is, if we could only bring it to bear, which I\ndo not despair of, though affairs, which looked promising at Paris, have\ntaken an unfortunate turn of late.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I am sorry for that,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said the lady, \u00e2\u0080\u0098for really, Fakredeen, of all\nyour innumerable combinations, that did seem to me to be the most\npractical. I think it might have been worked. The Maronites are\npowerful; the French nation is interested in them; they are the link\nbetween France and Syria; and you, being a Christian prince as well as\nan emir of the most illustrious house, with your intelligence and such\naid as we might give you, I think your prospects were, to say the least,\nfair.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Why, as to being a Christian prince, Eva, you must remember I aspire to\na dominion where I have to govern the Maronites who are Christians,\nthe Metoualis who are Mahometans, the Ansareys who are Pagans, and the\nDruses who are nothing. As for-myself, my house, as you well know, is\nmore ancient even than that of Othman. We are literally descended from\nthe standard-bearer of the Prophet, and my own estates, as well as those\nof the Emir Bes-cheer, have been in our registered possession for nearly\neight hundred years. Our ancestors became Christians to conciliate the\nMaronites. Now tell me: in Europe, an English or French prince who wants\na throne never hesitates to change his religion, why should I be more\nnice? I am of that religion which gives me a sceptre; and if a Frank\nprince adopts a new creed when he quits London or Paris, I cannot\nunderstand why mine may not change according to the part of the mountain\nthrough which I am passing. What is the use of belonging to an old\nfamily unless to have the authority of an ancestor ready for any\nprejudice, religious or political, which your combinations may require?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Ah! Fakredeen,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said the lady, shaking her head, \u00e2\u0080\u0098you have no\nself-respect.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098No Syrian has; it won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t do for us. You are an Arabian; it will do for\nthe desert. Self-respect, too, is a superstition of past centuries, an\naffair of the Crusades. It is not suited to these times; it is much\ntoo arrogant, too self-conceited, too egotistical. No one is important\nenough to have self-respect. Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you see?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098You boast of being a prince inferior to none in the antiquity of your\nlineage, and, as far as the mere fact is concerned, you are justified\nin your boast. I cannot comprehend how one who feels this pride should\ndeign to do anything that is not princely.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098A prince!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 exclaimed Fakredeen. \u00e2\u0080\u0098Princes go for nothing now, without\na loan. Get me a loan, and then you turn the prince into a government.\nThat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the thing.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098You will never get a loan till you are Emir of Lebanon,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said the lady.\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098And you have shown me to-day that the only chance you have is failing\nyou, for, after all, Paris was your hope. What has crossed you?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098In the first place,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Fakredeen, \u00e2\u0080\u0098what can the French do? After\nhaving let the Egyptians be driven out, fortunately for me, for their\nexpulsion ruined my uncle, the French will never take the initiative in\nSyria. All that I wanted of them was, that they should not oppose Riza\nPasha in his nomination of me. But to secure his success a finer move\nwas necessary. So I instructed Archbishop Murad, whom they received very\nwell at Paris, to open secret communications over the water with the\nEnglish. He did so, and offered to cross and explain in detail to their\nministers. I wished to assure them in London that I was devoted to\ntheir interests; and I meant to offer to let the Protestant missionaries\nestablish themselves in the mountain, so that Sir Canning should have\nreceived instructions to support my nomination by Riza. Then you see,\nI should have had the Porte, England, and France. The game was won. Can\nyou believe it? Lord Aberdeen enclosed my agent\u00e2\u0080\u0099s letter to Guizot. I\nwas crushed.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098And disgraced. You deserved it. You never will succeed. Intrigue will\nbe your ruin, Fakredeen.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Intrigue!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 exclaimed the prince, starting from the cushion near the\ntripod, on which he sat, speaking with great animation and using, as\nwas his custom, a superfluity of expression, both of voice and hands\nand eyes, \u00e2\u0080\u0098intrigue! It is life! It is the only thing! How do you think\nGuizot and Aberdeen got to be ministers without intrigue? Or Riza Pasha\nhimself? How do you think Mehemet Ali got on? Do you believe Sir Canning\nnever intrigues? He would be recalled in a week if he did not. Why, I\nhave got one of his spies in my castle at this moment, and I make\nhim write home for the English all that I wish them not to believe.\nIntrigue! Why, England won India by intrigue. Do you think they are not\nintriguing in the Punjaub at this moment? Intrigue has gained half the\nthrones of Europe: Greece, France, Belgium, Portugal, Spain, Russia. If\nyou wish to produce a result, you must make combinations; and you call\ncombinations, Eva, intrigue!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098And this is the scrape that you are in,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said the lady. \u00e2\u0080\u0098I do not see\nhow I can help you out of it.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Pardon; this is not the scrape: and here comes the point on which I\nneed your aid, daughter of a thousand sheikhs! I can extricate myself\nfrom the Paris disaster, even turn it to account. I have made an\nalliance with the patriarch of the Lebanon, who manages affairs for the\nEmir Bescheer. The patriarch hates Murad, whom you see I was to have\nmade patriarch. I am to declare the Archbishop an unauthorised agent,\nan adventurer, and my letter to be a forgery. The patriarch is to go\nto Stamboul, with his long white beard, and put me right with France,\nthrough De Bourqueney, with whom he has relations in favour of the Emir\nBescheer; my uncle is to be thrown over; all the Maronite chiefs are\nto sign a declaration supplicating the Porte to institute me; nay, the\ndeclaration is signed----\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098And the Druses? Will not this Maronite manifestation put you wrong with\nthe Druses?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I live among the Druses, you see,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Fakredeen, shaking his head,\nand looking with his glittering eye a thousand meanings. \u00e2\u0080\u0098The Druses\nlove me. They know that I am one of themselves. They will only think\nthat I have made the Maronites eat sand.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098And what have you really done for the Maronites to gain all this?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\nasked the lady, quietly.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098There it is,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Fakredeen, speaking in an affected whisper, \u00e2\u0080\u0098the\ngreatest stroke of state that ever entered the mind of a king without\na kingdom, for I am resolved that the mountain shall be a royalty I You\nremember when Ibrahim Pasha laid his plans for disarming the Lebanon,\nthe Maronites, urged by their priests, fell into the snare, while the\nDruses wisely went with their muskets and scimitars, and lived awhile\nwith the eagle and the antelope. This has been sand to the Maronites\never since. The Druses put their tongues in their cheek whenever they\nmeet, and treat them as so many women. The Porte, of course, will do\nnothing for the Maronites; they even take back the muskets which they\nlent them for the insurrection. Well, as the Porte will not arm them, I\nhave agreed to do it.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098You!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098\u00e2\u0080\u0099Tis done; at least the caravan is laden; we only want a guide.\nAnd this is why I am at Jerusalem. Scheriff Effendi, who met me here\nyesterday, has got me five thousand English muskets, and I have arranged\nwith the Bedouin of Zoalia to carry them to the mountain.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098You have indeed Solomon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s signet, my dear Fakredeen.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Would that I had; for then I could pay two hundred thousand piastres\nto that Egyptian camel, Scheriff Effendi, and he would give me up my\nmuskets, which now, like a true son of Eblis, he obstinately retains.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098And this is your scrape, Fakredeen. And how much have you towards the\nsum?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Not a piastre; nor do I suppose I shall ever see, until I make a great\nfinancial stroke, so much of the sultan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s gold as is on one of the gilt\nballs of roses in your nargileh. My crops are sold for next year, my\njewels are gone, my studs are to be broken up. There is not a cur in the\nstreets of Beiroot of whom I have not borrowed money. Riza Pasha is a\nsponge that would dry the sea of Galilee.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098It is a great thing to have gained the Patriarch of Lebanon,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said\nthe lady; \u00e2\u0080\u0098I always felt that, as long as that man was against you, the\nMaronites never could be depended on. And yet these arms; after all,\nthey are of no use, for you would not think of insurrection!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098No; but they can quarrel with the Druses, and cut each other\u00e2\u0080\u0099s throats,\nand this will make the mountain more unmanageable than ever, and the\nEnglish will have no customers for their calicoes, don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you see? Lord\nPalmerston will arraign the minister in the council. I shall pay off\nAberdeen for enclosing the Archbishop\u00e2\u0080\u0099s letter to Guizot. Combination\nupon combination! The calico merchants will call out for a prince of the\nhouse of Shehaab! Riza will propose me; Bourqueney will not murmur, and\nSir Canning, finding he is in a mess, will sign a fine note of words\nabout the peace of Europe and the prosperity of Lebanon, and \u00e2\u0080\u0098tis\nfinished.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098And my father, you have seen him?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I have seen him,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said the young Emir, and he cast his eyes on the\nground.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098He has done so much,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Eva.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Ask him to do more, Rose of Sharon,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Fakredeen, like a child about\nto cry for a toy, and he threw himself on his knees before Eva, and kept\nkissing her robe. \u00e2\u0080\u0098Ask him to do more,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he repeated, in a suppressed\ntone of heart-rending cajolery; \u00e2\u0080\u0098he can refuse you nothing. Ask him, ask\nhim, Eva! I have no friend in the world but you; I am so desolate.\nYou have always been my friend, my counsellor, my darling, my ruby, my\npearl, my rose of Rocnabad! Ask him, Eva; never mind my faults; you\nknow me by heart; only ask him!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nShe shook her head.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Tell him that you are my sister, that I am his son, that I love you\nso, that I love him so; tell him anything. Say that he ought to do it\nbecause I am a Hebrew.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098A what?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Eva.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098A Hebrew; yes, a Hebrew. I am a Hebrew by blood, and we all are by\nfaith.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Thou son of a slave!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 exclaimed the lady, \u00e2\u0080\u0098thou masquerade of humanity!\nChristian or Mussulman, Pagan or Druse, thou mayest figure as; but spare\nmy race, Fakredeen, they are fallen----\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098But not so base as I am. It may be true, but I love you, Eva, and you\nlove me; and if I had as many virtues as yourself, you could not love\nme more; perhaps less. Women like to feel their superiority; you are\nas clever as I am, and have more judgment; you are generous, and I am\nselfish; honourable, and I am a villain; brave, and I am a coward; rich,\nand I am poor. Let that satisfy you, and do not trample on the fallen;\u00e2\u0080\u0099\nand Fakredeen took her hand and bedewed it with his tears.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Dear Fakredeen,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Eva, \u00e2\u0080\u0098I thought you spoke in jest, as I did.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098How can a man jest, who has to go through what I endure!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said the\nyoung Emir, in a desponding tone, and still lying at her feet. \u00e2\u0080\u0098O, my\nmore than sister, \u00e2\u0080\u0098tis hell! The object I propose to myself would, with\nthe greatest resources, be difficult; and now I have none.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Relinquish it.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098When I am young and ruined! When I have the two greatest stimulants in\nthe world to action, Youth and Debt! No; such a combination is never to\nbe thrown away. Any young prince ought to win the Lebanon, but a young\nprince in debt ought to conquer the world!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 and the Emir sprang from the\nfloor, and began walking about the apartment.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I think, Eva,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he said, after a moment\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pause, and speaking in his\nusual tone, \u00e2\u0080\u0098I think you really might do something with your father; I\nlook upon myself as his son; he saved my life. And I am a Hebrew; I\nwas nourished by your mother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s breast, her being flows in my veins;\nand independent of all that, my ancestor was the standard-bearer of the\nProphet, and the Prophet was the descendant of Ishmael, and Ishmael\nand Israel were brothers. I really think, between my undoubted Arabian\norigin and being your foster-brother, that I may be looked upon as a\nJew, and that your father might do something for me.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Whatever my father will do, you and he must decide together,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Eva;\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098after the result of my last interference, I promised my father that I\nnever would speak to him on your affairs again; and you know, therefore,\nthat I cannot. You ought not to urge me, Fakredeen.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Ah! you are angry with me,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he exclaimed, and again seated himself\nat her feet. \u00e2\u0080\u0098You were saying in your heart, he is the most selfish of\nbeings. It is true, I am. But I have glorious aspirations at least. I am\nnot content to live like my fathers in a beautiful palace, amid my woods\nand mountains, with Kochlani steeds, falcons that would pull down an\neagle, and nargilehs of rubies and emeralds. I want something more than\ntroops of beautiful slaves, music and dances. I want Europe to talk of\nme. I am wearied of hearing nothing but Ibrahim Pasha, Louis Philippe,\nand Palmerston. I, too, can make combinations; and I am of a better\nfamily than all three, for Ibrahim is a child of mud, a Bourbon is not\nequal to a Shehaab, and Lord Palmerston only sits in the Queen\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nsecond chamber of council, as I well know from an Englishman who was at\nBeiroot, and with whom I have formed some political relations, of which\nperhaps some day you will hear.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Well, we have arrived at a stage of your career, Fakredeen, in which no\ncombination presents itself; I am powerless to assist you; my resources,\nnever very great, are quite exhausted.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098No,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said the Emir, \u00e2\u0080\u0098the game is yet to be won. Listen, Rose of Sharon,\nfor this is really the point on which I came to hold counsel. A young\nEnglish lord has arrived at Jerusalem this week or ten days past; he\nis of the highest dignity, and rich enough to buy the grand bazaar of\nDamascus; he has letters of credit on your father\u00e2\u0080\u0099s house without\nany limit. No one can discover the object of his mission. I have some\nsuspicions; there is also a French officer here who never speaks; I\nwatch them both. The Englishman, I learnt this morning, is going to\nMount Sinai. It is not a pilgrimage, because the English are really\nneither Jews nor Christians, but follow a sort of religion of their own,\nwhich is made every year by their bishops, one of whom they have sent\nto Jerusalem, in what they call a parliament, a college of muftis; you\nunderstand. Now lend me that ear that is like an almond of Aleppo! I\npropose that one of the tribes that obey your grandfather shall make\nthis Englishman prisoner as he traverses the desert. You see? Ah! Rose\nof Sharon, I am not yet beat; your Fakredeen is not the baffled boy\nthat, a few minutes ago, you looked as if you thought him. I defy\nIbrahim, or the King of France, or Palmerston himself, to make a\ncombination superior to this. What a ransom! The English lord will pay\nScheriff Effendi for his five thousand muskets, and for their conveyance\nto the mountain besides.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVIII.\n\n     _Besso, the Banker_\n\nIN ONE of those civil broils at Damascus which preceded the fall of the\nJanissaries, an Emir of the house of Shehaab, who lost his life in the\nfray, had, in the midst of the convulsion, placed his infant son in the\ncharge of the merchant Besso, a child most dear to him, not only because\nthe babe was his heir, but because his wife, whom he passionately\nloved, a beautiful lady of Antioch and of one of the old families of the\ncountry, had just sacrificed her life in giving birth to their son.\n\nThe wife of Besso placed the orphan infant at her own breast, and the\nyoung Fakredeen was brought up in every respect as a child of the house;\nso that, for some time, he looked upon the little Eva, who was three\nyears younger than himself, as his sister. When Fakredeen had\nattained an age of sufficient intelligence for the occasion and the\ncircumstances, his real position was explained to him; but he was still\ntoo young for the communication to effect any change in his feelings,\nand the idea that Eva was not his sister only occasioned him sorrow,\nuntil his grief was forgotten when he found that the change made no\ndifference in their lives or their love.\n\nSoon after the violent death of the father of Fakredeen, affairs had\nbecome more tranquil, and Besso had not neglected the interests of his\ncharge. The infant was heir to a large estate in the Lebanon; a fine\ncastle, an illimitable forest, and cultivated lands, whose produce,\nchiefly silk, afforded a revenue sufficient to maintain the not\ninconsiderable state of a mountain prince.\n\nWhen Fakredeen was about ten years of age, his relative the Emir\nBescheer, who then exercised a sovereign and acknowledged sway over all\nthe tribes of the Lebanon, whatever their religion or race, signified\nhis pleasure that his kinsman should be educated at his court, in the\ncompany of his sons. So Fakredeen, with many tears, quitted his happy\nhome at Damascus, and proceeded to Beteddeen, the beautiful palace of\nhis uncle, situate among the mountains in the neighbourhood of Beiroot.\nThis was about the time that the Egyptians were effecting the conquest\nof Syria, and both the Emir Bescheer, the head of the house of\nShehaab as well as Prince of the Mountain, and the great commercial\nconfederation of the brothers Besso, had declared in favour of the\ninvader, and were mainly instrumental to the success of Mehemet Ali.\nPolitical sympathy, and the feelings of mutual dependence which\nunited the Emir Bescheer and the merchant of Damascus, rendered\nthe communications between the families so frequent that it was not\ndifficult for the family of Besso to cherish those sentiments of\naffection which were strong and lively in the heart of the young\nFakredeen, but which, under any circumstances, depend so much on\nsustained personal intercourse. Eva saw a great deal of her former\nbrother, and there subsisted between them a romantic friendship. He\nwas their frequent guest at Damascus and was proud to show her how he\nexcelled in his martial exercises, how skilful he was with his falcon,\nand what horses of pure race he proudly rode.\n\nIn the year \u00e2\u0080\u009839, Fakredeen being then fifteen years of age, the country\nentirely tranquil, even if discontented, occupied by a disciplined\narmy of 80,000 men, commanded by captains equal it was supposed to any\nconjuncture, the Egyptians openly encouraged by the greatest military\nnation of Europe, the Turks powerless, and only secretly sustained by\nthe countenance of the ambassador of the weakest government that ever\ntottered in England, a government that had publicly acknowledged that\nit had forfeited the confidence of the Parliament which yet it did\nnot dissolve; everything being thus in a state of flush and affluent\nprosperity, and both the house of Shehaab and the house of Besso\nfeeling, each day more strongly, how discreet and how lucky they had\nbeen in the course which they had adopted, came the great Syrian crash!\n\nWhatever difference of opinion may exist as to the policy pursued by\nthe foreign minister of England, with respect to the settlement of the\nTurkish Empire in 1840-41, none can be permitted, by those, at least,\ncompetent to decide upon such questions, as to the ability with which\nthat policy was accomplished. When we consider the position of the\nminister at home, not only deserted by Parliament, but abandoned by his\nparty and even forsaken by his colleagues; the military occupation\nof Syria by the Egyptians; the rabid demonstration of France; that an\naccident of time or space, the delay of a month or the gathering of a\nstorm, might alone have baffled all his combinations, it is difficult to\nfix upon a page in the history of this country which records a superior\ninstance of moral intrepidity. The bold conception and the brilliant\nperformance were worthy of Chatham; but the domestic difficulties with\nwhich Lord Palmerston had to struggle place the exploit beyond the\nhappiest achievement of the elder Pitt. Throughout the memorable\nconjuncture, Lord Palmerston, however, had one great advantage, which\nwas invisible to the millions; he was served by a most vigilant and able\ndiplomacy. The superiority of his information concerning the state of\nSyria to that furnished to the French minister was the real means\nby which he baffled the menaced legions of our neighbours. A timid\nSecretary of State in the position of Lord Palmerston, even with such\nadvantages, might have faltered; but the weapon was placed in the hands\nof one who did not shrink from its exercise, and the expulsion of\nthe Egyptians from Turkey remains a great historic monument alike of\ndiplomatic skill and administrative energy.\n\nThe rout of the Egyptians was fatal to the Emir Bescheer, and it seemed\nalso, for a time, to the Damascus branch of the family of Besso. But in\nthese days a great capitalist has deeper roots than a sovereign prince,\nunless he is very legitimate. The Prince of the Mountain and his\nsons were summoned from their luxurious and splendid Beteddeen to\nConstantinople, where they have ever since remained prisoners. Young\nFakredeen, the moment he heard of the fall of Acre, rode out with his\nfalcon, as if for the pastime of a morning, and the moment he was out of\nsight made for the desert, and never rested until he reached the tents\nof the children of Rechab, where he placed himself under the protection\nof the grandfather of Eva.\n\nAs for the merchant himself, having ships at his command, he contrived\nto escape with his wife and his young daughter to Trieste, and he\nremained in the Austrian dominions between three and four years.\nAt length the influence of Prince Metternich, animated by Sidonia,\npropitiated the Porte. Adarfi Besso, after making his submission at\nStamboul, and satisfactorily explaining his conduct to Riza Pasha,\nreturned to his country, not substantially injured in fortune, though\nthe northern clime had robbed him of his Arabian wife; for his brothers,\nwho, as far as politics were concerned, had ever kept in the shade, had\nmanaged affairs in the absence of the more prominent member of their\nhouse, and, in truth, the family of Besso were too rich to be long under\na cloud. The Pasha of Damascus found his revenue fall very short without\ntheir interference; and as for the Divan, the Bessoes could always find\na friend there if they chose. The awkwardness of the Syrian catastrophe\nwas, that it was so sudden and so unexpected that there was then no time\nfor those satisfactory explanations which afterwards took place between\nAdam Besso and Riza.\n\nThough the situation of Besso remained, therefore, unchanged after the\nsubsidence of the Syrian agitation, the same circumstance could not be\npredicated of the position of his foster-child. Fakredeen possessed\nall the qualities of the genuine Syrian character in excess; vain,\nsusceptible, endowed with a brilliant though frothy imagination, and a\nlove of action so unrestrained that restlessness deprived it of energy,\nwith so fine a taste that he was always capricious, and so ingenious\nthat he seemed ever inconsistent. His ambition was as high as his\napprehension was quick. He saw everything and understood everybody in\na flash; and believed that everything that was said or done ought to\nbe made to contribute to his fortunes. Educated in the sweet order, and\namid the decorous virtues of the roof of Besso, Fakredeen, who, from his\nsusceptibility, took the colour of his companions, even when he thought\nthey were his tools, had figured for ten years as a soft-hearted and\nsomewhat timid child, dependent on kind words, and returning kindness\nwith a passionate affection.\n\nHis change to the palace of his uncle developed his native qualities,\nwhich, under any accidents, could not perhaps have been long restrained,\nbut which the circumstances of the times brought to light, and matured\nwith a celerity peculiar to the East. The character of Fakredeen was\nformed amid the excitement of the Syrian invasion and its stirring\nconsequences. At ten years of age he was initiated in all the mysteries\nof political intrigue. His startling vivacity and the keen relish of his\ninfant intelligence for all the passionate interests of men amused and\nsometimes delighted his uncle. Everything was spoken before him; he\nlived in the centre of intrigues which were to shake thrones, and\nperhaps to form them. He became habituated to the idea that everything\ncould be achieved by dexterity, and that there was no test of conduct\nexcept success. To dissemble and to simulate; to conduct confidential\nnegotiations with contending powers and parties at the same time; to be\nready to adopt any opinion and to possess none; to fall into the public\nhumour of the moment, and to evade the impending catastrophe; to look\nupon every man as a tool, and never do anything which had not a definite\nthough circuitous purpose; these were his political accomplishments;\nand, while he recognised them as the best means of success, he found\nin their exercise excitement and delight. To be the centre of a maze of\nmanoeuvres was his empyrean. He was never without a resource.\n\nStratagems came to him as naturally as fruit comes to a tree. He lived\nin a labyrinth of plans, and he rejoiced to involve some one in the\nperplexities which his magic touch could alone unravel. Fakredeen had\nno principle of any kind; he had not a prejudice; a little superstition,\nperhaps, like his postponing his journey because a hare crossed his\npath. But, as for life and conduct in general, forming his opinions\nfrom the great men of whom he had experience, princes, pashas, and some\nothers, and from the great transactions with which he was connected,\nhe was convinced that all was a matter of force or fraud. Fakredeen\npreferred the latter, because it was more ingenious, and because he was\nof a kind and passionate temperament, loving beauty and the beautiful,\napt to idealise everything, and of too exquisite a taste not to shrink\nwith horror from an unnecessary massacre.\n\nThough it was his profession and his pride to simulate and to dissemble,\nhe had a native ingenuousness which was extremely awkward and very\nsurprising, for, the moment he was intimate with you, he told you\neverything. Though he intended to make a person his tool, and often\nsucceeded, such was his susceptibility, and so strong were his\nsympathetic qualities, that he was perpetually, without being aware of\nit, showing his cards. The victim thought himself safe, but the teeming\nresources of Fakredeen were never wanting, and some fresh and brilliant\ncombination, as he styled it, often secured the prey which so heedlessly\nhe had nearly forfeited. Recklessness with him was a principle of\naction. He trusted always to his fertile expedients if he failed, and\nran the risk in the meanwhile of paramount success, the fortune of those\nwho are entitled to be rash. With all his audacity, which was nearly\nequal to his craft, he had no moral courage; and, if affairs went wrong,\nand, from some accident, exhaustion of the nervous system, the weather,\nor some of those slight causes which occasionally paralyse the creative\nmind, he felt without a combination, he would begin to cry like a\nchild, and was capable of any action, however base and humiliating, to\nextricate himself from the impending disaster.\n\nFakredeen had been too young to have fatally committed himself during\nthe Egyptian occupation. The moment he found that the Emir Bescheer and\nhis sons were prisoners at Constantinople, he returned to Syria, lived\nquietly at his own castle, affected popularity among the neighbouring\nchieftains, who were pleased to see a Shehaab among them, and showed\nhimself on every occasion a most loyal subject of the Porte. At\nseventeen years of age, Fakredeen was at the head of a powerful party,\nand had opened relations with the Divan. The Porte looked upon him with\nconfidence, and although they intended, if possible, to govern Lebanon\nin future themselves, a young prince of a great house, and a young\nprince so perfectly free from all disagreeable antecedents, was not to\nbe treated lightly. All the leaders of all the parties of the mountain\nfrequented the castle of Fakredeen, and each secretly believed that the\nprince was his pupil and his tool. There was not one of these men,\ngrey though some of them were in years and craft, whom the innocent and\ningenuous Fakredeen did not bend as a nose of wax, and, when Adam Besso\nreturned to Syria in \u00e2\u0080\u009843, he found his foster-child by far the most\nconsiderable person in the country, and all parties amid their doubts\nand distractions looking up to him with hope and confidence. He was then\nnineteen years of age, and Eva was sixteen. Fakredeen came instantly\nto Damascus to welcome them, hugged Besso, wept like a child over his\nsister, sat up the whole night on the terrace of their house smoking\nhis nargileh, and telling them all his secrets without the slightest\nreserve: the most shameful actions of his career as well as the most\nbrilliant; and finally proposed to Besso to raise a loan for the\nLebanon, ostensibly to promote the cultivation of mulberries, really to\nsupply arms to the discontented population who were to make Fakredeen\nand Eva sovereigns of the mountain. It will have been observed, that to\nsupply the partially disarmed tribes of the mountain with weapons was\nstill, though at intervals, the great project of Fakredeen, and to\nobtain the result in his present destitution of resources involved\nhim in endless stratagems. His success would at the same time bind the\ntribes, already well affected to him, with unalterable devotion to a\nchief capable of such an undeniable act of sovereignty, and of course\nrender them proportionately more efficient instruments in accomplishing\nhis purpose. It was the interest of Fakredeen that the Lebanon should be\npowerful and disturbed.\n\nBesso, who had often befriended him, and who had frequently rescued\nhim from the usurers of Beiroot and Sidon, lent a cold ear to these\nsuggestions. The great merchant was not inclined again to embark in\na political career, or pass another three or four years away from his\nSyrian palaces and gardens. He had seen the most powerful head that the\nEast had produced for a century, backed by vast means, and after having\napparently accomplished his purpose, ultimately recoil before the\nsuperstitious fears of Christendom, lest any change in Syria should\nprecipitate the solution of the great Eastern problem. He could not\nbelieve that it was reserved for Fakredeen to succeed in that which had\nbaffled Mehemet Ali.\n\nEva took the more sanguine view that becomes youth and woman. She had\nfaith in Fakredeen. Though his position was not as powerful as that of\nthe great viceroy, it was, in her opinion, more legitimate. He seemed\nindicated as the natural ruler of the mountain. She had faith, too,\nin his Arabian origin. With Eva, what is called society assumed the\ncharacter of a continual struggle between Asia and the North. She\ndreaded the idea that, after having escaped the crusaders, Syria should\nfall first under the protection, and then the colonisation of some\nEuropean power. A link was wanted in the chain of resistance which\nconnected the ranges of Caucasus with the Atlas. She idealised her\nfoster-brother into a hero, and saw his standard on Mount Lebanon, the\nbeacon of the oriental races, like the spear of Shami, or the pavilion\nof Abd-el-Kader. Eva had often influenced her father for the advantage\nof Fakredeen, but at last even Eva felt that she should sue in vain.\n\nA year before, involved in difficulties which it seemed no combination\ncould control, and having nearly occasioned the occupation of Syria by\na united French and English force, Fakredeen burst out a-cry-ing like\na little boy, and came whimpering to Eva, as if somebody had broken his\ntoy or given him a beating. Then it was that Eva had obtained for him\na final assistance from her father, the condition being, that this\napplication should be the last.\n\nEva had given him jewels, had interested other members of her family\nin his behalf, and effected for him a thousand services, which only\na kind-hearted and quick-witted woman could devise. While Fakredeen\nplundered her without scruple and used her without remorse, he doted on\nher; he held her intellect in absolute reverence; a word from her guided\nhim; a look of displeasure, and his heart ached. As long as he was under\nthe influence of her presence, he really had no will, scarcely an idea\nof his own. He spoke only to elicit her feelings and opinions. He had a\nsuperstition that she was born under a fortunate star, and that it\nwas fatal to go counter to her. But the moment he was away, he would\ndisobey, deceive, and, if necessary, betray her, loving her the same all\nthe time. But what was to be expected from one whose impressions were\nequally quick and vivid, who felt so much for himself, and so much\nfor others, that his life seemed a perpetual re-action between intense\nselfishness and morbid sensibility?\n\nHad Fakredeen married Eva, the union might have given him some\nsteadiness of character, or at least its semblance. The young Emir had\ngreatly desired this alliance, not for the moral purpose that we have\nintimated, not even from love of Eva, for he was totally insensible\nto domestic joys, but because he wished to connect himself with great\ncapitalists, and hoped to gain the Lebanon loan for a dower. But this\nalliance was quite out of the question. The hand of Eva was destined,\naccording to the custom of the family, for her cousin, the eldest son of\nBesso of Aleppo. The engagement had been entered into while she was at\nVienna, and it was then agreed that the marriage should take place soon\nafter she had completed her eighteenth year. The ceremony was therefore\nat hand; it was to occur within a few months.\n\nAccustomed from an early period of life to the contemplation of this\nunion, it assumed in the eyes of Eva a character as natural as that of\nbirth or death. It never entered her head to ask herself whether she\nliked or disliked it. It was one of those inevitable things of which we\nare always conscious, yet of which we never think, like the years of our\nlife or the colour of our hair. Had her destiny been in her own hands,\nit is probable that she would not have shared it with Fakredeen, for she\nhad never for an instant entertained the wish that there should be any\nchange in the relations which subsisted between them. According to the\ncustom of the country, it was to Besso that Fakredeen had expressed his\nwishes and his hopes. The young Emir made liberal offers: his wife and\nchildren might follow any religion they pleased; nay, he was even ready\nto conform himself to any which they fixed upon. He attempted to\ndazzle Besso with the prospect of a Hebrew Prince of the Mountains. \u00e2\u0080\u0098My\ndaughter,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said the merchant, \u00e2\u0080\u0098would certainly, under any circumstances,\nmarry one of her own faith; but we need not say another word about it;\nshe is betrothed, and has been engaged for some years, to her cousin.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nWhen Fakredeen, during his recent visit to Bethany, found that Eva,\nnotwithstanding her Bedouin blood, received his proposition for\nkidnapping a young English nobleman with the utmost alarm and even\nhorror, he immediately relinquished it, diverted her mind from the\ncontemplation of a project on her disapproval of which, notwithstanding\nhis efforts at distraction, she seemed strangely to dwell, and finally\npresented her with a new and more innocent scheme in which he required\nher assistance. According to Fakredeen, his new English acquaintance\nat Beiroot, whom he had before quoted, was ready to assist him in the\nfulfilment of his contract, provided he could obtain sufficient time\nfrom Scheriff Effendi; and what he wished Eva to do was personally to\nrequest the Egyptian merchant to grant time for this indulgence. This\ndid not seem to Eva an unreasonable favour for her foster-brother\nto obtain, though she could easily comprehend why his previous\nirregularities might render him an unsuccessful suitor to his creditor.\nGlad that it was still in her power in some degree to assist him, and\nthat his present project was at least a harmless one, Eva offered the\nnext day to repair to the city and see Scheriff Effendi on his business.\nPressing her hand to his heart, and saluting her with a thousand\nendearing names, the Emir quitted the Rose of Sharon with the tears in\nhis grateful eyes.\n\nNow the exact position of Fakredeen was this: he had induced the\nEgyptian merchant to execute the contract for him by an assurance that\nBesso would be his security for the venture, although the peculiar\nnature of the transaction rendered it impossible for Besso, in his\npresent delicate position, personally to interfere in it. To keep up\nappearances, Fakredeen, with his usual audacious craft, had appointed\nScheriff Effendi to meet him at Jerusalem, at the house of Besso, for\nthe completion of the contract; and accordingly, on the afternoon of the\nday preceding his visit to Bethany, Fakredeen had arrived at Jerusalem\nwithout money, and without credit, in order to purchase arms for a\nprovince.\n\nThe greatness of the conjuncture, the delightful climate, his sanguine\ntemperament, combined, however, to sustain him. As he traversed his\ndelicious mountains, with their terraces of mulberries, and olives, and\nvines, lounged occasionally for a short time at the towns on the coast,\nand looked in at some of his creditors to chatter charming delusions,\nor feel his way for a new combination most necessary at this moment,\nhis blood was quick and his brain creative; and although he had ridden\nnearly two hundred miles when he arrived at the \u00e2\u0080\u0098Holy City,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he was\nfresh and full of faith that \u00e2\u0080\u0098something would turn up.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 His Egyptian\nfriend, awfully punctual, was the first figure that welcomed him as\nhe entered the divan of Besso, where the young Emir remained in the\nposition which we have described, smoking interminable nargilehs while\nhe revolved his affairs, until the conversation respecting the arrival\nof Tancred roused him from his brooding meditation.\n\nIt was not difficult to avoid Scheriff Effendi for a while. The\nfollowing morning, Fakredeen passed half a dozen hours at the bath, and\nthen made his visit to Eva with the plot which had occurred to him the\nnight before at the divan, and which had been matured this day while\nthey were shampooing him. The moment that, baffled, he again arrived at\nJerusalem, he sought his Egyptian merchant, and thus addressed him: \u00e2\u0080\u0098You\nsee, Effendi, that you must not talk on this business to Besso, nor can\nBesso talk to you about it.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Good!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said the Effendi.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098But, if it be managed by another person to your satisfaction, it will\nbe as well.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098One grain is like another.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098It will be managed by another person to your satisfaction.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Good!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098The Rose of Sharon is the same in this business as her father?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098He is a ruby and she is a pearl.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098The Rose of Sharon will see you to-morrow about this business.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Good!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098The Rose of Sharon may ask you for time to settle everything; she\nhas to communicate with other places. You have heard of such a city as\nAleppo?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098If Damascus be an eye, Aleppo is an ear.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t trouble the Rose of Sharon, Effendi, with any details if she\nspeaks to you; but be content with all she proposes. She will ask,\nperhaps, for three months; women are nervous; they think robbers may\nseize the money on its way, or the key of the chest may not be found\nwhen it is wanted; you understand? Agree to what she proposes; but,\nbetween ourselves, I will meet you at Gaza on the day of the new moon,\nand it is finished.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Good.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nFaithful to her promise, at an early hour of the morrow, Eva, wrapped\nin a huge and hooded Arab cloak, so that her form could not in the\nslightest degree be traced, her face covered with a black Arab mask,\nmounted her horse; her two female attendants, habited in the same\nmanner, followed their mistress; before whom marched her janissary\narmed to the teeth, while four Arab grooms walked on each side of the\ncavalcade. In this way, they entered Jerusalem by the gate of Sion, and\nproceeded to the house of Besso. Fakredeen watched her arrival. He was\nin due time summoned to her presence, where he learned the success of\nher mission.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Scheriff Effendi,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 she said, \u00e2\u0080\u0098has agreed to keep the arms for three\nmonths, you paying the usual rate of interest on the money. This is but\njust. May your new friend at Beiroot be more powerful than I am, and as\nfaithful!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Beautiful Rose of Sharon! who can be like you! You inspire me; you\nalways do. I feel persuaded that I shall get the money long before the\ntime has elapsed.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 And, so saying, he bade her farewell, to return, as\nhe said, without loss of time to Beiroot.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIX.\n\n     _Capture of the New Crusader_\n\nTHE dawn was about to break in a cloudless sky, when Tancred,\naccompanied by Baroni and two servants, all well armed and well mounted,\nand by Hassan, a sheikh of the Jellaheen Bedouins, tall and grave, with\na long spear tufted with ostrich feathers in his hand, his musket slung\nat his back, and a scimitar at his side, quitted Jerusalem by the gate\nof Bethlehem.\n\nIf it were only to see the sun rise, or to become acquainted with nature\nat hours excluded from the experience of civilisation, it were worth\nwhile to be a traveller. There is something especially in the hour that\nprecedes a Syrian dawn, which invigorates the frame and elevates the\nspirit. One cannot help fancying that angels may have been resting on\nthe mountain tops during the night, the air is so sweet and the earth\nso still. Nor, when it wakes, does it wake to the maddening cares of\nEurope. The beauty of a patriarchal repose still lingers about its\nexistence in spite of its degradation. Notwithstanding all they have\nsuffered during the European development, the manners of the Asiatic\nraces generally are more in harmony with nature than the complicated\nconventionalisms which harass their fatal rival, and which have\nincreased in exact proportion as the Europeans have seceded from those\nArabian and Syrian creeds that redeemed them from their primitive\nbarbarism.\n\nBut the light breaks, the rising beam falls on the gazelles still\nbounding on the hills of Judah, and gladdens the partridge which still\ncalls among the ravines, as it did in the days of the prophets. About\nhalf-way between Jerusalem and Bethlehem, Tancred and his companions\nhalted at the tomb of Rachel: here awaited them a chosen band of twenty\nstout Jellaheens, the subjects of Sheikh Hassan, their escort through\nthe wildernesses of Arabia Petr\u00c3\u00a6a. The fringed and ribbed kerchief of\nthe desert, which must be distinguished from the turban, and is woven\nby their own women from the hair of the camel, covered the heads of the\nBedouins; a short white gown, also of home manufacture, and very rude,\nwith a belt of cords, completed, with slippers, their costume.\n\nEach man bore a musket and a dagger.\n\nIt was Baroni who had made the arrangement with Sheikh Hassan. Baroni\nhad long known him as a brave and faithful Arab. In general, these\ncontracts with the Bedouins for convoy through the desert are made by\nFranks through their respective consuls, but Tancred was not sorry to\nbe saved from the necessity of such an application, as it would have\nexcited the attention of Colonel Brace, who passed his life at the\nBritish Consulate, and who probably would have thought it necessary to\nput on the uniform of the Bellamont yeomanry cavalry, and have attended\nthe heir of Montacute to Mount Sinai. Tancred shuddered at the idea of\nthe presence of such a being at such a place, with his large ruddy face,\nhis swaggering, sweltering figure, his flourishing whiskers, and his fat\nhands.\n\nIt was the fifth morn after the visit of Tancred to Bethany, of which\nhe had said nothing to Baroni, the only person at his command who could\nafford or obtain any information as to the name and quality of her\nwith whom he had there so singularly become acquainted. He was far from\nincurious on the subject; all that he had seen and all that he had heard\nat Bethany greatly interested him. But the reserve which ever controlled\nhim, unless under the influence of great excitement, a reserve which was\nthe result of pride and not of caution, would probably have checked any\nexpression of his wishes on this head, even had he not been under the\ninfluence of those feelings which now absorbed him. A human being,\nanimated by the hope, almost by the conviction, that a celestial\ncommunication is impending over his destiny, moves in a supernal sphere,\nwhich no earthly consideration can enter. The long musings of his voyage\nhad been succeeded on the part of Tancred, since his arrival in the\nHoly Land, by one unbroken and impassioned reverie, heightened, not\ndisturbed, by frequent and solitary prayer, by habitual fasts, and by\nthose exciting conferences with Alonza Lara, in which he had struggled\nto penetrate the great Asian mystery, reserved however, if indeed ever\nexpounded, for a longer initiation than had yet been proved by the son\nof the English noble.\n\nAfter a week of solitary preparation, during which he had interchanged\nno word, and maintained an abstinence which might have rivalled an old\neremite of Engedi, Tancred had kneeled before that empty sepulchre of\nthe divine Prince of the house of David, for which his ancestor,\nTancred de Montacute, six hundred years before, had struggled with\nthose followers of Mahound, who, to the consternation and perplexity of\nChristendom, continued to retain it. Christendom cares nothing for\nthat tomb now, has indeed forgotten its own name, and calls itself\nenlightened Europe. But enlightened Europe is not happy. Its existence\nis a fever, which it calls progress. Progress to what?\n\nThe youthful votary, during his vigils at the sacred tomb, had received\nsolace but not inspiration. No voice from heaven had yet sounded, but\nhis spirit was filled with the sanctity of the place, and he returned to\nhis cell to prepare for fresh pilgrimages.\n\nOne day, in conference with Lara, the Spanish Prior had let drop these\nwords: \u00e2\u0080\u0098Sinai led to Calvary; it may be wise to trace your steps from\nCalvary to Sinai.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nAt this moment, Tancred and his escort are in sight of Bethlehem, with\nthe population of a village but the walls of a town, situate on an\neminence overlooking a valley, which seems fertile after passing the\nstony plain of Rephaim. The first beams of the sun, too, were rising\nfrom the mountains of Arabia and resting on the noble convent of the\nNativity.\n\nFrom Bethlehem to Hebron, Canaan is still a land of milk and honey,\nthough not so rich and picturesque as in the great expanse of Palestine\nto the north of the Holy City. The beauty and the abundance of the\npromised land may still be found in Samaria and Galilee; in the\nmagnificent plains of Esdraelon, Zabulon, and Gennesareth; and ever by\nthe gushing waters of the bowery Jordan.\n\nAbout an hour after leaving Bethlehem, in a secluded valley, is one of\nthe few remaining public works of the great Hebrew Kings, It is in every\nrespect worthy of them. I speak of those colossal reservoirs cut out\nof the native rock and fed by a single spring, discharging their waters\ninto an aqueduct of perforated stone, which, until a comparatively\nrecent period, still conveyed them to Jerusalem. They are three in\nnumber, of varying lengths from five to six hundred feet, and almost\nas broad; their depth, still undiscovered. They communicate with each\nother, so that the water of the uppermost reservoir, flowing through the\nintermediate one, reached the third, which fed the aqueduct. They are\nlined with a hard cement like that which coats the pyramids, and which\nremains uninjured; and it appears that hanging gardens once surrounded\nthem. The Arabs still call these reservoirs the pools of Solomon, nor is\nthere any reason to doubt the tradition. Tradition, perhaps often more\nfaithful than written documents, is a sure and almost infallible guide\nin the minds of the people where there has been no complicated variety\nof historic incidents to confuse and break the chain of memory; where\ntheir rare revolutions have consisted of an eruption once in a thousand\nyears into the cultivated world; where society has never been broken\nup, but their domestic manners have remained the same; where, too, they\nrevere truth, and are rigid in its oral delivery, since that is their\nonly means of disseminating knowledge.\n\nThere is no reason to doubt that these reservoirs were the works\nof Solomon. This secluded valley, then, was once the scene of his\nimaginative and delicious life. Here were his pleasure gardens; these\nslopes were covered with his fantastic terraces, and the high places\nglittered with his pavilions. The fountain that supplied these treasured\nwaters was perhaps the \u00e2\u0080\u0098sealed fountain,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 to which he compared his\nbride; and here was the garden palace where the charming Queen of Sheba\nvainly expected to pose the wisdom of Israel, as she held at a distance\nbefore the most dexterous of men the two garlands of flowers, alike in\nform and colour, and asked the great king, before his trembling court,\nto decide which of the wreaths was the real one.\n\nThey are gone, they are vanished, these deeds of beauty and these words\nof wit! The bright and glorious gardens of the tiaraed poet and the\nroyal sage, that once echoed with his lyric voice, or with the startling\ntruths of his pregnant aphorisms, end in this wild and solitary valley,\nin which with folded arms and musing eye of long abstraction, Tancred\nhalts in his ardent pilgrimage, nor can refrain from asking himself,\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Can it, then, be true that all is vanity?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nWhy, what, is this desolation? Why are there no more kings whose words\nare the treasured wisdom of countless ages, and the mention of whose\nname to this moment thrills the heart of the Oriental, from the waves of\nthe midland ocean to the broad rivers of the farthest Ind? Why are there\nno longer bright-witted queens to step out of their Arabian palaces\nand pay visits to the gorgeous \u00e2\u0080\u0098house of the forest of Lebanon,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 or\nto where Baalbec, or Tadmor in the wilderness, rose on those plains now\nstrewn with the superb relics of their inimitable magnificence?\n\nAnd yet some flat-nosed Frank, full of bustle and puffed up with\nself-conceit (a race spawned perhaps in the morasses of some Northern\nforest hardly yet cleared), talks of Progress! Progress to what, and\nfrom whence? Amid empires shrivelled into deserts, amid the wrecks of\ngreat cities, a single column or obelisk of which nations import for\nthe prime ornament of their mud-built capitals, amid arts forgotten,\ncommerce annihilated, fragmentary literatures and populations destroyed,\nthe European talks of progress, because, by an ingenious application\nof some scientific acquirements, he has established a society which has\nmistaken comfort for civilisation.\n\nThe soft beam of the declining sun fell upon a serene landscape; gentle\nundulations covered with rich shrubs or highly cultivated corn-fields\nand olive groves; sometimes numerous flocks; and then vineyards\nfortified with walls and with watch-towers, as in the time of David,\nwhose city Tancred was approaching. Hebron, too, was the home of the\ngreat Sheikh Abraham; and the Arabs here possess his tomb, which no\nChristian is permitted to visit. It is strange and touching, that the\nchildren of Ishmael should have treated the name and memory of\nthe Sheikh Abraham with so much reverence and affection. But the\ncircumstance that he was the friend of Allah appears with them entirely\nto have outweighed the recollection of his harsh treatment of their\ngreat progenitor. Hebron has even lost with them its ancient Jud\u00c3\u00a6an\nname, and they always call it, in honour of the tomb of the Sheikh, the\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098City of a Friend.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nAbout an hour after Hebron, in a fair pasture, and near an olive grove,\nTancred pitched his tent, prepared on the morrow to quit the land of\npromise, and approach that \u00e2\u0080\u0098great and terrible wilderness where there\nwas no water.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098The children of Israel,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 as they were called according to the custom\nthen and now universally prevalent among the Arabian tribes (as, for\nexample, the Beni Kahtan, Beni Kelb, Beni Salem, Beni Sobh, Beni Ghamed,\nBeni Seydan, Beni Ali, Beni Hateym, all adopting for their description\nthe name of their founder), the \u00e2\u0080\u0098children of Israel\u00e2\u0080\u0099 were originally a\ntribe of Arabia Petrasa. Under the guidance of sheikhs of great ability,\nthey emerged from their stony wilderness and settled on the Syrian\nborder.\n\nBut they could not maintain themselves against the disciplined nations\nof Palestine, and they fell back to their desert, which they found\nintolerable. Like some of the Bedouin tribes of modern times in the\nrocky wastes contiguous to the Red Sea, they were unable to resist the\ntemptations of the Egyptian cities; they left their free but distressful\nwilderness, and became Fellaheen. The Pharaohs, however, made them pay\nfor their ready means of sustenance, as Mehemet Ali has made the Arabs\nof our days who have quitted the desert to eat the harvests of the Nile.\nThey enslaved them, and worked them as beasts of burden. But this was\nnot to be long borne by a race whose chiefs in the early ages had\nbeen favoured by Jehovah; the patriarch Emirs, who, issuing from\nthe Caucasian cradle of the great races, spread over the plains of\nMesopotamia, and disseminated their illustrious seed throughout the\nArabian wilderness. Their fiery imaginations brooded over the great\ntraditions of their tribe, and at length there arose among them one of\nthose men whose existence is an epoch in the history of human nature:\na great creative spirit and organising mind, in whom the faculties\nof conception and of action are equally balanced and possessed in the\nhighest degree; in every respect a man of the complete Caucasian model,\nand almost as perfect as Adam when he was just finished and placed in\nEden.\n\nBut Jehovah recognised in Moses a human instrument too rare merely to\nbe entrusted with the redemption of an Arabian tribe from a state of\nFellaheen to Bedouin existence. And, therefore, he was summoned to be\nthe organ of an eternal revelation of the Divine will, and his tribe\nwere appointed to be the hereditary ministers of that mighty and\nmysterious dispensation.\n\nIt is to be noted, although the Omnipotent Creator might have found, had\nit pleased him, in the humblest of his creations, an efficient agent\nfor his purpose, however difficult and sublime, that Divine Majesty has\nnever thought fit to communicate except with human beings of the very\nhighest powers. They are always men who have manifested an extraordinary\naptitude for great affairs, and the possession of a fervent and\ncommanding genius. They are great legislators, or great warriors, or\ngreat poets, or orators of the most vehement and impassioned spirit.\nSuch were Moses, Joshua, the heroic youth of Hebron, and his magnificent\nson; such, too, was Isaiah, a man, humanly speaking, not inferior to\nDemosthenes, and struggling for a similar and as beautiful a cause,\nthe independence of a small state, eminent for its intellectual power,\nagainst the barbarian grandeur of a military empire. All the great\nthings have been done by the little nations. It is the Jordan and the\nIlyssus that have civilised the modern races. An Arabian tribe, a clan\nof the \u00c3\u0086gean, have been the promulgators of all our knowledge; and\nwe should never have heard of the Pharaohs, of Babylon the great and\nNineveh the superb, of Cyrus and of Xerxes, had not it been for Athens\nand Jerusalem.\n\nTancred rose with the sun from his encampment at Hebron, to traverse,\nprobably, the same route pursued by the spies when they entered the\nLand of Promise. The transition from Canaan to the stony Arabia is\nnot abrupt. A range of hills separates Palestine from a high but level\ncountry similar to the Syrian desert, sandy in some places, but covered\nin all with grass and shrubs; a vast expanse of downs. Gradually the\nherbage disappears, and the shrubs are only found tufting the ridgy tops\nof low undulating sandhills. Soon the sand becomes stony, and no trace\nof vegetation is ever visible excepting occasionally some thorny plant.\nThen comes a land which alternates between plains of sand and dull\nranges of monotonous hills covered with loose flints; sometimes the\npilgrim winds his way through their dull ravines, sometimes he mounts\nthe heights and beholds a prospect of interminable desolation.\n\nFor three nights had Tancred encamped in this wilderness, halting at\nsome spot where they could find some desert shrubs that might serve as\nfood for the camels and fuel for themselves. His tent was soon pitched,\nthe night fires soon crackling, and himself seated at one with the\nSheikh and Baroni, he beheld with interest and amusement the picturesque\nand flashing groups around him. Their fare was scant and simple: bread\nbaked upon the spot, the dried tongue of a gazelle, the coffee of the\nneighbouring Mocha, and the pipe that ever consoles, if indeed the\ntraveller, whatever his hardships, could need any sustenance but his own\nhigh thoughts in such a scene, canopied, too, by the most beautiful sky\nand the most delicious climate in the world.\n\nThey were in the vicinity of Mount Seir; on the morrow they were to\ncommence the passage of the lofty range which stretches on to Sinai. The\nSheikh, who had a feud with a neighbouring tribe, and had been anxious\nand vigilant while they crossed the open country, riding on with\nan advanced guard before his charge, reconnoitring from sandhill to\nsandhill, often creeping up and lying on his breast, so as not to be\nvisible to the enemy, congratulated Tancred that all imminent danger was\npast.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Not that I am afraid of them,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Hassan, proudly; \u00e2\u0080\u0098but we must kill\nthem or they will kill us.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Hassan, though Sheikh of his own immediate\nfamily and followers, was dependent on the great Sheikh of the Jellaheen\ntribe, and was bound to obey his commands in case the complete clan were\nsummoned to congregate in any particular part of the desert.\n\n[Illustration: page2-083]\n\nOn the morrow they commenced their passage of the mountains, and, after\nclearing several ranges found themselves two hours after noon in a\ndefile so strangely beautiful that to behold it would alone have\nrepaid all the exertions and perils of the expedition. It was formed\nby precipitous rocks of a picturesque shape and of great height, and of\ncolours so brilliant and so blended that to imagine them you must fancy\nthe richest sunset you have ever witnessed, and that would be inferior,\nfrom the inevitable defect of its fleeting character. Here the tints,\nsometimes vivid, sometimes shadowed down, were always equally fair:\nlight blue heights, streaked, perhaps, with scarlet and shaded off\nto lilac or purple; a cleft of bright orange; a broad peach-coloured\nexpanse, veined in delicate circles and wavy lines of exquisite grace;\nsometimes yellow and purple stripes; sometimes an isolated steep of\nevery hue flaming in the sun, and then, like a young queen on a gorgeous\nthrone, from a vast rock of crimson, and gold rose a milk-white summit.\nThe frequent fissures of this defile were filled with rich woods of\noleander and shrubs of every shade of green, from which rose acacia, and\nother trees unknown to Tancred. Over all this was a deep and cloudless\nsky, and through it a path winding amid a natural shrubbery, which\nprinces would have built colossal conservatories to preserve.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098\u00e2\u0080\u0099Tis a scene of enchantment that has risen to mock us in the middle of\nthe desert,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 exclaimed the enraptured pilgrim; \u00e2\u0080\u0098surely it must vanish\neven as we gaze!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nAbout half-way up the defile, when they had traversed it for about a\nquarter of an hour, Sheikh Hassan suddenly galloped forward and hurled\nhis spear with great force at an isolated crag, the base of which\nwas covered with oleanders, and then looking back he shouted to his\ncompanions. Tancred and the foremost hurried up to him.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Here are tracks of horses and camels that have entered the valley thus\nfar and not passed through it. They are fresh; let all be prepared.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098We are twenty-five men well armed,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Baroni. \u00e2\u0080\u0098It is not the Tyahas\nthat will attack such a band.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Nor are they the Gherashi or the Mezeines,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said the Sheikh, \u00e2\u0080\u0098for we\nknow what they are after, and we are brothers.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098They must be Alouins,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said an Arab.\n\nAt this moment the little caravan was apparently land-locked, the\ndefile again winding; but presently it became quite straight, and its\ntermination was visible, though at a considerable distance.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I see horsemen,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said the Sheikh; \u00e2\u0080\u0098several of them advance; they are\nnot Alouins.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nHe rode forward to meet them, accompanied by Tancred and Baroni.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Salaam,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said the Sheikh, \u00e2\u0080\u0098how is it?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 and then he added, aside to\nBaroni, \u00e2\u0080\u0098They are strangers; why are they here?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Aleikoum! We know where you come from,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 was the reply of one of the\nhorsemen. \u00e2\u0080\u0098Is that the brother of the Queen of the English? Let him\nride with us, and you may go on in peace.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098He is my brother,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Sheikh Hassan, \u00e2\u0080\u0098and the brother of all here.\nThere is no feud between us. Who are you?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098We are children of Jethro, and the great Sheikh has sent us a long way\nto give you salaam. Your desert here is not fit for the camel that your\nProphet cursed. Come, let us finish our business, for we wish to see a\nplace where there are palm trees.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Are these children of Eblis?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Sheikh Hassan to Baroni.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098It is the day of judgment,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Baroni, looking pale; \u00e2\u0080\u0098such a thing\nhas not happened in my time. I am lost.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098What do these people say?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 inquired Tancred.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098There is but one God,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Sheikh Hassan, whose men had now reached\nhim, \u00e2\u0080\u0098and Mahomet is his Prophet. Stand aside, sons of Eblis, or you\nshall bite the earth which curses you!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nA wild shout from every height of the defile was the answer. They looked\nup, they looked round; the crest of every steep was covered with armed\nArabs, each man with his musket levelled.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098My lord,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Baroni, \u00e2\u0080\u0098there is something hidden in all this. This is\nnot an ordinary desert foray. You are known, and this tribe comes from a\ndistance to plunder you;\u00e2\u0080\u0099 and then he rapidly detailed what had already\npassed.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098What is your force, sons of Eblis?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said the Sheikh to the horsemen.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Count your men, and your muskets, and your swords, and your horses, and\nyour camels; and if they were all double, they would not be our force.\nOur great Sheikh would have come in person with ten thousand men, were\nnot your wilderness here fit only for Giaours.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Tell the young chief,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said the Sheikh to Baroni, \u00e2\u0080\u0098that I am his\nbrother, and will shed the last drop of my blood in his service, as I am\nbound to do, as much as he is bound to give me ten thousand piastres for\nthe journey, and ask him what he wishes.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Demand to know distinctly what these men want,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Tancred to Baroni,\nwho then conferred with them.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098They want your lordship,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Baroni, \u00e2\u0080\u0098whom they call the brother\nof the Queen of the English; their business is clearly to carry you to\ntheir great Sheikh, who will release you for a large ransom.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098And they have no feud with the Jellaheens?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098None; they are strangers; they come from a distance for this purpose;\nnor can it be doubted that this plan has been concocted at Jerusalem.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Our position, I fear, is fatal in this defile,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Tancred; \u00e2\u0080\u0098it\nis bitter to be the cause of exposing so many brave men to almost\ninevitable slaughter. Tell them, Baroni, that I am not the brother of\nthe Queen of the English; that they are ridiculously misled, and that\ntheir aim is hopeless, for all that will be ransomed will be my corpse.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nSheikh Hassan sat on his horse like a statue, with his spear in his hand\nand his eye on his enemy; Baroni, advancing to the strange horsemen, who\nwere in position about ten yards from Tancred and his guardian, was soon\nengaged in animated conversation. He did all that an able diplomatist\ncould effect; told lies with admirable grace, and made a hundred\npropositions that did not commit his principal. He assured them very\nheartily that Tancred was not the brother of the Queen of the English;\nthat he was only a young Sheikh, whose father was alive, and in\npossession of all the flocks and herds, camels and horses; that he had\nquarrelled with his father; that his father, perhaps, would not be sorry\nif he were got rid of, and would not give a hundred piastres to save his\nlife. Then he offered, if he would let Tancred pass, himself to go with\nthem as prisoner to their great Sheikh, and even proposed Hassan and\nhalf his men for additional hostages, whilst some just and equitable\narrangement could be effected. All, however, was in vain. The enemy had\nno discretion; dead or alive, the young Englishman must be carried to\ntheir chief.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I can do nothing,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Baroni, returning; \u00e2\u0080\u0098there is something in all\nthis which I do not understand. It has never happened in my time.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098There is, then, but one course to be taken,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Tancred; \u00e2\u0080\u0098we must\ncharge through the defile. At any rate we shall have the satisfaction of\ndying like men. Let us each fix on our opponent. That audacious-looking\nArab in a red kefia shall be my victim, or my destroyer. Speak to the\nSheikh, and tell him to prepare his men. Freeman and Trueman,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said\nTancred, looking round to his English servants, \u00e2\u0080\u0098we are in extreme\nperil; I took you from your homes; if we outlive this day, and return to\nMontacute, you shall live on your own land.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Never mind us, my lord: if it wern\u00e2\u0080\u0099t for those rocks we would beat\nthese niggers.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Are you all ready?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Tancred to Baroni.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098We are all ready.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Then I commend my soul to Jesus Christ, and to the God of Sinai, in\nwhose cause I perish.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 So saying, Tancred shot the Arab in the red kefia\nthrough the head, and with his remaining pistol disabled another of the\nenemy. This he did, while he and his band were charging, so suddenly and\nso boldly, that those immediately opposed to them were scattered. There\nwas a continuous volley, however, from every part of the defile, and the\nscene was so involved in smoke that it was impossible for Tancred to see\na yard around him; still he galloped on and felt conscious that he had\ncompanions, though the shouting was so great that it was impossible to\ncommunicate. The smoke suddenly drifting, Tancred caught a glimpse of\nhis position; he was at the mouth of the defile, followed by several of\nhis men, whom he had not time to distinguish, and awaited by innumerable\nfoes.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Let us sell our lives dearly!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 was all that he could exclaim. His sword\nfell from his wounded arm; his horse, stabbed underneath, sank with him\nto the ground. He was overpowered and bound. \u00e2\u0080\u0098Every drop of his blood,\u00e2\u0080\u0099\nexclaimed the leader of the strange Arabs, \u00e2\u0080\u0098is worth ten thousand\npiastres.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXX.\n\n     _Plans for Rescue_\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098WHERE is Besso?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Barizy of the Tower, as the Consul Pasqualigo\nentered the divan of the merchant, about ten days after the departure of\nTancred from Jerusalem for Mount Sinai.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Where is Besso? I have already smoked two chibouques, and no one has\nentered except yourself. I suppose you have heard the news?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Who has not? It is in every one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mouth.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 \u00e2\u0080\u0098What have you heard?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 asked\nBarizy of the Tower, with an air of malicious curiosity.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Some things that everybody knows,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 replied Pasqualigo, \u00e2\u0080\u0098and some things\nthat nobody knows.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Hah, hah!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Barizy of the Tower, pricking up his ears, and\npreparing for one of those diplomatic encounters of mutual pumping,\nin which he and his rival were practised. \u00e2\u0080\u0098I suppose you have seen\nsomebody, eh?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Somebody has been seen,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 replied Pasqualigo, and then he busied himself\nwith his pipe just arrived.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098But nobody has seen somebody who was on the spot?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Barizy.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098It depends upon what you mean by the spot,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 replied Pasqualigo.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Your information is second-hand,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 observed Barizy.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098But you acknowledge it is correct?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Pasqualigo, more eagerly.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098It depends upon whether your friend was present----\u00e2\u0080\u0099 and here Barizy\nhesitated.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098It does,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Pasqualigo.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Then he was present?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Barizy.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098He was.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Then he knows,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Barizy, eagerly, \u00e2\u0080\u0098whether the young English prince\nwas murdered intentionally or by hazard.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098A--h,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Pasqualigo, whom not the slightest rumour of the affair had\nyet reached, \u00e2\u0080\u0098that is a great question.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098But everything depends upon it,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Barizy. \u00e2\u0080\u0098If he was killed\naccidentally, there will be negotiations, but the business will\nbe compromised; the English want Cyprus, and they will take it as\ncompensation. If it is an affair of malice prepense, there will be war,\nfor the laws of England require war if blood royal be spilt.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nThe Consul Pasqualigo looked very grave; then, withdrawing his lips for\na moment from his amber mouthpiece, he observed, \u00e2\u0080\u0098It is a crisis.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098It will be a crisis,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Barizy of the Tower, excited by finding\nhis rival a listener, \u00e2\u0080\u0098but not for a long time. The crisis has not\ncommenced. The first question is: to whom does the desert belong; to the\nPorte, or to the Viceroy?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098It depends upon what part of the desert is in question,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said\nPasqualigo.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Of course the part where it took place. I say the Arabian desert\nbelongs to the Viceroy; my cousin, Barizy of the Gate, says \u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, it\nbelongs to the Porte.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Raphael Tafna says it belongs to neither. The\nBedouins are independent.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098But they are not recognised,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said the Consul Pasqualigo. \u00e2\u0080\u0098Without\na diplomatic existence, they are nullities. England will hold all the\nrecognise powers in the vicinity responsible. You will see! The murder\nof an English prince, under such circumstances too, will not pass\nunavenged. The whole of the Turkish garrison of the city will march out\ndirectly into the desert.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098The Arabs care shroff for your Turkish garrison of the city,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said\nBarizy, with great derision.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098They are eight hundred strong,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Pasqualigo.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Eight hundred weak, you mean. No, as Raphael Tafna was saying, when\nMehemet. Ali was master, the tribes were quiet enough. But the Turks\ncould never manage the Arabs, even in their best days. If the Pasha of\nDamascus were to go himself, the Bedouins would unveil his harem while\nhe was smoking his nargileh.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Then England will call upon the Egyptians,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said the Consul.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Hah!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Barizy of the Tower, \u00e2\u0080\u0098have I got you at last? Now comes\nyour crisis, I grant you. The English will send a ship of war with a\nprotocol, and one of their lords who is a sailor: that is the way. They\nwill call upon the pasha to exterminate the tribe who have murdered the\nbrother of their queen; the pasha will reply, that when he was in Syria\nthe brothers of queens were never murdered, and put the protocol in his\nturban. This will never satisfy Palmerston; he will order----\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Palmerston has nothing to do with it,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 screamed out Pasqualigo; \u00e2\u0080\u0098he is\nno longer Reis Effendi; he is in exile; he is governor of the Isle of\nWight.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Do you think I do not know that?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Barizy of the Tower; \u00e2\u0080\u0098but he\nwill be recalled for this purpose. The English will not go to war in\nSyria without Palmerston. Palmerston will have the command of the fleet\nas well as of the army, that no one shall say \u00e2\u0080\u009cNo\u00e2\u0080\u009d when he says \u00e2\u0080\u009cYes.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n The English will not do the business of the Turks again for nothing.\nThey will take this city; they will keep it. They want a new market for\ntheir cottons. Mark me: England will never be satisfied till the people\nof Jerusalem wear calico turbans.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nLet us inquire also with Barizy of the Tower, where was Besso? Alone in\nhis private chamber, agitated and troubled, awaiting the return of\nhis daughter from the bath; and even now, the arrival may be heard of\nherself and her attendants in the inner court.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098You want me, my father?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Eva, as she entered. \u00e2\u0080\u0098Ah! you are\ndisturbed. What has happened?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098The tenth plague of Pharaoh, my child,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 replied Besso, in a tone of\ngreat vexation. \u00e2\u0080\u0098Since the expulsion of Ibrahim, there has been nothing\nwhich has crossed me so much.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Fakredeen?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098No, no; \u00e2\u0080\u0098tis nothing to do with him, poor boy; but of one as young, and\nwhose interests, though I know him not, scarcely less concern me.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098You know him not; \u00e2\u0080\u0098tis not then my cousin. You perplex me, my father.\nTell me at once.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098It is the most vexatious of all conceivable occurrences,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 replied\nBesso, \u00e2\u0080\u0098and yet it is about a person of whom you never heard, and whom\nI never saw; and yet there are circumstances connected with him. Alas!\nalas! you must know, my Eva, there is a young Englishman here, and a\nyoung English lord, of one of their princely families----\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Yes!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Eva, in a subdued but earnest tone.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098He brought me a letter from the best and greatest of men,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Besso,\nwith much emotion, \u00e2\u0080\u0098to whom I, to whom we, owe everything: our fortunes,\nour presence here, perhaps our lives. There was nothing which I was not\nbound to do for him, which I was not ready and prepared to do. I ought\nto have guarded over him; to have forced my services on his acceptance;\nI blame myself now when it is too late. But he sent me his letter by\nthe Intendant of his household, whom I knew. I was fearful to obtrude\nmyself. I learnt he was fanatically Christian, and thought perhaps he\nmight shrink from my acquaintance.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098And what has happened?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 inquired Eva, with an agitation which proved\nher sympathy with her father\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sorrow.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098He left the city some days ago to visit Sinai; well armed and properly\nescorted. He has been waylaid in the wilderness and captured after a\nbloody struggle.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098A bloody struggle?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Yes; they of course would gladly not have fought, but, though entrapped\ninto an ambush, the young Englishman would not yield, but fought with\ndesperation. His assailants have suffered considerably; his own\nparty comparatively little, for they were so placed; surrounded,\nyou understand, in a mountain defile, that they might have been all\nmassacred, but the fear of destroying their prize restrained at first\nthe marksmen on the heights; and, by a daring and violent charge,\nthe young Englishman and his followers forced the pass, but they were\noverpowered by numbers.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098And he wounded?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I hope not severely. But you have heard nothing. They have sent his\nIntendant to Jerusalem with a guard of Arabs to bring back his ransom.\nWhat do you think they want?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nEva signified her inability to conjecture.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Two millions of piastres!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Two millions of piastres! Did you say two? \u00e2\u0080\u0098Tis a great sum; but we\nmight negotiate. They would accept less, perhaps much less, than two\nmillions of piastres.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098If it were four millions of piastres, I must pay it,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Besso. \u00e2\u0080\u0098\u00e2\u0080\u0099Tis\nnot the sum alone that so crosses me. The father of this young noble\nis a great prince, and could doubtless pay, without serious injury to\nhimself, two millions of piastres for the ransom of his son; but that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nnot it. He comes here; he is sent to me. I was to care for him, think\nfor him, guard over him: I have never even seen him; and he is wounded,\nplundered, and a prisoner!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098But if he avoided you, my father?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 murmured Eva, with her eyes fixed\nupon the ground.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Avoided me!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Besso; \u00e2\u0080\u0098he never thought of me but as of a Jew\nbanker, to whom he would send his servant for money when he needed it.\nWas I to stand on punctilios with a great Christian noble? I ought to\nhave waited at his gate every day when he came forth, and bowed to the\nearth, until it pleased him to notice me; I ought----\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098No, no, no, my father! you are bitter. This youth is not such as you\nthink; at least, in all probability is not,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Eva. \u00e2\u0080\u0098You hear he is\nfanatically Christian; he may be but deeply religious, and his thoughts\nat this moment may rest on other things than the business of the world.\nHe who makes pilgrimage to Sinai can scarcely think us so vile as you\nwould intimate.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098What will he think of those whom he is among? Here is the wound, Eva!\nGuess, then, child, who has shot this arrow. \u00e2\u0080\u0098Tis my father!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098O traitor! traitor!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Eva, quickly covering her face with her\nhands. \u00e2\u0080\u0098My terror was prophetic! There is none so base!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Nay, nay,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Besso; \u00e2\u0080\u0098these, indeed, are women\u00e2\u0080\u0099s words. The great\nSheikh in this has touched me nearly, but I see no baseness in it. He\ncould not know the intimate relation that should subsist between me and\nthis young Englishman. He has captured him in the desert, according to\nthe custom of his tribe. Much as Amalek may injure me, I must acquit him\nof treason and of baseness.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Yes, yes,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Eva, with an abstracted air. \u00e2\u0080\u0098You misconceive me. I was\nthinking of others; and what do you purpose, my father?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098First, to clear myself of the deep stain that I now feel upon my life,\u00e2\u0080\u0099\nsaid Besso. \u00e2\u0080\u0098This Englishman comes to Jerusalem with an unbounded\ncredit on my house: he visits the wilderness, and is made prisoner by my\nfather-in-law, who is in ambush in a part of the desert which his tribe\nnever frequents, and who sends to me for a princely ransom for his\ncaptive.\n\nThese are the apparent circumstances. These are the facts. There is\nbut one inference from them. I dare say \u00e2\u0080\u0098tis drawn already by all the\ngossips of the city: they are hard at it, I doubt not, at this moment,\nin my own divan, winking their eyes and shrugging their shoulders,\nwhile they are smoking my choice tobacco, and drinking my sherbet of\npomegranate. And can I blame them?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098A pure conscience may defy city gossips.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098A pure conscience must pay the ransom out of my own coffers. I am not\nover fond of paying two millions of piastres, or even half, for one\nwhose shadow never fell upon my threshold. And yet I must do it: do it\nfor my father-in-law, the Sheikh of the Recha-bites, whose peace I\nmade with Mehemet Ali, for whom I gained the guardianship of the\nMecca caravan through the Syrian desert for five years, who has twelve\nthousand camels which he made by that office. Oh, were it not for you,\nmy daughter, I would curse the hour that I ever mixed my blood with the\nchildren of Jethro. After all, if the truth were known, they are sons of\nIshmael.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098No, no, dear father, say not such things. You will send to the great\nSheikh; he will listen----\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I send to the great Sheikh! You know not your grandfather, and you know\nnot me. The truth is, the Sheikh and myself mutually despise each other,\nand we have never met without parting in bitterness. No, no; I would\nrather pay the ransom myself than ask a favour of the great Sheikh. But\nhow can I pay the ransom, even if I chose? This young Englishman is a\nfiery youth: he will not yield even to an ambush and countless odds. Do\nyou think a man who charges through a defile crowned with matchlocks,\nand shoots men through the head, as I am told he did, in the name of\nChrist, will owe his freedom to my Jewish charity? He will burn the\nTemple first. This young man has the sword of Gideon. You know little of\nthe world, Eva, and nothing of young Englishmen. There is not a race so\nproud, so wilful, so rash, and so obstinate. They live in a misty clime,\non raw meats, and wines of fire. They laugh at their fathers, and never\nsay a prayer. They pass their days in the chase, gaming, and all violent\ncourses. They have all the power of the State, and all its wealth; and\nwhen they can wring no more from their peasants, they plunder the kings\nof India.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 \u00e2\u0080\u0098But this young Englishman, you say, is pious?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Eva.\n\nAh! this young Englishman; why did he come here? What is Jerusalem to\nhim, or he to Jerusalem? His Intendant, himself a prisoner, waits here.\nI must see him; he is one of the people of my patron, which proves our\ngreat friend\u00e2\u0080\u0099s interest in this youth. O day thrice cursed! day of a\nthousand evil eyes! day of a new captivity----\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098My father, my dear father, these bursts of grief do not become your\nfame for wisdom. We must inquire, we must hold counsel. Let me see the\nIntendant of this English youth, and hear more than I have yet learnt.\nI cannot think that affairs are so hopeless as you paint them: I will\nbelieve that there is a spring near.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXI.\n\n     _Parleyings_\n\nIN AN almost circular valley, surrounded by mountains, Amalek, great\nSheikh of the Rechabite Bedouins, after having crossed the peninsula of\nPetrasa from the great Syrian desert, pitched his camp amid the\nmagnificent ruins of an ancient Idum\u00c3\u00a6an city. The pavilion of the chief,\nfacing the sunset, was raised in the arena of an amphitheatre cut out of\nthe solid rock and almost the whole of the seats of which were entire.\nThe sides of the mountains were covered with excavated tombs and\ntemples, and, perhaps, dwelling-places; at any rate, many of them were\nnow occupied by human beings. Fragments of columns were lying about, and\nmasses of unknown walls. From a defile in the mountains issued a stream,\nwhich wound about in the plain, its waters almost hid, but its course\nbeautifully indicated by the undulating shrubbery of oleanders,\nfig-trees, and willows. On one side of these, between the water and the\namphitheatre, was a crescent of black tents, groups of horses, and\ncrouching camels. Over the whole scene the sunset threw a violet hue,\nwhile the moon, broad and white, floated over the opposite hills.\n\nThe carpet of the great Sheikh was placed before his pavilion, and,\nseated on it alone, and smoking a chibouque of date wood, the patriarch\nruminated. He had no appearance of age, except from a snowy beard, which\nwas very long: a wiry man, with an unwrinkled face; dark, regular, and\nnoble features, beautiful teeth. Over his head, a crimson kefia, ribbed\nand fringed with gold; his robe was of the same colour, and his boots\nwere of red leather; the chief of one of the great tribes, and said,\nwhen they were united, to be able to bring ten thousand horsemen into\nthe field.\n\nOne at full gallop, with a long spear, at this moment darted from the\nravine, and, without stopping to answer several who addressed him,\nhurried across the plain, and did not halt until he reached the Sheikh.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Salaam, Sheikh of Sheikhs, it is done; the brother of the Queen of the\nEnglish is your slave.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Good!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Sheikh Amalek, very gravely, and taking his pipe from his\nmouth. \u00e2\u0080\u0098May your mother eat the hump of a young camel! When will they be\nhere?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098They will be the first shadows of the moon.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 \u00e2\u0080\u0098Good! is the brother of\nthe Queen with Sheikh Salem?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098There is only one God: Sheikh Salem will never drink leban again,\nunless he drink it in Paradise.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Certainly, there is only one God. What! has he fallen asleep into the\nwell of Nummula?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098No; but we have seen many evil eyes. Four hares crossed our path this\nmorning. Our salaam to the English prince was not a salaam of peace. The\nbrother of the Queen of the English is no less than an Antar. He will\nfight, yea or nay; and he has shot Sheikh Salem through the head.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098There is but one God, and His will be done. I have lost the apple of\nmine eye. The Prince of the English is alive?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098He is alive.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Good! camels shall be given to the widow of Sheikh Salem, and she shall\nbe married to a new husband. Are there other deeds of Gin?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098One grape will not make a bunch, even though it be a great one.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Let truth always be spoken. Let your words flow as the rock of Moses.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098There is only one God: if you call to Ibrahim-ben-Hassan, to Molgrabi\nTeuba, and Teuba-ben-Amin, they will not be roused from their sleep:\nthere are also wounds.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Tell all the people there is only one God: it is the Sheikh of the\nJeilaheens that has done these deeds of Gin?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Let truth always be spoken; my words shall flow as the rock of Moses.\nThe Sheikh of the Jeilaheens counselled the young man not to fight, but\nthe young man is a very Zatanai. Certainly there are many devils, but\nthere is no devil like a Frank in a round hat.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nThe evening advanced; the white moon, that had only gleamed, now\nglittered; the necks of the camels looked tall and silvery in its beam.\nThe night-fires began to blaze, the lamps to twinkle in the crescent of\ndark tents. There was a shout, a general stir, the heads of spears were\nseen glistening in the ravine. They came; a winding line of warriors.\nSome, as they emerged into the plain, galloped forward and threw their\nspears into the air; but the main body preserved an appearance of\ndiscipline, and proceeded at a slow pace to the pavilion of the Sheikh.\nA body of horsemen came first; then warriors on dromedaries; Sheikh\nHassan next, grave and erect as if nothing had happened, though he was\nwounded, and followed by his men, disarmed, though their chief retained\nhis spear. Baroni followed. He was unhurt, and rode between two\nBedouins, with whom he continually conversed. After them, the bodies of\nSheikh Salem and his comrades, covered with cloaks and stowed on camels.\nAnd then came the great prize, Tancred, mounted on a dromedary, his\nright arm bound up in a sling which Baroni had hastily made, and\nsurrounded and followed by a large troop of horsemen, who treated him\nwith the highest consideration, not only because he was a great prince,\nwhose ransom could bring many camels to their tribe, but because he had\nshown those feats of valour which the wild desert honours.\n\nNotwithstanding his wound, which, though slight, began to be painful,\nand the extreme vexation of the whole affair, Tancred could not be\ninsensible to the strange beauty of the scene which welcomed him. He\nhad read of these deserted cities, carved out of the rocks of the\nwilderness, and once the capitals of flourishing and abounding kingdoms.\n\nThey stopped before the pavilion of the great Sheikh; the arena of the\namphitheatre became filled with camels, horses, groups of warriors; many\nmounted on the seats, that they might overlook the scene, their arms and\nshawled heads glistening in the silver blaze of the moon or the ruddy\nflames of the watch-fires. They assisted Tancred to descend, they\nushered him with courtesy to their chief, who made room for Tancred on\nhis own carpet, and motioned that he should be seated by his side. A\nsmall carpet was placed for Sheikh Hassan, and another for Baroni.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Salaam, brother of many queens, all that you see is yours; Salaam\nSheikh Hassan, we are brothers. Salaam,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 added Amalek, looking at\nBaroni, \u00e2\u0080\u0098they tell me that you can speak our language, which is\nbeautiful as the moon and many palm trees; tell the prince, brother of\nmany queens, that he mistook the message that I sent him this morning,\nwhich was an invitation to a feast, not to a war. Tell him we are\nbrothers.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Tell the Sheikh,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Tancred, \u00e2\u0080\u0098that I have no appetite for feasting,\nand desire to be informed why he has made me a prisoner.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Tell the prince, brother of many queens, that he is not a prisoner, but\na guest.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Ask the Sheikh, then, whether we can depart at once.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Tell the prince, brother of many queens, that it would be rude in me to\nlet him depart to-night.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Ask the Sheikh whether I may depart in the morning.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Tell the prince that, when the morning comes, he will find I am his\nbrother.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 So saying, the great Sheikh took his pipe from his mouth and\ngave it to Tancred: the greatest of distinctions. In a few moments,\npipes were also brought to Sheikh Hassan and Baroni.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098No harm can come to you, my lord, after smoking that pipe,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said\nBaroni. \u00e2\u0080\u0098We must make the best of affairs. I have been in worse straits\nwith M. de Sidonia. What think you of Malay pirates? These are all\ngentlemen.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nWhile Baroni was speaking, a young man slowly and with dignity passed\nthrough the bystanders, advanced, and, looking very earnestly at\nTancred, seated himself on the same carpet as the grand Sheikh. This\naction alone would have betokened the quality of the newcomer, had not\nhis kefia, similar to that of Sheikh Amalek, and his whole bearing,\nclearly denoted his princely character. He was very young; and\nTancred, while he was struck by his earnest gaze, was attracted by\nhis physiognomy, which, indeed, from its refined beauty and cast of\nimpassioned intelligence, was highly interesting.\n\nPreparations all this time had been making for the feast. Half a dozen\nsheep had been given to the returning band; everywhere resounded the\ngrinding of coffee; men passed, carrying pitchers of leban and panniers\nof bread cakes hot from their simple oven. The great Sheikh, who had\nasked many questions after the oriental fashion: which was the most\npowerful nation, England or France; what was the name of a third\nEuropean nation of which he had heard, white men with flat noses in\ngreen coats; whether the nation of white men with flat noses in green\ncoats could have taken Acre as the English had, the taking of Acre being\nthe test of military prowess; how many horses the Queen of the English\nhad, and how many slaves; whether English pistols are good; whether the\nEnglish drink wine; whether the English are Christian giaours or Pagan\ngiaours? and so on, now invited Tancred, Sheikh Hassan, and two or three\nothers, to enter his pavilion and partake of the banquet.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098The Sheikh must excuse me,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Tancred to Baroni; \u00e2\u0080\u0098I am wearied and\nwounded. Ask if I can retire and have a tent.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Are you wounded?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said the young Sheikh, who was sitting on the carpet\nof Amalek, and speaking, not only in a tone of touching sympathy, but in\nthe language of Franguestan.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Not severely,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Tancred, less abruptly than he had yet spoken, for\nthe manner and the appearance of the youth touched him, \u00e2\u0080\u0098but this is\nmy first fight, and perhaps I make too much of it. However, my arm is\npainful and stiff, and indeed, you may conceive after all this, I could\nwish for a little repose.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098The great Sheikh has allotted you a compartment of his pavilion,\u00e2\u0080\u0099\nsaid the youth; \u00e2\u0080\u0098but it will prove a noisy resting-place, I fear, for a\nwounded man. I have a tent here, an humbler one, but which is at least\ntranquil. Let me be your host!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098You are most gracious, and I should be much inclined to be your guest,\nbut I am a prisoner,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he said, haughtily, \u00e2\u0080\u0098and cannot presume to follow\nmy own will.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I will arrange all,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said the youth, and he conversed with Sheikh\nAmalek for some moments. Then they all rose, the young man advancing to\nTancred, and saying in a sweet coaxing voice, \u00e2\u0080\u0098You are under my care.\nI will not be a cruel gaoler; I could not be to you.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 So saying, making\ntheir reverence to the great Sheikh, the two young men retired together\nfrom the arena. Baroni would have followed them, when the youth stopped\nhim, saying, with decision, \u00e2\u0080\u0098The great Sheikh expects your presence; you\nmust on no account be absent. I will tend your chief: you will permit\nme?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he inquired in a tone of sympathy, and then, offering to support\nthe arm of Tancred, he murmured, \u00e2\u0080\u0098It kills me to think that you are\nwounded.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nTancred was attracted to the young stranger: his prepossessing\nappearance, his soft manners, the contrast which they afforded to all\naround, and to the scenes and circumstances which Tancred had recently\nexperienced, were winning. Tancred, therefore, gladly accompanied him\nto his pavilion, which was pitched outside the amphitheatre, and stood\napart. Notwithstanding the modest description of his tent by the young\nSheikh, it was by no means inconsiderable in size, for it possessed\nseveral compartments, and was of a different colour and fashion from\nthose of the rest of the tribe. Several steeds were picketed in Arab\nfashion near its entrance, and a group of attendants, smoking and\nconversing with great animation, were sitting in a circle close at hand.\nThey pressed their hands to their hearts as Tancred and his host passed\nthem, but did not rise. Within the pavilion, Tancred found a luxurious\nmedley of cushions and soft carpets, forming a delightful divan; pipes\nand arms, and, to his great surprise, several numbers of a French\nnewspaper published at Smyrna.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Ah!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 exclaimed Tancred, throwing himself on the divan, \u00e2\u0080\u0098after all\nI have gone through to-day, this is indeed a great and an unexpected\nrelief.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098\u00e2\u0080\u0099Tis your own divan,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said the young Arab, clapping his hands; \u00e2\u0080\u0098and\nwhen I have given some orders for your comfort, I shall only be your\nguest, though not a distant one.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 He spoke some words in Arabic to an\nattendant who entered, and who returned very shortly with a silver lamp\nfed with palm oil, which he placed on the ground.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I have two poor Englishmen here,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Tancred, \u00e2\u0080\u0098my servants; they must\nbe in sad straits; unable to speak a word----\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I will give orders that they shall attend you. In the meantime you must\nrefresh yourself, however lightly, before you repose.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 At this moment\nthere entered the tent several attendants with a variety of dishes,\nwhich Tancred would have declined, but the young Sheikh, selecting one\nof them, said, \u00e2\u0080\u0098This, at least, I must urge you to taste, for it is\na favourite refreshment with us after great fatigue, and has some\nproperties of great virtue.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 So saying, he handed to Tancred a dish of\nbread, dates, and prepared cream, which Tancred, notwithstanding his\nprevious want of relish, cheerfully admitted to be excellent. After\nthis, as Tancred would partake of no other dish, pipes were brought to\nthe two young men, who, reclining on the divan, smoked and conversed.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Of all the strange things that have happened to me to-day,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said\nTancred, \u00e2\u0080\u0098not the least surprising, and certainly the most agreeable,\nhas been making your acquaintance. Your courtesy has much compensated me\nfor the rude treatment of your tribe; but, I confess, such refinement is\nwhat, under any circumstances, I should not have expected to find among\nthe tents of the desert, any more than this French journal.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I am not an Arab,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said the young man, speaking slowly and with an air\nof some embarrassment.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Ah!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 exclaimed Tancred.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I am a Christian prince.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Yes!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098A prince of the Lebanon, devoted to the English, and one who has\nsuffered much in their cause.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098You are not a prisoner here, like myself?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098No, I am here, seeking some assistance for those sufferers who should\nbe my subjects, were I not deprived of my sceptre, and they of a prince\nwhose family has reigned over and protected them for more than seven\ncenturies. The powerful tribe of which Sheikh Amalek is the head often\npitch their tents in the great Syrian desert, in the neighbourhood\nof Damascus, and there are affairs in which they can aid my unhappy\npeople.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098It is a great position, yours,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Tancred, in an animated tone, \u00e2\u0080\u0098at\nthe same time a Syrian and a Christian prince!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Yes,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said the young Emir, eagerly, \u00e2\u0080\u0098if the English would only\nunderstand their own interests, with my co-operation Syria might be\ntheirs.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098The English!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Tancred, \u00e2\u0080\u0098why should the English take Syria?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098France will take it if they do not.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I hope not,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Tancred.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098But something must be done,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said the Emir. \u00e2\u0080\u0098The Porte never could\ngovern it. Do you think anybody in Lebanon really cares for the Pasha\nof Damascus? If the Egyptians had not disarmed the mountain, the Turks\nwould be driven out of Syria in a week.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098A Syrian and a Christian prince!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Tancred, musingly. \u00e2\u0080\u0098There\nare elements in that position stronger than the Porte, stronger than\nEngland, stronger than united Europe. Syria was a great country when\nFrance and England were forests. The tricolour has crossed the Alps and\nthe Rhine, and the flag of England has beaten even the tricolour; but\nif I were a Syrian prince, I would raise the cross of Christ and ask for\nthe aid of no foreign banner.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098If I could only raise a loan,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said the Emir, \u00e2\u0080\u0098I could do without\nFrance and England.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098A loan!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 exclaimed Tancred; \u00e2\u0080\u0098I see the poison of modern liberalism has\npenetrated even the desert. Believe me, national redemption is not an\naffair of usury.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nAt this moment there was some little disturbance without the tent, which\nit seems was occasioned by the arrival of Tancred\u00e2\u0080\u0099s servants, Freeman\nand True-man. These excellent young men persisted in addressing the\nArabs in their native English, and, though we cannot for a moment\nbelieve that they fancied themselves understood, still, from a mixture\nof pride and perverseness peculiarly British, they continued their\nvaluable discourse as if every word told, or, if not apprehended, was a\nstriking proof of the sheer stupidity of their new companions. The noise\nbecame louder and louder, and at length Freeman and Trueman entered.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Well,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Tancred, \u00e2\u0080\u0098and how have you been getting on?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Well, my lord, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Freeman, with a sort of jolly sneer;\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098we have been dining with the savages.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098They are not savages, Freeman.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Well, my lord, they have not much more clothes, anyhow; and as for\nknives and forks, there is not such a thing known.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098As for that, there was not such a thing known as a fork in England\nlittle more than two hundred years ago, and we were not savages then;\nfor the best part of Montacute Castle was built long before that time.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I wish we were there, my lord!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I dare say you do: however, we must make the best of present\ncircumstances. I wanted to know, in the first place, whether you had\nfood; as for lodging, Mr. Baroni, I dare say, will manage something for\nyou; and if not, you had better quarter yourselves by the side of this\ntent. With your own cloaks and mine, you will manage very well.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Thank you, my lord. We have brought your lordship\u00e2\u0080\u0099s things with us. I\ndon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know what I shall do to-morrow about your lordship\u00e2\u0080\u0099s boots. The\nsavages have got hold of the bottle of blacking and have been drinking\nit like anything.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Never mind my boots,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Tancred, \u00e2\u0080\u0098we have got other things to think\nof now.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I told them what it was,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Freeman, \u00e2\u0080\u0098but they went on just the\nsame.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Obstinate dogs!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Tancred.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I think they took it for wine, my lord,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Trueman. \u00e2\u0080\u0098I never see\nsuch ignorant creatures.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098You find now the advantage of a good education, Trueman.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Yes, my lord, we do, and feel very grateful to your lordship\u00e2\u0080\u0099s honoured\nmother for the same. When we came down out of the mountains and see\nthose blazing fires, if I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think they were going to burn us alive,\nunless we changed our religion! I said the catechism as hard as I could\nthe whole way, and felt as much like a blessed martyr as could be.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Well, well,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Tancred, \u00e2\u0080\u0098I dare say they will spare our lives. I\ncannot much assist you here; but if there be anything you particularly\nwant, I will try and see what can be done.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nFreeman and Trueman looked at each other, and their speaking faces held\ncommon consultation. At length, the former, with some slight hesitation,\nsaid, \u00e2\u0080\u0098We don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t like to be troublesome, my lord, but if your lordship\nwould ask for some sugar for us; we cannot drink their coffee without\nsugar.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXII.\n\n    _Suspense_\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I WOULD not mention it to your lordship last night,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Baroni; \u00e2\u0080\u0098I\nthought enough had happened for one day.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098But now you think I am sufficiently fresh for new troubles.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 \u00e2\u0080\u0098He spoke\nit in Hebrew, that myself and Sheikh Hassan should not understand him,\nbut I know something of that dialect.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098In Hebrew! And why in Hebrew?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 \u00e2\u0080\u0098They follow the laws of Moses, this\ntribe.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 \u00e2\u0080\u0098Do you mean that they are Jews?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 \u00e2\u0080\u0098The Arabs are only Jews\nupon horseback,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Baroni. \u00e2\u0080\u0098This tribe, I find, call themselves\nRechabites.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Ah!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 exclaimed Tancred, and he began to muse. \u00e2\u0080\u0098I have heard of that\nname before. Is it possible,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 thought he, \u00e2\u0080\u0098that my visit to Bethany\nshould have led to this captivity?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098This affair must have been planned at Jerusalem,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Baroni; \u00e2\u0080\u0098I saw\nfrom the first it was not a common foray. These people know everything.\nThey will send immediately to Besso; they know he is your banker, and\nthat if you want to build the Temple, he must pay for it, and unless\na most immoderate ransom is given, they will carry us all into the\ninterior of the desert.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098And what do you counsel?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098In this, as in all things, to gain time; and principally because I\nam without resource, but with time expedients develop themselves.\nNaturally, what is wanted will come; expediency is a law of nature.\nThe camel is a wonderful animal, but the desert made the camel. I have\nalready impressed upon the great Sheikh that you are not a prince of\nthe blood; that your father is ruined, that there has been a murrain for\nthree years among his herds and flocks; and that, though you appear to\nbe travelling for amusement, you are, in fact, a political exile. All\nthese are grounds for a reduced ransom. At present he believes nothing\nthat I say, because his mind has been previously impressed with contrary\nand more cogent representations, but what I say will begin to work when\nhe has experienced some disappointment, and the period of re-action\narrives. Re-action is the law of society; it is inevitable. All success\ndepends upon seizing it.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098It appears to me that you are a great philosopher, Baroni,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said\nTancred.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I travelled five years with M. de Sidonia,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Baroni. \u00e2\u0080\u0098We were in\nperpetual scrapes, often worse than this, and my master moralised upon\nevery one of them. I shared his adventures, and I imbibed some of his\nwisdom; and the consequence is, that I always ought to know what to say,\nand generally what to do.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Well, here at least is some theatre for your practice; though, as far\nas I can form an opinion, our course is simple, though ignominious.\nWe must redeem ourselves from captivity. If it were only the end of\nmy crusade, one might submit to it, like Coeur de Lion, after due\nsuffering; but occurring at the commencement, the catastrophe is\nmortifying, and I doubt whether I shall have heart enough to pursue my\nway. Were I alone, I certainly would not submit to ransom. I would\nlook upon captivity as one of those trials that await me, and I would\nendeavour to extricate myself from it by courage and address, relying\never on Divine aid; but I am not alone. I have involved you in this\nmischance, and these poor Englishmen, and, it would seem, the brave\nHassan and his tribe. I can hardly ask you to make the sacrifice which I\nwould cheerfully endure; and therefore it seems to me that we have only\none course--to march under the forks.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098With submission,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Baroni, \u00e2\u0080\u0098I cannot agree with any of your\nlordship\u00e2\u0080\u0099s propositions. You take an extreme view of our case. Extreme\nviews are never just; something always turns up which disturbs\nthe calculations formed upon their decided data. This something is\ncircumstance. Circumstance has decided every crisis which I have\nexperienced, and not the primitive facts on which we have consulted.\nRest assured that circumstance will clear us now.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I see no room, in our situation, for the accidents on which you rely,\u00e2\u0080\u0099\nsaid Tancred. \u00e2\u0080\u0098Circumstance, as you call it, is the creature of cities,\nwhere the action of a multitude, influenced by different motives,\nproduces innumerable and ever-changing combinations; but we are in the\ndesert. The great Sheikh will never change his mind any more than his\nhabits of life, which are the same as his ancestors pursued thousands of\nyears ago; and, for an identical reason, he is isolated and superior to\nall influences.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Something always turns up,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Baroni.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098It seems to me that we are in a _cul-de-sac_,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Tancred.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098There is always an outlet; one can escape from a _cul-de-sac_ by a\nwindow.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Do you think it would be advisable to consult the master of this tent?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\nsaid Tancred, in a lower tone. \u00e2\u0080\u0098He is very friendly.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098The Emir Fakredeen,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Baroni.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Is that his name?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098So I learnt last night. He is a prince of the house of Shehaab; a great\nhouse, but fallen.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098He is a Christian,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Tancred, earnestly.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Is he?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Baroni carelessly; \u00e2\u0080\u0098I have known a good many Shehaabs, and\nif you will tell me their company, I will tell you their creed.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098He might give us some advice.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098No doubt of it, my lord; if advice could break our chains, we should\nsoon be free; but in these countries my only confidant is my camel.\nAssuming that this affair is to end in a ransom, what we want now is to\nchange the impressions of the great Sheikh respecting your wealth. This\ncan only be done from the same spot where the original ideas emanated.\nI must induce him to permit me to accompany his messenger to Besso. This\nmission will take time, and he who gains time gains everything, as M.\nde Sidonia said to me when the savages were going to burn us alive, and\nthere came on a thunder-storm which extinguished their fagots.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098You must really tell me your history some day, Baroni,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Tancred.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098When my mission has failed. It will perhaps relieve your imprisonment;\nat present, I repeat, we must work for a moderate ransom, instead of the\nmillions of which they talk, and during the negotiation take the chance\nof some incident which will more agreeably free us.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Ah! I despair of that.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I do not, for it is presumptuous to believe that man can foresee the\nfuture, which will be your lordship\u00e2\u0080\u0099s case, if you owe your freedom only\nto your piastres.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098But they say that everything is calculation, Baroni.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098No,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Baroni, with energy, \u00e2\u0080\u0098everything is adventure.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nIn the meantime the Emir Fakredeen was the prey of contending emotions.\nTancred had from the first, and in an instant, exercised over his\nsusceptible temperament that magnetic influence to which he was so\nstrangely subject. In the heart of the wilderness and in the person\nof his victim, the young Emir suddenly recognised the heroic character\nwhich he had himself so vaguely and, as it now seemed to him, so vainly\nattempted to realise. The appearance and the courage of Tancred, the\nthoughtful repose of his manner, his high bearing amid the distressful\ncircumstances in which he was involved, and the large views which the\nfew words that had escaped from him on the preceding evening would\nintimate that he took of public transactions, completely captivated\nFakredeen, who seemed at length to have found the friend for whom he\nhad often sighed; the steadfast and commanding spirit, whose control,\nhe felt conscious, was often required by his quick but whimsical\ntemperament. And in what relation did he stand to this being whom he\nlonged to press to his heart, and then go forth with him and conquer\nthe world? It would not bear contemplation. The arming of the Maronites\nbecame quite a secondary object in comparison with obtaining the\nfriendship of Tancred. Would that he had not involved himself in this\nconspiracy! and yet, but for this conspiracy, Tancred and himself\nmight never have met. It was impossible to grapple with the question;\ncircumstances must be watched, and some new combination formed to\nextricate both of them from their present perplexed position.\n\nFakredeen sent one of his attendants in the morning to offer Tancred\nhorses, should his guest, as is the custom of Englishmen, care to\nexplore the neighbouring ruins which were celebrated; but Tancred\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nwound kept him confined to his tent. Then the Emir begged permission to\npay him a visit, which was to have lasted only a quarter of an hour;\nbut when Fakredeen had once established himself in the divan with his\nnargileh, he never quitted it. It would have been difficult for Tancred\nto have found a more interesting companion; impossible to have made an\nacquaintance more singularly unreserved. His frankness was startling.\nTancred had no experience of such self-revelations; such a jumble of\nsublime aspirations and equivocal conduct; such a total disregard\nof means, such complicated plots, such a fertility of perplexed and\ntenebrous intrigue! The animated manner and the picturesque phrase, too,\nin which all this was communicated, heightened the interest and effect.\nFakredeen sketched a character in a sentence, and you knew instantly the\nindividual whom he described without any personal knowledge. Unlike the\nOrientals in general, his gestures were as vivid as his words. He acted\nthe interviews, he achieved the adventures before you. His voice could\ntake every tone and his countenance every form. In the midst of all\nthis, bursts of plaintive melancholy; sometimes the anguish of a\nsensibility too exquisite, alternating with a devilish mockery and a\nfatal absence of all self-respect.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098It appears to me,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Tancred, when the young Emir had declared his\nstar accursed, since, after the ceaseless exertions of years, he was\nstill as distant as ever from the accomplishment of his purpose, \u00e2\u0080\u0098it\nappears to me that your system is essentially erroneous. I do not\nbelieve that anything great is ever effected by management. All this\nintrigue, in which you seem such an adept, might be of some service in\na court or in an exclusive senate; but to free a nation you require\nsomething more vigorous and more simple. This system of intrigue in\nEurope is quite old-fashioned. It is one of the superstitions left us by\nthe wretched eighteenth century, a period when aristocracy was rampant\nthroughout Christendom; and what were the consequences? All faith in God\nor man, all grandeur of purpose, all nobility of thought, and all beauty\nof sentiment, withered and shrivelled up. Then the dexterous management\nof a few individuals, base or dull, was the only means of success.\nBut we live in a different age: there are popular sympathies, however\nimperfect, to appeal to; we must recur to the high primeval practice,\nand address nations now as the heroes, and prophets, and legislators\nof antiquity. If you wish to free your country, and make the Syrians\na nation, it is not to be done by sending secret envoys to Paris or\nLondon, cities themselves which are perhaps both doomed to fall; you\nmust act like Moses and Mahomet.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098But you forget the religions,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Fakredeen. \u00e2\u0080\u0098I have so many\nreligions to deal with. If my fellows were all Christians, or all\nMoslemin, or all Jews, or all Pagans, I grant you, something might be\neffected: the cross, the crescent, the ark, or an old stone, anything\nwould do: I would plant it on the highest range in the centre of the\ncountry, and I would carry Damascus and Aleppo both in one campaign;\nbut I am debarred from this immense support; I could only preach\nnationality, and, as they all hate each other worse almost than they do\nthe Turks, that would not be very inviting; nationality, without race as\na plea, is like the smoke of this nargileh, a fragrant puff. Well, then,\nthere remains only personal influence: ancient family, vast possessions,\nand traditionary power: mere personal influence can only be maintained\nby management, by what you stigmatise as intrigue; and the most\ndexterous member of the Shehaab family will be, in the long run, Prince\nof Lebanon.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098And if you wish only to be Prince of Lebanon, I dare say you may\nsucceed,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Tancred, \u00e2\u0080\u0098and perhaps with much less pains than you at\npresent give yourself. But what becomes of all your great plans of\nan hour ago, when you were to conquer the East, and establish the\nindependence of the Oriental races?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Ah!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 exclaimed Fakredeen with a sigh, \u00e2\u0080\u0098these are the only ideas for\nwhich it is worth while to live.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098The world was never conquered by intrigue: it was conquered by faith.\nNow, I do not see that you have faith in anything.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Faith,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Fakredeen, musingly, as if his ear had caught the word\nfor the first time, \u00e2\u0080\u0098faith! that is a grand idea. If one could only have\nfaith in something and conquer the world!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098See now,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Tancred, with unusual animation, \u00e2\u0080\u0098I find no charm in\nconquering the world to establish a dynasty: a dynasty, like everything\nelse, wears out; indeed, it does not last as long as most things; it\nhas a precipitate tendency to decay. There are reasons; we will not now\ndwell on them. One should conquer the world not to enthrone a man,\nbut an idea, for ideas exist for ever. But what idea? There is the\ntouchstone of all philosophy! Amid the wreck of creeds, the crash of\nempires, French revolutions, English reforms, Catholicism in agony, and\nProtestantism in convulsions, discordant Europe demands the keynote,\nwhich none can sound. If Asia be in decay, Europe is in confusion. Your\nrepose may be death, but our life is anarchy.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I am thinking,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Fakredeen, thoughtfully, \u00e2\u0080\u0098how we in Syria could\npossibly manage to have faith in anything; I had faith in Mehemet Ali,\nbut he is a Turk, and that upset him. If, instead of being merely a\nrebellious Pasha, he had placed himself at the head of the Arabs, and\nrevived the Caliphate, you would have seen something. Head the desert\nand you may do anything. But it is so difficult. If you can once get\nthe tribes out of it, they will go anywhere. See what they did when they\nlast came forth. It is a simoom, a kamsin, fatal, irresistible. They are\nas fresh, too, as ever. The Arabs are always young; it is the only race\nthat never withers. I am an Arab myself; from my ancestor who was the\nstandard-bearer of the Prophet, the consciousness of race is the only\ncircumstance that sometimes keeps up my spirit.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I am an Arab only in religion,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Tancred, \u00e2\u0080\u0098but the consciousness\nof creed sustains me. I know well, though born in a distant and northern\nisle, that the Creator of the world speaks with man only in this land;\nand that is why I am here.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nThe young Emir threw an earnest glance at his companion, whose\ncountenance, though grave, was calm. \u00e2\u0080\u0098Then you have faith?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said\nFakredeen, inquiringly.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I have passive faith,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Tancred. \u00e2\u0080\u0098I know that there is a Deity who\nhas revealed his will at intervals during different ages; but of his\npresent purpose I feel ignorant, and therefore I have not active\nfaith; I know not what to do, and should be reduced to a mere spiritual\nslothfulness, had I not resolved to struggle with this fearful\nnecessity, and so embarked in this great pilgrimage which has so\nstrangely brought us together.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098But you have your sacred books to consult?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Fakredeen.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098There were sacred books when Jehovah conferred with Solomon; there\nwas a still greater number of sacred books when Jehovah inspired the\nprophets; the sacred writings were yet more voluminous when the Creator\nordained that there should be for human edification a completely new\nseries of inspired literature. Nearly two thousand years have passed\nsince the last of those works appeared. It is a greater interval than\nelapsed between the writings of Malachi and the writings of Matthew.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098The prior of the Maronite convent, at Mar Hanna, has often urged on me,\nas conclusive evidence of the falseness of Mahomet\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mission, that our\nLord Jesus declared that after him \u00e2\u0080\u009cmany false prophets should arise,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n and warned his followers.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098There spoke the Prince of Israel,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Tancred, \u00e2\u0080\u0098not the universal\nRedeemer. He warned his tribe against the advent of false Messiahs,\nno more. Far from terminating by his coming the direct communication\nbetween God and man, his appearance was only the herald of a relation\nbetween the Creator and his creatures more fine, more permanent, and\nmore express. The inspiring and consoling influence of the Paraclete\nonly commenced with the ascension of the Divine Son. In this fact,\nperhaps, may be found a sufficient reason why no written expression\nof the celestial will has subsequently appeared. But, instead of\nforeclosing my desire for express communication, it would, on the\ncontrary, be a circumstance to authorise it.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Then how do you know that Mahomet was not inspired?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Fakredeen.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Far be it from me to impugn the divine commission of any of the seed\nof Abraham,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 replied Tancred. \u00e2\u0080\u0098There are doctors of our church who\nrecognise the sacred office of Mahomet, though they hold it to be, what\ndivine commissions, with the great exception, have ever been, limited\nand local.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098God has never spoken to a European?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Fakredeen, inquiringly.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Never.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098But you are a European?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098And your inference is just,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Tancred, in an agitated voice, and\nwith a changing countenance. \u00e2\u0080\u0098It is one that has for some time haunted\nmy soul. In England, when I prayed in vain for enlightenment, I at last\ninduced myself to believe that the Supreme Being would not deign to\nreveal His will unless in the land which his presence had rendered holy;\nbut since I have been a dweller within its borders, and poured forth\nmy passionate prayers at all its holy places, and received no sign, the\ndesolating thought has sometimes come over my spirit, that there is\na qualification of blood as well as of locality necessary for this\ncommunion, and that the favoured votary must not only kneel in the Holy\nLand but be of the holy race.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I am an Arab,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Fakredeen. \u00e2\u0080\u0098It is something.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098If I were an Arab in race as well as in religion,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Tancred, \u00e2\u0080\u0098I\nwould not pass my life in schemes to govern some mountain tribes.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll tell you,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said the Emir, springing from his divan, and flinging\nthe tube of his nargileh to the other end of the tent: \u00e2\u0080\u0098the game is\nin our hands, if we have energy. There is a combination which would\nentirely change the whole \u00e2\u0080\u0098face of the world, and bring back empire to\nthe East. Though you are not the brother of the Queen of the English,\nyou are nevertheless a great English prince, and the Queen will listen\nto what you say; especially if you talk to her as you talk to me, and\nsay such fine things in such a beautiful voice. Nobody ever opened my\nmind like you. You will magnetise the Queen as you have magnetised me.\nGo back to England and arrange this. You see, gloze it over as they may,\none thing is clear, it is finished with England. There are three things\nwhich alone must destroy it. Primo, O\u00e2\u0080\u0099Connell appropriating to himself\nthe revenues of half of Her Majesty\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dominions. Secondo, the cottons;\nthe world begins to get a little disgusted with those cottons; naturally\neverybody prefers silk; I am sure that the Lebanon in time could supply\nthe whole world with silk, if it were properly administered. Thirdly,\nsteam; with this steam your great ships have become a respectable Noah\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nark. The game is up; Louis Philippe can take Windsor Castle whenever he\npleases, as you took Acre, with the wind in his teeth. It is all over,\nthen. Now, see a _coup d\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00c3\u00a9tat_ that saves all. You must perform the\nPortuguese scheme on a great scale; quit a petty and exhausted position\nfor a vast and prolific empire. Let the Queen of the English collect a\ngreat fleet, let her stow away all her treasure, bullion, gold plate,\nand precious arms; be accompanied by all her court and chief people,\nand transfer the seat of her empire from London to Delhi. There she\nwill find an immense empire ready made, a firstrate army, and a large\nrevenue. In the meantime I will arrange with Mehemet Ali.\n\nHe shall have Bagdad and Mesopotamia, and pour the Bedouin cavalry into\nPersia. I will take care of Syria and Asia Minor. The only way to manage\nthe Afghans is by Persia and by the Arabs. We will acknowledge the\nEmpress of India as our suzerain, and secure for her the Levantine\ncoast. If she like, she shall have Alexandria as she now has Malta: it\ncould be arranged. Your Queen is young; she has an _avenir_. Aberdeen\nand Sir Peel will never give her this advice; their habits are formed.\nThey are too old, too _rus\u00c3\u00a9s_. But, you see! the greatest empire that\never existed; besides which she gets rid of the embarrassment of her\nChambers! And quite practicable; for the only difficult part, the\nconquest of India, which baffled Alexander, is all done!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIII.\n\n     _A Pilgrim to Mount Sinai_\n\nIT WAS not so much a conviction as a suspicion that Tancred had conveyed\nto the young Emir, when the pilgrim had confessed that the depressing\nthought sometimes came over him, that he was deficient in that\nqualification of race which was necessary for the high communion to\nwhich he aspired. Four-and-twenty hours before he was not thus dejected.\nAlmost within sight of Sinai, he was still full of faith. But his\nvexatious captivity, and the enfeebling consequences of this wound,\ndulled his spirit. Alone, among strangers and foes, in pain and in\nperil, and without that energy which finds excitement in difficulty,\nand can mock at danger, which requires no counsellor but our own quick\nbrain, and no champion but our own right arm, the high spirit of Tancred\nfor the first time flagged. As the twilight descended over the rocky\ncity, its sculptured tombs and excavated temples, and its strewn remains\nof palaces and theatres, his heart recurred with tenderness to the halls\nand towers of Montacute and Bellamont, and the beautiful affections\nbeneath those stately roofs, that, urged on, as he had once thought,\nby a divine influence, now, as he was half tempted to credit, by a\nfantastic impulse, he had dared to desert. Brooding in dejection, his\neyes were suffused with tears.\n\nIt was one of those moments of amiable weakness which make us all akin,\nwhen sublime ambition, the mystical predispositions of genius, the\nsolemn sense of duty, all the heaped-up lore of ages, and the dogmas of\na high philosophy alike desert us, or sink into nothingness. The voice\nof his mother sounded in his ear, and he was haunted by his father\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nanxious glance. Why was he there? Why was he, the child of a northern\nisle, in the heart of the Stony Arabia, far from the scene of his birth\nand of his duties? A disheartening, an awful question, which, if it\ncould not be satisfactorily answered by Tancred of Montacute, it seemed\nto him that his future, wherever or however passed, must be one of\nintolerable bale.\n\nWas he, then, a stranger there? uncalled, unexpected, intrusive,\nunwelcome? Was it a morbid curiosity, or the proverbial restlessness of\na satiated aristocrat, that had drawn him to these wilds? What wilds?\nHad he no connection with them? Had he not from his infancy repeated, in\nthe congregation of his people, the laws which, from the awful summit of\nthese surrounding mountains, the Father of all had Himself delivered for\nthe government of mankind? These Arabian laws regulated his life.\nAnd the wanderings of an Arabian tribe in this \u00e2\u0080\u0098great and terrible\nwilderness,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 under the immediate direction of the Creator, sanctified by\nHis miracles, governed by His counsels, illumined by His presence, had\nbeen the first and guiding history that had been entrusted to his young\nintelligence, from which it had drawn its first pregnant examples\nof human conduct and divine interposition, and formed its first dim\nconceptions of the relations between man and God. Why, then, he had a\nright to be here! He had a connection with these regions; they had a\nhold upon him. He was not here like an Indian Brahmin, who visits Europe\nfrom a principle of curiosity, however rational or however refined. The\nland which the Hindoo visits is not his land, nor his father\u00e2\u0080\u0099s land; the\nlaws which regulate it are not his laws, and the faith which fills its\ntemples is not the revelation that floats upon his sacred Ganges. But\nfor this English youth, words had been uttered and things done, more\nthan thirty centuries ago, in this stony wilderness, which influenced\nhis opinions and regulated his conduct every day of his life, in that\ndistant and seagirt home, which, at the time of their occurrence, was\nnot as advanced in civilisation as the Polynesian groups or the islands\nof New Zealand. The life and property of England are protected by the\nlaws of Sinai. The hard-working people of England are secured in every\nseven days a day of rest by the laws of Sinai. And yet they persecute\nthe Jews, and hold up to odium the race to whom they are indebted for\nthe sublime legislation which alleviates the inevitable lot of the\nlabouring multitude!\n\nAnd when that labouring multitude cease for a while from a toil which\nequals almost Egyptian bondage, and demands that exponent of the\nmysteries of the heart, that soother of the troubled spirit, which\npoetry can alone afford, to whose harp do the people of England fly for\nsympathy and solace? Who is the most popular poet in this country? Is\nhe to be found among the Mr. Wordsworths and the Lord Byrons, amid\nsauntering reveries or monologues of sublime satiety? Shall we seek him\namong the wits of Queen Anne? Even to the myriad-minded Shakespeare can\nwe award the palm? No; the most popular poet in England is the sweet\nsinger of Israel. Since the days of the heritage, when every man dwelt\nsafely under his vine and under his fig tree, there never was a race who\nsang so often the odes of David as the people of Great Britain.\n\nVast as the obligations of the whole human family are to the Hebrew\nrace, there is no portion of the modern population so much indebted to\nthem as the British people. It was \u00e2\u0080\u0098the sword of the Lord and of Gideon\u00e2\u0080\u0099\nthat won the boasted liberties of England; chanting the same canticles\nthat cheered the heart of Judah amid their glens, the Scotch, upon their\nhillsides, achieved their religious freedom.\n\nThen why do these Saxon and Celtic societies persecute an Arabian race,\nfrom whom they have adopted laws of sublime benevolence, and in\nthe pages of whose literature they have found perpetual delight,\ninstruction, and consolation? That is a great question, which, in\nan enlightened age, may be fairly asked, but to which even the\nself-complacent nineteenth century would find some difficulty in\ncontributing a reply. Does it stand thus? Independently of their\nadmirable laws which have elevated our condition, and of their exquisite\npoetry which has charmed it; independently of their heroic history which\nhas animated us to the pursuit of public liberty, we are indebted to the\nHebrew people for our knowledge of the true God and for the redemption\nfrom our sins.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Then I have a right to be here,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Tancred of Montacute, as his eyes\nwere fixed in abstraction on the stars of Arabia; \u00e2\u0080\u0098I am not a travelling\ndilettante, mourning over a ruin, or in ecstasies at a deciphered\ninscription. I come to the land whose laws I obey, whose religion I\nprofess, and I seek, upon its sacred soil, those sanctions which for\nages were abundantly accorded. The angels who visited the Patriarchs,\nand announced the advent of the Judges, who guided the pens of Prophets\nand bore tidings to the Apostles, spoke also to the Shepherds in the\nfield. I look upon the host of heaven; do they no longer stand before\nthe Lord? Where are the Cherubim, where the Seraphs? Where is Michael\nthe Destroyer? Gabriel of a thousand missions?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nAt this moment, the sound of horsemen recalled Tancred from his reverie,\nand, looking up, he observed a group of Arabs approaching him, three\nof whom were mounted. Soon he recognised the great Sheikh Amalek, and\nHassan, the late commander of his escort. The young Syrian Emir was\ntheir companion. This was a visit of hospitable ceremony from the great\nSheikh to his distinguished prisoner. Amalek, pressing his hand to his\nheart, gave Tancred the salute of peace, and then, followed by Hassan,\nwho had lost nothing of his calm self-respect, but who conducted himself\nas if he were still free, the great Sheikh seated himself on the\ncarpet that was spread before the tent, and took the pipe, which\nwas immediately offered him by Freeman and Trueman, following the\ninstructions of an attendant of the Emir Fakredeen.\n\nAfter the usual compliments and some customary observations about horses\nand pistols, Fakredeen, who had seated himself close to Tancred, with a\nkind of shrinking cajolery, as if he were seeking the protection of some\nsuperior being, addressing Amalek in a tone of easy assurance, which\nremarkably contrasted with the sentimental deference he displayed\ntowards his prisoner, said:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Sheikh of Sheikhs, there is but one God: now is it Allah, or Jehovah?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098The palm tree is sometimes called a date tree,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 replied Amalek, \u00e2\u0080\u0098but\nthere is only one tree.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Good,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Fakredeen, \u00e2\u0080\u0098but you do not pray to Allah?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I pray as my fathers prayed,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Amalek.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098And you pray to Jehovah?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098It is said.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Sheikh Hassan,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said the Emir, \u00e2\u0080\u0098there is but one God, and his name is\nJehovah. Why do you not pray to Jehovah?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Truly there is but one God,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Sheikh Hassan, \u00e2\u0080\u0098and Mahomet is his\nProphet. He told my fathers to pray to Allah, and to Allah I pray.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Is Mahomet the prophet of God, Sheikh of Sheikhs?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098It may be,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 replied Amalek, with a nod of assent.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Then why do you not pray as Sheikh Hassan?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Because Moses, without doubt the prophet of God,--for all believe in\nhim, Sheikh Hassan, and Emir Fakredeen, and you too, Prince, brother of\nqueens,--married into our family and taught us to pray to Jehovah. There\nmay be other prophets, but the children of Jethro would indeed ride on\nasses were they not content with Moses.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098And you have his five books?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 inquired Tancred.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098We had them from the beginning, and we shall keep them to the end.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098And you learnt in them that Moses married the daughter of Jethro?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Did I learn in them that I have wells and camels? We want no books to\ntell us who married our daughters.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098And yet it is not yesterday that Moses fled from Egypt into Midian?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098It is not yesterday for those who live in cities, where they say at\none gate that it is morning, and at another it is night. Where men tell\nlies, the deed of the dawn is the secret of sunset. But in the desert\nnothing changes; neither the acts of a man\u00e2\u0080\u0099s life, nor the words of a\nman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lips. We drink at the same well where Moses helped Zipporah,\nwe tend the same flocks, we live under the same tents; our words have\nchanged as little as our waters, our habits, or our dwellings. What my\nfather learnt from those before him, he delivered to me, and I have told\nit to my son. What is time and what is truth, that I should forget that\na prophet of Jehovah married into my house?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Where little is done, little is said,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 observed Sheikh Hassan, \u00e2\u0080\u0098and\nsilence is the mother of truth.\n\nSince the Hegira, nothing has happened in Arabia, and before that was\nMoses, and before him the giants.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Let truth always be spoken,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Amalek; \u00e2\u0080\u0098your words are a flowing\nstream, and the children of Rechab and the tribes of the Senites never\njoined him of Mecca, for they had the five books, and they said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cIs\nnot that enough?\u00e2\u0080\u009d They withdrew to the Syrian wilderness, and they\nmultiplied. But the sons of Koreidha, who also had the five books,\nbut who were not children of Rechab, but who came into the desert near\nMedina after Nebuchadnezzar had destroyed El Khuds, they first joined\nhim of Mecca, and then they made war on him, and he broke their bows and\nled them into captivity; and they are to be found in the cities of Yemen\nto this day; the children of Israel who live in the cities of Yemen are\nthe tribe of Koreidha.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Unhappy sons of Koreidha, who made war upon the Prophet, and who live\nin cities!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Sheikh Hassan, taking a fresh pipe.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098And perhaps,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said the young Emir, \u00e2\u0080\u0098if you had not been children of\nJethro, you might have acknowledged him of Mecca, Sheikh of Sheikhs.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098There is but one God,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Amalek; \u00e2\u0080\u0098but there may be many prophets. It\nbecomes not a son of jethro to seek other than Moses. But I will not say\nthat the Koran comes not from God, since it was written by one who\nwas of the tribe of Koreish, and the tribe of Koreish are the lineal\ndescendants of Ibrahim.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098And you believe that the Word of God could come only to the seed of\nAbraham?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 asked Tancred, eagerly.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I and my fathers have watered our flocks in the wilderness since time\nwas,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 replied Amalek; \u00e2\u0080\u0098we have seen the Pharaohs, and Nebuchadnezzar,\nand Iskander, and the Romans, and the Sultan of the French: they\nconquered everything except us; and where are they? They are sand. Let\nmen doubt of unicorns: but of one thing there can be no doubt, that God\nnever spoke except to an Arab.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nTancred covered his face with his hands. Then, after a few moments\u00e2\u0080\u0099\npause, looking up, he said, \u00e2\u0080\u0098Sheikh of Sheikhs, I am your prisoner; and\nwas, when you captured me, a pilgrim to Mount Sinai, a spot which, in\nyour belief, is not less sacred than in mine. We are, as I have learned,\nonly two days\u00e2\u0080\u0099 journey from that holy place. Grant me this boon, that I\nmay at once proceed thither, guarded as you will. I pledge you the word\nof a Christian noble, that I will not attempt to escape. Long before\nyou have received a reply from Jerusalem, I shall have returned; and\nwhatever may be the result of the visit of Baroni, I shall, at least,\nhave fulfilled my pilgrimage.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Prince, brother of queens,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 replied Amalek, with that politeness which\nis the characteristic of the Arabian chieftains; \u00e2\u0080\u0098under my tents you\nhave only to command; go where you like, return when you please. My\nchildren shall attend you as your guardians, not as your guards.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 And\nthe great Sheikh rose and retired.\n\nTancred re-entered his tent, and, reclining, fell into a reverie of\ndistracting thoughts. The history of his life and mind seemed with a\nwhirling power to pass before him; his birth, in clime unknown to the\nPatriarchs; his education, unconsciously to himself, in an Arabian\nliterature; his imbibing, from his tender infancy, oriental ideas and\noriental creeds; the contrast that the occidental society in which he\nhad been reared presented to them; his dissatisfaction with that social\nsystem; his conviction of the growing melancholy of enlightened Europe,\nveiled, as it may be, with sometimes a conceited bustle, sometimes a\ndesperate shipwreck gaiety, sometimes with all the exciting empiricism\nof science; his perplexity that, between the Asian revelation and the\nEuropean practice there should be so little conformity, and why the\nrelations between them should be so limited and imperfect; above all,\nhis passionate desire to penetrate the mystery of the elder world, and\nshare its celestial privileges and divine prerogative. Tancred sighed.\n\nHe looked round; some one had gently drawn his hand. It was the young\nEmir kneeling, his beautiful blue eyes bedewed with tears.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098You are unhappy, said Fakredeen, in a tone of plaintiveness.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098It is the doom of man,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 replied Tancred; \u00e2\u0080\u0098and in my position sadness\nshould not seem strange.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098The curse of ten thousand mothers on those who made you a prisoner; the\ncurse of twenty thousand mothers on him who inflicted on you a wound!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098\u00e2\u0080\u0099Tis the fortune of life,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Tancred, more cheerfully; \u00e2\u0080\u0098and in truth\nI was perhaps thinking of other things.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Do you know why I trouble you when your heart is dark?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said the young\nEmir. \u00e2\u0080\u0098See now, if you will it, you are free. The great Sheikh has\nconsented that you should go to Sinai. I have two dromedaries here,\nfleeter than the Kamsin. At the well of Mokatteb, where we encamp for\nthe night, I will serve raki to the Bedouins; I have some with me,\nstrong enough to melt the snow of Lebanon; if it will not do, they shall\nsmoke some timbak, that will make them sleep like pashas. I know this\ndesert as a man knows his father\u00e2\u0080\u0099s house; we shall be at Hebron before\nthey untie their eyelids. Tell me, is it good?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Were I alone,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Tancred, \u00e2\u0080\u0098without a single guard, I must return.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Why?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Because I have pledged the word of a Christian noble.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098To a man who does not believe in Christ. Faugh! Is it not itself a sin\nto keep faith with heretics?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098But is he one?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Tancred. \u00e2\u0080\u0098He believes in Moses; he disbelieves in\nnone of the seed of Abraham. He is of that seed himself! Would I were\nsuch a heretic as Sheikh Amalek!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098If you will only pay me a visit in the Lebanon, I would introduce you\nto our patriarch, and he would talk as much theology with you as you\nlike. For my own part it is not a kind of knowledge that I have much\ncultivated; you know I am peculiarly situated, we have so many religions\non the mountain; but time presses; tell me, my prince, shall Hebron be\nour point?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098If Amalek believed in Baal, I must return,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Tancred; \u00e2\u0080\u0098even if it\nwere to certain death. Besides, I could not desert my men; and Baroni,\nwhat would become of him?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098We could easily make some plan that would extricate them. Dismiss them\nfrom your mind, and trust yourself to me. I know nothing that would\ndelight me more than to baulk these robbers of their prey.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I should not talk of such things,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Tancred; \u00e2\u0080\u0098I must remain here,\nor I must return.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098What can you want to do on Mount Sinai?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 murmured the prince rather\npettishly. \u00e2\u0080\u0098Now if it were Mount Lebanon, and you had a wish to employ\nyourself, there is an immense field! We might improve the condition\nof the people; we might establish manufactures, stimulate agriculture\nextend commerce get an appalto of the silk, buy it all up at sixty\npiastres per oke, and sell it at Marseilles at two hundred and at the\nsame time advance the interests of true religion as much as you please.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIV.\n\n     _In the Valley of the Shadow_\n\nTHEN days had elapsed since the capture of Tancred; Amalek and his Arabs\nwere still encamped in the rocky city; the beams of the early sun were\njust rising over the crest of the amphitheatre, when four horsemen, who\nwere recognised as the children of Rechab, issued from the ravine. They\ngalloped over the plain, shouted, and threw their lances in the air.\nFrom the crescent of black tents came forth the warriors, some mounted\ntheir horses and met their returning brethren, others prepared their\nwelcome. The horses neighed, the camels stirred their long necks. All\nliving things seemed conscious that an event had occurred.\n\nThe four horsemen were surrounded by their brethren; but one of them,\ngiving and returning blessings, darted forward to the pavilion of the\ngreat Sheikh.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Have you brought camels, Shedad, son of Amroo?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 inquired one of the\nwelcomers to the welcomed.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098We have been to El Khuds,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 was the reply. \u00e2\u0080\u0098What we have brought back is\na seal of Solomon.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098From Mount Seir to the City of the Friend, what have you seen in the\njoyful land?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098We found the sons of Hamar by the well-side of Jumda; we found the\nmarks of many camels in the pass of Gharendel, and the marks in the pass\nof Gharendel were not the marks of the camels of the Beni-Hamar.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I had a dream, and the children of Tora said to me, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWho art thou in\nthe hands of our father\u00e2\u0080\u0099s flocks? Are none but the sons of Rechab to\ndrink the sweet waters of Edom?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Methinks the marks in the pass of\nGharendel were the marks of the camels of the children of Tora.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098There is a feud between the Beni-Tora and the Beni-Hamar,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 replied the\nother Arab, shaking his head. \u00e2\u0080\u0098The Beni-Tora are in the wilderness of\nAkiba, and the Beni-Hamar have burnt their tents and captured their\ncamels and their women. This is why the sons of Hamar are watering their\nflocks by the well of Jumda.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nIn the meantime, the caravan, of which the four horsemen were the\nadvanced guard, issued from the pass into the plain.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Shedad, son of Amroo,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 exclaimed one of the Bedouins, \u00e2\u0080\u0098what! have you\ncaptured an harem?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 For he beheld dromedaries and veiled women.\n\nThe great Sheikh came forth from his pavilion and sniffed the morning\nair; a dignified smile played over his benignant features, and once he\nsmoothed his venerable beard.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098My son-in-law is a true son of Israel,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he murmured complacently to\nhimself. \u00e2\u0080\u0098He will trust his gold only to his own blood.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nThe caravan wound about the plain, then crossed the stream at the\naccustomed ford, and approached the amphitheatre.\n\nThe horsemen halted, some dismounted, the dromedaries knelt down, Baroni\nassisted one of the riders from her seat; the great Sheikh advanced and\nsaid, \u00e2\u0080\u0098Welcome in the name of God! welcome with a thousand blessings!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I come in the name of God; I come with a thousand blessings,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 replied\nthe lady.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098And with a thousand something else,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 thought Amalek to himself; but\nthe Arabs are so polished that they never make unnecessary allusions to\nbusiness.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Had I thought the Queen of Sheba was going to pay me a visit,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said the\ngreat Sheikh, \u00e2\u0080\u0098I would have brought the pavilion of Miriam. How is the\nRose of Sharon?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he continued, as he ushered Eva into his tent. \u00e2\u0080\u0098How is\nthe son of my heart; how is Besso, more generous than a thousand kings?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Speak not of the son of thy heart,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Eva, seating herself on the\ndivan. \u00e2\u0080\u0098Speak not of Besso, the generous and the good, for his head is\nstrewn with ashes, and his mouth is full of sand.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098What is this?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 thought Amalek. \u00e2\u0080\u0098Besso is not ill, or his daughter would\nnot be here. This arrow flies not straight. Does he want to scrape my\npiastres? These sons of Israel that dwell in cities will mix their pens\nwith our spears. I will be obstinate as an Azafeer camel.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nSlaves now entered, bringing coffee and bread, the Sheikh asking\nquestions as they ate, as to the time Eva quitted Jerusalem, her\nhalting-places in the desert, whether she had met with any tribes; then\nhe offered to his granddaughter his own chibouque, which she took\nwith ceremony, and instantly returned, while they brought her aromatic\nnargileh.\n\nEva scanned the imperturbable countenance of her grandfather: calm,\npolite, benignant, she knew the great Sheikh too well to suppose for\na moment that its superficial expression was any indication of his\ninnermost purpose. Suddenly she said, in a somewhat careless tone, \u00e2\u0080\u0098And\nwhy is the Lord of the Syrian pastures in this wilderness, that has been\nso long accursed?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nThe great Sheikh took his pipe from his mouth, and then slowly sent\nforth its smoke through his nostrils, a feat of which he was proud. Then\nhe placidly replied: \u00e2\u0080\u0098For the same reason that the man named Baroni made\na visit to El Khuds.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098The man named Baroni came to demand succour for his lord, who is your\nprisoner.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098And also to obtain two millions of piastres,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 added Amalek.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Two millions of piastres! Why not at once ask for the throne of\nSolomon?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Which would be given, if required,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 rejoined Amalek. \u00e2\u0080\u0098Was it not said\nin the divan of Besso, that if this Prince of Franguestan wished to\nrebuild the Temple, the treasure would not be wanting?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Said by some city gossip,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Eva, scornfully.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Said by your father, daughter of Besso, who, though he lives in cities,\nis not a man who will say that almonds are pearls.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nEva controlled her countenance, though it was difficult to conceal her\nmortification as she perceived how well informed her grandfather was of\nall that passed under their roof, and of the resources of his prisoner.\nIt was necessary, after the last remark of the great Sheikh, to take\nnew ground, and, instead of dwelling, as she was about to do, on the\nexaggeration of public report, and attempting to ridicule the vast\nexpectations of her host, she said, in a soft tone, \u00e2\u0080\u0098You did not ask me\nwhy Besso was in such affliction, father of my mother?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098There are many sorrows: has he lost ships? If a man is in sound health,\nall the rest are dreams. And Besso needs no hakeem, or you would not be\nhere, my Rose of Sharon.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098The light may have become darkness in our eyes, though we may still eat\nand drink,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Eva. \u00e2\u0080\u0098And that has happened to Besso which might have\nturned a child\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hair grey in its cradle.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Who has poisoned his well? Has he quarrelled with the Porte?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said the\nSheikh, without looking at her.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098It is not his enemies who have pierced him in the back.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Humph,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said the great Sheikh.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098And that makes his heart more heavy,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Eva.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098He dwells too much in walls,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said the great Sheikh. \u00e2\u0080\u0098He should have\nridden into the desert, instead of you, my child. He should have brought\nthe ransom himself; \u00e2\u0080\u0098and the great Sheikh sent two curling streams out\nof his nostrils.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Whoever be the bearer, he is the payer,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Eva. \u00e2\u0080\u0098It is he who is the\nprisoner, not this son of Franguestan, who, you think, is your captive.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Your father wishes to scrape my piastres,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said the great Sheikh, in a\nstern voice, and looking his granddaughter full in the face.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098If he wanted to scrape piastres from the desert,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Eva, in a sweet\nbut mournful voice, \u00e2\u0080\u0098would Besso have given you the convoy of the Hadj\nwithout condition or abatement?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nThe great Sheikh drew a long breath from his chibouque. After a\nmomentary pause, he said, \u00e2\u0080\u0098In a family there should ever be unity and\nconcord; above all things, words should not be dark. How much will the\nQueen of the English give for her brother?\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098He is not the brother of the Queen of the English,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Eva.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Not when he is my spoil, in my tent,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Amalek, with a cunning\nsmile; \u00e2\u0080\u0098but put him on a round hat in a walled city, and then he is the\nbrother of the Queen of the English.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Whatever his rank, he is the charge of Besso, my father and your son,\u00e2\u0080\u0099\nsaid Eva; \u00e2\u0080\u0098and Besso has pledged his heart, his life, and his honour,\nthat this young prince shall not be hurt. For him he feels, for him\nhe speaks, for him he thinks. Is it to be told in the bazaars of\nFranguestan that his first office of devotion was to send this youth\ninto the desert to be spoiled by the father of his wife?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Why did my daughters marry men who live in cities?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 exclaimed the old\nSheikh.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Why did they marry men who made your peace with the Egyptian, when not\neven the desert could screen you? Why did they marry men who gained you\nthe convoy of the Hadj, and gave you the milk of ten thousand camels?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Truly, there is but one God in the desert and in the city,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said\nAmalek. \u00e2\u0080\u0098Now, tell me, Rose of Sharon, how many piastres have you\nbrought me?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098If you be in trouble, Besso will aid you as he has done; if you wish\nto buy camels, Besso will assist you as before; but if you expect ransom\nfor his charge, whom you ought to have placed on your best mare of\nNedgid, then I have not brought a para.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098It is clearly the end of the world,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Amalek, with a savage sigh.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Why I am here,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Eva, \u00e2\u0080\u0098I am only the child of your child, a woman\nwithout spears; why do you not seize me and send to Besso? He must\nransom me, for I am the only offspring of his loins. Ask for four\nmillions of piastres I He can raise them. Let him send round to all the\ncities of Syria, and tell his brethren that a Bedouin Sheikh has made\nhis daughter and her maidens captive, and, trust me, the treasure will\nbe forthcoming. He need not say it is one on whom he has lavished a\nthousand favours, whose visage was darker than the simoom when he made\nthe great Pasha smile on him; who, however he may talk of living in\ncities now, could come cringing to El Sham to ask for the contract\nof the Hadj, by which he had gained ten thousand camels; he need say\nnothing of all this, and, least of all, need he say that the spoiler is\nhis father!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098What is this Prince of Franguestan to thee and thine?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Amalek.\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098He comes to our land like his brethren, to see the sun and seek for\ntreasure in our ruins, and he bears, like all of them, some written\nwords to your father, saying, \u00e2\u0080\u009cGive to this man what he asks, and we\nwill give to your people what they ask.\u00e2\u0080\u009d I understand all this: they all\ncome to your father because he deals in money, and is the only man in\nSyria who has money. What he pays, he is again paid. Is it not so, Eva?\nDaughter of my blood, let there not be strife between us; give me a\nmillion piastres, and a hundred camels to the widow of Sheikh Salem, and\ntake the brother of the Queen.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Camels shall be given to the widow of Sheikh Salem,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Eva, in a\nconciliatory voice; \u00e2\u0080\u0098but for this ransom of which you speak, my father,\nit is not a question as to the number of piastres. If you want a million\nof piastres, shall it be said that Besso would not lend, perhaps give,\nthem to the great Sheikh he loves? But, you see, my father of fathers,\npiastres and this Frank stranger are not of the same leaven. Name them\nnot together, I pray you; mix not their waters. It concerns the honour,\nand welfare, and safety, and glory of Besso that you should cover this\nyouth with a robe of power, and place him upon your best dromedary, and\nsend him back to El Khuds.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 The great Sheikh groaned.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Have I opened a gate that I am unable to close?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he at length said.\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098What is begun shall be finished. Have the children of Rechab been\nbrought from the sweet wells of Costal to this wilderness ever accursed\nto fill their purses with stones? Will they not return and say that my\nbeard is too white? Yet do I wish that this day was finished. Name then\nat once, my daughter, the piastres that you will give; for the prince,\nthe brother of queens, may to-morrow be dust.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 \u00e2\u0080\u0098How so?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 eagerly\ninquired Eva. \u00e2\u0080\u0098He is a Mejnoun,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 replied Amalek. \u00e2\u0080\u0098After the man named\nBaroni departed for El Khuds, the Prince of Franguestan would not\nrest until he visited Gibel Mousa, and I said \u00e2\u0080\u009cYes\u00e2\u0080\u009d to all his wishes.\nWhether it were his wound inflamed by his journey, or grief at his\ncaptivity, for these Franks are the slaves of useless sorrow, he\nreturned as wild as Kais, and now lies in his tent, fancying he is still\non Mount Sinai. \u00e2\u0080\u0098Tis the fifth day of the fever, and Shedad, the son of\nAmroo, tells me that the sixth will be fatal unless we can give him the\ngall of a phoenix, and such a bird is not to be found in this part of\nArabia.\n\nNow, you are a great hakeem, my child of children; go then to the young\nprince, and see what can be done: for if he die, we can scarcely ransom\nhim, and I shall lose the piastres, and your father the backsheesh which\nI meant to have given him on the transaction.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098This is very woful,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 murmured Eva to herself, and not listening to the\nlatter observations of her grandfather.\n\nAt this moment the curtain of the pavilion was withdrawn, and there\nstood before them Fakredeen. The moment his eyes met those of Eva, he\ncovered his face with both his hands.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098How is the Prince of Franguestan?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 inquired Amalek.\n\nThe young Emir advanced, and threw himself at the feet of Eva. \u00e2\u0080\u0098We\nmust entreat the Rose of Sharon to visit him,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he said, \u00e2\u0080\u0098for there is\nno hakeem in Arabia equal to her. Yes, I came to welcome you, and to\nentreat you to do this kind office for the most gifted and the most\ninteresting of beings;\u00e2\u0080\u0099 and he looked up in her face with a supplicating\nglance.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098And you too, are you fearful,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Eva, in atone of tender reproach,\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098that by his death you may lose your portion of the spoil?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nThe Emir gave a deprecating glance of anguish, and then, bending his\nhead, pressed his lips to the Bedouin robes which she wore. \u00e2\u0080\u0098\u00e2\u0080\u0099Tis the\nmost unfortunate of coincidences, but believe me, dearest of friends,\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098tis only a coincidence. I am here merely by accident; I was hunting, I\nwas----\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098You will make me doubt your intelligence as well as your good faith,\u00e2\u0080\u0099\nsaid Eva, \u00e2\u0080\u0098if you persist in such assurances.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Ah! if you but knew him,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 exclaimed Fakredeen, \u00e2\u0080\u0098you would believe me\nwhen I tell you that I am ready to sacrifice even my life for his. Far\nfrom sharing the spoil,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he added, in a rapid and earnest whisper, \u00e2\u0080\u0098I\nhad already proposed, and could have insured, his escape; when he\nwent to Sinai, to that unfortunate Sinai. I had two dromedaries here,\nthoroughbred; we might have reached Hebron before----\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098You went with him to Sinai?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098He would not suffer it; he desired, he said, to be silent and to be\nalone. One of the Bedouins, who accompanied him, told me that they\nhalted in the valley, and that he went up alone into the mountain, where\nhe remained a day and night. When he returned hither, I perceived a\ngreat change in him. His words were quick, his eye glittered like fire;\nhe told me that he had seen an angel, and in the morning he was as he\nis now. I have wept, I have prayed for him in the prayers of every\nreligion, I have bathed his temples with liban, and hung his tent with\ncharms. O Rose of Sharon! Eva, beloved, darling Eva, I have faith in no\none but in you. See him, I beseech you, see him! If you but knew him,\nif you had but listened to his voice, and felt the greatness of his\nthoughts and spirit, it would not need that I should make this entreaty.\nBut, alas! you know him not; you have never listened to him; you have\nnever seen him; or neither he, nor I, nor any of us, would have been\nhere, and have been thus.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXV.\n\n     _The New Crusader in Peril_\n\nNOTWITHSTANDING all the prescient care of the Duke and Duchess of\nBellamont, it was destined that the stout arm of Colonel Brace should\nnot wave by the side of their son when he was first attacked by the\nenemy, and now that he was afflicted by a most severe if not fatal\nillness, the practised skill of the Doctor Roby was also absent. Fresh\nexemplification of what all of us so frequently experience, that the\nmost sagacious and matured arrangements are of little avail; that no\none is present when he is wanted, and that nothing occurs as it was\nforeseen. Nor should we forget that the principal cause of all these\nmischances might perhaps be recognised in the inefficiency of the third\nperson whom the parents of Tancred had, with so much solicitude and at\nso great an expense, secured to him as a companion and counsellor in his\ntravels. It cannot be denied that if the theological attainments of\nthe Rev. Mr. Bernard had been of a more profound and comprehensive\ncharacter, it is possible that Lord Montacute might have deemed it\nnecessary to embark upon this new crusade, and ultimately to find\nhimself in the deserts of Mount Sinai. However this may be, one thing\nwas certain, that Tancred had been wounded without a single sabre of\nthe Bellamont yeomanry being brandished in his defence; was now lying\ndangerously ill in an Arabian tent, without the slightest medical\nassistance; and perhaps was destined to quit this world, not only\nwithout the consolation of a priest of his holy Church, but surrounded\nby heretics and infidels.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098We have never let any of the savages come near my lord,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Freeman\nto Baroni, on his, return.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Except the fair young gentleman,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 added True-man, \u00e2\u0080\u0098and he is a\nChristian, or as good.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098He is a prince,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Freeman, reproachfully. \u00e2\u0080\u0098Have I not told you so\ntwenty times? He is what they call in this country a Hameer, and lives\nin a castle, where he wanted my lord to visit him. I only wish he had\ngone with my lord to Mount Siny; I think it would have come to more\ngood.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098He has been very attentive to my lord all the time,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Trueman;\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098indeed, he has never quitted my lord night or day; and only left his\nside when we heard the caravan had returned.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I have seen him,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Baroni; \u00e2\u0080\u0098and now let us enter the tent.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nUpon the divan, his head supported by many cushions, clad in a Syrian\nrobe of the young Emir, and partly covered with a Bedouin cloak,\nlay Tancred, deadly pale, his eyes open and fixed, and apparently\nunconscious of their presence. He was lying on his back, gazing on the\nroof of the tent, and was motionless. Fakredeen had raised his wounded\narm, which had fallen from the couch, and had supported it with a pile\nmade of cloaks and pillows. The countenance of Tancred was much changed\nsince Baroni last beheld him; it was greatly attenuated, but the eyes\nglittered with an unearthly fire.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098We don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think he has ever slept,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Freeman, in a whisper.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098He did nothing but talk to himself the first two days,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Trueman;\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098but yesterday he has been more quiet.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nBaroni advanced to the divan behind the head of Tancred, so that he\nmight not be observed, and then, letting himself fall noiselessly on the\ncarpet, he touched with a light finger the pulse of Lord Montacute.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098There is not too much blood here,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he said, shaking his head.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098You don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think it is hopeless?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Freeman, beginning to blubber.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098And all the great doings of my lord\u00e2\u0080\u0099s coming of age to end in this!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\nsaid Trueman. \u00e2\u0080\u0098They sat down only two less than a hundred at the\nsteward\u00e2\u0080\u0099s table for more than a week!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nBaroni made a sign to them to leave the tent. \u00e2\u0080\u0098God of my fathers!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he\nsaid, still seated on the ground, his arms folded, and watching Tancred\nearnestly with his bright black eyes; \u00e2\u0080\u0098this is a bad business. This is\ndeath or madness, perhaps both. What will M. de Sidonia say? He loves\nnot men who fail. All will be visited on me. I shall be shelved. In\nEurope they would bleed him, and they would kill him; here they will not\nbleed him, and he may die. Such is medicine, and such is life! Now, if I\nonly had as much opium as would fill the pipe of a mandarin, that would\nbe something. God of my fathers! this is a bad business.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nHe rose softly; he approached nearer to Tancred, and examined his\ncountenance more closely; there was a slight foam upon the lip, which he\ngently wiped away.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098The brain has worked too much,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Baroni to himself. \u00e2\u0080\u0098Often have I\nwatched him pacing the deck during our voyage; never have I witnessed\nan abstraction so prolonged and so profound. He thinks as much as M.\nde Sidonia, and feels more. There is his weakness. The strength of my\nmaster is his superiority to all sentiment. No affections and a great\nbrain; these are the men to command the world. No affections and a\nlittle brain; such is the stuff of which they make petty villains. And a\ngreat brain and a great heart, what do they make? Ah! I do not know.\nThe last, perhaps, wears off with time; and yet I wish I could save this\nyouth, for he ever attracts me to him.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nThus he remained for some time seated on the carpet by the side of the\ndivan, revolving in his mind every possible expedient that might benefit\nTancred, and finally being convinced that none was in his power. What\nroused him from his watchful reverie was a voice that called his name\nvery softly, and, looking round, he beheld the Emir Fakredeen on tiptoe,\nwith his finger on his mouth. Baroni rose, and Fakredeen inviting him\nwith a gesture to leave the tent, he found without the lady of the\ncaravan.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I want the Rose of Sharon to see your lord,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said the young Emir, very\nanxiously, \u00e2\u0080\u0098for she is a great hakeem among our people.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Perhaps in the desert, where there is none to be useful, I might not be\nuseless,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Eva, with some reluctance and reserve.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Hope has only one arrow left,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Baroni, mournfully.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Is it indeed so bad?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Oh! save him, Eva, save him!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 exclaimed Fakredeen, distractedly.\n\nShe placed her finger on her lip.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Or I shall die,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 continued Fakredeen; \u00e2\u0080\u0098nor indeed have I any wish to\nlive, if he depart from us.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nEva conversed apart for a few minutes with Baroni, in a low voice, and\nthen drawing aside the curtain of the tent, they entered.\n\nThere was no change in the appearance of Tancred, but as they approached\nhim he spoke. Baroni dropped into his former position, Fakredeen fell\nupon his knees, Eva alone was visible when the eyes of Tancred met hers.\nHis vision was not unconscious of her presence; he stared at her with\nintentness. The change in her dress, however, would, in all probability,\nhave prevented his recognising her even under indifferent circumstances.\nShe was habited as a Bedouin girl; a leathern girdle encircled her\nblue robe, a few gold coins were braided in her hair, and her head was\ncovered with a fringed kefia.\n\nWhatever was the impression made upon Tancred by this unusual\napparition, it appeared to be only transient. His glance withdrawn, his\nvoice again broke into incoherent but violent exclamations. Suddenly he\nsaid, with more moderation, but with firmness and distinctness, \u00e2\u0080\u0098I am\nguarded by angels.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nFakredeen shot a glance at Eva and Baroni, as if to remind them of the\ntenor of the discourse for which he had prepared them.\n\nAfter a pause he became somewhat violent, and seemed as if he would have\nwaved his wounded arm; but Baroni, whose eye, though himself unobserved,\nnever quitted his charge, laid his finger upon the arm, and Tancred did\nnot struggle. Again he spoke of angels, but in a milder and mournful\ntone.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Methinks you look like one,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 thought Eva, as she beheld his spiritual\ncountenance lit up by a superhuman fire.\n\nAfter a few minutes, she glanced at Baroni, to signify her wish to leave\nthe tent, and he rose and accompanied her. Fakredeen also rose, with\nstreaming eyes, and making the sign of the cross.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Forgive me,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he said to Eva, \u00e2\u0080\u0098but I cannot help it. Whenever I am in\naffliction I cannot help remembering that I am a Christian.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I wish you would remember it at all times,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Eva, \u00e2\u0080\u0098and then,\nperhaps, none of us need have been here;\u00e2\u0080\u0099 and then not waiting for his\nreply, she addressed herself to Baroni. \u00e2\u0080\u0098I agree with you,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 she said.\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098If we cannot give him sleep, he will soon sleep for ever.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Oh, give him sleep, Eva,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Fakredeen, wringing his hands; \u00e2\u0080\u0098you can\ndo anything.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I suppose,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Baroni, \u00e2\u0080\u0098it is hopeless to think of finding any opium\nhere.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Utterly,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Eva; \u00e2\u0080\u0098its practice is quite unknown among them.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Send for some from El Khuds,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Fakredeen. \u00e2\u0080\u0098Idle!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Baroni;\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098this is an affair of hours, not of days.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Oh, but I will go,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 exclaimed Fakredeen; \u00e2\u0080\u0098you do not know what I can do\non one of my dromedaries! I will----\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nEva placed her hand on his arm without looking at him, and then\ncontinued to address Baroni.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Through the pass I several times observed a small white and yellow\nflower in patches. I lost it as we advanced, and yet I should think\nit must have followed the stream. If it be, as I think, but I did not\nobserve it with much attention, the flower of the mountain arnica, I\nknow a preparation from that shrub which has a marvellous action on the\nnervous system.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I am sure it is the mountain arnica, and I am sure it will cure him,\u00e2\u0080\u0099\nsaid Fakredeen.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Time presses,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Eva to Baroni. \u00e2\u0080\u0098Call my I maidens to our aid; and\nfirst of all let us examine the borders of the stream.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nWhile his friends departed to exert themselves, Fakredeen remained\nbehind, and passed his time partly in watching Tancred, partly in\nweeping, and partly in calculating the amount of his debts. This\nlatter was a frequent, and to him inexhaustible, source of interest and\nexcitement. His creative brain was soon lost in reverie. He conjured up\nTancred restored to health, a devoted friendship between them, immense\nplans, not inferior achievements, and inexhaustible resources. Then,\nwhen he remembered that he was himself the cause of the peril of that\nprecious life on which all his future happiness and success were to\ndepend, he cursed himself. Involved as were the circumstances in which\nhe habitually found himself entangled, the present complication was\ncertainly not inferior to any of the perplexities which he had hitherto\nexperienced.\n\nHe was to become the bosom friend of a being whom he had successfully\nplotted to make a prisoner and plunder, and whose life was consequently\nendangered; he had to prevail on Amalek to relinquish the ransom which\nhad induced the great Sheikh to quit his Syrian pastures, and had cost\nthe lives of some of his most valuable followers; while, on the other\nhand, the new moon was rapidly approaching, when the young Emir had\nappointed to meet Scheriff Effendi at Gaza, to receive the arms and\nmunitions which were to raise him to empire, and for which he had\npurposed to pay by a portion of his share in the great plunder which\nhe had himself projected. His baffled brain whirled with wild and\nimpracticable combinations, till, at length, frightened and exhausted,\nhe called for his nargileh, and sought, as was his custom, serenity\nfrom its magic tube. In this wise more than three hours had elapsed,\nthe young Emir was himself again, and was calculating the average of the\nvarious rates of interest in every town in Syria, from Gaza to Aleppo,\nwhen Baroni returned, bearing in his hand an Egyptian vase.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098You have found the magic flowers?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 asked Fakredeen, eagerly.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098The flowers of arnica, noble Emir, of which the Lady Eva spoke. I wish\nthe potion had been made in the new moon; however, it has been blessed.\nTwo things alone now are wanting, that my lord should drink it, and that\nit should cure him.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nIt was not yet noon when Tancred quaffed the potion. He took it without\ndifficulty, though apparently unconscious of the act. As the sun reached\nits meridian height, Tancred sank into a profound slumber. Fakredeen\nrushed away to tell Eva, who had now retired into the innermost\napartments of the pavilion of Amalek; Baroni never quitted the tent of\nhis lord. The sun set; the same beautiful rosy tint suffused the tombs\nand temples of the city as on the evening of their first forced arrival:\nstill Tancred slept. The camels returned from the river, the lights\nbegan to sparkle in the circle of black tents: still Tancred slept. He\nslept during the day, and he slept during the twilight, and, when the\nnight came, still Tancred slept. The silver lamp, fed by the oil of the\npalm tree, threw its delicate white light over the couch on which he\nrested. Mute, but ever vigilant, Fakredeen and Baroni gazed on their\nfriend and master: still Tancred slept.\n\nIt seemed a night that would never end, and, when the first beam of the\nmorning came, the Emir and his companion mutually recognised on their\nrespective countenances an expression of distrust, even of terror. Still\nTancred slept; in the same posture and with the same expression, unmoved\nand pale. Was it, indeed, sleep? Baroni touched his wrist, but could\nfind no pulse; Fakredeen held his bright dagger over the mouth, yet its\nbrilliancy was not for a moment clouded. But he was not cold.\n\nThe brow of Baroni was knit with deep thought, and his searching eye\nfixed upon the recumbent form; Fakredeen, frightened, ran away to Eva.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I am frightened, because you are frightened,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Fakredeen, \u00e2\u0080\u0098whom\nnothing ever alarms. O Rose of Sharon! why are you so pale?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098It is a stain upon our tents if this youth be lost,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Eva in a low\nvoice, yet attempting to speak with calmness.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098But what is it on me!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 exclaimed Fakredeen, distractedly. \u00e2\u0080\u0098A stain! I\nshall be branded like Cain. No, I will never enter Damascus again, or\nany of the cities of the coast. I will give up all my castles to my\ncousin Francis El Kazin, on condition that he does not pay my creditors.\nI will retire to Mar Hanna. I will look upon man no more.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Be calm, my Fakredeen; there is yet hope; my responsibility at this\nmoment is surely not lighter than yours.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Ah! you did not know him, Eva!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 exclaimed Fakredeen, passionately; \u00e2\u0080\u0098you\nnever listened to him! He cannot be to you what he is to me. I loved\nhim!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nShe pressed her finger to her lips, for they had arrived at the tent of\nTancred. The young Emir, drying his streaming eyes, entered first, and\nthen came back and ushered in Eva. They stood together by the couch of\nTancred. The expression of distress, of suffering, of extreme tension,\nwhich had not marred, but which, at least, had mingled with the\nspiritual character of his countenance the previous day, had\ndisappeared. If it were death, it was at least beautiful. Softness and\nrepose suffused his features, and his brow looked as if it had been the\ntemple of an immortal spirit.\n\nEva gazed upon the form with a fond, deep melancholy; Fakredeen and\nBaroni exchanged glances. Suddenly Tancred moved, heaved a deep sigh,\nand opened his dark eyes. The unnatural fire which had yesterday lit\nthem up had fled. Calmly and thoughtfully he surveyed those around him,\nand then he said, \u00e2\u0080\u0098The Lady of Bethany!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVI.\n\n     _The Angel\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Message_\n\nBETWEEN the Egyptian and the Arabian deserts, formed by two gulfs of the\nErythraean Sea, is a peninsula of granite mountains. It seems as if an\nocean of lava, when its waves were literally running mountains high, had\nbeen suddenly commanded to stand still. These successive summits, with\ntheir peaks and pinnacles, enclose a series of valleys, in general stern\nand savage, yet some of which are not devoid of pastoral beauty. There\nmay be found brooks of silver brightness, and occasionally groves of\npalms and gardens of dates, while the neighbouring heights command\nsublime landscapes, the opposing mountains of Asia and Afric, and the\nblue bosom of two seas. On one of these elevations, more than five\nthousand feet above the ocean, is a convent; again, nearly three\nthousand feet above this convent, is a towering peak, and this is Mount\nSinai.\n\nOn the top of Mount Sinai are two ruins, a Christian church and a\nMahometan mosque. In this, the sublimest scene of Arabian glory, Israel\nand Ishmael alike raised their altars to the great God of Abraham.\n\nWhy are they in ruins? Is it that human structures are not to be endured\namid the awful temples of nature and revelation; and that the column and\nthe cupola crumble into nothingness in sight of the hallowed Horeb and\non the soil of the eternal Sinai?\n\nAscending the mountain, about half way between the convent and the\nutmost height of the towering peak, is a small plain surrounded by\nrocks. In its centre are a cypress tree and a fountain. This is the\ntraditional scene of the greatest event of time.\n\nTis night; a solitary pilgrim, long kneeling on the sacred soil, slowly\nraises his agitated glance to the starry vault of Araby, and, clasping\nhis hands in the anguish of devotion, thus prays:--\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098O Lord God of Israel, Creator of the Universe, ineffable Jehovah! a\nchild of Christendom, I come to thine ancient Arabian altars to pour\nforth the heart of tortured Europe. Why art thou silent? Why no longer\ndo the messages of thy renovating will descend on earth? Faith fades and\nduty dies. A profound melancholy has fallen on the spirit of man. The\npriest doubts, the monarch cannot rule, the multitude moans and toils,\nand calls in its frenzy upon unknown gods. If this transfigured mount\nmay not again behold Thee; if not again, upon thy sacred Syrian plains,\nDivinity may teach and solace men; if prophets may not rise again to\nherald hope; at least, of all the starry messengers that guard thy\nthrone, let one appear, to save thy creatures from a terrible despair!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n[Illustration: page2-157]\n\nA dimness suffused the stars of Arabia; the surrounding heights, that\nhad risen sharp and black in the clear purple air, blended in shadowy\nand fleeting masses, the huge branches of the cypress tree seemed to\nstir, and the kneeling pilgrim sank upon the earth senseless and in a\ntrance.\n\nAnd there appeared to him a form; a shape that should be human, but vast\nas the surrounding hills. Yet such was the symmetry of the vision that\nthe visionary felt his littleness rather than the colossal proportions\nof the apparition. It was the semblance of one who, though not young,\nwas still untouched by time; a countenance like an oriental night, dark\nyet lustrous, mystical yet clear. Thought, rather than melancholy,\nspoke from the pensive passion of his eyes, while on his lofty forehead\nglittered a star that threw a solemn radiance on the repose of his\nmajestic features.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Child of Christendom,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said the mighty form, as he seemed slowly to\nwave a sceptre fashioned like a palm tree, \u00e2\u0080\u0098I am the angel of Arabia,\nthe guardian spirit of that land which governs the world; for power is\nneither the sword nor the shield, for these pass away, but ideas, which\nare divine. The thoughts of all lands come from a higher source than\nman, but the intellect of Arabia comes from the Most High. Therefore\nit is that from this spot issue the principles which regulate the human\ndestiny.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098That Christendom which thou hast quitted, and over whose expiring\nattributes thou art a mourner, was a savage forest while the cedars of\nLebanon, for countless ages, had built the palaces of mighty kings.\nYet in that forest brooded infinite races that were to spread over the\nglobe, and give a new impulse to its ancient life. It was decreed that,\nwhen they burst from their wild woods, the Arabian principles should\nmeet them on the threshold of the old world to guide and to civilise\nthem. All had been prepared. The C\u00c3\u00a6sars had conquered the world to place\nthe Laws of Sinai on the throne of the Capitol, and a Galilean Arab\nadvanced and traced on the front of the rude conquerors of the Caesars\nthe subduing symbol of the last development of Arabian principles.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Yet again, and Europe is in the throes of a great birth. The multitudes\nagain are brooding; but they are not now in the forest; they are in the\ncities and in the fertile plains. Since the first sun of this century\nrose, the intellectual colony of Arabia, once called Christendom,\nhas been in a state of partial and blind revolt. Discontented, they\nattributed their suffering to the principles to which they owed\nall their happiness, and in receding from which they had become\nproportionately miserable. They have hankered after other gods than the\nGod of Sinai and of Calvary, and they have achieved only desolation.\nNow they despair. But the eternal principles that controlled barbarian\nvigour can alone cope with morbid civilisation. The equality of man\ncan only be accomplished by the sovereignty of God. The longing for\nfraternity can never be satisfied but under the sway of a common father.\nThe relations between Jehovah and his creatures can be neither too\nnumerous nor too near. In the increased distance between God and man\nhave grown up all those developments that have made life mournful.\nCease, then, to seek in a vain philosophy the solution of the social\nproblem that perplexes you. Announce the sublime and solacing doctrine\nof theocratic equality. Fear not, faint not, falter not. Obey the\nimpulse of thine own spirit, and find a ready instrument in every human\nbeing.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nA sound, as of thunder, roused Tancred from his trance. He looked around\nand above. There rose the mountains sharp and black in the clear purple\nair; there shone, with undimmed lustre, the Arabian stars; but the voice\nof the angel still lingered in his ear. He descended the mountain: at\nits base, near the convent, were his slumbering guards, some steeds, and\ncrouching camels.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVII.\n\n     _Fakredeen is Curious_\n\nTHE beautiful daughter of Besso, pensive and abstracted, played with her\nbeads in the pavilion of her grandfather. Two of her maidens, who had\nattended her, in a corner of this inner compartment, accompanied the\nwild murmur of their voices on a stringed instrument, which might in the\nold days have been a psaltery. They sang the loves of Antar and of Ibla,\nof Leila and of Mejnoun; the romance of the desert, tales of passion and\nof plunder, of the rescue of women and the capture of camels, of heroes\nwith a lion heart, and heroines brighter and softer than the moon.\n\nThe beautiful daughter of Besso, pensive and abstracted, played with her\nbeads in the pavilion of her grandfather. Why is the beautiful daughter\nof Besso pensive and abstracted? What thoughts are flitting over her\nmind, silent and soft, like the shadows of birds over the sunshiny\nearth?\n\nSomething that was neither silent nor soft disturbed the lady from\nher reverie; the voice of the great Sheikh, in a tone of altitude and\nharshness, with him most usual. He was in an adjacent apartment, vowing\nthat he would sooner eat the mother of some third person, who was\nattempting to influence him, than adopt the suggestion offered. Then\nthere were softer and more persuasive tones from his companion, but\nevidently ineffectual. Then the voices of both rose together in emulous\nclamour--one roaring like a bull, the other shrieking like some wild\nbird; one full of menace, and the other taunting and impertinent. All\nthis was followed by a dead silence, which continuing, Eva assumed that\nthe Sheikh and his companion had quitted his tent. While her mind was\nrecurring to those thoughts which occupied them previously to this\noutbreak, the voice of Fakredeen was heard outside her tent, saying,\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Rose of Sharon, let me come into the harem;\u00e2\u0080\u0099 and, scarcely waiting for\npermission, the young Emir, flushed and excited, entered, and almost\nbreathless threw himself on the divan.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Who says I am a coward?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he exclaimed, with a glance of devilish\nmockery. \u00e2\u0080\u0098I may run away sometimes, but what of that? I have got moral\ncourage, the only thing worth having since the invention of gunpowder.\nThe beast is not killed, but I have looked into the den; \u00e2\u0080\u0098tis something.\nCourage, my fragrant Rose, have faith in me at last. I may make an\nimbroglio sometimes, but, for getting out of a scrape, I would back\nmyself against any picaroon in the Levant; and that is saying a good\ndeal.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Another imbroglio?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Oh, no! the same; part of the great blunder. You must have heard us\nraging like a thousand Afrites. I never knew the great Sheikh so wild.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098And why?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098He should take a lesson from Mehemet Ali,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 continued the Emir. \u00e2\u0080\u0098Giving\nup Syria, after the conquest, was a much greater sacrifice than giving\nup plunder which he has not yet touched. And the great Pasha did it as\nquietly as if he were marching into Stamboul instead, which he might\nhave done if he had been an Arab instead of a Turk. Everything comes\nfrom Arabia, my dear Eva, at least everything that is worth anything. We\ntwo ought to thank our stars every day that we were born Arabs.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098And the great Sheikh still harps upon this ransom?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 inquired Eva.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098He does, and most unreasonably. For, after all, what do we ask him to\ngive up? a bagatelle.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Hardly that,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Eva; \u00e2\u0080\u0098two millions of piastres can scarcely be\ncalled a bagatelle.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098It is not two millions of piastres,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Fakre-deen; \u00e2\u0080\u0098there is your\nfallacy, \u00e2\u0080\u0098tis the same as your grandfather\u00e2\u0080\u0099s. In the first place, he\nwould have taken one million; then half belonged to me, which reduces\nhis share to five hundred thousand; then I meant to have borrowed his\nshare of him.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Borrowed his share!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Eva.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Of course I should have allowed him interest, good interest. What could\nthe great Sheikh want five hundred thousand piastres for? He has camels\nenough; he has so many horses that he wants to change some with me for\narms at this moment. Is he to dig a hole in the sand by a well-side\nto put his treasure in, like the treasure of Solomon; or to sew up\nhis bills of exchange in his turban? The thing is ridiculous, I never\ncontemplated, for a moment, that the great Sheikh should take any hard\npiastres out of circulation, to lock them up in the wilderness. It might\ndisturb the currency of all Syria, upset the exchanges, and very much\ninjure your family, Eva, of whose interests I am never unmindful. I\nmeant the great Sheikh to invest his capital; he might have made a good\nthing of it. I could have afforded to pay him thirty per cent, for his\nshare, and made as much by the transaction myself; for you see, as I am\npaying sixty per cent, at Beiroot, Tripoli, Latakia, and every accursed\ntown of the coast at this moment. The thing is clear; and I wish you\nwould only get your father to view it in the same light, and we might do\nimmense things! Think of this, my Rose of Sharon, dear, dear Eva, think\nof this; your father might make his fortune and mine too, if he would\nonly lend me money at thirty per cent.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098You frighten me always, Fakredeen, by these allusions to your affairs.\nCan it be possible that they are so very bad!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Good, Eva, you mean good. I should be incapable of anything, if it were\nnot for my debts. I am naturally so indolent, that if I did not remember\nin the morning that I was ruined, I should never be able to distinguish\nmyself.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098You never will distinguish yourself,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Eva; \u00e2\u0080\u0098you never can, with\nthese dreadful embarrassments.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Shall I not?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Fakredeen, triumphantly. \u00e2\u0080\u0098What are my debts to my\nresources? That is the point. You cannot judge of a man by only knowing\nwhat his debts are; you must be acquainted with his resources.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098But your estates are mortgaged, your crops sold, at least you tell me\nso,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Eva, mournfully.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Estates! crops! A man may have an idea worth twenty estates, a\nprinciple of action that will bring him in a greater harvest than all\nLebanon.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098A principle of action is indeed precious,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Eva; \u00e2\u0080\u0098but although you\ncertainly have ideas, and very ingenious ones, a principle of action is\nexactly the thing which I have always thought you wanted.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Well, I have got it at last,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Fakredeen; \u00e2\u0080\u0098everything comes if a\nman will only wait.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098And what is your principle of action?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Faith.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098In yourself? Surely in that respect you have not hitherto been\nsceptical?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098No; in Mount Sinai.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098In Mount Sinai!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098You may well be astonished; but so it is. The English prince has been\nto Mount Sinai, and he has seen an angel. What passed between them I\ndo not yet know; but one thing is certain, he is quite changed by the\ninterview. He is all for action: so far as I can form an opinion in the\npresent crude state of affairs, it is not at all impossible that he may\nput himself at the head of the Asian movement. If you have faith, there\nis nothing you may not do. One thing is quite settled, that he will\nnot at present return to Jerusalem, but, for change of air and other\nreasons, make a visit with me to Canobia.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098He seems to have great purpose in him,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Eva, with an air of some\nconstraint.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098By-the-bye,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Fakredeen, \u00e2\u0080\u0098how came you, Eva, never to tell me that\nyou were acquainted with him?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Acquainted with him?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Eva.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Yes; he recognised you immediately when he recovered himself, and he\nhas admitted to me since that he has seen you before, though I could not\nget much out of him about it. He will talk for ever about Arabia, faith,\nwar, and angels; but, if you touch on anything personal, I observe he\nis always very shy. He has not my fatal frankness. Did you know him at\nJerusalem?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I met him by hazard for a moment at Bethany. I neither asked then,\nnor did he impart to me, his name. How then could I tell you we were\nacquainted? or be aware that the stranger of my casual interview was\nthis young Englishman whom you have made a captive?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Hush!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Fakredeen, with an air of real or affected alarm. \u00e2\u0080\u0098He\nis going to be my guest at my principal castle. What do you mean by\ncaptive? You mean whom I have saved from captivity, or am about to save?\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Well, that would appear to be the real question to which you ought\nto address yourself at this moment,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Eva. \u00e2\u0080\u0098Were I you, I should\npostpone the great Asian movement until you had disembarrassed yourself\nfrom your present position, rather an equivocal one both for a patriot\nand a friend.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Oh! I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll manage the great Sheikh,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Fakredeen, carelessly. \u00e2\u0080\u0098There\nis too much plunder in the future for Amalek to quarrel with me. When\nhe scents the possibility of the Bedouin cavalry being poured into Syria\nand Asia Minor, we shall find him more manageable. The only thing now\nis to heal the present disappointment by extenuating circumstances. If\nI could screw up a few thousand piastres for backsheesh,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 and he looked\nEva in the face, \u00e2\u0080\u0098or could put anything in his way! What do you think,\nEva?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nEva shook her head.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098What an obstinate Jew dog he is!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Fakre-deen. \u00e2\u0080\u0098His rapacity is\nrevolting!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098An obstinate Jew dog!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 exclaimed Eva, rising, her eyes flashing, her\nnostrils dilating with contemptuous rage. The manner of Fakredeen had\nnot pleased her this morning. His temper, was very uncertain, and, when\ncrossed, he was deficient in delicacy. Indeed, he was too selfish,\nwith all his sensibility and refined breeding, to be ever sufficiently\nconsiderate of the feelings of others. He was piqued also that he had\nnot been informed of the previous acquaintance of Eva and Tancred. Her\nreason for not apprising him of their interview at Bethany, though not\neasily impugnable, was not as satisfactory to his understanding as to\nhis ear. Again, his mind and heart were so absorbed at this moment by\nthe image of Tancred, and he was so entirely under the influence of his\nown idealised conceptions of his new and latest friend, that, according\nto his custom, no other being could interest him. Although he was\nhimself the sole cause of all the difficult and annoying circumstances\nin which he found himself involved, the moment that his passions and his\ninterests alike required that Tancred should be free and uninjured,\nhe acted, and indeed felt, as if Amalek alone were responsible for the\ncapture and the detention of Lord Montacute.\n\nThe young Emir indeed was, at this moment, in one of those moods which\nhad often marred his popularity, but in which he had never indulged\ntowards Eva before. She had, throughout his life, been the commanding\ninfluence of his being. He adored and feared her, and knew that she\nloved, and rather despised him. But Eva had ceased to be the commanding\ninfluence over Fakredeen. At this moment Fakredeen would have sacrificed\nthe whole family of Besso to secure the devotion of Tancred; and the\ncoarse and rude exclamation to which he had given vent, indicated the\ncurrent of his feelings and the general tenor of his mind.\n\nEva knew him by heart. Her clear sagacious intellect, acting upon an\nindividual whom sympathy and circumstances had combined to make her\ncomprehend, analysed with marvellous facility his complicated motives,\nand in general successfully penetrated his sovereign design.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098An obstinate Jew dog!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 she exclaimed; \u00e2\u0080\u0098and who art thou, thou jackal of\nthis lion! who should dare to speak thus? Is it not enough that you have\ninvolved us all in unspeakable difficulty and possible disgrace, that we\nare to receive words of contumely from lips like yours? One would think\nthat you were the English Consul arrived here to make a representation\nin favour of his countryman, instead of being the individual who planned\nhis plunder, occasioned his captivity, and endangered his life! It is\na pity that this young noble is not acquainted with your claims to his\nconfidence.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nThe possibility that in a moment of irritation Eva might reveal his\nsecret, some rising remorse at what he had said, and the superstitious\nreverence with which he still clung to her, all acting upon Fakredeen at\nthe same time, he felt that he had gone too far, and thereupon he sprang\nfrom the divan, on which he had been insolently lolling, and threw\nhimself at the feet of his foster-sister, whimpering and kissing her\nslippers, and calling her, between his sobs, a thousand fond names.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I am a villain,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he said, \u00e2\u0080\u0098but you know it; you have always known it.\nFor God\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sake, stand by me now; \u00e2\u0080\u0098tis my only chance. You are the only\nbeing I love in the world, except your family. You know how I respect\nthem. Is not Besso my father? And the great Sheikh, I honour the great\nSheikh. He is one of my allies. Even this accursed business proves it.\nBesides, what do you mean, by words of contumely from my lips? Am I not\na Jew myself, or as good? Why should I insult them? I only wish we were\nin the Land\u00e2\u0080\u0099 of Promise, instead of this infernal wilderness.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Well, well, let us consult together,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Eva, \u00e2\u0080\u0098reproaches are\nbarren.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Ah! Eva,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Fakredeen, \u00e2\u0080\u0098I am not reproaching you; but if, the\nevening I was at Bethany, you had only told me that you had just parted\nwith this Englishman, all this would not have occurred.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098How do you know that I had then just parted with this Englishman?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said\nEva, colouring and confused.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Because I marked him on the road. I little thought then that he had\nbeen in your retreat. I took him for some Frank, looking after the tomb\nof Lazarus.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I found him in my garden,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Eva, not entirely at her ease, \u00e2\u0080\u0098and\nsent my attendants to him.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nFakredeen was walking up and down the tent, and seemed lost in thought.\nSuddenly he stopped and said, \u00e2\u0080\u0098I see it all; I have a combination that\nwill put all right.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Put all right?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098See, the day after to-morrow I have appointed to meet a friend of mine\nat Gaza, who has a caravan that wants convoy through the desert to the\nmountain. The Sheikh of Sheikhs shall have it. It will be as good as ten\nthousand piastres. That will be honey in his mouth. He will forget the\npast, and our English friend can return with you and me to El Khuds.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I shall not return to El Khuds,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Eva. \u00e2\u0080\u0098The great Sheikh will\nconvoy me to Damascus, where I shall remain till I go to Aleppo.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098May you never reach Aleppo!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Fakredeen, with a clouded\ncountenance, for Eva in fact alluded to her approaching marriage with\nher cousin.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098But after all,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 resumed Eva, wishing to change the current of his\nthoughts, \u00e2\u0080\u0098all these arrangements, so far as I am interested, depend\nupon the success of my mission to the great Sheikh. If he will not\nrelease my father\u00e2\u0080\u0099s charge, the spears of his people will never guard\nme again. And I see little prospect of my success; nor do I think ten\nthousand piastres, however honestly gained, will be more tempting than\nthe inclination to oblige our house.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Ten thousand piastres is not much,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Fakredeen. \u00e2\u0080\u0098I give it every\nthree months for interest to a little Copt at Beiroot, whose property\nI will confiscate the moment I have the government of the country in my\nhands. But then I only add my ten thousand piastres to the amount of my\ndebt. Ten thousand piastres in coin are a very different affair. They\nwill jingle in the great Sheikh\u00e2\u0080\u0099s purse. His people will think he has\ngot the treasure of Solomon. It will do; he will give them all a gold\nkaireen apiece, and they will braid them in their girls\u00e2\u0080\u0099 hair.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098It will scarcely buy camels for Sheikh Salem\u00e2\u0080\u0099s widow,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Eva.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I will manage that,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Fakredeen. \u00e2\u0080\u0098The great Sheikh has camels\nenough, and I will give him arms in exchange.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Arms at Canobia will not reach the stony wilderness.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098No; but I have got arms nearer at hand; that is, my friend, my friend\nwhom I am going to meet at Gaza, has some; enough, and to spare. By the\nHoly Sepulchre, I see it!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Fakredeen. \u00e2\u0080\u0098I tell you how I will manage\nthe whole business. The great Sheikh wants arms; well, I will give\nhim five hundred muskets for the ransom, and he shall have the convoy\nbesides. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll take it. I know him. He thinks now all is lost, and, when\nhe finds that he is to have a jingling purse and English muskets enough\nto conquer Tadmor, he will close.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098But how are we to get these arms?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Eva.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Why, Scheriff Effendi, to be sure. You know I am to meet him at Gaza\nthe day after to-morrow, and receive his five thousand muskets. Well,\nfive hundred for the great Sheikh will make them four thousand five\nhundred; no great difference.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Scheriff Effendi!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Eva, with some surprise. \u00e2\u0080\u0098I thought I had\nobtained three months\u00e2\u0080\u0099 indulgence for you with Scheriff Effendi.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Ah! yes--no,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Fakredeen, blushing. \u00e2\u0080\u0098The fact is, Eva, darling,\nbeloved Eva, it is no use telling any more lies. I only asked you to\nspeak to Scheriff Effendi to obtain time for me about payment to throw\nyou off the scent, as you so strongly disapproved of my buccaneering\nproject. But Scheriff Effendi is a camel. I was obliged to agree to meet\nhim at Gaza on the new moon, pay him his two hundred thousand piastres,\nand receive the cargo. Well, I turn circumstances to account. The great\nSheikh will convey the muskets to the mountains.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098But who is to pay for them?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 inquired Eva.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Why, if men want to head the Asian movement, they must have muskets,\u00e2\u0080\u0099\nsaid Fakredeen; \u00e2\u0080\u0098and, after all, as we are going to save the English\nprince two millions of piastres, I do not think he can object to paying\nScheriff Effendi for his goods; particularly as he will have the muskets\nfor his money.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVIII.\n\n     _Tancred\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Recovery_\n\nTANCRED rapidly recovered. On the second day after his recognition of\nEva, he had held that conversation with Fakredeen which had determined\nthe young Emir not to lose a moment in making the effort to induce\nAmalek to forego his ransom, the result of which he had communicated to\nEva on their subsequent interview. On the third day, Tancred rose\nfrom his couch, and would even have quitted the tent, had not Baroni\ndissuaded him. He was the more induced to do so, for on this day he\nmissed his amusing companion, the Emir. It appeared from the account of\nBaroni, that his highness had departed at dawn, on his dromedary, and\nwithout an attendant. According to Baroni, nothing was yet settled\neither as to the ransom or the release of Tancred. It seemed that the\ngreat Sheikh had been impatient to return to his chief encampment, and\nnothing but the illness of Tancred would probably have induced him to\nremain in the Stony Arabia as long as he had done. The Lady Eva had\nnot, since her arrival at the ruined city, encouraged Baroni in any\ncommunication on the subject which heretofore during their journey had\nentirely occupied her consideration, from which he inferred that she had\nnothing very satisfactory to relate; yet he was not without hope, as he\nfelt assured that Eva would not have remained a day were she convinced\nthat there was no chance of effecting her original purpose. The\ncomparative contentment of the great Sheikh at this moment, her silence,\nand the sudden departure of Fakredeen, induced Baroni to believe\nthat there was yet something on the cards, and, being of a sanguine\ndisposition, he sincerely encouraged his master, who, however, did not\nappear to be very desponding.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098The Emir told me yesterday that he was certain to arrange everything,\u00e2\u0080\u0099\nsaid Tancred, \u00e2\u0080\u0098without in any way compromising us. We cannot expect such\nan adventure to end like a day of hunting. Some camels must be given,\nand, perhaps, something else. I am sure the Emir will manage it all,\nespecially with the aid and counsel of that beauteous Lady of Bethany,\nin whose wisdom and goodness I have implicit faith.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I have more faith in her than in the Emir,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Baroni. \u00e2\u0080\u0098I never know\nwhat these Shehaabs are after. Now, he has not gone to El Khuds this\nmorning; of that I am sure.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I am under the greatest obligations to the Emir Fakredeen,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said\nTancred, \u00e2\u0080\u0098and independently of such circumstances, I very much like\nhim.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I know nothing against the noble Emir,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Baroni, \u00e2\u0080\u0098and I am sure\nhe has been extremely polite and attentive to your lordship; but still\nthose Shehaabs, they are such a set, always after something!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098He is ardent and ambitious,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Tancred, \u00e2\u0080\u0098and he is young. Are these\nfaults? Besides, he has not had the advantage of our stricter training.\nHe has been without guides; and is somewhat undisciplined, and\nself-formed. But he has a great and interesting position, and is\nbrilliant and energetic. Providence may have appointed him to fulfil\ngreat ends.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098A Shehaab will look after the main chance,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Baroni.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098But his main chance may be the salvation of his country,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Tancred.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Nothing can save his country,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Baroni. \u00e2\u0080\u0098The Syrians were ever\nslaves.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I do not call them slaves now,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Tancred; \u00e2\u0080\u0098why, they are armed and\nare warlike! All that they want is a cause.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098And that they never will have,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Baroni.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Why?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098The East is used up.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098It is not more used up than when Mahomet arose,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Tancred. \u00e2\u0080\u0098Weak\nand withering as may be the government of the Turks, it is not more\nfeeble and enervated than that of the Greek empire and the Chosroes.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know anything about them,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 replied Baroni; \u00e2\u0080\u0098but I know there is\nnothing to be done with the people here. I have seen something of them,\u00e2\u0080\u0099\nsaid Baroni. \u00e2\u0080\u0098M. de Sidonia tried to do something in \u00e2\u0080\u009839, and, if there\nhad been a spark of spirit or of sense in Syria, that was the time,\nbut----\u00e2\u0080\u0099 and here Baroni shrugged his shoulders.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098But what was your principle of action in \u00e2\u0080\u009839?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 inquired Tancred,\nevidently interested.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098The only principle of action in this world,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Baroni; \u00e2\u0080\u0098we had\nplenty of money; we might have had three millions.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098And if you had had six, or sixteen, your efforts would have been\nequally fruitless. I do not believe in national regeneration in the\nshape of a foreign loan. Look at Greece! And yet a man might climb\nMount Carmel, and utter three words which would bring the Arabs again to\nGrenada, and perhaps further.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098They have no artillery,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Baroni.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098And the Turks have artillery and cannot use it,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Lord Montacute.\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Why, the most favoured part of the globe at this moment is entirely\ndefenceless; there is not a soldier worth firing at in Asia except the\nSepoys. The Persian, Assyrian, and Babylonian monarchies might be gained\nin a morning with faith and the flourish of a sabre.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098You would have the Great Powers interfering,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Baroni.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098What should I care for the Great Powers, if the Lord of Hosts were on\nmy side!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Why, to be sure they could not do much at Bagdad or Ispahan.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Work out a great religious truth on the Persian and Mesopotamian\nplains, the most exuberant soils in the world with the scantiest\npopulation,--it would revivify Asia. It must spread. The peninsula of\nArabia, when in action, must always command the peninsula of the Lesser\nAsia. Asia revivified would act upon Europe. The European comfort, which\nthey call civilisation, is, after all, confined to a very small space:\nthe island of Great Britain, France, and the course of a single river,\nthe Rhine. The greater part of Europe is as dead as Asia, without the\nconsolation of climate and the influence of immortal traditions.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I just found time, my lord, when I was at Jerusalem, to call in at the\nConsulate, and see the Colonel,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Baroni; \u00e2\u0080\u0098I thought it as well to\nexplain the affair a little to him. I found that even the rumour of our\nmischance had not reached him; so I said enough to prevent any alarm\nwhen it arrived; he will believe that we furnished him with the priority\nof intelligence, and he expects your daily return.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098You did well to call; we know not what may happen. I doubt, however,\nwhether I shall return to Jerusalem. If affairs are pleasantly arranged\nhere, I think of visiting the Emir, at his castle of Canobia. A change\nof air must be the best thing for me, and Lebanon, by his account, is\ndelicious at this season. Indeed, I want air, and I must go out now,\nBaroni; I cannot stay in this close tent any longer; the sun has set,\nand there is no longer any fear of those fatal heats of which you are in\nsuch dread for me.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nIt was the first night of the new moon, and the white beams of the\nyoung crescent were just beginning to steal over the lately flushed\nand empurpled scene. The air was still glowing, and the evening breeze,\nwhich sometimes wandered through the ravines from the gulf of Akabah,\nhad not yet arrived. Tancred, shrouded in his Bedouin cloak, and\naccompanied by Baroni, visited the circle of black tents, which they\nfound almost empty, the whole band, with the exception of the scouts,\nwho are always on duty in an Arab encampment, being assembled in the\nruins of the amphitheatre, in whose arena, opposite to the pavilion of\nthe great Sheikh, a celebrated poet was reciting the visit of Antar to\nthe temple of the fire-worshippers, and the adventures of that greatest\nof Arabian heroes among the effeminate and astonished courtiers of the\ngenerous and magnificent Nushirvan.\n\nThe audience was not a scanty one, for this chosen detachment of the\nchildren of Rechab had been two hundred strong, and the great majority\nof them were now assembled; some seated as the ancient Idum\u00c3\u00a6ans, on the\nstill entire seats of the amphitheatre; most squatted in groups upon the\nground, though at a respectful distance from the poet; others standing\namid the crumbling pile and leaning against the tall dark fragments just\nbeginning to be silvered by the moonbeam; but in all their countenances,\ntheir quivering features, their flashing eyes, the mouth open with\nabsorbing suspense, were expressed a wild and vivid excitement, the heat\nof sympathy, and a ravishing delight.\n\nWhen Antar, in the tournament, overthrew the famous Greek knight, who\nhad travelled from Constantinople to beard the court of Persia; when he\ncaught in his hand the assassin spear of the Persian satrap, envious of\nhis Arabian chivalry, and returned it to his adversary\u00e2\u0080\u0099s heart; when he\nshouted from his saddle that he was the lover of Ibla and the horseman\nof the age, the audience exclaimed with rapturous earnestness, \u00e2\u0080\u0098It is\ntrue, it is true!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 although they were guaranteeing the assertions of a\nhero who lived, and loved, and fought more than fourteen hundred years\nbefore. Antar is the Iliad of the desert; the hero is the passion of the\nBedouins. They will listen for ever to his forays, when he raised\nthe triumphant cry of his tribe, \u00e2\u0080\u0098Oh! by Abs; oh! by Adnan,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 to the\nnarratives of the camels he captured, the men he slew, and the maidens\nto whose charms he was indifferent, for he was \u00e2\u0080\u0098ever the lover of Ibla.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\nWhat makes this great Arabian invention still more interesting is, that\nit was composed at a period antecedent to the Prophet; it describes the\ndesert before the Koran; and it teaches us how little the dwellers in it\nwere changed by the introduction and adoption of Islamism.\n\nAs Tancred and his companion reached the amphitheatre, a ringing laugh\nresounded.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Antar is dining with the King of Persia after his victory,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said\nBaroni; \u00e2\u0080\u0098this is a favourite scene with the Arabs. Antar asks the\ncourtiers the name of every dish, and whether the king dines so every\nday. He bares his arms, and chucks the food into his mouth without ever\nmoving his jaws. They have heard this all their lives, but always laugh\nat it with the same heartiness. Why, Shedad, son of Amroo,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 continued\nBaroni to an Arab near him, \u00e2\u0080\u0098you have listened to this ever since you\nfirst tasted liban, and it still pleases you!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I am never wearied with listening to fine language,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said the Bedouin;\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098perfumes are always sweet, though you may have smelt them a thousand\ntimes.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nExcept when there was some expression of feeling elicited by the\nperformance, a shout or a laugh, the silence was absolute. Not a whisper\ncould be heard; and it was in a muffled tone that Baroni intimated to\nTancred that the great Sheikh was present, and that, as this was his\nfirst appearance since his illness, he must pay his respects to Amalek.\nSo saying, and preceding Tancred, in order that he might announce his\narrival, Baroni approached the pavilion. The great Sheikh welcomed\nTancred with a benignant smile, motioned to him to sit upon his carpet;\nrejoiced that he was recovered; hoped that he should live a thousand\nyears; gave him his pipe, and then, turning again to the poet, was\ninstantly lost in the interest of his narrative. Baroni, standing as\nnear Tancred as the carpet would permit him, occasionally leant over and\ngave his lord an intimation of what was occurring.\n\nAfter a little while, the poet ceased. Then there was a general hum and\ngreat praise, and many men said to each other, \u00e2\u0080\u0098All this is true, for my\nfather told it to me before.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 The great Sheikh, who was highly pleased,\nordered his slaves to give the poet a cup of coffee, and, taking from\nhis own vest an immense purse, more than a foot in length, he extracted\nfrom it, after a vast deal of research, one of the smallest\nof conceivable coins, which the poet pressed to his lips, and,\nnotwithstanding the exiguity of the donation, declared that God was\ngreat.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098O Sheikh of Sheikhs,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said the poet, \u00e2\u0080\u0098what I have recited, though it is\nby the gift of God, is in fact written, and has been ever since the days\nof the giants; but I have also dipped my pen into my own brain, and\nnow I would recite a poem which I hope some day may be suspended in the\ntemple of Mecca. It is in honour of one who, were she to rise to our\nsight, would be as the full moon when it rises over the desert. Yes, I\nsing of Eva, the daughter of Amalek (the Bedouins always omitted Besso\nin her genealogy), Eva, the daughter of a thousand chiefs. May she never\nquit the tents of her race! May she always ride upon Nejid steeds and\ndromedaries, with harness of silver! May she live among us for ever! May\nshe show herself to the people like a free Arabian maiden!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098They are the thoughts of truth,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said the delighted Bedouins to one\nanother; \u00e2\u0080\u0098every word is a pearl.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nAnd the great Sheikh sent a slave to express his Wish that Eva and her\nmaidens should appear. So she came to listen to the ode which the poet\nhad composed in her honour. He had seen palm trees, but they were not as\ntall and graceful as Eva; he had beheld the eyes of doves and antelopes,\nbut they were not as bright and soft as hers; he had tasted the fresh\nsprings in the wilderness, but they were not more welcome than she; and\nthe soft splendour of the desert moon was not equal to her brow. She\nwas the daughter of Amalek, the daughter of a thousand chiefs. Might\nshe live for ever in their tents; ever ride on Nejid steeds and on\ndromedaries with silver harness; ever show herself to the people like a\nfree Arabian maiden!\n\nThe poet, after many variations on this theme, ceased amid great\nplaudits.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098He is a true poet,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said an Arab, who was, like most of his brethren, a\ncritic; \u00e2\u0080\u0098he is in truth a second Antar.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098If he had recited these verses before the King of Persia, he would have\ngiven him a thousand camels,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 replied his neighbour, gravely.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098They ought to be suspended in the temple of Mecca,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said a third.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098What I most admire is his image of the full moon; that cannot be-too\noften introduced,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said a fourth.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Truly the moon should ever shine,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said a fifth. \u00e2\u0080\u0098Also in all truly\nfine verses there should be palm trees and fresh springs.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nTancred, to whom Baroni had conveyed the meaning of the verses, was also\npleased; having observed that, on a previous occasion, the great Sheikh\nhad rewarded the bard, Tancred ventured to take a chain, which he\nfortunately chanced to wear, from, his neck, and sent it to the poet of\nEva. This made a great sensation, and highly delighted the Arabs.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Truly this is the brother of queens,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 they whispered to each other.\n\nNow the audience was breaking up and dispersing, and Tancred, rising,\nbegged permission of his host to approach Eva, who was seated at the\nentrance of the pavilion, somewhat withdrawn from them.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098If I were a poet,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Tancred, bending before her, \u00e2\u0080\u0098I would attempt\nto express my gratitude to the Lady of Bethany. I hope,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he added, after\na moment\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pause, \u00e2\u0080\u0098that Baroni laid my message at your feet. When I\nbegged your permission to thank you in person to-morrow, I had not\nimagined that I should have been so wilful as to quit the tent tonight.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098It will not harm you,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Eva; \u00e2\u0080\u0098our Arabian nights bear balm.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I feel it,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Tancred; \u00e2\u0080\u0098this evening will complete the cure you so\nbenignantly commenced.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Mine were slender knowledge and simple means,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Eva; \u00e2\u0080\u0098but I rejoice\nthat they were of use, more especially as I learn that we are all\ninterested in your pilgrimage.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098The Emir Fakredeen has spoken to you?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Tancred, inquiringly, and\nwith a countenance a little agitated.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098He has spoken to me of some things for which our previous conversation\nhad not entirely unprepared me.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Ah!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Tancred, musingly, \u00e2\u0080\u0098our previous conversation. It is not\nvery long ago since I slumbered by the side of your fountain, and yet it\nseems to me an age, an age of thought and events.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Yet even then your heart was turned towards our unhappy Asia,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said the\nLady of Bethany.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Unhappy Asia! Do you call it unhappy Asia! This land of divine deeds\nand divine thoughts! Its slumber is more vital than the waking life of\nthe rest of the globe, as the dream of genius is more precious than\nthe vigils of ordinary men. Unhappy Asia, do you call it? It is the\nunhappiness of Europe over which I mourn.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Europe, that has conquered Hindustan, protects Persia and Asia Minor,\naffects to have saved Syria,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Eva, with some bitterness. \u00e2\u0080\u0098Oh! what\ncan we do against Europe?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Save it,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Tancred.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098We cannot save ourselves; what means have we to save others?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098The same you have ever exercised, Divine Truth. Send forth a great\nthought, as you have done before, from Mount Sinai, from the villages of\nGalilee, from the deserts of Arabia, and you may again remodel all\ntheir institutions, change their principles of action, and breathe a new\nspirit into the whole scope of their existence.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I have sometimes dreamed such dreams,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 murmured Eva, looking down. \u00e2\u0080\u0098No,\nno,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 she exclaimed, raising her head, after a moment\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pause, \u00e2\u0080\u0098it is\nimpossible. Europe is too proud, with its new command over nature, to\nlisten even to prophets. Levelling mountains, riding without horses,\nsailing without winds, how can these men believe that there is any\npower, human or divine, superior to themselves?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098As for their command over nature,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Tancred, \u00e2\u0080\u0098let us see how it will\noperate in a second deluge. Command over nature! Why, the humblest root\nthat serves for the food of man has mysteriously withered throughout\nEurope, and they are already pale at the possible consequences. This\nslight eccentricity of that nature which they boast they can command has\nalready shaken empires, and may decide the fate of nations. No, gentle\nlady, Europe is not happy. Amid its false excitement, its bustling\ninvention, and its endless toil, a profound melancholy broods over its\nspirit and gnaws at its heart. In vain they baptise their tumult by the\nname of progress; the whisper of a demon is ever asking them, \u00e2\u0080\u009cProgress,\nfrom whence and to what?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Excepting those who still cling to your\nArabian creeds, Europe, that quarter of the globe to which God has never\nspoken, Europe is without consolation.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIX.\n\n     _Freedom_\n\nTHREE or four days had elapsed since the departure of Fakredeen, and\nduring each of them Tancred saw Eva; indeed, his hours were much passed\nin the pavilion of the great Sheikh, and, though he was never alone with\nthe daughter of Besso, the language which they spoke, unknown to those\nabout them, permitted them to confer without restraint on those subjects\nin which they were interested. Tancred opened his mind without reserve\nto Eva, for he liked to test the soundness of his conclusions by her\nclear intelligence. Her lofty spirit harmonised with his own high-toned\nsoul. He found both sympathy and inspiration in her heroic purposes. Her\npassionate love of her race, her deep faith in the destiny and genius\nof her Asian land, greatly interested him. To his present position she\nreferred occasionally, but with reluctance; it seemed as if she thought\nit unkind entirely to pass it over, yet that to be reminded of it\nwas not satisfactory. Of Fakredeen she spoke much and frequently. She\nexpressed with frankness, even with warmth, her natural and deep regard\nfor him, the interest she took in his career, and the high opinion she\nentertained of his powers; but she lamented his inventive restlessness,\nwhich often arrested action, and intimated how much he might profit\nby the counsels of a friend more distinguished for consistency and\nsternness of purpose.\n\nIn the midst of all this, Fakredeen returned. He came in the early\nmorning, and immediately repaired to the pavilion of the great Sheikh,\nwith whom he was long closeted. Baroni first brought the news to\nTancred, and subsequently told him that the quantity of nargilehs smoked\nby the young Emir indicated not only a prolonged, but a difficult,\ncontroversy. Some time after this, Tancred, lounging in front of his\ntent, and watching the shadows as they stole over the mountain tombs,\nobserved Fakredeen issue from the pavilion of Amalek. His flushed and\nradiant countenance would seem to indicate good news. As he recognised\nTancred, he saluted him in the Eastern fashion, hastily touching his\nheart, his lip, and his brow. When he had reached Tancred, Fakredeen\nthrew himself in his arms, and, embracing him, whispered in an agitated\nvoice on the breast of Lord Montacute, \u00e2\u0080\u0098Friend of my heart, you are\nfree!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nIn the meantime, Amalek announced to his tribe that at sunset the\nencampment would break up, and they would commence their return to the\nSyrian wilderness, through the regions eastward of the Dead Sea. The\nLady Eva would accompany them, and the children of Rechab were to have\nthe honour of escorting her and her attendants to the gates of Damascus.\nA detachment of five-and-twenty Beni-Rechab were to accompany Fakredeen\nand Tancred, Hassan and his Jellaheens, in a contrary direction of the\ndesert, until they arrived at Gaza, where they were to await further\norders from the young Emir.\n\nNo sooner was this intelligence circulated than the silence which had\npervaded the desert ruins at once ceased. Men came out of every tent and\ntomb. All was bustle and noise. They chattered, they sang, they talked\nto their horses, they apprised their camels of the intended expedition.\nThey declared that the camels had consented to go; they anticipated a\nprosperous journey; they speculated on what tribes they might encounter.\n\nIt required all the consciousness of great duties, all the inspiration\nof a great purpose, to sustain Tancred under this sudden separation\nfrom Eva. Much he regretted that it was not also his lot to traverse the\nSyrian wilderness, but it was not for him to interfere with arrangements\nwhich he could neither control nor comprehend. All that passed amid\nthe ruins of this desert city was as incoherent and restless as the\nincidents of a dream; yet not without the bright passages of strange\nfascination which form part of the mosaic of our slumbering reveries.\nAt dawn a prisoner, at noon a free man, yet still, from his position,\nunable to move without succour, and without guides; why he was captured,\nhow he was enfranchised, alike mysteries; Tancred yielded without a\nstruggle to the management of that individual who was clearly master\nof the situation. Fakredeen decided upon everything, and no one was\ninclined to impugn the decrees of him whose rule commenced by conferring\nfreedom.\n\nIt was only half an hour to sunset. The advanced guard of the children\nof Rechab, mounted on their dromedaries, and armed with lances, had\nsome hours ago quitted the ruins. The camels, laden with the tents and\nbaggage, attended by a large body of footmen with matchlocks, and who,\non occasion, could add their own weight to the burden of their charge,\nwere filing through the mountains; some horsemen were galloping about\nthe plain and throwing the jereed; a considerable body, most of them\ndismounted, but prepared for the seat, were collected by the river side;\nabout a dozen steeds of the purest race, one or two of them caparisoned,\nand a couple of dromedaries, were picketed before the pavilion of the\ngreat Sheikh, which was not yet struck, and about which some grooms were\nsquatted, drinking coffee, and every now and then turning to the horses,\nand addressing them in tones of the greatest affection and respect.\n\nSuddenly one of the grooms jumped up and said, \u00e2\u0080\u0098He comes;\u00e2\u0080\u0099 and then\ngoing up to a bright bay mare, whose dark prominent eye equalled in\nbrilliancy, and far exceeded in intelligence, the splendid orbs of\nthe antelope, he addressed her, and said, \u00e2\u0080\u0098O Diamond of Derayeh, the\nPrincess of the desert can alone ride on thee!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nThere came forth from his pavilion the great Amalek, accompanied by some\nof his Sheikhs; there came forth from the pavilion Eva, attended by her\ngigantic Nubian and her maidens; there came forth from the pavilion the\nEmir Fakredeen and Lord Mon-tacute.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098There is but one God,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said the great Sheikh as he pressed his hand to\nhis heart, and bade farewell to the Emir and his late prisoner. \u00e2\u0080\u0098May he\nguard over us all!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Truly there is but one God,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 echoed the attendant Sheikhs. \u00e2\u0080\u0098May you\nfind many springs!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nThe maidens were placed on their dromedaries; the grooms, as if by\nmagic, had already struck the pavilion of their Sheikh, and were stowing\nit away on the back of a camel; Eva, first imprinting on the neck of the\nmare a gentle embrace, vaulted into the seat of the Diamond of Derayeh,\nwhich she rode in the fashion of Zenobia. To Tancred, with her inspired\nbrow, her cheek slightly flushed, her undulating figure, her eye proud\nof its dominion over the beautiful animal which moved its head with\nhaughty satisfaction at its destiny, Eva seemed the impersonation of\nsome young classic hero going forth to conquer a world.\n\nStriving to throw into her countenance and the tones of her voice a\ncheerfulness which was really at this moment strange to them, she\nsaid, \u00e2\u0080\u0098Farewell, Fakredeen!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 and then, after a moment\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hesitation,\nand looking at Tancred with a faltering glance which yet made his heart\ntremble, she added, \u00e2\u0080\u0098Farewell, Pilgrim of Sinai.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XL.\n\n     _The Romantic Story of Baroni_\n\nTHE Emir of the Lebanon and his English friend did not depart from the\ndesert city until the morrow, Fakredeen being so wearied by his journey\nthat he required repose.\n\nUnsustained by his lively conversation, Tancred felt all the depression\nnatural to his position; and, restless and disquieted, wandered about\nthe valley in the moonlight, recalling the vanished images of the past.\nAfter some time, unable himself to sleep, and finding Baroni disinclined\nto slumber, he reminded his attendant of the promise he had once given\nat Jerusalem, to tell something of his history. Baroni was a lively\nnarrator, and, accompanied by his gestures, his speaking glance, and\nall the pantomime of his energetic and yet controlled demeanour, the\nnarrative, as he delivered it, would have been doubtless much more\namusing than the calmer form in which, upon reflection, we have thought\nfit to record some incidents which the reader must not in any degree\nsuppose to form merely an episode in this history. With this observation\nwe solicit attention to\n\n\n_The history of the Baroni family._\n\nBEING A CHAPTER IN THE LIFE OF SIDONIA.\n\nI.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I had no idea that you had a garrison here,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Sidonia, as the\ndistant sounds of martial music were wafted down a long, ancient\nstreet, that seemed narrower than it was from the great elevation of\nits fantastically-shaped houses, into the principal square in which was\nsituate his hotel. The town was one of the least frequented of Flanders;\nand Sidonia, who was then a youth, scarcely of twenty summers, was on\nhis rambling way to Frankfort, where he then resided.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098It is not the soldiers,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said the Flemish maiden in attendance, and who\nwas dressed in one of those pretty black silk jackets that seem to\nblend so well with the sombre yet picturesque dwellings of the Spanish\nNetherlands. \u00e2\u0080\u0098It is not the soldiers, sir; it is only the Baroni\nfamily.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098And who are the Baroni family?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098They are Italians, sir, and have been here this week past, giving some\nrepresentations.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Of what kind?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I hardly know, sir, only I have heard that they are very beautiful.\nThere is tumbling, I know for certain; and there was the Plagues of\nEgypt; but I believe it changes every night.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098And you have not yet seen them?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Oh no, sir, it is not for such as me; the second places are half a\nfranc!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098And what is your name?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Sidonia.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Th\u00c3\u00a9r\u00c3\u00a8se; at your service, sir.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098You shall go and see the Baroni family to-night, Th\u00c3\u00a9r\u00c3\u00a8se, if your\nmistress will let you.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I am sure she would if you would ask her, sir,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Th\u00c3\u00a9r\u00c3\u00a8se, looking\ndown and colouring with delight. The little jacket seemed very agitated.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Here they come!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Sidonia, looking out of the window on the great\nsquare.\n\nA man, extremely good-looking and well made, in the uniform of a marshal\nof France, his cocked hat fringed and plumed, and the colour of his coat\nalmost concealed by its embroidery, played a clarionet like a master;\nfour youths of a tender age, remarkable both for their beauty and their\ngrace, dressed in very handsome scarlet uniforms, with white scarfs,\nperformed upon French horns and similar instruments with great energy\nand apparent delight; behind them an honest Blouse, hired for the\noccasion, beat the double drum.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Two of them are girls,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Th\u00c3\u00a9r\u00c3\u00a8se; \u00e2\u0080\u0098and they are all the same\nfamily, except the drummer, who belongs, I hear, to Ypres. Sometimes\nthere are six of them, two little ones, who, I suppose, are left at home\nto-day; they look quite like little angels; the boy plays the triangle\nand his sister beats a tambourine.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098They are great artists,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 murmured Sidonia to himself, as he listened to\ntheir performance of one of Donizetti\u00e2\u0080\u0099s finest compositions. The father\nstood in the centre of the great square, the other musicians formed a\ncircle round him; they continued their performance for about ten minutes\nto a considerable audience, many of whom had followed them, while the\nrest had collected at their appearance. There was an inclination in the\ncurious multitude to press around the young performers, who would have\nbeen in a great degree hidden from general view by this discourteous\nmovement, and even the sound of their instruments in some measure\nsuppressed. Sidonia marked with interest the calm and commanding manner\nwith which, under these circumstances, the father controlled the people.\nThey yielded in an instant to his will: one tall blacksmith seemed\nscarcely to relish his somewhat imperious demeanour, and stood rooted to\nthe ground; but Baroni, placing only one hand on the curmudgeon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s brawny\nshoulder, while he still continued playing on his instrument with the\nother, whirled him away like a puppet. The multitude laughed, and the\ndisconcerted blacksmith slunk away.\n\nWhen the air was finished, Baroni took off his grand hat, and in a loud\nvoice addressed the assembled people, informing them that this evening,\nin the largest room of the Auberge of St. Nicholas, there would be a\nvariety of entertainments, consisting of masterpieces of strength and\nagility, dramatic recitations, dancing and singing, to conclude with the\nmystery of the Crucifixion of our blessed Lord and Saviour; in which all\nthe actors in that memorable event, among others the blessed Virgin,\nthe blessed St. Mary Magdalene, the Apostles, Pontius Pilate, the High\nPriest of the Jews, and many others, would appear, all to be represented\nby one family.\n\nThe speaker having covered himself, the band again formed and passed\nthe window of Sidonia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hotel, followed by a stream of idle amateurs,\nanimated by the martial strain, and attracted by the pleasure of hearing\nanother fine performance at the next quarter of the town, where the\nBaroni family might halt to announce the impending amusements of the\nevening.\n\nThe moon was beginning to glitter, when Sidonia threw his cloak around\nhim, and asked the way to the Auberge of St. Nicholas. It was a large,\nungainly, whitewashed house, at the extremity of a suburb where the\nstraggling street nearly ceased, and emptied itself into what in England\nwould have been called a green. The many windows flared with lights, the\ndoorway was filled with men smoking, and looking full of importance, as\nif, instead of being the usual loungers of the tavern, they were about\nto perform a principal part in the exhibition; they made way with\nrespectful and encouraging ceremony to any one who entered to form part\nof the audience, and rated with sharp words, and sometimes a ready cuff,\na mob of little boys who besieged the door, and implored every one who\nentered to give them tickets to see the Crucifixion. \u00e2\u0080\u0098It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the last\npiece,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 they perpetually exclaimed, \u00e2\u0080\u0098and we may come in for five sous a\nhead.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nSidonia mounted the staircase, and, being a suitor for a ticket for the\nprincipal seats, was received with a most gracious smile by a pretty\nwoman, fair-faced and arch, with a piquant nose and a laughing blue\neye, who sat at the door of the room. It was a long and rather narrow\napartment; at the end, a stage of rough planks, before a kind of\ncurtain, the whole rudely but not niggardly lighted. Unfortunately for\nthe Baroni family, Sidonia found himself the only first-class spectator.\nThere was a tolerable sprinkling of those who paid half a franc for\ntheir amusement. These were separated from the first row, which Sidonia\nalone was to occupy; in the extreme distance was a large space not\nfitted up with benches, where the miscellaneous multitude, who could\nsummon up five sous apiece later in the evening, to see the Crucifixion,\nwere to be stowed.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098It hardly pays the lights,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said the pretty woman at the door. \u00e2\u0080\u0098We have\nnot had good fortune in this town. It seems hard, when there is so much\nfor the money, and the children take such pains in going the rounds in\nthe morning.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098And you are Madame Baroni?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Sidonia.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Yes; I am the mother,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 she replied.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I should have thought you had been their sister,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Sidonia.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098My eldest son is fifteen! I often wish that he was anything else but\nwhat he is, but we do not like to separate. We are all one family, sir,\nand that makes us bear many things.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Well, I think I know a way to increase your audience,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Sidonia.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Indeed! I am sure it is very kind of you to say so much; we have not\nmet with a gentleman like you the whole time we have been here.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nSidonia descended the stairs; the smoking amateurs made way for him\nwith great parade, and pushed back with equal unkindness the young and\nwistful throng who still hovered round the portal.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you see the gentleman wants to go by? Get back, you boys!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nSidonia halted on the doorway, and, taking advantage of a momentary\npause, said, \u00e2\u0080\u0098All the little boys are to come in free.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nWhat a rush!\n\nThe performances commenced by the whole of the Baroni family appearing\nin a row, and bowing to the audience. The father was now dressed in\na Greek costume, which exhibited to perfection his compact frame: he\nlooked like the captain of a band of Palikari; on his left appeared the\nmother, who, having thrown off her cloak, seemed a sylph or a sultana,\nfor her bonnet had been succeeded by a turban. The three girls were\non her left hand, and on the right of her husband were their three\nbrothers. The eldest son, Francis, resembled his father, or rather was\nwhat his father must have been in all the freshness of boyhood; the\nsame form of blended strength and symmetry; the same dark eye, the same\ndetermined air and regular features which in time would become strongly\nmarked. The second boy, Alfred, about eleven, was delicate, fair, and\nfragile, like his mother; his sweet countenance, full of tenderness,\nchanged before the audience with a rapid emotion. The youngest son,\nMichel, was an infant of four years, and with his large blue eyes and\nlong golden hair, might have figured as one of the seraphs of Murillo.\n\nThere was analogy in the respective physical appearances of the brothers\nand the sisters. The eldest girl, Josephine, though she had only counted\ntwelve summers, was in stature, and almost in form, a woman. She was\nstrikingly handsome, very slender, and dark as night. Adelaide, in\ncolour, in look, in the grace of every gesture, and in the gushing\ntenderness of her wild, yet shrinking glance, seemed the twin of Alfred.\nThe little Carlotta, more than two years older than Michel, was the\nminiature of her mother, and had a piquant coquettish air, mixed with\nan expression of repose in one so young quite droll, like a little opera\ndancer. The father clapped his hands, and all, except himself, turned\nround, bowed to the audience, and retired, leaving Baroni and his two\nelder children. Then commenced a variety of feats of strength. Baroni\nstretched forth his right arm, and Josephine, with a bound, instantly\nsprang upon his shoulder; while she thus remained, balancing herself\nonly on her left leg, and looking like a flying Victory, her father\nstretched forth his left arm, and Francis sprang upon the shoulder\nopposite to his sister, and formed with her a group which might have\ncrowned a vase. Infinite were the postures into which, for more than\nhalf an hour, the brother and sister threw their flexible forms, and all\nalike distinguished for their agility, their grace, and their precision.\nAt length, all the children, with the exception of Carlotta, glided from\nbehind the curtain, and clustered around their father with a quickness\nwhich baffled observation. Alfred and Adelaide suddenly appeared,\nmounted upon Josephine and Francis, who had already resumed their former\npositions on the shoulders of their father, and stood immovable with\noutstretched arms, while their brother and sister balanced themselves\nabove. This being arranged, Baroni caught up the young Michel, and, as\nit were, flung him up on high; Josephine received the urchin, and tossed\nhim up to Adelaide, and in a moment the beautiful child was crowning the\nliving pyramid, his smiling face nearly touching the rough ceiling of\nthe chamber, and clapping his little hands with practised triumph, as\nBaroni walked about the stage with the breathing burden.\n\nHe stopped, and the children disappeared from his shoulders, like birds\nfrom a tree when they hear a sound. He clapped his hands, they turned\nround, bowed, and vanished.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098As this feat pleases you,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said the father, \u00e2\u0080\u0098and as we have a gentleman\nhere to-night who has proved himself a liberal patron of artists, I will\nshow you something that I rarely exhibit; I will hold the whole of\nthe Baroni family with my two hands;\u00e2\u0080\u0099 and hereupon addressing some\nstout-looking fellows among his audience, he begged them to come forward\nand hold each end of a plank that was leaning against the wall, one\nwhich had not been required for the quickly-constructed stage. This they\ndid with some diffidence, and with that air of constraint characteristic\nof those who have been summoned from a crowd to perform something which\nthey do not exactly comprehend.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Be not afraid, my good friends,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Baroni to them, as Francis\nlightly sprang on one end of the plank, and Josephine on the other; then\nAlfred and Adelaide skipped up together at equal distances; so that the\nfour children were now standing in attitude upon the same basis, which\nfour stout men endeavoured, with difficulty, to keep firm. At that\nmoment Madame Baroni, with the two young children, came from behind the\ncurtain, and vaulted exactly on the middle of the board, so that the\nbold Michel on the one side, and the demure Carlotta on the other,\ncompleted the group. \u00e2\u0080\u0098Thank you, my friends,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Baroni, slipping\nunder the plank, which was raised to a height which just admitted him to\npass under it, \u00e2\u0080\u0098I will release you,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 and with his outstretched hands he\nsustained the whole burthen, the whole of the Baroni family supported by\nthe father.\n\nAfter this there was a pause of a few minutes, the stage was cleared and\nBaroni, in a loose great-coat, appeared at its side with a violin. He\nplayed a few bars, then turning to the audience, said with the same\ncontemptuous expression, which always distinguished him when he\naddressed them, \u00e2\u0080\u0098Now you are going to hear a scene from a tragedy of the\ngreat Racine, one of the greatest tragedy writers that ever existed, if\nyou may never have heard him; but if you were at Paris, and went to the\ngreat theatre, you would find that what I am telling you is true.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 And\nJosephine advanced, warmly cheered by the spectators, who thought that\nthey were going to have some more tumbling. She advanced, however, as\nAndromache. It seemed to Sidonia that he had never listened to a voice\nmore rich and passionate, to an elocution more complete; he gazed with\nadmiration on her lightning glance and all the tumult of her noble brow.\nAs she finished, he applauded her with vehemence. He was standing near\nto her father leaning against the wall.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Your daughter is a great actress,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he said to Baroni.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I sometimes think so,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said the father, turning round with some\ncourtesy to Sidonia, whom he recognised as the liberal stranger who had\nso kindly increased his meagre audience; \u00e2\u0080\u0098I let her do this to please\nherself. She is a good girl, but very few of the respectable savages\nhere speak French. However, she likes it. Adelaide is now going to sing;\nthat will suit them better.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nThen there were a few more bars scraped on the violin, and Adelaide,\nglowing rather than blushing, with her eyes first on the ground and then\non the ceiling, but in all her movements ineffable grace, came forward\nand courtesied. She sang an air of Auber and of Bellini: a voice of the\nrarest quality, and, it seemed to Sidonia, promising almost illimitable\npower.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Your family is gifted,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he said to Baroni, as he applauded his second\ndaughter as warmly as the first; and the audience applauded her too.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I sometimes think so. They are all very good. I am afraid, however,\nthat this gift will not serve her much. The good-natured savages seem\npleased. Carlotta now is going to dance; that will suit them better. She\nhas had good instruction. Her mother was a dancer.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nAnd immediately, with her lip a little curling, a look of complete\nself-possession, willing to be admired, yet not caring to conceal her\ndisgust, the little Carlotta advanced, and, after pointing her toe,\nthrew a glance at her father to announce that he might begin. He played\nwith more care and energy than for the other sisters, for Carlotta was\nexceedingly wilful and imperious, and, if the music jarred, would often\nstop, shrug her shoulders, and refuse to proceed. Her mother doted\non her; even the austere Baroni, who ruled his children like a Pasha,\nthough he loved them, was a little afraid of Carlotta.\n\nThe boards were coarse and rough, some even not sufficiently tightened,\nbut it seemed to Sidonia, experienced as he was in the schools of Paris,\nLondon, and Milan, that he had never witnessed a more brilliant facility\nthan that now displayed by this little girl. Her soul, too, was entirely\nin her art; her countenance generally serious and full of thought,\nyet occasionally, when a fine passage had been successfully achieved,\nradiant with triumph and delight. She was cheered, and cheered,\nand cheered; but treated the applause, when she retired, with great\nindifference. Fortunately, Sidonia had a rose in his button-hole, and\nhe stepped forward and presented it to her. This gratified Carlotta, who\nbestowed on him a glance full of coquetry.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098And now,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Baroni, to the people, \u00e2\u0080\u0098you are going to see the\ncrucifixion of Jesus Christ: all the tableaux are taken from pictures\nby the most famous artists that ever lived, Raphael, Rubens, and others.\nProbably you never heard of them. I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t help that; it is not my fault;\nall I can say is, that if you go to the Vatican and other galleries,\nyou may see them. There will be a pause of ten minutes, for the children\nwant rest.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nNow there was a stir and a devouring of fruit; Baroni, who was on the\npoint of going behind the curtain, came forward, and there was silence\nagain to listen to him.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I understand,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he said, roughly, \u00e2\u0080\u0098there is a collection going to be\nmade for the children; mind, I ask no one to subscribe to it; no one\nobliges me by giving anything to it; it is for the children and the\nchildren alone, they have it to spend, that is all.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nThe collectors were Michel and Adelaide. Michel was always successful at\na collection. He was a great favourite, and wonderfully bold; he would\npush about in the throng like a Hercules, whenever anyone called out\nto him to fetch a Hard. Adelaide, who carried the box, was much too\nretiring, and did not like the business at all; but it was her turn,\nand she could not avoid it. No one gave them more than a sou. It is due,\nhowever, to the little boys who were admitted free, to state that they\ncontributed handsomely; indeed, they expended all the money they had\nin the exhibition room, either in purchasing fruit, or in bestowing\nbacksheesh on the performers.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098_Encore un liard pour Michel_,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 was called out by several of them, in\norder to make Michel rush back, which he did instantly at the exciting\nsound, ready to overwhelm the hugest men in his resistless course.\n\nAt last, Adelaide, holding the box in one hand and her brother by the\nother, came up to Sidonia, and cast her eyes upon the ground.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098For Michel,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Sidonia, dropping a five-franc piece into the box.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098A piece of a hundred sous!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Michel.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098And a piece of a hundred sous for yourself and each of your brothers\nand sisters, Adelaide,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Sidonia, giving her a purse.\n\nMichel gave a shout, but Adelaide blushed very much, kissed his hand,\nand skipped away. When she had got behind the curtain, she jumped on her\nfather\u00e2\u0080\u0099s neck, and burst into tears. Madame Baroni, not knowing what had\noccurred, and observing that Sidonia could command from his position a\nview of what was going on in their sanctuary, pulled the curtain, and\ndeprived Sidonia of a scene which interested him.\n\nAbout ten minutes after this, Baroni again appeared in his rough\ngreat-coat, and with his violin. He gave a scrape or two, and the\naudience became orderly. He played an air, and then turning to Sidonia,\nlooking at him with great scrutiny, he said, \u00e2\u0080\u0098Sir, you are a prince.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098On the contrary,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Sidonia, \u00e2\u0080\u0098I am nothing; I am only an artist like\nyourself.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Ah!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Baroni, \u00e2\u0080\u0098an artist like myself! I thought so. You have\ntaste. And what is your line? Some great theatre, I suppose, where\neven if one is ruined, one at least has the command of capital. \u00e2\u0080\u0098Tis a\nposition. I have none. But I have no rebels in my company, no traitors.\nWith one mind and heart we get on, and yet sometimes----\u00e2\u0080\u0099 and here a\nsignal near him reminded him that he must be playing another air, and in\na moment the curtain separated in the middle, and exhibited a circular\nstage on which there were various statues representing the sacred story.\n\nThere were none of the usual means and materials of illusion at hand;\nneither space, nor distance, nor cunning lights; it was a confined\ntavern room with some glaring tapers, and Sidonia himself was almost\nwithin arm\u00e2\u0080\u0099s reach of the performers. Yet a representation more\ncomplete, more finely conceived, and more perfectly executed, he had\nnever witnessed. It was impossible to credit that these marble forms,\nimpressed with ideal grace, so still, so sad, so sacred, could be the\nlittle tumblers, who, but half-an-hour before, were disporting on the\ncoarse boards at his side.\n\nThe father always described, before the curtain was withdrawn, with a\nsort of savage terseness, the subject of the impending scene. The groups\ndid not continue long; a pause of half a minute, and the circular stage\nrevolved, and the curtain again closed. This rapidity of representation\nwas necessary, lest delay should compromise the indispensable\nimmovable-ness of the performers.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Now,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Baroni, turning his head to the audience, and slightly\ntouching his violin, \u00e2\u0080\u0098Christ falls under the weight of the cross.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\nAnd immediately the curtain parted, and Sidonia beheld a group in the\nhighest style of art, and which though deprived of all the magic of\ncolour, almost expressed the passion of Correggio.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098It is Alfred,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Baroni, as Sidonia evinced his admiration. \u00e2\u0080\u0098He\nchiefly arranges all this, under my instructions. In drapery his talent\nis remarkable.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nAt length, after a series of representations, which were all worthy of\nbeing exhibited in the pavilions of princes, Baroni announced the last\nscene.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098What you are going to see now is the Descent from the Cross; it is\nafter Rubens, one of the greatest masters that ever lived, if you\never heard of such a person,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he added, in a grumbling voice, and then\nturning to Sidonia, he said, \u00e2\u0080\u0098This crucifixion is the only thing which\nthese savages seem at all to understand; but I should like you, sir,\nas you are an artist, to see the children in some Greek or Roman story:\nPygmalion, or the Death of Agrippina. I think you would be pleased.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I cannot be more pleased than I am now,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Sidonia. \u00e2\u0080\u0098I am also\nastonished.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nBut here Baroni was obliged to scrape his fiddle, for the curtain moved.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098It is a triumph of art,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Sidonia, as he beheld the immortal group\nof Rubens reproduced with a precision and an exquisite feeling which no\nlanguage can sufficiently convey, or too much extol.\n\nThe performances were over, the little artists were summoned to the\nfront scene to be applauded, the scanty audience were dispersing:\nSidonia lingered.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098You are living in this house, I suppose?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he said to Baroni.\n\nBaroni shook his head. \u00e2\u0080\u0098I can afford no roof except my own.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098And where is that?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098On four wheels, on the green here. We are vagabonds, and, I suppose,\nmust always be so; but, being one family, we can bear it. I wish the\nchildren to have a good supper to-night, in honour of your kindness. I\nhave a good deal to do. I must put these things in order,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 as he spoke\nhe was working; \u00e2\u0080\u0098there is the grandmother who lives with us; all this\ntime she is alone, guarded, however, by the dog. I should like them to\nhave meat to-night, if I can get it. Their mother cooks the supper.\nThen I have got to hear them say their prayers. All this takes time,\nparticularly as we have to rise early, and do many things before we make\nour first course through the city.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I will come and see you to-morrow,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Sidonia, \u00e2\u0080\u0098after your first\nprogress.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098An hour after noon, if you please,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Baroni. \u00e2\u0080\u0098It is pleasant for\nme to become acquainted with a fellow artist, and one so liberal as\nyourself.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Your name is Baroni,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Sidonia, looking at him earnestly.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098My name is Baroni.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098An Italian name.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Yes, I come from Cento.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Well, we shall meet to-morrow. Good night, Baroni. I am going, to send\nyou some wine for your supper, and take care the grandmamma drinks my\nhealth.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\nII.\n\nIt was a sunny morn: upon the green contiguous to the Auberge of St.\nNicholas was a house upon wheels, a sort of monster omnibus, its huge\nshafts idle on the ground, while three fat Flemish horses cropped the\nsurrounding pasture. From the door of the house were some temporary\nsteps, like an accommodation ladder, on which sat Baroni, dressed\nsomething like a Neapolitan fisherman, and mending his clarionet; the\nman in the blouse was eating his dinner, seated between the shafts, to\nwhich also was fastened the little dog, often the only garrison, except\nthe grandmother, of this strange establishment.\n\nThe little dog began barking vociferously, and Baroni, looking up,\ninstantly bade him be quiet. It was Sidonia whose appearance in the\ndistance had roused the precautionary voice.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Well,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Sidonia, \u00e2\u0080\u0098I heard your trumpets this morning.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098The grandmother sleeps,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Baroni, taking off his cap, and slightly\nrising. \u00e2\u0080\u0098The rest also are lying down after their dinner. Children will\nnever repose unless there are rules, and this with them is invariable.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098But your children surely cannot be averse to repose, for they require\nit.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Their blood is young,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 continued Baroni, still mending his clarionet;\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098they are naturally gay, except my eldest son. He is restless, but he is\nnot gay.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098He likes his art?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Not too much; what he wants is to travel, and, after all, though we are\nalways moving, the circle is limited.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Yes; you have many to move. And can this ark contain them all?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said\nSidonia, seating himself on some timber that was at hand.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098With convenience even,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 replied Baroni; \u00e2\u0080\u0098but everything can be effected\nby order and discipline. I rule and regulate my house like a ship. In a\nvessel, there is not as much accommodation for the size as in a house\nof this kind; yet nowhere is there more decency and cleanliness than on\nboard ship.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098You have an obedient crew,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Sidonia, \u00e2\u0080\u0098and that is much.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Yes; when they wake my children say their prayers, and then they come\nto embrace me and their mother. This they have never omitted during\ntheir lives. I have taught them from their birth to obey God and to\nhonour their parents. These two principles have made them a religious\nand moral family. They have kept us united, and sustained us under\nsevere trials.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Yet such talents as you all possess,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Sidonia, \u00e2\u0080\u0098should have\nexempted you from any very hard struggle, especially when united, as\napparently in your case, with well-ordered conduct.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098It would seem that they should,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Baroni, \u00e2\u0080\u0098but less talents than we\npossess would, probably, obtain as high a reward. The audiences that we\naddress have little feeling for art, and all these performances, which\nyou so much applauded last night, would not, perhaps, secure even the\nfeeble patronage we experience, if they were not preceded by some feats\nof agility or strength.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098You have never appealed to a higher class of audience?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098No; my father was a posture-master, as his father was before him. These\narts are traditionary in our family, and I care not to say for what\nlength of time and from what distant countries we believe them to have\nbeen received by us. My father died by a fall from a tight rope in the\nmidst of a grand illumination at Florence, and left me a youth. I count\nnow only sixty-and-thirty summers. I married, as soon as I could,\na dancer at Milan. We had no capital, but our united talents found\nsuccess. We loved our children; it was necessary to act with decision,\nor we should have been separated and trampled into the mud. Then I\ndevised this house and wandering life, and we exist in general as you\nsee us. In the winter, if our funds permit it, we reside in some city,\nwhere we educate our children in the arts which they pursue. The mother\ncan still dance, sings prettily, and has some knowledge of music. For\nmyself, I can play in some fashion upon every instrument, and have\nalmost taught them as much; I can paint, too, a scene, compose a\ngroup, and with the aid of my portfolio of prints, have picked up more\nknowledge of the costume, of different centuries than you would imagine.\nIf you see Josephine to-night in the Maid of Orleans you would perhaps\nbe surprised. A great judge, like yourself a real artist, once told me\nat Bruxelles, that the grand opera could not produce its equal.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I can credit it,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Sidonia, \u00e2\u0080\u0098for I perceive in Josephine, as well\nas indeed in all your children, a rare ability!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I will be frank,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Baroni, looking at Sidonia very earnestly, and\nlaying down his clarionet. \u00e2\u0080\u0098I conclude from what you said last night,\nand the interest that you take in the children, that you are something\nin our way, though on a great scale. I apprehend you are looking out for\nnovelties for the next season, and sometimes in the provinces things are\nto be found. If you will take us to London or Paris, I will consent to\nreceive no remuneration if the venture fail; all I shall then require\nwill be a decent maintenance, which you can calculate beforehand: if the\nspeculation answer, I will not demand more than a third of the profits,\nleaving it to your own liberality to make me any regalo in addition,\nthat you think proper.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098A very fair proposal,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Sidonia.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Is it a bargain?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I must think over it,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Sidonia.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Well; God prosper your thoughts, for, from what I see of you, you are a\nman I should be proud to work with.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Well, we may yet be comrades.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nThe children appeared at the door of the house, and, not to disturb\ntheir father, vaulted down. They saluted Sidonia with much respect, and\nthen withdrew to some distance. The mother appeared at the door,\nand, leaning down, whispered something to Baroni, who, after a little\nhesitation, said to Sidonia, \u00e2\u0080\u0098The grandmother is awake; she has a wish\nto thank you for your kindness to the children. It will not trouble\nyou; merely a word; but women have their fancies, and we like always to\ngratify her, because she is much alone and never complains.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098By all means,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Sidonia.\n\nWhereupon they ushered forward a venerable woman with a true Italian\nface; hair white as snow, and eyes still glittering with fire, with\nfeatures like a Roman bust, and an olive complexion. Sidonia addressed\nher in Italian, which greatly pleased her. She was profuse, even solemn,\nin her thanks to him; she added, she was sure, from all that she had\nheard of him, if he took the children with him, he would be kind to\nthem.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098She has overheard something I said to my wife,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Baroni, a little\nembarrassed.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I am sure I should be kind to them,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Sidonia, \u00e2\u0080\u0098for many reasons,\nand particularly for one;\u00e2\u0080\u0099 and he whispered something in Baroni\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ear.\n\nBaroni started from his seat with a glowing cheek, but Sidonia, looking\nat his watch and promising to attend their evening performance, bade\nthem adieu.\n\n\nIII.\n\nThe performances were more meagrely attended this evening than even on\nthe preceding one, but had they been conducted in the royal theatre of\na capital, they could not have been more elaborate, nor the troupe have\nexerted themselves with greater order and effect. It mattered not a jot\nto them whether their benches were thronged or vacant; the only audience\nfor whom the Baroni family cared was the foreign manager, young,\ngenerous, and speculative, whom they had evidently without intention\nalready pleased, and whose good opinion they resolved to-night entirely\nto secure. And in this they perfectly succeeded. Josephine was a tragic\nmuse; all of them, even to little Carlotta, performed as if their\ndestiny depended on the die. Baroni would not permit the children\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nbox to be carried round to-night, as he thought it an unfair tax on the\ngenerous stranger, whom he did not the less please by this well-bred\nabstinence. As for the mediaeval and historic groups, Sidonia could\nrecall nothing equal to them; and what surprised him most was the effect\nproduced by such miserable materials. It seemed that the whole was\neffected with some stiffened linen and paper; but the divine touch of\nart turned everything to gold. One statue of Henri IV. with his flowing\nplume, and his rich romantic dress, was quite striking. It was the very\nplume that had won at Ivry, and yet was nothing more than a sheet of\npaper cut and twisted by the plastic finger of little Alfred.\n\nThere was to be no performance on the morrow; the niggard patronage of\nthe town had been exhausted. Indeed, had it not been for Sidonia, the\nlittle domestic troupe would, ere this, have quitted the sullen town,\nwhere they had laboured so finely, and achieved such an ungracious\nreturn. On the morrow Baroni was to ride one of the fat horses over to\nBerg, a neighbouring town of some importance, where there was even a\nlittle theatre to be engaged, and if he obtained the permission of the\nmayor, and could make fair terms, he proposed to give there a series\nof representations. The mother was to stay at home and take care of the\ngrandmother; but the children, all the children, were to have a holiday,\nand to dine with Sidonia at his hotel.\n\nIt would have been quite impossible for the most respectable burgher,\neven of the grand place of a Flemish city, to have sent his children on\na visit in trim more neat, proper, and decorous, than that in which\nthe Baroni family figured on the morrow, when they went to pay their\nrespects to their patron. The girls were in clean white frocks with\nlittle black silk jackets, their hair beautifully tied and plaited, and\ntheir heads uncovered, according to the fashion of the country: not an\nornament or symptom of tawdry taste was visible; not even a necklace,\nalthough they necessarily passed their lives in fanciful or grotesque\nattire; the boys, in foraging caps all of the same fashion, were dressed\nin blouses of holland, with bands and buckles, their broad shirt collars\nthrown over their shoulders. It is astonishing, as Baroni said, what\norder and discipline will do; but how that wonderful house upon wheels\ncontrived to contain all these articles of dress, from the uniform of\nthe marshal of France to the diminutive blouse of little Michel, and how\ntheir wearers always managed to issue from it as if they came forth\nfrom the most commodious and amply-furnished mansion, was truly yet\npleasingly perplexing. Sidonia took them all in a large landau to see a\nfamous ch\u00c3\u00a2teau a few miles off, full of pictures and rich old furniture,\nand built in famous gardens. This excursion would have been delightful\nto them, if only from its novelty, but, as a substitute for their daily\nprogress through the town, it offered an additional gratification.\n\nThe behaviour of these children greatly interested and pleased Sidonia.\nTheir conduct to each other was invariably tender and affectionate:\ntheir carriage to him, though full of respect, never constrained, and\ntouched by an engaging simplicity. Above all, in whatever they did or\nsaid, there was grace. They did nothing awkwardly; their voices were\nmusical; they were merry without noise, and their hearts sparkled in\ntheir eyes.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I begin to suspect that these youthful vagabonds, struggling for life,\nhave received a perfect education,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 thought the ever-musing Sidonia, as\nhe leaned back in the landau, and watched the group that he had made\nso happy. \u00e2\u0080\u0098A sublime religious principle sustains their souls; a tender\nmorality regulates their lives; and with the heart and the spirit thus\ndeveloped, they are brought up in the pursuit and production of the\nbeautiful. It is the complete culture of philosophic dreams!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\nIV.\n\nThe children had never sat down before to a regular dinner, and they\ntold Sidonia 50. Their confession added a zest to the repast. He\ngave them occasional instructions, and they listened as if they were\nreceiving directions for a new performance. They were so quick and\nso tractable, that their progress was rapid; and at the second course\nJosephine was instructing Michel, and Alfred guiding the rather helpless\nbut always self-composed Carlotta. After dinner, while Sidonia helped\nthem to sugar-plums, he without effort extracted from each their master\nwish. Josephine desired to be an actress, while Adele confessed that,\nthough she sighed for the boards, her secret aspirations were for the\ngrand opera. Carlotta thought the world was made to dance.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098For my part,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Francis, the eldest son, \u00e2\u0080\u0098I have no wish to be idle;\nbut there are two things which I have always desired: first, that I\nshould travel; and, secondly, that nobody should ever know me.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098And what would Alfred wish to be?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Sidonia.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Indeed, sir, if it did not take me from my brothers and sisters, I\nshould certainly wish to be a painter.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Michel has not yet found out what he wishes,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Sidonia.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I wish to play upon the horn,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Michel, with great determination.\n\nWhen Sidonia embraced them before their departure, he gave each of the\ngirls a French shawl; to Francis he gave a pair of English pistols,\nto guard him when he travelled; Alfred received a portfolio full of\ndrawings of costume. It only arrived after dinner, for the town was too\npoor to supply anything good enough for the occasion, and Sidonia had\nsent a special messenger, the day before, for it to Lille. Michel was\nthe guardian of a basket laden with good things, which he was to have\nthe pleasure of dividing among the Baroni family. \u00e2\u0080\u0098And if your papa come\nback to-night,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Sidonia to Josephine, \u00e2\u0080\u0098tell him I should like to\nhave a word with him.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\nV.\n\nSidonia had already commenced that habit which, during subsequent years,\nhe has so constantly and successfully pursued, namely, of enlisting\nin his service all the rare talent which he found lying common and\nunappropriated in the great wilderness of the world, no matter if the\nobject to which it would apply might not immediately be in sight. The\nconjuncture would arrive when it would be wanted. Thus he generally\nhad ready the right person for the occasion; and, whatever might be the\ntransaction, the human instrument was rarely wanting. Independent of the\npower and advantage which this system gave him, his abstract interest in\nintellect made the pursuit delightful to him. He liked to give ability\nof all kinds its scope. Nothing was more apt to make him melancholy,\nthan to hear of persons of talents dying without having their chance.\nA failure is nothing; it may be deserved, or it may be remedied. In the\nfirst instance, it brings self-knowledge; in the second, it develops a\nnew combination usually triumphant. But incapacity, from not, having a\nchance of being capable, is a bitter lot, which Sidonia was ever ready\nto alleviate.\n\nThe elder Baroni possessed Herculean strength, activity almost as\nremarkable, a practised courage, and a controlling mind. He was in the\nprime of manhood, and spoke several languages. He was a man, according\nto Sidonia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s views, of high moral principle, entirely trustworthy. He\nwas too valuable an instrument to allow to run to seed as the strolling\nmanager of a caravan of tumblers; and it is not improbable that Sidonia\nwould have secured his services, even if he had not become acquainted\nwith the Baroni family. But they charmed him. In every member of it he\nrecognised character, and a predisposition which might even be genius.\nHe resolved that every one of them should have a chance.\n\nWhen therefore Baroni, wearied and a little disgusted with an\nunpromising journey, returned from Berg in the evening, and, in\nconsequence of the message of his children, repaired instantly to the\nhotel of Sidonia, his astonishment was great when he found the manager\nconverted into a millionaire, and that too the most celebrated in\nEurope. But no language can convey his wonder when he learnt the career\nthat was proposed to him, and the fortunes that were carved out for\nhis children. He himself was to repair, with all his family, except\nJosephine and her elder brother, at once to Vienna, where he was to be\ninstalled into a post of great responsibility and emolument. He was made\nsuperintendent of the couriers of the house of Sidonia in that capital,\nand especially of those that conveyed treasure. Though his duties would\nentail frequent absences on him, he was to be master of a constant and\ncomplete establishment. Alfred was immediately to become a pupil of the\nAcademy of Painters, and Carlotta of that of dancing; the talents of\nMichel were to be watched, and to be reported to Sidonia at fitting\nperiods. As for Adele, she was consigned to a lady who had once been\na celebrated prima donna, with whom she was to pursue her studies,\nalthough still residing under the paternal roof. \u00e2\u0080\u0098Josephine will repair\nto Paris at once with her brother,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Sidonia. \u00e2\u0080\u0098My family will guard\nover her. She will enjoy her brother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s society until I commence my\ntravels. He will then accompany me.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nIt is nearly twenty years since these incidents occurred, and perhaps\nthe reader may feel not altogether uninterested in the subsequent fate\nof the children of Baroni. Mademoiselle Josephine is at this moment\nthe glory of the French stage; without any question the most admirable\ntragic actress since Clairon, and inferior not even to her. The spirit\nof French tragedy has risen from the imperial couch on which it had\nlong slumbered since her appearance, at the same time classical and\nimpassioned, at once charmed and commanded the most refined audience\nin Europe. Adele, under the name of Madame Baroni, is the acknowledged\nQueen of Song in London, Paris, Berlin, and St. Petersburg; while her\nyounger sister, Carlotta Baroni, shares the triumphs, and equals the\nrenown, of a Taglioni and a Cerito. At this moment, Madame Baroni\nperforms to enthusiastic audiences in the first opera of her brother\nMichel, who promises to be the rival of Meyerbeer and Mendelssohn; all\ndelightful intelligence to meet the ear of the soft-hearted Alfred, who\nis painting the new chambers of the Papal palace, a Cavaliere, decorated\nwith many orders, and the restorer of the once famous Roman school.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Thus,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 continued Baroni to Tancred, \u00e2\u0080\u0098we have all succeeded in\nlife because we fell across a great philosopher, who studied our\npredisposition. As for myself, I told M. de Sidonia that I wished to\ntravel and to be unknown, and so he made of me a secret agent.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098There is something most interesting,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Tancred, \u00e2\u0080\u0098in this idea of\na single family issuing from obscurity, and disseminating their genius\nthrough the world, charming mankind with so many spells. How fortunate\nfor you all that Sidonia had so much feeling for genius!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098And some feeling for his race,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Baroni.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098How?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Tancred, startled.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098You remember he whispered something in my father\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ear?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I remember.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098He spoke it in Hebrew, and he was understood.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098You do not mean that you, too, are Jews?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Pure Sephardim, in nature and in name.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098But your name surely is Italian?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Good Arabic, my lord. Baroni; that is, the son of Aaron; the name of\nold clothesmen in London, and of caliphs at Bagdad.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLI.\n\n     _The Mountains of Lebanon_\n\nHOW do you like my forest?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 asked Fakredeen of Tancred, as, while\ndescending a range of the Lebanon, an extensive valley opened before\nthem, covered with oak trees, which clothed also, with their stout\ntrunks, their wide-spreading branches, and their rich starry foliage,\nthe opposite and undulating hills, one of which was crowned with a\nconvent. \u00e2\u0080\u0098It is the only oak forest in Syria. It will serve some day to\nbuild our fleet.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nAt Gaza, which they had reached by easy journeys, for Fakredeen was very\nconsiderate of the health of Tancred, whose wound had scarcely healed,\nand over whom he watched with a delicate solicitude which would have\nalmost become a woman, the companions met Scheriff Effendi. The magic\nsignature of Lord Montacute settled the long-vexed question of the\nfive thousand muskets, and secured also ten thousand piastres for the\ncommander of the escort to deliver to his chief. The children of Rechab,\nin convoy of the precious charge, certain cases of which were to be\ndelivered to the great Sheikh, and the rest to be deposited in indicated\nquarters of the Lebanon, here took leave of the Emir and his friend,\nand pursued their course to the north of Hebron and the Dead Sea, in the\ndirection of the Hauraan, where they counted, if not on overtaking\nthe great Sheikh, at least on the additional security which his\nneighbourhood would ensure them. Their late companions remained at Gaza,\nawaiting Tancred\u00e2\u0080\u0099s yacht, which Baroni fetched from the neighbouring\nJaffa. A favourable breeze soon carried them from Gaza to Beiroot,\nwhere they landed, and where Fakredeen had the political pleasure of\nexhibiting his new and powerful ally, a prince, an English prince,\nthe brother perhaps of a queen, unquestionably the owner of a splendid\nyacht, to the admiring eye of all his, at the same time, credulous and\nrapacious creditors.\n\nThe air of the mountains invigorated Tancred. His eyes had rested so\nlong on the ocean and the desert, that the effect produced on the nerves\nby the forms and colours of a more varied nature were alone reviving.\n\nThere are regions more lofty than the glaciered crests of Lebanon;\nmountain scenery more sublime, perhaps even more beautiful: its peaks\nare not lost in the clouds like the mysterious Ararat; its forests\nare not as vast and strange as the towering Himalaya; it has not the\nvolcanic splendour of the glowing Andes; in lake and in cataract it\nmust yield to the European Alps; but for life, vigorous, varied, and\npicturesque, there is no highland territory in the globe that can for a\nmoment compare with the great chain of Syria.\n\nMan has fled from the rich and servile plains, from the tyranny of the\nTurk and from Arabian rapine, to clothe the crag with vines, and rest\nunder his fig tree on the mountain top. An ingenious spirit, unwearied\nindustry, and a bland atmosphere have made a perpetual garden of the\nSyrian mountains. Their acclivities sparkle with terraces of corn and\nfruit. Castle and convent crown their nobler heights, and flat-roofed\nvillages nestle amid groves of mulberry trees. Among these mountains\nwe find several human races, several forms of government, and\nseveral schemes of religion, yet everywhere liberty: a proud, feudal\naristocracy; a conventual establishment, which in its ramifications\nrecalls the middle ages; a free and armed peasantry, whatever their\ncreed, Emirs on Arabian steeds, bishops worthy of the Apostles, the\nMaronite monk, the horned head-gear of the Druses.\n\nSome of those beautiful horses, for which Fakredeen was celebrated, had\nawaited the travellers at Beiroot. The journey through the mountain was\nto last three days before they reached Canobia. They halted one night at\na mountain village, where the young Emir was received with enthusiastic\ndevotion, and on the next at a small castle belonging to Fakredeen, and\nwhere resided one of his kinsmen. Two hours before sunset, on the third\nday, they were entering the oak forest to which we referred, and through\nwhose glades they journeyed for about half an hour. On arriving at the\nconvent-crowned height opposite, they beheld an expanse of country; a\nsmall plain amid the mountains; in many parts richly cultivated,\nstudded by several hamlets, and watered by a stream, winding amid rich\nshrubberies of oleander.\n\nAlmost in the middle of this plain, on a height superior to the\nimmediate elevations which bounded it, rose a mountain of gradual\nascent, covered with sycamores, and crowned by a superb Saracenic\ncastle.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Canobia!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Fakredeen to Tancred, \u00e2\u0080\u0098which I hope you never will\nquit.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098It would be difficult,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 rejoined Tancred, animated. \u00e2\u0080\u0098I have seldom seen\na sight more striking and more beautiful.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nIn the meantime, Freeman and Trueman, who were far in the rear amid\nFakredeen\u00e2\u0080\u0099s attendants, exchanged congratulating glances of blended\nsurprise and approbation.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098This is the first gentleman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s seat I have seen since we left England,\u00e2\u0080\u0099\nsaid Freeman.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098There must have been a fine coming of age here,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 rejoined Trueman.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098As for that,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 replied Freeman, \u00e2\u0080\u0098comings of age depend in a manner upon\nmeat and drink. They ain\u00e2\u0080\u0099t in noways to be carried out with coffee and\npipes. Without oxen roasted whole, and broached hogsheads, they ain\u00e2\u0080\u0099t in\na manner legal.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nA horseman, who was ahead of the Emir and Tancred, now began beating\nwith a stick on two small tabors, one on each side of his saddle, and\nthus announced to those who were already on the watch, the approach of\ntheir lord. It was some time, however, before the road, winding through\nthe sycamore trees and gradually ascending, brought them to the outworks\nof the castle, of which, during their progress, they enjoyed a variety\nof views. It was a very extensive pile, in excellent condition, and\napparently strongly fortified. A number of men, in showy dresses and\nwith ornamented arms, were clustered round the embattled gateway, which\nintroduced the travellers into a quadrangle of considerable size, and of\nwhich the light and airy style pleasingly and suitably contrasted with\nthe sterner and more massive character of the exterior walls. A fountain\nrose in the centre of the quadrangle which was surrounded by arcades.\nRanged round this fountain, in a circle, were twenty saddled steeds\nof the highest race, each held by a groom, and each attended by a\nman-at-arms. All pressed their hands to their hearts as the Emir\nentered, but with a gravity of countenance which was never for a\nmoment disturbed. Whether their presence were habitual, or only for\nthe occasion, it was unquestionably impressive. Here the travellers\ndismounted, and Fakredeen ushered Tancred through a variety of saloons,\nof which the furniture, though simple, as becomes the East, was\nluxurious, and, of its kind, superb; floors of mosaic marbles, bright\ncarpets, arabesque ceilings, walls of carved cedar, and broad divans of\nthe richest stuffs of Damascus.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098And this divan is for you,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Fakredeen, showing Tancred into a\nchamber, which opened upon a flower-garden shaded by lemon trees. \u00e2\u0080\u0098I\nam proud of my mirror,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he added, with some exultation, as he called\nTancred\u00e2\u0080\u0099s attention to a large French looking-glass, the only one in\nLebanon. \u00e2\u0080\u0098And this,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 added Fakredeen, leading Tancred through a suite of\nmarble chambers, \u00e2\u0080\u0098this is your bath.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nIn the centre of one chamber, fed by a perpetual fountain, was a large\nalabaster basin, the edges of which were strewn with flowers just\nculled. The chamber was entirely of porcelain; a golden flower on a\nground of delicate green.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I will send your people to you,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Fakredeen; \u00e2\u0080\u0098but, in the meantime,\nthere are attendants here who are, perhaps, more used to the duty;\u00e2\u0080\u0099 and,\nso saying, he clapped his hands, and several servants appeared, bearing\nbaskets of curious linen, whiter than the snow of Lebanon, and a variety\nof robes.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLII.\n\n     _Strange Ceremonies._\n\nIT HAS been long decreed that no poet may introduce the Phoenix. Scylla\nand Charybdis are both successfully avoided even by provincial rhetoric.\nThe performance of Hamlet with the part of Hamlet omitted, and Mahomet\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nunhappy coffin, these are illustrations that have long been the\nprerogative of dolts and dullards. It is not for a moment to be\ntolerated that an oasis should be met with anywhere except in the\ndesert.\n\nWe sadly lack a new stock of public images. The current similes, if\nnot absolutely counterfeit, are quite worn out. They have no intrinsic\nvalue, and serve only as counters to represent the absence of ideas.\nThe critics should really call them in. In the good old days, when the\nsuperscription was fresh, and the mint mark bright upon the metal, we\nshould have compared the friendship of two young men to that of Damon\nand Pythias. These were individuals then still well known in polite\nsociety. If their examples have ceased to influence, it cannot\nbe pretended that the extinction of their authority has been the\nconsequence of competition. Our enlightened age has not produced them\nany rivals.\n\nOf all the differences between the ancients and ourselves, none more\nstriking than our respective ideas of friendship. Grecian friendship\nwas indeed so ethereal, that it is difficult to define its essential\nqualities. They must be sought rather in the pages of Plato, or the\nmoral essays of Plutarch perhaps, and in some other books not quite\nas well known, but not less interesting and curious. As for modern\nfriendship, it will be found in clubs. It is violent at a house\ndinner, fervent in a cigar shop, full of devotion at a cricket or a\npigeon-match, or in the gathering of a steeple-chase. The nineteenth\ncentury is not entirely sceptical on the head of friendship, but fears\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098tis rare. A man may have friends, but then, are they sincere ones?\nDo not they abuse you behind your back, and blackball you at societies\nwhere they have had the honour to propose you? It might philosophically\nbe suggested that it is more agreeable to be abused behind one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s back\nthan to one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s face; and, as for the second catastrophe, it should not be\nforgotten that if the sincere friend may occasionally put a successful\nveto on your election, he is always ready to propose you again.\nGenerally speaking, among sensible persons it would seem that a rich man\ndeems that friend a sincere one who does not want to borrow his money;\nwhile, among the less favoured with fortune\u00e2\u0080\u0099s gifts, the sincere friend\nis generally esteemed to be the individual who is ready to lend it.\n\nAs we must not compare Tancred and Fakredeen to Damon and Pythias,\nand as we cannot easily find in Pall Mall or Park Lane a parallel more\nmodish, we must be content to say, that youth, sympathy, and occasion\ncombined to create between them that intimacy which each was prompt to\nrecognise as one of the principal sources of his happiness, and which\nthe young Emir, at any rate, was persuaded must be as lasting as it was\nfervent and profound.\n\nFakredeen was seen to great advantage among his mountains. He was an\nobject of universal regard, and, anxious to maintain the repute of which\nhe was proud, and which was to be the basis of his future power,\nit seemed that he was always in a gracious and engaging position.\nBrilliant, sumptuous, and hospitable, always doing something kind, or\nsaying something that pleased, the Emirs and Sheikhs, both Maronite and\nDruse, were proud of the princely scion of their greatest house, and\nhastened to repair to Ca-nobia, where they were welcome to ride any of\nhis two hundred steeds, feast on his flocks, quaff his golden wine of\nLebanon, or smoke the delicate tobaccos of his celebrated slopes.\n\nAs for Tancred, his life was novel, interesting, and exciting. The\nmountain breezes soon restored his habitual health; his wound entirely\nhealed; each day brought new scenes, new objects, new characters; and\nthere was ever at his side a captivating companion, who lent additional\ninterest to all he saw and heard by perpetually dwelling on the great\ndrama which they were preparing, and in which all these personages and\ncircumstances were to perform their part and advance their purpose.\n\nAt this moment Fakredeen proposed to himself two objects: the first was,\nto bring together the principal chiefs of the mountain, both Maronite\nand Druse, and virtually to carry into effect at Ca-nobia that\nreconciliation between the two races which had been formally effected at\nBeiroot, in the preceding month of June, by the diplomatic interference\nof the Great Powers, and through the signature of certain articles of\npeace to which we have alluded. His second object was to increase his\nalready considerable influence with these personages, by exhibiting\nto them, as his guest and familiar friend, an English prince, whose\npresence could only be accounted for by duties too grave for ordinary\nenvoys, and who was understood to represent, in their fullest sense, the\nwealth and authority of the richest and most potent of nations.\n\nThe credulous air of Syria was favourable to the great mystification in\nwhich Lord Montacute was an unconscious agent. It was as fully believed\nin the mountain, by all the Habeishes and the Eldadahs, the Kazins and\nthe Elvasuds, the Elheires, and the Hai-dars, great Maronite families,\nas well as by the Druse Djinblats and their rivals, the House of\nYezbeck, or the House of Talhook, or the House of Abuneked, that the\nbrother of the Queen of England was a guest at Canobia as it was in the\nstony wilderness of Petrsea. Ahmet Raslan the Druse and Butros Kerauney\nthe Maronite, who agreed upon no other point, were resolved on this. And\nwas it wonderful, for Butros had already received privately two hundred\nmuskets since the arrival of Tancred, and Raslan had been promised in\nconfidence a slice of the impending English loan by Fakredeen?\n\nThe extraordinary attention, almost homage, which the Emir paid his\nguest entirely authorised these convictions, although they could justify\nno suspicion on the part of Tancred. The natural simplicity of his\nmanners, indeed, and his constitutional reserve, recoiled from the state\nand ceremony with which he found himself frequently surrounded and too\noften treated; but Fakredeen peremptorily stopped his remonstrances by\nassuring him that it was the custom of the country, and that every one\npresent would be offended if a guest of distinction were not entertained\nwith this extreme respect. It is impossible to argue against the customs\nof a country with which you are not acquainted, but coming home one\nday from a hawking party, a large assembly of the most influential\nchieftains, Fakredeen himself bounding on a Kochlani steed, and arrayed\nin a dress that would have become Solyman the Magnificent, Tancred about\nto dismount, the Lord of Canobia pushed forward, and, springing from his\nsaddle, insisted on holding the stirrup of Lord Montacute.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I cannot permit this,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Tancred, reddening, and keeping his seat.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098If you do not, there is not a man here who will not take it as a\npersonal insult,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said the Emir, speaking rapidly between his teeth,\nyet affecting to smile. \u00e2\u0080\u0098It has been the custom of the mountain for more\nthan seven hundred years.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Very strange,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 thought Tancred, as he complied and dismounted.\n\nAll Syria, from Gaza to the Euphrates, is feudal. The system, generally\nprevalent, flourishes in the mountain region even with intenseness. An\nattempt to destroy feudalism occasioned the revolt against the Egyptians\nin 1840, and drove Mehemet Ali from the country which had cost him so\nmuch blood and treasure. Every disorder that has subsequently occurred\nin Syria since the Turkish restoration may be traced to some officious\ninterposition or hostile encroachment in this respect. The lands of\nLebanon are divided into fifteen Mookatas, or feudal provinces, and the\nrights of the mookatadgis, or landlords, in these provinces, are power\nof punishment not extending to death, service in war, and labour in\npeace, and the collection of the imperial revenue from the population,\nwho are in fact their vassals, on which they receive a percentage from\nthe Porte. The administration of police, of the revenue, and indeed\nthe whole internal government of Lebanon, are in the hands of the\nmookatadgis, or rather of the most powerful individuals of this class,\nwho bear the titles of Emirs and Sheikhs, some of whom are proprietors\nto a very great extent, and many of whom, in point of race and antiquity\nof established family, are superior to the aristocracy of Europe.\n\nThere is no doubt that the founders of this privileged and territorial\nclass, whatever may be the present creeds of its members, Moslemin,\nMaronite, or Druse, were the old Arabian conquerors of Syria. The Turks,\nconquerors in their turn, have succeeded in some degree in the plain to\nthe estates and immunities of the followers of the first caliphs; but\nthe Ottomans never substantially prevailed in the Highlands, and their\nauthority has been recognised mainly by management, and as a convenient\ncompromise amid the rivalries of so many local ambitions.\n\nAlways conspicuous among the great families of the Lebanon, during\nthe last century and a half preeminent, has been the House of Shehaab,\npossessing entirely one of the provinces, and widely disseminated and\npowerfully endowed in several of the others. Since the commencement of\nthe eighteenth century, the virtual sovereignty of the country has been\nexercised by a prince of this family, under the title of Chief Emir. The\nchiefs of all the different races have kissed the hand of a Shehaab; he\nhad the power of life and death, could proclaim war and confer honours.\nOf all this family, none were so supreme as the Emir Bescheer, who\ngoverned Lebanon during the Egyptian invasion, and to whose subdolous\ncareer and its consequences we have already referred. When the Turks\ntriumphed in 1840, the Emir Bescheer was deposed, and with his sons sent\nprisoner to Constantinople. The Porte, warned at that time by the too\neasy invasion of Syria and the imminent peril which it had escaped,\nwished itself to assume the government of Lebanon, and to garrison the\npasses with its troops; but the Christian Powers would not consent to\nthis proposition, and therefore Kassim Shehaab was called to the Chief\nEmirate. Acted upon by the patriarch of the Maronites, Kassim, who was a\nChristian Shehaab, countenanced the attempts of his holiness to destroy\nthe feudal privileges of the Druse mookatadgis, while those of the\nMaronites were to be retained. This produced the civil war of 1841\nin Lebanon, which so perplexed and scandalised England, and which\nwas triumphantly appealed to by France as indubitable evidence of the\nweakness and unpopularity of the Turks, and the fruitlessness of our\nprevious interference. The Turks had as little to do with it as M.\nGuizot or Lord Palmerston; but so limited is our knowledge upon these\nsubjects that the cry was successful, and many who had warmly supported\nthe English minister during the previous year, and probably in equal\nignorance of the real merits of the question, began now to shake their\nheads and fear that we had perhaps been too precipitate.\n\nThe Porte adroitly took advantage of the general anarchy to enforce\nthe expediency of its original proposition, to which the Great Powers,\nhowever, would not assent. Kassim was deposed, after a reign of a few\nmonths, amid burning villages and their slaughtered inhabitants; and, as\nthe Porte was resolved not to try another Shehaab, and the Great Powers\nwere resolved not to trust the Porte, diplomacy was obliged again to\ninterfere, and undertake to provide Lebanon with a government.\n\nIt was the interest of two parties, whose cooperation was highly\nessential to the settlement of this question, to prevent the desired\nadjustment, and these were the Turkish government and the family of\nShehaab and their numerous adherents. Anarchy was an argument in the\nmouth of each, that the Lebanon must be governed by the Porte, or that\nthere never could be tranquillity without a Shehaab prince. The Porte in\ngeneral contented itself with being passive and watching the fray, while\nthe agents of the Great Powers planned and promulgated their scheme of\npolity. The Shehaabs were more active, and their efforts were greatly\nassisted by the European project which was announced.\n\nThe principal feature of this administrative design was the institution\nof two governors of Lebanon, called Caimacams, one of whom was to be a\nMaronite and govern the Maronites, and the other a Druse and govern his\nfellow-countrymen. Superficially, this seemed fair enough, but\nreduced into practice the machinery would not work. For instance, the\npopulations in many places were blended. Was a Druse Caimacam to govern\nthe Christians in his district? Was the government of the two Caimacams\nto be sectarian or geographical? Should the Christian Caimacam govern\nall the Christians, and the Druse Caimacam govern all the Druses of\nthe Lebanon? Or should the Christian Caimacam govern the Christian\nMook-atas, as well as such Druses as lived mixed with the Christians\nin the Christian Mookatas, and the Druse Caimacam in the Druse country\nexercise the same rights?\n\nHence arose the terms of mixed Druses and mixed Christians; mixed Druses\nmeaning Druses living in the Christian country, and mixed Christians\nthose living in the Druse country. Such was the origin of the mixed\npopulation question, which entirely upset the project of Downing Street;\nhappy spot, where they draw up constitutions for Syria and treaties for\nChina with the same self-complacency and the same success!\n\nDowning Street (1842) decided upon the sectarian government of the\nLebanon. It was simple, and probably satisfactory, to Exeter Hall;\nbut Downing Street was quite unaware, or had quite forgotten, that the\nfeudal system prevailed throughout Lebanon. The Christians in the Druse\ndistricts were vassals of Druse lords. The direct rule of a Christian\nCaimacam was an infringement on all the feudal rights of the Djinblats\nand Yezbecks, of the Talhooks and the Abdel-Maleks. It would be equally\nfatal to the feudal rights of the Christian chiefs, the Kazins and\nthe El-dadahs, the Elheires and the El Dahers, as regarded their Druse\ntenantry, unless the impossible plan of the patriarch of the Maronites,\nwhich had already produced a civil war, had been adopted. Diplomacy,\ntherefore, seemed on the point of at length succeeding in uniting the\nwhole population of Lebanon in one harmonious action, but unfortunately\nagainst its own project.\n\nThe Shehaab party availed themselves of these circumstances with\ngreat dexterity and vigour. The party was powerful. The whole of the\nMaronites, a population of more than 150,000, were enrolled in their\nranks. The Emir Bescheer was of their faith; so was the unfortunate\nKassim. True, there were several Shehaab princes who were Moslemin, but\nthey might become Christians, and they were not Druses, at least only\ntwo or three of them. The Maronite clergy exercised an unquestioned\ninfluence over their flocks. It was powerfully organised: a patriarch,\nnumerous monasteries, nine prelates, and an active country priesthood.\n\nPreviously to the civil war of 1841, the feeling of the Druses had been\nuniversally in favour of the Shehaabs. The peril in which feudalism\nwas placed revived their ancient sentiments. A Shehaab committee\nwas appointed, with perpetual sittings at Deir el Kamar, the most\nconsiderable place in the Lebanon; and, although it was chiefly composed\nof Christians, there were several Druses at least in correspondence with\nit. But the most remarkable institution which occurred about this time\n(1844) was that of \u00e2\u0080\u0098Young Syria.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 It flourishes: in every town and\nvillage of Lebanon there is a band of youth who acknowledge the title,\nand who profess nationality as their object, though, behind that plea,\nthe restoration of the House of Shehaab generally peeps out.\n\nDowning Street, frightened, gave up sectarian diplomacy, and announced\nthe adoption of the geographical principle of government. The Druses,\nnow that their feudal privileges were secured, cooled in their ardour\nfor nationality. The Shehaabs, on the other hand, finding that the\nDruses were not to be depended on, changed their note. \u00e2\u0080\u0098Is it to be\ntolerated for a moment, that a Christian should be governed by a Druse?\nWere it a Moslem, one might bear it; these things will happen; but a\nDruse, who adores a golden calf, worshippers of Eblis! One might as well\nbe governed by a Jew.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nThe Maronite patriarch sent 200,000 piastres to his children to buy\narms; the superior of the convent of Maashmooshi forwarded little\nless, saying it was much better to spend their treasure in helping the\nChristians than, in keeping it to be plundered by the Druses. Bishop\nTubia gave his bond for a round sum, but afterwards recalled it; Bishop\nJoseph Djezini came into Sidon with his pockets full, and told the\npeople that a prince of the House of Shehaab would soon be at their\nhead, but explained on a subsequent occasion that he went thither merely\nto distribute charity.\n\nIn this state of affairs, in May, 1845, the civil war broke out. The\nChristians attacked the Druses in several districts on the same day. The\nattack was unprovoked, and eventually unsuccessful. Twenty villages\nwere seen burning at the same time from Beiroot. The Druses repulsed\nthe Christians and punished them sharply; the Turkish troops, at the\ninstigation of the European authorities, marched into the mountain and\nvigorously interfered. The Maronites did not show as much courage in the\nfield as in the standing committee at Deir el Kamar, but several of the\nShehaab princes who headed them, especially the Emir Kais, maintained\nthe reputation of their house and displayed a brilliant courage. The\nEmir Fakre-deen was at Canobia at the time of the outbreak, which, as it\noften happens, though not unpremeditated, was unexpected. He marched to\nthe scene of action at the head of his troops, and, when he found\nthat Kais had been outflanked and repulsed, that the Maronites were\ndisheartened in proportion to their previous vanity and insolence, and\nthat the Turkish forces had interfered, he assumed the character of\nmediator. Taking advantage of the circumstances and the alarm of all\nparties at the conjuncture and its yet unascertained consequences, he\nobtained for the Maronites a long-promised indemnity from the Porte for\nthe ravages of the Druses in the civil war of 1841, which the Druses\nhad been unable to pay, on condition that they should accept the\ngeographical scheme of government; and, having signed, with other Emirs\nand Sheikhs, the ten articles of peace, he departed, as we have seen, on\nthat visit to Jerusalem which exercised such control over the career\nof Lord Monta-cute, and led to such strange results and such singular\nadventures.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLIII.\n\n     _Festivities in Canobia_\n\nGALLOPED up the winding steep of Canobia the Sheikh Said Djinblat,\none of the most popular chieftains of the Druses; amiable and brave,\ntrustworthy and soft-mannered. Four of his cousins rode after him: he\ncame from his castle of Mooktara, which was not distant. He was in the\nprime of manhood, tall and lithe; enveloped in a burnous which shrouded\nhis dark eye, his white turban, and his gold-embroidered vests; his long\nlance was couched in its rest, as he galloped up the winding steep of\nCanobia.\n\nCame slowly, on steeds dark as night, up the winding steep of Canobia,\nwith a company of twenty men on foot armed with muskets and handjars,\nthe two ferocious brothers Abuneked, Nasif and Hamood. Pale is the cheek\nof the daughters of Maron at the fell name of Abuneked. The Abunekeds\nwere the Druse lords of the town of Deir el Kamar, where the majority of\nthe inhabitants were Christian. When the patriarch tried to deprive the\nDruses of their feudal rights, the Abunekeds attacked and sacked their\nown town of Deir el Kamar. The civil war being terminated, and it being\nagreed, in the settlement of the indemnities from the Druses to the\nMaronites, that all plunder still in possession of the plunderers should\nbe restored, Nasif Abuneked said, \u00e2\u0080\u0098I have five hundred silver horns, and\neach of them I took from the head of a Christian woman. Come and fetch\nthem.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nBut all this is forgotten now; and least of all should it be remembered\nby the meek-looking individual who is at this moment about to ascend\nthe winding steep of Canobia. Riding on a mule, clad in a coarse brown\nwoollen dress, in Italy or Spain we should esteem him a simple Capuchin,\nbut in truth he is a prelate, and a prelate of great power; Bishop\nNicodemus, to wit, prime councillor of the patriarch, and chief prompter\nof those measures that occasioned the civil war of 1841. A single\nsacristan walks behind him, his only retinue, and befitting his limited\nresources; but the Maronite prelate is recompensed by universal respect;\nhis vanity is perpetually gratified, and, when he appears, Sheikh and\npeasant are alike proud to kiss the hand which his reverence is ever\nprompt to extend.\n\nPlaced on a more eminent stage, and called upon to control larger\ncircumstances, Bishop Nicodemus might have rivalled the Bishop of Autun;\nso fertile was he in resource, and so intuitive was his knowledge of\nmen. As it was, he wasted his genius in mountain squabbles, and in\nregulating the discipline of his little church; suspending priests,\ninterdicting monks, and inflicting public penance on the laity. He\nrather resembled De Retz than Talleyrand, for he was naturally turbulent\nand intriguing. He could under no circumstances let well alone. He was\na thorough Syrian, at once subtle and imaginative. Attached to the House\nof Shehaab by policy, he was devoted to Fakredeen as much by sympathy\nas interest, and had contrived the secret mission of Archbishop Murad\nto Europe, which had so much perplexed M. Guizot, Lord Cowley, and Lord\nAberdeen; and which finally, by the intervention of the same Bishop\nNicodemus, Fakredeen had disowned.\n\nCame caracoling up the winding steep of Canobia a troop of horsemen,\nshowily attired, and riding steeds that danced in the sunny air. These\nwere the princes Kais and Abdullah Shehaab, and Francis El Kazin, whom\nthe Levantines called Caseno, and the principal members of the Young\nSyria party; some of them beardless Sheikhs, but all choicely mounted,\nand each holding on his wrist a falcon; for this was the first day of\nthe year that they might fly. But those who cared not to seek a quarry\nin the partridge or the gazelle, might find the wild boar or track the\npanther in the spacious woods of Canobia.\n\nAnd the Druse chief of the House of Djezbek, who for five hundred years\nhad never yielded precedence to the House of Djinblat, and Sheikh Fahour\nKang\u00c3\u00a9, who since the civil war had never smoked a pipe with a Maronite,\nbut who now gave the salaam of peace to the crowds of Habeishs and\nDahdahes who passed by; and Butros Keramy, the nephew of the patriarch,\nhimself a great Sheikh, who inhaled his nargileh as he rode, and who\nlooked to the skies and puffed forth his smoke whenever he met a son\nof Eblis; and the House of Talhook, and the House of Abdel-Malek and\na swarm of Elvasuds, and Elheires, and El Dahers, Emirs and Sheikhs on\ntheir bounding steeds, and musketeers on foot, with their light jackets\nand bare legs and wooden sandals, and black slaves, carrying vases and\ntubes; everywhere a brilliant and animated multitude, and all mounting\nthe winding steep of Canobia.\n\nThe great court of the castle was crowded with men and horses, and fifty\nmouths at once were drinking at the central basin; the arcades were full\nof Sheikhs, smoking and squatted on their carpets, which in general they\nhad spread in this locality in preference to the more formal saloons,\nwhose splendid divans rather embarrassed them; though even these\nchambers were well attended, the guests principally seated on the marble\nfloors covered with their small bright carpets. The domain immediately\naround the castle was also crowded with human beings. The moment anyone\narrived, his steed was stabled or picketed; his attendants spread his\ncarpet, sought food for him, which was promptly furnished, with coffee\nand sherbets, and occasionally wine; and when he had sufficiently\nrefreshed himself, he lighted his nargileh.\n\nEverywhere there was a murmur, but no uproar; a stir, but no tumult. And\nwhat was most remarkable amid these spears and sabres, these muskets,\nhandjars, and poniards, was the sweet and perpetually recurring Syrian\nsalutation of \u00e2\u0080\u0098Peace.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nFakredeen, moving about in an immense turban, of the most national and\nunreformed style, and covered with costly shawls and arms flaming with\njewels, recognised and welcomed everyone. He accosted Druse and Maronite\nwith equal cordiality, talked much with Said Djinblat, whom he specially\nwished to gain, and lent one of his choicest steeds to the Djezbek, that\nhe might not be offended. The Talhook and the Abdel-Malek could not be\njealous of the Habeish and the Eldadah. He kissed the hand of Bishop\nNicodemus, but then he sent his own nargileh to the Emir Ahmet Raslan,\nwho was Caimacam of the Druses.\n\nIn this strange and splendid scene, Tancred, dressed in a velvet\nshooting-jacket built in St. James\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Street and a wide-awake which had\nbeen purchased at Bellamont market, and leaning on a rifle which was the\nmasterpiece of Purday, was not perhaps the least interesting personage.\nThe Emirs and Sheikhs, notwithstanding the powers of dissimulation for\nwhich the Orientals are renowned, their habits of self-restraint, and\ntheir rooted principle never to seem surprised about anything, have a\nweakness in respect to arms. After eyeing Tancred for a considerable\ntime with imperturbable countenances, Francis El Kazin sent to Fakredeen\nto know whether the English prince would favour them by shooting an\neagle. This broke the ice, and Fakredeen came, and soon the rifle was in\nthe hands of Francis El Kazin. Sheikh Said Djinblat, who would have died\nrather than have noticed the rifle in the hands of Tancred, could not\nresist examining it when in the possession of a brother Sheikh. Kais\nShehaab, several Habeishes and Elda-dahs gathered round; exclamations\nof wonder and admiration arose; sundry asseverations that God was great\nfollowed.\n\nFreeman and Trueman, who were at hand, were summoned to show their\nlord\u00e2\u0080\u0099s double-barrelled gun, and his pistols with hair-triggers.\nThis they did, with that stupid composure and dogged conceit which\ndistinguish English servants in situations which must elicit from all\nother persons some ebullition of feeling.\n\nExchanging between themselves glances of contempt at the lords of\nLebanon, who were ignorant of what everybody knows, they exhibited\nthe arms without the slightest interest or anxiety to make the Sheikhs\ncomprehend them; till Tancred, mortified at their brutality, himself\ninterfered, and, having already no inconsiderable knowledge of the\nlanguage of the country, though, from his reserve, Fakredeen little\nsuspected the extent of his acquirements, explained felicitously to\nhis companions the process of the arms; and then taking his rifle, and\nstepping out upon the terrace, he levelled his piece at a heron which\nwas soaring at a distance of upwards of one hundred yards, and brought\nthe bird down amid the applause both of Maronite and Druse.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098He is sent here, I understand,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Butros Keramy, \u00e2\u0080\u0098to ascertain\nfor the Queen of the English whether the country is in favour of the\nShehaabs. Could you believe it, but I was told yesterday at Deir el\nKamar, that the English consul has persuaded the Queen that even the\npatriarch was against the Shehaabs?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Is it possible?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Rafael Farah, a Maronite of the House\nof Eldadah. \u00e2\u0080\u0098It must be the Druses who circulate these enormous\nfalsehoods.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Hush!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Young Syria, in the shape of Francis El Kazin, \u00e2\u0080\u0098there is no\nlonger Maronite or Druse: we are all Syrians, we are brothers.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Then a good many of my brothers are sons of Eblis,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Butros Keramy.\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I hope he is not my father.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Truly, I should like to see the mountain without the Maronite nation,\u00e2\u0080\u0099\nsaid Rafael Farah. \u00e2\u0080\u0098That would be a year without rain.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098And mighty things your Maronite nation has done!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 rejoined Francis El\nKazin. \u00e2\u0080\u0098If there had been the Syrian nation instead of the Maronite\nnation, and the Druse nation, and half a dozen other nations besides,\ninstead of being conquered by Egypt in 1832, we should have conquered\nEgypt ourselves long ago, and have held it for our farm. We have done\nmighty things truly with our Maronite nation!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098To hear an El Kazin speak against the Maronite nation!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 exclaimed\nRafael Farah, with a look of horror; \u00e2\u0080\u0098a natipn that has two hundred\nconvents!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098And a patriarch,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Butros Keramy, \u00e2\u0080\u0098very much respected even by the\nPope of Rome.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098And who were disarmed like sheep,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Francis.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Not because we were beaten,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Butros, who was brave enough.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098We were persuaded to that,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Rafael.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098By our monks,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Francis; \u00e2\u0080\u0098the convents you are so proud of.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098They were deceived by sons of Eblis,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Butros. \u00e2\u0080\u0098I never gave up\nmy arms. I have some pieces now, that, although they are not as fine\nas those of the English prince, could pick a son of Eblis off behind a\nrock, whether he be Egyptian or Druse.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Hush!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Francis El Kazin. \u00e2\u0080\u0098You love our host, Butros; these are not\nwords that will please him----\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Or me, my children,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Bishop Nicodemus. \u00e2\u0080\u0098This is a great day for\nSyria! to find the chiefs of both nations assembled at the castle of a\nShehaab. Why am I here but to preach peace and love? And Butros Keramy,\nmy friend, my dearly beloved brother Butros, if you wish to please the\npatriarch, your uncle, who loves you so well, you will no longer call\nDruses sons of Eblis.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098What are we to call them?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 asked Rafael Farah, pettishly.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Brothers,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 replied Bishop Nicodemus; \u00e2\u0080\u0098misguided, but still brothers.\nThis is not a moment for brawls, when the great Queen of the English has\nsent hither her own brother to witness the concord of the mountain.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nNow arose the sound of tabors, beaten without any attempt at a tune, but\nwith unremitting monotony, then the baying of many hounds more distant.\nThere was a bustle. Many Sheikhs slowly rose; their followers rushed\nabout; some looked at their musket locks, some poised their pikes and\nspears, some unsheathed their handjars, examined their edge, and then\nreturned them to their sheath. Those who were in the interior of the\ncastle came crowding into the great court, which, in turn, poured forth\nits current of population into the table-land about the castle. Here,\nheld by grooms, or picketed, were many steeds. The mares of the Emir\nFakredeen were led about by his black slaves. Many of the Sheikhs,\nmounted, prepared for the pastime that awaited them.\n\nThere was to be a grand chase in the oak forest, through part of which\nTancred had already travelled, and which spread over a portion of the\nplain and the low hilly country that encompassed it. Three parties,\nrespectively led by the Emir Fakredeen, and the Caimacams of the two\nnations, were to penetrate into this forest at different and distant\npoints, so that the sport was spread over a surface of many miles.\nThe heads of the great houses of both nations accompanied the Emir of\nCanobia; their relatives and followers, by the exertions of Francis El\nKazin and Young Syria, were in general so disturbed that the Maronites\nwere under the command of the Emir Raslan, the Druse Caimacam, while the\nDruses followed the Emir Hai-dar. This great hunting party consisted of\nmore than eight hundred persons, about half of whom were mounted, but\nall were armed; even those who held the dogs in leash were entitled\nto join in the sport with the same freedom as the proudest Sheikh. The\nthree leaders having mounted and bowed gracefully to each other, the\ncavalcades separated and descended into the plain. The moment they\nreached the level country, the horsemen shouted and dispersed, galloping\nin all directions, and many of them throwing their spears; but, in a\nshort time, they had collected again under their respective leaders, and\nthe three distinct bodies, each a moving and many-coloured mass, might\nbe observed from the castled heights, each instant diminishing in size\nand lustre, until they vanished at different points in the distance, and\nwere lost amid the shades of the forest.\n\nFor many hours throughout this region nothing was heard but the firing\nof guns, the baying of hounds, the shouting of men; not a human being\nwas visible, except some groups of women in the villages, with veils\nsuspended on immense silver horns, like our female headgear of the\nmiddle ages. By-and-by, figures were seen stealing forth from the\nforest, men on foot, one or two, then larger parties; some reposed on\nthe plain, some returned to the villages, some re-ascended the winding\nsteeps of Canobia. The firing, the shouting, the baying had become more\noccasional. Now a wearied horseman picked his slow way over the plain;\nthen came forth a brighter company, still bounding along. And now they\nissued, but slowly and in small parties, from various and opposite\nquarters of the woodland. A great detachment, in a certain order, were\nthen observed to cross the plain, and approach the castle. They advanced\nvery gradually, for most of them were on foot, and joining together,\nevidently carried burdens; they were preceded and followed by a guard\nof cavalry. Soon it might be perceived that the produce of the chase was\narriving: twenty-five wild boars carried on litters of green branches;\ninnumerable gazelles borne by their victors; transfixed by four spears,\nand carried by four men, a hyena.\n\nNot very long after this caravan had reached the castle, the firing,\nwhich had died away, recommenced; the sounds were near at hand; there\nwas a volley, and almost simultaneously there issued from various parts\nof the forest the great body of the hunt. They maintained no order on\ntheir return, but dispersed over the plain, blending together, galloping\ntheir steeds, throwing their lances, and occasionally firing a shot.\nFakredeen and his immediate friends rode up to the Caimacam of the\nDruses, and they offered each other mutual congratulations on the sport\nof the morning. They waited for the Caimacam of the Maronites, who,\nhowever, did not long detain them; and, when he appeared, their suites\njoined, and, cantering off at a brisk pace, they soon mounted in company\nthe winding steeps of Canobia.\n\nThe kitchen of Canobia was on a great scale, though simple as it was\nvast. It was formed for the occasion. About fifty square pits, some four\nfeet in length, and about half as deep, had been dug on the table-land\nin the vicinity of the castle. At each corner of each pit was a stake,\nand the four supported a rustic gridiron of green wood, suspended over\neach pit, which was filled with charcoal, and which yielded an equal\nand continuous heat to the animal reposing on the gridiron: in some\ninstances a wild boar, in others a sheep--occasionally a couple of\ngazelles. The sheep had been skinned, for there had been time for the\noperation; but the game had only been split open, cleared out, and laid\non its back, with its feet tied to each of the stakes, so as to retain\nits position. While this roasting was going on, they filled the stomachs\nof the animals with lemons gashed with their daggers, and bruised\npomegranates, whose fragrant juice, uniting with the bubbling fat,\nproduced an aromatic and rosy gravy. The huntsmen were the cooks, but\nthe greatest order was preserved; and though the Emirs and the great\nSheikhs, heads of houses, retiring again to their divans, occupied\nthemselves with their nargilehs, many a mookatadgi mixed with the\nservants and the slaves, and delighted in preparing this patriarchal\nbanquet, which indeed befitted a castle and a forest. Within the walls\nthey prepared rice, which they piled on brazen and pewter dishes,\nboiled gallons of coffee, and stewed the liver of the wild boars and the\ngazelles in the golden wine of Lebanon.\n\nThe way they dined was this. Fakredeen had his carpet spread on the\nmarble floor of his principal saloon, and the two Caimacams, Tancred\nand Bishop Nicodemus, Said Djinblat, the heads of the Houses of Djezbek,\nTalhook, and Abdel-Malek, Hamood Abune-ked, and five Maronite chieftains\nof equal consideration, the Emirs of the House of Shehaab, the Habeish,\nand the Eldadah, were invited to sit with him. Round the chamber which\nopened to the air, other chieftains were invited to spread their\ncarpets also; the centre was left clear. The rest of the Sheikhs and\nrhookatadgis established themselves in small parties, grouped in the\nsame fashion, in the great court and under the arcades, taking care to\nleave free egress and regress to the fountain. The retainers feasted,\nwhen all was over, in the open air.\n\nEvery man found his knife in his girdle, forks were unknown. Fakredeen\nprided himself on his French porcelain, which the Djinblats, the\nTalhooks, and the Abunekeds glanced at very queerly. This European\nluxury was confined to his own carpet. There was, however, a\nconsiderable supply of Egyptian earthenware, and dishes of pewter and\nbrass. The retainers, if they required a plate, found one in the large\nflat barley cake with which each was supplied. For the principal guests\nthere was no want of coarse goblets of Bohemian glass; delicious\nwater abounded in vases of porous pottery, which might be blended, if\nnecessary, with the red or white wine of the mountain. The rice, which\nhad been dressed with a savoury sauce, was eaten with wooden spoons\nby those who were supplied with these instruments; but in general the\nguests served themselves by handfuls.\n\nTen men brought in a framework of oaken branches placed transversely,\nthen covered with twigs, and over these, and concealing everything, a\nbed, fully an inch thick, of mulberry leaves. Upon this fragrant bier\nreposed a wild boar; and on each side of him reclined a gazelle. Their\nbodies had closed the moment their feet had been loosened from the\nstakes, so that the gravy was contained within them. It required a most\nskilful carver not to waste this precious liquid. The chamber was filled\nwith an invigorating odour as the practised hand of Habas of Deir el\nKamar proceeded to the great performance. His instruments were a silver\ncup, a poniard, and a handjar. Making a small aperture in the side of\nthe animal, he adroitly introduced the cup, and proportionately baled\nout the gravy to a group of plates that were extended to him; then,\nplunging in the long poniard on which he rested, he made an incision\nwith the keen edge and broad blade of the handjar, and sent forth slice\nafter slice of white fat and ruby flesh.\n\nThe same ceremony was performing in the other parts of the castle.\nTen of the pits had been cleared of their burden to appease the first\ncravings of the appetite of the hunters. The fires had been replenished,\nthe gridirons again covered, and such a supply kept up as should not\nonly satisfy the chieftains, but content their followers. Tancred could\nnot refrain from contrasting the silent, business-like way in which the\nShehaabs, the Talhooks, the Djinblats, and the Habeish performed the\ngreat operation that was going on, with the conversation which is\nconsidered an indispensable accompaniment of a dinner in Fran-guestan;\nfor we must no longer presume to call Europe by its beautiful oriental\nname of Christendom. The Shehaabs, the Talhooks, the Djinblats, and the\nHabeish were sensible men, who were of opinion that if you want to talk\nyou should not by any means eat, since from such an attempt at a united\nperformance it generally results that you neither converse nor refresh\nyourself in a satisfactory manner.\n\nThere can be no question that, next to the corroding cares of Europeans,\nprincipally occasioned by their love of accumulating money which they\nnever enjoy, the principal cause of the modern disorder of dyspepsia\nprevalent among them is their irrational habit of interfering with the\nprocess of digestion by torturing attempts at repartee, and racking\ntheir brain at a moment when it should be calm, to remind themselves of\nsome anecdote so appropriate that they have forgotten it. It has been\nsupposed that the presence of women at our banquets has occasioned this\nfatal and inopportune desire to shine; and an argument has been founded\non this circumstance in favour of their exclusion from an incident\nwhich, on the whole, has a tendency to impair that ideal which they\nshould always study and cherish. It may be urged that if a woman eats\nshe may destroy her spell; and that, if she will not eat, she destroys\nour dinner.\n\nNotwithstanding all this, and without giving any opinion on this latter\npoint, it should be remembered that at dinners strictly male, where\nthere is really no excuse for anything of the kind, where, if you are\na person of ascertained position, you are invited for that position\nand for nothing else, and where, if you are not a person of ascertained\nposition, the more agreeable you make yourself the more you will be\nhated, and the less chance you will have of being asked there again,\nor anywhere else, still this fatal frenzy prevails; and individuals are\nfound who, from soup to coffee, from egg to apple, will tell anecdotes,\nindulge in jests, or, in a tone of levity approaching to jesting, pour\nforth garrulous secret history with which everyone is acquainted, and\nnever say a single thing which is new that is not coolly invented for\nthe occasion.\n\nThe princes of the Houses of Shehaab, Kais, and Assaad, and Abdullah,\nthe Habeish and the Eldadah, the great Houses of the Druses, the\nDjinblat and the Yezbek, the Abuneked, the Talhook, and the Abdel-Malek,\nwere not of this school. Silently, determinedly, unceasing, unsatiated,\nthey proceeded with the great enterprise on which they had embarked. If\nthe two nations were indeed to be united, and form a great whole\nunder the sceptre of a Shehaab, let not this banquet pass like the\nhypocritical hospitality of ordinary life, where men offer what they\ndesire not to be accepted by those who have no wish to receive. This, on\nthe contrary, was a real repast, a thing to be remembered. Practice\nmade the guests accustomed to the porcelain of Paris and the goblets of\nPrague. Many was the goodly slice of wild boar, succeeded by the\nrich flesh of the gazelle, of which they disposed. There were also\nwood-pigeons, partridges, which the falconers had brought down, and\nquails from the wilderness. At length they called again for rice, a\ncustom which intimated that their appetite for meat was satisfied, and\nimmediately Nubian slaves covered them with towels of fine linen fringed\nwith gold, and, while they held their hands over the basin, poured sweet\nwaters from the ewer.\n\nIn the meantime, Butros Keramy opened his heart to Rafael Farah.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I begin,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Butros, quaffing a cup of the Vino d\u00e2\u0080\u0099Oro, \u00e2\u0080\u0098to believe in\nnationality.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098It cannot be denied,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Rafael Farah, judiciously shaking his head,\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098that the two nations were once under the same prince. If the great\npowers would agree to a Shehaab, and we could sometimes meet together in\nthe present fashion, there is no saying, prejudices might wear off.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Shall it ever be said that I am of the same nation as Hamood Abuneked?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\nsaid Butros.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Ah! it is very dreadful,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Rafael; \u00e2\u0080\u0098a man who has burned convents!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098And who has five hundred Maronite horns in his castle,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Butros.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098But suppose he restores them?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Francis El Kazin.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098That would make a difference,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Rafael Farah.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098There can be no difference while he lives,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Butros.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I fear \u00e2\u0080\u0098tis an affair of blood,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Rafael Farah.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Taking horns was never an affair of blood,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Francis El Kazin.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098What should be an affair of blood,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Butros, \u00e2\u0080\u0098if----\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098But nothing else but taking horns can be proved,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Francis El\nKazin.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098There is a good deal in that!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Rafael Farah.\n\nAfter confectionery which had been prepared by nuns, and strong waters\nwhich had been distilled by the hands of priors, the chieftains praised\nGod, and rose, and took their seats on the divan, when immediately\nadvanced a crowd of slaves, each bearing a nargileh, which they\npresented to the guests. Then gradually the conversation commenced. It\nwas entirely confined to the exploits of the day, which had been rich in\nthe heroic feats of forest huntsmen. There had been wild boars, too,\nas brave as their destroyers; some slight wounds, some narrow escapes.\nSheikh Said Djinblat inquired of Lord Montacute whether there were\nhyenas in England, but was immediately answered by the lively and\nwell-informed Kais Shehaab, who apprised him that there were only lions\nand unicorns. Bishop Nicodemus, who watched the current of observations,\nbegan telling hunting stories of the time of the Emir Bescheer, when\nthat prince resided at his splendid castle of Bteddeen, near Deir el\nKamar. This was to recall the days when the mountain had only one ruler,\nand that ruler a Shehaab, and when the Druse lords were proud to be\nclassed among his most faithful subjects.\n\nIn the meantime smoking had commenced throughout the castle, but this\ndid not prevent the smokers from drinking raki as well as the sober\njuice of Mocha. Four hundred men, armed with nargileh or chibouque,\ninhaling and puffing with that ardour and enjoyment which men, after\na hard day\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hunting, and a repast of unusual solidity, can alone\nexperience! Without the walls, almost as many individuals were feasting\nin the open air; brandishing their handjars as they cut up the huge\nmasses of meat before them, plunging their eager hands into the enormous\ndishes of rice, and slaking their thirst by emptying at a draught a vase\nof water, which they poured aloft as the Italians would a flask of wine\nor oil.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098And the most curious thing,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Freeman to Trueman, as they\nestablished themselves under a pine tree, with an ample portion of roast\nmeat, and armed with their traveling knives and forks, \u00e2\u0080\u0098and the most\ncurious thing is, that they say these people are Christians! Who ever\nheard of Christians wearing turbans?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Or eating without knives and forks?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 added True-man.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098It would astonish their weak minds in the steward\u00e2\u0080\u0099s room at Bellamont,\nif they could see all this, John,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Mr. Freeman, pensively. \u00e2\u0080\u0098A man\nwho travels has very great advantages.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098And very great hardships too,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Trueman. \u00e2\u0080\u0098I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t care for work,\nbut I do like to have my meals regular.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098This is not bad picking, though,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Mr. Freeman; \u00e2\u0080\u0098they call it\ngazelle, which I suppose is the foreign for venison.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098If you called this venison at Bellamont,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Trueman, \u00e2\u0080\u0098they would\nlook very queer in the steward\u00e2\u0080\u0099s room.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Bellamont is Bellamont, and this place is this place, John,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Mr.\nFreeman. \u00e2\u0080\u0098The Hameer is a noble gentleman, every inch of him, and I\nam very glad my lord has got a companion of his own kidney. It is much\nbetter than monks and hermits, and low people of that sort, who are not\nby no means fit company for somebody I could mention, and might turn him\ninto a papist into the bargain.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098That would be a bad business,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Trueman; \u00e2\u0080\u0098my lady could never abide\nthat. It would be better that he should turn Turk.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I am not sure it wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Mr. Freeman. \u00e2\u0080\u0098It would be in a manner\nmore constitutional. The Sultan of Turkey may send an Ambassador to our\nQueen, but the Pope of Rome may not.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I should not like to turn Turk,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Trueman, very thoughtfully.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I know what you are thinking of, John,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Mr. Freeman, in a serious\ntone. \u00e2\u0080\u0098You are thinking, if anything were to happen to either of us in\nthis heathen land, where we should get Christian burial.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Lord love you, Mr. Freeman, no, I wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t. I was thinking of a glass of\nale.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Ah!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 sighed Freeman, \u00e2\u0080\u0098it softens the heart to think of such things away\nfrom home, as we are. Do you know, John, there are times when I feel\nvery queer, there are indeed. I catched myself a singing \u00e2\u0080\u009cSweet Home\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n one night, among those savages in the wilderness. One wants consolation,\nJohn, sometimes, one does, indeed; and, for my part, I do miss the\nfamily prayers and the home-brewed.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nAs the twilight died away, they lighted immense bonfires, as well to\ncheer them during their bivouac, as to deter any adventurous panther,\nstimulated by the savoury odours, or hyena, breathing fraternal revenge,\nfrom reconnoitring their encampment. By degrees, however, the noise\nof the revellers without subsided, and at length died away. Having\nsatisfied their hunger, and smoked their chibouques, often made from the\nbranch which they had cut since their return from hunting, with the bud\nstill alive upon the fresh green tube, they wrapped themselves in their\ncloaks and sheepskins, and sunk into a deep and well-earned repose.\n\nWithin, the Sheikhs and mookatadgis gradually, by no means\nsimultaneously, followed their example. Some, taking off their turbans\nand loosening their girdles, ensconced themselves under the arcades,\nlying on their carpets, and covered with their pelisses and cloaks; some\nstrolled into the divaned chambers, which were open to all, and more\ncomfortably stowed themselves upon the well-stuffed cushions; others,\novercome with fatigue and their revel, were lying in deep sleep,\noutstretched in the open court, and picturesque in the blazing\nmoonlight.\n\nThe hunting party was to last three days, and few intended to leave\nCanobia on the morrow; but it must not be supposed that the guests\nexperienced any very unusual hardships in what the reader may consider a\nfar from satisfactory mode of passing their night. To say nothing of the\nwarm and benignant climate, the Easterns have not the custom of retiring\nor rising with the formality of the Occidental nations. They take their\nsleep when they require it, and meet its embrace without preparation.\nOne cause of this difference undoubtedly is, that the Orientals do not\nconnect the business of the toilet with that of rest. The daily bath,\nwith its elaborate processes, is the spot where the mind ponders on the\ncolour of a robe or the fashion of a turban; the daily bath, which is\nthe principal incident of Oriental habits, and which can scarcely be\nsaid to exist among our own.\n\nFakredeen had yielded even his own chambers to his friends. Every divan\nin Canobia was open, excepting the rooms of Tancred. These were sacred,\nand the Emir had requested his friend to receive him as a guest during\nthe festival, and apportion him one of his chambers. The head of the\nHouse of Talhook was asleep with the tube of his nargileh in his mouth;\nthe Yezbek had unwound his turban, cast off his sandals, wrapped himself\nin his pelisses, and fairly turned in; Bishop Nicodemus was kneeling\nin a corner and kissing a silver cross; and Hamood Abu-neked had rolled\nhimself up in a carpet, and was snoring as if he were blowing through\none of the horns of the Maronites. Fakredeen shot a glance at Tancred,\ninstantly recognised. Then, rising and giving the salaam of peace to\nhis guests, the Emir and his English friend made their escape down a\ncorridor, at the bottom of which was one of the few doors that could be\nfound in the castle of Canobia. Baroni received them, on the watch\nlest some cruising Sheikh should appropriate their resting-place. The\nyoung-moon, almost as young and bright as it was two months before at\nGaza, suffused with lustre the beautiful garden of fruit and flowers\nwithout. Under the balcony, Baroni had placed a divan with many\ncushions, a lamp with burning coffee, and some fresh nargilehs.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Thank God, we are alone!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 exclaimed Fakredeen. \u00e2\u0080\u0098Tell me, my Tancred,\nwhat do you think of it all?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLIV.\n\n     _Fakredeen\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Debts_\n\nIT HAS been a great day,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Tancred \u00e2\u0080\u0098not to be forgotten.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Yes; but what do you think of them? Are they the fellows I described;\nthe men that might conquer the world?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098To conquer the world depends on men not only being good soldiers, but\nbeing animated by some sovereign principle that nothing can resist,\u00e2\u0080\u0099\nreplied Tancred.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098But that we have got,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 rejoined Fakredeen.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098But have they got it?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098We can give it to them.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I am not so sure of that. It seems to me that we are going to establish\na theocratic equality by the aid of the feudal system.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098That is to say, their present system,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 replied Fakredeen. \u00e2\u0080\u0098Islamism\nwas propagated by men who were previously idolaters, and our principle\nmay be established by those whose practice at the present time is\ndirectly opposed to it.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I still cling to my first idea of making the movement from the desert,\u00e2\u0080\u0099\nsaid Tancred: \u00e2\u0080\u0098the Arabians are entirely unsophisticated; they are now\nas they were in the time of Mahomet, of Moses, of Abraham: a sublime\ndevotion is natural to them, and equality, properly developed, is in\nfact the patriarchal principle.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098But these are Arabians,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Fakredeen; \u00e2\u0080\u0098I am an Arabian; there is not\na mookatadgi, whatever his present creed, who does not come from Yemen,\nor the Hedjaz, or the Nejid.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098That is a great qualification,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Tancred, musingly.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098And, see what men these are!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 continued Fakredeen, with great\nanimation. \u00e2\u0080\u0098Lebanon can send forth more than fifty thousand well-armed,\nand yet let enough stay at home to guard the mulberry trees and the\nwomen. Then you can keep them for nothing; a Bedouin is not more\ntemperate than a Druse, if he pleases: he will get through a campaign\non olives and cheese; they do not require even tents; they bivouac in a\nsheepskin.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098And yet,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Tancred, \u00e2\u0080\u0098though they have maintained themselves, they\nhave done nothing; now, the Arabs have always succeeded.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I will tell you how that is,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Fakredeen. \u00e2\u0080\u0098It is very true that we\nhave not done much, and that, when we descended into the plain, as we\ndid in \u00e2\u0080\u009863, under the Emir Yousef, we were beat, beaten back even by the\nMutualis; it is that we have no cavalry. They have always contrived\nto enlist the great tribes of the Syrian desert against us, as for\ninstance, under Daher, of whom you must have heard: it was that which\nhas prevented our development; but we have always maintained ourselves.\nLebanon is the key of Syria, and the country was never unlocked unless\nwe pleased. But this difficulty is now removed. Through Amalek we shall\nhave the desert on our side; he is omnipotent in the Syrian wilderness;\nand if he sends messengers through Petr\u00c3\u00a6a to Derayeh, the Nejid, and\nthrough the Hedjaz, to Yemen and Oman, we could easily get a cavalry as\nefficient and not less numerous than our foot.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098The instruments will be found,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Tancred, \u00e2\u0080\u0098for it is decreed that\nthe deed should be done. But the favour of Providence does not exempt\nman from the exercise of human prudence. On the contrary, it is an agent\non whose co-operation they are bound to count. I should like to see\nsomething of the great Syrian cities. I should like also to see Bagdad.\nIt appears to me, at the first glance, that the whole country to the\nEuphrates might be conquered in a campaign; but then I want to know how\nfar artillery is necessary, whether it be indispensable. Then again,\nthe Lesser Asia; we should never lose sight of the Lesser Asia as the\nprincipal scene of our movements; the richest regions in the world,\nalmost depopulated, and a position from which we might magnetise Europe.\nBut suppose the Turks, through Lesser Asia, conquer Lebanon, while we\nare overrunning the Babylonian and Assyrian monarchies? That will never\ndo. I see your strength here with your own people and the Druses, and\nI do not underrate their qualities: but who is to garrison the north of\nSyria? Who is to keep the passes of the North? What population have you\nto depend on between Tripoli and Antioch, or between Aleppo and Adanah?\nOf all this I know nothing.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nFakredeen had entirely imbibed the views of Tancred; he was sincere in\nhis professions, fervent in his faith. A great feudal proprietor, he was\nprepared to forsake his beautiful castle, his farms and villages, his\nvineyards, and mulberry orchards, and forests of oaks, to assist in\nestablishing, by his voice and his sabre, a new social system, which was\nto substitute the principle of association for that of dependence as the\nfoundation of the Commonwealth, under the sanction and superintendence\nof the God of Sinai and of Calvary. True it was that the young Syrian\nEmir intended, that among the consequences of the impending movement\nshould be his enthronement on one of the royal seats of Asia. But we\nshould do him injustice, were we to convey the impression that his\nardent co-operation with Tancred at this moment was impelled merely,\nor even principally, by these coarsely selfish considerations. Men\ncertainly must be governed, whatever the principle of the social system,\nand Fakredeen felt born with a predisposition to rule.\n\nBut greater even than his desire for empire was his thirst for action.\nHe was wearied with the glittering cage in which he had been born. He\npanted for a wider field and a nobler theatre, interests more vast and\nincidents more dazzling and comprehensive; he wished to astonish Europe\ninstead of Lebanon, and to use his genius in baffling and controlling\nthe thrones and dominations of the world, instead of managing the simple\nSheikhs and Emirs of his mountains. His castle and fine estates were no\nsources of satisfaction to him. On the contrary, he viewed Canobia with\ndisgust. It entailed duties, and brought no excitement. He was seldom\nat home and only for a few passing days: continued residence was\nintolerable to his restless spirit. He passed his life in perpetual\nmovement, scudding about on the fleetest dromedaries, and galloping over\nthe deserts on steeds of the highest race.\n\nThough proud of his ancient house, and not unequal, when necessary, to\nthe due representation of his position, unlike the Orientals in general,\nhe disliked pomp, and shrank from the ceremony which awaited him. His\nrestless, intriguing, and imaginative spirit revelled in the incognito.\nHe was perpetually in masquerade; a merchant, a Mamlouk, a soldier of\nfortune, a Tartar messenger, sometimes a pilgrim, sometimes a dervish,\nalways in pursuit of some improbable but ingenious object, or lost in\nthe mazes of some fantastic plot. He enjoyed moving alone without a\nsingle attendant; and seldom in his mountains, he was perpetually in\nEgypt, Bagdad, Cyprus, Smyrna, and the Syrian cities. He sauntered away\na good deal of his time indeed in the ports and towns of the coast,\nlooking after his creditors; but this was not the annoyance to him which\nit would be to most men.\n\nFakredeen was fond of his debts; they were the source indeed of his only\nreal excitement, and he was grateful to them for their stirring powers.\nThe usurers of Syria are as adroit and callous as those of all other\ncountries, and possess no doubt all those repulsive qualities which are\nthe consequence of an habitual control over every generous emotion.\nBut, instead of viewing them with feelings of vengeance or abhorrence,\nFakredeen studied them unceasingly with a fine and profound\ninvestigation, and found in their society a deep psychological interest.\nHis own rapacious soul delighted to struggle with their rapine, and it\ncharmed him to baffle with his artifice their fraudulent dexterity. He\nloved to enter their houses with his glittering eye and face radiant\nwith innocence, and, when things were at the very worst and they\nremorseless, to succeed in circumventing them. In a certain sense, and\nto a certain degree, they were all his victims. True, they had gorged\nupon his rents and menaced his domains; but they had also advanced large\nsums, and he had so involved one with another in their eager appetite to\nprey upon his youth, and had so complicated the financial relations of\nthe Syrian coast in his own respect, that sometimes they tremblingly\ncalculated that the crash of Fakredeen must inevitably be the signal of\na general catastrophe.\n\nEven usurers have their weak side; some are vain, some envious;\nFakredeen knew how to titillate their self-love, or when to give them\nthe opportunity of immolating a rival. Then it was, when he had baffled\nand deluded them, or, with that fatal frankness of which he sometimes\nblushingly boasted, had betrayed some sacred confidence that shook\nthe credit of the whole coast from Scanderoon to Gaza, and embroiled\nindividuals whose existence depended on their mutual goodwill, that,\nlaughing like one of the blue-eyed hyenas of his forests, he galloped\naway to Canobia, and, calling for his nargileh, mused in chuckling\ncalculation over the prodigious sums he owed to them, formed whimsical\nand airy projects for his quittance, or delighted himself by brooding\nover the memory of some happy expedient or some daring feat of finance.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098What should I be without my debts?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he would sometimes exclaim; \u00e2\u0080\u0098dear\ncompanions of my life that never desert me! All my knowledge of human\nnature is owing to them: it is in managing my affairs that I have\nsounded the depths of the human heart, recognised all the combinations\nof human character, developed my own powers, and mastered the resources\nof others. What expedient in negotiation is unknown to me? What degree\nof endurance have I not calculated? What play of the countenance have\nI not observed? Yes, among my creditors, I have disciplined that\ndiplomatic ability that shall some day confound and control cabinets.\nO, my debts, I feel your presence like that of guardian angels! If I be\nlazy, you prick me to action; if elate, you subdue me to reflection;\nand thus it is that you alone can secure that continuous yet controlled\nenergy which conquers mankind.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nNotwithstanding all this, Fakredeen had grown sometimes a little wearied\neven of the choice excitement of pecuniary embarrassment. It was\ntoo often the same story, the adventures monotonous, the characters\nidentical. He had been plundered by every usurer in the Levant, and in\nturn had taken them in. He sometimes delighted his imagination by the\nidea of making them disgorge; that is to say, when he had established\nthat supremacy which he had resolved sooner or later to attain. Although\nhe never kept an account, his memory was so faithful that he knew\nexactly the amount of which he had been defrauded by every individual\nwith whom he had had transactions. He longed to mulct them, to\nthe service of the State, in the exact amount if their unhallowed\nappropriations. He was too good a statesman ever to confiscate; he\nconfined himself to taxation. Confiscation is a blunder that destroys\npublic credit: taxation, on the contrary, improves it, and both come to\nthe same thing.\n\nThat the proud soul of Tancred of Montacute, with its sublime\naspirations, its inexorable purpose, its empyrean ambition, should find\na votary in one apparently so whimsical, so worldly, and so worthless,\nmay at the first glance seem improbable; yet a nearer and finer\nexamination may induce us to recognise its likelihood. Fakredeen had\na brilliant imagination and a passionate sensibility; his heart was\ncontrolled by his taste, and, when that was pleased and satisfied, he\nwas capable of profound feeling and of earnest conduct. Moral worth\nhad no abstract charms for him, and he could sympathise with a dazzling\nreprobate; but virtue in an heroic form, lofty principle, and sovereign\nduty invested with all the attributes calculated to captivate his rapid\nand refined perception, exercised over him a resistless and transcendent\nspell. The deep and disciplined intelligence of Tancred, trained in all\nthe philosophy and cultured with all the knowledge of the West, acted\nwith magnetic power upon a consciousness the bright vivacity of which\nwas only equalled by its virgin ignorance of all that books can teach,\nand of those great conclusions which the studious hour can alone\nelaborate. Fakredeen hung upon his accents like a bee, while Tancred\npoured forth, without an effort, the treasures of his stored memory and\nlong musing mind. He went on, quite unconscious that his companion was\ndevoid of that previous knowledge, which, with all other persons, would\nhave been a preliminary qualification for a profitable comprehension of\nwhat he said. Fakredeen gave him no hint of this: the young Emir trusted\nto his quick perception to sustain him, although his literary training\nwas confined to an Arabic grammar, some sentences of wise men, some\nvolumes of poetry, and mainly and most profitably to the clever Courier\nde Smyrne, and occasionally a packet of French journals which he\nobtained from a Levantine consul.\n\nIt was therefore with a feeling not less than enthusiastic that\nFakredeen responded to the suggestive influence of Tancred. The want\nthat he had long suffered from was supplied, and the character he had\nlong mused over had appeared. Here was a vast theory to be reduced to\npractice, and a commanding mind to give the leading impulse. However\nimperfect may have been his general conception of the ideas of Tancred,\nhe clearly comprehended that their fulfilment involved his two great\nobjects, change and action. Compared with these attainments on a great\nscale, his present acquisition and position sank into nothingness. A\nfuturity consisting of a Syrian Emirate and a mountain castle figured as\nintolerable, and Fakredeen, hoping all things and prepared for anything,\nflung to the winds all consideration for his existing ties, whether in\nthe shape of domains or of debts.\n\nThe imperturbable repose, the grave and thoughtful daring, with which\nTancred developed his revolutionary projects, completed the power with\nwhich he could now dispose of the fate of the young Emir. Sometimes,\nin fluttering moments of disordered reverie, Fakredeen had indulged in\ndreams of what, with his present companion, it appeared was to be the\nordinary business of their lives, and which he discussed with a calm\nprecision which alone half convinced Fakredeen of their feasibility.\nIt was not for an impassioned votary to intimate a difficulty; but if\nFakredeen, to elicit an opinion, sometimes hinted an adverse suggestion,\nthe objection was swept away in an instant by an individual whose\ninflexible will was sustained by the conviction of divine favour.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLV.\n\n     _The People of Ansarey_\n\nDO YOU know anything of a people in the north of this country, called\nthe Ansarey?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 inquired Tancred of Baroni.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098No, my lord; and no one else. They hold the mountainous country about\nAntioch, and will let no one enter it; a very warlike race; they beat\nback the Egyptians; but Ibrahim Pasha loaded his artillery with piastres\nthe second time he attacked them, and they worked very well with the\nPasha after that.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 \u00e2\u0080\u0098Are they Moslemin?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098It is very easy to say what they are not, and that is about the extent\nof any knowledge that we have of them; they are not Moslemin, they\nare not Christians, they are not Druses, and they are not Jews, and\ncertainly they are not Guebres, for I have spoken of them to the Indians\nat Djedda, who are fire-worshippers, and they do not in any degree\nacknowledge them.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098And what is their race? Are they Arabs?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 \u00e2\u0080\u0098I should say not, my lord;\nfor the only one I ever saw was more like a Greek or an Armenian than a\nson of the desert.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098You have seen one of them?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098It was at Damascus: there was a city brawl, and M. de Sidonia saved the\nlife of a man, who turned out to be an Ansarey, though disguised. They\nhave secret agents at most of the Syrian cities. They speak Arabic; but\nI have heard M. de Sidonia say they have also a language of their own.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I wonder he did not visit them.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098The plague raged at Aleppo when we were there, and the Ansarey were\ndoubly rigid in their exclusion of all strangers from their country.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098And this Ansarey at Damascus, have you ever seen anything of him\nsince?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Yes; I have been at Damascus several times since I travelled with M. de\nSidonia, and I have sometimes smoked a nargileh with this man: his name\nis Dar-kush, and he deals in drugs.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nNow this was the reason that induced Tancred to inquire of Baroni\nrespecting the Ansarey. The day before, which was the third day of\nthe great hunting party at Canobia, Fakredeen and Tancred had found\nthemselves alone with Hamood Abuneked, and the lord of Canobia had\nthought it a good occasion to sound this powerful Sheikh of the Druses.\nHamood was rough, but frank and sincere. He was no enemy of the House\nof Shehaab; but the Abunekeds had suffered during the wars and civil\nconflicts which had of late years prevailed in Lebanon, and he was\nevidently disinclined to mix in any movement which was not well matured\nand highly promising of success. Fakredeen, of course, concealed his\nulterior purpose from the Druse, who associated with the idea of union\nbetween the two nations merely the institution of a sole government\nunder one head, and that head a Shehaab, probably dwelling at Canobia.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I have fought by the side of the Emir Bescheer,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Hamood, \u00e2\u0080\u0098and\nwould he were in his palace of Bteddeen at this moment! And the\nAbunekeds rode with the Emir Yousef against Djezzar. It is not the House\nof Abuneked that would say there should be two weak nations when there\nmight be one strong one. But what I say is sealed with the signet of\ntruth; it is known to the old, and it is remembered by the wise; the\nEmir Bescheer has said it to me as many times as there are oranges on\nthat tree, and the Emir Yousef has said it to my father. The northern\npasses are not guarded by Maronite or by Druse.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098And as long as they are not guarded by us?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Fakredeen,\ninquiringly.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098We may have a sole prince and a single government,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 continued Hamood,\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098and the houses of the two nations may be brothers, but every now and\nthen the Osmanli will enter the mountain, and we shall eat sand.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098And who holds the northern passes, noble Sheikh?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 inquired Tancred.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Truly, I believe,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 replied Hamood, \u00e2\u0080\u0098very sons of Eblis, for the whole\nof that country is in the hands of Ansarey, and there never has been\nevil in the mountain that they have not been against us.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098They never would draw with the Shehaabs,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Fakredeen; \u00e2\u0080\u0098and I have\nheard the Emir Bescheer say that, if the Ansarey had acted with him, he\nwould have baffled, in \u00e2\u0080\u009840, both the Porte and the Pasha.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098It was the same in the time of the Emir Yousef,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Sheikh Hamood.\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098They can bring twenty-five thousand picked men into the plain.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098And I suppose, if it were necessary, would not be afraid to meet the\nOsmanli in Anatoly?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Fakredeen.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098If the Turkmans or the Kurds would join them,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Sheikh Hamood,\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098there is nothing to prevent their washing their horses\u00e2\u0080\u0099 feet in the\nBosphorus.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098It is strange,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Fakredeen, \u00e2\u0080\u0098but frequently as I have been at\nAleppo and Antioch, I have never been in their country. I have always\nbeen warned against it, always kept from it, which indeed ought to have\nprompted my earliest efforts, when I was my own master, to make them\na visit. But, I know not how it is, there are some prejudices that do\nstick to one. I have a prejudice against the Ansarey, a sort of fear, a\nkind of horror. \u00e2\u0080\u0098Tis vastly absurd. I suppose my nurse instilled it into\nme, and frightened me with them when I would not sleep. Besides, I had\nan idea that they particularly hated the Shehaabs. I recollect so well\nthe Emir Bescheer, at Bteddeen, bestowing endless imprecations on them.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098He made many efforts to win them, though,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Sheikh Hamood, \u00e2\u0080\u0098and so\ndid the Emir Yousef.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098And you think without them, noble Sheikh,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Tancred, \u00e2\u0080\u0098that Syria is\nnot secure?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I think, with them and peace with the desert, that Syria might defy\nTurk and Egyptian.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098And carry the war into the enemy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s quarters, if necessary?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said\nFakredeen.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098If they would let us alone, I am content to leave them,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Hamood.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Hem!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said the Emir Fakredeen. \u00e2\u0080\u0098Do you see that gazelle, noble Sheikh?\nHow she bounds along! What if we follow her, and the pursuit should lead\nus into the lands of the Ansarey?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098It would be a long ride,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Sheikh Hamood. \u00e2\u0080\u0098Nor should I care much\nto trust my head in a country governed by a woman.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098A woman!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 exclaimed Tancred and Fakredeen.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098They say as much,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Sheikh Hamood; \u00e2\u0080\u0098perhaps it is only a\ncoffee-house tale.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I never heard it before,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Fakredeen. \u00e2\u0080\u0098In the time of my uncle,\nElderidis was Sheikh. I have heard indeed that the Ansarey worship a\nwoman.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Then they would be Christians,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Sheikh Hamood, \u00e2\u0080\u0098and I never heard\nthat.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLVI.\n\n     _The Laurellas_\n\nIT WAS destined that Napoleon should never enter Rome, and Mahomet never\nenter Damascus. What was the reason of this? They were not uninterested\nin those cities that interest all. The Emperor selected from the capital\nof the C\u00c3\u00a6sars the title of his son; the Prophet, when he beheld the\ncrown of Syria, exclaimed that it was too delightful, and that he must\nreserve his paradise for another world. Buonaparte was an Italian, and\nmust have often yearned after the days of Rome triumphant. The son of\nAbdallah was descended from the patriarchs, whose progenitor had been\nmoulded out of the red clay of the most ancient city in the world.\nAbsorbed by the passionate pursuit of the hour, the two heroes postponed\na gratification which they knew how to appreciate, but which, with all\ntheir success, all their power, and all their fame, they were never\npermitted to indulge. What moral is to be drawn from this circumstance?\nThat we should never lose an occasion. Opportunity is more powerful even\nthan conquerors and prophets.\n\nThe most ancient city of the world has no antiquity. This flourishing\nabode is older than many ruins, yet it does not possess one single\nmemorial of the past. In vain has it conquered or been conquered. Not a\ntrophy, a column, or an arch, records its warlike fortunes. Temples have\nbeen raised here to unknown gods and to revealed Divinity; all have been\nswept away. Not the trace of a palace or a prison, a public bath, a hall\nof justice, can be discovered in this wonderful city, where everything\nhas been destroyed, and where nothing has decayed.\n\nMen moralise among ruins, or, in the throng and tumult of successful\ncities, recall past visions of urban desolation for prophetic warning.\nLondon is a modern Babylon; Paris has aped imperial Rome, and may share\nits catastrophe. But what do the sages say to Damascus? It had municipal\nrights in the days when God conversed with Abraham. Since then, the\nkings of the great monarchies have swept over it; and the Greek and the\nRoman, the Tartar, the Arab, and the Turk have passed through its walls;\nyet it still exists and still flourishes; is full of life, wealth,\nand enjoyment. Here is a city that has quaffed the magical elixir and\nsecured the philosopher\u00e2\u0080\u0099s stone, that is always young and always rich.\nAs yet, the disciples of progress have not been able exactly to match\nthis instance of Damascus, but it is said that they have great faith in\nthe future of Birkenhead.\n\nWe moralise among ruins: it is always when the game is played that we\ndiscover the cause of the result. It is a fashion intensely European,\nthe habit of an organisation that, having little imagination, takes\nrefuge in reason, and carefully locks the door when the steed is stolen.\nA community has crumbled to pieces, and it is always accounted for by\nits political forms, or its religious modes. There has been a deficiency\nin what is called checks in the machinery of government; the definition\nof the suffrage has not been correct; what is styled responsibility has,\nby some means or other, not answered; or, on the other hand, people have\nbelieved too much or too little in a future state, have been too much\nengrossed by the present, or too much absorbed in that which was to\ncome. But there is not a form of government which Damascus has not\nexperienced, excepting the representative, and not a creed which it has\nnot acknowledged, excepting the Protestant. Yet, deprived of the only\nrule and the only religion that are right, it is still justly described\nby the Arabian poets as a pearl surrounded by emeralds.\n\nYes, the rivers of Damascus still run and revel within and without the\nwalls, of which the steward of Sheikh Abraham was a citizen. They have\nencompassed them with gardens, and filled them with fountains. They\ngleam amid their groves of fruit, wind through their vivid meads,\nsparkle-among perpetual flowers, gush from the walls, bubble in the\ncourtyards, dance and carol in the streets: everywhere their joyous\nvoices, everywhere their glancing forms, filling the whole world around\nwith freshness, and brilliancy, and fragrance, and life. One might\nfancy, as we track them in their dazzling course, or suddenly making\ntheir appearance in every spot and in every scene, that they were\nthe guardian spirits of the city. You have explained them, says the\nutilitarian, the age and flourishing fortunes of Damascus: they arise\nfrom its advantageous situation; it is well supplied with water.\n\nIs it better supplied than the ruins of contiguous regions? Did the Nile\nsave Thebes? Did the Tigris preserve Nineveh? Did the Euphrates secure\nBabylon?\n\nOur scene lies in a chamber vast and gorgeous. The reader must imagine a\nhall, its form that of a rather long square, but perfectly proportioned.\nIts coved roof, glowing with golden and scarlet tints, is highly carved\nin the manner of the Saracens, such as we may observe in the palaces\nof Moorish Spain and in the Necropolis of the Mamlouk Sultans at Cairo,\ndeep recesses of honeycomb work, with every now and then pendants of\ndaring grace hanging like stalactites from some sparry cavern. This roof\nis supported by columns of white marble, fashioned in the shape of palm\ntrees, the work of Italian artists, and which forms arcades around the\nchamber. Beneath these arcades runs a noble divan of green and silver\nsilk, and the silken panels of the arabesque walls have been covered\nwith subjects of human interest by the finest artists of Munich. The\nmarble floor, with its rich mosaics, was also the contribution of\nItalian genius, though it was difficult at the present moment to trace\nits varied, graceful, and brilliant designs, so many were the sumptuous\ncarpets, the couches, sofas, and cushions that were spread about it.\nThere were indeed throughout the chamber many indications of furniture,\nwhich are far from usual even among the wealthiest and most refined\nOrientals: Indian tables, vases of china, and baskets of agate and\nporcelain filled with flowers. From one side, the large Saracenic\nwindows of this saloon, which were not glazed, but covered only when\nrequired by curtains of green and silver silk, now drawn aside, looked\non a garden; vistas of quivering trees, broad parterres of flowers,\nand everywhere the gleam of glittering fountains, which owned, however,\nfealty to the superior stream that bubbled in the centre of the saloon,\nwhere four negroes, carved in black marble, poured forth its refreshing\nwaters from huge shells of pearl, into the vast circle of a jasper\nbasin.\n\nAt this moment the chamber was enlivened by the presence of many\nindividuals. Most of these were guests; one was the master of the\ncolumns and the fountains; a man much above the middle height, though as\nwell proportioned as his sumptuous hall; admirably handsome, for beauty\nand benevolence blended in the majestic countenance of Adam Besso.\nTo-day his Syrian robes were not unworthy of his palace; the cream-white\nshawl that encircled his brow with its ample folds was so fine that the\nmerchant who brought it to him carried it over the ocean and the desert\nin the hollow shell of a pomegranate. In his girdle rested a handjar,\nthe sheath of which was of a rare and vivid enamel, and the hilt\nentirely of brilliants.\n\nA slender man of middle size, who, as he stood by Besso, had a\ndiminutive appearance, was in earnest conversation with his host. This\npersonage was adorned with more than one order, and dressed in the Frank\nuniform of one of the Great Powers, though his head was shaven, for\nhe wore a tarboush or red cap, although no turban. This gentleman was\nSignor Elias de Laurella, a wealthy Hebrew merchant at Damascus, and\nAustrian consul-general _ad honorem_; a great man, almost as celebrated\nfor his diplomatic as for his mercantile abilities; a gentleman who\nunderstood the Eastern question; looked up to for that, but still more,\nin that he was the father of the two prettiest girls in the Levant.\n\nThe Mesdemoiselles de Laurella, Th\u00c3\u00a9r\u00c3\u00a8se and Sophonisbe, had just\ncompleted their education, partly at Smyrna, the last year at\nMarseilles. This had quite turned their heads; they had come back with a\ncontempt for Syria, the bitterness of which was only veiled by the high\nstyle of European nonchalance, of which they had a supreme command, and\nwhich is, perhaps, our only match for Eastern repose. The Mesdemoiselles\nde Laurella were highly accomplished, could sing quite ravishingly,\npaint fruits and flowers, and drop to each other, before surrounding\nsavages, mysterious allusions to feats in ballrooms, which, alas! no\nlonger could be achieved. They signified, and in some degree solaced,\ntheir intense disgust at their present position by a haughty and\namusingly impassable demeanour, which meant to convey their superiority\nto all surrounding circumstances. One of their favourite modes of\nasserting this pre-eminence was wearing the Frank dress, which their\nfather only did officially, and which no female member of their family\nhad ever assumed, though Damascus swarmed with Laurellas. Nothing in the\ndreams of Madame Carson, or Madame Camille, or Madame Devey, nothing in\nthe blazoned pages of the Almanachs des Dames and Belle Assembl\u00c3\u00a9e, ever\napproached the Mdlles. Laurella, on a day of festival. It was the acme.\nNothing could be conceived beyond it; nobody could equal it. It was\ntaste exaggerated, if that be possible; fashion baffling pursuit, if\nthat be permitted. It was a union of the highest moral and material\nqualities; the most sublime contempt and the stiffest cambric. Figure to\nyourself, in such habiliments, two girls, of the same features, the\nsame form, the same size, but of different colour: a nose turned up, but\nchoicely moulded, large eyes, and richly fringed; fine hair, beautiful\nlips and teeth, but the upper lip and the cheek bones rather too long\nand high, and the general expression of the countenance, when not\naffected, more sprightly than intelligent. Th\u00c3\u00a9r\u00c3\u00a8se was a brunette,\nbut her eye wanted softness as much as the blue orb of the brilliant\nSophonisbe. Nature and Art had combined to produce their figures, and it\nwas only the united effort of two such first-rate powers that could have\ncreated anything so admirable.\n\nThis was the first visit of the Mesdemoiselles Laurella to the family\nof Besso, for they had only returned from Marseilles at the beginning\nof the year, and their host had not resided at Damascus until the summer\nwas much advanced. Of course they were well acquainted by reputation\nwith the great Hebrew house of which the lord of the mansion was the\nchief. They had been brought up to esteem it the main strength and\nornament of their race and religion. But the Mesdemoiselles Laurella\nwere ashamed of their race, and not fanatically devoted to their\nreligion, which might be true, but certainly was not fashionable.\nTh\u00c3\u00a9r\u00c3\u00a8se, who was of a less sanguineous temperament than her sister,\naffected despair and unutterable humiliation, which permitted her to\nsay before her own people a thousand disagreeable things with an air of\nartless frankness. The animated Sophonisbe, on the contrary, was always\ncombating prejudice, felt persuaded that the Jews would not be so much\ndisliked if they were better known; that all they had to do was to\nimitate as closely as possible the habits and customs of the nation\namong whom they chanced to live; and she really did believe that\neventually, such was the progressive spirit of the age, a difference\nin religion would cease to be regarded, and that a respectable Hebrew,\nparticularly if well dressed and well mannered, might be able to\npass through society without being discovered, or at least noticed.\nConsummation of the destiny of the favourite people of the Creator of\nthe universe!\n\nNotwithstanding their practised nonchalance, the Mesdemoiselles Laurella\nwere a little subdued when they entered the palace of Besso, still more\nso when they were presented to its master, whose manner, void of all\nart, yet invested with a natural dignity, asserted in an instant its\nsuperiority. Eva, whom they saw for the first time, received them like\na queen, and in a dress which offered as complete a contrast to their\nmodish attire as the beauty of her sublime countenance presented to\ntheir pretty and sparkling visages.\n\nMadame Laurella, the mother of these young ladies, would in Europe have\nbeen still styled young. She was a Smyrniote, and had been a celebrated\nbeauty. The rose had since then too richly expanded, but even now, with\nher dark eyelash charged with yamusk, her cheek touched with rouge, and\nher fingers tipped with henna, her still fine hair exaggerated by art\nor screened by her jewelled turban, she would have been a striking\npersonage, even if it had not been for the blaze of jewels with\nwhich she was suffused and environed. The existence of this lady was\nconcentred in her precious gems. An extreme susceptibility on this head\nis very prevalent among the ladies of the Levant, and the quantity\nof jewels that they accumulate far exceeds the general belief. Madame\nLaurella was without a rival in this respect, and resolved to maintain\nher throne; diamonds alone did not satisfy her; immense emeralds, rubies\nas big as pigeons\u00e2\u0080\u0099 eggs, prodigious ropes of pearls, were studded and\nwound about every part of her rich robes. Every finger glittered,\nand bracelets flashed beneath her hanging sleeves. She sat in silent\nsplendour on a divan, now and then proudly moving a fan of feathers,\nlost in criticism of the jewels of her friends, and in contemplation of\nher own.\n\nA young man, tall and well-looking, dressed as an Oriental, but with an\naffected, jerking air, more French than Syrian, moved jauntily about\nthe room, speaking to several persons for a short time, shrugging\nhis shoulders and uttering commonplaces as if they were poignant\noriginalities. This was Hillel Besso, the eldest son of the Besso of\nAleppo, and the intended husband of Eva. Hillel, too, had seen the\nworld, passed a season at Pera, where he had worn the Frank dress, and,\nintroduced into the circles by the lady of the Austrian Internuncio,\nhad found success and enjoyed himself. He had not, however, returned\nto Syria with any of the disgust shared by the Mesdemoiselles Laurella.\nHillel was neither ashamed of his race nor his religion: on the\ncontrary, he was perfectly satisfied with this life, with the family\nof Besso in general, and with himself particularly. Hillel was a little\nphilosophical, had read Voltaire, and, free from prejudices, conceived\nhimself capable of forming correct opinions. He listened smiling and in\nsilence to Eva asserting the splendour and superiority of their race,\nand sighing for the restoration of their national glory, and then\nwould say, in a whisper to a friend, and with a glance of epigrammatic\nairiness, \u00e2\u0080\u0098For my part, I am not so sure that we were ever better off\nthan we are.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nHe stopped and conversed with Th\u00c3\u00a9r\u00c3\u00a8se Laurella, who at first was\nunbending, but when she found that he was a Besso, and had listened to\none or two anecdotes which indicated personal acquaintance not only\nwith ambassadors but with ambassadors\u00e2\u0080\u0099 ladies, she began to relax. In\ngeneral, however, the rest of the ladies did not speak, or made only\nobservations to each other in a hushed voice. Conversation is not the\naccomplishment of these climes and circles. They seemed content to\nshow their jewels to their neighbours. There was a very fat lady, of\nprodigious size, the wife of Signor Yacoub Picholoroni, who was also a\nconsul, but not a consul-general _in honorem_. She looked like a huge\nChinese idol; a perpetual smile played upon her immense good-natured\ncheeks, and her little black eyes twinkled with continuous satisfaction.\nThere were the Mourad Farhis and the Nas-sim Farhis. There were Moses\nLaurella and his wife, who shone with the reflected splendour of the\ngreat Laurellas, but who were really very nice people; sensible and most\nobliging, as all travellers must have found them. Moses Laurella was\nvice-consul to his brother. The Farhis had no diplomatic lustre, but\nthey were great merchants, and worked with the House of Besso in all\ntheir enterprises. They had married two sisters, who were also their\ncousins. Madame Mourad Farhi was in the zenith of her renowned beauty;\nin the gorgeous Smyrniote style, brilliant yet languid, like a panther\nbasking in the sunshine. Her sister also had a rich countenance, and\na figure like a palm tree, while her fine brow beamed alike with\nintelligence and beauty. Madame, Nassim was highly cultured,\nenthusiastic for her race, and proud of the friendship of Eva, of which\nshe was worthy.\n\nThere were also playing about the room three or four children of such\ndazzling beauty and such ineffable grace that no pen can picture their\nseraphic glances or gestures of airy frolic. Sometimes serious, from\nexhaustion not from thought; sometimes wild with the witchery of infant\nriot; a laughing girl with hair almost touching the ground, and large\ngrey eyes bedewed with lustrous mischief, tumbles over an urchin who\nrises doubtful whether to scream or shout; sometimes they pull the\nrobe of Besso while he talks, who goes on, as if unconscious of the\ninterruption; sometimes they rush up to their mother or Eva for an\nembrace; sometimes they run up to the fat lady, look with wondering\ngravity in her face, and then, bursting into laughter, scud away. These\nare the children of a sister of Hillel Besso, brought to Damascus for\nchange of air. Their mother is also here, sitting at the side of Eva: a\nsoft and pensive countenance, watching the children with her intelligent\nblue eyes, or beckoning to them with a beautiful hand.\n\nThe men in general remained on their legs apart, conversing as if they\nwere on the Bourse.\n\nNow entered, from halls beyond of less dimensions, but all decorated\nwith similar splendour, a train of servants, two of whom carried between\nthem a large broad basket of silver filigree, filled with branches of\nthe palm tree entwined with myrtle, while another bore a golden basket\nof a different shape, and which was filled with citrons just gathered.\nThese they handed to the guests, and each guest took a branch with the\nright hand and a citron with the left. The conversation of Besso with\nElias Laurella had been broken by their entrance, and a few minutes\nafterwards, the master of the house, looking about, held up his branch,\nshook it with a rustling sound, and immediately Eva was at his side.\n\nThe daughter of Besso wore a vest of white silk, fitting close to her\nshape and descending to her knees; it was buttoned with large diamonds\nand restrained by a girdle of pearls; anklets of brilliants peeped\nalso, every now and then, from beneath her large Mamlouk trousers of\nrose-coloured silk that fell over her slippers, powdered with diamonds.\nOver her vest she wore the Syrian jacket, made of cherry-coloured\nvelvet, its open arms and back richly embroidered, though these were\nnow much concealed by her outer pelisse, a brocade of India, massy with\ngold, and yet relieved from heaviness by the brilliancy of its light\nblue tint and the dazzling fantasy of its pattern. This was loosely\nbound round her waist by a Moorish scarf of the colour of a blood-red\norange, and bordered with a broad fringe of precious stones. Her\nhead-dress was of the same fashion as when we first met her in the kiosk\nof Bethany, except that, on this occasion, her Syrian cap on the back\nof her head was covered only with diamonds, and only with diamonds was\nbraided her long dark hair.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098They will never come,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Besso to his daughter. \u00e2\u0080\u0098It was one of his\nfreaks. We will not wait.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I am sure, my father, they will come,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Eva, earnestly. And indeed,\nat this very moment, as she stood at his side, holding in one hand her\npalm branch, which was reposing on her bosom, and in the other her fresh\ncitron, the servants appeared again, ushering in two guests who had just\narrived. One was quite a stranger, a young man dressed in the European\nfashion; the other was recognised at once by all present as the Emir of\nCanobia.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLVII.\n\n     _The Feast of Tabernacles_\n\nEVA had withdrawn from her father to her former remote position, the\nmoment that she had recognised the two friends, and was, therefore,\nnot in hearing when her father received them, and said, \u00e2\u0080\u0098Welcome, noble\nstranger! the noble Emir here, to whom a thousand welcomes, told me that\nyou would not be averse from joining a festival of my people.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I would seize any opportunity to pay my respects to you,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 replied\nTancred; \u00e2\u0080\u0098but this occasion is most agreeable to me.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098And when, noble traveller, did you arrive at Esh Sham?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098But this morning; we were last from Hasbeya.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Tancred then inquired\nafter Eva, and Besso led him to his daughter.\n\nIn the meantime the arrival of the new guests made a considerable\nsensation in the chamber, especially with the Mesdemoiselles Laurella. A\nyoung prince of the Lebanon, whatever his religion, was a distinguished\nand agreeable accession to their circle, but in Tancred they recognised\na being at once civilised and fashionable, a Christian who could dance\nthe polka. Refreshing as springs in the desert to their long languishing\neyes were the sight of his white cravat and his boots of Parisian\npolish.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098It is one of our great national festivals,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Eva, slightly waving\nher palm branch; \u00e2\u0080\u0098the celebration of the Hebrew vintage, the Feast of\nTabernacles.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nThe vineyards of Israel have ceased to exist, but the eternal law\nenjoins the children of Israel still to celebrate the vintage. A race\nthat persist in celebrating their vintage, although they have no fruits\nto gather, will regain their vineyards. What sublime inexorability in\nthe law! But what indomitable spirit in the people!\n\nIt is easy for the happier Sephardim, the Hebrews who have never quitted\nthe sunny regions that are laved by the Midland Ocean; it is easy for\nthem, though they have lost their heritage, to sympathise, in their\nbeautiful Asian cities or in their Moorish and Arabian gardens, with the\ngraceful rights that are, at least, an homage to a benignant nature.\nBut picture to yourself the child of Israel in the dingy suburb or the\nsqualid quarter of some bleak northern town, where there is never a sun\nthat can at any rate ripen grapes. Yet he must celebrate the vintage\nof purple Palestine! The law has told him, though a denizen in an icy\nclime, that he must dwell for seven days in a bower, and that he must\nbuild it of the boughs of thick trees; and the Rabbins have told him\nthat these thick trees are the palm, the myrtle, and the weeping willow.\nEven Sarmatia may furnish a weeping willow. The law has told him that\nhe must pluck the fruit of goodly trees, and the Rabbins have explained\nthat goodly fruit on this occasion is confined to the citron. Perhaps,\nin his despair, he is obliged to fly to the candied delicacies of\nthe grocer. His mercantile connections will enable him, often at\nconsiderable cost, to procure some palm leaves from Canaan, which he\nmay wave in his synagogue while he exclaims, as the crowd did when the\nDivine descendant of David entered Jerusalem, \u00e2\u0080\u0098Hosanna in the highest!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nThere is something profoundly interesting in this devoted observance\nof Oriental customs in the heart of our Saxon and Sclavonian cities; in\nthese descendants of the Bedouins, who conquered Canaan more than three\nthousand years ago, still celebrating that success which secured their\nforefathers, for the first time, grapes and wine.\n\nConceive a being born and bred in the Judenstrasse of Hamburg or\nFrankfort, or rather in the purlieus of our Houndsditch or Minories,\nborn to hereditary insult, without any education, apparently without a\ncircumstance that can develop the slightest taste, or cherish the least\nsentiment for the beautiful, living amid fogs and filth, never treated\nwith kindness, seldom with justice, occupied with the meanest, if\nnot the vilest, toil, bargaining for frippery, speculating in usury,\nexisting for ever under the concurrent influence of degrading causes\nwhich would have worn out, long ago, any race that was not of the\nunmixed blood of Caucasus, and did not adhere to the laws of Moses;\nconceive such a being, an object to you of prejudice, dislike, disgust,\nperhaps hatred. The season arrives, and the mind and heart of that being\nare filled with images and passions that have been ranked in all ages\namong the most beautiful and the most genial of human experience; filled\nwith a subject the most vivid, the most graceful, the most joyous, and\nthe most exuberant; a subject which has inspired poets, and which has\nmade gods; the harvest of the grape in the native regions of the Vine.\n\nHe rises in the morning, goes early to some White-chapel market,\npurchases some willow boughs for which he has previously given\na commission, and which are brought, probably, from one of the\nneighbouring rivers of Essex, hastens home, cleans out the yard of his\nmiserable tenement, builds his bower, decks it, even profusely, with the\nfinest flowers and fruits that he can procure, the myrtle and the citron\nnever forgotten, and hangs its roof with variegated lamps. After the\nservice of his synagogue, he sups late with his wife and his children in\nthe open air, as if he were in the pleasant villages of Galilee, beneath\nits sweet and starry sky.\n\nPerhaps, as he is giving the Keedush, the Hebrew blessing to the Hebrew\nmeal, breaking and distributing the bread, and sanctifying, with a\npreliminary prayer, the goblet of wine he holds, the very ceremony which\nthe Divine Prince of Israel, nearly two thousand years ago, adopted\nat the most memorable of all repasts, and eternally invested with\neucharistic grace; or, perhaps, as he is offering up the peculiar\nthanksgiving of the Feast of Tabernacles, praising Jehovah for the\nvintage which his children may no longer cull, but also for His promise\nthat they may some day again enjoy it, and his wife and his children are\njoining in a pious Hosanna, that is, Save us! a party of Anglo-Saxons,\nvery respectable men, ten-pounders, a little elevated it may be, though\ncertainly not in honour of the vintage, pass the house, and words like\nthese are heard:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I say, Buggins, what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s that row?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Oh! it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s those cursed Jews! we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve a lot of \u00e2\u0080\u0098em here. It is one of their\nhorrible feasts. The Lord Mayor ought to interfere. However, things are\nnot as bad as they used to be: they used always to crucify little boys\nat these hullabaloos, but now they only eat sausages made of stinking\npork.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098To be sure,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 replies his companion, \u00e2\u0080\u0098we all make progress.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nIn the meantime, a burst of music sounds from the gardens of Besso of\nDamascus. He advances, and invites Tancred and the Emir to follow\nhim, and, without any order or courtesy to the softer sex, who, on\nthe contrary, follow in the rear, the whole company step out of the\nSaracenic windows into the gardens. The mansion of Besso, which was\nof great extent, appeared to be built in their midst. No other roof or\nbuilding was in any direction visible, yet the house was truly in the\nmiddle of the city, and the umbrageous plane trees alone produced that\nillimitable air which is always so pleasing and effective. The house,\nthough lofty for an eastern mansion, was only one story in height, yet\nits front was covered with an external and double staircase. This, after\na promenade in the garden, the guests approached and mounted. It led\nto the roof or terrace of the house, which was of great size, an oblong\nsquare, and which again was a garden. Myrtle trees of a considerable\nheight, and fragrant with many flowers, were arranged in close order\nalong the four sides of this roof, forming a barrier which no eye from\nthe city beneath or any neighbouring terrace could penetrate. This\nverdant bulwark, however, opened at each corner of the roof, which was\noccupied by a projecting pavilion of white marble, a light cupola of\nchequered carving supported by wreathed columns. From these pavilions\nthe most charming views might be obtained of the city and the\nsurrounding country: Damascus, itself a varied mass of dark green\ngroves, white minarets, bright gardens, and hooded domes; to the south\nand east, at the extremity of its rich plain, the glare of the desert;\nto the west the ranges of the Lebanon; while the city was backed on the\nnorth by other mountain regions which Tancred had not yet penetrated.\n\nIn the centre of the terrace was a temporary structure of a peculiar\ncharacter. It was nearly forty feet long, half as many broad, and\nproportionately lofty. Twelve palm trees clustering with ripe fruit,\nand each of which seemed to spring from a flowering hedge of myrtles,\nsupported a roof formed with much artifice of the braided boughs of\ntrees. These, however, only furnished an invisible framework, from\nwhich were suspended the most beautiful and delicious fruits, citron and\npomegranate, orange, and fig, and banana, and melon, in such thickness\nand profusion that they formed, as it were, a carved ceiling of rich\nshades and glowing colours, like the Saracenic ceiling of the mansion,\nwhile enormous bunches of grapes every now and then descended like\npendants from the main body of the roof. The spaces between the palm\ntrees were filled with a natural trellis-work of orange trees in fruit\nand blossom, leaving at intervals arches of entrance, whose form was\nindicated by bunches of the sweetest and rarest flowers.\n\nWithin was a banqueting-table covered with thick white damask silk,\nwith a border of gold about a foot in breadth, and before each guest was\nplaced a napkin of the same fashion. The table, however, lacked none\nof the conveniences and luxuries and even ornaments of Europe. What\ncan withstand the united influence of taste, wealth, and commerce? The\nchoicest porcelain of France, golden goblets chiselled in Bond Street,\nand the prototypes of which had perhaps been won at Goodwood or Ascot,\nmingled with the rarest specimens of the glass of Bohemia, while the\ntriumphant blades of Sheffield flashed in that very Syrian city whose\nskill in cutlery had once been a proverb. Around the table was a divan\nof amber-coloured satin with many cushions, so arranged that the\nguests might follow either the Oriental or the European mode of seating\nthemselves. Such was the bower or tabernacle of Besso of Damascus,\nprepared to celebrate the seventh day of his vintage feast.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLVIII.\n\n     _Eva\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Affianced Bridegroom_\n\nWE OUGHT to have met at Jerusalem,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Tancred to Besso, on whose\nright hand he was seated, \u00e2\u0080\u0098but I am happy to thank you for all\nyour kindness, even at Damascus.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 \u00e2\u0080\u0098My daughter tells me you are not\nuninterested in our people, which is the reason I ventured to ask you\nhere.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I cannot comprehend how a Christian can be uninterested in a people who\nhave handed down to him immortal truths.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098All the world is not as sensible of the obligation as yourself, noble\ntraveller.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098But who are the world? Do you mean the inhabitants of Europe, which is\na forest not yet cleared; or the inhabitants of Asia, which is a ruin\nabout to tumble?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098The railroads will clear the forest,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Besso. \u00e2\u0080\u0098And what is to\nbecome of the ruin?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 asked Tancred.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098God will not forget His land.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 \u00e2\u0080\u0098That is the truth; the government of\nthis globe must be divine, and the impulse can only come from Asia.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098If your government only understood the Eastern question!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Mr.\nConsul-General Laurella, pricking up his ears at some half phrase that\nhe had caught, and addressing Tancred across the table. \u00e2\u0080\u0098It is more\nsimple than you imagine, and before you return to England to take\nyour seat in your Parliament, I should be very happy to have some\nconversation with you.\n\nI think I could tell you some things----\u00e2\u0080\u0099 and he gave a glance of\ndiplomatic mystery. Tancred bowed.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098For my part,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Hillel Besso, shrugging his shoulders, and speaking\nin an airy tone, \u00e2\u0080\u0098it seems to me that your Eastern question is a great\nimbroglio that only exists in the cabinets of diplomatists. Why should\nthere be any Eastern question? All is very well as it is. At least we\nmight be worse: I think we might be worse.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I am so happy to find myself once more among you,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 whispered Fakredeen\nto his neighbour, Madame Mourad Farhi. \u00e2\u0080\u0098This is my real home.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098All here must be happy and honoured to see you, too, noble Emir.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098And the good Signor Mourad: I am afraid I am not a favourite of his?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\npursued Fakredeen, meditating a loan.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I never heard my husband speak of you, noble Emir, but with the\ngreatest consideration.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098There is no man I respect so much,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Fakredeen; \u00e2\u0080\u0098no one in whom I\nhave such a thorough confidence. Excepting our dear host, who is really\nmy father, there is no one on whose judgment I would so implicitly rely.\nTell him all that, my dear Madame Mourad, for I wish him to respect me.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I admire his hair so much,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 whispered Th\u00c3\u00a9r\u00c3\u00a8se Laurella, in an audible\nvoice to her sister, across the broad form of the ever-smiling Madame\nPicholoroni. \u00e2\u0080\u0098Tis such a relief after our dreadful turbans.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098And his costume, so becoming! I wonder how any civilised being can\nwear the sort of things we see about us. \u00e2\u0080\u0098Tis really altogether like a\nwardrobe of the Com\u00c3\u00a9die.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Well, Sophonisbe,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said the sensible Moses Laurella, \u00e2\u0080\u0098I admire the\nFranks very much; they have many qualities which I could wish our\nLevantines shared; but I confess that I do not think that their strong\npoint is their costume.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Oh, my dear uncle!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Th\u00c3\u00a9r\u00c3\u00a8se; \u00e2\u0080\u0098look at that beautiful white cravat.\nWhat have we like it? So simple, so distinguished! Such good taste! And\nthen the boots. Think of our dreadful slippers! powdered with pearls\nand all sorts of trash of that kind, by the side of that lovely French\npolish.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098He must be terribly _ennuy\u00c3\u00a9_ here,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Th\u00c3\u00a9r\u00c3\u00a8se to Sophonisbe, with a\nlook of the initiated.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Indeed, I should think so: no balls, not an opera; I quite pity him.\nWhat could have induced him to come here?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I should think he must be attached to some one,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Th\u00c3\u00a9r\u00c3\u00a8se: \u00e2\u0080\u0098he\nlooks unhappy.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098There is not a person near him with whom he can have an idea in\ncommon.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Except Mr. Hillel Besso,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Th\u00c3\u00a9r\u00c3\u00a8se. \u00e2\u0080\u0098He appears to be quite\nenlightened. I spoke to him a little before dinner. He has been a winter\nat Pera, and went to all the balls.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Lord Palmerston understood the Eastern question to a certain degree,\u00e2\u0080\u0099\nsaid Mr. Consul-General Laurella; \u00e2\u0080\u0098but, had I been in the service of\nthe Queen of England, I could have told him some things;\u00e2\u0080\u0099 and he\nmysteriously paused.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I cannot endure this eternal chatter about Palmerston,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said the Emir,\nrather pettishly. \u00e2\u0080\u0098Are there no other statesmen in the world besides\nPalmerston? And what should he know about the Eastern question, who\nnever was in the East?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Ah, noble Emir, these are questions of the high diplomacy. They cannot\nbe treated unless by the cabinets which have traditions.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I could settle the Eastern question in a month, if I were disposed,\u00e2\u0080\u0099\nsaid Fakredeen.\n\nMr. Consul-General Laurella smiled superciliously, and then said, \u00e2\u0080\u0098But\nthe question is, what is the Eastern question?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098For my part,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Hillel Besso, in a most epigrammatic manner, \u00e2\u0080\u0098I do\nnot see the use of settling anything.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098The Eastern question is, who shall govern the Mediterranean?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said the\nEmir. \u00e2\u0080\u0098There are only two powers who can do it: Egypt and Syria. As for\nthe English, the Russians, the Franks, your friends the Austrians, they\nare strangers. They come, and they will go; but Syria and Egypt will\nalways remain.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Egypt has tried, and failed.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Then let Syria try, and succeed.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Do you visit Egypt before you return from the East, noble sir?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 asked\nBesso, of Tancred.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I have not thought of my return; but I should not be sorry to visit\nEgypt. It is a country that rather perplexes us in Europe. It has\nundergone great changes.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nBesso shook his head, and slightly smiled.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Egypt,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said he, \u00e2\u0080\u0098never changes. \u00e2\u0080\u0098Tis the same land as in the days of\nthe Pharaohs: governed on their principles of political economy, with a\nHebrew for prime minister.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098A Hebrew for prime minister!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Even so: Artim Bey, the present prime minister of Egypt, formerly\nthe Pasha\u00e2\u0080\u0099s envoy at Paris, and by far the best political head in the\nLevant, is not only the successor but the descendant of Joseph.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098He must be added then to your friend M. de Sidonia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s list of living\nHebrew statesmen,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Tancred.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098We have our share of the government of the world,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Besso.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098It seems to me that you govern every land except your own.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098That might have been done in \u00e2\u0080\u009839,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Besso musingly; \u00e2\u0080\u0098but why speak\nof a subject which can little interest you?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Can little interest me!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 exclaimed Tancred. \u00e2\u0080\u0098What other subject should\ninterest me? More than six centuries ago, the government of that land\ninterested my ancestor, and he came here to achieve it.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nThe stars were shining before they quitted the Arabian tabernacle of\nBesso. The air was just as soft as a sweet summer English noon, and\nquite as still. The pavilions of the terrace and the surrounding bowers\nwere illuminated by the varying tints of a thousand lamps. Bright\ncarpets and rich cushions were thrown about for those who cared to\nrecline; the brothers Farhi, for example, and indeed most of the men,\nsmoking inestimable nargilehs. The Consul-General Laurella begged\npermission to present Lord Montacute to his daughters Th\u00c3\u00a9r\u00c3\u00a8se and\nSophonisbe, who, resolved to show to him that Damascus was not\naltogether so barbarous as he deemed it, began talking of new dances and\nthe last opera. Tancred would have found great difficulty in sustaining\nhis part in the conversation, had not the young ladies fortunately been\nrequested to favour those present with a specimen of the art in which\nthey excelled, which they did after much solicitation, vowing that they\nhad no voice to-night, and that it was impossible at all times to sing\nexcept in a chamber.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098For my part,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Hillel Besso, with an extremely piquant air, \u00e2\u0080\u0098music\nin a chamber is very charming, but I think also in the open air it is\nnot so bad.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nTancred took advantage of this movement to approach Eva, who was\nconversing, as they took their evening walk, with the soft-eyed\nsister of Hillel and Madame Nassim Farhi; a group of women that the\ndrawing-rooms of Europe and the harems of Asia could perhaps not have\nrivalled.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098The Mesdemoiselles Laurella are very accomplished,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Tancred,\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098but at Damascus I am not content to hear anything but sackbuts and\npsalteries.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098But in Europe your finest music is on the subjects of our history,\u00e2\u0080\u0099\nsaid Eva.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Naturally,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Tancred, \u00e2\u0080\u0098music alone can do justice to such themes.\nThey baffle the uninspired pen.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098There is a prayer which the Mesdemoiselles Laurella once sang, a prayer\nof Moses in Egypt,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Madame Nassim, somewhat timidly. \u00e2\u0080\u0098It is very\nfine.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I wish they would favour us with it,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Eva; \u00e2\u0080\u0098I will ask Hillel to\nrequest that kindness;\u00e2\u0080\u0099 and she beckoned to Hillel, who sauntered toward\nher, and listened to her whispered wish with a smile of supercilious\ncomplacency.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098At present they are going to favour us with Don Pasquale,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he said,\nshrugging his shoulders. \u00e2\u0080\u0098A prayer is a very fine thing, but for my\npart, at this hour, I think a serenade is not so bad.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098And how do you like my father?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Eva to Tancred in a hesitating\ntone, and yet with a glance of blended curiosity and pride.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098He is exactly what Sidonia prepared me for; worthy not only of being\nyour father, but the father of mankind.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098The Moslemin say that we are near paradise at Damascus,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Madame\nNassim, \u00e2\u0080\u0098and that Adam was fashioned out of our red earth.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098He much wished to see you,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Eva, \u00e2\u0080\u0098and your meeting is as\nunexpected as to him it is agreeable.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098We ought to have met long before,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Tancred. \u00e2\u0080\u0098When I first arrived\nat Jerusalem, I ought to have hastened to his threshold. The fault and\nthe misfortune were mine. I scarcely deserved the happiness of knowing\nyou.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I am happy we have all met, and that you now understand us a little.\nWhen you go back to England, you will defend us when we are defamed? You\nwill not let them persecute us, as they did a few years back, because\nthey said we crucified their children at the feast of our passover?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I shall not go back to England,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Tancred, colouring; \u00e2\u0080\u0098and if you\nare persecuted, I hope I shall be able to defend you here.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nThe glowing sky, the soft mellow atmosphere, the brilliant surroundings,\nand the flowers and flashing gems, rich dresses and ravishing music, and\nevery form of splendour and luxury, combined to create a scene that to\nTancred was startling, as well from its beauty as its novel character.\nA rich note of Th\u00c3\u00a9r\u00c3\u00a8se Laurella for an instant arrested their\nconversation. They were silent while it lingered on their ear. Then\nTancred said to the soft-eyed sister of Hillel, \u00e2\u0080\u0098All that we require\nhere to complete the spell are your beautiful children.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098They sleep,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said the lady, \u00e2\u0080\u0098and lose little by not being present,\nfor, like the Queen of Sheba, I doubt not they are dreaming of music and\nflowers.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098They say that the children of our race are the most beautiful in the\nworld,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Eva, \u00e2\u0080\u0098but that when they grow up, they do not fulfil the\npromise of their infancy.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098That were scarcely possible,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said the soft-eyed mother.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098It is the sense of shame that comes on them and dims their lustre,\u00e2\u0080\u0099\nsaid Eva. \u00e2\u0080\u0098Instead of joyous-ness and frank hilarity, anxiety and a\nshrinking reserve are soon impressed upon the youthful Hebrew visage.\nIt is the seal of ignominy. The dreadful secret that they are an\nexpatriated and persecuted race is soon revealed to them, at least\namong the humbler classes. The children of our house are bred in noble\nthoughts, and taught self-respect. Their countenances will not change.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nAnd the countenance from whose beautiful mouth issued those gallant\nwords, what of that? It was one that might wilder the wisest. Tancred\ngazed upon it with serious yet fond abstraction. All heavenly and heroic\nthoughts gathered around the image of this woman. From the first moment\nof their meeting at Bethany to this hour of sacred festival, all the\npassages of his life in which she had been present flashed through\nhis mind. For a moment he was in the ruins of the Arabian desert, and\nrecalled her glance of sweet solicitude, when, recovered by her skill\nand her devotion, he recognised the fair stranger whose words had, ere\nthat, touched the recesses of his spirit, and attuned his mind to high\nand holiest mysteries. Now again their eyes met; an ineffable expression\nsuffused the countenance of Lord Monta-cute. He sighed.\n\nAt this moment Hillel and Fakredeen advanced with a hurried air of\ngaiety. Hillel offered his hand to Eva with jaunty grace, exclaiming\nat the same time, \u00e2\u0080\u0098Ladies, if you like to follow us, you shall see a\ncasket just arrived from Marseilles, and which Eva will favour me by\ncarrying to Aleppo. It was chosen for me by the Lady of the Austrian\nInternuncio, who is now at Paris. For my part, I do not see much\nadvantage in the diplomatic corps, if occasionally they do not execute a\ncommission for one.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nHillel hurried Eva away, accompanied by his sister and Madame Nassim.\nTancred and Fakredeen remained behind.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Who is this man?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Tancred.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098\u00e2\u0080\u0099Tis her affianced,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said the Emir; \u00e2\u0080\u0098the man who has robbed me of my\nnatural bride. It is to be hoped, however, that, when she is married,\nBesso will adopt me as his son, which in a certain sense I am, having\nbeen fostered by his wife. If he do not leave me his fortune, he ought\nat least to take up all my bills in Syria. Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you think so, my\nTancred?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098What?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Tancred, with a dreamy look.\n\nThere was a burst of laughter in the distance.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Come, come,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Fakredeen, \u00e2\u0080\u0098see how they are all gathering round the\nmarriage casket. Even Nassim Farhi has risen. I must go and talk to him:\nhe has impulses, that man, at least compared with his brother; Mourad is\na stone, a precious stone though, and you cannot magnetise him through\nhis wife, for she has not an idea; but Madame Nassim is immensely\nmesmeric. Come, come, Tancred.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I follow.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nBut instead of following his friend, Tancred entered one of the marble\npavilions that jutted out from each corner of the terraced roof, and\ncommanded splendid views of the glittering and gardened city. The moon\nhad risen over that unrivalled landscape; the white minarets sparkled in\nits beam, and the vast hoods of the cupolaed mosques were suffused with\nits radiancy or reposed in dark shadow, almost as black as the cypress\ngroves out of which they rose. In the extreme distance, beyond the\nfertile plain, was the desert, bright as the line of the sea, while\notherwise around him extended the chains of Lebanon and of the North.\n\nThe countenance of Tancred was more than serious, it was sad, as,\nleaning against one of the wreathed marble pillars, he sighed and\nmurmured: \u00e2\u0080\u0098If I were thou, most beautiful Damascus, Aleppo should not\nrob me of such a gem! But I must tear up these thoughts from my heart by\ntheir roots, and remember that I am ordained for other deeds.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLIX.\n\n     _A Discussion About Scammony_\n\nAFTER taking the bath on his arrival at Damascus, having his beard\narranged by a barber of distinction, and dressing himself in a fresh\nwhite suit, as was his custom when in residence, with his turban of the\nsame colour arranged a little aside, for Baroni was scrupulous as to his\nappearance, he hired a donkey and made his way to the great bazaar.\nThe part of the city through which he proceeded was very crowded and\nbustling: narrow streets, with mats slung across, to shield from the sun\nthe swarming population beneath. His accustomed step was familiar\nwith every winding of the emporium of the city; he threaded without\nhesitation the complicated mazes of those interminable arcades. Now he\nwas in the street of the armourers, now among the sellers of shawls;\nthe prints of Manchester were here unfolded, there the silks of India;\nsometimes he sauntered by a range of shops gay with yellow papooshes and\nscarlet slippers, and then hurried by the stalls and shelves stored with\nthe fatal frippery of the East, in which it is said the plague in\nsome shape or other always lurks and lingers. This locality, however,\nindicated that Baroni was already approaching the purlieus of the chief\nplaces; the great population had already much diminished, the brilliancy\nof the scene much dimmed; there was no longer the swarm of itinerant\ntraders who live by promptly satisfying the wants of the visitors to the\nbazaar in the shape of a pipe or an ice, a cup of sherbet or of coffee,\nor a basket of delicious fruit. The passengers were few, and all seemed\nbusy: some Armenians, a Hebrew physician and his page, the gliding\nphantoms of some winding-sheets, which were in fact women.\n\nBaroni turned into an arcade, well built, spacious, airy, and very\nneatly fitted up. This was the bazaar of the dealers in drugs. Here,\ntoo, spices are sold, all sorts of dye-woods, and especially the choice\ngums for which Arabia is still celebrated, and which Syria would fain\nrival by the aromatic juices of her pistachio and her apricot trees.\n\nSeated on what may be called his counter, smoking a nargileh, in a\nmulberry-coloured robe bordered with fur, and a dark turban, was a\nmiddle-aged man of sinister countenance and air, a long hook nose and a\nlight blue eye.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Welcome, Effendi,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he said, when he observed Baroni; \u00e2\u0080\u0098many welcomes!\nAnd how long have you been at Esh Sham?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Not too long,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Baroni; \u00e2\u0080\u0098and have you been here since my last\nvisit?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Here and there,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said the man, offering him his pipe.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098And how are our friends in the mountains?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Baroni, touching the\ntube with his lips and returning it.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098They live,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said the man.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s something,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Baroni.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Have you been in the land of the Franks?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said the man.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I am always in the land of the Franks,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Baroni, \u00e2\u0080\u0098and about.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098You don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know any one who wants a parcel of scammony?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said the man.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know that I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Baroni, mysteriously.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I have a very fine parcel,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said the man; \u00e2\u0080\u0098it is very scarce.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098No starch or myrrh in it?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 asked Baroni.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Do you think I am a Jew?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said the man.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I never could make out what you were, friend Darkush; but as for\nscammony, I could throw a good deal of business in your way at this\nmoment, to say nothing of galls and tragacanth.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098As for tragacanth,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Darkush, \u00e2\u0080\u0098it is known that no one in Esh Sham\nhas pure tragacanth except me; as for galls, every foundling in Syria\nthinks he can deal in afis, but is it afis of Moussoul, Effendi?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098What you say are the words of truth, good Darkush; I could recommend\nyou with a safe conscience. I dreamt last night that there would many\npiastres pass between us this visit.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098What is the use of friends unless they help you in the hour of\nadversity?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 exclaimed Darkush.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098You speak ever the words of truth. I am myself in a valley of dark\nshadows. I am travelling with a young English capitani, a prince of many\ntails, and he has declared that he will entirely extinguish my existence\nunless he pays a visit to the Queen of the Ansarey.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Let him first pay a visit to King Soliman in the cities of the Gin,\u00e2\u0080\u0099\nsaid Darkush, doggedly.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I am not sure that he will not, some time or other,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 replied Baroni,\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098for he is a man who will not take nay. But now let us talk of\nscammony,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he added, vaulting on the counter, and seating himself by\nthe side of Darkush; \u00e2\u0080\u0098one might get more by arranging this visit to your\nmountains than by enjoying an appalto of all its gums, friend Darkush;\nbut if it cannot be, it cannot be.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098It cannot be.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Let us talk, then, of scammony. You remember my old master, Darkush?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098There are many things that are forgotten, but he is not one.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098This capitani with whom I travel, this prince of many tails, is his\nfriend. If you serve me now, you serve also him who served you.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098There are things that can be done, and there are things that cannot be\ndone.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Let us talk, then, of scammony. But fifteen years ago, when we first\nmet, friend Darkush, you did not say nay to M. de Sidonia. It was the\nplague alone that stopped us.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098The snow on the mountain is not the same snow as fifteen years ago,\nEffendi. All things change!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Let us talk, then, of scammony. The Ansarey have friends in other\nlands, but if they will not listen to them, many kind words will be\nlost. Things also might happen which would make everybody\u00e2\u0080\u0099s shadow\nlonger, but if there be no sun, their shadows cannot be seen.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nDarkush shrugged his shoulders.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098If the sun of friendship does not illumine me,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 resumed Baroni, \u00e2\u0080\u0098I\nam entirely lost in the bottomless vale. Truly, I would give a thousand\npiastres if I could save my head by taking the capitani to your\nmountains.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098The princes of Franguestan cannot take off heads,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 observed Darkush.\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098All they can do is to banish you to islands inhabited by demons.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098But the capitani of whom I speak is prince of many tails, is the\nbrother of queens. Even the great Queen of the English, they say, is his\nsister.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098He who serves queens may expect backsheesh.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098And you serve a queen, Darkush?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Which is the reason I cannot give you a pass for the mountains, as I\nwould have done, fifteen years ago, in the time of her father.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Are her commands, then, so strict?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098That she should see neither Moslem nor Christian. She is at war with\nboth, and will be for ever, for the quarrel between them is beyond the\npower of man to remove.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098And what may it be?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098That you can learn only in the mountains of the Ansarey,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Darkush,\nwith a malignant smile.\n\nBaroni fell into a musing mood. After a few moments\u00e2\u0080\u0099 thought, he\nlooked up, and said: \u00e2\u0080\u0098What you have told me, friend Darkush, is very\ninteresting, and throws light on many things. This young prince, whom I\nserve, is a friend to your race, and knows well why you are at war both\nwith Moslem and Christian, for he is so himself. But he is a man sparing\nof words, dark in thought, and terrible to deal with. Why he wishes to\nvisit your people I dared not inquire, but now I guess, from what you\nhave let fall, that he is an Ansarey himself. He has come from a far\nland merely to visit his race, a man who is a prince among the people,\nto whom piastres are as water. I doubt not he has much to say to your\nQueen: things might have happened that would have lengthened all our\nshadows; but never mind, what cannot be, cannot be: let us talk, then,\nof scammony.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098You think he is one?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Darkush, in a lower tone, and looking very\ninquiringly.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I do,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Baroni.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098And what do you mean by one?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Darkush.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098That is exactly the secret which I never could penetrate.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I cannot give a pass to the mountains,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Darkush, \u00e2\u0080\u0098but the sympathy\nof friends is a river flowing in a fair garden. If this prince, whose\nwords and thoughts are dark, should indeed be one---- Could I see him,\nEffendi?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098It is a subject on which I dare not speak to him,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Baroni. \u00e2\u0080\u0098I\nhinted at his coming here: his brow was the brow of Eblis, his eye\nflashed like the red lightning of the Kamsin: it is impossible! What\ncannot be done, cannot be done. He must return to the land of his\nfathers, unseen by your Queen, of whom he is perhaps a brother; he will\nlive, hating alike Moslem and Christian, but he will banish me for ever\nto islands of many demons.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098The Queen shall know of these strange things,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Darkush, \u00e2\u0080\u0098and we\nwill wait for her words.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Wait for the Mecca caravan!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 exclaimed Baroni. \u00e2\u0080\u0098You know not the child\nof storms, who is my master, and that is ever a reason why I think\nhe must be one of you. For had he been softened by Christianity or\ncivilised by the Koran----\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Unripe figs for your Christianity and your Koran!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 exclaimed Darkush.\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Do you know what we think of your Christianity and your Koran?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098No,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Baroni, quietly. \u00e2\u0080\u0098Tell me.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098You will learn in our mountains,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Darkush.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Then you mean to let me go there?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098If the Queen permit you,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Darkush.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098It is three hundred miles to your country, if it be an hour\u00e2\u0080\u0099s journey,\u00e2\u0080\u0099\nsaid Baroni. \u00e2\u0080\u0098What with sending the message and receiving the answer, to\nsay nothing of the delays which must occur with a woman and a queen in\nthe case, the fountains of Esh Sham will have run dry before we hear\nthat our advance is forbidden.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nDarkush shook his head, and yet smiled.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098By the sunset of to-morrow, Effendi, I could say, ay or nay. Tell me\nwhat scammony you want, and it shall be done.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Write down in your tablets how much you can let me have,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Baroni,\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098and I will pay you for it to-morrow. As for the goods themselves, you\nmay keep them for me, until I ask you for them; perhaps the next time I\ntravel with a capitani who is one of yourselves.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nDarkush threw aside the tube of his nargileh, and, putting his hand very\ngently into the breast of his robe, he drew out a pigeon, dove-coloured,\nbut with large bright black eyes. The pigeon seemed very knowing and\nvery proud, as he rested on his master\u00e2\u0080\u0099s two fingers.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Hah, hah! my Karaguus, my black-eyes,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 exclaimed Darkush. \u00e2\u0080\u0098What, is he\ngoing on a little journey to somebody! Yes, we can trust Karaguus, for\nhe is one of us. Effendi, to-morrow at sunset, at your khan, for the\nbazaar will be closed, you shall hear from me.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER L.\n\n     _The Mysterious Mountains_\n\nAT THE black gorge of a mountain pass sat, like sentries, two horsemen.\nTheir dress was that of the Kurds: white turbans, a black shirt girt\nwith cords, on their backs a long lance, by their sides a crooked sword,\nand in their girdles a brace of pistols.\n\nBefore them extended a wide, but mountainous landscape: after the small\nand very rugged plain on the brink of which they were posted, many hilly\nridges, finally a lofty range. The general character of the scene was\nsevere and savage; the contiguous rocks were black and riven, the\nhills barren and stony, the granite peaks of the more eminent heights\nuncovered, except occasionally by the snow. Yet, notwithstanding\nthe general aridity of its appearance, the country itself was\nnot unfruitful. The concealed vegetation of the valleys was not\ninconsiderable, and was highly cherished; the less precipitous cliffs,\ntoo, were cut into terraces, and covered with artificial soil. The\nnumerous villages intimated that the country was well populated. The\ninhabitants produced sufficient wine and corn for their own use, were\nclothed in garments woven by themselves, and possessed some command\nover the products of other countries by the gums, the bees\u00e2\u0080\u0099-wax, and the\ngoats\u00e2\u0080\u0099 wool which they could offer in exchange.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I have seen two eagles over Gibel Kiflis twice this morning,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said one\nof the horsemen to his companion. \u00e2\u0080\u0098What does that portend?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098A good backsheesh for our Queen, comrade. If these children of\nFranguestan can pay a princess\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dower to visit some columns in the\ndesert, like Tadmor, they may well give us the golden keys of their\ntreasury when they enter where none should go but those who are----\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098But they say that this Frank is one.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098It has never been known that there were any among the Franks,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 replied\nhis comrade, shaking his head. \u00e2\u0080\u0098The Franks are all Nazareny, and, before\nthey were Nazareny, they were savages, and lived in caves.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098But Keferinis has given the word that all are to guard over the\nstrangers as over the Queen herself, and that one is a prince, who is\nunquestionably one of us.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098My father had counted a hundred and ten years when he left us, Azaz,\nand he had twenty-four children, and when he was at the point of death\nhe told us two things: one was, never to forget what we were; and the\nother, that never in his time had one like us ever visited our country.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Eagles again fly over Gibel Kiflis: methinks the strangers must be at\nhand.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098May their visit lead to no evil to them or to us!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Have you misgivings?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098We are alone among men: let us remain so.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098You are right. I was once at Haleb (Aleppo); I will never willingly\nfind myself there again.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Give me the mountains, the mountains of our fathers, and the beautiful\nthings that can be seen only by one of us!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098They are not to be found in the bazaars of Haleb; in the gardens of\nDamascus they are not to be sought.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Oh! who is like the Queen who reigns over us? I know to whom she is to\nbe compared, but I will not say; yet you too know, my brother in arms.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Yes; there are things which are not known in the bazaars of Haleb; in\nthe gardens of Damascus they are not to be sought.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nKaraguus, the black-eyed pigeon, brought tidings to the Queen of the\nAnsarey, from her agent Darkush, that two young princes, one a Syrian,\nthe other a Frank, wished to enter her territories to confer with her\non grave matters, and that he had reason to believe that one of the\nprinces, the Frank, strange, incredible as it might sound, was one of\nthemselves. On the evening of the next day, very weary, came Ruby-lips,\nthe brother of Black-eyes, with the reply of her Majesty, ordering\nDarkush to grant the solicited pass, but limiting the permission of\nentrance into her dominions to the two princes and two attendants. As\none of these, Baroni figured. They did not travel very rapidly. Tancred\nwas glad to seize the occasion to visit Hameh and Aleppo on his journey.\n\nIt was after quitting the latter city, and crossing the river\nKoweik, that they approached the region which was the object of their\nexpedition. What certainly did not contribute to render their progress\nless difficult and dangerous was the circumstance that war at this\nmoment was waged between the Queen of the Ansarey and the Pasha of\nAleppo. The Turkish potentate had levied tribute on some villages which\nowned her sway, and which, as he maintained, were not included in the\nancient composition paid by the Ansarey to the Porte in full of all\ndemands. The consequence was, that parties of the Ansarey occasionally\nissued from their passes and scoured the plain of Aleppo. There was also\nan understanding between the Ansarey and the Kurds, that, whenever any\nquarrel occurred between the mountaineers and the Turks, the Kurds, who\nresembled the inhabitants of the mountain in their general appearance,\nshould, under the title of Ansarey, take this opportunity of ravage.\nDarkush, however, had given Baroni credentials to the secret agent of\nthe Ansarey at Aleppo; and, with his instructions and assistance,\nthe difficulties, which otherwise might have been insuperable, were\novercome; and thus it was that the sentries stationed at the mouth of\nthe black ravine, which led to the fortress palace of the Queen, were\nnow hourly expecting the appearance of the princes.\n\nA horseman at full gallop issued from the hills, and came bounding\nover the stony plain; he shouted to the sentries as he passed them,\nannouncing the arrival of the strangers, and continued his pace through\nthe defile. Soon afterwards appeared the cavalcade of the princes;\nthemselves, their two attendants, and a party of horsemen with white\nturbans and long lances.\n\nTancred and Fakredeen rode horses of a high race. But great as is the\npleasure of being well mounted, it was not that circumstance alone which\nlit up their eyes with even unwonted fire, and tinged their cheeks\nwith a triumphant glow. Their expedition had been delightful; full of\nadventure, novelty, and suspense. They had encountered difficulties and\nthey had overcome them. They had a great purpose, they were on the eve\nof a stirring incident. They were young, daring, and brilliant.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098A strong position,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Tancred, as they entered the defile.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098O! my Tancred, what things we have seen together!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 exclaimed\nFakredeen. \u00e2\u0080\u0098And what is to follow?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nThe defile was not long, and it was almost unbending. It terminated in\na table-land of very limited extent, bounded by a rocky chain, on one of\nthe front and more moderate elevations of which was the appearance of an\nextensive fortification; though, as the travellers approached it, they\nperceived that, in many instances, art had only availed itself of the\nnatural advantages of the position, and that the towers and turrets were\ncarved out of the living rock which formed the impregnable bulwarks and\nescarpments.\n\nThe cavalcade, at a quick pace, soon gained the ascending and winding\nroad that conducted them to a tall and massy gateway, the top of which\nwas formed of one prodigious stone. The iron portal opening displayed a\ncovered way cut out of the rock, and broad enough to permit the entrance\nof two horsemen abreast. This way was of considerable length, and so\ndark that they were obliged to be preceded by torch-bearers. Thence they\nissued into a large courtyard, the sunshine of which was startling and\nalmost painful, after their late passage. The court was surrounded by\nbuildings of different styles and proportions; the further end, and, as\nit were, centre of the whole, being a broad, square, and stunted brick\ntower, immediately behind which rose the granite peaks of the mountains.\n\nThere were some horsemen in the court, and many attendants on foot, who\ncame forward and assisted the guests to alight. Tancred and Fakredeen\ndid not speak, but exchanged glances which expressed their secret\nthoughts. Perhaps they were of the same opinion as Baroni, that,\ndifficult as it was to arrive there, it might not be more easy to\nreturn. However, God is great! a consolatory truth that had sustained\nBaroni under many trials.\n\nThey were ushered into a pavilion at the side of the court, and thence\ninto a commodious divan, which opened upon another and smaller court, in\nwhich were some acacia trees. As usual, pipes and coffee were brought.\nBaroni was outside, with the other attendant, stowing away the luggage.\nA man plainly but neatly dressed, slender and wrinkled, with a stooping\ngait but a glittering eye, came into the chamber, and, in a hushed\nvoice, with many smiles, much humility, but the lurking air of a master,\nwelcomed them to Gindarics. Then, seating himself on the divan, he\nclapped his hands, and an attendant brought him his nargileh.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I presume,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Tancred, \u00e2\u0080\u0098that the Emir and myself have the honour of\nconversing with the Lord Keferinis.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Thus he addressed this celebrated\neunuch, who is prime minister of the Queen of the Ansarey.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098The Prince of England,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 replied Keferinis, bowing, and speaking in a\nvery affected voice, and in a very affected manner, \u00e2\u0080\u0098must not expect\nthe luxuries of the world amid these mountains. Born in London, which\nis surrounded by the sea, and with an immense slave population at your\ncommand, you have advantages with which the Ansarey cannot compete,\nunjustly deprived, as they have been, of their port; and unable, in\nthe present diminished supply of the markets, to purchase slaves as\nheretofore from the Turkmans and the Kurds.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I suppose the Russians interfere with your markets?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Fakredeen.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098The noble Emir of the Lebanon has expressed himself with infinite\nexactitude,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Keferinis. \u00e2\u0080\u0098The Russians now entirely stock their\nharems from the north of Asia.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098The Lord Keferinis has been a great traveller, I apprehend?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said\nTancred.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098The Prince of England has expressed himself with extreme exactitude,\nand with flattering grace,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 replied Keferinis. \u00e2\u0080\u0098I have indeed visited\nall the Syrian cities, except Jerusalem, which no one wishes to see, and\nwhich,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he added, in a sweet calm tone, \u00e2\u0080\u0098is unquestionably a place fit\nonly for hogs.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nTancred started, but repressed himself.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Have you been in Lebanon?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 asked Fakredeen.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Noble Emir, I have been the guest of princes of your illustrious house.\nConversations have passed between me and the Emir Bescheer,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he added,\nwith a significant look. \u00e2\u0080\u0098Perhaps, had events happened which did not\noccur, the great Emir Bescheer might not at this moment have been a\nprisoner at Stamboul, among those who, with infinite exactitude, may be\ndescribed as the most obscene sons of very intolerable barbarians.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098And why did not you and the Emir Bescheer agree?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 inquired Fakredeen,\neagerly. \u00e2\u0080\u0098Why has there never been a right understanding between your\npeople and the House of Shehaab? United, we should not only command\nSyria, but we might do more: we might control Asia itself!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098The noble Emir has expressed himself with inexpressible grace. The\npower of the Ansarey cannot be too highly estimated!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Is it true that your sovereign can bring five and twenty thousand men\ninto the field?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 asked Tancred.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Five and twenty thousand men,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 replied Keferinis, with insinuating\ncourtesy, \u00e2\u0080\u0098each of whom could beat nine Maronites, and consequently\nthree Druses.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Five and twenty thousand figs for your five and twenty thousand men!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\nexclaimed Fakredeen laughing.\n\nAt this moment entered four pages and four maidens bringing sweetmeats\nfrom the Queen, and goblets of iced water. They bowed; Keferinis\nindicated their purpose, and when they had fulfilled their office\nthey disappeared; but the seasonable interruption had turned the\nconversation, and prevented Fakredeen making a sharp retort. Now they\ntalked of the Queen, who, Keferinis said, would be graciously pleased\nnot to see them to-day, and might not even see them for a week, which\nagreeable intelligence was communicated in the most affable manner, as\nif it were good news, or a compliment at least.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098The name of the Queen\u00e2\u0080\u0099s father was Suedia,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Fakredeen.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098The name of the Queen\u00e2\u0080\u0099s father was Suedia,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 replied Keferinis.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098And the name of the Queen\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mother----\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Is of no consequence,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 observed Keferinis, \u00e2\u0080\u0098for she was a slave, and\nnot one of us, and therefore may with singular exactitude be described\nas nothing.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Is she the first Queen who has reigned over the Ansarey?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 inquired\nTancred.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098The first since we have settled in these mountains,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 replied Keferinis.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098And where were you settled before?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 inquired Fakredeen.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Truly,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 replied Keferinis, \u00e2\u0080\u0098in cities which never can be forgotten, and\ntherefore need never be mentioned.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nTancred and Fakredeen were very desirous of learning the name of the\nQueen, but were too well-bred directly to make the inquiry of Keferinis.\nThey had endeavoured to obtain the information as they travelled along,\nbut although every Ansarey most obligingly answered their inquiry, they\ninvariably found, on comparing notes, that every time they were favoured\nwith a different piece of information. At last, Baroni informed them\nthat it was useless to pursue their researches, as he was, from various\nreasons, convinced that no Ansarey was permitted to give any information\nof his country, race, government, or creed, although he was far\ntoo civil ever to refuse an apparently satisfactory answer to every\nquestion. As for Keferinis, although he was very conversable, the\ncompanions observed that he always made it a rule to dilate upon\nsubjects and countries with which he had no acquaintance, and\nhe expressed himself in so affected a manner, and with such an\namplification of useless phraseology, that, though he was always\ntalking, they seemed at the end of the day to be little more acquainted\nwith the Ansarey and their sovereign than when Baroni first opened the\nsubject of their visit to Darkush at Damascus.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LI.\n\n     _Queen of the Ansarey_\n\nAWAY, away, Cypros! I can remain no more; my heart beats so.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 \u00e2\u0080\u0098Sweet\nlady,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 replied Cypros, \u00e2\u0080\u0098it is surprise that agitates you.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 \u00e2\u0080\u0098Is it\nsurprise, Cypros? I did not know it was surprise. Then I never was\nsurprised before.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I think they were surprised, sweet lady,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Cypros, smiling.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Hush, you are laughing very loud, my Cypros.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 \u00e2\u0080\u0098Is that laughter, sweet\nlady? I did not know it was laughter. Then I never laughed before.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I would they should know nothing either of our smiles or of our sighs,\nmy Cypros.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nShe who said this was a girl of eighteen summers; her features very\nGreek, her complexion radiant, hair dark as night, and eyes of the\ncolour of the violet. Her beautiful countenance, however, was at this\nmoment nearly shrouded by her veil, although no one could possibly\nbehold it, excepting her attendant, younger even than herself, and fresh\nand fair as a flower.\n\nThey were hurrying along a wooden gallery, which led, behind the upper\npart of the divan occupied by the travellers, to the great square\ncentral tower of the quadrangle, which we have already noticed, and as\nthe truth must always, or at least eventually, come out, it shall not\nbe concealed that, availing themselves of a convenient, perhaps\nirresistible position, the fair fugitives had peeped into the chamber,\nand had made even minute observations on its inhabitants with impunity.\nSuddenly, Fakredeen rising from his seat, a panic had seized them and\nthey hurried away.\n\nThe gallery led to a flight of steps, and the flight of steps into\nthe first of several chambers without decoration, and with no other\nfurniture than an Eastern apartment always offers, the cushioned seat,\nwhich surrounds at least two-thirds of the room. At length they entered\na small alcove, rudely painted in arabesque, but in a classic Ionic\npattern; the alcove opened into a garden, or rather court of myrtles\nwith a fountain. An antelope, an Angora cat, two Persian greyhounds,\nwere basking on the sunny turf, and there were many birds about, in rude\nbut capacious cages.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098We are safe,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said the lady, dropping on the divan; \u00e2\u0080\u0098I think we must\nhave been seen.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098That was clearly impossible,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Cypros.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Well, we must be seen at last,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said the lady. \u00e2\u0080\u0098Heigho! I never shall\nbe able to receive them, if my heart beat so.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I would let them wait a few days, sweet lady,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Cypros, \u00e2\u0080\u0098and then\nyou would get more used to them.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I shall never be more used to them. Besides, it is rude and\ninhospitable not to see them. Yesterday there was an excuse: they were\nwearied, or I had a right to suppose they were, with their travelling;\nand to-day, there ought to be an excuse for not receiving them to-day.\nWhat is it, Cypros?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I dare say they will be quite content, if to-day you fix the time when\nyou will receive them, sweet lady.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098But I shall not be content, Cypros. Having seen them once, I wish to\nsee them again, and one cannot always be walking by accident in the\ngallery.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Then I would see them to-day, sweet lady. Shall I send for the noble\nKeferinis?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I wish I were Cypros, and you were---- Hark! what is that?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098\u00e2\u0080\u0099Tis only the antelope, sweet lady.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I thought it was---- Now tell me, my Cypros, which of these two princes\ndo you think is he who is one of us?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Oh, really, sweet lady, I think they are both so handsome!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Yet so unlike,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said the lady.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Well, they are unlike,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Cypros, \u00e2\u0080\u0098and yet----\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098And what?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098The fair one has a complexion almost as radiant as your own, sweet\nlady.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098And eyes as blue: no, they are too light. And so, as there is a\nlikeness, you think he is the one?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I am sure I wish they were both belonging to us,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Cypros.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Ah, me!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said the lady, \u00e2\u0080\u0098\u00e2\u0080\u0099Tis not the bright-faced prince whom I\nhold to be one of us. No, no, my Cypros. Think awhile, sweet girl. The\nvisage, the head of the other, have you not seen them before? Have\nyou not seen something like them? That head so proudly placed upon the\nshoulders; that hair, that hyacinthine hair, that lofty forehead, that\nproud lip, that face so refined and yet so haughty, does it not recall\nanything? Think, Cypros; think!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098It does, sweet lady.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Tell me; whisper it to me; it is a name not to be lightly mentioned.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nCypros advanced, and bending her head, breathed a word in the ear of\nthe lady, who instantly, blushing deeply, murmured with a faint smile,\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Yes.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098It is he, then,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Cypros, \u00e2\u0080\u0098who is one of us.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LII.\n\n     _A Royal Audience_\n\nOUR travellers were speculating, not very sanguinely, on the possible\nresources which Gindarics might supply for the amusement of a week,\nwhen, to their great relief, they were informed by Keferinis, that the\nQueen had fixed noon, on this the day after their arrival, to receive\nthem. And accordingly at that time some attendants, not accompanying,\nhowever, the chief minister, waited on Tancred and Fakredeen, and\nannounced that they were commanded to usher them to the royal presence.\nQuitting their apartments, they mounted a flight of steps, which led\nto the wooden gallery, along which they pursued their course. At its\ntermination were two sentries with their lances. Then they descended\na corresponding flight of stairs and entered a chamber where they were\nreceived by pages; the next room, of larger size, was crowded, and\nhere they remained for a few minutes. Then they were ushered into the\npresence.\n\nThe young Queen of the Ansarey could not have received them with an air\nmore impassive had she been holding a lev\u00c3\u00a9e at St. James\u00e2\u0080\u0099. Seated on her\ndivan, she was clothed in a purple robe; her long dark hair descended\nover her shoulders, and was drawn off her white forehead, which was\nbound with a broad circlet of pure gold, and of great antiquity. On\nher right hand stood Keferinis, the captain of her guard, and a\npriestly-looking person with a long white beard, and then at some\ndistance from these three personages, a considerable number of\nindividuals, between whose appearance and that of her ordinary subjects\nthere was little difference. On her left hand were immediately three\nfemale attendants, young and pretty; at some distance from them, a troop\nof female slaves; and again, at a still further distance, another body\nof her subjects in their white turbans and their black dresses. The\nchamber was spacious, and rudely painted in the Ionic style.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098It is most undoubtedly requested, and in a vein of the most\ncondescending friendship, by the perfectly irresistible Queen, that\nthe princes should be seated,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Keferinis, and accordingly Tancred\noccupied his allotted seat on the right of the Queen, though at some\ndistance, and the young Emir filled his on the left. Fakredeen was\ndressed in Syrian splendour, a blaze of shawls and jewelled arms; but\nTancred retained on this, as he had done on every other occasion, the\nEuropean dress, though in the present instance it assumed a somewhat\nmore brilliant shape than ordinary, in the dark green regimentals,\nthe rich embroidery, and the flowing plume of the Bellamont yeomanry\ncavalry.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098You are a prince of the English,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said the Queen to Tancred.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I am an Englishman,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he replied, \u00e2\u0080\u0098and a subject of our Queen, for we\nalso have the good fortune to be ruled over by the young and the fair.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098My fathers and the House of Shehaab have been ever friends,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 she\ncontinued, turning to Fakredeen.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098May they ever continue so!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he replied. \u00e2\u0080\u0098For if the Shehaabs and the\nAnsarey are of one mind, Syria is no longer earth, but indeed paradise.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098You live much in ships?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said the Queen, turning to Tancred.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098We are an insular people,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he answered, somewhat confusedly, but the\nperfectly-informed Keferinis came to the succour both of Tancred and of\nhis sovereign.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098The English live in ships only during six months of the year,\nprincipally when they go to India, the rest entirely at their country\nhouses.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Ships are required to take you to India?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said her Majesty.\n\nTancred bowed assent.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Is your Queen about my age?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098She was as young as your Majesty when she began to reign.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098And how long has she reigned?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Some seven years or so.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Has she a castle?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Her Majesty generally resides in a very famous castle.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Very strong, I suppose?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Strong enough.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098The Emir Bescheer remains at Stamboul?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098He is now, I believe, at Brusa,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 replied Fakredeen.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Does he like Brusa?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Not as much at Stamboul.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Is Stamboul the largest city in the world?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I apprehend by no means,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Fakredeen.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098What is larger?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098London is larger, the great city of the English, from which the prince\ncomes; Paris is also larger, but not so large as London.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098How many persons are there in Stamboul?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098More than half a million.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Have you seen Antakia (Antioch)?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 the Queen inquired of Tancred.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Not yet.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098You have seen Beiroot?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I have.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Antakia is not nearly so great a place as Beiroot,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said the Queen;\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098yet once Antakia was much larger than Stamboul; as large, perhaps, as\nyour great city.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098And far more beautiful than either,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Tancred.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Ah! you have heard of these things!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 exclaimed the Queen, with much\nanimation. \u00e2\u0080\u0098Now tell me, why is Antakia no longer a great city, as great\nas Stamboul and the city of the English, and far more beautiful?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098It is a question that might perplex the wise,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Tancred.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I am not wise,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said the Queen, looking earnestly at Tancred, \u00e2\u0080\u0098yet I\ncould solve it.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Would that your Majesty would deign to do so.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098There are things to be said, and there are things not to be said,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 was\nthe reply, and the Queen looked at Keferinis.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Her Majesty has expressed herself with infinite exactitude and with\ncondescending propriety,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said the chief minister.\n\nThe Queen was silent for a moment, thoughtful, and then waved gracefully\nher hands; whereupon the chamber was immediately cleared. The princes,\ninstructed by Keferinis, alone remained, with the exception of the\nminister, who, at the desire of his sovereign, now seated himself, but\nnot on the divan. He sat opposite to the Queen on the floor.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Princes,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said the Queen, \u00e2\u0080\u0098you are welcome to Gindarics, where nobody\never comes. For we are people who wish neither to see nor to be seen. We\nare not like other people, nor do we envy other people. I wish not for\nthe ships of the Queen of the English, and my subjects are content to\nlive as their fathers lived before them. Our mountains are wild and\nbarren; our vales require for their cultivation unceasing toil. We have\nno gold or silver, no jewels; neither have we silk. But we have some\nbeautiful and consoling thoughts, and more than thoughts, which are\nshared by all of us and open to all of us, and which only we can value\nor comprehend. When Darkush, who dwells at Damascus, and was the servant\nof my father, sent to us the ever-faithful messenger, and said that\nthere were princes who wished to confer with us, he knew well it was\nvain to send here men who would talk of the English and the Egyptians,\nof the Porte and of the nations of Fran-guestan. These things to us are\nlike the rind of fruit. Neither do we care for cottons, nor for things\nwhich are sought for in the cities of the plains, and it may be, noble\nEmir, cherished also in the mountains of Lebanon. This is not Lebanon,\nbut the mountains of the Ansarey, who are as they have ever been, before\nthe name of Turk or English was known in Syria, and who will remain as\nthey are, unless that happens which may never happen, but which is\ntoo beautiful not to believe may arrive. Therefore I speak to you with\nfrankness, princes of strange countries: Dar-kush, the servant of my\nfather, and also mine, told me, by the ever-faithful messenger, that it\nwas not of these things, which are to us like water spilt on sand, that\nyou wished to confer, but that there were things to be said which ought\nto be uttered. Therefore it is I sent back the faithful messenger,\nsaying, \u00e2\u0080\u009cSend then these princes to Gindarics, since their talk is not\nof things which come and go, making a noise on the coast and in the\ncities of the plains, and then passing away.\u00e2\u0080\u009d These we infinitely\ndespise; but the words of truth uttered in the spirit of friendship will\nlast, if they be grave, and on matters which authorise journeys made by\nprinces to visit queens.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nHer Majesty ceased, and looked at Keferinis, who bowed profound\napprobation. Tancred and Fakre-deen, also exchanged glances, but the\nEmir waved his hand, signifying his wish that Tancred should reply,\nwho, after a moment\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hesitation, with an air of great deference, thus\nventured to express himself:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098It seems to me and to my friend, the Prince of the Lebanon, that we\nhave listened to the words of wisdom. They are in every respect just.\nWe know not, ourselves, Darkush, but he was rightly informed when he\napprised your Majesty that it was not upon ordinary topics, either\npolitical or commercial, that we desired to visit Gindarics. Nor was it\nout of such curiosity as animates travellers. For we are not travellers,\nbut men who have a purpose which we wish to execute. The world, that,\nsince its creation, has owned the spiritual supremacy of Asia, which\nis but natural, since Asia is the only portion of the world which the\nCreator of that world has deigned to visit, and in which he has ever\nconferred with man, is unhappily losing its faith in those ideas and\nconvictions that hitherto have governed the human race. We think,\ntherefore, the time has arrived when Asia should make one of its\nperiodical and appointed efforts to reassert that supremacy. But though\nwe are acting, as we believe, under a divine impulse, it is our duty to\nselect the most fitting human agents to accomplish a celestial mission.\nWe have thought, therefore, that it should devolve on Syria and Arabia,\ncountries in which our God has even dwelt, and with which he has been\nfrom the earliest days in direct and regular communication, to undertake\nthe solemn task. Two races of men, alike free, one inhabiting the\ndesert, the other the mountains, untainted by any of the vices of the\nplains, and the virgin vigour of their intelligence not dwarfed by the\nconventional superstitions of towns and cities, one prepared at once\nto supply an unrivalled cavalry, the other an army ready equipped of\nintrepid foot-soldiers, appear to us to be indicated as the natural\nand united conquerors of the world. We wish to conquer that world, with\nangels at our head, in order that we may establish the happiness of man\nby a divine dominion, and crushing the political atheism that is now\ndesolating existence, utterly extinguish the grovelling tyranny of\nself-government.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nThe Queen of the Ansarey listened with deep and agitated attention to\nTancred. When he had concluded, she said, after a moment\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pause, \u00e2\u0080\u0098I\nbelieve also in the necessity of the spiritual supremacy of our Asia.\nAnd since it has ceased, it seems not to me that man and man\u00e2\u0080\u0099s life have\nbeen either as great or as beautiful as heretofore. What you have said\nassures me that it is well that you have come hither. But when you speak\nof Arabia, of what God is it you speak?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I speak of the only God, the Creator of all things, the God who spoke\non the Arabian Mount Sinai, and expiated our sins upon the Syrian Mount\nCalvary.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098There is also Mount Olympus,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said the Queen, \u00e2\u0080\u0098which is in Anatolia.\nOnce the gods dwelt there.\u00e2\u0080\u0099--\u00e2\u0080\u0098The gods of poets,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Tancred. \u00e2\u0080\u0098No; the\ngods of the people; who loved the people, and whom the people loved.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nThere was a pause, broken by the Queen, who, looking at her minister,\nsaid, \u00e2\u0080\u0098Noble Keferinis, the thoughts of these princes are divine, and in\nevery respect becoming celestial things. Is it not well that the gates\nof the beautiful and the sacred should not be closed?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098In every sense, irresistible Queen, it is well that the gates of the\nbeautiful and the sacred should not be closed.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Then let them bring garlands. Princes,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 the Queen continued, \u00e2\u0080\u0098what the\neye of no stranger has looked upon, you shall now behold. This also is\nAsian and divine.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nImmediately the chamber again filled. The Queen, looking at the two\nprinces and bowing, rose from her seat. They instantly followed her\nexample. One came forward, offering to the Queen, and then to each of\nthem, a garland. Garlands were also taken by Keferinis and a few others.\nCypros and her companions walked first, then Keferinis and one who had\nstood near the royal divan; the Queen, between her two guests, followed,\nand after her a small and ordered band.\n\nThey stopped before a lofty portal of bronze, evidently of ancient art.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\nThis opened into a covered and excavated way, in some respects similar\nto that which had led them directly to the castle of Gin-darics; but,\nalthough obscure, not requiring artificial light, yet it was of no\ninconsiderable length. It emerged upon a platform cut out of the natural\nrock; on all sides were steep cliffs, above them the bright blue sky.\nThe ravine appeared to be closed on every side.\n\nThe opposite cliff, at the distance of several hundred yards, reached by\na winding path, presented, at first, the appearance of the front of an\nancient temple; and Tancred, as he approached it, perceived that the\nhand of art had assisted the development of an imitation of nature: a\npediment, a deep portico, supported by Ionic columns, and a flight of\nsteps, were carved out of the cliff, and led into vast caverns, which\nart also had converted into lofty and magnificent chambers. When\nthey had mounted the steps, the Queen and her companions lifted their\ngarlands to the skies, and joined in a chorus, solemn and melodious,\nbut which did not sound as the language of Syria. Passing through the\nportico, Tancred found himself apparently in a vast apartment, where he\nbeheld a strange spectacle.\n\nAt the first glance it seemed that, ranged on blocks of the surrounding\nmountains, were a variety of sculptured figures of costly materials\nand exquisite beauty; forms of heroic majesty and ideal grace; and,\nthemselves serene and unimpassioned, filling the minds of the beholders\nwith awe and veneration. It was not until his eye was accustomed to the\natmosphere, and his mind had in some degree recovered from the first\nstrange surprise, that Tancred gradually recognised the fair and famous\nimages over which his youth had so long and so early pondered. Stole\nover his spirit the countenance august, with the flowing beard and\nthe lordly locks, sublime on his ivory throne, in one hand the ready\nthunderbolt, in the other the cypress sceptre; at his feet the watchful\neagle with expanded wings: stole over the spirit of the gazing pilgrim,\neach shape of that refined and elegant hierarchy made for the worship\nof clear skies and sunny lands; goddess and god, genius and nymph,\nand faun, all that the wit and heart of man can devise and create, to\nrepresent his genius and his passion, all that the myriad developments\nof a beautiful nature can require for their personification. A beautiful\nand sometimes flickering light played over the sacred groups and\nfigures, softening the ravages of time, and occasionally investing them\nwith, as it were, a celestial movement.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098The gods of the Greeks!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 exclaimed Tancred.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098The gods of the Ansarey,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said the Queen; \u00e2\u0080\u0098the gods of my fathers!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I am filled with a sweet amazement,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 murmured Tancred. \u00e2\u0080\u0098Life is\nstranger than I deemed. My soul is, as it were, unsphered.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Yet you know them to be gods,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said the Queen; \u00e2\u0080\u0098and the Emir of the\nLebanon does not know them to be gods?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I feel that they are such,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Fakredeen.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098How is this, then?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said the Queen. \u00e2\u0080\u0098How is it that you, the child of a\nnorthern isle----\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Should recognise the Olympian Jove,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Tancred. \u00e2\u0080\u0098It seems strange;\nbut from my earliest youth I learnt these things.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Ah, then,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 murmured the Queen to herself, and with an expression of the\ngreatest satisfaction, \u00e2\u0080\u0098Dar-kush was rightly informed; he is one of us.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I behold then, at last, the gods of the Ansarey,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Fakredeen.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098All that remains of Antioch, noble Emir; of Anti-och the superb, with\nits hundred towers, and its sacred groves and fanes of flashing beauty.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Unhappy Asia!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 exclaimed the Emir; \u00e2\u0080\u0098thou hast indeed fallen!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098When all was over,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said the Queen; \u00e2\u0080\u0098when the people refused to\nsacrifice, and the gods, indignant, quitted earth, I hope not for ever,\nthe faithful few fled to these mountains with the sacred images, and we\nhave cherished them. I told you we had beautiful and consoling thoughts,\nand more than thoughts. All else is lost, our wealth, our arts, our\nluxury, our invention, all have vanished. The niggard earth scarcely\nyields us a subsistence; we dress like Kurds, feed hardly as well; but\nif we were to quit these mountains, and wander like them on the plains\nwith our ample flocks, we should lose our sacred images, all the\ntraditions that we yet cherish in our souls, that in spite of our hard\nlives preserve us from being barbarians; a sense of the beautiful and\nthe lofty, and the divine hope that, when the rapidly consummating\ndegradation of Asia has been fulfilled, mankind will return again to\nthose gods who made the earth beautiful and happy; and that they, in\ntheir celestial mercy, may revisit that world which, without them, has\nbecome a howling wilderness.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Lady,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Tancred, with much emotion, \u00e2\u0080\u0098we must, with your permission,\nspeak of these things. My heart is at present too full.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Come hither,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said the Queen, in a voice of great softness; and she led\nTancred away.\n\nThey entered a chamber of much smaller dimensions, which might be looked\nupon as a chapel annexed to the cathedral or Pantheon which they had\nquitted. At each end of it was a statue. They paused before one. It was\nnot larger than life, of ivory and gold; the colour purer than could\npossibly have been imagined, highly polished, and so little injured,\nthat at a distance the general effect was not in the least impaired.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Do you know that?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 asked the Queen, as she looked at the statue, and\nthen she looked at Tancred.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I recognise the god of poetry and light,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Tancred; \u00e2\u0080\u0098Phoebus\nApollo.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Our god: the god of Antioch, the god of the sacred grove! Who could\nlook upon him, and doubt his deity!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Is this indeed the figure,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 murmured Tancred, \u00e2\u0080\u0098before which a hundred\nsteers have bled? before which libations of honeyed wine were poured\nfrom golden goblets? that lived in a heaven of incense?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Ah! you know all.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Angels watch over us!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Tancred, \u00e2\u0080\u0098or my brain will turn. And who is\nthis?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098One before whom the pilgrims of the world once kneeled. This is the\nSyrian goddess; the Venus of our land, but called among us by a name\nwhich, by her favour, I also bear, Astarte.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LIII.\n\n     _Fakredeen\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Plots_\n\nAND when did men cease from worshipping them?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 asked Fakredeen of\nTancred; \u00e2\u0080\u0098before the Prophet?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 \u00e2\u0080\u0098When truth descended from Heaven in the\nperson of Christ Jesus.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098But truth had descended from Heaven before Jesus,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 replied Fakredeen;\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098since, as you tell me, God spoke to Moses on Mount Sinai, and since\nthen to many of the prophets and the princes of Israel.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Of whom Jesus was one,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Tancred; \u00e2\u0080\u0098the descendant of King David\nas well as the Son of God. But through this last and greatest of their\nprinces it was ordained that the inspired Hebrew mind should mould and\ngovern the world. Through Jesus God spoke to the Gentiles, and not to\nthe tribes of Israel only. That is the great worldly difference between\nJesus and his inspired predecessors. Christianity is Judaism for\nthe multitude, but still it is Judaism, and its development was the\ndeath-blow of the Pagan idolatry.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Gentiles,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 murmured Fakredeen; \u00e2\u0080\u0098Gentiles! you are a Gentile, Tancred?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Alas! I am,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he answered, \u00e2\u0080\u0098sprung from a horde of Baltic pirates, who\nnever were heard of during the greater annals of the world, a descent\nwhich I have been educated to believe was the greatest of honours. What\nwe should have become, had not the Syro-Arabian creeds formed our minds,\nI dare not contemplate. Probably we should have perished in mutual\ndestruction. However, though rude and modern Gentiles, unknown to the\nApostles, we also were in time touched with the sacred symbol, and\noriginally endowed with an organisation of a high class, for our\nancestors wandered from Caucasus; we have become kings and princes.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098What a droll thing is history,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Fakredeen. \u00e2\u0080\u0098Ah! if I were only\nacquainted with it, my education would be complete. Should you call me a\nGentile?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I have great doubts whether such an appellation could be extended to\nthe descendants of Ishmael. I always look upon you as a member of the\nsacred race. It is a great thing for any man; for you it may tend to\nempire.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Was Julius C\u00c3\u00a6sar a Gentile?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Unquestionably.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098And Iskander?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 (Alexander of Macedon.)\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098No doubt; the two most illustrious Gentiles that ever existed, and\nrepresenting the two great races on the shores of the Mediterranean, to\nwhich the apostolic views were first directed.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Well, their blood, though Gentile, led to empire,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Fakredeen.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098But what are their conquests to those of Jesus Christ?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Tancred,\nwith great animation. \u00e2\u0080\u0098Where are their dynasties? where their\nsubjects? They were both deified: who burns incense to them now? Their\ndescendants, both Greek and Roman, bow before the altars of the house of\nDavid. The house of David is worshipped at Rome itself, at every seat of\ngreat and growing empire in the world, at London, at St. Petersburg,\nat New York. Asia alone is faithless to the Asian; but Asia has been\noverrun by Turks and Tatars. For nearly five hundred years the true\nOriental mind has been enthralled. Arabia alone has remained free and\nfaithful to the divine tradition. From its bosom we shall go forth and\nsweep away the moulding remnants of the Tataric system; and then,\nwhen the East has resumed its indigenous intelligence, when angels and\nprophets again mingle with humanity, the sacred quarter of the globe\nwill recover its primeval and divine supremacy; it will act upon the\nmodern empires, and the faint-hearted faith of Europe, which is but\nthe shadow of a shade, will become as vigorous as befits men who are in\nsustained communication with the Creator.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098But suppose,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Fakredeen, in a captious tone that was unusual with\nhim, \u00e2\u0080\u0098suppose, when the Tataric system is swept away, Asia reverts to\nthose beautiful divinities that we beheld this morning?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nMore than once, since they quitted the presence of Astarte, had\nFakredeen harped upon this idea. From that interview the companions\nhad returned moody and unusually silent. Strange to say, there seemed\na tacit understanding between them to converse little on that subject\nwhich mainly engrossed their minds. Their mutual remarks on Astarte\nwere few and constrained; a little more diffused upon the visit to the\ntemple; but they chiefly kept up the conventional chat of companionship\nby rather commonplace observations on Keferinis and other incidents and\npersons comparatively of little interest and importance.\n\nAfter their audience, they dined with the minister, not exactly in\nthe manner of Downing Street, nor even with the comparative luxury of\nCanobia; but the meal was an incident, and therefore agreeable. A good\npilaff was more acceptable than some partridges dressed with oil and\nhoney: but all Easterns are temperate, and travel teaches abstinence\nto the Franks. Neither Fakredeen nor Tancred were men who criticised a\nmeal: bread, rice, and coffee, a bird or a fish, easily satisfied them.\nThe Emir affected the Moslem when the minister offered him the wine of\nthe mountains, which was harsh and rough after the delicious Vino d\u00e2\u0080\u0099Oro\nof Lebanon; but Tancred contrived to drink the health of Queen Astarte\nwithout any wry expression of countenance.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I believe,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Keferinis, \u00e2\u0080\u0098that the English, in their island of\nLondon, drink only to women; the other natives of Franguestan chiefly\npledge men; we look upon both as barbarous.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098At any rate, you worship the god of wine,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 remarked Tancred, who never\nattempted to correct the self-complacent minister. \u00e2\u0080\u0098I observed to-day\nthe statue of Bacchus.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Bacchus!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Keferinis, with a smile, half of inquiry, half of\ncommiseration. \u00e2\u0080\u0098Bacchus: an English name, I apprehend! All our gods\ncame from the ancient Antakia before either the Turks or the English\nwere heard of. Their real names are in every respect sacred; nor will\nthey be uttered, even to the Ansarey, until after the divine initiation\nhas been performed in the perfectly admirable and inexpressibly\ndelightful mysteries,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 which meant, in simpler tongue, that Keferinis\nwas entirely ignorant of the subject on which he was talking.\n\nAfter their meal, Keferinis, proposing that in the course of the\nday they should fly one of the Queen\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hawks, left them, when the\nconversation, of which we have given a snatch, occurred. Yet, as we have\nobserved, they were on the whole moody and unusually silent. Fakredeen\nin particular was wrapped in reverie, and when he spoke, it was always\nin reference to the singular spectacle of the morning. His musing forced\nhim to inquiry, having never before heard of the Olympian heirarchy, nor\nof the woods of Daphne, nor of the bright lord of the silver bow.\n\nWhy were they moody and silent?\n\nWith regard to Lord Montacute, the events of the morning might\nsufficiently account for the gravity of his demeanour, for he was\nnaturally of a thoughtful and brooding temperament. This unexpected\nintroduction to Olympus was suggestive of many reflections to one so\nhabituated to muse over divine influences. Nor need it be denied that\nthe character of the Queen greatly interested him. Her mind was\nalready attuned to heavenly thoughts. She already believed that she\nwas fulfilling a sacred mission. Tancred could not be blind to the\nimportance of such a personage as Astarte in the great drama of divine\nregeneration, which was constantly present to his consideration. Her\nconversion might be as weighty as ten victories. He was not insensible\nto the efficacy of feminine influence in the dissemination of religious\ntruth, nor unaware how much the greatest development of the Arabian\ncreeds, in which the Almighty himself deigned to become a personal\nactor, was assisted by the sacred spell of woman. It is not the Empress\nH\u00c3\u00a9l\u00c3\u00a8ne alone who has rivalled, or rather surpassed, the exploits of the\nmost illustrious apostles. The three great empires of the age, France,\nEngland, and Russia, are indebted for their Christianity to female lips.\nWe all remember the salutary influence of Clotilde and Bertha which bore\nthe traditions of the Jordan to the Seine and the Thames: it should not\nbe forgotten that to the fortunate alliance of Waldimir, the Duke of\nMoscovy, with the sister of the Greek Emperor Basil, is to be ascribed\nthe remarkable circumstance, that the intellectual development of all\nthe Russias has been conducted on Arabian principles. It was the fair\nGiselle, worthy successor of the softhearted women of Galilee, herself\nthe sister of the Emperor Henry the Second, who opened the mind of her\nhusband, the King of Hungary, to the deep wisdom of the Hebrews, to the\nlaws of Moses and the precepts of Jesus. Poland also found an apostle\nand a queen in the sister of the Duke of Bohemia, and who revealed to\nthe Sarmatian Micislas the ennobling mysteries of Sinai and of Calvary.\n\nSons of Israel, when you recollect that you created Christendom, you may\npardon the Christians even their _autos da f\u00c3\u00a8!_\n\nFakredeen Shehaab, Emir of Canobia, and lineal descendant of the\nstandard-bearer of the Prophet, had not such faith in Arabian principles\nas to dream of converting the Queen of the Ansarey. Quite the reverse;\nthe Queen of the Ansarey had converted him. From the first moment he\nbeheld Astarte, she had exercised over him that magnetic influence\nof which he was peculiarly susceptible, and by which Tancred at once\nattracted and controlled him. But Astarte added to this influence a\npower to which the Easterns in general do not very easily bow: the\ninfluence of sex. With the exception of Eva, woman had never guided the\nspirit or moulded the career of Fakredeen; and, in her instance, the\nsovereignty had been somewhat impaired by that acquaintance of the\ncradle, which has a tendency to enfeeble the ideal, though it may\nstrengthen the affections. But Astarte rose upon him commanding and\ncomplete, a star whose gradual formation he had not watched, and whose\nunexpected brilliancy might therefore be more striking even than\nthe superior splendour which he had habitually contemplated. Young,\nbeautiful, queenly, impassioned, and eloquent, surrounded by the\naccessories that influence the imagination, and invested with\nfascinating mystery, Fakredeen, silent and enchanted, had yielded his\nspirit to Astarte, even before she revealed to his unaccustomed and\nastonished mind the godlike forms of her antique theogony. Eva and\nTancred had talked to him of gods; Astarte had shown them to him. All\nvisible images of their boasted divinities of Sinai and of Calvary with\nwhich he was acquainted were enshrined over the altars of the convents\nof Lebanon. He contrasted those representations without beauty or grace,\nso mean, and mournful, and spiritless, or if endued with attributes of\npower, more menacing than majestic, and morose rather than sublime, with\nthose shapes of symmetry, those visages of immortal beauty, serene\nyet full of sentiment, on which he had gazed that morning with a holy\nrapture. The Queen had said that, besides Mount Sinai and Mount\nCalvary, there was also Mount Olympus. It was true; even Tancred had\nnot challenged her assertion. And the legends of Olympus were as old as,\nnay, older than, those of the convent or the mosques.\n\nThis was no mythic fantasy of the beautiful Astarte; the fond tradition\nof a family, a race, even a nation. These were not the gods merely of\nthe mountains: they had been, as they deserved to be, the gods of a\ngreat world, of great nations, and of great men. They were the gods of\nAlexander and of Caius Julius; they were the gods under whose divine\nadministration Asia had been powerful, rich, luxurious and happy. They\nwere the gods who had covered the coasts and plains with magnificent\ncities, crowded the midland ocean with golden galleys, and filled the\nprovinces that were now a chain of wilderness and desert with teeming\nand thriving millions. No wonder the Ansarey were faithful to such\ndeities. The marvel was why men should ever have deserted them. But\nman had deserted them, and man was unhappy. All, Eva, Tancred, his own\nconsciousness, the surrounding spectacles of his life, assured him that\nman was unhappy, degraded, or discontented; at all events, miserable. He\nwas not surprised that a Syrian should be unhappy, even a Syrian prince,\nfor he had no career; he was not surprised that the Jews were unhappy,\nbecause they were the most persecuted of the human race, and in all\nprobability, very justly so, for such an exception as Eva proved\nnothing; but here was an Englishman, young, noble, very rich, with every\nadvantage of nature and fortune, and he had come out to Syria to tell\nthem that all Europe was as miserable as themselves. What if their\nmisery had been caused by their deserting those divinities who had once\nmade them so happy?\n\nA great question; Fakredeen indulged in endless combinations while he\nsmoked countless nargilehs. If religion were to cure the world, suppose\nthey tried this ancient and once popular faith, so very popular in\nSyria. The Queen of the Ansarey could command five-and-twenty thousand\napproved warriors, and the Emir of the Lebanon could summon a host,\nif not as disciplined, far more numerous. Fakredeen, in a frenzy\nof reverie, became each moment more practical. Asian supremacy,\ncosmopolitan regeneration, and theocratic equality, all gradually\ndisappeared. An independent Syrian kingdom, framed and guarded by a\nhundred thousand sabres, rose up before him; an established Olympian\nreligion, which the Druses, at his instigation, would embrace, and\ntoleration for the Maronites till he could bribe Bishop Nicodemus to\narrange a general conformity, and convert his great principal from the\nPatriarch into the Pontiff of Antioch. The Jews might remain,\nprovided they negotiated a loan which should consolidate the Olympian\ninstitutions and establish the Gentile dynasty of Fakredeen and Astarte.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LIV.\n\n     _Astarte is Jealous_\n\nWHEN Fakredeen bade Tancred as usual good-night, his voice was different\nfrom its accustomed tones; he had replied to Tancred with asperity\nseveral times during the evening; and when he was separated from his\ncompanion, he felt relieved. All unconscious of these changes and\nsymptoms was the heir of Bellamont.\n\nThough grave, one indeed who never laughed and seldom smiled, Tancred\nwas blessed with the rarest of all virtues, a singularly sweet temper.\nHe was grave, because he was always thinking, and thinking of great\ndeeds. But his heart was soft, and his nature most kind, and\nremarkably regardful of the feelings of others. To wound them, however\nunintentionally, would occasion him painful disturbance. Though\nnaturally rapid in the perception of character, his inexperience of\nlife, and the self-examination in which he was so frequently absorbed,\ntended to blunt a little his observation of others. With a generous\nfailing, which is not uncommon, he was prepared to give those whom\nhe loved credit for the virtues which he himself possessed, and the\nsentiments which he himself extended to them. Being profound, steadfast,\nand most loyal in his feelings, he was incapable of suspecting that his\nelected friend could entertain sentiments towards him less deep, less\nearnest, and less faithful. The change in the demeanour of the Emir\nwas, therefore, unnoticed by him. And what might be called the sullen\nirritability of Fakredeen was encountered with the usual gentleness and\ntotal disregard of self which always distinguished the behaviour of Lord\nMontacute.\n\nThe next morning they were invited by Astarte to a hawking party,\nand, leaving the rugged ravines, they descended into a softer and\nmore cultivated country, where they found good sport. Fakredeen was an\naccomplished falconer, and loved to display his skill before the Queen.\nTancred was quite unpractised, but Astarte seemed resolved that he\nshould become experienced in the craft among her mountains, which did\nnot please the Emir, as he caracoled in sumptuous dress on a splendid\nsteed, with the superb falcon resting on his wrist.\n\nThe princes dined again with Keferinis; that, indeed, was to be their\ncustom during their stay; afterwards, accompanied by the minister,\nthey repaired to the royal divan, where they had received a general\ninvitation. Here they found Astarte alone, with the exception of Cypros\nand her companions, who worked with their spindles apart; and here, on\nthe pretext of discussing the high topics on which they had repaired\nto Gindarics, there was much conversation on many subjects. Thus passed\none, two, and even three days; thus, in general, would their hours be\noccupied at Gindarics. In the morning the hawks, or a visit to some\ngreen valley, which was blessed with a stream and beds of oleander, and\ngroves of acacia or sycamore. Fakredeen had no cause to complain of\nthe demeanour of Astarte towards him, for it was most gracious and\nencouraging. Indeed, he pleased her; and she was taken, as many had\nbeen, by the ingenuous modesty, the unaffected humility, the tender and\ntouching deference of his manner; he seemed to watch her every glance,\nand hang upon her every accent: his sympathy with her was perfect; he\nagreed with every sentiment and observation that escaped her. Blushing,\nboyish, unsophisticated, yet full of native grace, and evidently gifted\nwith the most amiable disposition, it was impossible not to view with\ninterest, and even regard, one so young and so innocent.\n\nBut while the Emir had no cause to be dissatisfied with the demeanour of\nAstarte to himself, he could not be unaware that her carriage to Tancred\nwas different, and he doubted whether the difference was in his favour.\nHe hung on the accents of Astarte, but he remarked that the Queen hung\nupon the accents of Tancred, who, engrossed with great ideas, and full\nof a great purpose, was unconscious of what did not escape the\nlynx-like glance of his companion. However, Fakredeen was not, under any\ncircumstances, easily disheartened; in the present case, there were many\ncircumstances to encourage him. This was a great situation; there was\nroom for combinations. He felt that he was not unfavoured by Astarte; he\nhad confidence, and a just confidence, in his power of fascination. He\nhad to combat a rival, who was, perhaps, not thinking of conquest; at\nany rate, who was unconscious of success. Even had he the advantage,\nwhich Fakredeen was not now disposed to admit, he might surely be\nbaffled by a competitor with a purpose, devoting his whole intelligence\nto his object, and hesitating at no means to accomplish it.\n\nFakredeen became great friends with Keferinis. He gave up his time and\nattentions much to that great personage; anointed him with the most\ndelicious flattery, most dexterously applied; consulted him on great\naffairs which had no existence; took his advice on conjunctures which\nnever could occur; assured Keferinis that, in his youth, the Emir\nBescheer had impressed on him the importance of cultivating the friendly\nfeelings and obtaining the support of the distinguished minister of the\nAnsarey; gave him some jewels, and made him enormous promises.\n\nOn the fourth day of the visit, Fakredeen found himself alone with\nAstarte, at least, without the presence of Tancred, whom Keferinis had\ndetained in his progress to the royal apartment. The young Emir had\npushed on, and gained an opportunity which he had long desired.\n\nThey were speaking of the Lebanon; Fakredeen had been giving Astarte,\nat her request, a sketch of Canobia, and intimating his inexpressible\ngratification were she to honour his castle with a visit; when, somewhat\nabruptly, in a suppressed voice, and in a manner not wholly free from\nembarrassment, Astarte said, \u00e2\u0080\u0098What ever surprises me is, that Darkush,\nwho is my servant at Damascus, should have communicated, by the faithful\nmessenger, that one of the princes seeking to visit Gindarics was of our\nbeautiful and ancient faith; for the Prince of England has assured me\nthat nothing was more unfounded or indeed impossible; that the faith,\nancient and beautiful, never prevailed in the land of his fathers; and\nthat the reason why he was acquainted with the god-like forms is, that\nin his country it is the custom (custom to me most singular, and indeed\nincomprehensible) to educate the youth by teaching them the ancient\npoems of the Greeks, poems quite lost to us, but in which are embalmed\nthe sacred legends.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098We ought never to be surprised at anything that is done by the\nEnglish,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 observed Fakredeen; \u00e2\u0080\u0098who are, after all, in a certain sense,\nsavages. Their country produces nothing; it is an island, a mere rock,\nlarger than Malta, but not so well fortified. Everything they require\nis imported from other countries; they get their corn from Odessa, and\ntheir wine from the ports of Spain. I have been assured at Beiroot that\nthey do not grow even their own cotton, but that I can hardly believe.\nEven their religion is an exotic; and as they are indebted for that to\nSyria, it is not surprising that they should import their education from\nGreece.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Poor people!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 exclaimed the Queen; \u00e2\u0080\u0098and yet they travel; they wish to\nimprove themselves?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Darkush, however,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 continued Fakredeen, without noticing the last\nobservation of Astarte, \u00e2\u0080\u0098was not wrongly informed.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Not wrongly informed?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098No: one of the princes who wished to visit Gindarics was, in a certain\nsense, of the ancient and beautiful faith, but it was not the Prince of\nthe English.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098What are these pigeons that you are flying without letters!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 exclaimed\nAstarte, looking very perplexed.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Ah! beautiful Astarte,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Fakredeen, with a sigh; \u00e2\u0080\u0098you did not know\nmy mother.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098How should I know your mother, Emir of the castles of Lebanon? Have I\never left these mountains, which are dearer to me than the pyramids of\nEgypt to the great Pasha? Have I ever looked upon your women, Maronite\nor Druse, walking in white sheets, as if they were the children of ten\nthousand ghouls; with horns on their heads, as if they were the wild\nhorses of the desert?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Ask Keferinis,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Fakredeen, still sighing; \u00e2\u0080\u0098he has been at\nBteddeen, the court of the Emir Bescheer. He knew my mother, at least by\nmemory. My mother, beautiful Astarte, was an Ansarey.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Your mother was an Ansarey!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 repeated Astarte, in a tone of infinite\nsurprise; \u00e2\u0080\u0098your mother an Ansarey? Of what family was she a child?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Ah!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 replied Fakredeen, \u00e2\u0080\u0098there it is; that is the secret sorrow of\nmy life. A mystery hangs over my mother, for I lost both my parents in\nextreme childhood; I was at her heart,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he added, in a broken voice,\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098and amid outrage, tumult, and war. Of whom was my mother the child? I am\nhere to discover that, if possible. Her race and her beautiful religion\nhave been the dream of my life. All I have prayed for has been to\nrecognise her kindred and to behold her gods.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098It is very interesting,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 murmured the Queen.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098It is more than interesting,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 sighed Fakredeen. \u00e2\u0080\u0098Ah! beautiful Astarte!\nif you knew all, if you could form even the most remote idea of what I\nhave suffered for this unknown faith;\u00e2\u0080\u0099 and a passionate tear quivered on\nthe radiant cheek of the young prince.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098And yet you came here to preach the doctrines of another,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said\nAstarte.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I came here to preach the doctrines of another!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 replied Fakredeen,\nwith an expression of contempt; his nostril dilated, his lip curled with\nscorn. \u00e2\u0080\u0098This mad Englishman came here to preach the doctrines of another\ncreed, and one with which it seems to me, he has as little connection\nas his frigid soil has with palm trees. They produce them, I am told, in\nhouses of glass, and they force their foreign faith in the same manner;\nbut, though they have temples, and churches, and mosques, they confess\nthey have no miracles; they admit that they never produced a prophet;\nthey own that no God ever spoke to their people, or visited their land;\nand yet this race, so peculiarly favoured by celestial communication,\naspire to be missionaries!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I have much misapprehended you,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Astarte; \u00e2\u0080\u0098I thought you were both\nembarked in a great cause.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Ah, you learnt that from Darkush!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 quickly replied Fakredeen. \u00e2\u0080\u0098You see,\nbeautiful Astarte, that I have no personal acquaintance with Darkush. It\nwas the intendant of my companion who was his friend; and it is through\nhim that Darkush has learnt anything that he has communicated. The\nmission, the project, was not mine; but when I found my comrade had the\nmeans, which had hitherto evaded me, of reaching Gindarics, I threw\nno obstacles in his crotchety course. On the contrary, I embraced the\nopportunity even with fervour, and far from discouraging my friend from\nviews to which I know he is fatally, even ridiculously, wedded, I looked\nforward to this expedition as the possible means of diverting his\nmind from some opinions, and, I might add, some influences, which I am\npersuaded can eventually entail upon him nothing but disappointment\nand disgrace.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 And here Fakredeen shook his head, with that air of\nconfidential mystery which so cleverly piques curiosity.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Whatever may be his fate,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Astarte, in a tone of seriousness,\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098the English prince does not seem to me to be a person who could ever\nexperience disgrace.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098No, no,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 quickly replied his faithful friend; \u00e2\u0080\u0098of course I did not\nspeak of personal dishonour. He is extremely proud and rash, and not\nin any way a practical man; but he is not a person who ever would\ndo anything to be sent to the bagnio or the galleys. What I mean by\ndisgrace is, that he is mixed up with transactions, and connected with\npersons who will damage, cheapen, in a worldly sense dishonour him,\ndestroy all his sources of power and influence. For instance, now, in\nhis country, in England, a Jew is never permitted to enter England; they\nmay settle in Gibraltar, but in England, no. Well, it is perfectly well\nknown among all those who care about these affairs, that this enterprise\nof his, this religious-politico-military adventure, is merely undertaken\nbecause he happens to be desperately enamoured of a Jewess at Damascus,\nwhom he cannot carry home as his bride.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Enamoured of a Jewess at Damascus!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Astarte, turning pale.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098To folly, to frenzy; she is at the bottom of the whole of this affair;\nshe talks Cabala to him, and he Nazareny to her; and so, between them,\nthey have invented this grand scheme, the conquest of Asia, perhaps the\nworld, with our Syrian sabres, and we are to be rewarded for our pains\nby eating passover cakes.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098What are they?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Festival bread of the Hebrews, made in the new moon, with the milk of\nhe-goats.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098What horrors!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098What a reward for conquest!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Will the Queen of the English let one of her princes marry a Jewess?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Never; he will be beheaded, and she will be burnt alive, eventually;\nbut, in the meantime, a great deal of mischief may occur, unless we stop\nit.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098It certainly should be stopped.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098What amuses me most in this affair,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 continued Fakredeen, \u00e2\u0080\u0098is the cool\nway in which this Englishman comes to us for our assistance. First, he\nis at Canobia, then at Gindarics; we are to do the business, and Syria\nis spoken of as if it were nothing. Now the fact is, Syria is the only\npractical feature of the case. There is no doubt that, if we were all\nagreed, if Lebanon and the Ansarey were to unite, we could clear\nSyria of the Turks, conquer the plain, and carry the whole coast in\na campaign, and no one would ever interfere to disturb us. Why should\nthey? The Turks could not, and the natives of Fran-guestan would not.\nLeave me to manage them. There is nothing in the world I so revel in as\nhocus-sing Guizot and Aberdeen. You never heard of Guizot and Aberdeen?\nThey are the two Reis Effendis of the King of the French and the Queen\nof the English. I sent them an archbishop last year, one of my fellows,\nArchbishop Murad, who led them a pretty dance. They nearly made me King\nof the Lebanon, to put an end to disturbances which never existed except\nin the venerable Murad\u00e2\u0080\u0099s representations.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098These are strange things! Has she charms, this Jewess? Very beautiful,\nI suppose?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098The Englishman vows so; he is always raving of her; talks of her in his\nsleep.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098As you say, it would indeed be strange to draw our sabres for a Jewess.\nIs she dark or fair?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I think, when he writes verses to her, he always calls her a moon or a\nstar; that smacks nocturnal and somewhat sombre.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I detest the Jews; but I have heard their women are beautiful.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098We will banish them all from our kingdom of Syria,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Fakredeen,\nlooking at Astarte earnestly.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Why, if we are to make a struggle, it should be for something. There\nhave been Syrian kingdoms.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098And shall be, beauteous Queen, and you shall rule them. I believe now\nthe dream of my life will be realised.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Why, what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s that?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098My mother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s last aspiration, the dying legacy of her passionate soul,\nknown only to me, and never breathed to human being until this moment.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Then you recollect your mother?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098It was my nurse, long since dead, who was the depositary of the\ninjunction, and in due time conveyed it to me.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098And what was it?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098To raise, at Deir el Kamar, the capital of our district, a marble\ntemple to the Syrian goddess.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Beautiful idea!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098It would have drawn back the mountain to the ancient faith; the Druses\nare half-prepared, and wait only my word.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098But the Nazareny bishops,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said the Queen, \u00e2\u0080\u0098whom you find so useful,\nwhat will they say?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098What did the priests and priestesses of the Syrian goddess say, when\nSyria became Christian? They turned into bishops and nuns. Let them turn\nback again.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LV.\n\n     _Capture of a Harem_\n\nTANCRED and Fakredeen had been absent from Gindarics for two or three\ndays, making an excursion in the neighbouring districts, and visiting\nseveral of those chieftains whose future aid might be of much importance\nto them. Away from the unconscious centre of many passions and\nintrigues, excited by the novelty of their life, sanguine of the\nultimate triumph of his manoeuvres, and at times still influenced by\nhis companion, the demeanour of the young Emir of Lebanon to his friend\nresumed something of its wonted softness, confidence, and complaisance.\nThey were once more in sight of the wild palace-fort of Astarte;\nspurring their horses, they dashed before their attendants over the\nplain, and halted at the huge portal of iron, while the torches were\nlit, and preparations were made for the passage of the covered way.\n\nWhen they entered the principal court, there were unusual appearances\nof some recent and considerable occurrence: groups of Turkish soldiers,\ndisarmed, reclining camels, baggage and steeds, and many of the armed\ntribes of the mountain.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098What is all this?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 inquired Fakredeen.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098\u00e2\u0080\u0099Tis the harem of the Pasha of Aleppo,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 replied a warrior, \u00e2\u0080\u0098captured on\nthe plain, and carried up into the mountains to our Queen of queens.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098The war begins,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Fakredeen, looking round at Tancred with a\nglittering eye.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Women make war on women,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he replied.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098\u00e2\u0080\u0099Tis the first step,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said the Emir, dismounting; \u00e2\u0080\u0098I care not how it\ncomes. Women are at the bottom of everything. If it had not been for the\nSultana Mother, I should have now been Prince of the Mountain.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nWhen they had regained their apartments the lordly Keferinis soon\nappeared, to offer them his congratulations on their return. The\nminister was peculiarly refined and mysterious this morning, especially\nwith respect to the great event, which he involved in so much of\nobscurity, that, after much conversation, the travellers were as little\nacquainted with the occurrence as when they entered the courtyard of\nGindarics.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098The capture of a pasha\u00e2\u0080\u0099s harem is not water spilt on sand, lordly\nKeferinis,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said the Emir. \u00e2\u0080\u0098We shall hear more of this.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098What we shall hear,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 replied Keferinis, \u00e2\u0080\u0098is entirely an affair of the\nfuture; nor is it in any way to be disputed that there are few men who\ndo not find it more difficult to foretell what is to happen than to\nremember what has taken place.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098We sometimes find that memory is as rare a quality as prediction,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said\nTancred.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098In England,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 replied the lordly Keferinis; \u00e2\u0080\u0098but it is never to be\nforgotten, and indeed, on the contrary, should be entirely recollected,\nthat the English, being a new people, have nothing indeed which they can\nremember.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nTancred bowed.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098And how is the most gracious lady, Queen of queens?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 inquired\nFakredeen.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098The most gracious lady, Queen of queens,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 replied Keferinis, very\nmysteriously, \u00e2\u0080\u0098has at this time many thoughts.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098If she require any aid,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Fakredeen, \u00e2\u0080\u0098there is not a musket in\nLebanon that is not at her service.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nKeferinis bent his head, and said, \u00e2\u0080\u0098It is not in any way to be\ndisputed that there are subjects which require for their management\nthe application of a certain degree of force, and the noble Emir of\nthe Lebanon has expressed himself in that sense with the most\nexact propriety; there are also subjects which are regulated by the\napplication of a certain number of words, provided they were well\nchosen, and distinguished by an inestimable exactitude. It does not by\nany means follow that from what has occurred there will be sanguinary\nencounters between the people of the gracious lady, Queen of queens, and\nthose that dwell in plains and cities; nor can it be denied that war is\na means by which many things are brought to a final conjuncture. At the\nsame time courtesy has many charms, even for the Turks, though it is not\nto be denied, or in any way concealed, that a Turk, especially if he be\na pasha, is, of all obscene and utter children of the devil, the most\nentirely contemptible and thoroughly to be execrated.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098If I were the Queen, I would not give up the harem,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Fakredeen;\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098and I would bring affairs to a crisis. The garrison at Aleppo is not\nstrong; they have been obliged to march six regiments to Deir el Kamar,\nand, though affairs are comparatively tranquil in Lebanon for the\nmoment, let me send a pigeon to my cousin Francis El Kazin, and young\nSyria will get up such a stir that old Wageah Pasha will not spare a\nsingle man. I will have fifty bonfires on the mountain near Beiroot in\none night, and Colonel Rose will send off a steamer to Sir Canning to\ntell him there is a revolt in the Lebanon, with a double despatch for\nAberdeen, full of smoking villages and slaughtered women!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 and the young\nEmir inhaled his nargileh with additional zest as he recollected the\ntriumphs of his past mystifications.\n\nAt sunset it was announced to the travellers that the Queen would\nreceive them. Astarte appeared much gratified by their return, was very\ngracious, although in a different way, to both of them, inquired much\nas to what they had seen and what they had done, with whom they had\nconversed, and what had been said. At length she observed, \u00e2\u0080\u0098Something\nhas also happened at Gindarics in your absence, noble princes. Last\nnight they brought part of a harem of the Pasha of Aleppo captive\nhither. This may lead to events.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I have already ventured to observe to the lordly Keferinis,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said\nFakredeen, \u00e2\u0080\u0098that every lance in the Lebanon is at your command, gracious\nQueen.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098We have lances,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Astarte; \u00e2\u0080\u0098it is not of that I was thinking. Nor\nindeed do I care to prolong a quarrel for this capture. If the Pasha\nwill renounce the tribute of the villages, I am for peace; if he will\nnot, we will speak of those things of which there has been counsel\nbetween us. I do not wish this affair of the harem to be mixed up with\nwhat has preceded it. My principal captive is a most beautiful woman,\nand one, too, that greatly interests and charms me. She is not a Turk,\nbut, I apprehend, a Christian lady of the cities. She is plunged in\ngrief, and weeps sometimes with so much bitterness that I quite share\nher sorrow; but it is not so much because she is a captive, but because\nsome one, who is most dear to her, has been slain in this fray. I have\nvisited her, and tried to console her; and begged her to forget her\ngrief and become my companion. But nothing soothes her, and tears flow\nfor ever from eyes which are the most beautiful I ever beheld.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098This is the land of beautiful eyes,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Tancred, and Astarte almost\nunconsciously glanced at the speaker.\n\nCypros, who had quitted the attendant maidens immediately on the\nentrance of the two princes, after an interval, returned. There was\nsome excitement on her countenance as she approached her mistress, and\naddressed Astarte in a hushed but hurried tone. It seemed that the fair\ncaptive of the Queen of the Ansarey had most unexpectedly expressed to\nCypros her wish to repair to the divan of the Queen, although, the\nwhole day, she had frequently refused to descend. Cypros feared that the\npresence of the two guests of her mistress might prove an obstacle to\nthe fulfilment of this wish, as the freedom of social intercourse that\nprevailed among the Ansarey was unknown even among the ever-veiled women\nof the Maronites and Druses. But the fair captive had no prejudices on\nthis head, and Cypros had accordingly descended to request the royal\npermission, or consult the royal will. Astarte spoke to Keferinis, who\nlistened with an air of great profundity, and finally bowed assent, and\nCypros retired.\n\nAstarte had signified to Tancred her wish that he should approach her,\nwhile Keferinis at some distance was engaged in earnest conversation\nwith Fakredeen, with whom he had not had previously the opportunity of\nbeing alone. His report of all that had transpired in his absence was\nhighly favourable. The minister had taken the opportunity of the absence\nof the Emir and his friend to converse often and amply about them with\nthe Queen. The idea of an united Syria was pleasing to the imagination\nof the young sovereign. The suggestion was eminently practicable. It\nrequired no extravagant combinations, no hazardous chances of fortune,\nnor fine expedients of political skill. A union between Fakredeen and\nAstarte at once connected the most important interests of the mountains\nwithout exciting the alarm or displeasure of other powers. The union was\nas legitimate as it would ultimately prove irresistible. It ensured a\nrespectable revenue and a considerable force; and, with prudence and\nvigilance, the occasion would soon offer to achieve all the rest. On the\nnext paroxysm in the dissolving empire of the Ottomans, the plain would\nbe occupied by a warlike population descending from the mountains that\ncommanded on one side the whole Syrian coast, and on the other all the\ninland cities from Aleppo to Damascus.\n\nThe eye of the young Emir glittered with triumph as he listened to the\noily sentences of the eunuch. \u00e2\u0080\u0098Lebanon,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he whispered, \u00e2\u0080\u0098is the key of\nSyria, my Keferinis, never forget that; and we will lock up the land.\nLet us never sleep till this affair is achieved. You think she does not\ndream of a certain person, eh? I tell you, he must go, or we must get\nrid of him: I fear him not, but he is in the way; and the way should\nbe smooth as the waters of El Arish. Remember the temple to the Syrian\ngoddess at Deir el Kamar, my Keferinis! The religion is half the battle.\nHow I shall delight to get rid of my bishops and those accursed monks:\ndrones, drivellers, bigots, drinking my golden wine of Canobia, and\nsmoking my delicate Latakia. You know not Canobia, Keferinis; but you\nhave heard of it. You have been at Bted-deen? Well, Bteddeen to Canobia\nis an Arab moon to a Syrian sun. The marble alone at Canobia cost a\nmillion of piastres. The stables are worthy of the steeds of Solomon.\nYou may kill anything you like in the forest, from panthers to\nantelopes. Listen, my Keferinis, let this be done, and done quickly, and\nCanobia is yours.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Do you ever dream?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Astrate to Tancred. \u00e2\u0080\u0098They say that life is\na dream.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 \u00e2\u0080\u0098I sometimes wish it were. Its pangs are too acute for a\nshadow.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098But you have no pangs.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I had a dream when you were away, in which I was much alarmed,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said\nAstarte. \u00e2\u0080\u0098Indeed!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I thought that Gindarics was taken by the Jews. I suppose you have\ntalked of them to me so much that my slumbering memory wandered.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098It is a resistless and exhaustless theme,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Tancred; \u00e2\u0080\u0098for the\ngreatness and happiness of everything, Gindarics included, are comprised\nin the principles of which they were the first propagators.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Nevertheless, I should be sorry if my dream came to be true,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said\nAstarte.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098May your dreams be as bright and happy as your lot, royal lady!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said\nTancred.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098My lot is not bright and happy,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said the Queen; \u00e2\u0080\u0098once I thought it\nwas, but I think so no longer.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098But why?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I wish you could have a dream and find out,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said the Queen.\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Disquietude is sometimes as perplexing as pleasure. Both come and go\nlike birds.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Like the pigeon you sent to Damascus,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Tancred.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Ah! why did I send it?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Because you were most gracious, lady.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Because I was very rash, noble prince.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098When the great deeds are done to which this visit will lead, you will\nnot think so.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I am not born for great deeds; I am a woman, and I am content with\nbeautiful ones.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098You still dream of the Syrian goddess,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Tan-cred.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098No; not of the Syrian goddess. Tell me: they say the Hebrew women are\nvery lovely, is it so?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098They have that reputation.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098But do you think so?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I have known some distinguished for their beauty.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Do they resemble the statue in our temple?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Their style is different,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Tancred; \u00e2\u0080\u0098the Greek and the Hebrew are\nboth among the highest types of the human form.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098But you prefer the Hebrew?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I am not so discriminating a critic,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Tancred; \u00e2\u0080\u0098I admire the\nbeautiful.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Well, here comes my captive,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said the Queen; \u00e2\u0080\u0098if you like, you shall\nfree her, for she wonderfully takes me. She is a Georgian, I suppose,\nand bears the palm from all of us. I will not presume to contend with\nher: she would vanquish, perhaps, even that fair Jewess of whom, I hear,\nyou are so enamoured.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nTancred started, and would have replied, but Cypros advanced at this\nmoment with her charge, who withdrew her veil as she seated herself, as\ncommanded, before the Queen. She withdrew her veil, and Fakredeen and\nTancred beheld Eva!\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LVI.\n\n     _Eva a Captive_\n\nIN ONE of a series of chambers excavated in the mountains, yet connected\nwith the more artificial portion of the palace, chambers and galleries\nwhich in the course of ages had served for many purposes, sometimes\nof security, sometimes of punishment; treasuries not unfrequently, and\noccasionally prisons; in one of these vast cells, feebly illumined from\napertures above, lying on a rude couch with her countenance hidden,\nmotionless and miserable, was the beautiful daughter of Besso, one who\nhad been bred in all the delights of the most refined luxury, and in the\nenjoyment of a freedom not common in any land, and most rare among the\nEasterns.\n\nThe events of her life had been so strange and rapid during the last few\ndays that, even amid her woe, she revolved in her mind their startling\nimport. It was little more than ten days since, under the guardianship\nof her father, she had commenced her journey from Damascus to Aleppo.\nWhen they had proceeded about half way, they were met at the city of\nHorns by a detachment of Turkish soldiers, sent by the Pasha of Aleppo,\nat the request of Hillel Besso, to escort them, the country being much\ntroubled in consequence of the feud with the Ansarey. Notwithstanding\nthese precautions, and although, from the advices they received, they\ntook a circuitous and unexpected course, they were attacked by the\nmountaineers within half a day\u00e2\u0080\u0099s journey of Aleppo; and with so much\nstrength and spirit, that their guards, after some resistance, fled and\ndispersed, while Eva and her attendants, after seeing her father cut\ndown in her defence, was carried a prisoner to Gindarics.\n\nOverwhelmed by the fate of her father, she was at first insensible to\nher own, and was indeed so distracted that she delivered herself up to\ndespair. She was beginning in some degree to collect her senses, and to\nsurvey her position with some comparative calmness, when she learnt\nfrom the visit of Cypros that Fakredeen and Tancred were, by a strange\ncoincidence, under the same roof as herself. Then she recalled the kind\nsympathy and offers of consolation that had been evinced and proffered\nto her by the mistress of the castle, to whose expressions at the time\nshe had paid but an imperfect attention. Under these circumstances she\nearnestly requested permission to avail herself of a privilege, which\nhad been previously offered and refused, to become the companion, rather\nthan the captive, of the Queen of the Ansarey; so that she might find\nsome opportunity of communicating with her two friends, of inquiring\nabout her father, and of consulting with them as to the best steps to be\nadopted in her present exigency.\n\nThe interview, from which so much was anticipated, had turned out as\nstrange and as distressful as any of the recent incidents to which it\nwas to have brought balm and solace. Recognised instantly by Tancred and\nthe young Emir, and greeted with a tender respect, almost equal to the\nsurprise and sorrow which they felt at beholding her, Astarte, hitherto\nso unexpectedly gracious to her captive, appeared suddenly agitated,\nexcited, haughty, even hostile. The Queen had immediately summoned\nFakredeen to her side, and there passed between them some hurried and\nperturbed explanations; subsequently she addressed some inquiries to\nTancred, to which he replied without reserve. Soon afterwards, Astarte,\nremaining intent and moody, the court was suddenly broken up; Keferinis\nsignifying to the young men that they should retire, while Astarte,\nwithout bestowing on them her usual farewell, rose, and, followed by her\nmaidens, quitted the chamber. As for Eva, instead of returning to one of\nthe royal apartments which had been previously allotted to her, she was\nconducted to what was in fact a prison.\n\nThere she had passed the night and a portion of the ensuing day, visited\nonly by Cypros, who, when Eva would have inquired the cause of all this\nmysterious cruelty and startling contrast to the dispositions which had\npreceded it, only shook her head and pressed her finger to her lip, to\nsignify the impossibility of her conversing with her captive.\n\nIt was one of those situations where the most gifted are deserted by\ntheir intelligence; where there is as little to guide as to console;\nwhere the mystery is as vast as the misfortune; and the tortured\napprehension finds it impossible to grapple with irresistible\ncircumstances.\n\nIn this state, the daughter of Besso, plunged in a dark reverie, in\nwhich the only object visible to her mind\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eye was the last glance of\nher dying father, was roused from her approaching stupor by a sound,\ndistinct, yet muffled, as if some one wished to attract her attention,\nwithout startling her by too sudden an interruption. She looked up;\nagain she heard the sound, and then, in a whispered tone, her name----\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Eva!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I am here.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Hush!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said a figure, stealing into the caverned chamber, and then\nthrowing off his Syrian cloak, revealing to her one whom she recognised.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Fakredeen,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 she said, starting from her couch, \u00e2\u0080\u0098what is all this?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nThe countenance of Fakredeen was distressed and agitated; there was an\nexpression of alarm, almost of terror, stamped upon his features.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098You must follow me,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he said; \u00e2\u0080\u0098there is not a moment to lose; you must\nfly!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Why and whither?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Eva. \u00e2\u0080\u0098This capture is one of plunder not of\nmalice, or was so a few hours back. It is not sorrow for myself that\noverwhelmed me. But yesterday, the sovereign of these mountains treated\nme with a generous sympathy, and, if it brought me no solace, it was\nonly because events have borne, I fear, irremediable woe. And now I\nsuddenly find myself among my friends; friends, who, of all others, I\nshould most have wished to encounter at this moment, and all is changed.\nI am a prisoner, under every circumstance of harshness, even of cruelty,\nand you speak to me as if my life, my immediate existence, was in\nperil.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098It is.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098But why?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nFakredeen wrung his hands, and murmured, \u00e2\u0080\u0098Let us go.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I scarcely care to live,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Eva; \u00e2\u0080\u0098and I will not move until you give\nme some clue to all this mystery.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Well, then, she is jealous of you; the Queen, Astarte; she is jealous\nof you with the English prince, that man who has brought us all so many\nvexations.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 \u00e2\u0080\u0098Is it he that has brought us so many vexations?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 replied\nEva. \u00e2\u0080\u0098The Queen jealous of me, and with the English prince! \u00e2\u0080\u0098Tis very\nstrange. We scarcely exchanged a dozen sentences together, when all was\ndisturbed and broken up. Jealous of me! Why, then, was she anxious that\nI should descend to her divan? This is not the truth, Fakredeen.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Not all; but it is the truth; it is, indeed. The Queen is jealous of\nyou: she is in love with Tancred; a curse be on him and her both! and\nsomebody has told her that Tancred is in love with you.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 \u00e2\u0080\u0098Somebody! When\ndid they tell her?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 \u00e2\u0080\u0098Long ago; long ago. She knew, that is, she had been\ntold, that Tancred was affianced to the daughter of Besso of Damascus;\nand so this sudden meeting brought about a crisis. I did what I could\nto prevent it; vowed that you were only the cousin of the Besso that she\nmeant; did everything, in short, I could to serve and save you; but it\nwas of no use. She was wild, is wild, and your life is in peril.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nEva mused a moment. Then, looking up, she said, \u00e2\u0080\u0098Fakredeen, it is you\nwho told the Queen this story. You are the somebody who has invented\nthis fatal falsehood. What was your object I care not to inquire,\nknowing full well, that, if you had an object, you never would spare\nfriend or foe. Leave me. I have little wish to live; but I believe in\nthe power of truth. I will confront the Queen and tell her all. She will\ncredit what I say; if she do not, I can meet my fate; but I will not,\nnow or ever, entrust it to you.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nThereupon Fakredeen burst into a flood of passionate tears, and,\nthrowing himself on the ground, kissed Eva\u00e2\u0080\u0099s feet, and clung to her\ngarments which he embraced, sobbing, and moaning, and bestowing on her\nendless phrases of affection, mixed with imprecations on his own head\nand conduct.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098O Eva! my beloved Eva, sister of my soul, it is of no use telling you\nany lies! Yes, I am that villain and that idiot who has brought about\nall this misery, misery enough to turn me mad, and which, by a just\nretribution, has destroyed all the brilliant fortunes which were at last\nopening on me. This Frank stranger was the only bar to my union with\nthe sovereign of these mountains, whose beauty you have witnessed, whose\npower, combined with my own, would found a kingdom. I wished to marry\nher. You cannot be angry with me, Eva, for that. You know very well\nthat, if you had married me yourself, we should neither of us have been\nin the horrible situation in which we now find ourselves. Ah! that would\nhave been a happy union! But let that pass. I have always been the most\nunfortunate of men; I have never had justice done me. Well, she loved\nthis prince of Franguestan. I saw it; nothing escapes me. I let her know\nthat he was devoted to another. Why I mentioned your name I cannot\nwell say; perhaps because it was the first that occurred to me; perhaps\nbecause I have a lurking suspicion that he really does love you. The\ninformation worked.\n\nMy own suit prospered. I bribed her minister. He is devoted to me. All\nwas smiling. How could I possibly have anticipated that you would ever\narrive here! When I saw you, I felt that all was lost. I endeavoured to\nrally affairs, but it was useless. Tan-cred has no finesse; his replies\nneutralised, nay, destroyed, all my counter representations. The Queen\nis a whirlwind. She is young; she has never been crossed in her life.\nYou cannot argue with her when her heart is touched. In short, all is\nruined;\u00e2\u0080\u0099 and Fakredeen hid his weeping face in the robes of Eva. \u00e2\u0080\u0098What\nmisery you prepare for yourself, and for all who know you!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 exclaimed\nEva. \u00e2\u0080\u0098But that has happened which makes me insensible to further grief.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Yes; but listen to what I say, and all will go right. I do not care in\nthe least for my own disappointment. That now is nothing. It is you,\nit is of you only that I think, whom I wish to save. Do not chide me:\npardon me, pardon me, as you have done a thousand times; pardon and pity\nme. I am so young and really so inexperienced; after all, I am only\na child; besides, I have not a friend in the world except you. I am a\nvillain, a fool; all villains are. I know it. But I cannot help it. I\ndid not make myself. The question now is, How are we to get out of this\nscrape? How are we to save your life?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Do you really mean, Fakredeen, that my life is in peril?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Yes, I do,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said the Emir, crying like a child.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098You do not know the power of truth, Fakredeen. You have no confidence\nin it. Let me see the Queen.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Impossible!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he said, starting up, and looking very much alarmed.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Why?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Because, in the first place, she is mad. Keferinis, that is, her\nminister, one of my creatures, and the only person who can manage\nher, told me this moment that it was a perfect Kamsin, and that, if he\napproached her again, it would be at his own risk; and, in the second\nplace, bad as things are, they would necessarily be much worse if she\nsaw you, because (and it is of no use concealing it any longer) she\nthinks you already dead.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Dead! Already dead!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Yes.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098And where is your friend and companion?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Eva. \u00e2\u0080\u0098Does he know of\nthese horrors?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098No one knows of them except myself. The Queen sent for me last night to\nspeak to me of the subject generally. It was utterly vain to attempt to\ndisabuse her; it would only have compromised all of us. She would only\nhave supposed the truth to be an invention for the moment. I found your\nfate sealed. In my desperation, the only thing that occurred to me was\nto sympathise with her indignation and approve of all her projects. She\napprised me that you should not live four-and-twenty hours. I rather\nstimulated her vengeance, told her in secresy that your house had nearly\neffected my ruin, and that there was no sacrifice I would not make,\nand no danger that I would not encounter, to wreak on your race my\nlong-cherished revenge. I assured her that I had been watching my\nopportunity for years. Well, you see how it is, Eva; she consigned to me\nthe commission which she would have whispered to one of her slaves. I am\nhere with her cognisance; indeed, by this time she thinks \u00e2\u0080\u0098tis all over.\nYou comprehend?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098You are to be my executioner?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Yes; I have undertaken that office in order to save your life.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I care not to save my life. What is life to me, since he perhaps is\ngone who gave me that life, and for whom alone I lived!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098O Eva! Eva! don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t distract me; don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t drive me absolutely mad! When a\nman is doing what I am for your sake, giving up a kingdom, and more\nthan a kingdom, to treat him thus! But you never did me justice.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 And\nFakredeen poured forth renewed tears. \u00e2\u0080\u0098Keferinis is in my pay; I have\ngot the signet of the covered way. Here are two Mamlouk dresses; one\nyou must put on. \u00e2\u0080\u0098Without the gates are two good steeds, and in\neight-and-forty hours we shall be safe, and smiling again.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I shall never smile again,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Eva. \u00e2\u0080\u0098No, Fakredeen,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 she added, after\na moment\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pause, \u00e2\u0080\u0098I will not fly, and you cannot fly. Can you leave\nalone in this wild place that friend, too faithful, I believe, whom you\nhave been the means of leading hither?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Never mind him,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said the Emir. \u00e2\u0080\u0098I wish we had never seen him. He is\nquite safe. She may keep him a prisoner perhaps. What then? He makes\nso discreet a use of his liberty that a little durance will not be very\ninjurious. His life will be safe enough. Cutting off his head is not\nthe way to gain his heart. But time presses. Come, my sister, my beloved\nEva! In a few hours it may not be in my power to effect all this. Come,\nthink of your father, of his anxiety, his grief. One glimpse of you will\ndo him more service than the most cunning leech.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nEva burst into passionate tears. \u00e2\u0080\u0098He will never see us again. I saw him\nfall; never shall I forget that moment!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 and she hid her face in her\nhands.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098But he lives,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Fakredeen. \u00e2\u0080\u0098I have been speaking to some of the\nTurkish prisoners. They also saw him fall; but he was borne off the\nfield, and, though insensible, it was believed that the wound was not\nfatal. Trust me, he is at Aleppo.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 \u00e2\u0080\u0098They saw him borne off the field?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Safe, and, if not well, far from desperate.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 \u00e2\u0080\u0098O God of my fathers!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\nsaid Eva, falling on her knees; \u00e2\u0080\u0098thine is indeed a mercy-seat!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Yes, yes; there is nothing like the God of your fathers, Eva. If you\nknew the things that are going on in this place, even in these vaults\nand caverns, you would not tarry here an instant. They worship nothing\nbut graven images, and the Queen has fallen in love with Tancred,\nbecause he resembles a marble statue older than the times of the\npre-Adamite Sultans. Come, come!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098But how could they know that he was far from desperate?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I will show you the man who spoke to him,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Fakredeen; \u00e2\u0080\u0098he is only\nwith our horses. You can ask him any questions you like. Come, put on\nyour Mamlouk dress, every minute is golden.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098There seems to me something base in leaving him here alone,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Eva.\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098He has eaten our salt, he is the child of our tents, his blood will be\nupon our heads.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Well, then, fly for his sake,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Fakredeen; \u00e2\u0080\u0098here you cannot aid\nhim; but when you are once in safety, a thousand things may be done for\nhis assistance. I could return, for example.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Now, Fakredeen,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Eva, stopping him, and speaking in a solemn tone,\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098if I accompany you, as you now require, will you pledge me your word,\nthat the moment we pass the frontier you will return to him.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I swear it, by our true religion, and by my hopes of an earthly crown.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LVII.\n\n     _Message of the Pasha_\n\nTHE sudden apparition of Eva at Gindarics, and the scene of painful\nmystery by which it was followed, had plunged Tancred into the greatest\nanxiety and affliction. It was in vain that, the moment they had quitted\nthe presence of Astarte, he appealed to Fakredeen for some explanation\nof what had occurred, and for some counsel as to the course they should\nimmediately pursue to assist one in whose fate they were both so deeply\ninterested. The Emir, for the first time since their acquaintance,\nseemed entirely to have lost himself. He looked perplexed, almost\nstunned; his language was incoherent, his gestures those of despair.\nTancred, while he at once ascribed all this confused demeanour to the\nshock which he had himself shared at finding the daughter of Besso a\ncaptive, and a captive under circumstances of doubt and difficulty,\ncould not reconcile such distraction, such an absence of all resources\nand presence of mind, with the exuberant means and the prompt expedients\nwhich in general were the characteristics of his companion, under\ncircumstances the most difficult and unforeseen.\n\nWhen they had reached their apartments, Fakredeen threw himself upon\nthe divan and moaned, and, suddenly starting from the couch, paced the\nchamber with agitated step, wringing his hands. All that Tan-cred could\nextract from him was an exclamation of despair, an imprecation on his\nown head, and an expression of fear and horror at Eva having fallen into\nthe hands of pagans and idolaters.\n\nIt was in vain also that Tancred endeavoured to communicate with\nKeferinis. The minister was invisible, not to be found, and the night\nclosed in, when Tancred, after fruitless counsels with Baroni, and many\nunited but vain efforts to open some communication with Eva, delivered\nhimself not to repose, but to a distracted reverie over the present\nharassing and critical affairs.\n\nWhen the dawn broke, he rose and sought Fakredeen, but, to his surprise,\nhe found that his companion had already quitted his apartment. An\nunusual stillness seemed to pervade Gindarics this day; not a person\nwas visible. Usually at sunrise all were astir, and shortly afterwards\nKeferinis generally paid a visit to the guests of his sovereign; but\nthis day Keferinis omitted the ceremony, and Tancred, never more anxious\nfor companions and counsellors, found himself entirely alone; for Baroni\nwas about making observations, and endeavouring to find some clue to the\nposition of Eva.\n\nTancred had resolved, the moment that it was practicable, to solicit\nan audience of Astarte on the subject of Eva, and to enter into all\nthe representations respecting her which, in his opinion, were alone\nnecessary to secure for her immediately the most considerate treatment,\nand ultimately a courteous release.\n\nThe very circumstance that she was united to the Emir of Canobia by ties\nso dear and intimate, and was also an individual to whom he himself was\nindebted for such generous aid and such invaluable services, would,\nhe of course assumed, independently of her own interesting personal\nqualities, enlist the kind feelings of Astarte in her favour. The\ndifficulty was to obtain this audience of Astarte, for neither Fakredeen\nnor Keferinis was to be found, and no other means of achieving the\nresult were obvious.\n\nAbout two hours before noon, Baroni brought word that he had contrived\nto see Cypros, from whom he gathered that Astarte had repaired to the\ngreat temple of the gods. Instantly, Tancred resolved to enter the\npalace, and if possible to find his way to the mysterious sanctuary.\nThat was a course by no means easy; but the enterprising are often\nfortunate, and his project proved not to be impossible. He passed\nthrough the chambers of the palace, which were entirely deserted, and\nwith which he was familiar, and he reached without difficulty the portal\nof bronze, which led to the covered way that conducted to the temple,\nbut it was closed. Baffled and almost in despair, a distant chorus\nreached his ear, then the tramp of feet, and then slowly the portal\nopened. He imagined that the Queen was returning; but, on the contrary,\npages and women and priests swept by without observing him, for he was\nhidden by one of the opened valves, but Astarte was not there; and,\nthough the venture was rash, Tancred did not hesitate, as the last\nindividual in the procession moved on, to pass the gate. The portal\nshut instantly with a clang, and Tancred found himself alone and in\ncomparative darkness. His previous experience, however, sustained him.\nHis eye, fresh from the sunlight, at first wandered in obscurity, but\nby degrees, habituated to the atmosphere, though dim, the way was\nsufficiently indicated, and he advanced, till the light became each step\nmore powerful, and soon he emerged upon the platform, which faced the\nmountain temple at the end of the ravine: a still and wondrous scene,\nmore striking now, if possible, when viewed alone, with his heart the\nprey of many emotions. How full of adventure is life! It is monotonous\nonly to the monotonous. There may be no longer fiery dragons, magic\nrings, or fairy wands, to interfere in its course and to influence our\ncareer; but the relations of men are far more complicated and numerous\nthan of yore; and in the play of the passions, and in the devices of\ncreative spirits, that have thus a proportionately greater sphere for\ntheir action, there are spells of social sorcery more potent than all\nthe necromancy of Merlin or Friar Bacon.\n\nTancred entered the temple, the last refuge of the Olympian mind. It was\nrace that produced these inimitable forms, the idealised reflex of\ntheir own peculiar organisation. Their principles of art, practised by a\ndifferent race, do not produce the same results. Yet we shut our eyes to\nthe great truth into which all truths merge, and we call upon the Pict,\nor the Sarmatian, to produce the forms of Phidias and Praxiteles.\n\nNot devoid of that awe which is caused by the presence of the solemn\nand the beautiful, Tancred slowly traced his steps through the cavern\nsanctuary. No human being was visible. Upon his right was the fane to\nwhich Astarte led him on his visit of initiation. He was about to enter\nit, when, kneeling before the form of the Apollo of Antioch, he beheld\nthe fair Queen of the Ansarey, motionless and speechless, her arms\ncrossed upon her breast, and her eyes fixed upon her divinity, in a\ndream of ecstatic devotion.\n\nThe splendour of the ascending sun fell full upon the statue, suffusing\nthe ethereal form with radiancy, and spreading around it for some space\na broad and golden halo. As Tancred, recognising the Queen, withdrew a\nfew paces, his shadow, clearly defined, rested on the glowing wall of\nthe rock temple. Astarte uttered an exclamation, rose quickly from\nher kneeling position, and, looking round, her eyes met those of Lord\nMontacute. Instantly she withdrew her gaze, blushing deeply.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I was about to retire,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 murmured Tancred.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098And why should you retire?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Astarte, in a soft voice, looking up.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098There are moments when solitude is sacred.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I am too much alone: often, and of late especially, I feel a painful\nisolation.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nShe moved forward, and they re-entered together the chief temple, and\nthen emerged into the sunlight. They stood beneath the broad Ionic\nportico, beholding the strange scene around. Then it was that Tancred,\nobserving that Astarte cared not to advance, and deeming the occasion\nvery favourable to his wishes, proceeded to explain to her the cause\nof his venturing to intrude on her this morning. He spoke with that\nearnestness, and, if the phrase may be used, that passionate repose,\nwhich distinguished him. He enlarged on the character of Besso, his\ngreat virtues, his amiable qualities, his benevolence and unbounded\ngenerosity; he sought in every way to engage the kind feelings of\nAstarte in favour of his family, and to interest her in the character of\nEva, on which he dilated with all the eloquence of his heart. Truly, he\nalmost did justice to her admirable qualities, her vivid mind, and lofty\nspirit, and heroic courage; the occasion was too delicate to treat of\nthe personal charms of another woman, but he did not conceal his own\ndeep sense of obligation to Eva for her romantic expedition to the\ndesert in his behalf.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098You can understand then,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 concluded Tancred, \u00e2\u0080\u0098what must have been my\nastonishment and grief when I found her yesterday a captive. It was\nsome consolation to me to remember in whose power she had fallen, and I\nhasten to throw myself at your feet to supplicate for her safety and her\nfreedom.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Yes, I can understand all this,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Astarte, in a low tone.\n\nTancred looked at her. Her voice had struck him with pain; her\ncountenance still more distressed him. Nothing could afford a more\ncomplete contrast to the soft and glowing visage that a few moments\nbefore he had beheld in the fane of Apollo. She was quite pale, almost\nlivid; her features, of exquisite shape, had become hard and even\ndistorted; all the bad passions of our nature seemed suddenly to have\nconcentred in that face which usually combined perfect beauty of form\nwith an expression the most gentle, and in truth most lovely.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Yes, I can understand all this,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Astarte, \u00e2\u0080\u0098but I shall not\nexercise any power which I may possess to assist you in violating the\nlaws of your country, and outraging the wishes of your sovereign.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Violating the laws of my country!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 exclaimed Tancred, with a perplexed\nlook.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Yes, I know all. Your schemes truly are very heroic and very flattering\nto our self-love. We are to lend our lances to place on the throne of\nSyria one who would not be permitted to reside in your own country, much\nless to rule in it?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Of whom, of what, do you speak?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I speak of the Jewess whom you would marry,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Astarte, in a hushed\nyet distinct voice, and with a fell glance, \u00e2\u0080\u0098against all laws, divine\nand human.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Of your prisoner?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Well you may call her my prisoner; she is secure.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Is it possible you can believe that I even am a suitor of the daughter\nof Besso?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Tancred, earnestly. \u00e2\u0080\u0098I wear the Cross, which is graven\non my heart, and have a heavenly mission to fulfil, from which no\nearthly thought shall ever distract me. But even were I more than\nsensible to her charms and virtues, she is affianced, or the same as\naffianced; nor have I the least reason to suppose that he who will\npossess her hand does not command her heart.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Affianced?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Not only affianced, but, until this sad adventure, on the very point of\nbeing wedded. She was on her way from Damascus to Aleppo, to be united\nto her cousin, when she was brought hither, where she will, I trust, not\nlong remain your prisoner.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nThe countenance of Astarte changed; but, though it lost its painful and\nvindictive expression, it did not assume one of less distress. After a\nmoment\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pause, she murmured, \u00e2\u0080\u0098Can this be true?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Who could have told you otherwise?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098An enemy of hers, of her family,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 continued Astarte, in a low voice,\nand speaking as if absorbed in thought; \u00e2\u0080\u0098one who admitted to me his\nlong-hoarded vengeance against her house.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nThen turning abruptly, she looked Tancred full in the face, with a\nglance of almost fierce scrutiny. His clear brow and unfaltering eye,\nwith an expression of sympathy and even kindness on his countenance, met\nher searching look.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098No,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 she said; \u00e2\u0080\u0098it is impossible that you can be false.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Why should I be false? or what is it that mixes up my name and life\nwith these thoughts and circumstances?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Why should you be false? Ah! there it is,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Astarte, in a sweet and\nmournful voice. \u00e2\u0080\u0098What are any of us to you!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 And she wept.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098It grieves me to see you in sorrow,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Tancred, approaching her, and\nspeaking in a tone of kindness.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I am more than sorrowful: this unhappy lady----\u00e2\u0080\u0099 and the voice of\nAstarte was overpowered by her emotion.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098You will send her back in safety and with honour to her family,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said\nTancred, soothingly. \u00e2\u0080\u0098I would fain believe her father has not fallen.\nMy intendant assures me that there are Turkish soldiers here who saw him\nborne from the field. A little time, and their griefs will vanish. You\nwill have the satisfaction of having acted with generosity, with that\ngood heart which characterises you; and as for the daughter of Besso,\nall will be forgotten as she gives one hand to her father and the other\nto her husband.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098It is too late,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Astarte in an almost sepulchral voice.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098What is that?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098It is too late! The daughter of Besso is no more.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Jesu preserve us!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 exclaimed Tancred, starting. \u00e2\u0080\u0098Speak it again: what\nis it that you say?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nAstarte shook her head.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Woman!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Tancred, and he seized her hand, but his thoughts were too\nwild for utterance, and he remained pallid and panting.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098The daughter of Besso is no more; and I do not lament it, for you loved\nher.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Oh, grief ineffable!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Tancred, with a groan, looking up to heaven,\nand covering his face with his hands: \u00e2\u0080\u0098I loved her, as I loved the stars\nand sunshine.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Then, after a pause, he turned to Astarte, and said, in a\nrapid voice, \u00e2\u0080\u0098This dreadful deed; when, how, did it happen?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Is it so dreadful?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Almost as dreadful as such words from woman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lips. A curse be on the\nhour that I entered these walls!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098No, no, no!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Astarte, and she seized his arm distractedly. \u00e2\u0080\u0098No,\nno! No curse!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098It is not true!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Tancred. \u00e2\u0080\u0098It cannot be true! She is not dead.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Would she were not, if her death is to bring me curses.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Tell me when was this?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098An hour ago, at least.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I do not believe it. There is not an arm that would have dared to touch\nher. Let us hasten to her. It is not too late.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Alas! it is too late,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Astarte. \u00e2\u0080\u0098It was an enemy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s arm that\nundertook the deed.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098An enemy! What enemy among your people could the daughter of Besso have\nfound?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098A deadly one, who seized the occasion offered to a long cherished\nvengeance; one who for years has been alike the foe and the victim of\nher race and house. There is no hope!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I am indeed amazed. Who could this be?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Your friend; at least, your supposed friend, the Emir of the Lebanon.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Fakredeen?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098You have said it.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098The assassin and the foe of Eva!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 exclaimed Tancred, with a\ncountenance relieved yet infinitely perplexed. \u00e2\u0080\u0098There must be some great\nmisconception in all this. Let us hasten to the castle.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098He solicited the office,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Astarte; \u00e2\u0080\u0098he wreaked his vengeance,\nwhile he vindicated my outraged feelings.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098By murdering his dearest friend, the only being to whom he is really\ndevoted, his more than friend, his foster-sister, nursed by the same\nheart; the ally and inspiration of his life, to whom he himself was a\nsuitor, and might have been a successful one, had it not been for the\ncustom of her religion and her race, which shrink from any connection\nwith strangers and with Nazarenes.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098His foster-sister!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 exclaimed Astarte.\n\nAt this moment Cypros appeared in the distance, hastening to Astarte\nwith an agitated air. Her looks were disturbed; she was almost\nbreathless when she reached them; she wrung her hands before she spoke.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Royal lady!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 at length she said, \u00e2\u0080\u0098I hastened, as you instructed me,\nat the appointed hour, to the Emir Fakredeen, but I learnt that he had\nquitted the castle.\n\nThen I repaired to the prisoner; but, woe is me! she is not to be\nfound.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Not to be found!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098The raiment that she wore is lying on the floor of her prison. Methinks\nshe has fled.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098She has fled with him who was false to us all,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Astarte, \u00e2\u0080\u0098for it\nwas the Emir of the Lebanon who long ago told me that you were affianced\nto the daughter of Besso, and who warned me against joining in any\nenterprise which was only to place upon the throne of Syria one whom the\nlaws of your own country would never recognise as your wife.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Intriguer!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Tancred. \u00e2\u0080\u0098Vile and inveterate intriguer!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098It is well,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Astarte. \u00e2\u0080\u0098My spirit is more serene.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Would that Eva were with any one else!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Tancred, thoughtfully, and\nspeaking, as it were, to himself.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Your thoughts are with the daughter of Besso,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Astarte. \u00e2\u0080\u0098You wish\nto follow her, to guard her, to restore her to her family.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nTancred looked round and caught the glance of the Queen of the Ansarey,\nmortified, yet full of affection.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098It seems to me,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he said, \u00e2\u0080\u0098that it is time for me to terminate a visit\nthat has already occasioned you, royal lady, too much vexation.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nAstarte burst into tears.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Let me go,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 she said, \u00e2\u0080\u0098you want a throne; this is a rude one, yet\naccept it. You require warriors, the Ansarey are invincible. My castle\nis not like those palaces of Antioch of which we have often talked, and\nwhich were worthy of you, but Gindarics is impregnable, and will serve\nyou for your headquarters until you conquer that world which you are\nborn to command.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I have been the unconscious agent in petty machinations,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Tancred.\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I must return to the desert to recover the purity of my mind. It is\nArabia alone that can regenerate the world.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nAt this moment Cypros, who was standing apart, waved her scarf, and\nexclaimed, \u00e2\u0080\u0098Royal lady, I perceive in the distance the ever-faithful\nmessenger;\u00e2\u0080\u0099 whereupon Astarte looked up, and, as yet invisible to the\ninexperienced glance of Tancred, recognised what was an infinitely small\ndusky speck, each moment becoming more apparent, until at length a bird\nwas observed by all of them winging its way towards the Queen.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Is it the ever-faithful Karaguus,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Astarte; \u00e2\u0080\u0098or is it Ruby-lips\nthat ever brings good news?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098It is Karaguus,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Cypros, as the bird drew nearer and nearer; \u00e2\u0080\u0098but\nit is not Karaguus of Damascus. By the ring on its neck, it is Karaguus\nof Aleppo.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nThe pigeon now was only a few yards above the head of the Queen.\nFatigued, but with an eye full of resolution, it fluttered for a moment,\nand then fell upon her bosom. Cypros advanced and lifted its weary wing,\nand untied the cartel which it bore, brief words, but full of meaning,\nand a terrible interest.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098The Pasha, at the head of five thousand regular troops, leaves Haleb\nto-morrow to invade our land.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Go,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Astarte to Tancred; \u00e2\u0080\u0098to remain here is now dangerous. Thanks\nto the faithful messenger, you have time to escape with ease from that\nland which you scorned to rule, and which loved you too well.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I cannot leave it in the hour of peril,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Tancred. \u00e2\u0080\u0098This invasion\nof the Ottomans may lead to results of which none dream. I will meet\nthem at the head of your warriors!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LVIII.\n\n     _Three Letters of Cabala_\n\nIS THERE any news?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 asked Adam Besso of Issachar, the son of Selim, the\nmost cunning leech at Aleppo, and who by day and by night watched the\ncouch which bore the suffering form of the pride and mainstay of the\nSyrian Hebrews.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098There is news, but it has not yet arrived,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 replied Issachar, the son\nof Selim, a man advanced in life, but hale, with a white beard, a bright\neye, and a benignant visage.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098There are pearls in the sea, but what are they worth?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 murmured Besso.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I have taken a Cabala,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Issachar, the son of Selim, \u00e2\u0080\u0098and three\ntimes that I opened the sacred book, there were three words, and the\ninitial letter of each word is the name of a person who will enter this\nroom this day, and every person will bring news.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098But what news?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 sighed Besso. \u00e2\u0080\u0098The news of Tophet and of ten thousand\ndemons?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I have taken a Cabala,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Issachar, the son of Selim, \u00e2\u0080\u0098and the news\nwill be good.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098To whom and from whom? Good to the Pasha, but not to me! good to the\npeople of Haleb, but not, perhaps, to the family of Besso.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098God will guard over his own. In the meanwhile, I must replace this\nbandage, noble Besso. Let me rest your arm upon this cushion and you\nwill endure less pain.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Alas! worthy Issachar, I have wounds deeper than any you can probe.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nThe resignation peculiar to the Orientals had sustained Besso under\nhis overwhelming calamity. He neither wailed nor moaned. Absorbed in a\nbrooding silence, he awaited the result of the measures which had been\ntaken for the release of Eva, sustained by the chance of success, and\ncaring not to survive if encountering failure. The Pasha of Aleppo, long\nirritated by the Ansarey, and meditating for some time an invasion of\ntheir country, had been fired by the all-influential representations of\nthe family of Besso instantly to undertake a step which, although it had\nbeen for some time contemplated, might yet, according to Turkish\ncustom, have been indefinitely postponed. Three regiments of the line,\ndisciplined in the manner of Europe, some artillery, and a strong\ndetachment of cavalry, had been ordered at once to invade the contiguous\nterritory of the Ansarey. Hillel Besso had accompanied the troops,\nleaving his uncle under his paternal roof, disabled by his late\nconflict, but suffering from wounds which in themselves were serious\nrather than perilous.\n\nFour days had elapsed since the troops had quitted Aleppo. It was\nthe part of Hillel, before they had recourse to hostile movements, to\nobtain, if possible, the restoration of the prisoners by fair means; nor\nwere any resources wanting to effect this purpose. A courier had arrived\nat Aleppo from Hillel, apprising Adam Besso that the Queen of the\nAnsarey had not only refused to give up the prisoners, but even declared\nthat Eva had been already released; but Hillel concluded that this\nwas merely trifling. This parleying had taken place on the border; the\ntroops were about to force the passes on the following day.\n\nAbout an hour before sunset, on the very same day that Issachar, the son\nof Selim, had taken more than one Cabala, some horsemen, in disorder,\nwere observed from the walls by the inhabitants of Aleppo, galloping\nover the plain. They were soon recognised as the cavalry of the Pasha,\nthe irregular heralds, it was presumed, of a triumph achieved. Hillel\nBesso, covered with sweat and dust, was among those who thus early\narrived. He hastened at a rapid pace through the suburb of the city,\nscattering random phrases to those who inquired after intelligence as he\npassed, until he reached the courtyard of his own house.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098\u00e2\u0080\u0099Tis well,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he observed, as he closed the gate. \u00e2\u0080\u0098A battle is a fine\nthing, but, for my part, I am not sorry to find myself at home.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098What is that?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 inquired Adam Besso, as a noise reached his ear.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098\u00e2\u0080\u0099Tis the letter of the first Cabala,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 replied Issachar, the son of\nSelim.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Uncle, it is I,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Hillel, advancing.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Speak,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Adam Besso, in an agitated voice; \u00e2\u0080\u0098my sight is dark.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Alas, I am alone!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Hillel.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Bury me in Jehoshaphat,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 murmured Besso, as he sank back.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098But, my uncle, there is hope.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Speak, then, of hope,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 replied Besso, with sudden vehemence, and\nstarting from his pillow.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Truly I have seen a child of the mountains, who persists in the tale\nthat our Eva has escaped.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098An enemy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s device! Are the mountains ours? Where are the troops?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Were the mountains ours, I should not be here, my uncle. Look from the\nramparts, and you will soon see the plain covered with the troops, at\nleast with all of them who have escaped the matchlocks and the lances of\nthe Ansarey.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Are they such sons of fire?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098When the Queen of the Ansarey refused to deliver up the prisoners, and\ndeclared that Eva was not in her power, the Pasha resolved to penetrate\nthe passes, in two detachments, on the following morning. The enemy\nwas drawn up in array to meet us, but fled after a feeble struggle.\nOur artillery seemed to carry all before it. But,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 continued Hillel,\nshrugging his shoulders, \u00e2\u0080\u0098war is not by any means a commercial\ntransaction. It seemed that, when we were on the point of victory,\nwe were in fact entirely defeated. The enemy had truly made a feigned\ndefence, and had only allured us into the passes, where they fired on\nus from the heights, and rolled down upon our confused masses huge\nfragments of rock. Our strength, our numbers, and our cannon, only\nembarrassed us; there arose a confusion; the troops turned and\nretreated. And, when everything was in the greatest perplexity, and we\nwere regaining the plain, our rear was pursued by crowds of cavalry,\nKurds, and other Giaours, who destroyed our men with their long lances,\nuttering horrible shouts. For my own part, I thought all was over, but\na good horse is not a bad thing, and I am here, my uncle, having ridden\nfor twenty hours, nearly, without a pause.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098And when did you see this child of the mountains who spoke of the lost\none?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 asked Besso, in a low and broken voice.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098On the eve of the engagement,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Hillel. \u00e2\u0080\u0098He had been sent to me\nwith a letter, but, alas! had been plundered on his way by our troops,\nand the letter had been destroyed or lost. Nevertheless, he induced them\nto permit him to reach my tent, and brought these words, that the ever\nadorable had truly quitted the mountains, and that the lost letter had\nbeen written to that effect by the chieftain of the Ansarey.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Is there yet hope! What sound is that?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098\u00e2\u0080\u0099Tis the letter of the second Cabala,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Issachar, the son of Selim.\n\nAnd at this moment entered the chamber a faithful slave, who made signs\nto the physician, upon which Issachar rose, and was soon engaged in\nearnest conversation with him who had entered, Hillel tending the side\nof Besso. After a few minutes, Issachar approached the couch of his\npatient, and said, \u00e2\u0080\u0098Here is one, my lord and friend, who brings good\ntidings of your daughter.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098God of my fathers!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 exclaimed Besso, passionately, and springing up.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Still, we must be calm,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Issachar; \u00e2\u0080\u0098still, we must be calm.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Let me see him,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Besso.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098It is one you know, and know well,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Issachar. \u00e2\u0080\u0098It is the Emir\nFakredeen.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098The son of my heart,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Besso, \u00e2\u0080\u0098who brings me news that is honey in\nmy mouth.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I am here, my father of fathers,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Fakredeen, gliding to the side\nof the couch.\n\nBesso grasped his hand, and looked at him earnestly in the face. \u00e2\u0080\u0098Speak\nof Eva,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he at length said, in a voice of choking agitation.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098She is well, she is safe. Yes, I have saved her,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Fakredeen,\nburying his face in the pillow, exhausted by emotion. \u00e2\u0080\u0098Yes, I have\nnot lived in vain.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 \u00e2\u0080\u0098Your flag shall wave on a thousand castles,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said\nBesso. \u00e2\u0080\u0098My child is saved, and she is saved by the brother of her\nheart. Entirely has the God of our fathers guarded over us. Henceforth,\nmy Fakredeen, you have only to wish: we are the same.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 And Besso sank\ndown almost insensible; then he made a vain effort to rise again,\nmurmuring \u00e2\u0080\u0098Eva!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098She will soon be here,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Fakredeen; \u00e2\u0080\u0098she only rests awhile after\nmany hardships.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Will the noble Emir refresh himself after his long journey?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said\nHillel.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098My heart is too elate for the body to need relief,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said the Emir.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098That may be very true,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Hillel. \u00e2\u0080\u0098At the same time, for my part,\nI have always thought that the body should be maintained as well as the\nspirit.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 \u00e2\u0080\u0098Withdraw from the side of the couch,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Issachar, the son\nof Selim, to his companions. \u00e2\u0080\u0098My lord and friend has swooned.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nGradually the tide of life returned to Besso, gradually the heart beat,\nthe hand grew warm. At length he slowly opened his eyes, and said, \u00e2\u0080\u0098I\nhave been dreaming of my child, even now I see her.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nYes, so vivid had been the vision that even now, restored entirely to\nhimself, perfectly conscious of the locality and the circumstances that\nsurrounded him, knowing full well that he was in his brother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s house at\nAleppo, suffering and disabled, keenly recalling his recent interview\nwith Fakredeen, notwithstanding all these tests of inward and outward\nperception, still before his entranced and agitated vision hovered\nthe lovely visage of his daughter, a little paler than usual, and an\nuncommon anxiety blended with its soft expression, but the same rich\neyes and fine contour of countenance that her father had so often gazed\non with pride, and recalled in her absence with brooding fondness. \u00e2\u0080\u0098Even\nnow I see her,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Besso.\n\nHe could say no more, for the sweetest form in the world had locked him\nin her arms.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098\u00e2\u0080\u0099Tis the letter of the third Cabala,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Issachar, the son of Selim.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LIX.\n\n     _Tancred Returns to Jerusalem_\n\nTANCRED had profited by his surprise by the children of Rechab in the\npasses of the Stony Arabia, and had employed the same tactics against\nthe Turkish force. By a simulated defence on the borders, and by the\ncareful dissemination of false intelligence, he had allowed the Pasha\nand his troops to penetrate the mountains, and principally by a pass\nwhich the Turks were assured by their spies that the Ansarey had\naltogether neglected. The success of these manoeuvres had been as\ncomplete as the discomfiture and rout of the Turks. Tancred, at the head\nof the cavalry, had pursued them into the plain, though he had halted,\nfor an instant, before he quitted the mountains, to send a courier to\nAstarte from himself with the assurance of victory, and the horsetails\nof the Pasha for a trophy.\n\nIt so happened, however, that, while Tancred, with very few attendants,\nwas scouring the plain, and driving before him a panic-struck multitude,\nwho, if they could only have paused and rallied, might in a moment have\noverwhelmed him, a strong body of Turkish cavalry, who had entered\nthe mountains by a different pass from that in which the principal\nengagement had taken place, but who, learning the surprise and defeat of\nthe main body, had thought it wise to retreat in order and watch events,\ndebouched at this moment from the high country into the plain and in the\nrear of Tancred. Had they been immediately recognised by the fugitives,\nit would have been impossible for Tancred to escape; but the only\nimpression of the routed Turks was, that a reinforcement had joined\ntheir foe, and their disorder was even increased by the appearance in\nthe distance of their own friends. This misapprehension must, however,\nin time, have been at least partially removed; but Baroni, whose quick\nglance had instantly detected the perilous incident, warned Tancred\nimmediately.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098We are surrounded, my lord; there is only one course to pursue. To\nregain the mountains is impossible; if we advance, we enter only a\nhostile country, and must be soon overpowered. We must make for the\nEastern desert.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nTancred halted and surveyed the scene: he had with him not twenty men.\nThe Turkish cavalry, several hundreds strong, had discovered their\nquarry, and were evidently resolved to cut off their retreat.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Very well,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Tancred, \u00e2\u0080\u0098we are well mounted, we must try the mettle\nof our steeds. Farewell, Gindaric\u00c3\u00a2! Farewell, gods of Olympus! To the\ndesert, which I ought never to have quitted!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 and, so speaking, he and\nhis band dashed towards the East.\n\nTheir start was, so considerable that they baffled their pursuers, who,\nhowever, did not easily relinquish their intended prey. Some shots in\nthe distance, towards nightfall, announced that the enemy had given up\nthe chase. After three hours of the moon, Tancred and his companions\nrested at a well not far from a village, where they obtained some\nsupplies. An hour before dawn, they again pursued their way over a rich\nflat country, uninclosed, yet partially cultivated, with, every now and\nthen, a village nestling in a jungle of Indian fig.\n\nIt was the commencement of December, and the country was very parched;\nbut the short though violent season of rain was at hand: this renovates\nin the course of a week the whole face of Nature, and pours into little\nmore than that brief space the supplies which in other regions are\ndistributed throughout the year. On the third day, before sunset, the\ncountry having gradually become desolate and deserted, consisting\nof vast plains covered with herds, with occasionally some wandering\nTurkmans or Kurds, Tancred and his companions came within sight of a\nbroad and palmy river, a branch of the Euphrates.\n\nThe country round, far as the eye could range, was a kind of downs\ncovered with a scanty herbage, now brown with heat and age. When Tancred\nhad gained an undulating height, and was capable of taking a more\nextensive survey of the land, it presented, especially towards the\nsouth, the same features through an illimitable space.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098The Syrian desert!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Baroni; \u00e2\u0080\u0098a fortnight later, and we shall see\nthis land covered with flowers and fragrant with aromatic herbs.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098My heart responds to it,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Tancred. \u00e2\u0080\u0098What is Damascus, with all its\nsumptuousness, to this sweet liberty?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nQuitting the banks of the river, they directed their course to the\nsouth, and struck as it were into the heart of the desert; yet, on the\nmorrow, the winding waters again met them. And now there opened on their\nsight a wondrous scene: as far as the eye could reach innumerable tents;\nstrings of many hundred camels going to, or returning from, the waters;\ngroups of horses picketed about; processions of women with vases on\ntheir heads visiting the palmy banks; swarms of children and dogs;\nspreading flocks; and occasionally an armed horseman bounding about the\nenvirons of the vast encampment.\n\nAlthough scarcely a man was visible when Tancred first caught a glimpse\nof this Arabian settlement, a band of horsemen suddenly sprang from\nbehind a rising ground and came galloping up to them to reconnoitre and\nto inquire.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098We are brothers,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Baroni, \u00e2\u0080\u0098for who should be the master of so many\ncamels but the lord of the Syrian pastures?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098There is but one God,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said the Bedouin, \u00e2\u0080\u0098and none are lords of the\nSyrian pastures but the children of Rechab.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Truly, there is only one God,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Baroni; \u00e2\u0080\u0098go tell the great Sheikh\nthat his friend the English prince has come here to give him a salaam of\npeace.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nAway bounded back the Bedouins, and were soon lost in the crowded\ndistance.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098All is right,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Baroni; \u00e2\u0080\u0098we shall sup to-night under the pavilion\nof Amalek.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I visit him then, at length, in his beautiful pastures,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Tancred;\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098but, alas! I visit him alone.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nThey had pulled up their horses, and were proceeding leisurely towards\nthe encampment, when they observed a cavalcade emerging from the outer\nboundary of the settlement. This was Amalek himself, on one of his\nsteeds of race, accompanied by several of his leading Sheikhs, coming\nto welcome Tancred to his pavilion in the Syrian pastures. A joyful\nsatisfaction sparkled in the bright eyes of the old chieftain, as, at\na little distance, he waved his hand with graceful dignity, and then\npressed it to his heart.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098A thousand salaams,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he exclaimed, when he had reached Tancred; \u00e2\u0080\u0098there\nis but one God. I press you to my heart of hearts. There are also other\nfriends, but they are not here.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Salaam, great Sheikh! I feel indeed we are brothers. There are friends\nof whom we must speak, and indeed of many things.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nThus conversing and riding side by side, Amalek and Tancred entered\nthe camp. Nearly five thousand persons were collected together in this\nwilderness, and two thousand warriors were prepared at a moment\u00e2\u0080\u0099s notice\nto raise their lances in the air. There were nearly as many horses,\nand ten times as many camels. This wilderness was the principal and\nfavourite resting-place of the great Sheikh of the children of Rechab,\nand the abundant waters and comparatively rich pasturage permitted him\nto gather around him a great portion of his tribe.\n\nThe lamps soon gleamed, and the fires soon blazed; sheep were killed,\nbread baked, coffee pounded, and the pipe of honour was placed in the\nhands of Tancred. For an Arabian revel, the banquet was long and rather\nelaborate. By degrees, however, the guests stole away; the women ceased\nto peep through the curtains; and the children left off asking Baroni\nto give them backsheesh. At length, Amalek and Tancred being left alone,\nthe great Sheikh, who had hitherto evinced no curiosity as to the cause\nof the presence of his guest, said, \u00e2\u0080\u0098There is a time for all things, for\neating and for drinking, also for prayers. There is, also, a season to\nask questions. Why is the brother of the Queen of the English in the\nSyrian desert?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098There is much to tell, and much to inquire,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Tancred; \u00e2\u0080\u0098but before\nI speak of myself, let me know whether you can get me tidings of Eva,\nthe daughter of Besso.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Is she not living in rooms with many divans?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Amalek.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Alas!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Tancred, \u00e2\u0080\u0098she was a prisoner, and is now a fugitive.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098What children of Gin have done this deed? Are there strange camels\ndrinking at my wells? Is it some accursed Kurd that has stolen her\nsheep; or some Turkman, blacker than night, that has hankered after her\nbracelets?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Nothing of all this, yet more than all this. All shall be told to you,\ngreat Sheikh, yet before I speak, tell me again, can you get me tidings\nof Eva, the daughter of Besso?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Can I fire an arrow that will hit its mark?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Amalek; \u00e2\u0080\u0098tell me the\ncity of Syria where Eva the daughter of Besso may be found, and I will\nsend her a messenger that would reach her even in the bath, were she\nthere.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nTancred then gave the great Sheikh a rapid sketch of what had occurred\nto Eva, and expressed his fear that she might have been intercepted\nby the Turkish troops. Amalek decided that she must be at Aleppo, and,\ninstantly summoning one of his principal men, he gave instructions for\nthe departure of a trusty scout in that direction.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Ere the tenth day shall have elapsed,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said the great Sheikh, \u00e2\u0080\u0098we\nshall have sure tidings. And now let me know, prince of England, by\nwhat strange cause you could have found yourself in the regions of those\nchildren of hell, the Ansarey, who, it is well known, worship Eblis in\nevery obscene form.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098It is a long tale,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Tancred, \u00e2\u0080\u0098but I suppose it must be told; but\nnow that you have relieved my mind by sending to Aleppo, I can hardly\nforget that I have ridden for more than three days, and with little\npause. I am not, alas! a true Arab, though I love Arabia and Arabian\nthoughts; and, indeed, my dear friend, had we not met again, it is\nimpossible to say what might have been my lot, for I now feel that I\ncould not have much longer undergone the sleepless toil I have of late\nencountered. If Eva be safe, I am content, or would wish to feel so;\nbut what is content, and what is life, and what is man? Indeed, great\nSheikh, the longer I live and the more I think----\u00e2\u0080\u0099 and here the\nchibouque dropped gently from Tancred\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mouth, and he himself sunk upon\nthe carpet.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LX.\n\n     _The Road to Bethany_\n\nBESSO is better,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said the Consul Pasqualigo to Barizy of the Tower, as\nhe met him on a December morning in the Via Dolorosa.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Yes, but he is by no means well,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 quickly rejoined Barizy. \u00e2\u0080\u0098The\nphysician of the English prince told me----\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098He has not seen the physician of the English prince!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 screamed\nPasqualigo, triumphantly.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I know that,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Barizy, rallying; \u00e2\u0080\u0098but the physician of the English\nprince says for flesh-wounds----\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098There are no flesh-wounds,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said the Consul Pasqualigo. \u00e2\u0080\u0098They have all\nhealed; \u00e2\u0080\u0098tis an internal shock.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098For internal shocks,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Barizy of the Tower, \u00e2\u0080\u0098there is nothing like\nrosemary stewed with salt, and so keep on till it simmers.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098That is very well for a bruise,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said the Consul Pasqualigo.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098A bruise is a shock,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Barizy of the Tower.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Besso should have remained at Aleppo,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said the Consul.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Besso always comes to Jerusalem when he is indisposed,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Barizy;\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098as he well says, \u00e2\u0080\u0098tis the only air that can cure him; and, if he\ncannot be cured, why, at least, he can be buried in the Valley of\nJe-hoshaphat.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098He is not at Jerusalem,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said the Consul Pasqualigo, maliciously.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098How do you mean?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Barizy, somewhat confused. \u00e2\u0080\u0098I am now going to\ninquire after him, and smoke some of his Latakia.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098He is at Bethany,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said the Consul.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Hem!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Barizy, mysteriously. \u00e2\u0080\u0098Bethany! Will that marriage come off\nnow, think you? I always fancy, when, eh?----\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098She will not marry till her father has recovered,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said the Consul.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098This is a curious story,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Barizy. \u00e2\u0080\u0098The regular troops beaten by\nthe Kurds.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098They were not Kurds,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said the Consul Pasqualigo. \u00e2\u0080\u0098They were Russians\nin disguise. Some cannon have been taken, which were cast at St.\nPetersburg; and, besides, there is a portfolio of state papers found on\na Cossack, habited as a Turkman, which betrays all. The documents are to\nbe published in numbers, with explanatory commentaries. Consul-General\nLaurella writes from Damascus that the Eastern question is more alive\nthan ever. We are on the eve of great events.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098You don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t say so?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Barizy of the Tower, losing his presence\nof mind from this overwhelming superiority of information. \u00e2\u0080\u0098I always\nthought so. Palmerston will never rest till he gets Jerusalem.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098The English must have markets,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said the Consul Pasqualigo.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Very just,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Barizy of the Tower. \u00e2\u0080\u0098There will be a great opening\nhere. I think of doing a little myself in cottons; but the house of\nBesso will monopolise everything.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think the English can do much here,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said the Consul, shaking\nhis head. \u00e2\u0080\u0098What have we to give them in exchange? The people here had\nbetter look to Austria, if they wish to thrive. The Austrians also have\ncottons, and they are Christians. They will give you their cottons, and\ntake your crucifixes.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think I can deal in crucifixes,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Barizy of the Tower.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I tell you what, if you won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t, your cousin Barizy of the Gate will. I\nknow he has given a great order to Bethlehem.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098The traitor!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 exclaimed Barizy of the Tower. \u00e2\u0080\u0098Well, if people will\npurchase crucifixes and nothing else, they must be supplied. Commerce\ncivilises man.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Who is this?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 exclaimed the Consul Pasqualigo.\n\nA couple of horsemen, well mounted, but travel-worn, and followed by a\nguard of Bedouins, were coming up the Via Dolorosa, and stopped at the\nhouse of Hassan Nejid.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098\u00e2\u0080\u0099Tis the English prince,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Barizy of the Tower. \u00e2\u0080\u0098He has been absent\nsix months; he has been in Egypt.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098To see the temples of the fire-worshippers, and to shoot crocodiles.\nThey all do that,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said the Consul Pasqualigo.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098How glad he must be to get back to Jerusalem,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Barizy of the\nTower. \u00e2\u0080\u0098There may be larger cities, but there are certainly none so\nbeautiful.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098The most beautiful city in the world is the city of Venice,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said\nPasqualigo.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098You have never been there,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Barizy.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098But it was built principally by my ancestors,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said the Consul, \u00e2\u0080\u0098and I\nhave a print of it in my hall.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I never heard that Venice was comparable to Jerusalem,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Barizy.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Jerusalem is, in every respect, an abode fit for swine, compared with\nVenice,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Pasqualigo.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I would have you to know, Monsieur Pasqualigo, who call yourself\nconsul, that the city of Jerusalem is not only the city of God, but has\never been the delight and pride of man.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Pish!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Pasqualigo.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Poh!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Barizy.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I am not at all surprised that Besso got out of it as soon as he\npossibly could.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098You would not dare to say these things in his presence,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Barizy.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Who says \u00e2\u0080\u009cdare\u00e2\u0080\u009d to the representative of a European Power!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I say \u00e2\u0080\u009cdare\u00e2\u0080\u009d to the son of the janissary of the Austrian Vice-Consul at\nSidon.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098You will hear more of this,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Pasqualigo, fiercely. \u00e2\u0080\u0098I shall make a\nrepresentation to the Inter-nonce at Stamboul.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098You had better go there yourself, as you are tired of El Khuds.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nPasqualigo, not having a repartee ready, shot at his habitual comrade a\nglance of withering contempt, and stalked away.\n\nIn the meantime, Tancred dismounted and entered for the first time his\nhouse at Jerusalem, of which he had been the nominal tenant for half a\nyear. Baroni was quite at home, as he knew the house in old days, and\nhad also several times visited, on this latter occasion, the suite of\nTancred. Freeman and True-man, who had been forwarded on by the British\nConsul at Beiroot, like bales of goods, were at their post, bowing as\nif their master had just returned from a club. But none of the important\nmembers of the body were at this moment at hand. Colonel Brace was\ndining with the English Consul on an experimental plum-pudding,\npreliminary to the authentic compound, which was to appear in a few\ndays. It was supposed to be the first time that a Christmas pudding\nhad been concocted at Jerusalem, and the excitement in the circle was\nconsiderable. The Colonel had undertaken to supervise the preparation,\nand had been for several days instilling the due instructions into a\nSyrian cook, who had hitherto only succeeded in producing a result\nwhich combined the specific gravity of lead with the general flavour and\nappearance of a mass of kneaded dates, in a state of fermentation after\na lengthy voyage. The Rev. Mr. Bernard was at Bethlehem, assisting the\nBishop in catechising some converts who had passed themselves off as\ntrue children of Israel, but who were in fact, older Christians\nthan either of their examinants, being descendants of some Nestorian\nfamilies, who had settled in the south of Palestine in the earlier ages\nof Christianity. As for Dr. Roby, he was culling simples in the valley\nof the Jordan; and thus it happened that, when Tancred at length did\nevince some disposition to settle down quietly under his own roof, and\navail himself of the services and society of his friends, not one of\nthem was present to receive and greet him. Tancred roamed about the\nhouse, surveyed his court and garden, sighed, while Baroni rewarded and\ndismissed their escort. \u00e2\u0080\u0098I know not how it is,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he at length said to his\nintendant, \u00e2\u0080\u0098but I never could have supposed that I could have felt so\nsad and spiritless at Jerusalem.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098It is the reaction, my lord, after a month\u00e2\u0080\u0099s wandering in the desert.\nIt is always so: the world seems tame.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I am disappointed that Besso is not here. I am most anxious to see\nhim.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Shall I send for the Colonel, my lord?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Baroni, shaking Tancred\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nArabian cloak.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Well, I think I should let him return naturally,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Tancred;\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098sending for him is a scene; and I do not know why, Baroni, but I\nfeel--I feel unstrung. I am surprised that there are no letters from\nEngland; and yet I am rather glad too, for a letter----\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Received some months after its date,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Baroni, \u00e2\u0080\u0098is like the visit\nof a spectre. I shudder at the sight of it.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Heigho!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Tancred, stretching his arm, and half-speaking to\nhimself, \u00e2\u0080\u0098I wish the battle of Gindarics had never ceased, but that,\nlike some hero of enchantment, I had gone on for ever fighting.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Ah! there is nothing like action,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Baroni, unscrewing his pistols.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098But what action is there in this world?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Tancred. \u00e2\u0080\u0098The most\nenergetic men in Europe are mere busybodies. Empires are now governed\nlike parishes, and a great statesman is only a select vestryman. And\nthey are right: unless we bring man nearer to heaven, unless government\nbecome again divine, the insignificance of the human scheme must\nparalyse all effort.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Hem!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Baroni, kneeling down and opening Tancred\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rifle-case. The\nsubject was getting a little too deep for him. \u00e2\u0080\u0098I perceive,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he said\nto himself, \u00e2\u0080\u0098that my lord is very restless. There is something at the\nbottom of his mind which, perhaps, he does not quite comprehend himself;\nbut it will come out.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Tancred passed the day alone in reading, or\nwalking about his room with an agitated and moody step. Often when his\neye rested on the page, his mind wandered from the subject, and he was\nfrequently lost in profound and protracted reverie. The evening drew\non; he retired early to his room, and gave orders that he was not to be\ndisturbed. At a later hour, Colonel Brace returned, having succeeded in\nhis principal enterprise, and having also sung the national anthem.\nHe was greatly surprised to hear that Lord Montacute had returned; but\nBaroni succeeded in postponing the interview until the morrow. An hour\nafter the Colonel, the Rev. Mr. Bernard returned from Bethlehem. He was\nin great tribulation, as he had been pursued by some of the vagabonds of\nthat ruffianly district; a shot had even been fired after him; but this\nwas only to frighten him. The fact is, the leader of the band was his\nprincipal catechumen, who was extremely desirous of appropriating a very\nsplendid copy of the Holy Writings, richly bound, and adorned with massy\ngolden clasps, which the Duchess of Bellamont had presented to the Rev.\nMr. Bernard before his departure, and which he always, as a sort of\nhomage to one whom he sincerely respected, displayed on any eminent\ninstance of conversion.\n\nThe gates of the city were closed when Dr. Roby returned, laden with\nmany rare balsams. The consequence was, he was obliged to find quarters\nin a tomb in the valley of Jehoshaphat. As his attendant was without\nfood, when his employer had sunk into philosophic repose, he supped off\nthe precious herbs and roots, and slaked his thirst with a draught from\nthe fountain of Siloah.\n\nTancred passed a night of agitating dreams. Sometimes he was in the\nstarry desert, sometimes in the caverned dungeons of Gindarics. Then,\nagain, the scene changed to Bellamont Castle, but it would seem that\nFakredeen was its lord; and when Tancred rushed forward to embrace his\nmother, she assumed the form of the Syrian goddess, and yet the face was\nthe face of Eva. Though disturbed, he slept, and when he woke, he was\nfor a moment quite unconscious of being at Jerusalem. Although within\na week of Christmas, no sensible difference had yet occurred in the\nclimate. The golden sun succeeded the silver moon, and both reigned in\na clear blue sky. You may dine at night on the terrace of your house at\nJerusalem in January, and find a serene and benignant atmosphere.\n\nTancred rose early; no one was stirring in the house except the native\nservants, and Mr. Freeman, who was making a great disturbance about hot\nwater. Tancred left a message with this gentleman for the Colonel and\nhis companions, begging that they might all meet at breakfast, and\nadding that he was about to stroll for half an hour. Saying this, he\nquitted the house, and took his way by the gate of Stephen to the Mount\nof Olives.\n\nIt was a delicious morn, wonderfully clear, and soft, and fresh. It\nseemed a happy and a thriving city, that forlorn Jerusalem, as Tancred,\nfrom the heights of Olivet, gazed upon its noble buildings, and its\ncupolaed houses of freestone, and its battlemented walls and lofty\ngates. Nature was fair, and the sense of existence was delightful.\nIt seemed to Tancred that a spicy gale came up the ravines of the\nwilderness, from the farthest Arabia.\n\nLost in prolonged reverie, the hours flew on. The sun was mounting in\nthe heavens when Tancred turned his step, but, instead of approaching\nthe city, he pursued a winding path in an opposite direction. That path\nled to Bethany.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXI.\n\n     _Arrival of the Duke and Duchess_\n\nTHE crest of the palm tree in the garden of Eva glittered in the\ndeclining sun; and the lady of Bethany sat in her kiosk on the margin\nof the fountain, unconsciously playing with a flower, and gazing in\nabstraction on the waters. She had left Tancred with her father, now\nconvalescent. They had passed the morning together, talking over the\nstrange events that had occurred since they first became acquainted\non this very spot; and now the lady of Bethany had retired to her own\nthoughts.\n\nA sound disturbed her; she looked up and recognised Tancred.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I could not refrain from seeing the sun set on Arabia,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he said; \u00e2\u0080\u0098I had\nalmost induced the noble Besso to be my companion.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098The year is too old,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Eva, not very composed.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098They should be midsummer nights,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Tancred, \u00e2\u0080\u0098as on my first visit\nhere; that hour thrice blessed!\u00e2\u0080\u0099 \u00e2\u0080\u0098We know not what is blessed in this\nworld,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Eva, mournfully.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I feel I do,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 murmured Tancred; and he also seated himself on the\nmargin of the fountain.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Of all the strange incidents and feelings that we have been talking\nover this day,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Eva, \u00e2\u0080\u0098there seems to me but one result; and that\nis, sadness.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098It is certainly not joy,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Tancred.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098There comes over me a great despondency,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Eva, \u00e2\u0080\u0098I know not why,\nmy convictions are as profound as they were, my hopes should not be less\nhigh, and yet----\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098And what?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Tancred, in a low, sweet voice, for she hesitated.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I have a vague impression,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Eva, sorrowfully, \u00e2\u0080\u0098that there have\nbeen heroic aspirations wasted, and noble energies thrown away; and yet,\nperhaps,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 she added, in a faltering tone, \u00e2\u0080\u0098there is no one to blame.\nPerhaps, all this time, we have been dreaming over an unattainable end,\nand the only source of deception is our own imagination.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098My faith is firm,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Tancred; \u00e2\u0080\u0098but if anything could make it falter,\nit would be to find you wavering.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Perhaps it is the twilight hour,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Eva, with a faint smile. \u00e2\u0080\u0098It\nsometimes makes one sad.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098There is no sadness where there is sympathy,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Tancred, in a low\nvoice. \u00e2\u0080\u0098I have been, I am sad, when I am alone: but when I am with you,\nmy spirit is sustained, and would be, come what might.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098And yet----\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Eva; and she paused.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098And what?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Your feelings cannot be what they were before all this happened; when\nyou thought only of a divine cause, of stars, of angels, and of our\npeculiar and gifted land. No, no; now it is all mixed up with intrigue,\nand politics, and management, and baffled schemes, and cunning arts of\nmen. You may be, you are, free from all this, but your faith is not the\nsame. You no longer believe in Arabia.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Why, thou to me art Arabia,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Tancred, advancing and kneeling at\nher side. \u00e2\u0080\u0098The angel of Arabia, and of my life and spirit! Talk not\nto me of faltering faith: mine is intense. Talk not to me of leaving a\ndivine cause: why, thou art my cause, and thou art most divine! O Eva!\ndeign to accept the tribute of my long agitated heart! Yes, I too, like\nthee, am sometimes full of despair; but it is only when I remember that\nI love, and love, perhaps, in vain!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nHe had clasped her hand; his passionate glance met her eye, as he looked\nup with adoration to a face infinitely distressed. Yet she withdrew not\nher hand, as she murmured, with averted head, \u00e2\u0080\u0098We must not talk of these\nthings; we must not think of them. You know all.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I know of nothing, I will know of nothing, but of my love.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098There are those to whom I belong; and to whom you belong. Yes,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 she\nsaid, trying to withdraw her hand, \u00e2\u0080\u0098fly, fly from me, son of Europe and\nof Christ!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I am a Christian in the land of Christ,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Tancred, \u00e2\u0080\u0098and I kneel to\na daughter of my Redeemer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s race. Why should I fly?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Oh! this is madness!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Say, rather, inspiration,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Tancred, \u00e2\u0080\u0098for I will not quit this\nfountain by which we first met until I am told, as you now will tell\nme,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he added, in a tone of gushing tenderness, \u00e2\u0080\u0098that our united\ndestinies shall advance the sovereign purpose of our lives. Talk not to\nme of others, of those who have claims on you or on myself. I have no\nkindred, no country, and, as for the ties that would bind you, shall\nsuch world-worn bonds restrain our consecrated aim? Say but you love me,\nand I will trample them to the dust.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nThe head of Eva fell upon his shoulder. He impressed an embrace upon her\ncheek. It was cold, insensible. Her hand, which he still held, seemed to\nhave lost all vitality. Overcome by contending emotions, the principle\nof life seemed to have deserted her. Tancred laid her reclining figure\nwith gentleness on the mats of the kiosk; he sprinkled her pale face\nwith some drops from the fountain; he chafed her delicate hand. Her eyes\nat length opened, and she sighed. He placed beneath her head some of\nthe cushions that were at hand. Recovering, she slightly raised herself,\nleant upon the marble margin of the fountain, and looked about her with\na wildered air.\n\nAt this moment a shout was heard, repeated and increased; soon the sound\nof many voices and the tramp of persons approaching. The vivid but brief\ntwilight had died away. Almost suddenly it had become night. The voices\nbecame more audible, the steps were at hand. Tancred recognised his\nname, frequently repeated. Behold a crowd of many persons, several of\nthem bearing torches. There was Colonel Brace in the van; on his right\nwas the Rev. Mr. Bernard; on his left, was Dr. Roby. Freeman and Trueman\nand several guides and native servants were in the rear, most of them\nproclaiming the name of Lord Montacute.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098I am here,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said Tancred, advancing from the kiosk, pale and agitated.\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098Why am I wanted?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nColonel Brace began to explain, but all seemed to speak at the same\ntime.\n\nThe Duke and Duchess of Bellamont had arrived at Jerusalem.\n\n[Illustration: front-backplate]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Tancred, by Benjamin Disraeli\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK TANCRED ***\n\n***** This file should be named 20004-0.txt or 20004-0.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/2\/0\/0\/0\/20004\/\n\nProduced by David Widger\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http:\/\/pglaf.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.

For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":1227,"split":"test"}
