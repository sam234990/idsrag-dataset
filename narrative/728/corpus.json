It is not until her mother dies that Linda even begins to understand that she is a slave. At the age of six, she is sent to live in the big house under the extended care of her mother's mistress, who treats her well and teaches her to read. After a few years, this mistress dies and bequeaths Linda to a relative. Her new masters are cruel and neglectful, and Dr. Flint, the father, takes an interest in Linda. He tries to force her into a sexual relationship with him when she comes of age. The girl resists his entreaties and maintains her distance.\nKnowing that Flint will do anything to get his way, as a young woman Linda consents to a relationship with a white neighbor, Mr. Sands, hoping he can protect her from Flint. As a result of their relations, Sands and Linda have two mixed-race children: Benjamin, often called Benny, and Ellen. Because they were born to a slave mother, they are considered slaves, under the principle of partus sequitur ventrem, which had been part of southern slave law since the 17th century. Linda is ashamed, but hopes this illegitimate relationship will protect her from assault at the hands of Dr. Flint. Linda also hopes that Flint would become angry enough to sell her to Sands, but he refuses to do so. Instead, he sends Linda to his son's plantation to be broken in as a field hand.\nWhen Linda discovers that Benny and Ellen are also to be sent to the fields, she makes a desperate plan. Escaping to the North with two small children would be nearly impossible. Unwilling either to submit to Dr. Flint's abuse or abandon her family, she hides in the attic of her grandmother Aunt Martha's cabin. She hopes that Dr. Flint, believing that she has fled to the North, will sell her children rather than risk having them escape as well. Linda is overjoyed when Dr. Flint sells Benny and Ellen to a slave trader secretly representing Sands. Promising to free the children one day, Sands assigns them to live with Aunt Martha. Linda becomes physically debilitated by being confined to the tiny attic, where she can neither sit nor stand. Her only pleasure is to watch her children through a tiny peephole.\nMr. Sands marries and is elected as a congressman. When he takes the slave girl Ellen to Washington, D.C., to be an eventual companion for his newborn daughter, Linda realizes that he may never free their children. Worried that he will eventually sell them, she determines to escape with them to the North. But Dr. Flint continues to hunt for her, and leaving the attic is still too risky.\nAfter seven years in the attic, Linda finally escapes to the North by boat. Benny remains with Aunt Martha. Linda tracks down Ellen, by then nine years old and living in Brooklyn, New York, in the home of Sands\u00e2\u0080\u0099 cousin, Mrs. Hobbs. Linda is dismayed to see Ellen is being treated as a slave, after the institution was abolished in New York. She fears that Mrs. Hobbs will take Ellen back to the South and put her beyond her mother's reach. Linda finds work as a nursemaid for the Bruces, a family in New York City who treat her very kindly.\nLearning that Dr. Flint is still in pursuit, Linda flees to Boston, where she is reunited with her son Benny, who had also escaped. Dr. Flint claims that the sale of Benny and Ellen was illegitimate, and Linda is terrified that he will re-enslave her and her children. After a few years, Mrs. Bruce dies. Linda spends some time living with her children in Boston. She spends a year in England caring for Mr. Bruce's daughter, and for the first time in her life enjoys freedom from racial prejudice. When Linda returns to Boston, she sends Ellen to boarding school. Benny moves to California with Linda's brother William, who had also escaped to the North. Mr. Bruce remarries, and Linda takes a position caring for their new baby. Dr. Flint dies, but his daughter, Emily, writes to Linda to claim ownership of the fugitive slave.\nThe Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 is passed by Congress, making Linda and her children extremely vulnerable to capture and re-enslavement, as it requires cooperation by law enforcement and citizens of free states. Emily Flint and her husband, Mr. Dodge, arrive in New York to capture Linda. When the refugee goes into hiding, the new Mrs. Bruce offers to purchase her freedom. At first Linda refuses, unwilling to be bought and sold again, and makes plans to follow Benny to California. Mrs. Bruce buys Linda's freedom from Flint. Linda is grateful to Mrs. Bruce, but expresses disgust at the institution that required such a transaction. Linda notes that she has not yet realized her dream of making a home with her children.\nThe book closes with two testimonials to its accuracy, one from Amy Post, a white abolitionist, and the other from George W. Lowther, a black anti-slavery writer.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg EBook of Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl\nby Harriet Jacobs (AKA Linda Brent)\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

I am aware that some of my\nadventures may seem incredible; but they are, nevertheless, strictly true.\nI have not exaggerated the wrongs inflicted by Slavery; on the contrary, my\ndescriptions fall far short of the facts. I have concealed the names of\nplaces, and given persons fictitious names. I had no motive for secrecy on\nmy own account, but I deemed it kind and considerate towards others to\npursue this course.\n\nI wish I were more competent to the task I have undertaken. But I trust my\nreaders will excuse deficiencies in consideration of circumstances. I was\nborn and reared in Slavery; and I remained in a Slave State twenty-seven\nyears. Since I have been at the North, it has been necessary for me to work\ndiligently for my own support, and the education of my children. This has\nnot left me much leisure to make up for the loss of early opportunities to\nimprove myself; and it has compelled me to write these pages at irregular\nintervals, whenever I could snatch an hour from household duties.\n\nWhen I first arrived in Philadelphia, Bishop Paine advised me to publish a\nsketch of my life, but I told him I was altogether incompetent to such an\nundertaking. Though I have improved my mind somewhat since that time, I\nstill remain of the same opinion; but I trust my motives will excuse what\nmight otherwise seem presumptuous. I have not written my experiences in\norder to attract attention to myself; on the contrary, it would have been\nmore pleasant to me to have been silent about my own history. Neither do I\ncare to excite sympathy for my own sufferings. But I do earnestly desire to\narouse the women of the North to a realizing sense of the condition of two\nmillions of women at the South, still in bondage, suffering what I\nsuffered, and most of them far worse. I want to add my testimony to that of\nabler pens to convince the people of the Free States what Slavery really\nis. Only by experience can any one realize how deep, and dark, and foul is\nthat pit of abominations. May the blessing of God rest on this imperfect\neffort in behalf of my persecuted people!\n\n--_Linda Brent_\n\n\n\nIntroduction By The Editor\n\n\nThe author of the following autobiography is personally known to me, and\nher conversation and manners inspire me with confidence. During the last\nseventeen years, she has lived the greater part of the time with a\ndistinguished family in New York, and has so deported herself as to be\nhighly esteemed by them. This fact is sufficient, without further\ncredentials of her character. I believe those who know her will not be\ndisposed to doubt her veracity, though some incidents in her story are more\nromantic than fiction.\n\nAt her request, I have revised her manuscript; but such changes as I have\nmade have been mainly for purposes of condensation and orderly arrangement.\nI have not added any thing to the incidents, or changed the import of her\nvery pertinent remarks. With trifling exceptions, both the ideas and the\nlanguage are her own. I pruned excrescences a little, but otherwise I had\nno reason for changing her lively and dramatic way of telling her own\nstory. The names of both persons and places are known to me; but for good\nreasons I suppress them.\n\nIt will naturally excite surprise that a woman reared in Slavery should be\nable to write so well. But circumstances will explain this. In the first\nplace, nature endowed her with quick perceptions. Secondly, the mistress,\nwith whom she lived till she was twelve years old, was a kind, considerate\nfriend, who taught her to read and spell. Thirdly, she was placed in\nfavorable circumstances after she came to the North; having frequent\nintercourse with intelligent persons, who felt a friendly interest in her\nwelfare, and were disposed to give her opportunities for self-improvement.\n\nI am well aware that many will accuse me of indecorum for presenting these\npages to the public; for the experiences of this intelligent and\nmuch-injured woman belong to a class which some call delicate subjects, and\nothers indelicate. This peculiar phase of Slavery has generally been kept\nveiled; but the public ought to be made acquainted with its monstrous\nfeatures, and I willingly take the responsibility of presenting them with\nthe veil withdrawn. I do this for the sake of my sisters in bondage, who\nare suffering wrongs so foul, that our ears are too delicate to listen to\nthem. I do it with the hope of arousing conscientious and reflecting women\nat the North to a sense of their duty in the exertion of moral influence on\nthe question of Slavery, on all possible occasions. I do it with the hope\nthat every man who reads this narrative will swear solemnly before God\nthat, so far as he has power to prevent it, no fugitive from Slavery shall\never be sent back to suffer in that loathsome den of corruption and\ncruelty.\n\n--_L.

Childhood\n\n\nI was born a slave; but I never knew it till six years of happy childhood\nhad passed away. My father was a carpenter, and considered so intelligent\nand skilful in his trade, that, when buildings out of the common line were\nto be erected, he was sent for from long distances, to be head workman. On\ncondition of paying his mistress two hundred dollars a year, and supporting\nhimself, he was allowed to work at his trade, and manage his own affairs.\nHis strongest wish was to purchase his children; but, though he several\ntimes offered his hard earnings for that purpose, he never succeeded. In\ncomplexion my parents were a light shade of brownish yellow, and were\ntermed mulattoes. They lived together in a comfortable home; and, though we\nwere all slaves, I was so fondly shielded that I never dreamed I was a\npiece of merchandise, trusted to them for safe keeping, and liable to be\ndemanded of them at any moment. I had one brother, William, who was two\nyears younger than myself--a bright, affectionate child. I had also a great\ntreasure in my maternal grandmother, who was a remarkable woman in many\nrespects. She was the daughter of a planter in South Carolina, who, at his\ndeath, left her mother and his three children free, with money to go to St.\nAugustine, where they had relatives. It was during the Revolutionary War;\nand they were captured on their passage, carried back, and sold to\ndifferent purchasers. Such was the story my grandmother used to tell me;\nbut I do not remember all the particulars. She was a little girl when she\nwas captured and sold to the keeper of a large hotel. I have often heard\nher tell how hard she fared during childhood. But as she grew older she\nevinced so much intelligence, and was so faithful, that her master and\nmistress could not help seeing it was for their interest to take care of\nsuch a valuable piece of property. She became an indispensable personage in\nthe household, officiating in all capacities, from cook and wet nurse to\nseamstress. She was much praised for her cooking; and her nice crackers\nbecame so famous in the neighborhood that many people were desirous of\nobtaining them. In consequence of numerous requests of this kind, she asked\npermission of her mistress to bake crackers at night, after all the\nhousehold work was done; and she obtained leave to do it, provided she\nwould clothe herself and her children from the profits. Upon these terms,\nafter working hard all day for her mistress, she began her midnight\nbakings, assisted by her two oldest children. The business proved\nprofitable; and each year she laid by a little, which was saved for a fund\nto purchase her children. Her master died, and the property was divided\namong his heirs. The widow had her dower in the hotel which she continued\nto keep open. My grandmother remained in her service as a slave; but her\nchildren were divided among her master's children. As she had five,\nBenjamin, the youngest one, was sold, in order that each heir might have an\nequal portion of dollars and cents. There was so little difference in our\nages that he seemed more like my brother than my uncle. He was a bright,\nhandsome lad, nearly white; for he inherited the complexion my grandmother\nhad derived from Anglo-Saxon ancestors. Though only ten years old, seven\nhundred and twenty dollars were paid for him. His sale was a terrible blow\nto my grandmother, but she was naturally hopeful, and she went to work with\nrenewed energy, trusting in time to be able to purchase some of her\nchildren. She had laid up three hundred dollars, which her mistress one day\nbegged as a loan, promising to pay her soon. The reader probably knows that\nno promise or writing given to a slave is legally binding; for, according\nto Southern laws, a slave, _being_ property, can _hold_ no property. When\nmy grandmother lent her hard earnings to her mistress, she trusted solely\nto her honor. The honor of a slaveholder to a slave!\n\nTo this good grandmother I was indebted for many comforts. My brother\nWillie and I often received portions of the crackers, cakes, and preserves,\nshe made to sell; and after we ceased to be children we were indebted to\nher for many more important services.\n\nSuch were the unusually fortunate circumstances of my early childhood. When\nI was six years old, my mother died; and then, for the first time, I\nlearned, by the talk around me, that I was a slave. My mother's mistress\nwas the daughter of my grandmother's mistress. She was the foster sister of\nmy mother; they were both nourished at my grandmother's breast. In fact, my\nmother had been weaned at three months old, that the babe of the mistress\nmight obtain sufficient food. They played together as children; and, when\nthey became women, my mother was a most faithful servant to her whiter\nfoster sister. On her death-bed her mistress promised that her children\nshould never suffer for any thing; and during her lifetime she kept her\nword. They all spoke kindly of my dead mother, who had been a slave merely\nin name, but in nature was noble and womanly. I grieved for her, and my\nyoung mind was troubled with the thought who would now take care of me and\nmy little brother. I was told that my home was now to be with her mistress;\nand I found it a happy one. No toilsome or disagreeable duties were imposed\non me. My mistress was so kind to me that I was always glad to do her\nbidding, and proud to labor for her as much as my young years would permit.\nI would sit by her side for hours, sewing diligently, with a heart as free\nfrom care as that of any free-born white child. When she thought I was\ntired, she would send me out to run and jump; and away I bounded, to gather\nberries or flowers to decorate her room. Those were happy days--too happy\nto last. The slave child had no thought for the morrow; but there came that\nblight, which too surely waits on every human being born to be a chattel.\n\nWhen I was nearly twelve years old, my kind mistress sickened and died. As\nI saw the cheek grow paler, and the eye more glassy, how earnestly I prayed\nin my heart that she might live! I loved her; for she had been almost like\na mother to me. My prayers were not answered. She died, and they buried her\nin the little churchyard, where, day after day, my tears fell upon her\ngrave.\n\nI was sent to spend a week with my grandmother. I was now old enough to\nbegin to think of the future; and again and again I asked myself what they\nwould do with me. I felt sure I should never find another mistress so kind\nas the one who was gone. She had promised my dying mother that her children\nshould never suffer for any thing; and when I remembered that, and recalled\nher many proofs of attachment to me, I could not help having some hopes\nthat she had left me free. My friends were almost certain it would be so.\nThey thought she would be sure to do it, on account of my mother's love and\nfaithful service. But, alas! we all know that the memory of a faithful\nslave does not avail much to save her children from the auction block.\n\nAfter a brief period of suspense, the will of my mistress was read, and we\nlearned that she had bequeathed me to her sister's daughter, a child of\nfive years old. So vanished our hopes. My mistress had taught me the\nprecepts of God's Word: \"Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.\"\n\"Whatsoever ye would that men should do unto you, do ye even so unto them.\"\nBut I was her slave, and I suppose she did not recognize me as her\nneighbor. I would give much to blot out from my memory that one great\nwrong. As a child, I loved my mistress; and, looking back on the happy days\nI spent with her, I try to think with less bitterness of this act of\ninjustice. While I was with her, she taught me to read and spell; and for\nthis privilege, which so rarely falls to the lot of a slave, I bless her\nmemory.\n\nShe possessed but few slaves; and at her death those were all distributed\namong her relatives. Five of them were my grandmother's children, and had\nshared the same milk that nourished her mother's children. Notwithstanding\nmy grandmother's long and faithful service to her owners, not one of her\nchildren escaped the auction block. These God-breathing machines are no\nmore, in the sight of their masters, than the cotton they plant, or the\nhorses they tend.\n\n\n\nII. The New Master And Mistress.\n\n\nDr. Flint, a physician in the neighborhood, had married the sister of my\nmistress, and I was now the property of their little daughter. It was not\nwithout murmuring that I prepared for my new home; and what added to my\nunhappiness, was the fact that my brother William was purchased by the same\nfamily. My father, by his nature, as well as by the habit of transacting\nbusiness as a skillful mechanic, had more of the feelings of a freeman than\nis common among slaves. My brother was a spirited boy; and being brought up\nunder such influences, he daily detested the name of master and mistress.\nOne day, when his father and his mistress both happened to call him at the\nsame time, he hesitated between the two; being perplexed to know which had\nthe strongest claim upon his obedience. He finally concluded to go to his\nmistress. When my father reproved him for it, he said, \"You both called me,\nand I didn't know which I ought to go to first.\"\n\n\"You are _my_ child,\" replied our father, \"and when I call you, you should\ncome immediately, if you have to pass through fire and water.\"\n\nPoor Willie! He was now to learn his first lesson of obedience to a master.\nGrandmother tried to cheer us with hopeful words, and they found an echo in\nthe credulous hearts of youth.\n\nWhen we entered our new home we encountered cold looks, cold words, and\ncold treatment. We were glad when the night came. On my narrow bed I moaned\nand wept, I felt so desolate and alone.\n\nI had been there nearly a year, when a dear little friend of mine was\nburied. I heard her mother sob, as the clods fell on the coffin of her only\nchild, and I turned away from the grave, feeling thankful that I still had\nsomething left to love. I met my grandmother, who said, \"Come with me,\nLinda;\" and from her tone I knew that something sad had happened. She led\nme apart from the people, and then said, \"My child, your father is dead.\"\nDead! How could I believe it? He had died so suddenly I had not even heard\nthat he was sick. I went home with my grandmother. My heart rebelled\nagainst God, who had taken from me mother, father, mistress, and friend.\nThe good grandmother tried to comfort me. \"Who knows the ways of God?\" said\nshe. \"Perhaps they have been kindly taken from the evil days to come.\"\nYears afterwards I often thought of this. She promised to be a mother to\nher grandchildren, so far as she might be permitted to do so; and\nstrengthened by her love, I returned to my master's. I thought I should be\nallowed to go to my father's house the next morning; but I was ordered to\ngo for flowers, that my mistress's house might be decorated for an evening\nparty. I spent the day gathering flowers and weaving them into festoons,\nwhile the dead body of my father was lying within a mile of me. What cared\nmy owners for that? he was merely a piece of property. Moreover, they\nthought he had spoiled his children, by teaching them to feel that they\nwere human beings. This was blasphemous doctrine for a slave to teach;\npresumptuous in him, and dangerous to the masters.\n\nThe next day I followed his remains to a humble grave beside that of my\ndear mother. There were those who knew my father's worth, and respected his\nmemory.\n\nMy home now seemed more dreary than ever. The laugh of the little\nslave-children sounded harsh and cruel. It was selfish to feel so about the\njoy of others. My brother moved about with a very grave face. I tried to\ncomfort him, by saying, \"Take courage, Willie; brighter days will come by\nand by.\"\n\n\"You don't know any thing about it, Linda,\" he replied. \"We shall have to\nstay here all our days; we shall never be free.\"\n\nI argued that we were growing older and stronger, and that perhaps we\nmight, before long, be allowed to hire our own time, and then we could earn\nmoney to buy our freedom. William declared this was much easier to say than\nto do; moreover, he did not intend to _buy_ his freedom. We held daily\ncontroversies upon this subject.\n\nLittle attention was paid to the slaves' meals in Dr. Flint's house. If\nthey could catch a bit of food while it was going, well and good. I gave\nmyself no trouble on that score, for on my various errands I passed my\ngrandmother's house, where there was always something to spare for me. I\nwas frequently threatened with punishment if I stopped there; and my\ngrandmother, to avoid detaining me, often stood at the gate with something\nfor my breakfast or dinner. I was indebted to _her_ for all my comforts,\nspiritual or temporal. It was _her_ labor that supplied my scanty wardrobe.\nI have a vivid recollection of the linsey-woolsey dress given me every\nwinter by Mrs. Flint. How I hated it! It was one of the badges of slavery.\n\nWhile my grandmother was thus helping to support me from her hard earnings,\nthe three hundred dollars she had lent her mistress were never repaid. When\nher mistress died, her son-in-law, Dr. Flint, was appointed executor. When\ngrandmother applied to him for payment, he said the estate was insolvent,\nand the law prohibited payment. It did not, however, prohibit him from\nretaining the silver candelabra, which had been purchased with that money.\nI presume they will be handed down in the family, from generation to\ngeneration.\n\nMy grandmother's mistress had always promised her that, at her death, she\nshould be free; and it was said that in her will she made good the promise.\nBut when the estate was settled, Dr. Flint told the faithful old servant\nthat, under existing circumstances, it was necessary she should be sold.\n\nOn the appointed day, the customary advertisement was posted up,\nproclaiming that there would be a \"public sale of negroes, horses, &c.\" Dr.\nFlint called to tell my grandmother that he was unwilling to wound her\nfeelings by putting her up at auction, and that he would prefer to dispose\nof her at private sale. My grandmother saw through his hypocrisy; she\nunderstood very well that he was ashamed of the job. She was a very\nspirited woman, and if he was base enough to sell her, when her mistress\nintended she should be free, she was determined the public should know it.\nShe had for a long time supplied many families with crackers and preserves;\nconsequently, \"Aunt Marthy,\" as she was called, was generally known, and\nevery body who knew her respected her intelligence and good character. Her\nlong and faithful service in the family was also well known, and the\nintention of her mistress to leave her free. When the day of sale came, she\ntook her place among the chattels, and at the first call she sprang upon\nthe auction-block. Many voices called out, \"Shame! Shame! Who is going to\nsell _you_, aunt Marthy? Don't stand there! That is no place for _you_.\"\nWithout saying a word, she quietly awaited her fate. No one bid for her. At\nlast, a feeble voice said, \"Fifty dollars.\" It came from a maiden lady,\nseventy years old, the sister of my grandmother's deceased mistress. She\nhad lived forty years under the same roof with my grandmother; she knew how\nfaithfully she had served her owners, and how cruelly she had been\ndefrauded of her rights; and she resolved to protect her. The auctioneer\nwaited for a higher bid; but her wishes were respected; no one bid above\nher. She could neither read nor write; and when the bill of sale was made\nout, she signed it with a cross. But what consequence was that, when she\nhad a big heart overflowing with human kindness? She gave the old servant\nher freedom.\n\nAt that time, my grandmother was just fifty years old. Laborious years had\npassed since then; and now my brother and I were slaves to the man who had\ndefrauded her of her money, and tried to defraud her of her freedom. One of\nmy mother's sisters, called Aunt Nancy, was also a slave in his family. She\nwas a kind, good aunt to me; and supplied the place of both housekeeper and\nwaiting maid to her mistress. She was, in fact, at the beginning and end of\nevery thing.\n\nMrs. Flint, like many southern women, was totally deficient in energy. She\nhad not strength to superintend her household affairs; but her nerves were\nso strong, that she could sit in her easy chair and see a woman whipped,\ntill the blood trickled from every stroke of the lash. She was a member of\nthe church; but partaking of the Lord's supper did not seem to put her in a\nChristian frame of mind. If dinner was not served at the exact time on that\nparticular Sunday, she would station herself in the kitchen, and wait till\nit was dished, and then spit in all the kettles and pans that had been used\nfor cooking. She did this to prevent the cook and her children from eking\nout their meagre fare with the remains of the gravy and other scrapings.\nThe slaves could get nothing to eat except what she chose to give them.\nProvisions were weighed out by the pound and ounce, three times a day. I\ncan assure you she gave them no chance to eat wheat bread from her flour\nbarrel. She knew how many biscuits a quart of flour would make, and exactly\nwhat size they ought to be.\n\nDr. Flint was an epicure. The cook never sent a dinner to his table without\nfear and trembling; for if there happened to be a dish not to his liking,\nhe would either order her to be whipped, or compel her to eat every\nmouthful of it in his presence. The poor, hungry creature might not have\nobjected to eating it; but she did object to having her master cram it\ndown her throat till she choked.\n\nThey had a pet dog, that was a nuisance in the house. The cook was ordered\nto make some Indian mush for him. He refused to eat, and when his head was\nheld over it, the froth flowed from his mouth into the basin. He died a few\nminutes after. When Dr. Flint came in, he said the mush had not been well\ncooked, and that was the reason the animal would not eat it. He sent for\nthe cook, and compelled her to eat it. He thought that the woman's stomach\nwas stronger than the dog's; but her sufferings afterwards proved that he\nwas mistaken. This poor woman endured many cruelties from her master and\nmistress; sometimes she was locked up, away from her nursing baby, for a\nwhole day and night.\n\nWhen I had been in the family a few weeks, one of the plantation slaves was\nbrought to town, by order of his master. It was near night when he arrived,\nand Dr. Flint ordered him to be taken to the work house, and tied up to the\njoist, so that his feet would just escape the ground. In that situation he\nwas to wait till the doctor had taken his tea. I shall never forget\nthat night. Never before, in my life, had I heard hundreds of blows fall;\nin succession, on a human being. His piteous groans, and his \"O, pray\ndon't, massa,\" rang in my ear for months afterwards. There were many\nconjectures as to the cause of this terrible punishment. Some said master\naccused him of stealing corn; others said the slave had quarrelled with his\nwife, in presence of the overseer, and had accused his master of being the\nfather of her child. They were both black, and the child was very fair.\n\nI went into the work house next morning, and saw the cowhide still wet with\nblood, and the boards all covered with gore. The poor man lived, and\ncontinued to quarrel with his wife. A few months afterwards Dr. Flint\nhanded them both over to a slave-trader. The guilty man put their value\ninto his pocket, and had the satisfaction of knowing that they were out of\nsight and hearing. When the mother was delivered into the trader's hands,\nshe said. \"You _promised_ to treat me well.\" To which he replied, \"You have\nlet your tongue run too far; damn you!\" She had forgotten that it was a\ncrime for a slave to tell who was the father of her child.\n\nFrom others than the master persecution also comes in such cases. I once\nsaw a young slave girl dying soon after the birth of a child nearly white.\nIn her agony she cried out, \"O Lord, come and take me!\" Her mistress stood\nby, and mocked at her like an incarnate fiend. \"You suffer, do you?\" she\nexclaimed. \"I am glad of it. You deserve it all, and more too.\"\n\nThe girl's mother said, \"The baby is dead, thank God; and I hope my poor\nchild will soon be in heaven, too.\"\n\n\"Heaven!\" retorted the mistress. \"There is no such place for the like of\nher and her bastard.\"\n\nThe poor mother turned away, sobbing. Her dying daughter called her,\nfeebly, and as she bent over her, I heard her say, \"Don't grieve so,\nmother; God knows all about it; and HE will have mercy upon me.\"\n\nHer sufferings, afterwards, became so intense, that her mistress felt\nunable to stay; but when she left the room, the scornful smile was still on\nher lips. Seven children called her mother. The poor black woman had but\nthe one child, whose eyes she saw closing in death, while she thanked God\nfor taking her away from the greater bitterness of life.\n\n\n\nIII. The Slaves' New Year's Day.\n\n\nDr. Flint owned a fine residence in town, several farms, and about fifty\nslaves, besides hiring a number by the year.\n\nHiring-day at the south takes place on the 1st of January. On the 2d, the\nslaves are expected to go to their new masters. On a farm, they work until\nthe corn and cotton are laid. They then have two holidays. Some masters\ngive them a good dinner under the trees. This over, they work until\nChristmas eve. If no heavy charges are meantime brought against them, they\nare given four or five holidays, whichever the master or overseer may think\nproper. Then comes New Year's eve; and they gather together their little\nalls, or more properly speaking, their little nothings, and wait anxiously\nfor the dawning of day. At the appointed hour the grounds are thronged with\nmen, women, and children, waiting, like criminals, to hear their doom\npronounced. The slave is sure to know who is the most humane, or cruel\nmaster, within forty miles of him.\n\nIt is easy to find out, on that day, who clothes and feeds his slaves well;\nfor he is surrounded by a crowd, begging, \"Please, massa, hire me this\nyear. I will work _very_ hard, massa.\"\n\nIf a slave is unwilling to go with his new master, he is whipped, or locked\nup in jail, until he consents to go, and promises not to run away during\nthe year. Should he chance to change his mind, thinking it justifiable to\nviolate an extorted promise, woe unto him if he is caught! The whip is used\ntill the blood flows at his feet; and his stiffened limbs are put in\nchains, to be dragged in the field for days and days!\n\nIf he lives until the next year, perhaps the same man will hire him again,\nwithout even giving him an opportunity of going to the hiring-ground. After\nthose for hire are disposed of, those for sale are called up.\n\nO, you happy free women, contrast _your_ New Year's day with that of the\npoor bond-woman! With you it is a pleasant season, and the light of the day\nis blessed. Friendly wishes meet you every where, and gifts are showered\nupon you. Even hearts that have been estranged from you soften at this\nseason, and lips that have been silent echo back, \"I wish you a happy New\nYear.\" Children bring their little offerings, and raise their rosy lips for\na caress. They are your own, and no hand but that of death can take them\nfrom you.\n\nBut to the slave mother New Year's day comes laden with peculiar sorrows.\nShe sits on her cold cabin floor, watching the children who may all be torn\nfrom her the next morning; and often does she wish that she and they might\ndie before the day dawns. She may be an ignorant creature, degraded by the\nsystem that has brutalized her from childhood; but she has a mother's\ninstincts, and is capable of feeling a mother's agonies.\n\nOn one of these sale days, I saw a mother lead seven children to the\nauction-block. She knew that _some_ of them would be taken from her; but\nthey took _all_. The children were sold to a slave-trader, and their mother\nwas bought by a man in her own town. Before night her children were all\nfar away. She begged the trader to tell her where he intended to take them;\nthis he refused to do. How _could_ he, when he knew he would sell them, one\nby one, wherever he could command the highest price? I met that mother in\nthe street, and her wild, haggard face lives to-day in my mind. She wrung\nher hands in anguish, and exclaimed, \"Gone! All gone! Why _don't_ God kill\nme?\" I had no words wherewith to comfort her. Instances of this kind are of\ndaily, yea, of hourly occurrence.\n\nSlaveholders have a method, peculiar to their institution, of getting rid\nof _old_ slaves, whose lives have been worn out in their service. I knew an\nold woman, who for seventy years faithfully served her master. She had\nbecome almost helpless, from hard labor and disease. Her owners moved to\nAlabama, and the old black woman was left to be sold to any body who would\ngive twenty dollars for her.\n\n\n\nIV. The Slave Who Dared To Feel Like A Man.\n\n\nTwo years had passed since I entered Dr. Flint's family, and those years\nhad brought much of the knowledge that comes from experience, though they\nhad afforded little opportunity for any other kinds of knowledge.\n\nMy grandmother had, as much as possible, been a mother to her orphan\ngrandchildren. By perseverance and unwearied industry, she was now mistress\nof a snug little home, surrounded with the necessaries of life. She would\nhave been happy could her children have shared them with her. There\nremained but three children and two grandchildren, all slaves. Most\nearnestly did she strive to make us feel that it was the will of God: that\nHe had seen fit to place us under such circumstances; and though it seemed\nhard, we ought to pray for contentment.\n\nIt was a beautiful faith, coming from a mother who could not call her\nchildren her own. But I, and Benjamin, her youngest boy, condemned it. We\nreasoned that it was much more the will of God that we should be situated\nas she was. We longed for a home like hers. There we always found sweet\nbalsam for our troubles. She was so loving, so sympathizing! She always met\nus with a smile, and listened with patience to all our sorrows. She spoke\nso hopefully, that unconsciously the clouds gave place to sunshine. There\nwas a grand big oven there, too, that baked bread and nice things for the\ntown, and we knew there was always a choice bit in store for us.\n\nBut, alas! Even the charms of the old oven failed to reconcile us to our\nhard lot. Benjamin was now a tall, handsome lad, strongly and gracefully\nmade, and with a spirit too bold and daring for a slave. My brother\nWilliam, now twelve years old, had the same aversion to the word master\nthat he had when he was an urchin of seven years. I was his confidant. He\ncame to me with all his troubles. I remember one instance in particular. It\nwas on a lovely spring morning, and when I marked the sunlight dancing here\nand there, its beauty seemed to mock my sadness. For my master, whose\nrestless, craving, vicious nature roved about day and night, seeking whom\nto devour, had just left me, with stinging, scorching words; words that\nscathed ear and brain like fire. O, how I despised him! I thought how glad\nI should be, if some day when he walked the earth, it would open and\nswallow him up, and disencumber the world of a plague.\n\nWhen he told me that I was made for his use, made to obey his command in\n_every_ thing; that I was nothing but a slave, whose will must and should\nsurrender to his, never before had my puny arm felt half so strong.\n\nSo deeply was I absorbed in painful reflections afterwards, that I neither\nsaw nor heard the entrance of any one, till the voice of William sounded\nclose beside me. \"Linda,\" said he, \"what makes you look so sad? I love you.\nO, Linda, isn't this a bad world? Every body seems so cross and unhappy. I\nwish I had died when poor father did.\"\n\nI told him that every body was _not_ cross, or unhappy; that those who had\npleasant homes, and kind friends, and who were not afraid to love them,\nwere happy. But we, who were slave-children, without father or mother,\ncould not expect to be happy. We must be good; perhaps that would bring us\ncontentment.\n\n\"Yes,\" he said, \"I try to be good; but what's the use? They are all the\ntime troubling me.\" Then he proceeded to relate his afternoon's difficulty\nwith young master Nicholas. It seemed that the brother of master Nicholas\nhad pleased himself with making up stories about William. Master Nicholas\nsaid he should be flogged, and he would do it. Whereupon he went to work;\nbut William fought bravely, and the young master, finding he was getting\nthe better of him, undertook to tie his hands behind him. He failed in that\nlikewise. By dint of kicking and fisting, William came out of the skirmish\nnone the worse for a few scratches.\n\nHe continued to discourse, on his young master's _meanness_; how he whipped\nthe _little_ boys, but was a perfect coward when a tussle ensued between\nhim and white boys of his own size. On such occasions he always took to his\nlegs. William had other charges to make against him. One was his rubbing up\npennies with quicksilver, and passing them off for quarters of a dollar on\nan old man who kept a fruit stall. William was often sent to buy fruit, and\nhe earnestly inquired of me what he ought to do under such circumstances. I\ntold him it was certainly wrong to deceive the old man, and that it was his\nduty to tell him of the impositions practised by his young master. I\nassured him the old man would not be slow to comprehend the whole, and\nthere the matter would end. William thought it might with the old man, but\nnot with _him_. He said he did not mind the smart of the whip, but he did\nnot like the _idea_ of being whipped.\n\nWhile I advised him to be good and forgiving I was not unconscious of the\nbeam in my own eye. It was the very knowledge of my own shortcomings that\nurged me to retain, if possible, some sparks of my brother's God-given\nnature. I had not lived fourteen years in slavery for nothing. I had felt,\nseen, and heard enough, to read the characters, and question the motives,\nof those around me. The war of my life had begun; and though one of God's\nmost powerless creatures, I resolved never to be conquered. Alas, for me!\n\nIf there was one pure, sunny spot for me, I believed it to be in Benjamin's\nheart, and in another's, whom I loved with all the ardor of a girl's first\nlove. My owner knew of it, and sought in every way to render me miserable.\nHe did not resort to corporal punishment, but to all the petty, tyrannical\nways that human ingenuity could devise.\n\nI remember the first time I was punished. It was in the month of February.\nMy grandmother had taken my old shoes, and replaced them with a new pair. I\nneeded them; for several inches of snow had fallen, and it still continued\nto fall. When I walked through Mrs. Flint's room, their creaking grated\nharshly on her refined nerves. She called me to her, and asked what I had\nabout me that made such a horrid noise. I told her it was my new shoes.\n\"Take them off,\" said she; \"and if you put them on again, I'll throw them\ninto the fire.\"\n\nI took them off, and my stockings also. She then sent me a long distance,\non an errand. As I went through the snow, my bare feet tingled. That night\nI was very hoarse; and I went to bed thinking the next day would find me\nsick, perhaps dead. What was my grief on waking to find myself quite well!\n\nI had imagined if I died, or was laid up for some time, that my mistress\nwould feel a twinge of remorse that she had so hated \"the little imp,\" as\nshe styled me. It was my ignorance of that mistress that gave rise to such\nextravagant imaginings.\n\nDr. Flint occasionally had high prices offered for me; but he always said,\n\"She don't belong to me. She is my daughter's property, and I have no right\nto sell her.\" Good, honest man! My young mistress was still a child, and I\ncould look for no protection from her. I loved her, and she returned my\naffection. I once heard her father allude to her attachment to me, and his\nwife promptly replied that it proceeded from fear. This put unpleasant\ndoubts into my mind. Did the child feign what she did not feel? or was her\nmother jealous of the mite of love she bestowed on me? I concluded it must\nbe the latter. I said to myself, \"Surely, little children are true.\"\n\nOne afternoon I sat at my sewing, feeling unusual depression of spirits. My\nmistress had been accusing me of an offence, of which I assured her I was\nperfectly innocent; but I saw, by the contemptuous curl of her lip, that\nshe believed I was telling a lie.\n\nI wondered for what wise purpose God was leading me through such thorny\npaths, and whether still darker days were in store for me. As I sat musing\nthus, the door opened softly, and William came in. \"Well, brother,\" said I,\n\"what is the matter this time?\"\n\n\"O Linda, Ben and his master have had a dreadful time!\" said he.\n\nMy first thought was that Benjamin was killed. \"Don't be frightened,\nLinda,\" said William; \"I will tell you all about it.\"\n\nIt appeared that Benjamin's master had sent for him, and he did not\nimmediately obey the summons. When he did, his master was angry, and began\nto whip him. He resisted. Master and slave fought, and finally the master\nwas thrown. Benjamin had cause to tremble; for he had thrown to the ground\nhis master--one of the richest men in town. I anxiously awaited the\nresult.\n\nThat night I stole to my grandmother's house; and Benjamin also stole\nthither from his master's. My grandmother had gone to spend a day or two\nwith an old friend living in the country.\n\n\"I have come,\" said Benjamin, \"to tell you good by. I am going away.\"\n\nI inquired where.\n\n\"To the north,\" he replied.\n\nI looked at him to see whether he was in earnest. I saw it all in his firm,\nset mouth. I implored him not to go, but he paid no heed to my words. He\nsaid he was no longer a boy, and every day made his yoke more galling. He\nhad raised his hand against his master, and was to be publicly whipped for\nthe offence. I reminded him of the poverty and hardships he must encounter\namong strangers. I told him he might be caught and brought back; and that\nwas terrible to think of.\n\nHe grew vexed, and asked if poverty and hardships with freedom, were not\npreferable to our treatment in slavery. \"Linda,\" he continued, \"we are dogs\nhere; foot-balls, cattle, every thing that's mean. No, I will not stay. Let\nthem bring me back. We don't die but once.\"\n\nHe was right; but it was hard to give him up. \"Go,\" said I, \"and break your\nmother's heart.\"\n\nI repented of my words ere they were out.\n\n\"Linda,\" said he, speaking as I had not heard him speak that evening, \"how\n_could_ you say that? Poor mother! be kind to her, Linda; and you, too,\ncousin Fanny.\"\n\nCousin Fanny was a friend who had lived some years with us.\n\nFarewells were exchanged, and the bright, kind boy, endeared to us by so\nmany acts of love, vanished from our sight.\n\nIt is not necessary to state how he made his escape. Suffice it to say, he\nwas on his way to New York when a violent storm overtook the vessel. The\ncaptain said he must put into the nearest port. This alarmed Benjamin, who\nwas aware that he would be advertised in every port near his own town. His\nembarrassment was noticed by the captain. To port they went. There the\nadvertisement met the captain's eye. Benjamin so exactly answered its\ndescription, that the captain laid hold on him, and bound him in chains.\nThe storm passed, and they proceeded to New York. Before reaching that port\nBenjamin managed to get off his chains and throw them overboard. He escaped\nfrom the vessel, but was pursued, captured, and carried back to his master.\n\nWhen my grandmother returned home and found her youngest child had fled,\ngreat was her sorrow; but, with characteristic piety, she said, \"God's will\nbe done.\" Each morning, she inquired if any news had been heard from her\nboy. Yes, news _was_ heard. The master was rejoicing over a letter,\nannouncing the capture of his human chattel.\n\nThat day seems but as yesterday, so well do I remember it. I saw him led\nthrough the streets in chains, to jail. His face was ghastly pale, yet full\nof determination. He had begged one of the sailors to go to his mother's\nhouse and ask her not to meet him. He said the sight of her distress would\ntake from him all self-control. She yearned to see him, and she went; but\nshe screened herself in the crowd, that it might be as her child had said.\n\nWe were not allowed to visit him; but we had known the jailer for years,\nand he was a kind-hearted man. At midnight he opened the jail door for my\ngrandmother and myself to enter, in disguise. When we entered the cell not\na sound broke the stillness. \"Benjamin, Benjamin!\" whispered my\ngrandmother. No answer. \"Benjamin!\" she again faltered. There was a jingle\nof chains. The moon had just risen, and cast an uncertain light through the\nbars of the window. We knelt down and took Benjamin's cold hands in ours.\nWe did not speak. Sobs were heard, and Benjamin's lips were unsealed; for\nhis mother was weeping on his neck. How vividly does memory bring back that\nsad night! Mother and son talked together. He asked her pardon for the\nsuffering he had caused her. She said she had nothing to forgive; she could\nnot blame his desire for freedom. He told her that when he was captured, he\nbroke away, and was about casting himself into the river, when thoughts of\n_her_ came over him, and he desisted. She asked if he did not also think of\nGod. I fancied I saw his face grow fierce in the moonlight. He answered,\n\"No, I did not think of him. When a man is hunted like a wild beast he\nforgets there is a God, a heaven. He forgets every thing in his struggle to\nget beyond the reach of the bloodhounds.\"\n\n\"Don't talk so, Benjamin,\" said she. \"Put your trust in God. Be humble, my\nchild, and your master will forgive you.\"\n\n\"Forgive me for _what_, mother? For not letting him treat me like a dog?\nNo! I will never humble myself to him. I have worked for him for nothing\nall my life, and I am repaid with stripes and imprisonment. Here I will\nstay till I die, or till he sells me.\"\n\nThe poor mother shuddered at his words. I think he felt it; for when he\nnext spoke, his voice was calmer. \"Don't fret about me, mother. I ain't\nworth it,\" said he. \"I wish I had some of your goodness. You bear every\nthing patiently, just as though you thought it was all right. I wish I\ncould.\"\n\nShe told him she had not always been so; once, she was like him; but when\nsore troubles came upon her, and she had no arm to lean upon, she learned\nto call on God, and he lightened her burdens. She besought him to do\nlikewise.\n\nWe overstaid our time, and were obliged to hurry from the jail.\n\nBenjamin had been imprisoned three weeks, when my grandmother went to\nintercede for him with his master. He was immovable. He said Benjamin\nshould serve as an example to the rest of his slaves; he should be kept in\njail till he was subdued, or be sold if he got but one dollar for him.\nHowever, he afterwards relented in some degree. The chains were taken off,\nand we were allowed to visit him.\n\nAs his food was of the coarsest kind, we carried him as often as possible a\nwarm supper, accompanied with some little luxury for the jailer.\n\nThree months elapsed, and there was no prospect of release or of a\npurchaser. One day he was heard to sing and laugh. This piece of indecorum\nwas told to his master, and the overseer was ordered to re-chain him. He\nwas now confined in an apartment with other prisoners, who were covered\nwith filthy rags. Benjamin was chained near them, and was soon covered with\nvermin. He worked at his chains till he succeeded in getting out of them.\nHe passed them through the bars of the window, with a request that they\nshould be taken to his master, and he should be informed that he was\ncovered with vermin.\n\nThis audacity was punished with heavier chains, and prohibition of our\nvisits.\n\nMy grandmother continued to send him fresh changes of clothes. The old ones\nwere burned up. The last night we saw him in jail his mother still begged\nhim to send for his master, and beg his pardon. Neither persuasion nor\nargument could turn him from his purpose. He calmly answered, \"I am waiting\nhis time.\"\n\nThose chains were mournful to hear.\n\nAnother three months passed, and Benjamin left his prison walls. We that\nloved him waited to bid him a long and last farewell. A slave trader had\nbought him. You remember, I told you what price he brought when ten years\nof age. Now he was more than twenty years old, and sold for three hundred\ndollars. The master had been blind to his own interest. Long confinement\nhad made his face too pale, his form too thin; moreover, the trader had\nheard something of his character, and it did not strike him as suitable for\na slave. He said he would give any price if the handsome lad was a girl. We\nthanked God that he was not.\n\nCould you have seen that mother clinging to her child, when they fastened\nthe irons upon his wrists; could you have heard her heart-rending groans,\nand seen her bloodshot eyes wander wildly from face to face, vainly\npleading for mercy; could you have witnessed that scene as I saw it, you\nwould exclaim, _Slavery is damnable_! Benjamin, her youngest, her pet, was\nforever gone! She could not realize it. She had had an interview with the\ntrader for the purpose of ascertaining if Benjamin could be purchased. She\nwas told it was impossible, as he had given bonds not to sell him till he\nwas out of the state. He promised that he would not sell him till he\nreached New Orleans.\n\nWith a strong arm and unvaried trust, my grandmother began her work of\nlove. Benjamin must be free. If she succeeded, she knew they would still be\nseparated; but the sacrifice was not too great. Day and night she labored.\nThe trader's price would treble that he gave; but she was not discouraged.\n\nShe employed a lawyer to write to a gentleman, whom she knew, in New\nOrleans. She begged him to interest himself for Benjamin, and he willingly\nfavored her request. When he saw Benjamin, and stated his business, he\nthanked him; but said he preferred to wait a while before making the trader\nan offer. He knew he had tried to obtain a high price for him, and had\ninvariably failed. This encouraged him to make another effort for freedom.\nSo one morning, long before day, Benjamin was missing. He was riding over\nthe blue billows, bound for Baltimore.\n\nFor once his white face did him a kindly service. They had no suspicion\nthat it belonged to a slave; otherwise, the law would have been followed\nout to the letter, and the _thing_ rendered back to slavery. The brightest\nskies are often overshadowed by the darkest clouds. Benjamin was taken\nsick, and compelled to remain in Baltimore three weeks. His strength was\nslow in returning; and his desire to continue his journey seemed to retard\nhis recovery. How could he get strength without air and exercise? He\nresolved to venture on a short walk. A by-street was selected, where he\nthought himself secure of not being met by any one that knew him; but a\nvoice called out, \"Halloo, Ben, my boy! what are you doing _here_!\"\n\nHis first impulse was to run; but his legs trembled so that he could not\nstir. He turned to confront his antagonist, and behold, there stood his old\nmaster's next door neighbor! He thought it was all over with him now; but\nit proved otherwise. That man was a miracle. He possessed a goodly number\nof slaves, and yet was not quite deaf to that mystic clock, whose ticking\nis rarely heard in the slaveholder's breast.\n\n\"Ben, you are sick,\" said he. \"Why, you look like a ghost. I guess I gave\nyou something of a start. Never mind, Ben, I am not going to touch you. You\nhad a pretty tough time of it, and you may go on your way rejoicing for all\nme. But I would advise you to get out of this place plaguy quick, for there\nare several gentlemen here from our town.\" He described the nearest and\nsafest route to New York, and added, \"I shall be glad to tell your mother I\nhave seen you. Good by, Ben.\"\n\nBenjamin turned away, filled with gratitude, and surprised that the town he\nhated contained such a gem--a gem worthy of a purer setting.\n\nThis gentleman was a Northerner by birth, and had married a southern lady.\nOn his return, he told my grandmother that he had seen her son, and of the\nservice he had rendered him.\n\nBenjamin reached New York safely, and concluded to stop there until he had\ngained strength enough to proceed further. It happened that my\ngrandmother's only remaining son had sailed for the same city on business\nfor his mistress. Through God's providence, the brothers met. You may be\nsure it was a happy meeting. \"O Phil,\" exclaimed Benjamin, \"I am here at\nlast.\" Then he told him how near he came to dying, almost in sight of free\nland, and how he prayed that he might live to get one breath of free air.\nHe said life was worth something now, and it would be hard to die. In the\nold jail he had not valued it; once, he was tempted to destroy it; but\nsomething, he did not know what, had prevented him; perhaps it was fear. He\nhad heard those who profess to be religious declare there was no heaven for\nself-murderers; and as his life had been pretty hot here, he did not desire\na continuation of the same in another world. \"If I die now,\" he exclaimed,\n\"thank God, I shall die a freeman!\"\n\nHe begged my uncle Phillip not to return south; but stay and work with him,\ntill they earned enough to buy those at home. His brother told him it would\nkill their mother if he deserted her in her trouble. She had pledged her\nhouse, and with difficulty had raised money to buy him. Would he be bought?\n\n\"No, never!\" he replied. \"Do you suppose, Phil, when I have got so far out\nof their clutches, I will give them one red cent? No! And do you suppose I\nwould turn mother out of her home in her old age? That I would let her pay\nall those hard-earned dollars for me, and never to see me? For you know she\nwill stay south as long as her other children are slaves. What a good\nmother! Tell her to buy _you_, Phil. You have been a comfort to her, and I\nhave been a trouble. And Linda, poor Linda; what'll become of her? Phil,\nyou don't know what a life they lead her. She has told me something about\nit, and I wish old Flint was dead, or a better man. When I was in jail, he\nasked her if she didn't want _him_ to ask my master to forgive me, and take\nme home again. She told him, No; that I didn't want to go back. He got mad,\nand said we were all alike. I never despised my own master half as much as\nI do that man. There is many a worse slaveholder than my master; but for\nall that I would not be his slave.\"\n\nWhile Benjamin was sick, he had parted with nearly all his clothes to pay\nnecessary expenses. But he did not part with a little pin I fastened in his\nbosom when we parted. It was the most valuable thing I owned, and I thought\nnone more worthy to wear it. He had it still.\n\nHis brother furnished him with clothes, and gave him what money he had.\n\nThey parted with moistened eyes; and as Benjamin turned away, he said,\n\"Phil, I part with all my kindred.\" And so it proved. We never heard from\nhim again.\n\nUncle Phillip came home; and the first words he uttered when he entered the\nhouse were, \"Mother, Ben is free! I have seen him in New York.\" She stood\nlooking at him with a bewildered air. \"Mother, don't you believe it?\" he\nsaid, laying his hand softly upon her shoulder. She raised her hands, and\nexclaimed, \"God be praised! Let us thank him.\" She dropped on her knees,\nand poured forth her heart in prayer. Then Phillip must sit down and repeat\nto her every word Benjamin had said. He told her all; only he forbore to\nmention how sick and pale her darling looked. Why should he distress her\nwhen she could do him no good?\n\nThe brave old woman still toiled on, hoping to rescue some of her other\nchildren. After a while she succeeded in buying Phillip. She paid eight\nhundred dollars, and came home with the precious document that secured his\nfreedom. The happy mother and son sat together by the old hearthstone that\nnight, telling how proud they were of each other, and how they would prove\nto the world that they could take care of themselves, as they had long\ntaken care of others. We all concluded by saying, \"He that is _willing_ to\nbe a slave, let him be a slave.\"\n\n\n\nV. The Trials Of Girlhood.\n\n\nDuring the first years of my service in Dr. Flint's family, I was\naccustomed to share some indulgences with the children of my mistress.\nThough this seemed to me no more than right, I was grateful for it, and\ntried to merit the kindness by the faithful discharge of my duties. But I\nnow entered on my fifteenth year--a sad epoch in the life of a slave girl.\nMy master began to whisper foul words in my ear. Young as I was, I could\nnot remain ignorant of their import. I tried to treat them with\nindifference or contempt. The master's age, my extreme youth, and the fear\nthat his conduct would be reported to my grandmother, made him bear this\ntreatment for many months. He was a crafty man, and resorted to many means\nto accomplish his purposes. Sometimes he had stormy, terrific ways, that\nmade his victims tremble; sometimes he assumed a gentleness that he thought\nmust surely subdue. Of the two, I preferred his stormy moods, although they\nleft me trembling. He tried his utmost to corrupt the pure principles my\ngrandmother had instilled. He peopled my young mind with unclean images,\nsuch as only a vile monster could think of. I turned from him with disgust\nand hatred. But he was my master. I was compelled to live under the same\nroof with him--where I saw a man forty years my senior daily violating the\nmost sacred commandments of nature. He told me I was his property; that I\nmust be subject to his will in all things. My soul revolted against the\nmean tyranny. But where could I turn for protection? No matter whether the\nslave girl be as black as ebony or as fair as her mistress. In either case,\nthere is no shadow of law to protect her from insult, from violence, or\neven from death; all these are inflicted by fiends who bear the shape of\nmen. The mistress, who ought to protect the helpless victim, has no other\nfeelings towards her but those of jealousy and rage. The degradation, the\nwrongs, the vices, that grow out of slavery, are more than I can describe.\nThey are greater than you would willingly believe. Surely, if you credited\none half the truths that are told you concerning the helpless millions\nsuffering in this cruel bondage, you at the north would not help to tighten\nthe yoke. You surely would refuse to do for the master, on your own soil,\nthe mean and cruel work which trained bloodhounds and the lowest class of\nwhites do for him at the south.\n\nEvery where the years bring to all enough of sin and sorrow; but in slavery\nthe very dawn of life is darkened by these shadows. Even the little child,\nwho is accustomed to wait on her mistress and her children, will learn,\nbefore she is twelve years old, why it is that her mistress hates such and\nsuch a one among the slaves. Perhaps the child's own mother is among those\nhated ones. She listens to violent outbreaks of jealous passion, and cannot\nhelp understanding what is the cause. She will become prematurely knowing\nin evil things. Soon she will learn to tremble when she hears her master's\nfootfall. She will be compelled to realize that she is no longer a child.\nIf God has bestowed beauty upon her, it will prove her greatest curse. That\nwhich commands admiration in the white woman only hastens the degradation\nof the female slave. I know that some are too much brutalized by slavery to\nfeel the humiliation of their position; but many slaves feel it most\nacutely, and shrink from the memory of it. I cannot tell how much I\nsuffered in the presence of these wrongs, nor how I am still pained by the\nretrospect. My master met me at every turn, reminding me that I belonged to\nhim, and swearing by heaven and earth that he would compel me to submit to\nhim. If I went out for a breath of fresh air, after a day of unwearied\ntoil, his footsteps dogged me. If I knelt by my mother's grave, his dark\nshadow fell on me even there. The light heart which nature had given me\nbecame heavy with sad forebodings. The other slaves in my master's house\nnoticed the change. Many of them pitied me; but none dared to ask the\ncause. They had no need to inquire. They knew too well the guilty practices\nunder that roof; and they were aware that to speak of them was an offence\nthat never went unpunished.\n\nI longed for some one to confide in. I would have given the world to have\nlaid my head on my grandmother's faithful bosom, and told her all my\ntroubles. But Dr. Flint swore he would kill me, if I was not as silent as\nthe grave. Then, although my grandmother was all in all to me, I feared her\nas well as loved her. I had been accustomed to look up to her with a\nrespect bordering upon awe. I was very young, and felt shamefaced about\ntelling her such impure things, especially as I knew her to be very strict\non such subjects. Moreover, she was a woman of a high spirit. She was\nusually very quiet in her demeanor; but if her indignation was once\nroused, it was not very easily quelled. I had been told that she once\nchased a white gentleman with a loaded pistol, because he insulted one\nof her daughters. I dreaded the consequences of a violent outbreak;\nand both pride and fear kept me silent. But though I did not confide\nin my grandmother, and even evaded her vigilant watchfulness and inquiry,\nher presence in the neighborhood was some protection to me. Though she\nhad been a slave, Dr. Flint was afraid of her. He dreaded her scorching\nrebukes. Moreover, she was known and patronized by many people; and he\ndid not wish to have his villany made public. It was lucky for me that\nI did not live on a distant plantation, but in a town not so large that\nthe inhabitants were ignorant of each other's affairs. Bad as are the\nlaws and customs in a slaveholding community, the doctor, as a\nprofessional man, deemed it prudent to keep up some outward show of\ndecency.\n\nO, what days and nights of fear and sorrow that man caused me! Reader, it\nis not to awaken sympathy for myself that I am telling you truthfully what\nI suffered in slavery. I do it to kindle a flame of compassion in your\nhearts for my sisters who are still in bondage, suffering as I once\nsuffered.\n\nI once saw two beautiful children playing together. One was a fair white\nchild; the other was her slave, and also her sister. When I saw them\nembracing each other, and heard their joyous laughter, I turned sadly away\nfrom the lovely sight. I foresaw the inevitable blight that would fall on\nthe little slave's heart. I knew how soon her laughter would be changed to\nsighs. The fair child grew up to be a still fairer woman. From childhood to\nwomanhood her pathway was blooming with flowers, and overarched by a sunny\nsky. Scarcely one day of her life had been clouded when the sun rose on her\nhappy bridal morning.\n\nHow had those years dealt with her slave sister, the little playmate of her\nchildhood? She, also, was very beautiful; but the flowers and sunshine of\nlove were not for her. She drank the cup of sin, and shame, and misery,\nwhereof her persecuted race are compelled to drink.\n\nIn view of these things, why are ye silent, ye free men and women of the\nnorth? Why do your tongues falter in maintenance of the right? Would that I\nhad more ability! But my heart is so full, and my pen is so weak! There are\nnoble men and women who plead for us, striving to help those who cannot\nhelp themselves. God bless them! God give them strength and courage to go\non! God bless those, every where, who are laboring to advance the cause of\nhumanity!\n\n\n\nVI. The Jealous Mistress.\n\n\nI would ten thousand times rather that my children should be the\nhalf-starved paupers of Ireland than to be the most pampered among the\nslaves of America. I would rather drudge out my life on a cotton\nplantation, till the grave opened to give me rest, than to live with an\nunprincipled master and a jealous mistress. The felon's home in a\npenitentiary is preferable. He may repent, and turn from the error of his\nways, and so find peace; but it is not so with a favorite slave. She is not\nallowed to have any pride of character. It is deemed a crime in her to wish\nto be virtuous.\n\nMrs. Flint possessed the key to her husband's character before I was born.\nShe might have used this knowledge to counsel and to screen the young and\nthe innocent among her slaves; but for them she had no sympathy. They were\nthe objects of her constant suspicion and malevolence. She watched her\nhusband with unceasing vigilance; but he was well practised in means to\nevade it. What he could not find opportunity to say in words he manifested\nin signs. He invented more than were ever thought of in a deaf and dumb\nasylum. I let them pass, as if I did not understand what he meant; and many\nwere the curses and threats bestowed on me for my stupidity. One day he\ncaught me teaching myself to write. He frowned, as if he was not well\npleased; but I suppose he came to the conclusion that such an\naccomplishment might help to advance his favorite scheme. Before long,\nnotes were often slipped into my hand. I would return them, saying, \"I\ncan't read them, sir.\" \"Can't you?\" he replied; \"then I must read them to\nyou.\" He always finished the reading by asking, \"Do you understand?\"\nSometimes he would complain of the heat of the tea room, and order his\nsupper to be placed on a small table in the piazza. He would seat himself\nthere with a well-satisfied smile, and tell me to stand by and brush away\nthe flies. He would eat very slowly, pausing between the mouthfuls. These\nintervals were employed in describing the happiness I was so foolishly\nthrowing away, and in threatening me with the penalty that finally awaited\nmy stubborn disobedience. He boasted much of the forbearance he had\nexercised towards me, and reminded me that there was a limit to his\npatience. When I succeeded in avoiding opportunities for him to talk to me\nat home, I was ordered to come to his office, to do some errand. When\nthere, I was obliged to stand and listen to such language as he saw fit to\naddress to me. Sometimes I so openly expressed my contempt for him that he\nwould become violently enraged, and I wondered why he did not strike me.\nCircumstanced as he was, he probably thought it was better policy to be\nforebearing. But the state of things grew worse and worse daily. In\ndesperation I told him that I must and would apply to my grandmother for\nprotection. He threatened me with death, and worse than death, if I made\nany complaint to her. Strange to say, I did not despair. I was naturally of\na buoyant disposition, and always I had a hope of somehow getting out of\nhis clutches. Like many a poor, simple slave before me, I trusted that some\nthreads of joy would yet be woven into my dark destiny.\n\nI had entered my sixteenth year, and every day it became more apparent that\nmy presence was intolerable to Mrs. Flint. Angry words frequently passed\nbetween her and her husband. He had never punished me himself, and he would\nnot allow any body else to punish me. In that respect, she was never\nsatisfied; but, in her angry moods, no terms were too vile for her to\nbestow upon me. Yet I, whom she detested so bitterly, had far more pity for\nher than he had, whose duty it was to make her life happy. I never wronged\nher, or wished to wrong her, and one word of kindness from her would have\nbrought me to her feet.\n\nAfter repeated quarrels between the doctor and his wife, he announced his\nintention to take his youngest daughter, then four years old, to sleep in\nhis apartment. It was necessary that a servant should sleep in the same\nroom, to be on hand if the child stirred. I was selected for that office,\nand informed for what purpose that arrangement had been made. By managing\nto keep within sight of people, as much as possible, during the day time, I\nhad hitherto succeeded in eluding my master, though a razor was often held\nto my throat to force me to change this line of policy. At night I slept by\nthe side of my great aunt, where I felt safe. He was too prudent to come\ninto her room. She was an old woman, and had been in the family many years.\nMoreover, as a married man, and a professional man, he deemed it necessary\nto save appearances in some degree. But he resolved to remove the obstacle\nin the way of his scheme; and he thought he had planned it so that he\nshould evade suspicion. He was well aware how much I prized my refuge by\nthe side of my old aunt, and he determined to dispossess me of it. The\nfirst night the doctor had the little child in his room alone. The next\nmorning, I was ordered to take my station as nurse the following night. A\nkind Providence interposed in my favor. During the day Mrs. Flint heard of\nthis new arrangement, and a storm followed. I rejoiced to hear it rage.\n\nAfter a while my mistress sent for me to come to her room. Her first\nquestion was, \"Did you know you were to sleep in the doctor's room?\"\n\n\"Yes, ma'am.\"\n\n\"Who told you?\"\n\n\"My master.\"\n\n\"Will you answer truly all the questions I ask?\"\n\n\"Yes, ma'am.\"\n\n\"Tell me, then, as you hope to be forgiven, are you innocent of what I have\naccused you?\"\n\n\"I am.\"\n\nShe handed me a Bible, and said, \"Lay your hand on your heart, kiss this\nholy book, and swear before God that you tell me the truth.\"\n\nI took the oath she required, and I did it with a clear conscience.\n\n\"You have taken God's holy word to testify your innocence,\" said she. \"If\nyou have deceived me, beware! Now take this stool, sit down, look me\ndirectly in the face, and tell me all that has passed between your master\nand you.\"\n\nI did as she ordered. As I went on with my account her color changed\nfrequently, she wept, and sometimes groaned. She spoke in tones so sad,\nthat I was touched by her grief. The tears came to my eyes; but I was soon\nconvinced that her emotions arose from anger and wounded pride. She felt\nthat her marriage vows were desecrated, her dignity insulted; but she had\nno compassion for the poor victim of her husband's perfidy. She pitied\nherself as a martyr; but she was incapable of feeling for the condition of\nshame and misery in which her unfortunate, helpless slave was placed. Yet\nperhaps she had some touch of feeling for me; for when the conference was\nended, she spoke kindly, and promised to protect me. I should have been\nmuch comforted by this assurance if I could have had confidence in it; but\nmy experiences in slavery had filled me with distrust. She was not a very\nrefined woman, and had not much control over her passions. I was an object\nof her jealousy, and, consequently, of her hatred; and I knew I could not\nexpect kindness or confidence from her under the circumstances in which I\nwas placed. I could not blame her. Slaveholders' wives feel as other women\nwould under similar circumstances. The fire of her temper kindled from\nsmall-sparks, and now the flame became so intense that the doctor was\nobliged to give up his intended arrangement.\n\nI knew I had ignited the torch, and I expected to suffer for it afterwards;\nbut I felt too thankful to my mistress for the timely aid she rendered me\nto care much about that. She now took me to sleep in a room adjoining her\nown. There I was an object of her especial care, though not to her especial\ncomfort, for she spent many a sleepless night to watch over me. Sometimes I\nwoke up, and found her bending over me. At other times she whispered in my\near, as though it was her husband who was speaking to me, and listened to\nhear what I would answer. If she startled me, on such occasions, she would\nglide stealthily away; and the next morning she would tell me I had been\ntalking in my sleep, and ask who I was talking to. At last, I began to be\nfearful for my life. It had been often threatened; and you can imagine,\nbetter than I can describe, what an unpleasant sensation it must produce to\nwake up in the dead of night and find a jealous woman bending over you.\nTerrible as this experience was, I had fears that it would give place to\none more terrible.\n\nMy mistress grew weary of her vigils; they did not prove satisfactory. She\nchanged her tactics. She now tried the trick of accusing my master of\ncrime, in my presence, and gave my name as the author of the accusation. To\nmy utter astonishment, he replied, \"I don't believe it; but if she did\nacknowledge it, you tortured her into exposing me.\" Tortured into exposing\nhim! Truly, Satan had no difficulty in distinguishing the color of his\nsoul! I understood his object in making this false representation. It was\nto show me that I gained nothing by seeking the protection of my mistress;\nthat the power was still all in his own hands. I pitied Mrs. Flint. She was\na second wife, many years the junior of her husband; and the hoary-headed\nmiscreant was enough to try the patience of a wiser and better woman. She\nwas completely foiled, and knew not how to proceed. She would gladly have\nhad me flogged for my supposed false oath; but, as I have already stated,\nthe doctor never allowed any one to whip me. The old sinner was politic.\nThe application of the lash might have led to remarks that would have\nexposed him in the eyes of his children and grandchildren. How often did I\nrejoice that I lived in a town where all the inhabitants knew each other!\nIf I had been on a remote plantation, or lost among the multitude of a\ncrowded city, I should not be a living woman at this day.\n\nThe secrets of slavery are concealed like those of the Inquisition. My\nmaster was, to my knowledge, the father of eleven slaves. But did the\nmothers dare to tell who was the father of their children? Did the other\nslaves dare to allude to it, except in whispers among themselves? No,\nindeed! They knew too well the terrible consequences.\n\nMy grandmother could not avoid seeing things which excited her suspicions.\nShe was uneasy about me, and tried various ways to buy me; but the\nnever-changing answer was always repeated: \"Linda does not belong to _me_.\nShe is my daughter's property, and I have no legal right to sell her.\" The\nconscientious man! He was too scrupulous to _sell_ me; but he had no\nscruples whatever about committing a much greater wrong against the\nhelpless young girl placed under his guardianship, as his daughter's\nproperty. Sometimes my persecutor would ask me whether I would like to be\nsold. I told him I would rather be sold to any body than to lead such a\nlife as I did. On such occasions he would assume the air of a very injured\nindividual, and reproach me for my ingratitude. \"Did I not take you into\nthe house, and make you the companion of my own children?\" he would say.\n\"Have _I_ ever treated you like a negro? I have never allowed you to be\npunished, not even to please your mistress. And this is the recompense I\nget, you ungrateful girl!\" I answered that he had reasons of his own for\nscreening me from punishment, and that the course he pursued made my\nmistress hate me and persecute me. If I wept, he would say, \"Poor child!\nDon't cry! don't cry! I will make peace for you with your mistress. Only\nlet me arrange matters in my own way. Poor, foolish girl! you don't know\nwhat is for your own good. I would cherish you. I would make a lady of you.\nNow go, and think of all I have promised you.\"\n\nI did think of it.\n\nReader, I draw no imaginary pictures of southern homes. I am telling you\nthe plain truth. Yet when victims make their escape from the wild beast of\nSlavery, northerners consent to act the part of bloodhounds, and hunt the\npoor fugitive back into his den, \"full of dead men's bones, and all\nuncleanness.\" Nay, more, they are not only willing, but proud, to give\ntheir daughters in marriage to slaveholders. The poor girls have romantic\nnotions of a sunny clime, and of the flowering vines that all the year\nround shade a happy home. To what disappointments are they destined! The\nyoung wife soon learns that the husband in whose hands she has placed her\nhappiness pays no regard to his marriage vows. Children of every shade of\ncomplexion play with her own fair babies, and too well she knows that they\nare born unto him of his own household. Jealousy and hatred enter the\nflowery home, and it is ravaged of its loveliness.\n\nSouthern women often marry a man knowing that he is the father of many\nlittle slaves. They do not trouble themselves about it. They regard such\nchildren as property, as marketable as the pigs on the plantation; and it\nis seldom that they do not make them aware of this by passing them into the\nslave-trader's hands as soon as possible, and thus getting them out of\ntheir sight. I am glad to say there are some honorable exceptions.\n\nI have myself known two southern wives who exhorted their husbands to free\nthose slaves towards whom they stood in a \"parental relation;\" and their\nrequest was granted. These husbands blushed before the superior nobleness\nof their wives' natures. Though they had only counselled them to do that\nwhich it was their duty to do, it commanded their respect, and rendered\ntheir conduct more exemplary. Concealment was at an end, and confidence\ntook the place of distrust.\n\nThough this bad institution deadens the moral sense, even in white women,\nto a fearful extent, it is not altogether extinct. I have heard southern\nladies say of Mr. Such a one, \"He not only thinks it no disgrace to be the\nfather of those little niggers, but he is not ashamed to call himself their\nmaster. I declare, such things ought not to be tolerated in any decent\nsociety!\"\n\n\n\nVII. The Lover.\n\n\nWhy does the slave ever love? Why allow the tendrils of the heart to twine\naround objects which may at any moment be wrenched away by the hand of\nviolence? When separations come by the hand of death, the pious soul can\nbow in resignation, and say, \"Not my will, but thine be done, O Lord!\" But\nwhen the ruthless hand of man strikes the blow, regardless of the misery he\ncauses, it is hard to be submissive. I did not reason thus when I was a\nyoung girl. Youth will be youth. I loved and I indulged the hope that the\ndark clouds around me would turn out a bright lining. I forgot that in the\nland of my birth the shadows are too dense for light to penetrate. A land\n\n   Where laughter is not mirth; nor thought the mind;\n   Nor words a language; nor e'en men mankind.\n   Where cries reply to curses, shrieks to blows,\n   And each is tortured in his separate hell.\n\nThere was in the neighborhood a young colored carpenter; a free born man.\nWe had been well acquainted in childhood, and frequently met together\nafterwards. We became mutually attached, and he proposed to marry me. I\nloved him with all the ardor of a young girl's first love. But when I\nreflected that I was a slave, and that the laws gave no sanction to the\nmarriage of such, my heart sank within me. My lover wanted to buy me; but I\nknew that Dr. Flint was too willful and arbitrary a man to consent to that\narrangement. From him, I was sure of experiencing all sort of opposition,\nand I had nothing to hope from my mistress. She would have been delighted\nto have got rid of me, but not in that way. It would have relieved her mind\nof a burden if she could have seen me sold to some distant state, but if I\nwas married near home I should be just as much in her husband's power as I\nhad previously been,--for the husband of a slave has no power to protect\nher. Moreover, my mistress, like many others, seemed to think that slaves\nhad no right to any family ties of their own; that they were created merely\nto wait upon the family of the mistress. I once heard her abuse a young\nslave girl, who told her that a colored man wanted to make her his wife. \"I\nwill have you peeled and pickled, my lady,\" said she, \"if I ever hear you\nmention that subject again. Do you suppose that I will have you tending\n_my_ children with the children of that nigger?\" The girl to whom she said\nthis had a mulatto child, of course not acknowledged by its father. The\npoor black man who loved her would have been proud to acknowledge his\nhelpless offspring.\n\nMany and anxious were the thoughts I revolved in my mind. I was at a loss\nwhat to do. Above all things, I was desirous to spare my lover the insults\nthat had cut so deeply into my own soul. I talked with my grandmother about\nit, and partly told her my fears. I did not dare to tell her the worst. She\nhad long suspected all was not right, and if I confirmed her suspicions I\nknew a storm would rise that would prove the overthrow of all my hopes.\n\nThis love-dream had been my support through many trials; and I could not\nbear to run the risk of having it suddenly dissipated. There was a lady in\nthe neighborhood, a particular friend of Dr. Flint's, who often visited the\nhouse. I had a great respect for her, and she had always manifested a\nfriendly interest in me. Grandmother thought she would have great influence\nwith the doctor. I went to this lady, and told her my story. I told her I\nwas aware that my lover's being a free-born man would prove a great\nobjection; but he wanted to buy me; and if Dr. Flint would consent to that\narrangement, I felt sure he would be willing to pay any reasonable price.\nShe knew that Mrs. Flint disliked me; therefore, I ventured to suggest that\nperhaps my mistress would approve of my being sold, as that would rid her\nof me. The lady listened with kindly sympathy, and promised to do her\nutmost to promote my wishes. She had an interview with the doctor, and I\nbelieve she pleaded my cause earnestly; but it was all to no purpose.\n\nHow I dreaded my master now! Every minute I expected to be summoned to his\npresence; but the day passed, and I heard nothing from him. The next\nmorning, a message was brought to me: \"Master wants you in his study.\" I\nfound the door ajar, and I stood a moment gazing at the hateful man who\nclaimed a right to rule me, body and soul. I entered, and tried to appear\ncalm. I did not want him to know how my heart was bleeding. He looked\nfixedly at me, with an expression which seemed to say, \"I have half a mind\nto kill you on the spot.\" At last he broke the silence, and that was a\nrelief to both of us.\n\n\"So you want to be married, do you?\" said he, \"and to a free nigger.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"Well, I'll soon convince you whether I am your master, or the nigger\nfellow you honor so highly. If you _must_ have a husband, you may take up\nwith one of my slaves.\"\n\nWhat a situation I should be in, as the wife of one of _his_ slaves, even\nif my heart had been interested!\n\nI replied, \"Don't you suppose, sir, that a slave can have some preference\nabout marrying? Do you suppose that all men are alike to her?\"\n\n\"Do you love this nigger?\" said he, abruptly.\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"How dare you tell me so!\" he exclaimed, in great wrath. After a slight\npause, he added, \"I supposed you thought more of yourself; that you felt\nabove the insults of such puppies.\"\n\nI replied, \"If he is a puppy, I am a puppy, for we are both of the negro\nrace. It is right and honorable for us to love each other. The man you call\na puppy never insulted me, sir; and he would not love me if he did not\nbelieve me to be a virtuous woman.\"\n\nHe sprang upon me like a tiger, and gave me a stunning blow. It was the\nfirst time he had ever struck me; and fear did not enable me to control my\nanger. When I had recovered a little from the effects, I exclaimed, \"You\nhave struck me for answering you honestly. How I despise you!\"\n\nThere was silence for some minutes. Perhaps he was deciding what should be\nmy punishment; or, perhaps, he wanted to give me time to reflect on what I\nhad said, and to whom I had said it. Finally, he asked, \"Do you know what\nyou have said?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir; but your treatment drove me to it.\"\n\n\"Do you know that I have a right to do as I like with you,--that I can kill\nyou, if I please?\"\n\n\"You have tried to kill me, and I wish you had; but you have no right to do\nas you like with me.\"\n\n\"Silence!\" he exclaimed, in a thundering voice. \"By heavens, girl, you\nforget yourself too far! Are you mad? If you are, I will soon bring you to\nyour senses. Do you think any other master would bear what I have borne\nfrom you this morning? Many masters would have killed you on the spot. How\nwould you like to be sent to jail for your insolence?\"\n\n\"I know I have been disrespectful, sir,\" I replied; \"but you drove me to\nit; I couldn't help it. As for the jail, there would be more peace for me\nthere than there is here.\"\n\n\"You deserve to go there,\" said he, \"and to be under such treatment, that\nyou would forget the meaning of the word _peace_. It would do you good. It\nwould take some of your high notions out of you. But I am not ready to send\nyou there yet, notwithstanding your ingratitude for all my kindness and\nforbearance. You have been the plague of my life. I have wanted to make you\nhappy, and I have been repaid with the basest ingratitude; but though you\nhave proved yourself incapable of appreciating my kindness, I will be\nlenient towards you, Linda. I will give you one more chance to redeem your\ncharacter. If you behave yourself and do as I require, I will forgive you\nand treat you as I always have done; but if you disobey me, I will punish\nyou as I would the meanest slave on my plantation. Never let me hear that\nfellow's name mentioned again. If I ever know of your speaking to him, I\nwill cowhide you both; and if I catch him lurking about my premises, I will\nshoot him as soon as I would a dog. Do you hear what I say? I'll teach you\na lesson about marriage and free niggers! Now go, and let this be the last\ntime I have occasion to speak to you on this subject.\"\n\nReader, did you ever hate? I hope not. I never did but once; and I trust I\nnever shall again. Somebody has called it \"the atmosphere of hell;\" and I\nbelieve it is so.\n\nFor a fortnight the doctor did not speak to me. He thought to mortify me;\nto make me feel that I had disgraced myself by receiving the honorable\naddresses of a respectable colored man, in preference to the base proposals\nof a white man. But though his lips disdained to address me, his eyes were\nvery loquacious. No animal ever watched its prey more narrowly than he\nwatched me. He knew that I could write, though he had failed to make me\nread his letters; and he was now troubled lest I should exchange letters\nwith another man. After a while he became weary of silence; and I was sorry\nfor it. One morning, as he passed through the hall, to leave the house, he\ncontrived to thrust a note into my hand. I thought I had better read it,\nand spare myself the vexation of having him read it to me. It expressed\nregret for the blow he had given me, and reminded me that I myself was\nwholly to blame for it. He hoped I had become convinced of the injury I was\ndoing myself by incurring his displeasure. He wrote that he had made up his\nmind to go to Louisiana; that he should take several slaves with him, and\nintended I should be one of the number. My mistress would remain where she\nwas; therefore I should have nothing to fear from that quarter. If I\nmerited kindness from him, he assured me that it would be lavishly\nbestowed. He begged me to think over the matter, and answer the following\nday.\n\nThe next morning I was called to carry a pair of scissors to his room. I\nlaid them on the table, with the letter beside them. He thought it was my\nanswer, and did not call me back. I went as usual to attend my young\nmistress to and from school. He met me in the street, and ordered me to\nstop at his office on my way back. When I entered, he showed me his letter,\nand asked me why I had not answered it. I replied, \"I am your daughter's\nproperty, and it is in your power to send me, or take me, wherever you\nplease.\" He said he was very glad to find me so willing to go, and that we\nshould start early in the autumn. He had a large practice in the town, and\nI rather thought he had made up the story merely to frighten me. However\nthat might be, I was determined that I would never go to Louisiana with\nhim.\n\nSummer passed away, and early in the autumn Dr. Flint's eldest son was sent\nto Louisiana to examine the country, with a view to emigrating. That news\ndid not disturb me. I knew very well that I should not be sent with _him_.\nThat I had not been taken to the plantation before this time, was owing to\nthe fact that his son was there. He was jealous of his son; and jealousy of\nthe overseer had kept him from punishing me by sending me into the fields\nto work. Is it strange, that I was not proud of these protectors? As for\nthe overseer, he was a man for whom I had less respect than I had for a\nbloodhound.\n\nYoung Mr. Flint did not bring back a favorable report of Louisiana, and I\nheard no more of that scheme. Soon after this, my lover met me at the\ncorner of the street, and I stopped to speak to him. Looking up, I saw my\nmaster watching us from his window. I hurried home, trembling with fear. I\nwas sent for, immediately, to go to his room. He met me with a blow. \"When\nis mistress to be married?\" said he, in a sneering tone. A shower of oaths\nand imprecations followed. How thankful I was that my lover was a free man!\nthat my tyrant had no power to flog him for speaking to me in the street!\n\nAgain and again I revolved in my mind how all this would end. There was no\nhope that the doctor would consent to sell me on any terms. He had an iron\nwill, and was determined to keep me, and to conquer me. My lover was an\nintelligent and religious man. Even if he could have obtained permission to\nmarry me while I was a slave, the marriage would give him no power to\nprotect me from my master. It would have made him miserable to witness the\ninsults I should have been subjected to. And then, if we had children, I\nknew they must \"follow the condition of the mother.\" What a terrible blight\nthat would be on the heart of a free, intelligent father! For _his_ sake, I\nfelt that I ought not to link his fate with my own unhappy destiny. He was\ngoing to Savannah to see about a little property left him by an uncle; and\nhard as it was to bring my feelings to it, I earnestly entreated him not to\ncome back. I advised him to go to the Free States, where his tongue would\nnot be tied, and where his intelligence would be of more avail to him. He\nleft me, still hoping the day would come when I could be bought. With me\nthe lamp of hope had gone out. The dream of my girlhood was over. I felt\nlonely and desolate.\n\nStill I was not stripped of all. I still had my good grandmother, and my\naffectionate brother. When he put his arms round my neck, and looked into\nmy eyes, as if to read there the troubles I dared not tell, I felt that I\nstill had something to love. But even that pleasant emotion was chilled by\nthe reflection that he might be torn from me at any moment, by some sudden\nfreak of my master. If he had known how we loved each other, I think he\nwould have exulted in separating us. We often planned together how we could\nget to the north. But, as William remarked, such things are easier said\nthan done. My movements were very closely watched, and we had no means of\ngetting any money to defray our expenses. As for grandmother, she was\nstrongly opposed to her children's undertaking any such project. She had\nnot forgotten poor Benjamin's sufferings, and she was afraid that if\nanother child tried to escape, he would have a similar or a worse fate. To\nme, nothing seemed more dreadful than my present life. I said to myself,\n\"William _must_ be free. He shall go to the north, and I will follow him.\"\nMany a slave sister has formed the same plans.\n\n\n\nVIII. What Slaves Are Taught To Think Of The North.\n\n\nSlaveholders pride themselves upon being honorable men; but if you were to\nhear the enormous lies they tell their slaves, you would have small respect\nfor their veracity. I have spoken plain English. Pardon me. I cannot use a\nmilder term. When they visit the north, and return home, they tell their\nslaves of the runaways they have seen, and describe them to be in the most\ndeplorable condition. A slaveholder once told me that he had seen a runaway\nfriend of mine in New York, and that she besought him to take her back to\nher master, for she was literally dying of starvation; that many days she\nhad only one cold potato to eat, and at other times could get nothing at\nall. He said he refused to take her, because he knew her master would not\nthank him for bringing such a miserable wretch to his house. He ended by\nsaying to me, \"This is the punishment she brought on herself for running\naway from a kind master.\"\n\nThis whole story was false. I afterwards staid with that friend in New\nYork, and found her in comfortable circumstances. She had never thought of\nsuch a thing as wishing to go back to slavery. Many of the slaves believe\nsuch stories, and think it is not worth while to exchange slavery for such\na hard kind of freedom. It is difficult to persuade such that freedom could\nmake them useful men, and enable them to protect their wives and children.\nIf those heathen in our Christian land had as much teaching as some\nHindoos, they would think otherwise. They would know that liberty is more\nvaluable than life. They would begin to understand their own capabilities,\nand exert themselves to become men and women.\n\nBut while the Free States sustain a law which hurls fugitives back into\nslavery, how can the slaves resolve to become men? There are some who\nstrive to protect wives and daughters from the insults of their masters;\nbut those who have such sentiments have had advantages above the general\nmass of slaves. They have been partially civilized and Christianized by\nfavorable circumstances. Some are bold enough to _utter_ such sentiments to\ntheir masters. O, that there were more of them!\n\nSome poor creatures have been so brutalized by the lash that they will\nsneak out of the way to give their masters free access to their wives and\ndaughters. Do you think this proves the black man to belong to an inferior\norder of beings? What would _you_ be, if you had been born and brought up a\nslave, with generations of slaves for ancestors? I admit that the black man\n_is_ inferior. But what is it that makes him so? It is the ignorance in\nwhich white men compel him to live; it is the torturing whip that lashes\nmanhood out of him; it is the fierce bloodhounds of the South, and the\nscarcely less cruel human bloodhounds of the north, who enforce the\nFugitive Slave Law. _They_ do the work.\n\nSouthern gentlemen indulge in the most contemptuous expressions about the\nYankees, while they, on their part, consent to do the vilest work for them,\nsuch as the ferocious bloodhounds and the despised negro-hunters are\nemployed to do at home. When southerners go to the north, they are proud to\ndo them honor; but the northern man is not welcome south of Mason and\nDixon's line, unless he suppresses every thought and feeling at variance\nwith their \"peculiar institution.\" Nor is it enough to be silent. The\nmasters are not pleased, unless they obtain a greater degree of\nsubservience than that; and they are generally accommodated. Do they\nrespect the northerner for this? I trow not. Even the slaves despise \"a\nnorthern man with southern principles;\" and that is the class they\ngenerally see. When northerners go to the south to reside, they prove very\napt scholars. They soon imbibe the sentiments and disposition of their\nneighbors, and generally go beyond their teachers. Of the two, they are\nproverbially the hardest masters.\n\nThey seem to satisfy their consciences with the doctrine that God created\nthe Africans to be slaves. What a libel upon the heavenly Father, who \"made\nof one blood all nations of men!\" And then who _are_ Africans? Who can\nmeasure the amount of Anglo-Saxon blood coursing in the veins of American\nslaves?\n\nI have spoken of the pains slaveholders take to give their slaves a bad\nopinion of the north; but, notwithstanding this, intelligent slaves are\naware that they have many friends in the Free States. Even the most\nignorant have some confused notions about it. They knew that I could read;\nand I was often asked if I had seen any thing in the newspapers about white\nfolks over in the big north, who were trying to get their freedom for them.\nSome believe that the abolitionists have already made them free, and that\nit is established by law, but that their masters prevent the law from going\ninto effect. One woman begged me to get a newspaper and read it over. She\nsaid her husband told her that the black people had sent word to the queen\nof 'Merica that they were all slaves; that she didn't believe it, and went\nto Washington city to see the president about it. They quarrelled; she drew\nher sword upon him, and swore that he should help her to make them all\nfree.\n\nThat poor, ignorant woman thought that America was governed by a Queen, to\nwhom the President was subordinate. I wish the President was subordinate to\nQueen Justice.\n\n\n\nIX. Sketches Of Neighboring Slaveholders.\n\n\nThere was a planter in the country, not far from us, whom I will call Mr.\nLitch. He was an ill-bred, uneducated man, but very wealthy. He had six\nhundred slaves, many of whom he did not know by sight. His extensive\nplantation was managed by well-paid overseers. There was a jail and a\nwhipping post on his grounds; and whatever cruelties were perpetrated\nthere, they passed without comment. He was so effectually screened by his\ngreat wealth that he was called to no account for his crimes, not even for\nmurder.\n\nVarious were the punishments resorted to. A favorite one was to tie a rope\nround a man's body, and suspend him from the ground. A fire was kindled\nover him, from which was suspended a piece of fat pork. As this cooked, the\nscalding drops of fat continually fell on the bare flesh. On his own\nplantation, he required very strict obedience to the eighth commandment.\nBut depredations on the neighbors were allowable, provided the culprit\nmanaged to evade detection or suspicion. If a neighbor brought a charge of\ntheft against any of his slaves, he was browbeaten by the master, who\nassured him that his slaves had enough of every thing at home, and had no\ninducement to steal. No sooner was the neighbor's back turned, than the\naccused was sought out, and whipped for his lack of discretion. If a slave\nstole from him even a pound of meat or a peck of corn, if detection\nfollowed, he was put in chains and imprisoned, and so kept till his form\nwas attentuated by hunger and suffering.\n\nA freshnet once bore his wine cellar and meat house miles away from the\nplantation. Some slaves followed, and secured bits of meat and bottles of\nwine. Two were detected; a ham and some liquor being found in their huts.\nThey were summoned by their master. No words were used, but a club felled\nthem to the ground. A rough box was their coffin, and their interment was a\ndog's burial. Nothing was said.\n\nMurder was so common on his plantation that he feared to be alone after\nnightfall. He might have believed in ghosts.\n\nHis brother, if not equal in wealth, was at least equal in cruelty. His\nbloodhounds were well trained. Their pen was spacious, and a terror to the\nslaves. They were let loose on a runway, and, if they tracked him, they\nliterally tore the flesh from his bones. When this slaveholder died, his\nshrieks and groans were so frightful that they appalled his own friends.\nHis last words were, \"I am going to hell; bury my money with me.\"\n\nAfter death his eyes remained open. To press the lids down, silver dollars\nwere laid on them. These were buried with him. From this circumstance, a\nrumor went abroad that his coffin was filled with money. Three times his\ngrave was opened, and his coffin taken out. The last time, his body was\nfound on the ground, and a flock of buzzards were pecking at it. He was\nagain interred, and a sentinel set over his grave. The perpetrators were\nnever discovered.\n\nCruelty is contagious in uncivilized communities. Mr. Conant, a neighbor of\nMr. Litch, returned from town one evening in a partial state of\nintoxication. His body servant gave him some offence. He was divested of\nhis clothes, except his shirt, whipped, and tied to a large tree in front\nof the house. It was a stormy night in winter. The wind blew bitterly cold,\nand the boughs of the old tree crackled under falling sleet. A member of\nthe family, fearing he would freeze to death, begged that he might be taken\ndown; but the master would not relent. He remained there three hours; and,\nwhen he was cut down, he was more dead than alive. Another slave, who stole\na pig from this master, to appease his hunger, was terribly flogged. In\ndesperation, he tried to run away. But at the end of two miles, he was so\nfaint with loss of blood, he thought he was dying. He had a wife, and he\nlonged to see her once more. Too sick to walk, he crept back that long\ndistance on his hands and knees. When he reached his master's, it was\nnight. He had not strength to rise and open the gate. He moaned, and tried\nto call for help. I had a friend living in the same family. At last his cry\nreached her. She went out and found the prostrate man at the gate. She ran\nback to the house for assistance, and two men returned with her. They\ncarried him in, and laid him on the floor. The back of his shirt was one\nclot of blood. By means of lard, my friend loosened it from the raw flesh.\nShe bandaged him, gave him cool drink, and left him to rest. The master\nsaid he deserved a hundred more lashes. When his own labor was stolen from\nhim, he had stolen food to appease his hunger. This was his crime.\n\nAnother neighbor was a Mrs. Wade. At no hour of the day was there cessation\nof the lash on her premises. Her labors began with the dawn, and did not\ncease till long after nightfall. The barn was her particular place of\ntorture. There she lashed the slaves with the might of a man. An old slave\nof hers once said to me, \"It is hell in missis's house. 'Pears I can never\nget out. Day and night I prays to die.\"\n\nThe mistress died before the old woman, and, when dying, entreated her\nhusband not to permit any one of her slaves to look on her after death. A\nslave who had nursed her children, and had still a child in her care,\nwatched her chance, and stole with it in her arms to the room where lay her\ndead mistress. She gazed a while on her, then raised her hand and dealt two\nblows on her face, saying, as she did so, \"The devil is got you _now_!\" She\nforgot that the child was looking on. She had just begun to talk; and she\nsaid to her father, \"I did see ma, and mammy did strike ma, so,\" striking\nher own face with her little hand. The master was startled. He could not\nimagine how the nurse could obtain access to the room where the corpse lay;\nfor he kept the door locked. He questioned her. She confessed that what the\nchild had said was true, and told how she had procured the key. She was\nsold to Georgia.\n\nIn my childhood I knew a valuable slave, named Charity, and loved her, as\nall children did. Her young mistress married, and took her to Louisiana.\nHer little boy, James, was sold to a good sort of master. He became\ninvolved in debt, and James was sold again to a wealthy slaveholder, noted\nfor his cruelty. With this man he grew up to manhood, receiving the\ntreatment of a dog. After a severe whipping, to save himself from further\ninfliction of the lash, with which he was threatened, he took to the woods.\nHe was in a most miserable condition--cut by the cowskin, half naked, half\nstarved, and without the means of procuring a crust of bread.\n\nSome weeks after his escape, he was captured, tied, and carried back to his\nmaster's plantation. This man considered punishment in his jail, on bread\nand water, after receiving hundreds of lashes, too mild for the poor\nslave's offence. Therefore he decided, after the overseer should have\nwhipped him to his satisfaction, to have him placed between the screws of\nthe cotton gin, to stay as long as he had been in the woods. This wretched\ncreature was cut with the whip from his head to his feet, then washed with\nstrong brine, to prevent the flesh from mortifying, and make it heal sooner\nthan it otherwise would. He was then put into the cotton gin, which was\nscrewed down, only allowing him room to turn on his side when he could not\nlie on his back. Every morning a slave was sent with a piece of bread and\nbowl of water, which was placed within reach of the poor fellow. The slave\nwas charged, under penalty of severe punishment, not to speak to him.\n\nFour days passed, and the slave continued to carry the bread and water. On\nthe second morning, he found the bread gone, but the water untouched. When\nhe had been in the press four days and five night, the slave informed his\nmaster that the water had not been used for four mornings, and that\nhorrible stench came from the gin house. The overseer was sent to examine\ninto it. When the press was unscrewed, the dead body was found partly eaten\nby rats and vermin. Perhaps the rats that devoured his bread had gnawed him\nbefore life was extinct. Poor Charity! Grandmother and I often asked each\nother how her affectionate heart would bear the news, if she should ever\nhear of the murder of her son. We had known her husband, and knew that\nJames was like him in manliness and intelligence. These were the qualities\nthat made it so hard for him to be a plantation slave. They put him into a\nrough box, and buried him with less feeling than would have been manifested\nfor an old house dog. Nobody asked any questions. He was a slave; and the\nfeeling was that the master had a right to do what he pleased with his own\nproperty. And what did _he_ care for the value of a slave? He had hundreds\nof them. When they had finished their daily toil, they must hurry to eat\ntheir little morsels, and be ready to extinguish their pine knots before\nnine o'clock, when the overseer went his patrol rounds. He entered every\ncabin, to see that men and their wives had gone to bed together, lest the\nmen, from over-fatigue, should fall asleep in the chimney corner, and\nremain there till the morning horn called them to their daily task. Women\nare considered of no value, unless they continually increase their owner's\nstock. They are put on a par with animals. This same master shot a woman\nthrough the head, who had run away and been brought back to him. No one\ncalled him to account for it. If a slave resisted being whipped, the\nbloodhounds were unpacked, and set upon him, to tear his flesh from his\nbones. The master who did these things was highly educated, and styled a\nperfect gentleman. He also boasted the name and standing of a Christian,\nthough Satan never had a truer follower.\n\nI could tell of more slaveholders as cruel as those I have described. They\nare not exceptions to the general rule. I do not say there are no humane\nslaveholders. Such characters do exist, notwithstanding the hardening\ninfluences around them. But they are \"like angels' visits--few and far\nbetween.\"\n\nI knew a young lady who was one of these rare specimens. She was an orphan,\nand inherited as slaves a woman and her six children. Their father was a\nfree man. They had a comfortable home of their own, parents and children\nliving together. The mother and eldest daughter served their mistress\nduring the day, and at night returned to their dwelling, which was on the\npremises. The young lady was very pious, and there was some reality in her\nreligion. She taught her slaves to lead pure lives, and wished them to\nenjoy the fruit of their own industry. _Her_ religion was not a garb put on\nfor Sunday, and laid aside till Sunday returned again. The eldest daughter\nof the slave mother was promised in marriage to a free man; and the day\nbefore the wedding this good mistress emancipated her, in order that her\nmarriage might have the sanction of _law_.\n\nReport said that this young lady cherished an unrequited affection for a\nman who had resolved to marry for wealth. In the course of time a rich\nuncle of hers died. He left six thousand dollars to his two sons by a\ncolored woman, and the remainder of his property to this orphan niece. The\nmetal soon attracted the magnet. The lady and her weighty purse became his.\nShe offered to manumit her slaves--telling them that her marriage might\nmake unexpected changes in their destiny, and she wished to insure their\nhappiness. They refused to take their freedom, saying that she had always\nbeen their best friend, and they could not be so happy any where as with\nher. I was not surprised. I had often seen them in their comfortable home,\nand thought that the whole town did not contain a happier family. They had\nnever felt slavery; and, when it was too late, they were convinced of its\nreality.\n\nWhen the new master claimed this family as his property, the father became\nfurious, and went to his mistress for protection. \"I can do nothing for you\nnow, Harry,\" said she. \"I no longer have the power I had a week ago. I have\nsucceeded in obtaining the freedom of your wife; but I cannot obtain it for\nyour children.\" The unhappy father swore that nobody should take his\nchildren from him. He concealed them in the woods for some days; but they\nwere discovered and taken. The father was put in jail, and the two oldest\nboys sold to Georgia. One little girl, too young to be of service to her\nmaster, was left with the wretched mother. The other three were carried to\ntheir master's plantation. The eldest soon became a mother; and when the\nslaveholder's wife looked at the babe, she wept bitterly. She knew that her\nown husband had violated the purity she had so carefully inculcated. She\nhad a second child by her master, and then he sold her and his offspring to\nhis brother. She bore two children to the brother and was sold again. The\nnext sister went crazy. The life she was compelled to lead drove her mad.\nThe third one became the mother of five daughters. Before the birth of the\nfourth the pious mistress died. To the last, she rendered every kindness to\nthe slaves that her unfortunate circumstances permitted. She passed away\npeacefully, glad to close her eyes on a life which had been made so\nwretched by the man she loved.\n\nThis man squandered the fortune he had received, and sought to retrieve his\naffairs by a second marriage; but, having retired after a night of drunken\ndebauch, he was found dead in the morning. He was called a good master; for\nhe fed and clothed his slaves better than most masters, and the lash was\nnot heard on his plantation so frequently as on many others. Had it not\nbeen for slavery, he would have been a better man, and his wife a happier\nwoman.\n\nNo pen can give an adequate description of the all-pervading corruption\nproduced by slavery. The slave girl is reared in an atmosphere of\nlicentiousness and fear. The lash and the foul talk of her master and his\nsons are her teachers. When she is fourteen or fifteen, her owner, or his\nsons, or the overseer, or perhaps all of them, begin to bribe her with\npresents. If these fail to accomplish their purpose, she is whipped or\nstarved into submission to their will. She may have had religious\nprinciples inculcated by some pious mother or grandmother, or some good\nmistress; she may have a lover, whose good opinion and peace of mind are\ndear to her heart; or the profligate men who have power over her may be\nexceedingly odious to her. But resistance is hopeless.\n\n   The poor worm\n   Shall prove her contest vain. Life's little day\n   Shall pass, and she is gone!\n\nThe slaveholder's sons are, of course, vitiated, even while boys, by the\nunclean influences every where around them. Nor do the master's daughters\nalways escape. Severe retributions sometimes come upon him for the wrongs\nhe does to the daughters of the slaves. The white daughters early hear\ntheir parents quarrelling about some female slave. Their curiosity is\nexcited, and they soon learn the cause. They are attended by the young\nslave girls whom their father has corrupted; and they hear such talk as\nshould never meet youthful ears, or any other ears. They know that the\nwoman slaves are subject to their father's authority in all things; and in\nsome cases they exercise the same authority over the men slaves. I have\nmyself seen the master of such a household whose head was bowed down in\nshame; for it was known in the neighborhood that his daughter had selected\none of the meanest slaves on his plantation to be the father of his first\ngrandchild. She did not make her advances to her equals, nor even to her\nfather's more intelligent servants. She selected the most brutalized, over\nwhom her authority could be exercised with less fear of exposure. Her\nfather, half frantic with rage, sought to revenge himself on the offending\nblack man; but his daughter, foreseeing the storm that would arise, had\ngiven him free papers, and sent him out of the state.\n\nIn such cases the infant is smothered, or sent where it is never seen by\nany who know its history. But if the white parent is the _father_, instead\nof the mother, the offspring are unblushingly reared for the market. If\nthey are girls, I have indicated plainly enough what will be their\ninevitable destiny.\n\nYou may believe what I say; for I write only that whereof I know. I was\ntwenty-one years in that cage of obscene birds. I can testify, from my own\nexperience and observation, that slavery is a curse to the whites as well\nas to the blacks. It makes white fathers cruel and sensual; the sons\nviolent and licentious; it contaminates the daughters, and makes the wives\nwretched. And as for the colored race, it needs an abler pen than mine to\ndescribe the extremity of their sufferings, the depth of their degradation.\n\nYet few slaveholders seem to be aware of the widespread moral ruin\noccasioned by this wicked system. Their talk is of blighted cotton\ncrops--not of the blight on their children's souls.\n\nIf you want to be fully convinced of the abominations of slavery, go on a\nsouthern plantation, and call yourself a negro trader. Then there will be\nno concealment; and you will see and hear things that will seem to you\nimpossible among human beings with immortal souls.\n\n\n\nX. A Perilous Passage In The Slave Girl's Life.\n\n\nAfter my lover went away, Dr. Flint contrived a new plan. He seemed to have\nan idea that my fear of my mistress was his greatest obstacle. In the\nblandest tones, he told me that he was going to build a small house for me,\nin a secluded place, four miles away from the town. I shuddered; but I was\nconstrained to listen, while he talked of his intention to give me a home\nof my own, and to make a lady of me. Hitherto, I had escaped my dreaded\nfate, by being in the midst of people. My grandmother had already had high\nwords with my master about me. She had told him pretty plainly what she\nthought of his character, and there was considerable gossip in the\nneighborhood about our affairs, to which the open-mouthed jealousy of Mrs.\nFlint contributed not a little. When my master said he was going to build a\nhouse for me, and that he could do it with little trouble and expense, I\nwas in hopes something would happen to frustrate his scheme; but I soon\nheard that the house was actually begun. I vowed before my Maker that I\nwould never enter it: I had rather toil on the plantation from dawn till\ndark; I had rather live and die in jail, than drag on, from day to day,\nthrough such a living death. I was determined that the master, whom I so\nhated and loathed, who had blighted the prospects of my youth, and made my\nlife a desert, should not, after my long struggle with him, succeed at last\nin trampling his victim under his feet. I would do any thing, every thing,\nfor the sake of defeating him. What _could_ I do? I thought and thought,\ntill I became desperate, and made a plunge into the abyss.\n\nAnd now, reader, I come to a period in my unhappy life, which I would\ngladly forget if I could. The remembrance fills me with sorrow and shame.\nIt pains me to tell you of it; but I have promised to tell you the truth,\nand I will do it honestly, let it cost me what it may. I will not try to\nscreen myself behind the plea of compulsion from a master; for it was not\nso. Neither can I plead ignorance or thoughtlessness. For years, my master\nhad done his utmost to pollute my mind with foul images, and to destroy the\npure principles inculcated by my grandmother, and the good mistress of my\nchildhood. The influences of slavery had had the same effect on me that\nthey had on other young girls; they had made me prematurely knowing,\nconcerning the evil ways of the world. I knew what I did, and I did it with\ndeliberate calculation.\n\nBut, O, ye happy women, whose purity has been sheltered from childhood, who\nhave been free to choose the objects of your affection, whose homes are\nprotected by law, do not judge the poor desolate slave girl too severely!\nIf slavery had been abolished, I, also, could have married the man of my\nchoice; I could have had a home shielded by the laws; and I should have\nbeen spared the painful task of confessing what I am now about to relate;\nbut all my prospects had been blighted by slavery. I wanted to keep myself\npure; and, under the most adverse circumstances, I tried hard to preserve\nmy self-respect; but I was struggling alone in the powerful grasp of the\ndemon Slavery; and the monster proved too strong for me. I felt as if I was\nforsaken by God and man; as if all my efforts must be frustrated; and I\nbecame reckless in my despair.\n\nI have told you that Dr. Flint's persecutions and his wife's jealousy had\ngiven rise to some gossip in the neighborhood. Among others, it chanced\nthat a white unmarried gentleman had obtained some knowledge of the\ncircumstances in which I was placed. He knew my grandmother, and often\nspoke to me in the street. He became interested for me, and asked questions\nabout my master, which I answered in part. He expressed a great deal of\nsympathy, and a wish to aid me. He constantly sought opportunities to see\nme, and wrote to me frequently. I was a poor slave girl, only fifteen years\nold.\n\nSo much attention from a superior person was, of course, flattering; for\nhuman nature is the same in all. I also felt grateful for his sympathy, and\nencouraged by his kind words. It seemed to me a great thing to have such a\nfriend. By degrees, a more tender feeling crept into my heart. He was an\neducated and eloquent gentleman; too eloquent, alas, for the poor slave\ngirl who trusted in him. Of course I saw whither all this was tending. I\nknew the impassable gulf between us; but to be an object of interest to a\nman who is not married, and who is not her master, is agreeable to the\npride and feelings of a slave, if her miserable situation has left her any\npride or sentiment. It seems less degrading to give one's self, than to\nsubmit to compulsion. There is something akin to freedom in having a lover\nwho has no control over you, except that which he gains by kindness and\nattachment. A master may treat you as rudely as he pleases, and you dare\nnot speak; moreover, the wrong does not seem so great with an unmarried\nman, as with one who has a wife to be made unhappy. There may be sophistry\nin all this; but the condition of a slave confuses all principles of\nmorality, and, in fact, renders the practice of them impossible.\n\nWhen I found that my master had actually begun to build the lonely cottage,\nother feelings mixed with those I have described. Revenge, and calculations\nof interest, were added to flattered vanity and sincere gratitude for\nkindness. I knew nothing would enrage Dr. Flint so much as to know that I\nfavored another, and it was something to triumph over my tyrant even in\nthat small way. I thought he would revenge himself by selling me, and I was\nsure my friend, Mr. Sands, would buy me. He was a man of more generosity\nand feeling than my master, and I thought my freedom could be easily\nobtained from him. The crisis of my fate now came so near that I was\ndesperate. I shuddered to think of being the mother of children that should\nbe owned by my old tyrant. I knew that as soon as a new fancy took him, his\nvictims were sold far off to get rid of them; especially if they had\nchildren. I had seen several women sold, with babies at the breast. He\nnever allowed his offspring by slaves to remain long in sight of himself\nand his wife. Of a man who was not my master I could ask to have my\nchildren well supported; and in this case, I felt confident I should obtain\nthe boon. I also felt quite sure that they would be made free. With all\nthese thoughts revolving in my mind, and seeing no other way of escaping\nthe doom I so much dreaded, I made a headlong plunge. Pity me, and pardon\nme, O virtuous reader! You never knew what it is to be a slave; to be\nentirely unprotected by law or custom; to have the laws reduce you to the\ncondition of a chattel, entirely subject to the will of another. You never\nexhausted your ingenuity in avoiding the snares, and eluding the power of a\nhated tyrant; you never shuddered at the sound of his footsteps, and\ntrembled within hearing of his voice. I know I did wrong. No one can feel\nit more sensibly than I do. The painful and humiliating memory will haunt\nme to my dying day. Still, in looking back, calmly, on the events of my\nlife, I feel that the slave woman ought not to be judged by the same\nstandard as others.\n\nThe months passed on. I had many unhappy hours. I secretly mourned over the\nsorrow I was bringing on my grandmother, who had so tried to shield me from\nharm. I knew that I was the greatest comfort of her old age, and that it\nwas a source of pride to her that I had not degraded myself, like most of\nthe slaves. I wanted to confess to her that I was no longer worthy of her\nlove; but I could not utter the dreaded words.\n\nAs for Dr. Flint, I had a feeling of satisfaction and triumph in the\nthought of telling _him_. From time to time he told me of his intended\narrangements, and I was silent. At last, he came and told me the cottage\nwas completed, and ordered me to go to it. I told him I would never enter\nit. He said, \"I have heard enough of such talk as that. You shall go, if\nyou are carried by force; and you shall remain there.\"\n\nI replied, \"I will never go there. In a few months I shall be a mother.\"\n\nHe stood and looked at me in dumb amazement, and left the house without a\nword. I thought I should be happy in my triumph over him. But now that the\ntruth was out, and my relatives would hear of it, I felt wretched. Humble\nas were their circumstances, they had pride in my good character. Now, how\ncould I look at them in the face? My self-respect was gone! I had resolved\nthat I would be virtuous, though I was a slave. I had said, \"Let the storm\nbeat! I will brave it till I die.\" And now, how humiliated I felt!\n\nI went to my grandmother. My lips moved to make confession, but the words\nstuck in my throat. I sat down in the shade of a tree at her door and began\nto sew. I think she saw something unusual was the matter with me. The\nmother of slaves is very watchful. She knows there is no security for her\nchildren. After they have entered their teens she lives in daily\nexpectation of trouble. This leads to many questions. If the girl is of a\nsensitive nature, timidity keeps her from answering truthfully, and this\nwell-meant course has a tendency to drive her from maternal counsels.\nPresently, in came my mistress, like a mad woman, and accused me concerning\nher husband. My grandmother, whose suspicions had been previously awakened,\nbelieved what she said. She exclaimed, \"O Linda! Has it come to this? I had\nrather see you dead than to see you as you now are. You are a disgrace to\nyour dead mother.\" She tore from my fingers my mother's wedding ring and\nher silver thimble. \"Go away!\" she exclaimed, \"and never come to my house,\nagain.\" Her reproaches fell so hot and heavy, that they left me no chance\nto answer. Bitter tears, such as the eyes never shed but once, were my only\nanswer. I rose from my seat, but fell back again, sobbing. She did not\nspeak to me; but the tears were running down her furrowed cheeks, and they\nscorched me like fire. She had always been so kind to me! _So_ kind! How I\nlonged to throw myself at her feet, and tell her all the truth! But she had\nordered me to go, and never to come there again. After a few minutes, I\nmustered strength, and started to obey her. With what feelings did I now\nclose that little gate, which I used to open with such an eager hand in my\nchildhood! It closed upon me with a sound I never heard before.\n\nWhere could I go? I was afraid to return to my master's. I walked on\nrecklessly, not caring where I went, or what would become of me. When I had\ngone four or five miles, fatigue compelled me to stop. I sat down on the\nstump of an old tree. The stars were shining through the boughs above me.\nHow they mocked me, with their bright, calm light! The hours passed by, and\nas I sat there alone a chilliness and deadly sickness came over me. I sank\non the ground. My mind was full of horrid thoughts. I prayed to die; but\nthe prayer was not answered. At last, with great effort I roused myself,\nand walked some distance further, to the house of a woman who had been a\nfriend of my mother. When I told her why I was there, she spoke soothingly\nto me; but I could not be comforted. I thought I could bear my shame if I\ncould only be reconciled to my grandmother. I longed to open my heart to\nher. I thought if she could know the real state of the case, and all I had\nbeen bearing for years, she would perhaps judge me less harshly. My friend\nadvised me to send for her. I did so; but days of agonizing suspense passed\nbefore she came. Had she utterly forsaken me? No. She came at last. I knelt\nbefore her, and told her the things that had poisoned my life; how long I\nhad been persecuted; that I saw no way of escape; and in an hour of\nextremity I had become desperate. She listened in silence. I told her I\nwould bear any thing and do any thing, if in time I had hopes of obtaining\nher forgiveness. I begged of her to pity me, for my dead mother's sake. And\nshe did pity me. She did not say, \"I forgive you;\" but she looked at me\nlovingly, with her eyes full of tears. She laid her old hand gently on my\nhead, and murmured, \"Poor child! Poor child!\"\n\n\n\nXI. The New Tie To Life.\n\n\nI returned to my good grandmother's house. She had an interview with Mr.\nSands. When she asked him why he could not have left her one ewe\nlamb,--whether there were not plenty of slaves who did not care about\ncharacter,--he made no answer, but he spoke kind and encouraging words. He\npromised to care for my child, and to buy me, be the conditions what they\nmight.\n\nI had not seen Dr. Flint for five days. I had never seen him since I made\nthe avowal to him. He talked of the disgrace I had brought on myself; how I\nhad sinned against my master, and mortified my old grandmother. He\nintimated that if I had accepted his proposals, he, as a physician, could\nhave saved me from exposure. He even condescended to pity me. Could he have\noffered wormwood more bitter? He, whose persecutions had been the cause of\nmy sin!\n\n\"Linda,\" said he, \"though you have been criminal towards me, I feel for\nyou, and I can pardon you if you obey my wishes. Tell me whether the fellow\nyou wanted to marry is the father of your child. If you deceive me, you\nshall feel the fires of hell.\"\n\nI did not feel as proud as I had done. My strongest weapon with him was\ngone. I was lowered in my own estimation, and had resolved to bear his\nabuse in silence. But when he spoke contemptuously of the lover who had\nalways treated me honorably; when I remembered that but for _him_ I might\nhave been a virtuous, free, and happy wife, I lost my patience. \"I have\nsinned against God and myself,\" I replied; \"but not against you.\"\n\nHe clinched his teeth, and muttered, \"Curse you!\" He came towards me, with\nill-suppressed rage, and exclaimed, \"You obstinate girl! I could grind your\nbones to powder! You have thrown yourself away on some worthless rascal.\nYou are weak-minded, and have been easily persuaded by those who don't care\na straw for you. The future will settle accounts between us. You are\nblinded now; but hereafter you will be convinced that your master was your\nbest friend. My lenity towards you is a proof of it. I might have punished\nyou in many ways. I might have whipped till you fell dead under the lash.\nBut I wanted you to live; I would have bettered your condition. Others\ncannot do it. You are my slave. Your mistress, disgusted by your conduct,\nforbids you to return to the house; therefore I leave you here for the\npresent; but I shall see you often. I will call to-morrow.\"\n\nHe came with frowning brows, that showed a dissatisfied state of mind.\nAfter asking about my health, he inquired whether my board was paid, and\nwho visited me. He then went on to say that he had neglected his duty; that\nas a physician there were certain things that he ought to have explained to\nme. Then followed talk such as would have made the most shameless blush. He\nordered me to stand up before him. I obeyed. \"I command you,\" said he, \"to\ntell me whether the father of your child is white or black.\" I hesitated.\n\"Answer me this instant!\" he exclaimed. I did answer. He sprang upon me\nlike a wolf, and grabbed my arm as if he would have broken it. \"Do you love\nhim?\" said he, in a hissing tone.\n\n\"I am thankful that I do not despise him,\" I replied.\n\nHe raised his hand to strike me; but it fell again. I don't know what\narrested the blow. He sat down, with lips tightly compressed. At last he\nspoke. \"I came here,\" said he, \"to make you a friendly proposition; but\nyour ingratitude chafes me beyond endurance. You turn aside all my good\nintentions towards you. I don't know what it is that keeps me from killing\nyou.\" Again he rose, as if he had a mind to strike me.\n\nBut he resumed. \"On one condition I will forgive your insolence and crime.\nYou must henceforth have no communication of any kind with the father of\nyour child. You must not ask any thing from him, or receive any thing from\nhim. I will take care of you and your child. You had better promise this at\nonce, and not wait till you are deserted by him. This is the last act of\nmercy I shall show towards you.\"\n\nI said something about being unwilling to have my child supported by a man\nwho had cursed it and me also. He rejoined, that a woman who had sunk to my\nlevel had no right to expect any thing else. He asked, for the last time,\nwould I accept his kindness? I answered that I would not.\n\n\"Very well,\" said he; \"then take the consequences of your wayward course.\nNever look to me for help. You are my slave, and shall always be my slave.\nI will never sell you, that you may depend upon.\"\n\nHope died away in my heart as he closed the door after him. I had\ncalculated that in his rage he would sell me to a slave-trader; and I knew\nthe father of my child was on the watch to buy me.\n\nAbout this time my uncle Phillip was expected to return from a voyage. The\nday before his departure I had officiated as bridesmaid to a young friend.\nMy heart was then ill at ease, but my smiling countenance did not betray\nit. Only a year had passed; but what fearful changes it had wrought! My\nheart had grown gray in misery. Lives that flash in sunshine, and lives\nthat are born in tears, receive their hue from circumstances. None of us\nknow what a year may bring forth.\n\nI felt no joy when they told me my uncle had come. He wanted to see me,\nthough he knew what had happened. I shrank from him at first; but at last\nconsented that he should come to my room. He received me as he always had\ndone. O, how my heart smote me when I felt his tears on my burning cheeks!\nThe words of my grandmother came to my mind,--\"Perhaps your mother and\nfather are taken from the evil days to come.\" My disappointed heart could\nnow praise God that it was so. But why, thought I, did my relatives ever\ncherish hopes for me? What was there to save me from the usual fate of\nslave girls? Many more beautiful and more intelligent than I had\nexperienced a similar fate, or a far worse one. How could they hope that I\nshould escape?\n\nMy uncle's stay was short, and I was not sorry for it. I was too ill in\nmind and body to enjoy my friends as I had done. For some weeks I was\nunable to leave my bed. I could not have any doctor but my master, and I\nwould not have him sent for. At last, alarmed by my increasing illness,\nthey sent for him. I was very weak and nervous; and as soon as he entered\nthe room, I began to scream. They told him my state was very critical. He\nhad no wish to hasten me out of the world, and he withdrew.\n\nWhen my babe was born, they said it was premature. It weighed only four\npounds; but God let it live. I heard the doctor say I could not survive\ntill morning. I had often prayed for death; but now I did not want to die,\nunless my child could die too. Many weeks passed before I was able to leave\nmy bed. I was a mere wreck of my former self. For a year there was scarcely\na day when I was free from chills and fever. My babe also was sickly. His\nlittle limbs were often racked with pain. Dr. Flint continued his visits,\nto look after my health; and he did not fail to remind me that my child was\nan addition to his stock of slaves.\n\nI felt too feeble to dispute with him, and listened to his remarks in\nsilence. His visits were less frequent; but his busy spirit could not\nremain quiet. He employed my brother in his office; and he was made the\nmedium of frequent notes and messages to me. William was a bright lad, and\nof much use to the doctor. He had learned to put up medicines, to leech,\ncup, and bleed. He had taught himself to read and spell. I was proud of my\nbrother, and the old doctor suspected as much. One day, when I had not seen\nhim for several weeks, I heard his steps approaching the door. I dreaded\nthe encounter, and hid myself. He inquired for me, of course; but I was\nnowhere to be found. He went to his office, and despatched William with a\nnote. The color mounted to my brother's face when he gave it to me; and he\nsaid, \"Don't you hate me, Linda, for bringing you these things?\" I told him\nI could not blame him; he was a slave, and obliged to obey his master's\nwill. The note ordered me to come to his office. I went. He demanded to\nknow where I was when he called. I told him I was at home. He flew into a\npassion, and said he knew better. Then he launched out upon his usual\nthemes,--my crimes against him, and my ingratitude for his forbearance. The\nlaws were laid down to me anew, and I was dismissed. I felt humiliated that\nmy brother should stand by, and listen to such language as would be\naddressed only to a slave. Poor boy! He was powerless to defend me; but I\nsaw the tears, which he vainly strove to keep back. The manifestation of\nfeeling irritated the doctor. William could do nothing to please him. One\nmorning he did not arrive at the office so early as usual; and that\ncircumstance afforded his master an opportunity to vent his spleen. He was\nput in jail. The next day my brother sent a trader to the doctor, with a\nrequest to be sold. His master was greatly incensed at what he called his\ninsolence. He said he had put him there, to reflect upon his bad conduct,\nand he certainly was not giving any evidence of repentance. For two days he\nharassed himself to find somebody to do his office work; but every thing\nwent wrong without William. He was released, and ordered to take his old\nstand, with many threats, if he was not careful about his future behavior.\n\nAs the months passed on, my boy improved in health. When he was a year old,\nthey called him beautiful. The little vine was taking deep root in my\nexistence, though its clinging fondness excited a mixture of love and pain.\nWhen I was most sorely oppressed I found a solace in his smiles. I loved to\nwatch his infant slumbers; but always there was a dark cloud over my\nenjoyment. I could never forget that he was a slave. Sometimes I wished\nthat he might die in infancy. God tried me. My darling became very ill. The\nbright eyes grew dull, and the little feet and hands were so icy cold that\nI thought death had already touched them. I had prayed for his death, but\nnever so earnestly as I now prayed for his life; and my prayer was heard.\nAlas, what mockery it is for a slave mother to try to pray back her dying\nchild to life! Death is better than slavery. It was a sad thought that I\nhad no name to give my child. His father caressed him and treated him\nkindly, whenever he had a chance to see him. He was not unwilling that he\nshould bear his name; but he had no legal claim to it; and if I had\nbestowed it upon him, my master would have regarded it as a new crime, a\nnew piece of insolence, and would, perhaps, revenge it on the boy. O, the\nserpent of Slavery has many and poisonous fangs!\n\n\n\nXII. Fear Of Insurrection.\n\n\nNot far from this time Nat Turner's insurrection broke out; and the news\nthrew our town into great commotion. Strange that they should be alarmed,\nwhen their slaves were so \"contented and happy\"! But so it was.\n\nIt was always the custom to have a muster every year. On that occasion\nevery white man shouldered his musket. The citizens and the so-called\ncountry gentlemen wore military uniforms. The poor whites took their places\nin the ranks in every-day dress, some without shoes, some without hats.\nThis grand occasion had already passed; and when the slaves were told there\nwas to be another muster, they were surprised and rejoiced. Poor creatures!\nThey thought it was going to be a holiday. I was informed of the true state\nof affairs, and imparted it to the few I could trust. Most gladly would I\nhave proclaimed it to every slave; but I dared not. All could not be relied\non. Mighty is the power of the torturing lash.\n\nBy sunrise, people were pouring in from every quarter within twenty miles\nof the town. I knew the houses were to be searched; and I expected it would\nbe done by country bullies and the poor whites. I knew nothing annoyed them\nso much as to see colored people living in comfort and respectability; so I\nmade arrangements for them with especial care. I arranged every thing in my\ngrandmother's house as neatly as possible. I put white quilts on the beds,\nand decorated some of the rooms with flowers. When all was arranged, I sat\ndown at the window to watch. Far as my eye could reach, it rested on a\nmotley crowd of soldiers. Drums and fifes were discoursing martial music.\nThe men were divided into companies of sixteen, each headed by a captain.\nOrders were given, and the wild scouts rushed in every direction, wherever\na colored face was to be found.\n\nIt was a grand opportunity for the low whites, who had no negroes of their\nown to scourge. They exulted in such a chance to exercise a little brief\nauthority, and show their subserviency to the slaveholders; not reflecting\nthat the power which trampled on the colored people also kept themselves in\npoverty, ignorance, and moral degradation. Those who never witnessed such\nscenes can hardly believe what I know was inflicted at this time on\ninnocent men, women, and children, against whom there was not the slightest\nground for suspicion. Colored people and slaves who lived in remote parts\nof the town suffered in an especial manner. In some cases the searchers\nscattered powder and shot among their clothes, and then sent other parties\nto find them, and bring them forward as proof that they were plotting\ninsurrection. Every where men, women, and children were whipped till the\nblood stood in puddles at their feet. Some received five hundred lashes;\nothers were tied hands and feet, and tortured with a bucking paddle, which\nblisters the skin terribly. The dwellings of the colored people, unless\nthey happened to be protected by some influential white person, who was\nnigh at hand, were robbed of clothing and every thing else the marauders\nthought worth carrying away. All day long these unfeeling wretches went\nround, like a troop of demons, terrifying and tormenting the helpless. At\nnight, they formed themselves into patrol bands, and went wherever they\nchose among the colored people, acting out their brutal will. Many women\nhid themselves in woods and swamps, to keep out of their way. If any of the\nhusbands or fathers told of these outrages, they were tied up to the public\nwhipping post, and cruelly scourged for telling lies about white men. The\nconsternation was universal. No two people that had the slightest tinge of\ncolor in their faces dared to be seen talking together.\n\nI entertained no positive fears about our household, because we were in the\nmidst of white families who would protect us. We were ready to receive the\nsoldiers whenever they came. It was not long before we heard the tramp of\nfeet and the sound of voices. The door was rudely pushed open; and in they\ntumbled, like a pack of hungry wolves. They snatched at every thing within\ntheir reach. Every box, trunk, closet, and corner underwent a thorough\nexamination. A box in one of the drawers containing some silver change was\neagerly pounced upon. When I stepped forward to take it from them, one of\nthe soldiers turned and said angrily, \"What d'ye foller us fur? D'ye s'pose\nwhite folks is come to steal?\"\n\nI replied, \"You have come to search; but you have searched that box, and I\nwill take it, if you please.\"\n\nAt that moment I saw a white gentleman who was friendly to us; and I called\nto him, and asked him to have the goodness to come in and stay till the\nsearch was over. He readily complied. His entrance into the house brought\nin the captain of the company, whose business it was to guard the outside\nof the house, and see that none of the inmates left it. This officer was\nMr. Litch, the wealthy slaveholder whom I mentioned, in the account of\nneighboring planters, as being notorious for his cruelty. He felt above\nsoiling his hands with the search. He merely gave orders; and, if a bit of\nwriting was discovered, it was carried to him by his ignorant followers,\nwho were unable to read.\n\nMy grandmother had a large trunk of bedding and table cloths. When that was\nopened, there was a great shout of surprise; and one exclaimed, \"Where'd\nthe damned niggers git all dis sheet an' table clarf?\"\n\nMy grandmother, emboldened by the presence of our white protector said,\n\"You may be sure we didn't pilfer 'em from _your_ houses.\"\n\n\"Look here, mammy,\" said a grim-looking fellow without any coat, \"you seem\nto feel mighty gran' 'cause you got all them 'ere fixens. White folks\noughter have 'em all.\"\n\nHis remarks were interrupted by a chorus of voices shouting, \"We's got 'em!\nWe's got 'em! Dis 'ere yaller gal's got letters!\"\n\nThere was a general rush for the supposed letter, which, upon examination,\nproved to be some verses written to me by a friend. In packing away my\nthings, I had overlooked them. When their captain informed them of their\ncontents, they seemed much disappointed. He inquired of me who wrote them.\nI told him it was one of my friends. \"Can you read them?\" he asked. When I\ntold him I could, he swore, and raved, and tore the paper into bits. \"Bring\nme all your letters!\" said he, in commanding tone. I told him I had none.\n\"Don't be afraid,\" he continued, in an insinuating way. \"Bring them all to\nme. Nobody shall do you any harm.\" Seeing I did not move to obey him, his\npleasant tone changed to oaths and threats. \"Who writes to you? half free\nniggers?\" inquired he. I replied, \"O, no; most of my letters are from white\npeople. Some request me to burn them after they are read, and some I\ndestroy without reading.\"\n\nAn exclamation of surprise from some of the company put a stop to our\nconversation. Some silver spoons which ornamented an old-fashioned buffet\nhad just been discovered. My grandmother was in the habit of preserving\nfruit for many ladies in the town, and of preparing suppers for parties;\nconsequently she had many jars of preserves. The closet that contained\nthese was next invaded, and the contents tasted. One of them, who was\nhelping himself freely, tapped his neighbor on the shoulder, and said, \"Wal\ndone! Don't wonder de niggers want to kill all de white folks, when dey\nlive on 'sarves\" [meaning preserves]. I stretched out my hand to take the\njar, saying, \"You were not sent here to search for sweetmeats.\"\n\n\"And what _were_ we sent for?\" said the captain, bristling up to me. I\nevaded the question.\n\nThe search of the house was completed, and nothing found to condemn us.\nThey next proceeded to the garden, and knocked about every bush and vine,\nwith no better success. The captain called his men together, and, after a\nshort consultation, the order to march was given. As they passed out of the\ngate, the captain turned back, and pronounced a malediction on the house.\nHe said it ought to be burned to the ground, and each of its inmates\nreceive thirty-nine lashes. We came out of this affair very fortunately;\nnot losing any thing except some wearing apparel.\n\nTowards evening the turbulence increased. The soldiers, stimulated by\ndrink, committed still greater cruelties. Shrieks and shouts continually\nrent the air. Not daring to go to the door, I peeped under the window\ncurtain. I saw a mob dragging along a number of colored people, each white\nman, with his musket upraised, threatening instant death if they did not\nstop their shrieks. Among the prisoners was a respectable old colored\nminister. They had found a few parcels of shot in his house, which his wife\nhad for years used to balance her scales. For this they were going to shoot\nhim on Court House Green. What a spectacle was that for a civilized\ncountry! A rabble, staggering under intoxication, assuming to be the\nadministrators of justice!\n\nThe better class of the community exerted their influence to save the\ninnocent, persecuted people; and in several instances they succeeded, by\nkeeping them shut up in jail till the excitement abated. At last the white\ncitizens found that their own property was not safe from the lawless rabble\nthey had summoned to protect them. They rallied the drunken swarm, drove\nthem back into the country, and set a guard over the town.\n\nThe next day, the town patrols were commissioned to search colored people\nthat lived out of the city; and the most shocking outrages were committed\nwith perfect impunity. Every day for a fortnight, if I looked out, I saw\nhorsemen with some poor panting negro tied to their saddles, and compelled\nby the lash to keep up with their speed, till they arrived at the jail\nyard. Those who had been whipped too unmercifully to walk were washed with\nbrine, tossed into a cart, and carried to jail. One black man, who had not\nfortitude to endure scourging, promised to give information about the\nconspiracy. But it turned out that he knew nothing at all. He had not even\nheard the name of Nat Turner. The poor fellow had, however, made up a\nstory, which augmented his own sufferings and those of the colored people.\n\nThe day patrol continued for some weeks, and at sundown a night guard was\nsubstituted. Nothing at all was proved against the colored people, bond or\nfree. The wrath of the slaveholders was somewhat appeased by the capture of\nNat Turner. The imprisoned were released. The slaves were sent to their\nmasters, and the free were permitted to return to their ravaged homes.\nVisiting was strictly forbidden on the plantations. The slaves begged the\nprivilege of again meeting at their little church in the woods, with their\nburying ground around it. It was built by the colored people, and they had\nno higher happiness than to meet there and sing hymns together, and pour\nout their hearts in spontaneous prayer. Their request was denied, and the\nchurch was demolished. They were permitted to attend the white churches, a\ncertain portion of the galleries being appropriated to their use. There,\nwhen every body else had partaken of the communion, and the benediction had\nbeen pronounced, the minister said, \"Come down, now, my colored friends.\"\nThey obeyed the summons, and partook of the bread and wine, in\ncommemoration of the meek and lowly Jesus, who said, \"God is your Father,\nand all ye are brethren.\"\n\n\n\nXIII. The Church And Slavery.\n\n\nAfter the alarm caused by Nat Turner's insurrection had subsided, the\nslaveholders came to the conclusion that it would be well to give the\nslaves enough of religious instruction to keep them from murdering their\nmasters. The Episcopal clergyman offered to hold a separate service on\nSundays for their benefit. His colored members were very few, and also very\nrespectable--a fact which I presume had some weight with him. The\ndifficulty was to decide on a suitable place for them to worship. The\nMethodist and Baptist churches admitted them in the afternoon; but their\ncarpets and cushions were not so costly as those at the Episcopal church.\nIt was at last decided that they should meet at the house of a free colored\nman, who was a member.\n\nI was invited to attend, because I could read. Sunday evening came, and,\ntrusting to the cover of night, I ventured out. I rarely ventured out by\ndaylight, for I always went with fear, expecting at every turn to encounter\nDr. Flint, who was sure to turn me back, or order me to his office to\ninquire where I got my bonnet, or some other article of dress. When the\nRev. Mr. Pike came, there were some twenty persons present. The reverend\ngentleman knelt in prayer, then seated himself, and requested all present,\nwho could read, to open their books, while he gave out the portions he\nwished them to repeat or respond to.\n\nHis text was, \"Servants, be obedient to them that are your masters\naccording to the flesh, with fear and trembling, in singleness of your\nheart, as unto Christ.\"\n\nPious Mr. Pike brushed up his hair till it stood upright, and, in deep,\nsolemn tones, began: \"Hearken, ye servants! Give strict heed unto my words.\nYou are rebellious sinners. Your hearts are filled with all manner of evil.\n'Tis the devil who tempts you. God is angry with you, and will surely\npunish you, if you don't forsake your wicked ways. You that live in town\nare eyeservants behind your master's back. Instead of serving your masters\nfaithfully, which is pleasing in the sight of your heavenly Master, you are\nidle, and shirk your work. God sees you. You tell lies. God hears you.\nInstead of being engaged in worshipping him, you are hidden away somewhere,\nfeasting on your master's substance; tossing coffee-grounds with some\nwicked fortuneteller, or cutting cards with another old hag. Your masters\nmay not find you out, but God sees you, and will punish you. O, the\ndepravity of your hearts! When your master's work is done, are you quietly\ntogether, thinking of the goodness of God to such sinful creatures? No; you\nare quarrelling, and tying up little bags of roots to bury under the\ndoorsteps to poison each other with. God sees you. You men steal away to\nevery grog shop to sell your master's corn, that you may buy rum to drink.\nGod sees you. You sneak into the back streets, or among the bushes, to\npitch coppers. Although your masters may not find you out, God sees you;\nand he will punish you. You must forsake your sinful ways, and be faithful\nservants. Obey your old master and your young master--your old mistress and\nyour young mistress. If you disobey your earthly master, you offend your\nheavenly Master. You must obey God's commandments. When you go from here,\ndon't stop at the corners of the streets to talk, but go directly home, and\nlet your master and mistress see that you have come.\"\n\nThe benediction was pronounced. We went home, highly amused at brother\nPike's gospel teaching, and we determined to hear him again. I went the\nnext Sabbath evening, and heard pretty much a repetition of the last\ndiscourse. At the close of the meeting, Mr. Pike informed us that he found\nit very inconvenient to meet at the friend's house, and he should be glad\nto see us, every Sunday evening, at his own kitchen.\n\nI went home with the feeling that I had heard the Reverend Mr. Pike for the\nlast time. Some of his members repaired to his house, and found that the\nkitchen sported two tallow candles; the first time, I am sure, since its\npresent occupant owned it, for the servants never had any thing but pine\nknots. It was so long before the reverend gentleman descended from his\ncomfortable parlor that the slaves left, and went to enjoy a Methodist\nshout. They never seem so happy as when shouting and singing at religious\nmeetings. Many of them are sincere, and nearer to the gate of heaven than\nsanctimonious Mr. Pike, and other long-faced Christians, who see wounded\nSamaritans, and pass by on the other side.\n\nThe slaves generally compose their own songs and hymns; and they do not\ntrouble their heads much about the measure. They often sing the following\nverses:\n\n   Old Satan is one busy ole man;\n   He rolls dem blocks all in my way;\n   But Jesus is my bosom friend;\n   He rolls dem blocks away.\n\n   If I had died when I was young,\n   Den how my stam'ring tongue would have sung;\n   But I am ole, and now I stand\n   A narrow chance for to tread dat heavenly land.\n\nI well remember one occasion when I attended a Methodist class meeting. I\nwent with a burdened spirit, and happened to sit next a poor, bereaved\nmother, whose heart was still heavier than mine. The class leader was the\ntown constable--a man who bought and sold slaves, who whipped his brethren\nand sisters of the church at the public whipping post, in jail or out of\njail. He was ready to perform that Christian office any where for fifty\ncents. This white-faced, black-hearted brother came near us, and said to\nthe stricken woman, \"Sister, can't you tell us how the Lord deals with your\nsoul? Do you love him as you did formerly?\"\n\nShe rose to her feet, and said, in piteous tones, \"My Lord and Master, help\nme! My load is more than I can bear. God has hid himself from me, and I am\nleft in darkness and misery.\" Then, striking her breast, she continued, \"I\ncan't tell you what is in here! They've got all my children. Last week they\ntook the last one. God only knows where they've sold her. They let me have\nher sixteen years, and then--O! O! Pray for her brothers and sisters! I've\ngot nothing to live for now. God make my time short!\"\n\nShe sat down, quivering in every limb. I saw that constable class leader\nbecome crimson in the face with suppressed laughter, while he held up his\nhandkerchief, that those who were weeping for the poor woman's calamity\nmight not see his merriment. Then, with assumed gravity, he said to the\nbereaved mother, \"Sister, pray to the Lord that every dispensation of his\ndivine will may be sanctified to the good of your poor needy soul!\"\n\nThe congregation struck up a hymn, and sung as though they were as free as\nthe birds that warbled round us,--\n\n   Ole Satan thought he had a mighty aim;\n   He missed my soul, and caught my sins.\n   Cry Amen, cry Amen, cry Amen to God!\n\n   He took my sins upon his back;\n   Went muttering and grumbling down to hell.\n   Cry Amen, cry Amen, cry Amen to God!\n\n   Ole Satan's church is here below.\n   Up to God's free church I hope to go.\n   Cry Amen, cry Amen, cry Amen to God!\n\nPrecious are such moments to the poor slaves. If you were to hear them at\nsuch times, you might think they were happy. But can that hour of singing\nand shouting sustain them through the dreary week, toiling without wages,\nunder constant dread of the lash?\n\nThe Episcopal clergyman, who, ever since my earliest recollection, had been\na sort of god among the slaveholders, concluded, as his family was large,\nthat he must go where money was more abundant. A very different clergyman\ntook his place. The change was very agreeable to the colored people, who\nsaid, \"God has sent us a good man this time.\" They loved him, and their\nchildren followed him for a smile or a kind word. Even the slaveholders\nfelt his influence. He brought to the rectory five slaves. His wife taught\nthem to read and write, and to be useful to her and themselves. As soon as\nhe was settled, he turned his attention to the needy slaves around him. He\nurged upon his parishioners the duty of having a meeting expressly for them\nevery Sunday, with a sermon adapted to their comprehension. After much\nargument and importunity, it was finally agreed that they might occupy the\ngallery of the church on Sunday evenings. Many colored people, hitherto\nunaccustomed to attend church, now gladly went to hear the gospel preached.\nThe sermons were simple, and they understood them. Moreover, it was the\nfirst time they had ever been addressed as human beings. It was not long\nbefore his white parishioners began to be dissatisfied. He was accused of\npreaching better sermons to the negroes than he did to them. He honestly\nconfessed that he bestowed more pains upon those sermons than upon any\nothers; for the slaves were reared in such ignorance that it was a\ndifficult task to adapt himself to their comprehension. Dissensions arose\nin the parish. Some wanted he should preach to them in the evening, and to\nthe slaves in the afternoon. In the midst of these disputings his wife\ndied, after a very short illness. Her slaves gathered round her dying bed\nin great sorrow. She said, \"I have tried to do you good and promote your\nhappiness; and if I have failed, it has not been for want of interest in\nyour welfare. Do not weep for me; but prepare for the new duties that lie\nbefore you. I leave you all free. May we meet in a better world.\" Her\nliberated slaves were sent away, with funds to establish them comfortably.\nThe colored people will long bless the memory of that truly Christian\nwoman. Soon after her death her husband preached his farewell sermon, and\nmany tears were shed at his departure.\n\nSeveral years after, he passed through our town and preached to his former\ncongregation. In his afternoon sermon he addressed the colored people. \"My\nfriends,\" said he, \"it affords me great happiness to have an opportunity of\nspeaking to you again. For two years I have been striving to do something\nfor the colored people of my own parish; but nothing is yet accomplished. I\nhave not even preached a sermon to them. Try to live according to the word\nof God, my friends. Your skin is darker than mine; but God judges men by\ntheir hearts, not by the color of their skins.\" This was strange doctrine\nfrom a southern pulpit. It was very offensive to slaveholders. They said he\nand his wife had made fools of their slaves, and that he preached like a\nfool to the negroes.\n\nI knew an old black man, whose piety and childlike trust in God were\nbeautiful to witness. At fifty-three years old he joined the Baptist\nchurch. He had a most earnest desire to learn to read. He thought he should\nknow how to serve God better if he could only read the Bible. He came to\nme, and begged me to teach him. He said he could not pay me, for he had no\nmoney; but he would bring me nice fruit when the season for it came. I\nasked him if he didn't know it was contrary to law; and that slaves were\nwhipped and imprisoned for teaching each other to read. This brought the\ntears into his eyes. \"Don't be troubled, uncle Fred,\" said I. \"I have no\nthoughts of refusing to teach you. I only told you of the law, that you\nmight know the danger, and be on your guard.\" He thought he could plan to\ncome three times a week without its being suspected. I selected a quiet\nnook, where no intruder was likely to penetrate, and there I taught him his\nA, B, C. Considering his age, his progress was astonishing. As soon as he\ncould spell in two syllables he wanted to spell out words in the Bible. The\nhappy smile that illuminated his face put joy into my heart. After spelling\nout a few words, he paused, and said, \"Honey, it 'pears when I can read dis\ngood book I shall be nearer to God. White man is got all de sense. He can\nlarn easy. It ain't easy for ole black man like me. I only wants to read\ndis book, dat I may know how to live; den I hab no fear 'bout dying.\"\n\nI tried to encourage him by speaking of the rapid progress he had made.\n\"Hab patience, child,\" he replied. \"I larns slow.\"\n\nI had no need of patience. His gratitude, and the happiness imparted, were\nmore than a recompense for all my trouble.\n\nAt the end of six months he had read through the New Testament, and could\nfind any text in it. One day, when he had recited unusually well, I said,\n\"Uncle Fred, how do you manage to get your lessons so well?\"\n\n\"Lord bress you, chile,\" he replied. \"You nebber gibs me a lesson dat I\ndon't pray to God to help me to understan' what I spells and what I reads.\nAnd he _does_ help me, chile. Bress his holy name!\"\n\nThere are thousands, who, like good uncle Fred, are thirsting for the water\nof life; but the law forbids it, and the churches withhold it. They send\nthe Bible to heathen abroad, and neglect the heathen at home. I am glad\nthat missionaries go out to the dark corners of the earth; but I ask them\nnot to overlook the dark corners at home. Talk to American slaveholders as\nyou talk to savages in Africa. Tell _them_ it was wrong to traffic in men.\nTell them it is sinful to sell their own children, and atrocious to violate\ntheir own daughters. Tell them that all men are brethren, and that man has\nno right to shut out the light of knowledge from his brother. Tell them\nthey are answerable to God for sealing up the Fountain of Life from souls\nthat are thirsting for it.\n\nThere are men who would gladly undertake such missionary work as this; but,\nalas! their number is small. They are hated by the south, and would be\ndriven from its soil, or dragged to prison to die, as others have been\nbefore them. The field is ripe for the harvest, and awaits the reapers.\nPerhaps the great grandchildren of uncle Fred may have freely imparted to\nthem the divine treasures, which he sought by stealth, at the risk of the\nprison and the scourge.\n\nAre doctors of divinity blind, or are they hypocrites? I suppose some are\nthe one, and some the other; but I think if they felt the interest in the\npoor and the lowly, that they ought to feel, they would not be so _easily_\nblinded. A clergyman who goes to the south, for the first time, has usually\nsome feeling, however vague, that slavery is wrong. The slaveholder\nsuspects this, and plays his game accordingly. He makes himself as\nagreeable as possible; talks on theology, and other kindred topics. The\nreverend gentleman is asked to invoke a blessing on a table loaded with\nluxuries. After dinner he walks round the premises, and sees the beautiful\ngroves and flowering vines, and the comfortable huts of favored household\nslaves. The southerner invites him to talk with those slaves. He asks them\nif they want to be free, and they say, \"O, no, massa.\" This is sufficient\nto satisfy him. He comes home to publish a \"South Side View of Slavery,\"\nand to complain of the exaggerations of abolitionists. He assures people\nthat he has been to the south, and seen slavery for himself; that it is a\nbeautiful \"patriarchal institution;\" that the slaves don't want their\nfreedom; that they have hallelujah meetings and other religious privileges.\n\nWhat does _he_ know of the half-starved wretches toiling from dawn till\ndark on the plantations? of mothers shrieking for their children, torn from\ntheir arms by slave traders? of young girls dragged down into moral filth?\nof pools of blood around the whipping post? of hounds trained to tear human\nflesh? of men screwed into cotton gins to die? The slaveholder showed him\nnone of these things, and the slaves dared not tell of them if he had asked\nthem.\n\nThere is a great difference between Christianity and religion at the south.\nIf a man goes to the communion table, and pays money into the treasury of\nthe church, no matter if it be the price of blood, he is called religious.\nIf a pastor has offspring by a woman not his wife, the church dismiss him,\nif she is a white woman; but if she is colored, it does not hinder his\ncontinuing to be their good shepherd.\n\nWhen I was told that Dr. Flint had joined the Episcopal church, I was much\nsurprised. I supposed that religion had a purifying effect on the character\nof men; but the worst persecutions I endured from him were after he was a\ncommunicant. The conversation of the doctor, the day after he had been\nconfirmed, certainly gave _me_ no indication that he had \"renounced the\ndevil and all his works.\" In answer to some of his usual talk, I reminded\nhim that he had just joined the church. \"Yes, Linda,\" said he. \"It was\nproper for me to do so. I am getting in years, and my position in society\nrequires it, and it puts an end to all the damned slang. You would do well\nto join the church, too, Linda.\"\n\n\"There are sinners enough in it already,\" rejoined I. \"If I could be\nallowed to live like a Christian, I should be glad.\"\n\n\"You can do what I require; and if you are faithful to me, you will be as\nvirtuous as my wife,\" he replied.\n\nI answered that the Bible didn't say so.\n\nHis voice became hoarse with rage. \"How dare you preach to me about your\ninfernal Bible!\" he exclaimed. \"What right have you, who are my negro, to\ntalk to me about what you would like and what you wouldn't like? I am your\nmaster, and you shall obey me.\"\n\nNo wonder the slaves sing,--\n\n   Ole Satan's church is here below;\n   Up to God's free church I hope to go.\n\n\n\nXIV. Another Link To Life.\n\n\nI had not returned to my master's house since the birth of my child. The\nold man raved to have me thus removed from his immediate power; but his\nwife vowed, by all that was good and great, she would kill me if I came\nback; and he did not doubt her word. Sometimes he would stay away for a\nseason. Then he would come and renew the old threadbare discourse about his\nforbearance and my ingratitude. He labored, most unnecessarily, to convince\nme that I had lowered myself. The venomous old reprobate had no need of\ndescanting on that theme. I felt humiliated enough. My unconscious babe was\nthe ever-present witness of my shame. I listened with silent contempt when\nhe talked about my having forfeited _his_ good opinion; but I shed bitter\ntears that I was no longer worthy of being respected by the good and pure.\nAlas! slavery still held me in its poisonous grasp. There was no chance for\nme to be respectable. There was no prospect of being able to lead a better\nlife.\n\nSometimes, when my master found that I still refused to accept what he\ncalled his kind offers, he would threaten to sell my child. \"Perhaps that\nwill humble you,\" said he.\n\nHumble _me_! Was I not already in the dust? But his threat lacerated my\nheart. I knew the law gave him power to fulfil it; for slaveholders have\nbeen cunning enough to enact that \"the child shall follow the condition of\nthe _mother_,\" not of the _father_, thus taking care that licentiousness\nshall not interfere with avarice. This reflection made me clasp my innocent\nbabe all the more firmly to my heart. Horrid visions passed through my mind\nwhen I thought of his liability to fall into the slave trader's hands. I\nwept over him, and said, \"O my child! perhaps they will leave you in some\ncold cabin to die, and then throw you into a hole, as if you were a dog.\"\n\nWhen Dr. Flint learned that I was again to be a mother, he was exasperated\nbeyond measure. He rushed from the house, and returned with a pair of\nshears. I had a fine head of hair; and he often railed about my pride of\narranging it nicely. He cut every hair close to my head, storming and\nswearing all the time. I replied to some of his abuse, and he struck me.\nSome months before, he had pitched me down stairs in a fit of passion; and\nthe injury I received was so serious that I was unable to turn myself in\nbed for many days. He then said, \"Linda, I swear by God I will never raise\nmy hand against you again;\" but I knew that he would forget his promise.\n\nAfter he discovered my situation, he was like a restless spirit from the\npit. He came every day; and I was subjected to such insults as no pen can\ndescribe. I would not describe them if I could; they were too low, too\nrevolting. I tried to keep them from my grandmother's knowledge as much as\nI could. I knew she had enough to sadden her life, without having my\ntroubles to bear. When she saw the doctor treat me with violence, and heard\nhim utter oaths terrible enough to palsy a man's tongue, she could not\nalways hold her peace. It was natural and motherlike that she should try to\ndefend me; but it only made matters worse.\n\nWhen they told me my new-born babe was a girl, my heart was heavier than it\nhad ever been before. Slavery is terrible for men; but it is far more\nterrible for women. Superadded to the burden common to all, _they_ have\nwrongs, and sufferings, and mortifications peculiarly their own.\n\nDr. Flint had sworn that he would make me suffer, to my last day, for this\nnew crime against _him_, as he called it; and as long as he had me in his\npower he kept his word. On the fourth day after the birth of my babe, he\nentered my room suddenly, and commanded me to rise and bring my baby to\nhim. The nurse who took care of me had gone out of the room to prepare some\nnourishment, and I was alone. There was no alternative. I rose, took up my\nbabe, and crossed the room to where he sat. \"Now stand there,\" said he,\n\"till I tell you to go back!\" My child bore a strong resemblance to her\nfather, and to the deceased Mrs. Sands, her grandmother. He noticed this;\nand while I stood before him, trembling with weakness, he heaped upon me\nand my little one every vile epithet he could think of. Even the\ngrandmother in her grave did not escape his curses. In the midst of his\nvituperations I fainted at his feet. This recalled him to his senses. He\ntook the baby from my arms, laid it on the bed, dashed cold water in my\nface, took me up, and shook me violently, to restore my consciousness\nbefore any one entered the room. Just then my grandmother came in, and he\nhurried out of the house. I suffered in consequence of this treatment; but\nI begged my friends to let me die, rather than send for the doctor. There\nwas nothing I dreaded so much as his presence. My life was spared; and I\nwas glad for the sake of my little ones. Had it not been for these ties to\nlife, I should have been glad to be released by death, though I had lived\nonly nineteen years.\n\nAlways it gave me a pang that my children had no lawful claim to a name.\nTheir father offered his; but, if I had wished to accept the offer, I dared\nnot while my master lived. Moreover, I knew it would not be accepted at\ntheir baptism. A Christian name they were at least entitled to; and we\nresolved to call my boy for our dear good Benjamin, who had gone far away\nfrom us.\n\nMy grandmother belonged to the church; and she was very desirous of having\nthe children christened. I knew Dr. Flint would forbid it, and I did not\nventure to attempt it. But chance favored me. He was called to visit a\npatient out of town, and was obliged to be absent during Sunday. \"Now is\nthe time,\" said my grandmother; \"we will take the children to church, and\nhave them christened.\"\n\nWhen I entered the church, recollections of my mother came over me, and I\nfelt subdued in spirit. There she had presented me for baptism, without any\nreason to feel ashamed. She had been married, and had such legal rights as\nslavery allows to a slave. The vows had at least been sacred to _her_, and\nshe had never violated them. I was glad she was not alive, to know under\nwhat different circumstances her grandchildren were presented for baptism.\nWhy had my lot been so different from my mother's? _Her_ master had died\nwhen she was a child; and she remained with her mistress till she married.\nShe was never in the power of any master; and thus she escaped one class of\nthe evils that generally fall upon slaves.\n\nWhen my baby was about to be christened, the former mistress of my father\nstepped up to me, and proposed to give it her Christian name. To this I\nadded the surname of my father, who had himself no legal right to it; for\nmy grandfather on the paternal side was a white gentleman. What tangled\nskeins are the genealogies of slavery! I loved my father; but it mortified\nme to be obliged to bestow his name on my children.\n\nWhen we left the church, my father's old mistress invited me to go home\nwith her. She clasped a gold chain round my baby's neck. I thanked her for\nthis kindness; but I did not like the emblem. I wanted no chain to be\nfastened on my daughter, not even if its links were of gold. How earnestly\nI prayed that she might never feel the weight of slavery's chain, whose\niron entereth into the soul!\n\n\n\nXV. Continued Persecutions.\n\n\nMy children grew finely; and Dr. Flint would often say to me, with an\nexulting smile. \"These brats will bring me a handsome sum of money one of\nthese days.\"\n\nI thought to myself that, God being my helper, they should never pass into\nhis hands. It seemed to me I would rather see them killed than have them\ngiven up to his power. The money for the freedom of myself and my children\ncould be obtained; but I derived no advantage from that circumstance. Dr.\nFlint loved money, but he loved power more. After much discussion, my\nfriends resolved on making another trial. There was a slaveholder about to\nleave for Texas, and he was commissioned to buy me. He was to begin with\nnine hundred dollars, and go up to twelve. My master refused his offers.\n\"Sir,\" said he, \"she don't belong to me. She is my daughter's property, and\nI have no right to sell her. I mistrust that you come from her paramour. If\nso, you may tell him that he cannot buy her for any money; neither can he\nbuy her children.\"\n\nThe doctor came to see me the next day, and my heart beat quicker as he\nentered. I never had seen the old man tread with so majestic a step. He\nseated himself and looked at me with withering scorn. My children had\nlearned to be afraid of him. The little one would shut her eyes and hide\nher face on my shoulder whenever she saw him; and Benny, who was now nearly\nfive years old, often inquired, \"What makes that bad man come here so many\ntimes? Does he want to hurt us?\" I would clasp the dear boy in my arms,\ntrusting that he would be free before he was old enough to solve the\nproblem. And now, as the doctor sat there so grim and silent, the child\nleft his play and came and nestled up by me. At last my tormentor spoke.\n\"So you are left in disgust, are you?\" said he. \"It is no more than I\nexpected. You remember I told you years ago that you would be treated so.\nSo he is tired of you? Ha! ha! ha! The virtuous madam don't like to hear\nabout it, does she? Ha! ha! ha!\" There was a sting in his calling me\nvirtuous madam. I no longer had the power of answering him as I had\nformerly done. He continued: \"So it seems you are trying to get up another\nintrigue. Your new paramour came to me, and offered to buy you; but you may\nbe assured you will not succeed. You are mine; and you shall be mine for\nlife. There lives no human being that can take you out of slavery. I would\nhave done it; but you rejected my kind offer.\"\n\nI told him I did not wish to get up any intrigue; that I had never seen the\nman who offered to buy me.\n\n\"Do you tell me I lie?\" exclaimed he, dragging me from my chair. \"Will you\nsay again that you never saw that man?\"\n\nI answered, \"I do say so.\"\n\nHe clinched my arm with a volley of oaths. Ben began to scream, and I told\nhim to go to his grandmother.\n\n\"Don't you stir a step, you little wretch!\" said he. The child drew nearer\nto me, and put his arms round me, as if he wanted to protect me. This was\ntoo much for my enraged master. He caught him up and hurled him across the\nroom. I thought he was dead, and rushed towards him to take him up.\n\n\"Not yet!\" exclaimed the doctor. \"Let him lie there till he comes to.\"\n\n\"Let me go! Let me go!\" I screamed, \"or I will raise the whole house.\" I\nstruggled and got away; but he clinched me again. Somebody opened the door,\nand he released me. I picked up my insensible child, and when I turned my\ntormentor was gone. Anxiously, I bent over the little form, so pale and\nstill; and when the brown eyes at last opened, I don't know whether I was\nvery happy. All the doctor's former persecutions were renewed. He came\nmorning, noon, and night. No jealous lover ever watched a rival more\nclosely than he watched me and the unknown slaveholder, with whom he\naccused me of wishing to get up an intrigue. When my grandmother was out of\nthe way he searched every room to find him.\n\nIn one of his visits, he happened to find a young girl, whom he had sold to\na trader a few days previous. His statement was, that he sold her because\nshe had been too familiar with the overseer. She had had a bitter life with\nhim, and was glad to be sold. She had no mother, and no near ties. She had\nbeen torn from all her family years before. A few friends had entered into\nbonds for her safety, if the trader would allow her to spend with them the\ntime that intervened between her sale and the gathering up of his human\nstock. Such a favor was rarely granted. It saved the trader the expense of\nboard and jail fees, and though the amount was small, it was a weighty\nconsideration in a slavetrader's mind.\n\nDr. Flint always had an aversion to meeting slaves after he had sold them.\nHe ordered Rose out of the house; but he was no longer her master, and she\ntook no notice of him. For once the crushed Rose was the conqueror. His\ngray eyes flashed angrily upon her; but that was the extent of his power.\n\"How came this girl here?\" he exclaimed. \"What right had you to allow it,\nwhen you knew I had sold her?\"\n\nI answered, \"This is my grandmother's house, and Rose came to see her. I\nhave no right to turn any body out of doors, that comes here for honest\npurposes.\"\n\nHe gave me the blow that would have fallen upon Rose if she had still been\nhis slave. My grandmother's attention had been attracted by loud voices,\nand she entered in time to see a second blow dealt. She was not a woman to\nlet such an outrage, in her own house, go unrebuked. The doctor undertook\nto explain that I had been insolent. Her indignant feelings rose higher and\nhigher, and finally boiled over in words. \"Get out of my house!\" she\nexclaimed. \"Go home, and take care of your wife and children, and you will\nhave enough to do, without watching my family.\"\n\nHe threw the birth of my children in her face, and accused her of\nsanctioning the life I was leading. She told him I was living with her by\ncompulsion of his wife; that he needn't accuse her, for he was the one to\nblame; he was the one who had caused all the trouble. She grew more and\nmore excited as she went on. \"I tell you what, Dr. Flint,\" said she, \"you\nain't got many more years to live, and you'd better be saying your prayers.\nIt will take 'em all, and more too, to wash the dirt off your soul.\"\n\n\"Do you know whom you are talking to?\" he exclaimed.\n\nShe replied, \"Yes, I know very well who I am talking to.\"\n\nHe left the house in a great rage. I looked at my grandmother. Our eyes\nmet. Their angry expression had passed away, but she looked sorrowful and\nweary--weary of incessant strife. I wondered that it did not lessen her\nlove for me; but if it did she never showed it. She was always kind, always\nready to sympathize with my troubles. There might have been peace and\ncontentment in that humble home if it had not been for the demon Slavery.\n\nThe winter passed undisturbed by the doctor. The beautiful spring came; and\nwhen Nature resumes her loveliness, the human soul is apt to revive also.\nMy drooping hopes came to life again with the flowers. I was dreaming of\nfreedom again; more for my children's sake than my own. I planned and I\nplanned. Obstacles hit against plans. There seemed no way of overcoming\nthem; and yet I hoped.\n\nBack came the wily doctor. I was not at home when he called. A friend had\ninvited me to a small party, and to gratify her I went. To my great\nconsternation, a messenger came in haste to say that Dr. Flint was at my\ngrandmother's, and insisted on seeing me. They did not tell him where I\nwas, or he would have come and raised a disturbance in my friend's house.\nThey sent me a dark wrapper, I threw it on and hurried home. My speed did\nnot save me; the doctor had gone away in anger. I dreaded the morning, but\nI could not delay it; it came, warm and bright. At an early hour the doctor\ncame and asked me where I had been last night. I told him. He did not\nbelieve me, and sent to my friend's house to ascertain the facts. He came\nin the afternoon to assure me he was satisfied that I had spoken the truth.\nHe seemed to be in a facetious mood, and I expected some jeers were coming.\n\"I suppose you need some recreation,\" said he, \"but I am surprised at your\nbeing there, among those negroes. It was not the place for _you_. Are you\n_allowed_ to visit such people?\"\n\nI understood this covert fling at the white gentleman who was my friend;\nbut I merely replied, \"I went to visit my friends, and any company they\nkeep is good enough for me.\"\n\nHe went on to say, \"I have seen very little of you of late, but my interest\nin you is unchanged. When I said I would have no more mercy on you I was\nrash. I recall my words. Linda, you desire freedom for yourself and your\nchildren, and you can obtain it only through me. If you agree to what I am\nabout to propose, you and they shall be free. There must be no\ncommunication of any kind between you and their father. I will procure a\ncottage, where you and the children can live together. Your labor shall be\nlight, such as sewing for my family. Think what is offered you, Linda--a\nhome and freedom! Let the past be forgotten. If I have been harsh with you\nat times, your willfulness drove me to it. You know I exact obedience from\nmy own children, and I consider you as yet a child.\"\n\nHe paused for an answer, but I remained silent. \"Why don't you speak?\"\nsaid he. \"What more do you wait for?\"\n\n\"Nothing, sir.\"\n\n\"Then you accept my offer?\"\n\n\"No, sir.\"\n\nHis anger was ready to break loose; but he succeeded in curbing it, and\nreplied, \"You have answered without thought. But I must let you know there\nare two sides to my proposition; if you reject the bright side, you will be\nobliged to take the dark one. You must either accept my offer, or you and\nyour children shall be sent to your young master's plantation, there to\nremain till your young mistress is married; and your children shall fare\nlike the rest of the negro children. I give you a week to consider it.\"\n\nHe was shrewd; but I knew he was not to be trusted. I told him I was ready\nto give my answer now.\n\n\"I will not receive it now,\" he replied. \"You act too much from impulse.\nRemember that you and your children can be free a week from to-day if you\nchoose.\"\n\nOn what a monstrous chance hung the destiny of my children! I knew that my\nmaster's offer was a snare, and that if I entered it escape would be\nimpossible. As for his promise, I knew him so well that I was sure if he\ngave me free papers, they would be so managed as to have no legal value.\nThe alternative was inevitable. I resolved to go to the plantation. But\nthen I thought how completely I should be in his power, and the prospect\nwas appalling. Even if I should kneel before him, and implore him to spare\nme, for the sake of my children, I knew he would spurn me with his foot,\nand my weakness would be his triumph.\n\nBefore the week expired, I heard that young Mr. Flint was about to be\nmarried to a lady of his own stamp. I foresaw the position I should occupy\nin his establishment. I had once been sent to the plantation for\npunishment, and fear of the son had induced the father to recall me very\nsoon. My mind was made up; I was resolved that I would foil my master and\nsave my children, or I would perish in the attempt. I kept my plans to\nmyself; I knew that friends would try to dissuade me from them, and I would\nnot wound their feelings by rejecting their advice.\n\nOn the decisive day the doctor came, and said he hoped I had made a wise\nchoice.\n\n\"I am ready to go to the plantation, sir,\" I replied.\n\n\"Have you thought how important your decision is to your children?\" said\nhe.\n\nI told him I had.\n\n\"Very well. Go to the plantation, and my curse go with you,\" he replied.\n\"Your boy shall be put to work, and he shall soon be sold; and your girl\nshall be raised for the purpose of selling well. Go your own ways!\" He left\nthe room with curses, not to be repeated.\n\nAs I stood rooted to the spot, my grandmother came and said, \"Linda, child,\nwhat did you tell him?\"\n\nI answered that I was going to the plantation.\n\n\"_Must_ you go?\" said she. \"Can't something be done to stop it?\"\n\nI told her it was useless to try; but she begged me not to give up. She\nsaid she would go to the doctor, and remind him how long and how faithfully\nshe had served in the family, and how she had taken her own baby from her\nbreast to nourish his wife. She would tell him I had been out of the family\nso long they would not miss me; that she would pay them for my time, and\nthe money would procure a woman who had more strength for the situation\nthan I had. I begged her not to go; but she persisted in saying, \"He will\nlisten to _me_, Linda.\" She went, and was treated as I expected. He coolly\nlistened to what she said, but denied her request. He told her that what he\ndid was for my good, that my feelings were entirely above my situation, and\nthat on the plantation I would receive treatment that was suitable to my\nbehavior.\n\nMy grandmother was much cast down. I had my secret hopes; but I must fight\nmy battle alone. I had a woman's pride, and a mother's love for my\nchildren; and I resolved that out of the darkness of this hour a brighter\ndawn should rise for them. My master had power and law on his side; I had a\ndetermined will. There is might in each.\n\n\n\nXVI. Scenes At The Plantation.\n\n\nEarly the next morning I left my grandmother's with my youngest child. My\nboy was ill, and I left him behind. I had many sad thoughts as the old\nwagon jolted on. Hitherto, I had suffered alone; now, my little one was to\nbe treated as a slave. As we drew near the great house, I thought of the\ntime when I was formerly sent there out of revenge. I wondered for what\npurpose I was now sent. I could not tell. I resolved to obey orders so far\nas duty required; but within myself, I determined to make my stay as short\nas possible. Mr. Flint was waiting to receive us, and told me to follow him\nup stairs to receive orders for the day. My little Ellen was left below in\nthe kitchen. It was a change for her, who had always been so carefully\ntended. My young master said she might amuse herself in the yard. This was\nkind of him, since the child was hateful to his sight. My task was to fit\nup the house for the reception of the bride. In the midst of sheets,\ntablecloths, towels, drapery, and carpeting, my head was as busy planning,\nas were my fingers with the needle. At noon I was allowed to go to Ellen.\nShe had sobbed herself to sleep. I heard Mr. Flint say to a neighbor, \"I've\ngot her down here, and I'll soon take the town notions out of her head. My\nfather is partly to blame for her nonsense. He ought to have broke her in\nlong ago.\" The remark was made within my hearing, and it would have been\nquite as manly to have made it to my face. He _had_ said things to my face\nwhich might, or might not, have surprised his neighbor if he had known of\nthem. He was \"a chip of the old block.\"\n\nI resolved to give him no cause to accuse me of being too much of a lady,\nso far as work was concerned. I worked day and night, with wretchedness\nbefore me. When I lay down beside my child, I felt how much easier it would\nbe to see her die than to see her master beat her about, as I daily saw him\nbeat other little ones. The spirit of the mothers was so crushed by the\nlash, that they stood by, without courage to remonstrate. How much more\nmust I suffer, before I should be \"broke in\" to that degree?\n\nI wished to appear as contented as possible. Sometimes I had an opportunity\nto send a few lines home; and this brought up recollections that made it\ndifficult, for a time, to seem calm and indifferent to my lot.\nNotwithstanding my efforts, I saw that Mr. Flint regarded me with a\nsuspicious eye. Ellen broke down under the trials of her new life.\nSeparated from me, with no one to look after her, she wandered about, and\nin a few days cried herself sick. One day, she sat under the window where I\nwas at work, crying that weary cry which makes a mother's heart bleed. I\nwas obliged to steel myself to bear it. After a while it ceased. I looked\nout, and she was gone. As it was near noon, I ventured to go down in search\nof her. The great house was raised two feet above the ground. I looked\nunder it, and saw her about midway, fast asleep. I crept under and drew her\nout. As I held her in my arms, I thought how well it would be for her if\nshe never waked up; and I uttered my thought aloud. I was startled to hear\nsome one say, \"Did you speak to me?\" I looked up, and saw Mr. Flint\nstanding beside me. He said nothing further, but turned, frowning, away.\nThat night he sent Ellen a biscuit and a cup of sweetened milk. This\ngenerosity surprised me. I learned afterwards, that in the afternoon he had\nkilled a large snake, which crept from under the house; and I supposed that\nincident had prompted his unusual kindness.\n\nThe next morning the old cart was loaded with shingles for town. I put\nEllen into it, and sent her to her grandmother. Mr. Flint said I ought to\nhave asked his permission. I told him the child was sick, and required\nattention which I had no time to give. He let it pass; for he was aware\nthat I had accomplished much work in a little time.\n\nI had been three weeks on the plantation, when I planned a visit home. It\nmust be at night, after every body was in bed. I was six miles from town,\nand the road was very dreary. I was to go with a young man, who, I knew,\noften stole to town to see his mother. One night, when all was quiet, we\nstarted. Fear gave speed to our steps, and we were not long in performing\nthe journey. I arrived at my grandmother's. Her bed room was on the first\nfloor, and the window was open, the weather being warm. I spoke to her and\nshe awoke. She let me in and closed the window, lest some late passer-by\nshould see me. A light was brought, and the whole household gathered round\nme, some smiling and some crying. I went to look at my children, and\nthanked God for their happy sleep. The tears fell as I leaned over them. As\nI moved to leave, Benny stirred. I turned back, and whispered, \"Mother is\nhere.\" After digging at his eyes with his little fist, they opened, and he\nsat up in bed, looking at me curiously. Having satisfied himself that it\nwas I, he exclaimed, \"O mother! you ain't dad, are you? They didn't cut off\nyour head at the plantation, did they?\"\n\nMy time was up too soon, and my guide was waiting for me. I laid Benny back\nin his bed, and dried his tears by a promise to come again soon. Rapidly we\nretraced our steps back to the plantation. About half way we were met by a\ncompany of four patrols. Luckily we heard their horse's hoofs before they\ncame in sight, and we had time to hide behind a large tree. They passed,\nhallooing and shouting in a manner that indicated a recent carousal. How\nthankful we were that they had not their dogs with them! We hastened our\nfootsteps, and when we arrived on the plantation we heard the sound of the\nhand-mill. The slaves were grinding their corn. We were safely in the house\nbefore the horn summoned them to their labor. I divided my little parcel of\nfood with my guide, knowing that he had lost the chance of grinding his\ncorn, and must toil all day in the field.\n\nMr. Flint often took an inspection of the house, to see that no one was\nidle. The entire management of the work was trusted to me, because he knew\nnothing about it; and rather than hire a superintendent he contented\nhimself with my arrangements. He had often urged upon his father the\nnecessity of having me at the plantation to take charge of his affairs, and\nmake clothes for the slaves; but the old man knew him too well to consent\nto that arrangement.\n\nWhen I had been working a month at the plantation, the great aunt of Mr.\nFlint came to make him a visit. This was the good old lady who paid fifty\ndollars for my grandmother, for the purpose of making her free, when she\nstood on the auction block. My grandmother loved this old lady, whom we all\ncalled Miss Fanny. She often came to take tea with us. On such occasions\nthe table was spread with a snow-white cloth, and the china cups and silver\nspoons were taken from the old-fashioned buffet. There were hot muffins,\ntea rusks, and delicious sweetmeats. My grandmother kept two cows, and the\nfresh cream was Miss Fanny's delight. She invariably declared that it was\nthe best in town. The old ladies had cosey times together. They would work\nand chat, and sometimes, while talking over old times, their spectacles\nwould get dim with tears, and would have to be taken off and wiped. When\nMiss Fanny bade us good by, her bag was filled with grandmother's best\ncakes, and she was urged to come again soon.\n\nThere had been a time when Dr. Flint's wife came to take tea with us, and\nwhen her children were also sent to have a feast of \"Aunt Marthy's\" nice\ncooking. But after I became an object of her jealousy and spite, she was\nangry with grandmother for giving a shelter to me and my children. She\nwould not even speak to her in the street. This wounded my grandmother's\nfeelings, for she could not retain ill will against the woman whom she had\nnourished with her milk when a babe. The doctor's wife would gladly have\nprevented our intercourse with Miss Fanny if she could have done it, but\nfortunately she was not dependent on the bounty of the Flints. She had\nenough to be independent; and that is more than can ever be gained from\ncharity, however lavish it may be.\n\nMiss Fanny was endeared to me by many recollections, and I was rejoiced to\nsee her at the plantation. The warmth of her large, loyal heart made the\nhouse seem pleasanter while she was in it. She staid a week, and I had many\ntalks with her. She said her principal object in coming was to see how I\nwas treated, and whether any thing could be done for me. She inquired\nwhether she could help me in any way. I told her I believed not. She\ncondoled with me in her own peculiar way; saying she wished that I and all\nmy grandmother's family were at rest in our graves, for not until then\nshould she feel any peace about us. The good old soul did not dream that I\nwas planning to bestow peace upon her, with regard to myself and my\nchildren; not by death, but by securing our freedom.\n\nAgain and again I had traversed those dreary twelve miles, to and from the\ntown; and all the way, I was meditating upon some means of escape for\nmyself and my children. My friends had made every effort that ingenuity\ncould devise to effect our purchase, but all their plans had proved\nabortive. Dr. Flint was suspicious, and determined not to loosen his grasp\nupon us. I could have made my escape alone; but it was more for my helpless\nchildren than for myself that I longed for freedom. Though the boon would\nhave been precious to me, above all price, I would not have taken it at the\nexpense of leaving them in slavery. Every trial I endured, every sacrifice\nI made for their sakes, drew them closer to my heart, and gave me fresh\ncourage to beat back the dark waves that rolled and rolled over me in a\nseemingly endless night of storms.\n\nThe six weeks were nearly completed, when Mr. Flint's bride was expected to\ntake possession of her new home. The arrangements were all completed, and\nMr. Flint said I had done well. He expected to leave home on Saturday, and\nreturn with his bride the following Wednesday. After receiving various\norders from him, I ventured to ask permission to spend Sunday in town. It\nwas granted; for which favor I was thankful. It was the first I had ever\nasked of him, and I intended it should be the last. I needed more than one\nnight to accomplish the project I had in view; but the whole of Sunday\nwould give me an opportunity. I spent the Sabbath with my grandmother. A\ncalmer, more beautiful day never came down out of heaven. To me it was a\nday of conflicting emotions. Perhaps it was the last day I should ever\nspend under that dear, old sheltering roof! Perhaps these were the last\ntalks I should ever have with the faithful old friend of my whole life!\nPerhaps it was the last time I and my children should be together! Well,\nbetter so, I thought, than that they should be slaves. I knew the doom that\nawaited my fair baby in slavery, and I determined to save her from it, or\nperish in the attempt. I went to make this vow at the graves of my poor\nparents, in the burying-ground of the slaves. \"There the wicked cease from\ntroubling, and there the weary be at rest. There the prisoners rest\ntogether; they hear not the voice of the oppressor; the servant is free\nfrom his master.\" I knelt by the graves of my parents, and thanked God, as\nI had often done before, that they had not lived to witness my trials, or\nto mourn over my sins. I had received my mother's blessing when she died;\nand in many an hour of tribulation I had seemed to hear her voice,\nsometimes chiding me, sometimes whispering loving words into my wounded\nheart. I have shed many and bitter tears, to think that when I am gone from\nmy children they cannot remember me with such entire satisfaction as I\nremembered my mother.\n\nThe graveyard was in the woods, and twilight was coming on. Nothing broke\nthe death-like stillness except the occasional twitter of a bird. My spirit\nwas overawed by the solemnity of the scene. For more than ten years I had\nfrequented this spot, but never had it seemed to me so sacred as now. A\nblack stump, at the head of my mother's grave, was all that remained of a\ntree my father had planted. His grave was marked by a small wooden board,\nbearing his name, the letters of which were nearly obliterated. I knelt\ndown and kissed them, and poured forth a prayer to God for guidance and\nsupport in the perilous step I was about to take. As I passed the wreck of\nthe old meeting house, where, before Nat Turner's time, the slaves had been\nallowed to meet for worship, I seemed to hear my father's voice come from\nit, bidding me not to tarry till I reached freedom or the grave. I rushed\non with renovated hopes. My trust in God had been strengthened by that\nprayer among the graves.\n\nMy plan was to conceal myself at the house of a friend, and remain there a\nfew weeks till the search was over. My hope was that the doctor would get\ndiscouraged, and, for fear of losing my value, and also of subsequently\nfinding my children among the missing, he would consent to sell us; and I\nknew somebody would buy us. I had done all in my power to make my children\ncomfortable during the time I expected to be separated from them. I was\npacking my things, when grandmother came into the room, and asked what I\nwas doing. \"I am putting my things in order,\" I replied. I tried to look\nand speak cheerfully; but her watchful eye detected something beneath the\nsurface. She drew me towards her, and asked me to sit down. She looked\nearnestly at me, and said, \"Linda, do you want to kill your old\ngrandmother? Do you mean to leave your little, helpless children? I am old\nnow, and cannot do for your babies as I once did for you.\"\n\nI replied, that if I went away, perhaps their father would be able to\nsecure their freedom.\n\n\"Ah, my child,\" said she, \"don't trust too much to him. Stand by your own\nchildren, and suffer with them till death. Nobody respects a mother who\nforsakes her children; and if you leave them, you will never have a happy\nmoment. If you go, you will make me miserable the short time I have to\nlive. You would be taken and brought back, and your sufferings would be\ndreadful. Remember poor Benjamin. Do give it up, Linda. Try to bear a\nlittle longer. Things may turn out better than we expect.\"\n\nMy courage failed me, in view of the sorrow I should bring on that\nfaithful, loving old heart. I promised that I would try longer, and that I\nwould take nothing out of her house without her knowledge.\n\nWhenever the children climbed on my knee, or laid their heads on my lap,\nshe would say, \"Poor little souls! what would you do without a mother? She\ndon't love you as I do.\" And she would hug them to her own bosom, as if to\nreproach me for my want of affection; but she knew all the while that I\nloved them better than my life. I slept with her that night, and it was the\nlast time. The memory of it haunted me for many a year.\n\nOn Monday I returned to the plantation, and busied myself with preparations\nfor the important day. Wednesday came. It was a beautiful day, and the\nfaces of the slaves were as bright as the sunshine. The poor creatures were\nmerry. They were expecting little presents from the bride, and hoping for\nbetter times under her administration. I had no such hopes for them. I knew\nthat the young wives of slaveholders often thought their authority and\nimportance would be best established and maintained by cruelty; and what I\nhad heard of young Mrs. Flint gave me no reason to expect that her rule\nover them would be less severe than that of the master and overseer. Truly,\nthe colored race are the most cheerful and forgiving people on the face of\nthe earth. That their masters sleep in safety is owing to their\nsuperabundance of heart; and yet they look upon their sufferings with less\npity than they would bestow on those of a horse or a dog.\n\nI stood at the door with others to receive the bridegroom and bride. She\nwas a handsome, delicate-looking girl, and her face flushed with emotion at\nsight of her new home. I thought it likely that visions of a happy future\nwere rising before her. It made me sad; for I knew how soon clouds would\ncome over her sunshine. She examined every part of the house, and told me\nshe was delighted with the arrangements I had made. I was afraid old Mrs.\nFlint had tried to prejudice her against me, and I did my best to please\nher.\n\nAll passed off smoothly for me until dinner time arrived. I did not mind\nthe embarrassment of waiting on a dinner party, for the first time in my\nlife, half so much as I did the meeting with Dr. Flint and his wife, who\nwould be among the guests. It was a mystery to me why Mrs. Flint had not\nmade her appearance at the plantation during all the time I was putting the\nhouse in order. I had not met her, face to face, for five years, and I had\nno wish to see her now. She was a praying woman, and, doubtless, considered\nmy present position a special answer to her prayers. Nothing could please\nher better than to see me humbled and trampled upon. I was just where she\nwould have me--in the power of a hard, unprincipled master. She did not\nspeak to me when she took her seat at table; but her satisfied, triumphant\nsmile, when I handed her plate, was more eloquent than words. The old\ndoctor was not so quiet in his demonstrations. He ordered me here and\nthere, and spoke with peculiar emphasis when he said \"your _mistress_.\" I\nwas drilled like a disgraced soldier. When all was over, and the last key\nturned, I sought my pillow, thankful that God had appointed a season of\nrest for the weary.\n\nThe next day my new mistress began her housekeeping. I was not exactly\nappointed maid of all work; but I was to do whatever I was told. Monday\nevening came. It was always a busy time. On that night the slaves received\ntheir weekly allowance of food. Three pounds of meat, a peck of corn, and\nperhaps a dozen herring were allowed to each man. Women received a pound\nand a half of meat, a peck of corn, and the same number of herring.\nChildren over twelve years old had half the allowance of the women. The\nmeat was cut and weighed by the foreman of the field hands, and piled on\nplanks before the meat house. Then the second foreman went behind the\nbuilding, and when the first foreman called out, \"Who takes this piece of\nmeat?\" he answered by calling somebody's name. This method was resorted to\nas a means of preventing partiality in distributing the meat. The young\nmistress came out to see how things were done on her plantation, and she\nsoon gave a specimen of her character. Among those in waiting for their\nallowance was a very old slave, who had faithfully served the Flint family\nthrough three generations. When he hobbled up to get his bit of meat, the\nmistress said he was too old to have any allowance; that when niggers were\ntoo old to work, they ought to be fed on grass. Poor old man! He suffered\nmuch before he found rest in the grave.\n\nMy mistress and I got along very well together. At the end of a week, old\nMrs. Flint made us another visit, and was closeted a long time with her\ndaughter-in-law. I had my suspicions what was the subject of the\nconference. The old doctor's wife had been informed that I could leave the\nplantation on one condition, and she was very desirous to keep me there. If\nshe had trusted me, as I deserved to be trusted by her, she would have had\nno fears of my accepting that condition. When she entered her carriage to\nreturn home, she said to young Mrs. Flint, \"Don't neglect to send for them\nas quick as possible.\" My heart was on the watch all the time, and I at\nonce concluded that she spoke of my children. The doctor came the next day,\nand as I entered the room to spread the tea table, I heard him say, \"Don't\nwait any longer. Send for them to-morrow.\" I saw through the plan. They\nthought my children's being there would fetter me to the spot, and that it\nwas a good place to break us all in to abject submission to our lot as\nslaves. After the doctor left, a gentleman called, who had always\nmanifested friendly feelings towards my grandmother and her family. Mr.\nFlint carried him over the plantation to show him the results of labor\nperformed by men and women who were unpaid, miserably clothed, and half\nfamished. The cotton crop was all they thought of. It was duly admired, and\nthe gentleman returned with specimens to show his friends. I was ordered to\ncarry water to wash his hands. As I did so, he said, \"Linda, how do you\nlike your new home?\" I told him I liked it as well as I expected. He\nreplied, \"They don't think you are contented, and to-morrow they are going\nto bring your children to be with you. I am sorry for you, Linda. I hope\nthey will treat you kindly.\" I hurried from the room, unable to thank him.\nMy suspicions were correct. My children were to be brought to the\nplantation to be \"broke in.\"\n\nTo this day I feel grateful to the gentleman who gave me this timely\ninformation. It nerved me to immediate action.\n\n\n\nXVII. The Flight.\n\n\nMr. Flint was hard pushed for house servants, and rather than lose me he\nhad restrained his malice. I did my work faithfully, though not, of course,\nwith a willing mind. They were evidently afraid I should leave them. Mr.\nFlint wished that I should sleep in the great house instead of the\nservants' quarters. His wife agreed to the proposition, but said I mustn't\nbring my bed into the house, because it would scatter feathers on her\ncarpet. I knew when I went there that they would never think of such a\nthing as furnishing a bed of any kind for me and my little ones. I\ntherefore carried my own bed, and now I was forbidden to use it. I did as I\nwas ordered. But now that I was certain my children were to be put in their\npower, in order to give them a stronger hold on me, I resolved to leave\nthem that night. I remembered the grief this step would bring upon my dear\nold grandmother, and nothing less than the freedom of my children would\nhave induced me to disregard her advice. I went about my evening work with\ntrembling steps. Mr. Flint twice called from his chamber door to inquire\nwhy the house was not locked up. I replied that I had not done my work.\n\"You have had time enough to do it,\" said he. \"Take care how you answer\nme!\"\n\nI shut all the windows, locked all the doors, and went up to the third\nstory, to wait till midnight. How long those hours seemed, and how\nfervently I prayed that God would not forsake me in this hour of utmost\nneed! I was about to risk every thing on the throw of a die; and if I\nfailed, O what would become of me and my poor children? They would be made\nto suffer for my fault.\n\nAt half past twelve I stole softly down stairs. I stopped on the second\nfloor, thinking I heard a noise. I felt my way down into the parlor, and\nlooked out of the window. The night was so intensely dark that I could see\nnothing. I raised the window very softly and jumped out. Large drops of\nrain were falling, and the darkness bewildered me. I dropped on my knees,\nand breathed a short prayer to God for guidance and protection. I groped my\nway to the road, and rushed towards the town with almost lightning speed. I\narrived at my grandmother's house, but dared not see her. She would say,\n\"Linda, you are killing me;\" and I knew that would unnerve me. I tapped\nsoftly at the window of a room, occupied by a woman, who had lived in the\nhouse several years. I knew she was a faithful friend, and could be trusted\nwith my secret. I tapped several times before she heard me. At last she\nraised the window, and I whispered, \"Sally, I have run away. Let me in,\nquick.\" She opened the door softly, and said in low tones, \"For God's sake,\ndon't. Your grandmother is trying to buy you and de chillern. Mr. Sands was\nhere last week. He tole her he was going away on business, but he wanted\nher to go ahead about buying you and de chillern, and he would help her all\nhe could. Don't run away, Linda. Your grandmother is all bowed down wid\ntrouble now.\"\n\nI replied, \"Sally, they are going to carry my children to the plantation\nto-morrow; and they will never sell them to any body so long as they have\nme in their power. Now, would you advise me to go back?\"\n\n\"No, chile, no,\" answered she. \"When dey finds you is gone, dey won't want\nde plague ob de chillern; but where is you going to hide? Dey knows ebery\ninch ob dis house.\"\n\nI told her I had a hiding-place, and that was all it was best for her to\nknow. I asked her to go into my room as soon as it was light, and take all\nmy clothes out of my trunk, and pack them in hers; for I knew Mr. Flint and\nthe constable would be there early to search my room. I feared the sight of\nmy children would be too much for my full heart; but I could not go into\nthe uncertain future without one last look. I bent over the bed where lay\nmy little Benny and baby Ellen. Poor little ones! fatherless and\nmotherless! Memories of their father came over me. He wanted to be kind to\nthem; but they were not all to him, as they were to my womanly heart. I\nknelt and prayed for the innocent little sleepers. I kissed them lightly,\nand turned away.\n\nAs I was about to open the street door, Sally laid her hand on my shoulder,\nand said, \"Linda, is you gwine all alone? Let me call your uncle.\"\n\n\"No, Sally,\" I replied, \"I want no one to be brought into trouble on my\naccount.\"\n\nI went forth into the darkness and rain. I ran on till I came to the house\nof the friend who was to conceal me.\n\nEarly the next morning Mr. Flint was at my grandmother's inquiring for me.\nShe told him she had not seen me, and supposed I was at the plantation. He\nwatched her face narrowly, and said, \"Don't you know any thing about her\nrunning off?\" She assured him that she did not. He went on to say, \"Last\nnight she ran off without the least provocation. We had treated her very\nkindly. My wife liked her. She will soon be found and brought back. Are her\nchildren with you?\" When told that they were, he said, \"I am very glad to\nhear that. If they are here, she cannot be far off. If I find out that any\nof my niggers have had any thing to do with this damned business, I'll give\n'em five hundred lashes.\" As he started to go to his father's, he turned\nround and added, persuasively, \"Let her be brought back, and she shall have\nher children to live with her.\"\n\nThe tidings made the old doctor rave and storm at a furious rate. It was a\nbusy day for them. My grandmother's house was searched from top to bottom.\nAs my trunk was empty, they concluded I had taken my clothes with me.\nBefore ten o'clock every vessel northward bound was thoroughly examined,\nand the law against harboring fugitives was read to all on board. At night\na watch was set over the town. Knowing how distressed my grandmother would\nbe, I wanted to send her a message; but it could not be done. Every one who\nwent in or out of her house was closely watched. The doctor said he would\ntake my children, unless she became responsible for them; which of course\nshe willingly did. The next day was spent in searching. Before night, the\nfollowing advertisement was posted at every corner, and in every public\nplace for miles round:--\n\n$300 REWARD! Ran away from the subscriber, an intelligent, bright, mulatto\ngirl, named Linda, 21 years of age. Five feet four inches high. Dark eyes,\nand black hair inclined to curl; but it can be made straight. Has a decayed\nspot on a front tooth. She can read and write, and in all probability will\ntry to get to the Free States. All persons are forbidden, under penalty of\nlaw, to harbor or employ said slave. $150 will be given to whoever takes\nher in the state, and $300 if taken out of the state and delivered to me,\nor lodged in jail.\n\nDr. Flint.\n\n\n\nXVIII. Months Of Peril.\n\n\nThe search for me was kept up with more perseverence than I had\nanticipated. I began to think that escape was impossible. I was in great\nanxiety lest I should implicate the friend who harbored me. I knew the\nconsequences would be frightful; and much as I dreaded being caught, even\nthat seemed better than causing an innocent person to suffer for kindness\nto me. A week had passed in terrible suspense, when my pursuers came into\nsuch close vicinity that I concluded they had tracked me to my\nhiding-place. I flew out of the house, and concealed myself in a thicket of\nbushes. There I remained in an agony of fear for two hours. Suddenly, a\nreptile of some kind seized my leg. In my fright, I struck a blow which\nloosened its hold, but I could not tell whether I had killed it; it was so\ndark, I could not see what it was; I only knew it was something cold and\nslimy. The pain I felt soon indicated that the bite was poisonous. I was\ncompelled to leave my place of concealment, and I groped my way back into\nthe house. The pain had become intense, and my friend was startled by my\nlook of anguish. I asked her to prepare a poultice of warm ashes and\nvinegar, and I applied it to my leg, which was already much swollen. The\napplication gave me some relief, but the swelling did not abate. The dread\nof being disabled was greater than the physical pain I endured. My friend\nasked an old woman, who doctored among the slaves, what was good for the\nbite of a snake or a lizard. She told her to steep a dozen coppers in\nvinegar, over night, and apply the cankered vinegar to the inflamed\npart.[1]\n\n[Footnote 1: The poison of a snake is a powerful acid, and is counteracted\nby powerful alkalies, such as potash, ammonia, &c. The Indians are\naccustomed to apply wet ashes, or plunge the limb into strong lie. White\nmen, employed to lay out railroads in snaky places, often carry ammonia\nwith them as an antidote.--EDITOR.]\n\nI had succeeded in cautiously conveying some messages to my relatives. They\nwere harshly threatened, and despairing of my having a chance to escape,\nthey advised me to return to my master, ask his forgiveness, and let him\nmake an example of me. But such counsel had no influence with me. When I\nstarted upon this hazardous undertaking, I had resolved that, come what\nwould, there should be no turning back. \"Give me liberty, or give me\ndeath,\" was my motto. When my friend contrived to make known to my\nrelatives the painful situation I had been in for twenty-four hours, they\nsaid no more about my going back to my master. Something must be done, and\nthat speedily; but where to return for help, they knew not. God in his\nmercy raised up \"a friend in need.\"\n\nAmong the ladies who were acquainted with my grandmother, was one who had\nknown her from childhood, and always been very friendly to her. She had\nalso known my mother and her children, and felt interested for them. At\nthis crisis of affairs she called to see my grandmother, as she not\nunfrequently did. She observed the sad and troubled expression of her face,\nand asked if she knew where Linda was, and whether she was safe. My\ngrandmother shook her head, without answering. \"Come, Aunt Martha,\"\nsaid the kind lady, \"tell me all about it. Perhaps I can do something\nto help you.\" The husband of this lady held many slaves, and bought and\nsold slaves. She also held a number in her own name; but she treated\nthem kindly, and would never allow any of them to be sold. She was\nunlike the majority of slaveholders' wives. My grandmother looked\nearnestly at her. Something in the expression of her face said\n\"Trust me!\" and she did trust her. She listened attentively to\nthe details of my story, and sat thinking for a while. At last she said,\n\"Aunt Martha, I pity you both. If you think there is any chance of Linda's\ngetting to the Free States, I will conceal her for a time. But first you\nmust solemnly promise that my name shall never be mentioned. If such a\nthing should become known, it would ruin me and my family. No one in my\nhouse must know of it, except the cook. She is so faithful that I would\ntrust my own life with her; and I know she likes Linda. It is a great risk;\nbut I trust no harm will come of it. Get word to Linda to be ready as soon\nas it is dark, before the patrols are out. I will send the housemaids on\nerrands, and Betty shall go to meet Linda.\" The place where we were to meet\nwas designated and agreed upon. My grandmother was unable to thank the lady\nfor this noble deed; overcome by her emotions, she sank on her knees and\nsobbed like a child.\n\nI received a message to leave my friend's house at such an hour, and go to\na certain place where a friend would be waiting for me. As a matter of\nprudence no names were mentioned. I had no means of conjecturing who I was\nto meet, or where I was going. I did not like to move thus blindfolded, but\nI had no choice. It would not do for me to remain where I was. I disguised\nmyself, summoned up courage to meet the worst, and went to the appointed\nplace. My friend Betty was there; she was the last person I expected to\nsee. We hurried along in silence. The pain in my leg was so intense that it\nseemed as if I should drop but fear gave me strength. We reached the house\nand entered unobserved. Her first words were: \"Honey, now you is safe. Dem\ndevils ain't coming to search _dis_ house. When I get you into missis' safe\nplace, I will bring some nice hot supper. I specs you need it after all dis\nskeering.\" Betty's vocation led her to think eating the most important\nthing in life. She did not realize that my heart was too full for me to\ncare much about supper.\n\nThe mistress came to meet us, and led me up stairs to a small room over her\nown sleeping apartment. \"You will be safe here, Linda,\" said she; \"I keep\nthis room to store away things that are out of use. The girls are not\naccustomed to be sent to it, and they will not suspect any thing unless\nthey hear some noise. I always keep it locked, and Betty shall take care of\nthe key. But you must be very careful, for my sake as well as your own; and\nyou must never tell my secret; for it would ruin me and my family. I will\nkeep the girls busy in the morning, that Betty may have a chance to bring\nyour breakfast; but it will not do for her to come to you again till night.\nI will come to see you sometimes. Keep up your courage. I hope this state\nof things will not last long.\" Betty came with the \"nice hot supper,\" and\nthe mistress hastened down stairs to keep things straight till she\nreturned. How my heart overflowed with gratitude! Words choked in my\nthroat; but I could have kissed the feet of my benefactress. For that deed\nof Christian womanhood, may God forever bless her!\n\nI went to sleep that night with the feeling that I was for the present the\nmost fortunate slave in town. Morning came and filled my little cell with\nlight. I thanked the heavenly Father for this safe retreat. Opposite my\nwindow was a pile of feather beds. On the top of these I could lie\nperfectly concealed, and command a view of the street through which Dr.\nFlint passed to his office. Anxious as I was, I felt a gleam of\nsatisfaction when I saw him. Thus far I had outwitted him, and I triumphed\nover it. Who can blame slaves for being cunning? They are constantly\ncompelled to resort to it. It is the only weapon of the weak and oppressed\nagainst the strength of their tyrants.\n\nI was daily hoping to hear that my master had sold my children; for I knew\nwho was on the watch to buy them. But Dr. Flint cared even more for revenge\nthan he did for money. My brother William and the good aunt who had served\nin his family twenty years, and my little Benny, and Ellen, who was a\nlittle over two years old, were thrust into jail, as a means of compelling\nmy relatives to give some information about me. He swore my grandmother\nshould never see one of them again till I was brought back. They kept these\nfacts from me for several days. When I heard that my little ones were in a\nloathsome jail, my first impulse was to go to them. I was encountering\ndangers for the sake of freeing them, and must I be the cause of their\ndeath? The thought was agonizing. My benefactress tried to soothe me by\ntelling me that my aunt would take good care of the children while they\nremained in jail. But it added to my pain to think that the good old aunt,\nwho had always been so kind to her sister's orphan children, should be shut\nup in prison for no other crime than loving them. I suppose my friends\nfeared a reckless movement on my part, knowing, as they did, that my life\nwas bound up in my children. I received a note from my brother William. It\nwas scarcely legible, and ran thus: \"Wherever you are, dear sister, I beg\nof you not to come here. We are all much better off than you are. If you\ncome, you will ruin us all. They would force you to tell where you had\nbeen, or they would kill you. Take the advice of your friends; if not for\nthe sake of me and your children, at least for the sake of those you would\nruin.\"\n\nPoor William! He also must suffer for being my brother. I took his advice\nand kept quiet. My aunt was taken out of jail at the end of a month,\nbecause Mrs. Flint could not spare her any longer. She was tired of being\nher own housekeeper. It was quite too fatiguing to order her dinner and eat\nit too. My children remained in jail, where brother William did all he\ncould for their comfort. Betty went to see them sometimes, and brought me\ntidings. She was not permitted to enter the jail; but William would hold\nthem up to the grated window while she chatted with them. When she repeated\ntheir prattle, and told me how they wanted to see their ma, my tears would\nflow. Old Betty would exclaim, \"Lors, chile! what's you crying 'bout? Dem\nyoung uns vil kill you dead. Don't be so chick'n hearted! If you does, you\nvil nebber git thro' dis world.\"\n\nGood old soul! She had gone through the world childless. She had never had\nlittle ones to clasp their arms round her neck; she had never seen their\nsoft eyes looking into hers; no sweet little voices had called her mother;\nshe had never pressed her own infants to her heart, with the feeling that\neven in fetters there was something to live for. How could she realize my\nfeelings? Betty's husband loved children dearly, and wondered why God had\ndenied them to him. He expressed great sorrow when he came to Betty with\nthe tidings that Ellen had been taken out of jail and carried to Dr.\nFlint's. She had the measles a short time before they carried her to jail,\nand the disease had left her eyes affected. The doctor had taken her home\nto attend to them. My children had always been afraid of the doctor and his\nwife. They had never been inside of their house. Poor little Ellen cried\nall day to be carried back to prison. The instincts of childhood are true.\nShe knew she was loved in the jail. Her screams and sobs annoyed Mrs.\nFlint. Before night she called one of the slaves, and said, \"Here, Bill,\ncarry this brat back to the jail. I can't stand her noise. If she would be\nquiet I should like to keep the little minx. She would make a handy\nwaiting-maid for my daughter by and by. But if she staid here, with her\nwhite face, I suppose I should either kill her or spoil her. I hope the\ndoctor will sell them as far as wind and water can carry them. As for their\nmother, her ladyship will find out yet what she gets by running away. She\nhasn't so much feeling for her children as a cow has for its calf. If she\nhad, she would have come back long ago, to get them out of jail, and save\nall this expense and trouble. The good-for-nothing hussy! When she is\ncaught, she shall stay in jail, in irons, for one six months, and then be\nsold to a sugar plantation. I shall see her broke in yet. What do you stand\nthere for, Bill? Why don't you go off with the brat? Mind, now, that you\ndon't let any of the niggers speak to her in the street!\"\n\nWhen these remarks were reported to me, I smiled at Mrs. Flint's saying\nthat she should either kill my child or spoil her. I thought to myself\nthere was very little danger of the latter. I have always considered it as\none of God's special providences that Ellen screamed till she was carried\nback to jail.\n\nThat same night Dr. Flint was called to a patient, and did not return till\nnear morning. Passing my grandmother's, he saw a light in the house, and\nthought to himself, \"Perhaps this has something to do with Linda.\" He\nknocked, and the door was opened. \"What calls you up so early?\" said he. \"I\nsaw your light, and I thought I would just stop and tell you that I have\nfound out where Linda is. I know where to put my hands on her, and I shall\nhave her before twelve o'clock.\" When he had turned away, my grandmother\nand my uncle looked anxiously at each other. They did not know whether or\nnot it was merely one of the doctor's tricks to frighten them. In their\nuncertainty, they thought it was best to have a message conveyed to my\nfriend Betty. Unwilling to alarm her mistress, Betty resolved to dispose of\nme herself. She came to me, and told me to rise and dress quickly. We\nhurried down stairs, and across the yard, into the kitchen. She locked the\ndoor, and lifted up a plank in the floor. A buffalo skin and a bit of\ncarpet were spread for me to lie on, and a quilt thrown over me. \"Stay\ndar,\" said she, \"till I sees if dey know 'bout you. Dey say dey vil put\nthar hans on you afore twelve o'clock. If dey _did_ know whar you are, dey\nwon't know _now_. Dey'll be disapinted dis time. Dat's all I got to say. If\ndey comes rummagin 'mong _my_ tings, de'll get one bressed sarssin from dis\n'ere nigger.\" In my shallow bed I had but just room enough to bring my\nhands to my face to keep the dust out of my eyes; for Betty walked over me\ntwenty times in an hour, passing from the dresser to the fireplace. When\nshe was alone, I could hear her pronouncing anathemas over Dr. Flint and\nall his tribe, every now and then saying, with a chuckling laugh, \"Dis\nnigger's too cute for 'em dis time.\" When the housemaids were about, she\nhad sly ways of drawing them out, that I might hear what they would say.\nShe would repeat stories she had heard about my being in this, or that, or\nthe other place. To which they would answer, that I was not fool enough to\nbe staying round there; that I was in Philadelphia or New York before this\ntime. When all were abed and asleep, Betty raised the plank, and said,\n\"Come out, chile; come out. Dey don't know nottin 'bout you. Twas only\nwhite folks' lies, to skeer de niggers.\"\n\nSome days after this adventure I had a much worse fright. As I sat very\nstill in my retreat above stairs, cheerful visions floated through my mind.\nI thought Dr. Flint would soon get discouraged, and would be willing to\nsell my children, when he lost all hopes of making them the means of my\ndiscovery. I knew who was ready to buy them. Suddenly I heard a voice that\nchilled my blood. The sound was too familiar to me, it had been too\ndreadful, for me not to recognize at once my old master. He was in the\nhouse, and I at once concluded he had come to seize me. I looked round in\nterror. There was no way of escape. The voice receded. I supposed the\nconstable was with him, and they were searching the house. In my alarm I\ndid not forget the trouble I was bringing on my generous benefactress. It\nseemed as if I were born to bring sorrow on all who befriended me, and that\nwas the bitterest drop in the bitter cup of my life. After a while I heard\napproaching footsteps; the key was turned in my door. I braced myself\nagainst the wall to keep from falling. I ventured to look up, and there\nstood my kind benefactress alone. I was too much overcome to speak, and\nsunk down upon the floor.\n\n\"I thought you would hear your master's voice,\" she said; \"and knowing you\nwould be terrified, I came to tell you there is nothing to fear. You may\neven indulge in a laugh at the old gentleman's expense. He is so sure you\nare in New York, that he came to borrow five hundred dollars to go in\npursuit of you. My sister had some money to loan on interest. He has\nobtained it, and proposes to start for New York to-night. So, for the\npresent, you see you are safe. The doctor will merely lighten his pocket\nhunting after the bird he has left behind.\"\n\n\n\nXIX. The Children Sold.\n\n\nThe Doctor came back from New York, of course without accomplishing his\npurpose. He had expended considerable money, and was rather disheartened.\nMy brother and the children had now been in jail two months, and that also\nwas some expense. My friends thought it was a favorable time to work on his\ndiscouraged feelings. Mr. Sands sent a speculator to offer him nine hundred\ndollars for my brother William, and eight hundred for the two children.\nThese were high prices, as slaves were then selling; but the offer was\nrejected. If it had been merely a question of money, the doctor would have\nsold any boy of Benny's age for two hundred dollars; but he could not bear\nto give up the power of revenge. But he was hard pressed for money, and he\nrevolved the matter in his mind. He knew that if he could keep Ellen till\nshe was fifteen, he could sell her for a high price; but I presume he\nreflected that she might die, or might be stolen away. At all events, he\ncame to the conclusion that he had better accept the slave-trader's offer.\nMeeting him in the street, he inquired when he would leave town. \"To-day,\nat ten o'clock,\" he replied. \"Ah, do you go so soon?\" said the doctor. \"I\nhave been reflecting upon your proposition, and I have concluded to let you\nhave the three negroes if you will say nineteen hundred dollars.\" After\nsome parley, the trader agreed to his terms. He wanted the bill of sale\ndrawn up and signed immediately, as he had a great deal to attend to during\nthe short time he remained in town. The doctor went to the jail and told\nWilliam he would take him back into his service if he would promise to\nbehave himself but he replied that he would rather be sold. \"And you\n_shall_ be sold, you ungrateful rascal!\" exclaimed the doctor. In less than\nan hour the money was paid, the papers were signed, sealed, and delivered,\nand my brother and children were in the hands of the trader.\n\nIt was a hurried transaction; and after it was over, the doctor's\ncharacteristic caution returned. He went back to the speculator, and said,\n\"Sir, I have come to lay you under obligations of a thousand dollars not to\nsell any of those negroes in this state.\" \"You come too late,\" replied the\ntrader; \"our bargain is closed.\" He had, in fact, already sold them to Mr.\nSands, but he did not mention it. The doctor required him to put irons on\n\"that rascal, Bill,\" and to pass through the back streets when he took his\ngang out of town. The trader was privately instructed to concede to his\nwishes. My good old aunt went to the jail to bid the children good by,\nsupposing them to be the speculator's property, and that she should never\nsee them again. As she held Benny in her lap, he said, \"Aunt Nancy, I want\nto show you something.\" He led her to the door and showed her a long row of\nmarks, saying, \"Uncle Will taught me to count. I have made a mark for every\nday I have been here, and it is sixty days. It is a long time; and the\nspeculator is going to take me and Ellen away. He's a bad man. It's wrong\nfor him to take grandmother's children. I want to go to my mother.\"\n\nMy grandmother was told that the children would be restored to her, but she\nwas requested to act as if they were really to be sent away. Accordingly,\nshe made up a bundle of clothes and went to the jail. When she arrived, she\nfound William handcuffed among the gang, and the children in the trader's\ncart. The scene seemed too much like reality. She was afraid there might\nhave been some deception or mistake. She fainted, and was carried home.\n\nWhen the wagon stopped at the hotel, several gentlemen came out and\nproposed to purchase William, but the trader refused their offers, without\nstating that he was already sold. And now came the trying hour for that\ndrove of human beings, driven away like cattle, to be sold they knew not\nwhere. Husbands were torn from wives, parents from children, never to look\nupon each other again this side the grave. There was wringing of hands and\ncries of despair.\n\nDr. Flint had the supreme satisfaction of seeing the wagon leave town, and\nMrs. Flint had the gratification of supposing that my children were going\n\"as far as wind and water would carry them.\" According to agreement, my\nuncle followed the wagon some miles, until they came to an old farm house.\nThere the trader took the irons from William, and as he did so, he said,\n\"You are a damned clever fellow. I should like to own you myself. Them\ngentlemen that wanted to buy you said you was a bright, honest chap, and I\nmust git you a good home. I guess your old master will swear to-morrow, and\ncall himself an old fool for selling the children. I reckon he'll never git\ntheir mammy back again. I expect she's made tracks for the north. Good by,\nold boy. Remember, I have done you a good turn. You must thank me by\ncoaxing all the pretty gals to go with me next fall. That's going to be my\nlast trip. This trading in niggers is a bad business for a fellow that's\ngot any heart. Move on, you fellows!\" And the gang went on, God alone knows\nwhere.\n\nMuch as I despise and detest the class of slave-traders, whom I regard as\nthe vilest wretches on earth, I must do this man the justice to say that he\nseemed to have some feeling. He took a fancy to William in the jail, and\nwanted to buy him. When he heard the story of my children, he was willing\nto aid them in getting out of Dr. Flint's power, even without charging the\ncustomary fee.\n\nMy uncle procured a wagon and carried William and the children back to\ntown. Great was the joy in my grandmother's house! The curtains were\nclosed, and the candles lighted. The happy grandmother cuddled the little\nones to her bosom. They hugged her, and kissed her, and clapped their\nhands, and shouted. She knelt down and poured forth one of her heartfelt\nprayers of thanksgiving to God. The father was present for a while; and\nthough such a \"parental relation\" as existed between him and my children\ntakes slight hold on the hearts or consciences of slaveholders, it must be\nthat he experienced some moments of pure joy in witnessing the happiness he\nhad imparted.\n\nI had no share in the rejoicings of that evening. The events of the day had\nnot come to my knowledge. And now I will tell you something that happened\nto me; though you will, perhaps, think it illustrates the superstition of\nslaves. I sat in my usual place on the floor near the window, where I could\nhear much that was said in the street without being seen. The family had\nretired for the night, and all was still. I sat there thinking of my\nchildren, when I heard a low strain of music. A band of serenaders were\nunder the window, playing \"Home, sweet home.\" I listened till the sounds\ndid not seem like music, but like the moaning of children. It seemed as if\nmy heart would burst. I rose from my sitting posture, and knelt. A streak\nof moonlight was on the floor before me, and in the midst of it appeared\nthe forms of my two children. They vanished; but I had seen them\ndistinctly. Some will call it a dream, others a vision. I know not how to\naccount for it, but it made a strong impression on my mind, and I felt\ncertain something had happened to my little ones.\n\nI had not seen Betty since morning. Now I heard her softly turning the key.\nAs soon as she entered, I clung to her, and begged her to let me know\nwhether my children were dead, or whether they were sold; for I had seen\ntheir spirits in my room, and I was sure something had happened to them.\n\"Lor, chile,\" said she, putting her arms round me, \"you's got de\nhigh-sterics. I'll sleep wid you to-night, 'cause you'll make a noise, and\nruin missis. Something has stirred you up mightily. When you is done cryin,\nI'll talk wid you. De chillern is well, and mighty happy. I seed 'em\nmyself. Does dat satisfy you? Dar, chile, be still! Somebody vill hear\nyou.\" I tried to obey her. She lay down, and was soon sound asleep; but no\nsleep would come to my eyelids.\n\nAt dawn, Betty was up and off to the kitchen. The hours passed on, and the\nvision of the night kept constantly recurring to my thoughts. After a while\nI heard the voices of two women in the entry. In one of them I recognized\nthe housemaid. The other said to her, \"Did you know Linda Brent's children\nwas sold to the speculator yesterday. They say ole massa Flint was mighty\nglad to see 'em drove out of town; but they say they've come back agin. I\n'spect it's all their daddy's doings. They say he's bought William too.\nLor! how it will take hold of ole massa Flint! I'm going roun' to aunt\nMarthy's to see 'bout it.\"\n\nI bit my lips till the blood came to keep from crying out. Were my children\nwith their grandmother, or had the speculator carried them off? The\nsuspense was dreadful. Would Betty _never_ come, and tell me the truth\nabout it? At last she came, and I eagerly repeated what I had overheard.\nHer face was one broad, bright smile. \"Lor, you foolish ting!\" said she.\n\"I'se gwine to tell you all 'bout it. De gals is eating thar breakfast, and\nmissus tole me to let her tell you; but, poor creeter! t'aint right to keep\nyou waitin', and I'se gwine to tell you. Brudder, chillern, all is bought\nby de daddy! I'se laugh more dan nuff, tinking 'bout ole massa Flint. Lor,\nhow he _vill_ swar! He's got ketched dis time, any how; but I must be\ngetting out o' dis, or dem gals vill come and ketch _me_.\"\n\nBetty went off laughing; and I said to myself, \"Can it be true that my\nchildren are free? I have not suffered for them in vain. Thank God!\"\n\nGreat surprise was expressed when it was known that my children had\nreturned to their grandmother's. The news spread through the town, and many\na kind word was bestowed on the little ones.\n\nDr. Flint went to my grandmother's to ascertain who was the owner of my\nchildren, and she informed him. \"I expected as much,\" said he. \"I am glad\nto hear it. I have had news from Linda lately, and I shall soon have her.\nYou need never expect to see _her_ free. She shall be my slave as long as I\nlive, and when I am dead she shall be the slave of my children. If I ever\nfind out that you or Phillip had anything to do with her running off I'll\nkill him. And if I meet William in the street, and he presumes to look at\nme, I'll flog him within an inch of his life. Keep those brats out of my\nsight!\"\n\nAs he turned to leave, my grandmother said something to remind him of his\nown doings. He looked back upon her, as if he would have been glad to\nstrike her to the ground.\n\nI had my season of joy and thanksgiving. It was the first time since my\nchildhood that I had experienced any real happiness. I heard of the old\ndoctor's threats, but they no longer had the same power to trouble me. The\ndarkest cloud that hung over my life had rolled away. Whatever slavery\nmight do to me, it could not shackle my children. If I fell a sacrifice, my\nlittle ones were saved. It was well for me that my simple heart believed\nall that had been promised for their welfare. It is always better to trust\nthan to doubt.\n\n\n\nXX. New Perils.\n\n\nThe doctor, more exasperated than ever, again tried to revenge himself on\nmy relatives. He arrested uncle Phillip on the charge of having aided my\nflight. He was carried before a court, and swore truly that he knew nothing\nof my intention to escape, and that he had not seen me since I left my\nmaster's plantation. The doctor then demanded that he should give bail for\nfive hundred dollars that he would have nothing to do with me. Several\ngentlemen offered to be security for him; but Mr. Sands told him he had\nbetter go back to jail, and he would see that he came out without giving\nbail.\n\nThe news of his arrest was carried to my grandmother, who conveyed it to\nBetty. In the kindness of her heart, she again stowed me away under the\nfloor; and as she walked back and forth, in the performance of her culinary\nduties, she talked apparently to herself, but with the intention that I\nshould hear what was going on. I hoped that my uncle's imprisonment would\nlast but few days; still I was anxious. I thought it likely Dr. Flint would\ndo his utmost to taunt and insult him, and I was afraid my uncle might lose\ncontrol of himself, and retort in some way that would be construed into a\npunishable offence; and I was well aware that in court his word would not\nbe taken against any white man's. The search for me was renewed. Something\nhad excited suspicions that I was in the vicinity. They searched the house\nI was in. I heard their steps and their voices. At night, when all were\nasleep, Betty came to release me from my place of confinement. The fright I\nhad undergone, the constrained posture, and the dampness of the ground,\nmade me ill for several days. My uncle was soon after taken out of prison;\nbut the movements of all my relatives, and of all our friends, were very\nclosely watched.\n\nWe all saw that I could not remain where I was much longer. I had already\nstaid longer than was intended, and I knew my presence must be a source of\nperpetual anxiety to my kind benefactress. During this time, my friends had\nlaid many plans for my escape, but the extreme vigilance of my persecutors\nmade it impossible to carry them into effect.\n\nOne morning I was much startled by hearing somebody trying to get into my\nroom. Several keys were tried, but none fitted. I instantly conjectured it\nwas one of the housemaids; and I concluded she must either have heard some\nnoise in the room, or have noticed the entrance of Betty. When my friend\ncame, at her usual time, I told her what had happened. \"I knows who it\nwas,\" said she. \"Tend upon it, 'twas dat Jenny. Dat nigger allers got de\ndebble in her.\" I suggested that she might have seen or heard something\nthat excited her curiosity.\n\n\"Tut! tut! chile!\" exclaimed Betty, \"she ain't seen notin', nor hearn\nnotin'. She only 'spects something. Dat's all. She wants to fine out who\nhab cut and make my gownd. But she won't nebber know. Dat's sartin. I'll\ngit missis to fix her.\"\n\nI reflected a moment, and said, \"Betty, I must leave here to-night.\"\n\n\"Do as you tink best, poor chile,\" she replied. \"I'se mighty 'fraid dat\n'ere nigger vill pop on you some time.\"\n\nShe reported the incident to her mistress, and received orders to keep\nJenny busy in the kitchen till she could see my uncle Phillip. He told her\nhe would send a friend for me that very evening. She told him she hoped I\nwas going to the north, for it was very dangerous for me to remain any\nwhere in the vicinity. Alas, it was not an easy thing, for one in my\nsituation, to go to the north. In order to leave the coast quite clear for\nme, she went into the country to spend the day with her brother, and took\nJenny with her. She was afraid to come and bid me good by, but she left a\nkind message with Betty. I heard her carriage roll from the door, and I\nnever again saw her who had so generously befriended the poor, trembling\nfugitive! Though she was a slaveholder, to this day my heart blesses her!\n\nI had not the slightest idea where I was going. Betty brought me a suit of\nsailor's clothes,--jacket, trowsers, and tarpaulin hat. She gave me a small\nbundle, saying I might need it where I was going. In cheery tones, she\nexclaimed, \"I'se _so_ glad you is gwine to free parts! Don't forget ole\nBetty. P'raps I'll come 'long by and by.\"\n\nI tried to tell her how grateful I felt for all her kindness. But she\ninterrupted me. \"I don't want no tanks, honey. I'se glad I could help you,\nand I hope de good Lord vill open de path for you. I'se gwine wid you to de\nlower gate. Put your hands in your pockets, and walk ricketty, like de\nsailors.\"\n\nI performed to her satisfaction. At the gate I found Peter, a young colored\nman, waiting for me. I had known him for years. He had been an apprentice\nto my father, and had always borne a good character. I was not afraid to\ntrust to him. Betty bade me a hurried good by, and we walked off. \"Take\ncourage, Linda,\" said my friend Peter. \"I've got a dagger, and no man shall\ntake you from me, unless he passes over my dead body.\"\n\nIt was a long time since I had taken a walk out of doors, and the fresh air\nrevived me. It was also pleasant to hear a human voice speaking to me above\na whisper. I passed several people whom I knew, but they did not recognize\nme in my disguise. I prayed internally that, for Peter's sake, as well as\nmy own, nothing might occur to bring out his dagger. We walked on till we\ncame to the wharf. My aunt Nancy's husband was a seafaring man, and it had\nbeen deemed necessary to let him into our secret. He took me into his boat,\nrowed out to a vessel not far distant, and hoisted me on board. We three\nwere the only occupants of the vessel. I now ventured to ask what they\nproposed to do with me. They said I was to remain on board till near dawn,\nand then they would hide me in Snaky Swamp, till my uncle Phillip had\nprepared a place of concealment for me. If the vessel had been bound north,\nit would have been of no avail to me, for it would certainly have been\nsearched. About four o'clock, we were again seated in the boat, and rowed\nthree miles to the swamp. My fear of snakes had been increased by the\nvenomous bite I had received, and I dreaded to enter this hiding place. But\nI was in no situation to choose, and I gratefully accepted the best that my\npoor, persecuted friends could do for me.\n\nPeter landed first, and with a large knife cut a path through bamboos and\nbriers of all descriptions. He came back, took me in his arms, and carried\nme to a seat made among the bamboos. Before we reached it, we were covered\nwith hundreds of mosquitos. In an hour's time they had so poisoned my flesh\nthat I was a pitiful sight to behold. As the light increased, I saw snake\nafter snake crawling round us. I had been accustomed to the sight of snakes\nall my life, but these were larger than any I had ever seen. To this day I\nshudder when I remember that morning. As evening approached, the number of\nsnakes increased so much that we were continually obliged to thrash them\nwith sticks to keep them from crawling over us. The bamboos were so high\nand so thick that it was impossible to see beyond a very short distance.\nJust before it became dark we procured a seat nearer to the entrance of the\nswamp, being fearful of losing our way back to the boat. It was not long\nbefore we heard the paddle of oars, and the low whistle, which had been\nagreed upon as a signal. We made haste to enter the boat, and were rowed\nback to the vessel. I passed a wretched night; for the heat of the swamp,\nthe mosquitos, and the constant terror of snakes, had brought on a burning\nfever. I had just dropped asleep, when they came and told me it was time to\ngo back to that horrid swamp. I could scarcely summon courage to rise. But\neven those large, venomous snakes were less dreadful to my imagination than\nthe white men in that community called civilized. This time Peter took a\nquantity of tobacco to burn, to keep off the mosquitos. It produced the\ndesired effect on them, but gave me nausea and severe headache. At dark we\nreturned to the vessel. I had been so sick during the day, that Peter\ndeclared I should go home that night, if the devil himself was on patrol.\nThey told me a place of concealment had been provided for me at my\ngrandmother's. I could not imagine how it was possible to hide me in her\nhouse, every nook and corner of which was known to the Flint family. They\ntold me to wait and see. We were rowed ashore, and went boldly through the\nstreets, to my grandmother's. I wore my sailor's clothes, and had blackened\nmy face with charcoal. I passed several people whom I knew. The father of\nmy children came so near that I brushed against his arm; but he had no idea\nwho it was.\n\n\"You must make the most of this walk,\" said my friend Peter, \"for you may\nnot have another very soon.\"\n\nI thought his voice sounded sad. It was kind of him to conceal from me what\na dismal hole was to be my home for a long, long time.\n\n\n\nXXI. The Loophole Of Retreat.\n\n\nA small shed had been added to my grandmother's house years ago. Some\nboards were laid across the joists at the top, and between these boards and\nthe roof was a very small garret, never occupied by any thing but rats and\nmice. It was a pent roof, covered with nothing but shingles, according to\nthe southern custom for such buildings. The garret was only nine feet long\nand seven wide. The highest part was three feet high, and sloped down\nabruptly to the loose board floor. There was no admission for either light\nor air. My uncle Phillip, who was a carpenter, had very skilfully made a\nconcealed trap-door, which communicated with the storeroom. He had been\ndoing this while I was waiting in the swamp. The storeroom opened upon a\npiazza. To this hole I was conveyed as soon as I entered the house. The air\nwas stifling; the darkness total. A bed had been spread on the floor. I\ncould sleep quite comfortably on one side; but the slope was so sudden that\nI could not turn on my other without hitting the roof. The rats and mice\nran over my bed; but I was weary, and I slept such sleep as the wretched\nmay, when a tempest has passed over them. Morning came. I knew it only by\nthe noises I heard; for in my small den day and night were all the same. I\nsuffered for air even more than for light. But I was not comfortless. I\nheard the voices of my children. There was joy and there was sadness in the\nsound. It made my tears flow. How I longed to speak to them! I was eager to\nlook on their faces; but there was no hole, no crack, through which I could\npeep. This continued darkness was oppressive. It seemed horrible to sit or\nlie in a cramped position day after day, without one gleam of light. Yet I\nwould have chosen this, rather than my lot as a slave, though white people\nconsidered it an easy one; and it was so compared with the fate of others.\nI was never cruelly overworked; I was never lacerated with the whip from\nhead to foot; I was never so beaten and bruised that I could not turn from\none side to the other; I never had my heel-strings cut to prevent my\nrunning away; I was never chained to a log and forced to drag it about,\nwhile I toiled in the fields from morning till night; I was never branded\nwith hot iron, or torn by bloodhounds. On the contrary, I had always been\nkindly treated, and tenderly cared for, until I came into the hands of Dr.\nFlint. I had never wished for freedom till then. But though my life in\nslavery was comparatively devoid of hardships, God pity the woman who is\ncompelled to lead such a life!\n\nMy food was passed up to me through the trap-door my uncle had contrived;\nand my grandmother, my uncle Phillip, and aunt Nancy would seize such\nopportunities as they could, to mount up there and chat with me at the\nopening. But of course this was not safe in the daytime. It must all be\ndone in darkness. It was impossible for me to move in an erect position,\nbut I crawled about my den for exercise. One day I hit my head against\nsomething, and found it was a gimlet. My uncle had left it sticking there\nwhen he made the trap-door. I was as rejoiced as Robinson Crusoe could have\nbeen at finding such a treasure. It put a lucky thought into my head. I\nsaid to myself, \"Now I will have some light. Now I will see my children.\" I\ndid not dare to begin my work during the daytime, for fear of attracting\nattention. But I groped round; and having found the side next the street,\nwhere I could frequently see my children, I stuck the gimlet in and waited\nfor evening. I bored three rows of holes, one above another; then I bored\nout the interstices between. I thus succeeded in making one hole about an\ninch long and an inch broad. I sat by it till late into the night, to enjoy\nthe little whiff of air that floated in. In the morning I watched for my\nchildren. The first person I saw in the street was Dr. Flint. I had a\nshuddering, superstitious feeling that it was a bad omen. Several familiar\nfaces passed by. At last I heard the merry laugh of children, and presently\ntwo sweet little faces were looking up at me, as though they knew I was\nthere, and were conscious of the joy they imparted. How I longed to _tell_\nthem I was there!\n\nMy condition was now a little improved. But for weeks I was tormented by\nhundreds of little red insects, fine as a needle's point, that pierced\nthrough my skin, and produced an intolerable burning. The good grandmother\ngave me herb teas and cooling medicines, and finally I got rid of them. The\nheat of my den was intense, for nothing but thin shingles protected me from\nthe scorching summer's sun. But I had my consolations. Through my\npeeping-hole I could watch the children, and when they were near enough, I\ncould hear their talk. Aunt Nancy brought me all the news she could hear at\nDr. Flint's. From her I learned that the doctor had written to New York to\na colored woman, who had been born and raised in our neighborhood, and had\nbreathed his contaminating atmosphere. He offered her a reward if she could\nfind out any thing about me. I know not what was the nature of her reply;\nbut he soon after started for New York in haste, saying to his family that\nhe had business of importance to transact. I peeped at him as he passed on\nhis way to the steamboat. It was a satisfaction to have miles of land and\nwater between us, even for a little while; and it was a still greater\nsatisfaction to know that he believed me to be in the Free States. My\nlittle den seemed less dreary than it had done. He returned, as he did from\nhis former journey to New York, without obtaining any satisfactory\ninformation. When he passed our house next morning, Benny was standing at\nthe gate. He had heard them say that he had gone to find me, and he called\nout, \"Dr. Flint, did you bring my mother home? I want to see her.\" The\ndoctor stamped his foot at him in a rage, and exclaimed, \"Get out of the\nway, you little damned rascal! If you don't, I'll cut off your head.\"\n\nBenny ran terrified into the house, saying, \"You can't put me in jail\nagain. I don't belong to you now.\" It was well that the wind carried the\nwords away from the doctor's ear. I told my grandmother of it, when we had\nour next conference at the trap-door, and begged of her not to allow the\nchildren to be impertinent to the irascible old man.\n\nAutumn came, with a pleasant abatement of heat. My eyes had become\naccustomed to the dim light, and by holding my book or work in a certain\nposition near the aperture I contrived to read and sew. That was a great\nrelief to the tedious monotony of my life. But when winter came, the cold\npenetrated through the thin shingle roof, and I was dreadfully chilled. The\nwinters there are not so long, or so severe, as in northern latitudes; but\nthe houses are not built to shelter from cold, and my little den was\npeculiarly comfortless. The kind grandmother brought me bedclothes and warm\ndrinks. Often I was obliged to lie in bed all day to keep comfortable; but\nwith all my precautions, my shoulders and feet were frostbitten. O, those\nlong, gloomy days, with no object for my eye to rest upon, and no thoughts\nto occupy my mind, except the dreary past and the uncertain future! I was\nthankful when there came a day sufficiently mild for me to wrap myself up\nand sit at the loophole to watch the passers by. Southerners have the habit\nof stopping and talking in the streets, and I heard many conversations not\nintended to meet my ears. I heard slave-hunters planning how to catch some\npoor fugitive. Several times I heard allusions to Dr. Flint, myself, and\nthe history of my children, who, perhaps, were playing near the gate. One\nwould say, \"I wouldn't move my little finger to catch her, as old Flint's\nproperty.\" Another would say, \"I'll catch _any_ nigger for the reward. A\nman ought to have what belongs to him, if he _is_ a damned brute.\" The\nopinion was often expressed that I was in the Free States. Very rarely did\nany one suggest that I might be in the vicinity. Had the least suspicion\nrested on my grandmother's house, it would have been burned to the ground.\nBut it was the last place they thought of. Yet there was no place, where\nslavery existed, that could have afforded me so good a place of\nconcealment.\n\nDr. Flint and his family repeatedly tried to coax and bribe my children to\ntell something they had heard said about me. One day the doctor took them\ninto a shop, and offered them some bright little silver pieces and gay\nhandkerchiefs if they would tell where their mother was. Ellen shrank away\nfrom him, and would not speak; but Benny spoke up, and said, \"Dr. Flint, I\ndon't know where my mother is. I guess she's in New York; and when you go\nthere again, I wish you'd ask her to come home, for I want to see her; but\nif you put her in jail, or tell her you'll cut her head off, I'll tell her\nto go right back.\"\n\n\n\nXXII. Christmas Festivities.\n\n\nChristmas was approaching. Grandmother brought me materials, and I busied\nmyself making some new garments and little playthings for my children. Were\nit not that hiring day is near at hand, and many families are fearfully\nlooking forward to the probability of separation in a few days, Christmas\nmight be a happy season for the poor slaves. Even slave mothers try to\ngladden the hearts of their little ones on that occasion. Benny and Ellen\nhad their Christmas stockings filled. Their imprisoned mother could not\nhave the privilege of witnessing their surprise and joy. But I had the\npleasure of peeping at them as they went into the street with their new\nsuits on. I heard Benny ask a little playmate whether Santa Claus brought\nhim any thing. \"Yes,\" replied the boy; \"but Santa Claus ain't a real man.\nIt's the children's mothers that put things into the stockings.\" \"No, that\ncan't be,\" replied Benny, \"for Santa Claus brought Ellen and me these new\nclothes, and my mother has been gone this long time.\"\n\nHow I longed to tell him that his mother made those garments, and that many\na tear fell on them while she worked!\n\nEvery child rises early on Christmas morning to see the Johnkannaus.\nWithout them, Christmas would be shorn of its greatest attraction. They\nconsist of companies of slaves from the plantations, generally of the lower\nclass. Two athletic men, in calico wrappers, have a net thrown over them,\ncovered with all manner of bright-colored stripes. Cows' tails are fastened\nto their backs, and their heads are decorated with horns. A box, covered\nwith sheepskin, is called the gumbo box. A dozen beat on this, while other\nstrike triangles and jawbones, to which bands of dancers keep time. For a\nmonth previous they are composing songs, which are sung on this occasion.\nThese companies, of a hundred each, turn out early in the morning, and are\nallowed to go round till twelve o'clock, begging for contributions. Not a\ndoor is left unvisited where there is the least chance of obtaining a penny\nor a glass of rum. They do not drink while they are out, but carry the rum\nhome in jugs, to have a carousal. These Christmas donations frequently\namount to twenty or thirty dollars. It is seldom that any white man or\nchild refuses to give them a trifle. If he does, they regale his ears with\nthe following song:--\n\n   Poor massa, so dey say;\n   Down in de heel, so dey say;\n   Got no money, so dey say;\n   Not one shillin, so dey say;\n   God A'mighty bress you, so dey say.\n\nChristmas is a day of feasting, both with white and colored people. Slaves,\nwho are lucky enough to have a few shillings, are sure to spend them for\ngood eating; and many a turkey and pig is captured, without saying, \"By\nyour leave, sir.\" Those who cannot obtain these, cook a 'possum, or a\nraccoon, from which savory dishes can be made. My grandmother raised\npoultry and pigs for sale and it was her established custom to have both a\nturkey and a pig roasted for Christmas dinner.\n\nOn this occasion, I was warned to keep extremely quiet, because two guests\nhad been invited. One was the town constable, and the other was a free\ncolored man, who tried to pass himself off for white, and who was always\nready to do any mean work for the sake of currying favor with white people.\nMy grandmother had a motive for inviting them. She managed to take them all\nover the house. All the rooms on the lower floor were thrown open for them\nto pass in and out; and after dinner, they were invited up stairs to look\nat a fine mocking bird my uncle had just brought home. There, too, the\nrooms were all thrown open that they might look in. When I heard them\ntalking on the piazza, my heart almost stood still. I knew this colored man\nhad spent many nights hunting for me. Every body knew he had the blood of a\nslave father in his veins; but for the sake of passing himself off for\nwhite, he was ready to kiss the slaveholders' feet. How I despised him! As\nfor the constable, he wore no false colors. The duties of his office were\ndespicable, but he was superior to his companion, inasmuch as he did not\npretend to be what he was not. Any white man, who could raise money enough\nto buy a slave, would have considered himself degraded by being a\nconstable; but the office enabled its possessor to exercise authority. If\nhe found any slave out after nine o'clock, he could whip him as much as he\nliked; and that was a privilege to be coveted. When the guests were ready\nto depart, my grandmother gave each of them some of her nice pudding, as a\npresent for their wives. Through my peep-hole I saw them go out of the\ngate, and I was glad when it closed after them. So passed the first\nChristmas in my den.\n\n\n\nXXIII. Still In Prison.\n\n\nWhen spring returned, and I took in the little patch of green the aperture\ncommanded, I asked myself how many more summers and winters I must be\ncondemned to spend thus. I longed to draw in a plentiful draught of fresh\nair, to stretch my cramped limbs, to have room to stand erect, to feel the\nearth under my feet again. My relatives were constantly on the lookout for\na chance of escape; but none offered that seemed practicable, and even\ntolerably safe. The hot summer came again, and made the turpentine drop\nfrom the thin roof over my head.\n\nDuring the long nights I was restless for want of air, and I had no room to\ntoss and turn. There was but one compensation; the atmosphere was so\nstifled that even mosquitos would not condescend to buzz in it. With all my\ndetestation of Dr. Flint, I could hardly wish him a worse punishment,\neither in this world or that which is to come, than to suffer what I\nsuffered in one single summer. Yet the laws allowed _him_ to be out in the\nfree air, while I, guiltless of crime, was pent up here, as the only means\nof avoiding the cruelties the laws allowed him to inflict upon me! I don't\nknow what kept life within me. Again and again, I thought I should die\nbefore long; but I saw the leaves of another autumn whirl through the air,\nand felt the touch of another winter. In summer the most terrible thunder\nstorms were acceptable, for the rain came through the roof, and I rolled up\nmy bed that it might cool the hot boards under it. Later in the season,\nstorms sometimes wet my clothes through and through, and that was not\ncomfortable when the air grew chilly. Moderate storms I could keep out by\nfilling the chinks with oakum.\n\nBut uncomfortable as my situation was, I had glimpses of things out of\ndoors, which made me thankful for my wretched hiding-place. One day I saw a\nslave pass our gate, muttering, \"It's his own, and he can kill it if he\nwill.\" My grandmother told me that woman's history. Her mistress had that\nday seen her baby for the first time, and in the lineaments of its fair\nface she saw a likeness to her husband. She turned the bondwoman and her\nchild out of doors, and forbade her ever to return. The slave went to her\nmaster, and told him what had happened. He promised to talk with her\nmistress, and make it all right. The next day she and her baby were sold to\na Georgia trader.\n\nAnother time I saw a woman rush wildly by, pursued by two men. She was a\nslave, the wet nurse of her mistress's children. For some trifling offence\nher mistress ordered her to be stripped and whipped. To escape the\ndegradation and the torture, she rushed to the river, jumped in, and ended\nher wrongs in death.\n\nSenator Brown, of Mississippi, could not be ignorant of many such facts as\nthese, for they are of frequent occurrence in every Southern State. Yet he\nstood up in the Congress of the United States, and declared that slavery\nwas \"a great moral, social, and political blessing; a blessing to the\nmaster, and a blessing to the slave!\"\n\nI suffered much more during the second winter than I did during the first.\nMy limbs were benumbed by inaction, and the cold filled them with cramp. I\nhad a very painful sensation of coldness in my head; even my face and\ntongue stiffened, and I lost the power of speech. Of course it was\nimpossible, under the circumstances, to summon any physician. My brother\nWilliam came and did all he could for me. Uncle Phillip also watched\ntenderly over me; and poor grandmother crept up and down to inquire whether\nthere were any signs of returning life. I was restored to consciousness by\nthe dashing of cold water in my face, and found myself leaning against my\nbrother's arm, while he bent over me with streaming eyes. He afterwards\ntold me he thought I was dying, for I had been in an unconscious state\nsixteen hours. I next became delirious, and was in great danger of\nbetraying myself and my friends. To prevent this, they stupefied me with\ndrugs. I remained in bed six weeks, weary in body and sick at heart. How to\nget medical advice was the question. William finally went to a Thompsonian\ndoctor, and described himself as having all my pains and aches. He returned\nwith herbs, roots, and ointment. He was especially charged to rub on the\nointment by a fire; but how could a fire be made in my little den? Charcoal\nin a furnace was tried, but there was no outlet for the gas, and it nearly\ncost me my life. Afterwards coals, already kindled, were brought up in an\niron pan, and placed on bricks. I was so weak, and it was so long since I\nhad enjoyed the warmth of a fire, that those few coals actually made me\nweep. I think the medicines did me some good; but my recovery was very\nslow. Dark thoughts passed through my mind as I lay there day after day. I\ntried to be thankful for my little cell, dismal as it was, and even to love\nit, as part of the price I had paid for the redemption of my children.\nSometimes I thought God was a compassionate Father, who would forgive my\nsins for the sake of my sufferings. At other times, it seemed to me there\nwas no justice or mercy in the divine government. I asked why the curse of\nslavery was permitted to exist, and why I had been so persecuted and\nwronged from youth upward. These things took the shape of mystery, which is\nto this day not so clear to my soul as I trust it will be hereafter.\n\nIn the midst of my illness, grandmother broke down under the weight and\nanxiety and toil. The idea of losing her, who had always been my best\nfriend and a mother to my children, was the sorest trial I had yet had. O,\nhow earnestly I prayed that she might recover! How hard it seemed, that I\ncould not tend upon her, who had so long and so tenderly watched over me!\n\nOne day the screams of a child nerved me with strength to crawl to my\npeeping-hole, and I saw my son covered with blood. A fierce dog, usually\nkept chained, had seized and bitten him. A doctor was sent for, and I heard\nthe groans and screams of my child while the wounds were being sewed up. O,\nwhat torture to a mother's heart, to listen to this and be unable to go to\nhim!\n\nBut childhood is like a day in spring, alternately shower and sunshine.\nBefore night Benny was bright and lively, threatening the destruction of\nthe dog; and great was his delight when the doctor told him the next day\nthat the dog had bitten another boy and been shot. Benny recovered from his\nwounds; but it was long before he could walk.\n\nWhen my grandmother's illness became known, many ladies, who were her\ncustomers, called to bring her some little comforts, and to inquire whether\nshe had every thing she wanted. Aunt Nancy one night asked permission to\nwatch with her sick mother, and Mrs. Flint replied, \"I don't see any need\nof your going. I can't spare you.\" But when she found other ladies in the\nneighborhood were so attentive, not wishing to be outdone in Christian\ncharity, she also sallied forth, in magnificent condescension, and stood by\nthe bedside of her who had loved her in her infancy, and who had been\nrepaid by such grievous wrongs. She seemed surprised to find her so ill,\nand scolded uncle Phillip for not sending for Dr. Flint. She herself sent\nfor him immediately, and he came. Secure as I was in my retreat, I should\nhave been terrified if I had known he was so near me. He pronounced my\ngrandmother in a very critical situation, and said if her attending\nphysician wished it, he would visit her. Nobody wished to have him coming\nto the house at all hours, and we were not disposed to give him a chance to\nmake out a long bill.\n\nAs Mrs. Flint went out, Sally told her the reason Benny was lame was, that\na dog had bitten him. \"I'm glad of it,\" replied she. \"I wish he had killed\nhim. It would be good news to send to his mother. _Her_ day will come. The\ndogs will grab _her_ yet.\" With these Christian words she and her husband\ndeparted, and, to my great satisfaction, returned no more.\n\nI learned from uncle Phillip, with feelings of unspeakable joy and\ngratitude, that the crisis was passed and grandmother would live. I could\nnow say from my heart, \"God is merciful. He has spared me the anguish of\nfeeling that I caused her death.\"\n\n\n\nXXIV. The Candidate For Congress.\n\n\nThe summer had nearly ended, when Dr. Flint made a third visit to New York,\nin search of me. Two candidates were running for Congress, and he returned\nin season to vote. The father of my children was the Whig candidate. The\ndoctor had hitherto been a stanch Whig; but now he exerted all his energies\nfor the defeat of Mr. Sands. He invited large parties of men to dine in the\nshade of his trees, and supplied them with plenty of rum and brandy. If any\npoor fellow drowned his wits in the bowl, and, in the openness of his\nconvivial heart, proclaimed that he did not mean to vote the Democratic\nticket, he was shoved into the street without ceremony.\n\nThe doctor expended his liquor in vain. Mr. Sands was elected; an event\nwhich occasioned me some anxious thoughts. He had not emancipated my\nchildren, and if he should die they would be at the mercy of his heirs. Two\nlittle voices, that frequently met my ear, seemed to plead with me not to\nlet their father depart without striving to make their freedom secure.\nYears had passed since I had spoken to him. I had not even seen him since\nthe night I passed him, unrecognized, in my disguise of a sailor. I\nsupposed he would call before he left, to say something to my grandmother\nconcerning the children, and I resolved what course to take.\n\nThe day before his departure for Washington I made arrangements, toward\nevening, to get from my hiding-place into the storeroom below. I found\nmyself so stiff and clumsy that it was with great difficulty I could hitch\nfrom one resting place to another. When I reached the storeroom my ankles\ngave way under me, and I sank exhausted on the floor. It seemed as if I\ncould never use my limbs again. But the purpose I had in view roused all\nthe strength I had. I crawled on my hands and knees to the window, and,\nscreened behind a barrel, I waited for his coming. The clock struck nine,\nand I knew the steamboat would leave between ten and eleven. My hopes were\nfailing. But presently I heard his voice, saying to some one, \"Wait for me\na moment. I wish to see aunt Martha.\" When he came out, as he passed the\nwindow, I said, \"Stop one moment, and let me speak for my children.\" He\nstarted, hesitated, and then passed on, and went out of the gate. I closed\nthe shutter I had partially opened, and sank down behind the barrel. I had\nsuffered much; but seldom had I experienced a keener pang than I then felt.\nHad my children, then, become of so little consequence to him? And had he\nso little feeling for their wretched mother that he would not listen a\nmoment while she pleaded for them? Painful memories were so busy within me,\nthat I forgot I had not hooked the shutter, till I heard some one opening\nit. I looked up. He had come back. \"Who called me?\" said he, in a low tone.\n\"I did,\" I replied. \"Oh, Linda,\" said he, \"I knew your voice; but I was\nafraid to answer, lest my friend should hear me. Why do you come here? Is\nit possible you risk yourself in this house? They are mad to allow it. I\nshall expect to hear that you are all ruined,\" I did not wish to implicate\nhim, by letting him know my place of concealment; so I merely said, \"I\nthought you would come to bid grandmother good by, and so I came here to\nspeak a few words to you about emancipating my children. Many changes may\ntake place during the six months you are gone to Washington, and it does\nnot seem right for you to expose them to the risk of such changes. I want\nnothing for myself; all I ask is, that you will free my children, or\nauthorize some friend to do it, before you go.\"\n\nHe promised he would do it, and also expressed a readiness; to make any\narrangements whereby I could be purchased.\n\nI heard footsteps approaching, and closed the shutter hastily. I wanted to\ncrawl back to my den, without letting the family know what I had done; for\nI knew they would deem it very imprudent. But he stepped back into the\nhouse, to tell my grandmother that he had spoken with me at the storeroom\nwindow, and to beg of her not to allow me to remain in the house over night.\nHe said it was the height of madness for me to be there; that we should\ncertainly all be ruined. Luckily, he was in too much of a hurry to wait for\na reply, or the dear old woman would surely have told him all.\n\nI tried to go back to my den, but found it more difficult to go up than I\nhad to come down. Now that my mission was fulfilled, the little strength\nthat had supported me through it was gone, and I sank helpless on the\nfloor. My grandmother, alarmed at the risk I had run, came into the\nstoreroom in the dark, and locked the door behind her. \"Linda,\" she\nwhispered, \"where are you?\"\n\n\"I am here by the window,\" I replied. \"I _couldn't_ have him go away\nwithout emancipating the children. Who knows what may happen?\"\n\n\"Come, come, child,\" said she, \"it won't do for you to stay here another\nminute. You've done wrong; but I can't blame you, poor thing!\" I told her\nI could not return without assistance, and she must call my uncle. Uncle\nPhillip came, and pity prevented him from scolding me. He carried me back\nto my dungeon, laid me tenderly on the bed, gave me some medicine, and\nasked me if there was any thing more he could do. Then he went away, and I\nwas left with my own thoughts--starless as the midnight darkness around me.\n\nMy friends feared I should become a cripple for life; and I was so weary of\nmy long imprisonment that, had it not been for the hope of serving my\nchildren, I should have been thankful to die; but, for their sakes, I was\nwilling to bear on.\n\n\n\nXXV. Competition In Cunning.\n\n\nDr. Flint had not given me up. Every now and then he would say to my\ngrandmother that I would yet come back, and voluntarily surrender myself;\nand that when I did, I could be purchased by my relatives, or any one who\nwished to buy me. I knew his cunning nature too well not to perceive that\nthis was a trap laid for me; and so all my friends understood it. I\nresolved to match my cunning against his cunning. In order to make him\nbelieve that I was in New York, I resolved to write him a letter dated from\nthat place. I sent for my friend Peter, and asked him if he knew any\ntrustworthy seafaring person, who would carry such a letter to New York,\nand put it in the post office there. He said he knew one that he would\ntrust with his own life to the ends of the world. I reminded him that it\nwas a hazardous thing for him to undertake. He said he knew it, but he was\nwilling to do any thing to help me. I expressed a wish for a New York\npaper, to ascertain the names of some of the streets. He run his hand into\nhis pocket, and said, \"Here is half a one, that was round a cap I bought of\na pedler yesterday.\" I told him the letter would be ready the next evening.\nHe bade me good by, adding, \"Keep up your spirits, Linda; brighter days\nwill come by and by.\"\n\nMy uncle Phillip kept watch over the gate until our brief interview was\nover. Early the next morning, I seated myself near the little aperture to\nexamine the newspaper. It was a piece of the New York Herald; and, for\nonce, the paper that systematically abuses the colored people, was made to\nrender them a service. Having obtained what information I wanted concerning\nstreets and numbers, I wrote two letters, one to my grandmother, the other\nto Dr. Flint. I reminded him how he, a gray-headed man, had treated a\nhelpless child, who had been placed in his power, and what years of misery\nhe had brought upon her. To my grandmother, I expressed a wish to have my\nchildren sent to me at the north, where I could teach them to respect\nthemselves, and set them a virtuous example; which a slave mother was not\nallowed to do at the south. I asked her to direct her answer to a certain\nstreet in Boston, as I did not live in New York, though I went there\nsometimes. I dated these letters ahead, to allow for the time it would take\nto carry them, and sent a memorandum of the date to the messenger. When my\nfriend came for the letters, I said, \"God bless and reward you, Peter, for\nthis disinterested kindness. Pray be careful. If you are detected, both you\nand I will have to suffer dreadfully. I have not a relative who would dare\nto do it for me.\" He replied, \"You may trust to me, Linda. I don't forget\nthat your father was my best friend, and I will be a friend to his children\nso long as God lets me live.\"\n\nIt was necessary to tell my grandmother what I had done, in order that she\nmight be ready for the letter, and prepared to hear what Dr. Flint might\nsay about my being at the north. She was sadly troubled. She felt sure\nmischief would come of it. I also told my plan to aunt Nancy, in order that\nshe might report to us what was said at Dr. Flint's house. I whispered it\nto her through a crack, and she whispered back, \"I hope it will succeed. I\nshan't mind being a slave all _my_ life, if I can only see you and the\nchildren free.\"\n\nI had directed that my letters should be put into the New York post office\non the 20th of the month. On the evening of the 24th my aunt came to say\nthat Dr. Flint and his wife had been talking in a low voice about a letter\nhe had received, and that when he went to his office he promised to bring\nit when he came to tea. So I concluded I should hear my letter read the\nnext morning. I told my grandmother Dr. Flint would be sure to come, and\nasked her to have him sit near a certain door, and leave it open, that I\nmight hear what he said. The next morning I took my station within sound of\nthat door, and remained motionless as a statue. It was not long before I\nheard the gate slam, and the well-known footsteps enter the house. He\nseated himself in the chair that was placed for him, and said, \"Well,\nMartha, I've brought you a letter from Linda. She has sent me a letter,\nalso. I know exactly where to find her; but I don't choose to go to Boston\nfor her. I had rather she would come back of her own accord, in a\nrespectable manner. Her uncle Phillip is the best person to go for her.\nWith _him_, she would feel perfectly free to act. I am willing to pay his\nexpenses going and returning. She shall be sold to her friends. Her\nchildren are free; at least I suppose they are; and when you obtain her\nfreedom, you'll make a happy family. I suppose, Martha, you have no\nobjection to my reading to you the letter Linda has written to you.\"\n\nHe broke the seal, and I heard him read it. The old villain! He had\nsuppressed the letter I wrote to grandmother, and prepared a substitute of\nhis own, the purport of which was as follows:--\n\n   Dear Grandmother: I have long wanted to write to you; but the\n   disgraceful manner in which I left you and my children made me\n   ashamed to do it. If you knew how much I have suffered since I\n   ran away, you would pity and forgive me. I have purchased freedom\n   at a dear rate. If any arrangement could be made for me to return\n   to the south without being a slave, I would gladly come. If not,\n   I beg of you to send my children to the north. I cannot live any\n   longer without them. Let me know in time, and I will meet them in\n   New York or Philadelphia, whichever place best suits my uncle's\n   convenience. Write as soon as possible to your unhappy daughter,\n\n   Linda.\n\n\"It is very much as I expected it would be,\" said the old hypocrite, rising\nto go. \"You see the foolish girl has repented of her rashness, and wants to\nreturn. We must help her to do it, Martha. Talk with Phillip about it. If\nhe will go for her, she will trust to him, and come back. I should like an\nanswer to-morrow. Good morning, Martha.\"\n\nAs he stepped out on the piazza, he stumbled over my little girl. \"Ah,\nEllen, is that you?\" he said, in his most gracious manner. \"I didn't see\nyou. How do you do?\"\n\n\"Pretty well, sir,\" she replied. \"I heard you tell grandmother that my\nmother is coming home. I want to see her.\"\n\n\"Yes, Ellen, I am going to bring her home very soon,\" rejoined he; \"and you\nshall see her as much as you like, you little curly-headed nigger.\"\n\nThis was as good as a comedy to me, who had heard it all; but grandmother\nwas frightened and distressed, because the doctor wanted my uncle to go for\nme.\n\nThe next evening Dr. Flint called to talk the matter over. My uncle told\nhim that from what he had heard of Massachusetts, he judged he should be\nmobbed if he went there after a runaway slave. \"All stuff and nonsense,\nPhillip!\" replied the doctor. \"Do you suppose I want you to kick up a row\nin Boston? The business can all be done quietly. Linda writes that she\nwants to come back. You are her relative, and she would trust _you_. The\ncase would be different if I went. She might object to coming with _me_;\nand the damned abolitionists, if they knew I was her master, would not\nbelieve me, if I told them she had begged to go back. They would get up a\nrow; and I should not like to see Linda dragged through the streets like a\ncommon negro. She has been very ungrateful to me for all my kindness; but I\nforgive her, and want to act the part of a friend towards her. I have no\nwish to hold her as my slave. Her friends can buy her as soon as she\narrives here.\"\n\nFinding that his arguments failed to convince my uncle, the doctor \"let the\ncat out of the bag,\" by saying that he had written to the mayor of Boston,\nto ascertain whether there was a person of my description at the street and\nnumber from which my letter was dated. He had omitted this date in the\nletter he had made up to read to my grandmother. If I had dated from New\nYork, the old man would probably have made another journey to that city.\nBut even in that dark region, where knowledge is so carefully excluded from\nthe slave, I had heard enough about Massachusetts to come to the conclusion\nthat slaveholders did not consider it a comfortable place to go in search\nof a runaway. That was before the Fugitive Slave Law was passed; before\nMassachusetts had consented to become a \"nigger hunter\" for the south.\n\nMy grandmother, who had become skittish by seeing her family always in\ndanger, came to me with a very distressed countenance, and said, \"What will\nyou do if the mayor of Boston sends him word that you haven't been there?\nThen he will suspect the letter was a trick; and maybe he'll find out\nsomething about it, and we shall all get into trouble. O Linda, I wish you\nhad never sent the letters.\"\n\n\"Don't worry yourself, Grandmother,\" said I. \"The mayor of Boston won't\ntrouble himself to hunt niggers for Dr. Flint. The letters will do good in\nthe end. I shall get out of this dark hole some time or other.\"\n\n\"I hope you will, child,\" replied the good, patient old friend. \"You have\nbeen here a long time; almost five years; but whenever you do go, it will\nbreak your old grandmother's heart. I should be expecting every day to hear\nthat you were brought back in irons and put in jail. God help you, poor\nchild! Let us be thankful that some time or other we shall go 'where the\nwicked cease from troubling, and the weary are at rest.'\" My heart\nresponded, Amen.\n\nThe fact that Dr. Flint had written to the mayor of Boston convinced me\nthat he believed my letter to be genuine, and of course that he had no\nsuspicion of my being any where in the vicinity. It was a great object to\nkeep up this delusion, for it made me and my friends feel less anxious, and\nit would be very convenient whenever there was a chance to escape. I\nresolved, therefore, to continue to write letters from the north from time\nto time.\n\nTwo or three weeks passed, and as no news came from the mayor of Boston,\ngrandmother began to listen to my entreaty to be allowed to leave my cell,\nsometimes, and exercise my limbs to prevent my becoming a cripple. I was\nallowed to slip down into the small storeroom, early in the morning, and\nremain there a little while. The room was all filled up with barrels,\nexcept a small open space under my trap-door. This faced the door, the\nupper part of which was of glass, and purposely left uncurtained, that the\ncurious might look in. The air of this place was close; but it was so much\nbetter than the atmosphere of my cell, that I dreaded to return. I came\ndown as soon as it was light, and remained till eight o'clock, when people\nbegan to be about, and there was danger that some one might come on the\npiazza. I had tried various applications to bring warmth and feeling into\nmy limbs, but without avail. They were so numb and stiff that it was a\npainful effort to move; and had my enemies come upon me during the first\nmornings I tried to exercise them a little in the small unoccupied space of\nthe storeroom, it would have been impossible for me to have escaped.\n\n\n\nXXVI. Important Era In My Brother's Life.\n\nI missed the company and kind attentions of my brother William, who had\ngone to Washington with his master, Mr. Sands. We received several letters\nfrom him, written without any allusion to me, but expressed in such a\nmanner that I knew he did not forget me. I disguised my hand, and wrote to\nhim in the same manner. It was a long session; and when it closed, William\nwrote to inform us that Mr. Sands was going to the north, to be gone some\ntime, and that he was to accompany him. I knew that his master had promised\nto give him his freedom, but no time had been specified. Would William\ntrust to a slave's chances? I remembered how we used to talk together, in\nour young days, about obtaining our freedom, and I thought it very doubtful\nwhether he would come back to us.\n\nGrandmother received a letter from Mr. Sands, saying that William had\nproved a most faithful servant, and he would also say a valued friend; that\nno mother had ever trained a better boy. He said he had travelled through\nthe Northern States and Canada; and though the abolitionists had tried to\ndecoy him away, they had never succeeded. He ended by saying they should be\nat home shortly.\n\nWe expected letters from William, describing the novelties of his journey,\nbut none came. In time, it was reported that Mr. Sands would return late in\nthe autumn, accompanied by a bride. Still no letters from William. I felt\nalmost sure I should never see him again on southern soil; but had he no\nword of comfort to send to his friends at home? to the poor captive in her\ndungeon? My thoughts wandered through the dark past, and over the uncertain\nfuture. Alone in my cell, where no eye but God's could see me, I wept\nbitter tears. How earnestly I prayed to him to restore me to my children,\nand enable me to be a useful woman and a good mother!\n\nAt last the day arrived for the return of the travellers. Grandmother had\nmade loving preparations to welcome her absent boy back to the old\nhearthstone. When the dinner table was laid, William's place occupied its\nold place. The stage coach went by empty. My grandmother waited dinner. She\nthought perhaps he was necessarily detained by his master. In my prison I\nlistened anxiously, expecting every moment to hear my dear brother's voice\nand step. In the course of the afternoon a lad was sent by Mr. Sands to\ntell grandmother that William did not return with him; that the\nabolitionists had decoyed him away. But he begged her not to feel troubled\nabout it, for he felt confident she would see William in a few days. As\nsoon as he had time to reflect he would come back, for he could never\nexpect to be so well off at the north as he had been with him.\n\nIf you had seen the tears, and heard the sobs, you would have thought the\nmessenger had brought tidings of death instead of freedom. Poor old\ngrandmother felt that she should never see her darling boy again. And I was\nselfish. I thought more of what I had lost, than of what my brother had\ngained. A new anxiety began to trouble me. Mr. Sands had expended a good\ndeal of money, and would naturally feel irritated by the loss he had\nincurred. I greatly feared this might injure the prospects of my children,\nwho were now becoming valuable property. I longed to have their\nemancipation made certain. The more so, because their master and father was\nnow married. I was too familiar with slavery not to know that promises made\nto slaves, though with kind intentions, and sincere at the time, depend\nupon many contingencies for their fulfillment.\n\nMuch as I wished William to be free, the step he had taken made me sad and\nanxious. The following Sabbath was calm and clear; so beautiful that it\nseemed like a Sabbath in the eternal world. My grandmother brought the\nchildren out on the piazza, that I might hear their voices. She thought it\nwould comfort me in my despondency; and it did. They chatted merrily, as\nonly children can. Benny said, \"Grandmother, do you think uncle Will has\ngone for good? Won't he ever come back again? May be he'll find mother. If\nhe does, _won't_ she be glad to see him! Why don't you and uncle Phillip,\nand all of us, go and live where mother is? I should like it; wouldn't you,\nEllen?\"\n\n\"Yes, I should like it,\" replied Ellen; \"but how could we find her? Do you\nknow the place, grandmother? I don't remember how mother looked--do you,\nBenny?\"\n\nBenny was just beginning to describe me when they were interrupted by an\nold slave woman, a near neighbor, named Aggie. This poor creature had\nwitnessed the sale of her children, and seen them carried off to parts\nunknown, without any hopes of ever hearing from them again. She saw that my\ngrandmother had been weeping, and she said, in a sympathizing tone, \"What's\nthe matter, aunt Marthy?\"\n\n\"O Aggie,\" she replied, \"it seems as if I shouldn't have any of my children\nor grandchildren left to hand me a drink when I'm dying, and lay my old\nbody in the ground. My boy didn't come back with Mr. Sands. He staid at the\nnorth.\"\n\nPoor old Aggie clapped her hands for joy. \"Is _dat_ what you's crying fur?\"\nshe exclaimed. \"Git down on your knees and bress de Lord! I don't know whar\nmy poor chillern is, and I nebber 'spect to know. You don't know whar poor\nLinda's gone to; but you _do_ know whar her brudder is. He's in free parts;\nand dat's de right place. Don't murmur at de Lord's doings but git down on\nyour knees and tank him for his goodness.\"\n\nMy selfishness was rebuked by what poor Aggie said. She rejoiced over the\nescape of one who was merely her fellow-bondman, while his own sister was\nonly thinking what his good fortune might cost her children. I knelt and\nprayed God to forgive me; and I thanked him from my heart, that one of my\nfamily was saved from the grasp of slavery.\n\nIt was not long before we received a letter from William. He wrote that Mr.\nSands had always treated him kindly, and that he had tried to do his duty\nto him faithfully. But ever since he was a boy, he had longed to be free;\nand he had already gone through enough to convince him he had better not\nlose the chance that offered. He concluded by saying, \"Don't worry about\nme, dear grandmother. I shall think of you always; and it will spur me on\nto work hard and try to do right. When I have earned money enough to give\nyou a home, perhaps you will come to the north, and we can all live happy\ntogether.\"\n\nMr. Sands told my uncle Phillip the particulars about William's leaving\nhim. He said, \"I trusted him as if he were my own brother, and treated him\nas kindly. The abolitionists talked to him in several places; but I had no\nidea they could tempt him. However, I don't blame William. He's young and\ninconsiderate, and those Northern rascals decoyed him. I must confess the\nscamp was very bold about it. I met him coming down the steps of the Astor\nHouse with his trunk on his shoulder, and I asked him where he was going.\nHe said he was going to change his old trunk. I told him it was rather\nshabby, and asked if he didn't need some money. He said, No, thanked me,\nand went off. He did not return so soon as I expected; but I waited\npatiently. At last I went to see if our trunks were packed, ready for our\njourney. I found them locked, and a sealed note on the table informed me\nwhere I could find the keys. The fellow even tried to be religious. He\nwrote that he hoped God would always bless me, and reward me for my\nkindness; that he was not unwilling to serve me; but he wanted to be a free\nman; and that if I thought he did wrong, he hoped I would forgive him. I\nintended to give him his freedom in five years. He might have trusted me.\nHe has shown himself ungrateful; but I shall not go for him, or send for\nhim. I feel confident that he will soon return to me.\"\n\nI afterwards heard an account of the affair from William himself. He had\nnot been urged away by abolitionists. He needed no information they could\ngive him about slavery to stimulate his desire for freedom. He looked at\nhis hands, and remembered that they were once in irons. What security had\nhe that they would not be so again? Mr. Sands was kind to him; but he might\nindefinitely postpone the promise he had made to give him his freedom. He\nmight come under pecuniary embarrassments, and his property be seized by\ncreditors; or he might die, without making any arrangements in his favor.\nHe had too often known such accidents to happen to slaves who had kind\nmasters, and he wisely resolved to make sure of the present opportunity to\nown himself. He was scrupulous about taking any money from his master on\nfalse pretences; so he sold his best clothes to pay for his passage to\nBoston. The slaveholders pronounced him a base, ungrateful wretch, for thus\nrequiting his master's indulgence. What would _they_ have done under\nsimilar circumstances?\n\nWhen Dr. Flint's family heard that William had deserted Mr. Sands, they\nchuckled greatly over the news. Mrs. Flint made her usual manifestations of\nChristian feeling, by saying, \"I'm glad of it. I hope he'll never get him\nagain. I like to see people paid back in their own coin. I reckon Linda's\nchildren will have to pay for it. I should be glad to see them in the\nspeculator's hands again, for I'm tired of seeing those little niggers\nmarch about the streets.\"\n\n\n\nXXVII. New Destination For The Children.\n\n\nMrs. Flint proclaimed her intention of informing Mrs. Sands who was the\nfather of my children. She likewise proposed to tell her what an artful\ndevil I was; that I had made a great deal of trouble in her family; that\nwhen Mr. Sands was at the north, she didn't doubt I had followed him in\ndisguise, and persuaded William to run away. She had some reason to\nentertain such an idea; for I had written from the north, from time to\ntime, and I dated my letters from various places. Many of them fell into\nDr. Flint's hands, as I expected they would; and he must have come to the\nconclusion that I travelled about a good deal. He kept a close watch over\nmy children, thinking they would eventually lead to my detection.\n\nA new and unexpected trial was in store for me. One day, when Mr. Sands and\nhis wife were walking in the street, they met Benny. The lady took a fancy\nto him, and exclaimed, \"What a pretty little negro! Whom does he belong\nto?\"\n\nBenny did not hear the answer; but he came home very indignant with the\nstranger lady, because she had called him a negro. A few days afterwards,\nMr. Sands called on my grandmother, and told her he wanted her to take the\nchildren to his house. He said he had informed his wife of his relation to\nthem, and told her they were motherless; and she wanted to see them.\n\nWhen he had gone, my grandmother came and asked what I would do. The\nquestion seemed a mockery. What _could_ I do? They were Mr. Sands's slaves,\nand their mother was a slave, whom he had represented to be dead. Perhaps\nhe thought I was. I was too much pained and puzzled to come to any\ndecision; and the children were carried without my knowledge. Mrs. Sands\nhad a sister from Illinois staying with her. This lady, who had no children\nof her own, was so much pleased with Ellen, that she offered to adopt her,\nand bring her up as she would a daughter. Mrs. Sands wanted to take\nBenjamin. When grandmother reported this to me, I was tried almost beyond\nendurance. Was this all I was to gain by what I had suffered for the sake\nof having my children free? True, the prospect _seemed_ fair; but I knew\ntoo well how lightly slaveholders held such \"parental relations.\" If\npecuniary troubles should come, or if the new wife required more money than\ncould conveniently be spared, my children might be thought of as a\nconvenient means of raising funds. I had no trust in thee, O Slavery! Never\nshould I know peace till my children were emancipated with all due\nformalities of law.\n\nI was too proud to ask Mr. Sands to do any thing for my own benefit; but I\ncould bring myself to become a supplicant for my children. I resolved to\nremind him of the promise he had made me, and to throw myself upon his\nhonor for the performance of it. I persuaded my grandmother to go to him,\nand tell him I was not dead, and that I earnestly entreated him to keep the\npromise he had made me; that I had heard of the recent proposals concerning\nmy children, and did not feel easy to accept them; that he had promised to\nemancipate them, and it was time for him to redeem his pledge. I knew there\nwas some risk in thus betraying that I was in the vicinity; but what will\nnot a mother do for her children? He received the message with surprise,\nand said, \"The children are free. I have never intended to claim them as\nslaves. Linda may decide their fate. In my opinion, they had better be sent\nto the north. I don't think they are quite safe here. Dr. Flint boasts that\nthey are still in his power. He says they were his daughter's property, and\nas she was not of age when they were sold, the contract is not legally\nbinding.\"\n\nSo, then, after all I had endured for their sakes, my poor children were\nbetween two fires; between my old master and their new master! And I was\npowerless. There was no protecting arm of the law for me to invoke. Mr.\nSands proposed that Ellen should go, for the present, to some of his\nrelatives, who had removed to Brooklyn, Long Island. It was promised that\nshe should be well taken care of, and sent to school. I consented to it, as\nthe best arrangement I could make for her. My grandmother, of course,\nnegotiated it all; and Mrs. Sands knew of no other person in the\ntransaction. She proposed that they should take Ellen with them to\nWashington, and keep her till they had a good chance of sending her, with\nfriends, to Brooklyn. She had an infant daughter. I had had a glimpse of\nit, as the nurse passed with it in her arms. It was not a pleasant thought\nto me, that the bondwoman's child should tend her free-born sister; but\nthere was no alternative. Ellen was made ready for the journey. O, how it\ntried my heart to send her away, so young, alone, among strangers! Without\na mother's love to shelter her from the storms of life; almost without\nmemory of a mother! I doubted whether she and Benny would have for me the\nnatural affection that children feel for a parent. I thought to myself that\nI might perhaps never see my daughter again, and I had a great desire that\nshe should look upon me, before she went, that she might take my image with\nher in her memory. It seemed to me cruel to have her brought to my dungeon.\nIt was sorrow enough for her young heart to know that her mother was a\nvictim of slavery, without seeing the wretched hiding-place to which it had\ndriven her. I begged permission to pass the last night in one of the open\nchambers, with my little girl. They thought I was crazy to think of\ntrusting such a young child with my perilous secret. I told them I had\nwatched her character, and I felt sure she would not betray me; that I was\ndetermined to have an interview, and if they would not facilitate it, I\nwould take my own way to obtain it. They remonstrated against the rashness\nof such a proceeding; but finding they could not change my purpose, they\nyielded. I slipped through the trap-door into the storeroom, and my uncle\nkept watch at the gate, while I passed into the piazza and went up stairs,\nto the room I used to occupy. It was more than five years since I had seen\nit; and how the memories crowded on me! There I had taken shelter when my\nmistress drove me from her house; there came my old tyrant, to mock,\ninsult, and curse me; there my children were first laid in my arms; there I\nhad watched over them, each day with a deeper and sadder love; there I had\nknelt to God, in anguish of heart, to forgive the wrong I had done. How\nvividly it all came back! And after this long, gloomy interval, I stood\nthere such a wreck!\n\nIn the midst of these meditations, I heard footsteps on the stairs. The\ndoor opened, and my uncle Phillip came in, leading Ellen by the hand. I put\nmy arms round her, and said, \"Ellen, my dear child, I am your mother.\" She\ndrew back a little, and looked at me; then, with sweet confidence, she laid\nher cheek against mine, and I folded her to the heart that had been so long\ndesolated. She was the first to speak. Raising her head, she said,\ninquiringly, \"You really _are_ my mother?\" I told her I really was; that\nduring all the long time she had not seen me, I had loved her most\ntenderly; and that now she was going away, I wanted to see her and talk\nwith her, that she might remember me. With a sob in her voice, she said,\n\"I'm glad you've come to see me; but why didn't you ever come before? Benny\nand I have wanted so much to see you! He remembers you, and sometimes he\ntells me about you. Why didn't you come home when Dr. Flint went to bring\nyou?\"\n\nI answered, \"I couldn't come before, dear. But now that I am with you, tell\nme whether you like to go away.\" \"I don't know,\" said she, crying.\n\"Grandmother says I ought not to cry; that I am going to a good place,\nwhere I can learn to read and write, and that by and by I can write her a\nletter. But I shan't have Benny, or grandmother, or uncle Phillip, or any\nbody to love me. Can't you go with me? O, _do_ go, dear mother!\"\n\nI told her I couldn't go now; but sometime I would come to her, and then\nshe and Benny and I would live together, and have happy times. She wanted\nto run and bring Benny to see me now. I told her he was going to the north,\nbefore long, with uncle Phillip, and then I would come to see him before he\nwent away. I asked if she would like to have me stay all night and sleep\nwith her. \"O, yes,\" she replied. Then, turning to her uncle, she said,\npleadingly, \"_May_ I stay? Please, uncle! She is my own mother.\" He laid\nhis hand on her head, and said, solemnly, \"Ellen, this is the secret you\nhave promised grandmother never to tell. If you ever speak of it to any\nbody, they will never let you see your grandmother again, and your mother\ncan never come to Brooklyn.\" \"Uncle,\" she replied, \"I will never tell.\" He\ntold her she might stay with me; and when he had gone, I took her in my\narms and told her I was a slave, and that was the reason she must never say\nshe had seen me. I exhorted her to be a good child, to try to please the\npeople where she was going, and that God would raise her up friends. I told\nher to say her prayers, and remember always to pray for her poor mother,\nand that God would permit us to meet again. She wept, and I did not check\nher tears. Perhaps she would never again have a chance to pour her tears\ninto a mother's bosom. All night she nestled in my arms, and I had no\ninclination to slumber. The moments were too precious to lose any of them.\nOnce, when I thought she was asleep, I kissed her forehead softly, and she\nsaid, \"I am not asleep, dear mother.\"\n\nBefore dawn they came to take me back to my den. I drew aside the window\ncurtain, to take a last look of my child. The moonlight shone on her face,\nand I bent over her, as I had done years before, that wretched night when I\nran away. I hugged her close to my throbbing heart; and tears, too sad for\nsuch young eyes to shed, flowed down her cheeks, as she gave her last kiss,\nand whispered in my ear, \"Mother, I will never tell.\" And she never did.\n\nWhen I got back to my den, I threw myself on the bed and wept there alone\nin the darkness. It seemed as if my heart would burst. When the time for\nEllen's departure drew nigh, I could hear neighbors and friends saying to\nher, \"Good by, Ellen. I hope your poor mother will find you out. _Won't_\nyou be glad to see her!\" She replied, \"Yes, ma'am;\" and they little dreamed\nof the weighty secret that weighed down her young heart. She was an\naffectionate child, but naturally very reserved, except with those she\nloved, and I felt secure that my secret would be safe with her. I heard the\ngate close after her, with such feelings as only a slave mother can\nexperience. During the day my meditations were very sad. Sometimes I feared\nI had been very selfish not to give up all claim to her, and let her go to\nIllinois, to be adopted by Mrs. Sands's sister. It was my experience of\nslavery that decided me against it. I feared that circumstances might arise\nthat would cause her to be sent back. I felt confident that I should go to\nNew York myself; and then I should be able to watch over her, and in some\ndegree protect her.\n\nDr. Flint's family knew nothing of the proposed arrangement till after\nEllen was gone, and the news displeased them greatly. Mrs. Flint called on\nMrs. Sands's sister to inquire into the matter. She expressed her opinion\nvery freely as to the respect Mr. Sands showed for his wife, and for his\nown character, in acknowledging those \"young niggers.\" And as for sending\nEllen away, she pronounced it to be just as much stealing as it would be\nfor him to come and take a piece of furniture out of her parlor. She said\nher daughter was not of age to sign the bill of sale, and the children were\nher property; and when she became of age, or was married, she could take\nthem, wherever she could lay hands on them.\n\nMiss Emily Flint, the little girl to whom I had been bequeathed, was now in\nher sixteenth year. Her mother considered it all right and honorable for\nher, or her future husband, to steal my children; but she did not\nunderstand how any body could hold up their heads in respectable society,\nafter they had purchased their own children, as Mr. Sands had done. Dr.\nFlint said very little. Perhaps he thought that Benny would be less likely\nto be sent away if he kept quiet. One of my letters, that fell into his\nhands, was dated from Canada; and he seldom spoke of me now. This state of\nthings enabled me to slip down into the storeroom more frequently, where I\ncould stand upright, and move my limbs more freely.\n\nDays, weeks, and months passed, and there came no news of Ellen. I sent a\nletter to Brooklyn, written in my grandmother's name, to inquire whether\nshe had arrived there. Answer was returned that she had not. I wrote to her\nin Washington; but no notice was taken of it. There was one person there,\nwho ought to have had some sympathy with the anxiety of the child's friends\nat home; but the links of such relations as he had formed with me, are\neasily broken and cast away as rubbish. Yet how protectingly and\npersuasively he once talked to the poor, helpless slave girl! And how\nentirely I trusted him! But now suspicions darkened my mind. Was my child\ndead, or had they deceived me, and sold her?\n\nIf the secret memoirs of many members of Congress should be published,\ncurious details would be unfolded. I once saw a letter from a member of\nCongress to a slave, who was the mother of six of his children. He wrote to\nrequest that she would send her children away from the great house before\nhis return, as he expected to be accompanied by friends. The woman could\nnot read, and was obliged to employ another to read the letter. The\nexistence of the colored children did not trouble this gentleman, it was\nonly the fear that friends might recognize in their features a resemblance\nto him.\n\nAt the end of six months, a letter came to my grandmother, from Brooklyn.\nIt was written by a young lady in the family, and announced that Ellen had\njust arrived. It contained the following message from her: \"I do try to do\njust as you told me to, and I pray for you every night and morning.\" I\nunderstood that these words were meant for me; and they were a balsam to my\nheart. The writer closed her letter by saying, \"Ellen is a nice little\ngirl, and we shall like to have her with us. My cousin, Mr. Sands, has\ngiven her to me, to be my little waiting maid. I shall send her to school,\nand I hope some day she will write to you herself.\" This letter perplexed\nand troubled me. Had my child's father merely placed her there till she was\nold enough to support herself? Or had he given her to his cousin, as a\npiece of property? If the last idea was correct, his cousin might return to\nthe south at any time, and hold Ellen as a slave. I tried to put away from\nme the painful thought that such a foul wrong could have been done to us. I\nsaid to myself, \"Surely there must be _some_ justice in man;\" then I\nremembered, with a sigh, how slavery perverted all the natural feelings of\nthe human heart. It gave me a pang to look on my light-hearted boy. He\nbelieved himself free; and to have him brought under the yoke of slavery,\nwould be more than I could bear. How I longed to have him safely out of the\nreach of its power!\n\n\n\nXXVIII. Aunt Nancy.\n\n\nI have mentioned my great-aunt, who was a slave in Dr. Flint's family, and\nwho had been my refuge during the shameful persecutions I suffered from\nhim. This aunt had been married at twenty years of age; that is, as far as\nslaves _can_ marry. She had the consent of her master and mistress, and a\nclergyman performed the ceremony. But it was a mere form, without any legal\nvalue. Her master or mistress could annul it any day they pleased. She had\nalways slept on the floor in the entry, near Mrs. Flint's chamber door,\nthat she might be within call. When she was married, she was told she might\nhave the use of a small room in an outhouse. Her mother and her husband\nfurnished it. He was a seafaring man, and was allowed to sleep there when\nhe was at home. But on the wedding evening, the bride was ordered to her\nold post on the entry floor.\n\nMrs. Flint, at that time, had no children; but she was expecting to be a\nmother, and if she should want a drink of water in the night, what could\nshe do without her slave to bring it? So my aunt was compelled to lie at\nher door, until one midnight she was forced to leave, to give premature\nbirth to a child. In a fortnight she was required to resume her place on\nthe entry floor, because Mrs. Flint's babe needed her attentions. She kept\nher station there through summer and winter, until she had given premature\nbirth to six children; and all the while she was employed as night-nurse to\nMrs. Flint's children. Finally, toiling all day, and being deprived of rest\nat night, completely broke down her constitution, and Dr. Flint declared it\nwas impossible she could ever become the mother of a living child. The fear\nof losing so valuable a servant by death, now induced them to allow her to\nsleep in her little room in the out-house, except when there was sickness\nin the family. She afterwards had two feeble babes, one of whom died in a\nfew days, and the other in four weeks. I well remember her patient sorrow\nas she held the last dead baby in her arms. \"I wish it could have lived,\"\nshe said; \"it is not the will of God that any of my children should live.\nBut I will try to be fit to meet their little spirits in heaven.\"\n\nAunt Nancy was housekeeper and waiting-maid in Dr. Flint's family. Indeed,\nshe was the _factotum_ of the household. Nothing went on well without her.\nShe was my mother's twin sister, and, as far as was in her power, she\nsupplied a mother's place to us orphans. I slept with her all the time I\nlived in my old master's house, and the bond between us was very strong.\nWhen my friends tried to discourage me from running away; she always\nencouraged me. When they thought I had better return and ask my master's\npardon, because there was no possibility of escape, she sent me word never\nto yield. She said if I persevered I might, perhaps, gain the freedom of my\nchildren; and even if I perished in doing it, that was better than to leave\nthem to groan under the same persecutions that had blighted my own life.\nAfter I was shut up in my dark cell, she stole away, whenever she could, to\nbring me the news and say something cheering. How often did I kneel down to\nlisten to her words of consolation, whispered through a crack! \"I am old,\nand have not long to live,\" she used to say; \"and I could die happy if I\ncould only see you and the children free. You must pray to God, Linda, as I\ndo for you, that he will lead you out of this darkness.\" I would beg her\nnot to worry herself on my account; that there was an end of all suffering\nsooner or later, and that whether I lived in chains or in freedom, I should\nalways remember her as the good friend who had been the comfort of my life.\nA word from her always strengthened me; and not me only. The whole family\nrelied upon her judgement, and were guided by her advice. I had been in my\ncell six years when my grandmother was summoned to the bedside of this, her\nlast remaining daughter. She was very ill, and they said she would die.\nGrandmother had not entered Dr. Flint's house for several years. They had\ntreated her cruelly, but she thought nothing of that now. She was grateful\nfor permission to watch by the death-bed of her child. They had always been\ndevoted to each other; and now they sat looking into each other's eyes,\nlonging to speak of the secret that had weighed so much on the hearts of\nboth. My aunt had been stricken with paralysis. She lived but two days, and\nthe last day she was speechless. Before she lost the power of utterance,\nshe told her mother not to grieve if she could not speak to her; that she\nwould try to hold up her hand; to let her know that all was well with her.\nEven the hard-hearted doctor was a little softened when he saw the dying\nwoman try to smile on the aged mother, who was kneeling by her side. His\neyes moistened for a moment, as he said she had always been a faithful\nservant, and they should never be able to supply her place. Mrs. Flint took\nto her bed, quite overcome by the shock. While my grandmother sat alone\nwith the dead, the doctor came in, leading his youngest son, who had always\nbeen a great pet with aunt Nancy, and was much attached to her. \"Martha,\"\nsaid he, \"aunt Nancy loved this child, and when he comes where you are, I\nhope you will be kind to him, for her sake.\" She replied, \"Your wife was my\nfoster-child, Dr. Flint, the foster-sister of my poor Nancy, and you little\nknow me if you think I can feel any thing but good will for her children.\"\n\n\"I wish the past could be forgotten, and that we might never think of it,\"\nsaid he; \"and that Linda would come to supply her aunt's place. She would\nbe worth more to us than all the money that could be paid for her. I wish\nit for your sake also, Martha. Now that Nancy is taken away from you, she\nwould be a great comfort to your old age.\" He knew he was touching a\ntender chord. Almost choking with grief, my grandmother replied, \"It was\nnot I that drove Linda away. My grandchildren are gone; and of my nine\nchildren only one is left. God help me!\"\n\nTo me, the death of this kind relative was an inexpressible sorrow. I knew\nthat she had been slowly murdered; and I felt that my troubles had helped\nto finish the work. After I heard of her illness, I listened constantly to\nhear what news was brought from the great house; and the thought that I\ncould not go to her made me utterly miserable. At last, as uncle Phillip\ncame into the house, I heard some one inquire, \"How is she?\" and he\nanswered, \"She is dead.\" My little cell seemed whirling round, and I knew\nnothing more till I opened my eyes and found uncle Phillip bending over me.\nI had no need to ask any questions. He whispered, \"Linda, she died happy.\"\nI could not weep. My fixed gaze troubled him. \"Don't look _so_\" he said.\n\"Don't add to my poor mother's trouble. Remember how much she has to bear,\nand that we ought to do all we can to comfort her.\" Ah, yes, that blessed\nold grandmother, who for seventy-three years had borne the pelting storms\nof a slave-mother's life. She did indeed need consolation!\n\nMrs. Flint had rendered her poor foster-sister childless, apparently\nwithout any compunction; and with cruel selfishness had ruined her health\nby years of incessant, unrequited toil, and broken rest. But now she became\nvery sentimental. I suppose she thought it would be a beautiful\nillustration of the attachment existing between slaveholder and slave, if\nthe body of her old worn-out servant was buried at her feet. She sent for\nthe clergyman and asked if he had any objection to burying aunt Nancy in\nthe doctor's family burial-place. No colored person had ever been allowed\ninterment in the white people's burying-ground, and the minister knew that\nall the deceased of your family reposed together in the old graveyard of\nthe slaves. He therefore replied, \"I have no objection to complying with\nyour wish; but perhaps aunt Nancy's _mother_ may have some choice as to\nwhere her remains shall be deposited.\"\n\nIt had never occurred to Mrs. Flint that slaves could have any feelings.\nWhen my grandmother was consulted, she at once said she wanted Nancy to lie\nwith all the rest of her family, and where her own old body would be\nburied. Mrs. Flint graciously complied with her wish, though she said it\nwas painful to her to have Nancy buried away from _her_. She might have\nadded with touching pathos, \"I was so long _used_ to sleep with her lying\nnear me, on the entry floor.\"\n\nMy uncle Phillip asked permission to bury his sister at his own expense;\nand slaveholders are always ready to grant _such_ favors to slaves and\ntheir relatives. The arrangements were very plain, but perfectly\nrespectable. She was buried on the Sabbath, and Mrs. Flint's minister read\nthe funeral service. There was a large concourse of colored people, bond\nand free, and a few white persons who had always been friendly to our\nfamily. Dr. Flint's carriage was in the procession; and when the body was\ndeposited in its humble resting place, the mistress dropped a tear, and\nreturned to her carriage, probably thinking she had performed her duty\nnobly.\n\nIt was talked of by the slaves as a mighty grand funeral. Northern\ntravellers, passing through the place, might have described this tribute of\nrespect to the humble dead as a beautiful feature in the \"patriarchal\ninstitution;\" a touching proof of the attachment between slaveholders and\ntheir servants; and tender-hearted Mrs. Flint would have confirmed this\nimpression, with handkerchief at her eyes. _We_ could have told them a\ndifferent story. We could have given them a chapter of wrongs and\nsufferings, that would have touched their hearts, if they _had_ any hearts\nto feel for the colored people. We could have told them how the poor old\nslave-mother had toiled, year after year, to earn eight hundred dollars to\nbuy her son Phillip's right to his own earnings; and how that same Phillip\npaid the expenses of the funeral, which they regarded as doing so much\ncredit to the master. We could also have told them of a poor, blighted\nyoung creature, shut up in a living grave for years, to avoid the tortures\nthat would be inflicted on her, if she ventured to come out and look on the\nface of her departed friend.\n\nAll this, and much more, I thought of, as I sat at my loophole, waiting\nfor the family to return from the grave; sometimes weeping, sometimes\nfalling asleep, dreaming strange dreams of the dead and the living.\n\nIt was sad to witness the grief of my bereaved grandmother. She had always\nbeen strong to bear, and now, as ever, religious faith supported her. But\nher dark life had become still darker, and age and trouble were leaving\ndeep traces on her withered face. She had four places to knock for me to\ncome to the trapdoor, and each place had a different meaning. She now came\noftener than she had done, and talked to me of her dead daughter, while\ntears trickled slowly down her furrowed cheeks. I said all I could to\ncomfort her; but it was a sad reflection, that instead of being able to\nhelp her, I was a constant source of anxiety and trouble. The poor old back\nwas fitted to its burden. It bent under it, but did not break.\n\n\n\nXXIX. Preparations For Escape.\n\n\nI hardly expect that the reader will credit me, when I affirm that I lived\nin that little dismal hole, almost deprived of light and air, and with no\nspace to move my limbs, for nearly seven years. But it is a fact; and to me\na sad one, even now; for my body still suffers from the effects of that\nlong imprisonment, to say nothing of my soul. Members of my family, now\nliving in New York and Boston, can testify to the truth of what I say.\n\nCountless were the nights that I sat late at the little loophole scarcely\nlarge enough to give me a glimpse of one twinkling star. There, heard the\npatrols and slave-hunters conferring together about the capture of\nrunaways, well knowing how rejoiced they would be to catch me.\n\nSeason after season, year after year, I peeped at my children's faces, and\nheard their sweet voices, with a heart yearning all the while to say, \"Your\nmother is here.\" Sometimes it appeared to me as if ages had rolled away\nsince I entered upon that gloomy, monotonous existence. At times, I was\nstupefied and listless; at other times I became very impatient to know when\nthese dark years would end, and I should again be allowed to feel the\nsunshine, and breathe the pure air.\n\nAfter Ellen left us, this feeling increased. Mr. Sands had agreed that\nBenny might go to the north whenever his uncle Phillip could go with him;\nand I was anxious to be there also, to watch over my children, and protect\nthem so far as I was able. Moreover, I was likely to be drowned out of my\nden, if I remained much longer; for the slight roof was getting badly out\nof repair, and uncle Phillip was afraid to remove the shingles, lest some\none should get a glimpse of me. When storms occurred in the night, they\nspread mats and bits of carpet, which in the morning appeared to have been\nlaid out to dry; but to cover the roof in the daytime might have attracted\nattention. Consequently, my clothes and bedding were often drenched; a\nprocess by which the pains and aches in my cramped and stiffened limbs were\ngreatly increased. I revolved various plans of escape in my mind, which I\nsometimes imparted to my grandmother, when she came to whisper with me at\nthe trap-door. The kind-hearted old woman had an intense sympathy for\nrunaways. She had known too much of the cruelties inflicted on those who\nwere captured. Her memory always flew back at once to the sufferings of her\nbright and handsome son, Benjamin, the youngest and dearest of her flock.\nSo, whenever I alluded to the subject, she would groan out, \"O, don't think\nof it, child. You'll break my heart.\" I had no good old aunt Nancy now to\nencourage me; but my brother William and my children were continually\nbeckoning me to the north.\n\nAnd now I must go back a few months in my story. I have stated that the\nfirst of January was the time for selling slaves, or leasing them out to\nnew masters. If time were counted by heart-throbs, the poor slaves might\nreckon years of suffering during that festival so joyous to the free. On\nthe New Year's day preceding my aunt's death, one of my friends, named\nFanny, was to be sold at auction, to pay her master's debts. My thoughts\nwere with her during all the day, and at night I anxiously inquired what\nhad been her fate. I was told that she had been sold to one master, and her\nfour little girls to another master, far distant; that she had escaped from\nher purchaser, and was not to be found. Her mother was the old Aggie I have\nspoken of. She lived in a small tenement belonging to my grandmother, and\nbuilt on the same lot with her own house. Her dwelling was searched and\nwatched, and that brought the patrols so near me that I was obliged to keep\nvery close in my den. The hunters were somehow eluded; and not long\nafterwards Benny accidentally caught sight of Fanny in her mother's hut. He\ntold his grandmother, who charged him never to speak of it, explaining to\nhim the frightful consequences; and he never betrayed the trust. Aggie\nlittle dreamed that my grandmother knew where her daughter was concealed,\nand that the stooping form of her old neighbor was bending under a similar\nburden of anxiety and fear; but these dangerous secrets deepened the\nsympathy between the two old persecuted mothers.\n\nMy friend Fanny and I remained many weeks hidden within call of each other;\nbut she was unconscious of the fact. I longed to have her share my den,\nwhich seemed a more secure retreat than her own; but I had brought so much\ntrouble on my grandmother, that it seemed wrong to ask her to incur greater\nrisks. My restlessness increased. I had lived too long in bodily pain and\nanguish of spirit. Always I was in dread that by some accident, or some\ncontrivance, slavery would succeed in snatching my children from me. This\nthought drove me nearly frantic, and I determined to steer for the North\nStar at all hazards. At this crisis, Providence opened an unexpected way\nfor me to escape. My friend Peter came one evening, and asked to speak with\nme. \"Your day has come, Linda,\" said he. \"I have found a chance for you to\ngo to the Free States. You have a fortnight to decide.\" The news seemed too\ngood to be true; but Peter explained his arrangements, and told me all that\nwas necessary was for me to say I would go. I was going to answer him with\na joyful yes, when the thought of Benny came to my mind. I told him the\ntemptation was exceedingly strong, but I was terribly afraid of Dr. Flint's\nalleged power over my child, and that I could not go and leave him behind.\nPeter remonstrated earnestly. He said such a good chance might never occur\nagain; that Benny was free, and could be sent to me; and that for the sake\nof my children's welfare I ought not to hesitate a moment. I told him I\nwould consult with uncle Phillip. My uncle rejoiced in the plan, and bade\nme go by all means. He promised, if his life was spared, that he would\neither bring or send my son to me as soon as I reached a place of safety. I\nresolved to go, but thought nothing had better be said to my grandmother\ntill very near the time of departure. But my uncle thought she would feel\nit more keenly if I left here so suddenly. \"I will reason with her,\" said\nhe, \"and convince her how necessary it is, not only for your sake, but for\nhers also. You cannot be blind to the fact that she is sinking under her\nburdens.\" I was not blind to it. I knew that my concealment was an\never-present source of anxiety, and that the older she grew the more\nnervously fearful she was of discovery. My uncle talked with her, and\nfinally succeeded in persuading her that it was absolutely necessary for me\nto seize the chance so unexpectedly offered.\n\nThe anticipation of being a free woman proved almost too much for my weak\nframe. The excitement stimulated me, and at the same time bewildered me. I\nmade busy preparations for my journey, and for my son to follow me. I\nresolved to have an interview with him before I went, that I might give him\ncautions and advice, and tell him how anxiously I should be waiting for him\nat the north. Grandmother stole up to me as often as possible to whisper\nwords of counsel. She insisted upon writing to Dr. Flint, as soon as I\narrived in the Free States, and asking him to sell me to her. She said she\nwould sacrifice her house, and all she had in the world, for the sake of\nhaving me safe with my children in any part of the world. If she could only\nlive to know _that_ she could die in peace. I promised the dear old\nfaithful friend that I would write to her as soon as I arrived, and put the\nletter in a safe way to reach her; but in my own mind I resolved that not\nanother cent of her hard earnings should be spent to pay rapacious\nslaveholders for what they called their property. And even if I had not\nbeen unwilling to buy what I had already a right to possess, common\nhumanity would have prevented me from accepting the generous offer, at the\nexpense of turning my aged relative out of house and home, when she was\ntrembling on the brink of the grave.\n\nI was to escape in a vessel; but I forbear to mention any further\nparticulars. I was in readiness, but the vessel was unexpectedly detained\nseveral days. Meantime, news came to town of a most horrible murder\ncommitted on a fugitive slave, named James. Charity, the mother of this\nunfortunate young man, had been an old acquaintance of ours. I have told\nthe shocking particulars of his death, in my description of some of the\nneighboring slaveholders. My grandmother, always nervously sensitive about\nrunaways, was terribly frightened. She felt sure that a similar fate\nawaited me, if I did not desist from my enterprise. She sobbed, and\ngroaned, and entreated me not to go. Her excessive fear was somewhat\ncontagious, and my heart was not proof against her extreme agony. I was\ngrievously disappointed, but I promised to relinquish my project.\n\nWhen my friend Peter was apprised of this, he was both disappointed and\nvexed. He said, that judging from our past experience, it would be a long\ntime before I had such another chance to throw away. I told him it need not\nbe thrown away; that I had a friend concealed near by, who would be glad\nenough to take the place that had been provided for me. I told him about\npoor Fanny, and the kind-hearted, noble fellow, who never turned his back\nupon any body in distress, white or black, expressed his readiness to help\nher. Aggie was much surprised when she found that we knew her secret. She\nwas rejoiced to hear of such a chance for Fanny, and arrangements were made\nfor her to go on board the vessel the next night. They both supposed that I\nhad long been at the north, therefore my name was not mentioned in the\ntransaction. Fanny was carried on board at the appointed time, and stowed\naway in a very small cabin. This accommodation had been purchased at a\nprice that would pay for a voyage to England. But when one proposes to go\nto fine old England, they stop to calculate whether they can afford the\ncost of the pleasure; while in making a bargain to escape from slavery, the\ntrembling victim is ready to say, \"take all I have, only don't betray me!\"\n\nThe next morning I peeped through my loophole, and saw that it was dark and\ncloudy. At night I received news that the wind was ahead, and the vessel\nhad not sailed. I was exceedingly anxious about Fanny, and Peter too, who\nwas running a tremendous risk at my instigation. Next day the wind and\nweather remained the same. Poor Fanny had been half dead with fright when\nthey carried her on board, and I could readily imagine how she must be\nsuffering now. Grandmother came often to my den, to say how thankful she\nwas I did not go. On the third morning she rapped for me to come down to\nthe storeroom. The poor old sufferer was breaking down under her weight of\ntrouble. She was easily flurried now. I found her in a nervous, excited\nstate, but I was not aware that she had forgotten to lock the door behind\nher, as usual. She was exceedingly worried about the detention of the\nvessel. She was afraid all would be discovered, and then Fanny, and Peter,\nand I, would all be tortured to death, and Phillip would be utterly ruined,\nand her house would be torn down. Poor Peter! If he should die such a\nhorrible death as the poor slave James had lately done, and all for his\nkindness in trying to help me, how dreadful it would be for us all! Alas,\nthe thought was familiar to me, and had sent many a sharp pang through my\nheart. I tried to suppress my own anxiety, and speak soothingly to her. She\nbrought in some allusion to aunt Nancy, the dear daughter she had recently\nburied, and then she lost all control of herself. As she stood there,\ntrembling and sobbing, a voice from the piazza called out, \"Whar is you,\naunt Marthy?\" Grandmother was startled, and in her agitation opened the\ndoor, without thinking of me. In stepped Jenny, the mischievous housemaid,\nwho had tried to enter my room, when I was concealed in the house of my\nwhite benefactress. \"I's bin huntin ebery whar for you, aunt Marthy,\" said\nshe. \"My missis wants you to send her some crackers.\" I had slunk down\nbehind a barrel, which entirely screened me, but I imagined that Jenny was\nlooking directly at the spot, and my heart beat violently. My grandmother\nimmediately thought what she had done, and went out quickly with Jenny to\ncount the crackers locking the door after her. She returned to me, in a few\nminutes, the perfect picture of despair. \"Poor child!\" she exclaimed, \"my\ncarelessness has ruined you. The boat ain't gone yet. Get ready\nimmediately, and go with Fanny. I ain't got another word to say against it\nnow; for there's no telling what may happen this day.\"\n\nUncle Phillip was sent for, and he agreed with his mother in thinking that\nJenny would inform Dr. Flint in less than twenty-four hours. He advised\ngetting me on board the boat, if possible; if not, I had better keep very\nstill in my den, where they could not find me without tearing the house\ndown. He said it would not do for him to move in the matter, because\nsuspicion would be immediately excited; but he promised to communicate with\nPeter. I felt reluctant to apply to him again, having implicated him too\nmuch already; but there seemed to be no alternative. Vexed as Peter had\nbeen by my indecision, he was true to his generous nature, and said at once\nthat he would do his best to help me, trusting I should show myself a\nstronger woman this time.\n\nHe immediately proceeded to the wharf, and found that the wind had shifted,\nand the vessel was slowly beating down stream. On some pretext of urgent\nnecessity, he offered two boatmen a dollar apiece to catch up with her. He\nwas of lighter complexion than the boatmen he hired, and when the captain\nsaw them coming so rapidly, he thought officers were pursuing his vessel in\nsearch of the runaway slave he had on board. They hoisted sails, but the\nboat gained upon them, and the indefatigable Peter sprang on board.\n\nThe captain at once recognized him. Peter asked him to go below, to speak\nabout a bad bill he had given him. When he told his errand, the captain\nreplied, \"Why, the woman's here already; and I've put her where you or the\ndevil would have a tough job to find her.\"\n\n\"But it is another woman I want to bring,\" said Peter. \"_She_ is in great\ndistress, too, and you shall be paid any thing within reason, if you'll\nstop and take her.\"\n\n\"What's her name?\" inquired the captain. \"Linda,\" he replied.\n\n\"That's the name of the woman already here,\" rejoined the captain. \"By\nGeorge! I believe you mean to betray me.\"\n\n\"O!\" exclaimed Peter, \"God knows I wouldn't harm a hair of your head. I am\ntoo grateful to you. But there really _is_ another woman in great danger.\nDo have the humanity to stop and take her!\"\n\nAfter a while they came to an understanding. Fanny, not dreaming I was any\nwhere about in that region, had assumed my name, though she called herself\nJohnson. \"Linda is a common name,\" said Peter, \"and the woman I want to\nbring is Linda Brent.\"\n\nThe captain agreed to wait at a certain place till evening, being\nhandsomely paid for his detention.\n\nOf course, the day was an anxious one for us all. But we concluded that if\nJenny had seen me, she would be too wise to let her mistress know of it;\nand that she probably would not get a chance to see Dr. Flint's family till\nevening, for I knew very well what were the rules in that household. I\nafterwards believed that she did not see me; for nothing ever came of it,\nand she was one of those base characters that would have jumped to betray a\nsuffering fellow being for the sake of thirty pieces of silver.\n\nI made all my arrangements to go on board as soon as it was dusk. The\nintervening time I resolved to spend with my son. I had not spoken to him\nfor seven years, though I had been under the same roof, and seen him every\nday, when I was well enough to sit at the loophole. I did not dare to\nventure beyond the storeroom; so they brought him there, and locked us up\ntogether, in a place concealed from the piazza door. It was an agitating\ninterview for both of us. After we had talked and wept together for a\nlittle while, he said, \"Mother, I'm glad you're going away. I wish I could\ngo with you. I knew you was here; and I have been _so_ afraid they would\ncome and catch you!\" I was greatly surprised, and asked him how he had\nfound it out.\n\nHe replied, \"I was standing under the eaves, one day, before Ellen went\naway, and I heard somebody cough up over the wood shed. I don't know what\nmade me think it was you, but I did think so. I missed Ellen, the night\nbefore she went away; and grandmother brought her back into the room in the\nnight; and I thought maybe she'd been to see _you_, before she went, for I\nheard grandmother whisper to her, 'Now go to sleep; and remember never to\ntell.'\"\n\nI asked him if he ever mentioned his suspicions to his sister. He said he\nnever did; but after he heard the cough, if he saw her playing with other\nchildren on that side of the house, he always tried to coax her round to\nthe other side, for fear they would hear me cough, too. He said he had kept\na close lookout for Dr. Flint, and if he saw him speak to a constable, or a\npatrol, he always told grandmother. I now recollected that I had seen him\nmanifest uneasiness, when people were on that side of the house, and I had\nat the time been puzzled to conjecture a motive for his actions. Such\nprudence may seem extraordinary in a boy of twelve years, but slaves, being\nsurrounded by mysteries, deceptions, and dangers, early learn to be\nsuspicious and watchful, and prematurely cautious and cunning. He had never\nasked a question of grandmother, or uncle Phillip, and I had often heard\nhim chime in with other children, when they spoke of my being at the north.\n\nI told him I was now really going to the Free States, and if he was a good,\nhonest boy, and a loving child to his dear old grandmother, the Lord would\nbless him, and bring him to me, and we and Ellen would live together. He\nbegan to tell me that grandmother had not eaten any thing all day. While he\nwas speaking, the door was unlocked, and she came in with a small bag of\nmoney, which she wanted me to take. I begged her to keep a part of it, at\nleast, to pay for Benny's being sent to the north; but she insisted, while\nher tears were falling fast, that I should take the whole. \"You may be sick\namong strangers,\" she said, \"and they would send you to the poorhouse to\ndie.\" Ah, that good grandmother!\n\nFor the last time I went up to my nook. Its desolate appearance no longer\nchilled me, for the light of hope had risen in my soul. Yet, even with the\nblessed prospect of freedom before me, I felt very sad at leaving forever\nthat old homestead, where I had been sheltered so long by the dear old\ngrandmother; where I had dreamed my first young dream of love; and where,\nafter that had faded away, my children came to twine themselves so closely\nround my desolate heart. As the hour approached for me to leave, I again\ndescended to the storeroom. My grandmother and Benny were there. She took\nme by the hand, and said, \"Linda, let us pray.\" We knelt down together,\nwith my child pressed to my heart, and my other arm round the faithful,\nloving old friend I was about to leave forever. On no other occasion has it\never been my lot to listen to so fervent a supplication for mercy and\nprotection. It thrilled through my heart, and inspired me with trust in\nGod.\n\nPeter was waiting for me in the street. I was soon by his side, faint in\nbody, but strong of purpose. I did not look back upon the old place, though\nI felt that I should never see it again.\n\n\n\nXXX. Northward Bound.\n\n\nI never could tell how we reached the wharf. My brain was all of a whirl,\nand my limbs tottered under me. At an appointed place we met my uncle\nPhillip, who had started before us on a different route, that he might\nreach the wharf first, and give us timely warning if there was any danger.\nA row-boat was in readiness. As I was about to step in, I felt something\npull me gently, and turning round I saw Benny, looking pale and anxious. He\nwhispered in my ear, \"I've been peeping into the doctor's window, and he's\nat home. Good by, mother. Don't cry; I'll come.\" He hastened away. I\nclasped the hand of my good uncle, to whom I owed so much, and of Peter,\nthe brave, generous friend who had volunteered to run such terrible risks\nto secure my safety. To this day I remember how his bright face beamed with\njoy, when he told me he had discovered a safe method for me to escape. Yet\nthat intelligent, enterprising, noble-hearted man was a chattel! Liable, by\nthe laws of a country that calls itself civilized, to be sold with horses\nand pigs! We parted in silence. Our hearts were all too full for words!\n\nSwiftly the boat glided over the water. After a while, one of the sailors\nsaid, \"Don't be down-hearted, madam. We will take you safely to your\nhusband, in ----.\" At first I could not imagine what he meant; but I had\npresence of mind to think that it probably referred to something the\ncaptain had told him; so I thanked him, and said I hoped we should have\npleasant weather.\n\nWhen I entered the vessel the captain came forward to meet me. He was an\nelderly man, with a pleasant countenance. He showed me to a little box of a\ncabin, where sat my friend Fanny. She started as if she had seen a spectre.\nShe gazed on me in utter astonishment, and exclaimed, \"Linda, can this be\n_you_? or is it your ghost?\" When we were locked in each other's arms, my\noverwrought feelings could no longer be restrained. My sobs reached the\nears of the captain, who came and very kindly reminded us, that for his\nsafety, as well as our own, it would be prudent for us not to attract any\nattention. He said that when there was a sail in sight he wished us to keep\nbelow; but at other times, he had no objection to our being on deck. He\nassured us that he would keep a good lookout, and if we acted prudently, he\nthought we should be in no danger. He had represented us as women going to\nmeet our husbands in ----. We thanked him, and promised to observe\ncarefully all the directions he gave us.\n\nFanny and I now talked by ourselves, low and quietly, in our little cabin.\nShe told me of the suffering she had gone through in making her escape, and\nof her terrors while she was concealed in her mother's house. Above all,\nshe dwelt on the agony of separation from all her children on that dreadful\nauction day. She could scarcely credit me, when I told her of the place\nwhere I had passed nearly seven years. \"We have the same sorrows,\" said I.\n\"No,\" replied she, \"you are going to see your children soon, and there is\nno hope that I shall ever even hear from mine.\"\n\nThe vessel was soon under way, but we made slow progress. The wind was\nagainst us, I should not have cared for this, if we had been out of sight\nof the town; but until there were miles of water between us and our\nenemies, we were filled with constant apprehensions that the constables\nwould come on board. Neither could I feel quite at ease with the captain\nand his men. I was an entire stranger to that class of people, and I had\nheard that sailors were rough, and sometimes cruel. We were so completely\nin their power, that if they were bad men, our situation would be dreadful.\nNow that the captain was paid for our passage, might he not be tempted to\nmake more money by giving us up to those who claimed us as property? I was\nnaturally of a confiding disposition, but slavery had made me suspicious of\nevery body. Fanny did not share my distrust of the captain or his men. She\nsaid she was afraid at first, but she had been on board three days while\nthe vessel lay in the dock, and nobody had betrayed her, or treated her\notherwise than kindly.\n\nThe captain soon came to advise us to go on deck for fresh air. His\nfriendly and respectful manner, combined with Fanny's testimony, reassured\nme, and we went with him. He placed us in a comfortable seat, and\noccasionally entered into conversation. He told us he was a Southerner by\nbirth, and had spent the greater part of his life in the Slave States, and\nthat he had recently lost a brother who traded in slaves. \"But,\" said he,\n\"it is a pitiable and degrading business, and I always felt ashamed to\nacknowledge my brother in connection with it.\" As we passed Snaky Swamp, he\npointed to it, and said, \"There is a slave territory that defies all the\nlaws.\" I thought of the terrible days I had spent there, and though it was\nnot called Dismal Swamp, it made me feel very dismal as I looked at it.\n\nI shall never forget that night. The balmy air of spring was so refreshing!\nAnd how shall I describe my sensations when we were fairly sailing on\nChesapeake Bay? O, the beautiful sunshine! the exhilarating breeze! And I\ncould enjoy them without fear or restraint. I had never realized what grand\nthings air and sunlight are till I had been deprived of them.\n\nTen days after we left land we were approaching Philadelphia. The captain\nsaid we should arrive there in the night, but he thought we had better wait\ntill morning, and go on shore in broad daylight, as the best way to avoid\nsuspicion.\n\nI replied, \"You know best. But will you stay on board and protect us?\"\n\nHe saw that I was suspicious, and he said he was sorry, now that he had\nbrought us to the end of our voyage, to find I had so little confidence in\nhim. Ah, if he had ever been a slave he would have known how difficult it\nwas to trust a white man. He assured us that we might sleep through the\nnight without fear; that he would take care we were not left unprotected.\nBe it said to the honor of this captain, Southerner as he was, that if\nFanny and I had been white ladies, and our passage lawfully engaged, he\ncould not have treated us more respectfully. My intelligent friend, Peter,\nhad rightly estimated the character of the man to whose honor he had\nintrusted us. The next morning I was on deck as soon as the day dawned. I\ncalled Fanny to see the sun rise, for the first time in our lives, on free\nsoil; for such I _then_ believed it to be. We watched the reddening sky,\nand saw the great orb come up slowly out of the water, as it seemed. Soon\nthe waves began to sparkle, and every thing caught the beautiful glow.\nBefore us lay the city of strangers. We looked at each other, and the eyes\nof both were moistened with tears. We had escaped from slavery, and we\nsupposed ourselves to be safe from the hunters. But we were alone in the\nworld, and we had left dear ties behind us; ties cruelly sundered by the\ndemon Slavery.\n\n\n\nXXXI. Incidents In Philadelphia.\n\n\nI had heard that the poor slave had many friends at the north. I trusted we\nshould find some of them. Meantime, we would take it for granted that all\nwere friends, till they proved to the contrary. I sought out the kind\ncaptain, thanked him for his attentions, and told him I should never cease\nto be grateful for the service he had rendered us. I gave him a message to\nthe friends I had left at home, and he promised to deliver it. We were\nplaced in a row-boat, and in about fifteen minutes were landed on a wood\nwharf in Philadelphia. As I stood looking round, the friendly captain\ntouched me on the shoulder, and said, \"There is a respectable-looking\ncolored man behind you. I will speak to him about the New York trains, and\ntell him you wish to go directly on.\" I thanked him, and asked him to\ndirect me to some shops where I could buy gloves and veils. He did so, and\nsaid he would talk with the colored man till I returned. I made what haste\nI could. Constant exercise on board the vessel, and frequent rubbing with\nsalt water, had nearly restored the use of my limbs. The noise of the great\ncity confused me, but I found the shops, and bought some double veils and\ngloves for Fanny and myself. The shopman told me they were so many levies.\nI had never heard the word before, but I did not tell him so. I thought if\nhe knew I was a stranger he might ask me where I came from. I gave him a\ngold piece, and when he returned the change, I counted it, and found out\nhow much a levy was. I made my way back to the wharf, where the captain\nintroduced me to the colored man, as the Rev. Jeremiah Durham, minister of\nBethel church. He took me by the hand, as if I had been an old friend. He\ntold us we were too late for the morning cars to New York, and must wait\nuntil the evening, or the next morning. He invited me to go home with him,\nassuring me that his wife would give me a cordial welcome; and for my\nfriend he would provide a home with one of his neighbors. I thanked him for\nso much kindness to strangers, and told him if I must be detained, I should\nlike to hunt up some people who formerly went from our part of the country.\nMr. Durham insisted that I should dine with him, and then he would assist\nme in finding my friends. The sailors came to bid us good by. I shook their\nhardy hands, with tears in my eyes. They had all been kind to us, and they\nhad rendered us a greater service than they could possibly conceive of.\n\nI had never seen so large a city, or been in contact with so many people in\nthe streets. It seemed as if those who passed looked at us with an\nexpression of curiosity. My face was so blistered and peeled, by sitting on\ndeck, in wind and sunshine, that I thought they could not easily decide to\nwhat nation I belonged.\n\nMrs. Durham met me with a kindly welcome, without asking any questions. I\nwas tired, and her friendly manner was a sweet refreshment. God bless her!\nI was sure that she had comforted other weary hearts, before I received her\nsympathy. She was surrounded by her husband and children, in a home made\nsacred by protecting laws. I thought of my own children, and sighed.\n\nAfter dinner Mr. Durham went with me in quest of the friends I had spoken\nof. They went from my native town, and I anticipated much pleasure in\nlooking on familiar faces. They were not at home, and we retracted our\nsteps through streets delightfully clean. On the way, Mr. Durham observed\nthat I had spoken to him of a daughter I expected to meet; that he was\nsurprised, for I looked so young he had taken me for a single woman. He was\napproaching a subject on which I was extremely sensitive. He would ask\nabout my husband next, I thought, and if I answered him truly, what would\nhe think of me? I told him I had two children, one in New York the other at\nthe south. He asked some further questions, and I frankly told him some of\nthe most important events of my life. It was painful for me to do it; but I\nwould not deceive him. If he was desirous of being my friend, I thought he\nought to know how far I was worthy of it. \"Excuse me, if I have tried your\nfeelings,\" said he. \"I did not question you from idle curiosity. I wanted\nto understand your situation, in order to know whether I could be of any\nservice to you, or your little girl. Your straight-forward answers do you\ncredit; but don't answer every body so openly. It might give some heartless\npeople a pretext for treating you with contempt.\"\n\nThat word _contempt_ burned me like coals of fire. I replied, \"God alone\nknows how I have suffered; and He, I trust, will forgive me. If I am\npermitted to have my children, I intend to be a good mother, and to live in\nsuch a manner that people cannot treat me with contempt.\"\n\n\"I respect your sentiments,\" said he. \"Place your trust in God, and be\ngoverned by good principles, and you will not fail to find friends.\"\n\nWhen we reached home, I went to my room, glad to shut out the world for a\nwhile. The words he had spoken made an indelible impression upon me. They\nbrought up great shadows from the mournful past. In the midst of my\nmeditations I was startled by a knock at the door. Mrs. Durham entered, her\nface all beaming with kindness, to say that there was an anti-slavery\nfriend down stairs, who would like to see me. I overcame my dread of\nencountering strangers, and went with her. Many questions were asked\nconcerning my experiences, and my escape from slavery; but I observed how\ncareful they all were not to say any thing that might wound my feelings.\nHow gratifying this was, can be fully understood only by those who have\nbeen accustomed to be treated as if they were not included within the pale\nof human beings. The anti-slavery friend had come to inquire into my plans,\nand to offer assistance, if needed. Fanny was comfortably established, for\nthe present, with a friend of Mr. Durham. The Anti-Slavery Society agreed\nto pay her expenses to New York. The same was offered to me, but I declined\nto accept it, telling them that my grandmother had given me sufficient to\npay my expenses to the end of my journey. We were urged to remain in\nPhiladelphia a few days, until some suitable escort could be found for us.\nI gladly accepted the proposition, for I had a dread of meeting\nslaveholders, and some dread also of railroads. I had never entered a\nrailroad car in my life, and it seemed to me quite an important event.\n\nThat night I sought my pillow with feelings I had never carried to it\nbefore. I verily believed myself to be a free woman. I was wakeful for a\nlong time, and I had no sooner fallen asleep, than I was roused by\nfire-bells. I jumped up, and hurried on my clothes. Where I came from,\nevery body hastened to dress themselves on such occasions. The white people\nthought a great fire might be used as a good opportunity for insurrection,\nand that it was best to be in readiness; and the colored people were\nordered out to labor in extinguishing the flames. There was but one engine\nin our town, and colored women and children were often required to drag it\nto the river's edge and fill it. Mrs. Durham's daughter slept in the same\nroom with me, and seeing that she slept through all the din, I thought it\nwas my duty to wake her. \"What's the matter?\" said she, rubbing her eyes.\n\n\"They're screaming fire in the streets, and the bells are ringing,\" I\nreplied.\n\n\"What of that?\" said she, drowsily. \"We are used to it. We never get up,\nwithout the fire is very near. What good would it do?\"\n\nI was quite surprised that it was not necessary for us to go and help fill\nthe engine. I was an ignorant child, just beginning to learn how things\nwent on in great cities.\n\nAt daylight, I heard women crying fresh fish, berries, radishes, and\nvarious other things. All this was new to me. I dressed myself at an early\nhour, and sat at the window to watch that unknown tide of life.\nPhiladelphia seemed to me a wonderfully great place. At the breakfast\ntable, my idea of going out to drag the engine was laughed over, and I\njoined in the mirth.\n\nI went to see Fanny, and found her so well contented among her new friends\nthat she was in no haste to leave. I was also very happy with my kind\nhostess. She had had advantages for education, and was vastly my superior.\nEvery day, almost every hour, I was adding to my little stock of knowledge.\nShe took me out to see the city as much as she deemed prudent. One day she\ntook me to an artist's room, and showed me the portraits of some of her\nchildren. I had never seen any paintings of colored people before, and they\nseemed to be beautiful.\n\nAt the end of five days, one of Mrs. Durham's friends offered to accompany\nus to New York the following morning. As I held the hand of my good hostess\nin a parting clasp, I longed to know whether her husband had repeated to\nher what I had told him. I supposed he had, but she never made any allusion\nto it. I presume it was the delicate silence of womanly sympathy.\n\nWhen Mr. Durham handed us our tickets, he said, \"I am afraid you will have\na disagreeable ride; but I could not procure tickets for the first-class\ncars.\"\n\nSupposing I had not given him money enough, I offered more. \"O, no,\" said\nhe, \"they could not be had for any money. They don't allow colored people\nto go in the first-class cars.\"\n\nThis was the first chill to my enthusiasm about the Free States. Colored\npeople were allowed to ride in a filthy box, behind white people, at the\nsouth, but there they were not required to pay for the privilege. It made\nme sad to find how the north aped the customs of slavery.\n\nWe were stowed away in a large, rough car, with windows on each side, too\nhigh for us to look out without standing up. It was crowded with people,\napparently of all nations. There were plenty of beds and cradles,\ncontaining screaming and kicking babies. Every other man had a cigar or\npipe in his mouth, and jugs of whiskey were handed round freely. The fumes\nof the whiskey and the dense tobacco smoke were sickening to my senses, and\nmy mind was equally nauseated by the coarse jokes and ribald songs around\nme. It was a very disagreeable ride. Since that time there has been some\nimprovement in these matters.\n\n\n\nXXXII. The Meeting Of Mother And Daughter.\n\n\nWhen we arrived in New York, I was half crazed by the crowd of coachmen\ncalling out, \"Carriage, ma'am?\" We bargained with one to take us to\nSullivan Street for twelve shillings. A burly Irishman stepped up and said,\n\"I'll tak' ye for sax shillings.\" The reduction of half the price was an\nobject to us, and we asked if he could take us right away. \"Troth an I\nwill, ladies,\" he replied. I noticed that the hackmen smiled at each other,\nand I inquired whether his conveyance was decent. \"Yes, it's dacent it is,\nmarm. Devil a bit would I be after takin' ladies in a cab that was not\ndacent.\" We gave him our checks. He went for the baggage, and soon\nreappeared, saying, \"This way, if you plase, ladies.\" We followed, and\nfound our trunks on a truck, and we were invited to take our seats on them.\nWe told him that was not what we bargained for, and he must take the trunks\noff. He swore they should not be touched till we had paid him six\nshillings. In our situation it was not prudent to attract attention, and I\nwas about to pay him what he required, when a man near by shook his head\nfor me not to do it. After a great ado we got rid of the Irishman, and had\nour trunks fastened on a hack. We had been recommended to a boarding-house\nin Sullivan Street, and thither we drove. There Fanny and I separated. The\nAnti-Slavery Society provided a home for her, and I afterwards heard of her\nin prosperous circumstances. I sent for an old friend from my part of the\ncountry, who had for some time been doing business in New York. He came\nimmediately. I told him I wanted to go to my daughter, and asked him to aid\nme in procuring an interview.\n\nI cautioned him not to let it be known to the family that I had just\narrived from the south, because they supposed I had been at the north seven\nyears. He told me there was a colored woman in Brooklyn who came from the\nsame town I did, and I had better go to her house, and have my daughter\nmeet me there. I accepted the proposition thankfully, and he agreed to\nescort me to Brooklyn. We crossed Fulton ferry, went up Myrtle Avenue, and\nstopped at the house he designated. I was just about to enter, when two\ngirls passed. My friend called my attention to them. I turned, and\nrecognized in the eldest, Sarah, the daughter of a woman who used to live\nwith my grandmother, but who had left the south years ago. Surprised and\nrejoiced at this unexpected meeting, I threw my arms round her, and\ninquired concerning her mother.\n\n\"You take no notice of the other girl,\" said my friend. I turned, and there\nstood my Ellen! I pressed her to my heart, then held her away from me to\ntake a look at her. She had changed a good deal in the two years since I\nparted from her. Signs of neglect could be discerned by eyes less observing\nthan a mother's. My friend invited us all to go into the house; but Ellen\nsaid she had been sent of an errand, which she would do as quickly as\npossible, and go home and ask Mrs. Hobbs to let her come and see me. It was\nagreed that I should send for her the next day. Her companion, Sarah,\nhastened to tell her mother of my arrival. When I entered the house, I\nfound the mistress of it absent, and I waited for her return. Before I saw\nher, I heard her saying, \"Where is Linda Brent? I used to know her father\nand mother.\" Soon Sarah came with her mother. So there was quite a company\nof us, all from my grandmother's neighborhood. These friends gathered round\nme and questioned me eagerly. They laughed, they cried, and they shouted.\nThey thanked God that I had got away from my persecutors and was safe on\nLong Island. It was a day of great excitement. How different from the\nsilent days I had passed in my dreary den!\n\nThe next morning was Sunday. My first waking thoughts were occupied with\nthe note I was to send to Mrs. Hobbs, the lady with whom Ellen lived. That\nI had recently come into that vicinity was evident; otherwise I should have\nsooner inquired for my daughter. It would not do to let them know I had\njust arrived from the south, for that would involve the suspicion of my\nhaving been harbored there, and might bring trouble, if not ruin, on\nseveral people.\n\nI like a straightforward course, and am always reluctant to resort to\nsubterfuges. So far as my ways have been crooked, I charge them all upon\nslavery. It was that system of violence and wrong which now left me no\nalternative but to enact a falsehood. I began my note by stating that I had\nrecently arrived from Canada, and was very desirous to have my daughter\ncome to see me. She came and brought a message from Mrs. Hobbs, inviting me\nto her house, and assuring me that I need not have any fears. The\nconversation I had with my child did not leave my mind at ease. When I\nasked if she was well treated, she answered yes; but there was no\nheartiness in the tone, and it seemed to me that she said it from an\nunwillingness to have me troubled on her account. Before she left me, she\nasked very earnestly, \"Mother, will you take me to live with you?\" It made\nme sad to think that I could not give her a home till I went to work and\nearned the means; and that might take me a long time. When she was placed\nwith Mrs. Hobbs, the agreement was that she should be sent to school She\nhad been there two years, and was now nine years old, and she scarcely knew\nher letters. There was no excuse for this, for there were good public\nschools in Brooklyn, to which she could have been sent without expense.\n\nShe staid with me till dark, and I went home with her. I was received in a\nfriendly manner by the family, and all agreed in saying that Ellen was a\nuseful, good girl. Mrs. Hobbs looked me coolly in the face, and said, \"I\nsuppose you know that my cousin, Mr. Sands, has _given_ her to my eldest\ndaughter. She will make a nice waiting-maid for her when she grows up.\" I\ndid not answer a word. How _could_ she, who knew by experience the strength\nof a mother's love, and who was perfectly aware of the relation Mr. Sands\nbore to my children,--how _could_ she look me in the face, while she thrust\nsuch a dagger into my heart?\n\nI was no longer surprised that they had kept her in such a state of\nignorance. Mr. Hobbs had formerly been wealthy, but he had failed, and\nafterwards obtained a subordinate situation in the Custom House. Perhaps\nthey expected to return to the south some day; and Ellen's knowledge was\nquite sufficient for a slave's condition. I was impatient to go to work and\nearn money, that I might change the uncertain position of my children. Mr.\nSands had not kept his promise to emancipate them. I had also been deceived\nabout Ellen. What security had I with regard to Benjamin? I felt that I had\nnone.\n\nI returned to my friend's house in an uneasy state of mind. In order to\nprotect my children, it was necessary that I should own myself. I called\nmyself free, and sometimes felt so; but I knew I was insecure. I sat down\nthat night and wrote a civil letter to Dr. Flint, asking him to state the\nlowest terms on which he would sell me; and as I belonged by law to his\ndaughter, I wrote to her also, making a similar request.\n\nSince my arrival at the north I had not been unmindful of my dear brother\nWilliam. I had made diligent inquiries for him, and having heard of him in\nBoston, I went thither. When I arrived there, I found he had gone to New\nBedford. I wrote to that place, and was informed he had gone on a whaling\nvoyage, and would not return for some months. I went back to New York to\nget employment near Ellen. I received an answer from Dr. Flint, which gave\nme no encouragement. He advised me to return and submit myself to my\nrightful owners, and then any request I might make would be granted. I lent\nthis letter to a friend, who lost it; otherwise I would present a copy to\nmy readers.\n\n\n\nXXXIII. A Home Found.\n\n\nMy greatest anxiety now was to obtain employment. My health was greatly\nimproved, though my limbs continued to trouble me with swelling whenever I\nwalked much. The greatest difficulty in my way was, that those who employed\nstrangers required a recommendation; and in my peculiar position, I could,\nof course, obtain no certificates from the families I had so faithfully\nserved.\n\nOne day an acquaintance told me of a lady who wanted a nurse for her babe,\nand I immediately applied for the situation. The lady told me she preferred\nto have one who had been a mother, and accustomed to the care of infants. I\ntold her I had nursed two babes of my own. She asked me many questions,\nbut, to my great relief, did not require a recommendation from my former\nemployers. She told me she was an English woman, and that was a pleasant\ncircumstance to me, because I had heard they had less prejudice against\ncolor than Americans entertained. It was agreed that we should try each\nother for a week. The trial proved satisfactory to both parties, and I was\nengaged for a month.\n\nThe heavenly Father had been most merciful to me in leading me to this\nplace. Mrs. Bruce was a kind and gentle lady, and proved a true and\nsympathizing friend. Before the stipulated month expired, the necessity of\npassing up and down stairs frequently, caused my limbs to swell so\npainfully, that I became unable to perform my duties. Many ladies would\nhave thoughtlessly discharged me; but Mrs. Bruce made arrangements to save\nme steps, and employed a physician to attend upon me. I had not yet told\nher that I was a fugitive slave. She noticed that I was often sad, and\nkindly inquired the cause. I spoke of being separated from my children, and\nfrom relatives who were dear to me; but I did not mention the constant\nfeeling of insecurity which oppressed my spirits. I longed for some one to\nconfide it; but I had been so deceived by white people, that I had lost all\nconfidence in them. If they spoke kind words to me, I thought it was for\nsome selfish purpose. I had entered this family with the distrustful\nfeelings I had brought with me out of slavery; but ere six months had\npassed, I found that the gentle deportment of Mrs. Bruce and the smiles of\nher lovely babe were thawing my chilled heart. My narrow mind also began to\nexpand under the influences of her intelligent conversation, and the\nopportunities for reading, which were gladly allowed me whenever I had\nleisure from my duties. I gradually became more energetic and more\ncheerful.\n\nThe old feeling of insecurity, especially with regard to my children, often\nthrew its dark shadow across my sunshine. Mrs. Bruce offered me a home for\nEllen; but pleasant as it would have been, I did not dare to accept it, for\nfear of offending the Hobbs family. Their knowledge of my precarious\nsituation placed me in their power; and I felt that it was important for me\nto keep on the right side of them, till, by dint of labor and economy, I\ncould make a home for my children. I was far from feeling satisfied with\nEllen's situation. She was not well cared for. She sometimes came to New\nYork to visit me; but she generally brought a request from Mrs. Hobbs that\nI would buy her a pair of shoes, or some article of clothing. This was\naccompanied by a promise of payment when Mr. Hobbs's salary at the Custom\nHouse became due; but some how or other the pay-day never came. Thus many\ndollars of my earnings were expended to keep my child comfortably clothed.\nThat, however, was a slight trouble, compared with the fear that their\npecuniary embarrassments might induce them to sell my precious young\ndaughter. I knew they were in constant communication with Southerners, and\nhad frequent opportunities to do it. I have stated that when Dr. Flint put\nEllen in jail, at two years old, she had an inflammation of the eyes,\noccasioned by measles. This disease still troubled her; and kind Mrs. Bruce\nproposed that she should come to New York for a while, to be under the care\nof Dr. Elliott, a well known oculist. It did not occur to me that there was\nany thing improper in a mother's making such a request; but Mrs. Hobbs was\nvery angry, and refused to let her go. Situated as I was, it was not\npolitic to insist upon it. I made no complaint, but I longed to be entirely\nfree to act a mother's part towards my children. The next time I went over\nto Brooklyn, Mrs. Hobbs, as if to apologize for her anger, told me she had\nemployed her own physician to attend to Ellen's eyes, and that she had\nrefused my request because she did not consider it safe to trust her in New\nYork. I accepted the explanation in silence; but she had told me that my\nchild _belonged_ to her daughter, and I suspected that her real motive was\na fear of my conveying her property away from her. Perhaps I did her\ninjustice; but my knowledge of Southerners made it difficult for me to feel\notherwise.\n\nSweet and bitter were mixed in the cup of my life, and I was thankful that\nit had ceased to be entirely bitter. I loved Mrs. Bruce's babe. When it\nlaughed and crowed in my face, and twined its little tender arms\nconfidingly about my neck, it made me think of the time when Benny and\nEllen were babies, and my wounded heart was soothed. One bright morning, as\nI stood at the window, tossing baby in my arms, my attention was attracted\nby a young man in sailor's dress, who was closely observing every house as\nhe passed. I looked at him earnestly. Could it be my brother William? It\n_must_ be he--and yet, how changed! I placed the baby safely, flew down\nstairs, opened the front door, beckoned to the sailor, and in less than a\nminute I was clasped in my brother's arms. How much we had to tell each\nother! How we laughed, and how we cried, over each other's adventures! I\ntook him to Brooklyn, and again saw him with Ellen, the dear child whom he\nhad loved and tended so carefully, while I was shut up in my miserable den.\nHe staid in New York a week. His old feelings of affection for me and Ellen\nwere as lively as ever. There are no bonds so strong as those which are\nformed by suffering together.\n\n\n\nXXXIV. The Old Enemy Again.\n\n\nMy young mistress, Miss Emily Flint, did not return any answer to my letter\nrequesting her to consent to my being sold. But after a while, I received a\nreply, which purported to be written by her younger brother. In order\nrightly to enjoy the contents of this letter, the reader must bear in mind\nthat the Flint family supposed I had been at the north many years. They had\nno idea that I knew of the doctor's three excursions to New York in search\nof me; that I had heard his voice, when he came to borrow five hundred\ndollars for that purpose; and that I had seen him pass on his way to the\nsteamboat. Neither were they aware that all the particulars of aunt Nancy's\ndeath and burial were conveyed to me at the time they occurred. I have kept\nthe letter, of which I herewith subjoin a copy:--\n\n   Your letter to sister was received a few days ago. I gather from\n   it that you are desirous of returning to your native place, among\n   your friends and relatives. We were all gratified with the\n   contents of your letter; and let me assure you that if any\n   members of the family have had any feeling of resentment towards\n   you, they feel it no longer. We all sympathize with you in your\n   unfortunate condition, and are ready to do all in our power to\n   make you contented and happy. It is difficult for you to return\n   home as a free person. If you were purchased by your grandmother,\n   it is doubtful whether you would be permitted to remain, although\n   it would be lawful for you to do so. If a servant should be\n   allowed to purchase herself, after absenting herself so long from\n   her owners, and return free, it would have an injurious effect.\n   From your letter, I think your situation must be hard and\n   uncomfortable. Come home. You have it in your power to be\n   reinstated in our affections. We would receive you with open arms\n   and tears of joy. You need not apprehend any unkind treatment, as\n   we have not put ourselves to any trouble or expense to get you.\n   Had we done so, perhaps we should feel otherwise. You know my\n   sister was always attached to you, and that you were never\n   treated as a slave. You were never put to hard work, nor exposed\n   to field labor. On the contrary, you were taken into the house,\n   and treated as one of us, and almost as free; and we, at least,\n   felt that you were above disgracing yourself by running away.\n   Believing you may be induced to come home voluntarily has induced\n   me to write for my sister. The family will be rejoiced to see\n   you; and your poor old grandmother expressed a great desire to\n   have you come, when she heard your letter read. In her old age\n   she needs the consolation of having her children round her.\n   Doubtless you have heard of the death of your aunt. She was a\n   faithful servant, and a faithful member of the Episcopal church.\n   In her Christian life she taught us how to live--and, O, too high\n   the price of knowledge, she taught us how to die! Could you have\n   seen us round her death bed, with her mother, all mingling our\n   tears in one common stream, you would have thought the same\n   heartfelt tie existed between a master and his servant, as\n   between a mother and her child. But this subject is too painful\n   to dwell upon. I must bring my letter to a close. If you are\n   contented to stay away from your old grandmother, your child, and\n   the friends who love you, stay where you are. We shall never\n   trouble ourselves to apprehend you. But should you prefer to come\n   home, we will do all that we can to make you happy. If you do not\n   wish to remain in the family, I know that father, by our\n   persuasion, will be induced to let you be purchased by any person\n   you may choose in our community. You will please answer this as\n   soon as possible, and let us know your decision. Sister sends\n   much love to you. In the mean time believe me your sincere friend\n   and well wisher.\n\nThis letter was signed by Emily's brother, who was as yet a mere lad. I\nknew, by the style, that it was not written by a person of his age, and\nthough the writing was disguised, I had been made too unhappy by it, in\nformer years, not to recognize at once the hand of Dr. Flint. O, the\nhypocrisy of slaveholders! Did the old fox suppose I was goose enough to go\ninto such a trap? Verily, he relied too much on \"the stupidity of the\nAfrican race.\" I did not return the family of Flints any thanks for their\ncordial invitation--a remissness for which I was, no doubt, charged with\nbase ingratitude.\n\nNot long afterwards I received a letter from one of my friends at the\nsouth, informing me that Dr. Flint was about to visit the north. The letter\nhad been delayed, and I supposed he might be already on the way. Mrs. Bruce\ndid not know I was a fugitive. I told her that important business called me\nto Boston, where my brother then was, and asked permission to bring a\nfriend to supply my place as nurse, for a fortnight. I started on my\njourney immediately; and as soon as I arrived, I wrote to my grandmother\nthat if Benny came, he must be sent to Boston. I knew she was only waiting\nfor a good chance to send him north, and, fortunately, she had the legal\npower to do so, without asking leave of any body. She was a free woman; and\nwhen my children were purchased, Mr. Sands preferred to have the bill of\nsale drawn up in her name. It was conjectured that he advanced the money,\nbut it was not known. At the south, a gentleman may have a shoal of colored\nchildren without any disgrace; but if he is known to purchase them, with\nthe view of setting them free, the example is thought to be dangerous to\ntheir \"peculiar institution,\" and he becomes unpopular.\n\nThere was a good opportunity to send Benny in a vessel coming directly to\nNew York. He was put on board with a letter to a friend, who was requested\nto see him off to Boston. Early one morning, there was a loud rap at my\ndoor, and in rushed Benjamin, all out of breath. \"O mother!\" he exclaimed,\n\"here I am! I run all the way; and I come all alone. How d'you do?\"\n\nO reader, can you imagine my joy? No, you cannot, unless you have been a\nslave mother. Benjamin rattled away as fast as his tongue could go.\n\"Mother, why don't you bring Ellen here? I went over to Brooklyn to see\nher, and she felt very bad when I bid her good by. She said, 'O Ben, I wish\nI was going too.' I thought she'd know ever so much; but she don't know so\nmuch as I do; for I can read, and she can't. And, mother, I lost all my\nclothes coming. What can I do to get some more? I 'spose free boys can get\nalong here at the north as well as white boys.\"\n\nI did not like to tell the sanguine, happy little fellow how much he was\nmistaken. I took him to a tailor, and procured a change of clothes. The\nrest of the day was spent in mutual asking and answering of questions, with\nthe wish constantly repeated that the good old grandmother was with us, and\nfrequent injunctions from Benny to write to her immediately, and be sure to\ntell her every thing about his voyage, and his journey to Boston.\n\nDr. Flint made his visit to New York, and made every exertion to call upon\nme, and invite me to return with him, but not being able to ascertain where\nI was, his hospitable intentions were frustrated, and the affectionate\nfamily, who were waiting for me with \"open arms,\" were doomed to\ndisappointment.\n\nAs soon as I knew he was safely at home, I placed Benjamin in the care of\nmy brother William, and returned to Mrs. Bruce. There I remained through\nthe winter and spring, endeavoring to perform my duties faithfully, and\nfinding a good degree of happiness in the attractions of baby Mary, the\nconsiderate kindness of her excellent mother, and occasional interviews\nwith my darling daughter.\n\nBut when summer came, the old feeling of insecurity haunted me. It was\nnecessary for me to take little Mary out daily, for exercise and fresh air,\nand the city was swarming with Southerners, some of whom might recognize\nme. Hot weather brings out snakes and slaveholders, and I like one class of\nthe venomous creatures as little as I do the other. What a comfort it is,\nto be free to _say_ so!\n\n\n\nXXXV. Prejudice Against Color.\n\n\nIt was a relief to my mind to see preparations for leaving the city. We\nwent to Albany in the steamboat Knickerbocker. When the gong sounded for\ntea, Mrs. Bruce said, \"Linda, it is late, and you and baby had better come\nto the table with me.\" I replied, \"I know it is time baby had her supper,\nbut I had rather not go with you, if you please. I am afraid of being\ninsulted.\" \"O no, not if you are with _me_,\" she said. I saw several white\nnurses go with their ladies, and I ventured to do the same. We were at the\nextreme end of the table. I was no sooner seated, than a gruff voice said,\n\"Get up! You know you are not allowed to sit here.\" I looked up, and, to my\nastonishment and indignation, saw that the speaker was a colored man. If\nhis office required him to enforce the by-laws of the boat, he might, at\nleast, have done it politely. I replied, \"I shall not get up, unless the\ncaptain comes and takes me up.\" No cup of tea was offered me, but Mrs.\nBruce handed me hers and called for another. I looked to see whether the\nother nurses were treated in a similar manner. They were all properly\nwaited on.\n\nNext morning, when we stopped at Troy for breakfast, every body was making\na rush for the table. Mrs. Bruce said, \"Take my arm, Linda, and we'll go in\ntogether.\" The landlord heard her, and said, \"Madam, will you allow your\nnurse and baby to take breakfast with my family?\" I knew this was to be\nattributed to my complexion; but he spoke courteously, and therefore I did\nnot mind it.\n\nAt Saratoga we found the United States Hotel crowded, and Mr. Bruce took\none of the cottages belonging to the hotel. I had thought, with gladness,\nof going to the quiet of the country, where I should meet few people, but\nhere I found myself in the midst of a swarm of Southerners. I looked round\nme with fear and trembling, dreading to see some one who would recognize\nme. I was rejoiced to find that we were to stay but a short time.\n\nWe soon returned to New York, to make arrangements for spending the\nremainder of the summer at Rockaway. While the laundress was putting the\nclothes in order, I took an opportunity to go over to Brooklyn to see\nEllen. I met her going to a grocery store, and the first words she said,\nwere, \"O, mother, don't go to Mrs. Hobbs's. Her brother, Mr. Thorne, has\ncome from the south, and may be he'll tell where you are.\" I accepted the\nwarning. I told her I was going away with Mrs. Bruce the next day, and\nwould try to see her when I came back.\n\nBeing in servitude to the Anglo-Saxon race, I was not put into a \"Jim Crow\ncar,\" on our way to Rockaway, neither was I invited to ride through the\nstreets on the top of trunks in a truck; but every where I found the same\nmanifestations of that cruel prejudice, which so discourages the feelings,\nand represses the energies of the colored people. We reached Rockaway\nbefore dark, and put up at the Pavilion--a large hotel, beautifully\nsituated by the sea-side--a great resort of the fashionable world. Thirty\nor forty nurses were there, of a great variety of nations. Some of the\nladies had colored waiting-maids and coachmen, but I was the only nurse\ntinged with the blood of Africa. When the tea bell rang, I took little Mary\nand followed the other nurses. Supper was served in a long hall. A young\nman, who had the ordering of things, took the circuit of the table two or\nthree times, and finally pointed me to a seat at the lower end of it. As\nthere was but one chair, I sat down and took the child in my lap. Whereupon\nthe young man came to me and said, in the blandest manner possible, \"Will\nyou please to seat the little girl in the chair, and stand behind it and\nfeed her? After they have done, you will be shown to the kitchen, where you\nwill have a good supper.\"\n\nThis was the climax! I found it hard to preserve my self-control, when I\nlooked round, and saw women who were nurses, as I was, and only one shade\nlighter in complexion, eyeing me with a defiant look, as if my presence\nwere a contamination. However, I said nothing. I quietly took the child in\nmy arms, went to our room, and refused to go to the table again. Mr. Bruce\nordered meals to be sent to the room for little Mary and I. This answered\nfor a few days; but the waiters of the establishment were white, and they\nsoon began to complain, saying they were not hired to wait on negroes. The\nlandlord requested Mr. Bruce to send me down to my meals, because his\nservants rebelled against bringing them up, and the colored servants of\nother boarders were dissatisfied because all were not treated alike.\n\nMy answer was that the colored servants ought to be dissatisfied with\n_themselves_, for not having too much self-respect to submit to such\ntreatment; that there was no difference in the price of board for colored\nand white servants, and there was no justification for difference of\ntreatment. I staid a month after this, and finding I was resolved to stand\nup for my rights, they concluded to treat me well. Let every colored man\nand woman do this, and eventually we shall cease to be trampled under foot\nby our oppressors.\n\n\n\nXXXVI. The Hairbreadth Escape.\n\n\nAfter we returned to New York, I took the earliest opportunity to go and\nsee Ellen. I asked to have her called down stairs; for I supposed Mrs.\nHobbs's southern brother might still be there, and I was desirous to avoid\nseeing him, if possible. But Mrs. Hobbs came to the kitchen, and insisted\non my going up stairs. \"My brother wants to see you,\" said she, \"and he is\nsorry you seem to shun him. He knows you are living in New York. He told me\nto say to you that he owes thanks to good old aunt Martha for too many\nlittle acts of kindness for him to be base enough to betray her\ngrandchild.\"\n\nThis Mr. Thorne had become poor and reckless long before he left the south,\nand such persons had much rather go to one of the faithful old slaves to\nborrow a dollar, or get a good dinner, than to go to one whom they consider\nan equal. It was such acts of kindness as these for which he professed to\nfeel grateful to my grandmother. I wished he had kept at a distance, but as\nhe was here, and knew where I was, I concluded there was nothing to be\ngained by trying to avoid him; on the contrary, it might be the means of\nexciting his ill will. I followed his sister up stairs. He met me in a very\nfriendly manner, congratulated me on my escape from slavery, and hoped I\nhad a good place, where I felt happy.\n\nI continued to visit Ellen as often as I could. She, good thoughtful child,\nnever forgot my hazardous situation, but always kept a vigilant lookout for\nmy safety. She never made any complaint about her own inconveniences and\ntroubles; but a mother's observing eye easily perceived that she was not\nhappy. On the occasion of one of my visits I found her unusually serious.\nWhen I asked her what was the matter, she said nothing was the matter. But\nI insisted upon knowing what made her look so very grave. Finally, I\nascertained that she felt troubled about the dissipation that was\ncontinually going on in the house. She was sent to the store very often for\nrum and brandy, and she felt ashamed to ask for it so often; and Mr. Hobbs\nand Mr. Thorne drank a great deal, and their hands trembled so that they\nhad to call her to pour out the liquor for them. \"But for all that,\" said\nshe, \"Mr. Hobbs is good to me, and I can't help liking him. I feel sorry\nfor him.\" I tried to comfort her, by telling her that I had laid up a\nhundred dollars, and that before long I hoped to be able to give her and\nBenjamin a home, and send them to school. She was always desirous not to\nadd to my troubles more than she could help, and I did not discover till\nyears afterwards that Mr. Thorne's intemperance was not the only annoyance\nshe suffered from him. Though he professed too much gratitude to my\ngrandmother to injure any of her descendants, he had poured vile language\ninto the ears of her innocent great-grandchild.\n\nI usually went to Brooklyn to spend Sunday afternoon. One Sunday, I found\nEllen anxiously waiting for me near the house. \"O, mother,\" said she, \"I've\nbeen waiting for you this long time. I'm afraid Mr. Thorne has written to\ntell Dr. Flint where you are. Make haste and come in. Mrs. Hobbs will tell\nyou all about it!\"\n\nThe story was soon told. While the children were playing in the grape-vine\narbor, the day before, Mr. Thorne came out with a letter in his hand, which\nhe tore up and scattered about. Ellen was sweeping the yard at the time,\nand having her mind full of suspicions of him, she picked up the pieces and\ncarried them to the children, saying, \"I wonder who Mr. Thorne has been\nwriting to.\"\n\n\"I'm sure I don't know, and don't care,\" replied the oldest of the\nchildren; \"and I don't see how it concerns you.\"\n\n\"But it does concern me,\" replied Ellen; \"for I'm afraid he's been\nwriting to the south about my mother.\"\n\nThey laughed at her, and called her a silly thing, but good-naturedly put\nthe fragments of writing together, in order to read them to her. They were\nno sooner arranged, than the little girl exclaimed, \"I declare, Ellen, I\nbelieve you are right.\"\n\nThe contents of Mr. Thorne's letter, as nearly as I can remember, were as\nfollows: \"I have seen your slave, Linda, and conversed with her. She can be\ntaken very easily, if you manage prudently. There are enough of us here to\nswear to her identity as your property. I am a patriot, a lover of my\ncountry, and I do this as an act of justice to the laws.\" He concluded by\ninforming the doctor of the street and number where I lived. The children\ncarried the pieces to Mrs. Hobbs, who immediately went to her brother's\nroom for an explanation. He was not to be found. The servants said they saw\nhim go out with a letter in his hand, and they supposed he had gone to the\npost office. The natural inference was, that he had sent to Dr. Flint a\ncopy of those fragments. When he returned, his sister accused him of it,\nand he did not deny the charge. He went immediately to his room, and the\nnext morning he was missing. He had gone over to New York, before any of\nthe family were astir.\n\nIt was evident that I had no time to lose; and I hastened back to the city\nwith a heavy heart. Again I was to be torn from a comfortable home, and all\nmy plans for the welfare of my children were to be frustrated by that demon\nSlavery! I now regretted that I never told Mrs. Bruce my story. I had not\nconcealed it merely on account of being a fugitive; that would have made\nher anxious, but it would have excited sympathy in her kind heart. I valued\nher good opinion, and I was afraid of losing it, if I told her all the\nparticulars of my sad story. But now I felt that it was necessary for her\nto know how I was situated. I had once left her abruptly, without\nexplaining the reason, and it would not be proper to do it again. I went\nhome resolved to tell her in the morning. But the sadness of my face\nattracted her attention, and, in answer to her kind inquiries, I poured out\nmy full heart to her, before bed time. She listened with true womanly\nsympathy, and told me she would do all she could to protect me. How my\nheart blessed her!\n\nEarly the next morning, Judge Vanderpool and Lawyer Hopper were consulted.\nThey said I had better leave the city at once, as the risk would be great\nif the case came to trial. Mrs. Bruce took me in a carriage to the house of\none of her friends, where she assured me I should be safe until my brother\ncould arrive, which would be in a few days. In the interval my thoughts\nwere much occupied with Ellen. She was mine by birth, and she was also mine\nby Southern law, since my grandmother held the bill of sale that made her\nso. I did not feel that she was safe unless I had her with me. Mrs. Hobbs,\nwho felt badly about her brother's treachery, yielded to my entreaties, on\ncondition that she should return in ten days. I avoided making any promise.\nShe came to me clad in very thin garments, all outgrown, and with a school\nsatchel on her arm, containing a few articles. It was late in October, and\nI knew the child must suffer; and not daring to go out in the streets to\npurchase any thing, I took off my own flannel skirt and converted it into\none for her. Kind Mrs. Bruce came to bid me good by, and when she saw that\nI had taken off my clothing for my child, the tears came to her eyes. She\nsaid, \"Wait for me, Linda,\" and went out. She soon returned with a nice\nwarm shawl and hood for Ellen. Truly, of such souls as hers are the kingdom\nof heaven.\n\nMy brother reached New York on Wednesday. Lawyer Hopper advised us to go to\nBoston by the Stonington route, as there was less Southern travel in that\ndirection. Mrs. Bruce directed her servants to tell all inquirers that I\nformerly lived there, but had gone from the city. We reached the steamboat\nRhode Island in safety. That boat employed colored hands, but I knew that\ncolored passengers were not admitted to the cabin. I was very desirous for\nthe seclusion of the cabin, not only on account of exposure to the night\nair, but also to avoid observation. Lawyer Hopper was waiting on board for\nus. He spoke to the stewardess, and asked, as a particular favor, that she\nwould treat us well. He said to me, \"Go and speak to the captain yourself\nby and by. Take your little girl with you, and I am sure that he will not\nlet her sleep on deck.\" With these kind words and a shake of the hand he\ndeparted.\n\nThe boat was soon on her way, bearing me rapidly from the friendly home\nwhere I had hoped to find security and rest. My brother had left me to\npurchase the tickets, thinking that I might have better success than he\nwould. When the stewardess came to me, I paid what she asked, and she gave\nme three tickets with clipped corners. In the most unsophisticated manner I\nsaid, \"You have made a mistake; I asked you for cabin tickets. I cannot\npossibly consent to sleep on deck with my little daughter.\" She assured me\nthere was no mistake. She said on some of the routes colored people were\nallowed to sleep in the cabin, but not on this route, which was much\ntravelled by the wealthy. I asked her to show me to the captain's office,\nand she said she would after tea. When the time came, I took Ellen by the\nhand and went to the captain, politely requesting him to change our\ntickets, as we should be very uncomfortable on deck. He said it was\ncontrary to their custom, but he would see that we had berths below; he\nwould also try to obtain comfortable seats for us in the cars; of that he\nwas not certain, but he would speak to the conductor about it, when the\nboat arrived. I thanked him, and returned to the ladies' cabin. He came\nafterwards and told me that the conductor of the cars was on board, that he\nhad spoken to him, and he had promised to take care of us. I was very much\nsurprised at receiving so much kindness. I don't know whether the pleasing\nface of my little girl had won his heart, or whether the stewardess\ninferred from Lawyer Hopper's manner that I was a fugitive, and had pleaded\nwith him in my behalf.\n\nWhen the boat arrived at Stonington, the conductor kept his promise, and\nshowed us to seats in the first car, nearest the engine. He asked us to\ntake seats next the door, but as he passed through, we ventured to move on\ntoward the other end of the car. No incivility was offered us, and we\nreached Boston in safety.\n\nThe day after my arrival was one of the happiest of my life. I felt as if I\nwas beyond the reach of the bloodhounds; and, for the first time during\nmany years, I had both my children together with me. They greatly enjoyed\ntheir reunion, and laughed and chatted merrily. I watched them with a\nswelling heart. Their every motion delighted me.\n\nI could not feel safe in New York, and I accepted the offer of a friend,\nthat we should share expenses and keep house together. I represented to\nMrs. Hobbs that Ellen must have some schooling, and must remain with me for\nthat purpose. She felt ashamed of being unable to read or spell at her age,\nso instead of sending her to school with Benny, I instructed her myself\ntill she was fitted to enter an intermediate school. The winter passed\npleasantly, while I was busy with my needle, and my children with their\nbooks.\n\n\n\nXXXVII. A Visit To England\n\n\nIn the spring, sad news came to me. Mrs. Bruce was dead. Never again, in\nthis world, should I see her gentle face, or hear her sympathizing voice. I\nhad lost an excellent friend, and little Mary had lost a tender mother. Mr.\nBruce wished the child to visit some of her mother's relatives in England,\nand he was desirous that I should take charge of her. The little motherless\none was accustomed to me, and attached to me, and I thought she would be\nhappier in my care than in that of a stranger. I could also earn more in\nthis way than I could by my needle. So I put Benny to a trade, and left\nEllen to remain in the house with my friend and go to school.\n\nWe sailed from New York, and arrived in Liverpool after a pleasant voyage\nof twelve days. We proceeded directly to London, and took lodgings at the\nAdelaide Hotel. The supper seemed to me less luxurious than those I had\nseen in American hotels; but my situation was indescribably more pleasant.\nFor the first time in my life I was in a place where I was treated\naccording to my deportment, without reference to my complexion. I felt as\nif a great millstone had been lifted from my breast. Ensconced in a\npleasant room, with my dear little charge, I laid my head on my pillow, for\nthe first time, with the delightful consciousness of pure, unadulterated\nfreedom.\n\nAs I had constant care of the child, I had little opportunity to see the\nwonders of that great city; but I watched the tide of life that flowed\nthrough the streets, and found it a strange contrast to the stagnation in\nour Southern towns. Mr. Bruce took his little daughter to spend some days\nwith friends in Oxford Crescent, and of course it was necessary for me to\naccompany her. I had heard much of the systematic method of English\neducation, and I was very desirous that my dear Mary should steer straight\nin the midst of so much propriety. I closely observed her little playmates\nand their nurses, being ready to take any lessons in the science of good\nmanagement. The children were more rosy than American children, but I did\nnot see that they differed materially in other respects. They were like all\nchildren--sometimes docile and sometimes wayward.\n\nWe next went to Steventon, in Berkshire. It was a small town, said to be\nthe poorest in the county. I saw men working in the fields for six\nshillings, and seven shillings, a week, and women for sixpence, and\nsevenpence, a day, out of which they boarded themselves. Of course they\nlived in the most primitive manner; it could not be otherwise, where a\nwoman's wages for an entire day were not sufficient to buy a pound of meat.\nThey paid very low rents, and their clothes were made of the cheapest\nfabrics, though much better than could have been procured in the United\nStates for the same money. I had heard much about the oppression of the\npoor in Europe. The people I saw around me were, many of them, among the\npoorest poor. But when I visited them in their little thatched cottages, I\nfelt that the condition of even the meanest and most ignorant among them\nwas vastly superior to the condition of the most favored slaves in America.\nThey labored hard; but they were not ordered out to toil while the stars\nwere in the sky, and driven and slashed by an overseer, through heat and\ncold, till the stars shone out again. Their homes were very humble; but\nthey were protected by law. No insolent patrols could come, in the dead of\nnight, and flog them at their pleasure. The father, when he closed his\ncottage door, felt safe with his family around him. No master or overseer\ncould come and take from him his wife, or his daughter. They must separate\nto earn their living; but the parents knew where their children were going,\nand could communicate with them by letters. The relations of husband and\nwife, parent and child, were too sacred for the richest noble in the land\nto violate with impunity. Much was being done to enlighten these poor\npeople. Schools were established among them, and benevolent societies were\nactive in efforts to ameliorate their condition. There was no law\nforbidding them to learn to read and write; and if they helped each other\nin spelling out the Bible, they were in no danger of thirty-nine lashes, as\nwas the case with myself and poor, pious, old uncle Fred. I repeat that the\nmost ignorant and the most destitute of these peasants was a thousand fold\nbetter off than the most pampered American slave.\n\nI do not deny that the poor are oppressed in Europe. I am not disposed to\npaint their condition so rose-colored as the Hon. Miss Murray paints the\ncondition of the slaves in the United States. A small portion of _my_\nexperience would enable her to read her own pages with anointed eyes. If\nshe were to lay aside her title, and, instead of visiting among the\nfashionable, become domesticated, as a poor governess, on some plantation\nin Louisiana or Alabama, she would see and hear things that would make her\ntell quite a different story.\n\nMy visit to England is a memorable event in my life, from the fact of my\nhaving there received strong religious impressions. The contemptuous manner\nin which the communion had been administered to colored people, in my\nnative place; the church membership of Dr. Flint, and others like him; and\nthe buying and selling of slaves, by professed ministers of the gospel, had\ngiven me a prejudice against the Episcopal church. The whole service seemed\nto me a mockery and a sham. But my home in Steventon was in the family of a\nclergyman, who was a true disciple of Jesus. The beauty of his daily life\ninspired me with faith in the genuineness of Christian professions. Grace\nentered my heart, and I knelt at the communion table, I trust, in true\nhumility of soul.\n\nI remained abroad ten months, which was much longer than I had anticipated.\nDuring all that time, I never saw the slightest symptom of prejudice\nagainst color. Indeed, I entirely forgot it, till the time came for us to\nreturn to America.\n\n\n\nXXXVIII. Renewed Invitations To Go South.\n\n\nWe had a tedious winter passage, and from the distance spectres seemed to\nrise up on the shores of the United States. It is a sad feeling to be\nafraid of one's native country. We arrived in New York safely, and I\nhastened to Boston to look after my children. I found Ellen well, and\nimproving at her school; but Benny was not there to welcome me. He had been\nleft at a good place to learn a trade, and for several months every thing\nworked well. He was liked by the master, and was a favorite with his\nfellow-apprentices; but one day they accidentally discovered a fact they\nhad never before suspected--that he was colored! This at once transformed\nhim into a different being. Some of the apprentices were Americans, others\nAmerican-born Irish; and it was offensive to their dignity to have a\n\"nigger\" among them, after they had been told that he _was_ a \"nigger.\"\nThey began by treating him with silent scorn, and finding that he returned\nthe same, they resorted to insults and abuse. He was too spirited a boy to\nstand that, and he went off. Being desirous to do something to support\nhimself, and having no one to advise him, he shipped for a whaling voyage.\nWhen I received these tidings I shed many tears, and bitterly reproached\nmyself for having left him so long. But I had done it for the best, and now\nall I could do was to pray to the heavenly Father to guide and protect him.\n\nNot long after my return, I received the following letter from Miss Emily\nFlint, now Mrs. Dodge:--\n\n   In this you will recognize the hand of your friend and mistress.\n   Having heard that you had gone with a family to Europe, I have\n   waited to hear of your return to write to you. I should have\n   answered the letter you wrote to me long since, but as I could\n   not then act independently of my father, I knew there could be\n   nothing done satisfactory to you. There were persons here who\n   were willing to buy you and run the risk of getting you. To this\n   I would not consent. I have always been attached to you, and\n   would not like to see you the slave of another, or have unkind\n   treatment. I am married now, and can protect you. My husband\n   expects to move to Virginia this spring, where we think of\n   settling. I am very anxious that you should come and live with\n   me. If you are not willing to come, you may purchase yourself;\n   but I should prefer having you live with me. If you come, you\n   may, if you like, spend a month with your grandmother and\n   friends, then come to me in Norfolk, Virginia. Think this over,\n   and write as soon as possible, and let me know the conclusion.\n   Hoping that your children are well, I remain your friend and\n   mistress.\n\nOf course I did not write to return thanks for this cordial invitation. I\nfelt insulted to be thought stupid enough to be caught by such professions.\n\n   \"Come up into my parlor,\" said the spider to the fly;\n   \"Tis the prettiest little parlor that ever you did spy.\"\n\nIt was plain that Dr. Flint's family were apprised of my movements, since\nthey knew of my voyage to Europe. I expected to have further trouble from\nthem; but having eluded them thus far, I hoped to be as successful in\nfuture. The money I had earned, I was desirous to devote to the education\nof my children, and to secure a home for them. It seemed not only hard, but\nunjust, to pay for myself. I could not possibly regard myself as a piece of\nproperty. Moreover, I had worked many years without wages, and during that\ntime had been obliged to depend on my grandmother for many comforts in food\nand clothing. My children certainly belonged to me; but though Dr. Flint\nhad incurred no expense for their support, he had received a large sum of\nmoney for them. I knew the law would decide that I was his property, and\nwould probably still give his daughter a claim to my children; but I\nregarded such laws as the regulations of robbers, who had no rights that I\nwas bound to respect.\n\nThe Fugitive Slave Law had not then passed. The judges of Massachusetts had\nnot then stooped under chains to enter her courts of justice, so called. I\nknew my old master was rather skittish of Massachusetts. I relied on her\nlove of freedom, and felt safe on her soil. I am now aware that I honored\nthe old Commonwealth beyond her deserts.\n\n\n\nXXXIX. The Confession.\n\n\nFor two years my daughter and I supported ourselves comfortably in Boston.\nAt the end of that time, my brother William offered to send Ellen to a\nboarding school. It required a great effort for me to consent to part with\nher, for I had few near ties, and it was her presence that made my two\nlittle rooms seem home-like. But my judgment prevailed over my selfish\nfeelings. I made preparations for her departure. During the two years we\nhad lived together I had often resolved to tell her something about her\nfather; but I had never been able to muster sufficient courage. I had a\nshrinking dread of diminishing my child's love. I knew she must have\ncuriosity on the subject, but she had never asked a question. She was\nalways very careful not to say any thing to remind me of my troubles. Now\nthat she was going from me, I thought if I should die before she returned,\nshe might hear my story from some one who did not understand the palliating\ncircumstances; and that if she were entirely ignorant on the subject, her\nsensitive nature might receive a rude shock.\n\nWhen we retired for the night, she said, \"Mother, it is very hard to leave\nyou alone. I am almost sorry I am going, though I do want to improve\nmyself. But you will write to me often; won't you, mother?\"\n\nI did not throw my arms round her. I did not answer her. But in a calm,\nsolemn way, for it cost me great effort, I said, \"Listen to me, Ellen; I\nhave something to tell you!\" I recounted my early sufferings in slavery,\nand told her how nearly they had crushed me. I began to tell her how they\nhad driven me into a great sin, when she clasped me in her arms, and\nexclaimed, \"O, don't, mother! Please don't tell me any more.\"\n\nI said, \"But, my child, I want you to know about your father.\"\n\n\"I know all about it, mother,\" she replied; \"I am nothing to my father, and\nhe is nothing to me. All my love is for you. I was with him five months in\nWashington, and he never cared for me. He never spoke to me as he did to\nhis little Fanny. I knew all the time he was my father, for Fanny's nurse\ntold me so, but she said I must never tell any body, and I never did. I\nused to wish he would take me in his arms and kiss me, as he did Fanny; or\nthat he would sometimes smile at me, as he did at her. I thought if he was\nmy own father, he ought to love me. I was a little girl then, and didn't\nknow any better. But now I never think any thing about my father. All my\nlove is for you.\" She hugged me closer as she spoke, and I thanked God that\nthe knowledge I had so much dreaded to impart had not diminished the\naffection of my child. I had not the slightest idea she knew that portion\nof my history. If I had, I should have spoken to her long before; for my\npent-up feelings had often longed to pour themselves out to some one I\ncould trust. But I loved the dear girl better for the delicacy she had\nmanifested towards her unfortunate mother.\n\nThe next morning, she and her uncle started on their journey to the village\nin New York, where she was to be placed at school. It seemed as if all the\nsunshine had gone away. My little room was dreadfully lonely. I was\nthankful when a message came from a lady, accustomed to employ me,\nrequesting me to come and sew in her family for several weeks. On my\nreturn, I found a letter from brother William. He thought of opening an\nanti-slavery reading room in Rochester, and combining with it the sale of\nsome books and stationery; and he wanted me to unite with him. We tried it,\nbut it was not successful. We found warm anti-slavery friends there, but\nthe feeling was not general enough to support such an establishment. I\npassed nearly a year in the family of Isaac and Amy Post, practical\nbelievers in the Christian doctrine of human brotherhood. They measure a\nman's worth by his character, not by his complexion. The memory of those\nbeloved and honored friends will remain with me to my latest hour.\n\n\n\nXL. The Fugitive Slave Law.\n\n\nMy brother, being disappointed in his project, concluded to go to\nCalifornia; and it was agreed that Benjamin should go with him. Ellen liked\nher school, and was a great favorite there. They did not know her history,\nand she did not tell it, because she had no desire to make capital out of\ntheir sympathy. But when it was accidentally discovered that her mother was\na fugitive slave, every method was used to increase her advantages and\ndiminish her expenses.\n\nI was alone again. It was necessary for me to be earning money, and I\npreferred that it should be among those who knew me. On my return from\nRochester, I called at the house of Mr. Bruce, to see Mary, the darling\nlittle babe that had thawed my heart, when it was freezing into a cheerless\ndistrust of all my fellow-beings. She was growing a tall girl now, but I\nloved her always. Mr. Bruce had married again, and it was proposed that I\nshould become nurse to a new infant. I had but one hesitation, and that was\nfeeling of insecurity in New York, now greatly increased by the passage of\nthe Fugitive Slave Law. However, I resolved to try the experiment. I was\nagain fortunate in my employer. The new Mrs. Bruce was an American, brought\nup under aristocratic influences, and still living in the midst of them;\nbut if she had any prejudice against color, I was never made aware of it;\nand as for the system of slavery, she had a most hearty dislike of it. No\nsophistry of Southerners could blind her to its enormity. She was a person\nof excellent principles and a noble heart. To me, from that hour to the\npresent, she has been a true and sympathizing friend. Blessings be with her\nand hers!\n\nAbout the time that I reentered the Bruce family, an event occurred of\ndisastrous import to the colored people. The slave Hamlin, the first\nfugitive that came under the new law, was given up by the bloodhounds of\nthe north to the bloodhounds of the south. It was the beginning of a reign\nof terror to the colored population. The great city rushed on in its whirl\nof excitement, taking no note of the \"short and simple annals of the poor.\"\nBut while fashionables were listening to the thrilling voice of Jenny Lind\nin Metropolitan Hall, the thrilling voices of poor hunted colored people\nwent up, in an agony of supplication, to the Lord, from Zion's church. Many\nfamilies, who had lived in the city for twenty years, fled from it now.\nMany a poor washerwoman, who, by hard labor, had made herself a comfortable\nhome, was obliged to sacrifice her furniture, bid a hurried farewell to\nfriends, and seek her fortune among strangers in Canada. Many a wife\ndiscovered a secret she had never known before--that her husband was a\nfugitive, and must leave her to insure his own safety. Worse still, many a\nhusband discovered that his wife had fled from slavery years ago, and as\n\"the child follows the condition of its mother,\" the children of his love\nwere liable to be seized and carried into slavery. Every where, in those\nhumble homes, there was consternation and anguish. But what cared the\nlegislators of the \"dominant race\" for the blood they were crushing out of\ntrampled hearts?\n\nWhen my brother William spent his last evening with me, before he went to\nCalifornia, we talked nearly all the time of the distress brought on our\noppressed people by the passage of this iniquitous law; and never had I\nseen him manifest such bitterness of spirit, such stern hostility to our\noppressors. He was himself free from the operation of the law; for he did\nnot run from any Slaveholding State, being brought into the Free States by\nhis master. But I was subject to it; and so were hundreds of intelligent\nand industrious people all around us. I seldom ventured into the streets;\nand when it was necessary to do an errand for Mrs. Bruce, or any of the\nfamily, I went as much as possible through back streets and by-ways. What a\ndisgrace to a city calling itself free, that inhabitants, guiltless of\noffence, and seeking to perform their duties conscientiously, should be\ncondemned to live in such incessant fear, and have nowhere to turn for\nprotection! This state of things, of course, gave rise to many impromptu\nvigilance committees. Every colored person, and every friend of their\npersecuted race, kept their eyes wide open. Every evening I examined the\nnewspapers carefully, to see what Southerners had put up at the hotels. I\ndid this for my own sake, thinking my young mistress and her husband might\nbe among the list; I wished also to give information to others, if\nnecessary; for if many were \"running to and fro,\" I resolved that\n\"knowledge should be increased.\"\n\nThis brings up one of my Southern reminiscences, which I will here briefly\nrelate. I was somewhat acquainted with a slave named Luke, who belonged to\na wealthy man in our vicinity. His master died, leaving a son and daughter\nheirs to his large fortune. In the division of the slaves, Luke was\nincluded in the son's portion. This young man became a prey to the vices he\nwent to the north, to complete his education, he carried his vices with\nhim. He was brought home, deprived of the use of his limbs, by excessive\ndissipation. Luke was appointed to wait upon his bed-ridden master, whose\ndespotic habits were greatly increased by exasperation at his own\nhelplessness. He kept a cowhide beside him, and, for the most trivial\noccurrence, he would order his attendant to bare his back, and kneel beside\nthe couch, while he whipped him till his strength was exhausted. Some days\nhe was not allowed to wear any thing but his shirt, in order to be in\nreadiness to be flogged. A day seldom passed without his receiving more or\nless blows. If the slightest resistance was offered, the town constable was\nsent for to execute the punishment, and Luke learned from experience how\nmuch more the constable's strong arm was to be dreaded than the\ncomparatively feeble one of his master. The arm of his tyrant grew weaker,\nand was finally palsied; and then the constable's services were in constant\nrequisition. The fact that he was entirely dependent on Luke's care, and\nwas obliged to be tended like an infant, instead of inspiring any gratitude\nor compassion towards his poor slave, seemed only to increase his\nirritability and cruelty. As he lay there on his bed, a mere degraded wreck\nof manhood, he took into his head the strangest freaks of despotism; and if\nLuke hesitated to submit to his orders, the constable was immediately sent\nfor. Some of these freaks were of a nature too filthy to be repeated. When\nI fled from the house of bondage, I left poor Luke still chained to the\nbedside of this cruel and disgusting wretch.\n\nOne day, when I had been requested to do an errand for Mrs. Bruce, I was\nhurrying through back streets, as usual, when I saw a young man\napproaching, whose face was familiar to me. As he came nearer, I recognized\nLuke. I always rejoiced to see or hear of any one who had escaped from the\nblack pit; I was peculiarly glad to see him on Northern soil, though I no\nlonger called it _free_ soil. I well remembered what a desolate feeling it\nwas to be alone among strangers, and I went up to him and greeted him\ncordially. At first, he did not know me; but when I mentioned my name, he\nremembered all about me. I told him of the Fugitive Slave Law, and asked\nhim if he did not know that New York was a city of kidnappers.\n\nHe replied, \"De risk ain't so bad for me, as 'tis fur you. 'Cause I runned\naway from de speculator, and you runned away from de massa. Dem speculators\nvont spen dar money to come here fur a runaway, if dey ain't sartin sure to\nput dar hans right on him. An I tell you I's tuk good car 'bout dat. I had\ntoo hard times down dar, to let 'em ketch dis nigger.\"\n\nHe then told me of the advice he had received, and the plans he had laid. I\nasked if he had money enough to take him to Canada. \"'Pend upon it, I hab,\"\nhe replied. \"I tuk car fur dat. I'd bin workin all my days fur dem cussed\nwhites, an got no pay but kicks and cuffs. So I tought dis nigger had a\nright to money nuff to bring him to de Free States. Massa Henry he lib till\nebery body vish him dead; an ven he did die, I knowed de debbil would hab\nhim, an vouldn't vant him to bring his money 'long too. So I tuk some of\nhis bills, and put 'em in de pocket of his ole trousers. An ven he was\nburied, dis nigger ask fur dem ole trousers, an dey gub 'em to me.\" With a\nlow, chuckling laugh, he added, \"You see I didn't _steal_ it; dey _gub_ it\nto me. I tell you, I had mighty hard time to keep de speculator from findin\nit; but he didn't git it.\"\n\nThis is a fair specimen of how the moral sense is educated by slavery. When\na man has his wages stolen from him, year after year, and the laws sanction\nand enforce the theft, how can he be expected to have more regard to\nhonesty than has the man who robs him? I have become somewhat enlightened,\nbut I confess that I agree with poor, ignorant, much-abused Luke, in\nthinking he had a _right_ to that money, as a portion of his unpaid wages.\nHe went to Canada forthwith, and I have not since heard from him.\n\nAll that winter I lived in a state of anxiety. When I took the children out\nto breathe the air, I closely observed the countenances of all I met. I\ndreaded the approach of summer, when snakes and slaveholders make their\nappearance. I was, in fact, a slave in New York, as subject to slave laws\nas I had been in a Slave State. Strange incongruity in a State called free!\n\nSpring returned, and I received warning from the south that Dr. Flint knew\nof my return to my old place, and was making preparations to have me\ncaught. I learned afterwards that my dress, and that of Mrs. Bruce's\nchildren, had been described to him by some of the Northern tools, which\nslaveholders employ for their base purposes, and then indulge in sneers at\ntheir cupidity and mean servility.\n\nI immediately informed Mrs. Bruce of my danger, and she took prompt\nmeasures for my safety. My place as nurse could not be supplied\nimmediately, and this generous, sympathizing lady proposed that I should\ncarry her baby away. It was a comfort to me to have the child with me; for\nthe heart is reluctant to be torn away from every object it loves. But how\nfew mothers would have consented to have one of their own babes become a\nfugitive, for the sake of a poor, hunted nurse, on whom the legislators of\nthe country had let loose the bloodhounds! When I spoke of the sacrifice\nshe was making, in depriving herself of her dear baby, she replied, \"It is\nbetter for you to have baby with you, Linda; for if they get on your track,\nthey will be obliged to bring the child to me; and then, if there is a\npossibility of saving you, you shall be saved.\"\n\nThis lady had a very wealthy relative, a benevolent gentleman in many\nrespects, but aristocratic and pro-slavery. He remonstrated with her for\nharboring a fugitive slave; told her she was violating the laws of her\ncountry; and asked her if she was aware of the penalty. She replied, \"I am\nvery well aware of it. It is imprisonment and one thousand dollars fine.\nShame on my country that it _is_ so! I am ready to incur the penalty. I\nwill go to the state's prison, rather than have any poor victim torn from\n_my_ house, to be carried back to slavery.\"\n\nThe noble heart! The brave heart! The tears are in my eyes while I write of\nher. May the God of the helpless reward her for her sympathy with my\npersecuted people!\n\nI was sent into New England, where I was sheltered by the wife of a\nsenator, whom I shall always hold in grateful remembrance. This honorable\ngentleman would not have voted for the Fugitive Slave Law, as did the\nsenator in \"Uncle Tom's Cabin;\" on the contrary, he was strongly opposed to\nit; but he was enough under its influence to be afraid of having me remain\nin his house many hours. So I was sent into the country, where I remained a\nmonth with the baby. When it was supposed that Dr. Flint's emissaries had\nlost track of me, and given up the pursuit for the present, I returned to\nNew York.\n\n\n\nXLI. Free At Last.\n\n\nMrs. Bruce, and every member of her family, were exceedingly kind to me. I\nwas thankful for the blessings of my lot, yet I could not always wear a\ncheerful countenance. I was doing harm to no one; on the contrary, I was\ndoing all the good I could in my small way; yet I could never go out to\nbreathe God's free air without trepidation at my heart. This seemed hard;\nand I could not think it was a right state of things in any civilized\ncountry.\n\nFrom time to time I received news from my good old grandmother. She could\nnot write; but she employed others to write for her. The following is an\nextract from one of her last letters:--\n\n   Dear Daughter: I cannot hope to see you again on earth; but I\n   pray to God to unite us above, where pain will no more rack this\n   feeble body of mine; where sorrow and parting from my children\n   will be no more. God has promised these things if we are faithful\n   unto the end. My age and feeble health deprive me of going to\n   church now; but God is with me here at home. Thank your brother\n   for his kindness. Give much love to him, and tell him to remember\n   the Creator in the days of his youth, and strive to meet me in\n   the Father's kingdom. Love to Ellen and Benjamin. Don't neglect\n   him. Tell him for me, to be a good boy. Strive, my child, to\n   train them for God's children. May he protect and provide for\n   you, is the prayer of your loving old mother.\n\nThese letters both cheered and saddened me. I was always glad to have\ntidings from the kind, faithful old friend of my unhappy youth; but her\nmessages of love made my heart yearn to see her before she died, and I\nmourned over the fact that it was impossible. Some months after I returned\nfrom my flight to New England, I received a letter from her, in which she\nwrote, \"Dr. Flint is dead. He has left a distressed family. Poor old man! I\nhope he made his peace with God.\"\n\nI remembered how he had defrauded my grandmother of the hard earnings she\nhad loaned; how he had tried to cheat her out of the freedom her mistress\nhad promised her, and how he had persecuted her children; and I thought to\nmyself that she was a better Christian than I was, if she could entirely\nforgive him. I cannot say, with truth, that the news of my old master's\ndeath softened my feelings towards him. There are wrongs which even the\ngrave does not bury. The man was odious to me while he lived, and his\nmemory is odious now.\n\nHis departure from this world did not diminish my danger. He had threatened\nmy grandmother that his heirs should hold me in slavery after he was gone;\nthat I never should be free so long as a child of his survived. As for Mrs.\nFlint, I had seen her in deeper afflictions than I supposed the loss of her\nhusband would be, for she had buried several children; yet I never saw any\nsigns of softening in her heart. The doctor had died in embarrassed\ncircumstances, and had little to will to his heirs, except such property as\nhe was unable to grasp. I was well aware what I had to expect from the\nfamily of Flints; and my fears were confirmed by a letter from the south,\nwarning me to be on my guard, because Mrs. Flint openly declared that her\ndaughter could not afford to lose so valuable a slave as I was.\n\nI kept close watch of the newspapers for arrivals; but one Saturday night,\nbeing much occupied, I forgot to examine the Evening Express as usual. I\nwent down into the parlor for it, early in the morning, and found the boy\nabout to kindle a fire with it. I took it from him and examined the list of\narrivals. Reader, if you have never been a slave, you cannot imagine the\nacute sensation of suffering at my heart, when I read the names of Mr. and\nMrs. Dodge, at a hotel in Courtland Street. It was a third-rate hotel, and\nthat circumstance convinced me of the truth of what I had heard, that they\nwere short of funds and had need of my value, as _they_ valued me; and that\nwas by dollars and cents. I hastened with the paper to Mrs. Bruce. Her\nheart and hand were always open to every one in distress, and she always\nwarmly sympathized with mine. It was impossible to tell how near the enemy\nwas. He might have passed and repassed the house while we were sleeping. He\nmight at that moment be waiting to pounce upon me if I ventured out of\ndoors. I had never seen the husband of my young mistress, and therefore I\ncould not distinguish him from any other stranger. A carriage was hastily\nordered; and, closely veiled, I followed Mrs. Bruce, taking the baby again\nwith me into exile. After various turnings and crossings, and returnings,\nthe carriage stopped at the house of one of Mrs. Bruce's friends, where I\nwas kindly received. Mrs. Bruce returned immediately, to instruct the\ndomestics what to say if any one came to inquire for me.\n\nIt was lucky for me that the evening paper was not burned up before I had a\nchance to examine the list of arrivals. It was not long after Mrs. Bruce's\nreturn to her house, before several people came to inquire for me. One\ninquired for me, another asked for my daughter Ellen, and another said he\nhad a letter from my grandmother, which he was requested to deliver in\nperson.\n\nThey were told, \"She _has_ lived here, but she has left.\"\n\n\"How long ago?\"\n\n\"I don't know, sir.\"\n\n\"Do you know where she went?\"\n\n\"I do not, sir.\" And the door was closed.\n\nThis Mr. Dodge, who claimed me as his property, was originally a Yankee\npedler in the south; then he became a merchant, and finally a slaveholder.\nHe managed to get introduced into what was called the first society, and\nmarried Miss Emily Flint. A quarrel arose between him and her brother, and\nthe brother cowhided him. This led to a family feud, and he proposed to\nremove to Virginia. Dr. Flint left him no property, and his own means had\nbecome circumscribed, while a wife and children depended upon him for\nsupport. Under these circumstances, it was very natural that he should make\nan effort to put me into his pocket.\n\nI had a colored friend, a man from my native place, in whom I had the most\nimplicit confidence. I sent for him, and told him that Mr. and Mrs. Dodge\nhad arrived in New York. I proposed that he should call upon them to make\ninquiries about his friends at the south, with whom Dr. Flint's family were\nwell acquainted. He thought there was no impropriety in his doing so, and\nhe consented. He went to the hotel, and knocked at the door of Mr. Dodge's\nroom, which was opened by the gentleman himself, who gruffly inquired,\n\"What brought you here? How came you to know I was in the city?\"\n\n\"Your arrival was published in the evening papers, sir; and I called to ask\nMrs. Dodge about my friends at home. I didn't suppose it would give any\noffence.\"\n\n\"Where's that negro girl, that belongs to my wife?\"\n\n\"What girl, sir?\"\n\n\"You know well enough. I mean Linda, that ran away from Dr. Flint's\nplantation, some years ago. I dare say you've seen her, and know where she\nis.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir, I've seen her, and know where she is. She is out of your reach,\nsir.\"\n\n\"Tell me where she is, or bring her to me, and I will give her a chance to\nbuy her freedom.\"\n\n\"I don't think it would be of any use, sir. I have heard her say she would\ngo to the ends of the earth, rather than pay any man or woman for her\nfreedom, because she thinks she has a right to it. Besides, she couldn't do\nit, if she would, for she has spent her earnings to educate her children.\"\n\nThis made Mr. Dodge very angry, and some high words passed between them. My\nfriend was afraid to come where I was; but in the course of the day I\nreceived a note from him. I supposed they had not come from the south, in\nthe winter, for a pleasure excursion; and now the nature of their business\nwas very plain.\n\nMrs. Bruce came to me and entreated me to leave the city the next morning.\nShe said her house was watched, and it was possible that some clew to me\nmight be obtained. I refused to take her advice. She pleaded with an\nearnest tenderness, that ought to have moved me; but I was in a bitter,\ndisheartened mood. I was weary of flying from pillar to post. I had been\nchased during half my life, and it seemed as if the chase was never to end.\nThere I sat, in that great city, guiltless of crime, yet not daring to\nworship God in any of the churches. I heard the bells ringing for afternoon\nservice, and, with contemptuous sarcasm, I said, \"Will the preachers take\nfor their text, 'Proclaim liberty to the captive, and the opening of prison\ndoors to them that are bound'? or will they preach from the text, 'Do unto\nothers as ye would they should do unto you'?\" Oppressed Poles and\nHungarians could find a safe refuge in that city; John Mitchell was free to\nproclaim in the City Hall his desire for \"a plantation well stocked with\nslaves;\" but there I sat, an oppressed American, not daring to show my\nface. God forgive the black and bitter thoughts I indulged on that Sabbath\nday! The Scripture says, \"Oppression makes even a wise man mad;\" and I was\nnot wise.\n\nI had been told that Mr. Dodge said his wife had never signed away her\nright to my children, and if he could not get me, he would take them. This\nit was, more than any thing else, that roused such a tempest in my soul.\nBenjamin was with his uncle William in California, but my innocent young\ndaughter had come to spend a vacation with me. I thought of what I had\nsuffered in slavery at her age, and my heart was like a tiger's when a\nhunter tries to seize her young.\n\nDear Mrs. Bruce! I seem to see the expression of her face, as she turned\naway discouraged by my obstinate mood. Finding her expostulations\nunavailing, she sent Ellen to entreat me. When ten o'clock in the evening\narrived and Ellen had not returned, this watchful and unwearied friend\nbecame anxious. She came to us in a carriage, bringing a well-filled trunk\nfor my journey--trusting that by this time I would listen to reason. I\nyielded to her, as I ought to have done before.\n\nThe next day, baby and I set out in a heavy snow storm, bound for New\nEngland again. I received letters from the City of Iniquity, addressed to\nme under an assumed name. In a few days one came from Mrs. Bruce, informing\nme that my new master was still searching for me, and that she intended to\nput an end to this persecution by buying my freedom. I felt grateful for\nthe kindness that prompted this offer, but the idea was not so pleasant to\nme as might have been expected. The more my mind had become enlightened,\nthe more difficult it was for me to consider myself an article of property;\nand to pay money to those who had so grievously oppressed me seemed like\ntaking from my sufferings the glory of triumph. I wrote to Mrs. Bruce,\nthanking her, but saying that being sold from one owner to another seemed\ntoo much like slavery; that such a great obligation could not be easily\ncancelled; and that I preferred to go to my brother in California.\n\nWithout my knowledge, Mrs. Bruce employed a gentleman in New York to enter\ninto negotiations with Mr. Dodge. He proposed to pay three hundred dollars\ndown, if Mr. Dodge would sell me, and enter into obligations to relinquish\nall claim to me or my children forever after. He who called himself my\nmaster said he scorned so small an offer for such a valuable servant. The\ngentleman replied, \"You can do as you choose, sir. If you reject this offer\nyou will never get any thing; for the woman has friends who will convey her\nand her children out of the country.\"\n\nMr. Dodge concluded that \"half a loaf was better than no bread,\" and he\nagreed to the proffered terms. By the next mail I received this brief\nletter from Mrs. Bruce: \"I am rejoiced to tell you that the money for your\nfreedom has been paid to Mr. Dodge. Come home to-morrow. I long to see you\nand my sweet babe.\"\n\nMy brain reeled as I read these lines. A gentleman near me said, \"It's\ntrue; I have seen the bill of sale.\" \"The bill of sale!\" Those words struck\nme like a blow. So I was _sold_ at last! A human being _sold_ in the free\ncity of New York! The bill of sale is on record, and future generations\nwill learn from it that women were articles of traffic in New York, late in\nthe nineteenth century of the Christian religion. It may hereafter prove a\nuseful document to antiquaries, who are seeking to measure the progress of\ncivilization in the United States. I well know the value of that bit of\npaper; but much as I love freedom, I do not like to look upon it. I am\ndeeply grateful to the generous friend who procured it, but I despise the\nmiscreant who demanded payment for what never rightfully belonged to him or\nhis.\n\nI had objected to having my freedom bought, yet I must confess that when it\nwas done I felt as if a heavy load had been lifted from my weary shoulders.\nWhen I rode home in the cars I was no longer afraid to unveil my face and\nlook at people as they passed. I should have been glad to have met Daniel\nDodge himself; to have had him seen me and known me, that he might have\nmourned over the untoward circumstances which compelled him to sell me for\nthree hundred dollars.\n\nWhen I reached home, the arms of my benefactress were thrown round me, and\nour tears mingled. As soon as she could speak, she said, \"O Linda, I'm _so_\nglad it's all over! You wrote to me as if you thought you were going to be\ntransferred from one owner to another. But I did not buy you for your\nservices. I should have done just the same, if you had been going to sail\nfor California to-morrow. I should, at least, have the satisfaction of\nknowing that you left me a free woman.\"\n\nMy heart was exceedingly full. I remembered how my poor father had tried to\nbuy me, when I was a small child, and how he had been disappointed. I hoped\nhis spirit was rejoicing over me now. I remembered how my good old\ngrandmother had laid up her earnings to purchase me in later years, and how\noften her plans had been frustrated. How that faithful, loving old heart\nwould leap for joy, if she could look on me and my children now that we\nwere free! My relatives had been foiled in all their efforts, but God had\nraised me up a friend among strangers, who had bestowed on me the precious,\nlong-desired boon. Friend! It is a common word, often lightly used. Like\nother good and beautiful things, it may be tarnished by careless handling;\nbut when I speak of Mrs. Bruce as my friend, the word is sacred.\n\nMy grandmother lived to rejoice in my freedom; but not long after, a letter\ncame with a black seal. She had gone \"where the wicked cease from\ntroubling, and the weary are at rest.\"\n\nTime passed on, and a paper came to me from the south, containing an\nobituary notice of my uncle Phillip. It was the only case I ever knew of\nsuch an honor conferred upon a colored person. It was written by one of his\nfriends, and contained these words: \"Now that death has laid him low, they\ncall him a good man and a useful citizen; but what are eulogies to the\nblack man, when the world has faded from his vision? It does not require\nman's praise to obtain rest in God's kingdom.\" So they called a colored man\na _citizen_! Strange words to be uttered in that region!\n\nReader, my story ends with freedom; not in the usual way, with marriage. I\nand my children are now free! We are as free from the power of slaveholders\nas are the white people of the north; and though that, according to my\nideas, is not saying a great deal, it is a vast improvement in _my_\ncondition. The dream of my life is not yet realized. I do not sit with my\nchildren in a home of my own, I still long for a hearthstone of my own,\nhowever humble. I wish it for my children's sake far more than for my own.\nBut God so orders circumstances as to keep me with my friend Mrs. Bruce.\nLove, duty, gratitude, also bind me to her side. It is a privilege to serve\nher who pities my oppressed people, and who has bestowed the inestimable\nboon of freedom on me and my children.\n\nIt has been painful to me, in many ways, to recall the dreary years I\npassed in bondage. I would gladly forget them if I could. Yet the\nretrospection is not altogether without solace; for with those gloomy\nrecollections come tender memories of my good old grandmother, like light,\nfleecy clouds floating over a dark and troubled sea.\n\n\n\n\nAPPENDIX.\n\n\nThe following statement is from Amy Post, a member of the Society of\nFriends in the State of New York, well known and highly respected by\nfriends of the poor and the oppressed. As has been already stated, in the\npreceding pages, the author of this volume spent some time under her\nhospitable roof.\n\nL.M.C.\n\n   The author of this book is my highly-esteemed friend. If its\n   readers knew her as I know her, they could not fail to be deeply\n   interested in her story. She was a beloved inmate of our family\n   nearly the whole of the year 1849. She was introduced to us by\n   her affectionate and conscientious brother, who had previously\n   related to us some of the almost incredible events in his\n   sister's life. I immediately became much interested in Linda; for\n   her appearance was prepossessing, and her deportment indicated\n   remarkable delicacy of feeling and purity of thought.\n\n   As we became acquainted, she related to me, from time to time\n   some of the incidents in her bitter experiences as a slave-woman.\n   Though impelled by a natural craving for human sympathy, she\n   passed through a baptism of suffering, even in recounting her\n   trials to me, in private confidential conversations. The burden\n   of these memories lay heavily upon her spirit--naturally virtuous\n   and refined. I repeatedly urged her to consent to the publication\n   of her narrative; for I felt that it would arouse people to a\n   more earnest work for the disinthralment of millions still\n   remaining in that soul-crushing condition, which was so\n   unendurable to her. But her sensitive spirit shrank from\n   publicity. She said, \"You know a woman can whisper her cruel\n   wrongs in the ear of a dear friend much easier than she can\n   record them for the world to read.\" Even in talking with me, she\n   wept so much, and seemed to suffer such mental agony, that I felt\n   her story was too sacred to be drawn from her by inquisitive\n   questions, and I left her free to tell as much, or as little, as\n   she chose. Still, I urged upon her the duty of publishing her\n   experience, for the sake of the good it might do; and, at last,\n   she undertook the task.\n\n   Having been a slave so large a portion of her life, she is\n   unlearned; she is obliged to earn her living by her own labor,\n   and she has worked untiringly to procure education for her\n   children; several times she has been obliged to leave her\n   employments, in order to fly from the man-hunters and\n   woman-hunters of our land; but she pressed through all these\n   obstacles and overcame them. After the labors of the day were\n   over, she traced secretly and wearily, by the midnight lamp, a\n   truthful record of her eventful life.\n\n   This Empire State is a shabby place of refuge for the oppressed;\n   but here, through anxiety, turmoil, and despair, the freedom of\n   Linda and her children was finally secured, by the exertions of a\n   generous friend. She was grateful for the boon; but the idea of\n   having been _bought_ was always galling to a spirit that could\n   never acknowledge itself to be a chattel. She wrote to us thus,\n   soon after the event: \"I thank you for your kind expressions in\n   regard to my freedom; but the freedom I had before the money was\n   paid was dearer to me. God gave me _that_ freedom; but man put\n   God's image in the scales with the paltry sum of three hundred\n   dollars. I served for my liberty as faithfully as Jacob served\n   for Rachel. At the end, he had large possessions; but I was\n   robbed of my victory; I was obliged to resign my crown, to rid\n   myself of a tyrant.\"\n\n   Her story, as written by herself, cannot fail to interest the\n   reader. It is a sad illustration of the condition of this\n   country, which boasts of its civilization, while it sanctions\n   laws and customs which make the experiences of the present more\n   strange than any fictions of the past.\n\n   Amy Post. Rochester, N.Y., Oct. 30th, 1859.\n\nThe following testimonial is from a man who is now a highly respectable\ncolored citizen of Boston.\n\nL.M.C.\n\n   This narrative contains some incidents so extraordinary, that,\n   doubtless, many persons, under whose eyes it may chance to fall,\n   will be ready to believe that it is colored highly, to serve a\n   special purpose. But, however it may be regarded by the\n   incredulous, I know that it is full of living truths. I have been\n   well acquainted with the author from my boyhood. The\n   circumstances recounted in her history are perfectly familiar to\n   me. I knew of her treatment from her master; of the imprisonment\n   of her children; of their sale and redemption; of her seven\n   years' concealment; and of her subsequent escape to the North. I\n   am now a resident of Boston, and am a living witness to the truth\n   of this interesting narrative.\n\n   George W.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http:\/\/www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp:\/\/pglaf.org\/fundraising.

Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http:\/\/pglaf.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\nEach eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's\neBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,\ncompressed (zipped), HTML and others.\n\nCorrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over\nthe old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.\nVERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving\nnew filenames and etext numbers.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n\nEBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,\nare filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to\ndownload any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular\nsearch system you may utilize the following addresses and just\ndownload by the etext year.\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\/etext06\n\n    (Or \/etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,\n     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)\n\nEBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are\nfiled in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part\nof the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is\nidentical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single\ndigits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For\nexample an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\/1\/0\/2\/3\/10234\n\nor filename 24689 would be found at:\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\/2\/4\/6\/8\/24689\n\nAn alternative method of locating eBooks:\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\/GUTINDEX.ALL\n\n","id":728,"split":"train"}
