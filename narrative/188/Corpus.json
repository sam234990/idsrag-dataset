She was of a\nhelpless, fleshy build, with a frank, open countenance and an\ninnocent, diffident manner. Her eyes were large and patient, and in\nthem dwelt such a shadow of distress as only those who have looked\nsympathetically into the countenances of the distraught and helpless\npoor know anything about. Any one could see where the daughter behind\nher got the timidity and shamefacedness which now caused her to stand\nback and look indifferently away. She was a product of the fancy, the\nfeeling, the innate affection of the untutored but poetic mind of her\nmother combined with the gravity and poise which were characteristic\nof her father. Poverty was driving them. Together they presented so\nappealing a picture of honest necessity that even the clerk was\naffected.\n\n\"What is it you would like to do?\" he said.\n\n\"Maybe you have some cleaning or scrubbing,\" she replied, timidly.\n\"I could wash the floors.\"\n\nThe daughter, hearing the statement, turned uneasily, not because\nit irritated her to work, but because she hated people to guess at the\npoverty that made it necessary. The clerk, manlike, was affected by\nthe evidence of beauty in distress. The innocent helplessness of the\ndaughter made their lot seem hard indeed.\n\n\"Wait a moment,\" he said; and, stepping into a back office, he\ncalled the head housekeeper.\n\nThere was work to be done. The main staircase and parlor hall were\nunswept because of the absence of the regular scrub-woman.\n\n\"Is that her daughter with her?\" asked the housekeeper, who could\nsee them from where she was standing.\n\n\"Yes, I believe so.\"\n\n\"She might come this afternoon if she wants to. The girl helps her,\nI suppose?\"\n\n\"You go see the housekeeper,\" said the clerk, pleasantly, as he\ncame back to the desk. \"Right through there\"--pointing to a\nnear-by door. \"She'll arrange with you about it.\"\n\nA succession of misfortunes, of which this little scene might have\nbeen called the tragic culmination, had taken place in the life and\nfamily of William Gerhardt, a glass-blower by trade. Having suffered\nthe reverses so common in the lower walks of life, this man was forced\nto see his wife, his six children, and himself dependent for the\nnecessaries of life upon whatever windfall of fortune the morning of\neach recurring day might bring. He himself was sick in bed. His oldest\nboy, Sebastian, or \"Bass,\" as his associates transformed it, worked as\nan apprentice to a local freight-car builder, but received only four\ndollars a week. Genevieve, the oldest of the girls, was past eighteen,\nbut had not as yet been trained to any special work. The other\nchildren, George, aged fourteen; Martha, twelve; William ten, and\nVeronica, eight, were too young to do anything, and only made the\nproblem of existence the more complicated. Their one mainstay was the\nhome, which, barring a six-hundred-dollar mortgage, the father owned.\nHe had borrowed this money at a time when, having saved enough to buy\nthe house, he desired to add three rooms and a porch, and so make it\nlarge enough for them to live in. A few years were still to run on the\nmortgage, but times had been so bad that he had been forced to use up\nnot only the little he had saved to pay off the principal, but the\nannual interest also. Gerhardt was helpless, and the consciousness of\nhis precarious situation--the doctor's bill, the interest due\nupon the mortgage, together with the sums owed butcher and baker, who,\nthrough knowing him to be absolutely honest, had trusted him until\nthey could trust no longer--all these perplexities weighed upon\nhis mind and racked him so nervously as to delay his recovery.\n\nMrs. Gerhardt was no weakling. For a time she took in washing, what\nlittle she could get, devoting the intermediate hours to dressing the\nchildren, cooking, seeing that they got off to school, mending their\nclothes, waiting on her husband, and occasionally weeping. Not\ninfrequently she went personally to some new grocer, each time farther\nand farther away, and, starting an account with a little cash, would\nreceive credit until other grocers warned the philanthropist of his\nfolly. Corn was cheap. Sometimes she would make a kettle of lye\nhominy, and this would last, with scarcely anything else, for an\nentire week. Corn-meal also, when made into mush, was better than\nnothing, and this, with a little milk, made almost a feast. Potatoes\nfried was the nearest they ever came to luxurious food, and coffee was\nan infrequent treat. Coal was got by picking it up in buckets and\nbaskets along the maze of tracks in the near-by railroad yard. Wood,\nby similar journeys to surrounding lumber-yards. Thus they lived from\nday to day, each hour hoping that the father would get well and that\nthe glass-works would soon start up. But as the winter approached\nGerhardt began to feel desperate.\n\n\"I must get out of this now pretty soon,\" was the sturdy German's\nregular comment, and his anxiety found but weak expression in the\nmodest quality of his voice.\n\nTo add to all this trouble little Veronica took the measles, and,\nfor a few days, it was thought that she would die. The mother\nneglected everything else to hover over her and pray for the best.\nDoctor Ellwanger came every day, out of purely human sympathy, and\ngravely examined the child. The Lutheran minister, Pastor Wundt,\ncalled to offer the consolation of the Church. Both of these men\nbrought an atmosphere of grim ecclesiasticism into the house. They\nwere the black-garbed, sanctimonious emissaries of superior forces.\nMrs. Gerhardt felt as if she were going to lose her child, and watched\nsorrowfully by the cot-side. After three days the worst was over, but\nthere was no bread in the house. Sebastian's wages had been spent for\nmedicine. Only coal was free for the picking, and several times the\nchildren had been scared from the railroad yards. Mrs. Gerhardt\nthought of all the places to which she might apply, and despairingly\nhit upon the hotel. Now, by a miracle, she had her chance.\n\n\"How much do you charge?\" the housekeeper asked her.\n\nMrs. Gerhardt had not thought this would be left to her, but need\nemboldened her.\n\n\"Would a dollar a day be too much?\"\n\n\"No,\" said the housekeeper; \"there is only about three days' work\nto do every week. If you would come every afternoon you could do\nit.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" said the applicant. \"Shall we start to-day?\"\n\n\"Yes; if you'll come with me now I'll show you where the cleaning\nthings are.\"\n\nThe hotel, into which they were thus summarily introduced, was a\nrather remarkable specimen for the time and place. Columbus, being the\nState capital, and having a population of fifty thousand and a fair\npassenger traffic, was a good field for the hotel business, and the\nopportunity had been improved; so at least the Columbus people proudly\nthought. The structure, five stories in height, and of imposing\nproportions, stood at one corner of the central public square, where\nwere the Capitol building and principal stores. The lobby was large\nand had been recently redecorated. Both floor and wainscot were of\nwhite marble, kept shiny by frequent polishing. There was an imposing\nstaircase with hand-rails of walnut and toe-strips of brass. An\ninviting corner was devoted to a news and cigar-stand. Where the\nstaircase curved upward the clerk's desk and offices had been located,\nall done in hardwood and ornamented by novel gas-fixtures. One could\nsee through a door at one end of the lobby to the barbershop, with its\nchairs and array of shaving-mugs. Outside were usually two or three\nbuses, arriving or departing, in accordance with the movement of the\ntrains.\n\nTo this caravanserai came the best of the political and social\npatronage of the State. Several Governors had made it their permanent\nabiding place during their terms of office. The two United States\nSenators, whenever business called them to Columbus, invariably\nmaintained parlor chambers at the hotel. One of them, Senator Brander,\nwas looked upon by the proprietor as more or less of a permanent\nguest, because he was not only a resident of the city, but an\notherwise homeless bachelor. Other and more transient guests included\nCongressmen, State legislators and lobbyists, merchants, professional\nmen, and, after them, the whole raft of indescribables who, coming and\ngoing, make up the glow and stir of this kaleidoscopic world.\n\nMother and daughter, suddenly flung into this realm of superior\nbrightness, felt immeasurably overawed. They went about too timid to\ntouch anything for fear of giving offense. The great red-carpeted\nhallway, which they were set to sweep, had for them all the\nmagnificence of a palace; they kept their eyes down and spoke in their\nlowest tones. When it came to scrubbing the steps and polishing the\nbrass-work of the splendid stairs both needed to steel themselves, the\nmother against her timidity, the daughter against the shame at so\npublic an exposure. Wide beneath lay the imposing lobby, and men,\nlounging, smoking, passing constantly in and out, could see them\nboth.\n\n\"Isn't it fine?\" whispered Genevieve, and started nervously at the\nsound of her own voice.\n\n\"Yes,\" returned her mother, who, upon her knees, was wringing out\nher cloth with earnest but clumsy hands.\n\n\"It must cost a good deal to live here, don't you think?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said her mother. \"Don't forget to rub into these little\ncorners. Look here what you've left.\"\n\nJennie, mortified by this correction, fell earnestly to her task,\nand polished vigorously, without again daring to lift her eyes.\n\nWith painstaking diligence they worked downward until about five\no'clock; it was dark outside, and all the lobby was brightly lighted.\nNow they were very near the bottom of the stairway.\n\nThrough the big swinging doors there entered from the chilly world\nwithout a tall, distinguished, middle-aged gentleman, whose silk hat\nand loose military cape-coat marked him at once, among the crowd of\ngeneral idlers, as some one of importance. His face was of a dark and\nsolemn cast, but broad and sympathetic in its lines, and his bright\neyes were heavily shaded with thick, bushy, black eyebrows. Passing to\nthe desk he picked up the key that had already been laid out for him,\nand coming to the staircase, started up.\n\nThe middle-aged woman, scrubbing at his feet, he acknowledged not\nonly by walking around her, but by graciously waving his hand, as much\nas to say, \"Don't move for me.\"\n\nThe daughter, however, caught his eye by standing up, her troubled\nglance showing that she feared she was in his way.\n\nHe bowed and smiled pleasantly.\n\n\"You shouldn't have troubled yourself,\" he said.\n\nJennie only smiled.\n\nWhen he had reached the upper landing an impulsive sidewise glance\nassured him, more clearly than before, of her uncommonly prepossessing\nappearance. He noted the high, white forehead, with its smoothly\nparted and plaited hair. The eyes he saw were blue and the complexion\nfair. He had even time to admire the mouth and the full\ncheeks--above all, the well-rounded, graceful form, full of\nyouth, health, and that hopeful expectancy which to the middle-aged is\nso suggestive of all that is worth begging of Providence. Without\nanother look he went dignifiedly upon his way, but the impression of\nher charming personality went with him. This was the Hon. George\nSylvester Brander, junior Senator.\n\n\"Wasn't that a fine-looking man who went up just now?\" observed\nJennie a few moments later.\n\n\"Yes, he was,\" said her mother.\n\n\"He had a gold-headed cane.\"\n\n\"You mustn't stare at people when they pass,\" cautioned her mother,\nwisely. \"It isn't nice.\"\n\n\"I didn't stare at him,\" returned Jennie, innocently. \"He bowed to\nme.\"\n\n\"Well, don't you pay any attention to anybody,\" said her mother.\n\"They may not like it.\"\n\nJennie fell to her task in silence, but the glamor of the great\nworld was having its effect upon her senses. She could not help giving\near to the sounds, the brightness, the buzz of conversation and\nlaughter surrounding her. In one section of the parlor floor was the\ndining-room, and from the clink of dishes one could tell that supper\nwas being prepared. In another was the parlor proper, and there some\none came to play on the piano. That feeling of rest and relaxation\nwhich comes before the evening meal pervaded the place. It touched the\nheart of the innocent working-girl with hope, for hers were the years,\nand poverty could not as yet fill her young mind with cares. She\nrubbed diligently always, and sometimes forgot the troubled mother at\nher side, whose kindly eyes were becoming invested with crows' feet,\nand whose lips half repeated the hundred cares of the day. She could\nonly think that all of this was very fascinating, and wish that a\nportion of it might come to her.\n\nAt half-past five the housekeeper, remembering them, came and told\nthem that they might go. The fully finished stairway was relinquished\nby both with a sigh of relief, and, after putting their implements\naway, they hastened homeward, the mother, at least, pleased to think\nthat at last she had something to do.\n\nAs they passed several fine houses Jennie was again touched by that\nhalf-defined emotion which the unwonted novelty of the hotel life had\nengendered in her consciousness.\n\n\"Isn't it fine to be rich?\" she said.\n\n\"Yes,\" answered her mother, who was thinking of the suffering\nVeronica.\n\n\"Did you see what a big dining-room they had there?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nThey went on past the low cottages and among the dead leaves of the\nyear.\n\n\"I wish we were rich,\" murmured Jennie, half to herself.\n\n\"I don't know just what to do,\" confided her mother with a\nlong-drawn sigh. \"I don't believe there's a thing to eat in the\nhouse.\"\n\n\"Let's stop and see Mr. Bauman again,\" exclaimed Jennie, her\nnatural sympathies restored by the hopeless note in her mother's\nvoice.\n\n\"Do you think he would trust us any more?\"\n\n\"Let's tell him where we're working. I will.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said her mother, wearily.\n\nInto the small, dimly lighted grocery store, which was two blocks\nfrom their house, they ventured nervously. Mrs. Gerhardt was about to\nbegin, but Jennie spoke first.\n\n\"Will you let us have some bread to-night, and a little bacon?\nWe're working now at the Columbus House, and we'll be sure to pay you\nSaturday.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" added Mrs. Gerhardt, \"I have something to do.\"\n\nBauman, who had long supplied them before illness and trouble\nbegan, knew that they told the truth.\n\n\"How long have you been working there?\" he asked.\n\n\"Just this afternoon.\"\n\n\"You know, Mrs. Gerhardt,\" he said, \"how it is with me. I don't\nwant to refuse you. Mr. Gerhardt is good for it, but I am poor, too.\nTimes are hard,\" he explained further, \"I have my family to keep.\"\n\n\"Yes, I know,\" said Mrs. Gerhardt, weakly.\n\nHer old shoddy shawl hid her rough hands, red from the day's work,\nbut they were working nervously. Jennie stood by in strained\nsilence.\n\n\"Well,\" concluded Mr. Bauman, \"I guess it's all right this time. Do\nwhat you can for me Saturday.\"\n\nHe wrapped up the bread and bacon, and, handing Jennie the parcel,\nhe added, with a touch of cynicism:\n\n\"When you get money again I guess you'll go and trade somewhere\nelse.\"\n\n\"No,\" returned Mrs. Gerhardt; \"you know better than that.\" But she\nwas too nervous to parley long.\n\nThey went out into the shadowy street, and on past the low cottages\nto their own home.\n\n\"I wonder,\" said the mother, wearily, when they neared the door,\n\"if they've got any coal?\"\n\n\"Don't worry,\" said Jennie. \"If they haven't I'll go.\"\n\n\"A man run us away,\" was almost the first greeting that the\nperturbed George offered when the mother made her inquiry about the\ncoal. \"I got a little, though.\" he added. \"I threw it off a car.\"\n\nMrs. Gerhardt only smiled, but Jennie laughed.\n\n\"How is Veronica?\" she inquired.\n\n\"She seems to be sleeping,\" said the father. \"I gave her medicine\nagain at five.\"\n\nWhile the scanty meal was being prepared the mother went to the\nsick child's bedside, taking up another long night's vigil quite as a\nmatter of course.\n\nWhile the supper was being eaten Sebastian offered a suggestion,\nand his larger experience in social and commercial matters made his\nproposition worth considering. Though only a car-builder's apprentice,\nwithout any education except such as pertained to Lutheran doctrine,\nto which he objected very strongly, he was imbued with American color\nand energy. His transformed name of Bass suited him exactly. Tall,\nathletic, and well-featured for his age, he was a typical stripling of\nthe town. Already he had formulated a philosophy of life. To succeed\none must do something--one must associate, or at least seem to\nassociate, with those who were foremost in the world of\nappearances.\n\nFor this reason the young boy loved to hang about the Columbus\nHouse. It seemed to him that this hotel was the center and\ncircumference of all that was worth while in the social sense. He\nwould go down-town evenings, when he first secured money enough to buy\na decent suit of clothes, and stand around the hotel entrance with his\nfriends, kicking his heels, smoking a two-for-five-cent cigar,\npreening himself on his stylish appearance, and looking after the\ngirls. Others were there with him--town dandies and nobodies,\nyoung men who came there to get shaved or to drink a glass of whisky.\nAnd all of these he admired and sought to emulate. Clothes were the\nmain touchstone. If men wore nice clothes and had rings and pins,\nwhatever they did seemed appropriate. He wanted to be like them and to\nact like them, and so his experience of the more pointless forms of\nlife rapidly broadened.\n\n\"Why don't you get some of those hotel fellows to give you their\nlaundry?\" he asked of Jennie after she had related the afternoon's\nexperiences. \"It would be better than scrubbing the stairs.\"\n\n\"How do you get it?\" she replied.\n\n\"Why, ask the clerk, of course.\"\n\nThis plan struck Jennie as very much worth while.\n\n\"Don't you ever speak to me if you meet me around there,\" he\ncautioned her a little later, privately. \"Don't you let on that you\nknow me.\"\n\n\"Why?\" she asked, innocently.\n\n\"Well, you know why,\" he answered, having indicated before that\nwhen they looked so poor he did not want to be disgraced by having to\nown them as relatives. \"Just you go on by. Do you hear?\"\n\n\"All right,\" she returned, meekly, for although this youth was not\nmuch over a year her senior, his superior will dominated.\n\nThe next day on their way to the hotel she spoke of it to her\nmother.\n\n\"Bass said we might get some of the laundry of the men at the hotel\nto do.\"\n\nMrs. Gerhardt, whose mind had been straining all night at the\nproblem of adding something to the three dollars which her six\nafternoons would bring her, approved of the idea.\n\n\"So we might,\" she said. \"I'll ask that clerk.\"\n\nWhen they reached the hotel, however, no immediate opportunity\npresented itself. They worked on until late in the afternoon. Then, as\nfortune would have it, the housekeeper sent them in to scrub up the\nfloor behind the clerk's desk. That important individual felt very\nkindly toward mother and daughter. He liked the former's sweetly\ntroubled countenance and the latter's pretty face. So he listened\ngraciously when Mrs. Gerhardt ventured meekly to put the question\nwhich she had been revolving in her mind all the afternoon.\n\n\"Is there any gentleman here,\" she said, \"who would give me his\nwashing to do? I'd be so very much obliged for it.\"\n\nThe clerk looked at her, and again recognized that absolute want\nwas written all over her anxious face.\n\n\"Let's see,\" he answered, thinking of Senator Brander and Marshall\nHopkins. Both were charitable men, who would be more than glad to aid\na poor woman. \"You go up and see Senator Brander,\" he continued. \"He's\nin twenty-two. Here,\" he added, writing out the number, \"you go up and\ntell him I sent you.\"\n\nMrs. Gerhardt took the card with a tremor of gratefulness. Her eyes\nlooked the words she could not say.\n\n\"That's all right,\" said the clerk, observing her emotion. \"You go\nright up. You'll find him in his room now.\"\n\nWith the greatest diffidence Mrs. Gerhardt knocked at number\ntwenty-two. Jennie stood silently at her side.\n\nAfter a moment the door was opened, and in the full radiance of the\nbright room stood the Senator. Attired in a handsome smoking-coat, he\nlooked younger than at their first meeting.\n\n\"Well, madam,\" he said, recognizing the couple, and particularly\nthe daughter, \"what can I do for you?\"\n\nVery much abashed, the mother hesitated in her reply.\n\n\"We would like to know if you have any washing you could let us\nhave to do?\"\n\n\"Washing?\" he repeated after her, in a voice which had a peculiarly\nresonant quality. \"Washing? Come right in. Let me see.\"\n\nHe stepped aside with much grace, waved them in and closed the\ndoor. \"Let me see,\" he repeated, opening and closing drawer after\ndrawer of the massive black-walnut bureau. Jennie studied the room\nwith interest. Such an array of nicknacks and pretty things on mantel\nand dressing-case she had never seen before. The Senator's easy-chair,\nwith a green-shaded lamp beside it, the rich heavy carpet and the fine\nrugs upon the floor--what comfort, what luxury!\n\n\"Sit down; take those two chairs there,\" said the Senator,\ngraciously, disappearing into a closet.\n\nStill overawed, mother and daughter thought it more polite to\ndecline, but now the Senator had completed his researches and he\nreiterated his invitation. Very uncomfortably they yielded and took\nchairs.\n\n\"Is this your daughter?\" he continued, with a smile at Jennie.\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" said the mother; \"she's my oldest girl.\"\n\n\"Is your husband alive?\"\n\n\"What is his name?\"\n\n\"Where does he live?\"\n\nTo all of these questions Mrs. Gerhardt very humbly answered.\n\n\"How many children have you?\" he went on.\n\n\"Six,\" said Mrs. Gerhardt.\n\n\"Well,\" he returned, \"that's quite a family. You've certainly done\nyour duty to the nation.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" returned Mrs. Gerhardt, who was touched by his genial\nand interesting manner.\n\n\"And you say this is your oldest daughter?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"What does your husband do?\"\n\n\"He's a glass-blower. But he's sick now.\"\n\nDuring the colloquy Jennie's large blue eyes were wide with\ninterest. Whenever he looked at her she turned upon him such a frank,\nunsophisticated gaze, and smiled in such a vague, sweet way, that he\ncould not keep his eyes off of her for more than a minute of the\ntime.\n\n\"Well,\" he continued, sympathetically, \"that is too bad! I have\nsome washing here not very much but you are welcome to it. Next week\nthere may be more.\"\n\nHe went about now, stuffing articles of apparel into a blue cotton\nbag with a pretty design on the side.\n\n\"Do you want these any certain day?\" questioned Mrs. Gerhardt.\n\n\"No,\" he said, reflectively; \"any day next week will do.\"\n\nShe thanked him with a simple phrase, and started to go.\n\n\"Let me see,\" he said, stepping ahead of them and opening the door,\n\"you may bring them back Monday.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" said Mrs. Gerhardt. \"Thank you.\"\n\nThey went out and the Senator returned to his reading, but it was\nwith a peculiarly disturbed mind.\n\n\"Too bad,\" he said, closing his volume. \"There's something very\npathetic about those people.\" Jennie's spirit of wonder and\nappreciation was abroad in the room.\n\nMrs. Gerhardt and Jennie made their way anew through the shadowy\nstreets. They felt immeasurably encouraged by this fortunate\nventure.\n\n\"Didn't he have a fine room?\" whispered Jennie.\n\n\"Yes,\" answered the mother; \"he's a great man.\"\n\n\"He's a senator, isn't he?\" continued the daughter.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"It must be nice to be famous,\" said the girl, softly.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\n\nThe spirit of Jennie--who shall express it? This daughter of\npoverty, who was now to fetch and carry the laundry of this\ndistinguished citizen of Columbus, was a creature of a mellowness of\ntemperament which words can but vaguely suggest. There are natures\nborn to the inheritance of flesh that come without understanding, and\nthat go again without seeming to have wondered why. Life, so long as\nthey endure it, is a true wonderland, a thing of infinite beauty,\nwhich could they but wander into it wonderingly, would be heaven\nenough. Opening their eyes, they see a conformable and perfect world.\nTrees, flowers, the world of sound and the world of color. These are\nthe valued inheritance of their state. If no one said to them \"Mine,\"\nthey would wander radiantly forth, singing the song which all the\nearth may some day hope to hear. It is the song of goodness.\n\nCaged in the world of the material, however, such a nature is\nalmost invariably an anomaly. That other world of flesh into which has\nbeen woven pride and greed looks askance at the idealist, the dreamer.\nIf one says it is sweet to look at the clouds, the answer is a warning\nagainst idleness. If one seeks to give ear to the winds, it shall be\nwell with his soul, but they will seize upon his possessions. If all\nthe world of the so-called inanimate delay one, calling with\ntenderness in sounds that seem to be too perfect to be less than\nunderstanding, it shall be ill with the body. The hands of the actual\nare forever reaching toward such as these--forever seizing\ngreedily upon them. It is of such that the bond servants are made.\n\nIn the world of the actual, Jennie was such a spirit. From her\nearliest youth goodness and mercy had molded her every impulse. Did\nSebastian fall and injure himself, it was she who struggled with\nstraining anxiety, carried him safely to his mother. Did George\ncomplain that he was hungry, she gave him all of her bread. Many were\nthe hours in which she had rocked her younger brothers and sisters to\nsleep, singing whole-heartedly betimes and dreaming far dreams. Since\nher earliest walking period she had been as the right hand of her\nmother. What scrubbing, baking, errand-running, and nursing there had\nbeen to do she did. No one had ever heard her rudely complain, though\nshe often thought of the hardness of her lot. She knew that there were\nother girls whose lives were infinitely freer and fuller, but, it\nnever occurred to her to be meanly envious; her heart might be lonely,\nbut her lips continued to sing. When the days were fair she looked out\nof her kitchen window and longed to go where the meadows were.\nNature's fine curves and shadows touched her as a song itself. There\nwere times when she had gone with George and the others, leading them\naway to where a patch of hickory-trees flourished, because there were\nopen fields, with shade for comfort and a brook of living water. No\nartist in the formulating of conceptions, her soul still responded to\nthese things, and every sound and every sigh were welcome to her\nbecause of their beauty.\n\nWhen the soft, low call or the wood-doves, those spirits of the\nsummer, came out of the distance, she would incline her head and\nlisten, the whole spiritual quality of it dropping like silver bubbles\ninto her own great heart.\n\nWhere the sunlight was warm and the shadows flecked with its\nsplendid radiance she delighted to wonder at the pattern of it, to\nwalk where it was most golden, and follow with instinctive\nappreciation the holy corridors of the trees.\n\nColor was not lost upon her. That wonderful radiance which fills\nthe western sky at evening touched and unburdened her heart.\n\n\"I wonder,\" she said once with girlish simplicity, \"how it would\nfeel to float away off there among those clouds.\"\n\nShe had discovered a natural swing of a wild grape-vine, and was\nsitting in it with Martha and George.\n\n\"Oh, wouldn't it be nice if you had a boat up there,\" said\nGeorge.\n\nShe was looking with uplifted face at a far-off cloud, a red island\nin a sea of silver.\n\n\"Just supposing,\" she said, \"people could live on an island like\nthat.\"\n\nHer soul was already up there, and its elysian paths knew the\nlightness of her feet.\n\n\"There goes a bee,\" said George, noting a bumbler winging by.\n\n\"Yes,\" she said, dreamily, \"it's going home.\"\n\n\"Does everything have a home?\" asked Martha.\n\n\"Nearly everything,\" she answered.\n\n\"Do the birds go home?\" questioned George.\n\n\"Yes,\" she said, deeply feeling the poetry of it herself, \"the\nbirds go home.\"\n\n\"Do the bees go home?\" urged Martha.\n\n\"Yes, the bees go home.\"\n\n\"Do the dogs go home?\" said George, who saw one traveling\nlonesomely along the nearby road.\n\n\"Why, of course,\" she said, \"you know that dogs go home.\"\n\n\"Do the gnats?\" he persisted, seeing one of those curious spirals\nof minute insects turning energetically in the waning light.\n\n\"Yes,\" she said, half believing her remark. \"Listen!\"\n\n\"Oho,\" exclaimed George, incredulously, \"I wonder what kind of\nhouses they live in.\"\n\n\"Listen!\" she gently persisted, putting out her hand to still\nhim.\n\nIt was that halcyon hour when the Angelus falls like a benediction\nupon the waning day. Far off the notes were sounding gently, and\nnature, now that she listened, seemed to have paused also. A\nscarlet-breasted robin was hopping in short spaces upon the grass\nbefore her. A humming bee hummed, a cow-bell tinkled, while some\nsuspicious cracklings told of a secretly reconnoitering squirrel.\nKeeping her pretty hand weighed in the air, she listened until the\nlong, soft notes spread and faded and her heart could hold no more.\nThen she arose.\n\n\"Oh,\" she said, clenching her fingers in an agony of poetic\nfeeling. There were crystal tears overflowing in her eyes. The\nwondrous sea of feeling in her had stormed its banks. Of such was the\nspirit of Jennie.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\n\nThe junior Senator, George Sylvester Brander, was a man of peculiar\nmold. In him there were joined, to a remarkable degree, the wisdom of\nthe opportunist and the sympathetic nature of the true representative\nof the people. Born a native of southern Ohio, he had been raised and\neducated there, if one might except the two years in which he had\nstudied law at Columbia University. He knew common and criminal law,\nperhaps, as well as any citizen of his State, but he had never\npractised with that assiduity which makes for pre-eminent success at\nthe bar. He had made money, and had had splendid opportunities to make\na great deal more if he had been willing to stultify his conscience,\nbut that he had never been able to do. And yet his integrity had not\nbeen at all times proof against the claims of friendship. Only in the\nlast presidential election he had thrown his support to a man for\nGovernor who, he well knew, had no claim which a strictly honorable\nconscience could have recognized.\n\nIn the same way, he had been guilty of some very questionable, and\none or two actually unsavory, appointments. Whenever his conscience\npricked him too keenly he would endeavor to hearten himself with his\npet phrase, \"All in a lifetime.\" Thinking over things quite alone in\nhis easy-chair, he would sometimes rise up with these words on his\nlips, and smile sheepishly as he did so. Conscience was not by any\nmeans dead in him. His sympathies, if anything, were keener than\never.\n\nThis man, three times Congressman from the district of which\nColumbus was a part, and twice United States Senator, had never\nmarried. In his youth he had had a serious love affair, but there was\nnothing discreditable to him in the fact that it came to nothing. The\nlady found it inconvenient to wait for him. He was too long in earning\na competence upon which they might subsist.\n\nTall, straight-shouldered, neither lean nor stout, he was to-day an\nimposing figure. Having received his hard knocks and endured his\nlosses, there was that about him which touched and awakened the\nsympathies of the imaginative. People thought him naturally agreeable,\nand his senatorial peers looked upon him as not any too heavy\nmentally, but personally a fine man.\n\nHis presence in Columbus at this particular time was due to the\nfact that his political fences needed careful repairing. The general\nelection had weakened his party in the State Legislature. There were\nenough votes to re-elect him, but it would require the most careful\npolitical manipulation to hold them together. Other men were\nambitious. There were a half-dozen available candidates, any one of\nwhom would have rejoiced to step into his shoes. He realized the\nexigencies of the occasion. They could not well beat him, he thought;\nbut even if this should happen, surely the President could be induced\nto give him a ministry abroad.\n\nYes, he might be called a successful man, but for all that Senator\nBrander felt that he had missed something. He had wanted to do so many\nthings. Here he was, fifty-two years of age, clean, honorable, highly\ndistinguished, as the world takes it, but single. He could not help\nlooking about him now and then and speculating upon the fact that he\nhad no one to care for him. His chamber seemed strangely hollow at\ntimes--his own personality exceedingly disagreeable.\n\n\"Fifty!\" he often thought to himself. \"Alone--absolutely\nalone.\"\n\nSitting in his chamber that Saturday afternoon, a rap at his door\naroused him. He had been speculating upon the futility of his\npolitical energy in the light of the impermanence of life and\nfame.\n\n\"What a great fight we make to sustain ourselves!\" he thought. \"How\nlittle difference it will make to me a few years hence!\"\n\nHe arose, and opening wide his door, perceived Jennie. She had\ncome, as she had suggested to her mother, at this time, instead of on\nMonday, in order to give a more favorable impression of\npromptness.\n\n\"Come right in,\" said the Senator; and, as on the first occasion,\nhe graciously made way for her.\n\nJennie passed in, momentarily expecting some compliment upon the\npromptitude with which the washing had been done. The Senator never\nnoticed it at all.\n\n\"Well, my young lady,\" he said when she had put the bundle down,\n\"how do you find yourself this evening?\"\n\n\"Very well,\" replied Jennie. \"We thought we'd better bring your\nclothes to-day instead of Monday.\"\n\n\"Oh, that would not have made any difference,\" replied Brander\nlightly. \"Just leave them on the chair.\"\n\nJennie, without considering the fact that she had been offered no\npayment for the service rendered, was about to retire, had not the\nSenator detained her.\n\n\"How is your mother?\" he asked pleasantly.\n\n\"She's very well,\" said Jennie simply.\n\n\"And your little sister? Is she any better?\"\n\n\"The doctor thinks so,\" she replied.\n\n\"Sit down,\" he continued graciously. \"I want to talk to you.\"\n\nMoving to a near-by chair, the young girl seated herself.\n\n\"Hem!\" he went on, clearing his throat lightly, \"What seems to be\nthe matter with her?\"\n\n\"She has the measles,\" returned Jennie. \"We thought once that she\nwas going to die.\"\n\nBrander studied her face as she said this, and he thought he saw\nsomething exceedingly pathetic there. The girl's poor clothes and her\nwondering admiration for his exalted station in life affected him. It\nmade him feel almost ashamed of the comfort and luxury that surrounded\nhim. How high up he was in the world, indeed!\n\n\"I am glad she is better now,\" he said kindly. \"How old is your\nfather?\"\n\n\"Fifty-seven.\"\n\n\"And is he any better?\"\n\n\"Oh yes, sir; he's around now, although he can't go out just\nyet.\"\n\n\"I believe your mother said he was a glass-blower by trade?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\nBrander well knew the depressed local conditions in this branch of\nmanufacture. It had been part of the political issue in the last\ncampaign. They must be in a bad way truly.\n\n\"Do all of the children go to school?\" he inquired.\n\n\"Why yes, sir,\" returned Jennie, stammering. She was too shamefaced\nto own that one of the children had been obliged to leave school for\nthe lack of shoes. The utterance of the falsehood troubled her.\n\nHe reflected awhile; then realizing that he had no good excuse for\nfurther detaining her, he arose and came over to her. From his pocket\nhe took a thin layer of bills, and removing one, handed it to her.\n\n\"You take that,\" he said, \"and tell your mother that I said she\nshould use it for whatever she wants.\"\n\nJennie accepted the money with mingled feelings; it did not occur\nto her to look and see how much it was. The great man was so near her,\nthe wonderful chamber in which he dwelt so impressive, that she\nscarcely realized what she was doing.\n\n\"Thank you,\" she said. \"Is there any day you want your washing\ncalled for?\" she added.\n\n\"Oh yes,\" he answered; \"Monday--Monday evenings.\"\n\nShe went away, and in a half reverie he closed the door behind her.\nThe interest that he felt in these people was unusual. Poverty and\nbeauty certainly made up an affecting combination. He sat down in his\nchair and gave himself over to the pleasant speculations which her\ncoming had aroused. Why should he not help them?\n\n\"I'll find out where they live,\" he finally resolved.\n\nIn the days that followed Jennie regularly came for the clothes.\nSenator Brander found himself more and more interested in her, and in\ntime he managed to remove from her mind that timidity and fear which\nhad made her feel uncomfortable in his presence. One thing which\nhelped toward this was his calling her by her first name. This began\nwith her third visit, and thereafter he used it with almost\nunconscious frequency.\n\nIt could scarcely be said that he did this in a fatherly spirit,\nfor he had little of that attitude toward any one. He felt exceedingly\nyoung as he talked to this girl, and he often wondered whether it were\nnot possible for her to perceive and appreciate him on his youthful\nside.\n\nAs for Jennie, she was immensely taken with the comfort and luxury\nsurrounding this man, and subconsciously with the man himself, the\nmost attractive she had ever known. Everything he had was fine,\neverything he did was gentle, distinguished, and considerate. From\nsome far source, perhaps some old German ancestors, she had inherited\nan understanding and appreciation of all this. Life ought to be lived\nas he lived it; the privilege of being generous particularly appealed\nto her.\n\nPart of her attitude was due to that of her mother, in whose mind\nsympathy was always a more potent factor than reason. For instance,\nwhen she brought to her the ten dollars Mrs. Gerhardt was transported\nwith joy.\n\n\"Oh,\" said Jennie, \"I didn't know until I got outside that it was\nso much. He said I should give it to you.\"\n\nMrs. Gerhardt took it, and holding it loosely in her folded hands,\nsaw distinctly before her the tall Senator with his fine manners.\n\n\"What a fine man he is!\" she said. \"He has a good heart.\"\n\nFrequently throughout the evening and the next day Mrs. Gerhardt\ncommented upon this wonderful treasure-trove, repeating again and\nagain how good he must be or how large must be his heart. When it came\nto washing his clothes she almost rubbed them to pieces, feeling that\nwhatever she did she could scarcely do enough. Gerhardt was not to\nknow. He had such stern views about accepting money without earning it\nthat even in their distress, she would have experienced some\ndifficulty in getting him to take it. Consequently she said nothing,\nbut used it to buy bread and meat, and going as it did such a little\nway, the sudden windfall was never noticed.\n\nJennie, from now on, reflected this attitude toward the Senator,\nand, feeling so grateful toward him, she began to talk more freely.\nThey came to be on such good terms that he gave her a little leather\npicture-case from his dresser which he had observed her admiring.\nEvery time she came he found excuse to detain her, and soon discovered\nthat, for all her soft girlishness, there lay deep-seated in her a\nconscious deprecation of poverty and a shame of having to own any\nneed. He honestly admired her for this, and, seeing that her clothes\nwere poor and her shoes worn, he began to wonder how he could help her\nwithout offending.\n\nNot infrequently he thought to follow her some evening, and see for\nhimself what the condition of the family might be. He was a United\nStates Senator, however. The neighborhood they lived in must be very\npoor. He stopped to consider, and for the time the counsels of\nprudence prevailed. Consequently the contemplated visit was put\noff.\n\nEarly in December Senator Brander returned to Washington for three\nweeks, and both Mrs. Gerhardt and Jennie were surprised to learn one\nday that he had gone. Never had he given them less than two dollars a\nweek for his washing, and several times it had been five. He had not\nrealized, perhaps, what a breach his absence would make in their\nfinances. But there was nothing to do about it; they managed to pinch\nalong. Gerhardt, now better, searched for work at the various mills,\nand finding nothing, procured a saw-buck and saw, and going from door\nto door, sought for the privilege of sawing wood. There was not a\ngreat deal of this to do, but he managed, by the most earnest labor to\nearn two, and sometimes three, dollars a week. This added to what his\nwife earned and what Sebastian gave was enough to keep bread in their\nmouths, but scarcely more.\n\nIt was at the opening of the joyous Christmas-time that the\nbitterness of their poverty affected them most. The Germans love to\nmake a great display at Christmas. It is the one season of the year\nwhen the fullness of their large family affection manifests itself.\nWarm in the appreciation of the joys of childhood, they love to see\nthe little ones enjoy their toys and games. Father Gerhardt at his\nsaw-buck during the weeks before Christmas thought of this very often.\nWhat would little Veronica not deserve after her long illness! How he\nwould have liked to give each of the children a stout pair of shoes,\nthe boys a warm cap, the girls a pretty hood. Toys and games and candy\nthey always had had before. He hated to think of the snow-covered\nChristmas morning and no table richly piled with what their young\nhearts would most desire.\n\nAs for Mrs. Gerhardt, one could better imagine than describe her\nfeelings. She felt so keenly about it that she could hardly bring\nherself to speak of the dreaded hour to her husband. She had managed\nto lay aside three dollars in the hope of getting enough to buy a ton\nof coal, and so put an end to poor George's daily pilgrimage to the\ncoal yard, but now as the Christmas week drew near she decided to use\nit for gifts. Father Gerhardt was also secreting two dollars without\nthe knowledge of his wife, thinking that on Christmas Eve he could\nproduce it at a critical moment, and so relieve her maternal\nanxiety.\n\nWhen the actual time arrived, however, there was very little to be\nsaid for the comfort that they got out of the occasion. The whole city\nwas rife with Christmas atmosphere. Grocery stores and meat markets\nwere strung with holly. The toy shops and candy stores were radiant\nwith fine displays of everything that a self-respecting Santa Claus\nshould have about him. Both parents and children observed it\nall--the former with serious thoughts of need and anxiety, the\nlatter with wild fancy and only partially suppressed longings.\n\nFrequently had Gerhardt said in their presence:\n\n\"Kriss Kringle is very poor this year. He hasn't so very much to\ngive.\"\n\nBut no child, however poverty-stricken, could be made to believe\nthis. Every time after so saying he looked into their eyes, but in\nspite of the warning, expectation flamed in them undiminished.\n\nChristmas coming on Tuesday, the Monday before there was no school.\nBefore going to the hotel Mrs. Gerhardt had cautioned George that he\nmust bring enough coal from the yards to last over Christmas day. The\nlatter went at once with his two younger sisters, but there being a\ndearth of good picking, it took them a long time to fill their\nbaskets, and by night they had gathered only a scanty supply.\n\n\"Did you go for the coal?\" asked Mrs. Gerhardt the first thing when\nshe returned from the hotel that evening.\n\n\"Yes,\" said George.\n\n\"Did you get enough for to-morrow?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" he replied, \"I guess so.\"\n\n\"Well, now, I'll go and look,\" she replied. Taking the lamp, they\nwent out into the woodshed where the coal was deposited.\n\n\"Oh, my!\" she exclaimed when she saw it; \"why, that isn't near\nenough. You must go right off and get some more.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" said George, pouting his lips, \"I don't want to go. Let Bass\ngo.\"\n\nBass, who had returned promptly at a quarter-past six, was already\nbusy in the back bedroom washing and dressing preparatory to going\ndown-town.\n\n\"No,\" said Mrs. Gerhardt. \"Bass has worked hard all day. You must\ngo.\"\n\n\"I don't want to,\" pouted George.\n\n\"All right,\" said Mrs. Gerhardt, \"maybe to-morrow you'll be without\na fire, and then what?\"\n\nThey went back to the house, but George's conscience was too\ntroubled to allow him to consider the case as closed.\n\n\"Bass, you come, too,\" he called to his elder brother when he was\ninside.\n\n\"Go where?\" said Bass.\n\n\"To get some coal.\"\n\n\"No,\" said the former, \"I guess not. What do you take me for?\"\n\n\"Well, then, I'll not,\" said George, with an obstinate jerk of his\nhead.\n\n\"Why didn't you get it up this afternoon?\" questioned his brother\nsharply; \"you've had all day to do it.\"\n\n\"Aw, I did try,\" said George. \"We couldn't find enough. I can't get\nany when there ain't any, can I?\"\n\n\"I guess you didn't try very hard,\" said the dandy.\n\n\"What's the matter now?\" asked Jennie, who, coming in after having\nstopped at the grocer's for her mother, saw George with a solemn pout\non his face.\n\n\"Oh, Bass won't go with me to get any coal?\"\n\n\"Didn't you get any this afternoon?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said George, \"but ma says I didn't get enough.\"\n\n\"I'll go with you,\" said his sister. \"Bass, will you come\nalong?\"\n\n\"No,\" said the young man, indifferently, \"I won't.\" He was\nadjusting his necktie and felt irritated.\n\n\"There ain't any,\" said George, \"unless we get it off the cars.\nThere wasn't any cars where I was.\"\n\n\"There are, too,\" exclaimed Bass.\n\n\"There ain't,\" said George.\n\n\"Oh, don't quarrel,\" said Jennie. \"Get the baskets and let's go\nright now before it gets too late.\"\n\nThe other children, who had a fondness for their big sister, got\nout the implements of supply--Veronica a basket, Martha and\nWilliam buckets, and George, a big clothes-basket, which he and Jennie\nwere to fill and carry between them. Bass, moved by his sister's\nwillingness and the little regard he still maintained for her, now\nmade a suggestion.\n\n\"I'll tell you what you do, Jen,\" he said. \"You go over there with\nthe kids to Eighth Street and wait around those cars. I'll be along in\na minute. When I come by don't any of you pretend to know me. Just you\nsay, 'Mister, won't you please throw us some coal down?' and then I'll\nget up on the cars and pitch off enough to fill the baskets. D'ye\nunderstand?\"\n\n\"All right,\" said Jennie, very much pleased.\n\nOut into the snowy night they went, and made their way to the\nrailroad tracks. At the intersection of the street and the broad\nrailroad yard were many heavily laden cars of bituminous coal newly\nbacked in. All of the children gathered within the shadow of one.\nWhile they were standing there, waiting the arrival of their brother,\nthe Washington Special arrived, a long, fine train with several of the\nnew style drawing-room cars, the big plate-glass windows shining and\nthe passengers looking out from the depths of their comfortable\nchairs. The children instinctively drew back as it thundered past.\n\n\"Oh, wasn't it long?\" said George.\n\n\"Wouldn't I like to be a brakeman, though,\" sighed William.\n\nJennie, alone, kept silent, but to her particularly the suggestion\nof travel and comfort had appealed. How beautiful life must be for the\nrich!\n\nSebastian now appeared in the distance, a mannish spring in his\nstride, and with every evidence that he took himself seriously. He was\nof that peculiar stubbornness and determination that had the children\nfailed to carry out his plan of procedure he would have gone\ndeliberately by and refused to help them at all.\n\nMartha, however, took the situation as it needed to be taken, and\npiped out childishly, \"Mister, won't you please throw us down some\ncoal?\"\n\nSebastian stopped abruptly, and looking sharply at them as though\nhe were really a stranger, exclaimed, \"Why, certainly,\" and proceeded\nto climb up on the car, from whence he cast down with remarkable\ncelerity more than enough chunks to fill their baskets. Then as though\nnot caring to linger any longer amid such plebeian company, he\nhastened across the network of tracks and was lost to view.\n\nOn their way home they encountered another gentleman, this time a\nreal one, with high hat and distinguished cape coat, whom Jennie\nimmediately recognized. This was the honorable Senator himself, newly\nreturned from Washington, and anticipating a very unprofitable\nChristmas. He had arrived upon the express which had enlisted the\nattention of the children, and was carrying his light grip for the\npleasure of it to the hotel. As he passed he thought that he\nrecognized Jennie.\n\n\"Is that you, Jennie?\" he said, and paused to be more certain.\n\nThe latter, who had discovered him even more quickly than he had\nher, exclaimed, \"Oh, there is Mr. Brander!\" Then, dropping her end of\nthe basket, with a caution to the children to take it right home, she\nhurried away in the opposite direction.\n\nThe Senator followed, vainly calling three or four times \"Jennie!\nJennie!\" Losing hope of overtaking her, and suddenly recognizing, and\nthereupon respecting, her simple, girlish shame, he stopped, and\nturning back, decided to follow the children. Again he felt that same\nsensation which he seemed always to get from this girl--the far\ncry between her estate and his. It was something to be a Senator\nto-night, here where these children were picking coal. What could the\njoyous holiday of the morrow hold for them? He tramped along\nsympathetically, an honest lightness coming into his step, and soon he\nsaw them enter the gateway of the low cottage. Crossing the street, he\nstood in the weak shade of the snow-laden trees. The light was burning\nwith a yellow glow in a rear window. All about was the white snow. In\nthe woodshed he could hear the voices of the children, and once he\nthought he detected the form of Mrs. Gerhardt. After a time another\nform came shadow-like through the side gate. He knew who it was. It\ntouched him to the quick, and he bit his lip sharply to suppress any\nfurther show of emotion. Then he turned vigorously on his heel and\nwalked away.\n\nThe chief grocery of the city was conducted by one Manning, a\nstanch adherent of Brander, and one who felt honored by the Senator's\nacquaintance. To him at his busy desk came the Senator this same\nnight.\n\n\"Manning,\" he said, \"could I get you to undertake a little work for\nme this evening?\"\n\n\"Why, certainly, Senator, certainly,\" said the grocery-man. \"When\ndid you get back? Glad to see you. Certainly.\"\n\n\"I want you to get everything together that would make a nice\nChristmas for a family of eight--father and mother and six\nchildren--Christmas tree, groceries, toys--you know what I\nmean.\"\n\n\"Certainly, certainly, Senator.\"\n\n\"Never mind the cost now. Send plenty of everything. I'll give you\nthe address,\" and he picked up a note-book to write it.\n\n\"Why, I'll be delighted, Senator,\" went on Mr. Manning, rather\naffected himself. \"I'll be delighted. You always were generous.\"\n\n\"Here you are, Manning,\" said the Senator, grimly, from the mere\nnecessity of preserving his senatorial dignity. \"Send everything at\nonce, and the bill to me.\"\n\n\"I'll be delighted,\" was all the astonished and approving\ngrocery-man could say.\n\nThe Senator passed out, but remembering the old people, visited a\nclothier and shoe man, and, finding that he could only guess at what\nsizes might be required, ordered the several articles with the\nprivilege of exchange. When his labors were over, he returned to his\nroom.\n\n\"Carrying coal,\" he thought, over and over. \"Really, it was very\nthoughtless in me. I mustn't forget them any more.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\n\nThe desire to flee which Jennie experienced upon seeing the Senator\nagain was attributable to what she considered the disgrace of her\nposition. She was ashamed to think that he, who thought so well of\nher, should discover her doing so common a thing. Girl-like, she was\ninclined to imagine that his interest in her depended upon something\nelse than her mere personality.\n\nWhen she reached home Mrs. Gerhardt had heard of her flight from\nthe other children.\n\n\"What was the matter with you, anyhow?\" asked George, when she came\nin.\n\n\"Oh, nothing,\" she answered, but immediately turned to her mother\nand said, \"Mr. Brander came by and saw us.\"\n\n\"Oh, did he?\" softly exclaimed her mother. \"He's back then. What\nmade you run, though, you foolish girl?\"\n\n\"Well, I didn't want him to see me.\"\n\n\"Well, maybe he didn't know you, anyhow,\" she said, with a certain\nsympathy for her daughter's predicament.\n\n\"Oh yes, he did, too,\" whispered Jennie. \"He called after me three\nor four times.\"\n\nMrs. Gerhardt shook her head.\n\n\"What is it?\" said Gerhardt, who had been hearing the conversation\nfrom the adjoining room, and now came out.\n\n\"Oh, nothing,\" said the mother, who hated to explain the\nsignificance which the Senator's personality had come to have in their\nlives. \"A man frightened them when they were bringing the coal.\"\n\nThe arrival of the Christmas presents later in the evening threw\nthe household into an uproar of excitement. Neither Gerhardt nor the\nmother could believe their eyes when a grocery wagon halted in front\nof their cottage and a lusty clerk began to carry in the gifts. After\nfailing to persuade the clerk that he had made a mistake, the large\nassortment of good things was looked over with very human glee.\n\n\"Just you never mind,\" was the clerk's authoritative words. \"I know\nwhat I'm about. Gerhardt, isn't it? Well, you're the people.\"\n\nMrs. Gerhardt moved about, rubbing her hands in her excitement, and\ngiving vent to an occasional \"Well, isn't that nice now!\"\n\nGerhardt himself was melted at the thought of the generosity of the\nunknown benefactor, and was inclined to lay it all to the goodness of\na great local mill owner, who knew him and wished him well. Mrs.\nGerhardt tearfully suspected the source, but said nothing. Jennie\nknew, by instinct, the author of it all.\n\nThe afternoon of the day after Christmas Brander encountered the\nmother in the hotel, Jennie having been left at home to look after the\nhouse.\n\n\"How do you do, Mrs. Gerhardt,\" he exclaimed genially extending his\nhand. \"How did you enjoy your Christmas?\"\n\nPoor Mrs. Gerhardt took it nervously; her eyes filled rapidly with\ntears.\n\n\"There, there,\" he said, patting her on the shoulder. \"Don't cry.\nYou mustn't forget to get my laundry to-day.\"\n\n\"Oh no, sir,\" she returned, and would have said more had he not\nwalked away.\n\nFrom this on, Gerhardt heard continually of the fine Senator at the\nhotel, how pleasant he was, and how much he paid for his washing. With\nthe simplicity of a German workingman, he was easily persuaded that\nMr. Brander must be a very great and a very good man.\n\nJennie, whose feelings needed no encouragement in this direction,\nwas more than ever prejudiced in his favor.\n\nThere was developing in her that perfection of womanhood, the full\nmold of form, which could not help but attract any man. Already she\nwas well built, and tall for a girl. Had she been dressed in the\ntrailing skirts of a woman of fashion she would have made a fitting\ncompanion for a man the height of the Senator. Her eyes were\nwondrously clear and bright, her skin fair, and her teeth white and\neven. She was clever, too, in a sensible way, and by no means\ndeficient in observation. All that she lacked was training and the\nassurance of which the knowledge of utter dependency despoils one. But\nthe carrying of washing and the compulsion to acknowledge almost\nanything as a favor put her at a disadvantage.\n\nNowadays when she came to the hotel upon her semi-weekly errand\nSenator Brander took her presence with easy grace, and to this she\nresponded. He often gave her little presents for herself, or for her\nbrothers and sisters, and he talked to her so unaffectedly that\nfinally the overawing sense of the great difference between them was\nbrushed away, and she looked upon him more as a generous friend than\nas a distinguished Senator. He asked her once how she would like to go\nto a seminary, thinking all the while how attractive she would be when\nshe came out. Finally, one evening, he called her to his side.\n\n\"Come over here, Jennie,\" he said, \"and stand by me.\"\n\nShe came, and, moved by a sudden impulse, he took her hand.\n\n\"Well, Jennie,\" he said, studying her face in a quizzical,\ninterrogative way, \"what do you think of me, anyhow?\"\n\n\"Oh,\" she answered, looking consciously away, \"I don't know. What\nmakes you ask me that?\"\n\n\"Oh yes, you do,\" he returned. \"You have some opinion of me. Tell\nme now, what is it?\"\n\n\"No, I haven't,\" she said, innocently.\n\n\"Oh yes, you have,\" he went on, pleasantly, interested by her\ntransparent evasiveness. \"You must think something of me. Now, what is\nit?\"\n\n\"Do you mean do I like you?\" she asked, frankly, looking down at\nthe big mop of black hair well streaked with gray which hung about his\nforehead, and gave an almost lionine cast to his fine face.\n\n\"Well, yes,\" he said, with a sense of disappointment. She was\nbarren of the art of the coquette.\n\n\"Why, of course I like you,\" she replied, prettily.\n\n\"Haven't you ever thought anything else about me?\" he went on.\n\n\"I think you're very kind,\" she went on, even more bashfully; she\nrealized now that he was still holding her hand.\n\n\"Is that all?\" he asked.\n\n\"Well,\" she said, with fluttering eyelids, \"isn't that enough?\"\n\nHe looked at her, and the playful, companionable directness of her\nanswering gaze thrilled him through and through. He studied her face\nin silence while she turned and twisted, feeling, but scarcely\nunderstanding, the deep import of his scrutiny.\n\n\"Well,\" he said at last, \"I think you're a fine girl. Don't you\nthink I'm a pretty nice man?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Jennie, promptly.\n\nHe leaned back in his chair and laughed at the unconscious drollery\nof her reply. She looked at him curiously, and smiled.\n\n\"What made you laugh?\" she inquired.\n\n\"Oh, your answer\" he returned. \"I really ought not to laugh,\nthough. You don't appreciate me in the least. I don't believe you like\nme at all.\"\n\n\"But I do, though,\" she replied, earnestly. \"I think you're so\ngood.\" Her eyes showed very plainly that she felt what she was\nsaying.\n\n\"Well,\" he said, drawing her gently down to him; then, at the same\ninstant, he pressed his lips to her cheek.\n\n\"Oh!\" she cried, straightening up, at once startled and\nfrightened.\n\nIt was a new note in their relationship. The senatorial quality\nvanished in an instant. She recognized in him something that she had\nnot felt before. He seemed younger, too. She was a woman to him, and\nhe was playing the part of a lover. She hesitated, but not knowing\njust what to do, did nothing at all.\n\n\"Well,\" he said, \"did I frighten you?\"\n\nShe looked at him, but moved by her underlying respect for this\ngreat man, she said, with a smile, \"Yes, you did.\"\n\n\"I did it because I like you so much.\"\n\nShe meditated upon this a moment, and then said, \"I think I'd\nbetter be going.\"\n\n\"Now then,\" he pleaded, \"are you going to run away because of\nthat?\"\n\n\"No,\" she said, moved by a curious feeling of ingratitude; \"but I\nought to be going. They'll be wondering where I am.\"\n\n\"You're sure you're not angry about it?\"\n\n\"No,\" she replied, and with more of a womanly air than she had ever\nshown before. It was a novel experience to be in so authoritative a\nposition. It was so remarkable that it was somewhat confusing to both\nof them.\n\n\"You're my girl, anyhow,\" the Senator said, rising. \"I'm going to\ntake care of you in the future.\"\n\nJennie heard this, and it pleased her. He was so well fitted, she\nthought, to do wondrous things; he was nothing less than a veritable\nmagician. She looked about her and the thought of coming into such a\nlife and such an atmosphere was heavenly. Not that she fully\nunderstood his meaning, however. He meant to be good and generous, and\nto give her fine things. Naturally she was happy. She took up the\npackage that she had come for, not seeing or feeling the incongruity\nof her position, while he felt it as a direct reproof.\n\n\"She ought not to carry that,\" he thought. A great wave of sympathy\nswept over him. He took her cheeks between his hands, this time in a\nsuperior and more generous way. \"Never mind, little girl,\" he said.\n\"You won't have to do this always. I'll see what I can do.\"\n\nThe outcome of this was simply a more sympathetic relationship\nbetween them. He did not hesitate to ask her to sit beside him on the\narm of his chair the next time she came, and to question her\nintimately about the family's condition and her own desires. Several\ntimes he noticed that she was evading his questions, particularly in\nregard to what her father was doing. She was ashamed to own that he\nwas sawing wood. Fearing lest something more serious was impending, he\ndecided to go out some day and see for himself.\n\nThis he did when a convenient morning presented itself and his\nother duties did not press upon him. It was three days before the\ngreat fight in the Legislature began which ended in his defeat.\nNothing could be done in these few remaining days. So he took his cane\nand strolled forth, coming to the cottage in the course of a half\nhour, and knocked boldly at the door.\n\nMrs. Gerhardt opened it.\n\n\"Good-morning,\" he said, cheerily; then, seeing her hesitate, he\nadded, \"May I come in?\"\n\nThe good mother, who was all but overcome by his astonishing\npresence, wiped her hands furtively upon her much-mended apron, and,\nseeing that he waited for a reply, said:\n\n\"Oh yes. Come right in.\"\n\nShe hurried forward, forgetting to close the door, and, offering\nhim a chair, asked him to be seated.\n\nBrander, feeling sorry that he was the occasion of so much\nconfusion, said: \"Don't trouble yourself, Mrs. Gerhardt. I was passing\nand thought I'd come in. How is your husband?\"\n\n\"He's well, thank you,\" returned the mother. \"He's out working\nto-day.\"\n\n\"Then he has found employment?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" said Mrs. Gerhardt, who hesitated, like Jennie, to say\nwhat it was.\n\n\"The children are all well now, and in school, I hope?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Mrs. Gerhardt. She had now unfastened her apron, and\nwas nervously turning it in her lap.\n\n\"That's good, and where is Jennie?\"\n\nThe latter, who had been ironing, had abandoned the board and had\nconcealed herself in the bedroom, where she was busy tidying herself\nin the fear that her mother would not have the forethought to say that\nshe was out, and so let her have a chance for escape.\n\n\"She's here,\" returned the mother. \"I'll call her.\"\n\n\"What did you tell him I was here for?\" said Jennie, weakly.\n\n\"What could I do?\" asked the mother.\n\nTogether they hesitated while the Senator surveyed the room. He\nfelt sorry to think that such deserving people must suffer so; he\nintended, in a vague way, to ameliorate their condition if\npossible.\n\n\"Good-morning,\" the Senator said to Jennie, when finally she came\nhesitatingly into the room. \"How do you do to-day?\"\n\nJennie came forward, extending her hand and blushing. She found\nherself so much disturbed by this visit that she could hardly find\ntongue to answer his questions.\n\n\"I thought,\" he said, \"I'd come out and find where you live. This\nis a quite comfortable house. How many rooms have you?\"\n\n\"Five,\" said Jennie. \"You'll have to excuse the looks this morning.\nWe've been ironing, and it's all upset.\"\n\n\"I know,\" said Brander, gently. \"Don't you think I understand,\nJennie? You mustn't feel nervous about me.\"\n\nShe noticed the comforting, personal tone he always used with her\nwhen she was at his room, and it helped to subdue her flustered\nsenses.\n\n\"You mustn't think it anything if I come here occasionally. I\nintend to come. I want to meet your father.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" said Jennie, \"he's out to-day.\"\n\nWhile they were talking, however, the honest woodcutter was coming\nin at the gate with his buck and saw. Brander saw him, and at once\nrecognized him by a slight resemblance to his daughter.\n\n\"There he is now, I believe,\" he said.\n\n\"Oh, is he?\" said Jennie, looking out.\n\nGerhardt, who was given to speculation these days, passed by the\nwindow without looking up. He put his wooden buck down, and, hanging\nhis saw on a nail on the side of the house, came in.\n\n\"Mother,\" he called, in German, and, then not seeing her, he came\nto the door of the front room and looked in.\n\nBrander arose and extended his hand. The knotted and weather-beaten\nGerman came forward, and took it with a very questioning expression of\ncountenance.\n\n\"This is my father, Mr. Brander,\" said Jennie, all her diffidence\ndissolved by sympathy. \"This is the gentleman from the hotel, papa,\nMr. Brander.\"\n\n\"What's the name?\" said the German, turning his head.\n\n\"Brander,\" said the Senator.\n\n\"Oh yes,\" he said, with a considerable German accent.\n\n\"Since I had the fever I don't hear good. My wife, she spoke to me\nof you.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said the Senator, \"I thought I'd come out and make your\nacquaintance. You have quite a family.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said the father, who was conscious of his very poor garments\nand anxious to get away. \"I have six children--all young. She's\nthe oldest girl.\"\n\nMrs. Gerhardt now came back, and Gerhardt, seeing his chance, said\nhurriedly:\n\n\"Well, if you'll excuse me, I'll go. I broke my saw, and so I had\nto stop work.\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" said Brander, graciously, realizing now why Jennie had\nnever wanted to explain. He half wished that she were courageous\nenough not to conceal anything.\n\n\"Well, Mrs. Gerhardt,\" he said, when the mother was stiffly seated,\n\"I want to tell you that you mustn't look on me as a stranger.\nHereafter I want you to keep me informed of how things are going with\nyou. Jennie won't always do it.\"\n\nJennie smiled quietly. Mrs. Gerhardt only rubbed her hands.\n\n\"Yes,\" she answered, humbly grateful.\n\nThey talked for a few minutes, and then the Senator rose.\n\n\"Tell your husband,\" he said, \"to come and see me next Monday at my\noffice in the hotel. I want to do something for him.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" faltered Mrs. Gerhardt.\n\n\"I'll not stay any longer now,\" he added. \"Don't forget to have him\ncome.\"\n\n\"Oh, he'll come,\" she returned.\n\nAdjusting a glove on one hand, he extended the other to Jennie.\n\n\"Here is your finest treasure, Mrs. Gerhardt,\" he said. \"I think\nI'll take her.\"\n\n\"Well, I don't know,\" said her mother, \"whether I could spare her\nor not.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said the Senator, going toward the door, and giving Mrs.\nGerhardt his hand, \"good-morning.\"\n\nHe nodded and walked out, while a half-dozen neighbors, who had\nobserved his entrance, peeked from behind curtains and drawn blinds at\nthe astonishing sight.\n\n\"Who can that be, anyhow?\" was the general query.\n\n\"See what he gave me,\" said the innocent mother to her daughter the\nmoment he had closed the door.\n\nIt was a ten-dollar bill. He had placed it softly in her hand as he\nsaid good-by.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\n\nHaving been led by circumstances into an attitude of obligation\ntoward the Senator, it was not unnatural that Jennie should become\nimbued with a most generous spirit of appreciation for everything he\nhad done and now continued to do. The Senator gave her father a letter\nto a local mill owner, who saw that he received something to do. It\nwas not much, to be sure, a mere job as night-watchman, but it helped,\nand old Gerhardt's gratitude was extravagant. Never was there such a\ngreat, such a good man!\n\nNor was Mrs. Gerhardt overlooked. Once Brander sent her a dress,\nand at another time a shawl. All these benefactions were made in a\nspirit of mingled charity and self-gratification, but to Mrs. Gerhardt\nthey glowed with but one motive. Senator Brander was good-hearted.\n\nAs for Jennie, he drew nearer to her in every possible way, so that\nat last she came to see him in a light which would require\nconsiderable analysis to make clear. This fresh, young soul, however,\nhad too much innocence and buoyancy to consider for a moment the\nworld's point of view. Since that one notable and halcyon visit upon\nwhich he had robbed her her original shyness, and implanted a tender\nkiss upon her cheek, they had lived in a different atmosphere. Jennie\nwas his companion now, and as he more and more unbended, and even\njoyously flung aside the habiliments of his dignity, her perception of\nhim grew clearer. They laughed and chatted in a natural way, and he\nkeenly enjoyed this new entrance into the radiant world of youthful\nhappiness.\n\nOne thing that disturbed him, however, was the occasional thought,\nwhich he could not repress, that he was not doing right. Other people\nmust soon discover that he was not confining himself strictly to\nconventional relations with this washer-woman's daughter. He suspected\nthat the housekeeper was not without knowledge that Jennie almost\ninvariably lingered from a quarter to three-quarters of an hour\nwhenever she came for or returned his laundry. He knew that it might\ncome to the ears of the hotel clerks, and so, in a general way, get\nabout town and work serious injury, but the reflection did not cause\nhim to modify his conduct. Sometimes he consoled himself with the\nthought that he was not doing her any actual harm, and at other times\nhe would argue that he could not put this one delightful tenderness\nout of his life. Did he not wish honestly to do her much good?\n\nHe thought of these things occasionally, and decided that he could\nnot stop. The self-approval which such a resolution might bring him\nwas hardly worth the inevitable pain of the abnegation. He had not so\nvery many more years to live. Why die unsatisfied?\n\nOne evening he put his arm around her and strained her to his\nbreast. Another time he drew her to his knee, and told her of his life\nat Washington. Always now he had a caress and a kiss for her, but it\nwas still in a tentative, uncertain way. He did not want to reach for\nher soul too deeply.\n\nJennie enjoyed it all innocently. Elements of fancy and novelty\nentered into her life. She was an unsophisticated creature, emotional,\ntotally inexperienced in the matter of the affections, and yet mature\nenough mentally to enjoy the attentions of this great man who had thus\nbowed from his high position to make friends with her.\n\nOne evening she pushed his hair back from his forehead as she stood\nby his chair, and, finding nothing else to do, took out his watch. The\ngreat man thrilled as he looked at her pretty innocence.\n\n\"Would you like to have a watch, too?\" he asked.\n\n\"Yes, indeed, I would,\" said Jennie, with a deep breath.\n\nThe next day he stopped as he was passing a jewelry store and\nbought one. It was gold, and had pretty ornamented hands.\n\n\"Jennie,\" he said, when she came the next time, \"I want to show you\nsomething. See what time it is by my watch.\"\n\nJennie drew out the watch from his waistcoat pocket and started in\nsurprise.\n\n\"This isn't your watch!\" she exclaimed, her face full of innocent\nwonder.\n\n\"No,\" he said, delighted with his little deception. \"It's\nyours.\"\n\n\"Mine!\" exclaimed Jennie. \"Mine! Oh, isn't it lovely!\"\n\n\"Do you think so?\" he said.\n\nHer delight touched and pleased him immensely. Her face shone with\nlight and her eyes fairly danced.\n\n\"That's yours,\" he said. \"See that you wear it now, and don't lose\nit.\"\n\n\"You're so good!\" she exclaimed.\n\n\"No,\" he said, but he held her at arm's length by the waist, to\nmake up his mind what his reward should be. Slowly he drew her toward\nhim until, when very close, she put her arms about his neck, and laid\nher cheek in gratitude against his own. This was the quintessence of\npleasure for him. He felt as he had been longing to feel for\nyears.\n\nThe progress of his idyl suffered a check when the great senatorial\nfight came on in the Legislature. Attacked by a combination of rivals,\nBrander was given the fight of his life. To his amazement he\ndiscovered that a great railroad corporation, which had always been\nfriendly, was secretly throwing its strength in behalf of an already\ntoo powerful candidate. Shocked by this defection, he was thrown\nalternately into the deepest gloom and into paroxysms of wrath. These\nslings of fortune, however lightly he pretended to receive them, never\nfailed to lacerate him. It had been long since he had suffered a\ndefeat--too long.\n\nDuring this period Jennie received her earliest lesson in the\nvagaries of men. For two weeks she did not even see him, and one\nevening, after an extremely comfortless conference with his leader, he\nmet her with the most chilling formality. When she knocked at his door\nhe only troubled to open it a foot, exclaiming almost harshly: \"I\ncan't bother about the clothes to-night. Come tomorrow.\"\n\nJennie retreated, shocked and surprised by this reception. She did\nnot know what to think of it. He was restored on the instant to his\nfar-off, mighty throne, and left to rule in peace. Why should he not\nwithdraw the light of his countenance if it pleased him. But\nwhy--\n\nA day or two later he repented mildly, but had no time to readjust\nmatters. His washing was taken and delivered with considerable\nformality, and he went on toiling forgetfully, until at last he was\nmiserably defeated by two votes. Astounded by this result, he lapsed\ninto gloomy dejection of soul. What was he to do now?\n\nInto this atmosphere came Jennie, bringing with her the lightness\nand comfort of her own hopeful disposition. Nagged to desperation by\nhis thoughts, Brander first talked to her to amuse himself; but soon\nhis distress imperceptibly took flight; he found himself actually\nsmiling.\n\n\"Ah, Jennie,\" he said, speaking to her as he might have done to a\nchild, \"youth is on your side. You possess the most valuable thing in\nlife.\"\n\n\"Do I?\"\n\n\"Yes, but you don't realize it. You never will until it is too\nlate.\"\n\n\"I love that girl,\" he thought to himself that night. \"I wish I\ncould have her with me always.\"\n\nBut fortune had another fling for him to endure. It got about the\nhotel that Jennie was, to use the mildest expression, conducting\nherself strangely. A girl who carries washing must expect criticism if\nanything not befitting her station is observed in her apparel. Jennie\nwas seen wearing the gold watch. Her mother was informed by the\nhousekeeper of the state of things.\n\n\"I thought I'd speak to you about it,\" she said. \"People are\ntalking. You'd better not let your daughter go to his room for the\nlaundry.\"\n\nMrs. Gerhardt was too astonished and hurt for utterance. Jennie had\ntold her nothing, but even now she did not believe there was anything\nto tell. The watch had been both approved of and admired by her. She\nhad not thought that it was endangering her daughter's reputation.\n\nGoing home she worried almost incessantly, and talked with Jennie\nabout it. The latter did not admit the implication that things had\ngone too far. In fact, she did not look at it in that light. She did\nnot own, it is true, what really had happened while she was visiting\nthe Senator.\n\n\"It's so terrible that people should begin to talk!\" said her\nmother. \"Did you really stay so long in the room?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" returned Jennie, compelled by her conscience to\nadmit at least part of the truth. \"Perhaps I did.\"\n\n\"He has never said anything out of the way to you, has he?\"\n\n\"No,\" answered her daughter, who did not attach any suspicion of\nevil to what had passed between them.\n\nIf the mother had only gone a little bit further she might have\nlearned more, but she was only too glad, for her own peace of mind, to\nhush the matter up. People were slandering a good man, that she knew.\nJennie had been the least bit indiscreet. People were always so ready\nto talk. How could the poor girl, amid such unfortunate circumstances,\ndo otherwise than she did. It made her cry to think of it.\n\nThe result of it all was that she decided to get the washing\nherself.\n\nShe came to his door the next Monday after this decision. Brander,\nwho was expecting Jennie, was both surprised and disappointed.\n\n\"Why,\" he said to her, \"what has become of Jennie?\"\n\nHaving hoped that he would not notice, or, at least, not comment\nupon the change, Mrs. Gerhardt did not know what to say. She looked up\nat him weakly in her innocent, motherly way, and said, \"She couldn't\ncome to-night.\"\n\n\"Not ill, is she?\" he inquired.\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"I'm glad to hear that,\" he said resignedly. \"How have you\nbeen?\"\n\nMrs. Gerhardt answered his kindly inquiries and departed. After she\nhad gone he got to thinking the matter over, and wondered what could\nhave happened. It seemed rather odd that he should be wondering over\nit.\n\nOn Saturday, however, when she returned the clothes he felt that\nthere must be something wrong.\n\n\"What's the matter, Mrs. Gerhardt?\" he inquired. \"Has anything\nhappened to your daughter?\"\n\n\"No, sir,\" she returned, too troubled to wish to deceive him.\n\n\"Isn't she coming for the laundry any more?\"\n\n\"I--I--\" ventured the mother, stammering in her\nperturbation; \"she--they have been talking about her,\" she at\nlast forced herself to say.\n\n\"Who has been talking?\" he asked gravely.\n\n\"The people here in the hotel.\"\n\n\"Who, what people?\" he interrupted, a touch of annoyance showing in\nhis voice.\n\n\"The housekeeper.\"\n\n\"The housekeeper, eh!\" he exclaimed. \"What has she got to say?\"\n\nThe mother related to him her experience.\n\n\"And she told you that, did she?\" he remarked in wrath. \"She\nventures to trouble herself about my affairs, does she? I wonder\npeople can't mind their own business without interfering with mine.\nYour daughter, Mrs. Gerhardt, is perfectly safe with me. I have no\nintention of doing her an injury. It's a shame,\" he added indignantly,\n\"that a girl can't come to my room in this hotel without having her\nmotive questioned. I'll look into this matter.\"\n\n\"I hope you don't think that I have anything to do with it,\" said\nthe mother apologetically. \"I know you like Jennie and wouldn't injure\nher. You've done so much for her and all of us, Mr. Brander, I feel\nashamed to keep her away.\"\n\n\"That's all right, Mrs. Gerhardt,\" he said quietly. \"You did\nperfectly right. I don't blame you in the least. It is the lying\naccusation passed about in this hotel that I object to. We'll see\nabout that.\"\n\nMrs. Gerhardt stood there, pale with excitement. She was afraid she\nhad deeply offended this man who had done so much for them. If she\ncould only say something, she thought, that would clear this matter up\nand make him feel that she was no tattler. Scandal was distressing to\nher.\n\n\"I thought I was doing everything for the best,\" she said at\nlast.\n\n\"So you were,\" he replied. \"I like Jennie very much. I have always\nenjoyed her coming here. It is my intention to do well by her, but\nperhaps it will be better to keep her away, at least for the\npresent.\"\n\nAgain that evening the Senator sat in his easy-chair and brooded\nover this new development. Jennie was really much more precious to him\nthan he had thought. Now that he had no hope of seeing her there any\nmore, he began to realize how much these little visits of hers had\nmeant. He thought the matter over very carefully, realized instantly\nthat there was nothing to be done so far as the hotel gossip was\nconcerned, and concluded that he had really placed the girl in a very\nunsatisfactory position.\n\n\"Perhaps I had better end this little affair,\" he thought. \"It\nisn't a wise thing to pursue.\"\n\nOn the strength of this conclusion he went to Washington and\nfinished his term. Then he returned to Columbus to await the friendly\nrecognition from the President which was to send him upon some\nministry abroad. Jennie had not been forgotten in the least. The\nlonger he stayed away the more eager he was to get back. When he was\nagain permanently settled in his old quarters he took up his cane one\nmorning and strolled out in the direction of the cottage. Arriving\nthere, he made up his mind to go in, and knocking at the door, he was\ngreeted by Mrs. Gerhardt and her daughter with astonished and\ndiffident smiles. He explained vaguely that he had been away, and\nmentioned his laundry as if that were the object of his visit. Then,\nwhen chance gave him a few moments with Jennie alone, he plunged in\nboldly.\n\n\"How would you like to take a drive with me to-morrow evening?\" he\nasked.\n\n\"I'd like it,\" said Jennie, to whom the proposition was a glorious\nnovelty.\n\nHe smiled and patted her cheek, foolishly happy to see her again.\nEvery day seemed to add to her beauty. Graced with her clean white\napron, her shapely head crowned by the glory of her simply plaited\nhair, she was a pleasing sight for any man to look upon.\n\nHe waited until Mrs. Gerhardt returned, and then, having\naccomplished the purpose of his visit, he arose.\n\n\"I'm going to take your daughter out riding to-morrow evening,\" he\nexplained. \"I want to talk to her about her future.\"\n\n\"Won't that be nice?\" said the mother. She saw nothing incongruous\nin the proposal. They parted with smiles and much handshaking.\n\n\"That man has the best heart,\" commented Mrs. Gerhardt. \"Doesn't he\nalways speak so nicely of you? He may help you to an education. You\nought to be proud.\"\n\n\"I am,\" said Jennie frankly.\n\n\"I don't know whether we had better tell your father or not,\"\nconcluded Mrs. Gerhardt. \"He doesn't like for you to be out\nevenings.\"\n\nFinally they decided not to tell him. He might not understand.\n\nJennie was ready when he called. He could see by the weak-flamed,\nunpretentious parlor-lamp that she was dressed for him, and that the\noccasion had called out the best she had. A pale lavender gingham,\nstarched and ironed, until it was a model of laundering, set off her\npretty figure to perfection. There were little lace-edged cuffs and a\nrather high collar attached to it. She had no gloves, nor any jewelry,\nnor yet a jacket good enough to wear, but her hair was done up in such\na dainty way that it set off her well-shaped head better than any hat,\nand the few ringlets that could escape crowned her as with a halo.\nWhen Brander suggested that she should wear a jacket she hesitated a\nmoment; then she went in and borrowed her mother's cape, a plain gray\nwoolen one. Brander realized now that she had no jacket, and suffered\nkeenly to think that she had contemplated going without one.\n\n\"She would have endured the raw night air,\" he thought, \"and said\nnothing of it.\"\n\nHe looked at her and shook his head reflectively. Then they\nstarted, and he quickly forgot everything but the great fact that she\nwas at his side. She talked with freedom and with a gentle girlish\nenthusiasm that he found irresistibly charming.\n\n\"Why, Jennie,\" he said, when she had called upon him to notice how\nsoft the trees looked, where, outlined dimly against the new rising\nmoon, they were touched with its yellow light, \"you're a great one. I\nbelieve you would write poetry if you were schooled a little.\"\n\n\"Do you suppose I could?\" she asked innocently.\n\n\"Do I suppose, little girl?\" he said, taking her hand. \"Do I\nsuppose? Why, I know. You're the dearest little day-dreamer in the\nworld. Of course you could write poetry. You live it. You are poetry,\nmy dear. Don't you worry about writing any.\"\n\nThis eulogy touched her as nothing else possibly could have done.\nHe was always saying such nice things. No one ever seemed to like or\nto appreciate her half as much as he did. And how good he was!\nEverybody said that. Her own father.\n\nThey rode still farther, until suddenly remembering, he said: \"I\nwonder what time it is. Perhaps we had better be turning back. Have\nyou your watch?\"\n\nJennie started, for this watch had been the one thing of which she\nhad hoped he would not speak. Ever since he had returned it had been\non her mind.\n\nIn his absence the family finances had become so strained that she\nhad been compelled to pawn it. Martha had got to that place in the\nmatter of apparel where she could no longer go to school unless\nsomething new were provided for her. And so, after much discussion, it\nwas decided that the watch must go.\n\nBass took it, and after much argument with the local pawn broker,\nhe had been able to bring home ten dollars. Mrs. Gerhardt expended the\nmoney upon her children, and heaved a sigh of relief. Martha looked\nvery much better. Naturally, Jennie was glad.\n\nNow, however, when the Senator spoke of it, her hour of retribution\nseemed at hand. She actually trembled, and he noticed her\ndiscomfiture.\n\n\"Why, Jennie,\" he said gently, \"what made you start like that?\"\n\n\"Nothing,\" she answered.\n\n\"Haven't you your watch?\"\n\nShe paused, for it seemed impossible to tell a deliberate\nfalsehood. There was a strained silence; then she said, with a voice\nthat had too much of a sob in it for him not to suspect the truth,\n\"No, sir.\" He persisted, and she confessed everything.\n\n\"Well,\" he said, \"dearest, don't feel badly about it. There never\nwas such another girl. I'll get your watch for you. Hereafter when you\nneed anything I want you to come to me. Do you hear? I want you to\npromise me that. If I'm not here, I want you to write me. I'll always\nbe in touch with you from now on. You will have my address. Just let\nme know, and I'll help you. Do you understand?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Jennie.\n\n\"You'll promise to do that now, will you?'\n\n\"Yes,\" she replied.\n\nFor a moment neither of them spoke.\n\n\"Jennie,\" he said at last, the spring-like quality of the night\nmoving him to a burst of feeling, \"I've about decided that I can't do\nwithout you. Do you think you could make up your mind to live with me\nfrom now on?\"\n\nJennie looked away, not clearly understanding his words as he meant\nthem.\n\n\"I don't know,\" she said vaguely.\n\n\"Well, you think about it,\" he said pleasantly. \"I'm serious. Would\nyou be willing to marry me, and let me put you away in a seminary for\na few years?\"\n\n\"Go away to school?\"\n\n\"Yes, after you marry me.\"\n\n\"I guess so,\" she replied. Her mother came into her mind. Maybe she\ncould help the family.\n\nHe looked around at her, and tried to make out the expression on\nher face. It was not dark. The moon was now above the trees in the\neast, and already the vast host of stars were paling before it.\n\n\"Don't you care for me at all, Jennie?\" he asked.\n\n\"Yes!\"\n\n\"You never come for my laundry any more, though,\" he returned\npathetically. It touched her to hear him say this.\n\n\"I didn't do that,\" she answered. \"I couldn't help it; Mother\nthought it was best.\"\n\n\"So it was,\" he assented. \"Don't feel badly. I was only joking with\nyou. You'd be glad to come if you could, wouldn't you?\"\n\n\"Yes, I would,\" she answered frankly.\n\nHe took her hand and pressed it so feelingly that all his kindly\nwords seemed doubly emphasized to her. Reaching up impulsively, she\nput her arms about him. \"You're so good to me,\" she said with the\nloving tone of a daughter.\n\n\"You're my girl, Jennie,\" he said with deep feeling. \"I'd do\nanything in the world for you.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\n\nThe father of this unfortunate family, William Gerhardt, was a man\nof considerable interest on his personal side. Born in the kingdom of\nSaxony, he had had character enough to oppose the army conscription\niniquity, and to flee, in his eighteenth year, to Paris. From there he\nhad set forth for America, the land of promise.\n\nArrived in this country, he had made his way, by slow stages, from\nNew York to Philadelphia, and thence westward, working for a time in\nthe various glass factories in Pennsylvania. In one romantic village\nof this new world he had found his heart's ideal. With her, a simple\nAmerican girl of German extraction, he had removed to Youngstown, and\nthence to Columbus, each time following a glass manufacturer by the\nname of Hammond, whose business prospered and waned by turns.\n\nGerhardt was an honest man, and he liked to think that others\nappreciated his integrity. \"William,\" his employer used to say to him,\n\"I want you because I can trust you,\" and this, to him, was more than\nsilver and gold.\n\nThis honesty, like his religious convictions, was wholly due to\ninheritance. He had never reasoned about it. Father and grandfather\nbefore him were sturdy German artisans, who had never cheated anybody\nout of a dollar, and this honesty of intention came into his veins\nundiminished.\n\nHis Lutheran proclivities had been strengthened by years of\nchurch-going and the religious observances of home life, In his\nfather's cottage the influence of the Lutheran minister had been\nall-powerful; he had inherited the feeling that the Lutheran Church\nwas a perfect institution, and that its teachings were of\nall-importance when it came to the issue of the future life. His wife,\nnominally of the Mennonite faith, was quite willing to accept her\nhusband's creed. And so his household became a God-fearing one;\nwherever they went their first public step was to ally themselves with\nthe local Lutheran church, and the minister was always a welcome guest\nin the Gerhardt home.\n\nPastor Wundt, the shepherd of the Columbus church, was a sincere\nand ardent Christian, but his bigotry and hard-and-fast orthodoxy made\nhim intolerant. He considered that the members of his flock were\njeopardizing their eternal salvation if they danced, played cards, or\nwent to theaters, and he did not hesitate to declare vociferously that\nhell was yawning for those who disobeyed his injunctions. Drinking,\neven temperately, was a sin. Smoking--well, he smoked himself.\nRight conduct in marriage, however, and innocence before that state\nwere absolute essentials of Christian living. Let no one talk of\nsalvation, he had said, for a daughter who had failed to keep her\nchastity unstained, or for the parents who, by negligence, had\npermitted her to fall. Hell was yawning for all such. You must walk\nthe straight and narrow way if you would escape eternal punishment,\nand a just God was angry with sinners every day.\n\nGerhardt and his wife, and also Jennie, accepted the doctrines of\ntheir Church as expounded by Mr. Wundt without reserve. With Jennie,\nhowever, the assent was little more than nominal. Religion had as yet\nno striking hold upon her. It was a pleasant thing to know that there\nwas a heaven, a fearsome one to realize that there was a hell. Young\ngirls and boys ought to be good and obey their parents. Otherwise the\nwhole religious problem was badly jumbled in her mind.\n\nGerhardt was convinced that everything spoken from the pulpit of\nhis church was literally true. Death and the future life were\nrealities to him.\n\nNow that the years were slipping away and the problem of the world\nwas becoming more and more inexplicable, he clung with pathetic\nanxiety to the doctrines which contained a solution. Oh, if he could\nonly be so honest and upright that the Lord might have no excuse for\nruling him out. He trembled not only for himself, but for his wife and\nchildren. Would he not some day be held responsible for them? Would\nnot his own laxity and lack of system in inculcating the laws of\neternal life to them end in his and their damnation? He pictured to\nhimself the torments of hell, and wondered how it would be with him\nand his in the final hour.\n\nNaturally, such a deep religious feeling made him stern with his\nchildren. He was prone to scan with a narrow eye the pleasures and\nfoibles of youthful desire. Jennie was never to have a lover if her\nfather had any voice in the matter. Any flirtation with the youths she\nmight meet upon the streets of Columbus could have no continuation in\nher home. Gerhardt forgot that he was once young himself, and looked\nonly to the welfare of her spirit. So the Senator was a novel factor\nin her life.\n\nWhen he first began to be a part of their family affairs the\nconventional standards of Father Gerhardt proved untrustworthy. He had\nno means of judging such a character. This was no ordinary person\ncoquetting with his pretty daughter. The manner in which the Senator\nentered the family life was so original and so plausible that he\nbecame an active part before any one thought anything about it.\nGerhardt himself was deceived, and, expecting nothing but honor and\nprofit to flow to the family from such a source, accepted the interest\nand the service, and plodded peacefully on. His wife did not tell him\nof the many presents which had come before and since the wonderful\nChristmas.\n\nBut one morning as Gerhardt was coming home from his night work a\nneighbor named Otto Weaver accosted him.\n\n\"Gerhardt,\" he said, \"I want to speak a word with you. As a friend\nof yours, I want to tell you what I hear. The neighbors, you know,\nthey talk now about the man who comes to see your daughter.\"\n\n\"My daughter?\" said Gerhardt, more puzzled and pained by this\nabrupt attack than mere words could indicate. \"Whom do you mean? I\ndon't know of any one who comes to see my daughter.\"\n\n\"No?\" inquired Weaver, nearly as much astonished as the recipient\nof his confidences. \"The middle-aged man, with gray hair. He carries a\ncane sometimes. You don't know him?\"\n\nGerhardt racked his memory with a puzzled face.\n\n\"They say he was a senator once,\" went on Weaver, doubtful of what\nhe had got into; \"I don't know.\"\n\n\"Ah,\" returned Gerhardt, measurably relieved. \"Senator Brander.\nYes. He has come sometimes--so. Well, what of it?\"\n\n\"It is nothing,\" returned the neighbor, \"only they talk. He is no\nlonger a young man, you know. Your daughter, she goes out with him now\na few times. These people, they see that, and now they talk about her.\nI thought you might want to know.\"\n\nGerhardt was shocked to the depths of his being by these terrible\nwords. People must have a reason for saying such things. Jennie and\nher mother were seriously at fault. Still he did not hesitate to\ndefend his daughter.\n\n\"He is a friend of the family,\" he said confusedly. \"People should\nnot talk until they know. My daughter has done nothing.\"\n\n\"That is so. It is nothing,\" continued Weaver. \"People talk before\nthey have any grounds. You and I are old friends. I thought you might\nwant to know.\"\n\nGerhardt stood there motionless another minute or so t his jaw\nfallen and a strange helplessness upon him. The world was such a grim\nthing to have antagonistic to you. Its opinions and good favor were so\nessential. How hard he had tried to live up to its rules! Why should\nit not be satisfied and let him alone?\n\n\"I am glad you told me,\" he murmured as he started homeward. \"I\nwill see about it. Good-by.\"\n\nGerhardt took the first opportunity to question his wife.\n\n\"What is this about Senator Brander coming out to call on Jennie?\"\nhe asked in German. \"The neighbors are talking about it.\"\n\n\"Why, nothing,\" answered Mrs. Gerhardt, in the same language. She\nwas decidedly taken aback at his question. \"He did call two or three\ntimes.\"\n\n\"You didn't tell me that,\" he returned, a sense of her frailty in\ntolerating and shielding such weakness in one of their children\nirritating him.\n\n\"No,\" she replied, absolutely nonplussed. \"He has only been here\ntwo or three times.\"\n\n\"Two or three times!\" exclaimed Gerhardt, the German tendency to\ntalk loud coming upon him. \"Two or three times! The whole neighborhood\ntalks about it. What is this, then?\"\n\n\"He only called two or three times,\" Mrs. Gerhardt repeated\nweakly.\n\n\"Weaver comes to me on the street,\" continued Gerhardt, \"and tells\nme that my neighbors are talking of the man my daughter is going with.\nI didn't know anything about it. There I stood. I didn't know what to\nsay. What kind of a way is that? What must the man think of me?\"\n\n\"There is nothing the matter,\" declared the mother, using an\neffective German idiom. \"Jennie has gone walking with him once or\ntwice. He has called here at the house. What is there now in that for\nthe people to talk about? Can't the girl have any pleasure at\nall?\"\n\n\"But he is an old man,\" returned Gerhardt, voicing the words of\nWeaver. \"He is a public citizen. What should he want to call on a girl\nlike Jennie for?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" said Mrs. Gerhardt, defensively. \"He comes here to\nthe house. I don't know anything but good about the man. Can I tell\nhim not to come?\"\n\nGerhardt paused at this. All that he knew of the Senator was\nexcellent. What was there now that was so terrible about it?\n\n\"The neighbors are so ready to talk. They haven't got anything else\nto talk about now, so they talk about Jennie. You know whether she is\na good girl or not. Why should they say such things?\" and tears came\ninto the soft little mother's eyes.\n\n\"That is all right,\" grumbled Gerhardt, \"but he ought not to want\nto come around and take a girl of her age out walking. It looks bad,\neven if he don't mean any harm.\"\n\nAt this moment Jennie came in. She had heard the talking in the\nfront bedroom, where she slept with one of the children, but had not\nsuspected its import. Now her mother turned her back and bent over the\ntable where she was making biscuit, in order that her daughter might\nnot see her red eyes.\n\n\"What's the matter?\" she inquired, vaguely troubled by the tense\nstillness in the attitude of both her parents.\n\n\"Nothing,\" said Gerhardt firmly.\n\nMrs. Gerhardt made no sign, but her very immobility told something.\nJennie went over to her and quickly discovered that she had been\nweeping.\n\n\"What's the matter?\" she repeated wonderingly, gazing at her\nfather.\n\nGerhardt only stood there, his daughter's innocence dominating his\nterror of evil.\n\n\"What's the matter?\" she urged softly of her mother.\n\n\"Oh, it's the neighbors,\" returned the mother brokenly.\n\n\"They're always ready to talk about something they don't know\nanything about.\"\n\n\"Is it me again?\" inquired Jennie, her face flushing faintly.\n\n\"You see,\" observed Gerhardt, apparently addressing the world in\ngeneral, \"she knows. Now, why didn't you tell me that he was coming\nhere? The neighbors talk, and I hear nothing about it until to-day.\nWhat kind of a way is that, anyhow?\"\n\n\"Oh,\" exclaimed Jennie, out of the purest sympathy for her mother,\n\"what difference does it make?\"\n\n\"What difference?\" cried Gerhardt, still talking in German,\nalthough Jennie answered in English. \"Is it no difference that men\nstop me on the street and speak of it? You should be ashamed of\nyourself to say that. I always thought well of this man, but now,\nsince you don't tell me about him, and the neighbors talk, I don't\nknow what to think. Must I get my knowledge of what is going on in my\nown home from my neighbors?\"\n\nMother and daughter paused. Jennie had already begun to think that\ntheir error was serious.\n\n\"I didn't keep anything from you because it was evil,\" she said.\n\"Why, he only took me out riding once.\"\n\n\"Yes, but you didn't tell me that,\" answered her father.\n\n\"You know you don't like for me to go out after dark,\" replied\nJennie. \"That's why I didn't. There wasn't anything else to hide about\nit.\"\n\n\"He shouldn't want you to go out after dark with him,\" observed\nGerhardt, always mindful of the world outside. \"What can he want with\nyou. Why does he come here? He is too old, anyhow. I don't think you\nought to have anything to do with him--such a young girl as you\nare.\"\n\n\"He doesn't want to do anything except help me,\" murmured Jennie.\n\"He wants to marry me.\"\n\n\"Marry you? Ha! Why doesn't he tell me that!\" exclaimed Gerhardt.\n\"I shall look into this. I won't have him running around with my\ndaughter, and the neighbors talking. Besides, he is too old. I shall\ntell him that. He ought to know better than to put a girl where she\ngets talked about. It is better he should stay away altogether.\"\n\nThis threat of Gerhardt's, that he would tell Brander to stay away,\nseemed simply terrible to Jennie and to her mother. What good could\ncome of any such attitude? Why must they be degraded before him? Of\ncourse Brander did call again, while Gerhardt was away at work, and\nthey trembled lest the father should hear of it. A few days later the\nSenator came and took Jennie for a long walk. Neither she nor her\nmother said anything to Gerhardt. But he was not to be put off the\nscent for long.\n\n\"Has Jennie been out again with that man?\" he inquired of Mrs.\nGerhardt the next evening.\n\n\"He was here last night,\" returned the mother, evasively.\n\n\"Did she tell him he shouldn't come any more?\"\n\n\"I don't know. I don't think so.\"\n\n\"Well, now, I will see for myself once whether this thing will be\nstopped or not,\" said the determined father. \"I shall talk with him.\nWait till he comes again.\"\n\nIn accordance with this, he took occasion to come up from his\nfactory on three different evenings, each time carefully surveying the\nhouse, in order to discover whether any visitor was being entertained.\nOn the fourth evening Brander came, and inquiring for Jennie, who was\nexceedingly nervous, he took her out for a walk. She was afraid of her\nfather, lest some unseemly things should happen, but did not know\nexactly what to do.\n\nGerhardt, who was on his way to the house at the time, observed her\ndeparture. That was enough for him. Walking deliberately in upon his\nwife, he said:\n\n\"Where is Jennie?\"\n\n\"She is out somewhere,\" said her mother.\n\n\"Yes, I know where,\" said Gerhardt. \"I saw her. Now wait till she\ncomes home. I will tell him.\"\n\nHe sat down calmly, reading a German paper and keeping an eye upon\nhis wife, until, at last, the gate clicked, and the front door opened.\nThen he got up.\n\n\"Where have you been?\" he exclaimed in German.\n\nBrander, who had not suspected that any trouble of this character\nwas pending, felt irritated and uncomfortable. Jennie was covered with\nconfusion. Her mother was suffering an agony of torment in the\nkitchen.\n\n\"Why, I have been out for a walk,\" she answered confusedly.\n\n\"Didn't I tell you not to go out any more after dark?\" said\nGerhardt, utterly ignoring Brander.\n\nJennie colored furiously, unable to speak a word.\n\n\"What is the trouble?\" inquired Brander gravely. \"Why should you\ntalk to her like that?\"\n\n\"She should not go out after dark,\" returned the father rudely. \"I\nhave told her two or three times now. I don't think you ought to come\nhere any more, either.\"\n\n\"And why?\" asked the Senator, pausing to consider and choose his\nwords. \"Isn't this rather peculiar? What has your daughter done?\"\n\n\"What has she done!\" exclaimed Gerhardt, his excitement growing\nunder the strain he was enduring, and speaking almost unaccented\nEnglish in consequence. \"She is running around the streets at night\nwhen she oughtn't to be. I don't want my daughter taken out after dark\nby a man of your age. What do you want with her anyway? She is only a\nchild yet.\"\n\n\"Want!\" said the Senator, straining to regain his ruffled dignity.\n\"I want to talk with her, of course. She is old enough to be\ninteresting to me. I want to marry her if she will have me.\"\n\n\"I want you to go out of here and stay out of here,\" returned the\nfather, losing all sense of logic, and descending to the ordinary\nlevel of parental compulsion. \"I don't want you to come around my\nhouse any more. I have enough trouble without my daughter being taken\nout and given a bad name.\"\n\n\"I tell you frankly,\" said the Senator, drawing himself up to his\nfull height, \"that you will have to make clear your meaning. I have\ndone nothing that I am ashamed of. Your daughter has not come to any\nharm through me. Now, I want to know what you mean by conducting\nyourself in this manner.\"\n\n\"I mean,\" said Gerhardt, excitedly repeating himself, \"I mean, I\nmean that the whole neighborhood talks about how you come around here,\nand have buggy-rides and walks with my daughter when I am not\nhere--that's what I mean. I mean that you are no man of honorable\nintentions, or you would not come taking up with a little girl who is\nonly old enough to be your daughter. People tell me well enough what\nyou are. Just you go and leave my daughter alone.\"\n\n\"People!\" said the Senator. \"Well, I care nothing for your people.\nI love your daughter, and I am here to see her because I do love her.\nIt is my intention to marry her, and if your neighbors have anything\nto say to that, let them say it. There is no reason why you should\nconduct yourself in this manner before you know what my intentions\nare.\"\n\nUnnerved by this unexpected and terrible altercation, Jennie had\nbacked away to the door leading out into the dining-room, and her\nmother, seeing her, came forward.\n\n\"Oh,\" said the latter, breathing excitedly, \"he came home when you\nwere away. What shall we do?\" They clung together, as women do, and\nwept silently. The dispute continued.\n\n\"Marry, eh,\" exclaimed the father. \"Is that it?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said the Senator, \"marry, that is exactly it. Your daughter\nis eighteen years of age and can decide for herself. You have insulted\nme and outraged your daughter's feelings. Now, I wish you to know that\nit cannot stop here. If you have any cause to say anything against me\noutside of mere hearsay I wish you to say it.\"\n\nThe Senator stood before him, a very citadel of righteousness. He\nwas neither loud-voiced nor angry-mannered, but there was a tightness\nabout his lips which bespoke the man of force and determination.\n\n\"I don't want to talk to you any more,\" returned Gerhardt, who was\nchecked but not overawed. \"My daughter is my daughter. I am the one\nwho will say whether she shall go out at night, or whether she shall\nmarry you, either. I know what you politicians are. When I first met\nyou I thought you were a fine man, but now, since I see the way you\nconduct yourself with my daughter, I don't want anything more to do\nwith you. Just you go and stay away from here. That's all I ask of\nyou.\"\n\n\"I am sorry, Mrs. Gerhardt,\" said Brander, turning deliberately\naway from the angry father, \"to have had such an argument in your\nhome. I had no idea that your husband was opposed to my visits.\nHowever, I will leave the matter as it stands for the present. You\nmust not take all this as badly as it seems.\"\n\nGerhardt looked on in astonishment at his coolness.\n\n\"I will go now,\" he said, again addressing Gerhardt, \"but you\nmustn't think that I am leaving this matter for good. You have made a\nserious mistake this evening. I hope you will realize that. I bid you\ngoodnight.\" He bowed slightly and went out.\n\nGerhardt closed the door firmly. \"Now,\" he said, turning to his\ndaughter and wife, \"we will see whether we are rid of him or not. I\nwill show you how to go after night upon the streets when everybody is\ntalking already.\"\n\nIn so far as words were concerned, the argument ceased, but looks\nand feeling ran strong and deep, and for days thereafter scarcely a\nword was spoken in the little cottage. Gerhardt began to brood over\nthe fact that he had accepted his place from the Senator and decided\nto give it up. He made it known that no more of the Senator's washing\nwas to be done in their house, and if he had not been sure that Mrs.\nGerhardt's hotel work was due to her own efforts in finding it he\nwould have stopped that. No good would come out of it, anyway. If she\nhad never gone to the hotel all this talk would never have come upon\nthem.\n\nAs for the Senator, he went away decidedly ruffled by this crude\noccurrence. Neighborhood slanders are bad enough on their own plane,\nbut for a man of his standing to descend and become involved in one\nstruck him now as being a little bit unworthy. He did not know what to\ndo about the situation, and while he was trying to come to some\ndecision several days went by. Then he was called to Washington, and\nhe went away without having seen Jennie again.\n\nIn the mean time the Gerhardt family struggled along as before.\nThey were poor, indeed, but Gerhardt was willing to face poverty if\nonly it could be endured with honor. The grocery bills were of the\nsame size, however. The children's clothing was steadily wearing out.\nEconomy had to be practised, and payments stopped on old bills that\nGerhardt was trying to adjust.\n\nThen came a day when the annual interest on the mortgage was due,\nand yet another when two different grocery-men met Gerhardt on the\nstreet and asked about their little bills. He did not hesitate to\nexplain just what the situation was, and to tell them with convincing\nhonesty that he would try hard and do the best he could. But his\nspirit was unstrung by his misfortunes. He prayed for the favor of\nHeaven while at his labor, and did not hesitate to use the daylight\nhours that he should have had for sleeping to go about--either\nlooking for a more remunerative position or to obtain such little jobs\nas he could now and then pick up. One of them was that of cutting\ngrass.\n\nMrs. Gerhardt protested that he was killing himself, but he\nexplained his procedure by pointing to their necessity.\n\n\"When people stop me on the street and ask me for money I have no\ntime to sleep.\"\n\nIt was a distressing situation for all of them.\n\nTo cap it all, Sebastian got in jail. It was that old coal-stealing\nruse of his practised once too often. He got up on a car one evening\nwhile Jennie and the children waited for him, and a railroad detective\narrested him. There had been a good deal of coal stealing during the\npast two years, but so long as it was confined to moderate quantities\nthe railroad took no notice. When, however, customers of shippers\ncomplained that cars from the Pennsylvania fields lost thousands of\npounds in transit to Cleveland, Cincinnati, Chicago, and other points,\ndetectives were set to work. Gerhardt's children were not the only\nones who preyed upon the railroad in this way. Other families in\nColumbus--many of them--were constantly doing the same thing,\nbut Sebastian happened to be seized upon as the Columbus example.\n\n\"You come off that car now,\" said the detective, suddenly appearing\nout of the shadow. Jennie and the other children dropped their baskets\nand buckets and fled for their lives. Sebastian's first impulse was to\njump and run, but when he tried it the detective grabbed him by the\ncoat.\n\n\"Hold on here,\" he exclaimed. \"I want you.\"\n\n\"Aw, let go,\" said Sebastian savagely, for he was no weakling.\nThere was nerve and determination in him, as well as a keen sense of\nhis awkward predicament.\n\n\"Let go, I tell you,\" he reiterated, and giving a jerk, he almost\nupset his captor.\n\n\"Come here now,\" said the detective, pulling him viciously in an\neffort to establish his authority.\n\nSebastian came, but it was with a blow which staggered his\nadversary.\n\nThere was more struggling, and then a passing railroad hand came to\nthe detective's assistance. Together they hurried him toward the\ndepot, and there discovering the local officer, turned him over. It\nwas with a torn coat, scarred hands and face, and a black eye that\nSebastian was locked up for the night.\n\nWhen the children came home they could not say what had happened to\ntheir brother, but as nine o'clock struck, and then ten and eleven,\nand Sebastian did not return, Mrs. Gerhardt was beside herself. He had\nstayed out many a night as late as twelve and one, but his mother had\na foreboding of something terrible tonight. When half-past one\narrived, and no Sebastian, she began to cry.\n\n\"Some one ought to go up and tell your father,\" she said. \"He may\nbe in jail.\"\n\nJennie volunteered, but George, who was soundly sleeping, was\nawakened to go along with her.\n\n\"What!\" said Gerhardt, astonished to see his two children.\n\n\"Bass hasn't come yet,\" said Jennie, and then told the story of the\nevening's adventure in explanation.\n\nGerhardt left his work at once, walking back with his two children\nto a point where he could turn off to go to the jail. He guessed what\nhad happened, and his heart was troubled.\n\n\"Is that so, now!\" he repeated nervously, rubbing his clumsy hands\nacross his wet forehead.\n\nArrived at the station-house, the sergeant in charge told him\ncurtly that Bass was under arrest.\n\n\"Sebastian Gerhardt?\" he said, looking over his blotter; \"yes, here\nhe is. Stealing coal and resisting an officer. Is he your boy?\"\n\n\"Oh, my!\" said Gerhardt, \"Ach Gott!\" He actually wrung his\nhands in distress.\n\n\"Want to see him?\" asked the Sergeant.\n\n\"Yes, yes,\" said the father.\n\n\"Take him back, Fred,\" said the other to the old watchman in\ncharge, \"and let him see the boy.\"\n\nWhen Gerhardt stood in the back room, and Sebastian was brought out\nall marked and tousled, he broke down and began to cry. No word could\ncross his lips because of his emotion.\n\n\"Don't cry, pop,\" said Sebastian bravely. \"I couldn't help it. It's\nall right. I'll be out in the morning.\"\n\nGerhardt only shook with his grief.\n\n\"Don't cry,\" continued Sebastian, doing his very best to restrain\nhis own tears. \"I'll be all right. What's the use of crying?\"\n\n\"I know, I know,\" said the gray-headed parent brokenly, \"but I\ncan't help it. It is my fault that I should let you do that.\"\n\n\"No, no, it isn't,\" said Sebastian. \"You couldn't help it. Does\nmother know anything about it?\"\n\n\"Yes, she knows,\" he returned. \"Jennie and George just came up\nwhere I was and told me. I didn't know anything about it until just\nnow,\" and he began to cry again.\n\n\"Well, don't you feel badly,\" went on Bass, the finest part of his\nnature coming to the surface. \"I'll be all right. Just you go back to\nwork now, and don't worry. I'll be all right.\"\n\n\"How did you hurt your eye?\" asked the father, looking at him with\nred eyes.\n\n\"Oh, I had a little wrestling match with the man who nabbed me,\"\nsaid the boy, smiling bravely. \"I thought I could get away.\"\n\n\"You shouldn't do that, Sebastian,\" said the father. \"It may go\nharder with you on that account. When does your case come up?\"\n\n\"In the morning, they told me,\" said Bass. \"Nine o'clock.\"\n\nGerhardt stayed with his son for some time, and discussed the\nquestion of bail, fine, and the dire possibility of a jail sentence\nwithout arriving at any definite conclusion. Finally he was persuaded\nby Bass to go away, but the departure was the occasion for another\noutburst of feeling; he was led away shaking and broken with\nemotion.\n\n\"It's pretty tough,\" said Bass to himself as he was led back to his\ncell. He was thinking solely of his father. \"I wonder what ma will\nthink.\"\n\nThe thought of this touched him tenderly. \"I wish I'd knocked the\ndub over the first crack,\" he said. \"What a fool I was not to get\naway.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\n\nGerhardt was in despair; he did not know any one to whom he could\nappeal between the hours of two and nine o'clock in the morning. He\nwent back to talk with his wife, and then to his post of duty. What\nwas to be done? He could think of only one friend who was able, or\npossibly willing to do anything. This was the glass manufacturer,\nHammond; but he was not in the city. Gerhardt did not know this,\nhowever.\n\nWhen nine o'clock came, he went alone to the court, for it was\nthought advisable that the others should stay away. Mrs. Gerhardt was\nto hear immediately what happened. He would come right back.\n\nWhen Sebastian was lined up inside the dock he had to wait a long\ntime, for there were several prisoners ahead of him. Finally his name\nwas called, and the boy was pushed forward to the bar. \"Stealing coal,\nYour Honor, and resisting arrest,\" explained the officer who had\narrested him.\n\nThe magistrate looked at Sebastian closely; he was unfavorably\nimpressed by the lad's scratched and wounded face.\n\n\"Well, young man,\" he said, \"what have you to say for yourself? How\ndid you get your black eye?\"\n\nSebastian looked at the judge, but did not answer.\n\n\"I arrested him,\" said the detective. \"He was on one of the\ncompany's cars. He tried to break away from me, and when I held him he\nassaulted me. This man here was a witness,\" he added, turning to the\nrailroad hand who had helped him.\n\n\"Is that where he struck you?\" asked the Court, observing the\ndetective's swollen jaw.\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" he returned, glad of an opportunity to be further\nrevenged.\n\n\"If you please,\" put in Gerhardt, leaning forward, \"he is my boy.\nHe was sent to get the coal. He--\"\n\n\"We don't mind what they pick up around the yard,\" interrupted the\ndetective, \"but he was throwing it off the cars to half a dozen\nothers.\"\n\n\"Can't you earn enough to keep from taking coal off the coal cars?\"\nasked the Court; but before either father or son had time to answer he\nadded, \"What is your business?\"\n\n\"Car builder,\" said Sebastian.\n\n\"And what do you do?\" he questioned, addressing Gerhardt.\n\n\"I am watchman at Miller's furniture factory.\"\n\n\"Um,\" said the court, feeling that Sebastian's attitude remained\nsullen and contentious. \"Well, this young man might be let off on the\ncoal-stealing charge, but he seems to be somewhat too free with his\nfists. Columbus is altogether too rich in that sort of thing. Ten\ndollars.\"\n\n\"If you please,\" began Gerhardt, but the court officer was already\npushing him away.\n\n\"I don't want to hear any more about it,\" said the judge. \"He's\nstubborn, anyhow. What's the next case?\"\n\nGerhardt made his way over to his boy, abashed and yet very glad it\nwas no worse. Somehow, he thought, he could raise the money. Sebastian\nlooked at him solicitously as he came forward.\n\n\"It's all right,\" said Bass soothingly. \"He didn't give me half a\nchance to say anything.\"\n\n\"I'm only glad it wasn't more,\" said Gerhardt nervously. \"We will\ntry and get the money.\"\n\nGoing home to his wife, Gerhardt informed the troubled household of\nthe result. Mrs. Gerhardt stood white and yet relieved, for ten\ndollars seemed something that might be had. Jennie heard the whole\nstory with open mouth and wide eyes. It was a terrible blow to her.\nPoor Bass! He was always so lively and good-natured. It seemed awful\nthat he should be in jail.\n\nGerhardt went hurriedly to Hammond's fine residence, but he was not\nin the city. He thought then of a lawyer by the name of Jenkins, whom\nhe knew in a casual way, but Jenkins was not at his office. There were\nseveral grocers and coal merchants whom he knew well enough, but he\nowed them money. Pastor Wundt might let him have it, but the agony\nsuch a disclosure to that worthy would entail held him back. He did\ncall on one or two acquaintances, but these, surprised at the unusual\nand peculiar request, excused themselves. At four o'clock he returned\nhome, weary and exhausted.\n\n\"I don't know what to do,\" he said despairingly. \"If I could only\nthink.\"\n\nJennie thought of Brander, but the situation had not accentuated\nher desperation to the point where she could brave her father's\nopposition and his terrible insult to the Senator, so keenly\nremembered, to go and ask. Her watch had been pawned a second time,\nand she had no other means of obtaining money.\n\nThe family council lasted until half-past ten, but still there was\nnothing decided. Mrs. Gerhardt persistently and monotonously turned\none hand over in the other and stared at the floor. Gerhardt ran his\nhand through his reddish brown hair distractedly. \"It's no use,\" he\nsaid at last. \"I can't think of anything.\"\n\n\"Go to bed, Jennie,\" said her mother solicitously; \"get the others\nto go. There's no use their sitting up I may think of something. You\ngo to bed.\"\n\nJennie went to her room, but the very thought of repose was\ninsupportable. She had read in the paper, shortly after her father's\nquarrel with the Senator, that the latter had departed for Washington.\nThere had been no notice of his return. Still he might be in the city.\nShe stood before a short, narrow mirror that surmounted a shabby\nbureau, thinking. Her sister Veronica, with whom she slept, was\nalready composing herself to dreams. Finally a grim resolution fixed\nitself in her consciousness. She would go and see Senator Brander. If\nhe were in town he would help Bass. Why shouldn't she--he\nloved her. He had asked over and over to marry her. Why should she not\ngo and ask him for help?\n\nShe hesitated a little while, then hearing Veronica breathing\nregularly, she put on her hat and jacket, and noiselessly opened the\ndoor into the sitting-room to see if any one were stirring.\n\nThere was no sound save that of Gerhardt rocking nervously to and\nfro in the kitchen. There was no light save that of her own small\nroom-lamp and a gleam from under the kitchen door. She turned and blew\nthe former out--then slipped quietly to the front door, opened it\nand stepped out into the night.\n\nA waning moon was shining, and a hushed sense of growing life\nfilled the air, for it was nearing spring again. As Jennie hurried\nalong the shadowy streets--the arc light had not yet been\ninvented--she had a sinking sense of fear; what was this rash\nthing she was about to do? How would the Senator receive her? What\nwould he think? She stood stock-still, wavering and doubtful; then the\nrecollection of Bass in his night cell came over her again, and she\nhurried on.\n\nThe character of the Capitol Hotel was such that it was not\ndifficult for a woman to find ingress through the ladies' entrance to\nthe various floors of the hotel at any hour of the night. The hotel,\nnot unlike many others of the time, was in no sense loosely conducted,\nbut its method of supervision in places was lax. Any person could\nenter, and, by applying at a rear entrance to the lobby, gain the\nattention of the clerk. Otherwise not much notice was taken of those\nwho came and went.\n\nWhen she came to the door it was dark save for a low light burning\nin the entry-way. The distance to the Senator's room was only a short\nway along the hall of the second floor. She hurried up the steps,\nnervous and pale, but giving no other outward sign of the storm that\nwas surging within her. When she came to his familiar door she paused;\nshe feared that she might not find him in his room; she trembled again\nto think that he might be there. A light shone through the transom,\nand, summoning all her courage, she knocked. A man coughed and\nbestirred himself.\n\nHis surprise as he opened the door knew no bounds. \"Why, Jennie!\"\nhe exclaimed. \"How delightful! I was thinking of you. Come\nin--come in.\"\n\nHe welcomed her with an eager embrace.\n\n\"I was coming out to see you, believe me, I was. I was thinking all\nalong how I could straighten this matter out. And now you come. But\nwhat's the trouble?\"\n\nHe held her at arm's length and studied her distressed face. The\nfresh beauty of her seemed to him like cut lilies wet with dew.\n\nHe felt a great surge of tenderness.\n\n\"I have something to ask you,\" she at last brought herself to say.\n\"My brother is in jail. We need ten dollars to get him out, and I\ndidn't know where else to go.\"\n\n\"My poor child!\" he said, chafing her hands. \"Where else should you\ngo? Haven't I told you always to come to me? Don't you know, Jennie, I\nwould do anything in the world for you?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" she gasped.\n\n\"Well, then, don't worry about that any more. But won't fate ever\ncease striking at you, poor child? How did your brother come to get in\njail?\"\n\n\"They caught him throwing coal down from the cars,\" she\nreplied.\n\n\"Ah!\" he replied, his sympathies touched and awakened. Here was\nthis boy arrested and fined for what fate was practically driving him\nto do. Here was this girl pleading with him at night, in his room, for\nwhat to her was a great necessity--ten dollars; to him, a mere\nnothing. \"I will arrange about your brother,\" he said quickly. \"Don't\nworry. I can get him out in half an hour. You sit here now and be\ncomfortable until I return.\"\n\nHe waved her to his easy-chair beside a large lamp, and hurried out\nof the room.\n\nBrander knew the sheriff who had personal supervision of the county\njail. He knew the judge who had administered the fine. It was but a\nfive minutes' task to write a note to the judge asking him to revoke\nthe fine, for the sake of the boy's character, and send it by a\nmessenger to his home. Another ten minutes' task to go personally to\nthe jail and ask his friend, the sheriff, to release the boy then and\nthere.\n\n\"Here is the money,\" he said. \"If the fine is revoked you can\nreturn it to me. Let him go now.\"\n\nThe sheriff was only too glad to comply. He hastened below to\npersonally supervise the task, and Bass, a very much astonished boy,\nwas set free. No explanations were vouchsafed him.\n\n\"That's all right now,\" said the turnkey. \"You're at liberty. Run\nalong home and don't let them catch you at anything like that\nagain.\"\n\nBass went his way wondering, and the ex-Senator returned to his\nhotel trying to decide just how this delicate situation should be\nhandled. Obviously Jennie had not told her father of her mission. She\nhad come as a last resource. She was now waiting for him in his\nroom.\n\nThere are crises in all men's lives when they waver between the\nstrict fulfilment of justice and duty and the great possibilities for\npersonal happiness which another line of conduct seems to assure. And\nthe dividing line is not always marked and clear. He knew that the\nissue of taking her, even as his wife, was made difficult by the\nsenseless opposition of her father. The opinion of the world brought\nup still another complication. Supposing he should take her openly,\nwhat would the world say? She was a significant type emotionally, that\nhe knew. There was something there--artistically,\ntemperamentally, which was far and beyond the keenest suspicion of the\nherd. He did not know himself quite what it was, but he felt a\nlargeness of feeling not altogether squared with intellect, or perhaps\nbetter yet, experience, which was worthy of any man's desire. \"This\nremarkable girl,\" he thought, seeing her clearly in his mind's\neye.\n\nMeditating as to what he should do, he returned to his hotel, and\nthe room. As he entered he was struck anew with her beauty, and with\nthe irresistible appeal of her personality. In the glow of the shaded\nlamp she seemed a figure of marvelous potentiality.\n\n\"Well,\" he said, endeavoring to appear calm, \"I have looked after\nyour brother. He is out.\"\n\nShe rose.\n\n\"Oh,\" she exclaimed, clasping her hands and stretching her arms out\ntoward him. There were tears of gratefulness in her eyes.\n\nHe saw them and stepped close to her. \"Jennie, for heaven's sake\ndon't cry,\" he entreated. \"You angel! You sister of mercy! To think\nyou should have to add tears to your other sacrifices.\"\n\nHe drew her to him, and then all the caution of years deserted him.\nThere was a sense both of need and of fulfilment in his mood. At last,\nin spite of other losses, fate had brought him what he most\ndesired--love, a woman whom he could love. He took her in his\narms, and kissed her again and again.\n\nThe English Jefferies has told us that it requires a hundred and\nfifty years to make a perfect maiden. \"From all enchanted things of\nearth and air, this preciousness has been drawn. From the south wind\nthat breathed a century and a half over the green wheat; from the\nperfume of the growing grasses waving over heavy-laden clover and\nlaughing veronica, hiding the green finches, baffling the bee; from\nrose-lined hedge, woodbine, and cornflower, azure blue, where\nyellowing wheat stalks crowd up under the shadow of green firs. All\nthe devious brooklets' sweetness where the iris stays the sunlight;\nall the wild woods hold of beauty; all the broad hills of thyme and\nfreedom thrice a hundred years repeated.\n\n\"A hundred years of cowslips, bluebells, violets; purple spring and\ngolden autumn; sunshine, shower, and dewy mornings; the night\nimmortal; all the rhythm of time unrolling. A chronicle unwritten and\npast all power of writing; who shall preserve a record of the petals\nthat fell from the roses a century ago? The swallows to the house-tops\nthree hundred--times think of that! Thence she sprang, and the\nworld yearns toward her beauty as to flowers that are past. The\nloveliness of seventeen is centuries old. That is why passion is\nalmost sad.\"\n\nIf you have understood and appreciated the beauty of harebells\nthree hundred times repeated; if the quality of the roses, of the\nmusic, of the ruddy mornings and evenings of the world has ever\ntouched your heart; if all beauty were passing, and you were given\nthese things to hold in your arms before the world slipped away, would\nyou give them up?\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\n\nThe significance of the material and spiritual changes which\nsometimes overtake us are not very clear at the time. A sense of\nshock, a sense of danger, and then apparently we subside to old ways,\nbut the change has come. Never again, here or elsewhere, will we be\nthe same. Jennie pondering after the subtle emotional turn which her\nevening's sympathetic expedition had taken, was lost in a vague\nconfusion of emotions. She had no definite realization of what social\nand physical changes this new relationship to the Senator might\nentail. She was not conscious as yet of that shock which the\npossibility of maternity, even under the most favorable conditions,\nmust bring to the average woman. Her present attitude was one of\nsurprise, wonder, uncertainty; and at the same time she experienced a\ngenuine feeling of quiet happiness. Brander was a good man; now he was\ncloser to her than ever. He loved her. Because of this new\nrelationship a change in her social condition was to inevitably\nfollow. Life was to be radically different from now on--was\ndifferent at this moment. Brander assured her over and over of his\nenduring affection.\n\n\"I tell you, Jennie,\" he repeated, as she was leaving, \"I don't\nwant you to worry. This emotion of mine got the best of me, but I'll\nmarry you. I've been carried off my feet, but I'll make it up to you.\nGo home and say nothing at all. Caution your brother, if it isn't too\nlate. Keep your own counsel, and I will marry you and take you away. I\ncan't do it right now. I don't want to do it here. But I'm going to\nWashington, and I'll send for you. And here\"--he reached for his\npurse and took from it a hundred dollars, practically all he had with\nhim, \"take that. I'll send you more tomorrow. You're my girl\nnow--remember that. You belong to me.\"\n\nHe embraced her tenderly.\n\nShe went out into the night, thinking. No doubt he would do as he\nsaid. She dwelt, in imagination, upon the possibilities of a new and\nfascinating existence. Of course he would marry her. Think of it! She\nwould go to Washington--that far-off place. And her father and\nmother--they would not need to work so hard any more. And Bass,\nand Martha--she fairly glowed as she recounted to herself the\nmany ways in which she could help them all.\n\nA block away she waited for Brander, who accompanied her to her own\ngate, and waited while she made a cautious reconnaissance. She slipped\nup the steps and tried the door. It was open. She paused a moment to\nindicate to her lover that she was safe, and entered. All was silent\nwithin. She slipped to her own room and heard Veronica breathing. She\nwent quietly to where Bass slept with George. He was in bed, stretched\nout as if asleep. When she entered he asked, \"Is that you,\nJennie?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Where have you been?\"\n\n\"Listen,\" she whispered. \"Have you seen papa and mamma?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Did they know I had gone out?\"\n\n\"Ma did. She told me not to ask after you. Where have you\nbeen?\"\n\n\"I went to see Senator Brander for you.\"\n\n\"Oh, that was it. They didn't say why they let me out.\"\n\n\"Don't tell any one,\" she pleaded. \"I don't want any one to know.\nYou know how papa feels about him.\"\n\n\"All right,\" he replied. But he was curious as to what the\nex-Senator thought, what he had done, and how she had appealed to him.\nShe explained briefly, then she heard her mother come to the door.\n\n\"Jennie,\" she whispered.\n\nJennie went out.\n\n\"Oh, why did you go?\" she asked.\n\n\"I couldn't help it, ma,\" she replied. \"I thought I must do\nsomething.\"\n\n\"Why did you stay so long?\"\n\n\"He wanted to talk to me,\" she answered evasively.\n\nHer mother looked at her nervously, wanly.\n\n\"I have been so afraid, oh, so afraid. Your father went to your\nroom, but I said you were asleep. He locked the front door, but I\nopened it again. When Bass came in he wanted to call you, but I\npersuaded him to wait until morning.\"\n\nAgain she looked wistfully at her daughter.\n\n\"I'm all right, mamma,\" said Jennie encouragingly. \"I'll tell you\nall about it to-morrow. Go to bed. How does he think Bass got\nout?\"\n\n\"He doesn't know. He thought maybe they just let him go because he\ncouldn't pay the fine.\"\n\nJennie laid her hand lovingly on her mother's shoulder.\n\n\"Go to bed,\" she said.\n\nShe was already years older in thought and act. She felt as though\nshe must help her mother now as well as herself.\n\nThe days which followed were ones of dreamy uncertainty to Jennie.\nShe went over in her mind these dramatic events time and time and time\nand again. It was not such a difficult matter to tell her mother that\nthe Senator had talked again of marriage, that he proposed to come and\nget her after his next trip to Washington, that he had given her a\nhundred dollars and intended to give her more, but of that other\nmatter--the one all-important thing, she could not bring herself\nto speak. It was too sacred. The balance of the money that he had\npromised her arrived by messenger the following day, four hundred\ndollars in bills, with the admonition that she should put it in a\nlocal bank. The ex-Senator explained that he was already on his way to\nWashington, but that he would come back or send for her. \"Keep a stout\nheart,\" he wrote. \"There are better days in store for you.\"\n\nBrander was gone, and Jennie's fate was really in the balance. But\nher mind still retained all of the heart-innocence, and\nunsophistication of her youth; a certain gentle wistfulness was the\nonly outward change in her demeanor. He would surely send for her.\nThere was the mirage of a distant country and wondrous scenes looming\nup in her mind. She had a little fortune in the bank, more than she\nhad ever dreamed of, with which to help her mother. There were\nnatural, girlish anticipations of good still holding over, which made\nher less apprehensive than she could otherwise possibly have been. All\nnature, life, possibility was in the balance. It might turn good, or\nill, but with so inexperienced a soul it would not be entirely evil\nuntil it was so.\n\nHow a mind under such uncertain circumstances could retain so\ncomparatively placid a vein is one of those marvels which find their\nexplanation in the inherent trustfulness of the spirit of youth. It is\nnot often that the minds of men retain the perceptions of their\nyounger days. The marvel is not that one should thus retain, but that\nany should ever lose them Go the world over, and after you have put\naway the wonder and tenderness of youth what is there left? The few\nsprigs of green that sometimes invade the barrenness of your\nmaterialism, the few glimpses of summer which flash past the eye of\nthe wintry soul, the half hours off during the long tedium of\nburrowing, these reveal to the hardened earth-seeker the universe\nwhich the youthful mind has with it always. No fear and no favor; the\nopen fields and the light upon the hills; morning, noon, night; stars,\nthe bird-calls, the water's purl--these are the natural\ninheritance of the mind of the child. Men call it poetic, those who\nare hardened fanciful. In the days of their youth it was natural, but\nthe receptiveness of youth has departed, and they cannot see.\n\nHow this worked out in her personal actions was to be seen only in\na slightly accentuated wistfulness, a touch of which was in every\ntask. Sometimes she would wonder that no letter came, but at the same\ntime she would recall the fact that he had specified a few weeks, and\nhence the six that actually elapsed did not seem so long.\n\nIn the meanwhile the distinguished ex-Senator had gone\nlight-heartedly to his conference with the President, he had joined in\na pleasant round of social calls, and he was about to pay a short\ncountry visit to some friends in Maryland, when he was seized with a\nslight attack of fever, which confined him to his room for a few days.\nHe felt a little irritated that he should be laid up just at this\ntime, but never suspected that there was anything serious in his\nindisposition. Then the doctor discovered that he was suffering from a\nvirulent form of typhoid, the ravages of which took away his senses\nfor a time and left him very weak. He was thought to be convalescing,\nhowever, when just six weeks after he had last parted with Jennie, he\nwas seized with a sudden attack of heart failure and never regained\nconsciousness. Jennie remained blissfully ignorant of his illness and\ndid not even see the heavy-typed headlines of the announcement of his\ndeath until Bass came home that evening.\n\n\"Look here, Jennie,\" he said excitedly, \"Brander's dead!\"\n\nHe held up the newspaper, on the first column of Which was printed\nin heavy block type:\n\nDEATH OF EX-SENATOR BRANDER\n\nSudden Passing of Ohio's Distinguished Son. Succumbs to Heart Failure\nat the Arlington, in Washington.\n\nRecent attack of typhoid, from which he was thought to be recovering,\nproves fatal. Notable phases of a remarkable career.\n\nJennie looked at it in blank amazement. \"Dead?\" she exclaimed.\n\n\"There it is in the paper,\" returned Bass, his tone being that of\none who is imparting a very interesting piece of news. \"He died at ten\no'clock this morning.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\n\nJennie took the paper with but ill-concealed trembling and went\ninto the adjoining room. There she stood by the front window and\nlooked at it again, a sickening sensation of dread holding her as\nthough in a trance.\n\n\"He is dead,\" was all that her mind could formulate for the time,\nand as she stood there the voice of Bass recounting the fact to\nGerhardt in the adjoining room sounded in her ears. \"Yes, he is dead,\"\nshe heard him say; and once again she tried to get some conception of\nwhat it meant to her. But her mind seemed a blank.\n\nA moment later Mrs. Gerhardt joined her. She had heard Bass's\nannouncement and had seen Jennie leave the room, but her trouble with\nGerhardt over the Senator had caused her to be careful of any display\nof emotion. No conception of the real state of affairs ever having\ncrossed her mind, she was only interested in seeing how Jennie would\ntake this sudden annihilation of her hopes.\n\n\"Isn't it too bad?\" she said, with real sorrow. \"To think that he\nshould have to die just when he was going to do so much for\nyou--for us all.\"\n\nShe paused, expecting some word of agreement, but Jennie remained\nunwontedly dumb.\n\n\"I wouldn't feel badly,\" continued Mrs. Gerhardt. \"It can't be\nhelped. He meant to do a good deal, but you mustn't think of that now.\nIt's all over, and it can't be helped, you know.\"\n\nShe paused again, and still Jennie remained motionless and mute.\nMrs. Gerhardt, seeing how useless her words were, concluded that\nJennie wished to be alone, and she went away.\n\nStill Jennie stood there, and now, as the real significance of the\nnews began to formulate itself into consecutive thought, she began to\nrealize the wretchedness of her position, its helplessness. She went\ninto her bedroom and sat down upon the side of the bed, from which\nposition she saw a very pale, distraught face staring at her from out\nof the small mirror. She looked at it uncertainly; could that really\nbe her own countenance? \"I'll have to go away,\" she thought, and\nbegan, with the courage of despair, to wonder what refuge would be\nopen to her.\n\nIn the mean time the evening meal was announced, and, to maintain\nappearances, she went out and joined the family; the naturalness of\nher part was very difficult to sustain. Gerhardt observed her subdued\ncondition without guessing the depth of emotion which it covered. Bass\nwas too much interested in his own affairs to pay particular attention\nto anybody.\n\nDuring the days that followed Jennie pondered over the difficulties\nof her position and wondered what she should do. Money she had, it was\ntrue; but no friends, no experience, no place to go. She had always\nlived with her family. She began to feel unaccountable sinkings of\nspirit, nameless and formless fears seemed to surround and haunt her.\nOnce when she arose in the morning she felt an uncontrollable desire\nto cry, and frequently thereafter this feeling would seize upon her at\nthe most inopportune times. Mrs. Gerhardt began to note her moods, and\none afternoon she resolved to question her daughter.\n\n\"Now you must tell me what's the matter with you,\" she said\nquietly. \"Jennie, you must tell your mother everything.\"\n\nJennie, to whom confession had seemed impossible, under the\nsympathetic persistence of her mother broke down at last and made the\nfatal confession. Mrs. Gerhardt stood there, too dumb with misery to\ngive vent to a word.\n\n\"Oh!\" she said at last, a great wave of self-accusation sweeping\nover her, \"it is all my fault. I might have known. But we'll do what\nwe can.\" She broke down and sobbed aloud.\n\nAfter a time she went back to the washing she had to do, and stood\nover her tub rubbing and crying. The tears ran down her cheeks and\ndropped into the suds. Once in a while she stopped and tried to dry\nher eyes with her apron, but they soon filled again.\n\nNow that the first shock had passed, there came the vivid\nconsciousness of ever-present danger. What would Gerhardt do if he\nlearned the truth? He had often said that if ever one of his daughters\nshould act like some of those he knew he would turn her out of doors.\n\"She should not stay under my roof!\" he had exclaimed.\n\n\"I'm so afraid of your father,\" Mrs. Gerhardt often said to Jennie\nin this intermediate period. \"I don't know what he'll say.\"\n\n\"Perhaps I'd better go away,\" suggested her daughter.\n\n\"No,\" she said; \"he needn't know just yet. Wait awhile.\" But in her\nheart of hearts she knew that the evil day could not be long\npostponed.\n\nOne day, when her own suspense had reached such a pitch that it\ncould no longer be endured, Mrs. Gerhardt sent Jennie away with the\nchildren, hoping to be able to tell her husband before they returned.\nAll the morning she fidgeted about, dreading the opportune moment and\nletting him retire to his slumber without speaking. When afternoon\ncame she did not go out to work, because she could not leave with her\npainful duty unfulfilled. Gerhardt arose at four, and still she\nhesitated, knowing full well that Jennie would soon return and that\nthe specially prepared occasion would then be lost. It is almost\ncertain that she would not have had the courage to say anything if he\nhimself had not brought up the subject of Jennie's appearance.\n\n\"She doesn't look well,\" he said. \"There seems to be something the\nmatter with her.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" began Mrs. Gerhardt, visibly struggling with her fears, and\nmoved to make an end of it at any cost, \"Jennie is in trouble. I don't\nknow what to do. She--\"\n\nGerhardt, who had unscrewed a door-lock and was trying to mend it,\nlooked up sharply from his work.\n\n\"What do you mean?\" he asked.\n\nMrs. Gerhardt had her apron in her hands at the time, her nervous\ntendency to roll it coming upon her. She tried to summon sufficient\ncourage to explain, but fear mastered her completely; she lifted the\napron to her eyes and began to cry.\n\nGerhardt looked at her and rose. He was a man with the Calvin type\nof face, rather spare, with skin sallow and discolored as the result\nof age and work in the wind and rain. When he was surprised or angry\nsparks of light glittered in his eyes. He frequently pushed his hair\nback when he was troubled, and almost invariably walked the floor;\njust now he looked alert and dangerous.\n\n\"What is that you say?\" he inquired in German, his voice straining\nto a hard note. \"In trouble--has some one--\" He paused and\nflung his hand upward. \"Why don't you speak?\" he demanded.\n\n\"I never thought,\" went on Mrs. Gerhardt, frightened, and yet\nfollowing her own train of thought, \"that anything like that would\nhappen to her. She was such a good girl. Oh!\" she concluded, \"to think\nhe should ruin Jennie.\"\n\n\"By thunder!\" shouted Gerhardt, giving way to a fury of feeling, \"I\nthought so! Brander! Ha! Your fine man! That comes of letting her go\nrunning around at nights, buggy-riding, walking the streets. I thought\nso. God in heaven!--\"\n\nHe broke from his dramatic attitude and struck out in a fierce\nstride across the narrow chamber, turning like a caged animal.\n\n\"Ruined!\" he exclaimed. \"Ruined! Ha! So he has ruined her, has\nhe?\"\n\nSuddenly he stopped like an image jerked by a string. He was\ndirectly in front of Mrs. Gerhardt, who had retired to the table at\nthe side of the wall, and was standing there pale with fear.\n\n\"He is dead now!\" he shouted, as if this fact had now first\noccurred to him. \"He is dead!\"\n\nHe put both hands to his temples, as if he feared his brain would\ngive way, and stood looking at her, the mocking irony of the situation\nseeming to burn in his brain like fire.\n\n\"Dead!\" he repeated, and Mrs. Gerhardt, fearing for the reason of\nthe man, shrank still farther away, her wits taken up rather with the\ntragedy of the figure he presented than with the actual substance of\nhis woe.\n\n\"He intended to marry her,\" she pleaded nervously. \"He would have\nmarried her if he had not died.\"\n\n\"Would have!\" shouted Gerhardt, coming out of his trance at the\nsound of her voice. \"Would have! That's a fine thing to talk about\nnow. Would have! The hound! May his soul burn in hell--the dog!\nAh, God, I hope--I hope--If I were not a Christian--\" He clenched\nhis hands, the awfulness of his passion shaking him like a leaf.\n\nMrs. Gerhardt burst into tears, and her husband turned away, his\nown feelings far too intense for him to have any sympathy with her. He\nwalked to and fro, his heavy step shaking the kitchen floor. After a\ntime he came back, a new phase of the dread calamity having offered\nitself to his mind.\n\n\"When did this happen?\" he demanded\n\n\"I don't know,\" returned Mrs. Gerhardt, too terror-stricken to tell\nthe truth. \"I only found it out the other day.\"\n\n\"You lie!\" he exclaimed in his excitement. \"You were always\nshielding her. It is your fault that she is where she is. If you had\nlet me have my way there would have been no cause for our trouble\nto-night.\n\n\"A fine ending,\" he went on to himself. \"A fine ending. My boy gets\ninto jail; my daughter walks the streets and gets herself talked\nabout; the neighbors come to me with open remarks about my children;\nand now this scoundrel ruins her. By the God in heaven, I don't know\nwhat has got into my children!\n\n\"I don't know how it is,\" he went on, unconsciously commiserating\nhimself. \"I try, I try! Every night I pray that the Lord will let me\ndo right, but it is no use. I might work and work. My hands--look\nat them--are rough with work. All my life I have tried to be an\nhonest man. Now--now--\" His voice broke, and it seemed for a\nmoment as if he would give way to tears. Suddenly he turned on his\nwife, the major passion of anger possessing him.\n\n\"You are the cause of this,\" he exclaimed. \"You are the sole cause.\nIf you had done as I told you to do this would not have happened. No,\nyou wouldn't do that. She must go out! out!! out!!! She has become a\nstreet-walker, that's what she has become. She has set herself right\nto go to hell. Let her go. I wash my hands of the whole thing. This is\nenough for me.\"\n\nHe made as if to go off to his little bedroom, but he had no sooner\nreached the door than he came back.\n\n\"She shall get out!\" he said electrically. \"She shall not stay\nunder my roof! To-night! At once! I will not let her enter my door\nagain. I will show her whether she will disgrace me or not!\"\n\n\"You mustn't turn her out on the streets to-night,\" pleaded Mrs.\nGerhardt. \"She has no place to go.\"\n\n\"To-night!\" he repeated. \"This very minute! Let her find a home.\nShe did not want this one. Let her get out now. We will see how the\nworld treats her.\" He walked out of the room, inflexible resolution\nfixed upon his rugged features.\n\nAt half-past five, when Mrs. Gerhardt was tearfully going about the\nduty of getting supper, Jennie returned. Her mother started when she\nheard the door open, for now she knew the storm would burst afresh.\nHer father met her on the threshold.\n\n\"Get out of my sight!\" he said savagely. \"You shall not stay\nanother hour in my house. I don't want to see you any more. Get\nout!\"\n\nJennie stood before him, pale, trembling a little, and silent. The\nchildren she had brought home with her crowded about in frightened\namazement. Veronica and Martha, who loved her dearly, began to\ncry.\n\n\"What's the matter?\" George asked, his mouth open in wonder.\n\n\"She shall get out,\" reiterated Gerhardt. \"I don't want her under\nmy roof. If she wants to be a street-walker, let her be one, but she\nshall not stay here. Pack your things,\" he added, staring at her.\n\nJennie had no word to say, but the children cried loudly.\n\n\"Be still,\" said Gerhardt. \"Go into the kitchen.\"\n\nHe drove them all out and followed stubbornly himself.\n\nJennie went quietly to her room. She gathered up her few little\nbelongings and began, with tears, to put them into a valise her mother\nbrought her. The little girlish trinkets that she had accumulated from\ntime to time she did not take. She saw them, but thought of her\nyounger sisters, and let them stay. Martha and Veronica would have\nassisted her, but their father forbade them to go.\n\nAt six o'clock Bass came in, and seeing the nervous assembly in the\nkitchen, inquired what the trouble was.\n\nGerhardt looked at him grimly, but did not answer.\n\n\"What's the trouble?\" insisted Bass. \"What are you all sitting\naround for?\"\n\n\"He is driving Jennie away,\" whispered Mrs. Gerhardt tearfully.\n\n\"What for?\" asked Bass, opening his eyes in astonishment.\n\n\"I shall tell you what for,\" broke in Gerhardt, still speaking in\nGerman. \"Because she's a street-walker, that's what for. She goes and\ngets herself ruined by a man thirty years older than she is, a man old\nenough to be her father. Let her get out of this. She shall not stay\nhere another minute.\"\n\nBass looked about him, and the children opened their eyes. All felt\nclearly that something terrible had happened, even the little ones.\nNone but Bass understood.\n\n\"What do you want to send her out to-night for?\" he inquired. \"This\nis no time to send a girl out on the streets. Can't she stay here\nuntil morning?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Gerhardt.\n\n\"He oughtn't to do that,\" put in the mother.\n\n\"She goes now,\" said Gerhardt. \"Let that be an end of it.\"\n\n\"Where is she going to go?\" insisted Bass.\n\n\"I don't know,\" Mrs. Gerhardt interpolated weakly.\n\nBass looked around, but did nothing until Mrs. Gerhardt motioned\nhim toward the front door when her husband was not looking.\n\n\"Go in! Go in!\" was the import of her gesture.\n\nBass went in, and then Mrs. Gerhardt dared to leave her work and\nfollow. The children stayed awhile, but, one by one, even they slipped\naway, leaving Gerhardt alone. When he thought that time enough had\nelapsed he arose.\n\nIn the interval Jennie had been hastily coached by her mother.\n\nJennie should go to a private boarding-house somewhere, and send\nback her address. Bass should not accompany her, but she should wait a\nlittle way up the street, and he would follow. When her father was\naway the mother might get to see her, or Jennie could come home. All\nelse must be postponed until they could meet again.\n\nWhile the discussion was still going on, Gerhardt came in.\n\n\"Is she going?\" he asked harshly.\n\n\"Yes,\" answered Mrs. Gerhardt, with her first and only note of\ndefiance.\n\nBass said, \"What's the hurry?\" But Gerhardt frowned too mightily\nfor him to venture on any further remonstrance.\n\nJennie entered, wearing her one good dress and carrying her valise.\nThere was fear in her eyes, for she was passing through a fiery\nordeal, but she had become a woman. The strength of love was with her,\nthe support of patience and the ruling sweetness of sacrifice.\nSilently she kissed her mother, while tears fell fast. Then she\nturned, and the door closed upon her as she went forth to a new\nlife.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\n\nThe world into which Jennie was thus unduly thrust forth was that\nin which virtue has always vainly struggled since time immemorial; for\nvirtue is the wishing well and the doing well unto others. Virtue is\nthat quality of generosity which offers itself willingly for another's\nservice, and, being this, it is held by society to be nearly\nworthless. Sell yourself cheaply and you shall be used lightly and\ntrampled under foot. Hold yourself dearly, however unworthily, and you\nwill be respected. Society, in the mass, lacks woefully in the matter\nof discrimination. Its one criterion is the opinion of others. Its one\ntest that of self-preservation. Has he preserved his fortune? Has she\npreserved her purity? Only in rare instances and with rare individuals\ndoes there seem to be any guiding light from within.\n\nJennie had not sought to hold herself dear. Innate feeling in her\nmade for self-sacrifice. She could not be readily corrupted by the\nworld's selfish lessons on how to preserve oneself from the evil to\ncome.\n\nIt is in such supreme moments that growth is greatest. It comes as\nwith a vast surge, this feeling of strength and sufficiency. We may\nstill tremble, the fear of doing wretchedly may linger, but we grow.\nFlashes of inspiration come to guide the soul. In nature there is no\noutside. When we are cast from a group or a condition we have still\nthe companionship of all that is. Nature is not ungenerous. Its winds\nand stars are fellows with you. Let the soul be but gentle and\nreceptive, and this vast truth will come home--not in set\nphrases, perhaps, but as a feeling, a comfort, which, after all, is\nthe last essence of knowledge. In the universe peace is wisdom.\n\nJennie had hardly turned from the door when she was overtaken by\nBass. \"Give me your grip,\" he said; and then seeing that she was dumb\nwith unutterable feeling, he added, \"I think I know where I can get\nyou a room.\"\n\nHe led the way to the southern part of the city, where they were\nnot known, and up to the door of an old lady whose parlor clock had\nbeen recently purchased from the instalment firm by whom he was now\nemployed. She was not well off, he knew, and had a room to rent.\n\n\"Is that room of yours still vacant?\" he asked.\n\n\"Yes,\" she said, looking at Jennie.\n\n\"I wish you'd let my sister have it. We're moving away, and she\ncan't go yet.\"\n\nThe old lady expressed her willingness, and Jennie was soon\ntemporarily installed.\n\n\"Don't worry now,\" said Bass, who felt rather sorry for her.\n\"This'll blow over. Ma said I should tell you not to worry. Come up\nto-morrow when he's gone.\"\n\nJennie said she would, and, after giving her further oral\nencouragement, he arranged with the old lady about board, and took his\nleave.\n\n\"It's all right now,\" he said encouragingly as he went out. \"You'll\ncome out all right. Don't worry. I've got to go back, but I'll come\naround in the morning.\"\n\nHe went away, and the bitter stress of it blew lightly over his\nhead, for he was thinking that Jennie had made a mistake. This was\nshown by the manner in which he had asked her questions as they had\nwalked together, and that in the face of her sad and doubtful\nmood.\n\n\"What'd you want to do that for?\" and \"Didn't you ever think what\nyou were doing?\" he persisted.\n\n\"Please don't ask me to-night,\" Jennie had said, which put an end\nto the sharpest form of his queries. She had no excuse to offer and no\ncomplaint to make. If any blame attached, very likely it was hers. His\nown misfortune and the family's and her sacrifice were alike\nforgotten.\n\nLeft alone in her strange abode, Jennie gave way to her saddened\nfeelings. The shock and shame of being banished from her home overcame\nher, and she wept. Although of a naturally long-suffering and\nuncomplaining disposition, the catastrophic wind-up of all her hopes\nwas too much for her. What was this element in life that could seize\nand overwhelm one as does a great wind? Why this sudden intrusion of\ndeath to shatter all that had seemed most promising in life?\n\nAs she thought over the past, a very clear recollection of the\ndetails of her long relationship with Brander came back to her, and\nfor all her suffering she could only feel a loving affection for him.\nAfter all, he had not deliberately willed her any harm. His kindness,\nhis generosity--these things had been real. He had been\nessentially a good man, and she was sorry--more for his sake than\nfor her own that his end had been so untimely.\n\nThese cogitations, while not at all reassuring, at least served to\npass the night away, and the next morning Bass stopped on his way to\nwork to say that Mrs. Gerhardt wished her to come home that same\nevening. Gerhardt would not be present, and they could talk it over.\nShe spent the day lonesomely enough, but when night fell her spirits\nbrightened, and at a quarter of eight she set out.\n\nThere was not much of comforting news to tell her. Gerhardt was\nstill in a direfully angry and outraged mood. He had already decided\nto throw up his place on the following Saturday and go to Youngstown.\nAny place was better than Columbus after this; he could never expect\nto hold up his head here again. Its memories were odious. He would go\naway now, and if he succeeded in finding work the family should\nfollow, a decision which meant the abandoning of the little home. He\nwas not going to try to meet the mortgage on the house--he could\nnot hope to.\n\nAt the end of the week Gerhardt took his leave, Jennie returned\nhome, and for a time at least there was a restoration of the old\norder, a condition which, of course, could not endure.\n\nBass saw it. Jennie's trouble and its possible consequences weighed\nupon him disagreeably. Columbus was no place to stay. Youngstown was\nno place to go. If they should all move away to some larger city it\nwould be much better.\n\nHe pondered over the situation, and hearing that a manufacturing\nboom was on in Cleveland, he thought it might be wise to try his luck\nthere. If he succeeded, the others might follow. If Gerhardt still\nworked on in Youngstown, as he was now doing, and the family came to\nCleveland, it would save Jennie from being turned out in the\nstreets.\n\nBass waited a little while before making up his mind, but finally\nannounced his purpose.\n\n\"I believe I'll go up to Cleveland,\" he said to his mother one\nevening as she was getting supper.\n\n\"Why?\" she asked, looking up uncertainly. She was rather afraid\nthat Bass would desert her.\n\n\"I think I can get work there,\" he returned. \"We oughtn't to stay\nin this darned old town.\"\n\n\"Don't swear,\" she returned reprovingly.\n\n\"Oh, I know,\" he said, \"but it's enough to make any one swear.\nWe've never had anything but rotten luck here. I'm going to go, and\nmaybe if I get anything we can all move. We'd be better off if we'd\nget some place where people don't know us. We can't be anything\nhere.\"\n\nMrs. Gerhardt listened with a strong hope for a betterment of their\nmiserable life creeping into her heart. If Bass would only do this. If\nhe would go and get work, and come to her rescue, as a strong bright\nyoung son might, what a thing it would be! They were in the rapids of\na life which was moving toward a dreadful calamity. If only something\nwould happen.\n\n\"Do you think you could get something to do?\" she asked\ninterestedly.\n\n\"I ought to,\" he said. \"I've never looked for a place yet that I\ndidn't get it. Other fellows have gone up there and done all right.\nLook at the Millers.\"\n\nHe shoved his hands into his pockets and looked out the window.\n\n\"Do you think you could get along until I try my hand up there?\" he\nasked.\n\n\"I guess we could,\" she replied. \"Papa's at work now and we have\nsome money that, that--\" she hesitated, to name the source, so\nashamed was she of their predicament.\n\n\"Yes, I know,\" said Bass, grimly.\n\n\"We won't have to pay any rent here before fall and then we'll have\nto give it up anyhow,\" she added.\n\nShe was referring to the mortgage on the house, which fell due the\nnext September and which unquestionably could not be met. \"If we could\nmove away from here before then, I guess we could get along.\"\n\n\"I'll do it,\" said Bass determinedly. \"I'll go.\"\n\nAccordingly, he threw up his place at the end of the month, and the\nday after he left for Cleveland.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI\n\n\nThe incidents of the days that followed, relating as they did\npeculiarly to Jennie, were of an order which the morality of our day\nhas agreed to taboo.\n\nCertain processes of the all-mother, the great artificing wisdom of\nthe power that works and weaves in silence and in darkness, when\nviewed in the light of the established opinion of some of the little\nindividuals created by it, are considered very vile. We turn our faces\naway from the creation of life as if that were the last thing that man\nshould dare to interest himself in, openly.\n\nIt is curious that a feeling of this sort should spring up in a\nworld whose very essence is generative, the vast process dual, and\nwhere wind, water, soil, and light alike minister to the fruition of\nthat which is all that we are. Although the whole earth, not we alone,\nis moved by passions hymeneal, and everything terrestrial has come\ninto being by the one common road, yet there is that ridiculous\ntendency to close the eyes and turn away the head as if there were\nsomething unclean in nature itself. \"Conceived in iniquity and born in\nsin,\" is the unnatural interpretation put upon the process by the\nextreme religionist, and the world, by its silence, gives assent to a\njudgment so marvelously warped.\n\nSurely there is something radically wrong in this attitude. The\nteachings of philosophy and the deductions of biology should find more\npractical application in the daily reasoning of man. No process is\nvile, no condition is unnatural. The accidental variation from a given\nsocial practice does not necessarily entail sin. No poor little\nearthling, caught in the enormous grip of chance, and so swerved from\nthe established customs of men, could possibly be guilty of that depth\nof vileness which the attitude of the world would seem to predicate so\ninevitably.\n\nJennie was now to witness the unjust interpretation of that wonder\nof nature, which, but for Brander's death, might have been consecrated\nand hallowed as one of the ideal functions of life. Although herself\nunable to distinguish the separateness of this from every other normal\nprocess of life, yet was she made to feel, by the actions of all about\nher, that degradation was her portion and sin the foundation as well\nas the condition of her state. Almost, not quite, it was sought to\nextinguish the affection, the consideration, the care which,\nafterward, the world would demand of her, for her child. Almost, not\nquite, was the budding and essential love looked upon as evil.\nAlthough her punishment was neither the gibbet nor the jail of a few\nhundred years before, yet the ignorance and immobility of the human\nbeings about her made it impossible for them to see anything in her\npresent condition but a vile and premeditated infraction of the social\ncode, the punishment of which was ostracism. All she could do now was\nto shun the scornful gaze of men, and to bear in silence the great\nchange that was coming upon her. Strangely enough, she felt no useless\nremorse, no vain regrets. Her heart was pure, and she was conscious\nthat it was filled with peace. Sorrow there was, it is true, but only\na mellow phase of it, a vague uncertainty and wonder, which would\nsometimes cause her eyes to fill with tears.\n\nYou have heard the wood-dove calling in the lone stillness of the\nsummertime; you have found the unheeded brooklet singing and babbling\nwhere no ear comes to hear. Under dead leaves and snow-banks the\ndelicate arbutus unfolds its simple blossom, answering some heavenly\ncall for color. So, too, this other flower of womanhood.\n\nJennie was left alone, but, like the wood-dove, she was a voice of\nsweetness in the summer-time. Going about her household duties, she\nwas content to wait, without a murmur, the fulfilment of that process\nfor which, after all, she was but the sacrificial implement. When her\nduties were lightest she was content to sit in quiet meditation, the\nmarvel of life holding her as in a trance. When she was hardest\npressed to aid her mother, she would sometimes find herself quietly\nsinging, the pleasure of work lifting her out of herself. Always she\nwas content to face the future with a serene and unfaltering courage.\nIt is not so with all women. Nature is unkind in permitting the minor\ntype to bear a child at all. The larger natures in their maturity\nwelcome motherhood, see in it the immense possibilities of racial\nfulfilment, and find joy and satisfaction in being the hand-maiden of\nso immense a purpose.\n\nJennie, a child in years, was potentially a woman physically and\nmentally, but not yet come into rounded conclusions as to life and her\nplace in it. The great situation which had forced her into this\nanomalous position was from one point of view a tribute to her\nindividual capacity. It proved her courage, the largeness of her\nsympathy, her willingness to sacrifice for what she considered a\nworthy cause. That it resulted in an unexpected consequence, which\nplaced upon her a larger and more complicated burden, was due to the\nfact that her sense of self-protection had not been commensurate with\nher emotions. There were times when the prospective coming of the\nchild gave her a sense of fear and confusion, because she did not know\nbut that the child might eventually reproach her; but there was always\nthat saving sense of eternal justice in life which would not permit\nher to be utterly crushed. To her way of thinking, people were not\nintentionally cruel. Vague thoughts of sympathy and divine goodness\npermeated her soul. Life at worst or best was beautiful--had\nalways been so.\n\nThese thoughts did not come to her all at once, but through the\nmonths during which she watched and waited. It was a wonderful thing\nto be a mother, even under these untoward conditions. She felt that\nshe would love this child, would be a good mother to it if life\npermitted. That was the problem--what would life permit?\n\nThere were many things to be done--clothes to be made; certain\nprovisions of hygiene and diet to be observed. One of her fears was\nthat Gerhardt might unexpectedly return, but he did not. The old\nfamily doctor who had nursed the various members of the Gerhardt\nfamily through their multitudinous ailments--Doctor\nEllwanger--was taken into consultation, and he gave sound and\npractical advice. Despite his Lutheran upbringing, the practice of\nmedicine in a large and kindly way had led him to the conclusion that\nthere are more things in heaven and earth than are dreamed of in our\nphilosophies and in our small neighborhood relationships. \"So it is,\"\nhe observed to Mrs. Gerhardt when she confided to him nervously what\nthe trouble was. \"Well, you mustn't worry. These things happen in more\nplaces than you think. If you knew as much about life as I do, and\nabout your neighbors, you would not cry. Your girl will be all right.\nShe is very healthy. She can go away somewhere afterward, and people\nwill never know. Why should you worry about what your neighbors think.\nIt is not so uncommon as you imagine.\"\n\nMrs. Gerhardt marveled. He was such a wise man. It gave her a\nlittle courage. As for Jennie, she listened to his advice with\ninterest and without fear. She wanted things not so much for herself\nas for her child, and she was anxious to do whatever she was told. The\ndoctor was curious to know who the father was; when informed he lifted\nhis eyes. \"Indeed,\" he commented. \"That ought to be a bright\nbaby.\"\n\nThere came the final hour when the child was ushered into the\nworld. It was Doctor Ellwanger who presided, assisted by the mother,\nwho, having brought forth six herself, knew exactly what to do. There\nwas no difficulty, and at the first cry of the new-born infant there\nawakened in Jennie a tremendous yearning toward it. This was\nher child! It was weak and feeble--a little girl, and it\nneeded her care. She took it to her breast, when it had been bathed\nand swaddled, with a tremendous sense of satisfaction and joy. This\nwas her child, her little girl. She wanted to live to be able to work\nfor it, and rejoiced, even in her weakness, that she was so strong.\nDoctor Ellwanger predicted a quick recovery. He thought two weeks\nwould be the outside limit of her need to stay in bed. As a matter of\nfact, in ten days she was up and about, as vigorous and healthy as\never. She had been born with strength and with that nurturing quality\nwhich makes the ideal mother.\n\nThe great crisis had passed, and now life went on much as before.\nThe children, outside of Bass, were too young to understand fully, and\nhad been deceived by the story that Jennie was married to Senator\nBrander, who had died. They did not know that a child was coming until\nit was there. The neighbors were feared by Mrs. Gerhardt, for they\nwere ever watchful and really knew all. Jennie would never have braved\nthis local atmosphere except for the advice of Bass, who, having\nsecured a place in Cleveland some time before, had written that he\nthought when she was well enough it would be advisable for the whole\nfamily to seek a new start in Cleveland. Things were flourishing\nthere. Once away they would never hear of their present neighbors and\nJennie could find something to do. So she stayed at home.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII\n\n\nBass was no sooner in Cleveland than the marvel of that growing\ncity was sufficient to completely restore his equanimity of soul and\nto stir up new illusions as to the possibility of rehabilitation for\nhimself and his family. \"If only they could come here,\" he thought.\n\"If only they could all get work and do right.\" Here was no evidence\nof any of their recent troubles, no acquaintances who could suggest by\ntheir mere presence the troubles of the past. All was business, all\nactivity. The very turning of the corner seemed to rid one of old\ntimes and crimes. It was as if a new world existed in every block.\n\nHe soon found a place in a cigar store, and, after working a few\nweeks, he began to write home the cheering ideas he had in mind.\nJennie ought to come as soon as she was able, and then, if she found\nsomething to do, the others might follow. There was plenty of work for\ngirls of her age. She could live in the same house with him\ntemporarily; or maybe they could take one of the\nfifteen-dollar-a-month cottages that were for rent. There were big\ngeneral furnishing houses, where one could buy everything needful for\na small house on very easy monthly terms. His mother could come and\nkeep house for them. They would be in a clean, new atmosphere, unknown\nand untalked about. They could start life all over again; they could\nbe decent, honorable, prosperous.\n\nFilled with this hope and the glamor which new scenes and new\nenvironment invariably throw over the unsophisticated mind, he wrote a\nfinal letter, in which he suggested that Jennie should come at once.\nThis was when the baby was six months old. There were theaters here,\nhe said, and beautiful streets. Vessels from the lakes came into the\nheart of the city. It was a wonderful city, and growing very fast. It\nwas thus that the new life appealed to him.\n\nThe effect which all this had upon Mrs. Gerhardt, Jennie, and the\nrest of the family was phenomenal. Mrs. Gerhardt, long weighed upon by\nthe misery which Jennie's error had entailed, was for taking measures\nfor carrying out this plan at once. So buoyant was her natural\ntemperament that she was completely carried away by the glory of\nCleveland, and already saw fulfilled therein not only her own desires\nfor a nice home, but the prosperous advancement of her children. \"Of\ncourse they could get work,\" she said. Bass was right. She had always\nwanted Gerhardt to go to some large city, but he would not. Now it was\nnecessary, and they would go and become better off than they ever had\nbeen.\n\nAnd Gerhardt did take this view of the situation. In answer to his\nwife's letter he wrote that it was not advisable for him to leave his\nplace, but if Bass saw a way for them, it might be a good thing to go.\nHe was the more ready to acquiesce in the plan for the simple reason\nthat he was half distracted with the worry of supporting the family\nand of paying the debts already outstanding. Every week he laid by\nfive dollars out of his salary, which he sent in the form of a postal\norder to Mrs. Gerhardt. Three dollars he paid for board, and fifty\ncents he kept for spending money, church dues, a little tobacco and\noccasionally a glass of beer. Every week he put a dollar and a half in\na little iron bank against a rainy day. His room was a bare corner in\nthe topmost loft of the mill. To this he would ascend after sitting\nalone on the doorstep of the mill in this lonely, foresaken\nneighborhood, until nine o'clock of an evening; and here, amid the\nodor of machinery wafted up from the floor below, by the light of a\nsingle tallow candle, he would conclude his solitary day, reading his\nGerman paper, folding his hands and thinking, kneeling by an open\nwindow in the shadow of the night to say his prayers, and silently\nstretching himself to rest. Long were the days, dreary the prospect.\nStill he lifted his hands in utmost faith to God, praying that his\nsins might be forgiven and that he might be vouchsafed a few more\nyears of comfort and of happy family life.\n\nSo the momentous question was finally decided. There was the\ngreatest longing and impatience among the children, and Mrs. Gerhardt\nshared their emotions in a suppressed way. Jennie was to go first, as\nBass had suggested; later on they would all follow.\n\nWhen the hour came for Jennie's departure there was great\nexcitement in the household.\n\n\"How long you going to be 'fore you send for us?\" was Martha's\ninquiry, several times repeated.\n\n\"Tell Bass to hurry up,\" said the eager George.\n\n\"I want to go to Cleveland, I want to go to Cleveland,\" Veronica\nwas caught singing to herself.\n\n\"Listen to her,\" exclaimed George, sarcastically.\n\n\"Aw, you hush up,\" was her displeased rejoinder.\n\nWhen the final hour came, however, it required all of Jennie's\nstrength to go through with the farewells. Though everything was being\ndone in order to bring them together again under better conditions,\nshe could not help feeling depressed. Her little one, now six months\nold, was being left behind. The great world was to her one\nundiscovered bourne. It frightened her.\n\n\"You mustn't worry, Ma,\" she found courage enough to say. \"I'll be\nall right. I'll write you just as soon as I get there. It won't be so\nvery long.\"\n\nBut when it came to bending over her baby for the last time her\ncourage went out like a blown lamp. Stooping over the cradle in which\nthe little one was resting, she looked into its face with passionate,\nmotherly yearning.\n\n\"Is it going to be a good little girl?\" she cooed.\n\nThen she caught it up into her arms, and hugging it closely to her\nneck and bosom, she buried her face against its little body. Mrs.\nGerhardt saw that she was trembling.\n\n\"Come now,\" she said, coaxingly, \"you mustn't carry on so. She will\nbe all right with me. I'll take care of her. If you're going to act\nthis way, you'd better not try to go at all.\"\n\nJennie lifted her head, her blue eyes wet with tears, and handed\nthe little one to her mother.\n\n\"I can't help it,\" she said, half crying, half smiling.\n\nQuickly she kissed her mother and the children; then she hurried\nout.\n\nAs she went down the street with George she looked back and bravely\nwaved her hand. Mrs. Gerhardt responded, noticing how much more like a\nwoman she looked. It had been necessary to invest some of her money in\nnew clothes to wear on the train. She had selected a neat, ready-made\nsuit of brown, which fitted her nicely. She wore the skirt of this\nwith a white shirt-waist, and a sailor hat with a white veil wound\naround it in such fashion that it could be easily drawn over her face.\nAs she went farther and farther away Mrs. Gerhardt followed her\nlovingly with her glance; and when she disappeared from view she said\ntenderly, through her own tears:\n\n\"I'm glad she looked so nice, anyhow.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII\n\n\nBass met Jennie at the depot in Cleveland and talked hopefully of\nthe prospects. \"The first thing is to get work,\" he began, while the\njingling sounds and the changing odors which the city thrust upon her\nwere confusing and almost benumbing her senses. \"Get something to do.\nIt doesn't matter what, so long as you get something. If you don't get\nmore than three or four dollars a week, it will pay the rent. Then,\nwith what George can earn, when he comes, and what Pop sends, we can\nget along all right. It'll be better than being down in that hole,\" he\nconcluded.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Jennie, vaguely, her mind so hypnotized by the new\ndisplay of life about her that she could not bring it forcibly to bear\nupon the topic under discussion. \"I know what you mean. I'll get\nsomething.\"\n\nShe was much older now, in understanding if not in years. The\nordeal through which she had so recently passed had aroused in her a\nclearer conception of the responsibilities of life. Her mother was\nalways in her mind, her mother and the children. In particular Martha\nand Veronica must have a better opportunity to do for themselves than\nshe had had. They should be dressed better; they ought to be kept\nlonger in school; they must have more companionship, more opportunity\nto broaden their lives.\n\nCleveland, like every other growing city at this time, was crowded\nwith those who were seeking employment. New enterprises were\nconstantly springing up, but those who were seeking to fulfil the\nduties they provided were invariably in excess of the demand. A\nstranger coming to the city might walk into a small position of almost\nany kind on the very day he arrived; and he might as readily wander in\nsearch of employment for weeks and even months. Bass suggested the\nshops and department stores as a first field in which to inquire. The\nfactories and other avenues of employment were to be her second\nchoice.\n\n\"Don't pass a place, though,\" he had cautioned her, \"if you think\nthere's any chance of getting anything to do. Go right in.\"\n\n\"What must I say?\" asked Jennie, nervously.\n\n\"Tell them you want work. You don't care what you do to begin\nwith.\"\n\nIn compliance with this advice, Jennie set out the very first day,\nand was rewarded by some very chilly experiences. Wherever she went,\nno one seemed to want any help. She applied at the stores, the\nfactories, the little shops that lined the outlying thoroughfares, but\nwas always met by a rebuff. As a last resource she turned to\nhousework, although she had hoped to avoid that; and, studying the\nwant columns, she selected four which seemed more promising than the\nothers. To these she decided to apply. One had already been filled\nwhen she arrived, but the lady who came to the door was so taken by\nher appearance that she invited her in and questioned her as to her\nability.\n\n\"I wish you had come a little earlier,\" she said. \"I like you\nbetter than I do the girl I have taken. Leave me your address,\nanyhow.\"\n\nJennie went away, smiling at her reception. She was not quite so\nyouthful looking as she had been before her recent trouble, but the\nthinner cheeks and the slightly deeper eyes added to the pensiveness\nand delicacy of her countenance. She was a model of neatness. Her\nclothes, all newly cleaned and ironed before leaving home, gave her a\nfresh and inviting appearance. There was growth coming to her in the\nmatter of height, but already in appearance and intelligence she\nlooked to be a young woman of twenty. Best of all, she was of that\nnaturally sunny disposition, which, in spite of toil and privation,\nkept her always cheerful. Any one in need of a servant-girl or house\ncompanion would have been delighted to have had her.\n\nThe second place at which she applied was a large residence in\nEuclid Avenue; it seemed far too imposing for anything she might have\nto offer in the way of services, but having come so far she decided to\nmake the attempt. The servant who met her at the door directed her to\nwait a few moments, and finally ushered her into the boudoir of the\nmistress of the house on the second floor. The latter, a Mrs.\nBracebridge, a prepossessing brunette of the conventionally\nfashionable type, had a keen eye for feminine values and was impressed\nrather favorably with Jennie. She talked with her a little while, and\nfinally decided to try her in the general capacity of maid.\n\n\"I will give you four dollars a week, and you can sleep here if you\nwish,\" said Mrs. Bracebridge.\n\nJennie explained that she was living with her brother, and would\nsoon have her family with her.\n\n\"Oh, very well,\" replied her mistress. \"Do as you like about that.\nOnly I expect you to be here promptly.\"\n\nShe wished her to remain for the day and to begin her duties at\nonce, and Jennie agreed. Mrs. Bracebridge provided her a dainty cap\nand apron, and then spent some little time in instructing her in her\nduties. Her principal work would be to wait on her mistress, to brush\nher hair and to help her dress. She was also to answer the bell, wait\non the table if need be, and do any other errand which her mistress\nmight indicate. Mrs. Bracebridge seemed a little hard and formal to\nher prospective servant, but for all that Jennie admired the dash and\ngo and the obvious executive capacity of her employer.\n\nAt eight o'clock that evening Jennie was dismissed for the day. She\nwondered if she could be of any use in such a household, and marveled\nthat she had got along as well as she had. Her mistress had set her to\ncleaning her jewelry and boudoir ornaments as an opening task, and\nthough she had worked steadily and diligently, she had not finished by\nthe time she left. She hurried away to her brother's apartment,\ndelighted to be able to report that she had found a situation. Now her\nmother could come to Cleveland. Now she could have her baby with her.\nNow they could really begin that new life which was to be so much\nbetter and finer and sweeter than anything they had ever had\nbefore.\n\nAt Bass's suggestion Jennie wrote her mother to come at once, and a\nweek or so later a suitable house was found and rented. Mrs. Gerhardt,\nwith the aid of the children, packed up the simple belongings of the\nfamily, including a single vanload of furniture, and at the end of a\nfortnight they were on their way to the new home.\n\nMrs. Gerhardt always had had a keen desire for a really comfortable\nhome. Solid furniture, upholstered and trimmed, a thick, soft carpet\nof some warm, pleasing color, plenty of chairs, settees, pictures, a\nlounge, and a piano she had wanted these nice things all her life, but\nher circumstances had never been good enough for her hopes to be\nrealized. Still she did not despair. Some day, maybe, before she died\nthese things would be added to her, and she would be happy. Perhaps\nher chance was coming now.\n\nArrived at Cleveland, this feeling of optimism was encouraged by\nthe sight of Jennie's cheerful face. Bass assured her that they would\nget along all right. He took them out to the house, and George was\nshown the way to go back to the depot and have the freight looked\nafter. Mrs. Gerhardt had still fifty dollars left out of the money\nwhich Senator Brander had sent to Jennie, and with this a way of\ngetting a little extra furniture on the instalment plan was provided.\nBass had already paid the first month's rent, and Jennie had spent her\nevenings for the last few days in washing the windows and floors of\nthis new house and in getting it into a state of perfect cleanliness.\nNow, when the first night fell, they had two new mattresses and\ncomfortables spread upon a clean floor; a new lamp, purchased from one\nof the nearby stores, a single box, borrowed by Jennie from a grocery\nstore, for cleaning purposes, upon which Mrs. Gerhardt could sit, and\nsome sausages and bread to stay them until morning. They talked and\nplanned for the future until nine o'clock came, when all but Jennie\nand her mother retired. These two talked on, the burden of\nresponsibilities resting on the daughter. Mrs. Gerhardt had come to\nfeel in a way dependent upon her.\n\nIn the course of a week the entire cottage was in order, with a\nhalf-dozen pieces of new furniture, a new carpet, and some necessary\nkitchen utensils. The most disturbing thing was the need of a new\ncooking-stove, the cost of which added greatly to the bill. The\nyounger children were entered at the public school, but it was decided\nthat George must find some employment. Both Jennie and her mother felt\nthe injustice of this keenly, but knew no way of preventing the\nsacrifice.\n\n\"We will let him go to school next year if we can,\" said\nJennie.\n\nAuspiciously as the new life seemed to have begun, the closeness\nwith which their expenses were matching their income was an\never-present menace. Bass, originally very generous in his\npropositions, soon announced that he felt four dollars a week for his\nroom and board to be a sufficient contribution from himself. Jennie\ngave everything she earned, and protested that she did not stand in\nneed of anything, so long as the baby was properly taken care of.\nGeorge secured a place as an overgrown cash-boy, and brought in two\ndollars and fifty cents a week, all of which, at first, he gladly\ncontributed. Later on he was allowed the fifty cents for himself as\nbeing meet and just. Gerhardt, from his lonely post of labor,\ncontributed five dollars by mail, always arguing that a little money\nought to be saved in order that his honest debts back in Columbus\nmight be paid. Out of this total income of fifteen dollars a week all\nof these individuals had to be fed and clothed, the rent paid, coal\npurchased, and the regular monthly instalment of three dollars paid on\nthe outstanding furniture bill of fifty dollars.\n\nHow it was done, those comfortable individuals, who frequently\ndiscuss the social aspects of poverty, might well trouble to inform\nthemselves. Rent, coal, and light alone consumed the goodly sum of\ntwenty dollars a month; food, another unfortunately necessary item,\nused up twenty-five more; clothes, instalments, dues, occasional items\nof medicine and the like, were met out of the remaining eleven\ndollars--how, the ardent imagination of the comfortable reader\ncan guess. It was done, however, and for a time the hopeful members\nconsidered that they were doing fairly well.\n\nDuring this period the little family presented a picture of\nhonorable and patient toil, which was interesting to contemplate.\nEvery day Mrs. Gerhardt, who worked like a servant and who received\nabsolutely no compensation either in clothes, amusements, or anything\nelse, arose in the morning while the others slept, and built the fire.\nThen she took up the task of getting the breakfast. Often as she moved\nabout noiselessly in her thin, worn slippers, cushioned with pieces of\nnewspaper to make them fit, she looked in on Jennie, Bass, and George,\nwrapped in their heavy slumbers, and with that divine sympathy which\nis born in heaven she wished that they did not need to rise so early\nor to work so hard. Sometimes she would pause before touching her\nbeloved Jennie, gaze at her white face, so calm in sleep, and lament\nthat life had not dealt more kindly with her. Then she would lay her\nhand gently upon her shoulder and whisper, \"Jennie, Jennie,\" until the\nweary sleeper would wake.\n\nWhen they arose breakfast was always ready. When they returned at\nnight supper was waiting. Each of the children received a due share of\nMrs. Gerhardt's attention. The little baby was closely looked after by\nher. She protested that she needed neither clothes nor shoes so long\nas one of the children would run errands for her.\n\nJennie, of all the children, fully understood her mother; she alone\nstrove, with the fullness of a perfect affection, to ease her\nburden.\n\n\"Ma, you let me do this.\"\n\n\"Now, ma, I'll 'tend to that.\"\n\n\"You go sit down, ma.\"\n\nThese were the every-day expressions of the enduring affection that\nexisted between them. Always there was perfect understanding between\nJennie and her mother, and as the days passed this naturally widened\nand deepened. Jennie could not bear to think of her as being always\nconfined to the house. Daily she thought as she worked of that humble\nhome where her mother was watching and waiting. How she longed to give\nher those comforts which she had always craved!\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV\n\n\nThe days spent in the employ of the Bracebridge household were of a\nbroadening character. This great house was a school to Jennie, not\nonly in the matter of dress and manners, but as formulating a theory\nof existence. Mrs. Bracebridge and her husband were the last word in\nthe matter of self-sufficiency, taste in the matter of appointments,\ncare in the matter of dress, good form in the matter of reception,\nentertainment, and the various usages of social life. Now and then,\napropos of nothing save her own mood, Mrs. Bracebridge would indicate\nher philosophy of life in an epigram.\n\n\"Life is a battle, my dear. If you gain anything you will have to\nfight for it.\"\n\n\"In my judgment it is silly not to take advantage of any aid which\nwill help you to be what you want to be.\" (This while applying a faint\nsuggestion of rouge.)\n\n\"Most people are born silly. They are exactly what they are capable\nof being. I despise lack of taste; it is the worst crime.\"\n\nMost of these worldly-wise counsels were not given directly to\nJennie. She overheard them, but to her quiet and reflective mind they\nhad their import. Like seeds fallen upon good ground, they took root\nand grew. She began to get a faint perception of hierarchies and\npowers. They were not for her, perhaps, but they were in the world,\nand if fortune were kind one might better one's state. She worked on,\nwondering, however, just how better fortune might come to her. Who\nwould have her to wife knowing her history? How could she ever explain\nthe existence of her child?\n\nHer child, her child, the one transcendent, gripping theme of joy\nand fear. If she could only do something for it--sometime,\nsomehow!\n\nFor the first winter things went smoothly enough. By the closest\neconomy the children were clothed and kept in school, the rent paid,\nand the instalments met. Once it looked as though there might be some\ndifficulty about the continuance of the home life, and that was when\nGerhardt wrote that he would be home for Christmas. The mill was to\nclose down for a short period at that time. He was naturally anxious\nto see what the new life of his family at Cleveland was like.\n\nMrs. Gerhardt would have welcomed his return with unalloyed\npleasure had it not been for the fear she entertained of his creating\na scene. Jennie talked it over with her mother, and Mrs. Gerhardt in\nturn spoke of it to Bass, whose advice was to brave it out.\n\n\"Don't worry,\" he said; \"he won't do anything about it. I'll talk\nto him if he says anything.\"\n\nThe scene did occur, but it was not so unpleasant as Mrs. Gerhardt\nhad feared. Gerhardt came home during the afternoon, while Bass,\nJennie, and George were at work. Two of the younger children went to\nthe train to meet him. When he entered Mrs. Gerhardt greeted him\naffectionately, but she trembled for the discovery which was sure to\ncome. Her suspense was not for long. Gerhardt opened the front bedroom\ndoor only a few minutes after he arrived. On the white counterpane of\nthe bed was a pretty child, sleeping. He could not but know on the\ninstant whose it was, but he pretended ignorance.\n\n\"Whose child is that?\" he questioned.\n\n\"It's Jennie's,\" said Mrs. Gerhardt, weakly.\n\n\"When did that come here?\"\n\n\"Not so very long ago,\" answered the mother, nervously.\n\n\"I guess she is here, too,\" he declared, contemptuously, refusing\nto pronounce her name, a fact which he had already anticipated.\n\n\"She's working in a family,\" returned his wife in a pleading tone.\n\"She's doing so well now. She had no place to go. Let her alone.\"\n\nGerhardt had received a light since he had been away. Certain\ninexplicable thoughts and feelings had come to him in his religious\nmeditations. In his prayers he had admitted to the All-seeing that he\nmight have done differently by his daughter. Yet he could not make up\nhis mind how to treat her for the future. She had committed a great\nsin; it was impossible to get away from that.\n\nWhen Jennie came home that night a meeting was unavoidable.\nGerhardt saw her coming, and pretended to be deeply engaged in a\nnewspaper. Mrs. Gerhardt, who had begged him not to ignore Jennie\nentirely, trembled for fear he would say or do something which would\nhurt her feelings.\n\n\"She is coming now,\" she said, crossing to the door of the front\nroom, where he was sitting; but Gerhardt refused to look up. \"Speak to\nher, anyhow,\" was her last appeal before the door opened; but he made\nno reply.\n\nWhen Jennie came in her mother whispered, \"He is in the front\nroom.\"\n\nJennie paled, put her thumb to her lip and stood irresolute, not\nknowing how to meet the situation.\n\n\"Has he seen?\"\n\nJennie paused as she realized from her mother's face and nod that\nGerhardt knew of the child's existence.\n\n\"Go ahead,\" said Mrs. Gerhardt; \"it's all right. He won't say\nanything.\"\n\nJennie finally went to the door, and, seeing her father, his brow\nwrinkled as if in serious but not unkindly thought, she hesitated, but\nmade her way forward.\n\n\"Papa,\" she said, unable to formulate a definite sentence.\n\nGerhardt looked up, his grayish-brown eyes a study under their\nheavy sandy lashes. At the sight of his daughter he weakened\ninternally; but with the self-adjusted armor of resolve about him he\nshowed no sign of pleasure at seeing her. All the forces of his\nconventional understanding of morality and his naturally sympathetic\nand fatherly disposition were battling within him, but, as in so many\ncases where the average mind is concerned, convention was temporarily\nthe victor.\n\n\"Yes,\" he said.\n\n\"Won't you forgive me, Papa?\"\n\n\"I do,\" he returned grimly.\n\nShe hesitated a moment, and then stepped forward, for what purpose\nhe well understood.\n\n\"There,\" he said, pushing her gently away, as her lips barely\ntouched his grizzled cheek.\n\nIt had been a frigid meeting.\n\nWhen Jennie went out into the kitchen after this very trying ordeal\nshe lifted her eyes to her waiting mother and tried to make it seem as\nthough all had been well, but her emotional disposition got the better\nof her.\n\n\"Did he make up to you?\" her mother was about to ask; but the words\nwere only half out of her mouth before her daughter sank down into one\nof the chairs close to the kitchen table and, laying her head on her\narm, burst forth into soft, convulsive, inaudible sobs.\n\n\"Now, now,\" said Mrs. Gerhardt. \"There now, don't cry. What did he\nsay?\"\n\nIt was some time before Jennie recovered herself sufficiently to\nanswer. Her mother tried to treat the situation lightly.\n\n\"I wouldn't feel bad,\" she said. \"He'll get over it. It's his\nway.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV\n\n\nThe return of Gerhardt brought forward the child question in all\nits bearings. He could not help considering it from the standpoint of\na grandparent, particularly since it was a human being possessed of a\nsoul. He wondered if it had been baptized. Then he inquired.\n\n\"No, not yet,\" said his wife, who had not forgotten this duty, but\nhad been uncertain whether the little one would be welcome in the\nfaith.\n\n\"No, of course not,\" sneered Gerhardt, whose opinion of his wife's\nreligious devotion was not any too great. \"Such carelessness! Such\nirreligion! That is a fine thing.\"\n\nHe thought it over a few moments, and felt that this evil should be\ncorrected at once.\n\n\"It should be baptized,\" he said. \"Why don't she take it and have\nit baptized?\"\n\nMrs. Gerhardt reminded him that some one would have to stand\ngodfather to the child, and there was no way to have the ceremony\nperformed without confessing the fact that it was without a legitimate\nfather.\n\nGerhardt listened to this, and it quieted him for a few moments,\nbut his religion was something which he could not see put in the\nbackground by any such difficulty. How would the Lord look upon\nquibbling like this? It was not Christian, and it was his duty to\nattend to the matter. It must be taken, forthwith, to the church,\nJennie, himself, and his wife accompanying it as sponsors; or, if he\ndid not choose to condescend thus far to his daughter, he must see\nthat it was baptized when she was not present. He brooded over this\ndifficulty, and finally decided that the ceremony should take place on\none of these week-days between Christmas and New Year's, when Jennie\nwould be at her work. This proposal he broached to his wife, and,\nreceiving her approval, he made his next announcement. \"It has no\nname,\" he said.\n\nJennie and her mother had talked over this very matter, and Jennie\nhad expressed a preference for Vesta. Now her mother made bold to\nsuggest it as her own choice.\n\n\"How would Vesta do?\"\n\nGerhardt heard this with indifference. Secretly he had settled the\nquestion in his own mind. He had a name in store, left over from the\nhalcyon period of his youth, and never opportunely available in the\ncase of his own children--Wilhelmina. Of course he had no idea of\nunbending in the least toward his small granddaughter. He merely liked\nthe name, and the child ought to be grateful to get it. With a\nfar-off, gingery air he brought forward this first offering upon the\naltar of natural affection, for offering it was, after all.\n\n\"That is nice,\" he said, forgetting his indifference. \"But how\nwould Wilhelmina do?\"\n\nMrs. Gerhardt did not dare cross him when he was thus unconsciously\nweakening. Her woman's tact came to the rescue.\n\n\"We might give her both names,\" she compromised.\n\n\"It makes no difference to me,\" he replied, drawing back into the\nshell of opposition from which he had been inadvertently drawn. \"Just\nso she is baptized.\"\n\nJennie heard of this with pleasure, for she was anxious that the\nchild should have every advantage, religious or otherwise, that it was\npossible to obtain. She took great pains to starch and iron the\nclothes it was to wear on the appointed day.\n\nGerhardt sought out the minister of the nearest Lutheran church, a\nround-headed, thick-set theologian of the most formal type, to whom he\nstated his errand.\n\n\"Your grandchild?\" inquired the minister.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Gerhardt, \"her father is not here.\"\n\n\"So,\" replied the minister, looking at him curiously.\n\nGerhardt was not to be disturbed in his purpose. He explained that\nhe and his wife would bring her. The minister, realizing the probable\ndifficulty, did not question him further.\n\n\"The church cannot refuse to baptize her so long as you, as\ngrandparent, are willing to stand sponsor for her,\" he said.\n\nGerhardt came away, hurt by the shadow of disgrace in which he felt\nhimself involved, but satisfied that he had done his duty. Now he\nwould take the child and have it baptized, and when that was over his\npresent responsibility would cease.\n\nWhen it came to the hour of the baptism, however, he found that\nanother influence was working to guide him into greater interest and\nresponsibility. The stern religion with which he was enraptured, its\ninsistence upon a higher law, was there, and he heard again the\nprecepts which had helped to bind him to his own children.\n\n\"Is it your intention to educate this child in the knowledge and\nlove of the gospel?\" asked the black-gowned minister, as they stood\nbefore him in the silent little church whither they had brought the\ninfant; he was reading from the form provided for such occasions.\nGerhardt answered \"Yes,\" and Mrs. Gerhardt added her affirmative.\n\n\"Do you engage to use all necessary care and diligence, by\nprayerful instruction, admonition, example, and discipline that this\nchild may renounce and avoid everything that is evil and that she may\nkeep God's will and commandments as declared in His sacred word?\"\n\nA thought flashed through Gerhardt's mind as the words were uttered\nof how it had fared with his own children. They, too, had been thus\nsponsored. They too, had heard his solemn pledge to care for their\nspiritual welfare. He was silent.\n\n\"We do,\" prompted the minister.\n\n\"We do,\" repeated Gerhardt and his wife weakly.\n\n\"Do you now dedicate this child by the rite of baptism unto the\nLord, who brought it?\"\n\n\"We do.\"\n\n\"And, finally, if you can conscientiously declare before God that\nthe faith to which you have assented is your faith, and that the\nsolemn promises you have made are the serious resolutions of your\nheart, please to announce the same in the presence of God, by saying\n'Yes.'\"\n\n\"Yes,\" they replied.\n\n\"I baptize thee, Wilhelmina Vesta,\" concluded the minister,\nstretching out his hand over her, \"in the name of the Father and of\nthe Son and of the Holy Ghost. Let us pray.\"\n\nGerhardt bent his gray head and followed with humble reverence the\nbeautiful invocation which followed:\n\n\"Almighty and everlasting God! we adore Thee as the great Parent of\nthe children of men, as the Father of our spirits and the Former of\nour bodies. We praise Thee for giving existence to this infant and for\npreserving her until this day. We bless Thee that she is called to\nvirtue and glory, that she has now been dedicated to Thee, and brought\nwithin-the pale of the Christian Church. We thank Thee that by the\nGospel of the Son she is furnished with everything necessary to her\nspiritual happiness; that it supplies light for her mind and comfort\nfor her heart, encouragement and power to discharge her duty, and the\nprecious hope of mercy and immortality to sustain and make her\nfaithful. And we beseech Thee, O most merciful God, that this child\nmay be enlightened and sanctified from her early years by the Holy\nSpirit, and be everlastingly saved by Thy mercy. Direct and bless Thy\nservants who are intrusted with the care of her in the momentous work\nof her education. Inspire them with just conception of the absolute\nnecessity of religious instruction and principles. Forbid that they\nshould ever forget that this offspring belongs to Thee, and that, if\nthrough their criminal neglect or bad example Thy reasonable creature\nbe lost, Thou wilt require it at their hands. Give them a deep sense\nof the divinity of her nature, of the worth of her soul, of the\ndangers to which she will be exposed, of the honor and felicity to\nwhich she is capable of ascending with Thy blessing, and of the ruin\nin this world and the misery in the world to come which springs from\nwicked passion and conduct. Give them grace to check the first risings\nof forbidden inclinations in her breast, to be her defense against the\ntemptations incident to childhood and youth, and, as she grows up, to\nenlarge her understanding and to lead her to an acquaintance with Thee\nand with Jesus Christ, whom Thou hast sent. Give them grace to\ncultivate in her heart a supreme reverence and love for Thee, a\ngrateful attachment to the Gospel of Thy Son, her Saviour, a due\nregard for all its ordinances and institutions, a temper of kindness\nand goodwill to all mankind, and an invincible love of sincerity and\ntruth. Help them to watch continually over her with tender solicitude,\nto be studious, that by their conversation and deportment her heart\nmay not be corrupted, and at all times to set before her such an\nexample that she may safely tread in their footsteps. If it please\nThee to prolong her days on earth, grant that she may prove an honor\nand a comfort to her parents and friends, be useful in the world, and\nfind in Thy Providence an unfailing defense and support. Whether she\nlive, let her live to Thee; or whether she die, let her die to Thee.\nAnd, at the great day of account, may she and her parents meet each\nother with rapture and rejoice together in Thy redeeming love, through\nJesus Christ, forever and ever, Amen.\"\n\nAs this solemn admonition was read a feeling of obligation\ndescended upon the grandfather of this little outcast; a feeling that\nhe was bound to give the tiny creature lying on his wife's arm the\ncare and attention which God in His sacrament had commanded. He bowed\nhis head in utmost reverence, and when the service was concluded and\nthey left the silent church he was without words to express his\nfeelings. Religion was a consuming thing with him. God was a person, a\ndominant reality. Religion was not a thing of mere words or of\ninteresting ideas to be listened to on Sunday, but a strong, vital\nexpression of the Divine Will handed down from a time when men were in\npersonal contact with God. Its fulfilment was a matter of joy and\nsalvation with him, the one consolation of a creature sent to wander\nin a vale whose explanation was not here but in heaven. Slowly\nGerhardt walked on, and as he brooded on the words and the duties\nwhich the sacrament involved the shade of lingering disgust that had\npossessed him when he had taken the child to church disappeared and a\nfeeling of natural affection took its place. However much the daughter\nhad sinned, the infant was not to blame. It was a helpless, puling,\ntender thing, demanding his sympathy and his love. Gerhardt felt his\nheart go out to the little child, and yet he could not yield his\nposition all in a moment.\n\n\"That is a nice man,\" he said of the minister to his wife as they\nwalked along, rapidly softening in his conception of his duty.\n\n\"Yes, he was,\" agreed Mrs. Gerhardt timidly.\n\n\"It's a good-sized little church,\" he continued.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nGerhardt looked around him, at the street, the houses, the show of\nbrisk life on this sunshiny, winter's day, and then finally at the\nchild that his wife was carrying.\n\n\"She must be heavy,\" he said, in his characteristic German. \"Let me\ntake her.\"\n\nMrs. Gerhardt, who was rather weary, did not refuse.\n\n\"There!\" he said, as he looked at her and then fixed her\ncomfortably upon his shoulder. \"Let us hope she proves worthy of all\nthat has been done to-day.\"\n\nMrs. Gerhardt listened, and the meaning in his voice interpreted\nitself plainly enough. The presence of the child in the house might be\nthe cause of recurring spells of depression and unkind words, but\nthere would be another and greater influence restraining him. There\nwould always be her soul to consider. He would never again be utterly\nunconscious of her soul.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI\n\n\nDuring the remainder of Gerhardt's stay he was shy in Jennie's\npresence and endeavored to act as though he were unconscious of her\nexistence. When the time came for parting he even went away without\nbidding her good-by, telling his wife she might do that for him; but\nafter he was actually on his way back to Youngstown he regretted the\nomission. \"I might have bade her good-by,\" he thought to himself as\nthe train rumbled heavily along. But it was too late.\n\nFor the time being the affairs of the Gerhardt family drifted.\nJennie continued her work with Mrs. Bracebridge. Sebastian fixed\nhimself firmly in his clerkship in the cigar store. George was\npromoted to the noble sum of three dollars, and then three-fifty. It\nwas a narrow, humdrum life the family led. Coal, groceries, shoes, and\nclothing were the uppermost topics of their conversation; every one\nfelt the stress and strain of trying to make ends meet.\n\nThat which worried Jennie most, and there were many things which\nweighed upon her sensitive soul, was the outcome of her own\nlife--not so much for herself as for her baby and the family. She\ncould not really see where she fitted in. \"Who would have me?\" she\nasked herself over and over. \"How was she to dispose of Vesta in the\nevent of a new love affair?\" Such a contingency was quite possible.\nShe was young, good-looking, and men were inclined to flirt with her,\nor rather to attempt it. The Bracebridges entertained many masculine\nguests, and some of them had made unpleasant overtures to her.\n\n\"My dear, you're a very pretty girl,\" said one old rake of\nfifty-odd when she knocked at his door one morning to give him a\nmessage from his hostess.\n\n\"I beg your pardon,\" she said, confusedly, and colored.\n\n\"Indeed, you're quite sweet. And you needn't beg my pardon. I'd\nlike to talk to you some time.\"\n\nHe attempted to chuck her under the chin, but Jennie hurried away.\nShe would have reported the matter to her mistress but a nervous shame\ndeterred her. \"Why would men always be doing this?\" she thought. Could\nit be because there was something innately bad about her, an inward\ncorruption that attracted its like?\n\nIt is a curious characteristic of the non-defensive disposition\nthat it is like a honey-jar to flies. Nothing is brought to it and\nmuch is taken away. Around a soft, yielding, unselfish disposition men\nswarm naturally. They sense this generosity, this non-protective\nattitude from afar. A girl like Jennie is like a comfortable fire to\nthe average masculine mind; they gravitate to it, seek its sympathy,\nyearn to possess it. Hence she was annoyed by many unwelcome\nattentions.\n\nOne day there arrived from Cincinnati a certain Lester Kane, the\nson of a wholesale carriage builder of great trade distinction in that\ncity and elsewhere throughout the country, who was wont to visit this\nhouse frequently in a social way. He was a friend of Mrs. Bracebridge\nmore than of her husband, for the former had been raised in Cincinnati\nand as a girl had visited at his father's house. She knew his mother,\nhis brother and sisters and to all intents and purposes socially had\nalways been considered one of the family.\n\n\"Lester's coming to-morrow, Henry,\" Jennie heard Mrs. Bracebridge\ntell her husband. \"I had a wire from him this noon. He's such a scamp.\nI'm going to give him the big east front room up-stairs. Be sociable\nand pay him some attention. His father was so good to me.\"\n\n\"I know it,\" said her husband calmly. \"I like Lester. He's the\nbiggest one in that family. But he's too indifferent. He doesn't care\nenough.\"\n\n\"I know; but he's so nice. I do think he's one of the nicest men I\never knew.\"\n\n\"I'll be decent to him. Don't I always do pretty well by your\npeople?\"\n\n\"Yes, pretty well.\"\n\n\"Oh, I don't know about that,\" he replied, dryly.\n\nWhen this notable person arrived Jennie was prepared to see some\none of more than ordinary importance, and she was not disappointed.\nThere came into the reception-hall to greet her mistress a man of\nperhaps thirty-six years of age, above the medium in height,\nclear-eyed, firm-jawed, athletic, direct, and vigorous. He had a deep,\nresonant voice that carried clearly everywhere; people somehow used to\nstop and listen whether they knew him or not. He was simple and abrupt\nin his speech.\n\n\"Oh, there you are,\" he began. \"I'm glad to see you again. How's\nMr. Bracebridge? How's Fannie?\"\n\nHe asked his questions forcefully, whole-heartedly, and his hostess\nanswered with an equal warmth. \"I'm glad to see you, Lester,\" she\nsaid. \"George will take your things up-stairs. Come up into my room.\nIt's more comfy. How are grandpa and Louise?\"\n\nHe followed her up the stairs, and Jennie, who had been standing at\nthe head of the stairs listening, felt the magnetic charm of his\npersonality. It seemed, why she could hardly say, that a real\npersonage had arrived. The house was cheerier. The attitude of her\nmistress was much more complaisant. Everybody seemed to feel that\nsomething must be done for this man.\n\nJennie went about her work, but the impression persisted; his name\nran in her mind. Lester Kane. And he was from Cincinnati. She looked\nat him now and then on the sly, and felt, for the first time in her\nlife, an interest in a man on his own account. He was so big, so\nhandsome, so forceful. She wondered what his business was. At the same\ntime she felt a little dread of him. Once she caught him looking at\nher with a steady, incisive stare. She quailed inwardly, and took the\nfirst opportunity to get out of his presence. Another time he tried to\naddress a few remarks to her, but she pretended that her duties called\nher away. She knew that often his eyes were on her when her back was\nturned, and it made her nervous. She wanted to run away from him,\nalthough there was no very definite reason why she should do so.\n\nAs a matter of fact, this man, so superior to Jennie in wealth,\neducation, and social position, felt an instinctive interest in her\nunusual personality. Like the others, he was attracted by the peculiar\nsoftness of her disposition and her pre-eminent femininity. There was\nthat about her which suggested the luxury of love. He felt as if\nsomehow she could be reached why, he could not have said. She did not\nbear any outward marks of her previous experience. There were no\nevidences of coquetry about her, but still he \"felt that he might.\" He\nwas inclined to make the venture on his first visit, but business\ncalled him away; he left after four days and was absent from Cleveland\nfor three weeks. Jennie thought he was gone for good, and she\nexperienced a queer sense of relief as well as of regret. Then,\nsuddenly, he returned. He came apparently unexpectedly, explaining to\nMrs. Bracebridge that business interests again demanded his presence\nin Cleveland. As he spoke he looked at Jennie sharply, and she felt as\nif somehow his presence might also concern her a little.\n\nOn this second visit she had various opportunities of seeing him,\nat breakfast, where she sometimes served, at dinner, when she could\nsee the guests at the table from the parlor or sitting-room, and at\nodd times when he came to Mrs. Bracebridge's boudoir to talk things\nover. They were very friendly.\n\n\"Why don't you settle down, Lester, and get married?\" Jennie heard\nher say to him the second day he was there. \"You know it's time.\"\n\n\"I know,\" he replied, \"but I'm in no mood for that. I want to\nbrowse around a little while yet.\"\n\n\"Yes, I know about your browsing. You ought to be ashamed of\nyourself. Your father is really worried.\"\n\nHe chuckled amusedly. \"Father doesn't worry much about me. He has\ngot all he can attend to to look after the business.\"\n\nJennie looked at him curiously. She scarcely understood what she\nwas thinking, but this man drew her. If she had realized in what way\nshe would have fled his presence then and there.\n\nNow he was more insistent in his observation of her--addressed\nan occasional remark to her--engaged her in brief, magnetic\nconversations. She could not help answering him--he was pleasing\nto her. Once he came across her in the hall on the second floor\nsearching in a locker for some linen. They were all alone, Mrs.\nBracebridge having gone out to do some morning shopping and the other\nservants being below stairs. On this occasion he made short work of\nthe business. He approached her in a commanding, unhesitating, and\nthoroughly determined way.\n\n\"I want to talk to you,\" he said. \"Where do you live?\"\n\n\"I--I--\" she stammered, and blanched perceptibly. \"I live\nout on Lorrie Street.\"\n\n\"What number?\" he questioned, as though she were compelled to tell\nhim.\n\nShe quailed and shook inwardly. \"Thirteen fourteen,\" she replied\nmechanically.\n\nHe looked into her big, soft-blue eyes with his dark, vigorous\nbrown ones. A flash that was hypnotic, significant, insistent passed\nbetween them.\n\n\"You belong to me,\" he said. \"I've been looking for you. When can I\nsee you?\"\n\n\"Oh, you mustn't,\" she said, her fingers going nervously to her\nlips. \"I can't see you--I--I--\"\n\n\"Oh, I mustn't, mustn't I? Look here\"--he took her arm and\ndrew her slightly closer--\"you and I might as well understand\neach other right now. I like you. Do you like me? Say?\"\n\nShe looked at him, her eyes wide, filled with wonder, with fear,\nwith a growing terror.\n\n\"I don't know,\" she gasped, her lips dry.\n\n\"Do you?\" He fixed her grimly, firmly with his eyes.\n\n\"I don't know.\"\n\n\"Look at me,\" he said.\n\n\"Yes,\" she replied.\n\nHe pulled her to him quickly. \"I'll talk to you later,\" he said,\nand put his lips masterfully to hers.\n\nShe was horrified, stunned, like a bird in the grasp of a cat; but\nthrough it all something tremendously vital and insistent was speaking\nto her. He released her with a short laugh. \"We won't do any more of\nthis here, but, remember, you belong to me,\" he said, as he turned and\nwalked nonchalantly down the hall. Jennie, in sheer panic, ran to her\nmistress's room and locked the door behind her.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII\n\n\nThe shock of this sudden encounter was so great to Jennie that she\nwas hours in recovering herself. At first she did not understand\nclearly just what had happened. Out of clear sky, as it were, this\nastonishing thing had taken place. She had yielded herself to another\nman. Why? Why? she asked herself, and yet within her own consciousness\nthere was an answer. Though she could not explain her own emotions,\nshe belonged to him temperamentally and he belonged to her.\n\nThere is a fate in love and a fate in fight. This strong,\nintellectual bear of a man, son of a wealthy manufacturer, stationed,\nso far as material conditions were concerned, in a world immensely\nsuperior to that in which Jennie moved, was, nevertheless,\ninstinctively, magnetically, and chemically drawn to this poor\nserving-maid. She was his natural affinity, though he did not know\nit--the one woman who answered somehow the biggest need of his\nnature. Lester Kane had known all sorts of women, rich and poor, the\nhighly bred maidens of his own class, the daughters of the\nproletariat, but he had never yet found one who seemed to combine for\nhim the traits of an ideal woman--sympathy, kindliness of\njudgment, youth, and beauty. Yet this ideal remained fixedly seated in\nthe back of his brain--when the right woman appeared he intended\nto take her. He had the notion that, for purposes of marriage, he\nought perhaps to find this woman on his own plane. For purposes of\ntemporary happiness he might take her from anywhere, leaving marriage,\nof course, out of the question. He had no idea of making anything like\na serious proposal to a servant-girl. But Jennie was different. He had\nnever seen a servant quite like her. And she was lady-like and lovely\nwithout appearing to know it. Why, this girl was a rare flower. Why\nshouldn't he try to seize her? Let us be just to Lester Kane; let us\ntry to understand him and his position. Not every mind is to be\nestimated by the weight of a single folly; not every personality is to\nbe judged by the drag of a single passion. We live in an age in which\nthe impact of materialized forces is well-nigh irresistible; the\nspiritual nature is overwhelmed by the shock. The tremendous and\ncomplicated development of our material civilization, the\nmultiplicity, and variety of our social forms, the depth, subtlety,\nand sophistry of our imaginative impressions, gathered, remultiplied,\nand disseminated by such agencies as the railroad, the express and the\npost-office, the telephone, the telegraph, the newspaper, and, in\nshort, the whole machinery of social intercourse--these elements\nof existence combine to produce what may be termed a kaleidoscopic\nglitter, a dazzling and confusing phantasmagoria of life that wearies\nand stultifies the mental and moral nature. It induces a sort of\nintellectual fatigue through which we see the ranks of the victims of\ninsomnia, melancholia, and insanity constantly recruited. Our modern\nbrain-pan does not seem capable as yet of receiving, sorting, and\nstoring the vast army of facts and impressions which present\nthemselves daily. The white light of publicity is too white. We are\nweighed upon by too many things. It is as if the wisdom of the\ninfinite were struggling to beat itself into finite and cup-big\nminds.\n\nLester Kane was the natural product of these untoward conditions.\nHis was a naturally observing mind, Rabelaisian in its strength and\ntendencies, but confused by the multiplicity of things, the vastness\nof the panorama of life, the glitter of its details, the unsubstantial\nnature of its forms, the uncertainty of their justification. Born a\nCatholic, he was no longer a believer in the divine inspiration of\nCatholicism; raised a member of the social elect, he had ceased to\naccept the fetish that birth and station presuppose any innate\nsuperiority; brought up as the heir to a comfortable fortune and\nexpected to marry in his own sphere, he was by no means sure that he\nwanted marriage on any terms. Of course the conjugal state was an\ninstitution. It was established. Yes, certainly. But what of it? The\nwhole nation believed in it. True, but other nations believed in\npolygamy. There were other questions that bothered him--such\nquestions as the belief in a single deity or ruler of the universe,\nand whether a republican, monarchial, or aristocratic form of\ngovernment were best. In short, the whole body of things material,\nsocial, and spiritual had come under the knife of his mental surgery\nand been left but half dissected. Life was not proved to him. Not a\nsingle idea of his, unless it were the need of being honest, was\nfinally settled. In all other things he wavered, questioned,\nprocrastinated, leaving to time and to the powers back of the universe\nthe solution of the problems that vexed him. Yes, Lester Kane was the\nnatural product of a combination of elements--religious,\ncommercial, social--modified by that pervading atmosphere of\nliberty in our national life which is productive of almost uncounted\nfreedom of thought and action. Thirty-six years of age, and apparently\na man of vigorous, aggressive, and sound personality, he was,\nnevertheless, an essentially animal-man, pleasantly veneered by\neducation and environment. Like the hundreds of thousands of Irishmen\nwho in his father's day had worked on the railroad tracks, dug in the\nmines, picked and shoveled in the ditches, and carried up bricks and\nmortar on the endless structures of a new land, he was strong, hairy,\naxiomatic, and witty.\n\n\"Do you want me to come back here next year?\" he had asked of\nBrother Ambrose, when, in his seventeenth year, that ecclesiastical\nmember was about to chastise him for some school-boy misdemeanor.\n\nThe other stared at him in astonishment. \"Your father will have to\nlook after that,\" he replied.\n\n\"Well, my father won't look after it,\" Lester returned. \"If you\ntouch me with that whip I'll take things into my own hands. I'm not\ncommitting any punishable offenses, and I'm not going to be knocked\naround any more.\"\n\nWords, unfortunately, did not avail in this case, but a good,\nvigorous Irish-American wrestle did, in which the whip was broken and\nthe discipline of the school so far impaired that he was compelled to\ntake his clothes and leave. After that he looked his father in the eye\nand told him that he was not going to school any more.\n\n\"I'm perfectly willing to jump in and work,\" he explained. \"There's\nnothing in a classical education for me. Let me go into the office,\nand I guess I'll pick up enough to carry me through.\"\n\nOld Archibald Kane, keen, single-minded, of unsullied commercial\nhonor, admired his son's determination, and did not attempt to coerce\nhim.\n\n\"Come down to the office,\" he said; \"perhaps there is something you\ncan do.\"\n\nEntering upon a business life at the age of eighteen, Lester had\nworked faithfully, rising in his father's estimation, until now he had\ncome to be, in a way, his personal representative. Whenever there was\na contract to be entered upon, an important move to be decided, or a\nrepresentative of the manufactory to be sent anywhere to consummate a\ndeal, Lester was the agent selected. His father trusted him\nimplicitly, and so diplomatic and earnest was he in the fulfilment of\nhis duties that this trust had never been impaired.\n\n\"Business is business,\" was a favorite axiom with him and the very\ntone in which he pronounced the words was a reflex of his character\nand personality.\n\nThere were molten forces in him, flames which burst forth now and\nthen in spite of the fact that he was sure that he had them under\ncontrol. One of these impulses was a taste for liquor, of which he was\nperfectly sure he had the upper hand. He drank but very little, he\nthought, and only, in a social way, among friends; never to excess.\nAnother weakness lay in his sensual nature; but here again he believed\nthat he was the master. If he chose to have irregular relations with\nwomen, he was capable of deciding where the danger point lay. If men\nwere only guided by a sense of the brevity inherent in all such\nrelationships there would not be so many troublesome consequences\ngrowing out of them. Finally, he flattered himself that he had a grasp\nupon a right method of living, a method which was nothing more than a\nquiet acceptance of social conditions as they were, tempered by a\nlittle personal judgment as to the right and wrong of individual\nconduct. Not to fuss and fume, not to cry out about anything, not to\nbe mawkishly sentimental; to be vigorous and sustain your personality\nintact--such was his theory of life, and he was satisfied that it\nwas a good one.\n\nAs to Jennie, his original object in approaching her had been\npurely selfish. But now that he had asserted his masculine\nprerogatives, and she had yielded, at least in part, he began to\nrealize that she was no common girl, no toy of the passing hour.\n\nThere is a time in some men's lives when they unconsciously begin\nto view feminine youth and beauty not so much in relation to the ideal\nof happiness, but rather with regard to the social conventions by\nwhich they are environed.\n\n\"Must it be?\" they ask themselves, in speculating concerning the\npossibility of taking a maiden to wife, \"that I shall be compelled to\nswallow the whole social code, make a covenant with society, sign a\npledge of abstinence, and give to another a life interest in all my\naffairs, when I know too well that I am but taking to my arms a\nvariable creature like myself, whose wishes are apt to become\ninsistent and burdensome in proportion to the decrease of her beauty\nand interest?\" These are the men, who, unwilling to risk the manifold\ncontingencies of an authorized connection, are led to consider the\nadvantages of a less-binding union, a temporary companionship. They\nseek to seize the happiness of life without paying the cost of their\nindulgence. Later on, they think, the more definite and conventional\nrelationship may be established without reproach or the necessity of\nradical readjustment.\n\nLester Kane was past the youthful love period, and he knew it. The\ninnocence and unsophistication of younger ideals had gone. He wanted\nthe comfort of feminine companionship, but he was more and more\ndisinclined to give up his personal liberty in order to obtain it. He\nwould not wear the social shackles if it were possible to satisfy the\nneeds of his heart and nature and still remain free and unfettered. Of\ncourse he must find the right woman, and in Jennie he believed that he\nhad discovered her. She appealed to him on every side; he had never\nknown anybody quite like her. Marriage was not only impossible but\nunnecessary. He had only to say \"Come\" and she must obey; it was her\ndestiny.\n\nLester thought the matter over calmly, dispassionately. He strolled\nout to the shabby street where she lived; he looked at the humble roof\nthat sheltered her. Her poverty, her narrow and straitened environment\ntouched his heart. Ought he not to treat her generously, fairly,\nhonorably? Then the remembrance of her marvelous beauty swept over him\nand changed his mood. No, he must possess her if he\ncould--to-day, quickly, as soon as possible. It was in that frame\nof mind that he returned to Mrs. Bracebridge's home from his visit to\nLorrie Street.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII\n\n\nJennie was now going through the agony of one who has a varied and\ncomplicated problem to confront. Her baby, her father, her brothers,\nand sisters all rose up to confront her. What was this thing that she\nwas doing? Was she allowing herself to slip into another wretched,\nunsanctified relationship? How was she to explain to her family about\nthis man? He would not marry her, that was sure, if he knew all about\nher. He would not marry her, anyhow, a man of his station and\nposition. Yet here she was parleying with him. What ought she to do?\nShe pondered over the problem until evening, deciding first that it\nwas best to run away, but remembering painfully that she had told him\nwhere she lived. Then she resolved that she would summon up her\ncourage and refuse him--tell him she couldn't, wouldn't have\nanything to do with him. This last solution of the difficulty seemed\nsimple enough--in his absence. And she would find work where he\ncould not follow her up so easily. It all seemed simple enough as she\nput on her things in the evening to go home.\n\nHer aggressive lover, however, was not without his own conclusion\nin this matter. Since leaving Jennie he had thought concisely and to\nthe point. He came to the decision that he must act at once. She might\ntell her family, she might tell Mrs. Bracebridge, she might leave the\ncity. He wanted to know more of the conditions which surrounded her,\nand there was only one way to do that--talk to her. He must\npersuade her to come and live with him. She would, he thought. She\nadmitted that she liked him. That soft, yielding note in her character\nwhich had originally attracted him seemed to presage that he could win\nher without much difficulty, if he wished to try. He decided to do so,\nanyhow, for truly he desired her greatly.\n\nAt half-past five he returned to the Bracebridge home to see if she\nwere still there. At six he had an opportunity to say to her,\nunobserved, \"I am going to walk home with you. Wait for me at the next\ncorner, will you?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" she said, a sense of compulsion to do his bidding seizing\nher. She explained to herself afterward that she ought to talk to him,\nthat she must tell him finally of her decision not to see him again,\nand this was as good an opportunity as any. At half-past six he left\nthe house on a pretext--a forgotten engagement--and a little\nafter seven he was waiting for her in a closed carriage near the\nappointed spot. He was calm, absolutely satisfied as to the result,\nand curiously elated beneath a sturdy, shock-proof exterior. It was as\nif he breathed some fragrant perfume, soft, grateful, entrancing.\n\nA few minutes after eight he saw Jennie coming along. The flare of\nthe gas-lamp was not strong, but it gave sufficient light for his eyes\nto make her out. A wave of sympathy passed over him, for there was a\ngreat appeal in her personality. He stepped out as she neared the\ncorner and confronted her. \"Come,\" he said, \"and get in this carriage\nwith me. I'll take you home.\"\n\n\"No,\" she replied. \"I don't think I ought to.\"\n\n\"Come with me. I'll take you home. It's a better way to talk.\"\n\nOnce more that sense of dominance on his part, that power of\ncompulsion. She yielded, feeling all the time that she should not; he\ncalled out to the cabman, \"Anywhere for a little while.\" When she was\nseated beside him he began at once.\n\n\"Listen to me, Jennie, I want you. Tell me something about\nyourself.\"\n\n\"I have to talk to you,\" she replied, trying to stick to her\noriginal line of defense.\n\n\"About what?\" he inquired, seeking to fathom her expression in the\nhalf light.\n\n\"I can't go on this way,\" she murmured nervously. \"I can't act this\nway. You don't know how it all is. I shouldn't have done what I did\nthis morning. I mustn't see you any more. Really I mustn't.\"\n\n\"You didn't do what you did this morning,\" he remarked,\nparadoxically, seizing on that one particular expression. \"I did that.\nAnd as for seeing me any more, I'm going to see you.\" He seized her\nhand. \"You don't know me, but I like you. I'm crazy about you, that's\nall. You belong to me. Now listen. I'm going to have you. Are you\ngoing to come to me?\"\n\n\"No, no, no!\" she replied in an agonized voice, \"I can't do\nanything like that, Mr. Kane. Please listen to me. It can't be. You\ndon't know. Oh, you don't know. I can't do what you want. I don't want\nto. I couldn't, even if I wanted to. You don't know how things are.\nBut I don't want to do anything wrong. I mustn't. I can't. I won't.\nOh, no! no!! no!!! Please let me go home.\"\n\nHe listened to this troubled, feverish outburst with sympathy, with\neven a little pity.\n\n\"What do you mean by you can't?\" he asked, curiously.\n\n\"Oh, I can't tell you,\" she replied. \"Please don't ask me. You\noughtn't to know. But I mustn't see you any more. It won't do any\ngood.\"\n\n\"But you like me,\" he retorted.\n\n\"Oh yes, yes, I do. I can't help that. But you mustn't come near me\nany more. Please don't.\"\n\nHe turned his proposition over in his mind with the solemnity of a\njudge. He knew that this girl liked him--loved him really, brief\nas their contact had been. And he was drawn to her, perhaps not\nirrevocably, but with exceeding strength. What prevented her from\nyielding, especially since she wanted to? He was curious.\n\n\"See here, Jennie,\" he replied. \"I hear what you say. I don't know\nwhat you mean by 'can't' if you want to. You say you like me. Why\ncan't you come to me? You're my sort. We will get along beautifully\ntogether. You're suited to me temperamentally. I'd like to have you\nwith me. What makes you say you can't come?\"\n\n\"I can't,\" she replied. \"I can't. I don't want to. I oughtn't. Oh,\nplease don't ask me any more. You don't know. I can't tell you why.\"\nShe was thinking of her baby.\n\nThe man had a keen sense of justice and fair play. Above all things\nhe wanted to be decent in his treatment of people. In this case he\nintended to be tender and considerate, and yet he must win her. He\nturned this over in his mind.\n\n\"Listen to me,\" he said finally, still holding her hand. \"I may not\nwant you to do anything immediately. I want you to think it over. But\nyou belong to me. You say you care for me. You admitted that this\nmorning. I know you do. Now why should you stand out against me? I\nlike you, and I can do a lot of things for you. Why not let us be good\nfriends now? Then we can talk the rest of this over later.\"\n\n\"But I mustn't do anything wrong,\" she insisted. \"I don't want to.\nPlease don't come near me any more. I can't do what you want.\"\n\n\"Now, look here,\" he said. \"You don't mean that. Why did you say\nyou liked me? Have you changed your mind? Look at me.\" (She had\nlowered her eyes.) \"Look at me! You haven't, have you?\"\n\n\"Oh no, no, no,\" she half sobbed, swept by some force beyond her\ncontrol.\n\n\"Well, then, why stand out against me? I love you, I tell\nyou--I'm crazy about you. That's why I came back this time. It\nwas to see you!\"\n\n\"Was it?\" asked Jennie, surprised.\n\n\"Yes, it was. And I would have come again and again if necessary. I\ntell you I'm crazy about you. I've got to have you. Now tell me you'll\ncome with me.\"\n\n\"No, no, no,\" she pleaded. \"I can't. I must work. I want to work. I\ndon't want to do anything wrong. Please don't ask me. You mustn't. You\nmust let me go. Really you must. I can't do what you want.\"\n\n\"Tell me, Jennie,\" he said, changing the subject. \"What does your\nfather do?\"\n\n\"He's a glass-blower.\"\n\n\"Here in Cleveland?\"\n\n\"No, he works in Youngstown.\"\n\n\"Is your mother alive?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"You live with her?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\nHe smiled at the \"sir.\" \"Don't say 'sir' to me, sweet!\" he pleaded\nin his gruff way. \"And don't insist on the Mr. Kane. I'm not 'mister'\nto you any more. You belong to me, little girl, me.\" And he pulled her\nclose to him.\n\n\"Please don't, Mr. Kane,\" she pleaded. \"Oh, please don't. I can't!\nI can't! You mustn't.\"\n\nBut he sealed her lips with his own.\n\n\"Listen to me, Jennie,\" he repeated, using his favorite expression.\n\"I tell you you belong to me. I like you better every moment. I\nhaven't had a chance to know you. I'm not going to give you up. You've\ngot to come to me eventually. And I'm not going to have you working as\na lady's maid. You can't stay in that place except for a little while.\nI'm going to take you somewhere else. And I'm going to leave you some\nmoney, do you hear? You have to take it.\"\n\nAt the word money she quailed and withdrew her hand.\n\n\"No, no, no!\" she repeated. \"No, I won't take it.\"\n\n\"Yes, you will. Give it to your mother. I'm not trying to buy you.\nI know what you think. But I'm not. I want to help you. I want to help\nyour family. I know where you live. I saw the place to-day. How many\nare there of you?\"\n\n\"Six,\" she answered faintly.\n\n\"The families of the poor,\" he thought.\n\n\"Well, you take this from me,\" he insisted, drawing a purse from\nhis coat. \"And I'll see you very soon again. There's no escape,\nsweet.\"\n\n\"No, no,\" she protested. \"I won't. I don't need it. No, you mustn't\nask me.\"\n\nHe insisted further, but she was firm, and finally he put the money\naway.\n\n\"One thing is sure, Jennie, you're not going to escape me,\" he said\nsoberly. \"You'll have to come to me eventually. Don't you know you\nwill? Your own attitude shows that. I'm not going to leave you\nalone.\"\n\n\"Oh, if you knew the trouble you're causing me.\"\n\n\"I'm not causing you any real trouble, am I?\" he asked. \"Surely\nnot.\"\n\n\"Yes. I can never do what you want.\"\n\n\"You will! You will!\" he exclaimed eagerly, the bare thought of\nthis prize escaping him heightening his passion. \"You'll come to me.\"\nAnd he drew her close in spite of all her protests.\n\n\"There,\" he said when, after the struggle, that mystic something\nbetween them spoke again, and she relaxed. Tears were in her eyes, but\nhe did not see them. \"Don't you see how it is? You like me too.\"\n\n\"I can't,\" she repeated, with a sob.\n\nHer evident distress touched him. \"You're not crying, little girl,\nare you?\" he asked.\n\nShe made no answer.\n\n\"I'm sorry,\" he went on. \"I'll not say anything more to-night.\nWe're almost at your home. I'm leaving to-morrow, but I'll see you\nagain. Yes, I will, sweet. I can't give you up now. I'll do anything\nin reason to make it easy for you, but I can't, do you hear?\"\n\nShe shook her head.\n\n\"Here's where you get out,\" he said, as the carriage drew up near\nthe corner. He could see the evening lamp gleaming behind the Gerhardt\ncottage curtains.\n\n\"Good-by,\" he said as she stepped out.\n\n\"Good-by,\" she murmured.\n\n\"Remember,\" he said, \"this is just the beginning.\"\n\n\"Oh no, no!\" she pleaded.\n\nHe looked after her as she walked away.\n\n\"The beauty!\" he exclaimed.\n\nJennie stepped into the house weary, discouraged, ashamed. What had\nshe done? There was no denying that she had compromised herself\nirretrievably. He would come back.\n\nHe would come back. And he had offered her money. That was the\nworst of all.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX\n\n\nThe inconclusive nature of this interview, exciting as it was, did\nnot leave any doubt in either Lester Kane's or Jennie's mind;\ncertainly this was not the end of the affair. Kane knew that he was\ndeeply fascinated. This girl was lovely. She was sweeter than he had\nhad any idea of. Her hesitancy, her repeated protests, her gentle \"no,\nno, no\" moved him as music might. Depend upon it, this girl was for\nhim, and he would get her. She was too sweet to let go. What did he\ncare about what his family or the world might think?\n\nIt was curious that Kane held the well-founded idea that in time\nJennie would yield to him physically, as she had already done\nspiritually. Just why he could not say. Something about her--a\nwarm womanhood, a guileless expression of countenance--intimated\na sympathy toward sex relationship which had nothing to do with hard,\nbrutal immorality. She was the kind of a woman who was made for a\nman--one man. All her attitude toward sex was bound up with love,\ntenderness, service. When the one man arrived she would love him and\nshe would go to him. That was Jennie as Lester understood her. He felt\nit. She would yield to him because he was the one man.\n\nOn Jennie's part there was a great sense of complication and of\npossible disaster. If he followed her of course he would learn all.\nShe had not told him about Brander, because she was still under the\nvague illusion that, in the end, she might escape. When she left him\nshe knew that he would come back. She knew, in spite of herself that\nshe wanted him to do so. Yet she felt that she must not yield, she\nmust go on leading her straitened, humdrum life. This was her\npunishment for having made a mistake. She had made her bed, and she\nmust lie on it.\n\nThe Kane family mansion at Cincinnati to which Lester returned\nafter leaving Jennie was an imposing establishment, which contrasted\nstrangely with the Gerhardt home. It was a great, rambling, two-story\naffair, done after the manner of the French chateaux, but in red brick\nand brownstone. It was set down, among flowers and trees, in an almost\npark-like inclosure, and its very stones spoke of a splendid dignity\nand of a refined luxury. Old Archibald Kane, the father, had amassed a\ntremendous fortune, not by grabbing and brow-beating and unfair\nmethods, but by seeing a big need and filling it. Early in life he had\nrealized that America was a growing country. There was going to be a\nbig demand for vehicles--wagons, carriages, drays--and he\nknew that some one would have to supply them. Having founded a small\nwagon industry, he had built it up into a great business; he made good\nwagons, and he sold them at a good profit. It was his theory that most\nmen were honest; he believed that at bottom they wanted honest things,\nand if you gave them these they would buy of you, and come back and\nbuy again and again, until you were an influential and rich man. He\nbelieved in the measure \"heaped full and running over.\" All through\nhis life and now in his old age he enjoyed the respect and approval of\nevery one who knew him. \"Archibald Kane,\" you would hear his\ncompetitors say, \"Ah, there is a fine man. Shrewd, but honest. He's a\nbig man.\"\n\nThis man was the father of two sons and three daughters, all\nhealthy, all good-looking, all blessed with exceptional minds, but\nnone of them so generous and forceful as their long-living and\nbig-hearted sire. Robert, the eldest, a man forty years of age, was\nhis father's right-hand man in financial matters, having a certain\nhard incisiveness which fitted him for the somewhat sordid details of\nbusiness life. He was of medium height, of a rather spare build, with\na high forehead, slightly inclined to baldness, bright, liquid-blue\neyes, an eagle nose, and thin, firm, even lips. He was a man of few\nwords, rather slow to action and of deep thought. He sat close to his\nfather as vice-president of the big company which occupied two whole\nblocks in an outlying section of the city. He was a strong man--a\ncoming man, as his father well knew.\n\nLester, the second boy, was his father's favorite. He was not by\nany means the financier that Robert was, but he had a larger vision of\nthe subtleties that underlie life. He was softer, more human, more\ngood-natured about everything. And, strangely enough, old Archibald\nadmired and trusted him. He knew he had the bigger vision. Perhaps he\nturned to Robert when it was a question of some intricate financial\nproblem, but Lester was the most loved as a son.\n\nThen there was Amy, thirty-two years of age, married, handsome, the\nmother of one child--a boy; Imogene, twenty-eight, also married,\nbut as yet without children, and Louise, twenty-five, single, the\nbest-looking of the girls, but also the coldest and most critical. She\nwas the most eager of all for social distinction, the most vigorous of\nall in her love of family prestige, the most desirous that the Kane\nfamily should outshine every other. She was proud to think that the\nfamily was so well placed socially, and carried herself with an air\nand a hauteur which was sometimes amusing, sometimes irritating to\nLester! He liked her--in a way she was his favorite\nsister--but he thought she might take herself with a little less\nseriousness and not do the family standing any harm.\n\nMrs. Kane, the mother, was a quiet, refined woman, sixty years of\nage, who, having come up from comparative poverty with her husband,\ncared but little for social life. But she loved her children and her\nhusband, and was naively proud of their position and attainments. It\nwas enough for her to shine only in their reflected glory. A good\nwoman, a good wife, and a good mother.\n\nLester arrived at Cincinnati early in the evening, and drove at\nonce to his home. An old Irish servitor met him at the door.\n\n\"Ah, Mr. Lester,\" he began, joyously, \"sure I'm glad to see you\nback. I'll take your coat. Yes, yes, it's been fine weather we're\nhaving. Yes, yes, the family's all well. Sure your sister Amy is just\nafter leavin' the house with the boy. Your mother's up-stairs in her\nroom. Yes, yes.\"\n\nLester smiled cheerily and went up to his mother's room. In this,\nwhich was done in white and gold and overlooked the garden to the\nsouth and east, sat Mrs. Kane, a subdued, graceful, quiet woman, with\nsmoothly laid gray hair. She looked up when the door opened, laid down\nthe volume that she had been reading, and rose to greet him.\n\n\"There you are, Mother,\" he said, putting his arms around her and\nkissing her. \"How are you?\"\n\n\"Oh, I'm just about the same, Lester. How have you been?\"\n\n\"Fine. I was up with the Bracebridges for a few days again. I had\nto stop off in Cleveland to see Parsons. They all asked after\nyou.\"\n\n\"How is Minnie?\"\n\n\"Just the same. She doesn't change any that I can see. She's just\nas interested in entertaining as she ever was.\"\n\n\"She's a bright girl,\" remarked his mother, recalling Mrs.\nBracebridge as a girl in Cincinnati. \"I always liked her. She's so\nsensible.\"\n\n\"She hasn't lost any of that, I can tell you,\" replied Lester\nsignificantly. Mrs. Kane smiled and went on to speak of various family\nhappenings. Imogene's husband was leaving for St. Louis on some\nerrand. Robert's wife was sick with a cold. Old Zwingle, the yard\nwatchman at the factory, who had been with Mr. Kane for over forty\nyears, had died. Her husband was going to the funeral. Lester listened\ndutifully, albeit a trifle absently.\n\nLester, as he walked down the hall, encountered Louise. \"Smart\" was\nthe word for her. She was dressed in a beaded black silk dress,\nfitting close to her form, with a burst of rubies at her throat which\ncontrasted effectively with her dark complexion and black hair. Her\neyes were black and piercing.\n\n\"Oh, there you are, Lester,\" she exclaimed. \"When did you get in?\nBe careful how you kiss me. I'm going out, and I'm all fixed, even to\nthe powder on my nose. Oh, you bear!\" Lester had gripped her firmly\nand kissed her soundly. She pushed him away with her strong hands.\n\n\"I didn't brush much of it off,\" he said. \"You can always dust more\non with that puff of yours.\" He passed on to his own room to dress for\ndinner. Dressing for dinner was a custom that had been adopted by the\nKane family in the last few years. Guests had become so common that in\na way it was a necessity, and Louise, in particular, made a point of\nit. To-night Robert was coming, and a Mr. and Mrs. Burnett, old\nfriends of his father and mother, and so, of course, the meal would be\na formal one. Lester knew that his father was around somewhere, but he\ndid not trouble to look him up now. He was thinking of his last two\ndays in Cleveland and wondering when he would see Jennie again.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX\n\n\nAs Lester came down-stairs after making his toilet he found his\nfather in the library reading.\n\n\"Hello, Lester,\" he said, looking up from his paper over the top of\nhis glasses and extending his hand. \"Where do you come from?\"\n\n\"Cleveland,\" replied his son, shaking hands heartily, and\nsmiling.\n\n\"Robert tells me you've been to New York.\"\n\n\"Yes, I was there.\"\n\n\"How did you find my old friend Arnold?\"\n\n\"Just about the same,\" returned Lester. \"He doesn't look any\nolder.\"\n\n\"I suppose not,\" said Archibald Kane genially, as if the report\nwere a compliment to his own hardy condition. \"He's been a temperate\nman. A fine old gentleman.\"\n\nHe led the way back to the sitting-room where they chatted over\nbusiness and home news until the chime of the clock in the hall warned\nthe guests up-stairs that dinner had been served.\n\nLester sat down in great comfort amid the splendors of the great\nLouis Quinze dining-room. He liked this homey home\natmosphere--his mother and father and his sisters--the old\nfamily friends. So he smiled and was exceedingly genial.\n\nLouise announced that the Leverings were going to give a dance on\nTuesday, and inquired whether he intended to go.\n\n\"You know I don't dance,\" he returned dryly. \"Why should I go?\"\n\n\"Don't dance? Won't dance, you mean. You're getting too lazy to\nmove. If Robert is willing to dance occasionally I think you\nmight.\"\n\n\"Robert's got it on me in lightness,\" Lester replied, airily.\n\n\"And politeness,\" retorted Louise.\n\n\"Be that as it may,\" said Lester.\n\n\"Don't try to stir up a fight, Louise,\" observed Robert,\nsagely.\n\nAfter dinner they adjourned to the library, and Robert talked with\nhis brother a little on business. There were some contracts coming up\nfor revision. He wanted to see what suggestions Lester had to make.\nLouise was going to a party, and the carriage was now announced. \"So\nyou are not coming?\" she asked, a trifle complainingly.\n\n\"Too tired,\" said Lester lightly. \"Make my excuses to Mrs.\nKnowles.\"\n\n\"Letty Pace asked about you the other night,\" Louise called back\nfrom the door.\n\n\"Kind,\" replied Lester. \"I'm greatly obliged.\"\n\n\"She's a nice girl, Lester,\" put in his father, who was standing\nnear the open fire. \"I only wish you would marry her and settle down.\nYou'd have a good wife in her.\"\n\n\"She's charming,\" testified Mrs. Kane.\n\n\"What is this?\" asked Lester jocularly--\"a conspiracy? You\nknow I'm not strong on the matrimonial business.\"\n\n\"And I well know it,\" replied his mother semi-seriously. \"I wish\nyou were.\"\n\nLester changed the subject. He really could not stand for this sort\nof thing any more, he told himself. And as he thought his mind\nwandered back to Jennie and her peculiar \"Oh no, no!\" There was\nsomeone that appealed to him. That was a type of womanhood worth\nwhile. Not sophisticated, not self-seeking, not watched over and set\nlike a man-trap in the path of men, but a sweet little\ngirl--sweet as a flower, who was without anybody, apparently, to\nwatch over her. That night in his room he composed a letter, which he\ndated a week later, because he did not want to appear too urgent and\nbecause he could not again leave Cincinnati for at least two\nweeks.\n\n\"MY DEAR JENNIE, Although it has been a week, and I have said\nnothing, I have not forgotten you--believe me. Was the impression\nI gave of myself very bad? I will make it better from now on, for I\nlove you, little girl--I really do. There is a flower on my table\nwhich reminds me of you very much--white, delicate, beautiful.\nYour personality, lingering with me, is just that. You are the essence\nof everything beautiful to me. It is in your power to strew flowers in\nmy path if you will.\n\n\"But what I want to say here is that I shall be in Cleveland on the\n18th, and I shall expect to see you. I arrive Thursday night, and I\nwant you to meet me in the ladies' parlor of the Dornton at noon\nFriday. Will you? You can lunch with me.\n\n\"You see, I respect your suggestion that I should not call. (I will\nnot--on condition.) These separations are dangerous to good\nfriendship. Write me that you will. I throw myself on your generosity.\nBut I can't take \"no\" for an answer, not now.\n\n\"With a world of affection.\n\n\"LESTER KANE.\"\n\nHe sealed the letter and addressed it. \"She's a remarkable girl in\nher way,\" he thought. \"She really is.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI\n\n\nThe arrival of this letter, coming after a week of silence and\nafter she had had a chance to think, moved Jennie deeply. What did she\nwant to do? What ought she to do? How did she truly feel about this\nman? Did she sincerely wish to answer his letter? If she did so, what\nshould she say? Heretofore all her movements, even the one in which\nshe had sought to sacrifice herself for the sake of Bass in Columbus,\nhad not seemed to involve any one but herself. Now, there seemed to be\nothers to consider--her family, above all, her child. The little\nVesta was now eighteen months of age; she was an interesting child;\nher large, blue eyes and light hair giving promise of a comeliness\nwhich would closely approximate that of her mother, while her mential\ntraits indicated a clear and intelligent mind. Mrs. Gerhardt had\nbecome very fond of her. Gerhardt had unbended so gradually that his\ninterest was not even yet clearly discernible, but he had a distinct\nfeeling of kindliness toward her. And this readjustment of her\nfather's attitude had aroused in Jennie an ardent desire to so conduct\nherself that no pain should ever come to him again. Any new folly on\nher part would not only be base ingratitude to her father, but would\ntend to injure the prospects of her little one. Her life was a\nfailure, she fancied, but Vesta's was a thing apart; she must do\nnothing to spoil it. She wondered whether it would not be better to\nwrite Lester and explain everything. She had told him that she did not\nwish to do wrong. Suppose she went on to inform him that she had a\nchild, and beg him to leave her in peace. Would he obey her? She\ndoubted it. Did she really want him to take her at her word?\n\nThe need of making this confession was a painful thing to Jennie.\nIt caused her to hesitate, to start a letter in which she tried to\nexplain, and then to tear it up. Finally, fate intervened in the\nsudden home-coming of her father, who had been seriously injured by an\naccident at the glass-works in Youngstown where he worked.\n\nIt was on a Wednesday afternoon, in the latter part of August, when\na letter came from Gerhardt. But instead of the customary fatherly\ncommunication, written in German and inclosing the regular weekly\nremittance of five dollars, there was only a brief note, written by\nanother hand, and explaining that the day before Gerhardt had received\na severe burn on both hands, due to the accidental overturning of a\ndipper of molten glass. The letter added that he would be home the\nnext morning.\n\n\"What do you think of that?\" exclaimed William, his mouth wide\nopen.\n\n\"Poor papa!\" said Veronica, tears welling up in her eyes.\n\nMrs. Gerhardt sat down, clasped her hands in her lap, and stared at\nthe floor. \"Now, what to do?\" she nervously exclaimed. The possibility\nthat Gerhardt was disabled for life opened long vistas of difficulties\nwhich she had not the courage to contemplate.\n\nBass came home at half-past six and Jennie at eight. The former\nheard the news with an astonished face.\n\n\"Gee! that's tough, isn't it?\" he exclaimed. \"Did the letter say\nhow bad he was hurt?\"\n\n\"No,\" replied Mrs. Gerhardt.\n\n\"Well, I wouldn't worry about it,\" said Bass easily. \"It won't do\nany good. We'll get along somehow. I wouldn't worry like that if I\nwere you.\"\n\nThe truth was, he wouldn't, because his nature was wholly\ndifferent. Life did not rest heavily upon his shoulders. His brain was\nnot large enough to grasp the significance and weigh the results of\nthings.\n\n\"I know,\" said Mrs. Gerhardt, endeavoring to recover herself. \"I\ncan't help it, though. To think that just when we were getting along\nfairly well this new calamity should be added. It seems sometimes as\nif we were under a curse. We have so much bad luck.\"\n\nWhen Jennie came her mother turned to her instinctively; here was\nher one stay.\n\n\"What's the matter, ma?\" asked Jennie as she opened the door and\nobserved her mother's face. \"What have you been crying about?\"\n\nMrs. Gerhardt looked at her, and then turned half away.\n\n\"Pa's had his hands burned,\" put in Bass solemnly. \"He'll be home\nto-morrow.\"\n\nJennie turned and stared at him. \"His hands burned!\" she\nexclaimed.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Bass.\n\n\"How did it happen?\"\n\n\"A pot of glass was turned over.\"\n\nJennie looked at her mother, and her eyes dimmed with tears.\nInstinctively she ran to her and put her arms around her.\n\n\"Now, don't you cry, ma,\" she said, barely able to control herself.\n\"Don't you worry. I know how you feel, but we'll get along. Don't cry\nnow.\" Then her own lips lost their evenness, and she struggled long\nbefore she could pluck up courage to contemplate this new disaster.\nAnd now without volition upon her part there leaped into her\nconsciousness a new and subtly persistent thought. What about Lester's\noffer of assistance now? What about his declaration of love? Somehow\nit came back to her--his affection, his personality, his desire\nto help her, his sympathy, so like that which Brander had shown when\nBass was in jail. Was she doomed to a second sacrifice? Did it really\nmake any difference? Wasn't her life a failure already? She thought\nthis over as she looked at her mother sitting there so silent,\nhaggard, and distraught. \"What a pity,\" she thought, \"that her mother\nmust always suffer! Wasn't it a shame that she could never have any\nreal happiness?\"\n\n\"I wouldn't feel so badly,\" she said, after a time. \"Maybe pa isn't\nburned so badly as we think. Did the letter say he'd be home in the\nmorning?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Mrs. Gerhardt, recovering herself.\n\nThey talked more quietly from now on, and gradually, as the details\nwere exhausted, a kind of dumb peace settled down upon the\nhousehold.\n\n\"One of us ought to go to the train to meet him in the morning,\"\nsaid Jennie to Bass. \"I will. I guess Mrs. Bracebridge won't\nmind.\"\n\n\"No,\" said Bass gloomily, \"you mustn't. I can go.\"\n\nHe was sour at this new fling of fate, and he looked his feelings;\nhe stalked off gloomily to his room and shut himself in. Jennie and\nher mother saw the others off to bed, and then sat out in the kitchen\ntalking.\n\n\"I don't see what's to become of us now,\" said Mrs. Gerhardt at\nlast, completely overcome by the financial complications which this\nnew calamity had brought about. She looked so weak and helpless that\nJennie could hardly contain herself.\n\n\"Don't worry, mamma dear,\" she said, softly, a peculiar resolve\ncoming into her heart. The world was wide. There was comfort and ease\nin it scattered by others with a lavish hand. Surely, surely\nmisfortune could not press so sharply but that they could live!\n\nShe sat down with her mother, the difficulties of the future\nseeming to approach with audible and ghastly steps.\n\n\"What do you suppose will become of us now?\" repeated her mother,\nwho saw how her fanciful conception of this Cleveland home had\ncrumbled before her eyes.\n\n\"Why,\" said Jennie, who saw clearly and knew what could be done,\n\"it will be all right. I wouldn't worry about it. Something will\nhappen. We'll get something.\"\n\nShe realized, as she sat there, that fate had shifted the burden of\nthe situation to her. She must sacrifice herself; there was no other\nway.\n\nBass met his father at the railway station in the morning. He\nlooked very pale, and seemed to have suffered a great deal. His cheeks\nwere slightly sunken and his bony profile appeared rather gaunt. His\nhands were heavily bandaged, and altogether he presented such a\npicture of distress that many stopped to look at him on the way home\nfrom the station.\n\n\"By chops,\" he said to Bass, \"that was a burn I got. I thought once\nI couldn't stand the pain any longer. Such pain I had! Such pain! By\nchops! I will never forget it.\"\n\nHe related just how the accident had occurred, and said that he did\nnot know whether he would ever be able to use his hands again. The\nthumb on his right hand and the first two fingers on the left had been\nburned to the bone. The latter had been amputated at the first\njoint--the thumb he might save, but his hands would be in danger\nof being stiff.\n\n\"By chops!\" he added, \"just at the time when I needed the money\nmost. Too bad! Too bad!\"\n\nWhen they reached the house, and Mrs. Gerhardt opened the door, the\nold mill-worker, conscious of her voiceless sympathy, began to cry.\nMrs. Gerhardt sobbed also. Even Bass lost control of himself for a\nmoment or two, but quickly recovered. The other children wept, until\nBass called a halt on all of them.\n\n\"Don't cry now,\" he said cheeringly. \"What's the use of crying? It\nisn't so bad as all that. You'll be all right again. We can get\nalong.\"\n\nBass's words had a soothing effect, temporarily, and, now that her\nhusband was home, Mrs. Gerhardt recovered her composure. Though his\nhands were bandaged, the mere fact that he could walk and was not\notherwise injured was some consolation. He might recover the use of\nhis hands and be able to undertake light work again. Anyway, they\nwould hope for the best.\n\nWhen Jennie came home that night she wanted to run to her father\nand lay the treasury of her services and affection at his feet, but\nshe trembled lest he might be as cold to her as formerly.\n\nGerhardt, too, was troubled. Never had he completely recovered from\nthe shame which his daughter had brought upon him. Although he wanted\nto be kindly, his feelings were so tangled that he hardly knew what to\nsay or do.\n\n\"Papa,\" said Jennie, approaching him timidly.\n\nGerhardt looked confused and tried to say something natural, but it\nwas unavailing. The thought of his helplessness, the knowledge of her\nsorrow and of his own responsiveness to her affection--it was all\ntoo much for him; he broke down again and cried helplessly.\n\n\"Forgive me, papa,\" she pleaded, \"I'm so sorry. Oh, I'm so\nsorry.\"\n\nHe did not attempt to look at her, but in the swirl of feeling that\ntheir meeting created he thought that he could forgive, and he\ndid.\n\n\"I have prayed,\" he said brokenly. \"It is all right.\"\n\nWhen he recovered himself he felt ashamed of his emotion, but a new\nrelationship of sympathy and of understanding had been established.\nFrom that time, although there was always a great reserve between\nthem, Gerhardt tried not to ignore her completely, and she endeavored\nto show him the simple affection of a daughter, just as in the old\ndays.\n\nBut while the household was again at peace, there were other cares\nand burdens to be faced. How were they to get along now with five\ndollars taken from the weekly budget, and with the cost of Gerhardt's\npresence added? Bass might have contributed more of his weekly\nearnings, but he did not feel called upon to do it. And so the small\nsum of nine dollars weekly must meet as best it could the current\nexpenses of rent, food, and coal, to say nothing of incidentals, which\nnow began to press very heavily. Gerhardt had to go to a doctor to\nhave his hands dressed daily. George needed a new pair of shoes.\nEither more money must come from some source or the family must beg\nfor credit and suffer the old tortures of want. The situation\ncrystallized the half-formed resolve in Jennie's mind.\n\nLester's letter had been left unanswered. The day was drawing near.\nShould she write? He would help them. Had he not tried to force money\non her? She finally decided that it was her duty to avail herself of\nthis proffered assistance. She sat down and wrote him a brief note.\nShe would meet him as he had requested, but he would please not come\nto the house. She mailed the letter, and then waited, with mingled\nfeelings of trepidation and thrilling expectancy, the arrival of the\nfateful day.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXII\n\n\nThe fatal Friday came, and Jennie stood face to face with this new\nand overwhelming complication in her modest scheme of existence. There\nwas really no alternative, she thought. Her own life was a failure.\nWhy go on fighting? If she could make her family happy, if she could\ngive Vesta a good education, if she could conceal the true nature of\nthis older story and keep Vesta in the background perhaps,\nperhaps--well, rich men had married poor girls before this, and\nLester was very kind, he certainly liked her. At seven o'clock she\nwent to Mrs. Bracebridge's; at noon she excused herself on the pretext\nof some work for her mother and left the house for the hotel.\n\nLester, leaving Cincinnati a few days earlier than he expected, had\nfailed to receive her reply; he arrived at Cleveland feeling sadly out\nof tune with the world. He had a lingering hope that a letter from\nJennie might be awaiting him at the hotel, but there was no word from\nher. He was a man not easily wrought up, but to-night he felt\ndepressed, and so went gloomily up to his room and changed his linen.\nAfter supper he proceeded to drown his dissatisfaction in a game of\nbilliards with some friends, from whom he did not part until he had\ntaken very much more than his usual amount of alcoholic stimulant. The\nnext morning he arose with a vague idea of abandoning the whole\naffair, but as the hours elapsed and the time of his appointment drew\nnear he decided that it might not be unwise to give her one last\nchance. She might come. Accordingly, when it still lacked a quarter of\nan hour of the time, he went down into the parlor. Great was his\ndelight when he beheld her sitting in a chair and waiting--the\noutcome of her acquiescence. He walked briskly up, a satisfied,\ngratified smile on his face.\n\n\"So you did come after all,\" he said, gazing at her with the look\nof one who has lost and recovered a prize. \"What do you mean by not\nwriting me? I thought from the way you neglected me that you had made\nup your mind not to come at all.\"\n\n\"I did write,\" she replied.\n\n\"Where?\"\n\n\"To the address you gave me. I wrote three days ago.\"\n\n\"That explains it. It came too late. You should have written me\nbefore. How have you been?\"\n\n\"Oh, all right,\" she replied.\n\n\"You don't look it!\" he said. \"You look worried. What's the\ntrouble, Jennie? Nothing gone wrong out at your house, has there?\"\n\nIt was a fortuitous question. He hardly knew why lie had asked it.\nYet it opened the door to what she wanted to say.\n\n\"My father's sick,\" she replied.\n\n\"What's happened to him?\"\n\n\"He burned his hands at the glass-works. We've been terribly\nworried. It looks as though he would not be able to use them any\nmore.\"\n\nShe paused, looking the distress she felt, and he saw plainly that\nshe was facing a crisis.\n\n\"That's too bad,\" he said. \"That certainly is. When did this\nhappen?\"\n\n\"Oh, almost three weeks ago now.\"\n\n\"It certainly is bad. Come in to lunch, though. I want to talk with\nyou. I've been wanting to get a better understanding of your family\naffairs ever since I left.\" He led the way into the dining-room and\nselected a secluded table. He tried to divert her mind by asking her\nto order the luncheon, but she was too worried and too shy to do so\nand he had to make out the menu by himself. Then he turned to her with\na cheering air. \"Now, Jennie,\" he said, \"I want you to tell me all\nabout your family. I got a little something of it last time, but I\nwant to get it straight. Your father, you said, was a glass-blower by\ntrade. Now he can't work any more at that, that's obvious.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" she said.\n\n\"How many other children are there?\"\n\n\"Six.\"\n\n\"Are you the oldest?\"\n\n\"No, my brother Sebastian is. He's twenty-two.\"\n\n\"And what does he do?\"\n\n\"He's a clerk in a cigar store.\"\n\n\"Do you know how much he makes?\"\n\n\"I think it's twelve dollars,\" she replied thoughtfully.\n\n\"And the other children?\"\n\n\"Martha and Veronica don't do anything yet. They're too young. My\nbrother George works at Wilson's. He's a cash-boy. He gets three\ndollars and a half.\"\n\n\"And how much do you make?\"\n\n\"I make four.\"\n\nHe stopped, figuring up mentally just what they had to live on.\n\"How much rent do you pay?\" he continued.\n\n\"Twelve dollars.\"\n\n\"How old is your mother?\"\n\n\"She's nearly fifty now.\"\n\nHe turned a fork in his hands back and forth; he was thinking\nearnestly.\n\n\"To tell you the honest truth, I fancied it was something like\nthat, Jennie,\" he said. \"I've been thinking about you a lot. Now, I\nknow. There's only one answer to your problem, and it isn't such a bad\none, if you'll only believe me.\" He paused for an inquiry, but she\nmade none. Her mind was running on her own difficulties.\n\n\"Don't you want to know?\" he inquired.\n\n\"Yes,\" she answered mechanically.\n\n\"It's me,\" he replied. \"You have to let me help you. I wanted to\nlast time. Now you have to; do you hear?\"\n\n\"I thought I wouldn't,\" she said simply.\n\n\"I knew what you thought,\" he replied. \"That's all over now. I'm\ngoing to 'tend to that family of yours. And I'll do it right now while\nI think of it.\"\n\nHe drew out his purse and extracted several ten and twenty-dollar\nbills--two hundred and fifty dollars in all. \"I want you to take\nthis,\" he said. \"It's just the beginning. I will see that your family\nis provided for from now on. Here, give me your hand.\"\n\n\"Oh no,\" she said. \"Not so much. Don't give me all that.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" he replied. \"Don't argue. Here. Give me your hand.\"\n\nShe put it out in answer to the summons of his eyes, and he shut\nher fingers on the money, pressing them gently at the same time. \"I\nwant you to have it, sweet. I love you, little girl. I'm not going to\nsee you suffer, nor any one belonging to you.\"\n\nHer eyes looked a dumb thankfulness, and she bit her lips.\n\n\"I don't know how to thank you,\" she said.\n\n\"You don't need to,\" he replied. \"The thanks are all the other\nway--believe me.\"\n\nHe paused and looked at her, the beauty of her face holding him.\nShe looked at the table, wondering what would come next.\n\n\"How would you like to leave what you're doing and stay at home?\"\nhe asked. \"That would give you your freedom day times.\"\n\n\"I couldn't do that,\" she replied. \"Papa wouldn't allow it. He\nknows I ought to work.\"\n\n\"That's true enough,\" he said. \"But there's so little in what\nyou're doing. Good heavens! Four dollars a week! I would be glad to\ngive you fifty times that sum if I thought there was any way in which\nyou could use it.\" He idly thrummed the cloth with his fingers.\n\n\"I couldn't,\" she said. \"I hardly know how to use this. They'll\nsuspect. I'll have to tell mamma.\"\n\nFrom the way she said it he judged there must be some bond of\nsympathy between her and her mother which would permit of a confidence\nsuch as this. He was by no means a hard man, and the thought touched\nhim. But he would not relinquish his purpose.\n\n\"There's only one thing to be done, as far as I can see,\" he went\non very gently. \"You're not suited for the kind of work you're doing.\nYou're too refined. I object to it. Give it up and come with me down\nto New York; I'll take good care of you. I love you and want you. As\nfar as your family is concerned, you won't have to worry about them\nany more. You can take a nice home for them and furnish it in any\nstyle you please. Wouldn't you like that?\"\n\nHe paused, and Jennie's thoughts reverted quickly to her mother,\nher dear mother. All her life long Mrs. Gerhardt had been talking of\nthis very thing--a nice home. If they could just have a larger\nhouse, with good furniture and a yard filled with trees, how happy she\nwould be. In such a home she would be free of the care of rent, the\ndiscomfort of poor furniture, the wretchedness of poverty; she would\nbe so happy. She hesitated there while his keen eye followed her in\nspirit, and he saw what a power he had set in motion. It had been a\nhappy inspiration--the suggestion of a decent home for the\nfamily. He waited a few minutes longer, and then said:\n\n\"Well, wouldn't you better let me do that?\"\n\n\"It would be very nice,\" she said, \"but it can't be done now. I\ncouldn't leave home. Papa would want to know all about where I was\ngoing. I wouldn't know what to say.\"\n\n\"Why couldn't you pretend that you are going down to New York with\nMrs. Bracebridge?\" he suggested. \"There couldn't be any objection to\nthat, could there?\"\n\n\"Not if they didn't find out,\" she said, her eyes opening in\namazement. \"But if they should!\"\n\n\"They won't,\" he replied calmly. \"They're not watching Mrs.\nBracebridge's affairs. Plenty of mistresses take their maids on long\ntrips. Why not simply tell them you're invited to go--have to\ngo--and then go?\"\n\n\"Do you think I could?\" she inquired.\n\n\"Certainly,\" he replied. \"What is there peculiar about that?\"\n\nShe thought it over, and the plan did seem feasible. Then she\nlooked at this man and realized that relationship with him meant\npossible motherhood for her again. The tragedy of giving birth to a\nchild--ah, she could not go through that a second time, at least\nunder the same conditions. She could not bring herself to tell him\nabout Vesta, but she must voice this insurmountable objection.\n\n\"I--\" she said, formulating the first word of her sentence,\nand then stopping.\n\n\"Yes,\" he said. \"I--what?\"\n\n\"I--\" She paused again.\n\nHe loved her shy ways, her sweet, hesitating lips.\n\n\"What is it, Jennie?\" he asked helpfully. \"You're so delicious.\nCan't you tell me?\"\n\nHer hand was on the table. He reached over and laid his strong\nbrown one on top of it.\n\n\"I couldn't have a baby,\" she said, finally, and looked down.\n\nHe gazed at her, and the charm of her frankness, her innate decency\nunder conditions so anomalous, her simple unaffected recognition of\nthe primal facts of life lifted her to a plane in his esteem which she\nhad not occupied until that moment.\n\n\"You're a great girl, Jennie,\" he said. \"You're wonderful. But\ndon't worry about that. It can be arranged. You don't need to have a\nchild unless you want to, and I don't want you to.\"\n\nHe saw the question written in her wondering, shamed face.\n\n\"It's so,\" he said. \"You believe me, don't you? You think I know,\ndon't you?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" she faltered.\n\n\"Well, I do. But anyway, I wouldn't let any trouble come to you.\nI'll take you away. Besides, I don't want any children. There wouldn't\nbe any satisfaction in that proposition for me at this time. I'd\nrather wait. But there won't be--don't worry.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" she said faintly. Not for worlds could she have met his\neyes.\n\n\"Look here, Jennie,\" he said, after a time. \"You care for me, don't\nyou? You don't think I'd sit here and plead with you if I didn't care\nfor you? I'm crazy about you, and that's the literal truth. You're\nlike wine to me. I want you to come with me. I want you to do it\nquickly. I know how difficult this family business is, but you can\narrange it. Come with me down to New York. We'll work out something\nlater. I'll meet your family. We'll pretend a courtship, anything you\nlike--only come now.\"\n\n\"You don't mean right away, do you?\" she asked, startled.\n\n\"Yes, to-morrow if possible. Monday sure. You can arrange it. Why,\nif Mrs. Bracebridge asked you you'd go fast enough, and no one would\nthink anything about it. Isn't that so?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" she admitted slowly.\n\n\"Well, then, why not now?\"\n\n\"It's always so much harder to work out a falsehood,\" she replied\nthoughtfully.\n\n\"I know it, but you can come. Won't you?\"\n\n\"Won't you wait a little while?\" she pleaded. \"It's so very sudden.\nI'm afraid.\"\n\n\"Not a day, sweet, that I can help. Can't you see how I feel? Look\nin my eyes. Will you?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" she replied sorrowfully, and yet with a strange thrill of\naffection. \"I will.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIII\n\n\nThe business of arranging for this sudden departure was really not\nso difficult as it first appeared. Jennie proposed to tell her mother\nthe whole truth, and there was nothing to say to her father except\nthat she was going with Mrs. Bracebridge at the latter's request. He\nmight question her, but he really could not doubt Before going home\nthat afternoon she accompanied Lester to a department store, where she\nwas fitted out with a trunk, a suit-case, and a traveling suit and\nhat. Lester was very proud of his prize. \"When we get to New York I am\ngoing to get you some real things,\" he told her. \"I am going to show\nyou what you can be made to look like.\" He had all the purchased\narticles packed in the trunk and sent to his hotel. Then he arranged\nto have Jennie come there and dress Monday for the trip which began in\nthe afternoon.\n\nWhen she came home Mrs. Gerhardt, who was in the kitchen, received\nher with her usual affectionate greeting. \"Have you been working very\nhard?\" she asked. \"You look tired.\"\n\n\"No,\" she said, \"I'm not tired. It isn't that. I just don't feel\ngood.\"\n\n\"What's the trouble?\"\n\n\"Oh, I have to tell you something, mamma. It's so hard.\" She\npaused, looking inquiringly at her mother, and then away.\n\n\"Why, what is it?\" asked her mother nervously. So many things had\nhappened in the past that she was always on the alert for some new\ncalamity. \"You haven't lost your place, have you?\"\n\n\"No,\" replied Jennie, with an effort to maintain her mental poise,\n\"but I'm going to leave it.\"\n\n\"No!\" exclaimed her mother. \"Why?\"\n\n\"I'm going to New York.\"\n\nHer mother's eyes opened widely. \"Why, when did you decide to do\nthat?\" she inquired.\n\n\"To-day.\"\n\n\"You don't mean it!\"\n\n\"Yes, I do, mamma. Listen. I've got something I want to tell you.\nYou know how poor we are. There isn't any way we can make things come\nout right. I have found some one who wants to help us. He says he\nloves me, and he wants me to go to New York with him Monday. I've\ndecided to go.\"\n\n\"Oh, Jennie!\" exclaimed her mother. \"Surely not! You wouldn't do\nanything like that after all that's happened. Think of your\nfather.\"\n\n\"I've thought it all out,\" went on Jennie, firmly. \"It's really for\nthe best. He's a good man. I know he is. He has lots of money. He\nwants me to go with him, and I'd better go. He will take a new house\nfor us when we come back and help us to get along. No one will ever\nhave me as a wife--you know that. It might as well be this way.\nHe loves me. And I love him. Why shouldn't I go?\"\n\n\"Does he know about Vesta?\" asked her mother cautiously.\n\n\"No,\" said Jennie guiltily. \"I thought I'd better not tell him\nabout her. She oughtn't to be brought into it if I can help it.\"\n\n\"I'm afraid you're storing up trouble for yourself, Jennie,\" said\nher mother. \"Don't you think he is sure to find it out some time?\"\n\n\"I thought maybe that she could be kept here,\" suggested Jennie,\n\"until she's old enough to go to school. Then maybe I could send her\nsomewhere.\"\n\n\"She might,\" assented her mother; \"but don't you think it would be\nbetter to tell him now? He won't think any the worse of you.\"\n\n\"It isn't that. It's her,\" said Jennie passionately. \"I don't want\nher to be brought into it.\"\n\nHer mother shook her head. \"Where did you meet him?\" she\ninquired.\n\n\"At Mrs. Bracebridge's.\"\n\n\"How long ago?\"\n\n\"Oh, it's been almost two months now.\"\n\n\"And you never said anything about him,\" protested Mrs. Gerhardt\nreproachfully.\n\n\"I didn't know that he cared for me this way,\" said Jennie\ndefensively.\n\n\"Why didn't you wait and let him come out here first?\" asked her\nmother. \"It will make things so much easier. You can't go and not have\nyour father find out.\"\n\n\"I thought I'd say I was going with Mrs. Bracebridge. Papa can't\nobject to my going with her.\"\n\n\"No,\" agreed her mother thoughtfully.\n\nThe two looked at each other in silence. Mrs. Gerhardt, with her\nimaginative nature, endeavored to formulate some picture of this new\nand wonderful personality that had come into Jennie's life. He was\nwealthy; he wanted to take Jennie; he wanted to give them a good home.\nWhat a story!\n\n\"And he gave me this,\" put in Jennie, who, with some instinctive\npsychic faculty, had been following her mother's mood. She opened her\ndress at the neck, and took out the two hundred and fifty dollars; she\nplaced the money in her mother's hands.\n\nThe latter stared at it wide-eyed. Here was the relief for all her\nwoes--food, clothes, rent, coal--all done up in one small\npackage of green and yellow bills. If there were plenty of money in\nthe house Gerhardt need not worry about his burned hands; George and\nMartha and Veronica could be clothed in comfort and made happy.\n\nJennie could dress better; there would be a future education for\nVesta.\n\n\"Do you think he might ever want to marry you?\" asked her mother\nfinally.\n\n\"I don't know,\" replied Jennie \"he might. I know he loves me.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said her mother after a long pause, \"if you're going to\ntell your father you'd better do it right away. He'll think it's\nstrange as it is.\"\n\nJennie realized that she had won. Her mother had acquiesced from\nsheer force of circumstances. She was sorry, but somehow it seemed to\nbe for the best. \"I'll help you out with it,\" her mother had\nconcluded, with a little sigh.\n\nThe difficulty of telling this lie was very great for Mrs.\nGerhardt, but she went through the falsehood with a seeming\nnonchalance which allayed Gerhardt's suspicions. The children were\nalso told, and when, after the general discussion, Jennie repeated the\nfalsehood to her father it seemed natural enough.\n\n\"How long do you think you'll be gone?\" he inquired.\n\n\"About two or three weeks,\" she replied.\n\n\"That's a nice trip,\" he said. \"I came through New York in 1844. It\nwas a small place then compared to what it is now.\"\n\nSecretly he was pleased that Jennie should have this fine chance.\nHer employer must like her.\n\nWhen Monday came Jennie bade her parents good-by and left early,\ngoing straight to the Dornton, where Lester awaited her.\n\n\"So you came,\" he said gaily, greeting her as she entered the\nladies' parlor.\n\n\"Yes,\" she said simply.\n\n\"You are my niece,\" he went on. \"I have engaged H room for you near\nmine. I'll call for the key, and you go dress. When you're ready I'll\nhave the trunk sent to the depot. The train leaves at one\no'clock.\"\n\nShe went to her room and dressed, while he fidgeted about, read,\nsmoked, and finally knocked at her door.\n\nShe replied by opening to him, fully clad.\n\n\"You look charming,\" he said with a smile.\n\nShe looked down, for she was nervous and distraught. The whole\nprocess of planning, lying, nerving herself to carry out her part had\nbeen hard on her. She looked tired and worried.\n\n\"Not grieving, are you?\" he asked, seeing how things stood.\n\n\"No-o,\" she replied.\n\n\"Come now, sweet. You mustn't feel this way. It's coming out all\nright.\" He took her in his arms and kissed her, and they strolled down\nthe hall. He was astonished to see how well she looked in even these\nsimple clothes--the best she had ever had.\n\nThey reached the depot after a short carriage ride. The\naccommodations had been arranged for before hand, and Kane had allowed\njust enough time to make the train. When they settled themselves in a\nPullman state-room it was with a keen sense of satisfaction on his\npart. Life looked rosy. Jennie was beside him. He had succeeded in\nwhat he had started out to do. So might it always be.\n\nAs the train rolled out of the depot and the long reaches of the\nfields succeeded Jennie studied them wistfully. There were the\nforests, leafless and bare; the wide, brown fields, wet with the rains\nof winter; the low farm-houses sitting amid flat stretches of prairie,\ntheir low roofs making them look as if they were hugging the ground.\nThe train roared past little hamlets, with cottages of white and\nyellow and drab, their roofs blackened by frost and rain. Jennie noted\none in particular which seemed to recall the old neighborhood where\nthey used to live at Columbus; she put her handkerchief to her eyes\nand began silently to cry.\n\n\"I hope you're not crying, are you, Jennie?\" said\n\nLester, looking up suddenly from the letter he had been reading.\n\"Come, come,\" he went on as he saw a faint tremor shaking her. \"This\nwon't do. You have to do better than this. You'll never get along if\nyou act that way.\"\n\nShe made no reply, and the depth of her silent grief filled him\nwith strange sympathies.\n\n\"Don't cry,\" he continued soothingly; \"everything will be all\nright. I told you that. You needn't worry about anything.\"\n\nJennie made a great effort to recover herself, and began to dry her\neyes.\n\n\"You don't want to give way like that,\" he continued. \"It doesn't\ndo you any good. I know how you feel about leaving home, but tears\nwon't help it any. It isn't as if you were going away for good, you\nknow. Besides, you'll be going back shortly. You care for me, don't\nyou, sweet? I'm something?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" she said, and managed to smile back at him.\n\nLester returned to his correspondence and Jennie fell to thinking\nof Vesta. It troubled her to realize that she was keeping this secret\nfrom one who was already very dear to her. She knew that she ought to\ntell Lester about the child, but she shrank from the painful\nnecessity. Perhaps later on she might find the courage to do it.\n\n\"I'll have to tell him something,\" she thought with a sudden\nupwelling of feeling as regarded the seriousness of this duty. \"If I\ndon't do it soon and I should go and live with him and he should find\nit out he would never forgive me. He might turn me out, and then where\nwould I go? I have no home now. What would I do with Vesta?\"\n\nShe turned to contemplate him, a premonitory wave of terror\nsweeping over her, but she only saw that imposing and comfort-loving\nsoul quietly reading his letters, his smoothly shaved red cheek and\ncomfortable head and body looking anything but militant or like an\navenging Nemesis. She was just withdrawing her gaze when he looked\nup.\n\n\"Well, have you washed all your sins away?\" he inquired\nmerrily.\n\nShe smiled faintly at the allusion. The touch of fact in it made it\nslightly piquant.\n\n\"I expect so,\" she replied.\n\nHe turned to some other topic, while she looked out of the window,\nthe realization that one impulse to tell him had proved unavailing\ndwelling in her mind. \"I'll have to do it shortly,\" she thought, and\nconsoled herself with the idea that she would surely find courage\nbefore long.\n\nTheir arrival in New York the next day raised the important\nquestion in Lester's mind as to where he should stop. New York was a\nvery large place, and he was not in much danger of encountering people\nwho would know him, but he thought it just as well not to take\nchances. Accordingly he had the cabman drive them to one of the more\nexclusive apartment hotels, where he engaged a suite of rooms; and\nthey settled themselves for a stay of two or three weeks.\n\nThis atmosphere into which Jennie was now plunged was so wonderful,\nso illuminating, that she could scarcely believe this was the same\nworld that she had inhabited before. Kane was no lover of vulgar\ndisplay. The appointments with which he surrounded himself were always\nsimple and elegant. He knew at a glance what Jennie needed, and bought\nfor her with discrimination and care. And Jennie, a woman, took a keen\npleasure in the handsome gowns and pretty fripperies that he lavished\nupon her. Could this be really Jennie Gerhardt, the washerwoman's\ndaughter, she asked herself, as she gazed in her mirror at the figure\nof a girl clad in blue velvet, with yellow French lace at her throat\nand upon her arms? Could these be her feet, clad in soft shapely shoes\nat ten dollars a pair, these her hands adorned with flashing jewels?\nWhat wonderful good fortune she was enjoying! And Lester had promised\nthat her mother would share in it. Tears sprang to her eyes at the\nthought. The dear mother, how she loved her!\n\nIt was Lester's pleasure in these days to see what he could do to\nmake her look like some one truly worthy of im. He exercised his most\ncareful judgment, and the result surprised even himself. People turned\nin the halls, in the dining-rooms, and on the street to gaze at\nJennie.\n\n\"A stunning woman that man has with him,\" was a frequent\ncomment.\n\nDespite her altered state Jennie did not lose her judgment of life\nor her sense of perspective or proportion. She felt as though life\nwere tentatively loaning her something which would be taken away after\na time. There was no pretty vanity in her bosom. Lester realized this\nas he watched her. \"You're a big woman, in your way,\" he said. \"You'll\namount to something. Life hasn't given you much of a deal up to\nnow.\"\n\nHe wondered how he could justify this new relationship to his\nfamily, should they chance to hear about it. If he should decide to\ntake a home in Chicago or St. Louis (there was such a thought running\nin his mind) could he maintain it secretly? Did he want to? He was\nhalf persuaded that he really, truly loved her.\n\nAs the time drew near for their return he began to counsel her as\nto her future course of action. \"You ought to find some way of\nintroducing me, as an acquaintance, to your father,\" he said. \"It will\nease matters up. I think I'll call. Then if you tell him you're going\nto marry me he'll think nothing of it.\" Jennie thought of Vesta, and\ntrembled inwardly. But perhaps her father could be induced to remain\nsilent.\n\nLester had made the wise suggestion that she should retain the\nclothes she had worn in Cleveland in order that she might wear them\nhome when she reached there. \"There won't be any trouble about this\nother stuff,\" he said. \"I'll have it cared for until we make some\nother arrangement.\" It was all very simple and easy; he was a master\nstrategist.\n\nJennie had written her mother almost daily since she had been East.\nShe had inclosed little separate notes to be read by Mrs. Gerhardt\nonly. In one she explained Lester's desire to call, and urged her\nmother to prepare the way by telling her father that she had met some\none who liked her. She spoke of the difficulty concerning Vesta, and\nher mother at once began to plan a campaign o have Gerhardt hold his\npeace. There must be no hitch now. Jennie must be given an opportunity\nto better herself. When she returned there was great rejoicing. Of\ncourse she could not go back to her work, but Mrs. Gerhardt explained\nthat Mrs. Bracebridge had given Jennie a few weeks' vacation in order\nthat she might look for something better, something at which he could\nmake more money.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIV\n\n\nThe problem of the Gerhardt family and its relationship to himself\ncomparatively settled, Kane betook himself to Cincinnati and to his\nbusiness duties. He was heartily interested in the immense plant,\nwhich occupied two whole blocks in the outskirts of the city, and its\nconduct and development was as much a problem and a pleasure to him as\nto either his father or his brother. He liked to feel that he was a\nvital part of this great and growing industry. When he saw freight\ncars going by on the railroads labelled \"The Kane Manufacturing\nCompany--Cincinnati\" or chanced to notice displays of the\ncompany's products in the windows of carriage sales companies in the\ndifferent cities he was conscious of a warm glow of satisfaction. It\nwas something to be a factor in an institution so stable, so\ndistinguished, so honestly worth while. This was all very well, but\nnow Kane was entering upon a new phase of his personal\nexistence--in a word, there was Jennie. He was conscious as he\nrode toward his home city that he was entering on a relationship which\nmight involve disagreeable consequences. He was a little afraid of his\nfather's attitude; above all, there was his brother Robert.\n\nRobert was cold and conventional in character; an excellent\nbusiness man; irreproachable in both his public and in his private\nlife. Never overstepping the strict boundaries of legal righteousness,\nhe was neither warm-hearted nor generous--in fact, he would turn\nany trick which could be speciously, or at best necessitously,\nrecommended to his conscience. How he reasoned Lester did not\nknow--he could not follow the ramifications of a logic which\ncould combine hard business tactics with moral rigidity, but somehow\nhis brother managed to do it. \"He's got a Scotch Presbyterian\nconscience mixed with an Asiatic perception of the main chance.\"\nLester once told somebody, and he had the situation accurately\nmeasured. Nevertheless he could not rout his brother from his\npositions nor defy him, for he had the public conscience with him. He\nwas in line with convention practically, and perhaps\nsophisticatedly.\n\nThe two brothers were outwardly friendly; inwardly they were far\napart. Robert liked Lester well enough personally, but he did not\ntrust his financial judgment, and, temperamentally, they did not agree\nas to how life and its affairs should be conducted. Lester had a\nsecret contempt for his brother's chill, persistent chase of the\nalmighty dollar. Robert was sure that Lester's easy-going ways were\nreprehensible, and bound to create trouble sooner or later. In the\nbusiness they did not quarrel much--there was not so much chance\nwith the old gentleman still in charge--but there were certain\nminor differences constantly cropping up which showed which way the\nwind blew. Lester was for building up trade through friendly\nrelationship, concessions, personal contact, and favors. Robert was\nfor pulling everything tight, cutting down the cost of production, and\noffering such financial inducements as would throttle competition.\n\nThe old manufacturer always did his best to pour oil on these\ntroubled waters, but he foresaw an eventual clash. One or the other\nwould have to get out or perhaps both. \"If only you two boys could\nagree!\" he used to say.\n\nAnother thing which disturbed Lester was his father's attitude on\nthe subject of marriage--Lester's marriage, to be specific.\nArchibald Kane never ceased to insist on the fact that Lester ought to\nget married, and that he was making a big mistake in putting it off.\nAll the other children, save Louise, were safely married. Why not his\nfavorite son? It was doing him injury morally, socially, commercially,\nthat he was sure of.\n\n\"The world expects it of a man in your position,\" his father had\nargued from time to time. \"It makes for social solidity and prestige.\nYou ought to pick out a good woman and raise a family. Where will you\nbe when you get to my time of life if you haven't any children, any\nhome?\"\n\n\"Well, if the right woman came along,\" said Lester, \"I suppose I'd\nmarry her. But she hasn't come along. What do you want me to do? Take\nanybody?\"\n\n\"No, not anybody, of course, but there are lots of good women. You\ncan surely find some one if you try. There's that Pace girl. What\nabout her? You used to like her. I wouldn't drift on this way, Lester;\nit can't come to any good.\"\n\nHis son would only smile. \"There, father, let it go now. I'll come\naround some time, no doubt. I've got to be thirsty when I'm led to\nwater.\"\n\nThe old gentleman gave over, time and again, but it was a sore\npoint with him. He wanted his son to settle down and be a real man of\naffairs.\n\nThe fact that such a situation as this might militate against any\npermanent arrangement with Jennie was obvious even to Lester at this\ntime. He thought out his course of action carefully. Of course he\nwould not give Jennie up, whatever the possible consequences. But he\nmust be cautious; he must take no unnecessary risks. Could he bring\nher to Cincinnati? What a scandal if it were ever found out! Could he\ninstall her in a nice home somewhere near the city? The family would\nprobably eventually suspect something. Could he take her along on his\nnumerous business journeys? This first one to New York had been\nsuccessful. Would it always be so? He turned the question over in his\nmind.\n\nThe very difficulty gave it zest. Perhaps St. Louis, or Pittsburg,\nor Chicago would be best after all. He went to these places\nfrequently, and particularly to Chicago. He decided finally that it\nshould be Chicago if he could arrange it. He could always make excuses\nto run up there, and it was only a night's ride. Yes, Chicago was\nbest. The very size and activity of the city made concealment easy.\nAfter two weeks' stay at Cincinnati Lester wrote Jennie that he was\ncoming to Cleveland soon, and she answered that she thought it would\nbe all right for him to call and see her. Her father had been told\nabout him. She had felt it unwise to stay about the house, and so had\nsecured a position in a store at four dollars a week. He smiled as he\nthought of her working, and yet the decency and energy of it appealed\nto him. \"She's all right,\" he said. \"She's the best I've come across\nyet.\"\n\nHe ran up to Cleveland the following Saturday, and, calling at her\nplace of business, he made an appointment to see her that evening. He\nwas anxious that his introduction, as her beau, should be gotten over\nwith as quickly as possible. When he did call the shabbiness of the\nhouse and the manifest poverty of the family rather disgusted him, but\nsomehow Jennie seemed as sweet to him as ever. Gerhardt came in the\nfront-room, after he had been there a few minutes, and shook hands\nwith him, as did also Mrs. Gerhardt, but Lester paid little attention\nto them. The old German appeared to him to be merely\ncommonplace--the sort of man who was hired by hundreds in common\ncapacities in his father's factory. After some desultory conversation\nLester suggested to Jennie that they should go for a drive. Jennie put\non her hat, and together they departed. As a matter of fact, they went\nto an apartment which he had hired for the storage of her clothes.\nWhen she returned at eight in the evening the family considered it\nnothing amiss.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXV\n\n\nA month later Jennie was able to announce that Lester intended to\nmarry her. His visits had of course paved the way for this, and it\nseemed natural enough. Only Gerhardt seemed a little doubtful. He did\nnot know just how this might be. Perhaps it was all right. Lester\nseemed a fine enough man in all conscience, and really, after Brander,\nwhy not? If a United States Senator could fall in love with Jennie,\nwhy not a business man? There was just one thing--the child. \"Has\nshe told him about Vesta?\" he asked his wife.\n\n\"No,\" said Mrs. Gerhardt, \"not yet.\"\n\n\"Not yet, not yet. Always something underhanded. Do you think he\nwants her if he knows? That's what comes of such conduct in the first\nplace. Now she has to slip around like a thief. The child cannot even\nhave an honest name.\"\n\nGerhardt went back to his newspaper reading and brooding. His life\nseemed a complete failure to him and he was only waiting to get well\nenough to hunt up another job as watchman. He wanted to get out of\nthis mess of deception and dishonesty.\n\nA week or two later Jennie confided to her mother that Lester had\nwritten her to join him in Chicago. He was not feeling well, and could\nnot come to Cleveland. The two women explained to Gerhardt that Jennie\nwas going away to be married to Mr. Kane. Gerhardt flared up at this,\nand his suspicions were again aroused. But he could do nothing but\ngrumble over the situation; it would lead to no good end, of that he\nwas sure.\n\nWhen the day came for Jennie's departure she had to go without\nsaying farewell to her father. He was out looking for work until late\nin the afternoon, and before he had returned she had been obliged to\nleave for the station. \"I will write a note to him when I get there,\"\nshe said. She kissed her baby over and over. \"Lester will take a\nbetter house for us soon,\" she went on hopefully. \"He wants us to\nmove.\" The night train bore her to Chicago; the old life had ended and\nthe new one had begun.\n\nThe curious fact should be recorded here that, although Lester's\ngenerosity had relieved the stress upon the family finances, the\nchildren and Gerhardt were actually none the wiser. It was easy for\nMrs. Gerhardt to deceive her husband as to the purchase of necessities\nand she had not as yet indulged in any of the fancies which an\nenlarged purse permitted. Fear deterred her. But, after Jennie had\nbeen in Chicago for a few days, she wrote to her mother saying that\nLester wanted them to take a new home. This letter was shown to\nGerhardt, who had been merely biding her return to make a scene. He\nfrowned, but somehow it seemed an evidence of regularity. If he had\nnot married her why should he want to help them? Perhaps Jennie was\nwell married after all. Perhaps she really had been lifted to a high\nstation in life, and was now able to help the family. Gerhardt almost\nconcluded to forgive her everything once and for all.\n\nThe end of it was that a new house was decided upon, and Jennie\nreturned to Cleveland to help her mother move. Together they searched\nthe streets for a nice, quiet neighborhood, and finally found one. A\nhouse of nine rooms, with a yard, which rented for thirty dollars, was\nsecured and suitably furnished. There were comfortable fittings for\nthe dining-room and sitting-room, a handsome parlor set and bedroom\nsets complete for each room. The kitchen was supplied with every\nconvenience, and there was even a bath-room, a luxury the Gerhardts\nhad never enjoyed before. Altogether the house was attractive, though\nplain, and Jennie was happy to know that her family could be\ncomfortable in it.\n\nWhen the time came for the actual moving Mrs. Gerhardt was fairly\nbeside herself with joy, for was not this the realization of her\ndreams? All through the long years of her life she had been waiting,\nand now it had come. A new house, new furniture, plenty of\nroom--things finer than she had ever even imagined--think of\nit! Her eyes shone as she looked at the new beds and tables and\nbureaus and whatnots. \"Dear, dear, isn't this nice!\" she exclaimed.\n\"Isn't it beautiful!\" Jennie smiled and tried to pretend satisfaction\nwithout emotion, but there were tears in her eyes. She was so glad for\nher mother's sake. She could have kissed Lester's feet for his\ngoodness to her family.\n\nThe day the furniture was moved in Mrs. Gerhardt, Martha, and\nVeronica were on hand to clean and arrange things. At the sight of the\nlarge rooms and pretty yard, bare enough in winter, but giving promise\nof a delightful greenness in spring, and the array of new furniture\nstanding about in excelsior, the whole family fell into a fever of\ndelight. Such beauty, such spaciousness! George rubbed his feet over\nthe new carpets and Bass examined the quality of the furniture\ncritically. \"Swell,\" was his comment. Mrs. Gerhardt roved to and fro\nlike a person in a dream. She could not believe that these bright\nbedrooms, this beautiful parlor, this handsome dining-room were\nactually hers.\n\nGerhardt came last of all. Although he tried hard not to show it,\nhe, too, could scarcely refrain from enthusiastic comment. The sight\nof an opal-globed chandelier over the dining-room table was the\nfinishing touch.\n\n\"Gas, yet!\" he said.\n\nHe looked grimly around, under his shaggy eyebrows, at the new\ncarpets under his feet, the long oak extension table covered with a\nwhite cloth and set with new dishes, at the pictures on the walls, the\nbright, clean kitchen. He shook his head. \"By chops, it's fine!\" he\nsaid. \"It's very nice. Yes, it's very nice. We want to be careful now\nnot to break anything. It's so easy to scratch things up, and then\nit's all over.\" Yes, even Gerhardt was satisfied.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVI\n\n\nIt would be useless to chronicle the events of the three years that\nfollowed--events and experiences by which the family grew from an\nabject condition of want to a state of comparative self-reliance,\nbased, of course, on the obvious prosperity of Jennie and the\ngenerosity (through her) of her distant husband. Lester was seen now\nand then, a significant figure, visiting Cleveland, and sometimes\ncoming out to the house where he occupied with Jennie the two best\nrooms of the second floor. There were hurried trips on her\npart--in answer to telegraph massages--to Chicago, to St.\nLouis, to New York. One of his favorite pastimes was to engage\nquarters at the great resorts--Hot Springs, Mt. Clemens,\nSaratoga--and for a period of a week or two at a stretch enjoy\nthe luxury of living with Jennie as his wife. There were other times\nwhen he would pass through Cleveland only for the privilege of seeing\nher for a day. All the time he was aware that he was throwing on her\nthe real burden of a rather difficult situation, but he did not see\nhow he could remedy it at this time. He was not sure as yet that he\nreally wanted to. They were getting along fairly well.\n\nThe attitude of the Gerhardt family toward this condition of\naffairs was peculiar. At first, in spite of the irregularity of it, it\nseemed natural enough. Jennie said she was married. No one had seen\nher marriage certificate, but she said so, and she seemed to carry\nherself with the air of one who holds that relationship. Still, she\nnever went to Cincinnati, where his family lived, and none of his\nrelatives ever came near her. Then, too, his attitude, in spite of the\nmoney which had first blinded them, was peculiar. He really did not\ncarry himself like a married man. He was so indifferent. There were\nweeks in which she appeared to receive only perfunctory notes. There\nwere times when she would only go away for a few days to meet him.\nThen there were the long periods in which she absented\nherself--the only worthwhile testimony toward a real\nrelationship, and that, in a way, unnatural.\n\nBass, who had grown to be a young man of twenty-five, with some\nbusiness judgment and a desire to get out in the world, was\nsuspicious. He had come to have a pretty keen knowledge of life, and\nintuitively he felt that things were not right. George, nineteen, who\nhad gained a slight foothold in a wall-paper factory and was looking\nforward to a career in that field, was also restless. He felt that\nsomething was wrong. Martha, seventeen, was still in school, as were\nWilliam and Veronica. Each was offered an opportunity to study\nindefinitely; but there was unrest with life. They knew about Jennie's\nchild. The neighbors were obviously drawing conclusions for\nthemselves. They had few friends. Gerhardt himself finally concluded\nthat there was something wrong, but he had let himself into this\nsituation, and was not in much of a position now to raise an argument.\nHe wanted to ask her at times--proposed to make her do better if\nhe could--but the worst had already been done. It depended on the\nman now, he knew that.\n\nThings were gradually nearing a state where a general upheaval\nwould have taken place had not life stepped in with one of its\nfortuitous solutions. Mrs. Gerhardt's health failed. Although stout\nand formerly of a fairly active disposition, she had of late years\nbecome decidedly sedentary in her habits and grown weak, which,\ncoupled with a mind naturally given to worry, and weighed upon as it\nhad been by a number of serious and disturbing ills, seemed now to\nculminate in a slow but very certain case of systemic poisoning. She\nbecame decidedly sluggish in her motions, wearied more quickly at the\nfew tasks left for her to do, and finally complained to Jennie that it\nwas very hard for her to climb stairs. \"I'm not feeling well,\" she\nsaid. \"I think I'm going to be sick.\"\n\nJennie now took alarm and proposed to take her to some near-by\nwatering-place, but Mrs. Gerhardt wouldn't go. \"I don't think it would\ndo any good,\" she said. She sat about or went driving with her\ndaughter, but the fading autumn scenery depressed her. \"I don't like\nto get sick in the fall,\" she said. \"The leaves coming down make me\nthink I am never going to get well.\"\n\n\"Oh, ma, how you talk!\" said Jennie; but she felt frightened,\nnevertheless.\n\nHow much the average home depends upon the mother was seen when it\nwas feared the end was near. Bass, who had thought of getting married\nand getting out of this atmosphere, abandoned the idea temporarily.\nGerhardt, shocked and greatly depressed, hung about like one expectant\nof and greatly awed by the possibility of disaster. Jennie, too\ninexperienced in death to feel that she could possibly lose her\nmother, felt as if somehow her living depended on her. Hoping in spite\nof all opposing circumstances, she hung about, a white figure of\npatience, waiting and serving.\n\nThe end came one morning after a month of illness and several days\nof unconsciousness, during which silence reigned in the house and all\nthe family went about on tiptoe. Mrs. Gerhardt passed away with her\ndying gaze fastened on Jennie's face for the last few minutes of\nconsciousness that life vouchsafed her. Jennie stared into her eyes\nwith a yearning horror. \"Oh, mamma! mamma!\" she cried. \"Oh no,\nno!\"\n\nGerhardt came running in from the yard, and, throwing himself down\nby the bedside, wrung his bony hands in anguish. \"I should have gone\nfirst!\" he cried. \"I should have gone first!\"\n\nThe death of Mrs. Gerhardt hastened the final breaking up of the\nfamily. Bass was bent on getting married at once, having had a girl in\ntown for some time. Martha, whose views of life had broadened and\nhardened, was anxious to get out also. She felt that a sort of stigma\nattached to the home--to herself, in fact, so long as she\nremained there. Martha looked to the public schools as a source of\nincome; she was going to be a teacher. Gerhardt alone scarcely knew\nwhich way to turn. He was again at work as a night watchman. Jennie\nfound him crying one day alone in the kitchen, and immediately burst\ninto tears herself. \"Now, papa!\" she pleaded, \"it isn't as bad as\nthat. You will always have a home--you know that--as long as\nI have anything. You can come with me.\"\n\n\"No, no,\" he protested. He really did not want to go with her. \"It\nisn't that,\" he continued. \"My whole life comes to nothing.\"\n\nIt was some little time before Bass, George and Martha finally\nleft, but, one by one, they got out, leaving Jennie, her father,\nVeronica, and William, and one other--Jennie's child. Of course\nLester knew nothing of Vesta's parentage, and curiously enough he had\nnever seen the little girl. During the short periods in which he\ndeigned to visit the house--two or three days at most--Mrs.\nGerhardt took good care that Vesta was kept in the background. There\nwas a play-room on the top floor, and also a bedroom there, and\nconcealment was easy. Lester rarely left his rooms, he even had his\nmeals served to him in what might have been called the living-room of\nthe suite. He was not at all inquisitive or anxious to meet any one of\nthe other members of the family. He was perfectly willing to shake\nhands with them or to exchange a few perfunctory words, but\nperfunctory words only. It was generally understood that the child\nmust not appear, and so it did not.\n\nThere is an inexplicable sympathy between old age and childhood, an\naffinity which is as lovely as it is pathetic. During that first year\nin Lorrie Street, when no one was looking, Gerhardt often carried\nVesta about on his shoulders and pinched her soft, red cheeks. When\nshe got old enough to walk he it was who, with a towel fastened\nsecurely under her arms, led her patiently around the room until she\nwas able to take a few steps of her own accord. When she actually\nreached the point where she could walk he was the one who coaxed her\nto the effort, shyly, grimly, but always lovingly. By some strange\nleading of fate this stigma on his family's honor, this blotch on\nconventional morality, had twined its helpless baby fingers about the\ntendons of his heart. He loved this little outcast ardently,\nhopefully. She was the one bright ray in a narrow, gloomy life, and\nGerhardt early took upon himself the responsibility of her education\nin religious matters. Was it not he who had insisted that the infant\nshould be baptized?\n\n\"Say 'Our Father,'\" he used to demand of the lisping infant when he\nhad her alone with him.\n\n\"Ow Fowvaw,\" was her vowel-like interpretation of his words.\n\n\"'Who art in heaven.'\"\n\n\"'Ooh ah in aven,'\" repeated the child.\n\n\"Why do you teach her so early?\" pleaded Mrs. Gerhardt, overhearing\nthe little one's struggles with stubborn consonants and vowels.\n\n\"Because I want she should learn the Christian faith,\" returned\nGerhardt determinedly. \"She ought to know her prayers. If she don't\nbegin now she never will know them.\"\n\nMrs. Gerhardt smiled. Many of her husband's religious\nidiosyncrasies were amusing to her. At the same time she liked to see\nthis sympathetic interest he was taking in the child's upbringing. If\nhe were only not so hard, so narrow at times. He made himself a\ntorment to himself and to every one else.\n\nOn the earliest bright morning of returning spring he was wont to\ntake her for her first little journeys in the world. \"Come, now,\" he\nwould say, \"we will go for a little walk.\"\n\n\"Walk,\" chirped Vesta.\n\n\"Yes, walk,\" echoed Gerhardt.\n\nMrs. Gerhardt would fasten on one of her little hoods, for in these\ndays Jennie kept Vesta's wardrobe beautifully replete. Taking her by\nthe hand, Gerhardt would issue forth, satisfied to drag first one foot\nand then the other in order to accommodate his gait to her toddling\nsteps.\n\nOne beautiful May day, when Vesta was four years old, they started\non one of their walks. Everywhere nature was budding and bourgeoning;\nthe birds twittering their arrival from the south; the insects making\nthe best of their brief span of life. Sparrows chirped in the road;\nrobins strutted upon the grass; bluebirds built in the eaves of the\ncottages. Gerhardt took a keen delight in pointing out the wonders of\nnature to Vesta, and she was quick to respond. Every new sight and\nsound interested her.\n\n\"Ooh!--ooh!\" exclaimed Vesta, catching sight of a low,\nflashing touch of red as a robin lighted upon a twig nearby. Her hand\nwas up, and her eyes were wide open.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Gerhardt, as happy as if he himself had but newly\ndiscovered this marvelous creature. \"Robin. Bird. Robin. Say\nrobin.\"\n\n\"Wobin,\" said Vesta.\n\n\"Yes, robin,\" he answered. \"It is going to look for a worm now. We\nwill see if we cannot find its nest. I think I saw a nest in one of\nthese trees.\"\n\nHe plodded peacefully on, seeking to rediscover an old abandoned\nnest that he had observed on a former walk. \"Here it is,\" he said at\nlast, coming to a small and leafless tree, in which a winter-beaten\nremnant of a home was still clinging. \"Here, come now, see,\" and he\nlifted the baby up at arm's length.\n\n\"See,\" said Gerhardt, indicating the wisp of dead grasses with his\nfree hand, \"nest. That is a bird's nest. See!\"\n\n\"Ooh!\" repeated Vesta, imitating his pointing finger with one of\nher own. \"Ness--ooh!\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Gerhardt, putting her down again. \"That was a wren's\nnest. They have all gone now. They will not come any more.\"\n\nStill further they plodded, he unfolding the simple facts of life,\nshe wondering with the wide wonder of a child. When they had gone a\nblock or two he turned slowly about as if the end of the world had\nbeen reached.\n\n\"We must be going back!\" he said.\n\nAnd so she had come to her fifth year, growing in sweetness,\nintelligence, and vivacity. Gerhardt was fascinated by the questions\nshe asked, the puzzles she pronounced. \"Such a girl!\" he would exclaim\nto his wife. \"What is it she doesn't want to know? 'Where is God? What\ndoes He do? Where does He keep His feet?\" she asks me. \"I gotta laugh\nsometimes.\" From rising in the morning, to dress her to laying her\ndown at night after she had said her prayers, she came to be the chief\nsolace and comfort of his days. Without Vesta, Gerhardt would have\nfound his life hard indeed to bear.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVII\n\n\nFor three years now Lester had been happy in the companionship of\nJennie. Irregular as the connection might be in the eyes of the church\nand of society, it had brought him peace and comfort, and he was\nperfectly satisfied with the outcome of the experiment. His interest\nin the social affairs of Cincinnati was now practically nil, and he\nhad consistently refused to consider any matrimonial proposition which\nhad himself as the object. He looked on his father's business\norganization as offering a real chance for himself if he could get\ncontrol of it; but he saw no way of doing so. Robert's interests were\nalways in the way, and, if anything, the two brothers were farther\napart than ever in their ideas and aims. Lester had thought once or\ntwice of entering some other line of business or of allying himself\nwith another carriage company, but he did not feel that ha could\nconscientiously do this. Lester had his salary--fifteen thousand\na year as secretary and treasurer of the company (his brother was\nvice-president)--and about five thousand from some outside\ninvestments. He had not been so lucky or so shrewd in speculation as\nRobert had been; aside from the principal which yielded his five\nthousand, he had nothing. Robert, on the other hand, was\nunquestionably worth between three and four hundred thousand dollars,\nin addition to his future interest in the business, which both\nbrothers shrewdly suspected would be divided somewhat in their favor.\nRobert and Lester would get a fourth each, they thought; their sisters\na sixth. It seemed natural that Kane senior should take this view,\nseeing that the brothers were actually in control and doing the work.\nStill, there was no certainty. The old gentleman might do anything or\nnothing. The probabilities were that he would be very fair and\nliberal. At the same time, Robert was obviously beating Lester in the\ngame of life. What did Lester intend to do about it?\n\nThere comes a time in every thinking man's life when he pauses and\n\"takes stock\" of his condition; when he asks himself how it fares with\nhis individuality as a whole, mental, moral, physical, material. This\ntime comes after the first heedless flights of youth have passed, when\nthe initiative and more powerful efforts have been made, and he begins\nto feel the uncertainty of results and final values which attaches\nitself to everything. There is a deadening thought of uselessness\nwhich creeps into many men's minds--the thought which has been\nbest expressed by the Preacher in Ecclesiastes.\n\nYet Lester strove to be philosophical. \"What difference does it\nmake?\" he used to say to himself, \"whether I live at the White House,\nor here at home, or at the Grand Pacific?\" But in the very question\nwas the implication that there were achievements in life which he had\nfailed to realize in his own career. The White House represented the\nrise and success of a great public character. His home and the Grand\nPacific were what had come to him without effort.\n\nHe decided for the time being--it was about the period of the\ndeath of Jennie's mother--that he would make some effort to\nrehabilitate himself. He would cut out idling--these numerous\ntrips with Jennie had cost him considerable time. He would make some\noutside investments. If his brother could find avenues of financial\nprofit, so could he. He would endeavor to assert his\nauthority--he would try to make himself of more importance in the\nbusiness, rather than let Robert gradually absorb everything. Should\nhe forsake Jennie?--that thought also, came to him. She had no\nclaim on him. She could make no protest. Somehow he did not see how it\ncould be done. It seemed cruel, useless; above all (though he disliked\nto admit it) it would be uncomfortable for himself. He liked\nher--loved her, perhaps, in a selfish way. He didn't see how he\ncould desert her very well.\n\nJust at this time he had a really serious difference with Robert.\nHis brother wanted to sever relations with an old and well established\npaint company in New York, which had manufactured paints especially\nfor the house, and invest in a new concern in Chicago, which was\ngrowing and had a promising future. Lester, knowing the members of the\nEastern firm, their reliability, their long and friendly relations\nwith the house, was in opposition. His father at first seemed to agree\nwith Lester. But Robert argued out the question in his cold, logical\nway, his blue eyes fixed uncompromisingly upon his brother's face. \"We\ncan't go on forever,\" he said, \"standing by old friends, just because\nfather here has dealt with them, or you like them. We must have a\nchange. The business must be stiffened up; we're going to have more\nand stronger competition.\"\n\n\"It's just as father feels about it,\" said Lester at last. \"I have\nno deep feeling in the matter. It won't hurt me one way or the other.\nYou say the house is going to profit eventually. I've stated the\narguments on the other side.\"\n\n\"I'm inclined to think Robert is right,\" said Archibald Kane\ncalmly. \"Most of the things he has suggested so far have worked\nout.\"\n\nLester colored. \"Well, we won't have any more discussion about it\nthen,\" he said. He rose and strolled out of the office.\n\nThe shock of this defeat, coming at a time when he was considering\npulling himself together, depressed Lester considerably. It wasn't\nmuch but it was a straw, and his father's remark about his brother's\nbusiness acumen was even more irritating. He was beginning to wonder\nwhether his father would discriminate in any way in the distribution\nof the property. Had he heard anything about his entanglement with\nJennie? Had he resented the long vacations he had taken from business?\nIt did not appear to Lester that he could be justly chargeable with\neither incapacity or indifference, so far as the company was\nconcerned. He had done his work well. He was still the investigator of\npropositions put up to the house, the student of contracts, the\ntrusted adviser of his father and mother--but he was being\nworsted. Where would it end? He thought about this, but could reach no\nconclusion.\n\nLater in this same year Robert came forward with a plan for\nreorganization in the executive department of the business. He\nproposed that they should build an immense exhibition and storage\nwarehouse on Michigan Avenue in Chicago, and transfer a portion of\ntheir completed stock there. Chicago was more central than Cincinnati.\nBuyers from the West and country merchants could be more easily\nreached and dealt with there. It would be a big advertisement for the\nhouse, a magnificent evidence of its standing and prosperity. Kane\nsenior and Lester immediately approved of this. Both saw its\nadvantages. Robert suggested that Lester should undertake the\nconstruction of the new buildings. It would probably be advisable for\nhim to reside in Chicago a part of the time.\n\nThe idea appealed to Lester, even though it took him away from\nCincinnati, largely if not entirely. It was dignified and not\nunrepresentative of his standing in the company. He could live in\nChicago and he could have Jennie with him. The scheme he had for\ntaking an apartment could now be arranged without difficulty. He voted\nyes. Robert smiled. \"I'm sure we'll get good results from this all\naround,\" he said.\n\nAs construction work was soon to begin, Lester decided to move to\nChicago immediately. He sent word for Jennie to meet him, and together\nthey selected an apartment on the North Side, a very comfortable suite\nof rooms on a side street near the lake, and he had it fitted up to\nsuit his taste. He figured that living in Chicago he could pose as a\nbachelor. He would never need to invite his friends to his rooms.\nThere were his offices, where he could always be found, his clubs and\nthe hotels. To his way of thinking the arrangement was practically\nideal.\n\nOf course Jennie's departure from Cleveland brought the affairs of\nthe Gerhardt family to a climax. Probably the home would be broken up,\nbut Gerhardt himself took the matter philosophically. He was an old\nman, and it did not matter much where he lived. Bass, Martha, and\nGeorge were already taking care of themselves. Veronica and William\nwere still in school, but some provision could be made for boarding\nthem with a neighbor. The one real concern of Jennie and Gerhardt was\nVesta. It was Gerhardt's natural thought that Jennie must take the\nchild with her. What else should a mother do?\n\n\"Have you told him yet?\" he asked her, when the day of her\ncontemplated departure had been set.\n\n\"No; but I'm going to soon,\" she assured him.\n\n\"Always soon,\" he said.\n\nHe shook his head. His throat swelled.\n\n\"It's too bad,\" he went on. \"It's a great sin. God will punish you,\nI'm afraid. The child needs some one. I'm getting old--otherwise\nI would keep her. There is no one here all day now to look after her\nright, as she should be.\" Again he shook his head.\n\n\"I know,\" said Jennie weakly. \"I'm going to fix it now. I'm going\nto have her live with me soon. I won't neglect her--you know\nthat.\"\n\n\"But the child's name,\" he insisted. \"She should have a name. Soon\nin another year she goes to school. People will want to know who she\nis. It can't go on forever like this.\"\n\nJennie understood well enough that it couldn't. She was crazy about\nher baby. The heaviest cross she had to bear was the constant\nseparations and the silence she was obliged to maintain about Vesta's\nvery existence. It did seem unfair to the child, and yet Jennie did\nnot see clearly how she could have acted otherwise. Vesta had good\nclothes, everything she needed. She was at least comfortable. Jennie\nhoped to give her a good education. If only she had told the truth to\nLester in the first place. Now it was almost too late, and yet she\nfelt that she had acted for the best. Finally she decided to find some\ngood woman or family in Chicago who would take charge of Vesta for a\nconsideration. In a Swedish colony to the west of La Salle Avenue she\ncame across an old lady who seemed to embody all the virtues she\nrequired--cleanliness, simplicity, honesty. She was a widow,\ndoing work by the day, but she was glad to make an arrangement by\nwhich she should give her whole time to Vesta. The latter was to go to\nkindergarten when a suitable one should be found. She was to have toys\nand kindly attention, and Mrs. Olsen was to inform Jennie of any\nchange in the child's health. Jennie proposed to call every day, and\nshe thought that sometimes, when Lester was out of town, Vesta might\nbe brought to the apartment. She had had her with her at Cleveland,\nand he had never found out anything.\n\nThe arrangements completed, Jennie returned at the first\nopportunity to Cleveland to take Vesta away. Gerhardt, who had been\nbrooding over his approaching loss, appeared most solicitous about her\nfuture. \"She should grow up to be a fine girl,\" he said. \"You should\ngive her a good education--she is so smart.\" He spoke of the\nadvisability of sending her to a Lutheran school and church, but\nJennie was not so sure of that. Time and association with Lester had\nled her to think that perhaps the public school was better than any\nprivate institution. She had no particular objection to the church,\nbut she no longer depended upon its teachings as a guide in the\naffairs of life. Why should she?\n\nThe next day it was necessary for Jennie to return to Chicago.\nVesta, excited and eager, was made ready for the journey. Gerhardt had\nbeen wandering about, restless as a lost spirit, while the process of\ndressing was going on; now that the hour had actually struck he was\ndoing his best to control his feelings. He could see that the\nfive-year-old child had no conception of what it meant to him. She was\nhappy and self-interested, chattering about the ride and the\ntrain.\n\n\"Be a good little girl,\" he said, lifting her up and kissing her.\n\"See that you study your catechism and say your prayers. And you won't\nforget the grandpa--what?--\" He tried to go on, but his\nvoice failed him.\n\nJennie, whose heart ached for her father, choked back her emotion.\n\"There,\" she said, \"if I'd thought you were going to act like\nthat--\" She stopped.\n\n\"Go,\" said Gerhardt, manfully, \"go. It is best this way.\" And he\nstood solemnly by as they went out of the door. Then he turned back to\nhis favorite haunt, the kitchen, and stood there staring at the floor.\nOne by one they were leaving him--Mrs. Gerhardt, Bass, Martha,\nJennie, Vesta. He clasped his hands together, after his old-time\nfashion, and shook his head again and again. \"So it is! So it is!\" he\nrepeated. \"They all leave me. All my life goes to pieces.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVIII\n\n\nDuring the three years in which Jennie and Lester had been\nassociated there had grown up between them a strong feeling of mutual\nsympathy and understanding. Lester truly loved her in his own way. It\nwas a strong, self-satisfying, determined kind of way, based solidly\non a big natural foundation, but rising to a plane of genuine\nspiritual affinity. The yielding sweetness of her character both\nattracted and held him. She was true, and good, and womanly to the\nvery center of her being; he had learned to trust her, to depend upon\nher, and the feeling had but deepened with the passing of the\nyears.\n\nOn her part Jennie had sincerely, deeply, truly learned to love\nthis man. At first when he had swept her off her feet, overawed her\nsoul, and used her necessity as a chain wherewith to bind her to him,\nshe was a little doubtful, a little afraid of him, although she had\nalways liked him. Now, however, by living with him, by knowing him\nbetter, by watching his moods, she had come to love him. He was so\nbig, so vocal, so handsome. His point of view and opinions of anything\nand everything were so positive. His pet motto, \"Hew to the line, let\nthe chips fall where they may,\" had clung in her brain as something\nimmensely characteristic. Apparently he was not afraid of\nanything--God, man, or devil. He used to look at her, holding her\nchin between the thumb and fingers of his big brown hand, and say:\n\"You're sweet, all right, but you need courage and defiance. You\nhaven't enough of those things.\" And her eyes would meet his in dumb\nappeal. \"Never mind,\" he would add, \"you have other things.\" And then\nhe would kiss her.\n\nOne of the most appealing things to Lester was the simple way in\nwhich she tried to avoid exposure of her various social and\neducational shortcomings. She could not write very well, and once he\nfound a list of words he had used written out on a piece of paper with\nthe meanings opposite. He smiled, but he liked her better for it.\nAnother time in the Southern hotel in St. Louis he watched her\npretending a loss of appetite because she thought that her lack of\ntable manners was being observed by nearby diners. She could not\nalways be sure of the right forks and knives, and the strange-looking\ndishes bothered her; how did one eat asparagus and artichokes?\n\n\"Why don't you eat something?\" he asked good-naturedly. \"You're\nhungry, aren't you?\"\n\n\"Not very.\"\n\n\"You must be. Listen, Jennie. I know what it is. You mustn't feel\nthat way. Your manners are all right. I wouldn't bring you here if\nthey weren't. Your instincts are all right. Don't be uneasy. I'd tell\nyou quick enough when there was anything wrong.\" His brown eyes held a\nfriendly gleam.\n\nShe smiled gratefully. \"I do feel a little nervous at times,\" she\nadmitted.\n\n\"Don't,\" he repeated. \"You're all right. Don't worry. I'll show\nyou.\" And he did.\n\nBy degrees Jennie grew into an understanding of the usages and\ncustoms of comfortable existence. All that the Gerhardt family had\never had were the bare necessities of life. Now she was surrounded\nwith whatever she wanted--trunks, clothes, toilet articles, the\nwhole varied equipment of comfort--and while she liked it all, it\ndid not upset her sense of proportion and her sense of the fitness of\nthings. There was no element of vanity in her, only a sense of joy in\nprivilege and opportunity. She was grateful to Lester for all that he\nhad done and was doing for her. If only she could hold\nhim--always!\n\nThe details of getting Vesta established once adjusted, Jennie\nsettled down into the routine of home life. Lester, busy about his\nmultitudinous affairs, was in and out. He had a suite of rooms\nreserved for himself at the Grand Pacific, which was then the\nexclusive hotel of Chicago, and this was his ostensible residence. His\nluncheon and evening appointments were kept at the Union Club. An\nearly patron of the telephone, he had one installed in the apartment,\nso that he could reach Jennie quickly and at any time. He was home two\nor three nights a week, sometimes oftener. He insisted at first on\nJennie having a girl of general housework, but acquiesced in the more\nsensible arrangement which she suggested later of letting some one\ncome in to do the cleaning. She liked to work around her own home. Her\nnatural industry and love of order prompted this feeling.\n\nLester liked his breakfast promptly at eight in the morning. He\nwanted dinner served nicely at seven. Silverware, cut glass, imported\nchina--all the little luxuries of life appealed to him. He kept\nhis trunks and wardrobe at the apartment.\n\nDuring the first few months everything went smoothly. He was in the\nhabit of taking Jennie to the theater now and then, and if he chanced\nto run across an acquaintance he always introduced her as Miss\nGerhardt. When he registered her as his wife it was usually under an\nassumed name; where there was no danger of detection he did not mind\nusing his own signature. Thus far there had been no difficulty or\nunpleasantness of any kind.\n\nThe trouble with this situation was that it was criss-crossed with\nthe danger and consequent worry which the deception in regard to Vesta\nhad entailed, as well as with Jennie's natural anxiety about her\nfather and the disorganized home. Jennie feared, as Veronica hinted,\nthat she and William would go to live with Martha, who was installed\nin a boarding-house in Cleveland, and that Gerhardt would be left\nalone. He was such a pathetic figure to her, with his injured hands\nand his one ability--that of being a watchman--that she was\nhurt to think of his being left alone. Would he come to her? She knew\nthat he would not--feeling as he did at present. Would Lester\nhave him--she was not sure of that. If he came Vesta would have\nto be accounted for. So she worried.\n\nThe situation in regard to Vesta was really complicated. Owing to\nthe feeling that she was doing her daughter a great injustice, Jennie\nwas particularly sensitive in regard to her, anxious to do a thousand\nthings to make up for the one great duty that she could not perform.\nShe daily paid a visit to the home of Mrs. Olsen, always taking with\nher toys, candy, or whatever came into her mind as being likely to\ninterest and please the child. She liked to sit with Vesta and tell\nher stories of fairy and giant, which kept the little girl wide-eyed.\nAt last she went so far as to bring her to the apartment, when Lester\nwas away visiting his parents, and she soon found it possible, during\nhis several absences, to do this regularly. After that, as time went\non and she began to know his habits, she became more\nbold--although bold is scarcely the word to use in connection\nwith Jennie. She became venturesome much as a mouse might; she would\nrisk Vesta's presence on the assurance of even short\nabsences--two or three days. She even got into the habit of\nkeeping a few of Vesta's toys at the apartment, so that she could have\nsomething to play with when she came.\n\nDuring these several visits from her child Jennie could not but\nrealize the lovely thing life would be were she only an honored wife\nand a happy mother. Vesta was a most observant little girl. She could\nby her innocent childish questions give a hundred turns to the dagger\nof self-reproach which was already planted deeply in Jennie's\nheart.\n\n\"Can I come to live with you?\" was one of her simplest and most\nfrequently repeated questions. Jennie would reply that mamma could not\nhave her just yet, but that very soon now, just as soon as she\npossibly could, Vesta should come to stay always.\n\n\"Don't you know just when?\" Vesta would ask.\n\n\"No, dearest, not just when. Very soon now. You won't mind waiting\na little while. Don't you like Mrs. Olsen?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Vesta; \"but then she ain't got any nice things now.\nShe's just got old things.\" And Jennie, stricken to the heart, would\ntake Vesta to the toy shop, and load her down with a new assortment of\nplaythings.\n\nOf course Lester was not in the least suspicious. His observation\nof things relating to the home were rather casual. He went about his\nwork and his pleasures believing Jennie to be the soul of sincerity\nand good-natured service, and it never occurred to him that there was\nanything underhanded in her actions. Once he did come home sick in the\nafternoon and found her absent--an absence which endured from two\no'clock to five. He was a little irritated and grumbled on her return,\nbut his annoyance was as nothing to her astonishment and fright when\nshe found him there. She blanched at the thought of his suspecting\nsomething, and explained as best she could. She had gone to see her\nwasherwoman. She was slow about her marketing. She didn't dream he was\nthere. She was sorry, too, that her absence had lost her an\nopportunity to serve him. It showed her what a mess she was likely to\nmake of it all.\n\nIt happened that about three weeks after the above occurrence\nLester had occasion to return to Cincinnati for a week, and during\nthis time Jennie again brought Vesta to the flat; for four days there\nwas the happiest goings on between the mother and child.\n\nNothing would have come of this little reunion had it not been for\nan oversight on Jennie's part, the far-reaching effects of which she\ncould only afterward regret. This was the leaving of a little toy lamb\nunder the large leather divan in the front room, where Lester was wont\nto lie and smoke. A little bell held by a thread of blue ribbon was\nfastened about its neck, and this tinkled feebly whenever it was\nshaken. Vesta, with the unaccountable freakishness of children had\ndeliberately dropped it behind the divan, an action which Jennie did\nnot notice at the time. When she gathered up the various playthings\nafter Vesta's departure she overlooked it entirely, and there it\nrested, its innocent eyes still staring upon the sunlit regions of\ntoyland, when Lester returned.\n\nThat same evening, when he was lying on the divan, quietly enjoying\nhis cigar and his newspaper, he chanced to drop the former, fully\nlighted. Wishing to recover it before it should do any damage, he\nleaned over and looked under the divan. The cigar was not in sight, so\nhe rose and pulled the lounge out, a move which revealed to him the\nlittle lamb still standing where Vesta had dropped it. He picked it\nup, turning it over and over, and wondering how it had come there.\n\nA lamb! It must belong to some neighbor's child in whom Jennie had\ntaken an interest, he thought. He would have to go and tease her about\nthis.\n\nAccordingly he held the toy jovially before him, and, coming out\ninto the dining-room, where Jennie was working at the sideboard, he\nexclaimed in a mock solemn voice, \"Where did this come from?\"\n\nJennie, who was totally unconscious of the existence of this\nevidence of her duplicity, turned, and was instantly possessed with\nthe idea that he had suspected all and was about to visit his just\nwrath upon her. Instantly the blood flamed in her cheeks and as\nquickly left them.\n\n\"Why, why!\" she stuttered, \"it's a little toy I bought.\"\n\n\"I see it is,\" he returned genially, her guilty tremor not escaping\nhis observation, but having at the same time no explicable\nsignificance to him. \"It's frisking around a mighty lone\nsheepfold.\"\n\nHe touched the little bell at its throat, while Jennie stood there,\nunable to speak. It tinkled feebly, and then he looked at her again.\nHis manner was so humorous that she could tell he suspected nothing.\nHowever, it was almost impossible for her to recover her\nself-possession.\n\n\"What's ailing you?\" he asked.\n\n\"Nothing,\" she replied.\n\n\"You look as though a lamb was a terrible shock to you.\"\n\n\"I forgot to take it out from there, that was all,\" she went on\nblindly.\n\n\"It looks as though it has been played with enough,\" he added more\nseriously, and then seeing that the discussion was evidently painful\nto her, he dropped it. The lamb had not furnished him the amusement\nthat he had expected.\n\nLester went back into the front room, stretched himself out and\nthought it over. Why was she nervous? What was there about a toy to\nmake her grow pale? Surely there was no harm in her harboring some\nyoungster of the neighborhood when she was alone--having it come\nin and play. Why should she be so nervous? He thought it over, but\ncould come to no conclusion.\n\nNothing more was said about the incident of the toy lamb. Time\nmight have wholly effaced the impression from Lester's memory had\nnothing else intervened to arouse his suspicions; but a mishap of any\nkind seems invariably to be linked with others which follow close upon\nits heels.\n\nOne evening when Lester happened to be lingering about the flat\nlater than usual the door bell rang, and, Jennie being busy in the\nkitchen, Lester went himself to open the door. He was greeted by a\nmiddle-aged lady, who frowned very nervously upon him, and inquired in\nbroken Swedish accents for Jennie.\n\n\"Wait a moment,\" said Lester; and stepping to the rear door he\ncalled her.\n\nJennie came, and seeing who the visitor was, she stepped nervously\nout in the hall and closed the door after her. The action instantly\nstruck Lester as suspicious. He frowned and determined to inquire\nthoroughly into the matter. A moment later Jennie reappeared. Her face\nwas white and her fingers seemed to be nervously seeking something to\nseize upon.\n\n\"What's the trouble?\" he inquired, the irritation he had felt the\nmoment before giving his voice a touch of gruffness.\n\n\"I've got to go out for a little while,\" she at last managed to\nreply.\n\n\"Very well,\" he assented unwillingly. \"But you can tell me what's\nthe trouble with you, can't you? Where do you have to go?\"\n\n\"I--I,\" began Jennie, stammering. \"I--have--\"\n\n\"Yes,\" he said grimly.\n\n\"I have to go on an errand,\" she stumbled on. \"I--I can't\nwait. I'll tell you when I come back, Lester. Please don't ask me\nnow.\"\n\nShe looked vainly at him, her troubled countenance still marked by\npreoccupation and anxiety to get away, and Lester, who had never seen\nthis look of intense responsibility in her before, was moved and\nirritated by it.\n\n\"That's all right,\" he said, \"but what's the use of all this\nsecrecy? Why can't you come out and tell what's the matter with you?\nWhat's the use of this whispering behind doors? Where do you have to\ngo?\"\n\nHe paused, checked by his own harshness, and Jennie, who was\nintensely wrought up by the information she had received, as well as\nthe unwonted verbal castigation she was now enduring, rose to an\nemotional state never reached by her before.\n\n\"I will, Lester, I will,\" she exclaimed. \"Only not now. I haven't\ntime. I'll tell you everything when I come back. Please don't stop me\nnow.\"\n\nShe hurried to the adjoining chamber to get her wraps, and Lester,\nwho had even yet no clear conception of what it all meant, followed\nher stubbornly to the door.\n\n\"See here,\" he exclaimed in his vigorous, brutal way, \"you're not\nacting right. What's the matter with you? I want to know.\"\n\nHe stood in the doorway, his whole frame exhibiting the pugnacity\nand settled determination of a man who is bound to be obeyed. Jennie,\ntroubled and driven to bay, turned at last.\n\n\"It's my child, Lester,\" she exclaimed. \"It's dying. I haven't time\nto talk. Oh, please don't stop me. I'll tell you everything when I\ncome back.\"\n\n\"Your child!\" he exclaimed. \"What the hell are you talking\nabout?\"\n\n\"I couldn't help it,\" she returned. \"I was afraid--I should\nhave told you long ago. I meant to only--only--Oh, let me go\nnow, and I'll tell you all when I come back!\"\n\nHe stared at her in amazement; then he stepped aside, unwilling to\nforce her any further for the present. \"Well, go ahead,\" he said\nquietly. \"Don't you want some one to go along with you?\"\n\n\"No,\" she replied. \"Mrs. Olsen is right here. I'll go with\nher.\"\n\nShe hurried forth, white-faced, and he stood there, pondering.\nCould this be the woman he had thought he knew? Why, she had been\ndeceiving him for years. Jennie! The white-faced! The simple!\n\nHe choked a little as he muttered:\n\n\"Well, I'll be damned!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIX\n\n\nThe reason why Jennie had been called was nothing more than one of\nthose infantile seizures the coming and result of which no man can\npredict two hours beforehand. Vesta had been seriously taken with\nmembranous croup only a few hours before, and the development since\nhad been so rapid that the poor old Swedish mother was half frightened\nto death herself, and hastily despatched a neighbor to say that Vesta\nwas very ill and Mrs. Kane was to come at once. This message,\ndelivered as it was in a very nervous manner by one whose only object\nwas to bring her, had induced the soul-racking fear of death in Jennie\nand caused her to brave the discovery of Lester in the manner\ndescribed. Jennie hurried on anxiously, her one thought being to reach\nher child before the arm of death could interfere and snatch it from\nher, her mind weighed upon by a legion of fears. What if it should\nalready be too late when she got there; what if Vesta already should\nbe no more. Instinctively she quickened her pace and as the street\nlamps came and receded in the gloom she forgot all the sting of\nLester's words, all fear that he might turn her out and leave her\nalone in a great city with a little child to care for, and remembered\nonly the fact that her Vesta was very ill, possibly dying, and that\nshe was the direct cause of the child's absence from her; that perhaps\nbut for the want of her care and attention Vesta might be well\nto-night.\n\n\"If I can only get there,\" she kept saying to herself; and then,\nwith that frantic unreason which is the chief characteristic of the\ninstinct-driven mother: \"I might have known that God would punish me\nfor my unnatural conduct. I might have known--I might have\nknown.\"\n\nWhen she reached the gate she fairly sped up the little walk and\ninto the house, where Vesta was lying pale, quiet, and weak, but\nconsiderably better. Several Swedish neighbors and a middle-aged\nphysician were in attendance, all of whom looked at her curiously as\nshe dropped beside the child's bed and spoke to her.\n\nJennie's mind had been made up. She had sinned, and sinned\ngrievously, against her daughter, but now she would make amends so far\nas possible. Lester was very dear to her, but she would no longer\nattempt to deceive him in anything, even if he left her--she felt\nan agonized stab, a pain at the thought--she must still do the\none right thing. Vesta must not be an outcast any longer. Her mother\nmust give her a home. Where Jennie was, there must Vesta be.\n\nSitting by the bedside in this humble Swedish cottage, Jennie\nrealized the fruitlessness of her deception, the trouble and pain it\nhad created in her home, the months of suffering it had given her with\nLester, the agony it had heaped upon her this night--and to what\nend? The truth had been discovered anyhow. She sat there and\nmeditated, not knowing what next was to happen, while Vesta quieted\ndown, and then went soundly to sleep.\n\nLester, after recovering from the first heavy import of this\ndiscovery, asked himself some perfectly natural questions. \"Who was\nthe father of the child? How old was it? How did it chance to be in\nChicago, and who was taking care of it?\" He could ask, but he could\nnot answer; he knew absolutely nothing.\n\nCuriously, now, as he thought, his first meeting with Jennie at\nMrs. Bracebridge's came back to him. What was it about her then that\nhad attracted him? What made him think, after a few hours'\nobservation, that he could seduce her to do his will? What was\nit--moral looseness, or weakness, or what? There must have been\nart in the sorry affair, the practised art of the cheat, and, in\ndeceiving such a confiding nature as his, she had done even more than\npractise deception--she had been ungrateful.\n\nNow the quality of ingratitude was a very objectionable thing to\nLester--the last and most offensive trait of a debased nature,\nand to be able to discover a trace of it in Jennie was very\ndisturbing. It is true that she had not exhibited it in any other way\nbefore--quite to the contrary--but nevertheless he saw\nstrong evidences of it now, and it made him very bitter in his feeling\ntoward her. How could she be guilty of any such conduct toward him?\nHad he not picked her up out of nothing, so to speak, and befriended\nher?\n\nHe moved from his chair in this silent room and began to pace\nslowly to and fro, the weightiness of this subject exercising to the\nfull his power of decision. She was guilty of a misdeed which he felt\nable to condemn. The original concealment was evil; the continued\ndeception more. Lastly, there was the thought that her love after all\nhad been divided, part for him, part for the child, a discovery which\nno man in his position could contemplate with serenity. He moved\nirritably as he thought of it, shoved his hands in his pockets and\nwalked to and fro across the floor.\n\nThat a man of Lester's temperament should consider himself wronged\nby Jennie merely because she had concealed a child whose existence was\ndue to conduct no more irregular than was involved later in the\nyielding of herself to him was an example of those inexplicable\nperversions of judgment to which the human mind, in its capacity of\nkeeper of the honor of others, seems permanently committed. Lester,\naside from his own personal conduct (for men seldom judge with that in\nthe balance), had faith in the ideal that a woman should reveal\nherself completely to the one man with whom she is in love; and the\nfact that she had not done so was a grief to him. He had asked her\nonce tentatively about her past. She begged him not to press her. That\nwas the time she should have spoken of any child. Now--he shook\nhis head.\n\nHis first impulse, after he had thought the thing over, was to walk\nout and leave her. At the same time he was curious to hear the end of\nthis business. He did put on his hat and coat, however, and went out,\nstopping at the first convenient saloon to get a drink. He took a car\nand went down to the club, strolling about the different rooms and\nchatting with several people whom he encountered. He was restless and\nirritated; and finally, after three hours of meditation, he took a cab\nand returned to his apartment.\n\nThe distraught Jennie, sitting by her sleeping child, was at last\nmade to realize, by its peaceful breathing that all danger was over.\nThere was nothing more that she could do for Vesta, and now the claims\nof the home that she had deserted began to reassert themselves, the\npromise to Lester and the need of being loyal to her duties unto the\nvery end. Lester might possibly be waiting for her. It was just\nprobable that he wished to hear the remainder of her story before\nbreaking with her entirely. Although anguished and frightened by the\ncertainty, as she deemed it, of his forsaking her, she nevertheless\nfelt that it was no more than she deserved--a just punishment for\nall her misdoings.\n\nWhen Jennie arrived at the flat it was after eleven, and the hall\nlight was already out. She first tried the door, and then inserted her\nkey. No one stirred, however, and, opening the door, she entered in\nthe expectation of seeing Lester sternly confronting her. He was not\nthere, however. The burning gas had merely been an oversight on his\npart. She glanced quickly about, but seeing only the empty room, she\ncame instantly to the other conclusion, that he had forsaken\nher--and so stood there, a meditative, helpless figure.\n\n\"Gone!\" she thought.\n\nAt this moment his footsteps sounded on the stairs. He came in with\nhis derby hat pulled low over his broad forehead, close to his sandy\neyebrows, and with his overcoat buttoned up closely about his neck. He\ntook off the coat without looking at Jennie and hung it on the rack.\nThen he deliberately took off his hat and hung that up also. When he\nwas through he turned to where she was watching him with wide\neyes.\n\n\"I want to know about this thing now from beginning to end,\" he\nbegan. \"Whose child is that?\"\n\nJennie wavered a moment, as one who might be going to take a leap\nin the dark, then opened her lips mechanically and confessed:\n\n\"It's Senator Brander's.\"\n\n\"Senator Brander!\" echoed Lester, the familiar name of the dead but\nstill famous statesman ringing with shocking and unexpected force in\nhis ears. \"How did you come to know him?\"\n\n\"We used to do his washing for him,\" she rejoined simply--\"my\nmother and I.\"\n\nLester paused, the baldness of the statements issuing from her\nsobering even his rancorous mood. \"Senator Brander's child,\" he\nthought to himself. So that great representative of the interests of\nthe common people was the undoer of her--a self-confessed\nwasherwoman's daughter. A fine tragedy of low life all this was.\n\n\"How long ago was this?\" he demanded, his face the picture of a\ndarkling mood.\n\n\"It's been nearly six years now,\" she returned.\n\nHe calculated the time that had elapsed since he had known her, and\nthen continued:\n\n\"How old is the child?\"\n\n\"She's a little over five.\"\n\nLester moved a little. The need for serious thought made his tone\nmore peremptory but less bitter.\n\n\"Where have you been keeping her all this time?\"\n\n\"She was at home until you went to Cincinnati last spring. I went\ndown and brought her then.\"\n\n\"Was she there the times I came to Cleveland?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Jennie; \"but I didn't let her come out anywhere where\nyou could see her.\"\n\n\"I thought you said you told your people that you were married,\" he\nexclaimed, wondering how this relationship of the child to the family\ncould have been adjusted.\n\n\"I did,\" she replied, \"but I didn't want to tell you about her.\nThey thought all the time I intended to.\"\n\n\"Well, why didn't you?\"\n\n\"Because I was afraid.\"\n\n\"Afraid of what?\"\n\n\"I didn't know what was going to become of me when I went with you,\nLester. I didn't want to do her any harm if I could help it. I was\nashamed, afterward; when you said you didn't like children I was\nafraid.\"\n\n\"Afraid I'd leave you?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nHe stopped, the simplicity of her answers removing a part of the\nsuspicion of artful duplicity which had originally weighed upon him.\nAfter all, there was not so much of that in it as mere wretchedness of\ncircumstance and cowardice of morals. What a family she must have!\nWhat queer non-moral natures they must have to have brooked any such a\ncombination of affairs!\n\n\"Didn't you know that you'd be found out in the long run?\" he at\nlast demanded. \"Surely you might have seen that you couldn't raise her\nthat way. Why didn't you tell me in the first place? I wouldn't have\nthought anything of it then.\"\n\n\"I know,\" she said. \"I wanted to protect her.\"\n\n\"Where is she now?\" he asked.\n\nJennie explained.\n\nShe stood there, the contradictory aspect of these questions and of\nhis attitude puzzling even herself. She did try to explain them after\na time, but all Lester could gain was that she had blundered along\nwithout any artifice at all--a condition that was so manifest\nthat, had he been in any other position than that he was, he might\nhave pitied her. As it was, the revelation concerning Brander was\nhanging over him, and he finally returned to that.\n\n\"You say your mother used to do washing for him. How did you come\nto get in with him?\"\n\nJennie, who until now had borne his questions with unmoving pain,\nwinced at this. He was now encroaching upon the period that was by far\nthe most distressing memory of her life. What he had just asked seemed\nto be a demand upon her to make everything clear.\n\n\"I was so young, Lester,\" she pleaded. \"I was only eighteen. I\ndidn't know. I used to go to the hotel where he was stopping and get\nhis laundry, and at the end of the week I'd take it to him again.\"\n\nShe paused, and as he took a chair, looking as if he expected to\nhear the whole story, she continued: \"We were so poor. He used to give\nme money to give to my mother. I didn't know.\"\n\nShe paused again, totally unable to go on, and he, seeing that it\nwould be impossible for her to explain without prompting, took up his\nquestioning again--eliciting by degrees the whole pitiful story.\nBrander had intended to marry her. He had written to her, but before\nhe could come to her he died.\n\nThe confession was complete. It was followed by a period of five\nminutes, in which Lester said nothing at all; he put his arm on the\nmantel and stared at the wall, while Jennie waited, not knowing what\nwould follow--not wishing to make a single plea. The clock ticked\naudibly. Lester's face betrayed no sign of either thought or feeling.\nHe was now quite calm, quite sober, wondering what he should do.\nJennie was before him as the criminal at the bar. He, the righteous,\nthe moral, the pure of heart, was in the judgment seat. Now to\nsentence her--to make up his mind what course of action he should\npursue.\n\nIt was a disagreeable tangle, to be sure, something that a man of\nhis position and wealth really ought not to have anything to do with.\nThis child, the actuality of it, put an almost unbearable face upon\nthe whole matter--and yet he was not quite prepared to speak. He\nturned after a time, the silvery tinkle of the French clock on the\nmantel striking three and causing him to become aware of Jennie, pale,\nuncertain, still standing as she had stood all this while.\n\n\"Better go to bed,\" he said at last, and fell again to pondering\nthis difficult problem.\n\nBut Jennie continued to stand there wide-eyed, expectant, ready to\nhear at any moment his decision as to her fate. She waited in vain,\nhowever. After a long time of musing he turned and went to the\nclothes-rack near the door.\n\n\"Better go to bed,\" he said, indifferently. \"I'm going out.\"\n\nShe turned instinctively, feeling that even in this crisis there\nwas some little service that she might render, but he did not see her.\nHe went out, vouchsafing no further speech.\n\nShe looked after him, and as his footsteps sounded on the stair she\nfelt as if she were doomed and hearing her own death-knell. What had\nshe done? What would he do now? She stood there a dissonance of\ndespair, and when the lower door clicked moved her hand out of the\nagony of her suppressed hopelessness.\n\n\"Gone!\" she thought. \"Gone!\"\n\nIn the light of a late dawn she was still sitting there pondering,\nher state far too urgent for idle tears.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXX\n\n\nThe sullen, philosophic Lester was not so determined upon his\nfuture course of action as he appeared to be. Stern as was his mood,\nhe did not see, after all, exactly what grounds he had for complaint.\nAnd yet the child's existence complicated matters considerably. He did\nnot like to see the evidence of Jennie's previous misdeeds walking\nabout in the shape of a human being; but, as a matter of fact, he\nadmitted to himself that long ago he might have forced Jennie's story\nout of her if he had gone about it in earnest. She would not have\nlied, he knew that. At the very outset he might have demanded the\nhistory of her past. He had not done so; well, now it was too late.\nThe one thing it did fix in his mind was that it would be useless to\never think of marrying her. It couldn't be done, not by a man in his\nposition. The best solution of the problem was to make reasonable\nprovision for Jennie and then leave her. He went to his hotel with his\nmind made up, but he did not actually say to himself that he would do\nit at once.\n\nIt is an easy thing for a man to theorize in a situation of this\nkind, quite another to act. Our comforts, appetites and passions grow\nwith usage, and Jennie was not only a comfort, but an appetite, with\nhim. Almost four years of constant association had taught him so much\nabout her and himself that he was not prepared to let go easily or\nquickly. It was too much of a wrench. He could think of it bustling\nabout the work of a great organization during the daytime, but when\nnight came it was a different matter. He could be lonely, too, he\ndiscovered much to his surprise, and it disturbed him.\n\nOne of the things that interested him in this situation was\nJennie's early theory that the intermingling of Vesta with him and her\nin this new relationship would injure the child. Just how did she come\nby that feeling, he wanted to know? His place in the world was better\nthan hers, yet it dawned on him after a time that there might have\nbeen something in her point of view. She did not know who he was or\nwhat he would do with her. He might leave her shortly. Being\nuncertain, she wished to protect her baby. That wasn't so bad. Then\nagain, he was curious to know what the child was like. The daughter of\na man like Senator Brander might be somewhat of an infant. He was a\nbrilliant man and Jennie was a charming woman. He thought of this,\nand, while it irritated him, it aroused his curiosity. He ought to go\nback and see the child--he was really entitled to a view of\nit--but he hesitated because of his own attitude in the\nbeginning. It seemed to him that he really ought to quit, and here he\nwas parleying with himself.\n\nThe truth was that he couldn't. These years of living with Jennie\nhad made him curiously dependent upon her. Who had ever been so close\nto him before? His mother loved him, but her attitude toward him had\nnot so much to do with real love as with ambition. His\nfather--well, his father was a man, like himself. All of his\nsisters were distinctly wrapped up in their own affairs; Robert and he\nwere temperamentally uncongenial. With Jennie he had really been\nhappy, he had truly lived. She was necessary to him; the longer he\nstayed away from her the more he wanted her. He finally decided to\nhave a straight-out talk with her, to arrive at some sort of\nunderstanding. She ought to get the child and take care of it. She\nmust understand that he might eventually want to quit. She ought to be\nmade to feel that a definite change had taken place, though no\nimmediate break might occur. That same evening he went out to the\napartment. Jennie heard him enter, and her heart began to flutter.\nThen she took her courage in both hands, and went to meet him.\n\n\"There's just one thing to be done about this as far as I can see,\"\nbegan Lester, with characteristic directness.\n\n\"Get the child and bring her here where you can take care of her.\nThere's no use leaving her in the hands of strangers.\"\n\n\"I will, Lester,\" said Jennie submissively. \"I always wanted\nto.\"\n\n\"Very well, then, you'd better do it at once.\" He took an evening\nnewspaper out of his pocket and strolled toward one of the front\nwindows; then he turned to her. \"You and I might as well understand\neach other, Jennie,\" he went on. \"I can see how this thing came about.\nIt was a piece of foolishness on my part not to have asked you before,\nand made you tell me. It was silly for you to conceal it, even if you\ndidn't want the child's life mixed with mine. You might have known\nthat it couldn't be done. That's neither here nor there, though, now.\nThe thing that I want to point out is that one can't live and hold a\nrelationship such as ours without confidence. You and I had that, I\nthought. I don't see my way clear to ever hold more than a tentative\nrelationship with you on this basis. The thing is too tangled. There's\ntoo much cause for scandal.\"\n\n\"I know,\" said Jennie.\n\n\"Now, I don't propose to do anything hasty. For my part I don't see\nwhy things can't go on about as they are--certainly for the\npresent--but I want you to look the facts in the face.\"\n\nJennie sighed. \"I know, Lester,\" she said, \"I know.\"\n\nHe went to the window and stared out. There were some trees in the\nyard, where the darkness was settling. He wondered how this would\nreally come out, for he liked a home atmosphere. Should he leave the\napartment and go to his club?\n\n\"You'd better get the dinner,\" he suggested, after a time, turning\ntoward her irritably; but he did not feel so distant as he looked. It\nwas a shame that life could not be more decently organized. He\nstrolled back to his lounge, and Jennie went about her duties. She was\nthinking of Vesta, of her ungrateful attitude toward Lester, of his\nfinal decision never to marry her. So that was how one dream had been\nwrecked by folly.\n\nShe spread the table, lighted the pretty silver candles, made his\nfavorite biscuit, put a small leg of lamb in the oven to roast, and\nwashed some lettuce-leaves for a salad. She had been a diligent\nstudent of a cook-book for some time, and she had learned a good deal\nfrom her mother. All the time she was wondering how the situation\nwould work out. He would leave her eventually--no doubt of that.\nHe would go away and marry some one else.\n\n\"Oh, well,\" she thought finally, \"he is not going to leave me right\naway--that is something. And I can bring Vesta here.\" She sighed\nas she carried the things to the table. If life would only give her\nLester and Vesta together--but that hope was over.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXI\n\n\nThere was peace and quiet for some time after this storm. Jennie\nwent the next day and brought Vesta away with her. The joy of the\nreunion between mother and child made up for many other worries. \"Now\nI can do by her as I ought,\" she thought; and three or four times\nduring the day she found herself humming a little song.\n\nLester came only occasionally at first. He was trying to make\nhimself believe that he ought to do something toward reforming his\nlife--toward bringing about that eventual separation which he had\nsuggested. He did not like the idea of a child being in this\napartment--particularly that particular child. He fought his way\nthrough a period of calculated neglect, and then began to return to\nthe apartment more regularly. In spite of all its drawbacks, it was a\nplace of quiet, peace, and very notable personal comfort.\n\nDuring the first days of Lester's return it was difficult for\nJennie to adjust matters so as to keep the playful, nervous, almost\nuncontrollable child from annoying the staid, emphatic,\ncommercial-minded man. Jennie gave Vesta a severe talking to the first\nnight Lester telephoned that he was coming, telling her that he was a\nvery bad-tempered man who didn't like children, and that she mustn't\ngo near him. \"You mustn't talk,\" she said. \"You mustn't ask questions.\nLet mamma ask you what you want. And don't reach, ever.\"\n\nVesta agreed solemnly, but her childish mind hardly grasped the\nfull significance of the warning.\n\nLester came at seven. Jennie, who had taken great pains to array\nVesta as attractively as possible, had gone into her bedroom to give\nher own toilet a last touch. Vesta was supposedly in the kitchen. As a\nmatter of fact, she had followed her mother to the door of the\nsitting-room, where now she could be plainly seen. Lester hung up his\nhat and coat, then, turning, he caught his first glimpse. The child\nlooked very sweet--he admitted that at a glance. She was arrayed\nin a blue-dotted, white flannel dress, with a soft roll collar and\ncuffs, and the costume was completed by white stockings and shoes. Her\ncorn-colored ringlets hung gaily about her face. Blue eyes, rosy lips,\nrosy cheeks completed the picture. Lester stared, almost inclined to\nsay something, but restrained himself. Vesta shyly retreated.\n\nWhen Jennie came out he commented on the fact that Vesta had\narrived. \"Rather sweet-looking child,\" he said. \"Do you have much\ntrouble in making her mind?\"\n\n\"Not much,\" she returned.\n\nJennie went on to the dining-room, and Lester overheard a scrap of\ntheir conversation.\n\n\"Who are he?\" asked Vesta.\n\n\"Sh! That's your Uncle Lester. Didn't I tell you you mustn't\ntalk?\"\n\n\"Are he your uncle?\"\n\n\"No, dear. Don't talk now. Run into the kitchen.\"\n\n\"Are he only my uncle?\"\n\n\"Yes. Now run along.\"\n\n\"All right.\"\n\nIn spite of himself Lester had to smile.\n\nWhat might have followed if the child had been homely, misshapen,\npeevish, or all three, can scarcely be conjectured. Had Jennie been\nless tactful, even in the beginning, he might have obtained a\ndisagreeable impression. As it was, the natural beauty of the child,\ncombined with the mother's gentle diplomacy in keeping her in the\nbackground, served to give him that fleeting glimpse of innocence and\nyouth which is always pleasant. The thought struck him that Jennie had\nbeen the mother of a child all these years; she had been separated\nfrom it for months at a time; she had never even hinted at its\nexistence, and yet her affection for Vesta was obviously great. \"It's\nqueer,\" he said. \"She's a peculiar woman.\"\n\nOne morning Lester was sitting in the parlor reading his paper when\nhe thought he heard something stir. He turned, and was surprised to\nsee a large blue eye fixed upon him through the crack of a neighboring\ndoor--the effect was most disconcerting. It was not like the\nordinary eye, which, under such embarrassing circumstances, would have\nbeen immediately withdrawn; it kept its position with deliberate\nboldness. He turned his paper solemnly and looked again. There was the\neye. He turned it again. Still was the eye present. He crossed his\nlegs and looked again. Now the eye was gone.\n\nThis little episode, unimportant in itself, was yet informed with\nthe saving grace of comedy, a thing to which Lester was especially\nresponsive. Although not in the least inclined to relax his attitude\nof aloofness, he found his mind, in the minutest degree, tickled by\nthe mysterious appearance; the corners of his mouth were animated by a\ndesire to turn up. He did not give way to the feeling, and stuck by\nhis paper, but the incident remained very clearly in his mind. The\nyoung wayfarer had made her first really important impression upon\nhim.\n\nNot long after this Lester was sitting one morning at breakfast,\ncalmly eating his chop and conning his newspaper, when he was aroused\nby another visitation--this time not quite so simple. Jennie had\ngiven Vesta her breakfast, and set her to amuse herself alone until\nLester should leave the house. Jennie was seated at the table, pouring\nout the coffee, when Vesta suddenly appeared, very business-like in\nmanner, and marched through the room. Lester looked up, and Jennie\ncolored and arose.\n\n\"What is it, Vesta?\" she inquired, following her.\n\nBy this time, however, Vesta had reached the kitchen, secured a\nlittle broom, and returned, a droll determination lighting her\nface.\n\n\"I want my little broom,\" she exclaimed and marched sedately past,\nat which manifestation of spirit Lester again twitched internally,\nthis time allowing the slightest suggestion of a smile to play across\nhis mouth.\n\nThe final effect of this intercourse was gradually to break down\nthe feeling of distaste Lester had for the child, and to establish in\nits place a sort of tolerant recognition of her possibilities as a\nhuman being.\n\nThe developments of the next six months were of a kind to further\nrelax the strain of opposition which still existed in Lester's mind.\nAlthough not at all resigned to the somewhat tainted atmosphere in\nwhich he was living, he yet found himself so comfortable that he could\nnot persuade himself to give it up. It was too much like a bed of\ndown. Jennie was too worshipful. The condition of unquestioned\nliberty, so far as all his old social relationships were concerned,\ncoupled with the privilege of quiet, simplicity, and affection in the\nhome was too inviting. He lingered on, and began to feel that perhaps\nit would be just as well to let matters rest as they were.\n\nDuring this period his friendly relations with the little Vesta\ninsensibly strengthened. He discovered that there was a real flavor of\nhumor about Vesta's doings, and so came to watch for its development.\nShe was forever doing something interesting, and although Jennie\nwatched over her with a care that was in itself a revelation to him,\nnevertheless Vesta managed to elude every effort to suppress her and\ncame straight home with her remarks. Once, for example, she was sawing\naway at a small piece of meat upon her large plate with her big knife,\nwhen Lester remarked to Jennie that it might be advisable to get her a\nlittle breakfast set.\n\n\"She can hardly handle these knives.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Vesta instantly. \"I need a little knife. My hand is\njust so very little.\"\n\nShe held it up. Jennie, who never could tell what was to follow,\nreached over and put it down, while Lester with difficulty restrained\na desire to laugh.\n\nAnother morning, not long after, she was watching Jennie put the\nlumps of sugar in Lester's cup, when she broke in with, \"I want two\nlumps in mine, mamma.\"\n\n\"No, dearest,\" replied Jennie, \"you don't need any in yours. You\nhave milk to drink.\"\n\n\"Uncle Lester has two,\" she protested.\n\n\"Yes,\" returned Jennie; \"but you're only a little girl. Besides you\nmustn't say anything like that at the table. It isn't nice.\"\n\n\"Uncle Lester eats too much sugar,\" was her immediate rejoinder, at\nwhich that fine gourmet smiled broadly.\n\n\"I don't know about that,\" he put in, for the first time deigning\nto answer her directly. \"That sounds like the fox and grapes to me.\"\nVesta smiled back at him, and now that the ice was broken she\nchattered on unrestrainedly. One thing led to another, and at last\nLester felt as though, in a way, the little girl belonged to him; he\nwas willing even that she should share in such opportunities as his\nposition and wealth might make possible--provided, of course,\nthat he stayed with Jennie, and that they worked out some arrangement\nwhich would not put him hopelessly out of touch with the world which\nwas back of him, and which he had to keep constantly in mind.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXII\n\n\nThe following spring the show-rooms and warehouse were completed,\nand Lester removed his office to the new building. Heretofore, he had\nbeen transacting all his business affairs at the Grand Pacific and the\nclub. From now on he felt himself to be firmly established in\nChicago--as if that was to be his future home. A large number of\ndetails were thrown upon him--the control of a considerable\noffice force, and the handling of various important transactions. It\ntook away from him the need of traveling, that duty going to Amy's\nhusband, under the direction of Robert. The latter was doing his best\nto push his personal interests, not only through the influence he was\nbringing to bear upon his sisters, but through his reorganization of\nthe factory. Several men whom Lester was personally fond of were in\ndanger of elimination. But Lester did not hear of this, and Kane\nsenior was inclined to give Robert a free hand. Age was telling on\nhim. He was glad to see some one with a strong policy come up and take\ncharge. Lester did not seem to mind. Apparently he and Robert were on\nbetter terms than ever before.\n\nMatters might have gone on smoothly enough were it not for the fact\nthat Lester's private life with Jennie was not a matter which could be\npermanently kept under cover. At times he was seen driving with her by\npeople who knew him in a social and commercial way. He was for\nbrazening it out on the ground that he was a single man, and at\nliberty to associate with anybody he pleased. Jennie might be any\nyoung woman of good family in whom he was interested. He did not\npropose to introduce her to anybody if he could help it, and he always\nmade it a point to be a fast traveler in driving, in order that others\nmight not attempt to detain and talk to him. At the theater, as has\nbeen said, she was simply \"Miss Gerhardt.\"\n\nThe trouble was that many of his friends were also keen observers\nof life. They had no quarrel to pick with Lester's conduct. Only he\nhad been seen in other cities, in times past, with this same woman.\nShe must be some one whom he was maintaining irregularly. Well, what\nof it? Wealth and youthful spirits must have their fling. Rumors came\nto Robert, who, however, kept his own counsel. If Lester wanted to do\nthis sort of thing, well and good. But there must come a time when\nthere would be a show-down.\n\nThis came about in one form about a year and a half after Lester\nand Jennie had been living in the north side apartment. It so happened\nthat, during a stretch of inclement weather in the fall, Lester was\nseized with a mild form of grip. When he felt the first symptoms he\nthought that his indisposition would be a matter of short duration,\nand tried to overcome it by taking a hot bath and a liberal dose of\nquinine. But the infection was stronger than he counted on; by morning\nhe was flat on his back, with a severe fever and a splitting\nheadache.\n\nHis long period of association with Jennie had made him incautious.\nPolicy would have dictated that he should betake himself to his hotel\nand endure his sickness alone. As a matter of fact, he was very glad\nto be in the house with her. He had to call up the office to say that\nhe was indisposed and would not be down for a day or so; then he\nyielded himself comfortably to her patient ministrations.\n\nJennie, of course, was delighted to have Lester with her, sick or\nwell. She persuaded him to see a doctor and have him prescribe. She\nbrought him potions of hot lemonade, and bathed his face and hands in\ncold water over and over. Later, when he was recovering, she made him\nappetizing cups of beef-tea or gruel.\n\nIt was during this illness that the first real contretemps\noccurred. Lester's sister Louise, who had been visiting friends in St.\nPaul, and who had written him that she might stop off to see him on\nher way, decided upon an earlier return than she had originally\nplanned. While Lester was sick at his apartment she arrived in\nChicago. Calling up the office, and finding that he was not there and\nwould not be down for several days, she asked where he could be\nreached.\n\n\"I think he is at his rooms in the Grand Pacific,\" said an\nincautious secretary. \"He's not feeling well.\" Louise, a little\ndisturbed, telephoned to the Grand Pacific, and was told that Mr. Kane\nhad not been there for several days--did not, as a matter of\nfact, occupy his rooms more than one or two days a week. Piqued by\nthis, she telephoned his club.\n\nIt so happened that at the club there was a telephone boy who had\ncalled up the apartment a number of times for Lester himself. He had\nnot been cautioned not to give its number--as a matter of fact,\nit had never been asked for by any one else. When Louise stated that\nshe was Lester's sister, and was anxious to find him, the boy replied,\n\"I think he lives at 19 Schiller Place.\"\n\n\"Whose address is that you're giving?\" inquired a passing\nclerk.\n\n\"Mr. Kane's.\"\n\n\"Well, don't be giving out addresses. Don't you know that yet?\"\n\nThe boy apologized, but Louise had hung up the receiver and was\ngone.\n\nAbout an hour later, curious as to this third residence of her\nbrother, Louise arrived at Schiller Place. Ascending the\nsteps--it was a two-apartment house--she saw the name of\nKane on the door leading to the second floor. Ringing the bell, she\nwas opened to by Jennie, who was surprised to see so fashionably\nattired a young woman.\n\n\"This is Mr. Kane's apartment, I believe,\" began Louise,\ncondescendingly, as she looked in at the open door behind Jennie. She\nwas a little surprised to meet a young woman, but her suspicions were\nas yet only vaguely aroused.\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Jennie.\n\n\"He's sick, I believe. I'm his sister. May I come in?\"\n\nJennie, had she had time to collect her thoughts, would have tried\nto make some excuse, but Louise, with the audacity of her birth and\nstation, swept past before Jennie could say a word. Once inside Louise\nlooked about her inquiringly. She found herself in the sitting-room,\nwhich gave into the bedroom where Lester was lying. Vesta happened to\nbe playing in one corner of the room, and stood up to eye the\nnew-comer. The open bedroom showed Lester quite plainly lying in bed,\na window to the left of him, his eyes closed.\n\n\"Oh, there you are, old fellow!\" exclaimed Louise. \"What's ailing\nyou?\" she hurried on.\n\nLester, who at the sound of her voice had opened his eyes, realized\nin an instant how things were. He pulled himself up on one elbow, but\nwords failed him.\n\n\"Why, hello, Louise,\" he finally forced himself to say. \"Where did\nyou come from?\"\n\n\"St. Paul. I came back sooner than I thought,\" she answered lamely,\na sense of something wrong irritating her. \"I had a hard time finding\nyou, too. Who's your--\" she was about to say \"pretty\nhousekeeper,\" but turned to find Jennie dazedly gathering up certain\narticles in the adjoining room and looking dreadfully distraught.\n\nLester cleared his throat hopelessly.\n\nHis sister swept the place with an observing eye. It took in the\nhome atmosphere, which was both pleasing and suggestive. There was a\ndress of Jennie's lying across a chair, in a familiar way, which\ncaused Miss Kane to draw herself up warily. She looked at her brother,\nwho had a rather curious expression in his eyes--he seemed\nslightly nonplussed, but cool and defiant.\n\n\"You shouldn't have come out here,\" said Lester finally, before\nLouise could give vent to the rising question in her mind.\n\n\"Why shouldn't I?\" she exclaimed, angered at the brazen confession.\n\"You're my brother, aren't you? Why should you have any place that I\ncouldn't come. Well, I like that--and from you to me.\"\n\n\"Listen, Louise,\" went on Lester, drawing himself up further on one\nelbow. \"You know as much about life as I do. There is no need of our\ngetting into an argument. I didn't know you were coming, or I would\nhave made other arrangements.\"\n\n\"Other arrangements, indeed,\" she sneered. \"I should think as much.\nThe idea!\"\n\nShe was greatly irritated to think that she had fallen into this\ntrap; it was really disgraceful of Lester.\n\n\"I wouldn't be so haughty about it,\" he declared, his color rising.\n\"I'm not apologizing to you for my conduct. I'm saying I would have\nmade other arrangements, which is a very different thing from begging\nyour pardon. If you don't want to be civil, you needn't.\"\n\n\"Why, Lester Kane!\" she exclaimed, her cheeks flaming. \"I thought\nbetter of you, honestly I did. I should think you would be ashamed of\nyourself living here in open--\" she paused without using the\nword--\"and our friends scattered all over the city. It's\nterrible! I thought you had more sense of decency and\nconsideration.\"\n\n\"Decency nothing,\" he flared. \"I tell you I'm not apologizing to\nyou. If you don't like this you know what you can do.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" she exclaimed. \"This from my own brother! And for the sake of\nthat creature! Whose child is that?\" she demanded, savagely and yet\ncuriously.\n\n\"Never mind, it's not mine. If it were it wouldn't make any\ndifference. I wish you wouldn't busy yourself about my affairs.\"\n\nJennie, who had been moving about the dining-room beyond the\nsitting-room, heard the cutting references to herself. She winced with\npain.\n\n\"Don't flatter yourself. I won't any more,\" retorted Louise. \"I\nshould think, though, that you, of all men, would be above anything\nlike this--and that with a woman so obviously beneath you. Why, I\nthought she was--\" she was again going to add \"your housekeeper,\"\nbut she was interrupted by Lester, who was angry to the point of\nbrutality.\n\n\"Never mind what you thought she was,\" he growled. \"She's better\nthan some who do the so-called superior thinking. I know what you\nthink. It's neither here nor there, I tell you. I'm doing this, and I\ndon't care what you think. I have to take the blame. Don't bother\nabout me.\"\n\n\"Well, I won't, I assure you,\" she flung back. \"It's quite plain\nthat your family means nothing to you. But if you had any sense of\ndecency, Lester Kane, you would never let your sister be trapped into\ncoming into a place like this. I'm disgusted, that's all, and so will\nthe others be when they hear of it.\"\n\nShe turned on her heel and walked scornfully out, a withering look\nbeing reserved for Jennie, who had unfortunately stepped near the door\nof the dining-room. Vesta had disappeared. Jennie came in a little\nwhile later and closed the door. She knew of nothing to say. Lester,\nhis thick hair pushed back from his vigorous face, leaned back moodily\non his pillow. \"What a devilish trick of fortune,\" he thought. Now she\nwould go home and tell it to the family. His father would know, and\nhis mother. Robert, Imogene, Amy all would hear. He would have no\nexplanation to make--she had seen. He stared at the wall\nmeditatively.\n\nMeanwhile Jennie, moving about her duties, also found food for\nreflection. So this was her real position in another woman's eyes. Now\nshe could see what the world thought. This family was as aloof from\nher as if it lived on another planet. To his sisters and brothers, his\nfather and mother, she was a bad woman, a creature far beneath him\nsocially, far beneath him mentally and morally, a creature of the\nstreets. And she had hoped somehow to rehabilitate herself in the eyes\nof the world. It cut her as nothing before had ever done. The thought\ntore a great, gaping wound in her sensibilities. She was really low\nand vile in her--Louise's--eyes, in the world's eyes,\nbasically so in Lester's eyes. How could it be otherwise? She went\nabout numb and still, but the ache of defeat and disgrace was under it\nall. Oh, if she could only see some way to make herself right with the\nworld, to live honorably, to be decent. How could that possibly be\nbrought about? It ought to be--she knew that. But how?\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIII\n\n\nOutraged in her family pride, Louise lost no time in returning to\nCincinnati, where she told the story of her discovery, embellished\nwith many details. According to her, she was met at the door by a\n\"silly-looking, white-faced woman,\" who did not even offer to invite\nher in when she announced her name, but stood there \"looking just as\nguilty as a person possibly could.\" Lester also had acted shamefully,\nhaving outbrazened the matter to her face. When she had demanded to\nknow whose the child was he had refused to tell her. \"It isn't mine,\"\nwas all he would say.\n\n\"Oh dear, oh dear!\" exclaimed Mrs. Kane, who was the first to hear\nthe story. \"My son, my Lester! How could he have done it!\"\n\n\"And such a creature!\" exclaimed Louise emphatically, as though the\nwords needed to be reiterated to give them any shadow of reality.\n\n\"I went there solely because I thought I could help him,\" continued\nLouise. \"I thought when they said he was indisposed that he might be\nseriously ill. How should I have known?\"\n\n\"Poor Lester!\" exclaimed her mother. \"To think he would come to\nanything like that!\"\n\nMrs. Kane turned the difficult problem over in her mind and, having\nno previous experiences whereby to measure it, telephoned for old\nArchibald, who came out from the factory and sat through the\ndiscussion with a solemn countenance. So Lester was living openly with\na woman of whom they had never heard. He would probably be as defiant\nand indifferent as his nature was strong. The standpoint of parental\nauthority was impossible. Lester was a centralized authority in\nhimself, and if any overtures for a change of conduct were to be made,\nthey would have to be very diplomatically executed.\n\nArchibald Kane returned to the manufactory sore and disgusted, but\ndetermined that something ought to be done. He held a consultation\nwith Robert, who confessed that he had heard disturbing rumors from\ntime to time, but had not wanted to say anything. Mrs. Kane suggested\nthat Robert might go to Chicago and have a talk with Lester.\n\n\"He ought to see that this thing, if continued, is going to do him\nirreparable damage,\" said Mr. Kane. \"He cannot hope to carry it off\nsuccessfully. Nobody can. He ought to marry her or he ought to quit. I\nwant you to tell him that for me.\"\n\n\"All well and good,\" said Robert, \"but who's going to convince him?\nI'm sure I don't want the job.\"\n\n\"I hope to,\" said old Archibald, \"eventually; but you'd better go\nup and try, anyhow. It can't do any harm. He might come to his\nsenses.\"\n\n\"I don't believe it,\" replied Robert. \"He's a strong man. You see\nhow much good talk does down here. Still, I'll go if it will relieve\nyour feelings any. Mother wants it.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes,\" said his father distractedly, \"better go.\"\n\nAccordingly Robert went. Without allowing himself to anticipate any\nparticular measure of success in this adventure, he rode pleasantly\ninto Chicago confident in the reflection that he had all the powers of\nmorality and justice on his side.\n\nUpon Robert's arrival, the third morning after Louise's interview,\nhe called up the warerooms, but Lester was not there. He then\ntelephoned to the house, and tactfully made an appointment. Lester was\nstill indisposed, but he preferred to come down to the office, and he\ndid. He met Robert in his cheerful, nonchalant way, and together they\ntalked business for a time. Then followed a pregnant silence.\n\n\"Well, I suppose you know what brought me up here,\" began Robert\ntentatively.\n\n\"I think I could make a guess at it,\" Lester replied.\n\n\"They were all very much worried over the fact that you were\nsick--mother particularly. You're not in any danger of having a\nrelapse, are you?\"\n\n\"I think not.\"\n\n\"Louise said there was some sort of a peculiar menage\nshe ran into up here. You're not married, are you?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"The young woman Louise saw is just--\" Robert waved his hand\nexpressively.\n\nLester nodded.\n\n\"I don't want to be inquisitive, Lester. I didn't come up for that.\nI'm simply here because the family felt that I ought to come. Mother\nwas so very much distressed that I couldn't do less than see you for\nher sake\"--he paused, and Lester, touched by the fairness and\nrespect of his attitude, felt that mere courtesy at least made some\nexplanation due.\n\n\"I don't know that anything I can say will help matters much,\" he\nreplied thoughtfully. \"There's really nothing to be said. I have the\nwoman and the family has its objections. The chief difficulty about\nthe thing seems to be the bad luck in being found out.\"\n\nHe stopped, and Robert turned over the substance of this worldly\nreasoning in his mind. Lester was very calm about it. He seemed, as\nusual, to be most convincingly sane.\n\n\"You're not contemplating marrying her, are you?\" queried Robert\nhesitatingly.\n\n\"I hadn't come to that,\" answered Lester coolly.\n\nThey looked at each other quietly for a moment, and then Robert\nturned his glance to the distant scene of the city.\n\n\"It's useless to ask whether you are seriously in love with her, I\nsuppose,\" ventured Robert.\n\n\"I don't know whether I'd be able to discuss that divine afflatus\nwith you or not,\" returned Lester, with a touch of grim humor. \"I have\nnever experienced the sensation myself. All I know is that the lady is\nvery pleasing to me.\"\n\n\"Well, it's all a question of your own well-being and the family's,\nLester,\" went on Robert, after another pause. \"Morality doesn't seem\nto figure in it anyway--at least you and I can't discuss that\ntogether. Your feelings on that score naturally relate to you alone.\nBut the matter of your own personal welfare seems to me to be\nsubstantial enough ground to base a plea on. The family's feelings and\npride are also fairly important. Father's the kind of a man who sets\nmore store by the honor of his family than most men. You know that as\nwell as I do, of course.\"\n\n\"I know how father feels about it,\" returned Lester. \"The whole\nbusiness is as clear to me as it is to any of you, though off-hand I\ndon't see just what's to be done about it. These matters aren't always\nof a day's growth, and they can't be settled in a day. The girl's\nhere. To a certain extent I'm responsible that she is here. While I'm\nnot willing to go into details, there's always more in these affairs\nthan appears on the court calendar.\"\n\n\"Of course I don't know what your relations with her have been,\"\nreturned Robert, \"and I'm not curious to know, but it does look like a\nbit of injustice all around, don't you think--unless you intend\nto marry her?\" This last was put forth as a feeler.\n\n\"I might be willing to agree to that, too,\" was Lester's baffling\nreply, \"if anything were to be gained by it. The point is, the woman\nis here, and the family is in possession of the fact. Now if there is\nanything to be done I have to do it. There isn't anybody else who can\nact for me in this matter.\"\n\nLester lapsed into a silence, and Robert rose and paced the floor,\ncoming back after a time to say: \"You say you haven't any idea of\nmarrying her--or rather you haven't come to it. I wouldn't,\nLester. It seems to me you would be making the mistake of your life,\nfrom every point of view. I don't want to orate, but a man of your\nposition has so much to lose; you can't afford to do it. Aside from\nfamily considerations, you have too much at stake. You'd be simply\nthrowing your life away--\"\n\nHe paused, with his right hand held out before him, as was\ncustomary when he was deeply in earnest, and Lester felt the candor\nand simplicity of this appeal. Robert was not criticizing him now. He\nwas making an appeal to him, and this was somewhat different.\n\nThe appeal passed without comment, however, and then Robert began\non a new tack, this time picturing old Archibald's fondness for Lester\nand the hope he had always entertained that he would marry some\nwell-to-do Cincinnati girl, Catholic, if agreeable to him, but at\nleast worthy of his station. And Mrs. Kane felt the same way; surely\nLester must realize that.\n\n\"I know just how all of them feel about it,\" Lester interrupted at\nlast, \"but I don't see that anything's to be done right now.\"\n\n\"You mean that you don't think it would be policy for you to give\nher up just at present?\"\n\n\"I mean that she's been exceptionally good to me, and that I'm\nmorally under obligations to do the best I can by her. What that may\nbe, I can't tell.\"\n\n\"To live with her?\" inquired Robert coolly.\n\n\"Certainly not to turn her out bag and baggage if she has been\naccustomed to live with me,\" replied Lester.\n\nRobert sat down again, as if he considered his recent appeal\nfutile.\n\n\"Can't family reasons persuade you to make some amicable\narrangements with her and let her go?\"\n\n\"Not without due consideration of the matter; no.\"\n\n\"You don't think you could hold out some hope that the thing will\nend quickly--something that would give me a reasonable excuse for\nsoftening down the pain of it to the family?\"\n\n\"I would be perfectly willing to do anything which would take away\nthe edge of this thing for the family, but the truth's the truth, and\nI can't see any room for equivocation between you and me. As I've said\nbefore, these relationships are involved with things which make it\nimpossible to discuss them--unfair to me, unfair to the woman. No\none can see how they are to be handled, except the people that are in\nthem, and even they can't always see. I'd be a damned dog to stand up\nhere and give you my word to do anything except the best I can.\"\n\nLester stopped, and now Robert rose and paced the floor again, only\nto come back after a time and say, \"You don't think there's anything\nto be done just at present?\"\n\n\"Not at present.\"\n\n\"Very well, then, I expect I might as well be going. I don't know\nthat there's anything else we can talk about.\"\n\n\"Won't you stay and take lunch with me? I think I might manage to\nget down to the hotel if you'll stay.\"\n\n\"No, thank you,\" answered Robert. \"I believe I can make that one\no'clock train for Cincinnati. I'll try, anyhow.\"\n\nThey stood before each other now, Lester pale and rather flaccid,\nRobert clear, wax-like, well-knit, and shrewd, and one could see the\ndifference time had already made. Robert was the clean, decisive man,\nLester the man of doubts. Robert was the spirit of business energy and\nintegrity embodied, Lester the spirit of commercial self-sufficiency,\nlooking at life with an uncertain eye. Together they made a striking\npicture, which was none the less powerful for the thoughts that were\nnow running through their minds.\n\n\"Well,\" said the older brother, after a time, \"I don't suppose\nthere is anything more I can say. I had hoped to make you feel just as\nwe do about this thing, but of course you are your own best judge of\nthis. If you don't see it now, nothing I could say would make you. It\nstrikes me as a very bad move on your part though.\"\n\nLester listened. He said nothing, but his face expressed an\nunchanged purpose.\n\nRobert turned for his hat, and they walked to the office door\ntogether.\n\n\"I'll put the best face I can on it,\" said Robert, and walked\nout.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIV\n\n\nIn this world of ours the activities of animal life seem to be\nlimited to a plane or circle, as if that were an inherent necessity to\nthe creatures of a planet which is perforce compelled to swing about\nthe sun. A fish, for instance, may not pass out of the circle of the\nseas without courting annihilation; a bird may not enter the domain of\nthe fishes without paying for it dearly. From the parasites of the\nflowers to the monsters of the jungle and the deep we see clearly the\ncircumscribed nature of their movements--the emphatic manner in\nwhich life has limited them to a sphere; and we are content to note\nthe ludicrous and invariably fatal results which attend any effort on\ntheir part to depart from their environment.\n\nIn the case of man, however, the operation of this theory of\nlimitations has not as yet been so clearly observed. The laws\ngoverning our social life are not so clearly understood as to permit\nof a clear generalization. Still, the opinions, pleas, and judgments\nof society serve as boundaries which are none the less real for being\nintangible. When men or women err--that is, pass out from the\nsphere in which they are accustomed to move--it is not as if the\nbird had intruded itself into the water, or the wild animal into the\nhaunts of man. Annihilation is not the immediate result. People may do\nno more than elevate their eyebrows in astonishment, laugh\nsarcastically, lift up their hands in protest. And yet so well defined\nis the sphere of social activity that he who departs from it is\ndoomed. Born and bred in this environment, the individual is\npractically unfitted for any other state. He is like a bird accustomed\nto a certain density of atmosphere, and which cannot live comfortably\nat either higher or lower level.\n\nLester sat down in his easy-chair by the window after his brother\nhad gone and gazed ruminatively out over the flourishing city. Yonder\nwas spread out before him life with its concomitant phases of energy,\nhope, prosperity, and pleasure, and here he was suddenly struck by a\nwind of misfortune and blown aside for the time being--his\nprospects and purposes dissipated. Could he continue as cheerily in\nthe paths he had hitherto pursued? Would not his relations with Jennie\nbe necessarily affected by this sudden tide of opposition? Was not his\nown home now a thing of the past so far as his old easy-going\nrelationship was concerned? All the atmosphere of unstained affection\nwould be gone out of it now. That hearty look of approval which used\nto dwell in his father's eye--would it be there any longer?\nRobert, his relations with the manufactory, everything that was a part\nof his old life, had been affected by this sudden intrusion of\nLouise.\n\n\"It's unfortunate,\" was all that he thought to himself, and\ntherewith turned from what he considered senseless brooding to the\nconsideration of what, if anything, was to be done.\n\n\"I'm thinking I'd take a run up to Mt. Clemens to-morrow, or\nThursday anyhow, if I feel strong enough,\" he said to Jennie after he\nhad returned. \"I'm not feeling as well as I might. A few days will do\nme good.\" He wanted to get off by himself and think. Jennie packed his\nbag for him at the given time, and he departed, but he was in a\nsullen, meditative mood.\n\nDuring the week that followed he had ample time to think it all\nover, the result of his cogitations being that there was no need of\nmaking a decisive move at present. A few weeks more, one way or the\nother, could not make any practical difference. Neither Robert nor any\nother member of the family was at all likely to seek another\nconference with him. His business relations would necessarily go on as\nusual, since they were coupled with the welfare of the manufactory;\ncertainly no attempt to coerce him would be attempted. But the\nconsciousness that he was at hopeless variance with his family weighed\nupon him. \"Bad business,\" he meditated--\"bad business.\" But he\ndid not change.\n\nFor the period of a whole year this unsatisfactory state of affairs\ncontinued. Lester did not go home for six months; then an important\nbusiness conference demanding his presence, he appeared and carried it\noff quite as though nothing important had happened. His mother kissed\nhim affectionately, if a little sadly; his father gave him his\ncustomary greeting, a hearty handshake; Robert, Louise, Amy, Imogene,\nconcertedly, though without any verbal understanding, agreed to ignore\nthe one real issue. But the feeling of estrangement was there, and it\npersisted. Hereafter his visits to Cincinnati were as few and far\nbetween as he could possibly make them.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXV\n\n\nIn the meantime Jennie had been going through a moral crisis of her\nown. For the first time in her life, aside from the family attitude,\nwhich had afflicted her greatly, she realized what the world thought\nof her. She was bad--she knew that. She had yielded on two\noccasions to the force of circumstances which might have been fought\nout differently. If only she had had more courage! If she did not\nalways have this haunting sense of fear! If she could only make up her\nmind to do the right thing! Lester would never marry her. Why should\nhe? She loved him, but she could leave him, and it would be better for\nhim. Probably her father would live with her if she went back to\nCleveland. He would honor her for at last taking a decent stand. Yet\nthe thought of leaving Lester was a terrible one to her--he had\nbeen so good. As for her father, she was not sure whether he would\nreceive her or not.\n\nAfter the tragic visit of Louise she began to think of saving a\nlittle money, laying it aside as best she could from her allowance.\nLester was generous and she had been able to send home regularly\nfifteen dollars a week to maintain the family--as much as they\nhad lived on before, without any help from the outside. She spent\ntwenty dollars to maintain the table, for Lester required the best of\neverything--fruits, meats, desserts, liquors, and what not. The\nrent was fifty-five dollars, with clothes and extras a varying sum.\nLester gave her fifty dollars a week, but somehow it had all gone. She\nthought how she might economize but this seemed wrong.\n\nBetter go without taking anything, if she were going, was the\nthought that came to her. It was the only decent thing to do.\n\nShe thought over this week after week, after the advent of Louise,\ntrying to nerve herself to the point where she could speak or act.\nLester was consistently generous and kind, but she felt at times that\nhe himself might wish it. He was thoughtful, abstracted. Since the\nscene with Louise it seemed to her that he had been a little\ndifferent. If she could only say to him that she was not satisfied\nwith the way she was living, and then leave. But he himself had\nplainly indicated after his discovery of Vesta that her feelings on\nthat score could not matter so very much to him, since he thought the\npresence of the child would definitely interfere with his ever\nmarrying her. It was her presence he wanted on another basis. And he\nwas so forceful, she could not argue with him very well. She decided\nif she went it would be best to write a letter and tell him why. Then\nmaybe when he knew how she felt he would forgive her and think nothing\nmore about it.\n\nThe condition of the Gerhardt family was not improving. Since\nJennie had left Martha had married. After several years of teaching in\nthe public schools of Cleveland she had met a young architect, and\nthey were united after a short engagement. Martha had been always a\nlittle ashamed of her family, and now, when this new life dawned, she\nwas anxious to keep the connection as slight as possible. She barely\nnotified the members of the family of the approaching\nmarriage--Jennie not at all--and to the actual ceremony she\ninvited only Bass and George. Gerhardt, Veronica, and William resented\nthe slight. Gerhardt ventured upon no comment. He had had too many\nrebuffs. But Veronica was angry. She hoped that life would give her an\nopportunity to pay her sister off. William, of course, did not mind\nparticularly. He was interested in the possibilities of becoming an\nelectrical engineer, a career which one of his school-teachers had\npointed out to him as being attractive and promising.\n\nJennie heard of Martha's marriage after it was all over, a note\nfrom Veronica giving her the main details. She was glad from one point\nof view, but realized that her brothers and sisters were drifting away\nfrom her.\n\nA little while after Martha's marriage Veronica and William went to\nreside with George, a break which was brought about by the attitude of\nGerhardt himself. Ever since his wife's death and the departure of the\nother children he had been subject to moods of profound gloom, from\nwhich he was not easily aroused. Life, it seemed, was drawing to a\nclose for him, although he was only sixty-five years of age. The\nearthly ambitions he had once cherished were gone forever. He saw\nSebastian, Martha, and George out in the world practically ignoring\nhim, contributing nothing at all to a home which should never have\ntaken a dollar from Jennie. Veronica and William were restless. They\nobjected to leaving school and going to work, apparently preferring to\nlive on money which Gerhardt had long since concluded was not being\ncome by honestly. He was now pretty well satisfied as to the true\nrelations of Jennie and Lester. At first he had believed them to be\nmarried, but the way Lester had neglected Jennie for long periods, the\nhumbleness with which she ran at his beck and call, her fear of\ntelling him about Vesta--somehow it all pointed to the same\nthing. She had not been married at home. Gerhardt had never had sight\nof her marriage certificate. Since she was away she might have been\nmarried, but he did not believe it.\n\nThe real trouble was that Gerhardt had grown intensely morose and\ncrotchety, and it was becoming impossible for young people to live\nwith him. Veronica and William felt it. They resented the way in which\nhe took charge of the expenditures after Martha left. He accused them\nof spending too much on clothes and amusements, he insisted that a\nsmaller house should be taken, and he regularly sequestered a part of\nthe money which Jennie sent, for what purpose they could hardly guess.\nAs a matter of fact, Gerhardt was saving as much as possible in order\nto repay Jennie eventually. He thought it was sinful to go on in this\nway, and this was his one method, out side of his meager earnings, to\nredeem himself. If his other children had acted rightly by him he felt\nthat he would not now be left in his old age the recipient of charity\nfrom one, who, despite her other good qualities, was certainly not\nleading a righteous life. So they quarreled.\n\nIt ended one winter month when George agreed to receive his\ncomplaining brother and sister on condition that they should get\nsomething to do. Gerhardt was nonplussed for a moment, but invited\nthem to take the furniture and go their way. His generosity shamed\nthem for the moment; they even tentatively invited him to come and\nlive with them, but this he would not do. He would ask the foreman of\nthe mill he watched for the privilege of sleeping in some\nout-of-the-way garret. He was always liked and trusted. And this would\nsave him a little money.\n\nSo in a fit of pique he did this, and there was seen the spectacle\nof an old man watching through a dreary season of nights, in a lonely\ntrafficless neighborhood while the city pursued its gaiety elsewhere.\nHe had a wee small corner in the topmost loft of a warehouse away from\nthe tear and grind of the factory proper. Here Gerhardt slept by day.\nIn the afternoon he would take a little walk, strolling toward the\nbusiness center, or out along the banks of the Cuyahoga, or the lake.\nAs a rule his hands were below his back, his brow bent in meditation.\nHe would even talk to himself a little--an occasional \"By chops!\"\nor \"So it is\" being indicative of his dreary mood. At dusk he would\nreturn, taking his stand at the lonely gate which was his post of\nduty. His meals he secured at a nearby workingmen's boarding-house,\nsuch as he felt he must have.\n\nThe nature of the old German's reflections at this time were of a\npeculiarly subtle and somber character. What was this\nthing--life? What did it all come to after the struggle, and the\nworry, and the grieving? Where does it all go to? People die; you hear\nnothing more from them. His wife, now, she had gone. Where had her\nspirit taken its flight?\n\nYet he continued to hold some strongly dogmatic convictions. He\nbelieved there was a hell, and that people who sinned would go there.\nHow about Mrs. Gerhardt? How about Jennie? He believed that both had\nsinned woefully. He believed that the just would be rewarded in\nheaven. But who were the just? Mrs. Gerhardt had not had a bad heart.\nJennie was the soul of generosity. Take his son Sebastian. Sebastian\nwas a good boy, but he was cold, and certainly indifferent to his\nfather. Take Martha--she was ambitious, but obviously selfish.\nSomehow the children, outside of Jennie, seemed self-centered. Bass\nwalked off when he got married, and did nothing more for anybody.\nMartha insisted that she needed all she made to live on. George had\ncontributed for a little while, but had finally refused to help out.\nVeronica and William had been content to live on Jennie's money so\nlong as he would allow it, and yet they knew it was not right. His\nvery existence, was it not a commentary on the selfishness of his\nchildren? And he was getting so old. He shook his head. Mystery of\nmysteries. Life was truly strange, and dark, and uncertain. Still he\ndid not want to go and live with any of his children. Actually they\nwere not worthy of him--none but Jennie, and she was not good. So\nhe grieved.\n\nThis woeful condition of affairs was not made known to Jennie for\nsome time. She had been sending her letters to Martha, but, on her\nleaving, Jennie had been writing directly to Gerhardt. After\nVeronica's departure Gerhardt wrote to Jennie saying that there was no\nneed of sending any more money. Veronica and William were going to\nlive with George. He himself had a good place in a factory, and would\nlive there a little while. He returned her a moderate sum that he had\nsaved--one hundred and fifteen dollars--with the word that\nhe would not need it.\n\nJennie did not understand, but as the others did not write, she was\nnot sure but what it might be all right--her father was so\ndetermined. But by degrees, however, a sense of what it really must\nmean overtook her--a sense of something wrong, and she worried,\nhesitating between leaving Lester and going to see about her father,\nwhether she left him or not. Would he come with her? Not here\ncertainly. If she were married, yes, possibly. If she were\nalone--probably. Yet if she did not get some work which paid well\nthey would have a difficult time. It was the same old problem. What\ncould she do? Nevertheless, she decided to act. If she could get five\nor six dollars a week they could live. This hundred and fifteen\ndollars which Gerhardt had saved would tide them over the worst\ndifficulties perhaps.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVI\n\n\nThe trouble with Jennie's plan was that it did not definitely take\ninto consideration Lester's attitude. He did care for her in an\nelemental way, but he was hedged about by the ideas of the\nconventional world in which he had been reared. To say that he loved\nher well enough to take her for better or worse--to legalize her\nanomalous position and to face the world bravely with the fact that he\nhad chosen a wife who suited him--was perhaps going a little too\nfar, but he did really care for her, and he was not in a mood, at this\nparticular time, to contemplate parting with her for good.\n\nLester was getting along to that time of life when his ideas of\nwomanhood were fixed and not subject to change. Thus far, on his own\nplane and within the circle of his own associates, he had met no one\nwho appealed to him as did Jennie. She was gentle, intelligent,\ngracious, a handmaiden to his every need; and he had taught her the\nlittle customs of polite society, until she was as agreeable a\ncompanion as he cared to have. He was comfortable, he was\nsatisfied--why seek further?\n\nBut Jennie's restlessness increased day by day. She tried writing\nout her views, and started a half dozen letters before she finally\nworded one which seemed, partially at least, to express her feelings.\nIt was a long letter for her, and it ran as follows:\n\n\"Lester dear, When you get this I won't be here, and I want you\nnot to think harshly of me until you have read it all. I am taking\nVesta and leaving, and I think it is really better that I should.\nLester, I ought to do it. You know when you met me we were very poor,\nand my condition was such that I didn't think any good man would ever\nwant me. When you came along and told me you loved me I was hardly\nable to think just what I ought to do. You made me love you, Lester,\nin spite of myself.\n\n\"You know I told you that I oughtn't to do anything wrong any more\nand that I wasn't good, but somehow when you were near me I couldn't\nthink just right, and I didn't see just how I was to get away from\nyou. Papa was sick at home that time, and there was hardly anything in\nthe house to eat. We were all doing so poorly. My brother George\ndidn't have good shoes, and mamma was so worried. I have often\nthought, Lester, if mamma had not been compelled to worry so much she\nmight be alive to-day. I thought if you liked me and I really liked\nyou--I love you, Lester--maybe it wouldn't make so much\ndifference about me. You know you told me right away you would like to\nhelp my family, and I felt that maybe that would be the right thing to\ndo. We were so terribly poor.\n\n\"Lester, dear, I am ashamed to leave you this way; it seems so mean,\nbut if you knew how I have been feeling these days you would forgive\nme. Oh, I love you, Lester, I do, I do. But for months past--ever\nsince your sister came--I felt that I was doing wrong, and that I\noughtn't to go on doing it, for I know how terribly wrong it is. It\nwas wrong for me ever to have anything to do with Senator Brander, but\nI was such a girl then--I hardly knew what I was doing. It was\nwrong of me not to tell you about Vesta when I first met you, though I\nthought I was doing right when I did it. It was terribly wrong of me\nto keep her here all that time concealed, Lester, but I was afraid of\nyou then--afraid of what you would say and do. When your sister\nLouise came it all came over me somehow, clearly, and I have never\nbeen able to think right about it since. It can't be right, Lester,\nbut I don't blame you. I blame myself.\n\n\"I don't ask you to marry me, Lester. I know how you feel about me\nand how you feel about your family, and I don't think it would be\nright. They would never want you to do it, and it isn't right that I\nshould ask you. At the same time I know I oughtn't to go on living\nthis way. Vesta is getting along where she understands everything. She\nthinks you are her really truly uncle. I have thought of it all so\nmuch. I have thought a number of times that I would try to talk to you\nabout it, but you frighten me when you get serious, and I don't seem\nto be able to say what I want to. So I thought if I could just write\nyou this and then go you would understand. You do, Lester, don't you?\nYou won't be angry with me? I know it's for the best for you and for\nme. I ought to do it. Please forgive me, Lester, please; and don't\nthink of me any more. I will get along. But I love you--oh yes, I\ndo--and I will never be grateful enough for all you have done for\nme. I wish you all the luck that can come to you. Please forgive me,\nLester. I love you, yes, I do. I love you.\n\n\"JENNIE.\n\n\"P. S. I expect to go to Cleveland with papa. He needs me. He is all\nalone. But don't come for me, Lester. It's best that you\nshouldn't.\"\n\nShe put this in an envelope, sealed it, and, having hidden it in\nher bosom, for the time being, awaited the hour when she could\nconveniently take her departure.\n\nIt was several days before she could bring herself to the actual\nexecution of the plan, but one afternoon, Lester, having telephoned\nthat he would not be home for a day or two, she packed some necessary\ngarments for herself and Vesta in several trunks, and sent for an\nexpressman. She thought of telegraphing her father that she was\ncoming; but, seeing he had no home, she thought it would be just as\nwell to go and find him. George and Veronica had not taken all the\nfurniture. The major portion of it was in storage--so Gerhard t\nhad written. She might take that and furnish a little home or flat.\nShe was ready for the end, waiting for the expressman, when the door\nopened and in walked Lester.\n\nFor some unforeseen reason he had changed his mind. He was not in\nthe least psychic or intuitional, but on this occasion his feelings\nhad served him a peculiar turn. He had thought of going for a day's\nduck-shooting with some friends in the Kankakee Marshes south of\nChicago, but had finally changed his mind; he even decided to go out\nto the house early. What prompted this he could not have said.\n\nAs he neared the house he felt a little peculiar about coming home\nso early; then at the sight of the two trunks standing in the middle\nof the room he stood dumfounded. What did it mean--Jennie dressed\nand ready to depart? And Vesta in a similar condition? He stared in\namazement, his brown eyes keen in inquiry.\n\n\"Where are you going?\" he asked.\n\n\"Why--why--\" she began, falling back. \"I was going\naway.\"\n\n\"Where to?\"\n\n\"I thought I would go to Cleveland,\" she replied.\n\n\"What for?\"\n\n\"Why--why--I meant to tell you, Lester, that I didn't\nthink I ought to stay here any longer this way. I didn't think it was\nright. I thought I'd tell you, but I couldn't. I wrote you a\nletter.\"\n\n\"A letter,\" he exclaimed. \"What the deuce are you talking about?\nWhere is the letter?\"\n\n\"There,\" she said, mechanically pointing to a small center-table\nwhere the letter lay conspicuous on a large book.\n\n\"And you were really going to leave me, Jennie, with just a\nletter?\" said Lester, his voice hardening a little as he spoke. \"I\nswear to heaven you are beyond me. What's the point?\" He tore open the\nenvelope and looked at the beginning. \"Better send Vesta from the\nroom,\" he suggested.\n\nShe obeyed. Then she came back and stood there pale and wide-eyed,\nlooking at the wall, at the trunks, and at him. Lester read the letter\nthoughtfully. He shifted his position once or twice, then dropped the\npaper on the floor.\n\n\"Well, I'll tell you, Jennie,\" he said finally, looking at her\ncuriously and wondering just what he was going to say. Here again was\nhis chance to end this relationship if he wished. He couldn't feel\nthat he did wish it, seeing how peacefully things were running. They\nhad gone so far together it seemed ridiculous to quit now. He truly\nloved her--there was no doubt of that. Still he did not want to\nmarry her--could not very well. She knew that. Her letter said as\nmuch. \"You have this thing wrong,\" he went on slowly. \"I don't know\nwhat comes over you at times, but you don't view the situation right.\nI've told you before that I can't marry you--not now, anyhow.\nThere are too many big things involved in this, which you don't know\nanything about. I love you, you know that. But my family has to be\ntaken into consideration, and the business. You can't see the\ndifficulties raised on these scores, but I can. Now I don't want you\nto leave me. I care too much about you. I can't prevent you, of\ncourse. You can go if you want to. But I don't think you ought to want\nto. You don't really, do you? Sit down a minute.\"\n\nJennie, who had been counting on getting away without being seen,\nwas now thoroughly nonplussed. To have him begin a quiet\nargument--a plea as it were. It hurt her. He, Lester, pleading\nwith her, and she loved him so.\n\nShe went over to him, and he took her hand.\n\n\"Now, listen,\" he said. \"There's really nothing to be gained by\nyour leaving me at present. Where did you say you were going?\"\n\n\"To Cleveland,\" she replied.\n\n\"Well, how did you expect to get along?\"\n\n\"I thought I'd take papa, if he'd come with me--he's alone\nnow--and get something to do, maybe.\"\n\n\"Well, what can you do, Jennie, different from what you ever have\ndone? You wouldn't expect to be a lady's maid again, would you? Or\nclerk in a store?\"\n\n\"I thought I might get some place as a housekeeper,\" she suggested.\nShe had been counting up her possibilities, and this was the most\npromising idea that had occurred to her.\n\n\"No, no,\" he grumbled, shaking his head. \"There's nothing to that.\nThere's nothing in this whole move of yours except a notion. Why, you\nwon't be any better off morally than you are right now. You can't undo\nthe past. It doesn't make any difference, anyhow. I can't marry you\nnow. I might in the future, but I can't tell anything about that, and\nI don't want to promise anything. You're not going to leave me though\nwith my consent, and if you were going I wouldn't have you dropping\nback into any such thing as you're contemplating. I'll make some\nprovision for you. You don't really want to leave me, do you,\nJennie?\"\n\nAgainst Lester's strong personality and vigorous protest Jennie's\nown conclusions and decisions went to pieces. Just the pressure of his\nhand was enough to upset her. Now she began to cry.\n\n\"Don't cry, Jennie,\" he said. \"This thing may work out better than\nyou think. Let it rest for a while. Take off your things. You're not\ngoing to leave me any more, are you?\"\n\n\"No-o-o!\" she sobbed.\n\nHe took her in his lap. \"Let things rest as they are,\" he went on.\n\"It's a curious world. Things can't be adjusted in a minute. They may\nwork out. I'm putting up with some things myself that I ordinarily\nwouldn't stand for.\"\n\nHe finally saw her restored to comparative calmness, smiling sadly\nthrough her tears.\n\n\"Now you put those things away,\" he said genially, pointing to the\ntrunks. \"Besides, I want you to promise me one thing.\"\n\n\"What's that?\" asked Jennie.\n\n\"No more concealment of anything, do you hear? No more thinking\nthings out for yourself, and acting without my knowing anything about\nit. If you have anything on your mind, I want you to come out with it.\nI'm not going to eat you! Talk to me about whatever is troubling you.\nI'll help you solve it, or, if I can't, at least there won't be any\nconcealment between us.\"\n\n\"I know, Lester,\" she said earnestly, looking him straight in the\neyes. \"I promise I'll never conceal anything any more--truly I\nwon't. I've been afraid, but I won't be now. You can trust me.\"\n\n\"That sounds like what you ought to be,\" he replied. \"I know you\nwill.\" And he let her go.\n\nA few days later, and in consequence of this agreement, the future\nof Gerhardt came up for discussion. Jennie had been worrying about him\nfor several days; now it occurred to her that this was something to\ntalk over with Lester. Accordingly, she explained one night at dinner\nwhat had happened in Cleveland. \"I know he is very unhappy there all\nalone,\" she said, \"and I hate to think of it. I was going to get him\nif I went back to Cleveland. Now I don't know what to do about\nit.\"\n\n\"Why don't you send him some money?\" he inquired.\n\n\"He won't take any more money from me, Lester,\" she explained. \"He\nthinks I'm not good--not acting right. He doesn't believe I'm\nmarried.\"\n\n\"He has pretty good reason, hasn't he?\" said Lester calmly.\n\n\"I hate to think of him sleeping in a factory. He's so old and\nlonely.\"\n\n\"What's the matter with the rest of the family in Cleveland? Won't\nthey do anything for him? Where's your brother Bass?\"\n\n\"I think maybe they don't want him, he's so cross,\" she said\nsimply.\n\n\"I hardly know what to suggest in that case,\" smiled Lester. \"The\nold gentleman oughtn't to be so fussy.\"\n\n\"I know,\" she said, \"but he's old now, and he has had so much\ntrouble.\"\n\nLester ruminated for a while, toying with his fork. \"I'll tell you\nwhat I've been thinking, Jennie,\" he said finally. \"There's no use\nliving this way any longer, if we're going to stick it out. I've been\nthinking that we might take a house out in Hyde Park. It's something\nof a run from the office, but I'm not much for this apartment life.\nYou and Vesta would be better off for a yard. In that case you might\nbring your father on to live with us. He couldn't do any harm\npottering about; indeed, he might help keep things straight.\"\n\n\"Oh, that would just suit papa, if he'd come,\" she replied. \"He\nloves to fix things, and he'd cut the grass and look after the\nfurnace. But he won't come unless he's sure I'm married.\"\n\n\"I don't know how that could be arranged unless you could show the\nold gentleman a marriage certificate. He seems to want something that\ncan't be produced very well. A steady job he'd have running the\nfurnace of a country house,\" he added meditatively.\n\nJennie did not notice the grimness of the jest. She was too busy\nthinking what a tangle she had made of her life. Gerhardt would not\ncome now, even if they had a lovely home to share with him. And yet he\nought to be with Vesta again. She would make him happy.\n\nShe remained lost in a sad abstraction, until Lester, following the\ndrift of her thoughts, said: \"I don't see how it can be arranged.\nMarriage certificate blanks aren't easily procurable. It's bad\nbusiness--a criminal offense to forge one, I believe. I wouldn't\nwant to be mixed up in that sort of thing.\"\n\n\"Oh, I don't want you to do anything like that, Lester. I'm just\nsorry papa is so stubborn. When he gets a notion you can't change\nhim.\"\n\n\"Suppose we wait until we get settled after moving,\" he suggested.\n\"Then you can go to Cleveland and talk to him personally. You might be\nable to persuade him.\" He liked her attitude toward her father. It was\nso decent that he rather wished he could help her carry out her\nscheme. While not very interesting, Gerhardt was not objectionable to\nLester, and if the old man wanted to do the odd jobs around a big\nplace, why not?\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVII\n\n\nThe plan for a residence in Hyde Park was not long in taking shape.\nAfter several weeks had passed, and things had quieted down again,\nLester invited Jennie to go with him to South Hyde Park to look for a\nhouse. On the first trip they found something which seemed to suit\nadmirably--an old-time home of eleven large rooms, set in a lawn\nfully two hundred feet square and shaded by trees which had been\nplanted when the city was young. It was ornate, homelike, peaceful.\nJennie was fascinated by the sense of space and country, although\ndepressed by the reflection that she was not entering her new home\nunder the right auspices. She had vaguely hoped that in planning to go\naway she was bringing about a condition under which Lester might have\ncome after her and married her. Now all that was over. She had\npromised to stay, and she would have to make the best of it. She\nsuggested that they would never know what to do with so much room, but\nhe waved that aside. \"We will very likely have people in now and\nthen,\" he said. \"We can furnish it up anyhow, and see how it looks.\"\nHe had the agent make out a five-year lease, with an option for\nrenewal, and set at once the forces to work to put the establishment\nin order.\n\nThe house was painted and decorated, the lawn put in order, and\neverything done to give the place a trim and satisfactory appearance.\nThere was a large, comfortable library and sitting-room, a big\ndining-room, a handsome reception-hall, a parlor, a large kitchen,\nserving-room, and in fact all the ground-floor essentials of a\ncomfortable home. On the second floor were bedrooms, baths, and the\nmaid's room. It was all very comfortable and harmonious, and Jennie\ntook an immense pride and pleasure in getting things in order.\n\nImmediately after moving in, Jennie, with Lester's permission,\nwrote to her father asking him to come to her. She did not say that\nshe was married, but left it to be inferred. She descanted on the\nbeauty of the neighborhood, the size of the yard, and the manifold\nconveniences of the establishment. \"It is so very nice,\" she added,\n\"you would like it, papa. Vesta is here and goes to school every day.\nWon't you come and stay with us? It's so much better than living in a\nfactory. And I would like to have you so.\"\n\nGerhardt read this letter with a solemn countenance, Was it really\ntrue? Would they be taking a larger house if they were not permanently\nunited? After all these years and all this lying? Could he have been\nmistaken? Well, it was high time--but should he go? He had lived\nalone this long time now--should he go to Chicago and live with\nJennie? Her appeal did touch him, but somehow he decided against it.\nThat would be too generous an acknowledgment of the fact that there\nhad been fault on his side as well as on hers.\n\nJennie was disappointed at Gerhardt's refusal. She talked it over\nwith Lester, and decided that she would go on to Cleveland and see\nhim. Accordingly, she made the trip, hunted up the factory, a great\nrumbling furniture concern in one of the poorest sections of the city,\nand inquired at the office for her father. The clerk directed her to a\ndistant warehouse, and Gerhardt was informed that a lady wished to see\nhim. He crawled out of his humble cot and came down, curious as to who\nit could be. When Jennie saw him in his dusty, baggy clothes, his hair\ngray, his eye brows shaggy, coming out of the dark door, a keen sense\nof the pathetic moved her again. \"Poor papa!\" she thought. He came\ntoward her, his inquisitorial eye softened a little by his\nconsciousness of the affection that had inspired her visit. \"What are\nyou come for?\" he asked cautiously.\n\n\"I want you to come home with me, papa,\" she pleaded yearningly. \"I\ndon't want you to stay here any more. I can't think of you living\nalone any longer.\"\n\n\"So,\" he said, nonplussed, \"that brings you?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" she replied; \"Won't you? Don't stay here.\"\n\n\"I have a good bed,\" he explained by way of apology for his\nstate.\n\n\"I know,\" she replied, \"but we have a good home now and Vesta is\nthere. Won't you come? Lester wants you to.\"\n\n\"Tell me one thing,\" he demanded. \"Are you married?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" she replied, lying hopelessly. \"I have been married a long\ntime. You can ask Lester when you come.\" She could scarcely look him\nin the face, but she managed somehow, and he believed her.\n\n\"Well,\" he said, \"it is time.\"\n\n\"Won't you come, papa?\" she pleaded.\n\nHe threw out his hands after his characteristic manner. The urgency\nof her appeal touched him to the quick. \"Yes, I come,\" he said, and\nturned; but she saw by his shoulders what was happening. He was\ncrying.\n\n\"Now, papa?\" she pleaded.\n\nFor answer he walked back into the dark warehouse to get his\nthings.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVIII\n\n\nGerhardt, having become an inmate of the Hyde Park home, at once\nbestirred himself about the labors which he felt instinctively\nconcerned him. He took charge of the furnace and the yard, outraged at\nthe thought that good money should be paid to any outsider when he had\nnothing to do. The trees, he declared to Jennie, were in a dreadful\ncondition. If Lester would get him a pruning knife and a saw he would\nattend to them in the spring. In Germany they knew how to care for\nsuch things, but these Americans were so shiftless. Then he wanted\ntools and nails, and in time all the closets and shelves were put in\norder. He found a Lutheran Church almost two miles away, and declared\nthat it was better than the one in Cleveland. The pastor, of course,\nwas a heaven-sent son of divinity. And nothing would do but that Vesta\nmust go to church with him regularly.\n\nJennie and Lester settled down into the new order of living with\nsome misgivings; certain difficulties were sure to arise. On the North\nSide it had been easy for Jennie to shun neighbors and say nothing.\nNow they were occupying a house of some pretensions; their immediate\nneighbors would feel it their duty to call, and Jennie would have to\nplay the part of an experienced hostess. She and Lester had talked\nthis situation over. It might as well be understood here, he said,\nthat they were husband and wife. Vesta was to be introduced as\nJennie's daughter by her first marriage, her husband, a Mr. Stover\n(her mother's maiden name), having died immediately after the child's\nbirth. Lester, of course, was the stepfather. This particular\nneighborhood was so far from the fashionable heart of Chicago that\nLester did not expect to run into many of his friends. He explained to\nJennie the ordinary formalities of social intercourse, so that when\nthe first visitor called Jennie might be prepared to receive her.\nWithin a fortnight this first visitor arrived in the person of Mrs.\nJacob Stendahl, a woman of considerable importance in this particular\nsection. She lived five doors from Jennie--the houses of the\nneighborhood were all set in spacious lawns--and drove up in her\ncarriage, on her return from her shopping, one afternoon.\n\n\"Is Mrs. Kane in?\" she asked of Jeannette, the new maid.\n\n\"I think so, mam,\" answered the girl. \"Won't you let me have your\ncard?\"\n\nThe card was given and taken to Jennie, who looked at it\ncuriously.\n\nWhen Jennie came into the parlor Mrs. Stendahl, a tall dark,\ninquisitive-looking woman, greeted her most cordially.\n\n\"I thought I would take the liberty of intruding on you,\" she said\nmost winningly. \"I am one of your neighbors. I live on the other side\nof the street, some few doors up. Perhaps you have seen the\nhouse--the one with the white stone gate-posts.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes indeed,\" replied Jennie. \"I know it well. Mr. Kane and I\nwere admiring it the first day we came out here.\"\n\n\"I know of your husband, of course, by reputation. My husband is\nconnected with the Wilkes Frog and Switch Company.\"\n\nJennie bowed her head. She knew that the latter concern must be\nsomething important and profitable from the way in which Mrs. Stendahl\nspoke of it.\n\n\"We have lived here quite a number of years, and I know how you\nmust feel coming as a total stranger to a new section of the city. I\nhope you will find time to come in and see me some afternoon. I shall\nbe most pleased. My regular reception day is Thursday.\"\n\n\"Indeed I shall,\" answered Jennie, a little nervously, for the\nordeal was a trying one. \"I appreciate your goodness in calling. Mr.\nKane is very busy as a rule, but when he is at home I am sure he would\nbe most pleased to meet you and your husband.\"\n\n\"You must both come over some evening,\" replied Mrs. Stendahl. \"We\nlead a very quiet life. My husband is not much for social gatherings.\nBut we enjoy our neighborhood friends.\"\n\nJennie smiled her assurances of good-will. She accompanied Mrs.\nStendahl to the door, and shook hands with her. \"I'm so glad to find\nyou so charming,\" observed Mrs. Stendahl frankly.\n\n\"Oh, thank you,\" said Jennie flushing a little. \"I'm sure I don't\ndeserve so much praise.\"\n\n\"Well, now I will expect you some afternoon. Good-by,\" and she\nwaved a gracious farewell.\n\n\"That wasn't so bad,\" thought Jennie as she watched Mrs. Stendahl\ndrive away. \"She is very nice, I think. I'll tell Lester about\nher.\"\n\nAmong the other callers were a Mr. and Mrs. Carmichael Burke, a\nMrs. Hanson Field, and a Mrs. Timothy Ballinger--all of whom left\ncards, or stayed to chat a few minutes. Jennie found herself taken\nquite seriously as a woman of importance, and she did her best to\nsupport the dignity of her position. And, indeed, she did\nexceptionally well. She was most hospitable and gracious. She had a\nkindly smile and a manner wholly natural; she succeeded in making a\nmost favorable impression. She explained to her guests that she had\nbeen living on the North Side until recently, that her husband,\nMr. Kane, had long wanted to have a home in Hyde Park, that her father\nand daughter were living here, and that Lester was the child's\nstepfather. She said she hoped to repay all these nice attentions and\nto be a good neighbor.\n\nLester heard about these calls in the evening, for he did not care\nto meet these people. Jennie came to enjoy it in a mild way. She liked\nmaking new friends, and she was hoping that something definite could\nbe worked out here which would make Lester look upon her as a good\nwife and an ideal companion. Perhaps, some day, he might really want\nto marry her.\n\nFirst impressions are not always permanent, as Jennie was soon to\ndiscover. The neighborhood had accepted her perhaps a little too\nhastily, and now rumors began to fly about. A Mrs. Sommerville,\ncalling on Mrs. Craig, one of Jennie's near neighbors, intimated that\nshe knew who Lester was--\"oh, yes, indeed. You know, my dear,\"\nshe went on, \"his reputation is just a little--\" she raised her\neyebrows and her hand at the same time.\n\n\"You don't say!\" commented her friend curiously. \"He looks like\nsuch a staid, conservative person.\"\n\n\"Oh, no doubt, in a way, he is,\" went on Mrs. Sommerville. \"His\nfamily is of the very best. There was some young woman he went\nwith--so my husband tells me. I don't know whether this is the\none or not, but she was introduced as a Miss Gorwood, or some such\nname as that, when they were living together as husband and wife on\nthe North Side.\"\n\n\"Tst! Tst! Tst!\" clicked Mrs. Craig with her tongue at this\nastonishing news. \"You don't tell me! Come to think of it, it must be\nthe same woman. Her father's name is Gerhardt.\"\n\n\"Gerhardt!\" exclaimed Mrs. Sommerville. \"Yes, that's the name. It\nseems to me that there was some earlier scandal in connection with\nher--at least there was a child. Whether he married her afterward\nor not, I don't know. Anyhow, I understand his family will not have\nanything to do with her.\"\n\n\"How very interesting!\" exclaimed Mrs. Craig. \"And to think he\nshould have married her afterward, if he really did. I'm sure you\ncan't tell with whom you're coming in contact these days, can\nyou?\"\n\n\"It's so true. Life does get badly mixed at times. She appears to\nbe a charming woman.\"\n\n\"Delightful!\" exclaimed Mrs. Craig. \"Quite naive. I was really\ntaken with her.\"\n\n\"Well, it may be,\" went on her guest, \"that this isn't the same\nwoman after all. I may be mistaken.\"\n\n\"Oh, I hardly think so. Gerhardt! She told me they had been living\non the North Side.\"\n\n\"Then I'm sure it's the same person. How curious that you should\nspeak of her!\"\n\n\"It is, indeed,\" went on Mrs. Craig, who was speculating as to what\nher attitude toward Jennie should be in the future.\n\nOther rumors came from other sources. There were people who had\nseen Jennie and Lester out driving on the North Side, who had been\nintroduced to her as Miss Gerhardt, who knew what the Kane family\nthought. Of course her present position, the handsome house, the\nwealth of Lester, the beauty of Vesta--all these things helped to\nsoften the situation. She was apparently too circumspect, too much the\ngood wife and mother, too really nice to be angry with; but she had a\npast, and that had to be taken into consideration.\n\nAn opening bolt of the coming storm fell upon Jennie one day when\nVesta, returning from school, suddenly asked: \"Mamma, who was my\npapa?\"\n\n\"His name was Stover, dear,\" replied her mother, struck at once by\nthe thought that there might have been some criticism--that some\none must have been saying something. \"Why do you ask?\"\n\n\"Where was I born?\" continued Vesta, ignoring the last inquiry, and\ninterested in clearing up her own identity.\n\n\"In Columbus, Ohio, pet. Why?\"\n\n\"Anita Ballinger said I didn't have any papa, and that you weren't\never married when you had me. She said I wasn't a really, truly girl\nat all--just a nobody. She made me so mad I slapped her.\"\n\nJennie's face grew rigid. She sat staring straight before her. Mrs.\nBallinger had called, and Jennie had thought her peculiarly gracious\nand helpful in her offer of assistance, and now her little daughter\nhad said this to Vesta. Where did the child hear it?\n\n\"You mustn't pay any attention to her, dearie,\" said Jennie at\nlast. \"She doesn't know. Your papa was Mr. Stover, and you were born\nin Columbus. You mustn't fight other little girls. Of course they say\nnasty things when they fight--sometimes things they don't really\nmean. Just let her alone and don't go near her any more. Then she\nwon't say anything to you.\"\n\nIt was a lame explanation, but it satisfied Vesta for the time\nbeing. \"I'll slap her if she tries to slap me,\" she persisted.\n\n\"You mustn't go near her, pet, do you hear? Then she can't try to\nslap you,\" returned her mother. \"Just go about your studies, and don't\nmind her. She can't quarrel with you if you don't let her.\"\n\nVesta went away leaving Jennie brooding over her words. The\nneighbors were talking. Her history was becoming common gossip. How\nhad they found out.\n\nIt is one thing to nurse a single thrust, another to have the wound\nopened from time to time by additional stabs. One day Jennie, having\ngone to call on Mrs. Hanson Field, who was her immediate neighbor, met\na Mrs. Williston Baker, who was there taking tea. Mrs. Baker knew of\nthe Kanes, of Jennie's history on the North Side, and of the attitude\nof the Kane family. She was a thin, vigorous, intellectual woman,\nsomewhat on the order of Mrs. Bracebridge, and very careful of her\nsocial connections. She had always considered Mrs. Field a woman of\nthe same rigid circumspectness of attitude, and when she found Jennie\ncalling there she was outwardly calm but inwardly irritated. \"This is\nMrs. Kane, Mrs. Baker,\" said Mrs. Field, introducing her guests with a\nsmiling countenance. Mrs. Baker looked at Jennie ominously.\n\n\"Mrs. Lester Kane?\" she inquired.\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Mrs. Fields.\n\n\"Indeed,\" she went on freezingly. \"I've heard a great deal about\nMrs.--\" accenting the word \"Mrs.--Lester Kane.\"\n\nShe turned to Mrs. Field, ignoring Jennie completely, and started\nan intimate conversation in which Jennie could have no possible share.\nJennie stood helplessly by, unable to formulate a thought which would\nbe suitable to so trying a situation. Mrs. Baker soon announced her\ndeparture, although she had intended to stay longer. \"I can't remain\nanother minute,\" she said; \"I promised Mrs. Neil that I would stop in\nto see her to-day. I'm sure I've bored you enough already as it\nis.\"\n\nShe walked to the door, not troubling to look at Jennie until she\nwas nearly out of the room. Then she looked in her direction, and gave\nher a frigid nod.\n\n\"We meet such curious people now and again,\" she observed finally\nto her hostess as she swept away.\n\nMrs. Field did not feel able to defend Jennie, for she herself was\nin no notable social position, and was endeavoring, like every other\nmiddle-class woman of means, to get along. She did not care to offend\nMrs. Williston Baker, who was socially so much more important than\nJennie. She came back to where Jennie was sitting, smiling\napologetically, but she was a little bit flustered. Jennie was out of\ncountenance, of course. Presently she excused herself and went home.\nShe had been cut deeply by the slight offered her, and she felt that\nMrs. Field realized that she had made a mistake in ever taking her up.\nThere would be no additional exchange of visits there--that she\nknew. The old hopeless feeling came over her that her life was a\nfailure. It couldn't be made right, or, if it could, it wouldn't be.\nLester was not inclined to marry her and put her right.\n\nTime went on and matters remained very much as they were. To look\nat this large house, with its smooth lawn and well grown trees, its\nvines clambering about the pillars of the veranda and interlacing\nthemselves into a transparent veil of green; to see Gerhardt pottering\nabout the yard, Vesta coming home from school, Lester leaving in the\nmorning in his smart trap--one would have said that here is peace\nand plenty, no shadow of unhappiness hangs over this charming\nhome.\n\nAnd as a matter of fact existence with Lester and Jennie did run\nsmoothly. It is true that the neighbors did not call any more, or only\na very few of them, and there was no social life to speak of; but the\ndeprivation was hardly noticed; there was so much in the home life to\nplease and interest. Vesta was learning to play the piano, and to play\nquite well. She had a good ear for music. Jennie was a charming figure\nin blue, lavender, and olive-green house-gowns as she went about her\naffairs, sewing, dusting, getting Vesta off to school, and seeing that\nthings generally were put to rights. Gerhardt busied himself about his\nmultitudinous duties, for he was not satisfied unless he had his hands\ninto all the domestic economies of the household. One of his\nself-imposed tasks was to go about the house after Lester, or the\nservants, turning out the gas-jets or electric-light bulbs which might\naccidentally have been left burning. That was a sinful extravagance.\n\nAgain, Lester's expensive clothes, which he carelessly threw aside\nafter a few month's use, were a source of woe to the thrifty old\nGerman. Moreover, he grieved over splendid shoes discarded because of\na few wrinkles in the leather or a slightly run down heel or sole.\nGerhardt was for having them repaired, but Lester answered the old\nman's querulous inquiry as to what was wrong \"with them shoes\" by\nsaying that they weren't comfortable any more.\n\n\"Such extravagance!\" Gerhardt complained to Jennie. \"Such waste! No\ngood can come of anything like that, It will mean want one of these\ndays.\"\n\n\"He can't help it, papa,\" Jennie excused. \"That's the way he was\nraised.\"\n\n\"Ha! A fine way to be raised. These Americans, they know nothing of\neconomy. They ought to live in Germany awhile. Then they would know\nwhat a dollar can do.\"\n\nLester heard something of this through Jennie, but he only smiled.\nGerhardt was amusing to him.\n\nAnother grievance was Lester's extravagant use of matches. He had\nthe habit of striking a match, holding it while he talked, instead of\nlighting his cigar, and then throwing it away. Sometimes he would\nbegin to light a cigar two or three minutes before he would actually\ndo so, tossing aside match after match. There was a place out in one\ncorner of the veranda where he liked to sit of a spring or summer\nevening, smoking and throwing away half-burned matches. Jennie would\nsit with him, and a vast number of matches would be lit and flung out\non the lawn. At one time, while engaged in cutting the grass, Gerhardt\nfound, to his horror, not a handful, but literally boxes of\nhalf-burned match-sticks lying unconsumed and decaying under the\nfallen blades. He was discouraged, to say the least. He gathered up\nthis damning evidence in a newspaper and carried it back into the\nsitting-room where Jennie was sewing.\n\n\"See here, what I find!\" he demanded. \"Just look at that! That man,\nhe has no more sense of economy than a--than a--\" the right\nterm failed him. \"He sits and smokes, and this is the way he uses\nmatches. Five cents a box they cost--five cents. How can a man\nhope to do well and carry on like that, I like to know. Look at\nthem.\"\n\nJennie looked. She shook her head. \"Lester is extravagant,\" she\nsaid.\n\nGerhardt carried them to the basement. At least they should be\nburned in the furnace. He would have used them as lighters for his own\npipe, sticking them in the fire to catch a blaze, only old newspapers\nwere better, and he had stacks of these--another evidence of his\nlord and master's wretched, spendthrift disposition. It was a sad\nworld to work in. Almost everything was against him. Still he fought\nas valiantly as he could against waste and shameless extravagance. His\nown economies were rigid. He would wear the same suit of\nblack--cut down from one of Lester's expensive investments of\nyears before--every Sunday for a couple of years. Lester's shoes,\nby a little stretch of the imagination, could be made to seem to fit,\nand these he wore. His old ties also--the black ones--they\nwere fine. If he could have cut down Lester's shirts he would have\ndone so; he did make over the underwear, with the friendly aid of the\ncook's needle. Lester's socks, of course, were just right. There was\nnever any expense for Gerhardt's clothing.\n\nThe remaining stock of Lester's discarded clothing--shoes,\nshirts, collars, suits, ties, and what not--he would store away\nfor weeks and months, and then, in a sad and gloomy frame of mind, he\nwould call in a tailor, or an old-shoe man, or a ragman, and dispose\nof the lot at the best price he could. He learned that all second-hand\nclothes men were sharks; that there was no use in putting the least\nfaith in the protests of any rag dealer or old-shoe man. They all\nlied. They all claimed to be very poor, when as a matter of fact they\nwere actually rolling in wealth. Gerhardt had investigated these\nstories; he had followed them up; he had seen what they were doing\nwith the things he sold them.\n\n\"Scoundrels!\" he declared. \"They offer me ten cents for a pair of\nshoes, and then I see them hanging out in front of their places marked\ntwo dollars. Such robbery! My God! They could afford to give me a\ndollar.\"\n\nJennie smiled. It was only to her that he complained, for he could\nexpect no sympathy from' Lester. So far as his own meager store of\nmoney was concerned, he gave the most of it to his beloved church,\nwhere he was considered to be a model of propriety, honesty,\nfaith--in fact, the embodiment of all the virtues.\n\nAnd so, for all the ill winds that were beginning to blow socially,\nJennie was now leading the dream years of her existence. Lester, in\nspite of the doubts which assailed him at times as to the wisdom of\nhis career, was invariably kind and considerate, and he seemed to\nenjoy his home life.\n\n\"Everything all right?\" she would ask when he came in of an\nevening.\n\n\"Sure!\" he would answer, and pinch her chin or cheek.\n\nShe would follow him in while Jeannette, always alert, would take\nhis coat and hat. In the winter-time they would sit in the library\nbefore the big grate-fire. In the spring, summer, or fall Lester\npreferred to walk out on the porch, one corner of which commanded a\nsweeping view of the lawn and the distant street, and light his\nbefore-dinner cigar. Jennie would sit on the side of his chair and\nstroke his head. \"Your hair is not getting the least bit thin, Lester;\naren't you glad?\" she would say; or, \"Oh, see how your brow is\nwrinkled now. You mustn't do that. You didn't change your tie, mister,\nthis morning. Why didn't you? I laid one out for you.\"\n\n\"Oh, I forgot,\" he would answer, or he would cause the wrinkles to\ndisappear, or laughingly predict that he would soon be getting bald if\nhe wasn't so now.\n\nIn the drawing-room or library, before Vesta and Gerhardt, she was\nnot less loving, though a little more circumspect. She loved odd\npuzzles like pigs in clover, the spider's hole, baby billiards, and\nthe like. Lester shared in these simple amusements. He would work by\nthe hour, if necessary, to make a difficult puzzle come right. Jennie\nwas clever at solving these mechanical problems. Sometimes she would\nhave to show him the right method, and then she would be immensely\npleased with herself. At other times she would stand behind him\nwatching, her chin on his shoulder, her arms about his neck. He seemed\nnot to mind--indeed, he was happy in the wealth of affection she\nbestowed. Her cleverness, her gentleness, her tact created an\natmosphere which was immensely pleasing; above all her youth and\nbeauty appealed to him. It made him feel young, and if there was one\nthing Lester objected to, it was the thought of drying up into an\naimless old age. \"I want to keep young, or die young,\" was one of his\npet remarks; and Jennie came to understand. She was glad that she was\nso much younger now for his sake.\n\nAnother pleasant feature of the home life was Lester's steadily\nincreasing affection for Vesta. The child would sit at the big table\nin the library in the evening conning her books, while Jennie would\nsew, and Gerhardt would read his interminable list of German Lutheran\npapers. It grieved the old man that Vesta should not be allowed to go\nto a German Lutheran parochial school, but Lester would listen to\nnothing of the sort. \"We'll not have any thick-headed German training\nin this,\" he said to Jennie, when she suggested that Gerhardt had\ncomplained. \"The public schools are good enough for any child. You\ntell him to let her alone.\"\n\nThere were really some delightful hours among the four. Lester\nliked to take the little seven-year-old school-girl between his knees\nand tease her. He liked to invert the so-called facts of life, to\npropound its paradoxes, and watch how the child's budding mind took\nthem. \"What's water?\" he would ask; and being informed that it was\n\"what we drink,\" he would stare and say, \"That's so, but what is it?\nDon't they teach you any better than that?\"\n\n\"Well, it is what we drink, isn't it?\" persisted Vesta.\n\n\"The fact that we drink it doesn't explain what it is,\" he would\nretort. \"You ask your teacher what water is\"; and then he would leave\nher with this irritating problem troubling her young soul.\n\nFood, china, her dress, anything was apt to be brought back to its\nchemical constituents, and he would leave her to struggle with these\ndark suggestions of something else back of the superficial appearance\nof things until she was actually in awe of him. She had a way of\nshowing him how nice she looked before she started to school in the\nmorning, a habit that arose because of his constant criticism of her\nappearance. He wanted her to look smart, he insisted on a big bow of\nblue ribbon for her hair, he demanded that her shoes be changed from\nlow quarter to high boots with the changing character of the seasons'\nand that her clothing be carried out on a color scheme suited to her\ncomplexion and disposition.\n\n\"That child's light and gay by disposition. Don't put anything\nsomber on her,\" he once remarked.\n\nJennie had come to realize that he must be consulted in this, and\nwould say, \"Run to your papa and show him how you look.\"\n\nVesta would come and turn briskly around before him, saying,\n\"See.\"\n\n\"Yes. You're all right. Go on\"; and on she would go.\n\nHe grew so proud of her that on Sundays and some week-days when\nthey drove he would always have her in between them. He insisted that\nJennie send her to dancing-school, and Gerhardt was beside himself\nwith rage and grief. \"Such irreligion!\" he complained to Jennie. \"Such\ndevil's fol-de-rol. Now she goes to dance. What for? To make a no-good\nout of her--a creature to be ashamed of?\"\n\n\"Oh no, papa,\" replied Jennie. \"It isn't as bad as that. This is an\nawful nice school. Lester says she has to go.\"\n\n\"Lester, Lester; that man! A fine lot he knows about what is good\nfor a child. A card-player, a whisky-drinker!\"\n\n\"Now, hush, papa; I won't have you talk like that,\" Jennie would\nreply warmly. \"He's a good man, and you know it.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, a good man. In some things, maybe. Not in this. No.\"\n\nHe went away groaning. When Lester was near he said nothing, and\nVesta could wind him around her finger.\n\n\"Oh you,\" she would say, pulling at his arm or rubbing his grizzled\ncheek. There was no more fight in Gerhardt when Vesta did this. He\nlost control of himself--something welled up and choked his\nthroat. \"Yes, I know how you do,\" he would exclaim.\n\nVesta would tweak his ear.\n\n\"Stop now!\" he would say. \"That is enough.\"\n\nIt was noticeable, however, that she did not have to stop unless\nshe herself willed it. Gerhardt adored the child, and she could do\nanything with him; he was always her devoted servitor.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIX\n\n\nDuring this period the dissatisfaction of the Kane family with\nLester's irregular habit of life grew steadily stronger. That it could\nnot help but become an open scandal, in the course of time, was\nsufficiently obvious to them. Rumors were already going about. People\nseemed to understand in a wise way, though nothing was ever said\ndirectly. Kane senior could scarcely imagine what possessed his son to\nfly in the face of conventions in this manner. If the woman had been\nsome one of distinction--some sorceress of the stage, or of the\nworld of art, or letters, his action would have been explicable if not\ncommendable, but with this creature of very ordinary capabilities, as\nLouise had described her, this putty-faced nobody--he could not\npossibly understand it.\n\nLester was his son, his favorite son; it was too bad that he had\nnot settled down in the ordinary way. Look at the women in Cincinnati\nwho knew him and liked him. Take Letty Pace, for instance. Why in the\nname of common sense had he not married her? She was good looking,\nsympathetic, talented. The old man grieved bitterly, and then, by\ndegrees, he began to harden. It seemed a shame that Lester should\ntreat him so. It wasn't natural, or justifiable, or decent. Archibald\nKane brooded over it until he felt that some change ought to be\nenforced, but just what it should be he could not say. Lester was his\nown boss, and he would resent any criticism of his actions.\nApparently, nothing could be done.\n\nCertain changes helped along an approaching denouement. Louise\nmarried not many months after her very disturbing visit to Chicago,\nand then the home property was fairly empty except for visiting\ngrandchildren. Lester did not attend the wedding, though he was\ninvited. For another thing, Mrs. Kane died, making a readjustment of\nthe family will necessary. Lester came home on this occasion, grieved\nto think he had lately seen so little of his mother--that he had\ncaused her so much pain--but he had no explanation to make. His\nfather thought at the time of talking to him, but put it off because\nof his obvious gloom. He went back to Chicago, and there were more\nmonths of silence.\n\nAfter Mrs. Kane's death and Louise's marriage, the father went to\nlive with Robert, for his three grandchildren afforded him his\ngreatest pleasure in his old age. The business, except for the final\nadjustment which would come after his death, was in Robert's hands.\nThe latter was consistently agreeable to his sisters and their\nhusbands and to his father, in view of the eventual control he hoped\nto obtain. He was not a sycophant in any sense of the word, but a\nshrewd, cold business man, far shrewder than his brother gave him\ncredit for. He was already richer than any two of the other children\nput together, but he chose to keep his counsel and to pretend modesty\nof fortune. He realized the danger of envy, and preferred a Spartan\nform of existence, putting all the emphasis on inconspicuous but very\nready and very hard cash. While Lester was drifting Robert was\nworking--working all the time.\n\nRobert's scheme for eliminating his brother from participation in\nthe control of the business was really not very essential, for his\nfather, after long brooding over the details of the Chicago situation,\nhad come to the definite conclusion that any large share of his\nproperty ought not to go to Lester. Obviously, Lester was not so\nstrong a man as he had thought him to be. Of the two brothers, Lester\nmight be the bigger intellectually or\nsympathetically--artistically and socially there was no\ncomparison--but Robert got commercial results in a silent,\neffective way. If Lester was not going to pull himself together at\nthis stage of the game, when would he? Better leave his property to\nthose who would take care of it. Archibald Kane thought seriously of\nhaving his lawyer revise his will in such a way that, unless Lester\nshould reform, he would be cut off with only a nominal income. But he\ndecided to give Lester one more chance--to make a plea, in fact,\nthat he should abandon his false way of living, and put himself on a\nsound basis before the world. It wasn't too late. He really had a\ngreat future. Would he deliberately choose to throw it away? Old\nArchibald wrote Lester that he would like to have a talk with him at\nhis convenience, and within the lapse of thirty-six hours Lester was\nin Cincinnati.\n\n\"I thought I'd have one more talk with you, Lester, on a subject\nthat's rather difficult for me to bring up,\" began the elder Kane.\n\"You know what I'm referring to?\"\n\n\"Yes, I know,\" replied Lester, calmly.\n\n\"I used to think, when I was much younger that my son's matrimonial\nventures would never concern me, but I changed my views on that score\nwhen I got a little farther along. I began to see through my business\nconnections how much the right sort of a marriage helps a man, and\nthen I got rather anxious that my boys should marry well. I used to\nworry about you, Lester, and I'm worrying yet. This recent connection\nyou've made has caused me no end of trouble. It worried your mother up\nto the very last. It was her one great sorrow. Don't you think you\nhave gone far enough with it? The scandal has reached down here. What\nit is in Chicago I don't know, but it can't be a secret. That can't\nhelp the house in business there. It certainly can't help you. The\nwhole thing has gone on so long that you have injured your prospects\nall around, and yet you continue. Why do you?\"\n\n\"I suppose because I love her,\" Lester replied.\n\n\"You can't be serious in that,\" said his father. \"If you had loved\nher, you'd have married her in the first place. Surely you wouldn't\ntake a woman and live with her as you have with this woman for years,\ndisgracing her and yourself, and still claim that you love her. You\nmay have a passion for her, but it isn't love.\"\n\n\"How do you know I haven't married her?\" inquired Lester coolly. He\nwanted to see how his father would take to that idea.\n\n\"You're not serious!\" The old gentleman propped himself up on his\narms and looked at him.\n\n\"No, I'm not,\" replied Lester, \"but I might be. I might marry\nher.\"\n\n\"Impossible!\" exclaimed his father vigorously. \"I can't believe it.\nI can't believe a man of your intelligence would do a thing like that,\nLester. Where is your judgment? Why, you've lived in open adultery\nwith her for years, and now you talk of marrying her. Why, in heaven's\nname, if you were going to do anything like that, didn't you do it in\nthe first place? Disgrace your parents, break your mother's heart,\ninjure the business, become a public scandal, and then marry the cause\nof it? I don't believe it.\"\n\nOld Archibald got up.\n\n\"Don't get excited, father,\" said Lester quickly. \"We won't get\nanywhere that way. I say I might marry her. She's not a bad woman, and\nI wish you wouldn't talk about her as you do. You've never seen her.\nYou know nothing about her.\"\n\n\"I know enough,\" insisted old Archibald, determinedly. \"I know that\nno good woman would act as she has done. Why, man, she's after your\nmoney. What else could she want? It's as plain as the nose on your\nface.\"\n\n\"Father,\" said Lester, his voice lowering ominously, \"why do you\ntalk like that? You never saw the woman. You wouldn't know her from\nAdam's off ox. Louise comes down here and gives an excited report, and\nyou people swallow it whole. She isn't as bad as you think she is, and\nI wouldn't use the language you're using about her if I were you.\nYou're doing a good woman an injustice, and you won't, for some\nreason, be fair.\"\n\n\"Fair! Fair!\" interrupted Archibald. \"Talk about being fair. Is it\nfair to me, to your family, to your dead mother to take a woman of the\nstreets and live with her? Is it--\"\n\n\"Stop now, father,\" exclaimed Lester, putting up his hand. \"I warn\nyou. I won't listen to talk like that. You're talking about the woman\nthat I'm living with--that I may marry. I love you, but I won't\nhave you saying things that aren't so. She isn't a woman of the\nstreets. You know, as well as you know anything, that I wouldn't take\nup with a woman of that kind. We'll have to discuss this in a calmer\nmood, or I won't stay here. I'm sorry. I'm awfully sorry. But I won't\nlisten to any such language as that.\"\n\nOld Archibald quieted himself. In spite of his opposition, he\nrespected his son's point of view. He sat back in his chair and stared\nat the floor. \"How was he to handle this thing?\" he asked himself.\n\n\"Are you living in the same place?\" he finally inquired.\n\n\"No, we've moved out to Hyde Park. I've taken a house out\nthere.\"\n\n\"I hear there's a child. Is that yours?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Have you any children of your own?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Well, that's a God's blessing.\"\n\nLester merely scratched his chin.\n\n\"And you insist you will marry her?\" Archibald went on.\n\n\"I didn't say that,\" replied his son. \"I said I might.\"\n\n\"Might! Might!\" exclaimed his father, his anger bubbling again.\n\"What a tragedy! You with your prospects! Your outlook! How do you\nsuppose I can seriously contemplate entrusting any share of my fortune\nto a man who has so little regard for what the world considers as\nright and proper? Why, Lester, this carriage business, your family,\nyour personal reputation appear to be as nothing at all to you. I\ncan't understand what has happened to your pride. It seems like some\nwild, impossible fancy.\"\n\n\"It's pretty hard to explain, father, and I can't do it very well.\nI simply know that I'm in this affair, and that I'm bound to see it\nthrough. It may come out all right. I may not marry her--I may.\nI'm not prepared now to say what I'll do. You'll have to wait. I'll do\nthe best I can.\"\n\nOld Archibald merely shook his head disapprovingly.\n\n\"You've made a bad mess of this, Lester,\" he said finally. \"Surely\nyou have. But I suppose you are determined to go your way. Nothing\nthat I have said appears to move you.\"\n\n\"Not now, father. I'm sorry.\"\n\n\"Well, I warn you, then, that, unless you show some consideration\nfor the dignity of your family and the honor of your position it will\nmake a difference in my will. I can't go on countenancing this thing,\nand not be a party to it morally and every other way. I won't do it.\nYou can leave her, or you can marry her. You certainly ought to do one\nor the other. If you leave her, everything will be all right. You can\nmake any provision for her you like. I have no objection to that. I'll\ngladly pay whatever you agree to. You will share with the rest of the\nchildren, just as I had planned. If you marry her it will make a\ndifference. Now do as you please. But don't blame me. I love you. I'm\nyour father. I'm doing what I think is my bounden duty. Now you think\nthat over and let me know.\"\n\nLester sighed. He saw how hopeless this argument was. He felt that\nhis father probably meant what he said, but how could he leave Jennie,\nand justify himself to himself? Would his father really cut him off?\nSurely not. The old gentleman loved him even now--he could see\nit. Lester felt troubled and distressed; this attempt at coercion\nirritated him. The idea--he, Lester Kane, being made to do such a\nthing to throw Jennie down. He stared at the floor.\n\nOld Archibald saw that he had let fly a telling bullet.\n\n\"Well,\" said Lester finally, \"there's no use of our discussing it\nany further now--that's certain, isn't it? I can't say what I'll\ndo. I'll have to take time and think. I can't decide this\noffhand.\"\n\nThe two looked at each other. Lester was sorry for the world's\nattitude and for his father's keen feeling about the affair. Kane\nsenior was sorry for his son, but he was determined to see the thing\nthrough. He wasn't sure whether he had converted Lester or not, but he\nwas hopeful. Maybe he would come around yet.\n\n\"Good-by, father,\" said Lester, holding out his hand. \"I think I'll\ntry and make that two-ten train. There isn't anything else you wanted\nto see me about?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\nThe old man sat there after Lester had gone, thinking deeply. What\na twisted career! What an end to great possibilities? What a foolhardy\npersistence in evil and error! He shook his head. Robert was wiser. He\nwas the one to control a business. He was cool and conservative. If\nLester were only like that. He thought and thought. It was a long time\nbefore he stirred. And still, in the bottom of his heart, his erring\nson continued to appeal to him.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XL\n\n\nLester returned to Chicago. He realized that he had offended his\nfather seriously, how seriously he could not say. In all his personal\nrelations with old Archibald he had never seen him so worked up. But\neven now Lester did not feel that the breach was irreparable; he\nhardly realized that it was necessary for him to act decisively if he\nhoped to retain his father's affection and confidence. As for the\nworld at large, what did it matter how much people talked or what they\nsaid. He was big enough to stand alone. But was he? People turn so\nquickly from weakness or the shadow of it. To get away from\nfailure--even the mere suspicion of it--that seems to be a\nsubconscious feeling with the average man and woman; we all avoid\nnon-success as though we fear that it may prove contagious. Lester was\nsoon to feel the force of this prejudice.\n\nOne day Lester happened to run across Berry Dodge, the millionaire\nhead of Dodge, Holbrook & Kingsbury, a firm that stood in the\ndry-goods world, where the Kane Company stood in the carriage world.\nDodge had been one of Lester's best friends. He knew him as intimately\nas he knew Henry Bracebridge, of Cleveland, and George Knowles, of\nCincinnati. He visited at his handsome home on the North Shore Drive,\nand they met constantly in a business and social way. But since Lester\nhad moved out to Hyde Park, the old intimacy had lapsed. Now they came\nface to face on Michigan Avenue near the Kane building.\n\n\"Why, Lester, I'm glad to see you again,\" said Dodge.\n\nHe extended a formal hand, and seemed just a little cool. \"I hear\nyou've gone and married since I saw you.\"\n\n\"No, nothing like that,\" replied Lester, easily, with the air of\none who prefers to be understood in the way of the world sense.\n\n\"Why so secret about it, if you have?\" asked Dodge, attempting to\nsmile, but with a wry twist to the corners of his mouth. He was trying\nto be nice, and to go through a difficult situation gracefully. \"We\nfellows usually make a fuss about that sort of thing. You ought to let\nyour friends know.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Lester, feeling the edge of the social blade that was\nbeing driven into him, \"I thought I'd do it in a new way. I'm not much\nfor excitement in that direction, anyhow.\"\n\n\"It is a matter of taste, isn't it?\" said Dodge a little absently.\n\"You're living in the city, of course?\"\n\n\"In Hyde Park.\"\n\n\"That's a pleasant territory. How are things otherwise?\" And he\ndeftly changed the subject before waving him a perfunctory\nfarewell.\n\nLester missed at once the inquiries which a man like Dodge would\nhave made if he had really believed that he was married. Under\nordinary circumstances his friend would have wanted to know a great\ndeal about the new Mrs. Kane. There would have been all those little\nfamiliar touches common to people living on the same social plane.\nDodge would have asked Lester to bring his wife over to see them,\nwould have definitely promised to call. Nothing of the sort happened,\nand Lester noticed the significant omission.\n\nIt was the same with the Burnham Moores, the Henry Aldriches, and a\nscore of other people whom he knew equally well. Apparently they all\nthought that he had married and settled down. They were interested to\nknow where he was living, and they were rather disposed to joke him\nabout being so very secretive on the subject, but they were not\nwilling to discuss the supposed Mrs. Kane. He was beginning to see\nthat this move of his was going to tell against him notably.\n\nOne of the worst stabs--it was the cruelest because, in a way,\nit was the most unintentional--he received from an old\nacquaintance, Will Whitney, at the Union Club. Lester was dining there\none evening, and Whitney met him in the main reading-room as he was\ncrossing from the cloak-room to the cigar-stand. The latter was a\ntypical society figure, tall, lean, smooth-faced, immaculately garbed,\na little cynical, and to-night a little the worse for liquor. \"Hi,\nLester!\" he called out, \"what's this talk about a menage\nof yours out in Hyde Park? Say, you're going some. How are you going\nto explain all this to your wife when you get married?\"\n\n\"I don't have to explain it,\" replied Lester irritably. \"Why should\nyou be so interested in my affairs? You're not living in a stone\nhouse, are you?\"\n\n\"Say, ha! ha! that's pretty good now, isn't it? You didn't marry\nthat little beauty you used to travel around with on the North Side,\ndid you? Eh, now! Ha, ha! Well, I swear. You married! You didn't, now,\ndid you?\"\n\n\"Cut it out, Whitney,\" said Lester roughly. \"You're talking\nwild.\"\n\n\"Pardon, Lester,\" said the other aimlessly, but sobering. \"I beg\nyour pardon. Remember, I'm just a little warm. Eight whisky-sours\nstraight in the other room there. Pardon. I'll talk to you some time\nwhen I'm all right. See, Lester? Eh! Ha! ha! I'm a little loose,\nthat's right. Well, so long! Ha! ha!\"\n\nLester could not get over that cacophonous \"ha! ha!\" It cut him,\neven though it came from a drunken man's mouth. \"That little beauty\nyou used to travel with on the North Side. You didn't marry her, did\nyou?\" He quoted Whitney's impertinences resentfully. George! But this\nwas getting a little rough! He had never endured anything like this\nbefore--he, Lester Kane. It set him thinking. Certainly he was\npaying dearly for trying to do the kind thing by Jennie.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLI\n\n\nBut worse was to follow. The American public likes gossip about\nwell-known people, and the Kanes were wealthy and socially prominent.\nThe report was that Lester, one of its principal heirs, had married a\nservant girl. He, an heir to millions! Could it be possible? What a\npiquant morsel for the newspapers! Very soon the paragraphs began to\nappear. A small society paper, called the South Side Budget,\nreferred to him anonymously as \"the son of a famous and wealthy\ncarriage manufacturer of Cincinnati,\" and outlined briefly what it\nknew of the story. \"Of Mrs. ----\" it went on, sagely, \"not\nso much is known, except that she once worked in a well-known\nCleveland society family as a maid and was, before that, a\nworking-girl in Columbus, Ohio. After such a picturesque love-affair\nin high society, who shall say that romance is dead?\"\n\nLester saw this item. He did not take the paper, but some kind soul\ntook good care to see that a copy was marked and mailed to him. It\nirritated him greatly, for he suspected at once that it was a scheme\nto blackmail him. But he did not know exactly what to do about it. He\npreferred, of course, that such comments should cease, but he also\nthought that if he made any effort to have them stopped he might make\nmatters worse. So he did nothing. Naturally, the paragraph in the\nBudget attracted the attention of other newspapers. It sounded\nlike a good story, and one Sunday editor, more enterprising than the\nothers, conceived the notion of having this romance written up. A\nfull-page Sunday story with a scare-head such as \"Sacrifices Millions\nfor His Servant Girl Love,\" pictures of Lester, Jennie, the house at\nHyde Park, the Kane manufactory at Cincinnati, the warehouse on\nMichigan Avenue--certainly, such a display would make a\nsensation. The Kane Company was not an advertiser in any daily or\nSunday paper. The newspaper owed him nothing. If Lester had been\nforewarned he might have put a stop to the whole business by putting\nan advertisement in the paper or appealing to the publisher. He did\nnot know, however, and so was without power to prevent the\npublication. The editor made a thorough job of the business. Local\nnewspaper men in Cincinnati, Cleveland, and Columbus were instructed\nto report by wire whether anything of Jennie's history was known in\ntheir city. The Bracebridge family in Cleveland was asked whether\nJennie had ever worked there. A garbled history of the Gerhardts was\nobtained from Columbus. Jennie's residence on the North Side, for\nseveral years prior to her supposed marriage, was discovered and so\nthe whole story was nicely pieced together. It was not the idea of the\nnewspaper editor to be cruel or critical, but rather complimentary.\nAll the bitter things, such as the probable illegitimacy of Vesta, the\nsuspected immorality of Lester and Jennie in residing together as man\nand wife, the real grounds of the well-known objections of his family\nto the match, were ignored. The idea was to frame up a Romeo and\nJuliet story in which Lester should appear as an ardent,\nself-sacrificing lover, and Jennie as a poor and lovely working-girl,\nlifted to great financial and social heights by the devotion of her\nmillionaire lover. An exceptional newspaper artist was engaged to make\nscenes depicting the various steps of the romance and the whole thing\nwas handled in the most approved yellow-journal style. There was a\npicture of Lester obtained from his Cincinnati photographer for a\nconsideration; Jennie had been surreptitiously \"snapped\" by a staff\nartist while she was out walking.\n\nAnd so, apparently out of a clear sky, the story\nappeared--highly complimentary, running over with sugary phrases,\nbut with all the dark, sad facts looming up in the background. Jennie\ndid not see it at first. Lester came across the page accidentally, and\ntore it out. He was stunned and chagrined beyond words. \"To think the\ndamned newspaper would do that to a private citizen who was quietly\nminding his own business!\" he thought. He went out of the house, the\nbetter to conceal his deep inward mortification. He avoided the more\npopulous parts of the town, particularly the down-town section, and\nrode far out on Cottage Grove Avenue to the open prairie. He wondered,\nas the trolley-car rumbled along, what his friends were\nthinking--Dodge, and Burnham Moore, and Henry Aldrich, and the\nothers. This was a smash, indeed. The best he could do was to put a\nbrave face on it and say nothing, or else wave it off with an\nindifferent motion of the hand. One thing was sure--he would\nprevent further comment. He returned to the house calmer, his\nself-poise restored, but he was eager for Monday to come in order that\nhe might get in touch with his lawyer, Mr. Watson. But when he did see\nMr. Watson it was soon agreed between the two men that it would be\nfoolish to take any legal action. It was the part of wisdom to let the\nmatter drop. \"But I won't stand for anything more,\" concluded\nLester.\n\n\"I'll attend to that,\" said the lawyer, consolingly.\n\nLester got up. \"It's amazing--this damned country of ours!\" he\nexclaimed. \"A man with a little money hasn't any more privacy than a\npublic monument.\"\n\n\"A man with a little money,\" said Mr. Watson, \"is just like a cat\nwith a bell around its neck. Every rat knows exactly where it is and\nwhat it is doing.\"\n\n\"That's an apt simile,\" assented Lester, bitterly.\n\nJennie knew nothing of this newspaper story for several days.\nLester felt that he could not talk it over, and Gerhardt never read\nthe wicked Sunday newspapers. Finally, one of Jennie's neighborhood\nfriends, less tactful than the others, called her attention to the\nfact of its appearance by announcing that she had seen it. Jennie did\nnot understand at first. \"A story about me?\" she exclaimed.\n\n\"You and Mr. Kane, yes,\" replied her guest. \"Your love\nromance.\"\n\nJennie colored swiftly. \"Why, I hadn't seen it,\" she said. \"Are you\nsure it was about us?\"\n\n\"Why, of course,\" laughed Mrs. Stendahl. \"How could I be mistaken?\nI have the paper over at the house. I'll send Marie over with it when\nI get back. You look very sweet in your picture.\"\n\nJennie winced.\n\n\"I wish you would,\" she said, weakly.\n\nShe was wondering where they had secured her picture, what the\narticle said. Above all, she was dismayed to think of its effect upon\nLester. Had he seen the article? Why had he not spoken to her about\nit?\n\nThe neighbor's daughter brought over the paper, and Jennie's heart\nstood still as she glanced at the title-page. There it all\nwas--uncompromising and direct. How dreadfully conspicuous the\nheadline--\"This Millionaire Fell in Love With This Lady's Maid,\"\nwhich ran between a picture of Lester on the left and Jennie on the\nright. There was an additional caption which explained how Lester, son\nof the famous carriage family of Cincinnati, had sacrificed great\nsocial opportunity and distinction to marry his heart's desire. Below\nwere scattered a number of other pictures--Lester addressing\nJennie in the mansion of Mrs. Bracebridge, Lester standing with her\nbefore an imposing and conventional-looking parson, Lester driving\nwith her in a handsome victoria, Jennie standing beside the window of\nan imposing mansion (the fact that it was a mansion being indicated by\nmost sumptuous-looking hangings) and gazing out on a very modest\nworking-man's cottage pictured in the distance. Jennie felt as though\nshe must die for very shame. She did not so much mind what it meant to\nher, but Lester, Lester, how must he feel? And his family? Now they\nwould have another club with which to strike him and her. She tried to\nkeep calm about it, to exert emotional control, but again the tears\nwould rise, only this time they were tears of opposition to defeat.\nShe did not want to be hounded this way. She wanted to be let alone.\nShe was trying to do right now. Why couldn't the world help her,\ninstead of seeking to push her down?\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLII\n\n\nThe fact that Lester had seen this page was made perfectly clear to\nJennie that evening, for he brought it home himself, having concluded,\nafter mature deliberation, that he ought to. He had told her once that\nthere was to be no concealment between them, and this thing, coming so\nbrutally to disturb their peace, was nevertheless a case in point. He\nhad decided to tell her not to think anything of it--that it did\nnot make much difference, though to him it made all the difference in\nthe world. The effect of this chill history could never be undone. The\nwise--and they included all his social world and many who were\nnot of it--could see just how he had been living. The article\nwhich accompanied the pictures told how he had followed Jennie from\nCleveland to Chicago, how she had been coy and distant and that he had\nto court her a long time to win her consent. This was to explain their\nliving together on the North Side. Lester realized that this was an\nasinine attempt to sugar-coat the true story and it made him angry.\nStill he preferred to have it that way rather than in some more brutal\nvein. He took the paper out of his pocket when he arrived at the\nhouse, spreading it on the library table. Jennie, who was close by,\nwatched him, for she knew what was coming.\n\n\"Here's something that will interest you, Jennie,\" he said dryly,\npointing to the array of text and pictures.\n\n\"I've already seen it, Lester,\" she said wearily. \"Mrs. Stendahl\nshowed it to me this afternoon. I was wondering whether you had.\"\n\n\"Rather high-flown description of my attitude, isn't it? I didn't\nknow I was such an ardent Romeo.\"\n\n\"I'm awfully sorry, Lester,\" said Jennie, reading behind the dry\nface of humor the serious import of this affair to him. She had long\nsince learned that Lester did not express his real feeling, his big\nills in words. He was inclined to jest and make light of the\ninevitable, the inexorable. This light comment merely meant \"this\nmatter cannot be helped, so we will make the best of it.\"\n\n\"Oh, don't feel badly about it,\" he went on. \"It isn't anything\nwhich can be adjusted now. They probably meant well enough. We just\nhappen to be in the limelight.\"\n\n\"I understand,\" said Jennie, coming over to him. \"I'm sorry,\nthough, anyway.\" Dinner was announced a moment later and the incident\nwas closed.\n\nBut Lester could not dismiss the thought that matters were getting\nin a bad way. His father had pointed it out to him rather plainly at\nthe last interview, and now this newspaper notoriety had capped the\nclimax. He might as well abandon his pretension to intimacy with his\nold world. It would have none of him, or at least the more\nconservative part of it would not. There were a few bachelors, a few\ngay married men, some sophisticated women, single and married, who saw\nthrough it all and liked him just the same, but they did not make\nsociety. He was virtually an outcast, and nothing could save him but\nto reform his ways; in other words, he must give up Jennie once and\nfor all.\n\nBut he did not want to do this. The thought was painful to\nhim--objectionable in every way. Jennie was growing in mental\nacumen. She was beginning to see things quite as clearly as he did.\nShe was not a cheap, ambitious, climbing creature. She was a big woman\nand a good one. It would be a shame to throw her down, and besides she\nwas good-looking. He was forty-six and she was twenty-nine; and she\nlooked twenty-four or five. It is an exceptional thing to find beauty,\nyouth, compatibility, intelligence, your own point of\nview--softened and charmingly emotionalized--in another. He\nhad made his bed, as his father had said. He had better lie on it.\n\nIt was only a little while after this disagreeable newspaper\nincident that Lester had word that his father was quite ill and\nfailing; it might be necessary for him to go to Cincinnati at any\nmoment. Pressure of work was holding him pretty close when the news\ncame that his father was dead. Lester, of course, was greatly shocked\nand grieved, and he returned to Cincinnati in a retrospective and\nsorrowful mood. His father had been a great character to him--a\nfine and interesting old gentleman entirely aside from his\nrelationship to him as his son. He remembered him now dandling him\nupon his knee as a child, telling him stories of his early life in\nIreland, and of his subsequent commercial struggle when he was a\nlittle older, impressing the maxims of his business career and his\ncommercial wisdom on him as he grew to manhood. Old Archibald had been\nradically honest. It was to him that Lester owed his instincts for\nplain speech and direct statement of fact. \"Never lie,\" was\nArchibald's constant, reiterated statement. \"Never try to make a thing\nlook different from what it is to you. It's the breath of\nlife--truth--it's the basis of real worth, while commercial\nsuccess--it will make a notable character of any one who will\nstick to it.\" Lester believed this. He admired his father intensely\nfor his rigid insistence on truth, and now that he was really gone he\nfelt sorry. He wished he might have been spared to be reconciled to\nhim. He half fancied that old Archibald would have liked Jennie if he\nhad known her. He did not imagine that he would ever have had the\nopportunity to straighten things out, although he still felt that\nArchibald would have liked her.\n\nWhen he reached Cincinnati it was snowing, a windy, blustery snow.\nThe flakes were coming down thick and fast. The traffic of the city\nhad a muffled sound. When he stepped down from the train he was met by\nAmy, who was glad to see him in spite of all their past differences.\nOf all the girls she was the most tolerant. Lester put his arms about\nher, and kissed her.\n\n\"It seems like old times to see you, Amy,\" he said, \"your coming to\nmeet me this way. How's the family? I suppose they're all here. Well,\npoor father, his time had to come. Still, he lived to see everything\nthat he wanted to see. I guess he was pretty well satisfied with the\noutcome of his efforts.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Amy, \"and since mother died he was very lonely.\"\n\nThey rode up to the house in kindly good feeling, chatting of old\ntimes and places. All the members of the immediate family, and the\nvarious relatives, were gathered in the old family mansion. Lester\nexchanged the customary condolences with the others, realizing all the\nwhile that his father had lived long enough. He had had a successful\nlife, and had fallen like a ripe apple from the tree. Lester looked at\nhim where he lay in the great parlor, in his black coffin, and a\nfeeling of the old-time affection swept over him. He smiled at the\nclean-cut, determined, conscientious face.\n\n\"The old gentleman was a big man all the way through,\" he said to\nRobert, who was present. \"We won't find a better figure of a man\nsoon.\"\n\n\"We will not,\" said his brother, solemnly.\n\nAfter the funeral it was decided to read the will at once. Louise's\nhusband was anxious to return to Buffalo; Lester was compelled to be\nin Chicago. A conference of the various members of the family was\ncalled for the second day after the funeral, to be held at the offices\nof Messrs. Knight, Keatley & O'Brien, counselors of the late\nmanufacturer.\n\nAs Lester rode to the meeting he had the feeling that his father\nhad not acted in any way prejudicial to his interests. It had not been\nso very long since they had had their last conversation; he had been\ntaking his time to think about things, and his father had given him\ntime. He always felt that he had stood well with the old gentleman,\nexcept for his alliance with Jennie. His business judgment had been\nvaluable to the company. Why should there be any discrimination\nagainst him? He really did not think it possible.\n\nWhen they reached the offices of the law firm, Mr. O'Brien, a\nshort, fussy, albeit comfortable-looking little person, greeted all\nthe members of the family and the various heirs and assigns with a\nhearty handshake. He had been personal counsel to Archibald Kane for\ntwenty years. He knew his whims and idiosyncrasies, and considered\nhimself very much in the light of a father confessor. He liked all the\nchildren, Lester especially.\n\n\"Now I believe we are all here,\" he said, finally, extracting a\npair of large horn reading-glasses from his coat pocket and looking\nsagely about. \"Very well. We might as well proceed to business. I will\njust read the will without any preliminary remarks.\"\n\nHe turned to his desk, picked up a paper lying upon it, cleared his\nthroat, and began.\n\nIt was a peculiar document, in some respects, for it began with all\nthe minor bequests; first, small sums to old employees, servants, and\nfriends. It then took up a few institutional bequests, and finally\ncame to the immediate family, beginning with the girls. Imogene, as a\nfaithful and loving daughter was left a sixth of the stock of the\ncarriage company and a fourth of the remaining properties of the\ndeceased, which roughly aggregated (the estate--not her share)\nabout eight hundred thousand dollars. Amy and Louise were provided for\nin exactly the same proportion. The grandchildren were given certain\nlittle bonuses for good conduct, when they should come of age. Then it\ntook up the cases of Robert and Lester.\n\n\"Owing to certain complications which have arisen in the affairs of\nmy son Lester,\" it began, \"I deem it my duty to make certain\nconditions which shall govern the distribution of the remainder of my\nproperty, to wit: One-fourth of the stock of the Kane Manufacturing\nCompany and one-fourth of the remainder of my various properties,\nreal, personal, moneys, stocks and bonds, to go to my beloved son\nRobert, in recognition of the faithful performance of his duty, and\none-fourth of the stock of the Kane Manufacturing Company and the\nremaining fourth of my various properties, real, personal, moneys,\nstocks and bonds, to be held in trust by him for the benefit of his\nbrother Lester, until such time as such conditions as may hereinafter\nbe set forth shall have been complied with. And it is my wish and\ndesire that my children shall concur in his direction of the Kane\nManufacturing Company, and of such other interests as are entrusted to\nhim, until such time as he shall voluntarily relinquish such control,\nor shall indicate another arrangement which shall be better.\"\n\nLester swore under his breath. His cheeks changed color, but he did\nnot move. He was not inclined to make a show. It appeared that he was\nnot even mentioned separately.\n\nThe conditions \"hereinafter set forth\" dealt very fully with his\ncase, however, though they were not read aloud to the family at the\ntime, Mr. O'Brien stating that this was in accordance with their\nfather's wish. Lester learned immediately afterward that he was to\nhave ten thousand a year for three years, during which time he had the\nchoice of doing either one of two things: First, he was to leave\nJennie, if he had not already married her, and so bring his life into\nmoral conformity with the wishes of his father. In this event Lester's\nshare of the estate was to be immediately turned over to him.\nSecondly, he might elect to marry Jennie, if he had not already done\nso, in which case the ten thousand a year, specifically set aside to\nhim for three years, was to be continued for life--but for his\nlife only. Jennie was not to have anything of it after his death. The\nten thousand in question represented the annual interest on two\nhundred shares of L. S. and M. S. stock which were also to be held in\ntrust until his decision had been reached and their final disposition\neffected. If Lester refused to marry Jennie, or to leave her, he was\nto have nothing at all after the three years were up. At Lester's\ndeath the stock on which his interest was drawn was to be divided pro\nrata among the surviving members of the family. If any heir or assign\ncontested the will, his or her share was thereby forfeited\nentirely.\n\nIt was astonishing to Lester to see how thoroughly his father had\ntaken his case into consideration. He half suspected, on reading these\nconditions, that his brother Robert had had something to do with the\nframing of them, but of course he could not be sure. Robert had not\ngiven any direct evidence of enmity.\n\n\"Who drew this will?\" he demanded of O'Brien, a little later.\n\n\"Well, we all had a hand in it,\" replied O'Brien, a little\nshamefacedly. \"It was a very difficult document to draw up. You know,\nMr. Kane, there was no budging your father. He was adamant. He has\ncome very near defeating his own wishes in some of these clauses. Of\ncourse, you know, we had nothing to do with its spirit. That was\nbetween you and him. I hated very much to have to do it.\"\n\n\"Oh, I understand all that!\" said Lester. \"Don't let that worry\nyou.\"\n\nMr. O'Brien was very grateful.\n\nDuring the reading of the will Lester had sat as stolid as an\nox.\n\nHe got up after a time, as did the others, assuming an air of\nnonchalance. Robert, Amy, Louise and Imogene all felt shocked, but not\nexactly, not unqualifiedly regretful. Certainly Lester had acted very\nbadly. He had given his father great provocation.\n\n\"I think the old gentleman has been a little rough in this,\" said\nRobert, who had been sitting next him. \"I certainly did not expect him\nto go as far as that. So far as I am concerned some other arrangement\nwould have been satisfactory.\"\n\nLester smiled grimly. \"It doesn't matter,\" he said.\n\nImogene, Amy, and Louise were anxious to be consolatory, but they\ndid not know what to say. Lester had brought it all on himself. \"I\ndon't think papa acted quite right, Lester,\" ventured Amy, but Lester\nwaved her away almost gruffly.\n\n\"I can stand it,\" he said.\n\nHe figured out, as he stood there, what his income would be in case\nhe refused to comply with his father's wishes. Two hundred shares of\nL. S. and M. S., in open market, were worth a little over one thousand\neach. They yielded from five to six per cent., sometimes more,\nsometimes less. At this rate he would have ten thousand a year, not\nmore.\n\nThe family gathering broke up, each going his way, and Lester\nreturned to his sister's house. He wanted to get out of the city\nquickly, gave business as an excuse to avoid lunching with any one,\nand caught the earliest train back to Chicago. As he rode he\nmeditated.\n\nSo this was how much his father really cared for him! Could it\nreally be so? He, Lester Kane, ten thousand a year, for only three\nyears, and then longer only on condition that he married Jennie! \"Ten\nthousand a year,\" he thought, \"and that for three years! Good Lord!\nAny smart clerk can earn that. To think he should have done that to\nme!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLIII\n\n\nThis attempt at coercion was the one thing which would definitely\nset Lester in opposition to his family, at least for the time being.\nHe had realized clearly enough of late that he had made a big mistake;\nfirst in not having married Jennie, thus avoiding scandal; and in the\nsecond place in not having accepted her proposition at the time when\nshe wanted to leave him; There were no two ways about it, he had made\na mess of this business. He could not afford to lose his fortune\nentirely. He did not have enough money of his own. Jennie was unhappy,\nhe could see that. Why shouldn't she be? He was unhappy. Did he want\nto accept the shabby ten thousand a year, even if he were willing to\nmarry her? Finally, did he want to lose Jennie, to have her go out of\nhis life once and for all? He could not make up his mind; the problem\nwas too complicated.\n\nWhen Lester returned to his home, after the funeral, Jennie saw at\nonce that something was amiss with him, something beyond a son's\nnatural grief for his father's death was weighing upon his spirits.\nWhat was it, she wondered. She tried to draw near to him\nsympathetically, but his wounded spirit could not be healed so easily.\nWhen hurt in his pride he was savage and sullen--he could have\nstruck any man who irritated him. She watched him interestedly,\nwishing to do something for him, but he would not give her his\nconfidence. He grieved, and she could only grieve with him.\n\nDays passed, and now the financial situation which had been created\nby his father's death came up for careful consideration. The factory\nmanagement had to be reorganized. Robert would have to be made\npresident, as his father wished. Lester's own relationship to the\nbusiness would have to come up for adjudication. Unless he changed his\nmind about Jennie, he was not a stockholder. As a matter of fact, he\nwas not anything. To continue to be secretary and treasurer, it was\nnecessary that he should own at least one share of the company's\nstock. Would Robert give him any? Would Amy, Louise, or Imogene? Would\nthey sell him any? Would the other members of the family care to do\nanything which would infringe on Robert's prerogatives under the will?\nThey were all rather unfriendly to Lester at present, and he realized\nthat he was facing a ticklish situation. The solution was--to get\nrid of Jennie. If he did that he would not need to be begging for\nstock. If he didn't, he was flying in the face of his father's last\nwill and testament. He turned the matter over in his mind slowly and\ndeliberately. He could quite see how things were coming out. He must\nabandon either Jennie or his prospects in life. What a dilemma!\n\nDespite Robert's assertion, that so far as he was concerned another\narrangement would have been satisfactory, he was really very well\npleased with the situation; his dreams were slowly nearing completion.\nRobert had long had his plans perfected, not only for a thorough\nreorganization of the company proper, but for an extension of the\nbusiness in the direction of a combination of carriage companies. If\nhe could get two or three of the larger organizations in the East and\nWest to join with him, selling costs could be reduced, over-production\nwould be avoided, and the general expenses could be materially scaled\ndown. Through a New York representative, he had been picking up stock\nin outside carriage companies for some time and he was almost ready to\nact. In the first place he would have himself elected president of the\nKane Company, and since Lester was no longer a factor, he could select\nAmy's husband as vice-president, and possibly some one other than\nLester as secretary and treasurer. Under the conditions of the will,\nthe stock and other properties set aside temporarily for Lester, in\nthe hope that he would come to his senses, were to be managed and\nvoted by Robert. His father had meant, obviously, that he, Robert,\nshould help him coerce his brother. He did not want to appear mean,\nbut this was such an easy way. It gave him a righteous duty to\nperform. Lester must come to his senses or he must let Robert run the\nbusiness to suit himself.\n\nLester, attending to his branch duties in Chicago, foresaw the\ndrift of things. He realized now that he was permanently out of the\ncompany, a branch manager at his brother's sufferance, and the thought\nirritated him greatly. Nothing had been said by Robert to indicate\nthat such a change had taken place--things went on very much as\nbefore--but Robert's suggestions were now obviously law. Lester\nwas really his brother's employee at so much a year. It sickened his\nsoul.\n\nThere came a time, after a few weeks, when he felt as if he could\nnot stand this any longer. Hitherto he had been a free and independent\nagent. The approaching annual stockholder's meeting which hitherto had\nbeen a one-man affair and a formality, his father doing all the\nvoting, would be now a combination of voters, his brother presiding,\nhis sisters very likely represented by their husbands, and he not\nthere at all. It was going to be a great come-down, but as Robert had\nnot said anything about offering to give or sell him any stock which\nwould entitle him to sit as a director or hold any official position\nin the company, he decided to write and resign. That would bring\nmatters to a crisis. It would show his brother that he felt no desire\nto be under obligations to him in any way or to retain anything which\nwas not his--and gladly so--by right of ability and the\ndesire of those with whom he was associated. If he wanted to move back\ninto the company by deserting Jennie he would come in a very different\ncapacity from that of branch manager. He dictated a simple,\nstraight-forward business letter, saying:\n\n\"DEAR ROBERT, I know the time is drawing near when the company\nmust be reorganized under your direction. Not having any stock, I am\nnot entitled to sit as a director, or to hold the joint position of\nsecretary and treasurer. I want you to accept this letter as formal\nnotice of my resignation from both positions, and I want to have your\ndirectors consider what disposition should be made of this position\nand my services. I am not anxious to retain the branch-managership as\na branch-managership merely; at the same time I do not want to do\nanything which will embarrass you in your plans for the future. You\nsee by this that I am not ready to accept the proposition laid down in\nfather's will--at least, not at present. I would like a definite\nunderstanding of how you feel in this matter. Will you write and let\nme know?\n\n\"Yours,\n\n\"LESTER.\"\n\nRobert, sitting in his office at Cincinnati, considered this letter\ngravely. It was like his brother to come down to \"brass tacks.\" If\nLester were only as cautious as he was straightforward and direct,\nwhat a man he would be! But there was no guile in the man--no\nsubtlety. He would never do a snaky thing--and Robert knew, in\nhis own soul, that to succeed greatly one must. \"You have to be\nruthless at times--you have to be subtle,\" Robert would say to\nhimself. \"Why not face the facts to yourself when you are playing for\nbig stakes?\" He would, for one, and he did.\n\nRobert felt that although Lester was a tremendously decent fellow\nand his brother, he wasn't pliable enough to suit his needs. He was\ntoo outspoken, too inclined to take issue. If Lester yielded to his\nfather's wishes, and took possession of his share of the estate, he\nwould become, necessarily, an active partner in the affairs of the\ncompany. Lester would be a barrier in Robert's path. Did Robert want\nthis? Decidedly he did not. He much preferred that Lester should hold\nfast to Jennie, for the present at least, and so be quietly shelved by\nhis own act.\n\nAfter long consideration, Robert dictated a politic letter. He\nhadn't made up his mind yet just what he wanted to do. He did not know\nwhat his sisters' husbands would like. A consultation would have to be\nheld. For his part, he would be very glad to have Lester remain as\nsecretary and treasurer, if it could be arranged. Perhaps it would be\nbetter to let the matter rest for the present.\n\nLester cursed. What did Robert mean by beating around the bush? He\nknew well enough how it could be arranged. One share of stock would be\nenough for Lester to qualify. Robert was afraid of him--that was\nthe basic fact. Well, he would not retain any branch-managership,\ndepend on that. He would resign at once. Lester accordingly wrote\nback, saying that he had considered all sides, and had decided to look\nafter some interests of his own, for the time being. If Robert could\narrange it, he would like to have some one come on to Chicago and take\nover the branch agency. Thirty days would be time enough. In a few\ndays came a regretful reply, saying that Robert was awfully sorry, but\nthat if Lester was determined he did not want to interfere with any\nplans he might have in view. Imogene's husband, Jefferson Midgely, had\nlong thought he would like to reside in Chicago. He could undertake\nthe work for the time being.\n\nLester smiled. Evidently Robert was making the best of a very\nsubtle situation. Robert knew that he, Lester, could sue and tie\nthings up, and also that he would be very loath to do so. The\nnewspapers would get hold of the whole story. This matter of his\nrelationship to Jennie was in the air, anyhow. He could best solve the\nproblem by leaving her. So it all came back to that.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLIV\n\n\nFor a man of Lester's years--he was now forty-six--to be\ntossed out in the world without a definite connection, even though he\ndid have a present income (including this new ten thousand) of fifteen\nthousand a year, was a disturbing and discouraging thing. He realized\nnow that, unless he made some very fortunate and profitable\narrangements in the near future, his career was virtually at an end.\nOf course he could marry Jennie. That would give him the ten thousand\nfor the rest of his life, but it would also end his chance of getting\nhis legitimate share of the Kane estate. Again, he might sell out the\nseventy-five thousand dollars' worth of moderate interest-bearing\nstocks, which now yielded him about five thousand, and try a practical\ninvestment of some kind--say a rival carriage company. But did he\nwant to jump in, at this stage of the game, and begin a running fight\non his father's old organization? Moreover, it would be a hard row to\nhoe. There was the keenest rivalry for business as it was, with the\nKane Company very much in the lead. Lester's only available capital\nwas his seventy-five thousand dollars. Did he want to begin in a\npicayune, obscure way? It took money to get a foothold in the carriage\nbusiness as things were now.\n\nThe trouble with Lester was that, while blessed with a fine\nimagination and considerable insight, he lacked the ruthless,\nnarrow-minded insistence on his individual superiority which is a\nnecessary element in almost every great business success. To be a\nforceful figure in the business world means, as a rule, that you must\nbe an individual of one idea, and that idea the God-given one that\nlife has destined you for a tremendous future in the particular field\nyou have chosen. It means that one thing, a cake of soap, a new\ncan-opener, a safety razor, or speed-accelerator, must seize on your\nimagination with tremendous force, burn as a raging flame, and make\nitself the be-all and end-all of your existence. As a rule, a man\nneeds poverty to help him to this enthusiasm, and youth. The thing he\nhas discovered, and with which he is going to busy himself, must be\nthe door to a thousand opportunities and a thousand joys. Happiness\nmust be beyond or the fire will not burn as brightly as it\nmight--the urge will not be great enough to make a great\nsuccess.\n\nLester did not possess this indispensable quality of enthusiasm.\nLife had already shown him the greater part of its so-called joys. He\nsaw through the illusions that are so often and so noisily labeled\npleasure. Money, of course, was essential, and he had already had\nmoney--enough to keep him comfortably. Did he want to risk it? He\nlooked about him thoughtfully. Perhaps he did. Certainly he could not\ncomfortably contemplate the thought of sitting by and watching other\npeople work for the rest of his days.\n\nIn the end he decided that he would bestir himself and look into\nthings. He was, as he said to himself, in no hurry; he was not going\nto make a mistake. He would first give the trade, the people who were\nidentified with v he manufacture and sale of carriages, time to\nrealize that he was out of the Kane Company, for the time being,\nanyhow, and open to other connections. So he announced that he was\nleaving the Kane Company and going to Europe, ostensibly for a rest.\nHe had never been abroad, and Jennie, too, would enjoy it. Vesta could\nbe left at home with Gerhardt and a maid, and he and Jennie would\ntravel around a bit, seeing what Europe had to show. He wanted to\nvisit Venice and Baden-Baden, and the great watering-places that had\nbeen recommended to him. Cairo and Luxor and the Parthenon had always\nappealed to his imagination. After he had had his outing he could come\nback and seriously gather up the threads of his intentions.\n\nThe spring after his father died, he put his plan into execution.\nHe had wound up the work of the warerooms and with a pleasant\ndeliberation had studied out a tour. He made Jennie his confidante,\nand now, having gathered together their traveling comforts they took a\nsteamer from New York to Liverpool. After a few weeks in the British\nIsles they went to Egypt. From there they came back, through Greece\nand Italy, into Austria and Switzerland, and then later, through\nFrance and Paris, to Germany and Berlin. Lester was diverted by the\nnovelty of the experience and yet he had an uncomfortable feeling that\nhe was wasting his time. Great business enterprises were not built by\ntravelers, and he was not looking for health.\n\nJennie, on the other hand, was transported by what she saw, and\nenjoyed the new life to the full. Before Luxor and Karnak--places\nwhich Jennie had never dreamed existed--she learned of an older\ncivilization, powerful, complex, complete. Millions of people had\nlived and died here, believing in other gods, other forms of\ngovernment, other conditions of existence. For the first time in her\nlife Jennie gained a clear idea of how vast the world is. Now from\nthis point of view--of decayed Greece, of fallen Rome, of\nforgotten Egypt, she saw how pointless are our minor difficulties, our\nminor beliefs. Her father's Lutheranism--it did not seem so\nsignificant any more; and the social economy of Columbus,\nOhio--rather pointless, perhaps. Her mother had worried so of\nwhat people--her neighbors--thought, but here were dead\nworlds of people, some bad, some good. Lester explained that their\ndifferences in standards of morals were due sometimes to climate,\nsometimes to religious beliefs, and sometimes to the rise of peculiar\npersonalities like Mohammed. Lester liked to point out how small\nconventions bulked in this, the larger world, and vaguely she began to\nsee. Admitting that she had been bad--locally it was important,\nperhaps, but in the sum of civilization, in the sum of big forces,\nwhat did it all amount to? They would be dead after a little while,\nshe and Lester and all these people. Did anything matter except\ngoodness--goodness of heart? What else was there that was\nreal?\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLV\n\n\nIt was while traveling abroad that Lester came across, first at the\nCarlton in London and later at Shepheards in Cairo, the one girl,\nbefore Jennie, whom it might have been said he truly\nadmired--Letty Pace. He had not seen her for a long time, and she\nhad been Mrs. Malcolm Gerald for nearly four years, and a charming\nwidow for nearly two years more. Malcolm Gerald had been a wealthy\nman, having amassed a fortune in banking and stock-brokering in\nCincinnati, and he had left Mrs. Malcolm Gerald very well off. She was\nthe mother of one child, a little girl, who was safely in charge of a\nnurse and maid at all times, and she was invariably the picturesque\ncenter of a group of admirers recruited from every capital of the\ncivilized world. Letty Gerald was a talented woman, beautiful,\ngraceful, artistic, a writer of verse, an omnivorous reader, a student\nof art, and a sincere and ardent admirer of Lester Kane.\n\nIn her day she had truly loved him, for she had been a wise\nobserver of men and affairs, and Lester had always appealed to her as\na real man. He was so sane, she thought, so calm. He was always\nintolerant of sham, and she liked him for it. He was inclined to wave\naside the petty little frivolities of common society conversation, and\nto talk of simple and homely things. Many and many a time, in years\npast, they had deserted a dance to sit out on a balcony somewhere, and\ntalk while Lester smoked. He had argued philosophy with her, discussed\nbooks, described political and social conditions in other\ncities--in a word, he had treated her like a sensible human\nbeing, and she had hoped and hoped and hoped that he would propose to\nher. More than once she had looked at his big, solid head with its\nshort growth of hardy brown hair, and wished that she could stroke it.\nIt was a hard blow to her when he finally moved away to Chicago; at\nthat time she knew nothing of Jennie, but she felt instinctively that\nher chance of winning him was gone.\n\nThen Malcolm Gerald, always an ardent admirer, proposed for\nsomething like the sixty-fifth time, and she took him. She did not\nlove him, but she was getting along, and she had to marry some one. He\nwas forty-four when he married her, and he lived only four\nyears--just long enough to realize that he had married a\ncharming, tolerant, broad-minded woman. Then he died of pneumonia and\nMrs. Gerald was a rich widow, sympathetic, attractive, delightful in\nher knowledge of the world, and with nothing to do except to live and\nto spend her money.\n\nShe was not inclined to do either indifferently. She had long since\nhad her ideal of a man established by Lester. These whipper-snappers\nof counts, earls, lords, barons, whom she met in one social world and\nanother (for her friendship and connections had broadened notably with\nthe years), did not interest her a particle. She was terribly weary of\nthe superficial veneer of the titled fortune-hunter whom she met\nabroad. A good judge of character, a student of men and manners, a\nnatural reasoner along sociologic and psychologic lines, she saw\nthrough them and through the civilization which they represented. \"I\ncould have been happy in a cottage with a man I once knew out in\nCincinnati,\" she told one of her titled women friends who had been an\nAmerican before her marriage. \"He was the biggest, cleanest, sanest\nfellow. If he had proposed to me I would have married him if I had had\nto work for a living myself.\"\n\n\"Was he so poor?\" asked her friend.\n\n\"Indeed he wasn't. He was comfortably rich, but that did not make\nany difference to me. It was the man I wanted.\"\n\n\"It would have made a difference in the long run,\" said the\nother.\n\n\"You misjudge me,\" replied Mrs. Gerald. \"I waited for him for a\nnumber of years, and I know.\"\n\nLester had always retained pleasant impressions and kindly memories\nof Letty Pace, or Mrs. Gerald, as she was now. He had been fond of her\nin a way, very fond. Why hadn't he married her? He had asked himself\nthat question time and again. She would have made him an ideal wife,\nhis father would have been pleased, everybody would have been\ndelighted. Instead he had drifted and drifted, and then he had met\nJennie; and somehow, after that, he did not want her any more. Now\nafter six years of separation he met her again. He knew she was\nmarried. She was vaguely aware he had had some sort of an\naffair--she had heard that he had subsequently married the woman\nand was living on the South Side. She did not know of the loss of his\nfortune. She ran across him first in the Carlton one June evening. The\nwindows were open, and the flowers were blooming everywhere, odorous\nwith that sense of new life in the air which runs through the world\nwhen spring comes back. For the moment she was a little beside\nherself. Something choked in her throat; but she collected herself and\nextended a graceful arm and hand.\n\n\"Why, Lester Kane,\" she exclaimed. \"How do you do! I am so glad.\nAnd this is Mrs. Kane? Charmed, I'm sure. It seems truly like a breath\nof spring to see you again. I hope you'll excuse me, Mrs. Kane, but\nI'm delighted to see your husband. I'm ashamed to say how many years\nit is, Lester, since I saw you last! I feel quite old when I think of\nit. Why, Lester, think; it's been all of six or seven years! And I've\nbeen married and had a child, and poor Mr. Gerald has died, and oh,\ndear, I don't know what all hasn't happened to me.\"\n\n\"You don't look it,\" commented Lester, smiling. He was pleased to\nsee her again, for they had been good friends. She liked him\nstill--that was evident, and he truly liked her.\n\nJennie smiled. She was glad to see this old friend of Lester's.\nThis woman, trailing a magnificent yellow lace train over pale,\nmother-of-pearl satin, her round, smooth arms bare to the shoulder,\nher corsage cut low and a dark red rose blowing at her waist, seemed\nto her the ideal of what a woman should be. She liked looking at\nlovely women quite as much as Lester; she enjoyed calling his\nattention to them, and teasing him, in the mildest way, about their\ncharms. \"Wouldn't you like to run and talk to her, Lester, instead of\nto me?\" she would ask when some particularly striking or beautiful\nwoman chanced to attract her attention. Lester would examine her\nchoice critically, for he had come to know that her judge of feminine\ncharms was excellent. \"Oh, I'm pretty well off where I am,\" he would\nretort, looking into her eyes; or, jestingly, \"I'm not as young as I\nused to be, or I'd get in tow of that.\"\n\n\"Run on,\" was her comment. \"I'll wait for you.\"\n\n\"What would you do if I really should?\"\n\n\"Why, Lester, I wouldn't do anything. You'd come back to me,\nmaybe.\"\n\n\"Wouldn't you care?\"\n\n\"You know I'd care. But if you felt that you wanted to, I wouldn't\ntry to stop you. I wouldn't expect to be all in all to one man, unless\nhe wanted me to be.\"\n\n\"Where do you get those ideas, Jennie?\" he asked her once, curious\nto test the breadth of her philosophy.\n\n\"Oh, I don't know, why?\"\n\n\"They're so broad, so good-natured, so charitable. They're not\ncommon, that's sure.\"\n\n\"Why, I don't think we ought to be selfish, Lester. I don't know\nwhy. Some women think differently, I know, but a man and a woman ought\nto want to live together, or they ought not to--don't you think?\nIt doesn't make so much difference if a man goes off for a little\nwhile--just so long as he doesn't stay--if he wants to come\nback at all.\"\n\nLester smiled, but he respected her for the sweetness of her point\nof view--he had to.\n\nTo-night, when she saw this woman so eager to talk to Lester, she\nrealized at once that they must have a great deal in common to talk\nover; whereupon she did a characteristic thing. \"Won't you excuse me\nfor a little while?\" she asked, smiling. \"I left some things uncared\nfor in our rooms. I'll be back.\"\n\nShe went away, remaining in her room as long as she reasonably\ncould, and Lester and Letty fell to discussing old times in earnest.\nHe recounted as much of his experiences as he deemed wise, and Letty\nbrought the history of her life up to date. \"Now that you're safely\nmarried, Lester,\" she said daringly, \"I'll confess to you that you\nwere the one man I always wanted to have propose to me--and you\nnever did.\"\n\n\"Maybe I never dared,\" he said, gazing into her superb black eyes,\nand thinking that perhaps she might know that he was not married. He\nfelt that she had grown more beautiful in every way. She seemed to him\nnow to be an ideal society figure-perfection itself--gracious,\nnatural, witty, the type of woman who mixes and mingles well, meeting\neach new-comer upon the plane best suited to him or her.\n\n\"Yes, you thought! I know what you thought. Your real thought just\nleft the table.\"\n\n\"Tut, tut, my dear. Not so fast. You don't know what I\nthought.\"\n\n\"Anyhow, I allow you some credit. She's charming.\"\n\n\"Jennie has her good points,\" he replied simply.\n\n\"And are you happy?\"\n\n\"Oh, fairly so. Yes, I suppose I'm happy--as happy as any one\ncan be who sees life as it is. You know I'm not troubled with many\nillusions.\"\n\n\"Not any, I think, kind sir, if I know you.\"\n\n\"Very likely, not any, Letty; but sometimes I wish I had a few. I\nthink I would be happier.\"\n\n\"And I, too, Lester. Really, I look on my life as a kind of\nfailure, you know, in spite of the fact that I'm almost as rich as\nCroesus--not quite. I think he had some more than I have.\"\n\n\"What talk from you--you, with your beauty and talent, and\nmoney--good heavens!\"\n\n\"And what can I do with it? Travel, talk, shoo away silly\nfortune-hunters. Oh, dear, sometimes I get so tired!\"\n\nLetty looked at Lester. In spite of Jennie, the old feeling came\nback. Why should she have been cheated of him? They were as\ncomfortable together as old married people, or young lovers. Jennie\nhad had no better claim. She looked at him, and her eyes fairly spoke.\nHe smiled a little sadly.\n\n\"Here comes my wife,\" he said. \"We'll have to brace up and talk of\nother things. You'll find her interesting--really.\"\n\n\"Yes, I know,\" she replied, and turned on Jennie a radiant\nsmile.\n\nJennie felt a faint sense of misgiving. She thought vaguely that\nthis might be one of Lester's old flames. This was the kind of woman\nhe should have chosen--not her. She was suited to his station in\nlife, and he would have been as happy--perhaps happier. Was he\nbeginning to realize it? Then she put away the uncomfortable thought;\npretty soon she would be getting jealous, and that would be\ncontemptible.\n\nMrs. Gerald continued to be most agreeable in her attitude toward\nthe Kanes. She invited them the next day to join her on a drive\nthrough Rotten Row. There was a dinner later at Claridge's, and then\nshe was compelled to keep some engagement which was taking her to\nParis. She bade them both an affectionate farewell, and hoped that\nthey would soon meet again. She was envious, in a sad way, of Jennie's\ngood fortune. Lester had lost none of his charm for her. If anything,\nhe seemed nicer, more considerate, more wholesome. She wished\nsincerely that he were free. And Lester--subconsciously\nperhaps--was thinking the same thing.\n\nNo doubt because of the fact that she was thinking of it, he had\nbeen led over mentally all of the things which might have happened if\nhe had married her. They were so congenial now, philosophically,\nartistically, practically. There was a natural flow of conversation\nbetween them all the time, like two old comrades among men. She knew\neverybody in his social sphere, which was equally hers, but Jennie did\nnot. They could talk of certain subtle characteristics of life in a\nway which was not possible between him and Jennie, for the latter did\nnot have the vocabulary. Her ideas did not flow as fast as those of\nMrs. Gerald. Jennie had actually the deeper, more comprehensive,\nsympathetic, and emotional note in her nature, but she could not show\nit in light conversation. Actually she was living the thing she was,\nand that was perhaps the thing which drew Lester to her. Just now, and\noften in situations of this kind, she seemed at a disadvantage, and\nshe was. It seemed to Lester for the time being as if Mrs. Gerald\nwould perhaps have been a better choice after all--certainly as\ngood, and he would not now have this distressing thought as to his\nfuture.\n\nThey did not see Mrs. Gerald again until they reached Cairo. In the\ngardens about the hotel they suddenly encountered her, or rather\nLester did, for he was alone at the time, strolling and smoking.\n\n\"Well, this is good luck,\" he exclaimed. \"Where do you come\nfrom?\"\n\n\"Madrid, if you please. I didn't know I was coming until last\nThursday. The Ellicotts are here. I came over with them. You know I\nwondered where you might be. Then I remembered that you said you were\ngoing to Egypt. Where is your wife?\"\n\n\"In her bath, I fancy, at this moment. This warm weather makes\nJennie take to water. I was thinking of a plunge myself.\"\n\nThey strolled about for a time. Letty was in light blue silk, with\na blue and white parasol held daintily over her shoulder, and looked\nvery pretty. \"Oh, dear!\" she suddenly ejaculated, \"I wonder sometimes\nwhat I am to do with myself. I can't loaf always this way. I think\nI'll go back to the States to live.\"\n\n\"Why don't you?\"\n\n\"What good would it do me? I don't want to get married. I haven't\nany one to marry now--that I want.\" She glanced at Lester\nsignificantly, then looked away.\n\n\"Oh, you'll find some one eventually,\" he said, somewhat awkwardly.\n\"You can't escape for long--not with your looks and money.\"\n\n\"Oh, Lester, hush!\"\n\n\"All right! Have it otherwise, if you want. I'm telling you.\"\n\n\"Do you still dance?\" she inquired lightly, thinking of a ball\nwhich was to be given at the hotel that evening. He had danced so well\na few years before.\n\n\"Do I look it?\"\n\n\"Now, Lester, you don't mean to say that you have gone and\nabandoned that last charming art. I still love to dance. Doesn't Mrs.\nKane?\"\n\n\"No, she doesn't care to. At least she hasn't taken it up. Come to\nthink of it, I suppose that is my fault. I haven't thought of dancing\nin some time.\"\n\nIt occurred to him that he hadn't been going to functions of any\nkind much for some time. The opposition his entanglement had generated\nhad put a stop to that.\n\n\"Come and dance with me to-night. Your wife won't object. It's a\nsplendid floor. I saw it this morning.\"\n\n\"I'll have to think about that,\" replied Lester. \"I'm not much in\npractice. Dancing will probably go hard with me at my time of\nlife.\"\n\n\"Oh, hush, Lester,\" replied Mrs. Gerald. \"You make me feel old.\nDon't talk so sedately. Mercy alive, you'd think you were an old\nman!\"\n\n\"I am in experience, my dear.\"\n\n\"Pshaw, that simply makes us more attractive,\" replied his old\nflame.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLVI\n\n\nThat night after dinner the music was already sounding in the\nball-room of the great hotel adjacent to the palm-gardens when Mrs.\nGerald found Lester smoking on one of the verandas with Jennie by his\nside. The latter was in white satin and white slippers, her hair lying\na heavy, enticing mass about her forehead and ears. Lester was\nbrooding over the history of Egypt, its successive tides or waves of\nrather weak-bodied people; the thin, narrow strip of soil along either\nside of the Nile that had given these successive waves of population\nsustenance; the wonder of heat and tropic life, and this hotel with\nits modern conveniences and fashionable crowd set down among ancient,\nsoul-weary, almost despairing conditions. He and Jennie had looked\nthis morning on the pyramids. They had taken a trolley to the Sphinx!\nThey had watched swarms of ragged, half-clad, curiously costumed men\nand boys moving through narrow, smelly, albeit brightly colored, lanes\nand alleys.\n\n\"It all seems such a mess to me,\" Jennie had said at one place.\n\"They are so dirty and oily. I like it, but somehow they seem tangled\nup, like a lot of worms.\"\n\nLester chuckled, \"You're almost right. But climate does it. Heat.\nThe tropics. Life is always mushy and sensual under these conditions.\nThey can't help it.\"\n\n\"Oh, I know that. I don't blame them. They're just queer.\"\n\nTo-night he was brooding over this, the moon shining down into the\ngrounds with an exuberant, sensuous luster.\n\n\"Well, at last I've found you!\" Mrs. Gerald exclaimed. \"I couldn't\nget down to dinner, after all. Our party was so late getting back.\nI've made your husband agree to dance with me, Mrs. Kane,\" she went on\nsmilingly. She, like Lester and Jennie, was under the sensuous\ninfluence of the warmth, the spring, the moonlight. There were rich\nodors abroad, floating subtly from groves and gardens; from the remote\ndistance camel-bells were sounding and exotic cries, \"Ayah!\"\nand \"oosh! oosh!\" as though a drove of strange animals were\nbeing rounded up and driven through the crowded streets.\n\n\"You're welcome to him,\" replied Jennie pleasantly. \"He ought to\ndance. I sometimes wish I did.\"\n\n\"You ought to take lessons right away then,\" replied Lester\ngenially. \"I'll do my best to keep you company. I'm not as light on my\nfeet as I was once, but I guess I can get around.\"\n\n\"Oh, I don't want to dance that badly,\" smiled Jennie. \"But you two\ngo on, I'm going up-stairs in a little while, anyway.\"\n\n\"Why don't you come sit in the ball-room? I can't do more than a\nfew rounds. Then we can watch the others,\" said Lester rising.\n\n\"No. I think I'll stay here. It's so pleasant. You go. Take him,\nMrs. Gerald.\"\n\nLester and Letty strolled away. They made a striking\npair--Mrs. Gerald in dark wine-colored silk, covered with\nglistening black beads, her shapely arms and neck bare, and a flashing\ndiamond of great size set just above her forehead in her dark hair.\nHer lips were red, and she had an engaging smile, showing an even row\nof white teeth between wide, full, friendly lips. Lester's strong,\nvigorous figure was well set off by his evening clothes, he looked\ndistinguished.\n\n\"That is the woman he should have married,\" said Jennie to herself\nas he disappeared. She fell into a reverie, going over the steps of\nher past life. Sometimes it seemed to her now as if she had been\nliving in a dream. At other times she felt as though she were in that\ndream yet. Life sounded in her ears much as this night did. She heard\nits cries. She knew its large-mass features. But back of it were\nsubtleties that shaded and changed one into the other like the\nshifting of dreams. Why had she been so attractive to men? Why had\nLester been so eager to follow her? Could she have prevented him? She\nthought of her life in Columbus, when she carried coal; to-night she\nwas in Egypt, at this great hotel, the chatelaine of a suite of rooms,\nsurrounded by every luxury, Lester still devoted to her. He had\nendured so many things for her! Why? Was she so wonderful? Brander had\nsaid so. Lester had told her so. Still she felt humble, out of place,\nholding handfuls of jewels that did not belong to her. Again she\nexperienced that peculiar feeling which had come over her the first\ntime she went to New York with Lester--namely, that this fairy\nexistence could not endure. Her life was fated. Something would\nhappen. She would go back to simple things, to a side street, a poor\ncottage, to old clothes.\n\nAnd then as she thought of her home in Chicago, and the attitude of\nhis friends, she knew it must be so. She would never be received, even\nif he married her. And she could understand why. She could look into\nthe charming, smiling face of this woman who was now with Lester, and\nsee that she considered her very nice, perhaps, but not of Lester's\nclass. She was saying to herself now no doubt as she danced with\nLester that he needed some one like her. He needed some one who had\nbeen raised in the atmosphere of the things to which he had been\naccustomed. He couldn't very well expect to find in her, Jennie, the\nfamiliarity with, the appreciation of the niceties to, which he had\nalways been accustomed. She understood what they were. Her mind had\nawakened rapidly to details of furniture, clothing, arrangement,\ndecorations, manner, forms, customs, but--she was not to the\nmanner born.\n\nIf she went away Lester would return to his old world, the world of\nthe attractive, well-bred, clever woman who now hung upon his arm. The\ntears came into Jennie's eyes; she wished, for the moment, that she\nmight die. It would be better so. Meanwhile Lester was dancing with\nMrs. Gerald, or sitting out between the waltzes talking over old\ntimes, old places, and old friends. As he looked at Letty he marveled\nat her youth and beauty. She was more developed than formerly, but\nstill as slender and shapely as Diana. She had strength, too, in this\nsmooth body of hers, and her black eyes were liquid and lusterful.\n\n\"I swear, Letty,\" he said impulsively, \"you're really more\nbeautiful than ever. You're exquisite. You've grown younger instead of\nolder.\"\n\n\"You think so?\" she smiled, looking up into his face.\n\n\"You know I do, or I wouldn't say so. I'm not much on\nphilandering.\"\n\n\"Oh, Lester, you bear, can't you allow a woman just a little\ncoyness? Don't you know we all love to sip our praise, and not be\ncompelled to swallow it in one great mouthful?\"\n\n\"What's the point?\" he asked. \"What did I say?\"\n\n\"Oh, nothing. You're such a bear. You're such a big, determined,\nstraightforward boy. But never mind. I like you. That's enough, isn't\nit?\"\n\n\"It surely is,\" he said.\n\nThey strolled into the garden as the music ceased, and he squeezed\nher arm softly. He couldn't help it; she made him feel as if he owned\nher. She wanted him to feel that way. She said to herself, as they sat\nlooking at the lanterns in the gardens, that if ever he were free, and\nwould come to her, she would take him. She was almost ready to take\nhim anyhow--only he probably wouldn't. He was so straight-laced,\nso considerate. He wouldn't, like so many other men she knew, do a\nmean thing. He couldn't. Finally Lester rose and excused himself. He\nand Jennie were going farther up the Nile in the morning--toward\nKarnak and Thebes and the water-washed temples at Phylae. They\nwould have to start at an unearthly early hour, and he must get to\nbed.\n\n\"When are you going home?\" asked Mrs. Gerald, ruefully.\n\n\"In September.\"\n\n\"Have you engaged your passage?\"\n\n\"Yes; we sail from Hamburg on the ninth--the\nFulda.\"\n\n\"I may be going back in the fall,\" laughed Letty. \"Don't be\nsurprised if I crowd in on the same boat with you. I'm very unsettled\nin my mind.\"\n\n\"Come along, for goodness sake,\" replied Lester. \"I hope you do....\nI'll see you to-morrow before we leave.\" He paused, and she looked at\nhim wistfully.\n\n\"Cheer up,\" he said, taking her hand. \"You never can tell what life\nwill do. We sometimes find ourselves right when we thought we were all\nwrong.\"\n\nHe was thinking that she was sorry to lose him, and he was sorry\nthat she was not in a position to have what she wanted. As for\nhimself, he was saying that here was one solution that probably he\nwould never accept; yet it was a solution. Why had he not seen this\nyears before?\n\n\"And yet she wasn't as beautiful then as she is now, nor as wise,\nnor as wealthy.\" Maybe! Maybe! But he couldn't be unfaithful to Jennie\nnor wish her any bad luck. She had had enough without his willing, and\nhad borne it bravely.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLVII\n\n\nThe trip home did bring another week with Mrs. Gerald, for after\nmature consideration she had decided to venture to America for a\nwhile. Chicago and Cincinnati were her destinations, and she hoped to\nsee more of Lester. Her presence was a good deal of a surprise to\nJennie, and it started her thinking again. She could see what the\npoint was. If she were out of the way Mrs. Gerald would marry Lester;\nthat was certain. As it was--well, the question was a complicated\none. Letty was Lester's natural mate, so far as birth, breeding, and\nposition went. And yet Jennie felt instinctively that, on the large\nhuman side, Lester preferred her. Perhaps time would solve the\nproblem; in the mean time the little party of three continued to\nremain excellent friends. When they reached Chicago Mrs. Gerald went\nher way, and Jennie and Lester took up the customary thread of their\nexistence.\n\nOn his return from Europe Lester set to work in earnest to find a\nbusiness opening. None of the big companies made him any overtures,\nprincipally because he was considered a strong man who was looking for\na control in anything he touched. The nature of his altered fortunes\nhad not been made public. All the little companies that he\ninvestigated were having a hand-to-mouth existence, or manufacturing a\nproduct which was not satisfactory to him. He did find one company in\na small town in northern Indiana which looked as though it might have\na future. It was controlled by a practical builder of wagons and\ncarriages--such as Lester's father had been in his day--who,\nhowever, was not a good business man. He was making some small money\non an investment of fifteen thousand dollars and a plant worth, say,\ntwenty-five thousand. Lester felt that something could be done here if\nproper methods were pursued and business acumen exercised. It would be\nslow work. There would never be a great fortune in it. Not in his\nlifetime. He was thinking of making an offer to the small manufacturer\nwhen the first rumors of a carriage trust reached him.\n\nRobert had gone ahead rapidly with his scheme for reorganizing the\ncarriage trade. He showed his competitors how much greater profits\ncould be made through consolidation than through a mutually\ndestructive rivalry. So convincing were his arguments that one by one\nthe big carriage manufacturing companies fell into line. Within a few\nmonths the deal had been pushed through, and Robert found himself\npresident of the United Carriage and Wagon Manufacturers' Association,\nwith a capital stock of ten million dollars, and with assets\naggregating nearly three-fourths of that sum at a forced sale. He was\na happy man.\n\nWhile all this was going forward Lester was completely in the dark.\nHis trip to Europe prevented him from seeing three or four minor\nnotices in the newspapers of some of the efforts that were being made\nto unite the various carriage and wagon manufactories. He returned to\nChicago to learn that Jefferson Midgely, Imogene's husband, was still\nin full charge of the branch and living in Evanston, but because of\nhis quarrel with his family he was in no position to get the news\ndirect. Accident brought it fast enough, however, and that rather\nirritatingly.\n\nThe individual who conveyed this information was none other than\nMr. Henry Bracebridge, of Cleveland, into whom he ran at the Union\nClub one evening after he had been in the city a month.\n\n\"I hear you're out of the old company,\" Bracebridge remarked,\nsmiling blandly.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Lester, \"I'm out.\"\n\n\"What are you up to now?\"\n\n\"Oh, I have a deal of my own under consideration, I'm thinking\nsomething of handling an independent concern.\"\n\n\"Surely you won't run counter to your brother? He has a pretty good\nthing in that combination of his.\"\n\n\"Combination! I hadn't heard of it,\" said Lester. \"I've just got\nback from Europe.\"\n\n\"Well, you want to wake up, Lester,\" replied Bracebridge. \"He's got\nthe biggest thing in your line. I thought you knew all about it. The\nLyman-Winthrop Company, the Myer-Brooks Company, the Woods\nCompany--in fact, five or six of the big companies are all in.\nYour brother was elected president of the new concern. I dare say he\ncleaned up a couple of millions out of the deal.\"\n\nLester stared. His glance hardened a little.\n\n\"Well, that's fine for Robert. I'm glad of it.\"\n\nBracebridge could see that he had given him a vital stab.\n\n\"Well, so long, old man,\" he exclaimed. \"When you're in Cleveland\nlook us up. You know how fond my wife is of you.\"\n\n\"I know,\" replied Lester. \"By-by.\"\n\nHe strolled away to the smoking-room, but the news took all the\nzest out of his private venture. Where would he be with a shabby\nlittle wagon company and his brother president of a carriage trust?\nGood heavens! Robert could put him out of business in a year. Why, he\nhimself had dreamed of such a combination as this. Now his brother had\ndone it.\n\nIt is one thing to have youth, courage, and a fighting spirit to\nmeet the blows with which fortune often afflicts the talented. It is\nquite another to see middle age coming on, your principal fortune\npossibly gone, and avenue after avenue of opportunity being sealed to\nyou on various sides. Jennie's obvious social insufficiency, the\nquality of newspaper reputation which had now become attached to her,\nhis father's opposition and death, the loss of his fortune, the loss\nof his connection with the company, his brother's attitude, this\ntrust, all combined in a way to dishearten and discourage him. He\ntried to keep a brave face--and he had succeeded thus far, he\nthought, admirably, but this last blow appeared for the time being a\nlittle too much. He went home, the same evening that he heard the\nnews, sorely disheartened. Jennie saw it. She realized it, as a matter\nof fact, all during the evening that he was away. She felt blue and\ndespondent herself. When he came home she saw what it\nwas--something had happened to him. Her first impulse was to say,\n\"What is the matter, Lester?\" but her next and sounder one was to\nignore it until he was ready to speak, if ever. She tried not to let\nhim see that she saw, coming as near as she might affectionately\nwithout disturbing him.\n\n\"Vesta is so delighted with herself to-day,\" she volunteered by way\nof diversion. \"She got such nice marks in school.\"\n\n\"That's good,\" he replied solemnly.\n\n\"And she dances beautifully these days. She showed me some of her\nnew dances to-night. You haven't any idea how sweet she looks.\"\n\n\"I'm glad of it,\" he grumbled. \"I always wanted her to be perfect\nin that. It's time she was going into some good girls' school, I\nthink.\"\n\n\"And papa gets in such a rage. I have to laugh. She teases him\nabout it--the little imp. She offered to teach him to dance\nto-night. If he didn't love her so he'd box her ears.\"\n\n\"I can see that,\" said Lester, smiling. \"Him dancing! That's pretty\ngood!\"\n\n\"She's not the least bit disturbed by his storming, either.\"\n\n\"Good for her,\" said Lester. He was very fond of Vesta, who was now\nquite a girl.\n\nSo Jennie tripped on until his mood was modified a little, and then\nsome inkling of what had happened came out. It was when they were\nretiring for the night. \"Robert's formulated a pretty big thing in a\nfinancial way since we've been away,\" he volunteered.\n\n\"What is it?\" asked Jennie, all ears.\n\n\"Oh, he's gotten up a carriage trust. It's something which will\ntake in every manufactory of any importance in the country.\nBracebridge was telling me that Robert was made president, and that\nthey have nearly eight millions in capital.\"\n\n\"You don't say!\" replied Jennie. \"Well, then you won't want to do\nmuch with your new company, will you?\"\n\n\"No; there's nothing in that, just now,\" he said. \"Later on I fancy\nit may be all right. I'll wait and see how this thing comes out. You\nnever can tell what a trust like that will do.\"\n\nJennie was intensely sorry. She had never heard Lester complain\nbefore. It was a new note. She wished sincerely that she might do\nsomething to comfort him, but she knew that her efforts were useless.\n\"Oh, well,\" she said, \"there are so many interesting things in this\nworld. If I were you I wouldn't be in a hurry to do anything, Lester.\nYou have so much time.\"\n\nShe didn't trust herself to say anything more, and he felt that it\nwas useless to worry. Why should he? After all, he had an ample income\nthat was absolutely secure for two years yet. He could have more if he\nwanted it. Only his brother was moving so dazzlingly onward, while he\nwas standing still--perhaps \"drifting\" would be the better word.\nIt did seem a pity; worst of all, he was beginning to feel a little\nuncertain of himself.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLVIII\n\n\nLester had been doing some pretty hard thinking, but so far he had\nbeen unable to formulate any feasible plan for his re-entrance into\nactive life. The successful organization of Robert's carriage trade\ntrust had knocked in the head any further thought on his part of\ntaking an interest in the small Indiana wagon manufactory. He could\nnot be expected to sink his sense of pride and place, and enter a\npetty campaign for business success with a man who was so obviously\nhis financial superior. He had looked up the details of the\ncombination, and he found that Bracebridge had barely indicated how\nwonderfully complete it was. There were millions in the combine. It\nwould have every little manufacturer by the throat. Should he begin\nnow in a small way and \"pike along\" in the shadow of his giant\nbrother? He couldn't see it. It was too ignominious. He would be\nrunning around the country trying to fight a new trust, with his own\nbrother as his tolerant rival and his own rightful capital arrayed\nagainst him. It couldn't be done. Better sit still for the time being.\nSomething else might show up. If not--well, he had his\nindependent income and the right to come back into the Kane Company if\nhe wished. Did he wish? The question was always with him.\n\nIt was while Lester was in this mood, drifting, that he received a\nvisit from Samuel E. Ross, a real estate dealer, whose great, wooden\nsigns might be seen everywhere on the windy stretches of prairie about\nthe city. Lester had seen Ross once or twice at the Union Club, where\nhe had been pointed out as a daring and successful real estate\nspeculator, and he had noticed his rather conspicuous offices at La\nSalle and Washington streets. Ross was a magnetic-looking person of\nabout fifty years of age, tall, black-bearded, black-eyed, an arched,\nwide-nostriled nose, and hair that curled naturally, almost\nelectrically. Lester was impressed with his lithe, cat-like figure,\nand his long, thin, impressive white hands.\n\nMr. Ross had a real estate proposition to lay before Mr. Kane. Of\ncourse Mr. Kane knew who he was. And Mr. Ross admitted fully that he\nknew all about Mr. Kane. Recently, in conjunction with Mr. Norman\nYale, of the wholesale grocery firm of Yale, Simpson & Rice, he\nhad developed \"Yalewood.\" Mr. Kane knew of that?\n\nYes, Mr. Kane knew of that.\n\nOnly within six weeks the last lots in the Ridgewood section of\n\"Yalewood\" had been closed out at a total profit of forty-two per\ncent. He went over a list of other deals in real estate which he had\nput through, all well-known properties. He admitted frankly that there\nwere failures in the business; he had had one or two himself. But the\nsuccesses far outnumbered the bad speculations, as every one knew. Now\nLester was no longer connected with the Kane Company. He was probably\nlooking for a good investment, and Mr. Ross had a proposition to lay\nbefore him. Lester consented to listen, and Mr. Ross blinked his\ncat-like eyes and started in.\n\nThe idea was that he and Lester should enter into a one-deal\npartnership, covering the purchase and development of a forty-acre\ntract of land lying between Fifty-fifth, Seventy-first, Halstead\nstreets, and Ashland Avenue, on the southwest side. There were\nindications of a genuine real estate boom there--healthy,\nnatural, and permanent. The city was about to pave Fifty-fifth Street.\nThere was a plan to extend the Halstead Street car line far below its\npresent terminus. The Chicago, Burlington & Quincy, which ran near\nthere, would be glad to put a passenger station on the property. The\ninitial cost of the land would be forty thousand dollars which they\nwould share equally. Grading, paving, lighting, tree planting,\nsurveying would cost, roughly, an additional twenty-five thousand.\nThere would be expenses for advertising--say ten per cent, of the\ntotal investment for two years, or perhaps three--a total of\nnineteen thousand five hundred or twenty thousand dollars. All told,\nthey would stand to invest jointly the sum of ninety-five thousand, or\npossibly one hundred thousand dollars, of which Lester's share would\nbe fifty thousand. Then Mr. Ross began to figure on the profits.\n\nThe character of the land, its salability, and the likelihood of a\nrise in value could be judged by the property adjacent, the sales that\nhad been made north of Fifty-fifth Street and east of Halstead. Take,\nfor instance, the Mortimer plot, at Halstead and Fifty-fifth streets,\non the south-east corner. Here was a piece of land that in 1882 was\nheld at forty-five dollars an acre. In 1886 it had risen to five\nhundred dollars an acre, as attested by its sale to a Mr. John L.\nSlosson at that time. In 1889, three years later, it had been sold to\nMr. Mortimer for one thousand per acre, precisely the figure at which\nthis tract was now offered. It could be parceled out into lots fifty\nby one hundred feet at five hundred dollars per lot. Was there any\nprofit in that?\n\nLester admitted that there was.\n\nRoss went on, somewhat boastfully, to explain just how real estate\nprofits were made. It was useless for any outsider to rush into the\ngame, and imagine that he could do in a few weeks or years what\ntrained real estate speculators like himself had been working on for a\nquarter of a century. There was something in prestige, something in\ntaste, something in psychic apprehension. Supposing that they went\ninto the deal, he, Ross, would be the presiding genius. He had a\ntrained staff, he controlled giant contractors, he had friends in the\ntax office, in the water office, and in the various other city\ndepartments which made or marred city improvements. If Lester would\ncome in with him he would make him some money--how much he would\nnot say exactly--fifty thousand dollars at the lowest--one\nhundred and fifty to two hundred thousand in all likelihood. Would\nLester let him go into details, and explain just how the scheme could\nbe worked out? After a few days of quiet cogitation, Lester decided to\naccede to Mr. Ross's request; he would look into this thing.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLIX\n\n\nThe peculiarity of this particular proposition was that it had the\nbasic elements of success. Mr. Ross had the experience and the\njudgment which were quite capable of making a success of almost\nanything he undertook. He was in a field which was entirely familiar.\nHe could convince almost any able man if he could get his ear\nsufficiently long to lay his facts before him.\n\nLester was not convinced at first, although, generally speaking, he\nwas interested in real estate propositions. He liked land. He\nconsidered it a sound investment providing you did not get too much of\nit. He had never invested in any, or scarcely any, solely because he\nhad not been in a realm where real estate propositions were talked of.\nAs it was he was landless and, in a way, jobless.\n\nHe rather liked Mr. Ross and his way of doing business. It was easy\nto verify his statements, and he did verify them in several\nparticulars. There were his signs out on the prairie stretches, and\nhere were his ads in the daily papers. It seemed not a bad way at all\nin his idleness to start and make some money.\n\nThe trouble with Lester was that he had reached the time where he\nwas not as keen for details as he had formerly been. All his work in\nrecent years--in fact, from the very beginning--had been\nwith large propositions, the purchasing of great quantities of\nsupplies, the placing of large orders, the discussion of things which\nwere wholesale and which had very little to do with the minor details\nwhich make up the special interests of the smaller traders of the\nworld. In the factory his brother Robert had figured the pennies and\nnickels of labor-cost, had seen to it that all the little leaks were\nshut off. Lester had been left to deal with larger things, and he had\nconsistently done so. When it came to this particular proposition his\ninterest was in the wholesale phases of it, not the petty details of\nselling. He could not help seeing that Chicago was a growing city, and\nthat land values must rise. What was now far-out prairie property\nwould soon, in the course of a few years, be well built-up suburban\nresidence territory. Scarcely any land that could be purchased now\nwould fall in value. It might drag in sales or increase, but it\ncouldn't fall. Ross convinced him of this. He knew it of his own\njudgment to be true.\n\nThe several things on which he did not speculate sufficiently were\nthe life or health of Mr. Ross; the chance that some obnoxious\nneighborhood growth would affect the territory he had selected as\nresidence territory; the fact that difficult money situations might\nreduce real estate values--in fact, bring about a flurry of real\nestate liquidation which would send prices crashing down and cause the\nfailure of strong promoters, even such promoters for instance, as Mr.\nSamuel E. Ross.\n\nFor several months he studied the situation as presented by his new\nguide and mentor, and then, having satisfied himself that he was\nreasonably safe, decided to sell some of the holdings which were\nnetting him a beggarly six per cent, and invest in this new\nproposition. The first cash outlay was twenty thousand dollars for the\nland, which was taken over under an operative agreement between\nhimself and Ross; this was run indefinitely--so long as there was\nany of this land left to sell. The next thing was to raise twelve\nthousand five hundred dollars for improvements, which he did, and then\nto furnish some twenty-five hundred dollars more for taxes and\nunconsidered expenses, items which had come up in carrying out the\nimprovement work which had been planned. It seemed that hard and soft\nearth made a difference in grading costs, that trees would not always\nflourish as expected, that certain members of the city water and gas\ndepartments had to be \"seen\" and \"fixed\" before certain other\nimprovements could be effected. Mr. Ross attended to all this, but the\ncost of the proceedings was something which had to be discussed, and\nLester heard it all.\n\nAfter the land was put in shape, about a year after the original\nconversation, it was necessary to wait until spring for the proper\nadvertising and booming of the new section; and this advertising began\nto call at once for the third payment. Lester disposed of an\nadditional fifteen thousand dollars worth of securities in order to\nfollow this venture to its logical and profitable conclusion.\n\nUp to this time he was rather pleased with his venture. Ross had\ncertainly been thorough and business-like in his handling of the\nvarious details. The land was put in excellent shape. It was given a\nrather attractive title--\"Inwood,\" although, as Lester noted,\nthere was precious little wood anywhere around there. But Ross assured\nhim that people looking for a suburban residence would be attracted by\nthe name; seeing the vigorous efforts in tree-planting that had been\nmade to provide for shade in the future, they would take the will for\nthe deed. Lester smiled.\n\nThe first chill wind that blew upon the infant project came in the\nform of a rumor that the International Packing Company, one of the big\nconstituent members of the packing house combination at Halstead and\nThirty-ninth streets, had determined to desert the old group and lay\nout a new packing area for itself. The papers explained that the\ncompany intended to go farther south, probably below Fifty-fifth\nStreet and west of Ashland Avenue. This was the territory that was\nlocated due west of Lester's property, and the mere suspicion that the\npacking company might invade the territory was sufficient to blight\nthe prospects of any budding real estate deal.\n\nRoss was beside himself with rage. He decided, after quick\ndeliberation, that the best thing to do would be to boom the property\nheavily, by means of newspaper advertising, and see if it could not be\ndisposed of before any additional damage was likely to be done to it.\nHe laid the matter before Lester, who agreed that this would be\nadvisable. They had already expended six thousand dollars in\nadvertising, and now the additional sum of three thousand dollars was\nspent in ten days, to make it appear that In wood was an ideal\nresidence section, equipped with every modern convenience for the\nhome-lover, and destined to be one of the most exclusive and beautiful\nsuburbs of the city. It was \"no go.\" A few lots were sold, but the\nrumor that the International Packing Company might come was persistent\nand deadly; from any point of view, save that of a foreign population\nneighborhood, the enterprise was a failure.\n\nTo say that Lester was greatly disheartened by this blow is to put\nit mildly. Practically fifty thousand dollars, two-thirds of all his\nearthly possessions, outside of his stipulated annual income, was tied\nup here; and there were taxes to pay, repairs to maintain, actual\ndepreciation in value to face. He suggested to Ross that the area\nmight be sold at its cost value, or a loan raised on it, and the whole\nenterprise abandoned; but that experienced real estate dealer was not\nso sanguine. He had had one or two failures of this kind before. He\nwas superstitious about anything which did not go smoothly from the\nbeginning. If it didn't go it was a hoodoo--a black\nshadow--and he wanted no more to do with it. Other real estate\nmen, as he knew to his cost, were of the same opinion.\n\nSome three years later the property was sold under the sheriff's\nhammer. Lester, having put in fifty thousand dollars all told,\nrecovered a trifle more than eighteen thousand; and some of his wise\nfriends assured him that he was lucky in getting off so easily.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER L\n\n\nWhile the real estate deal was in progress Mrs. Gerald decided to\nmove to Chicago. She had been staying in Cincinnati for a few months,\nand had learned a great deal as to the real facts of Lester's\nirregular mode of life. The question whether or not he was really\nmarried to Jennie remained an open one. The garbled details of\nJennie's early years, the fact that a Chicago paper had written him up\nas a young millionaire who was sacrificing his fortune for love of\nher, the certainty that Robert had practically eliminated him from any\nvoice in the Kane Company, all came to her ears. She hated to think\nthat Lester was making such a sacrifice of himself. He had let nearly\na year slip by without doing anything. In two more years his chance\nwould be gone. He had said to her in London that he was without many\nillusions. Was Jennie one? Did he really love her, or was he just\nsorry for her? Letty wanted very much to find out for sure.\n\nThe house that Mrs. Gerald leased in Chicago was a most imposing\none on Drexel Boulevard. \"I'm going to take a house in your town this\nwinter, and I hope to see a lot of you,\" she wrote to Lester. \"I'm\nawfully bored with life here in Cincinnati. After Europe it's\nso--well, you know. I saw Mrs. Knowles on Saturday. She asked\nafter you. You ought to know that you have a loving friend in her. Her\ndaughter is going to marry Jimmy Severance in the spring.\"\n\nLester thought of her coming with mingled feelings of pleasure and\nuncertainty. She would be entertaining largely, of course. Would she\nfoolishly begin by attempting to invite him and Jennie? Surely not.\nShe must know the truth by this time. Her letter indicated as much.\nShe spoke of seeing a lot of him. That meant that Jennie would have to\nbe eliminated. He would have to make a clean breast of the whole\naffair to Letty. Then she could do as she pleased about their future\nintimacy. Seated in Letty's comfortable boudoir one afternoon, facing\na vision of loveliness in pale yellow, he decided that he might as\nwell have it out with her. She would understand. Just at this time he\nwas beginning to doubt the outcome of the real estate deal, and\nconsequently he was feeling a little blue, and, as a concomitant, a\nlittle confidential. He could not as yet talk to Jennie about his\ntroubles.\n\n\"You know, Lester,\" said Letty, by way of helping him to his\nconfession--the maid had brought tea for her and some brandy and\nsoda for him, and departed--\"that I have been hearing a lot of\nthings about you since I've been back in this country. Aren't you\ngoing to tell me all about yourself? You know I have your real\ninterests at heart.\"\n\n\"What have you been hearing, Letty?\" he asked, quietly.\n\n\"Oh, about your father's will for one thing, and the fact that\nyou're out of the company, and some gossip about Mrs. Kane which\ndoesn't interest me very much. You know what I mean. Aren't you going\nto straighten things out, so that you can have what rightfully belongs\nto you? It seems to me such a great sacrifice, Lester, unless, of\ncourse, you are very much in love. Are you?\" she asked archly.\n\nLester paused and deliberated before replying. \"I really don't know\nhow to answer that last question, Letty,\" he said. \"Sometimes I think\nthat I love her; sometimes I wonder whether I do or not. I'm going to\nbe perfectly frank with you. I was never in such a curious position in\nmy life before. You like me so much, and I--well, I don't say\nwhat I think of you,\" he smiled. \"But anyhow, I can talk to you\nfrankly. I'm not married.\"\n\n\"I thought as much,\" she said, as he paused.\n\n\"And I'm not married because I have never been able to make up my\nmind just what to do about it. When I first met Jennie I thought her\nthe most entrancing girl I had ever laid eyes on.\"\n\n\"That speaks volumes for my charms at that time,\" interrupted his\nvis-a-vis.\n\n\"Don't interrupt me if you want to hear this,\" he smiled.\n\n\"Tell me one thing,\" she questioned, \"and then I won't. Was that in\nCleveland?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"So I heard,\" she assented.\n\n\"There was something about her so--\"\n\n\"Love at first sight,\" again interpolated Letty foolishly. Her\nheart was hurting her. \"I know.\"\n\n\"Are you going to let me tell this?\"\n\n\"Pardon me, Lester. I can't help a twinge or two.\"\n\n\"Well, anyhow, I lost my head. I thought she was the most perfect\nthing under the sun, even if she was a little out of my world. This is\na democratic country. I thought that I could just take her, and\nthen--well, you know. That is where I made my mistake. I didn't\nthink that would prove as serious as it did. I never cared for any\nother woman but you before and--I'll be frank--I didn't know\nwhether I wanted to marry you. I thought I didn't want to marry any\nwoman. I said to myself that I could just take Jennie, and then, after\na while, when things had quieted down some, we could separate. She\nwould be well provided for. I wouldn't care very much. She wouldn't\ncare. You understand.\"\n\n\"Yes, I understand,\" replied his confessor.\n\n\"Well, you see, Letty, it hasn't worked out that way. She's a woman\nof a curious temperament. She possesses a world of feeling and\nemotion. She's not educated in the sense in which we understand that\nword, but she has natural refinement and tact. She's a good\nhousekeeper. She's an ideal mother. She's the most affectionate\ncreature under the sun. Her devotion to her mother and father was\nbeyond words. Her love for her--daughter she's hers, not\nmine--is perfect. She hasn't any of the graces of the smart\nsociety woman. She isn't quick at repartee. She can't join in any\nrapid-fire conversation. She thinks rather slowly, I imagine. Some of\nher big thoughts never come to the surface at all, but you can feel\nthat she is thinking and that she is feeling.\"\n\n\"You pay her a lovely tribute, Lester,\" said Letty.\n\n\"I ought to,\" he replied. \"She's a good woman, Letty; but, for all\nthat I have said, I sometimes think that it's only sympathy that's\nholding me.\"\n\n\"Don't be too sure,\" she said warningly.\n\n\"Yes, but I've gone through with a great deal. The thing for me to\nhave done was to have married her in the first place. There have been\nso many entanglements since, so much rowing and discussion, that I've\nrather lost my bearings. This will of father's complicates matters. I\nstand to lose eight hundred thousand if I marry her--really, a\ngreat deal more, now that the company has been organized into a trust.\nI might better say two millions. If I don't marry her, I lose\neverything outright in about two more years. Of course, I might\npretend that I have separated from her, but I don't care to lie. I\ncan't work it out that way without hurting her feelings, and she's\nbeen the soul of devotion. Right down in my heart, at this minute, I\ndon't know whether I want to give her up. Honestly, I don't know what\nthe devil to do.\"\n\nLester looked, lit a cigar in a far-off, speculative fashion, and\nlooked out of the window.\n\n\"Was there ever such a problem?\" questioned Letty, staring at the\nfloor. She rose, after a few moments of silence, and put her hands on\nhis round, solid head. Her yellow, silken house-gown, faintly scented,\ntouched his shoulders. \"Poor Lester,\" she said. \"You certainly have\ntied yourself up in a knot. But it's a Gordian knot, my dear, and it\nwill have to be cut. Why don't you discuss this whole thing with her,\njust as you have with me, and see how she feels about it?\"\n\n\"It seems such an unkind thing to do,\" he replied.\n\n\"You must take some action, Lester dear,\" she insisted. \"You can't\njust drift. You are doing yourself such a great injustice. Frankly, I\ncan't advise you to marry her; and I'm not speaking for myself in\nthat, though I'll take you gladly, even if you did forsake me in the\nfirst place. I'll be perfectly honest--whether you ever come to\nme or not--I love you, and always shall love you.\"\n\n\"I know it,\" said Lester, getting up. He took her hands in his, and\nstudied her face curiously. Then he turned away. Letty paused to get\nher breath. His action discomposed her.\n\n\"But you're too big a man, Lester, to settle down on ten thousand a\nyear,\" she continued. \"You're too much of a social figure to drift.\nYou ought to get back into the social and financial world where you\nbelong. All that's happened won't injure you, if you reclaim your\ninterest in the company. You can dictate your own terms. And if you\ntell her the truth she won't object, I'm sure. If she cares for you,\nas you think she does, she will be glad to make this sacrifice. I'm\npositive of that. You can provide for her handsomely, of course.\"\n\n\"It isn't the money that Jennie wants,\" said Lester, gloomily.\n\n\"Well, even if it isn't, she can live without you and she can live\nbetter for having an ample income.\"\n\n\"She will never want if I can help it,\" he said solemnly.\n\n\"You must leave her,\" she urged, with a new touch of decisiveness.\n\"You must. Every day is precious with you, Lester! Why don't you make\nup your mind to act at once--to-day, for that matter? Why\nnot?\"\n\n\"Not so fast,\" he protested. \"This is a ticklish business. To tell\nyou the truth, I hate to do it. It seems so brutal--so unfair.\nI'm not one to run around and discuss my affairs with other people.\nI've refused to talk about this to any one heretofore--my father,\nmy mother, any one. But somehow you have always seemed closer to me\nthan any one else, and, since I met you this time, I have felt as\nthough I ought to explain--I have really wanted to. I care for\nyou. I don't know whether you understand how that can be under the\ncircumstances. But I do. You're nearer to me intellectually and\nemotionally than I thought you were. Don't frown. You want the truth,\ndon't you? Well, there you have it. Now explain me to myself, if you\ncan.\"\n\n\"I don't want to argue with you, Lester,\" she said softly, laying\nher hand on his arm. \"I merely want to love you. I understand quite\nwell how it has all come about. I'm sorry for myself. I'm sorry for\nyou. I'm sorry--\" she hesitated--\"for Mrs. Kane. She's a\ncharming woman. I like her. I really do. But she isn't the woman for\nyou, Lester; she really isn't. You need another type. It seems so\nunfair for us two to discuss her in this way, but really it isn't. We\nall have to stand on our merits. And I'm satisfied, if the facts in\nthis case were put before her, as you have put them before me, she\nwould see just how it all is, and agree. She can't want to harm you.\nWhy, Lester, if I were in her position I would let you go. I would,\ntruly. I think you know that I would. Any good woman would. It would\nhurt me, but I'd do it. It will hurt her, but she'll do it. Now, mark\nyou my words, she will. I think I understand her as well as you\ndo--better--for I am a woman. Oh,\" she said, pausing, \"I\nwish I were in a position to talk to her. I could make her\nunderstand.\"\n\nLester looked at Letty, wondering at her eagerness. She was\nbeautiful, magnetic, immensely worth while.\n\n\"Not so fast,\" he repeated. \"I want to think about this. I have\nsome time yet.\"\n\nShe paused, a little crestfallen but determined.\n\n\"This is the time to act,\" she repeated, her whole soul in her\neyes. She wanted this man, and she was not ashamed to let him see that\nshe wanted him.\n\n\"Well, I'll think of it,\" he said uneasily, then, rather hastily,\nhe bade her good-by and went away.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LI\n\n\nLester had thought of his predicament earnestly enough, and he\nwould have been satisfied to act soon if it had not been that one of\nthose disrupting influences which sometimes complicate our affairs\nentered into his Hyde Park domicile. Gerhardt's health began rapidly\nto fail.\n\nLittle by little he had been obliged to give up his various duties\nabout the place; finally he was obliged to take to his bed. He lay in\nhis room, devotedly attended by Jennie and visited constantly by\nVesta, and occasionally by Lester. There was a window not far from his\nbed, which commanded a charming view of the lawn and one of the\nsurrounding streets, and through this he would gaze by the hour,\nwondering how the world was getting on without him. He suspected that\nWoods, the coachman, was not looking after the horses and harnesses as\nwell as he should, that the newspaper carrier was getting negligent in\nhis delivery of the papers, that the furnace man was wasting coal, or\nwas not giving them enough heat. A score of little petty worries,\nwhich were nevertheless real enough to him. He knew how a house should\nbe kept. He was always rigid in his performance of his self-appointed\nduties, and he was so afraid that things would not go right. Jennie\nmade for him a most imposing and sumptuous dressing-gown of basted\nwool, covered with dark-blue silk, and bought him a pair of soft,\nthick, wool slippers to match, but he did not wear them often. He\npreferred to lie in bed, read his Bible and the Lutheran papers, and\nask Jennie how things were getting along.\n\n\"I want you should go down in the basement and see what that feller\nis doing. He's not giving us any heat,\" he would complain. \"I bet I\nknow what he does. He sits down there and reads, and then he forgets\nwhat the fire is doing until it is almost out. The beer is right there\nwhere he can take it. You should lock it up. You don't know what kind\nof a man he is. He may be no good.\"\n\nJennie would protest that the house was fairly comfortable, that\nthe man was a nice, quiet, respectable-looking American--that if\nhe did drink a little beer it would not matter. Gerhardt would\nimmediately become incensed.\n\n\"That is always the way,\" he declared vigorously. \"You have no\nsense of economy. You are always so ready to let things go if I am not\nthere. He is a nice man! How do you know he is a nice man? Does he\nkeep the fire up? No! Does he keep the walks clean? If you don't watch\nhim he will be just like the others, no good. You should go around and\nsee how things are for yourself.\"\n\n\"All right, papa,\" she would reply in a genial effort to soothe\nhim, \"I will. Please don't worry. I'll lock up the beer. Don't you\nwant a cup of coffee now and some toast?\"\n\n\"No,\" Gerhardt would sigh immediately, \"my stomach it don't do\nright. I don't know how I am going to come out of this.\"\n\nDr. Makin, the leading physician of the vicinity, and a man of\nconsiderable experience and ability, called at Jennie's request and\nsuggested a few simple things--hot milk, a wine tonic, rest, but\nhe told Jennie that she must not expect too much. \"You know he is\nquite well along in years now. He is quite feeble. If he were twenty\nyears younger we might do a great deal for him. As it is he is quite\nwell off where he is. He may live for some time. He may get up and be\naround again, and then he may not. We must all expect these things. I\nhave never any care as to what may happen to me. I am too old\nmyself.\"\n\nJennie felt sorry to think that her father might die, but she was\npleased to think that if he must it was going to be under such\ncomfortable circumstances. Here at least he could have every care.\n\nIt soon became evident that this was Gerhardt's last illness, and\nJennie thought it her duty to communicate with her brothers and\nsisters. She wrote Bass that his father was not well, and had a letter\nfrom him saying that he was very busy and couldn't come on unless the\ndanger was an immediate one. He went on to say that George was in\nRochester, working for a wholesale wall-paper house--the\nSheff-Jefferson Company, he thought. Martha and her husband had gone\nto Boston. Her address was a little suburb named Belmont, just outside\nthe city. William was in Omaha, working for a local electric company.\nVeronica was married to a man named Albert Sheridan, who was connected\nwith a wholesale drug company in Cleveland. \"She never comes to see\nme,\" complained Bass, \"but I'll let her know.\" Jennie wrote each one\npersonally. From Veronica and Martha she received brief replies. They\nwere very sorry, and would she let them know if anything happened.\nGeorge wrote that he could not think of coming to Chicago unless his\nfather was very ill indeed, but that he would like to be informed from\ntime to time how he was getting along. William, as he told Jennie some\ntime afterward, did not get her letter.\n\nThe progress of the old German's malady toward final dissolution\npreyed greatly on Jennie's mind; for, in spite of the fact that they\nhad been so far apart in times past, they had now grown very close\ntogether. Gerhardt had come to realize clearly that his outcast\ndaughter was goodness itself--at least, so far as he was\nconcerned. She never quarreled with him, never crossed him in any way.\nNow that he was sick, she was in and out of his room a dozen times in\nan evening or an afternoon, seeing whether he was \"all right,\" asking\nhow he liked his breakfast, or his lunch, or his dinner. As he grew\nweaker she would sit by him and read, or do her sewing in his room.\nOne day when she was straightening his pillow he took her hand and\nkissed it. He was feeling very weak--and despondent. She looked\nup in astonishment, a lump in her throat. There were tears in his\neyes.\n\n\"You're a good girl, Jennie,\" he said brokenly. \"You've been good\nto me. I've been hard and cross, but I'm an old man. You forgive me,\ndon't you?\"\n\n\"Oh, papa, please don't,\" she pleaded, tears welling from her eyes.\n\"You know I have nothing to forgive. I'm the one who has been all\nwrong.\"\n\n\"No, no,\" he said; and she sank down on her knees beside him and\ncried. He put his thin, yellow hand on her hair. \"There, there,\" he\nsaid brokenly, \"I understand a lot of things I didn't. We get wiser as\nwe get older.\"\n\nShe left the room, ostensibly to wash her face and hands, and cried\nher eyes out. Was he really forgiving her at last? And she had lied to\nhim so! She tried to be more attentive, but that was impossible. But\nafter this reconciliation he seemed happier and more contented, and\nthey spent a number of happy hours together, just talking. Once he\nsaid to her, \"You know I feel just like I did when I was a boy. If it\nwasn't for my bones I could get up and dance on the grass.\"\n\nJennie fairly smiled and sobbed in one breath. \"You'll get\nstronger, papa,\" she said. \"You're going to get well. Then I'll take\nyou out driving.\" She was so glad she had been able to make him\ncomfortable these last few years.\n\nAs for Lester, he was affectionate and considerate.\n\n\"Well, how is it to-night?\" he would ask the moment he entered the\nhouse, and he would always drop in for a few minutes before dinner to\nsee how the old man was getting along. \"He looks pretty well,\" he\nwould tell Jennie. \"He's apt to live some time yet. I wouldn't\nworry.\"\n\nVesta also spent much time with her grandfather, for she had come\nto love him dearly. She would bring her books, if it didn't disturb\nhim too much, and recite some of her lessons, or she would leave his\ndoor open, and play for him on the piano. Lester had bought her a\nhandsome music-box also, which she would sometimes carry to his room\nand play for him. At times he wearied of everything and everybody save\nJennie; he wanted to be alone with her. She would sit beside him quite\nstill and sew. She could see plainly that the end was only a little\nway off.\n\nGerhardt, true to his nature, took into consideration all the\nvarious arrangements contingent upon his death. He wished to be buried\nin the little Lutheran cemetery, which was several miles farther out\non the South Side, and he wanted the beloved minister of his church to\nofficiate.\n\n\"I want everything plain,\" he said. \"Just my black suit and those\nSunday shoes of mine, and that black string tie. I don't want anything\nelse. I will be all right.\"\n\nJennie begged him not to talk of it, but he would. One day at four\no'clock he had a sudden sinking spell, and at five he was dead. Jennie\nheld his hands, watching his labored breathing; once or twice he\nopened his eyes to smile at her. \"I don't mind going,\" he said, in\nthis final hour. \"I've done what I could.\"\n\n\"Don't talk of dying, papa,\" she pleaded.\n\n\"It's the end,\" he said. \"You've been good to me. You're a good\nwoman.\"\n\nShe heard no other words from his lips.\n\nThe finish which time thus put to this troubled life affected\nJennie deeply. Strong in her kindly, emotional relationships, Gerhardt\nhad appealed to her not only as her father, but as a friend and\ncounselor. She saw him now in his true perspective, a hard-working,\nhonest, sincere old German, who had done his best to raise a\ntroublesome family and lead an honest life. Truly she had been his one\ngreat burden, and she had never really dealt truthfully with him to\nthe end. She wondered now if where he was he could see that she had\nlied. And would he forgive her? He had called her a good woman.\n\nTelegrams were sent to all the children. Bass wired that he was\ncoming, and arrived the next day. The others wired that they could not\ncome, but asked for details, which Jennie wrote. The Lutheran minister\nwas called in to say prayers and fix the time of the burial service. A\nfat, smug undertaker was commissioned to arrange all the details. Some\nfew neighborhood friends called--those who had remained most\nfaithful--and on the second morning following his death the\nservices were held. Lester accompanied Jennie and Vesta and Bass to\nthe little red brick Lutheran church, and sat stolidly through the\nrather dry services. He listened wearily to the long discourse on the\nbeauties and rewards of a future life and stirred irritably when\nreference was made to a hell. Bass was rather bored, but considerate.\nHe looked upon his father now much as he would on any other man. Only\nJennie wept sympathetically. She saw her father in perspective, the\nlong years of trouble he had had, the days in which he had had to saw\nwood for a living, the days in which he had lived in a factory loft,\nthe little shabby house they had been compelled to live in in\nThirteenth Street, the terrible days of suffering they had spent in\nLorrie Street, in Cleveland, his grief over her, his grief over Mrs.\nGerhardt, his love and care of Vesta, and finally these last days.\n\n\"Oh, he was a good man,\" she thought. \"He meant so well.\" They sang\na hymn, \"A Mighty Fortress Is Our God,\" and then she sobbed.\n\nLester pulled at her arm. He was moved to the danger-line himself\nby her grief. \"You'll have to do better than this,\" he whispered. \"My\nGod, I can't stand it. I'll have to get up and get out.\" Jennie\nquieted a little, but the fact that the last visible ties were being\nbroken between her and her father was almost too much.\n\nAt the grave in the Cemetery of the Redeemer, where Lester had\nimmediately arranged to purchase a lot, they saw the plain coffin\nlowered and the earth shoveled in. Lester looked curiously at the bare\ntrees, the brown dead grass, and the brown soil of the prairie turned\nup at this simple graveside. There was no distinction to this burial\nplot. It was commonplace and shabby, a working-man's resting-place,\nbut so long as he wanted it, it was all right. He studied Bass's keen,\nlean face, wondering what sort of a career he was cutting out for\nhimself. Bass looked to him like some one who would run a cigar store\nsuccessfully. He watched Jennie wiping her red eyes, and then he said\nto himself again, \"Well, there is something to her.\" The woman's\nemotion was so deep, so real. \"There's no explaining a good woman,\" he\nsaid to himself.\n\nOn the way home, through the wind-swept, dusty streets, he talked\nof life in general, Bass and Vesta being present. \"Jennie takes things\ntoo seriously,\" he said. \"She's inclined to be morbid. Life isn't as\nbad as she makes out with her sensitive feelings. We all have our\ntroubles, and we all have to stand them, some more, some less. We\ncan't assume that any one is so much better or worse off than any one\nelse. We all have our share of troubles.\"\n\n\"I can't help it,\" said Jennie. \"I feel so sorry for some\npeople.\"\n\n\"Jennie always was a little gloomy,\" put in Bass.\n\nHe was thinking what a fine figure of a man Lester was, how\nbeautifully they lived, how Jennie had come up in the world. He was\nthinking that there must be a lot more to her than he had originally\nthought. Life surely did turn out queer. At one time he thought Jennie\nwas a hopeless failure and no good.\n\n\"You ought to try to steel yourself to take things as they come\nwithout going to pieces this way,\" said Lester finally.\n\nBass thought so too.\n\nJennie stared thoughtfully out of the carriage window. There was\nthe old house now, large and silent without Gerhardt. Just think, she\nwould never see him any more. They finally turned into the drive and\nentered the library. Jeannette, nervous and sympathetic, served tea.\nJennie went to look after various details. She wondered curiously\nwhere she would be when she died.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LII\n\n\nThe fact that Gerhardt was dead made no particular difference to\nLester, except as it affected Jennie. He had liked the old German for\nhis many sterling qualities, but beyond that he thought nothing of him\none way or the other. He took Jennie to a watering-place for ten days\nto help her recover her spirits, and it was soon after this that he\ndecided to tell her just how things stood with him; he would put the\nproblem plainly before her. It would be easier now, for Jennie had\nbeen informed of the disastrous prospects of the real-estate deal. She\nwas also aware of his continued interest in Mrs. Gerald. Lester did\nnot hesitate to let Jennie know that he was on very friendly terms\nwith her. Mrs. Gerald had, at first, formally requested him to bring\nJennie to see her, but she never had called herself, and Jennie\nunderstood quite clearly that it was not to be. Now that her father\nwas dead, she was beginning to wonder what was going to become of her;\nshe was afraid that Lester might not marry her. Certainly he showed no\nsigns of intending to do so.\n\nBy one of those curious coincidences of thought, Robert also had\nreached the conclusion that something should be done. He did not, for\none moment, imagine that he could directly work upon Lester--he\ndid not care to try--but he did think that some influence might\nbe brought to bear on Jennie. She was probably amenable to reason. If\nLester had not married her already, she must realize full well that he\ndid not intend to do so. Suppose that some responsible third person\nwere to approach her, and explain how things were, including, of\ncourse, the offer of an independent income? Might she not be willing\nto leave Lester, and end all this trouble? After all, Lester was his\nbrother, and he ought not to lose his fortune. Robert had things very\nmuch in his own hands now, and could afford to be generous. He finally\ndecided that Mr. O'Brien, of Knight, Keatley & O'Brien, would be\nthe proper intermediary, for O'Brien was suave, good-natured, and\nwell-meaning, even if he was a lawyer. He might explain to Jennie very\ndelicately just how the family felt, and how much Lester stood to lose\nif he continued to maintain his connection with her. If Lester had\nmarried Jennie, O'Brien would find it out. A liberal provision would\nbe made for her--say fifty or one hundred thousand, or even one\nhundred and fifty thousand dollars. He sent for Mr. O'Brien and gave\nhim his instructions. As one of the executors of Archibald Kane's\nestate, it was really the lawyer's duty to look into the matter of\nLester's ultimate decision.\n\nMr. O'Brien journeyed to Chicago. On reaching the city, he called\nup Lester, and found out to his satisfaction that he was out of town\nfor the day. He went out to the house in Hyde Park, and sent in his\ncard to Jennie. She came down-stairs in a few minutes quite\nunconscious of the import of his message; he greeted her most\nblandly.\n\n\"This is Mrs. Kane?\" he asked, with an interlocutory jerk of his\nhead.\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Jennie.\n\n\"I am, as you see by my card, Mr. O'Brien, of Knight, Keatley &\nO'Brien,\" he began. \"We are the attorneys and executors of the late\nMr. Kane, your--ah--Mr. Kane's father. You'll think it's\nrather curious, my coming to you, but under your husband's father's\nwill there were certain conditions stipulated which affect you and Mr.\nKane very materially. These provisions are so important that I think\nyou ought to know about them--that is if Mr. Kane hasn't already\ntold you. I--pardon me--but the peculiar nature of them\nmakes me conclude that--possibly--he hasn't.\" He paused, a\nvery question-mark of a man--every feature of his face an\ninterrogation.\n\n\"I don't quite understand,\" said Jennie. \"I don't know anything\nabout the will. If there's anything that I ought to know, I suppose\nMr. Kane will tell me. He hasn't told me anything as yet.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" breathed Mr. O'Brien, highly gratified. \"Just as I thought.\nNow, if you will allow me I'll go into the matter briefly. Then you\ncan judge for yourself whether you wish to hear the full particulars.\nWon't you sit down?\" They had both been standing. Jennie seated\nherself, and Mr. O'Brien pulled up a chair near to hers.\n\n\"Now to begin,\" he said. \"I need not say to you, of course, that\nthere was considerable opposition on the part of Mr. Kane's father, to\nthis--ah--union between yourself and his son.\"\n\n\"I know--\" Jennie started to say, but checked herself. She was\npuzzled, disturbed, and a little apprehensive.\n\n\"Before Mr. Kane senior died,\" he went on, \"he indicated to\nyour--ah--to Mr. Lester Kane, that he felt this way. In his\nwill he made certain conditions governing the distribution of his\nproperty which made it rather hard for his son,\nyour--ah--husband, to come into his rightful share.\nOrdinarily, he would have inherited one-fourth of the Kane\nManufacturing Company, worth to-day in the neighborhood of a million\ndollars, perhaps more; also one-fourth of the other properties, which\nnow aggregate something like five hundred thousand dollars. I believe\nMr. Kane senior was really very anxious that his son should inherit\nthis property. But owing to the conditions which\nyour--ah--which Mr. Kane's father made, Mr. Lester Kane\ncannot possibly obtain his share, except by complying with\na--with a--certain wish which his father had expressed.\"\n\nMr. O'Brien paused, his eyes moving back and forth side wise in\ntheir sockets. In spite of the natural prejudice of the situation, he\nwas considerably impressed with Jennie's pleasing appearance. He could\nsee quite plainly why Lester might cling to her in the face of all\nopposition. He continued to study her furtively as he sat there\nwaiting for her to speak.\n\n\"And what was that wish?\" she finally asked, her nerves becoming\njust a little tense under the strain of the silence.\n\n\"I am glad you were kind enough to ask me that,\" he went on. \"The\nsubject is a very difficult one for me to introduce--very\ndifficult. I come as an emissary of the estate, I might say as one of\nthe executors under the will of Mr. Kane's father. I know how keenly\nyour--ah--how keenly Mr. Kane feels about it. I know how\nkeenly you will probably feel about it. But it is one of those very\ndifficult things which cannot be helped--which must be got over\nsomehow. And while I hesitate very much to say so, I must tell you\nthat Mr. Kane senior stipulated in his will that unless,\nunless\"--again his eyes were moving sidewise to and fro--\"he\nsaw fit to separate from--ah--you\" he paused to get\nbreath--\"he could not inherit this or any other sum or, at least,\nonly a very minor income of ten thousand a year; and that only on\ncondition that he should marry you.\" He paused again. \"I should add,\"\nhe went on, \"that under the will he was given three years in which to\nindicate his intentions. That time is now drawing to a close.\"\n\nHe paused, half expecting some outburst of feeling from Jennie, but\nshe only looked at him fixedly, her eyes clouded with surprise,\ndistress, unhappiness. Now she understood. Lester was sacrificing his\nfortune for her. His recent commercial venture was an effort to\nrehabilitate himself, to put himself in an independent position. The\nrecent periods of preoccupation, of subtle unrest, and of\ndissatisfaction over which she had grieved were now explained. He was\nunhappy, he was brooding over this prospective loss, and he had never\ntold her. So his father had really disinherited him!\n\nMr. O'Brien sat before her, troubled himself. He was very sorry for\nher, now that he saw the expression of her face. Still the truth had\nto come out. She ought to know.\n\n\"I'm sorry,\" he said, when he saw that she was not going to make\nany immediate reply, \"that I have been the bearer of such unfortunate\nnews. It is a very painful situation that I find myself in at this\nmoment, I assure you. I bear you no ill will personally--of\ncourse you understand that. The family really bears you no ill will\nnow--I hope you believe that. As I told your--ah--as I\ntold Mr. Kane, at the time the will was read, I considered it most\nunfair, but, of course, as a mere executive under it and counsel for\nhis father, I could do nothing. I really think it best that you should\nknow how things stand, in order that you may help your--your\nhusband\"--he paused, significantly--\"if possible, to some\nsolution. It seems a pity to me, as it does to the various other\nmembers of his family, that he should lose all this money.\"\n\nJennie had turned her head away and was staring at the floor. She\nfaced him now steadily. \"He mustn't lose it,\" she said; \"it isn't fair\nthat he should.\"\n\n\"I am most delighted to hear you say that, Mrs.--Mrs. Kane,\"\nhe went on, using for the first time her improbable title as Lester's\nwife, without hesitation. \"I may as well be very frank with you, and\nsay that I feared you might take this information in quite another\nspirit. Of course you know to begin with that the Kane family is very\nclannish. Mrs. Kane, your--ah--your husband's mother, was a\nvery proud and rather distant woman, and his sisters and brothers are\nrather set in their notions as to what constitute proper family\nconnections. They look upon his relationship to you as irregular,\nand--pardon me if I appear to be a little cruel--as not\ngenerally satisfactory. As you know, there had been so much talk in\nthe last few years that Mr. Kane senior did not believe that the\nsituation could ever be nicely adjusted, so far as the family was\nconcerned. He felt that his son had not gone about it right in the\nfirst place. One of the conditions of his will was that if your\nhusband--pardon me--if his son did not accept the\nproposition in regard to separating from you and taking up his\nrightful share of the estate, then to inherit anything at\nall--the mere ten thousand a year I mentioned before--he\nmust--ah--he must pardon me, I seem a little brutal, but not\nintentionally so--marry you.\"\n\nJennie winced. It was such a cruel thing to say this to her face.\nThis whole attempt to live together illegally had proved disastrous at\nevery step. There was only one solution to the unfortunate\nbusiness--she could see that plainly. She must leave him, or he\nmust leave her. There was no other alternative. Lester living on ten\nthousand dollars a year! It seemed silly.\n\nMr. O'Brien was watching her curiously. He was thinking that Lester\nboth had and had not made a mistake. Why had he not married her in the\nfirst place? She was charming.\n\n\"There is just one other point which I wish to make in this\nconnection, Mrs. Kane,\" he went on softly and easily. \"I see now that\nit will not make any difference to you, but I am commissioned and in a\nway constrained to make it. I hope you will take it in the manner in\nwhich it is given. I don't know whether you are familiar with your\nhusband's commercial interests or not?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Jennie simply.\n\n\"Well, in order to simplify matters, and to make it easier for you,\nshould you decide to assist your husband to a solution of this very\ndifficult situation--frankly, in case you might possibly decide\nto leave on your own account, and maintain a separate establishment of\nyour own I am delighted to say that--ah--any sum,\nsay--ah--\"\n\nJennie rose and walked dazedly to one of the windows, clasping her\nhands as she went. Mr. O'Brien rose also.\n\n\"Well, be that as it may. In the event of your deciding to end the\nconnection it has been suggested that any reasonable sum you might\nname, fifty, seventy-five, a hundred thousand dollars\"--Mr.\nO'Brien was feeling very generous toward her--\"would be gladly\nset aside for your benefit--put in trust, as it were, so that you\nwould have it whenever you needed it. You would never want for\nanything.\"\n\n\"Please don't,\" said Jennie, hurt beyond the power to express\nherself, unable mentally and physically to listen to another word.\n\"Please don't say any more. Please go away. Let me alone now, please.\nI can go away. I will. It will be arranged. But please don't talk to\nme any more, will you?\"\n\n\"I understand how you feel, Mrs. Kane,\" went on Mr. O'Brien, coming\nto a keen realization of her sufferings. \"I know exactly, believe me.\nI have said all I intend to say. It has been very hard for me to do\nthis--very hard. I regret the necessity. You have my card. Please\nnote the name. I will come any time you suggest, or you can write me.\nI will not detain you any longer. I am sorry. I hope you will see fit\nto say nothing to your husband of my visit--it will be advisable\nthat you should keep your own counsel in the matter. I value his\nfriendship very highly, and I am sincerely sorry.\"\n\nJennie only stared at the floor.\n\nMr. O'Brien went out into the hall to get his coat. Jennie touched\nthe electric button to summon the maid, and Jeannette came. Jennie\nwent back into the library, and Mr. O'Brien paced briskly down the\nfront walk. When she was really alone she put her doubled hands to her\nchin, and stared at the floor, the queer design of the silken Turkish\nrug resolving itself into some curious picture. She saw herself in a\nsmall cottage somewhere, alone with Vesta; she saw Lester living in\nanother world, and beside him Mrs. Gerald. She saw this house vacant,\nand then a long stretch of time, and then--\n\n\"Oh,\" she sighed, choking back a desire to cry. With her hands she\nbrushed away a hot tear from each eye. Then she got up.\n\n\"It must be,\" she said to herself in thought. \"It must be. It\nshould have been so long ago.\" And then--\"Oh, thank God that papa\nis dead Anyhow, he did not live to see this.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LIII\n\n\nThe explanation which Lester had concluded to be inevitable,\nwhether it led to separation or legalization of their hitherto banal\ncondition, followed quickly upon the appearance of Mr. O'Brien. On the\nday Mr. O'Brien called he had gone on a journey to Hegewisch, a small\nmanufacturing town in Wisconsin, where he had been invited to witness\nthe trial of a new motor intended to operate elevators--with a\nview to possible investment. When he came out to the house, interested\nto tell Jennie something about it even in spite of the fact that he\nwas thinking of leaving her, he felt a sense of depression everywhere,\nfor Jennie, in spite of the serious and sensible conclusion she had\nreached, was not one who could conceal her feelings easily. She was\nbrooding sadly over her proposed action, realizing that it was best to\nleave but finding it hard to summon the courage which would let her\ntalk to him about it. She could not go without telling him what she\nthought. He ought to want to leave her. She was absolutely convinced\nthat this one course of action--separation--was necessary\nand advisable. She could not think of him as daring to make a\nsacrifice of such proportions for her sake even if he wanted to. It\nwas impossible. It was astonishing to her that he had let things go\nalong as dangerously and silently as he had.\n\nWhen he came in Jennie did her best to greet him with her\naccustomed smile, but it was a pretty poor imitation.\n\n\"Everything all right?\" she asked, using her customary phrase of\ninquiry.\n\n\"Quite,\" he answered. \"How are things with you?\"\n\n\"Oh, just the same.\" She walked with him to the library, and he\npoked at the open fire with a long-handled poker before turning around\nto survey the room generally. It was five o'clock of a January\nafternoon. Jennie had gone to one of the windows to lower the shade.\nAs she came back he looked at her critically. \"You're not quite your\nusual self, are you?\" he asked, sensing something out of the common in\nher attitude.\n\n\"Why, yes, I feel all right,\" she replied, but there was a peculiar\nuneven motion to the movement of her lips--a rippling tremor\nwhich was unmistakable to him.\n\n\"I think I know better than that,\" he said, still gazing at her\nsteadily. \"What's the trouble? Anything happened?\"\n\nShe turned away from him a moment to get her breath and collect her\nsenses. Then she faced him again. \"There is something,\" she managed to\nsay. \"I have to tell you something.\"\n\n\"I know you have,\" he agreed, half smiling, but with a feeling that\nthere was much of grave import back of this. \"What is it?\"\n\nShe was silent for a moment, biting her lips. She did not quite\nknow how to begin. Finally she broke the spell with: \"There was a man\nhere yesterday--a Mr. O'Brien, of Cincinnati. Do you know\nhim?\"\n\n\"Yes, I know him. What did he want?\"\n\n\"He came to talk to me about you and your father's will.\"\n\nShe paused, for his face clouded immediately. \"Why the devil should\nhe be talking to you about my father's will!\" he exclaimed. \"What did\nhe have to say?\"\n\n\"Please don't get angry, Lester,\" said Jennie calmly, for she\nrealized that she must remain absolute mistress of herself if anything\nwere to be accomplished toward the resolution of her problem. \"He\nwanted to tell me what a sacrifice you are making,\" she went on. \"He\nwished to show me that there was only a little time left before you\nwould lose your inheritance. Don't you want to act pretty soon? Don't\nyou want to leave me.\"\n\n\"Damn him!\" said Lester fiercely. \"What the devil does he mean by\nputting his nose in my private affairs? Can't they let me alone?\" He\nshook himself angrily. \"Damn them!\" he exclaimed again. \"This is some\nof Robert's work. Why should Knight, Keatley & O'Brien be meddling\nin my affairs? This whole business is getting to be a nuisance!\" He\nwas in a boiling rage in a moment, as was shown by his darkening skin\nand sulphurous eyes.\n\nJennie trembled before his anger. She did not know what to say.\n\nHe came to himself sufficiently after a time to add:\n\n\"Well. Just what did he tell you?\"\n\n\"He said that if you married me you would only get ten thousand a\nyear. That if you didn't and still lived with me you would get nothing\nat all. If you would leave me, or I would leave you, you would get all\nof a million and a half. Don't you think you had better leave me\nnow?\"\n\nShe had not intended to propound this leading question so quickly,\nbut it came out as a natural climax to the situation. She realized\ninstantly that if he were really in love with her he would answer with\nan emphatic \"no.\" If he didn't care, he would hesitate, he would\ndelay, he would seek to put off the evil day of reckoning.\n\n\"I don't see that,\" he retorted irritably. \"I don't see that\nthere's any need for either interference or hasty action. What I\nobject to is their coming here and mixing in my private affairs.\"\n\nJennie was cut to the quick by his indifference, his wrath instead\nof affection. To her the main point at issue was her leaving him or\nhis leaving her. To him this recent interference was obviously the\nchief matter for discussion and consideration. The meddling of others\nbefore he was ready to act was the terrible thing. She had hoped, in\nspite of what she had seen, that possibly, because of the long time\nthey had lived together and the things which (in a way) they had\nendured together, he might have come to care for her deeply--that\nshe had stirred some emotion in him which would never brook real\nseparation, though some seeming separation might be necessary. He had\nnot married her, of course, but then there had been so many things\nagainst them. Now, in this final hour, anyhow, he might have shown\nthat he cared deeply, even if he had deemed it necessary to let her\ngo. She felt for the time being as if, for all that she had lived with\nhim so long, she did not understand him, and yet, in spite of this\nfeeling, she knew also that she did. He cared, in his way. He could\nnot care for any one enthusiastically and demonstratively. He could\ncare enough to seize her and take her to himself as he had, but he\ncould not care enough to keep her if something more important\nappeared. He was debating her fate now. She was in a quandary, hurt,\nbleeding, but for once in her life, determined. Whether he wanted to\nor not, she must not let him make this sacrifice. She must leave\nhim--if he would not leave her. It was not important enough that\nshe should stay. There might be but one answer. But might he not show\naffection?\n\n\"Don't you think you had better act soon?\" she continued, hoping\nthat some word of feeling would come from him. \"There is only a little\ntime left, isn't there?\"\n\nJennie nervously pushed a book to and fro on the table, her fear\nthat she would not be able to keep up appearances troubling her\ngreatly. It was hard for her to know what to do or say. Lester was so\nterrible when he became angry. Still it ought not to be so hard for\nhim to go, now that he had Mrs. Gerald, if he only wished to do\nso--and he ought to. His fortune was so much more important to\nhim than anything she could be.\n\n\"Don't worry about that,\" he replied stubbornly, his wrath at his\nbrother, and his family, and O'Brien still holding him. \"There's time\nenough. I don't know what I want to do yet. I like the effrontery of\nthese people! But I won't talk any more about it; isn't dinner nearly\nready?\" He was so injured in his pride that he scarcely took the\ntrouble to be civil. He was forgetting all about her and what she was\nfeeling. He hated his brother Robert for this affront. He would have\nenjoyed wringing the necks of Messrs. Knight, Keatley & O'Brien,\nsingly and collectively.\n\nThe question could not be dropped for good and all, and it came up\nagain at dinner, after Jennie had done her best to collect her\nthoughts and quiet her nerves. They could not talk very freely because\nof Vesta and Jeannette, but she managed to get in a word or two.\n\n\"I could take a little cottage somewhere,\" she suggested softly,\nhoping to find him in a modified mood. \"I would not want to stay here.\nI would not know what to do with a big house like this alone.\"\n\n\"I wish you wouldn't discuss this business any longer, Jennie,\" he\npersisted. \"I'm in no mood for it. I don't know that I'm going to do\nanything of the sort. I don't know what I'm going to do.\" He was so\nsour and obstinate, because of O'Brien, that she finally gave it up.\nVesta was astonished to see her stepfather, usually so courteous, in\nso grim a mood.\n\nJennie felt a curious sense that she might hold him if she would,\nfor he was doubting; but she knew also that she should not wish. It\nwas not fair to him. It was not fair to herself, or kind, or\ndecent.\n\n\"Oh yes, Lester, you must,\" she pleaded, at a later time. \"I won't\ntalk about it any more, but you must. I won't let you do anything\nelse.\"\n\nThere were hours when it came up afterward--every day, in\nfact--in their boudoir, in the library, in the dining-room, at\nbreakfast, but not always in words. Jennie was worried. She was\nlooking the worry she felt. She was sure that he should be made to\nact. Since he was showing more kindly consideration for her, she was\nall the more certain that he should act soon. Just how to go about it\nshe did not know, but she looked at him longingly, trying to help him\nmake up his mind. She would be happy, she assured herself--she\nwould be happy thinking that he was happy once she was away from him.\nHe was a good man, most delightful in everything, perhaps, save his\ngift of love. He really did not love her--could not perhaps,\nafter all that had happened, even though she loved him most earnestly.\nBut his family had been most brutal in their opposition, and this had\naffected his attitude. She could understand that, too. She could see\nnow how his big, strong brain might be working in a circle. He was too\ndecent to be absolutely brutal about this thing and leave her, too\nreally considerate to look sharply after his own interests as he\nshould, or hers--but he ought to.\n\n\"You must decide, Lester,\" she kept saying to him, from time to\ntime. \"You must let me go. What difference does it make? I will be all\nright. Maybe, when this thing is all over you might want to come back\nto me. If you do, I will be there.\"\n\n\"I'm not ready to come to a decision,\" was his invariable reply. \"I\ndon't know that I want to leave you. This money is important, of\ncourse, but money isn't everything. I can live on ten thousand a year\nif necessary. I've done it in the past.\"\n\n\"Oh, but you're so much more placed in the world now, Lester,\" she\nargued. \"You can't do it. Look how much it costs to run this house\nalone. And a million and a half of dollars--why, I wouldn't let\nyou think of losing that. I'll go myself first.\"\n\n\"Where would you think of going if it came to that?\" he asked\ncuriously.\n\n\"Oh, I'd find some place. Do you remember that little town of\nSandwood, this side of Kenosha? I have often thought it would be a\npleasant place to live.\"\n\n\"I don't like to think of this,\" he said finally in an outburst of\nfrankness. \"It doesn't seem fair. The conditions have all been against\nthis union of ours. I suppose I should have married you in the first\nplace. I'm sorry now that I didn't.\"\n\nJennie choked in her throat, but said nothing.\n\n\"Anyhow, this won't be the last of it, if I can help it,\" he\nconcluded. He was thinking that the storm might blow over; once he had\nthe money, and then--but he hated compromises and\nsubterfuges.\n\nIt came by degrees to be understood that, toward the end of\nFebruary, she should look around at Sandwood and see what she could\nfind. She was to have ample means, he told her, everything that she\nwanted. After a time he might come out and visit her occasionally. And\nhe was determined in his heart that he would make some people pay for\nthe trouble they had caused him. He decided to send for Mr. O'Brien\nshortly and talk things over. He wanted for his personal satisfaction\nto tell him what he thought of him.\n\nAt the same time, in the background of his mind, moved the shadowy\nfigure of Mrs. Gerald--charming, sophisticated, well placed in\nevery sense of the word. He did not want to give her the broad reality\nof full thought, but she was always there. He thought and thought.\n\"Perhaps I'd better,\" he half concluded. When February came he was\nready to act.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LIV\n\n\nThe little town of Sandwood, \"this side of Kenosha,\" as Jennie had\nexpressed it, was only a short distance from Chicago, an hour and\nfifteen minutes by the local train. It had a population of some three\nhundred families, dwelling in small cottages, which were scattered\nover a pleasant area of lake-shore property. They were not rich\npeople. The houses were not worth more than from three to five\nthousand dollars each, but, in most cases, they were harmoniously\nconstructed, and the surrounding trees, green for the entire year,\ngave them a pleasing summery appearance. Jennie, at the time they had\npassed by there--it was an outing taken behind a pair of fast\nhorses--had admired the look of a little white church steeple,\nset down among green trees, and the gentle rocking of the boats upon\nthe summer water.\n\n\"I should like to live in a place like this some time,\" she had\nsaid to Lester, and he had made the comment that it was a little too\npeaceful for him. \"I can imagine getting to the place where I might\nlike this, but not now. It's too withdrawn.\"\n\nJennie thought of that expression afterward. It came to her when\nshe thought that the world was trying. If she had to be alone ever and\ncould afford it she would like to live in a place like Sandwood. There\nshe would have a little garden, some chickens, perhaps, a tall pole\nwith a pretty bird-house on it, and flowers and trees and green grass\neverywhere about. If she could have a little cottage in a place like\nthis which commanded a view of the lake she could sit of a summer\nevening and sew. Vesta could play about or come home from school. She\nmight have a few friends, or not any. She was beginning to think that\nshe could do very well living alone if it were not for Vesta's social\nneeds. Books were pleasant things--she was finding that\nout--books like Irving's Sketch Book, Lamb's Elia,\nand Hawthorne's Twice Told Tales. Vesta was coming to be quite\na musician in her way, having a keen sense of the delicate and refined\nin musical composition. She had a natural sense of harmony and a love\nfor those songs and instrumental compositions which reflect\nsentimental and passionate moods; and she could sing and play quite\nwell. Her voice was, of course, quite untrained--she was only\nfourteen--but it was pleasant to listen to. She was beginning to\nshow the combined traits of her mother and father--Jennie's\ngentle, speculative turn of mind, combined with Brander's vivacity of\nspirit and innate executive capacity. She could talk to her mother in\na sensible way about things, nature, books, dress, love, and from her\ndeveloping tendencies Jennie caught keen glimpses of the new worlds\nwhich Vesta was to explore. The nature of modern school life, its\nconsideration of various divisions of knowledge, music, science, all\ncame to Jennie watching her daughter take up new themes. Vesta was\nevidently going to be a woman of considerable ability--not\nirritably aggressive, but self-constructive. She would be able to take\ncare of herself. All this pleased Jennie and gave her great hopes for\nVesta's future.\n\nThe cottage which was finally secured at Sandwood was only a story\nand a half in height, but it was raised upon red brick piers between\nwhich were set green lattices and about which ran a veranda. The house\nwas long and narrow, its full length--some five rooms in a\nrow--facing the lake. There was a dining-room with windows\nopening even with the floor, a large library with built-in shelves for\nbooks, and a parlor whose three large windows afforded air and\nsunshine at all times.\n\nThe plot of ground in which this cottage stood was one hundred feet\nsquare and ornamented with a few trees. The former owner had laid out\nflower-beds, and arranged green hardwood tubs for the reception of\nvarious hardy plants and vines. The house was painted white, with\ngreen shutters and green shingles.\n\nIt had been Lester's idea, since this thing must be, that Jennie\nmight keep the house in Hyde Park just as it was, but she did not want\nto do that. She could not think of living there alone. The place was\ntoo full of memories. At first, she did not think she would take\nanything much with her, but she finally saw that it was advisable to\ndo as Lester suggested--to fit out the new place with a selection\nof silverware, hangings, and furniture from the Hyde Park house.\n\n\"You have no idea what you will or may want,\" he said. \"Take\neverything. I certainly don't want any of it.\"\n\nA lease of the cottage was taken for two years, together with an\noption for an additional five years, including the privilege of\npurchase. So long as he was letting her go, Lester wanted to be\ngenerous. He could not think of her as wanting for anything, and he\ndid not propose that she should. His one troublesome thought was, what\nexplanation was to be made to Vesta. He liked her very much and wanted\nher \"life kept free of complications.\n\n\"Why not send her off to a boarding-school until spring?\" he\nsuggested once; but owing to the lateness of the season this was\nabandoned as inadvisable. Later they agreed that business affairs made\nit necessary for him to travel and for Jennie to move. Later Vesta\ncould be told that Jennie had left him for any reason she chose to\ngive. It was a trying situation, all the more bitter to Jennie because\nshe realized that in spite of the wisdom of it indifference to her was\ninvolved. He really did not care enough, as much as he\ncared.\n\nThe relationship of man and woman which we study so passionately in\nthe hope of finding heaven knows what key to the mystery of existence\nholds no more difficult or trying situation than this of mutual\ncompatibility broken or disrupted by untoward conditions which in\nthemselves have so little to do with the real force and beauty of the\nrelationship itself. These days of final dissolution in which this\nhousehold, so charmingly arranged, the scene of so many pleasant\nactivities, was literally going to pieces was a period of great trial\nto both Jennie and Lester. On her part it was one of intense\nsuffering, for she was of that stable nature that rejoices to fix\nitself in a serviceable and harmonious relationship, and then stay so.\nFor her life was made up of those mystic chords of sympathy and memory\nwhich bind up the transient elements of nature into a harmonious and\nenduring scene. One of those chords--this home was her home,\nunited and made beautiful by her affection and consideration for each\nperson and every object. Now the time had come when it must cease.\n\nIf she had ever had anything before in her life which had been like\nthis it might have been easier to part with it now, though, as she had\nproved, Jennie's affections were not based in any way upon material\nconsiderations. Her love of life and of personality were free from the\ntaint of selfishness. She went about among these various rooms\nselecting this rug, that set of furniture, this and that ornament,\nwishing all the time with all her heart and soul that it need not be.\nJust to think, in a little while Lester would not come any more of an\nevening! She would not need to get up first of a morning and see that\ncoffee was made for her lord, that the table in the dining-room looked\njust so. It had been a habit of hers to arrange a bouquet for the\ntable out of the richest blooming flowers of the conservatory, and she\nhad always felt in doing it that it was particularly for him. Now it\nwould not be necessary any more--not for him. When one is\naccustomed to wait for the sound of a certain carriage-wheel of an\nevening grating upon your carriage drive, when one is used to listen\nat eleven, twelve, and one, waking naturally and joyfully to the echo\nof a certain step on the stair, the separation, the ending of these\nthings, is keen with pain. These were the thoughts that were running\nthrough Jennie's brain hour after hour and day after day.\n\nLester on his part was suffering in another fashion. His was not\nthe sorrow of lacerated affection, of discarded and despised love, but\nof that painful sense of unfairness which comes to one who knows that\nhe is making a sacrifice of the virtues--kindness, loyalty,\naffection--to policy. Policy was dictating a very splendid course\nof action from one point of view. Free of Jennie, providing for her\nadmirably, he was free to go his way, taking to himself the mass of\naffairs which come naturally with great wealth. He could not help\nthinking of the thousand and one little things which Jennie had been\naccustomed to do for him, the hundred and one comfortable and pleasant\nand delightful things she meant to him. The virtues which she\npossessed were quite dear to his mind. He had gone over them time and\nagain. Now he was compelled to go over them finally, to see that she\nwas suffering without making a sign. Her manner and attitude toward\nhim in these last days were quite the same as they had always\nbeen--no more, no less. She was not indulging in private\nhysterics, as another woman might have done; she was not pretending a\nfortitude in suffering she did not feel, showing him one face while\nwishing him to see another behind it. She was calm, gentle,\nconsiderate--thoughtful of him--where he would go and what\nhe would do, without irritating him by her inquiries. He was struck\nquite favorably by her ability to take a large situation largely, and\nhe admired her. There was something to this woman, let the world think\nwhat it might. It was a shame that her life was passed under such a\ntroubled star. Still a great world was calling him. The sound of its\nvoice was in his ears. It had on occasion shown him its bared teeth.\nDid he really dare to hesitate?\n\nThe last hour came, when having made excuses to this and that\nneighbor, when having spread the information that they were going\nabroad, when Lester had engaged rooms at the Auditorium, and the mass\nof furniture which could not be used had gone to storage, that it was\nnecessary to say farewell to this Hyde Park domicile. Jennie had\nvisited Sandwood in company with Lester several times. He had\ncarefully examined the character of the place. He was satisfied that\nit was nice but lonely. Spring was at hand, the flowers would be\nsomething. She was going to keep a gardener and man of all work. Vesta\nwould be with her.\n\n\"Very well,\" he said, \"only I want you to be comfortable.\"\n\nIn the mean time Lester had been arranging his personal affairs. He\nhad notified Messrs. Knight, Keatley & O'Brien through his own\nattorney, Mr. Watson, that he would expect them to deliver his share\nof his father's securities on a given date. He had made up his mind\nthat as long as he was compelled by circumstances to do this thing he\nwould do a number of other things equally ruthless. He would probably\nmarry Mrs. Gerald. He would sit as a director in the United Carriage\nCompany--with his share of the stock it would be impossible to\nkeep him out. If he had Mrs. Gerald's money he would become a\ncontrolling factor in the United Traction of Cincinnati, in which his\nbrother was heavily interested, and in the Western Steel Works, of\nwhich his brother was now the leading adviser. What a different figure\nhe would be now from that which he had been during the past few\nyears!\n\nJennie was depressed to the point of despair. She was tremendously\nlonely. This home had meant so much to her. When she first came here\nand neighbors had begun to drop in she had imagined herself on the\nthreshold of a great career, that some day, possibly, Lester would\nmarry her. Now, blow after blow had been delivered, and the home and\ndream were a ruin. Gerhardt was gone. Jeannette, Harry Ward, and Mrs.\nFrissell had been discharged, the furniture for a good part was in\nstorage, and for her, practically, Lester was no more. She realized\nclearly that he would not come back. If he could do this thing now,\neven considerately, he could do much more when he was free and away\nlater. Immersed in his great affairs, he would forget, of course. And\nwhy not? She did not fit in. Had not everything--everything\nillustrated that to her? Love was not enough in this world--that\nwas so plain. One needed education, wealth, training, the ability to\nfight and scheme, She did not want to do that. She could not.\n\nThe day came when the house was finally closed and the old life was\nat an end. Lester traveled with Jennie to Sandwood. He spent some\nlittle while in the house trying to get her used to the idea of\nchange--it was not so bad. He intimated that he would come again\nsoon, but he went away, and all his words were as nothing against the\nfact of the actual and spiritual separation. When Jennie saw him going\ndown the brick walk that afternoon, his solid, conservative figure\nclad in a new tweed suit, his overcoat on his arm, self-reliance and\nprosperity written all over him, she thought that she would die. She\nhad kissed Lester good-by and had wished him joy, prosperity, peace;\nthen she made an excuse to go to her bedroom. Vesta came after a time,\nto seek her, but now her eyes were quite dry; everything had subsided\nto a dull ache. The new life was actually begun for her--a life\nwithout Lester, without Gerhardt, without any one save Vesta.\n\n\"What curious things have happened to me!\" she thought, as she went\ninto the kitchen, for she had determined to do at least some of her\nown work. She needed the distraction. She did not want to think. If it\nwere not for Vesta she would have sought some regular outside\nemployment. Anything to keep from brooding, for in that direction lay\nmadness.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LV\n\n\nThe social and business worlds of Chicago, Cincinnati, Cleveland,\nand other cities saw, during the year or two which followed the\nbreaking of his relationship with Jennie, a curious rejuvenation in\nthe social and business spirit of Lester Kane. He had become rather\ndistant and indifferent to certain personages and affairs while he was\nliving with her, but now he suddenly appeared again, armed with\nauthority from a number of sources, looking into this and that matter\nwith the air of one who has the privilege of power, and showing\nhimself to be quite a personage from the point of view of finance and\ncommerce. He was older of course. It must be admitted that he was in\nsome respects a mentally altered Lester. Up to the time he had met\nJennie he was full of the assurance of the man who has never known\ndefeat. To have been reared in luxury as he had been, to have seen\nonly the pleasant side of society, which is so persistent and so\ndeluding where money is concerned, to have been in the run of big\naffairs not because one has created them, but because one is a part of\nthem and because they are one's birthright, like the air one breathes,\ncould not help but create one of those illusions of solidarity which\nis apt to befog the clearest brain. It is so hard for us to know what\nwe have not seen. It is so difficult for us to feel what we have not\nexperienced. Like this world of ours, which seems so solid and\npersistent solely because we have no knowledge of the power which\ncreates it, Lester's world seemed solid and persistent and real enough\nto him. It was only when the storms set in and the winds of adversity\nblew and he found himself facing the armed forces of convention that\nhe realized he might be mistaken as to the value of his personality,\nthat his private desires and opinions were as nothing in the face of a\npublic conviction; that he was wrong. The race spirit, or social\navatar, the \"Zeitgeist\" as the Germans term it, manifested itself as\nsomething having a system in charge, and the organization of society\nbegan to show itself to him as something based on possibly a\nspiritual, or, at least, superhuman counterpart. He could not fly in\nthe face of it. He could not deliberately ignore its mandates. The\npeople of his time believed that some particular form of social\narrangement was necessary, and unless he complied with that he could,\nas he saw, readily become a social outcast. His own father and mother\nhad turned on him--his brother and sisters, society, his friends.\nDear heaven, what a to-do this action of his had created! Why, even\nthe fates seemed adverse. His real estate venture was one of the most\nfortuitously unlucky things he had ever heard of. Why? Were the gods\nbattling on the side of a to him unimportant social arrangement?\nApparently. Anyhow, he had been compelled to quit, and here he was,\nvigorous, determined, somewhat battered by the experience, but still\nforceful and worth while.\n\nAnd it was a part of the penalty that he had become measurably\nsoured by what had occurred. He was feeling that he had been compelled\nto do the first ugly, brutal thing of his life. Jennie deserved better\nof him. It was a shame to forsake her after all the devotion she had\nmanifested. Truly she had played a finer part than he. Worst of all,\nhis deed could not be excused on the grounds of necessity. He could\nhave lived on ten thousand a year; he could have done without the\nmillion and more which was now his. He could have done without the\nsociety, the pleasures of which had always been a lure. He could have,\nbut he had not, and he had complicated it all with the thought of\nanother woman.\n\nWas she as good as Jennie? That was a question which always rose\nbefore him. Was she as kindly? Wasn't she deliberately scheming under\nhis very eyes to win him away from the woman who was as good as his\nwife? Was that admirable? Was it the thing a truly big woman would do?\nWas she good enough for him after all? Ought he to marry her? Ought he\nto marry any one seeing that he really owed a spiritual if not a legal\nallegiance to Jennie? Was it worth while for any woman to marry him?\nThese things turned in his brain. They haunted him. He could not shut\nout the fact that he was doing a cruel and unlovely thing.\n\nMaterial error in the first place was now being complicated with\nspiritual error. He was attempting to right the first by committing\nthe second. Could it be done to his own satisfaction? Would it\npay mentally and spiritually? Would it bring him peace of mind? He was\nthinking, thinking, all the while he was readjusting his life to the\nold (or perhaps better yet, new) conditions, and he was not feeling\nany happier. As a matter of fact he was feeling worse--grim,\nrevengeful. If he married Letty he thought at times it would be to use\nher fortune as a club to knock other enemies over the head, and he\nhated to think he was marrying her for that. He took up his abode at\nthe Auditorium, visited Cincinnati in a distant and aggressive spirit,\nsat in council with the board of directors, wishing that he was more\nat peace with himself, more interested in life. But he did not change\nhis policy in regard to Jennie.\n\nOf course Mrs. Gerald had been vitally interested in Lester's\nrehabilitation. She waited tactfully some little time before sending\nhim any word; finally she ventured to write to him at the Hyde Park\naddress (as if she did not know where he was), asking, \"Where are\nyou?\" By this time Lester had become slightly accustomed to the change\nin his life. He was saying to himself that he needed sympathetic\ncompanionship, the companionship of a woman, of course. Social\ninvitations had begun to come to him now that he was alone and that\nhis financial connections were so obviously restored. He had made his\nappearance, accompanied only by a Japanese valet, at several country\nhouses, the best sign that he was once more a single man. No reference\nwas made by any one to the past.\n\nOn receiving Mrs. Gerald's note he decided that he ought to go and\nsee her. He had treated her rather shabbily. For months preceding his\nseparation from Jennie he had not gone near her. Even now he waited\nuntil time brought a 'phoned invitation to dinner. This he\naccepted.\n\nMrs. Gerald was at her best as a hostess at her perfectly appointed\ndinner-table. Alboni, the pianist, was there on this occasion,\ntogether with Adam Rascavage, the sculptor, a visiting scientist from\nEngland, Sir Nelson Keyes, and, curiously enough, Mr. and Mrs. Berry\nDodge, whom Lester had not met socially in several years. Mrs. Gerald\nand Lester exchanged the joyful greetings of those who understand each\nother thoroughly and are happy in each other's company. \"Aren't you\nashamed of yourself, sir,\" she said to him when he made his\nappearance, \"to treat me so indifferently? You are going to be\npunished for this.\"\n\n\"What's the damage?\" he smiled. \"I've been extremely rushed. I\nsuppose something like ninety stripes will serve me about right.\"\n\n\"Ninety stripes, indeed!\" she retorted. \"You're letting yourself\noff easy. What is it they do to evil-doers in Siam?\"\n\n\"Boil them in oil, I suppose.\"\n\n\"Well, anyhow, that's more like. I'm thinking of something\nterrible.\"\n\n\"Be sure and tell me when you decide,\" he laughed, and passed on to\nbe presented to distinguished strangers by Mrs. De Lincum who aided\nMrs. Gerald in receiving.\n\nThe talk was stimulating. Lester was always at his ease\nintellectually, and this mental atmosphere revived him. Presently he\nturned to greet Berry Dodge, who was standing at his elbow.\n\nDodge was all cordiality. \"Where are you now?\" he asked. \"We\nhaven't seen you in--oh, when? Mrs. Dodge is waiting to have a\nword with you.\" Lester noticed the change in Dodge's attitude.\n\n\"Some time, that's sure,\" he replied easily. \"I'm living at the\nAuditorium.\"\n\n\"I was asking after you the other day. You know Jackson Du Bois? Of\ncourse you do. We were thinking of running up into Canada for some\nhunting. Why don't you join us?\"\n\n\"I can't,\" replied Lester. \"Too many things on hand just now.\nLater, surely.\"\n\nDodge was anxious to continue. He had seen Lester's election as a\ndirector of the C. H. & D. Obviously he was coming back into the\nworld. But dinner was announced and Lester sat at Mrs. Gerald's right\nhand.\n\n\"Aren't you coming to pay me a dinner call some afternoon after\nthis?\" asked Mrs. Gerald confidentially when the conversation was\nbrisk at the other end of the table.\n\n\"I am, indeed,\" he replied, \"and shortly. Seriously, I've been\nwanting to look you up. You understand though how things are now?\"\n\n\"I do. I've heard a great deal. That's why I want you to come. We\nneed to talk together.\"\n\nTen days later he did call. He felt as if he must talk with her; he\nwas feeling bored and lonely; his long home life with Jennie had made\nhotel life objectionable. He felt as though he must find a\nsympathetic, intelligent ear, and where better than here? Letty was\nall ears for his troubles. She would have pillowed his solid head upon\nher breast in a moment if that had been possible.\n\n\"Well,\" he said, when the usual fencing preliminaries were over,\n\"what will you have me say in explanation?\"\n\n\"Have you burned your bridges behind you?\" she asked.\n\n\"I'm not so sure,\" he replied gravely. \"And I can't say that I'm\nfeeling any too joyous about the matter as a whole.\"\n\n\"I thought as much,\" she replied. \"I knew how it would be with you.\nI can see you wading through this mentally, Lester. I have been\nwatching you, every step of the way, wishing you peace of mind. These\nthings are always so difficult, but don't you know I am still sure\nit's for the best. It never was right the other way. It never could\nbe. You couldn't afford to sink back into a mere shell-fish life. You\nare not organized temperamentally for that any more than I am. You may\nregret what you are doing now, but you would have regretted the other\nthing quite as much and more. You couldn't work your life out that\nway--now, could you?\"\n\n\"I don't know about that, Letty. Really, I don't. I've wanted to\ncome and see you for a long time, but I didn't think that I ought to.\nThe fight was outside--you know what I mean.\"\n\n\"Yes, indeed, I do,\" she said soothingly.\n\n\"It's still inside. I haven't gotten over it. I don't know whether\nthis financial business binds me sufficiently or not. I'll be frank\nand tell you that I can't say I love her entirely; but I'm sorry, and\nthat's something.\"\n\n\"She's comfortably provided for, of course,\" she commented rather\nthan inquired.\n\n\"Everything she wants. Jennie is of a peculiar disposition. She\ndoesn't want much. She's retiring by nature and doesn't care for show.\nI've taken a cottage for her at Sandwood, a little place north of here\non the lake; and there's plenty of money in trust, but, of course, she\nknows she can live anywhere she pleases.\"\n\n\"I understand exactly how she feels, Lester. I know how you feel.\nShe is going to suffer very keenly for a while--we all do when we\nhave to give up the thing we love. But we can get over it, and we do.\nAt least, we can live. She will. It will go hard at first, but after a\nwhile she will see how it is, and she won't feel any the worse toward\nyou.\"\n\n\"Jennie will never reproach me, I know that,\" he replied. \"I'm the\none who will do the reproaching. I'll be abusing myself for some time.\nThe trouble is with my particular turn of mind. I can't tell, for the\nlife of me, how much of this disturbing feeling of mine is\nhabit--the condition that I'm accustomed to--and how much is\nsympathy. I sometimes think I'm the the most pointless individual in\nthe world. I think too much.\"\n\n\"Poor Lester!\" she said tenderly. \"Well, I understand for one.\nYou're lonely living where you are, aren't you?\"\n\n\"I am that,\" he replied.\n\n\"Why not come and spend a few days down at West Baden? I'm going\nthere.\"\n\n\"When?\" he inquired.\n\n\"Next Tuesday.\"\n\n\"Let me see,\" he replied. \"I'm not sure that I can.\" He consulted\nhis notebook. \"I could come Thursday, for a few days.\"\n\n\"Why not do that? You need company. We can walk and talk things out\ndown there. Will you?\"\n\n\"Yes, I will,\" he replied.\n\nShe came toward him, trailing a lavender lounging robe. \"You're\nsuch a solemn philosopher, sir,\" she observed comfortably, \"working\nthrough all the ramifications of things. Why do you? You were always\nlike that.\"\n\n\"I can't help it,\" he replied. \"It's my nature to think.\"\n\n\"Well, one thing I know--\" and she tweaked his ear gently.\n\"You're not going to make another mistake through sympathy if I can\nhelp it,\" she said daringly. \"You're going to stay disentangled long\nenough to give yourself a chance to think out what you want to do. You\nmust. And I wish for one thing you'd take over the management of my\naffairs. You could advise me so much better than my lawyer.\"\n\nHe arose and walked to the window, turning to look back at her\nsolemnly. \"I know what you want,\" he said doggedly.\n\n\"And why shouldn't I?\" she demanded, again approaching him. She\nlooked at him pleadingly, defiantly. \"Yes, why shouldn't I?\"\n\n\"You don't know what you're doing,\" he grumbled; but he kept on\nlooking at her; she stood there, attractive as a woman of her age\ncould be, wise, considerate, full of friendship and affection.\n\n\"Letty,\" he said. \"You ought not to want to marry me. I'm not worth\nit. Really I'm not. I'm too cynical. Too indifferent. It won't be\nworth anything in the long run.\"\n\n\"It will be worth something to me,\" she insisted. \"I know what you\nare. Anyhow, I don't care. I want you!\"\n\nHe took her hands, then her arms. Finally he drew her to him, and\nput his arms about her waist. \"Poor Letty!\" he said; \"I'm not worth\nit. You'll be sorry.\"\n\n\"No, I'll not,\" she replied. \"I know what I'm doing. I don't care\nwhat you think you are worth.\" She laid her cheek on his shoulder. \"I\nwant you.\"\n\n\"If you keep on I venture to say you'll have me,\" he returned. He\nbent and kissed her.\n\n\"Oh,\" she exclaimed, and hid her hot face against his breast.\n\n\"This is bad business,\" he thought, even as he held her within the\ncircle of his arms. \"It isn't what I ought to be doing.\"\n\nStill he held her, and now when she offered her lips coaxingly he\nkissed her again and again.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LVI\n\n\nIt is difficult to say whether Lester might not have returned to\nJennie after all but for certain influential factors. After a time,\nwith his control of his portion of the estate firmly settled in his\nhands and the storm of original feeling forgotten, he was well aware\nthat diplomacy--if he ignored his natural tendency to fulfil even\nimplied obligations--could readily bring about an arrangement\nwhereby he and Jennie could be together. But he was haunted by the\nsense of what might be called an important social opportunity in the\nform of Mrs. Gerald. He was compelled to set over against his natural\ntendency toward Jennie a consciousness of what he was ignoring in the\npersonality and fortunes of her rival, who was one of the most\nsignificant and interesting figures on the social horizon. For think\nas he would, these two women were now persistently opposed in his\nconsciousness. The one polished, sympathetic,\nphilosophic--schooled in all the niceties of polite society, and\nwith the means to gratify her every wish; the other natural,\nsympathetic, emotional, with no schooling in the ways of polite\nsociety, but with a feeling for the beauty of life and the lovely\nthings in human relationship which made her beyond any question an\nexceptional woman. Mrs. Gerald saw it and admitted it. Her criticism\nof Lester's relationship with Jennie was not that she was not worth\nwhile, but that conditions made it impolitic. On the other hand, union\nwith her was an ideal climax for his social aspirations. This would\nbring everything out right. He would be as happy with her as he would\nbe with Jennie--almost--and he would have the satisfaction\nof knowing that this Western social and financial world held no more\nsignificant figure than himself. It was not wise to delay either this\nlatter excellent solution of his material problems, and after thinking\nit over long and seriously he finally concluded that he would not. He\nhad already done Jennie the irreparable wrong of leaving her. What\ndifference did it make if he did this also? She was possessed of\neverything she could possibly want outside of himself. She had herself\ndeemed it advisable for him to leave. By such figments of the brain,\nin the face of unsettled and disturbing conditions, he was becoming\nused to the idea of a new alliance.\n\nThe thing which prevented an eventual resumption of relationship in\nsome form with Jennie was the constant presence of Mrs. Gerald.\nCircumstances conspired to make her the logical solution of his mental\nquandary at this time. Alone he could do nothing save to make visits\nhere and there, and he did not care to do that. He was too indifferent\nmentally to gather about him as a bachelor that atmosphere which he\nenjoyed and which a woman like Mrs. Gerald could so readily provide.\nUnited with her it was simple enough. Their home then, wherever it\nwas, would be full of clever people. He would need to do little save\nto appear and enjoy it. She understood quite as well as any one how he\nliked to live. She enjoyed to meet the people he enjoyed meeting.\nThere were so many things they could do together nicely. He visited\nWest Baden at the same time she did, as she suggested. He gave himself\nover to her in Chicago for dinners, parties, drives. Her house was\nquite as much his own as hers--she made him feel so. She talked\nto him about her affairs, showing him exactly how they stood and why\nshe wished him to intervene in this and that matter. She did not wish\nhim to be much alone. She did not want him to think or regret. She\ncame to represent to him comfort, forgetfulness, rest from care. With\nthe others he visited at her house occasionally, and it gradually\nbecame rumored about that he would marry her. Because of the fact that\nthere had been so much discussion of his previous relationship, Letty\ndecided that if ever this occurred it should be a quiet affair. She\nwanted a simple explanation in the papers of how it had come about,\nand then afterward, when things were normal again and gossip had\nsubsided, she would enter on a dazzling social display for his\nsake.\n\n\"Why not let us get married in April and go abroad for the summer?\"\nshe asked once, after they had reached a silent understanding that\nmarriage would eventually follow. \"Let's go to Japan. Then we can come\nback in the fall, and take a house on the drive.\"\n\nLester had been away from Jennie so long now that the first severe\nwave of self-reproach had passed. He was still doubtful, but he\npreferred to stifle his misgivings. \"Very well,\" he replied, almost\njokingly. \"Only don't let there be any fuss about it.\"\n\n\"Do you really mean that, sweet?\" she exclaimed, looking over at\nhim; they had been spending the evening together quietly reading and\nchatting.\n\n\"I've thought about it a long while,\" he replied. \"I don't see why\nnot.\"\n\nShe came over to him and sat on his knee, putting her arms upon his\nshoulders.\n\n\"I can scarcely believe you said that,\" she said, looking at him\ncuriously.\n\n\"Shall I take it back?\" he asked.\n\n\"No, no. It's agreed for April now. And we'll go to Japan. You\ncan't change your mind. There won't be any fuss. But my, what a\ntrousseau I will prepare!\"\n\nHe smiled a little constrainedly as she tousled his head; there was\na missing note somewhere in this gamut of happiness; perhaps it was\nbecause he was getting old.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LVII\n\n\nIn the meantime Jennie was going her way, settling herself in the\nmarkedly different world in which henceforth she was to move. It\nseemed a terrible thing at first--this life without Lester.\nDespite her own strong individuality, her ways had become so involved\nwith his that there seemed to be no possibility of disentangling them.\nConstantly she was with him in thought and action, just as though they\nhad never separated. Where was he now? What was he doing? What was he\nsaying? How was he looking? In the mornings when she woke it was with\nthe sense that he must be beside her. At night as if she could not go\nto bed alone. He would come after a while surely--ah, no, of\ncourse he would not come. Dear heaven, think of that! Never any more.\nAnd she wanted him so.\n\nAgain there were so many little trying things to adjust, for a\nchange of this nature is too radical to be passed over lightly. The\nexplanation she had to make to Vesta was of all the most important.\nThis little girl, who was old enough now to see and think for herself,\nwas not without her surmises and misgivings. Vesta recalled that her\nmother had been accused of not being married to her father when she\nwas born. She had seen the article about Jennie and Lester in the\nSunday paper at the time it had appeared--it had been shown to\nher at school--but she had had sense enough to say nothing about\nit, feeling somehow that Jennie would not like it. Lester's\ndisappearance was a complete surprise; but she had learned in the last\ntwo or three years that her mother was very sensitive, and that she\ncould hurt her in unexpected ways. Jennie was finally compelled to\ntell Vesta that Lester's fortune had been dependent on his leaving\nher, solely because she was not of his station. Vesta listened soberly\nand half suspected the truth. She felt terribly sorry for her mother,\nand, because of Jennie's obvious distress, she was trebly gay and\ncourageous. She refused outright the suggestion of going to a\nboarding-school and kept as close to her mother as she could. She\nfound interesting books to read with her, insisted that they go to see\nplays together, played to her on the piano, and asked for her mother's\ncriticisms on her drawing and modeling. She found a few friends in the\nexcellent Sand wood school, and brought them home of an evening to add\nlightness and gaiety to the cottage life. Jennie, through her growing\nappreciation of Vesta's fine character, became more and more drawn\ntoward her. Lester was gone, but at least she had Vesta. That prop\nwould probably sustain her in the face of a waning existence.\n\nThere was also her history to account for to the residents of\nSandwood. In many cases where one is content to lead a secluded life\nit is not necessary to say much of one's past, but as a rule something\nmust be said. People have the habit of inquiring--if they are no\nmore than butchers and bakers. By degrees one must account for this\nand that fact, and it was so here. She could not say that her husband\nwas dead. Lester might come back. She had to say that she had left\nhim--to give the impression that it would be she, if any one, who\nwould permit him to return. This put her in an interesting and\nsympathetic light in the neighborhood. It was the most sensible thing\nto do. She then settled down to a quiet routine of existence, waiting\nwhat denouement to her life she could not guess.\n\nSandwood life was not without its charms for a lover of nature, and\nthis, with the devotion of Vesta, offered some slight solace. There\nwas the beauty of the lake, which, with its passing boats, was a\nnever-ending source of joy, and there were many charming drives in the\nsurrounding country. Jennie had her own horse and carryall--one\nof the horses of the pair they had used in Hyde Park. Other household\npets appeared in due course of time, including a collie, that Vesta\nnamed Rats; she had brought him from Chicago as a puppy, and he had\ngrown to be a sterling watch-dog, sensible and affectionate. There was\nalso a cat, Jimmy Woods, so called after a boy Vesta knew, and to whom\nshe insisted the cat bore a marked resemblance. There was a singing\nthrush, guarded carefully against a roving desire for bird-food on the\npart of Jimmy Woods, and a jar of goldfish. So this little household\ndrifted along quietly and dreamily indeed, but always with the\nundercurrent of feeling which ran so still because it was so deep.\n\nThere was no word from Lester for the first few weeks following his\ndeparture; he was too busy following up the threads of his new\ncommercial connections and too considerate to wish to keep Jennie in a\nstate of mental turmoil over communications which, under the present\ncircumstances, could mean nothing. He preferred to let matters rest\nfor the time being; then a little later he would write her sanely and\ncalmly of how things were going. He did this after the silence of a\nmonth, saying that he had been pretty well pressed by commercial\naffairs, that he had been in and out of the city frequently (which was\nthe truth), and that he would probably be away from Chicago a large\npart of the time in the future. He inquired after Vesta and the\ncondition of affairs generally at Sandwood. \"I may get up there one of\nthese days,\" he suggested, but he really did not mean to come, and\nJennie knew that he did not.\n\nAnother month passed, and then there was a second letter from him,\nnot so long as the first one. Jennie had written him frankly and\nfully, telling him just how things stood with her. She concealed\nentirely her own feelings in the matter, saying that she liked the\nlife very much, and that she was glad to be at Sand wood. She\nexpressed the hope that now everything was coming out for the best for\nhim, and tried to show him that she was really glad matters had been\nsettled. \"You mustn't think of me as being unhappy,\" she said in one\nplace, \"for I'm not. I am sure it ought to be just as it is, and I\nwouldn't be happy if it were any other way. Lay out your life so as to\ngive yourself the greatest happiness, Lester,\" she added. \"You deserve\nit. Whatever you do will be just right for me. I won't mind.\" She had\nMrs. Gerald in mind, and he suspected as much, but he felt that her\ngenerosity must be tinged greatly with self-sacrifice and secret\nunhappiness. It was the one thing which made him hesitate about taking\nthat final step.\n\nThe written word and the hidden thought--how they conflict!\nAfter six months the correspondence was more or less perfunctory on\nhis part, and at eight it had ceased temporarily.\n\nOne morning, as she was glancing over the daily paper, she saw\namong the society notes the following item:\n\nThe engagement of Mrs. Malcolm Gerald, of 4044 Drexel Boulevard,\nto Lester Kane, second son of the late Archibald Kane, of Cincinnati,\nwas formally announced at a party given by the prospective bride on\nTuesday to a circle of her immediate friends. The wedding will take\nplace in April.\n\nThe paper fell from her hands. For a few minutes she sat perfectly\nstill, looking straight ahead of her. Could this thing be so? she\nasked herself. Had it really come at last? She had known that it must\ncome, and yet--and yet she had always hoped that it would not.\nWhy had she hoped? Had not she herself sent him away? Had not she\nherself suggested this very thing in a roundabout way? It had come\nnow. What must she do? Stay here as a pensioner? The idea was\nobjectionable to her. And yet he had set aside a goodly sum to be hers\nabsolutely. In the hands of a trust company in La Salle Street were\nrailway certificates aggregating seventy-five thousand dollars, which\nyielded four thousand five hundred annually, the income being paid to\nher direct. Could she refuse to receive this money? There was Vesta to\nbe considered.\n\nJennie felt hurt through and through by this denouement, and yet as\nshe sat there she realized that it was foolish to be angry. Life was\nalways doing this sort of a thing to her. It would go on doing so. She\nwas sure of it. If she went out in the world and earned her own living\nwhat difference would it make to him? What difference would it make to\nMrs. Gerald? Here she was walled in this little place, leading an\nobscure existence, and there was he out in the great world enjoying\nlife in its fullest and freest sense. It was too bad. But why cry?\nWhy?\n\nHer eyes indeed were dry, but her very soul seemed to be torn in\npieces within her. She rose carefully, hid the newspaper at the bottom\nof a trunk, and turned the key upon it.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LVIII\n\n\nNow that his engagement to Mrs. Gerald was an accomplished, fact,\nLester found no particular difficulty in reconciling himself to the\nnew order of things; undoubtedly it was all for the best. He was sorry\nfor Jennie--very sorry. So was Mrs. Gerald; but there was a\npractical unguent to her grief in the thought that it was best for\nboth Lester and the girl. He would be happier--was so now. And\nJennie would eventually realize that she had done a wise and kindly\nthing; she would be glad in the consciousness that she had acted so\nunselfishly. As for Mrs. Gerald, because of her indifference to the\nlate Malcolm Gerald, and because she was realizing the dreams of her\nyouth in getting Lester at last--even though a little\nlate--she was intensely happy. She could think of nothing finer\nthan this daily life with him--the places they would go, the\nthings they would see. Her first season in Chicago as Mrs. Lester Kane\nthe following winter was going to be something worth remembering. And\nas for Japan--that was almost too good to be true.\n\nLester wrote to Jennie of his coming marriage to Mrs. Gerald. He\nsaid that he had no explanation to make. It wouldn't be worth anything\nif he did make it. He thought he ought to marry Mrs. Gerald. He\nthought he ought to let her (Jennie) know. He hoped she was well. He\nwanted her always to feel that he had her real interests at heart. He\nwould do anything in his power to make life as pleasant and agreeable\nfor her as possible. He hoped she would forgive him. And would she\nremember him affectionately to Vesta? She ought to be sent to a\nfinishing school.\n\nJennie understood the situation perfectly. She knew that Lester had\nbeen drawn to Mrs. Gerald from the time he met her at the Carlton in\nLondon. She had been angling for him. Now she had him. It was all\nright. She hoped he would be happy. She was glad to write and tell him\nso, explaining that she had seen the announcement in the papers.\nLester read her letter thoughtfully; there was more between the lines\nthan the written words conveyed. Her fortitude was a charm to him even\nin this hour. In spite of all he had done and what he was now going to\ndo, he realized that he still cared for Jennie in a way. She was a\nnoble and a charming woman. If everything else had been all right he\nwould not be going to marry Mrs. Gerald at all. And yet he did marry\nher.\n\nThe ceremony was performed on April fifteenth, at the residence of\nMrs. Gerald, a Roman Catholic priest officiating. Lester was a poor\nexample of the faith he occasionally professed. He was an agnostic,\nbut because he had been reared in the church he felt that he might as\nwell be married in it. Some fifty guests, intimate friends, had been\ninvited. The ceremony went off with perfect smoothness. There were\njubilant congratulations and showers of rice and confetti. While the\nguests were still eating and drinking Lester and Letty managed to\nescape by a side entrance into a closed carriage, and were off.\nFifteen minutes later there was pursuit pell-mell on the part of the\nguests to the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific depot; but by that time\nthe happy couple were in their private car, and the arrival of the\nrice throwers made no difference. More champagne was opened; then the\nstarting of the train ended all excitement, and the newly wedded pair\nwere at last safely off.\n\n\"Well, now you have me,\" said Lester, cheerfully pulling Letty down\nbeside him into a seat, \"what of it?\"\n\n\"This of it,\" she exclaimed, and hugged him close, kissing him\nfervently. In four days they were in San Francisco, and two days later\non board a fast steamship bound for the land of the Mikado.\n\nIn the meanwhile Jennie was left to brood. The original\nannouncement in the newspapers had said that he was to be married in\nApril, and she had kept close watch for additional information.\nFinally she learned that the wedding would take place on April\nfifteenth at the residence of the prospective bride, the hour being\nhigh noon. In spite of her feeling of resignation, Jennie followed it\nall hopelessly, like a child, hungry and forlorn, looking into a\nlighted window at Christmas time.\n\nOn the day of the wedding she waited miserably for twelve o'clock\nto strike; it seemed as though she were really present--and\nlooking on. She could see in her mind's eye the handsome residence,\nthe carriages, the guests, the feast, the merriment, the\nceremony--all. Telepathically and psychologically she received\nimpressions of the private car and of the joyous journey they were\ngoing to take. The papers had stated that they would spend their\nhoneymoon in Japan. Their honeymoon! Her Lester! And Mrs. Gerald was\nso attractive. She could see her now--the new Mrs. Kane--the\nonly Mrs. Kane that ever was, lying in his arms. He had held\nher so once. He had loved her. Yes, he had! There was a solid lump in\nher throat as she thought of this. Oh, dear! She sighed to herself,\nand clasped her hands forcefully; but it did no good. She was just as\nmiserable as before.\n\nWhen the day was over she was actually relieved; anyway, the deed\nwas done and nothing could change it. Vesta was sympathetically aware\nof what was happening, but kept silent. She too had seen the report in\nthe newspaper. When the first and second day after had passed Jennie\nwas much calmer mentally, for now she was face to face with the\ninevitable. But it was weeks before the sharp pain dulled to the old\nfamiliar ache. Then there were months before they would be back again,\nthough, of course, that made no difference now. Only Japan seemed so\nfar off, and somehow she had liked the thought that Lester was near\nher--somewhere in the city.\n\nThe spring and summer passed, and now it was early in October. One\nchilly day Vesta came home from school complaining of a headache. When\nJennie had given her hot milk--a favorite remedy of her\nmother's--and had advised a cold towel for the back of her head,\nVesta went to her room and lay down. The following morning she had a\nslight fever. This lingered while the local physician, Dr. Emory,\ntreated her tentatively, suspecting that it might be typhoid, of which\nthere were several cases in the village. This doctor told Jennie that\nVesta was probably strong enough constitutionally to shake it off, but\nit might be that she would have a severe siege. Mistrusting her own\nskill in so delicate a situation, Jennie sent to Chicago for a trained\nnurse, and then began a period of watchfulness which was a combination\nof fear, longing, hope, and courage.\n\nNow there could be no doubt; the disease was typhoid. Jennie\nhesitated about communicating with Lester, who was supposed to be in\nNew York; the papers had said that he intended to spend the winter\nthere. But when the doctor, after watching the case for a week,\npronounced it severe, she thought she ought to write anyhow, for no\none could tell what would happen. Lester had been so fond of Vesta. He\nwould probably want to know.\n\nThe letter sent to him did not reach him, for at the time it\narrived he was on his way to the West Indies. Jennie was compelled to\nwatch alone by Vesta's sick-bed, for although sympathetic neighbors,\nrealizing the pathos of the situation were attentive, they could not\nsupply the spiritual consolation which only those who truly love us\ncan give. There was a period when Vesta appeared to be rallying, and\nboth the physician and the nurse were hopeful; but afterward she\nbecame weaker. It was said by Dr. Emory that her heart and kidneys had\nbecome affected.\n\nThere came a time when the fact had to be faced that death was\nimminent. The doctor's face was grave, the nurse was non-committal in\nher opinion. Jennie hovered about, praying the only prayer that is\nprayer--the fervent desire of her heart concentrated on the one\nissue--that Vesta should get well. The child had come so close to\nher during the last few years! She understood her mother. She was\nbeginning to realize clearly what her life had been. And Jennie,\nthrough her, had grown to a broad understanding of responsibility. She\nknew now what it meant to be a good mother and to have children. If\nLester had not objected to it, and she had been truly married, she\nwould have been glad to have others. Again, she had always felt that\nshe owed Vesta so much--at least a long and happy life to make up\nto her for the ignominy of her birth and rearing. Jennie had been so\nhappy during the past few years to see Vesta growing into beautiful,\ngraceful, intelligent womanhood. And now she was dying. Dr. Emory\nfinally sent to Chicago for a physician friend of his, who came to\nconsider the case with him. He was an old man, grave, sympathetic,\nunderstanding. He shook his head. \"The treatment has been correct,\" he\nsaid. \"Her system does not appear to be strong enough to endure the\nstrain. Some physiques are more susceptible to this malady than\nothers.\" It was agreed that if within three days a change for the\nbetter did not come the end was close at hand.\n\nNo one can conceive the strain to which Jennie's spirit was\nsubjected by this intelligence, for it was deemed best that she should\nknow. She hovered about white-faced--feeling intensely, but\nscarcely thinking. She seemed to vibrate consciously with Vesta's\naltering states. If there was the least improvement she felt it\nphysically. If there was a decline her barometric temperament\nregistered the fact.\n\nThere was a Mrs. Davis, a fine, motherly soul of fifty, stout and\nsympathetic, who lived four doors from Jennie, and who understood\nquite well how she was feeling. She had co-operated with the nurse and\ndoctor from the start to keep Jennie's mental state as nearly normal\nas possible.\n\n\"Now, you just go to your room and lie down, Mrs. Kane,\" she would\nsay to Jennie when she found her watching helplessly at the bedside or\nwandering to and fro, wondering what to do. \"I'll take charge of\neverything. I'll do just what you would do. Lord bless you, don't you\nthink I know? I've been the mother of seven and lost three. Don't you\nthink I understand?\" Jennie put her head on her big, warm shoulder one\nday and cried. Mrs. Davis cried with her. \"I understand,\" she said.\n\"There, there, you poor dear. Now you come with me.\" And she led her\nto her sleeping-room.\n\nJennie could not be away long. She came back after a few minutes\nunrested and unrefreshed. Finally one midnight, when the nurse had\npersuaded her that all would be well until morning anyhow, there came\na hurried stirring in the sick-room. Jennie was lying down for a few\nminutes on her bed in the adjoining room. She heard it and arose. Mrs.\nDavis had come in, and she and the nurse were conferring as to Vesta's\ncondition--standing close beside her.\n\nJennie understood. She came up and looked at her daughter keenly.\nVesta's pale, waxen face told the story. She was breathing faintly,\nher eyes closed. \"She's very weak,\" whispered the nurse. Mrs. Davis\ntook Jennie's hand.\n\nThe moments passed, and after a time the clock in the hall struck\none. Miss Murfree, the nurse, moved to the medicine-table several\ntimes, wetting a soft piece of cotton cloth with alcohol and bathing\nVesta's lips. At the striking of the half-hour there was a stir of the\nweak body--a profound sigh. Jennie bent forward eagerly, but Mrs.\nDavis drew her back. The nurse came and motioned them away.\nRespiration had ceased.\n\nMrs. Davis seized Jennie firmly. \"There, there, you poor dear,\" she\nwhispered when she began to shake. \"It can't be helped. Don't\ncry.\"\n\nJennie sank on her knees beside the bed and caressed Vesta's still\nwarm hand. \"Oh no, Vesta,\" she pleaded. \"Not you! Not you!\"\n\n\"There, dear, come now,\" soothed the voice of Mrs. Davis. \"Can't\nyou leave it all in God's hands? Can't you believe that everything is\nfor the best?\"\n\nJennie felt as if the earth had fallen. All ties were broken. There\nwas no light anywhere in the immense darkness of her existence.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LIX\n\n\nThis added blow from inconsiderate fortune was quite enough to\nthrow Jennie back into that state of hyper-melancholia from which she\nhad been drawn with difficulty during the few years of comfort and\naffection which she had enjoyed with Lester in Hyde Park. It was\nreally weeks before she could realize that Vesta was gone. The\nemaciated figure which she saw for a day or two after the end did not\nseem like Vesta. Where was the joy and lightness, the quickness of\nmotion, the subtle radiance of health? All gone. Only this pale,\nlily-hued shell--and silence. Jennie had no tears to shed; only a\ndeep, insistent pain to feel. If only some counselor of eternal wisdom\ncould have whispered to her that obvious and convincing\ntruth--there are no dead.\n\nMiss Murfree, Dr. Emory, Mrs. Davis, and some others among the\nneighbors were most sympathetic and considerate. Mrs. Davis sent a\ntelegram to Lester saying that Vesta was dead, but, being absent,\nthere was no response. The house was looked after with scrupulous care\nby others, for Jennie was incapable of attending to it herself. She\nwalked about looking at things which Vesta had owned or\nliked--things which Lester or she had given her--sighing\nover the fact that Vesta would not need or use them any more. She gave\ninstructions that the body should be taken to Chicago and buried in\nthe Cemetery of the Redeemer, for Lester, at the time of Gerhardt's\ndeath, had purchased a small plot of ground there. She also expressed\nher wish that the minister of the little Lutheran church in Cottage\nGrove Avenue, where Gerhardt had attended, should be requested to say\na few words at the grave. There were the usual preliminary services at\nthe house. The local Methodist minister read a portion of the first\nepistle of Paul to the Thessalonians, and a body of Vesta's classmates\nsang \"Nearer My God to Thee.\" There were flowers, a white coffin, a\nworld of sympathetic expressions, and then Vesta was taken away. The\ncoffin was properly incased for transportation, put on the train, and\nfinally delivered at the Lutheran cemetery in Chicago.\n\nJennie moved as one in a dream. She was dazed, almost to the point\nof insensibility. Five of her neighborhood friends, at the\nsolicitation of Mrs. Davis, were kind enough to accompany her. At the\ngrave-side when the body was finally lowered she looked at it, one\nmight have thought indifferently, for she was numb from suffering. She\nreturned to Sandwood after it was all over, saying that she would not\nstay long. She wanted to come back to Chicago, where she could be near\nVesta and Gerhardt.\n\nAfter the funeral Jennie tried to think of her future. She fixed\nher mind on the need of doing something, even though she did not need\nto. She thought that she might like to try nursing, and could start at\nonce to obtain the training which was required. She also thought of\nWilliam. He was unmarried, and perhaps he might be willing to come and\nlive with her. Only she did not know where he was, and Bass was also\nin ignorance of his whereabouts. She finally concluded that she would\ntry to get work in a store. Her disposition was against idleness. She\ncould not live alone here, and she could not have her neighbors\nsympathetically worrying over what was to become of her. Miserable as\nshe was, she would be less miserable stopping in a hotel in Chicago,\nand looking for something to do, or living in a cottage somewhere near\nthe Cemetery of the Redeemer. It also occurred to her that she might\nadopt a homeless child. There were a number of orphan asylums in the\ncity.\n\nSome three weeks after Vesta's death Lester returned to Chicago\nwith his wife, and discovered the first letter, the telegram, and an\nadditional note telling him that Vesta was dead. He was truly grieved,\nfor his affection for the girl had been real. He was very sorry for\nJennie, and he told his wife that he would have to go out and see her.\nHe was wondering what she would do. She could not live alone. Perhaps\nhe could suggest something which would help her. He took the train to\nSandwood, but Jennie had gone to the Hotel Tremont in Chicago. He went\nthere, but Jennie had gone to her daughter's grave; later he called\nagain and found her in. When the boy presented his card she suffered\nan upwelling of feeling--a wave that was more intense than that\nwith which she had received him in the olden days, for now her need of\nhim was greater.\n\nLester, in spite of the glamor of his new affection and the\nrestoration of his wealth, power, and dignities, had had time to think\ndeeply of what he had done. His original feeling of doubt and\ndissatisfaction with himself had never wholly quieted. It did not ease\nhim any to know that he had left Jennie comfortably fixed, for it was\nalways so plain to him that money was not the point at issue with her.\nAffection was what she craved. Without it she was like a rudderless\nboat on an endless sea, and he knew it. She needed him, and he was\nashamed to think that his charity had not outweighed his sense of\nself-preservation and his desire for material advantage. To-day as the\nelevator carried him up to her room he was really sorry, though he\nknew now that no act of his could make things right. He had been to\nblame from the very beginning, first for taking her, then for failing\nto stick by a bad bargain. Well, it could not be helped now. The best\nthing he could do was to be fair, to counsel with her, to give her the\nbest of his sympathy and advice.\n\n\"Hello, Jennie,\" he said familiarly as she opened the door to him\nin her hotel room, his glance taking in the ravages which death and\nsuffering had wrought. She was thinner, her face quite drawn and\ncolorless, her eyes larger by contrast. \"I'm awfully sorry about\nVesta,\" he said a little awkwardly. \"I never dreamed anything like\nthat could happen.\"\n\nIt was the first word of comfort which had meant anything to her\nsince Vesta died--since Lester had left her, in fact. It touched\nher that he had come to sympathize; for the moment she could not\nspeak. Tears welled over her eyelids and down upon her cheeks.\n\n\"Don't cry, Jennie,\" he said, putting his arm around her and\nholding her head to his shoulder. \"I'm sorry. I've been sorry for a\ngood many things that can't be helped now. I'm intensely sorry for\nthis. Where did you bury her?\"\n\n\"Beside papa,\" she said, sobbing.\n\n\"Too bad,\" he murmured, and held her in silence. She finally gained\ncontrol of herself sufficiently to step away from him; then wiping her\neyes with her handkerchief, she asked him to sit down.\n\n\"I'm so sorry,\" he went on, \"that this should have happened while I\nwas away. I would have been with you if I had been here. I suppose you\nwon't want to live out at Sand wood now?\"\n\n\"I can't, Lester,\" she replied. \"I couldn't stand it.\"\n\n\"Where are you thinking of going?\"\n\n\"Oh, I don't know yet. I didn't want to be a bother to those people\nout there. I thought I'd get a little house somewhere and adopt a baby\nmaybe, or get something to do. I don't like to be alone.\"\n\n\"That isn't a bad idea,\" he said, \"that of adopting a baby. It\nwould be a lot of company for you. You know how to go about getting\none?\"\n\n\"You just ask at one of these asylums, don't you?\"\n\n\"I think there's something more than that,\" he replied\nthoughtfully. \"There are some formalities--I don't know what they\nare. They try to keep control of the child in some way. You had better\nconsult with Watson and get him to help you. Pick out your baby, and\nthen let him do the rest. I'll speak to him about it.\"\n\nLester saw that she needed companionship badly. \"Where is your\nbrother George?\" he asked.\n\n\"He's in Rochester, but he couldn't come. Bass said he was\nmarried,\" she added.\n\n\"There isn't any other member of the family you could persuade to\ncome and live with you?\"\n\n\"I might get William, but I don't know where he is.\"\n\n\"Why not try that new section west of Jackson Park,\" he suggested,\n\"if you want a house here in Chicago? I see some nice cottages out\nthat way. You needn't buy. Just rent until you see how well you're\nsatisfied.\"\n\nJennie thought this good advice because it came from Lester. It was\ngood of him to take this much interest in her affairs. She wasn't\nentirely separated from him after all. He cared a little. She asked\nhim how his wife was, whether he had had a pleasant trip, whether he\nwas going to stay in Chicago. All the while he was thinking that he\nhad treated her badly. He went to the window and looked down into\nDearborn Street, the world of traffic below holding his attention. The\ngreat mass of trucks and vehicles, the counter streams of hurrying\npedestrians, seemed like a puzzle. So shadows march in a dream. It was\ngrowing dusk, and lights were springing up here and there.\n\n\"I want to tell you something, Jennie,\" said Lester, finally\nrousing himself from his fit of abstraction. \"I may seem peculiar to\nyou, after all that has happened, but I still care for you--in my\nway. I've thought of you right along since I left. I thought it good\nbusiness to leave you--the way things were. I thought I liked\nLetty well enough to marry her. From one point of view it still seems\nbest, but I'm not so much happier. I was just as happy with you as I\never will be. It isn't myself that's important in this transaction\napparently; the individual doesn't count much in the situation. I\ndon't know whether you see what I'm driving at, but all of us are more\nor less pawns. We're moved about like chessmen by circumstances over\nwhich we have no control.\"\n\n\"I understand, Lester,\" she answered. \"I'm not complaining. I know\nit's for the best.\"\n\n\"After all, life is more or less of a farce,\" he went on a little\nbitterly. \"It's a silly show. The best we can do is to hold our\npersonality intact. It doesn't appear that integrity has much to do\nwith it.\"\n\nJennie did not quite grasp what he was talking about, but she knew\nit meant that he was not entirely satisfied with himself and was sorry\nfor her.\n\n\"Don't worry over me, Lester,\" she consoled. \"I'm all right; I'll\nget along. It did seem terrible to me for a while--getting used\nto being alone. I'll be all right now. I'll get along.\"\n\n\"I want you to feel that my attitude hasn't changed,\" he continued\neagerly. \"I'm interested in what concerns you. Mrs.--Letty\nunderstands that. She knows just how I feel. When you get settled I'll\ncome in and see how you're fixed. I'll come around here again in a few\ndays. You understand how I feel, don't you?\"\n\n\"Yes, I do,\" she said.\n\nHe took her hand, turning it sympathetically in his own. \"Don't\nworry,\" he said. \"I don't want you to do that. I'll do the best I can.\nYou're still Jennie to me, if you don't mind. I'm pretty bad, but I'm\nnot all bad.\"\n\n\"It's all right, Lester. I wanted you to do as you did. It's for\nthe best. You probably are happy since--\"\n\n\"Now, Jennie,\" he interrupted; then he pressed affectionately her\nhand, her arm, her shoulder. \"Want to kiss me for old times' sake?\" he\nsmiled.\n\nShe put her hands over his shoulders, looked long into his eyes,\nthen kissed him. When their lips met she trembled. Lester also felt\nunsteady. Jennie saw his agitation, and tried hard to speak.\n\n\"You'd better go now,\" she said firmly. \"It's getting dark.\"\n\nHe went away, and yet he knew that he wanted above all things to\nremain; she was still the one woman in the world for him. And Jennie\nfelt comforted even though the separation still existed in all its\nfinality. She did not endeavor to explain or adjust the moral and\nethical entanglements of the situation. She was not, like so many,\nendeavoring to put the ocean into a tea-cup, or to tie up the shifting\nuniverse in a mess of strings called law. Lester still cared for her a\nlittle. He cared for Letty too. That was all right. She had hoped once\nthat he might want her only. Since he did not, was his affection worth\nnothing? She could not think, she could not feel that. And neither\ncould he.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LX\n\n\nThe drift of events for a period of five years carried Lester and\nJennie still farther apart; they settled naturally into their\nrespective spheres, without the renewal of the old time relationship\nwhich their several meetings at the Tremont at first seemed to\nforeshadow. Lester was in the thick of social and commercial affairs;\nhe walked in paths to which Jennie's retiring soul had never aspired.\nJennie's own existence was quiet and uneventful. There was a simple\ncottage in a very respectable but not showy neighborhood near Jackson\nPark, on the South Side, where she lived in retirement with a little\nfoster-child--a chestnut-haired girl taken from the Western Home\nfor the Friendless--as her sole companion. Here she was known as\nMrs. J. G. Stover, for she had deemed it best to abandon the name of\nKane. Mr. and Mrs. Lester Kane when resident in Chicago were the\noccupants of a handsome mansion on the Lake Shore Drive, where\nparties, balls, receptions, dinners were given in rapid and at times\nalmost pyrotechnic succession.\n\nLester, however, had become in his way a lover of a peaceful and\nwell-entertained existence. He had cut from his list of acquaintances\nand associates a number of people who had been a little doubtful or\noverfamiliar or indifferent or talkative during a certain period which\nto him was a memory merely. He was a director, and in several cases\nthe chairman of a board of directors, in nine of the most important\nfinancial and commercial organizations of the West--The United\nTraction Company of Cincinnati, The Western Crucible Company, The\nUnited Carriage Company, The Second National Bank of Chicago, the\nFirst National Bank of Cincinnati, and several others of equal\nimportance. He was never a personal factor in the affairs of The\nUnited Carriage Company, preferring to be represented by\ncounsel--Mr. Dwight L. Watson, but he took a keen interest in its\naffairs. He had not seen his brother Robert to speak to him in seven\nyears. He had not seen Imogene, who lived in Chicago, in three.\nLouise, Amy, their husbands, and some of their closest acquaintances\nwere practically strangers. The firm of Knight, Keatley & O'Brien\nhad nothing whatever to do with his affairs.\n\nThe truth was that Lester, in addition to becoming a little\nphlegmatic, was becoming decidedly critical in his outlook on life. He\ncould not make out what it was all about. In distant ages a queer\nthing had come to pass. There had started on its way in the form of\nevolution a minute cellular organism which had apparently reproduced\nitself by division, had early learned to combine itself with others,\nto organize itself into bodies, strange forms of fish, animals, and\nbirds, and had finally learned to organize itself into man. Man, on\nhis part, composed as he was of self-organizing cells, was pushing\nhimself forward into comfort and different aspects of existence by\nmeans of union and organization with other men. Why? Heaven only knew.\nHere he was endowed with a peculiar brain and a certain amount of\ntalent, and he had inherited a certain amount of wealth which he now\nscarcely believed he deserved, only luck had favored him. But he could\nnot see that any one else might be said to deserve this wealth any\nmore than himself, seeing that his use of it was as conservative and\nconstructive and practical as the next one's. He might have been born\npoor, in which case he would have been as well satisfied as the next\none--not more so. Why should he complain, why worry, why\nspeculate?--the world was going steadily forward of its own\nvolition, whether he would or no. Truly it was. And was there any need\nfor him to disturb himself about it? There was not. He fancied at\ntimes that it might as well never have been started at all. \"The one\ndivine, far-off event\" of the poet did not appeal to him as having any\nbasis in fact. Mrs. Lester Kane was of very much the same opinion.\n\nJennie, living on the South Side with her adopted child, Rose\nPerpetua, was of no fixed conclusion as to the meaning of life. She\nhad not the incisive reasoning capacity of either Mr. or Mrs. Lester\nKane. She had seen a great deal, suffered a great deal, and had read\nsome in a desultory way. Her mind had never grasped the nature and\ncharacter of specialized knowledge. History, physics, chemistry,\nbotany, geology, and sociology were not fixed departments in her brain\nas they were in Lester's and Letty's. Instead there was the feeling\nthat the world moved in some strange, unstable way. Apparently no one\nknew clearly what it was all about. People were born and died. Some\nbelieved that the world had been made six thousand years before; some\nthat it was millions of years old. Was it all blind chance, or was\nthere some guiding intelligence--a God? Almost in spite of\nherself she felt there must be something--a higher power which\nproduced all the beautiful things--the flowers, the stars, the\ntrees, the grass. Nature was so beautiful! If at times life seemed\ncruel, yet this beauty still persisted. The thought comforted her; she\nfed upon it in her hours of secret loneliness.\n\nIt has been said that Jennie was naturally of an industrious turn.\nShe liked to be employed, though she thought constantly as she worked.\nShe was of matronly proportions in these days--not disagreeably\nlarge, but full bodied, shapely, and smooth-faced in spite of her\ncares. Her eyes were gray and appealing. Her hair was still of a rich\nbrown, but there were traces of gray in it. Her neighbors spoke of her\nas sweet-tempered, kindly, and hospitable. They knew nothing of her\nhistory, except that she had formerly resided in Sandwood, and before\nthat in Cleveland. She was very reticent as to her past.\n\nJennie had fancied, because of her natural aptitude for taking care\nof sick people, that she might get to be a trained nurse. But she was\nobliged to abandon that idea, for she found that only young people\nwere wanted. She also thought that some charitable organization might\nemploy her, but she did not understand the new theory of charity which\nwas then coming into general acceptance and practice--namely,\nonly to help others to help themselves. She believed in giving, and\nwas not inclined to look too closely into the credentials of those who\nasked for help; consequently her timid inquiry at one relief agency\nafter another met with indifference, if not unqualified rebuke. She\nfinally decided to adopt another child for Rose Perpetua's sake; she\nsucceeded in securing a boy, four years old, who was known as\nHenry--Henry Stover. Her support was assured, for her income was\npaid to her through a trust company. She had no desire for speculation\nor for the devious ways of trade. The care of flowers, the nature of\nchildren, the ordering of a home were more in her province.\n\nOne of the interesting things in connection with this separation\nonce it had been firmly established related to Robert and Lester, for\nthese two since the reading of the will a number of years before had\nnever met. Robert had thought of his brother often. He had followed\nhis success since he had left Jennie with interest. He read of his\nmarriage to Mrs. Gerald with pleasure; he had always considered her an\nideal companion for his brother. He knew by many signs and tokens that\nhis brother, since the unfortunate termination of their father's\nattitude and his own peculiar movements to gain control of the Kane\nCompany, did not like him. Still they had never been so far apart\nmentally--certainly not in commercial judgment. Lester was\nprosperous now. He could afford to be generous. He could afford to\nmake up. And after all, he had done his best to aid his brother to\ncome to his senses--and with the best intentions. There were\nmutual interests they could share financially if they were friends. He\nwondered from time to time if Lester would not be friendly with\nhim.\n\nTime passed, and then once, when he was in Chicago, he made the\nfriends with whom he was driving purposely turn into the North Shore\nin order to see the splendid mansion which the Kanes occupied. He knew\nits location from hearsay and description.\n\nWhen he saw it a touch of the old Kane home atmosphere came back to\nhim. Lester in revising the property after purchase had had a\nconservatory built on one side not unlike the one at home in\nCincinnati. That same night he sat down and wrote Lester asking if he\nwould not like to dine with him at the Union Club. He was only in town\nfor a day or two, and he would like to see him again. There was some\nfeeling he knew, but there was a proposition he would like to talk to\nhim about. Would he come, say, on Thursday?\n\nOn the receipt of this letter Lester frowned and fell into a brown\nstudy. He had never really been healed of the wound that his father\nhad given him. He had never been comfortable in his mind since Robert\nhad deserted him so summarily. He realized now that the stakes his\nbrother had been playing for were big. But, after all, he had been his\nbrother, and if he had been in Robert's place at the time, he would\nnot have done as he had done; at least he hoped not. Now Robert wanted\nto see him.\n\nHe thought once of not answering at all. Then he thought he would\nwrite and say no. But a curious desire to see Robert again, to hear\nwhat he had to say, to listen to the proposition he had to offer, came\nover him; he decided to write yes. It could do no harm. He knew it\ncould do no good. They might agree to let by-gones be by-gones, but\nthe damage had been done. Could a broken bowl be mended and called\nwhole? It might be called whole, but what of it? Was it not\nbroken and mended? He wrote and intimated that he would come.\n\nOn the Thursday in question Robert called up from the Auditorium to\nremind him of the engagement. Lester listened curiously to the sound\nof his voice. \"All right,\" he said, \"I'll be with you.\" At noon he\nwent down-town, and there, within the exclusive precincts of the Union\nClub, the two brothers met and looked at each other again. Robert was\nthinner than when Lester had seen him last, and a little grayer. His\neyes were bright and steely, but there were crow's-feet on either\nside. His manner was quick, keen, dynamic. Lester was noticeably of\nanother type--solid, brusque, and indifferent. Men spoke of\nLester these days as a little hard. Robert's keen blue eyes did not\ndisturb him in the least--did not affect him in any way. He saw\nhis brother just as he was, for he had the larger philosophic and\ninterpretative insight; but Robert could not place Lester exactly. He\ncould not fathom just what had happened to him in these years. Lester\nwas stouter, not gray, for some reason, but sandy and ruddy, looking\nlike a man who was fairly well satisfied to take life as he found it.\nLester looked at his brother with a keen, steady eye. The latter\nshifted a little, for he was restless. He could see that there was no\nloss of that mental force and courage which had always been\npredominant characteristics in Lester's make-up.\n\n\"I thought I'd like to see you again, Lester,\" Robert remarked,\nafter they had clasped hands in the customary grip. \"It's been a long\ntime now--nearly eight years, hasn't it?\"\n\n\"About that,\" replied Lester. \"How are things with you?\"\n\n\"Oh, about the same. You've been fairly well, I see.\"\n\n\"Never sick,\" said Lester. \"A little cold now and then. I don't\noften go to bed with anything. How's your wife?\"\n\n\"Oh, Margaret's fine.\"\n\n\"And the children?\"\n\n\"We don't see much of Ralph and Berenice since they married, but\nthe others are around more or less. I suppose your wife is all right,\"\nhe said hesitatingly. It was difficult ground for Robert.\n\nLester eyed him without a change of expression.\n\n\"Yes,\" he replied. \"She enjoys pretty fair health. She's quite well\nat present.\"\n\nThey drifted mentally for a few moments, while Lester inquired\nafter the business, and Amy, Louise, and Imogene. He admitted frankly\nthat he neither saw nor heard from them nowadays. Robert told him what\nhe could.\n\n\"The thing that I was thinking of in connection with you, Lester,\"\nsaid Robert finally, \"is this matter of the Western Crucible Steel\nCompany. You haven't been sitting there as a director in person I\nnotice, but your attorney, Watson, has been acting for you. Clever\nman, that. The management isn't right--we all know that. We need\na practical steel man at the head of it, if the thing is ever going to\npay properly. I have voted my stock with yours right along because the\npropositions made by Watson have been right. He agrees with me that\nthings ought to be changed. Now I have a chance to buy seventy shares\nheld by Rossiter's widow. That with yours and mine would give us\ncontrol of the company. I would like to have you take them, though it\ndoesn't make a bit of difference so long as it's in the family. You\ncan put any one you please in for president, and we'll make the thing\ncome out right.\"\n\nLester smiled. It was a pleasant proposition. Watson had told him\nthat Robert's interests were co-operating with him. Lester had long\nsuspected that Robert would like to make up. This was the olive\nbranch--the control of a property worth in the neighborhood of a\nmillion and a half.\n\n\"That's very nice of you,\" said Lester solemnly. \"It's a rather\nliberal thing to do. What makes you want to do it now?\"\n\n\"Well, to tell you the honest truth, Lester,\" replied Robert, \"I\nnever did feel right about that will business. I never did feel right\nabout that secretary-treasurership and some other things that have\nhappened. I don't want to rake up the past--you smile at\nthat--but I can't help telling you how I feel. I've been pretty\nambitious in the past. I was pretty ambitious just about the time that\nfather died to get this United Carriage scheme under way, and I was\nafraid you might not like it. I have thought since that I ought not to\nhave done it, but I did. I suppose you're not anxious to hear any more\nabout that old affair. This other thing though--\"\n\n\"Might be handed out as a sort of compensation,\" put in Lester\nquietly.\n\n\"Not exactly that, Lester--though it may have something of\nthat in it. I know these things don't matter very much to you now. I\nknow that the time to do things was years ago--not now. Still I\nthought sincerely that you might be interested in this proposition. It\nmight lead to other things. Frankly, I thought it might patch up\nmatters between us. We're brothers after all.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Lester, \"we're brothers.\"\n\nHe was thinking as he said this of the irony of the situation. How\nmuch had this sense of brotherhood been worth in the past? Robert had\npractically forced him into his present relationship, and while Jennie\nhad been really the only one to suffer, he could not help feeling\nangry. It was true that Robert had not cut him out of his one-fourth\nof his father's estate, but certainly he had not helped him to get it,\nand now Robert was thinking that this offer of his might mend things.\nIt hurt him--Lester--a little. It irritated him. Life was\nstrange.\n\n\"I can't see it, Robert,\" he said finally and determinedly. \"I can\nappreciate the motive that prompts you to make this offer. But I can't\nsee the wisdom of my taking it. Your opportunity is your opportunity.\nI don't want it. We can make all the changes you suggest if you take\nthe stock. I'm rich enough anyhow. Bygones are bygones. I'm perfectly\nwilling to talk with you from time to time. That's all you want. This\nother thing is simply a sop with which to plaster an old wound. You\nwant my friendship and so far as I'm concerned you have that. I don't\nhold any grudge against you. I won't.\"\n\nRobert looked at him fixedly. He half smiled. He admired Lester in\nspite of all that he had done to him--in spite of all that Lester\nwas doing to him now.\n\n\"I don't know but what you're right, Lester,\" he admitted finally.\n\"I didn't make this offer in any petty spirit though. I wanted to\npatch up this matter of feeling between us. I won't say anything more\nabout it. You're not coming down to Cincinnati soon, are you?\"\n\n\"I don't expect to,\" replied Lester.\n\n\"If you do I'd like to have you come and stay with us. Bring your\nwife. We could talk over old times.\"\n\nLester smiled an enigmatic smile.\n\n\"I'll be glad to,\" he said, without emotion. But he remembered that\nin the days of Jennie it was different. They would never have receded\nfrom their position regarding her. \"Well,\" he thought, \"perhaps I\ncan't blame them. Let it go.\"\n\nThey talked on about other things. Finally Lester remembered an\nappointment. \"I'll have to leave you soon,\" he said, looking at his\nwatch.\n\n\"I ought to go, too,\" said Robert. They rose. \"Well, anyhow,\" he\nadded, as they walked toward the cloakroom, \"we won't be absolute\nstrangers in the future, will we?\"\n\n\"Certainly not,\" said Lester. \"I'll see you from time to time.\"\nThey shook hands and separated amicably. There was a sense of\nunsatisfied obligation and some remorse in Robert's mind as he saw his\nbrother walking briskly away. Lester was an able man. Why was it that\nthere was so much feeling between them--had been even before\nJennie had appeared? Then he remembered his old thoughts about \"snaky\ndeeds.\" That was what his brother lacked, and that only. He was not\ncrafty; not darkly cruel, hence. \"What a world!\" he thought.\n\nOn his part Lester went away feeling a slight sense of opposition\nto, but also of sympathy for, his brother. He was not so terribly\nbad--not different from other men. Why criticize? What would he\nhave done if he had been in Robert's place? Robert was getting along.\nSo was he. He could see now how it all came about--why he had\nbeen made the victim, why his brother had been made the keeper of the\ngreat fortune. \"It's the way the world runs,\" he thought. \"What\ndifference does it make? I have enough to live on. Why not let it go\nat that?\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXI\n\n\nThe days of man under the old dispensation, or, rather, according\nto that supposedly biblical formula, which persists, are threescore\nyears and ten. It is so ingrained in the race-consciousness by\nmouth-to-mouth utterance that it seems the profoundest of truths. As a\nmatter of fact, man, even under his mortal illusion, is organically\nbuilt to live five times the period of his maturity, and would do so\nif he but knew that it is spirit which endures, that age is an\nillusion, and that there is no death. Yet the race-thought, gained\nfrom what dream of materialism we know not, persists, and the death of\nman under the mathematical formula so fearfully accepted is daily\nregistered.\n\nLester was one of those who believed in this formula. He was\nnearing sixty. He thought he had, say, twenty years more at the utmost\nto live--perhaps not so long. Well, he had lived comfortably. He\nfelt that he could not complain. If death was coming, let it come. He\nwas ready at any time. No complaint or resistance would issue from\nhim. Life, in most of its aspects, was a silly show anyhow.\n\nHe admitted that it was mostly illusion--easily proved to be\nso. That it might all be one he sometimes suspected. It was very much\nlike a dream in its composition truly--sometimes like a very bad\ndream. All he had to sustain him in his acceptance of its reality from\nhour to hour and day to day was apparent contact with this material\nproposition and that--people, meetings of boards of directors,\nindividuals and organizations planning to do this and that, his wife's\nsocial functions Letty loved him as a fine, grizzled example of a\nphilosopher. She admired, as Jennie had, his solid, determined,\nphlegmatic attitude in the face of troubled circumstance. All the\nwinds of fortune or misfortune could not apparently excite or disturb\nLester. He refused to be frightened. He refused to budge from his\nbeliefs and feelings, and usually had to be pushed away from them,\nstill believing, if he were gotten away at all. He refused to do\nanything save as he always said, \"Look the facts in the face\" and\nfight. He could be made to fight easily enough if imposed upon, but\nonly in a stubborn, resisting way. His plan was to resist every effort\nto coerce him to the last ditch. If he had to let go in the end he\nwould when compelled, but his views as to the value of not letting go\nwere quite the same even when he had let go under compulsion.\n\nHis views of living were still decidedly material, grounded in\ncreature comforts, and he had always insisted upon having the best of\neverything. If the furnishings of his home became the least dingy he\nwas for having them torn out and sold and the house done over. If he\ntraveled, money must go ahead of him and smooth the way. He did not\nwant argument, useless talk, or silly palaver as he called it. Every\none must discuss interesting topics with him or not talk at all. Letty\nunderstood him thoroughly. She would chuck him under the chin\nmornings, or shake his solid head between her hands, telling him he\nwas a brute, but a nice kind of a brute. \"Yes, yes,\" he would growl.\n\"I know. I'm an animal, I suppose. You're a seraphic suggestion of\nattenuated thought.\"\n\n\"No; you hush,\" she would reply, for at times he could cut like a\nknife without really meaning to be unkind. Then he would pet her a\nlittle, for, in spite of her vigorous conception of life, he realized\nthat she was more or less dependent upon him. It was always so plain\nto her that he could get along without her. For reasons of kindliness\nhe was trying to conceal this, to pretend the necessity of her\npresence, but it was so obvious that he really could dispense with her\neasily enough. Now Letty did depend upon Lester. It was something, in\nso shifty and uncertain a world, to be near so fixed and determined a\nquantity as this bear-man. It was like being close to a warmly glowing\nlamp in the dark or a bright burning fire in the cold. Lester was not\nafraid of anything. He felt that he knew how to live and to die.\n\nIt was natural that a temperament of this kind should have its\nsolid, material manifestation at every point. Having his financial\naffairs well in hand, most of his holding being shares of big\ncompanies, where boards of solemn directors merely approved the\nstrenuous efforts of ambitious executives to \"make good,\" he had\nleisure for living. He and Letty were fond of visiting the various\nAmerican and European watering-places. He gambled a little, for he\nfound that there was considerable diversion in risking interesting\nsums on the spin of a wheel or the fortuitous roll of a ball; and he\ntook more and more to drinking, not in the sense that a drunkard takes\nto it, but as a high liver, socially, and with all his friends. He was\ninclined to drink the rich drinks when he did not take straight\nwhiskey--champagne, sparkling Burgundy, the expensive and\neffervescent white wines. When he drank he could drink a great deal,\nand he ate in proportion. Nothing must be served but the\nbest--soup, fish, entree, roast, game, dessert--everything\nthat made up a showy dinner and he had long since determined that only\na high-priced chef was worth while. They had found an old cordon\nbleu, Louis Berdot, who had served in the house of one of the\ngreat dry goods princes, and this man he engaged. He cost Lester a\nhundred dollars a week, but his reply to any question was that he only\nhad one life to live.\n\nThe trouble with this attitude was that it adjusted nothing,\nimproved nothing, left everything to drift on toward an indefinite\nend. If Lester had married Jennie and accepted the comparatively\nmeager income of ten thousand a year he would have maintained the same\nattitude to the end. It would have led him to a stolid indifference to\nthe social world of which now necessarily he was a part. He would have\ndrifted on with a few mentally compatible cronies who would have\naccepted him for what he was--a good fellow--and Jennie in\nthe end would not have been so much better off than she was now.\n\nOne of the changes which was interesting was that the Kanes\ntransferred their residence to New York. Mrs. Kane had become very\nintimate with a group of clever women in the Eastern four hundred, or\nnine hundred, and had been advised and urged to transfer the scene of\nher activities to New York. She finally did so, leasing a house in\nSeventy-eighth Street, near Madison Avenue. She installed a novelty\nfor her, a complete staff of liveried servants, after the English\nfashion, and had the rooms of her house done in correlative periods.\nLester smiled at her vanity and love of show.\n\n\"You talk about your democracy,\" he grunted one day. \"You have as\nmuch democracy as I have religion, and that's none at all.\"\n\n\"Why, how you talk!\" she denied. \"I am democratic. We all run in\nclasses. You do. I'm merely accepting the logic of the situation.\"\n\n\"The logic of your grandmother! Do you call a butler and doorman in\nred velvet a part of the necessity of the occasion?\"\n\n\"I certainly do,\" she replied. \"Maybe not the necessity exactly,\nbut the spirit surely. Why should you quarrel? You're the first one to\ninsist on perfection--to quarrel if there is any flaw in the\norder of things.\"\n\n\"You never heard me quarrel.\"\n\n\"Oh, I don't mean that literally. But you demand\nperfection--the exact spirit of the occasion, and you know\nit.\"\n\n\"Maybe I do, but what has that to do with your democracy?\"\n\n\"I am democratic. I insist on it. I'm as democratic in spirit as\nany woman. Only I see things as they are, and conform as much as\npossible for comfort's sake, and so do you. Don't you throw rocks at\nmy glass house, Mister Master. Yours is so transparent I can see every\nmove you make inside.\"\n\n\"I'm democratic and you're not,\" he teased; but he approved\nthoroughly of everything she did. She was, he sometimes fancied, a\nbetter executive in her world than he was in his.\n\nDrifting in this fashion, wining, dining, drinking the waters of\nthis curative spring and that, traveling in luxurious ease and taking\nno physical exercise, finally altered his body from a vigorous,\nquick-moving, well-balanced organism into one where plethora of\nsubstance was clogging every essential function. His liver, kidneys,\nspleen, pancreas--every organ, in fact--had been overtaxed\nfor some time to keep up the process of digestion and elimination. In\nthe past seven years he had become uncomfortably heavy. His kidneys\nwere weak, and so were the arteries of his brain. By dieting, proper\nexercise, the right mental attitude, he might have lived to be eighty\nor ninety. As a matter of fact, he was allowing himself to drift into\na physical state in which even a slight malady might prove dangerous.\nThe result was inevitable, and it came.\n\nIt so happened that he and Letty had gone to the North Cape on a\ncruise with a party of friends. Lester, in order to attend to some\nimportant business, decided to return to Chicago late in November; he\narranged to have his wife meet him in New York just before the\nChristmas holidays. He wrote Watson to expect him, and engaged rooms\nat the Auditorium, for he had sold the Chicago residence some two\nyears before and was now living permanently in New York.\n\nOne late November day, after having attended to a number of details\nand cleared up his affairs very materially, Lester was seized with\nwhat the doctor who was called to attend him described as a cold in\nthe intestines--a disturbance usually symptomatic of some other\nweakness, either of the blood or of some organ. He suffered great\npain, and the usual remedies in that case were applied. There were\nbandages of red flannel with a mustard dressing, and specifics were\nalso administered. He experienced some relief, but he was troubled\nwith a sense of impending disaster. He had Watson cable his\nwife--there was nothing serious about it, but he was ill. A\ntrained nurse was in attendance and his valet stood guard at the door\nto prevent annoyance of any kind. It was plain that Letty could not\nreach Chicago under three weeks. He had the feeling that he would not\nsee her again.\n\nCuriously enough, not only because he was in Chicago, but because\nhe had never been spiritually separated from Jennie, he was thinking\nabout her constantly at this time. He had intended to go out and see\nher just as soon as he was through with his business engagements and\nbefore he left the city. He had asked Watson how she was getting\nalong, and had been informed that everything was well with her. She\nwas living quietly and looking in good health, so Watson said. Lester\nwished he could see her.\n\nThis thought grew as the days passed and he grew no better. He was\nsuffering from time to time with severe attacks of griping pains that\nseemed to tie his viscera into knots, and left him very weak. Several\ntimes the physician administered cocaine with a needle in order to\nrelieve him of useless pain.\n\nAfter one of the severe attacks he called Watson to his side, told\nhim to send the nurse away, and then said: \"Watson, I'd like to have\nyou do me a favor. Ask Mrs. Stover if she won't come here to see me.\nYou'd better go and get her. Just send the nurse and Kozo (the valet)\naway for the afternoon, or while she's here. If she comes at any other\ntime I'd like to have her admitted.\"\n\nWatson understood. He liked this expression of sentiment. He was\nsorry for Jennie. He was sorry for Lester. He wondered what the world\nwould think if it could know of this bit of romance in connection with\nso prominent a man. Lester was decent. He had made Watson prosperous.\nThe latter was only too glad to serve him in any way.\n\nHe called a carriage and rode out to Jennie's residence. He found\nher watering some plants; her face expressed her surprise at his\nunusual presence.\n\n\"I come on a rather troublesome errand, Mrs. Stover,\" he said,\nusing her assumed name. \"Your--that is, Mr. Kane is quite sick at\nthe Auditorium. His wife is in Europe, and he wanted to know if I\nwouldn't come out here and ask you to come and see him. He wanted me\nto bring you, if possible. Could you come with me now?\"\n\n\"Why yes,\" said Jennie, her face a study. The children were in\nschool. An old Swedish housekeeper was in the kitchen. She could go as\nwell as not. But there was coming back to her in detail a dream she\nhad had several nights before. It had seemed to her that she was out\non a dark, mystic body of water over which was hanging something like\na fog, or a pall of smoke. She heard the water ripple, or stir\nfaintly, and then out of the surrounding darkness a boat appeared. It\nwas a little boat, oarless, or not visibly propelled, and in it were\nher mother, and Vesta, and some one whom she could not make out. Her\nmother's face was pale and sad, very much as she had often seen it in\nlife. She looked at Jennie solemnly, sympathetically, and then\nsuddenly Jennie realized that the third occupant of the boat was\nLester. He looked at her gloomily--an expression she had never\nseen on his face before--and then her mother remarked, \"Well, we\nmust go now.\" The boat began to move, a great sense of loss came over\nher, and she cried, \"Oh, don't leave me, mamma!\"\n\nBut her mother only looked at her out of deep, sad, still eyes, and\nthe boat was gone.\n\nShe woke with a start, half fancying that Lester was beside her.\nShe stretched out her hand to touch his arm; then she drew herself up\nin the dark and rubbed her eyes, realizing that she was alone. A great\nsense of depression remained with her, and for two days it haunted\nher. Then, when it seemed as if it were nothing, Mr. Watson appeared\nwith his ominous message.\n\nShe went to dress, and reappeared, looking as troubled as were her\nthoughts. She was very pleasing in her appearance yet, a sweet, kindly\nwoman, well dressed and shapely. She had never been separated mentally\nfrom Lester, just as he had never grown entirely away from her. She\nwas always with him in thought, just as in the years when they were\ntogether. Her fondest memories were of the days when he first courted\nher in Cleveland--the days when he had carried her off, much as\nthe cave-man seized his mate--by force. Now she longed to do what\nshe could for him. For this call was as much a testimony as a shock.\nHe loved her--he loved her, after all.\n\nThe carriage rolled briskly through the long streets into the smoky\ndown-town district. It arrived at the Auditorium, and Jennie was\nescorted to Lester's room. Watson had been considerate. He had talked\nlittle, leaving her to her thoughts. In this great hotel she felt\ndiffident after so long a period of complete retirement. As she\nentered the room she looked at Lester with large, gray, sympathetic\neyes. He was lying propped up on two pillows, his solid head with its\ngrowth of once dark brown hair slightly grayed. He looked at her\ncuriously out of his wise old eyes, a light of sympathy and affection\nshining in them--weary as they were. Jennie was greatly\ndistressed. His pale face, slightly drawn from suffering, cut her like\na knife. She took his hand, which was outside the coverlet, and\npressed it. She leaned over and kissed his lips.\n\n\"I'm so sorry, Lester,\" she murmured. \"I'm so sorry. You're not\nvery sick though, are you? You must get well, Lester--and soon!\"\nShe patted his hand gently.\n\n\"Yes, Jennie, but I'm pretty bad,\" he said. \"I don't feel right\nabout this business. I don't seem able to shake it off. But tell me,\nhow have you been?\"\n\n\"Oh, just the same, dear,\" she replied. \"I'm all right. You mustn't\ntalk like that, though. You're going to be all right very soon\nnow.\"\n\nHe smiled grimly. \"Do you think so?\" He shook his head, for he\nthought differently. \"Sit down, dear,\" he went on, \"I'm not worrying\nabout that. I want to talk to you again. I want you near me.\" He\nsighed and shut his eyes for a minute.\n\nShe drew up a chair close beside the bed, her face toward his, and\ntook his hand. It seemed such a beautiful thing that he should send\nfor her. Her eyes showed the mingled sympathy, affection, and\ngratitude of her heart. At the same time fear gripped her; how ill he\nlooked!\n\n\"I can't tell what may happen,\" he went on. \"Letty is in Europe.\nI've wanted to see you again for some time. I was coming out this\ntrip. We are living in New York, you know. You're a little stouter,\nJennie.\"\n\n\"Yes, I'm getting old, Lester,\" she smiled.\n\n\"Oh, that doesn't make any difference,\" he replied, looking at her\nfixedly. \"Age doesn't count. We are all in that boat. It's how we feel\nabout life.\"\n\nHe stopped and stared at the ceiling. A slight twinge of pain\nreminded him of the vigorous seizures he had been through. He couldn't\nstand many more paroxysms like the last one.\n\n\"I couldn't go, Jennie, without seeing you again,\" he observed,\nwhen the slight twinge ceased and he was free to think again. \"I've\nalways wanted to say to you, Jennie,\" he went on, \"that I haven't been\nsatisfied with the way we parted. It wasn't the right thing, after\nall. I haven't been any happier. I'm sorry. I wish now, for my own\npeace of mind, that I hadn't done it.\"\n\n\"Don't say that, Lester,\" she demurred, going over in her mind all\nthat had been between them. This was such a testimony to their real\nunion--their real spiritual compatibility. \"It's all right. It\ndoesn't make any difference. You've been very good to me. I wouldn't\nhave been satisfied to have you lose your fortune. It couldn't be that\nway. I've been a lot better satisfied as it is. It's been hard, but,\ndear, everything is hard at times.\" She paused.\n\n\"No,\" he said. \"It wasn't right. The thing wasn't worked out right\nfrom the start; but that wasn't your fault. I'm sorry. I wanted to\ntell you that. I'm glad I'm here to do it.\"\n\n\"Don't talk that way, Lester--please don't,\" she pleaded.\n\"It's all right. You needn't be sorry. There's nothing to be sorry\nfor. You have always been so good to me. Why, when I think--\" she\nstopped, for it was hard for her to speak. She was choking with\naffection and sympathy. She pressed his hands. She was recalling the\nhouse he took for her family in Cleveland, his generous treatment of\nGerhardt, all the long ago tokens of love and kindness.\n\n\"Well, I've told you now, and I feel better. You're a good woman,\nJennie, and you're kind to come to me this way.\" I loved you. I love\nyou now. I want to tell you that. It seems strange, but you're the\nonly woman I ever did love truly. We should never have parted.\n\nJennie caught her breath. It was the one thing she had waited for\nall these years--this testimony. It was the one thing that could\nmake everything right--this confession of spiritual if not\nmaterial union. Now she could live happily. Now die so. \"Oh, Lester,\"\nshe exclaimed with a sob, and pressed his hand. He returned the\npressure. There was a little silence. Then he spoke again.\n\n\"How are the two orphans?\" he asked.\n\n\"Oh, they're lovely,\" she answered, entering upon a detailed\ndescription of their diminutive personalities. He listened\ncomfortably, for her voice was soothing to him. Her whole personality\nwas grateful to him. When it came time for her to go he seemed\ndesirous of keeping her.\n\n\"Going, Jennie?\"\n\n\"I can stay just as well as not, Lester,\" she volunteered. \"I'll\ntake a room. I can send a note out to Mrs. Swenson. It will be all\nright.\"\n\n\"You needn't do that,\" he said, but she could see that he wanted\nher, that he did not want to be alone.\n\nFrom that time on until the hour of his death she was not out of\nthe hotel.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXII\n\n\nThe end came after four days during which Jennie was by his bedside\nalmost constantly. The nurse in charge welcomed her at first as a\nrelief and company, but the physician was inclined to object. Lester,\nhowever, was stubborn. \"This is my death,\" he said, with a touch of\ngrim humor. \"If I'm dying I ought to be allowed to die in my own\nway.\"\n\nWatson smiled at the man's unfaltering courage. He had never seen\nanything like it before.\n\nThere were cards of sympathy, calls of inquiry, notices in the\nnewspaper. Robert saw an item in the Inquirer and decided to go\nto Chicago. Imogene called with her husband, and they were admitted to\nLester's room for a few minutes after Jennie had gone to hers. Lester\nhad little to say. The nurse cautioned them that he was not to be\ntalked to much. When they were gone Lester said to Jennie, \"Imogene\nhas changed a good deal.\" He made no other comment.\n\nMrs. Kane was on the Atlantic three days out from New York the\nafternoon Lester died. He had been meditating whether anything more\ncould be done for Jennie, but he could not make up his mind about it.\nCertainly it was useless to leave her more money. She did not want it.\nHe had been wondering where Letty was and how near her actual arrival\nmight be when he was seized with a tremendous paroxysm of pain. Before\nrelief could be administered in the shape of an anesthetic he was\ndead. It developed afterward that it was not the intestinal trouble\nwhich killed him, but a lesion of a major blood-vessel in the\nbrain.\n\nJennie, who had been strongly wrought up by watching and worrying,\nwas beside herself with grief. He had been a part of her thought and\nfeeling so long that it seemed now as though a part of herself had\ndied. She had loved him as she had fancied she could never love any\none, and he had always shown that he cared for her--at least in\nsome degree. She could not feel the emotion that expresses itself in\ntears--only a dull ache, a numbness which seemed to make her\ninsensible to pain. He looked so strong--her Lester--lying\nthere still in death. His expression was unchanged--defiant,\ndetermined, albeit peaceful. Word had come from Mrs. Kane that she\nwould arrive on the Wednesday following. It was decided to hold the\nbody. Jennie learned from Mr. Watson that it was to be transferred to\nCincinnati, where the Paces had a vault. Because of the arrival of\nvarious members of the family, Jennie withdrew to her own home; she\ncould do nothing more.\n\nThe final ceremonies presented a peculiar commentary on the\nanomalies of existence. It was arranged with Mrs. Kane by wire that\nthe body should be transferred to Imogene's residence, and the funeral\nheld from there. Robert, who arrived the night Lester died; Berry\nDodge, Imogene's husband; Mr. Midgely, and three other citizens of\nprominence were selected as pall-bearers. Louise and her husband came\nfrom Buffalo; Amy and her husband from Cincinnati. The house was full\nto overflowing with citizens who either sincerely wished or felt it\nexpedient to call. Because of the fact that Lester and his family were\ntentatively Catholic, a Catholic priest was called in and the ritual\nof that Church was carried out. It was curious to see him lying in the\nparlor of this alien residence, candles at his head and feet, burning\nsepulchrally, a silver cross upon his breast, caressed by his waxen\nfingers. He would have smiled if he could have seen himself, but the\nKane family was too conventional, too set in its convictions, to find\nanything strange in this.\n\nThe Church made no objection, of course. The family was\ndistinguished. What more could be desired?\n\nOn Wednesday Mrs. Kane arrived. She was greatly distraught, for her\nlove, like Jennie's, was sincere. She left her room that night when\nall was silent and leaned over the coffin, studying by the light of\nthe burning candles Lester's beloved features. Tears trickled down her\ncheeks, for she had been happy with him. She caressed his cold cheeks\nand hands. \"Poor, dear Lester!\" she whispered. \"Poor, brave soul!\" No\none told her that he had sent for Jennie. The Kane family did not\nknow.\n\nMeanwhile in the house on South Park Avenue sat a woman who was\nenduring alone the pain, the anguish of an irreparable loss. Through\nall these years the subtle hope had persisted, in spite of every\ncircumstance, that somehow life might bring him back to her. He had\ncome, it is true--he really had in death--but he had gone\nagain. Where? Whither her mother, whither Gerhardt, whither Vesta had\ngone? She could not hope to see him again, for the papers had informed\nher of his removal to Mrs. Midgely's residence, and of the fact that\nhe was to be taken from Chicago to Cincinnati for burial. The last\nceremonies in Chicago were to be held in one of the wealthy Roman\nCatholic churches of the South Side, St. Michael's, of which the\nMidgelys were members.\n\nJennie felt deeply about this. She would have liked so much to have\nhad him buried in Chicago, where she could go to the grave\noccasionally, but this was not to be. She was never a master of her\nfate. Others invariably controlled. She thought of him as being taken\nfrom her finally by the removal of the body to Cincinnati, as though\ndistance made any difference. She decided at last to veil herself\nheavily and attend the funeral at the church. The paper had explained\nthat the services would be at two in the afternoon. Then at four the\nbody would be taken to the depot, and transferred to the train; the\nmembers of the family would accompany it to Cincinnati. She thought of\nthis as another opportunity. She might go to the depot.\n\nA little before the time for the funeral cortege to arrive at the\nchurch there appeared at one of its subsidiary entrances a woman in\nblack, heavily veiled, who took a seat in an inconspicuous corner. She\nwas a little nervous at first, for, seeing that the church was dark\nand empty, she feared lest she had mistaken the time and place; but\nafter ten minutes of painful suspense a bell in the church tower began\nto toll solemnly. Shortly thereafter an acolyte in black gown and\nwhite surplice appeared and lighted groups of candles on either side\nof the altar. A hushed stirring of feet in the choir-loft indicated\nthat the service was to be accompanied by music. Some loiterers,\nattracted by the bell, some idle strangers, a few acquaintances and\ncitizens not directly invited appeared and took seats.\n\nJennie watched all this with wondering eyes. Never in her life had\nshe been inside a Catholic church. The gloom, the beauty of the\nwindows, the whiteness of the altar, the golden flames of the candles\nimpressed her. She was suffused with a sense of sorrow, loss, beauty,\nand mystery. Life in all its vagueness and uncertainty seemed typified\nby this scene.\n\nAs the bell tolled there came from the sacristy a procession of\naltar-boys. The smallest, an angelic youth of eleven, came first,\nbearing aloft a magnificent silver cross. In the hands of each\nsubsequent pair of servitors was held a tall, lighted candle. The\npriest, in black cloth and lace, attended by an acolyte on either\nhand, followed. The procession passed out the entrance into the\nvestibule of the church, and was not seen again until the choir began\na mournful, responsive chant, the Latin supplication for mercy and\npeace.\n\nThen, at this sound the solemn procession made its reappearance.\nThere came the silver cross, the candles, the dark-faced priest,\nreading dramatically to himself as he walked, and the body of Lester\nin a great black coffin, with silver handles, carried by the\npall-bearers, who kept an even pace. Jennie stiffened perceptibly, her\nnerves responding as though to a shock from an electric current. She\ndid not know any of these men. She did not know Robert. She had never\nseen Mr. Midgely. Of the long company of notables who followed two by\ntwo she recognized only three, whom Lester had pointed out to her in\ntimes past. Mrs. Kane she saw, of course, for she was directly behind\nthe coffin, leaning on the arm of a stranger; behind her walked Mr.\nWatson, solemn, gracious. He gave a quick glance to either side,\nevidently expecting to see her somewhere; but not finding her, he\nturned his eyes gravely forward and walked on. Jennie looked with all\nher eyes, her heart gripped by pain. She seemed so much a part of this\nsolemn ritual, and yet infinitely removed from it all.\n\nThe procession reached the altar rail, and the coffin was put down.\nA white shroud bearing the insignia of suffering, a black cross, was\nput over it, and the great candles were set beside it. There were the\nchanted invocations and responses, the sprinkling of the coffin with\nholy water, the lighting and swinging of the censer and then the\nmumbled responses of the auditors to the Lord's Prayer and to its\nCatholic addition, the invocation to the Blessed Virgin. Jennie was\noverawed and amazed, but no show of form colorful, impression\nimperial, could take away the sting of death, the sense of infinite\nloss. To Jennie the candles, the incense, the holy song were\nbeautiful. They touched the deep chord of melancholy in her, and made\nit vibrate through the depths of her being. She was as a house filled\nwith mournful melody and the presence of death. She cried and cried.\nShe could see, curiously, that Mrs. Kane was sobbing convulsively\nalso.\n\nWhen it was all over the carriages were entered and the body was\nborne to the station. All the guests and strangers departed, and\nfinally, when all was silent, she arose. Now she would go to the depot\nalso, for she was hopeful of seeing his body put on the train. They\nwould have to bring it out on the platform, just as they did in\nVesta's case. She took a car, and a little later she entered the\nwaiting-room of the depot. She lingered about, first in the concourse,\nwhere the great iron fence separated the passengers from the tracks,\nand then in the waiting-room, hoping to discover the order of\nproceedings. She finally observed the group of immediate relatives\nwaiting--Mrs. Kane, Robert, Mrs. Midgely, Louise, Amy, Imogene,\nand the others. She actually succeeded in identifying most of them,\nthough it was not knowledge in this case, but pure instinct and\nintuition.\n\nNo one had noticed it in the stress of excitement, but it was\nThanksgiving Eve. Throughout the great railroad station there was a\nhum of anticipation, that curious ebullition of fancy which springs\nfrom the thought of pleasures to come. People were going away for the\nholiday. Carriages were at the station entries. Announcers were\ncalling in stentorian voices the destination of each new train as the\ntime of its departure drew near. Jennie heard with a desperate ache\nthe description of a route which she and Lester had taken more than\nonce, slowly and melodiously emphasized. \"Detroit, Toledo, Cleveland,\nBuffalo, and New York.\" There were cries of trains for \"Fort Wayne,\nColumbus, Pittsburg, Philadelphia, and points East,\" and then finally\nfor \"Indianapolis, Louisville, Columbus, Cincinnati, and points\nSouth.\" The hour had struck.\n\nSeveral times Jennie had gone to the concourse between the\nwaiting-room and the tracks to see if through the iron grating which\nseparated her from her beloved she could get one last look at the\ncoffin, or the great wooden box which held it, before it was put on\nthe train. Now she saw it coming. There was a baggage porter pushing a\ntruck into position near the place where the baggage car would stop.\nOn it was Lester, that last shadow of his substance, incased in the\nhonors of wood, and cloth, and silver. There was no thought on the\npart of the porter of the agony of loss which was represented here. He\ncould not see how wealth and position in this hour were typified to\nher mind as a great fence, a wall, which divided her eternally from\nher beloved. Had it not always been so? Was not her life a patchwork\nof conditions made and affected by these things which she\nsaw--wealth and force--which had found her unfit? She had\nevidently been born to yield, not seek. This panoply of power had been\nparaded before her since childhood. What could she do now but stare\nvaguely after it as it marched triumphantly by? Lester had been of it.\nHim it respected. Of her it knew nothing. She looked through the\ngrating, and once more there came the cry of \"Indianapolis,\nLouisville, Columbus, Cincinnati, and points South.\" A long red train,\nbrilliantly lighted, composed of baggage cars, day coaches, a\ndining-car, set with white linen and silver, and a half dozen\ncomfortable Pullmans, rolled in and stopped. A great black engine,\npuffing and glowing, had it all safely in tow.\n\nAs the baggage car drew near the waiting truck a train-hand in\nblue, looking out of the car, called to some one within.\n\n\"Hey, Jack! Give us a hand here. There's a stiff outside!\"\n\nJennie could not hear.\n\nAll she could see was the great box that was so soon to disappear.\nAll she could feel was that this train would start presently, and then\nit would all be over. The gates opened, the passengers poured out.\nThere were Robert, and Amy, and Louise, and Midgely--all making\nfor the Pullman cars in the rear. They had said their farewells to\ntheir friends. No need to repeat them. A trio of assistants \"gave a\nhand\" at getting the great wooden case into the car. Jennie saw it\ndisappear with an acute physical wrench at her heart.\n\nThere were many trunks to be put aboard, and then the door of the\nbaggage car half closed, but not before the warning bell of the engine\nsounded. There was the insistent calling of \"all aboard\" from this\nquarter and that; then slowly the great locomotive began to move. Its\nbell was ringing, its steam hissing, its smoke-stack throwing aloft a\ngreat black plume of smoke that fell back over the cars like a pall.\nThe fireman, conscious of the heavy load behind, flung open a flaming\nfurnace door to throw in coal. Its light glowed like a golden eye.\n\nJennie stood rigid, staring into the wonder of this picture, her\nface white, her eyes wide, her hands unconsciously clasped, but one\nthought in her mind--they were taking his body away. A leaden\nNovember sky was ahead, almost dark. She looked, and looked until the\nlast glimmer of the red lamp on the receding sleeper disappeared in\nthe maze of smoke and haze overhanging the tracks of the\nfar-stretching yard.\n\n\"Yes,\" said the voice of a passing stranger, gay with the\nanticipation of coming pleasures. \"We're going to have a great time\ndown there. Remember Annie? Uncle Jim is coming and Aunt Ella.\"\n\nJennie did not hear that or anything else of the chatter and bustle\naround her. Before her was stretching a vista of lonely years down\nwhich she was steadily gazing. Now what? She was not so old yet. There\nwere those two orphan children to raise. They would marry and leave\nafter a while, and then what? Days and days in endless reiteration,\nand then--?\n\n\n\nTHE END\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Jennie Gerhardt, by Theodore Dreiser\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK JENNIE GERHARDT ***\n\n***** This file should be named 28988.txt or 28988.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/2\/8\/9\/8\/28988\/\n\nProduced by James Adcock.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http:\/\/www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http:\/\/pglaf.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":188,"split":"train"}
