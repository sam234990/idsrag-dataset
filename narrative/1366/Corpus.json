{"ori_id":"c216e79f13e6c141b9d83b732e1ca5936d96ee9f","title":"Rose in Bloom","context":"Rose in Bloom\n The story begins when Rose returns home from a long trip to Europe. Everyone has changed. As a joke, Rose lines up her seven cousins to take a long look at them, just as they did with her when they first met. The youngest, Jamie, accidentally mentions that the aunts want Rose to marry one of her cousins to keep her fortune in the family. Rose is very indignant, for she has decided ideas about what her future holds. From the beginning, she declares that she can manage her property well on her own and that she will focus on philanthropic work. Charlie has already decided she is marked out for him, with the approval of his mother.\nPhebe also comes home no longer the servant that Rose \"adopted\" but as a young lady with a cultured singing ability. Rose challenges anyone who would look down on \"her Phebe\", and she is readily accepted as part of the Campbell clan until Archie falls in love with her: the family feel that Archie would be marrying beneath himself. Phebe's pride and debt to the family make her wish to prove herself before she will accept Archie; so she leaves the Campbells' home and sets off to make a name for herself as a singer, to try to earn the respect of her adopted family.\nAfter some time at home, Rose has her \"coming out\" into society, much to her Uncle Alec's chagrin. She promises to try high society for only three months. During that time, her cousin Charlie falls in love with her and tries in various ways to woo her. Rose begins to give in to his charm, but he derails the budding romance by coming to her house, late one night, very drunk. This ruins all her respect for him and she sees how unprincipled he really is. After the three months are up, Rose begins to focus on her philanthropic projects and convinces Charlie to try to refrain from alcohol and other frivolous things, in order to win her love and respect.\nShe tries to help Charlie overcome his bad habits with the help of her uncle, but fails. Charlie does all he can to win her heart, but in the end he succumbs, hindered by his own weak will and his constant need for acceptance by his friends. Being spoilt by his mother meant he never learned to say \"no\", even to himself, and his lack of discipline proves fatal: Charlie's life ends tragically in an alcohol-induced accident on the eve of his voyage to see his father and restore his good character. Although Rose never was in love with Charlie, she did have hope that he would return a better man and that they might see what relationship could develop.\nSeveral months after Charlie's death, Rose finds out that another cousin, Mac, is now in love with her. At first, never thought of him as anything but \"the worm\", she refuses his love; but she does declare the deepest respect for him. This gives Mac hope, and he goes to medical school, willing to work and wait for her. She finds his devotion touching, and she begins to see him clearly for the first time, realizing that Mac is the \"hero\" she has been looking for. He is exactly suited to her tastes and has become a man in the noblest sense of the word. He also settles a joke with her by publishing a small book of poetry to wide critical success, earning her respect even more deeply. It is his absence that shows her how much she cares for him.\nWhile Rose is discovering her heart, Steve and a minor character, Kitty, engage to marry. This creates a new sensation in the family, and Kitty begins to look to Rose for sisterly guidance. Rose encourages her to improve her silly mind, and Kitty is a very willing pupil. Rose continues to wait for Mac's return but reaches a crisis when Uncle Alec becomes very sick while visiting Mac; Phebe nurses him back from the brink of death, at personal peril, and returns him to the anxious Campbells to be greeted as a triumphant member of the family, sealing her own engagement with Archie with everyone's blessing. This homecoming is completed for Rose when she is reunited with Mac and finally declares her own sentiments. The book closes with three very happy couples, and much hope for their felicity.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg EBook of Rose in Bloom, by Louisa May Alcott\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

The elder is Archie, a most exemplary young man. He has\njust gone into business with the merchant uncle and bids fair to be an\nhonor to his family. The other, with the eyeglasses and no gloves, is\nMac, the odd one, just out of college.\"\n\n\"And the boy?\"\n\n\"Oh, he is Jamie, the youngest brother of Archibald, and the pet of the\nwhole family. Mercy on us he'll be in if they don't hold on to him!\"\n\nThe ladies' chat came to a sudden end just there, for by the time\nJamie had been fished out of a hogshead, the steamer hove in sight and\neverything else was forgotten. As it swung slowly around to enter the\ndock, a boyish voice shouted, \"There she is! I see her and Uncle and\nPhebe! Hooray for Cousin Rose!\" And three small cheers were given with\na will by Jamie as he stood on a post waving his arms like a windmill\nwhile his brother held onto the tail of his jacket.\n\nYes, there they were Uncle Alec swinging his hat like a boy, with Phebe\nsmiling and nodding on one side and Rose kissing both hands delightedly\non the other as she recognized familiar faces and heard familiar voices\nwelcoming her home.\n\n\"Bless her dear heart, she's bonnier than ever! Looks like a Madonna\ndoesn't she? with that blue cloak round her, and her bright hair flying\nin the wind!\" said Charlie excitedly as they watched the group upon the\ndeck with eager eyes.\n\n\"Madonnas don't wear hats like that. Rose hasn't changed much, but Phebe\nhas. Why, she's a regular beauty!\" answered Archie, staring with all his\nmight at the dark-eyed young woman with the brilliant color and glossy\nblack braids shining in the sun.\n\n\"Dear old Uncle! Doesn't it seem good to have him back?\" was all Mac\nsaid, but he was not looking at \"dear old uncle\" as he made the fervent\nremark, for he saw only the slender blond girl nearby and stretched out\nhis hands to meet hers, forgetful of the green water tumbling between\nthem.\n\nDuring the confusion that reigned for a moment as the steamer settled to\nher moorings, Rose looked down into the four faces upturned to hers and\nseemed to read in them something that both pleased and pained her. It\nwas only a glance, and her own eyes were full, but through the mist of\nhappy tears she received the impression that Archie was about the same,\nthat Mac had decidedly improved, and that something was amiss with\nCharlie. There was no time for observation, however, for in a moment\nthe shoreward rush began, and before she could grasp her traveling bag,\nJamie was clinging to her like an ecstatic young bear. She was with\ndifficulty released from his embrace to fall into the gentler ones\nof the elder cousins, who took advantage of the general excitement to\nwelcome both blooming girls with affectionate impartiality. Then the\nwanderers were borne ashore in a triumphal procession, while Jamie\ndanced rapturous jigs before them even on the gangway.\n\nArchie remained to help his uncle get the luggage through the Custom\nHouse, and the others escorted the damsels home. No sooner were they\nshut up in a carriage, however, than a new and curious constraint seemed\nto fall upon the young people, for they realized, all at once, that\ntheir former playmates were men and women now. Fortunately, Jamie\nwas quite free from this feeling of restraint and, sitting bodkinwise\nbetween the ladies, took all sorts of liberties with them and their\nbelongings.\n\n\"Well, my mannikin, what do you think of us?\" asked Rose, to break an\nawkward pause.\n\n\"You've both grown so pretty, I can't decide which I like best. Phebe is\nthe biggest and brightest-looking, and I was always fond of Phebe, but\nsomehow you are so kind of sweet and precious, I really think I must hug\nyou again,\" and the small youth did it tempestuously.\n\n\"If you love me best, I shall not mind a bit about your thinking Phebe\nthe handsomest, because she is. Isn't she, boys?\" asked Rose, with a\nmischievous look at the gentlemen opposite, whose faces expressed a\nrespectful admiration which much amused her.\n\n\"I'm so dazzled by the brilliancy and beauty that has suddenly burst\nupon me, I have no words to express my emotions,\" answered Charlie,\ngallantly dodging the dangerous question.\n\n\"I can't say yet, for I have not had time to look at anyone. I will now,\nif you don't mind.\" And, to the great amusement of the rest, Mac gravely\nadjusted his eyeglasses and took an observation.\n\n\"Well?\" said Phebe, smiling and blushing under his honest stare, yet\nseeming not to resent it as she did the lordly sort of approval which\nmade her answer the glance of Charlie's audacious blue eyes with a flash\nof her black ones.\n\n\"I think if you were my sister, I should be very proud of you, because\nyour face shows what I admire more than its beauty truth and courage,\nPhebe,\" answered Mac with a little bow full of such genuine respect that\nsurprise and pleasure brought a sudden dew to quench the fire of the\ngirl's eyes and soothe the sensitive pride of the girl's heart.\n\nRose clapped her hands just as she used to do when anything delighted\nher, and beamed at Mac approvingly as she said: \"Now that's a criticism\nworth having, and we are much obliged. I was sure you'd admire my Phebe\nwhen you knew her, but I didn't believe you would be wise enough to see\nit at once, and you have gone up many pegs in my estimation, I assure\nyou.\"\n\n\"I was always fond of mineralogy you remember, and I've been tapping\nround a good deal lately, so I've learned to know precious metals when I\nsee them,\" Mac said with his shrewd smile.\n\n\"That is the latest hobby, then? Your letters have amused us immensely,\nfor each one had a new theory or experiment, and the latest was\nalways the best. I thought Uncle would have died of laughter over the\nvegetarian mania it was so funny to imagine you living on bread and\nmilk, baked apples, and potatoes roasted in your own fire,\" continued\nRose, changing the subject again.\n\n\"This old chap was the laughingstock of his class. They called him Don\nQuixote, and the way he went at windmills of all sorts was a sight to\nsee,\" put in Charlie, evidently feeling that Mac had been patted on the\nhead quite as much as was good for him.\n\n\"But in spite of that the Don got through college with all the honors.\nOh, wasn't I proud when Aunt Jane wrote to us about it and didn't she\nrejoice that her boy kept at the head of his class and won the medal!\"\ncried Rose, shaking Mac by both hands in a way that caused Charlie to\nwish \"the old chap\" had been left behind with Dr. Alec.\n\n\"Oh, come, that's all Mother's nonsense. I began earlier than the other\nfellows and liked it better, so I don't deserve any praise. Prince is\nright, though. I did make a regular jack of myself, but on the whole\nI'm not sure that my wild oats weren't better than some I've seen sowed.\nAnyway, they didn't cost much, and I'm none the worse for them,\" said\nMac placidly.\n\n\"I know what 'wild oats' means. I heard Uncle Mac say Charlie was sowing\n'em too fast, and I asked Mama, so she told me. And I know that he was\nsuspelled or expended, I don't remember which, but it was something bad,\nand Aunt Clara cried,\" added Jamie all in one breath, for he possessed a\nfatal gift of making malapropos remarks, which caused him to be a terror\nto his family.\n\n\"Do you want to go on the box again?\" demanded Prince with a warning\nfrown.\n\n\"No, I don't.\"\n\n\"Then hold your tongue.\"\n\n\"Well, Mac needn't kick me, for I was only...\" began the culprit,\ninnocently trying to make a bad matter worse.\n\n\"That will do,\" interrupted Charlie sternly, and James subsided, a\ncrushed boy, consoling himself with Rose's new watch for the indignities\nhe suffered at the hands of the \"old fellows\" as he vengefully called\nhis elders.\n\nMac and Charlie immediately began to talk as hard as their tongues could\nwag, bringing up all sorts of pleasant subjects so successfully\nthat peals of laughter made passersby look after the merry load with\nsympathetic smiles.\n\nAn avalanche of aunts fell upon Rose as soon as she reached home, and\nfor the rest of the day the old house buzzed like a beehive. Evening\nfound the whole tribe collected in the drawing rooms, with the exception\nof Aunt Peace, whose place was empty now.\n\nNaturally enough, the elders settled into one group after a while, and\nthe young fellows clustered about the girls like butterflies around two\nattractive flowers. Dr. Alec was the central figure in one room and Rose\nin the other, for the little girl, whom they had all loved and petted,\nhad bloomed into a woman, and two years of absence had wrought a curious\nchange in the relative positions of the cousins, especially the three\nelder ones, who eyed her with a mixture of boyish affection and manly\nadmiration that was both new and pleasant.\n\nSomething sweet yet spirited about her charmed them and piqued their\ncuriosity, for she was not quite like other girls, and rather startled\nthem now and then by some independent little speech or act which made\nthem look at one another with a sly smile, as if reminded that Rose was\n\"Uncle's girl.\"\n\nLet us listen, as in duty bound, to what the elders are saying first,\nfor they are already building castles in air for the boys and girls to\ninhabit.\n\n\"Dear child how nice it is to see her safely back, so well and happy and\nlike her sweet little self!\" said Aunt Plenty, folding her hands as if\ngiving thanks for a great happiness.\n\n\"I shouldn't wonder if you found that you'd brought a firebrand into the\nfamily, Alec. Two, in fact, for Phebe is a fine girl, and the lads have\nfound it out already if I'm not mistaken,\" added Uncle Mac, with a nod\ntoward the other room.\n\nAll eyes followed his, and a highly suggestive tableau presented itself\nto the paternal and maternal audience in the back parlor.\n\nRose and Phebe, sitting side by side on the sofa, had evidently assumed\nat once the places which they were destined to fill by right of youth,\nsex, and beauty, for Phebe had long since ceased to be the maid and\nbecome the friend, and Rose meant to have that fact established at once.\n\nJamie occupied the rug, on which Will and Geordie stood at ease, showing\ntheir uniforms to the best advantage, for they were now in a great\nschool, where military drill was the delight of their souls. Steve posed\ngracefully in an armchair, with Mac lounging over the back of it, while\nArchie leaned on one corner of the low chimneypiece, looking down at\nPhebe as she listened to his chat with smiling lips and cheeks almost as\nrich in color as the carnations in her belt.\n\nBut Charlie was particularly effective, although he sat upon a music\nstool, that most trying position for any man not gifted with grace in\nthe management of his legs. Fortunately Prince was, and had fallen into\nan easy attitude, with one arm over the back of the sofa, his handsome\nhead bent a little, as he monopolized Rose, with a devoted air and a\nvery becoming expression of contentment on his face.\n\nAunt Clara smiled as if well pleased; Aunt Jessie looked thoughtful;\nAunt Jane's keen eyes went from dapper Steve to broad-shouldered Mac\nwith an anxious glance; Mrs. Myra murmured something about her \"blessed\nCaroline\"; and Aunt Plenty said warmly, \"Bless the dears! Anyone might\nbe proud of such a bonny flock of bairns as that.\"\n\n\"I am all ready to play chaperon as soon as you please, Alec, for I\nsuppose the dear girl will come out at once, as she did not before you\nwent away. My services won't be wanted long, I fancy, for with her\nmany advantages she will be carried off in her first season or I'm much\nmistaken,\" said Mrs. Clara, with significant nods and smiles.\n\n\"You must settle all those matters with Rose. I am no longer captain,\nonly first mate now, you know,\" answered Dr. Alec, adding soberly, half\nto himself, half to his brother, \"I wonder people are in such haste to\n'bring out' their daughters, as it's called. To me there is something\nalmost pathetic in the sight of a young girl standing on the threshold\nof the world, so innocent and hopeful, so ignorant of all that lies\nbefore her, and usually so ill prepared to meet the ups and downs of\nlife. We do our duty better by the boys, but the poor little women are\nseldom provided with any armor worth having, and sooner or later they\nare sure to need it, for every one must fight her own battle, and only\nthe brave and strong can win.\"\n\n\"You can't reproach yourself with neglect of that sort, Alec, for you\nhave done your duty faithfully by George's girl, and I envy you the\npride and happiness of having such a daughter, for she is that to you,\"\nanswered old Mac, unexpectedly betraying the paternal sort of tenderness\nmen seldom feel for their sons.\n\n\"I've tried, Mac, and I am both proud and happy, but with every year my\nanxiety seems to increase. I've done my best to fit Rose for what may\ncome, as far as I can foresee it, but now she must stand alone, and all\nmy care is powerless to keep her heart from aching, her life from being\nsaddened by mistakes, or thwarted by the acts of others. I can only\nstand ready to share her joy and sorrow and watch her shape her life.\"\n\n\"Why, Alec, what is the child going to do that you need look so solemn?\"\nexclaimed Mrs. Clara, who seemed to have assumed a sort of right to Rose\nalready.\n\n\"Hark! And let her tell you herself,\" answered Dr. Alec, as Rose's voice\nwas heard saying very earnestly, \"Now, you have all told your plans for\nthe future, why don't you ask us ours?\"\n\n\"Because we know that there is only one thing for a pretty girl to do\nbreak a dozen or so hearts before she finds one to suit, then marry and\nsettle,\" answered Charlie, as if no other reply was possible.\n\n\"That may be the case with many, but not with us, for Phebe and I\nbelieve that it is as much a right and a duty for women to do something\nwith their lives as for men, and we are not going to be satisfied with\nsuch frivolous parts as you give us,\" cried Rose with kindling eyes. \"I\nmean what I say, and you cannot laugh me down. Would you be contented to\nbe told to enjoy yourself for a little while, then marry and do nothing\nmore till you die?\" she added, turning to Archie.\n\n\"Of course not that is only a part of a man's life,\" he answered\ndecidedly.\n\n\"A very precious and lovely part, but not all,\" continued Rose. \"Neither\nshould it be for a woman, for we've got minds and souls as well as\nhearts; ambition and talents as well as beauty and accomplishments;\nand we want to live and learn as well as love and be loved. I'm sick of\nbeing told that is all a woman is fit for! I won't have anything to do\nwith love till I prove that I am something besides a housekeeper and\nbaby-tender!\"\n\n\"Heaven preserve us! Here's woman's rights with a vengeance!\" cried\nCharlie, starting up with mock horror, while the others regarded Rose\nwith mingled surprise and amusement, evidently fancying it all a girlish\noutbreak.\n\n\"Ah, you needn't pretend to be shocked you will be in earnest presently,\nfor this is only the beginning of my strong-mindedness,\" continued Rose,\nnothing daunted by the smiles of good-natured incredulity or derision on\nthe faces of her cousins. \"I have made up my mind not to be cheated out\nof the real things that make one good and happy and, just because I'm a\nrich girl, fold my hands and drift as so many do. I haven't lived with\nPhebe all these years in vain. I know what courage and self-reliance can\ndo for one, and I sometimes wish I hadn't a penny in the world so that I\ncould go and earn my bread with her, and be as brave and independent as\nshe will be pretty soon.\"\n\nIt was evident that Rose was in earnest now, for as she spoke she turned\nto her friend with such respect as well as love in her face that the\nlook told better than any words how heartily the rich girl appreciated\nthe virtues hard experience had given the poor girl, and how eagerly she\ndesired to earn what all her fortune could not buy for her.\n\nSomething in the glance exchanged between the friends impressed the\nyoung men in spite of their prejudices, and it was in a perfectly\nserious tone that Archie said, \"I fancy you'll find your hands full,\nCousin, if you want work, for I've heard people say that wealth has its\ntroubles and trials as well as poverty.\"\n\n\"I know it, and I'm going to try and fill my place well. I've got some\ncapital little plans all made, and have begun to study my profession\nalready,\" answered Rose with an energetic nod.\n\n\"Could I ask what it is to be?\" inquired Charlie in a tone of awe.\n\n\"Guess!\" and Rose looked up at him with an expression half-earnest,\nhalf-merry.\n\n\"Well, I should say that you were fitted for a beauty and a belle, but\nas that is evidently not to your taste, I am afraid you are going to\nstudy medicine and be a doctor. Won't your patients have a heavenly time\nthough? It will be easy dying with an angel to poison them.\"\n\n\"Now, Charlie, that's base of you, when you know how well women have\nsucceeded in this profession and what a comfort Dr. Mary Kirk was to\ndear Aunt Peace. I did want to study medicine, but Uncle thought it\nwouldn't do to have so many M.D.'s in one family, since Mac thinks of\ntrying it. Besides, I seem to have other work put into my hands that I\nam better fitted for.\"\n\n\"You are fitted for anything that is generous and good, and I'll stand\nby you, no matter what you've chosen,\" cried Mac heartily, for this was\na new style of talk from a girl's lips, and he liked it immensely.\n\n\"Philanthropy is a generous, good, and beautiful profession, and I've\nchosen it for mine because I have much to give. I'm only the steward\nof the fortune Papa left me, and I think, if I use it wisely for the\nhappiness of others, it will be more blest than if I keep it all for\nmyself.\"\n\nVery sweetly and simply was this said, but it was curious to see how\ndifferently the various hearers received it.\n\nCharlie shot a quick look at his mother, who exclaimed, as if in spite\nof herself, \"Now, Alec, are you going to let that girl squander a fine\nfortune on all sorts of charitable nonsense and wild schemes for the\nprevention of pauperism and crime?\"\n\n\"'They who give to the poor lend to the Lord,' and practical\nChristianity is the kind He loves the best,\" was all Dr. Alec answered,\nbut it silenced the aunts and caused even prudent Uncle Mac to think\nwith sudden satisfaction of certain secret investments he had made which\npaid him no interest but the thanks of the poor.\n\nArchie and Mac looked well pleased and promised their advice and\nassistance with the enthusiasm of generous young hearts. Steve shook\nhis head, but said nothing, and the lads on the rug at once proposed\nfounding a hospital for invalid dogs and horses, white mice, and wounded\nheroes.\n\n\"Don't you think that will be a better way for a woman to spend her life\nthan in dancing, dressing, and husband-hunting, Charlie?\" asked Rose,\nobserving his silence and anxious for his approval.\n\n\"Very pretty for a little while, and very effective too, for I don't\nknow anything more captivating than a sweet girl in a meek little bonnet\ngoing on charitable errands and glorifying poor people's houses with\na delightful mixture of beauty and benevolence. Fortunately, the dear\nsouls soon tire of it, but it's heavenly while it lasts.\"\n\nCharlie spoke in a tone of mingled admiration and contempt, and smiled\na superior sort of smile, as if he understood all the innocent delusions\nas well as the artful devices of the sex and expected nothing more from\nthem. It both surprised and grieved Rose, for it did not sound like\nthe Charlie she had left two years ago. But she only said, with a\nreproachful look and a proud little gesture of head and hand, as if she\nput the subject aside since it was not treated with respect: \"I am sorry\nyou have so low an opinion of women. There was a time when you believed\nin them sincerely.\"\n\n\"I do still, upon my word I do! They haven't a more devoted admirer\nand slave in the world than I am. Just try me and see,\" cried Charlie,\ngallantly kissing his hand to the sex in general.\n\nBut Rose was not appeased, and gave a disdainful shrug as she answered\nwith a look in her eyes that his lordship did not like, \"Thank you. I\ndon't want admirers or slaves, but friends and helpers. I've lived so\nlong with a wise, good man that I am rather hard to suit, perhaps, but\nI don't intend to lower my standard, and anyone who cares for my regard\nmust at least try to live up to it.\"\n\n\"Whew! Here's a wrathful dove! Come and smooth her ruffled plumage, Mac.\nI'll dodge before I do further mischief,\" and Charlie strolled away into\nthe other room, privately lamenting that Uncle Alec had spoiled a fine\ngirl by making her strong-minded.\n\nHe wished himself back again in five minutes, for Mac said something\nthat produced a gale of laughter, and when he took a look over his\nshoulder the \"wrathful dove\" was cooing so peacefully and pleasantly\nhe was sorely tempted to return and share the fun. But Charlie had been\nspoiled by too much indulgence, and it was hard for him to own himself\nin the wrong even when he knew it. He always got what he wanted sooner\nor later, and having long ago made up his mind that Rose and her fortune\nwere to be his, he was secretly displeased at the new plans and beliefs\nof the young lady, but flattered himself that they would soon be changed\nwhen she saw how unfashionable and inconvenient they were.\n\nMusing over the delightful future he had laid out, he made himself\ncomfortable in the sofa corner near his mother till the appearance of\na slight refection caused both groups to melt into one. Aunt Plenty\nbelieved in eating and drinking, so the slightest excuse for festivity\ndelighted her hospitable soul, and on this joyful occasion she surpassed\nherself.\n\nIt was during this informal banquet that Rose, roaming about from one\nadmiring relative to another, came upon the three younger lads, who were\nhaving a quiet little scuffle in a secluded corner.\n\n\"Come out here and let me have a look at you,\" she said enticingly, for\nshe predicted an explosion and public disgrace if peace was not speedily\nrestored.\n\nHastily smoothing themselves down, the young gentlemen presented three\nflushed and merry countenances for inspection, feeling highly honored by\nthe command.\n\n\"Dear me, how you two have grown! You big things how dare you get head\nof me in this way!\" she said, standing on tiptoe to pat the curly pates\nbefore her, for Will and Geordie had shot up like weeds, and now grinned\ncheerfully down upon her as she surveyed them in comic amazement.\n\n\"The Campbells are all fine, tall fellows, and we mean to be the best of\nthe lot. Shouldn't wonder if we were six-footers like Grandpa,\" observed\nWill proudly, looking so like a young Shanghai rooster, all legs and an\ninsignificant head, that Rose kept her countenance with difficulty.\n\n\"We shall broaden out when we get our growth. We are taller than Steve\nnow, a half a head, both of us,\" added Geordie, with his nose in the\nair.\n\nRose turned to look at Steve and, with a sudden smile, beckoned to him.\nHe dropped his napkin and flew to obey the summons, for she was queen of\nthe hour, and he had openly announced his deathless loyalty.\n\n\"Tell the other boys to come here. I've a fancy to stand you all in a\nrow and look you over, as you did me that dreadful day when you nearly\nfrightened me out of my wits,\" she said, laughing at the memory of it as\nshe spoke.\n\nThey came in a body and, standing shoulder to shoulder, made such an\nimposing array that the young commander was rather daunted for a moment.\nBut she had seen too much of the world lately to be abashed by a trifle,\nand the desire to see a girlish test gave her courage to face the line\nof smiling cousins with dignity and spirit.\n\n\"Now, I'm going to stare at you as you stared at me. It is my revenge on\nyou seven bad boys for entrapping one poor little girl and enjoying her\nalarm. I'm not a bit afraid of you now, so tremble and beware!\"\n\nAs she spoke, Rose looked up into Archie's face and nodded approvingly,\nfor the steady gray eyes met hers fairly and softened as they did so a\nbecoming change, for naturally they were rather keen than kind.\n\n\"A true Campbell, bless you!\" she said, and shook his hand heartily as\nshe passed on.\n\nCharlie came next, and here she felt less satisfied, though scarcely\nconscious why, for, as she looked, there came a defiant sort of flash,\nchanging suddenly to something warmer than anger, stronger than pride,\nmaking her shrink a little and say, hastily, \"I don't find the Charlie I\nleft, but the Prince is there still, I see.\"\n\nTurning to Mac with a sense of relief, she gently took off his\n\"winkers,\" as Jamie called them, and looked straight into the honest\nblue eyes that looked straight back at her, full of a frank and friendly\naffection that warmed her heart and made her own eyes brighten as\nshe gave back the glasses, saying, with a look and tone of cordial\nsatisfaction, \"You are not changed, my dear old Mac, and I'm so glad of\nthat!\"\n\n\"Now say something extra sweet to me, because I'm the flower of the\nfamily,\" said Steve, twirling the blond moustache, which was evidently\nthe pride of his life.\n\nRose saw at a glance that Dandy deserved his name more than ever, and\npromptly quenched his vanities by answering, with a provoking laugh,\n\"Then the name of the flower of the family is Cockscomb.\"\n\n\"Ah, ha! who's got it now?\" jeered Will.\n\n\"Let us off easy, please,\" whispered Geordie, mindful that their turn\ncame next.\n\n\"You blessed beanstalks! I'm proud of you only don't grow quite out of\nsight, or even be ashamed to look a woman in the face,\" answered Rose,\nwith a gentle pat on the cheek of either bashful young giant, for both\nwere red as peonies, though their boyish eyes were as clear and calm as\nsummer lakes.\n\n\"Now me!\" and Jamie assumed his manliest air, feeling that he did not\nappear to advantage among his tall kinsmen. But he went to the head\nof the class in everyone's opinion when Rose put her arms around him,\nsaying, with a kiss, \"You must be my boy now, for all the others are too\nold, and I want a faithful little page to do my errands for me.\"\n\n\"I will, I will I'll marry you too, if you'll just hold on till I grow\nup!\" cried Jamie, rather losing his head at this sudden promotion.\n\n\"Bless the baby, what is he talking about?\" laughed Rose, looking down\nat her little knight as he clung about her with grateful ardor.\n\n\"Oh, I heard the aunts say that you'd better marry one of us, and keep\nthe property in the family, so I speak first, because you are very fond\nof me, and I do love curls.\"\n\nAlas for Jamie! This awful speech had hardly left his innocent lips when\nWill and Geordie swept him out of the room like a whirlwind, and the\nhowls of that hapless boy were heard from the torture hall, where being\nshut into the skeleton case was one of the mildest punishments inflicted\nupon him.\n\nDismay fell upon the unfortunates who remained, but their confusion was\nsoon ended, for Rose, with a look which they had never seen upon her\nface before, dismissed them with the brief command, \"Break ranks the\nreview is over,\" and walked away to Phebe.\n\n\"Confound that boy! You ought to shut him up or gag him!\" fumed Charlie\nirritably.\n\n\"He shall be attended to,\" answered poor Archie, who was trying to bring\nup the little marplot with the success of most parents and guardians.\n\n\"The whole thing was deuced disagreeable,\" growled Steve, who felt that\nhe had not distinguished himself in the late engagement.\n\n\"Truth generally is,\" observed Mac dryly as he strolled away with his\nodd smile.\n\nAs if he suspected discord somewhere, Dr. Alec proposed music at this\ncrisis, and the young people felt that it was a happy thought.\n\n\"I want you to hear both my birds, for they have improved immensely,\nand I am very proud of them,\" said the doctor, twirling up the stool and\npulling out the old music books.\n\n\"I had better come first, for after you have heard the nightingale you\nwon't care for the canary,\" added Rose, wishing to put Phebe at her\nease, for she sat among them looking like a picture, but rather shy and\nsilent, remembering the days when her place was in the kitchen.\n\n\"I'll give you some of the dear old songs you used to like so much. This\nwas a favorite, I think,\" and sitting down she sang the first familiar\nair that came, and sang it well in a pleasant, but by no means finished,\nmanner.\n\nIt chanced to be \"The Birks of Aberfeldie,\" and vividly recalled the\ntime when Mac was ill and she took care of him. The memory was sweet to\nher, and involuntarily her eye wandered in search of him. He was not\nfar away, sitting just as he used to sit when she soothed his most\ndespondent moods astride of a chair with his head down on his arms, as\nif the song suggested the attitude. Her heart quite softened to him as\nshe looked, and she decided to forgive him if no one else, for she was\nsure that he had no mercenary plans about her tiresome money.\n\nCharlie had assumed a pensive air and fixed his fine eyes upon her with\nan expression of tender admiration, which made her laugh in spite of all\nher efforts to seem unconscious of it. She was both amused and annoyed\nat his very evident desire to remind her of certain sentimental passages\nin the last year of their girl- and boy-hood, and to change what she had\nconsidered a childish joke into romantic earnest. Rose had very serious\nideas of love and had no intention of being beguiled into even a\nflirtation with her handsome cousin.\n\nSo Charlie attitudinized unnoticed and was getting rather out of temper\nwhen Phebe began to sing, and he forgot all about himself in admiration\nof her. It took everyone by surprise, for two years of foreign training\nadded to several at home had worked wonders, and the beautiful voice\nthat used to warble cheerily over pots and kettles now rang out\nmelodiously or melted to a mellow music that woke a sympathetic thrill\nin those who listened. Rose glowed with pride as she accompanied her\nfriend, for Phebe was in her own world now a lovely world where no\ndepressing memory of poorhouse or kitchen, ignorance or loneliness, came\nto trouble her, a happy world where she could be herself and rule others\nby the magic of her sweet gift.\n\nYes, Phebe was herself now, and showed it in the change that came over\nher at the first note of music. No longer shy and silent, no longer the\nimage of a handsome girl but a blooming woman, alive and full of the\neloquence her art gave her, as she laid her hands softly together,\nfixed her eye on the light, and just poured out her song as simply and\njoyfully as the lark does soaring toward the sun.\n\n\"My faith, Alec that's the sort of voice that wins a man's heart out\nof his breast!\" exclaimed Uncle Mac, wiping his eyes after one of the\nplaintive ballads that never grow old.\n\n\"So it would!\" answered Dr. Alec delightedly.\n\n\"So it has,\" added Archie to himself; and he was right, for just at that\nmoment he fell in love with Phebe. He actually did, and could fix the\ntime almost to a second, for at a quarter past nine, he merely thought\nher a very charming young person; at twenty minutes past, he considered\nher the loveliest woman he ever beheld; at five and twenty minutes past,\nshe was an angel singing his soul away; and at half after nine he was\na lost man, floating over a delicious sea to that temporary heaven on\nearth where lovers usually land after the first rapturous plunge.\n\nIf anyone had mentioned this astonishing fact, nobody would have\nbelieved it; nevertheless, it was quite true, and sober, businesslike\nArchie suddenly discovered a fund of romance at the bottom of his\nhitherto well-conducted heart that amazed him. He was not quite clear\nwhat had happened to him at first, and sat about in a dazed sort of way,\nseeing, hearing, knowing nothing but Phebe, while the unconscious idol\nfound something wanting in the cordial praise so modestly received\nbecause Mr. Archie never said a word.\n\nThis was one of the remarkable things which occurred that evening.\nAnother was that Mac paid Rose a compliment, which was such an\nunprecedented fact, it produced a great sensation, though only one\nperson heard it.\n\nEverybody had gone but Mac and his father, who was busy with the doctor.\nAunt Plenty was counting the teaspoons in the dining room, and Phebe was\nhelping her as of old. Mac and Rose were alone he apparently in a brown\nstudy, leaning his elbows on the chimneypiece, and she lying back in a\nlow chair looking thoughtfully at the fire. She was tired, and the quiet\nwas grateful to her, so she kept silence and Mac respectfully held his\ntongue. Presently, however, she became conscious that he was looking at\nher as intently as eyes and glasses could do it, and without stirring\nfrom her comfortable attitude, she said, smiling up at him, \"He looks as\nwise as an owl I wonder what he's thinking about?\"\n\n\"You, Cousin.\"\n\n\"Something good, I hope?\"\n\n\"I was thinking Leigh Hunt was about right when he said, 'A girl is the\nsweetest thing God ever made.'\"\n\n\"Why, Mac!\" and Rose sat bolt upright with an astonished face this was\nsuch an entirely unexpected sort of remark for the philosopher to make.\n\nEvidently interested in the new discovery, Mac placidly continued, \"Do\nyou know, it seems as if I never really saw a girl before, or had\nany idea what agreeable creatures they could be. I fancy you are a\nremarkably good specimen, Rose.\"\n\n\"No, indeed! I'm only hearty and happy, and being safe at home again\nmay make me look better than usual perhaps, but I'm no beauty except to\nUncle.\"\n\n\"'Hearty and happy' that must be it,\" echoed Mac, soberly investigating\nthe problem. \"Most girls are sickly or silly, I think I have observed,\nand that is probably why I am so struck with you.\"\n\n\"Of all the queer boys you are the queerest! Do you really mean that\nyou don't like or notice girls?\" asked Rose, much amused at this new\npeculiarity of her studious cousin.\n\n\"Well, no, I am only conscious of two sorts noisy and quiet ones. I\nprefer the latter, but, as a general thing, I don't notice any of them\nmuch more than I do flies, unless they bother me, then I'd like to flap\nthem away, but as that won't do, I hide.\"\n\nRose leaned back and laughed until her eyes were full. It was so comical\nto hear Mac sink his voice to a confidential whisper at the last\nwords and see him smile with sinful satisfaction at the memory of the\ntormentors he had eluded.\n\n\"You needn't laugh it's a fact, I assure you. Charlie likes the\ncreatures, and they spoil him. Steve follows suit, of course. Archie is\na respectful slave when he can't help himself. As for me, I don't\noften give them a chance, and when I get caught I talk science and dead\nlanguages till they run for their lives. Now and then I find a sensible\none, and then we get on excellently.\"\n\n\"A sad prospect for Phebe and me,\" sighed Rose, trying to keep sober.\n\n\"Phebe is evidently a quiet one. I know she is sensible, or you wouldn't\ncare for her. I can see that she is pleasant to look at, so I fancy\nI shall like her. As for you, I helped bring you up, therefore I am a\nlittle anxious to see how you turn out. I was afraid your foreign polish\nmight spoil you, but I think it has not. In fact, I find you quite\nsatisfactory so far, if you don't mind my saying it. I don't quite know\nwhat the charm is, though. Must be the power of inward graces, since you\ninsist that you have no outer ones.\"\n\nMac was peering at her with a shrewd smile on his lips, but such a\nkindly look behind the glasses that she found both words and glance very\npleasant and answered merrily, \"I am glad you approve of me, and much\nobliged for your care of my early youth. I hope to be a credit to you\nand depend on your keeping me straight, for I'm afraid I shall be spoilt\namong you all.\"\n\n\"I'll keep my eye on you upon one condition,\" replied the youthful\nmentor.\n\n\"Name it.\"\n\n\"If you are going to have a lot of lovers around, I wash my hands of\nyou. If not, I'm your man.\"\n\n\"You must be sheep dog and help keep them away, for I don't want any yet\nawhile and, between ourselves, I don't believe I shall have any if it is\nknown that I am strong-minded. That fact will scare most men away like a\nyellow flag,\" said Rose, for, thanks to Dr. Alec's guardianship, she had\nwasted neither heart nor time in the foolish flirtations so many girls\nfritter away their youth upon.\n\n\"Hum! I rather doubt that,\" muttered Mac as he surveyed the damsel\nbefore him.\n\nShe certainly did not look unpleasantly strong-minded, and she was\nbeautiful in spite of her modest denials. Beautiful with the truest sort\nof beauty, for nobility of character lent its subtle charm to the bloom\nof youth, the freshness of health, the innocence of a nature whose sweet\nmaidenliness Mac felt but could not describe. Gentle yet full of spirit,\nand all aglow with the earnestness that suggests lovely possibilities\nand makes one hope that such human flowers may have heaven's purest air\nand warmest sunshine to blossom in.\n\n\"Wait and see,\" answered Rose; then, as her uncle's voice was heard in\nthe hall, she held out her hand, adding pleasantly, \"The old times are\nto begin again, so come soon and tell me all your doings and help me\nwith mine just as you used to do.\"\n\n\"You really mean it?\" And Mac looked much pleased.\n\n\"I really do. You are so little altered, except to grow big, that I\ndon't feel at all strange with you and want to begin where we left off.\"\n\n\"That will be capital. Good night, Cousin,\" and to her great amazement,\nhe gave her a hearty kiss.\n\n\"Oh, but that is not the old way at all!\" cried Rose, stepping back\nin merry confusion while the audacious youth assumed an air of mild\nsurprise as he innocently asked: \"Didn't we always say good night in\nthat way? I had an impression that we did and were to begin just as we\nleft off.\"\n\n\"Of course not. No power on earth would have bribed you to do it, as you\nknow well enough. I don't mind the first night, but we are too old for\nthat sort of thing now.\"\n\n\"I'll remember. It was the force of habit, I suppose, for I'm sure\nI must have done it in former times, it seemed so natural. Coming,\nFather!\" and Mac retired, evidently convinced he was right.\n\n\"Dear old thing! He is as much a boy as ever, and that is such a\ncomfort, for some of the others have grown up very fast,\" said Rose to\nherself, recalling Charlie's sentimental airs and Archie's beatified\nexpression while Phebe sang.\n\n\n\n\nChapter 2 OLD FRIENDS WITH NEW FACES\n\n\"It is so good to be home again! I wonder how we ever made up our minds\nto go away!\" exclaimed Rose as she went roaming about the old house next\nmorning, full of the satisfaction one feels at revisiting familiar nooks\nand corners and finding them unchanged.\n\n\"That we might have the pleasure of coming back again,\" answered Phebe,\nwalking down the hall beside her little mistress, as happy as she.\n\n\"Everything seems just as we left it, even to the rose leaves we used to\ntuck in here,\" continued the younger girl, peeping into one of the tall\nIndia jars that stood about the hall.\n\n\"Don't you remember how Jamie and Pokey used to play Forty Thieves with\nthem, and how you tried to get into that blue one and got stuck, and the\nother boys found us before I could pull you out?\" asked Phebe, laughing.\n\n\"Yes, indeed, and speaking of angels, one is apt to hear the rustling\nof their wings,\" added Rose, as a shrill whistle came up the avenue\naccompanied by the clatter of hoofs.\n\n\"It is the circus!\" cried Phebe gaily as they both recalled the red cart\nand the charge of the clan.\n\nThere was only one boy now, alas, but he made noise enough for half a\ndozen, and before Rose could run to the door, Jamie came bouncing in\nwith a \"shining morning face,\" a bat over his shoulder, a red and white\njockey cap on his head, one pocket bulging with a big ball, the other\noverflowing with cookies, and his mouth full of the apple he was just\nfinishing off in hot haste.\n\n\"Morning! I just looked in to make sure you'd really come and see that\nyou were all right,\" he observed, saluting with bat and doffing the gay\ncap with one effective twitch.\n\n\"Good morning, dear. Yes, we really are here, and getting to rights as\nfast as possible. But it seems to me you are rather gorgeous, Jamie.\nWhat do you belong to a fire company or a jockey club?\" asked Rose,\nturning up the once chubby face, which now was getting brown and square\nabout the chin.\n\n\"No, ma'am! Why, don't you know? I'm captain of the Base Ball Star\nClub. Look at that, will you?\" And, as if the fact were one of national\nimportance, Jamie flung open his jacket to display upon his proudly\nswelling chest an heart-shaped red flannel shield decorated with a white\ncotton star the size of a tea plate.\n\n\"Superb! I've been away so long I forgot there was such a game. And you\nthe captain?\" cried Rose, deeply impressed by the high honor to which\nher kinsman had arrived.\n\n\"I just am, and it's no joke you'd better believe, for we knock our\nteeth out, black our eyes, and split our fingers almost as well as the\nbig fellows. You come down to the Common between one and two and see us\nplay a match, then you'll understand what hard work it is. I'll teach\nyou to bat now if you'll come out on the lawn,\" added Jamie, fired with\na wish to exhibit his prowess.\n\n\"No, thank you, captain. The grass is wet, and you'll be late at school\nif you stay for us.\"\n\n\"I'm not afraid. Girls are not good for much generally, but you never\nused to mind a little wet and played cricket like a good one. Can't you\never do that sort of thing now?\" asked the boy, with a pitying look\nat these hapless creatures debarred from the joys and perils of manly\nsports.\n\n\"I can run still and I'll get to the gate before you, see if I don't.\"\nAnd, yielding to the impulse of the moment, Rose darted down the steps\nbefore astonished Jamie could mount and follow.\n\nHe was off in a moment, but Rose had the start, and though old Sheltie\ndid his best, she reached the goal just ahead, and stood there laughing\nand panting, all rosy with fresh October air, a pretty picture for\nseveral gentlemen who were driving by.\n\n\"Good for you, Rose!\" said Archie, jumping out to shake hands while Will\nand Geordie saluted and Uncle Mac laughed at Jamie, who looked as if\ngirls had risen slightly in his opinion.\n\n\"I'm glad it is you, because you won't be shocked. But I'm so happy to\nbe back I forgot I was not little Rose still,\" said Atalanta, smoothing\ndown her flying hair.\n\n\"You look very like her, with the curls on your shoulders in the old\nway. I missed them last night and wondered what it was. How are Uncle\nand Phebe?\" asked Archie, whose eyes had been looking over Rose's head\nwhile he spoke toward the piazza, where a female figure was visible\namong the reddening woodbines.\n\n\"All well, thanks. Won't you come up and see for yourselves?\"\n\n\"Can't, my dear, can't possibly. Business, you know, business. This\nfellow is my right-hand man, and I can't spare him a minute. Come, Arch,\nwe must be off, or these boys will miss their train,\" answered Uncle\nMac, pulling out his watch.\n\nWith a last look from the light-haired figure at the gate to the\ndark-haired one among the vines, Archie drove away and Jamie cantered\nafter, consoling himself for his defeat with apple number two.\n\nRose lingered a moment, feeling much inclined to continue her run and\npop in upon all the aunts in succession, but, remembering her uncovered\nhead, was about to turn back when a cheerful \"Ahoy! ahoy!\" made her look\nup to see Mac approaching at a great pace, waving his hat as he came.\n\n\"The Campbells are coming, thick and fast this morning, and the more the\nmerrier,\" she said, running to meet him. \"You look like a good boy going\nto school, and virtuously conning your lesson by the way,\" she added,\nsmiling to see him take his finger out of the book he had evidently been\nreading, and tuck it under his arm, just as he used to do years ago.\n\n\"I am a schoolboy, going to the school I like best,\" he answered, waving\na plumy spray of asters as if pointing out the lovely autumn world about\nthem, full of gay hues, fresh airs, and mellow sunshine.\n\n\"That reminds me that I didn't get a chance to hear much about your\nplans last night the other boys all talked at once, and you only got a\nword now and then. What have you decided to be, Mac?\" asked Rose as they\nwent up the avenue side by side.\n\n\"A man first, and a good one if possible. After that, what God pleases.\"\n\nSomething in the tone, as well as the words, made Rose look up quickly\ninto Mac's face to see a new expression there. It was indescribable, but\nshe felt as she had often done when watching the mists part suddenly,\ngiving glimpses of some mountaintop, shining serene and high against the\nblue.\n\n\"I think you will be something splendid, for you really look quite\nglorified, walking under this arch of yellow leaves with the sunshine on\nyour face,\" she exclaimed, conscious of a sudden admiration never felt\nbefore, for Mac was the plainest of all the cousins.\n\n\"I don't know about that, but I have my dreams and aspirations, and\nsome of them are pretty high ones. Aim at the best, you know, and keep\nclimbing if you want to get on,\" he said, looking at the asters with an\ninward sort of smile, as if he and they had some sweet secret between\nthem.\n\n\"You are queerer than ever. But I like your ambition, and hope you will\nget on. Only mustn't you begin at something soon? I fancied you would\nstudy medicine with Uncle that used to be our plan, you know.\"\n\n\"I shall, for the present at least, because I quite agree with you that\nit is necessary to have an anchor somewhere and not go floating off into\nthe world of imagination without ballast of the right sort. Uncle and\nI had some talk about it last night and I'm going to begin as soon as\npossible, for I've mooned long enough,\" and giving himself a shake, Mac\nthrew down the pretty spray, adding half aloud:\n\n    \"Chide me not, laborious band,\n      For the idle flowers I brought:\n\n    Every aster in my hand\n      Goes home laden with a thought.\"\n\nRose caught the words and smiled, thinking to herself, \"Oh, that's it\nhe is getting into the sentimental age and Aunt Jane has been lecturing\nhim. Dear me, how we are growing up!\"\n\n\"You look as if you didn't like the prospect very well,\" she said\naloud, for Mac had rammed the volume of Shelley into his pocket and the\nglorified expression was so entirely gone, Rose fancied she had been\nmistaken about the mountaintop behind the mists.\n\n\"Yes, well enough I always thought the profession a grand one, and\nwhere could I find a better teacher than Uncle? I've got into lazy ways\nlately, and it is high time I went at something useful, so here I go,\"\nand Mac abruptly vanished into the study while Rose joined Phebe in Aunt\nPlenty's room.\n\nThe dear old lady had just decided, after long and earnest discussion,\nwhich of six favorite puddings should be served for dinner, and thus had\na few moments to devote to sentiment, so when Rose came in she held out\nher arms, saying fondly: \"I shall not feel as if I'd got my child back\nagain until I have her in my lap a minute. No, you're not a bit too\nheavy, my rheumatism doesn't begin much before November, so sit here,\ndarling, and put your two arms round my neck.\"\n\nRose obeyed, and neither spoke for a moment as the old woman held the\nyoung one close and appeased the two years' longing of a motherly heart\nby the caresses women give the creatures dearest to them. Right in the\nmiddle of a kiss, however, she stopped suddenly and, holding out one\narm, caught Phebe, who was trying to steal away unobserved.\n\n\"Don't go there's room for both in my love, though there isn't in my\nlap. I'm so grateful to get my dear girls safely home again that I\nhardly know what I'm about,\" said Aunt Plenty, embracing Phebe so\nheartily that she could not feel left out in the cold and stood there\nwith her black eyes shining through the happiest tears.\n\n\"There, now I've had a good hug, and feel as if I was all right again. I\nwish you'd set that cap in order, Rose I went to bed in such a hurry,\nI pulled the strings off it and left it all in a heap. Phebe, dear, you\nshall dust round a mite, just as you used to, for I haven't had anyone\nto do it as I like since you've been gone, and it will do me good to see\nall my knickknacks straightened out in your tidy way,\" said the elder\nlady, getting up with a refreshed expression on her rosy old face.\n\n\"Shall I dust in here too?\" asked Phebe, glancing toward an inner room\nwhich used to be her care.\n\n\"No, dear, I'd rather do that myself. Go in if you like, nothing is\nchanged. I must go and see to my pudding.\" And Aunt Plenty trotted\nabruptly away with a quiver of emotion in her voice which made even her\nlast words pathetic.\n\nPausing on the threshold as if it was a sacred place, the girls looked\nin with eyes soon dimmed by tender tears, for it seemed as if the gentle\noccupant was still there. Sunshine shone on the old geraniums by the\nwindow; the cushioned chair stood in its accustomed place, with the\nwhite wrapper hung across it and the faded slippers lying ready. Books\nand basket, knitting and spectacles, were all just as she had left them,\nand the beautiful tranquility that always filled the room seemed so\nnatural, both lookers turned involuntarily toward the bed, where Aunt\nPeace used to greet them with a smile. There was no sweet old face upon\nthe pillow now, yet the tears that wet the blooming cheeks were not for\nher who had gone, but for her who was left, because they saw something\nwhich spoke eloquently of the love which outlives death and makes the\nhumblest things beautiful and sacred.\n\nA well-worn footstool stood beside the bed, and in the high-piled\nwhiteness of the empty couch there was a little hollow where a gray head\nnightly rested while Aunt Plenty said the prayers her mother taught her\nseventy years ago.\n\nWithout a word, the girls softly shut the door. And while Phebe put the\nroom in the most exquisite order, Rose retrimmed the plain white cap,\nwhere pink and yellow ribbons never rustled now, both feeling honored\nby their tasks and better for their knowledge of the faithful love and\npiety which sanctified a good old woman's life.\n\n\"You darling creature, I'm so glad to get you back! I know it's\nshamefully early, but I really couldn't keep away another minute. Let\nme help you I'm dying to see all your splendid things. I saw the trunks\npass and I know you've quantities of treasures,\" cried Annabel Bliss all\nin one breath as she embraced Rose an hour later and glanced about the\nroom bestrewn with a variety of agreeable objects.\n\n\"How well you are looking! Sit down and I'll show you my lovely\nphotographs. Uncle chose all the best for me, and it's a treat to see\nthem,\" answered Rose, putting a roll on the table and looking about for\nmore.\n\n\"Oh, thanks! I haven't time now one needs hours to study such things.\nShow me your Paris dresses, there's a dear I'm perfectly aching to see\nthe last styles,\" and Annabel cast a hungry eye toward certain large\nboxes delightfully suggestive of French finery.\n\n\"I haven't got any,\" said Rose, fondly surveying the fine photographs as\nshe laid them away.\n\n\"Rose Campbell! You don't mean to say that you didn't get one Paris\ndress at least?\" cried Annabel, scandalized at the bare idea of such\nneglect.\n\n\"Not one for myself. Aunt Clara ordered several, and will be charmed to\nshow them when her box comes.\"\n\n\"Such a chance! Right there and plenty of money! How could you love your\nuncle after such cruelty?\" sighed Annabel, with a face full of sympathy.\n\nRose looked puzzled for a minute, then seemed to understand, and assumed\na superior air which became her very well as she said, good-naturedly\nopening a box of laces, \"Uncle did not forbid my doing it, and I had\nmoney enough, but I chose not to spend it on things of that sort.\"\n\n\"Could and didn't! I can't believe it!\" And Annabel sank into a chair,\nas if the thought was too much for her.\n\n\"I did rather want to at first, just for the fun of the thing. In fact,\nI went and looked at some amazing gowns. But they were very expensive,\nvery much trimmed, and not my style at all, so I gave them up and kept\nwhat I valued more than all the gowns Worth every made.\"\n\n\"What in the world was it?\" cried Annabel, hoping she would say\ndiamonds.\n\n\"Uncle's good opinion,\" answered Rose, looking thoughtfully into the\ndepths of a packing case, where lay the lovely picture that would always\nremind her of the little triumph over girlish vanity, which not only\nkept but increased \"Uncle's good opinion.\"\n\n\"Oh, indeed!\" said Annabel blankly, and fell to examining Aunt Plenty's\nlace while Rose went on with a happy smile in her eyes as she dived into\nanother trunk.\n\n\"Uncle thinks one has no right to waste money on such things, but he\nis very generous and loves to give useful, beautiful, or curious gifts.\nSee, all these pretty ornaments are for presents, and you shall choose\nfirst whatever you like.\"\n\n\"He's a perfect dear!\" cried Annabel, reveling in the crystal, filigree,\ncoral, and mosaic trinkets spread before her while Rose completed her\nrapture by adding sundry tasteful trifles fresh from Paris.\n\n\"Now tell me, when do you mean to have your coming-out party? I ask\nbecause I've nothing ready and want plenty of time, for I suppose it\nwill be the event of the season,\" asked Annabel a few minutes later as\nshe wavered between a pink coral and a blue lava set.\n\n\"I came out when I went to Europe, but I suppose Aunty Plen will want to\nhave some sort of merry-making to celebrate our return. I shall begin\nas I mean to go on, and have a simple, sociable sort of party and invite\neveryone whom I like, no matter in what 'set' they happen to belong. No\none shall ever say I am aristocratic and exclusive so prepare yourself\nto be shocked, for old friends and young, rich and poor, will be asked\nto all my parties.\"\n\n\"Oh, my heart! You are going to be odd, just as Mama predicted!\" sighed\nAnnabel, clasping her hands in despair and studying the effect of three\nbracelets on her chubby arm in the midst of her woe.\n\n\"In my own house I'm going to do as I think best, and if people call me\nodd, I can't help it. I shall endeavor not to do anything very dreadful,\nbut I seem to inherit Uncle's love for experiments and mean to try some.\nI daresay they will fail and I shall get laughed at. I intend to do it\nnevertheless, so you had better drop me now before I begin,\" said Rose\nwith an air of resolution that was rather alarming.\n\n\"What shall you wear at this new sort of party of yours?\" asked Annabel,\nwisely turning a deaf ear to all delicate or dangerous topics and\nkeeping to matters she understood.\n\n\"That white thing over there. It is fresh and pretty, and Phebe has one\nlike it. I never want to dress more than she does, and gowns of that\nsort are always most becoming and appropriate to girls of our age.\"\n\n\"Phebe! You don't mean to say you are going to make a lady of her!\"\ngasped Annabel, upsetting her treasures as she fell back with a gesture\nthat made the little chair creak again, for Miss Bliss was as plump as a\npartridge.\n\n\"She is one already, and anybody who slights her slights me, for she is\nthe best girl I know and the dearest,\" cried Rose warmly.\n\n\"Yes, of course I was only surprised you are quite right, for she may\nturn out to be somebody, and then how glad you'll feel that you were so\ngood to her!\" said Annabel, veering around at once, seeing which way the\nwind blew.\n\nBefore Rose could speak again, a cheery voice called from the hall,\n\"Little mistress, where are you?\"\n\n\"In my room, Phebe, dear,\" and up came the girl Rose was going to \"make\na lady of,\" looking so like one that Annabel opened her china-blue eyes\nand smiled involuntarily as Phebe dropped a little curtsey in playful\nimitation of her old manner and said quietly: \"How do you do, Miss\nBliss?\"\n\n\"Glad to see you back, Miss Moore,\" answered Annabel, shaking hands in a\nway that settled the question of Phebe's place in her mind forever, for\nthe stout damsel had a kind heart in spite of a weak head and was really\nfond of Rose. It was evidently \"Love me, love my Phebe,\" so she made up\nher mind on the spot that Phebe was somebody, and that gave an air of\nromance even to the poorhouse.\n\nShe could not help staring a little as she watched the two friends work\ntogether and listened to their happy talk over each new treasure as\nit came to light, for every look and word plainly showed that years\nof close companionship had made them very dear to one another. It was\npretty to see Rose try to do the hardest part of any little job herself\nstill prettier to see Phebe circumvent her and untie the hard knots,\nfold the stiff papers, or lift the heavy trays with her own strong\nhands, and prettiest of all to hear her say in a motherly tone, as she\nput Rose into an easy chair: \"Now, my deary, sit and rest, for you\nwill have to see company all day, and I can't let you get tired out so\nearly.\"\n\n\"That is no reason why I should let you either. Call Jane to help or\nI'll bob up again directly,\" answered Rose, with a very bad assumption\nof authority.\n\n\"Jane may take my place downstairs, but no one shall wait on you here\nexcept me, as long as I'm with you,\" said stately Phebe, stooping to put\na hassock under the feet of her little mistress.\n\n\"It is very nice and pretty to see, but I don't know what people will\nsay when she goes into society with the rest of us. I do hope Rose won't\nbe very odd,\" said Annabel to herself as she went away to circulate\nthe depressing news that there was to be no grand ball and, saddest\ndisappointment of all, that Rose had not a single Paris costume with\nwhich to refresh the eyes and rouse the envy of her amiable friends.\n\n\"Now I've seen or heard from all the boys but Charlie, and I suppose he\nis too busy. I wonder what he is about,\" thought Rose, turning from the\nhall door, whither she had courteously accompanied her guest.\n\nThe wish was granted a moment after, for, going into the parlor to\ndecide where some of her pictures should hang, she saw a pair of brown\nboots at one end of the sofa, a tawny-brown head at the other, and\ndiscovered that Charlie was busily occupied in doing nothing.\n\n\"The voice of the Bliss was heard in the land, so I dodged till she went\nupstairs, and then took a brief siesta while waiting to pay my respects\nto the distinguished traveler, Lady Hester Stanhope,\" he said, leaping\nup to make his best bow.\n\n\"The voice of the sluggard would be a more appropriate quotation, I\nthink. Does Annabel still pine for you?\" asked Rose, recalling certain\nyouthful jokes upon the subject of unrequited affections.\n\n\"Not a bit of it. Fun has cut me out, and the fair Annabella will be\nMrs. Tokio before the winter is over if I'm not much mistaken.\"\n\n\"What, little Fun See? How droll it seems to think of him grown up and\nmarried to Annabel of all people! She never said a word about him, but\nthis accounts for her admiring my pretty Chinese things and being so\ninterested in Canton.\"\n\n\"Little Fun is a great swell now, and much enamored of our fat friend,\nwho will take to chopsticks whenever he says the word. I needn't ask how\nyou do, Cousin, for you beat that Aurora all hollow in the way of color.\nI should have been up before, but I thought you'd like a good rest after\nyour voyage.\"\n\n\"I was running a race with Jamie before nine o'clock. What were you\ndoing, young man?\"\n\n\"'Sleeping I dreamed, love, dreamed, love, of thee,'\" began Charlie, but\nRose cut him short by saying as reproachfully as she could, while the\nculprit stood regarding her with placid satisfaction: \"You ought to have\nbeen up and at work like the rest of the boys. I felt like a drone in\na hive of very busy bees when I saw them all hurrying off to their\nbusiness.\"\n\n\"But, my dear girl, I've got no business. I'm making up my mind, you\nsee, and do the ornamental while I'm deciding. There always ought to\nbe one gentleman in a family, and that seems to be rather my line,\"\nanswered Charlie, posing for the character with an assumption of languid\nelegance which would have been very effective if his twinkling eyes had\nnot spoilt it.\n\n\"There are none but gentlemen in our family, I hope,\" answered Rose,\nwith the proud air she always wore when anything was said derogatory to\nthe name of Campbell.\n\n\"Of course, of course. I should have said gentleman of leisure. You see\nit is against my principles to slave as Archie does. What's the use?\nDon't need the money, got plenty, so why not enjoy it and keep jolly\nas long as possible? I'm sure cheerful people are public benefactors in\nthis world of woe.\"\n\nIt was not easy to object to this proposition, especially when made by\na comely young man who looked the picture of health and happiness as he\nsat on the arm of the sofa smiling at his cousin in the most engaging\nmanner. Rose knew very well that the Epicurean philosophy was not the\ntrue one to begin life upon, but it was difficult to reason with Charlie\nbecause he always dodged sober subjects and was so full of cheery\nspirits, one hated to lessen the sort of sunshine which certainly is a\npublic benefactor.\n\n\"You have such a clever way of putting things that I don't know how to\ncontradict you, though I still think I'm right,\" she said gravely. \"Mac\nlikes to idle as well as you, but he is not going to do it because he\nknows it's bad for him to fritter away his time. He is going to study\na profession like a wise boy, though he would much prefer to live among\nhis beloved books or ride his hobbies in peace.\"\n\n\"That's all very well for him, because he doesn't care for society and\nmay as well be studying medicine as philandering about the woods\nwith his pockets full of musty philosophers and old-fashioned poets,\"\nanswered Charlie with a shrug which plainly expressed his opinion of\nMac.\n\n\"I wonder if musty philosophers, like Socrates and Aristotle, and\nold-fashioned poets, like Shakespeare and Milton, are not safer company\nfor him to keep than some of the more modern friends you have?\" said\nRose, remembering Jamie's hints about wild oats, for she could be a\nlittle sharp sometimes and had not lectured \"the boys\" for so long it\nseemed unusually pleasant.\n\nBut Charlie changed the subject skillfully by exclaiming with an anxious\nexpression: \"I do believe you are going to be like Aunt Jane, for that's\njust the way she comes down on me whenever she gets the chance!\nDon't take her for a model, I beg she is a good woman but a mighty\ndisagreeable one in my humble opinion.\"\n\nThe fear of being disagreeable is a great bugbear to a girl, as this\nartful young man well knew, and Rose fell into the trap at once, for\nAunt Jane was far from being her model, though she could not help\nrespecting her worth.\n\n\"Have you given up your painting?\" she asked rather abruptly, turning to\na gilded Fra Angelico angel which leaned in the sofa corner.\n\n\"Sweetest face I ever saw, and very like you about the eyes, isn't\nit?\" said Charlie, who seemed to have a Yankee trick of replying to one\nquestion with another.\n\n\"I want an answer, not a compliment,\" and Rose tried to look severe as\nshe put away the picture more quickly than she had taken it up.\n\n\"Have I given up painting? Oh, no! I daub a little in oils, slop a\nlittle in watercolors, sketch now and then, and poke about the studios\nwhen the artistic fit comes on.\"\n\n\"How is the music?\"\n\n\"More flourishing. I don't practice much, but sing a good deal in\ncompany. Set up a guitar last summer and went troubadouring round in\ngreat style. The girls like it, and it's jolly among the fellows.\"\n\n\"Are you studying anything?\"\n\n\"Well, I have some lawbooks on my table good, big, wise-looking chaps\nand I take a turn at them semioccasionally when pleasure palls or\nparents chide. But I doubt if I do more than learn what 'a allybi' is\nthis year,\" and a sly laugh in Charlie's eye suggested that he sometimes\navailed himself of this bit of legal knowledge.\n\n\"What do you do then?\"\n\n\"Fair catechist, I enjoy myself. Private theatricals have been the rage\nof late, and I have won such laurels that I seriously think of adopting\nthe stage as my profession.\"\n\n\"Really!\" cried Rose, alarmed.\n\n\"Why not? If I must go to work, isn't that as good as anything?\"\n\n\"Not without more talent than I think you possess. With genius one can\ndo anything without it one had better let the stage alone.\"\n\n\"There's a quencher for the 'star of the goodlie companie' to which I\nbelong. Mac hasn't a ray of genius for anything, yet you admire him for\ntrying to be an M.D.,\" cried Charlie, rather nettled at her words.\n\n\"It is respectable, at all events, and I'd rather be a second-rate\ndoctor than a second-rate actor. But I know you don't mean it, and only\nsay so to frighten me.\"\n\n\"Exactly. I always bring it up when anyone begins to lecture and it\nworks wonders. Uncle Mac turns pale, the aunts hold up their hands in\nholy horror, and a general panic ensues. Then I magnanimously promise\nnot to disgrace the family and in the first burst of gratitude the dear\nsouls agree to everything I ask, so peace is restored and I go on my way\nrejoicing.\"\n\n\"Just the way you used to threaten to run off to sea if your mother\nobjected to any of your whims. You are not changed in that respect,\nthough you are in others. You had great plans and projects once,\nCharlie, and now you seem to be contented with being a 'jack of all\ntrades and master of none'\".\n\n\"Boyish nonsense! Time has brought wisdom, and I don't see the sense of\ntying myself down to one particular thing and grinding away at it year\nafter year. People of one idea get so deucedly narrow and tame, I've\nno patience with them. Culture is the thing, and the sort one gets by\nranging over a wide field is the easiest to acquire, the handiest to\nhave, and the most successful in the end. At any rate, it is the kind I\nlike and the only kind I intend to bother myself about.\"\n\nWith this declaration, Charlie smoothed his brow, clasped his hands over\nhis head, and, leaning back, gently warbled the chorus of a college song\nas if it expressed his views of life better than he could:\n\n    \"While our rosy fillets shed\n    Blushes o'er each fervid head,\n    With many a cup and many a smile\n    The festal moments we beguile.\"\n\n\"Some of my saints here were people of one idea, and though they were\nnot very successful from a worldly point of view while alive, they were\nloved and canonized when dead,\" said Rose, who had been turning over a\npile of photographs on the table and just then found her favorite, St.\nFrancis, among them.\n\n\"This is more to my taste. Those worn-out, cadaverous fellows give me\nthe blues, but here's a gentlemanly saint who takes things easy and does\ngood as he goes along without howling over his own sins or making other\npeople miserable by telling them of theirs.\" And Charlie laid a handsome\nSt. Martin beside the brown-frocked monk.\n\nRose looked at both and understood why her cousin preferred the\nsoldierly figure with the sword to the ascetic with his crucifix. One\nwas riding bravely through the world in purple and fine linen, with\nhorse and hound and squires at his back; and the other was in a\nlazar-house, praying over the dead and dying. The contrast was a strong\none, and the girl's eyes lingered longest on the knight, though she said\nthoughtfully, \"Yours is certainly the pleasantest and yet I never heard\nof any good deed he did, except divide his cloak with a beggar, while\nSt. Francis gave himself to charity just when life was most tempting and\nspent years working for God without reward. He's old and poor, and in a\ndreadful place, but I won't give him up, and you may have your gay St.\nMartin if you want him.\"\n\n\"No, thank you, saints are not in my line but I'd like the golden-haired\nangel in the blue gown if you'll let me have her. She shall be my little\nMadonna, and I'll pray to her like a good Catholic,\" answered Charlie,\nturning to the delicate, deep-eyed figure with the lilies in its hand.\n\n\"With all my heart, and any others that you like. Choose some for your\nmother and give them to her with my love.\"\n\nSo Charlie sat down beside Rose to turn and talk over the pictures for\na long and pleasant hour. But when they went away to lunch, if there\nhad been anyone to observe so small but significant a trifle, good St.\nFrancis lay face downward behind the sofa, while gallant St. Martin\nstood erect upon the chimneypiece.\n\n\n\n\nChapter 3 MISS CAMPBELL\n\nWhile the travelers unpack their trunks, we will pick up, as briefly as\npossible, the dropped stitches in the little romance we are weaving.\n\nRose's life had been a very busy and quiet one for the four years\nfollowing the May day when she made her choice. Study, exercise,\nhousework, and many wholesome pleasures kept her a happy, hearty\ncreature, yearly growing in womanly graces, yet always preserving\nthe innocent freshness girls lose so soon when too early set upon the\nworld's stage and given a part to play.\n\nNot a remarkably gifted girl in any way, and far from perfect; full of\nall manner of youthful whims and fancies; a little spoiled by much love;\nrather apt to think all lives as safe and sweet as her own; and,\nwhen want or pain appealed to her, the tender heart overflowed with a\nremorseful charity which gave of its abundance recklessly. Yet, with\nall her human imperfections, the upright nature of the child kept her\ndesires climbing toward the just and pure and true, as flowers struggle\nto the light; and the woman's soul was budding beautifully under the\ngreen leaves behind the little thorns.\n\nAt seventeen, Dr. Alec pronounced her ready for the voyage around the\nworld, which he considered a better finishing off than any school\ncould give her. But just then Aunt Peace began to fail and soon slipped\nquietly away to rejoin the lover she had waited for so long. Youth\nseemed to come back in a mysterious way to touch the dead face with lost\nloveliness, and all the romance of her past to gather around her memory.\nUnlike most aged women, her friends were among the young, and at her\nfuneral the grayheads gave place to the band of loving girls who made\nthe sweet old maiden ready for her rest, bore her pall, and covered her\ngrave with the white flowers she had never worn.\n\nWhen this was over poor Aunt Plenty seemed so lost without her lifelong\ncharge that Dr. Alec would not leave her, and Rose gladly paid the debt\nshe owed by the tender service which comforts without words. But Aunt\nPlenty, having lived for others all her days, soon rebelled against this\nwilling sacrifice, soon found strength in her own sincere piety, solace\nin cheerful occupation, and amusement in nursing Aunt Myra, who was a\ncapital patient, as she never died and never got well.\n\nSo at last the moment came when, with free minds, the travelers could\nset out, and on Rose's eighteenth birthday, with Uncle Alec and the\nfaithful Phebe, she sailed away to see and study the big, beautiful\nworld which lies ready for us all if we only know how to use and enjoy\nit.\n\nPhebe was set to studying music in the best schools, and while she\ntrained her lovely voice with happy industry, Rose and her uncle roamed\nabout in the most delightful way till two years were gone like a dream\nand those at home clamored for their return.\n\nBack they came, and now the heiress must make ready to take her place,\nfor at twenty-one she came into possession of the fortune she had been\ntrying to learn how to use well. Great plans fermented in her brain,\nfor, though the heart was as generous as ever, time had taught her\nprudence and observation shown her that the wisest charity is that which\nhelps the poor to help themselves.\n\nDr. Alec found it a little difficult to restrain the ardor of this young\nphilanthropist who wanted to begin at once to endow hospitals, build\nhomes, adopt children, and befriend all mankind.\n\n\"Take a little time to look about you and get your bearings, child. The\nworld you have been living in is a much simpler, honester one than that\nyou are now to enter. Test yourself a bit and see if the old ways seem\nbest after all, for you are old enough to decide, and wise enough to\ndiscover, what is for your truest good, I hope,\" he said, trying to feel\nready to let the bird escape from under his wing and make little flights\nalone.\n\n\"Now, Uncle, I'm very much afraid you are going to be disappointed in\nme,\" answered Rose with unusual hesitation yet a very strong desire\nvisible in her eyes. \"You like to have me quite honest, and I've learned\nto tell you all my foolish thoughts so I'll speak out, and if you find\nmy wish very wrong and silly, please say so, for I don't want you to\ncast me off entirely, though I am grown up. You say, wait a little, test\nmyself, and try if the old ways are best. I should like to do that, and\ncan I in a better way than leading the life other girls lead? Just for a\nlittle while,\" she added, as her uncle's face grew grave.\n\nHe was disappointed, yet acknowledged that the desire was natural and\nin a moment saw that a trial of this sort might have its advantages.\nNevertheless, he dreaded it, for he had intended to choose her society\ncarefully and try to keep her unspoiled by the world as long as\npossible, like many another fond parent and guardian. But the spirit of\nEve is strong in all her daughters forbidden fruit will look rosier to\nthem than any in their own orchards, and the temptation to take just one\nlittle bite proves irresistible to the wisest. So Rose, looking out from\nthe safe seclusion of her girlhood into the woman's kingdom which she\nwas about to take possession of, felt a sudden wish to try its pleasures\nbefore assuming its responsibilities, and was too sincere to hide the\nlonging.\n\n\"Very well, my dear, try it if you like, only take care of your health\nbe temperate in your gaiety and don't lose more than you gain, if that\nis possible,\" he added under his breath, endeavoring to speak cheerfully\nand not look anxious.\n\n\"I know it is foolish, but I do want to be a regular butterfly for a\nlittle while and see what it is like. You know I couldn't help seeing a\ngood deal of fashionable life abroad, though we were not in it, and here\nat home the girls tell me about all sorts of pleasant things that are to\nhappen this winter, so if you won't despise me very much, I should like\nto try it.\"\n\n\"For how long?\"\n\n\"Would three months be too long? New Year is a good time to take a fresh\nstart. Everyone is going to welcome me, so I must be gay in spite of\nmyself, unless I'm willing to seem very ungrateful and morose,\" said\nRose, glad to have so good a reason to offer for her new experiment.\n\n\"You may like it so well that the three months may become years.\nPleasure is very sweet when we are young.\"\n\n\"Do you think it will intoxicate me?\"\n\n\"We shall see, my dear.\"\n\n\"We shall!\" And Rose marched away, looking as if she had taken a pledge\nof some sort, and meant to keep it.\n\nIt was a great relief to the public mind when it became known that Miss\nCampbell was really coming out at last, and invitations to Aunt Plenty's\nparty were promptly accepted. Aunt Clara was much disappointed about the\ngrand ball she had planned, but Rose stood firm, and the dear old lady\nhad her way about everything.\n\nThe consequence was a delightfully informal gathering of friends to\nwelcome the travelers home. Just a good, old-fashioned, hospitable\nhousewarming, so simple, cordial, and genuine that those who came to\ncriticize remained to enjoy, and many owned the charm they could neither\ndescribe nor imitate.\n\nMuch curiosity was felt about Phebe, and much gossip went on behind fans\nthat evening, for those who had known her years ago found it hard to\nrecognize the little housemaid in the handsome young woman who bore\nherself with such quiet dignity and charmed them all with her fine\nvoice. \"Cinderella has turned out a princess,\" was the general verdict,\nand Rose enjoyed the little sensation immensely, for she had had many\nbattles to fight for her Phebe since she came among them, and now her\nfaith was vindicated.\n\nMiss Campbell herself was in great demand and did the honors so prettily\nthat even Miss Bliss forgave her for her sad neglect of Worth, though\nshe shook her head over the white gowns, just alike except that Phebe\nwore crimson and Rose, blue trimmings.\n\nThe girls swarmed eagerly around their recovered friend, for Rose had\nbeen a favorite before she went away and found her throne waiting for\nher now. The young men privately pronounced Phebe the handsomest \"But\nthen you know there's neither family nor money, so it's no use.\" Phebe,\ntherefore, was admired as one of the ornamental properties belonging to\nthe house and left respectfully alone.\n\nBut bonny Rose was \"all right,\" as these amiable youths expressed it,\nand many a wistful eye followed the bright head as it flitted about the\nrooms as if it were a second Golden Fleece to be won with difficulty,\nfor stalwart kinsmen hedged it round, and watchful aunts kept guard.\n\nLittle wonder that the girl found her new world an enchanting one and\nthat her first sip of pleasure rather went to her head, for everybody\nwelcomed and smiled on her, flattered and praised, whispered agreeable\nprophecies in her ear, and looked the compliments and congratulations\nthey dared not utter till she felt as if she must have left her old self\nsomewhere abroad and suddenly become a new and wonderfully gifted being.\n\n\"It is very nice, Uncle, and I'm not sure I mayn't want another three\nmonths of it when the first are gone,\" she whispered to Dr. Alec as he\nstood watching the dance she was leading with Charlie in the long hall\nafter supper.\n\n\"Steady, my lass, steady, and remember that you are not really a\nbutterfly but a mortal girl with a head that will ache tomorrow,\" he\nanswered, watching the flushed and smiling face before him. \"I almost\nwish there wasn't any tomorrow, but that tonight would last forever it\nis so pleasant, and everyone so kind,\" she said with a little sigh of\nhappiness as she gathered up her fleecy skirts like a white bird pluming\nitself for flight.\n\n\"I'll ask your opinion about that at two A.M.,\" began her uncle with a\nwarning nod.\n\n\"I'll give it honestly,\" was all Rose had time to say before Charlie\nswept her away into the particolored cloud before them.\n\n\"It's no use, Alec train a girl as wisely as you choose, she will break\nloose when the time comes and go in for pleasure as eagerly as the most\nfrivolous, for ''tis their nature to,'\" said Uncle Mac, keeping time\nto the music as if he would not mind \"going in\" for a bit of pleasure\nhimself.\n\n\"My girl shall taste and try, but unless I'm much mistaken, a little\nbit of it will satisfy her. I want to see if she will stand the test,\nbecause if not, all my work is a failure and I'd like to know it,\"\nanswered the doctor with a hopeful smile on his lips but an anxious look\nin his eyes.\n\n\"She will come out all right bless her heart! so let her sow her\ninnocent wild oats and enjoy herself till she is ready to settle down.\nI wish all our young folks were likely to have as small a crop and get\nthrough as safely as she will,\" added Uncle Mac with a shake of the head\nas he glanced at some of the young men revolving before him.\n\n\"Nothing amiss with your lads, I hope?\"\n\n\"No, thank heaven! So far I've had little trouble with either, though\nMac is an odd stick and Steve a puppy. I don't complain, for both will\noutgrow that sort of thing and are good fellows at heart, thanks to\ntheir mother. But Clara's boy is in a bad way, and she will spoil him as\na man as she has as a boy if his father doesn't interfere.\"\n\n\"I told brother Stephen all about him when I was in Calcutta last year,\nand he wrote to the boy, but Clara has got no end of plans in her head\nand so she insisted on keeping Charlie a year longer when his father\nordered him off to India,\" replied the doctor as they walked away.\n\n\"It is too late to 'order' Charlie is a man now, and Stephen will find\nhe has been too easy with him all these years. Poor fellow, it has been\nhard lines for him, and is likely to be harder, I fancy, unless he comes\nhome and straightens things out.\"\n\n\"He won't do that if he can help it. He has lost all his energy living\nin that climate and hates worry more than ever, so you can imagine what\nan effort it would be to manage a foolish woman and a headstrong boy. We\nmust lend a hand, Mac, and do our best for poor old Steve.\"\n\n\"The best we can do for the lad is to marry and settle him as soon as\npossible.\"\n\n\"My dear fellow, he is only three and twenty,\" began the doctor, as\nif the idea was preposterous. Then a sudden change came over him as\nhe added with a melancholy smile, \"I forget how much one can hope and\nsuffer, even at twenty-three.\"\n\n\"And be all the better for, if bravely outlived,\" said Uncle Mac, with\nhis hand on his brother's shoulder and the sincerest approval in\nhis voice. Then, kindly returning to the younger people, he went on\ninquiringly, \"You don't incline to Clara's view of a certain matter, I\nfancy?\"\n\n\"Decidedly not. My girl must have the best, and Clara's training would\nspoil an angel,\" answered Dr. Alec quickly.\n\n\"But we shall find it hard to let our little Rose go out of the family.\nHow would Archie do? He has been well brought up and is a thoroughly\nexcellent lad.\"\n\nThe brothers had retired to the study by this time and were alone, yet\nDr. Alec lowered his voice as he said with a tender sort of anxiety\npleasant to see: \"You know I do not approve of cousins marrying, so I'm\nin a quandary, Mac, for I love the child as if she were my own and feel\nas if I could not give her up to any man whom I did not know and trust\nentirely. It is of no use for us to plan, for she must choose for\nherself yet I do wish we could keep her among us and give one of our\nboys a wife worth having.\"\n\n\"We must, so never mind your theories but devote yourself to testing our\nelder lads and making one of them a happy fellow. All are heart-whole,\nI believe, and, though young still for this sort of thing, we can be\ngently shaping matters for them, since no one knows how soon the moment\nmay come. My faith it is like living in a powder mill to be among a lot\nof young folks nowadays! All looks as calm as possible till a sudden\nspark produces an explosion, and heaven only knows where we find\nourselves after it is over.\"\n\nAnd Uncle Mac sat himself comfortably down to settle Rose's fate while\nthe doctor paced the room, plucking at his beard and knitting his brows\nas if he found it hard to see his way.\n\n\"Yes, Archie is a good fellow,\" he said, answering the question he had\nignored before. \"An upright, steady, intelligent lad who will make an\nexcellent husband if he ever finds out that he has a heart. I suppose\nI'm an old fool, but I do like a little more romance in a young man than\nhe seems to have more warmth and enthusiasm, you know. Bless the boy! He\nmight be forty instead of three or four and twenty, he's so sober, calm,\nand cool. I'm younger than he is, and could go a-wooing like a Romeo if\nI had any heart to offer a woman.\"\n\nThe doctor looked rather shamefaced as he spoke, and his brother\nburst out laughing. \"See here, Alec, it's a pity so much romance and\nexcellence as yours should be lost, so why don't you set these young\nfellows an example and go a-wooing yourself? Jessie has been wondering\nhow you have managed to keep from falling in love with Phebe all this\ntime, and Clara is quite sure that you waited only till she was safe\nunder Aunt Plenty's wing to offer yourself in the good old-fashioned\nstyle.\"\n\n\"I!\" And the doctor stood aghast at the mere idea, then he gave a\nresigned sort of sigh and added like a martyr, \"If those dear women\nwould let me alone, I'd thank them forever. Put the idea out of their\nminds for heaven's sake, Mac, or I shall be having that poor girl flung\nat my head and her comfort destroyed. She is a fine creature and I'm\nproud of her, but she deserves a better lot than to be tied to an old\nfellow like me whose only merit is his fidelity.\"\n\n\"As you please, I was only joking,\" and Uncle Mac dropped the subject\nwith secret relief. The excellent man thought a good deal of family and\nhad been rather worried at the hints of the ladies. After a moment's\nsilence he returned to a former topic, which was rather a pet plan of\nhis. \"I don't think you do Archie justice, Alec. You don't know him as\nwell as I do, but you'll find that he has heart enough under his cool,\nquiet manner. I've grown very fond of him, think highly of him, and\ndon't see how you could do better for Rose than to give her to him.\"\n\n\"If she will go,\" said the doctor, smiling at his brother's businesslike\nway of disposing of the young people.\n\n\"She'll do anything to please you,\" began Uncle Mac in perfect good\nfaith, for twenty-five years in the society of a very prosaic wife had\ntaken nearly all the romance out of him.\n\n\"It is of no use for us to plan, and I shall never interfere except to\nadvise, and if I were to choose one of the boys, I should incline to my\ngodson,\" answered the doctor gravely.\n\n\"What, my Ugly Duckling!\" exclaimed Uncle Mac in great surprise.\n\n\"The Ugly Duckling turned out a swan, you remember. I've always been\nfond of the boy because he's so genuine and original. Crude as a green\napple now, but sound at the core, and only needs time to ripen. I'm sure\nhe'll turn out a capital specimen of the Campbell variety.\"\n\n\"Much obliged, Alec, but it will never do at all. He's a good fellow,\nand may do something to be proud of by and by, but he's not the mate\nfor our Rose. She needs someone who can manage her property when we are\ngone, and Archie is the man for that, depend upon it.\"\n\n\"Confound the property!\" cried Dr. Alec impetuously. \"I want her to\nbe happy, and I don't care how soon she gets rid of her money if it is\ngoing to be a millstone round her neck. I declare to you, I dreaded the\nthought of this time so much that I've kept her away as long as I could\nand trembled whenever a young fellow joined us while we were abroad.\nHad one or two narrow escapes, and now I'm in for it, as you can see\nby tonight's 'success' as Clara calls it. Thank heaven I haven't many\ndaughters to look after!\"\n\n\"Come, come, don't be anxious take Archie and settle it right up safely\nand happily. That's my advice, and you'll find it sound,\" replied the\nelder conspirator, like one having experience.\n\n\"I'll think of it, but mind you, Mac, not a word of this to the sisters.\nWe are a couple of old fools to be matchmaking so soon but I see what is\nbefore me and it's a comfort to free my mind to someone.\"\n\n\"So it is. Depend on me not a breath even to Jane,\" answered Uncle Mac,\nwith a hearty shake and a sympathetic slap on the shoulder.\n\n\"Why, what dark and awful secrets are going on here? Is it a Freemason's\nLodge and those the mystic signs?\" asked a gay voice at the door; and\nthere stood Rose, full of smiling wonder at the sight of her two uncles\nhand in hand, whispering and nodding to one another mysteriously.\n\nThey stared like schoolboys caught plotting mischief and looked so\nguilty that she took pity on them, innocently imagining the brothers\nwere indulging in a little sentiment on this joyful occasion, so she\nadded quickly, as she beckoned, without crossing the threshold, \"Women\nnot allowed, of course, but both of you dear Odd Fellows are wanted, for\nAunt Plenty begs we will have an old-fashioned contra dance, and I'm to\nlead off with Uncle Mac. I chose you, sir, because you do it in style,\npigeon wings and all. So, please come and Phebe is waiting for you,\nUncle Alec. She is rather shy you know, but will enjoy it with you to\ntake care of her.\"\n\n\"Thank you, thank you!\" cried both gentlemen, following with great\nalacrity.\n\nUnconscious, Rose enjoyed that Virginia reel immensely, for the\npigeon wings were superb, and her partner conducted her through the\nconvolutions of the dance without a fault, going down the middle in his\nmost gallant style. Landing safely at the bottom, she stood aside to let\nhim get his breath, for stout Uncle Mac was bound to do or die on that\noccasion and would have danced his pumps through without a murmur if she\nhad desired it.\n\nLeaning against the wall with his hair in his eyes, and a decidedly\nbored expression of countenance, was Mac, Jr., who had been surveying\nthe gymnastics of his parent with respectful astonishment.\n\n\"Come and take a turn, my lad. Rose is fresh as a daisy, but we old\nfellows soon get enough of it, so you shall have my place,\" said his\nfather, wiping his face, which glowed like a cheerful peony.\n\n\"No, thank you, sir I can't stand that sort of thing. I'll race you\nround the piazza with pleasure, Cousin, but his oven is too much for\nme,\" was Mac's uncivil reply as he backed toward the open window, as if\nglad of an excuse to escape.\n\n\"Fragile creature, don't stay on my account, I beg. I can't leave my\nguests for a moonlight run, even if I dared to take it on a frosty night\nin a thin dress,\" said Rose, fanning herself and not a bit ruffled by\nMac's refusal, for she knew his ways and they amused her.\n\n\"Not half so bad as all this dust, gas, heat, and noise. What do you\nsuppose lungs are made of?\" demanded Mac, ready for a discussion then\nand there.\n\n\"I used to know, but I've forgotten now. Been so busy with other things\nthat I've neglected the hobbies I used to ride five or six years ago,\"\nshe said, laughing.\n\n\"Ah, those were times worth having! Are you going in for much of\nthis sort of thing, Rose?\" he asked with a disapproving glance at the\ndancers.\n\n\"About three months of it, I think.\"\n\n\"Then good-bye till New Year.\" And Mac vanished behind the curtains.\n\n\"Rose, my dear, you really must take that fellow in hand before he gets\nto be quite a bear. Since you have been gone he has lived in his books\nand got on so finely that we have let him alone, though his mother\ngroans over his manners. Polish him up a bit, I beg of you, for it is\nhigh time he mended his odd ways and did justice to the fine gifts he\nhides behind them,\" said Uncle Mac, scandalized at the bluntness of his\nson.\n\n\"I know my chestnut burr too well to mind his prickles. But others do\nnot, so I will take him in hand and make him a credit to his family,\"\nanswered Rose readily.\n\n\"Take Archie for your model he's one of a thousand, and the girl who\ngets him gets a prize, I do assure you,\" added Uncle Mac, who found\nmatchmaking to his taste and thought that closing remark a deep one.\n\n\"Oh, me, how tired I am!\" cried Rose, dropping into a chair as the last\ncarriage rolled away somewhere between one and two.\n\n\"What is your opinion now, Miss Campbell?\" asked the doctor, addressing\nher for the first time by the name which had been uttered so often that\nnight.\n\n\"My opinion is that Miss Campbell is likely to have a gay life if she\ngoes on as she has begun, and that she finds it very delightful so far,\"\nanswered the girl, with lips still smiling from their first taste of\nwhat the world calls pleasure.\n\n\n\n\nChapter 4 THORNS AMONG THE ROSES\n\nFor a time everything went smoothly, and Rose was a happy girl. The\nworld seemed a beautiful and friendly place, and fulfillment of her\nbrightest dreams appeared to be a possibility. Of course this could not\nlast, and disappointment was inevitable, because young eyes look for a\nParadise and weep when they find a workaday world which seems full of\ncare and trouble till one learns to gladden and glorify it with high\nthoughts and holy living.\n\nThose who loved her waited anxiously for the disillusion which must come\nin spite of all their cherishing, for till now Rose had been so busy\nwith her studies, travels, and home duties that she knew very little\nof the triumphs, trials, and temptations of fashionable life. Birth and\nfortune placed her where she could not well escape some of them, and Dr.\nAlec, knowing that experience is the best teacher, wisely left her to\nlearn this lesson as she must many another, devoutly hoping that it\nwould not be a hard one.\n\nOctober and November passed rapidly, and Christmas was at hand, with all\nits merry mysteries, home gatherings, and good wishes.\n\nRose sat in her own little sanctum, opening from the parlor, busily\npreparing gifts for the dear five hundred friends who seemed to grow\nfonder and fonder as the holidays drew near. The drawers of her commode\nstood open, giving glimpses of dainty trifles, which she was tying up\nwith bright ribbons.\n\nA young girl's face at such moments is apt to be a happy one, but Rose's\nwas very grave as she worked, and now and then she threw a parcel into\nthe drawer with a careless toss, as if no love made the gift precious.\nSo unusual was this expression that it struck Dr. Alec as he came in\nand brought an anxious look to his eyes, for any cloud on that other\ncountenance dropped its shadow over his.\n\n\"Can you spare a minute from your pretty work to take a stitch in my old\nglove?\" he asked, coming up to the table strewn with ribbon, lace, and\ncolored papers.\n\n\"Yes, Uncle, as many as you please.\"\n\nThe face brightened with sudden sunshine; both hands were put out\nto receive the shabby driving glove, and the voice was full of that\naffectionate alacrity which makes the smallest service sweet.\n\n\"My Lady Bountiful is hard at work, I see. Can I help in any way?\" he\nasked, glancing at the display before him.\n\n\"No, thank you, unless you can make me as full of interest and pleasure\nin these things as I used to be. Don't you think preparing presents a\ngreat bore, except for those you love and who love you?\" she added in a\ntone which had a slight tremor in it as she uttered the last words.\n\n\"I don't give to people whom I care nothing for. Can't do it, especially\nat Christmas, when goodwill should go into everything one does. If all\nthese 'pretties' are for dear friends, you must have a great many.\"\n\n\"I thought they were friends, but I find many of them are not, and\nthat's the trouble, sir.\"\n\n\"Tell me all about it, dear, and let the old glove go,\" he said, sitting\ndown beside her with his most sympathetic air.\n\nBut she held the glove fast, saying eagerly, \"No, no, I love to do\nthis! I don't feel as if I could look at you while I tell what a bad,\nsuspicious girl I am,\" she added, keeping her eyes on her work.\n\n\"Very well, I'm ready for confessions of any iniquity and glad to get\nthem, for sometimes lately I've seen a cloud in my girl's eyes and\ncaught a worried tone in her voice. Is there a bitter drop in the cup\nthat promised to be so sweet, Rose?\"\n\n\"Yes, Uncle. I've tried to think there was not, but it is there, and I\ndon't like it. I'm ashamed to tell, and yet I want to, because you will\nshow me how to make it sweet or assure me that I shall be the better for\nit, as you used to do when I took medicine.\"\n\nShe paused a minute, sewing swiftly; then out came the trouble all in\none burst of girlish grief and chagrin.\n\n\"Uncle, half the people who are so kind to me don't care a bit for me,\nbut for what I can give them, and that makes me unhappy, because I was\nso glad and proud to be liked. I do wish I hadn't a penny in the world,\nthen I should know who my true friends were.\"\n\n\"Poor little lass! She has found out that all that glitters is not\ngold, and the disillusion has begun,\" said the doctor to himself, adding\naloud, smiling yet pitiful, \"And so all the pleasure is gone out of the\npretty gifts and Christmas is a failure?\"\n\n\"Oh, no not for those whom nothing can make me doubt! It is sweeter than\never to make these things, because my heart is in every stitch and I\nknow that, poor as they are, they will be dear to you, Aunty Plen, Aunt\nJessie, Phebe, and the boys.\"\n\nShe opened a drawer where lay a pile of pretty gifts, wrought with\nloving care by her own hands, touching them tenderly as she spoke and\npatting the sailor's knot of blue ribbon on one fat parcel with a smile\nthat told how unshakable her faith in someone was. \"But these,\" she\nsaid, pulling open another drawer and tossing over its gay contents with\nan air half sad, half scornful, \"these I bought and give because they\nare expected. These people care only for a rich gift, not one bit for\nthe giver, whom they will secretly abuse if she is not as generous as\nthey expect. How can I enjoy that sort of thing, Uncle?\"\n\n\"You cannot, but perhaps you do some of them injustice, my dear. Don't\nlet the envy or selfishness of a few poison your faith in all. Are you\nsure that none of these girls care for you?\" he asked, reading a name\nhere and there on the parcels scattered about.\n\n\"I'm afraid I am. You see I heard several talking together the other\nevening at Annabel's, only a few words, but it hurt me very much, for\nnearly everyone was speculating on what I would give them and hoping it\nwould be something fine. 'She's so rich she ought to be generous,' said\none. 'I've been perfectly devoted to her for weeks and hope she won't\nforget it,' said another. 'If she doesn't give me some of her gloves, I\nshall think she's very mean, for she has heaps, and I tried on a pair in\nfun so she could see they fitted and take a hint,' added a third. I did\ntake the hint, you see.\" And Rose opened a handsome box in which lay\nseveral pairs of her best gloves, with buttons enough to satisfy the\nheart of the most covetous.\n\n\"Plenty of silver paper and perfume, but not much love went into that\nbundle, I fancy?\" And Dr. Alec could not help smiling at the disdainful\nlittle gesture with which Rose pushed away the box.\n\n\"Not a particle, nor in most of these. I have given them what they\nwanted and taken back the confidence and respect they didn't care for.\nIt is wrong, I know, but I can't bear to think all the seeming goodwill\nand friendliness I've been enjoying was insincere and for a purpose.\nThat's not the way I treat people.\"\n\n\"I am sure of it. Take things for what they are worth, dear, and try to\nfind the wheat among the tares, for there is plenty if one knows how to\nlook. Is that all the trouble?\"\n\n\"No, sir, that is the lightest part of it. I shall soon get over my\ndisappointment in those girls and take them for what they are worth as\nyou advise, but being deceived in them makes me suspicious of others,\nand that is hateful. If I cannot trust people I'd rather keep by myself\nand be happy. I do detest maneuvering and underhanded plots and plans!\"\n\nRose spoke petulantly and twitched her silk till it broke, while regret\nseemed to give place to anger as she spoke.\n\n\"There is evidently another thorn pricking. Let us have it out, and\nthen I'll kiss the place to make it well as I used to do when I took the\nsplinters from the fingers you are pricking so unmercifully,\" said the\ndoctor, anxious to relieve his pet patient as soon as possible.\n\nRose laughed, but the color deepened in her cheeks as she answered with\na pretty mixture of maidenly shyness and natural candor.\n\n\"Aunt Clara worries me by warning me against half the young men I meet\nand insisting that they want only my money. Now that is dreadful, and\nI won't listen, but I can't help thinking of it sometimes, for they\nare very kind to me and I'm not vain enough to think it is my beauty. I\nsuppose I am foolish, but I do like to feel that I am something besides\nan heiress.\"\n\nThe little quiver was in Rose's voice again as she ended, and Dr. Alec\ngave a quick sigh as he looked at the downcast face so full of the\nperplexity ingenuous spirits feel when doubt first mars their faith\nand dims the innocent beliefs still left from childhood. He had been\nexpecting this and knew that what the girl just began to perceive and\ntry modestly to tell had long ago been plain to worldlier eyes. The\nheiress was the attraction to most of the young men whom she met. Good\nfellows enough, but educated, as nearly all are nowadays, to believe\nthat girls with beauty or money are brought to market to sell or buy as\nthe case may be.\n\nRose could purchase anything she liked, as she combined both advantages,\nand was soon surrounded by many admirers, each striving to secure the\nprize. Not being trained to believe that the only end and aim of a\nwoman's life was a good match, she was a little disturbed, when the\nfirst pleasing excitement was over, to discover that her fortune was her\nchief attraction.\n\nIt was impossible for her to help seeing, hearing, guessing this from a\nsignificant glance, a stray word, a slight hint here and there, and\nthe quick instinct of a woman felt even before it understood the\nself-interest which chilled for her so many opening friendships. In her\neyes love was a very sacred thing, hardly to be thought of till it came,\nreverently received and cherished faithfully to the end. Therefore, it\nis not strange that she shrank from hearing it flippantly discussed and\nmarriage treated as a bargain to be haggled over, with little thought\nof its high duties, great responsibilities, and tender joys. Many\nthings perplexed her, and sometimes a doubt of all that till now she had\nbelieved and trusted made her feel as if at sea without a compass,\nfor the new world was so unlike the one she had been living in that it\nbewildered while it charmed the novice.\n\nDr. Alec understood the mood in which he found her and did his best to\nwarn without saddening by too much worldly wisdom.\n\n\"You are something besides an heiress to those who know and love you, so\ntake heart, my girl, and hold fast to the faith that is in you. There\nis a touchstone for all these things, and whatever does not ring true,\ndoubt and avoid. Test and try men and women as they come along, and I\nam sure conscience, instinct, and experience will keep you from any dire\nmistake,\" he said, with a protecting arm about her and a trustful look\nthat was very comforting.\n\nAfter a moment's pause she answered, while a sudden smile dimpled around\nher mouth and the big glove went up to hide her telltale cheeks: \"Uncle,\nif I must have lovers, I do wish they'd be more interesting. How can I\nlike or respect men who go on as some of them do and then imagine women\ncan feel honored by the offer of their hands? Hearts are out of fashion,\nso they don't say much about them.\"\n\n\"Ah, ha! That is the trouble, is it? And we begin to have delicate\ndistresses, do we?\" said Dr. Alec, glad to see her brightening and full\nof interest in the new topic, for he was a romantic old fellow, as he\nhad confessed to his brother.\n\nRose put down the glove and looked up with a droll mixture of amusement\nand disgust in her face. \"Uncle, it is perfectly disgraceful! I've\nwanted to tell you, but I was ashamed, because I never could boast of\nsuch things as some girls do, and they were so absurd I couldn't feel as\nif they were worth repeating even to you. Perhaps I ought, though,\nfor you may think it proper to command me to make a good match, and of\ncourse I should have to obey,\" she added, trying to look meek.\n\n\"Tell, by all means. Don't I always keep your secrets and give you the\nbest advice, like a model guardian? You must have a confidant, and where\nfind a better one than here?\" he asked, tapping his waistcoat with an\ninviting gesture.\n\n\"Nowhere so I'll tell all but the names. I'd best be prudent, for I'm\nafraid you may get a little fierce you do sometimes when people vex\nme,\" began Rose, rather liking the prospect of a confidential chat with\nUncle, for he had kept himself a good deal in the background lately.\n\n\"You know our ideas are old-fashioned, so I was not prepared to have\nmen propose at all times and places with no warning but a few smiles and\nsoft speeches. I expected things of that sort would be very interesting\nand proper, not to say thrilling, on my part but they are not, and I\nfind myself laughing instead of crying, feeling angry instead of glad,\nand forgetting all about it very soon. Why, Uncle, one absurd boy\nproposed when we'd met only half a dozen times. But he was dreadfully in\ndebt, so that accounted for it perhaps.\" And Rose dusted her fingers, as\nif she had soiled them.\n\n\"I know him, and I thought he'd do it,\" observed the doctor with a\nshrug.\n\n\"You see and know everything, so there's no need of going on, is there?\"\n\n\"Do, do! Who else? I won't even guess.\"\n\n\"Well, another went down upon his knees in Mrs. Van's greenhouse and\npoured forth his passion manfully, with a great cactus pricking his poor\nlegs all the while. Kitty found him there, and it was impossible to keep\nsober, so he has hated me ever since.\"\n\nThe doctor's \"Ha! Ha!\" was good to hear, and Rose joined him, for it was\nimpossible to regard these episodes seriously, since no true sentiment\nredeemed them from absurdity.\n\n\"Another sent me reams of poetry and went on so Byronically that I\nbegan to wish I had red hair and my name was Betsy Ann. I burnt all the\nverses, so don't expect to see them, and he, poor fellow, is consoling\nhimself with Emma. But the worst of all was the one who would make love\nin public and insisted on proposing in the middle of a dance. I seldom\ndance round dances except with our boys, but that night I did because\nthe girls laughed at me for being so 'prudish,' as they called it. I\ndon't mind them now, for I found I was right, and felt that I deserved\nmy fate.\"\n\n\"Is that all?\" asked her uncle, looking \"fierce,\" as she predicted,\nat the idea of his beloved girl obliged to listen to a declaration,\ntwirling on the arm of a lover.\n\n\"One more but him I shall not tell about, for I know he was in earnest\nand really suffered, though I was as kind as I knew how to be. I'm young\nin these things yet, so I grieved for him, and treat his love with the\ntenderest respect.\"\n\nRose's voice sank almost to a whisper as she ended, and Dr. Alec bent\nhis head, as if involuntarily saluting a comrade in misfortune. Then\nhe got up, saying with a keen look into the face he lifted by a finger\nunder the chin: \"Do you want another three months of this?\"\n\n\"I'll tell you on New Year's Day, Uncle.\"\n\n\"Very well. Try to keep a straight course, my little captain, and if you\nsee dirty weather ahead, call on your first mate.\"\n\n\"Aye, aye, sir. I'll remember.\"\n\n\n\n\nChapter 5 PRINCE CHARMING\n\nThe old glove lay upon the floor forgotten while Rose sat musing, till a\nquick step sounded in the hall and a voice drew near, tunefully humming.\n\n    \"As he was walkin' doun the street\n    The city for to view,\n    Oh, there he spied a bonny lass,\n    The window lookin' through.\"\n\n    \"Sae licht he jump\u00c3\u00a8d up the stair,\n    And tirled at the pin;\n    Oh, wha sae ready as hersel'\n    To let the laddie in?\"\n\nsang Rose as the voice paused and a tap came at the door.\n\n\"Good morning, Rosamunda, here are your letters, and your most devoted\nready to execute any commissions you may have for him,\" was Charlie's\ngreeting as he came in looking comely, gay, and debonair as usual.\n\n\"Thanks. I've no errands unless you mail my replies, if these need\nanswering, so by your leave, Prince,\" and Rose began to open the handful\nof notes he threw into her lap.\n\n\"Ha! What sight is this to blast mine eyes?\" ejaculated Charlie, as\nhe pointed to the glove with a melodramatic start, for, like most\naccomplished amateur actors, he was fond of introducing private\ntheatricals into his daily talk and conversation.\n\n\"Uncle left it.\"\n\n\"'Tis well. Methought perchance a rival had been here,\" and, picking\nit up, Charlie amused himself with putting it on the head of a little\nPsyche which ornamented the mantelpiece, softly singing as he did so,\nanother verse of the old song:\n\n    \"He set his Jenny on his knee,\n    All in his Highland dress;\n    For brawly well he kenned the way\n    To please a bonny lass.\"\n\nRose went on reading her letters, but all the while was thinking of her\nconversation with her uncle as well as something else suggested by the\nnewcomer and his ditty.\n\nDuring the three months since her return she had seen more of this\ncousin than any of the others, for he seemed to be the only one who had\nleisure to \"play with Rose,\" as they used to say years ago. The other\nboys were all at work, even little Jamie, many of whose play hours were\ndevoted to manful struggles with Latin grammar, the evil genius of\nhis boyish life. Dr. Alec had many affairs to arrange after his long\nabsence; Phebe was busy with her music; and Aunt Plenty still actively\nsuperintended her housekeeping. Thus it fell out, quite naturally, that\nCharlie should form the habit of lounging in at all hours with letters,\nmessages, bits of news, and agreeable plans for Rose. He helped her with\nher sketching, rode with her, sang with her, and took her to parties\nas a matter of course, for Aunt Clara, being the gaiest of the sisters,\nplayed chaperon on all occasions.\n\nFor a time it was very pleasant, but, by and by, Rose began to wish\nCharlie would find something to do like the rest and not make dawdling\nafter her the business of his life. The family was used to his\nself-indulgent ways, and there was an amiable delusion in the minds of\nthe boys that he had a right to the best of everything, for to them\nhe was still the Prince, the flower of the flock, and in time to be an\nhonor to the name. No one exactly knew how, for, though full of talent,\nhe seemed to have no especial gift or bias, and the elders began to\nshake their heads because, in spite of many grand promises and projects,\nthe moment for decisive action never came.\n\nRose saw all this and longed to inspire her brilliant cousin with some\nmanful purpose which should win for him respect as well as admiration.\nBut she found it very hard, for though he listened with imperturbable\ngood humor, and owned his shortcomings with delightful frankness, he\nalways had some argument, reason, or excuse to offer and out-talked her\nin five minutes, leaving her silenced but unconvinced.\n\nOf late she had observed that he seemed to feel as if her time and\nthoughts belonged exclusively to him and rather resented the approach\nof any other claimant. This annoyed her and suggested the idea that\nher affectionate interest and efforts were misunderstood by him,\nmisrepresented and taken advantage of by Aunt Clara, who had been most\nurgent that she should \"use her influence with the dear boy,\" though the\nfond mother resented all other interference. This troubled Rose and made\nher feel as if caught in a snare, for, while she owned to herself that\nCharlie was the most attractive of her cousins, she was not ready to be\ntaken possession of in this masterful way, especially since other and\nsometimes better men sought her favor more humbly.\n\nThese thoughts were floating vaguely in her mind as she read her letters\nand unconsciously influenced her in the chat that followed.\n\n\"Only invitations, and I can't stop to answer them now or I shall never\nget through this job,\" she said, returning to her work.\n\n\"Let me help. You do up, and I'll direct. Have a secretary, do now, and\nsee what a comfort it will be,\" proposed Charlie, who could turn his\nhand to anything and had made himself quite at home in the sanctum.\n\n\"I'd rather finish this myself, but you may answer the notes if you\nwill. Just regrets to all but two or three. Read the names as you go\nalong and I'll tell you which.\"\n\n\"To hear is to obey. Who says I'm a 'frivolous idler' now?\" And Charlie\nsat down at the writing table with alacrity, for these hours in the\nlittle room were his best and happiest.\n\n\"Order is heaven's first law, and the view a lovely one, but I don't see\nany notepaper,\" he added, opening the desk and surveying its contents\nwith interest.\n\n\"Right-hand drawer violet monogram for the notes, plain paper for the\nbusiness letter. I'll see to that, though,\" answered Rose, trying to\ndecide whether Annabel or Emma should have the laced handkerchief.\n\n\"Confiding creature! Suppose I open the wrong drawer and come upon the\ntender secrets of your soul?\" continued the new secretary, rummaging out\nthe delicate notepaper with masculine disregard of order.\n\n\"I haven't got any,\" answered Rose demurely.\n\n\"What, not one despairing scrawl, one cherished miniature, one faded\nfloweret, etc., etc.? I can't believe it, Cousin,\" and he shook his head\nincredulously.\n\n\"If I had, I certainly should not show them to you, impertinent\nperson! There are a few little souvenirs in that desk, but nothing very\nsentimental or interesting.\"\n\n\"How I'd like to see 'em! But I should never dare to ask,\" observed\nCharlie, peering over the top of the half-open lid with a most\npersuasive pair of eyes.\n\n\"You may if you want to, but you'll be disappointed, Paul Pry. Lower\nleft-hand drawer with the key in it.\"\n\n\"'Angel of goodness, how shall I requite thee? Interesting moment, with\nwhat palpitating emotions art thou fraught!'\" And, quoting from the\n\"Mysteries of Udolpho,\" he unlocked and opened the drawer with a tragic\ngesture.\n\n\"Seven locks of hair in a box, all light, for 'here's your straw color,\nyour orange tawny, your French crown color, and your perfect yellow'\nShakespeare. They look very familiar, and I fancy I know the heads they\nthatched.\"\n\n\"Yes, you all gave me one when I went away, you know, and I carried them\nround the world with me in that very box.\"\n\n\"I wish the heads had gone too. Here's a jolly little amber god with\na gold ring in his back and a most balmy breath,\" continued Charlie,\ntaking a long sniff at the scent bottle.\n\n\"Uncle brought me that long ago, and I'm very fond of it.\"\n\n\"This now looks suspicious man's ring with a lotus cut on the stone and\na note attached. I tremble as I ask, who, when, and where?\"\n\n\"A gentleman, on my birthday, in Calcutta.\"\n\n\"I breathe again it was my sire?\"\n\n\"Don't be absurd. Of course it was, and he did everything to make my\nvisit pleasant. I wish you'd go and see him like a dutiful son, instead\nof idling here.\"\n\n\"That's what Uncle Mac is eternally telling me, but I don't intend to\nbe lectured into the treadmill till I've had my fling first,\" muttered\nCharlie rebelliously.\n\n\"If you fling yourself in the wrong direction, you may find it hard to\nget back again,\" began Rose gravely.\n\n\"No fear, if you look after me as you seem to have promised to do,\njudging by the thanks you get in this note. Poor old governor! I should\nlike to see him, for it's almost four years since he came home last and\nhe must be getting on.\"\n\nCharlie was the only one of the boys who ever called his father\n\"governor,\" perhaps because the others knew and loved their fathers,\nwhile he had seen so little of his that the less respectful name came\nmore readily to his lips, since the elder man in truth seemed a governor\nissuing requests or commands, which the younger too often neglected or\nresented.\n\nLong ago Rose had discovered that Uncle Stephen found home made so\ndistasteful by his wife's devotion to society that he preferred to exile\nhimself, taking business as an excuse for his protracted absences.\n\nThe girl was thinking of this as she watched her cousin turn the ring\nabout with a sudden sobriety which became him well; and, believing that\nthe moment was propitious, she said earnestly: \"He is getting on. Dear\nCharlie, do think of duty more than pleasure in this case and I'm sure\nyou never will regret it.\"\n\n\"Do you want me to go?\" he asked quickly.\n\n\"I think you ought.\"\n\n\"And I think you'd be much more charming if you wouldn't always be\nworrying about right and wrong! Uncle Alec taught you that along with\nthe rest of his queer notions.\"\n\n\"I'm glad he did!\" cried Rose warmly, then checked herself and said with\na patient sort of sigh, \"You know women always want the men they care\nfor to be good and can't help trying to make them so.\"\n\n\"So they do, and we ought to be a set of angels, but I've a strong\nconviction that, if we were, the dear souls wouldn't like us half as\nwell. Would they now?\" asked Charlie with an insinuating smile.\n\n\"Perhaps not, but that is dodging the point. Will you go?\" persisted\nRose unwisely.\n\n\"No, I will not.\"\n\nThat was sufficiently decided and an uncomfortable pause followed,\nduring which Rose tied a knot unnecessarily tight and Charlie went on\nexploring the drawer with more energy than interest.\n\n\"Why, here's an old thing I gave you ages ago!\" he suddenly exclaimed in\na pleased tone, holding up a little agate heart on a faded blue ribbon.\n\"Will you let me take away the heart of stone and give you a heart of\nflesh?\" he asked, half in earnest, half in jest, touched by the little\ntrinket and the recollections it awakened.\n\n\"No, I will not,\" answered Rose bluntly, much displeased by the\nirreverent and audacious question.\n\nCharlie looked rather abashed for a moment, but his natural\nlightheartedness made it easy for him to get the better of his own\nbrief fits of waywardness and put others in good humor with him and\nthemselves.\n\n\"Now we are even let's drop the subject and start afresh,\" he said with\nirresistible affability as he coolly put the little heart in his pocket\nand prepared to shut the drawer. But something caught his eye, and\nexclaiming, \"What's this? What's this?\" he snatched up a photograph\nwhich lay half under a pile of letters with foreign postmarks.\n\n\"Oh! I forgot that was there,\" said Rose hastily.\n\n\"Who is the man?\" demanded Charlie, eyeing the good-looking countenance\nbefore him with a frown.\n\n\"That is the Honorable Gilbert Murray, who went up the Nile with us and\nshot crocodiles and other small game, being a mighty hunter, as I told\nyou in my letters,\" answered Rose gaily, though ill pleased at the\nlittle discovery just then, for this had been one of the narrow escapes\nher uncle spoke of.\n\n\"And they haven't eaten him yet, I infer from the pile of letters?\" said\nCharlie jealously.\n\n\"I hope not. His sister did not mention it when she wrote last.\"\n\n\"Ah! Then she is your correspondent? Sisters are dangerous things\nsometimes.\" And Charlie eyed the packet suspiciously.\n\n\"In this case, a very convenient thing, for she tells me all about her\nbrother's wedding, as no one else would take the trouble to do.\"\n\n\"Oh! Well, if he's married, I don't care a straw about him. I fancied\nI'd found out why you are such a hard-hearted charmer. But if there is\nno secret idol, I'm all at sea again.\" And Charlie tossed the photograph\ninto the drawer as if it no longer interested him.\n\n\"I'm hard-hearted because I'm particular and, as yet, do not find anyone\nat all to my taste.\"\n\n\"No one?\" with a tender glance.\n\n\"No one\" with a rebellious blush, and the truthful addition \"I see\nmuch to admire and like in many persons, but none quite strong and good\nenough to suit me. My heroes are old-fashioned, you know.\"\n\n\"Prigs, like Guy Carleton, Count Altenberg, and John Halifax I know the\npattern you goody girls like,\" sneered Charlie, who preferred the Guy\nLivingston, Beauclerc, and Rochester style.\n\n\"Then I'm not a 'goody girl,' for I don't like prigs. I want a gentleman\nin the best sense of the word, and I can wait, for I've seen one, and\nknow there are more in the world.\"\n\n\"The deuce you have! Do I know him?\" asked Charlie, much alarmed.\n\n\"You think you do,\" answered Rose with a mischievous sparkle in her eye.\n\n\"If it isn't Pem, I give it up. He's the best-bred fellow I know.\"\n\n\"Oh, dear, no! Far superior to Mr. Pemberton and many years older,\"\nsaid Rose, with so much respect that Charlie looked perplexed as well as\nanxious.\n\n\"Some apostolic minister, I fancy. You pious creatures always like to\nadore a parson. But all we know are married.\"\n\n\"He isn't.\"\n\n\"Give a name, for pity's sake I'm suffering tortures of suspense,\"\nbegged Charlie.\n\n\"Alexander Campbell.\"\n\n\"Uncle? Well, upon my word, that's a relief, but mighty absurd all the\nsame. So, when you find a young saint of that sort, you intend to marry\nhim, do you?\" demanded Charlie much amused and rather disappointed.\n\n\"When I find any man half as honest, good, and noble as Uncle, I shall\nbe proud to marry him if he asks me,\" answered Rose decidedly.\n\n\"What odd tastes women have!\" And Charlie leaned his chin on his hand\nto muse pensively for a moment over the blindness of one woman who could\nadmire an excellent old uncle more than a dashing young cousin.\n\nRose, meanwhile, tied up her parcels industriously, hoping she had not\nbeen too severe, for it was very hard to lecture Charlie, though he\nseemed to like it sometimes and came to confession voluntarily, knowing\nthat women love to forgive when the sinners are of his sort.\n\n\"It will be mail time before you are done,\" she said presently, for\nsilence was less pleasant than his rattle.\n\nCharlie took the hint and dashed off several notes in his best manner.\nComing to the business letter, he glanced at it and asked, with a\npuzzled expression: \"What is all this? Cost of repairs, etc., from a man\nnamed Buffum?\"\n\n\"Never mind that I'll see to it by and by.\"\n\n\"But I do mind, for I'm interested in all your affairs, and though you\nthink I've no head for business, you'll find I have if you'll try me.\"\n\n\"This is only about my two old houses in the city, which are being\nrepaired and altered so that the rooms can be let singly.\"\n\n\"Going to make tenement houses of them? Well, that's not a bad idea such\nplaces pay well, I've heard.\"\n\n\"That is just what I'm not going to do. I wouldn't have a tenement house\non my conscience for a million dollars not as they are now,\" said Rose\ndecidedly.\n\n\"Why, what do you know about it, except that people live in them and the\nowners turn a pretty penny on the rents?\"\n\n\"I know a good deal about them, for I've seen many such, both here\nand abroad. It was not all pleasure with us, I assure you. Uncle was\ninterested in hospitals and prisons, and I sometimes went with him, but\nthey made me sad so he suggested other charities that I could be of\nhelp about when we came home. I visited infant schools, working women's\nhomes, orphan asylums, and places of that sort. You don't know how much\ngood it did me and how glad I am that I have the means of lightening a\nlittle some of the misery in the world.\"\n\n\"But, my dear girl, you needn't make ducks and drakes of your fortune\ntrying to feed and cure and clothe all the poor wretches you see. Give,\nof course everyone should do something in that line and no one likes it\nbetter than I. But don't, for mercy's sake, go at it as some women do\nand get so desperately earnest, practical, and charity-mad that there is\nno living in peace with you,\" protested Charlie, looking alarmed at the\nprospect.\n\n\"You can do as you please. I intend to do all the good I can by asking\nthe advice and following the example of the most 'earnest,' 'practical,'\nand 'charitable' people I know so, if you don't approve, you can drop\nmy acquaintance,\" answered Rose, emphasizing the obnoxious words and\nassuming the resolute air she always wore when defending her hobbies.\n\n\"You'll be laughed at.\"\n\n\"I'm used to that.\"\n\n\"And criticized and shunned.\"\n\n\"Not by people whose opinion I value.\"\n\n\"Women shouldn't go poking into such places.\"\n\n\"I've been taught that they should.\"\n\n\"Well, you'll get some dreadful disease and lose your beauty, and then\nwhere are you?\" added Charlie, thinking that might daunt the young\nphilanthropist.\n\nBut it did not, for Rose answered, with a sudden kindling of the eyes as\nshe remembered her talk with Uncle Alec: \"I shouldn't like it. But there\nwould be one satisfaction in it, for when I'd lost my beauty and given\naway my money, I should know who really cared for me.\"\n\nCharlie nibbled his pen in silence for a moment, then asked, meekly,\n\"Could I respectfully inquire what great reform is to be carried on in\nthe old houses which their amiable owner is repairing?\"\n\n\"I am merely going to make them comfortable homes for poor but\nrespectable women to live in. There is a class who cannot afford to\npay much, yet suffer a great deal from being obliged to stay in noisy,\ndirty, crowded places like tenement houses and cheap lodgings. I can\nhelp a few of them and I'm going to try.\"\n\n\"May I humbly ask if these decayed gentlewomen are to inhabit their\npalatial retreat rent-free?\"\n\n\"That was my first plan, but Uncle showed me that it was wiser not\nmake genteel paupers of them, but let them pay a small rent and feel\nindependent. I don't want the money, of course, and shall use it in\nkeeping the houses tidy or helping other women in like case,\" said Rose,\nentirely ignoring her cousin's covert ridicule.\n\n\"Don't expect any gratitude, for you won't get it; nor much comfort with\na lot of forlornities on your hands, and be sure that when it is too\nlate you will tire of it all and wish you had done as other people do.\"\n\n\"Thanks for your cheerful prophecies, but I think I'll venture.\"\n\nShe looked so undaunted that Charlie was a little nettled and fired his\nlast shot rather recklessly: \"Well, one thing I do know you'll never get\na husband if you go on in this absurd way, and by Jove! you need one to\ntake care of you and keep the property together!\"\n\nRose had a temper, but seldom let it get the better of her; now,\nhowever, it flashed up for a moment. Those last words were peculiarly\nunfortunate, because Aunt Clara had used them more than once when\nwarning her against impecunious suitors and generous projects. She was\ndisappointed in her cousin, annoyed at having her little plans laughed\nat, and indignant with him for his final suggestion.\n\n\"I'll never have one, if I must give up the liberty of doing what I know\nis right, and I'd rather go into the poorhouse tomorrow than 'keep the\nproperty together' in the selfish way you mean!\"\n\nThat was all but Charlie saw that he had gone too far and hastened to\nmake his peace with the skill of a lover, for, turning to the little\ncabinet piano behind him, he sang in his best style the sweet old song:\n\n    \"Oh were thou in the cauld blast,\"\n\ndwelling with great effect, not only upon the tender assurance that \"My\nplaid should shelter thee,\"\n\nbut also that, even if a king,\n\n    \"The brightest jewel in my crown\n    Wad be my queen, wad be my queen.\"\n\nIt was very evident that Prince Charming had not gone troubadouring\nin vain, for Orpheus himself could not have restored harmony more\nsuccessfully. The tuneful apology was accepted with a forgiving smile\nand a frank \"I'm sorry I was cross, but you haven't forgotten how to\ntease, and I'm rather out of sorts today. Late hours don't agree with\nme.\"\n\n\"Then you won't feel like going to Mrs. Hope's tomorrow, I'm afraid,\"\nand Charlie took up the last note with an expression of regret which was\nvery flattering.\n\n\"I must go, because it is made for me, but I can come away early and\nmake up lost sleep. I do hate to be so fractious,\" and Rose rubbed the\nforehead that ached with too much racketing.\n\n\"But the German does not begin till late I'm to lead and depend upon\nyou. Just stay this once to oblige me,\" pleaded Charlie, for he had set\nhis heart on distinguishing himself.\n\n\"No I promised Uncle to be temperate in my pleasures and I must keep my\nword. I'm so well now, it would be very foolish to get ill and make him\nanxious not to mention losing my beauty, as you are good enough to call\nit, for that depends on health, you know.\"\n\n\"But the fun doesn't begin till after supper. Everything will be\ndelightful, I assure you, and we'll have a gay old time as we did last\nweek at Emma's.\"\n\n\"Then I certainly will not, for I'm ashamed of myself when I remember\nwhat a romp that was and how sober Uncle looked as he let me in at three\nin the morning, all fagged out my dress in rags, my head aching, my feet\nso tired that I could hardly stand, and nothing to show for five\nhours' hard work but a pocketful of bonbons, artificial flowers, and\ntissue-paper fool's caps. Uncle said I'd better put one on and go to\nbed, for I looked as though I'd been to a French bal masque. I never\nwant to hear him say so again, and I'll never let dawn catch me out in\nsuch a plight anymore.\"\n\n\"You were all right enough, for mother didn't object and I got you\nboth home before daylight. Uncle is notional about such things, so I\nshouldn't mind, for we had a jolly time and we were none the worse for\nit.\"\n\n\"Indeed we were, every one of us! Aunt Clara hasn't gotten over her cold\nyet. I slept all the next day, and you looked like a ghost, for you'd\nbeen out every night for weeks, I think.\"\n\n\"Oh, nonsense! Everyone does it during the season, and you'll get used\nto the pace very soon,\" began Charlie, bent on making her go, for he\nwas in his element in a ballroom and never happier than when he had his\npretty cousin on his arm.\n\n\"Ah! But I don't want to get used to it, for it costs too much in the\nend. I don't wish to get used to being whisked about a hot room by men\nwho have taken too much wine, to turn day into night, wasting time that\nmight be better spent, and grow into a fashionable fast girl who can't\nget along without excitement. I don't deny that much of it is pleasant,\nbut don't try to make me too fond of gaiety. Help me to resist what I\nknow is hurtful, and please don't laugh me out of the good habits Uncle\nhas tried so hard to give me.\"\n\nRose was quite sincere in her appeal, and Charlie knew she was right,\nbut he always found it hard to give up anything he had set his heart on,\nno matter how trivial, for the maternal indulgence which had harmed the\nboy had fostered the habit of self-indulgence, which was ruining the\nman. So when Rose looked up at him, with a very honest desire to save\nhim as well as herself from being swept into the giddy vortex which\nkeeps so many young people revolving aimlessly, till they go down or\nare cast upon the shore, wrecks of what they might have been, he gave a\nshrug and answered briefly: \"As you please. I'll bring you home as early\nas you like, and Effie Waring shall take your place in the German. What\nflowers shall I send you?\"\n\nNow, that was an artful speech of Charlie's, for Miss Waring was a fast\nand fashionable damsel who openly admired Prince Charming and had given\nhim the name. Rose disliked her and was sure her influence was bad, for\nyouth made frivolity forgivable, wit hid want of refinement, and beauty\nalways covers a multitude of sins in a man's eyes. At the sound of\nEffie's name, Rose wavered, and would have yielded but for the memory\nof the \"first mate's\" last words. She did desire to \"keep a straight\ncourse\"; so, though the current of impulse set strongly in a southerly\ndirection, principle, the only compass worth having, pointed due north,\nand she tried to obey it like a wise young navigator, saying steadily,\nwhile she directed to Annabel the parcel containing a capacious pair of\nslippers intended for Uncle Mac: \"Don't trouble yourself about me. I can\ngo with Uncle and slip away without disturbing anybody.\"\n\n\"I don't believe you'll have the heart to do it,\" said Charlie\nincredulously as he sealed the last note.\n\n\"Wait and see.\"\n\n\"I will, but I shall hope to the last.\" And kissing his hand to her, he\ndeparted to post her letters, quite sure that Miss Waring would not lead\nthe German.\n\nIt certainly looked for a moment as if Miss Campbell would, because she\nran to the door with the words \"I'll go\" upon her lips. But she did not\nopen it till she had stood a minute staring hard at the old glove on\nPsyche's head; then like one who had suddenly gotten a bright idea, she\ngave a decided nod and walked slowly out of the room.\n\n\n\n\nChapter 6 POLISHING MAC\n\n\"Please could I say one word?\" was the question three times repeated\nbefore a rough head bobbed out from the grotto of books in which Mac\nusually sat when he studied.\n\n\"Did anyone speak?\" he asked, blinking in the flood of sunshine that\nentered with Rose.\n\n\"Only three times, thank you. Don't disturb yourself, I beg, for I\nmerely want to say a word,\" answered Rose as she prevented him from\noffering the easy chair in which he sat.\n\n\"I was rather deep in a compound fracture and didn't hear. What can I do\nfor you, Cousin?\" And Mac shoved a stack of pamphlets off the chair near\nhim with a hospitable wave of the hand that sent his papers flying in\nall directions.\n\nRose sat down, but did not seem to find her \"word\" an easy one to\nutter, for she twisted her handkerchief about her fingers in embarrassed\nsilence till Mac put on his glasses and, after a keen look, asked\nsoberly: \"Is it a splinter, a cut, or a whitlow, ma'am?\"\n\n\"It is neither. Do forget your tiresome surgery for a minute and be the\nkindest cousin that ever was,\" answered Rose, beginning rather sharply\nand ending with her most engaging smile.\n\n\"Can't promise in the dark,\" said the wary youth.\n\n\"It is a favor, a great favor, and one I don't choose to ask any of the\nother boys,\" answered the artful damsel.\n\nMac looked pleased and leaned forward, saying more affably, \"Name it,\nand be sure I'll grant it if I can.\"\n\n\"Go with me to Mrs. Hope's party tomorrow night.\"\n\n\"What!\" And Mac recoiled as if she had put a pistol to his head.\n\n\"I've left you in peace a long time, but it is your turn now, so do your\nduty like a man and a cousin.\"\n\n\"But I never go to parties!\" cried the unhappy victim in great dismay.\n\n\"High time you began, sir.\"\n\n\"But I don't dance fit to be seen.\"\n\n\"I'll teach you.\"\n\n\"My dress coat isn't decent, I know.\"\n\n\"Archie will lend you one he isn't going.\"\n\n\"I'm afraid there's a lecture that I ought not to cut.\"\n\n\"No, there isn't I asked Uncle.\"\n\n\"I'm always so tired and dull in the evening.\"\n\n\"This sort of thing is just what you want to rest and freshen up your\nspirits.\"\n\nMac gave a groan and fell back vanquished, for it was evident that\nescape was impossible.\n\n\"What put such a perfectly wild idea into your head?\" he demanded,\nrather roughly, for hitherto he had been left in peace and this sudden\nattack decidedly amazed him.\n\n\"Sheer necessity, but don't do it if it is so very dreadful to you. I\nmust go to several more parties, because they are made for me, but after\nthat I'll refuse, and then no one need be troubled with me.\"\n\nSomething in Rose's voice made Mac answer penitently, even while he knit\nhis brows in perplexity. \"I don't mean to be rude, and of course I'll go\nanywhere if I'm really needed. But I don't understand where the sudden\nnecessity is, with three other fellows at command, all better dancers\nand beaus than I am.\"\n\n\"I don't want them, and I do want you, for I haven't the heart to drag\nUncle out anymore, and you know I never go with any gentleman but those\nof my own family.\"\n\n\"Now look here, Rose if Steve has been doing anything to tease you,\njust mention it and I'll attend to him,\" cried Mac, plainly seeing that\nsomething was amiss and fancying that Dandy was at the bottom of it, as\nhe had done escort duty several times lately.\n\n\"No, Steve has been very good, but I know he had rather be with Kitty\nVan, so of course I feel like a marplot, though he is too polite to hint\nit.\"\n\n\"What a noodle that boy is! But there's Archie he's steady as a church\nand has no sweetheart to interfere,\" continued Mac, bound to get at the\ntruth and half suspecting what it was.\n\n\"He is on his feet all day, and Aunt Jessie wants him in the evening.\nHe does not care for dancing as he used, and I suppose he really does\nprefer to rest and read.\" Rose might have added, \"And hear Phebe sing,\"\nfor Phebe did not go out as much as Rose did, and Aunt Jessie often came\nto sit with the old lady when the young folks were away and, of course,\ndutiful Archie came with her, so willingly of late!\n\n\"What's amiss with Charlie? I thought he was the prince of cavaliers.\nAnnabel says he dances 'like an angel,' and I know a dozen mothers\ncouldn't keep him at home of an evening. Have you had a tiff with Adonis\nand so fall back on poor me?\" asked Mac, coming last to the person of\nwhom he thought first but did not mention, feeling shy about alluding to\na subject often discussed behind her back.\n\n\"Yes, I have, and I don't intend to go with him any more for some time.\nHis ways do not suit me, and mine do not suit him, so I want to be\nquite independent, and you can help me if you will,\" said Rose, rather\nnervously spinning the big globe close by.\n\nMac gave a low whistle, looking wide awake all in a minute as he said\nwith a gesture, as if he brushed a cobweb off his face: \"Now, see here,\nCousin, I'm not good at mysteries and shall only blunder if you put me\nblindfold into any nice maneuver. Just tell me straight out what you\nwant and I'll do it if I can. Play I'm Uncle and free your mind come\nnow.\"\n\nHe spoke so kindly, and the honest eyes were so full of merry goodwill,\nthat Rose thought she might confide in him and answered as frankly as\nhe could desire: \"You are right, Mac, and I don't mind talking to you\nalmost as freely as to Uncle, because you are such a reliable fellow\nand won't think me silly for trying to do what I believe to be right.\nCharlie does, and so makes it hard for me to hold to my resolutions. I\nwant to keep early hours, dress simply, and behave properly no matter\nwhat fashionable people do. You will agree to that, I'm sure, and stand\nby me through thick and thin for principle's sake.\"\n\n\"I will, and begin by showing you that I understand the case. I don't\nwonder you are not pleased, for Charlie is too presuming, and you do\nneed someone to help you head him off a bit. Hey, Cousin?\"\n\n\"What a way to put it!\" And Rose laughed in spite of herself, adding\nwith an air of relief, \"That is it, and I do want someone to help me\nmake him understand that I don't choose to be taken possession of in\nthat lordly way, as if I belonged to him more than to the rest of the\nfamily. I don't like it, for people begin to talk, and Charlie won't see\nhow disagreeable it is to me.\"\n\n\"Tell him so,\" was Mac's blunt advice.\n\n\"I have, but he only laughs and promises to behave, and then he does\nit again when I am so placed that I can't say anything. You will never\nunderstand, and I cannot explain, for it is only a look, or a word, or\nsome little thing but I won't have it, and the best way to cure him is\nto put it out of his power to annoy me so.\"\n\n\"He is a great flirt and wants to teach you how, I suppose. I'll speak\nto him if you like and tell him you don't want to learn. Shall I?\" asked\nMac, finding the case rather an interesting one.\n\n\"No, thank you that would only make trouble. If you will kindly play\nescort a few times, it will show Charlie that I am in earnest without\nmore words and put a stop to the gossip,\" said Rose, coloring like a\npoppy at the recollection of what she heard one young man whisper to\nanother as Charlie led her through a crowded supper room with his most\ndevoted air, \"Lucky dog! He is sure to get the heiress, and we are\nnowhere.\"\n\n\"There's no danger of people gossiping about us, is there?\" And Mac\nlooked up with the oddest of all his odd expressions.\n\n\"Of course not you're only a boy.\"\n\n\"I'm twenty-one, thank you, and Prince is but a couple of years older,\"\nsaid Mac, promptly resenting the slight put upon his manhood.\n\n\"Yes, but he is like other young men, while you are a dear old bookworm.\nNo one would ever mind what you did, so you may go to parties with me\nevery night and not a word would be said or, if there was, I shouldn't\nmind since it is 'only Mac,'\" answered Rose, smiling as she quoted a\nhousehold phrase often used to excuse his vagaries.\n\n\"Then I am nobody?\" he said, lifting his brows as if the discovery\nsurprised and rather nettled him.\n\n\"Nobody in society as yet, but my very best cousin in private, and I've\njust proved my regard by making you my confidant and choosing you for my\nknight,\" said Rose, hastening to soothe the feelings her careless words\nseemed to have ruffled slightly.\n\n\"Much good that is likely to do me,\" grumbled Mac.\n\n\"You ungrateful boy, not to appreciate the honor I've conferred upon\nyou! I know a dozen who would be proud of the place, but you only care\nfor compound fractures, so I won't detain you any longer, except to ask\nif I may consider myself provided with an escort for tomorrow night?\"\nsaid Rose, a trifle hurt at his indifference, for she was not used to\nrefusals.\n\n\"If I may hope for the honor.\" And, rising, he made her a bow which was\nsuch a capital imitation of Charlie's grand manner that she forgave him\nat once, exclaiming with amused surprise: \"Why, Mac! I didn't know you\ncould be so elegant!\"\n\n\"A fellow can be almost anything he likes if he tries hard enough,\" he\nanswered, standing very straight and looking so tall and dignified\nthat Rose was quite impressed, and with a stately courtesy she retired,\nsaying graciously: \"I accept with thanks. Good morning, Dr. Alexander\nMackenzie Campbell.\"\n\nWhen Friday evening came and word was sent up that her escort had\narrived, Rose ran down, devoutly hoping that he had not come in a\nvelveteen jacket, top-boots, black gloves, or made any trifling mistake\nof that sort. A young gentleman was standing before the long mirror,\napparently intent upon the arrangement of his hair, and Rose paused\nsuddenly as her eye went from the glossy broadcloth to the white-gloved\nhands, busy with an unruly lock that would not stay in place.\n\n\"Why, Charlie, I thought--\" she began with an accent of surprise in her\nvoice, but got no further, for the gentleman turned and she beheld Mac\nin immaculate evening costume, with his hair parted sweetly on his brow,\na superior posy at his buttonhole, and the expression of a martyr on his\nface.\n\n\"Ah, don't you wish it was? No one but yourself to thank that it isn't\nhe. Am I right? Dandy got me up, and he ought to know what is what,\"\ndemanded Mac, folding his hands and standing as stiff as a ramrod.\n\n\"You are so regularly splendid that I don't know you.\"\n\n\"Neither do I.\"\n\n\"I really had no idea you could look so like a gentleman,\" added Rose,\nsurveying him with great approval.\n\n\"Nor that I could feel so like a fool.\"\n\n\"Poor boy! He does look rather miserable. What can I do to cheer him up\nin return for the sacrifice he is making?\"\n\n\"Stop calling me a boy. It will soothe my agony immensely and give me\ncourage to appear in a low-necked coat and curl on my forehead, for I'm\nnot used to such elegancies and I find them no end of a trial.\"\n\nMac spoke in such a pathetic tone, and gave such a gloomy glare at the\naforesaid curl, that Rose laughed in his face and added to his woe\nby handing him her cloak. He surveyed it gravely for a minute, then\ncarefully put it on wrong side out and gave the swan's-down hood a good\npull over the head, to the utter destruction of all smoothness to the\ncurls inside.\n\nRose uttered a cry and cast off the cloak, bidding him learn to do it\nproperly, which he meekly did and then led her down the hall without\nwalking on her skirts more than three times on the way. But at the door\nshe discovered that she had forgotten her furred overshoes and bade Mac\nget them.\n\n\"Never mind it's not wet,\" he said, pulling his cap over his eyes and\nplunging into his coat, regardless of the \"elegancies\" that afflicted\nhim.\n\n\"But I can't walk on cold stones with thin slippers, can I?\" began Rose,\nshowing him a little white foot.\n\n\"You needn't, for there you are, my lady.\" And, unceremoniously picking\nher up, Mac landed her in the carriage before she could say a word.\n\n\"What an escort!\" she exclaimed in comic dismay, as she rescued her\ndelicate dress from a rug in which he was about to tuck her up like a\nmummy.\n\n\"It's 'only Mac,' so don't mind,\" and he cast himself into an\nopposite corner with the air of a man who had nerved himself to the\naccomplishment of many painful duties and was bound to do them or die.\n\n\"But gentlemen don't catch up ladies like bags of meal and poke them\ninto carriages in this way. It is evident that you need looking after,\nand it is high time I undertook your society manners. Now, do mind what\nyou are about and don't get yourself or me into a scrape if you can help\nit,\" besought Rose, feeling that on many accounts she had gone further\nand fared worse.\n\n\"I'll behave like a Turveydrop see if I don't.\"\n\nMac's idea of the immortal Turveydrop's behavior seemed to be a peculiar\none; for, after dancing once with his cousin, he left her to her own\ndevices and soon forgot all about her in a long conversation with\nProfessor Stumph, the learned geologist. Rose did not care, for one\ndance proved to her that that branch of Mac's education had been sadly\nneglected, and she was glad to glide smoothly about with Steve, though\nhe was only an inch or two taller than herself. She had plenty of\npartners, however, and plenty of chaperons, for all the young men were\nher most devoted, and all the matrons beamed upon her with maternal\nbenignity.\n\nCharlie was not there, for when he found that Rose stood firm, and had\nmoreover engaged Mac as a permanency, he would not go at all and retired\nin high dudgeon to console himself with more dangerous pastimes. Rose\nfeared it would be so, and even in the midst of the gaiety about her an\nanxious mood came over her now and then and made her thoughtful for a\nmoment. She felt her power and wanted to use it wisely, but did not know\nhow to be kind to Charlie without being untrue to herself and giving him\nfalse hopes.\n\n\"I wish we were all children again, with no hearts to perplex us and no\ngreat temptations to try us,\" she said to herself as she rested a minute\nin a quiet nook while her partner went to get a glass of water. Right\nin the midst of this half-sad, half-sentimental reverie, she heard\na familiar voice behind her say earnestly: \"And allophite is the new\nhydrous silicate of alumina and magnesia, much resembling pseudophite,\nwhich Websky found in Silesia.\"\n\n\"What is Mac talking about!\" she thought, and, peeping behind a great\nazalea in full bloom, she saw her cousin in deep conversation with the\nprofessor, evidently having a capital time, for his face had lost its\nmelancholy expression and was all alive with interest, while the elder\nman was listening as if his remarks were both intelligent and agreeable.\n\n\"What is it?\" asked Steve, coming up with the water and seeing a smile\non Rose's face.\n\nShe pointed out the scientific tete-a-tete going on behind the azalea,\nand Steve grinned as he peeped, then grew sober and said in a tone\nof despair: \"If you had seen the pains I took with that fellow, the\npatience with which I brushed his wig, the time I spent trying to\nconvince him that he must wear thin boots, and the fight I had to get\nhim into that coat, you'd understand my feelings when I see him now.\"\n\n\"Why, what's the matter with him?\" asked Rose.\n\n\"Will you take a look and see what a spectacle he has made of himself.\nHe'd better be sent home at once or he will disgrace the family by\nlooking as if he'd been in a row.\"\n\nSteve spoke in such a tragic tone that Rose took another peep and did\nsympathize with Dandy, for Mac's elegance was quite gone. His tie was\nunder one ear, his posy hung upside down, his gloves were rolled into a\nball, which he absently squeezed and pounded as he talked, and his hair\nlooked as if a whirlwind had passed over it, for his ten fingers set\nit on end now and then, as they had a habit of doing when he studied or\ntalked earnestly. But he looked so happy and wide awake, in spite of his\ndishevelment, that Rose gave an approving nod and said behind her fan:\n\"It is a trying spectacle, Steve yet, on the whole, I think his own odd\nways suit him best and I fancy we shall be proud of him, for he knows\nmore than all the rest of us put together. Hear that now.\" And Rose\npaused that they might listen to the following burst of eloquence from\nMac's lips: \"You know Frenzal has shown that the globular forms of\nsilicate of bismuth at Schneeburg and Johanngeorgenstadt are not\nisometric, but monoclinic in crystalline form, and consequently he\nseparates them from the old eulytite and gives them the new name\nAgricolite.\"\n\n\"Isn't it awful? Let us get out of this before there's another avalanche\nor we shall be globular silicates and isometric crystals in spite of\nourselves,\" whispered Steve with a panic-stricken air, and they fled\nfrom the hailstorm of hard words that rattled about their ears, leaving\nMac to enjoy himself in his own way.\n\nBut when Rose was ready to go home and looked about for her escort, he\nwas nowhere to be seen, for the professor had departed, and Mac with\nhim, so absorbed in some new topic that he entirely forgot his cousin\nand went placidly home, still pondering on the charms of geology. When\nthis pleasing fact dawned upon Rose her feelings may be imagined. She\nwas both angry and amused it was so like Mac to go mooning off and leave\nher to her fate. Not a hard one, however; for, though Steve was gone\nwith Kitty before her plight was discovered, Mrs. Bliss was only too\nglad to take the deserted damsel under her wing and bear her safely\nhome.\n\nRose was warming her feet and sipping the chocolate which Phebe always\nhad ready for her, as she never ate supper, when a hurried tap came\nat the long window whence the light streamed and Mac's voice was heard\nsoftly asking to be let in \"just for one minute.\"\n\nCurious to know what had befallen him, Rose bade Phebe obey his call\nand the delinquent cavalier appeared, breathless, anxious, and more\ndilapidated than ever, for he had forgotten his overcoat; his tie was at\nthe back of his neck now; and his hair as rampantly erect as if all the\nwinds of heaven had been blowing freely through it, as they had, for\nhe had been tearing to and fro the last half hour, trying to undo the\ndreadful deed he had so innocently committed.\n\n\"Don't take any notice of me, for I don't deserve it. I only came to see\nthat you were safe, Cousin, and then go hang myself, as Steve advised,\"\nhe began in a remorseful tone that would have been very effective if\nhe had not been obliged to catch his breath with a comical gasp now and\nthen.\n\n\"I never thought you would be the one to desert me,\" said Rose with a\nreproachful look, thinking it best not to relent too soon, though she\nwas quite ready to do it when she saw how sincerely distressed he was.\n\n\"It was that confounded man! He was a regular walking encyclopedia,\nand, finding I could get a good deal out of him, I went in for general\ninformation, as the time was short. You know I always forget everything\nelse when I get hold of such a fellow.\"\n\n\"That is evident. I wonder how you came to remember me at all,\" answered\nRose, on the brink of a laugh it was so absurd.\n\n\"I didn't till Steve said something that reminded me then it burst upon\nme, in one awful shock, that I'd gone and left you, and you might have\nknocked me down with a feather,\" said honest Mac, hiding none of his\niniquity.\n\n\"What did you do then?\"\n\n\"Do! I went off like a shot and never stopped till I reached the Hopes'\"\n\n\"You didn't walk all the way?\" cried Rose.\n\n\"Bless you, no I ran. But you were gone with Mrs. Bliss, so I pelted\nback again to see with my own eyes that you were safe at home,\" answered\nMac with a sigh of relief, wiping his hot forehead.\n\n\"But it is three miles at least each way, and twelve o'clock, and dark\nand cold. Oh, Mac! How could you!\" exclaimed Rose, suddenly realizing\nwhat he had done as she heard his labored breathing, saw the state of\nthe thin boots, and detected the absence of an overcoat.\n\n\"Couldn't do less, could I?\" asked Mac, leaning up against the door and\ntrying not to pant.\n\n\"There was no need of half killing yourself for such a trifle. You might\nhave known I could take care of myself for once, at least, with so many\nfriends about. Sit down this minute. Bring another cup, please, Phebe\nthis boy isn't going home till he is rested and refreshed after such a\nrun as that,\" commanded Rose.\n\n\"Don't be good to me I'd rather take a scolding than a chair, and drink\nhemlock instead of chocolate if you happen to have any ready,\" answered\nMac with a pathetic puff as he subsided onto the sofa and meekly took\nthe draft Phebe brought him.\n\n\"If you had anything the matter with your heart, sir, a race of this\nsort might be the death of you so never do it again,\" said Rose,\noffering her fan to cool his heated countenance.\n\n\"Haven't got any heart.\"\n\n\"Yes, you have, for I hear it beating like a trip-hammer, and it is\nmy fault I ought to have stopped as we went by and told you I was all\nright.\"\n\n\"It's the mortification, not the miles, that upsets me. I often take\nthat run for exercise and think nothing of it but tonight I was so mad\nI made extra-good time, I fancy. Now don't you worry, but compose\nyour mind and 'sip your dish of tea,' as Evelina says,\" answered Mac,\nartfully turning the conversation from himself.\n\n\"What do you know about Evelina?\" asked Rose in great surprise.\n\n\"All about her. Do you suppose I never read a novel?\"\n\n\"I thought you read nothing but Greek and Latin, with an\noccasional glance at Websky's pseudophites and the monoclinics of\nJohanngeorgenstadt.\"\n\nMac opened his eyes wide at this reply, then seemed to see the joke and\njoined in the laugh with such heartiness that Aunt Plenty's voice was\nheard demanding from above with sleepy anxiety: \"Is the house afire?\"\n\n\"No, ma'am, everything is safe, and I'm only saying good night,\"\nanswered Mac, diving for his cap.\n\n\"Then go at once and let that child have her sleep,\" added the old lady,\nretiring to her bed.\n\nRose ran into the hall, and catching up her uncle's fur coat, met Mac as\nhe came out of the study, absently looking about for his own.\n\n\"You haven't any, you benighted boy! So take this, and have your wits\nabout you next time or I won't let you off so easily,\" she said, holding\nup the heavy garment and peeping over it, with no sign of displeasure in\nher laughing eyes.\n\n\"Next time! Then you do forgive me? You will try me again, and give me a\nchance to prove that I'm not a fool?\" cried Mac, embracing the big coat\nwith emotion.\n\n\"Of course I will, and, so far from thinking you a fool, I was much\nimpressed with your learning tonight and told Steve that we ought to be\nproud of our philosopher.\"\n\n\"Learning be hanged! I'll show you that I'm not a bookworm but as much\na man as any of them, and then you may be proud or not, as you like!\"\ncried Mac with a defiant nod that caused the glasses to leap wildly off\nhis nose as he caught up his hat and departed as he came.\n\nA day or two later Rose went to call upon Aunt Jane, as she dutifully\ndid once or twice a week. On her way upstairs she heard a singular sound\nin the drawing room and involuntarily stopped to listen.\n\n\"One, two, three, slide! One, two, three, turn! Now, then, come on!\"\nsaid one voice impatiently.\n\n\"It's very easy to say 'come on,' but what the dickens do I do with my\nleft leg while I'm turning and sliding with my right?\" demanded another\nvoice in a breathless and mournful tone.\n\nThen the whistling and thumping went on more vigorously than before,\nand Rose, recognizing the voices, peeped through the half-open door to\nbehold a sight which made her shake with suppressed laughter. Steve,\nwith a red tablecloth tied around his waist, languished upon Mac's\nshoulder, dancing in perfect time to the air he whistled, for Dandy was\nproficient in the graceful art and plumed himself upon his skill. Mac,\nwith a flushed face and dizzy eye, clutched his brother by the small\nof his back, vainly endeavoring to steer him down the long room without\nentangling his own legs in the tablecloth, treading on his partner's\ntoes, or colliding with the furniture. It was very droll, and Rose\nenjoyed the spectacle till Mac, in a frantic attempt to swing around,\ndashed himself against the wall and landed Steve upon the floor. Then\nit was impossible to restrain her laughter any longer and she walked in\nupon them, saying merrily: \"It was splendid! Do it again, and I'll play\nfor you.\"\n\nSteve sprang up and tore off the tablecloth in great confusion, while\nMac, still rubbing his head, dropped into a chair, trying to look quite\ncalm and cheerful as he gasped out: \"How are you, Cousin? When did you\ncome? John should have told us.\"\n\n\"I'm glad he didn't, for then I should have missed this touching tableau\nof cousinly devotion and brotherly love. Getting ready for our next\nparty, I see.\"\n\n\"Trying to, but there are so many things to remember all at once keep\ntime, steer straight, dodge the petticoats, and manage my confounded\nlegs that it isn't easy to get on at first,\" answered Mac with a sigh of\nexhaustion, wiping his hot forehead.\n\n\"Hardest job I ever undertook and, as I'm not a battering ram, I decline\nto be knocked round any longer,\" growled Steve, dusting his knees and\nruefully surveying the feet that had been trampled on till they tingled,\nfor his boots and broadcloth were dear to the heart of the dapper youth.\n\n\"Very good of you, and I'm much obliged. I've got the pace, I think,\nand can practice with a chair to keep my hand in,\" said Mac with such a\ncomic mixture of gratitude and resignation that Rose went off again so\nirresistibly that her cousins joined her with a hearty roar.\n\n\"As you are making a martyr of yourself in my service, the least I\ncan do is lend a hand. Play for us, Steve, and I'll give Mac a lesson,\nunless he prefers the chair.\" And, throwing off her hat and cloak, Rose\nbeckoned so invitingly that the gravest philosopher would have yielded.\n\n\"A thousand thanks, but I'm afraid I shall hurt you,\" began Mac, much\ngratified, but mindful of past mishaps.\n\n\"I'm not. Steve didn't manage his train well, for good dancers always\nloop theirs up. I have none at all, so that trouble is gone and the\nmusic will make it much easier to keep step. Just do as I tell you, and\nyou'll go beautifully after a few turns.\"\n\n\"I will, I will! Pipe up, Steve! Now, Rose!\" And, brushing his hair out\nof his eyes with an air of stern determination, Mac grasped Rose and\nreturned to the charge bent on distinguishing himself if he died in the\nattempt.\n\nThe second lesson prospered, for Steve marked the time by a series of\nemphatic bangs; Mac obeyed orders as promptly as if his life depended on\nit; and, after several narrow escapes at exciting moments, Rose had the\nsatisfaction of being steered safely down the room and landed with a\ngrand pirouette at the bottom. Steve applauded, and Mac, much elated,\nexclaimed with artless candor: \"There really is a sort of inspiration\nabout you, Rose. I always detested dancing before, but now, do you know,\nI rather like it.\"\n\n\"I knew you would, only you mustn't stand with your arm round your\npartner in this way when you are done. You must seat and fan her, if\nshe likes it,\" said Rose, anxious to perfect a pupil who seemed so\nlamentably in need of a teacher.\n\n\"Yes, of course, I know how they do it.\" And, releasing his cousin, Mac\nraised a small whirlwind around her with a folded newspaper, so full of\nzeal that she had not the heart to chide him again.\n\n\"Well done, old fellow. I begin to have hopes of you and will order\nyou a new dress coat at once, since you are really going in for\nthe proprieties of life,\" said Steve from the music stool, with the\napproving nod of one who was a judge of said proprieties. \"Now, Rose,\nif you will just coach him a little in his small talk, he won't make\na laughingstock of himself as he did the other night,\" added Steve. \"I\ndon't mean his geological gabble that was bad enough, but his chat with\nEmma Curtis was much worse. Tell her, Mac, and see if she doesn't think\npoor Emma had a right to think you a first-class bore.\"\n\n\"I don't see why, when I merely tried to have a little sensible\nconversation,\" began Mac with reluctance, for he had been unmercifully\nchaffed by his cousins, to whom his brother had betrayed him.\n\n\"What did you say? I won't laugh if I can help it,\" said Rose, curious\nto hear, for Steve's eyes were twinkling with fun.\n\n\"Well, I knew she was fond of theaters, so I tried that first and got\non pretty well till I began to tell her how they managed those things in\nGreece. Most interesting subject, you know?\"\n\n\"Very. Did you give her one of the choruses or a bit of Agamemnon, as\nyou did when you described it to me?\" asked Rose, keeping sober with\ndifficulty as she recalled that serio-comic scene.\n\n\"Of course not, but I was advising her to read Prometheus when she gaped\nbehind her fan and began to talk about Phebe. What a 'nice creature' she\nwas, 'kept her place,' dressed according to her station, and that sort\nof twaddle. I suppose it was rather rude, but being pulled up so short\nconfused me a bit, and I said the first thing that came into my head,\nwhich was that I thought Phebe the best-dressed woman in the room\nbecause she wasn't all fuss and feathers like most of the girls.\"\n\n\"Oh, Mac! That to Emma, who makes it the labor of her life to be always\nin the height of fashion and was particularly splendid that night. What\ndid she say?\" cried Rose, full of sympathy for both parties.\n\n\"She bridled and looked daggers at me.\"\n\n\"And what did you do?\"\n\n\"I bit my tongue and tumbled out of one scrape into another. Following\nher example, I changed the subject by talking about the charity concert\nfor the orphans, and when she gushed about the 'little darlings,' I\nadvised her to adopt one and wondered why young ladies didn't do that\nsort of thing, instead of cuddling cats and lapdogs.\"\n\n\"Unhappy boy! Her pug is the idol of her life, and she hates babies,\"\nsaid Rose.\n\n\"More fool she! Well, she got my opinion on the subject, anyway, and\nshe's very welcome, for I went on to say that I thought it would not\nonly be a lovely charity, but excellent training for the time when they\nhad little darlings of their own. No end of poor things die through the\nignorance of mothers, you know,\" added Mac, so seriously that Rose dared\nnot smile at what went before.\n\n\"Imagine Emma trotting round with a pauper baby under her arm instead of\nher cherished Toto,\" said Steve with an ecstatic twirl on the stool.\n\n\"Did she seem to like your advice, Monsieur Malapropos?\" asked Rose,\nwishing she had been there.\n\n\"No, she gave a little shriek and said, 'Good gracious, Mr. Campbell,\nhow droll you are! Take me to Mama, please,' which I did with a thankful\nheart. Catch me setting her pug's leg again,\" ended Mac with a grim\nshake of the head.\n\n\"Never mind. You were unfortunate in your listener that time. Don't\nthink all girls are so foolish. I can show you a dozen sensible ones who\nwould discuss dress reform and charity with you and enjoy Greek\ntragedy if you did the chorus for them as you did for me,\" said Rose\nconsolingly, for Steve would only jeer.\n\n\"Give me a list of them, please, and I'll cultivate their acquaintance.\nA fellow must have some reward for making a teetotum of himself.\"\n\n\"I will with pleasure; and if you dance well they will make it very\npleasant for you, and you'll enjoy parties in spite of yourself.\"\n\n\"I cannot be a 'glass of fashion and a mold of form' like Dandy here,\nbut I'll do my best: only, if I had my choice, I'd much rather go round\nthe streets with an organ and a monkey,\" answered Mac despondently.\n\n\"Thank you kindly for the compliment,\" and Rose made him a low courtesy,\nwhile Steve cried, \"Now you have done it!\" in a tone of reproach which\nreminded the culprit, all too late, that he was Rose's chosen escort.\n\n\"By the gods, so I have!\" And casting away the newspaper with a gesture\nof comic despair, Mac strode from the room, chanting tragically the\nwords of Cassandra, \"'Woe! woe! O Earth! O Apollo! I will dare to die; I\nwill accost the gates of Hades, and make my prayer that I may receive a\nmortal blow!'\"\n\n\n\n\nChapter 7 PHEBE\n\nWhile Rose was making discoveries and having experiences, Phebe was\ndoing the same in a quieter way, but though they usually compared notes\nduring the bedtime tete-a-tete which always ended their day, certain\ntopics were never mentioned, so each had a little world of her own into\nwhich even the eye of friendship did not peep.\n\nRose's life just now was the gaiest but Phebe's the happiest. Both went\nout a good deal, for the beautiful voice was welcomed everywhere, and\nmany were ready to patronize the singer who would have been slow to\nrecognize the woman. Phebe knew this and made no attempt to assert\nherself, content to know that those whose regard she valued felt her\nworth and hopeful of a time when she could gracefully take the place she\nwas meant to fill.\n\nProud as a princess was Phebe about some things, though in most as\nhumble as a child; therefore, when each year lessened the service she\nloved to give and increased the obligations she would have refused from\nany other source, dependence became a burden which even the most fervent\ngratitude could not lighten. Hitherto the children had gone on together,\nfinding no obstacles to their companionship in the secluded world\nin which they lived. Now that they were women their paths inevitably\ndiverged, and both reluctantly felt that they must part before long.\n\nIt had been settled, when they were abroad, that on their return Phebe\nshould take her one gift in her hand and try her fortunes. On no\nother terms would she accept the teaching which was to fit her for the\nindependence she desired. Faithfully had she used the facilities so\ngenerously afforded both at home and abroad and now was ready to prove\nthat they had not been in vain. Much encouraged by the small successes\nshe won in drawing rooms, and the praise bestowed by interested friends,\nshe began to feel that she might venture on a larger field and begin her\ncareer as a concert singer, for she aimed no higher.\n\nJust at this time much interest was felt in a new asylum for orphan\ngirls, which could not be completed for want of funds. The Campbells\nwell had borne their part and still labored to accomplish the\nmuch-needed charity. Several fairs had been given for this purpose,\nfollowed by a series of concerts. Rose had thrown herself into the work\nwith all her heart and now proposed that Phebe should make her debut at\nthe last concert, which was to be a peculiarly interesting one, as all\nthe orphans were to be present and were expected to plead their own\ncause by the sight of their innocent helplessness as well as touch\nhearts by the simple airs they were to sing.\n\nSome of the family thought Phebe would object to so humble a beginning,\nbut Rose knew her better and was not disappointed, for when she made her\nproposal Phebe answered readily: \"Where could I find a fitter time and\nplace to come before the public than here among my little sisters in\nmisfortune? I'll sing for them with all my heart only I must be one of\nthem and have no flourish made about me.\"\n\n\"You shall arrange it as you like, and as there is to be little vocal\nmusic but yours and the children's, I'll see that you have everything as\nyou please,\" promised Rose.\n\nIt was well she did, for the family got much excited over the prospect\nof \"our Phebe's debut\" and would have made a flourish if the girls had\nnot resisted. Aunt Clara was in despair about the dress because Phebe\ndecided to wear a plain claret-colored merino with frills at neck and\nwrists so that she might look, as much as possible, like the other\norphans in their stuff gowns and white aprons. Aunt Plenty wanted to\nhave a little supper afterward in honor of the occasion, but Phebe\nbegged her to change it to a Christmas dinner for the poor children. The\nboys planned to throw bushels of flowers, and Charlie claimed the honor\nof leading the singer in. But Phebe, with tears in her eyes, declined\ntheir kindly offers, saying earnestly: \"I had better begin as I am to go\non and depend upon myself entirely. Indeed, Mr. Charlie, I'd rather\nwalk in alone, for you'd be out of place among us and spoil the pathetic\neffect we wish to produce.\" And a smile sparkled through the tears as\nPhebe looked at the piece of elegance before her and thought of the\nbrown gowns and pinafores.\n\nSo, after much discussion, it was decided that she should have her way\nin all things and the family content themselves with applauding from the\nfront.\n\n\"We'll blister our hands every man of us, and carry you home in a\nchariot and four see if we don't, you perverse prima donna!\" threatened\nSteve, not at all satisfied with the simplicity of the affair.\n\n\"A chariot and two will be very acceptable as soon as I'm done. I shall\nbe quite steady till my part is all over, and then I may feel a little\nupset, so I'd like to get away before the confusion begins. Indeed, I\ndon't mean to be perverse, but you are all so kind to me, my heart is\nfull whenever I think of it, and that wouldn't do if I'm to sing,\" said\nPhebe, dropping one of the tears on the little frill she was making.\n\n\"No diamond could have adorned it better,\" Archie thought as he watched\nit shine there for a moment, and felt like shaking Steve for daring to\npat the dark head with an encouraging \"All right. I'll be on hand and\nwhisk you away while the rest are splitting their gloves. No fear of\nyour breaking down. If you feel the least bit like it, though, just look\nat me and I'll glare at you and shake my fist, since kindness upsets\nyou.\"\n\n\"I wish you would, because one of my ballads is rather touching and I\nalways want to cry when I sing it. The sight of you trying to glare will\nmake me want to laugh and that will steady me nicely, so sit in front,\nplease, ready to slip out when I come off the last time.\"\n\n\"Depend upon me!\" And the little man departed, taking great credit to\nhimself for his influence over tall, handsome Phebe.\n\nIf he had known what was going on in the mind of the silent young\ngentleman behind the newspaper, Steve would have been much astonished,\nfor Archie, though apparently engrossed by business, was fathoms deep in\nlove by this time. No one suspected this but Rose, for he did his wooing\nwith his eyes, and only Phebe knew how eloquent they could be. He had\ndiscovered what the matter was long ago had made many attempts to reason\nhimself out of it, but, finding it a hopeless task, had given up trying\nand let himself drift deliciously. The knowledge that the family would\nnot approve only seemed to add ardor to his love and strength to\nhis purpose, for the same energy and persistence which he brought to\nbusiness went into everything he did, and having once made up his mind\nto marry Phebe, nothing could change this plan except a word from her.\n\nHe watched and waited for three months, so that he might not be accused\nof precipitation, though it did not take him one to decide that this was\nthe woman to make him happy. Her steadfast nature, quiet, busy ways,\nand the reserved power and passion betrayed sometimes by a flash of the\nblack eyes, a quiver of the firm lips, suited Archie, who possessed many\nof the same attributes himself. The obscurity of her birth and isolation\nof her lot, which would have deterred some lovers, not only appealed to\nhis kindly heart, but touched the hidden romance which ran like a vein\nof gold through his strong common sense and made practical, steady-going\nArchie a poet when he fell in love. If Uncle Mac had guessed what dreams\nand fancies went on in the head bent over his ledgers, and what emotions\nwere fermenting in the bosom of his staid \"right-hand man,\" he would\nhave tapped his forehead and suggested a lunatic asylum. The boys\nthought Archie had sobered down too soon. His mother began to fear that\nthe air of the counting room did not suit him, and Dr. Alec was deluded\ninto the belief that the fellow really began to \"think of Rose,\" he\ncame so often in the evening, seeming quite content to sit beside her\nworktable and snip tape or draw patterns while they chatted.\n\nNo one observed that, though he talked to Rose on these occasions, he\nlooked at Phebe, in her low chair close by, busy but silent, for she\nalways tried to efface herself when Rose was near and often mourned that\nshe was too big to keep out of sight. No matter what he talked about,\nArchie always saw the glossy black braids on the other side of the\ntable, the damask cheek curving down into the firm white throat, and the\ndark lashes, lifted now and then, showing eyes so deep and soft he dared\nnot look into them long. Even the swift needle charmed him, the little\nbrooch which rose and fell with her quiet breath, the plain work she\ndid, and the tidy way she gathered her bits of thread into a tiny bag.\nHe seldom spoke to her; never touched her basket, though he ravaged\nRose's if he wanted string or scissors; very rarely ventured to bring\nher some curious or pretty thing when ships came in from China only\nsat and thought of her, imagined that this was his parlor, this her\nworktable, and they two sitting there alone a happy man and wife.\n\nAt this stage of the little evening drama he would be conscious of such\na strong desire to do something rash that he took refuge in a new form\nof intoxication and proposed music, sometimes so abruptly that Rose\nwould pause in the middle of a sentence and look at him, surprised to\nmeet a curiously excited look in the usually cool gray eyes.\n\nThen Phebe, folding up her work, would go to the piano, as if glad to\nfind a vent for the inner life which she seemed to have no power of\nexpressing except in song. Rose would follow to accompany her, and\nArchie, moving to a certain shady corner whence he could see Phebe's\nface as she sang, would give himself up to unmitigated rapture for\nhalf an hour. Phebe never sang so well as at such times, for the kindly\natmosphere was like sunshine to a bird, criticisms were few and gentle,\npraises hearty and abundant, and she poured out her soul as freely as a\nspring gushes up when its hidden source is full.\n\nIn moments such as these Phebe was beautiful with the beauty that makes\na man's eye brighten with honest admiration and fills his heart with a\nsense of womanly nobility and sweetness. Little wonder, then, that the\nchief spectator of this agreeable tableau grew nightly more enamored,\nand while the elders were deep in whist, the young people were playing\nthat still more absorbing game in which hearts are always trumps.\n\nRose, having Dummy for a partner, soon discovered the fact and lately\nhad begun to feel as she fancied Wall must have done when Pyramus wooed\nThisbe through its chinks. She was a little startled at first, then\namused, then anxious, then heartily interested, as every woman is in\nsuch affairs, and willingly continued to be a medium, though sometimes\nshe quite tingled with the electricity which seemed to pervade the air.\nShe said nothing, waiting for Phebe to speak, but Phebe was silent,\nseeming to doubt the truth till doubt became impossible, then to shrink\nas if suddenly conscious of wrongdoing and seize every possible pretext\nfor absenting herself from the \"girls' corner,\" as the pretty recess was\ncalled.\n\nThe concert plan afforded excellent opportunities for doing this, and\nevening after evening she slipped away to practice her songs upstairs\nwhile Archie sat staring disconsolately at the neglected work basket\nand mute piano. Rose pitied him and longed to say a word of comfort, but\nfelt shy he was such a reserved fellow so left him to conduct his quiet\nwooing in his own way, feeling that the crisis would soon arrive.\n\nShe was sure of this as she sat beside him on the evening of the\nconcert, for while the rest of the family nodded and smiled, chatted and\nlaughed in great spirits, Archie was as mute as a fish and sat with his\narms tightly folded, as if to keep in any unruly emotions which might\nattempt to escape. He never looked at the program, but Rose knew when\nPhebe's turn came by the quick breath he drew and the intent look, so\nabsent before, that came into his eyes.\n\nBut her own excitement prevented much notice of his, for Rose was in\na flutter of hope and fear, sympathy and delight, about Phebe and her\nsuccess. The house was crowded; the audience sufficiently mixed to make\nthe general opinion impartial; and the stage full of little orphans with\nshining faces, a most effective reminder of the object in view.\n\n\"Little dears, how nice they look!\" \"Poor things, so young to be\nfatherless and motherless.\" \"It will be a disgrace to the city if those\ngirls are not taken proper care of.\" \"Subscriptions are always in order,\nyou know, and pretty Miss Campbell will give you her sweetest smile if\nyou hand her a handsome check.\" \"I've heard this Phebe Moore, and she\nreally has a delicious voice such a pity she won't fit herself for\nopera!\" \"Only sings three times tonight; that's modest, I'm sure, when\nshe's the chief attraction, so we must give her an encore after the\nItalian piece.\" \"The orphans lead off, I see. Stop your ears if you\nlike, but don't fail to applaud or the ladies will never forgive you.\"\n\nChat of this sort went on briskly while fans waved, programs rustled,\nand ushers flew about distractedly, till an important gentleman\nappeared, made his bow, skipped upon the leader's stand, and with a wave\nof his baton caused a general uprising of white pinafores as the orphans\nled off with that much-enduring melody \"America\" in shrill small voices,\nbut with creditable attention to time and tune. Pity and patriotism\nproduced a generous round of applause, and the little girls sat down,\nbeaming with innocent satisfaction.\n\nAn instrumental piece followed, and then a youthful gentleman, with his\nhair in picturesque confusion, and what his friends called a \"musical\nbrow,\" bounded up the steps and, clutching a roll of music with a pair\nof tightly gloved hands, proceed to inform the audience, in a husky\ntenor voice, that \"It was a lovely violet.\"\n\nWhat else the song contained in the way of sense or sentiment it was\nimpossible to discover as the three pages of music appeared to consist\nof variations upon that one line, ending with a prolonged quaver which\nflushed the musical brow and left the youth quite breathless when he\nmade his bow.\n\n\"Now she's coming! Oh, Uncle, my heart beats as if it were myself!\"\nwhispered Rose, clutching Dr. Alec's arm with a little gasp as the piano\nwas rolled forward, the leader's stand pushed back, and all eyes turned\ntoward the anteroom door.\n\nShe forgot to glance at Archie, and it was as well perhaps, for his\nheart was thumping almost audibly as he waited for his Phebe. Not from\nthe anteroom, but out among the children, where she had sat unseen in\nthe shadow of the organ, came stately Phebe in her wine-colored dress,\nwith no ornament but her fine hair and a white flower at her throat.\nVery pale, but quite composed, apparently, for she stepped slowly\nthrough the narrow lane of upturned faces, holding back her skirts lest\nthey should rudely brush against some little head. Straight to the front\nshe went, bowed hastily, and, with a gesture to the accompanist, stood\nwaiting to begin, her eyes fixed on the great gilt clock at the opposite\nend of the hall.\n\nThey never wandered from that point while she sang, but as she ended\nthey dropped for an instant on an eager, girlish countenance bending\nfrom a front seat; then, with her hasty little bow, she went quickly\nback among the children, who clapped and nodded as she passed, well\npleased with the ballad she had sung.\n\nEveryone courteously followed their example, but there was no\nenthusiasm, and it was evident that Phebe had not produced a\nparticularly favorable impression.\n\n\"Never sang so badly in her life,\" muttered Charlie irefully.\n\n\"She was frightened, poor thing. Give her time, give her time,\" said\nUncle Mac kindly.\n\n\"I know she was, and I glared like a gorgon, but she never looked at\nme,\" added Steve, smoothing his gloves and his brows at the same time.\n\n\"That first song was the hardest, and she got through much better than\nI expected,\" put in Dr. Alec, bound not to show the disappointment he\nfelt.\n\n\"Don't be troubled. Phebe has courage enough for anything, and she'll\nastonish you before the evening's over,\" prophesied Mac with unabated\nconfidence, for he knew something the rest did not.\n\nRose said nothing, but under cover of her burnous gave Archie's hand a\nsympathetic squeeze, for his arms were unfolded now, as if the strain\nwas over, and one lay on his knee while with the other he wiped his hot\nforehead with an air of relief.\n\nFriends about them murmured complimentary fibs and affected great\ndelight and surprise at Miss Moore's \"charming style,\" \"exquisite\nsimplicity,\" and \"undoubted talent.\" But strangers freely criticized,\nand Rose was so indignant at some of their remarks, she could not listen\nto anything on the stage, though a fine overture was played, a man with\na remarkable bass voice growled and roared melodiously, and the orphans\nsang a lively air with a chorus of \"Tra, la, la,\" which was a great\nrelief to little tongues unused to long silence.\n\n\"I've often heard that women's tongues were hung in the middle and went\nat both ends now I'm sure of it,\" whispered Charlie, trying to cheer her\nup by pointing out the comical effect of some seventy-five open mouths\nin each of which the unruly member was wagging briskly.\n\nRose laughed and let him fan her, leaning from his seat behind with the\ndevoted air he always assumed in public, but her wounded feelings were\nnot soothed and she continued to frown at the stout man on the left who\nhad dared to say with a shrug and a glance at Phebe's next piece, \"That\nyoung woman can no more sing this Italian thing than she can fly, and\nthey ought not to let her attempt it.\"\n\nPhebe did, however, and suddenly changed the stout man's opinion by\nsinging it grandly, for the consciousness of her first failure\npricked her pride and spurred her to do her best with the calm sort of\ndetermination which conquers fear, fires ambition, and changes defeat\nto success. She looked steadily at Rose now, or the flushed, intent face\nbeside her, and throwing all her soul into the task, let her voice\nring out like a silver clarion, filling the great hall and setting the\nhearers' blood a-tingle with the exulting strain.\n\nThat settled Phebe's fate as a cantatrice. The applause was genuine and\nspontaneous this time and broke out again and again with the generous\ndesire to atone for former coldness. But she would not return, and the\nshadow of the great organ seemed to have swallowed her up, for no eye\ncould find her, no pleasant clamor win her back.\n\n\"Now I can die content,\" said Rose, beaming with heartfelt satisfaction\nwhile Archie looked steadfastly at his program, trying to keep his face\nin order, and the rest of the family assumed a triumphant air, as if\nthey had never doubted from the first.\n\n\"Very well, indeed,\" said the stout man with an approving nod. \"Quite\npromising for a beginner. Shouldn't wonder if in time they made a second\nCary or Kellogg of her.\"\n\n\"Now you'll forgive him, won't you?\" murmured Charlie in his cousin's\near.\n\n\"Yes, and I'd like to pat him on the head. But take warning and never\njudge by first appearances again,\" whispered Rose, at peace now with all\nmankind.\n\nPhebe's last song was another ballad; she meant to devote her talent to\nthat much neglected but always attractive branch of her art. It was\na great surprise, therefore, to all but one person in the hall when,\ninstead of singing \"Auld Robin Grey,\" she placed herself at the piano,\nand, with a smiling glance over her shoulder at the children, broke out\nin the old bird song which first won Rose. But the chirping, twittering,\nand cooing were now the burden to three verses of a charming little\nsong, full of springtime and the awakening life that makes it lovely. A\nrippling accompaniment flowed through it all, and a burst of delighted\nlaughter from the children filled up the first pause with a fitting\nanswer to the voices that seemed calling to them from the vernal woods.\n\nIt was very beautiful, and novelty lent its charm to the surprise, for\nart and nature worked a pretty miracle and the clever imitation, first\nheard from a kitchen hearth, now became the favorite in a crowded\nconcert room. Phebe was quite herself again; color in the cheeks now;\neyes that wandered smiling to and fro; and lips that sang as gaily and\nfar more sweetly than when she kept time to her blithe music with a\nscrubbing brush.\n\nThis song was evidently intended for the children, and they appreciated\nthe kindly thought, for as Phebe went back among them, they clapped\necstatically, flapped their pinafores, and some caught her by the skirts\nwith audible requests to \"Do it again, please; do it again.\"\n\nBut Phebe shook her head and vanished, for it was getting late for such\nsmall people, several of whom \"lay sweetly slumbering there\" till roused\nby the clamor round them. The elders, however, were not to be denied and\napplauded persistently, especially Aunt Plenty, who seized Uncle Mac's\ncane and pounded with it as vigorously as \"Mrs. Nubbles\" at the play.\n\n\"Never mind your gloves, Steve; keep it up till she comes,\" cried\nCharlie, enjoying the fun like a boy while Jamie lost his head with\nexcitement and, standing up, called \"Phebe! Phebe!\" in spite of his\nmother's attempts to silence him.\n\nEven the stout man clapped, and Rose could only laugh delightedly as she\nturned to look at Archie, who seemed to have let himself loose at last\nand was stamping with a dogged energy funny to see.\n\nSo Phebe had to come, and stood there meekly bowing, with a moved look\non her face that showed how glad and grateful she was, till a sudden\nhush came; then, as if inspired by the memory of the cause that brought\nher there, she looked down into the sea of friendly faces before her,\nwith no trace of fear in her own, and sang the song that never will grow\nold.\n\nThat went straight to the hearts of those who heard her, for there was\nsomething inexpressibly touching in the sight of this sweet-voiced woman\nsinging of home for the little creatures who were homeless, and Phebe\nmade her tuneful plea irresistible by an almost involuntary gesture of\nthe hands which had hung loosely clasped before her till, with the last\necho of the beloved word, they fell apart and were half outstretched, as\nif pleading to be filled.\n\nIt was the touch of nature that works wonders, for it made full purses\nsuddenly weigh heavily in pockets slow to open, brought tears to eyes\nunused to weep, and caused that group of red-gowned girls to grow\nvery pathetic in the sight of fathers and mothers who had left little\ndaughters safe asleep at home. This was evident from the stillness that\nremained unbroken for an instant after Phebe ended; and before people\ncould get rid of their handkerchiefs she would have been gone if the\nsudden appearance of a mite in a pinafore, climbing up the stairs\nfrom the anteroom with a great bouquet grasped in both hands, had not\narrested her.\n\nUp came the little creature, intent on performing the mission for which\nrich bribes of sugarplums had been promised, and trotting bravely across\nthe stage, she held up the lovely nosegay, saying in her baby voice,\n\"Dis for you, ma'am.\" Then, startled by the sudden outburst of applause,\nshe hid her face in Phebe's gown and began to sob with fright.\n\nAn awkward minute for poor Phebe, but she showed unexpected presence\nof mind and left behind her a pretty picture of the oldest and youngest\norphan as she went quickly down the step, smiling over the great bouquet\nwith the baby on her arm.\n\nNobody minded the closing piece, for people began to go, sleepy children\nto be carried off, and whispers grew into a buzz of conversation. In the\ngeneral confusion Rose looked to see if Steve had remembered his promise\nto help Phebe slip away before the rush began. No, there he was putting\non Kitty's cloak, quite oblivious to any other duty. Turning to ask\nArchie to hurry out, Rose found that he had already vanished, leaving\nhis gloves behind him.\n\n\"Have you lost anything?\" asked Dr. Alec, catching a glimpse of her\nface.\n\n\"No, sir, I've found something,\" she whispered back, giving him the\ngloves to pocket along with her fan and glass, adding hastily as the\nconcert ended, \"Please, Uncle, tell them all not to come with us. Phebe\nhas had enough excitement and ought to rest.\"\n\nRose's word was law to the family in all things concerning Phebe. So\nword was passed that there were to be no congratulations until tomorrow,\nand Dr. Alec got his party off as soon as possible. But all the way\nhome, while he and Aunt Plenty were prophesying a brilliant future for\nthe singer, Rose sat rejoicing over the happy present of the woman.\nShe was sure that Archie had spoken and imagined the whole scene with\nfeminine delight how tenderly he had asked the momentous question, how\ngratefully Phebe had given the desired reply, and now how both were\nenjoying that delicious hour which Rose had been given to understand\nnever came but once. Such a pity to shorten it, she thought, and\nbegged her uncle to go home the longest way the night was so mild,\nthe moonlight so clear, and herself so in need of fresh air after the\nexcitement of the evening.\n\n\"I thought you would want to rush into Phebe's arms the instant she got\ndone,\" said Aunt Plenty, innocently wondering at the whims girls took\ninto their heads.\n\n\"So I should if I consulted my own wishes, but as Phebe asked to be let\nalone I want to gratify her,\" answered Rose, making the best excuse she\ncould.\n\n\"A little piqued,\" thought the doctor, fancying he understood the case.\n\nAs the old lady's rheumatism forbade their driving about till midnight,\nhome was reached much too soon, Rose thought, and tripped away to warn\nthe lovers the instant she entered the house. But study, parlor, and\nboudoir were empty; and, when Jane appeared with cake and wine, she\nreported that \"Miss Phebe went right upstairs and wished to be excused,\nplease, being very tired.\"\n\n\"That isn't at all like Phebe I hope she isn't ill,\" began Aunt Plenty,\nsitting down to toast her feet.\n\n\"She may be a little hysterical, for she is a proud thing and represses\nher emotions as long as she can. I'll step up and see if she doesn't\nneed a soothing draft of some sort.\" And Dr. Alec threw off his coat as\nhe spoke.\n\n\"No, no, she's only tired. I'll run up to her she won't mind me and I'll\nreport if anything is amiss.\"\n\nAway went Rose, quite trembling with suspense, but Phebe's door was\nshut, no light shone underneath, and no sound came from the room within.\nShe tapped and receiving no answer, went on to her own chamber, thinking\nto herself: \"Love always makes people queer, I've heard, so I suppose\nthey settled it all in the carriage and the dear thing ran away to think\nabout her happiness alone. I'll not disturb her. Why, Phebe!\" said Rose,\nsurprised, for, entering her room, there was the cantatrice, busy about\nthe nightly services she always rendered her little mistress.\n\n\"I'm waiting for you, dear. Where have you been so long?\" asked Phebe,\npoking the fire as if anxious to get some color into cheeks that were\nunnaturally pale.\n\nThe instant she spoke Rose knew that something was wrong, and a glance\nat her face confirmed the fear. It was like a dash of cold water and\nquenched her happy fancies in a moment; but being a delicate-minded\ngirl, she respected Phebe's mood and asked no questions, made no\ncomments, and left her friend to speak or be silent as she chose.\n\n\"I was so excited I would take a turn in the moonlight to calm my\nnerves. Oh, dearest Phebe, I am so glad, so proud, so full of wonder at\nyour courage and skill and sweet ways altogether that I cannot half tell\nyou how I love and honor you!\" she cried, kissing the white cheeks with\nsuch tender warmth they could not help glowing faintly as Phebe held\nher little mistress close, sure that nothing could disturb this innocent\naffection.\n\n\"It is all your work, dear, because but for you I might still be\nscrubbing floors and hardly dare to dream of anything like this,\" she\nsaid in her old grateful way, but in her voice there was a thrill of\nsomething deeper than gratitude, and at the last two words her head went\nup with a gesture of soft pride as if it had been newly crowned.\n\nRose heard and saw and guessed at the meaning of both tone and gesture,\nfeeling that her Phebe deserved both the singer's laurel and the bride's\nmyrtle wreath. But she only looked up, saying very wistfully: \"Then it\nhas been a happy night for you as well as for us.\"\n\n\"The happiest of my life, and the hardest,\" answered Phebe briefly as\nshe looked away from the questioning eyes.\n\n\"You should have let us come nearer and help you through. I'm afraid you\nare very proud, my Jenny Lind.\"\n\n\"I have to be, for sometimes I feel as if I had nothing else to keep\nme up.\" She stopped short there, fearing that her voice would prove\ntraitorous if she went on. In a moment she asked in a tone that was\nalmost hard: \"You think I did well tonight?\"\n\n\"They all think so, and were so delighted they wanted to come in a body\nand tell you so, but I sent them home because I knew you'd be tired out.\nPerhaps I ought not to have done it and you'd rather have had a crowd\nabout you than just me?\"\n\n\"It was the kindest thing you ever did, and what could I like better\nthan 'just you,' my darling?\"\n\nPhebe seldom called her that, and when she did her heart was in the\nlittle word, making it so tender that Rose thought it the sweetest in\nthe world, next to Uncle Alec's \"my little girl.\" Now it was almost\npassionate, and Phebe's face grew rather tragical as she looked down at\nRose. It was impossible to seem unconscious any longer, and Rose said,\ncaressing Phebe's cheek, which burned with a feverish color now: \"Then\ndon't shut me out if you have a trouble, but let me share it as I let\nyou share all mine.\"\n\n\"I will! Little mistress, I've got to go away, sooner even than we\nplanned.\"\n\n\"Why, Phebe?\"\n\n\"Because Archie loves me.\"\n\n\"That's the very reason you should stay and make him happy.\"\n\n\"Not if it caused dissension in the family, and you know it would.\"\n\nRose opened her lips to deny this impetuously, but checked herself and\nanswered honestly: \"Uncle and I would be heartily glad, and I'm sure\nAunt Jessie never could object if you loved Archie as he does you.\"\n\n\"She has other hopes, I think, and kind as she is, it would be a\ndisappointment if he brought me home. She is right, they all are, and I\nalone am to blame. I should have gone long ago I knew I should, but it\nwas so pleasant, I couldn't bear to go away alone.\"\n\n\"I kept you, and I am to blame if anyone, but indeed, dear Phebe, I\ncannot see why you should care even if Aunt Myra croaks and Aunt Clara\nexclaims or Aunt Jane makes disagreeable remarks. Be happy, and never\nmind them,\" cried Rose, so much excited by all this that she felt the\nspirit of revolt rise up within her and was ready to defy even that\nawe-inspiring institution \"the family\" for her friend's sake.\n\nBut Phebe shook her head with a sad smile and answered, still with the\nhard tone in her voice as if forcing back all emotion that she might see\nher duty clearly: \"You could do that, but I never can. Answer me this,\nRose, and answer truly as you love me. If you had been taken into a\nhouse, a friendless, penniless, forlorn girl, and for years been heaped\nwith benefits, trusted, taught, loved, and made, oh, so happy! could\nyou think it right to steal away something that these good people valued\nvery much? To have them feel that you had been ungrateful, had deceived\nthem, and meant to thrust yourself into a high place not fit for you\nwhen they had been generously helping you in other ways, far more than\nyou deserved. Could you then say as you do now, 'Be happy, and never\nmind them'?\"\n\nPhebe held Rose by the shoulders now and searched her face so keenly\nthat the other shrank a little, for the black eyes were full of fire and\nthere was something almost grand about this girl who seemed suddenly to\nhave become a woman. There was no need for words to answer the question\nso swiftly asked, for Rose put herself in Phebe's place in the drawing\nof a breath, and her own pride made her truthfully reply: \"No I could\nnot!\"\n\n\"I knew you'd say that, and help me do my duty.\" And all the coldness\nmelted out of Phebe's manner as she hugged her little mistress close,\nfeeling the comfort of sympathy even through the blunt sincerity of\nRose's words.\n\n\"I will if I know how. Now, come and tell me all about it.\" And,\nseating herself in the great chair which had often held them both, Rose\nstretched out her hands as if glad and ready to give help of any sort.\n\nBut Phebe would not take her accustomed place, for, as if coming to\nconfession, she knelt down upon the rug and, leaning on the arm of the\nchair, told her love story in the simplest words.\n\n\"I never thought he cared for me until a little while ago. I fancied it\nwas you, and even when I knew he liked to hear me sing I supposed it was\nbecause you helped, and so I did my best and was glad you were to be\na happy girl. But his eyes told the truth. Then I saw what I had been\ndoing and was frightened. He did not speak, so I believed, what is quite\ntrue, that he felt I was not a fit wife for him and would never ask me.\nIt was right I was glad of it, yet I was proud and, though I did not\nask or hope for anything, I did want him to see that I respected myself,\nremembered my duty, and could do right as well as he. I kept away. I\nplanned to go as soon as possible and resolved that at this concert I\nwould do so well, he should not be ashamed of poor Phebe and her one\ngift.\"\n\n\"It was this that made you so strange, then, preferring to go alone and\nrefusing every little favor at our hands?\" asked Rose, feeling very sure\nnow about the state of Phebe's heart.\n\n\"Yes, I wanted to do everything myself and not owe one jot of my\nsuccess, if I had any, to even the dearest friend I've got. It was bad\nand foolish of me, and I was punished by the first dreadful failure.\nI was so frightened, Rose! My breath was all gone, my eyes so dizzy I\ncould hardly see, and that great crowd of faces seemed so near, I dared\nnot look. If it had not been for the clock I never should have gotten\nthrough, and when I did, not knowing in the least how I'd sung, one look\nat your distressed face told me I'd failed.\"\n\n\"But I smiled, Phebe indeed I did as sweetly as I could, for I was sure\nit was only fright,\" protested Rose eagerly.\n\n\"So you did, but the smile was full of pity, not of pride, as I wanted\nit to be, and I rushed into a dark place behind the organ, feeling ready\nto kill myself. How angry and miserable I was! I set my teeth, clenched\nmy hands, and vowed that I would do well next time or never sing another\nnote. I was quite desperate when my turn came, and felt as if I could do\nalmost anything, for I remembered that he was there. I'm not sure how it\nwas, but it seemed as if I was all voice, for I let myself go, trying\nto forget everything except that two people must not be disappointed,\nthough I died when the song was done.\"\n\n\"Oh, Phebe, it was splendid! I nearly cried, I was so proud and glad to\nsee you do yourself justice at last.\"\n\n\"And he?\" whispered Phebe, with her face half hidden on the arm of the\nchair.\n\n\"Said not a word, but I saw his lips tremble and his eyes shine and I\nknew he was the happiest creature there, because I was sure he did think\nyou fit to be his wife and did mean to speak very soon.\"\n\nPhebe made no answer for a moment, seeming to forget the small success\nin the greater one which followed and to comfort her sore heart with the\nknowledge that Rose was right.\n\n\"He sent the flowers, he came for me, and, on the way home, showed me\nhow wrong I had been to doubt him for an hour. Don't ask me to tell that\npart, but be sure I was the happiest creature in the world then.\"\n\nAnd Phebe hid her face again, all wet with tender tears that fell soft\nand sudden as a summer shower.\n\nRose let them flow undisturbed while she silently caressed the bent\nhead, wondering, with a wistful look in her own wet eyes, what this\nmysterious passion was which could so move, ennoble, and beautify the\nbeings whom it blessed.\n\nAn impertinent little clock upon the chimneypiece striking eleven broke\nthe silence and reminded Phebe that she could not indulge in love dreams\nthere. She started up, brushed off her tears, and said resolutely: \"That\nis enough for tonight. Go happily to bed, and leave the troubles for\ntomorrow.\"\n\n\"But, Phebe, I must know what you said,\" cried Rose, like a child\ndefrauded of half its bedtime story.\n\n\"I said, 'No.'\"\n\n\"Ah! But it will change to 'yes' by and by, I'm sure of that so I'll\nlet you go to dream of him. The Campbells are rather proud of being\ndescendants of Robert the Bruce, but they have common sense and love you\ndearly, as you'll see tomorrow.\"\n\n\"Perhaps.\" And with a good night kiss, poor Phebe went away, to lie\nawake till dawn.\n\n\n\n\nChapter 8 BREAKERS AHEAD\n\nAnxious to smooth the way for Phebe, Rose was up betimes and slipped\ninto Aunt Plenty's room before the old lady had gotten her cap on.\n\n\"Aunty, I've something pleasant to tell you, and while you listen, I'll\nbrush your hair, as you like to have me,\" she began, well aware that the\nproposed process was a very soothing one.\n\n\"Yes, dear only don't be too particular, because I'm late and must hurry\ndown or Jane won't get things straight, and it does fidget me to have\nthe saltcellars uneven, the tea strainer forgotten, and your uncle's\npaper not aired,\" returned Miss Plenty, briskly unrolling the two gray\ncurls she wore at her temples.\n\nThen Rose, brushing away at the scanty back hair, led skillfully up to\nthe crisis of her tale by describing Phebe's panic and brave efforts to\nconquer it; all about the flowers Archie sent her; and how Steve forgot,\nand dear, thoughtful Archie took his place. So far it went well and Aunt\nPlenty was full of interest, sympathy, and approbation, but when Rose\nadded, as if it was quite a matter of course, \"So, on the way home, he\ntold her he loved her,\" a great start twitched the gray locks out of\nher hands as the old lady turned around, with the little curls standing\nerect, exclaiming, in undisguised dismay: \"Not seriously, Rose?\"\n\n\"Yes, Aunty, very seriously. He never jokes about such things.\"\n\n\"Mercy on us! What shall we do about it?\"\n\n\"Nothing, ma'am, but be as glad as we ought and congratulate him as soon\nas she says 'yes.'?\n\n\"Do you mean to say she didn't accept at once?\"\n\n\"She never will if we don't welcome her as kindly as if she belonged to\none of our best families, and I don't blame her.\"\n\n\"I'm glad the girl has so much sense. Of course we can't do anything of\nthe sort, and I'm surprised at Archie's forgetting what he owes to the\nfamily in this rash manner. Give me my cap, child I must speak to Alec\nat once.\" And Aunt Plenty twisted her hair into a button at the back of\nher head with one energetic twirl.\n\n\"Do speak kindly, Aunty, and remember that it was not Phebe's fault. She\nnever thought of this till very lately and began at once to prepare for\ngoing away,\" said Rose pleadingly.\n\n\"She ought to have gone long ago. I told Myra we should have trouble\nsomewhere as soon as I saw what a good-looking creature she was, and\nhere it is as bad as can be. Dear, dear! Why can't young people have a\nlittle prudence?\"\n\n\"I don't see that anyone need object if Uncle Jem and Aunt Jessie\napprove, and I do think it will be very, very unkind to scold poor Phebe\nfor being well-bred, pretty, and good, after doing all we could to make\nher so.\"\n\n\"Child, you don't understand these things yet, but you ought to feel\nyour duty toward your family and do all you can to keep the name\nas honorable as it always has been. What do you suppose our blessed\nancestress Lady Marget would say to our oldest boy taking a wife from\nthe poorhouse?\"\n\nAs she spoke, Miss Plenty looked up, almost apprehensively, at one\nof the wooden-faced old portraits with which her room was hung, as if\nasking pardon of the severe-nosed matron who stared back at her from\nunder the sort of blue dish cover which formed her headgear.\n\n\"As Lady Marget died about two hundred years ago, I don't care a pin\nwhat she would say, especially as she looks like a very narrow-minded,\nhaughty woman. But I do care very much what Miss Plenty Campbell says,\nfor she is a very sensible, generous, discreet, and dear old lady who\nwouldn't hurt a fly, much less a good and faithful girl who has been a\nsister to me. Would she?\" entreated Rose, knowing well that the elder\naunt led all the rest more or less.\n\nBut Miss Plenty had her cap on now and consequently felt herself\ntwice the woman she was without it, so she not only gave it a somewhat\nbelligerent air by setting it well up, but she shook her head decidedly,\nsmoothed down her stiff white apron, and stood up as if ready for\nbattle.\n\n\"I shall do my duty, Rose, and expect the same of others. Don't say any\nmore now I must turn the matter over in my mind, for it has come upon me\nsuddenly and needs serious consideration.\"\n\nWith which unusually solemn address she took up her keys and trotted\naway, leaving her niece to follow with an anxious countenance, uncertain\nwhether her championship had done good or ill to the cause she had at\nheart.\n\nShe was much cheered by the sound of Phebe's voice in the study, for\nRose was sure that if Uncle Alec was on their side all would be well.\nBut the clouds lowered again when they came in to breakfast, for Phebe's\nheavy eyes and pale cheeks did not look encouraging, while Dr. Alec was\nas sober as a judge and sent an inquiring glance toward Rose now and\nthen as if curious to discover how she bore the news.\n\nAn uncomfortable meal, though all tried to seem as usual and talked over\nlast night's events with all the interest they could. But the old peace\nwas disturbed by a word, as a pebble thrown into a quiet pool sends\ntelltale circles rippling its surface far and wide. Aunt Plenty, while\n\"turning the subject over in her mind,\" also seemed intent on upsetting\neverything she touched and made sad havoc in her tea tray; Dr. Alec\nunsociably read his paper; Rose, having salted instead of sugared her\noatmeal, absently ate it, feeling that the sweetness had gone out of\neverything; and Phebe, after choking down a cup of tea and crumbling a\nroll, excused herself and went away, sternly resolving not to be a bone\nof contention to this beloved family.\n\nAs soon as the door was shut Rose pushed away her plate and, going to\nDr. Alec, she peeped over the paper with such an anxious face that he\nput it down at once.\n\n\"Uncle, this is a serious matter, and we must take our stand at once,\nfor you are Phebe's guardian and I am her sister,\" began Rose with\npretty solemnity. \"You have often been disappointed in me,\" she\ncontinued, \"but I know I never shall be in you because you are too wise\nand good to let any worldly pride or prudence spoil your sympathy with\nArchie and our Phebe. You won't desert them, will you?\"\n\n\"Never!\" answered Dr. Alec with gratifying energy.\n\n\"Thank you! Thank you!\" cried Rose. \"Now, if I have you and Aunty on my\nside, I'm not afraid of anybody.\"\n\n\"Gently, gently, child. I don't intend to desert the lovers, but I\ncertainly shall advise them to consider well what they are about. I'll\nown I am rather disappointed, because Archie is young to decide his life\nin this way and Phebe's career seemed settled in another fashion. Old\npeople don't like to have their plans upset, you know,\" he added more\nlightly, for Rose's face fell as he went on.\n\n\"Old people shouldn't plan too much for the young ones, then. We are\nvery grateful, I'm sure, but we cannot always be disposed of in the\nmost prudent and sensible way, so don't set your hearts on little\narrangements of that sort, I beg,\" And Rose looked wondrous wise, for\nshe could not help suspecting even her best uncle of \"plans\" in her\nbehalf.\n\n\"You are quite right-we shouldn't, yet it is very hard to help it,\"\nconfessed Dr. Alec with a conscious air, and, returning hastily to the\nlovers, he added kindly: \"I was much pleased with the straightforward\nway in which Phebe came to me this morning and told me all about it, as\nif I really was her guardian. She did not own it in words, but it was\nperfectly evident that she loves Archie with all her heart, yet, knowing\nthe objections which will be made, very sensibly and bravely proposes\nto go away at once and end the matter as if that were possible, poor\nchild.\" And the tenderhearted man gave a sigh of sympathy that did Rose\ngood to hear and mollified her rising indignation at the bare idea of\nending Phebe's love affairs in such a summary way.\n\n\"You don't think she ought to go, I hope?\"\n\n\"I think she will go.\"\n\n\"We must not let her.\"\n\n\"We have no right to keep her.\"\n\n\"Oh, Uncle, surely we have! Our Phebe, whom we all love so much.\"\n\n\"You forget that she is a woman now, and we have no claim on her.\nBecause we've befriended her for years is the very reason we should not\nmake our benefits a burden, but leave her free, and if she chooses to do\nthis in spite of Archie, we must let her with a Godspeed.\"\n\nBefore Rose could answer, Aunt Plenty spoke out like one having\nauthority, for old-fashioned ways were dear to her soul and she thought\neven love affairs should be conducted with a proper regard to the powers\nthat be.\n\n\"The family must talk the matter over and decide what is best for\nthe children, who of course will listen to reason and do nothing ill\nadvised. For my part, I am quite upset by the news, but shall not commit\nmyself till I've seen Jessie and the boy. Jane, clear away, and bring me\nthe hot water.\"\n\nThat ended the morning conference. And, leaving the old lady to soothe\nher mind by polishing spoons and washing cups, Rose went away to find\nPhebe while the doctor retired to laugh over the downfall of brother\nMac's matchmaking schemes.\n\nThe Campbells did not gossip about their concerns in public, but being\na very united family, it had long been the custom to \"talk over\" any\ninteresting event which occurred to any member thereof, and everyone\ngave his or her opinion, advice, or censure with the utmost candor.\nTherefore the first engagement, if such it could be called, created a\ngreat sensation, among the aunts especially, and they were in as much of\na flutter as a flock of maternal birds when their young begin to hop out\nof the nest. So at all hours the excellent ladies were seen excitedly\nnodding their caps together as they discussed the affair in all its\nbearings, without ever arriving at any unanimous decision.\n\nThe boys took it much more calmly. Mac was the only one who came out\nstrongly in Archie's favor. Charlie thought the Chief ought to do better\nand called Phebe \"a siren who had bewitched the sage youth.\" Steve was\nscandalized and delivered long orations upon one's duty to society,\nkeeping the old name up, and the danger of m\u00c3\u00a9salliances, while all the\ntime he secretly sympathized with Archie, being much smitten with Kitty\nVan himself. Will and Geordie, unfortunately home for the holidays,\nconsidered it \"a jolly lark,\" and little Jamie nearly drove his elder\nbrother distracted by curious inquiries as to \"how folks felt when they\nwere in love.\"\n\nUncle Mac's dismay was so comical that it kept Dr. Alec in good spirits,\nfor he alone knew how deep was the deluded man's chagrin at the failure\nof the little plot which he fancied was prospering finely.\n\n\"I'll never set my heart on anything of the sort again, and the young\nrascals may marry whom they like. I'm prepared for anything now--so if\nSteve brings home the washerwoman's daughter, and Mac runs away with our\npretty chambermaid, I shall say, 'Bless you my children,' with mournful\nresignation, for, upon my soul, that is all that's left for a modern\nparent to do.\"\n\nWith which tragic burst, poor Uncle Mac washed his hands of the whole\naffair and buried himself in the countinghouse while the storm raged.\n\nAbout this time Archie might have echoed Rose's childish wish, that\nshe had not quite so many aunts, for the tongues of those interested\nrelatives made sad havoc with his little romance and caused him to long\nfervently for a desert island where he could woo and win his love in\ndelicious peace. That nothing of the sort was possible soon became\nevident, since every word uttered only confirmed Phebe's resolution to\ngo away and proved to Rose how mistaken she had been in believing that\nshe could bring everyone to her way of thinking.\n\nPrejudices are unmanageable things, and the good aunts, like most women,\npossessed a plentiful supply, so Rose found it like beating her head\nagainst a wall to try and convince them that Archie was wise in loving\npoor Phebe. His mother, who had hoped to have Rose for her daughter not\nbecause of her fortune, but the tender affection she felt for her put\naway her disappointment without a word and welcomed Phebe as kindly\nas she could for her boy's sake. But the girl felt the truth with the\nquickness of a nature made sensitive by love and clung to her resolve\nall the more tenaciously, though grateful for the motherly words that\nwould have been so sweet if genuine happiness had prompted them.\n\nAunt Jane called it romantic nonsense and advised strong measures \"kind,\nbut firm, Jessie.\" Aunt Clara was sadly distressed about \"what people\nwould say\" if one of \"our boys\" married a nobody's daughter. And Aunt\nMyra not only seconded her views by painting portraits of Phebe's\nunknown relations in the darkest colors but uttered direful prophecies\nregarding the disreputable beings who would start up in swarms the\nmoment the girl made a good match.\n\nThese suggestions so wrought upon Aunt Plenty that she turned a deaf\near to the benevolent emotions native to her breast and, taking refuge\nbehind \"our blessed ancestress, Lady Marget,\" refused to sanction any\nengagement which could bring discredit upon the stainless name which was\nher pride.\n\nSo it all ended where it began, for Archie steadily refused to listen\nto anyone but Phebe, and she as steadily reiterated her bitter \"No!\"\nfortifying herself half unconsciously with the hope that, by and by,\nwhen she had won a name, fate might be kinder.\n\nWhile the rest talked, she had been working, for every hour showed her\nthat her instinct had been a true one and pride would not let her stay,\nthough love pleaded eloquently. So, after a Christmas anything but\nmerry, Phebe packed her trunks, rich in gifts from those who generously\ngave her all but the one thing she desired, and, with a pocketful of\nletters to people who could further her plans, she went away to seek her\nfortune, with a brave face and a very heavy heart.\n\n\"Write often, and let me know all you do, my Phebe, and remember I shall\nnever be contented till you come back again,\" whispered Rose, clinging\nto her till the last.\n\n\"She will come back, for in a year I'm going to bring her home, please\nGod,\" said Archie, pale with the pain of parting but as resolute as she.\n\n\"I'll earn my welcome then perhaps it will be easier for them to give\nand me to receive it,\" answered Phebe, with a backward glance at the\ngroup of caps in the hall as she went down the steps on Dr. Alec's arm.\n\n\"You earned it long ago, and it is always waiting for you while I am\nhere. Remember that, and God bless you, my good girl,\" he said, with a\npaternal kiss that warmed her heart.\n\n\"I never shall forget it!\" And Phebe never did.\n\n\n\n\nChapter 9 NEW YEAR'S CALLS\n\n\"Now I'm going to turn over a new leaf, as I promised. I wonder what\nI shall find on the next page?\" said Rose, coming down on New Year's\nmorning with a serious face and a thick letter in her hand.\n\n\"Tired of frivolity, my dear?\" asked her uncle, pausing in his walk up\nand down the hall to glance at her with a quick, bright look she liked\nto bring into his eyes.\n\n\"No, sir, and that's the sad part of it, but I've made up my mind to\nstop while I can because I'm sure it is not good for me. I've had some\nvery sober thoughts lately, for since my Phebe went away I've had no\nheart for gaiety, so it is a good place to stop and make a fresh start,\"\nanswered Rose, taking his arm and walking on with him.\n\n\"An excellent time! Now, how are you going to fill the aching void?\" he\nasked, well pleased.\n\n\"By trying to be as unselfish, brave, and good as she is.\" And Rose held\nthe letter against her bosom with a tender touch, for Phebe's strength\nhad inspired her with a desire to be as self-reliant. \"I'm going to set\nabout living in earnest, as she has; though I think it will be harder\nfor me than for her, because she stands alone and has a career marked\nout for her. I'm nothing but a commonplace sort of girl, with no end\nof relations to be consulted every time I wink and a dreadful fortune\nhanging like a millstone round my neck to weigh me down if I try to fly.\nIt is a hard case, Uncle, and I get low in my mind when I think about\nit,\" sighed Rose, oppressed with her blessings.\n\n\"Afflicted child! How can I relieve you?\" And there was amusement as\nwell as sympathy in Dr. Alec's face as he patted the hand upon his arm.\n\n\"Please don't laugh, for I really am trying to be good. In the first\nplace, help me to wean myself from foolish pleasures and show me how\nto occupy my thoughts and time so that I may not idle about and dream\ninstead of doing great things.\"\n\n\"Good! We'll begin at once. Come to town with me this morning and see\nyour houses. They are all ready, and Mrs. Gardner has half a dozen\npoor souls waiting to go in as soon as you give the word,\" answered the\ndoctor promptly, glad to get his girl back again, though not surprised\nthat she still looked with regretful eyes at the Vanity Fair, always so\nenticing when we are young.\n\n\"I'll give it today, and make the new year a happy one to those poor\nsouls at least. I'm so sorry that it's impossible for me to go with you,\nbut you know I must help Aunty Plen receive. We haven't been here for\nso long that she had set her heart on having a grand time today, and I\nparticularly want to please her because I have not been as amiable as I\nought lately. I really couldn't forgive her for siding against Phebe.\"\n\n\"She did what she thought was right, so we must not blame her. I am\ngoing to make my New Year's calls today and, as my friends live down\nthat way, I'll get the list of names from Mrs. G. and tell the poor\nladies, with Miss Campbell's compliments, that their new home is ready.\nShall I?\"\n\n\"Yes, Uncle, but take all the credit to yourself, for I never should\nhave thought of it if you had not proposed the plan.\"\n\n\"Bless your heart! I'm only your agent, and suggest now and then. I've\nnothing to offer but advice, so I lavish that on all occasions.\"\n\n\"You have nothing because you've given your substance all away as\ngenerously as you do your advice. Never mind you shall never come to\nwant while I live. I'll save enough for us two, though I do make 'ducks\nand drakes of my fortune.'\"\n\nDr. Alec laughed at the toss of the head with which she quoted Charlie's\noffensive words, then offered to take the letter, saying, as he looked\nat his watch: \"I'll post that for you in time for the early mail. I like\na run before breakfast.\"\n\nBut Rose held her letter fast, dimpling with sudden smiles, half merry\nand half shy.\n\n\"No thank you, sir. Archie likes to do that, and never fails to call for\nall I write. He gets a peep at Phebe's in return and I cheer him up\na bit, for, though he says nothing, he has a hard time of it, poor\nfellow.\"\n\n\"How many letters in five days?\"\n\n\"Four, sir, to me. She doesn't write to him, Uncle.\"\n\n\"As yet. Well, you show hers, so it's all right and you are a set of\nsentimental youngsters.\" And the doctor walked away, looking as if he\nenjoyed the sentiment as much as any of them.\n\nOld Miss Campbell was nearly as great a favorite as young Miss Campbell,\nso a succession of black coats and white gloves flowed in and out of the\nhospitable mansion pretty steadily all day. The clan was out in great\nforce, and came by in installments to pay their duty to Aunt Plenty\nand wish the compliments of the season to \"our cousin.\" Archie appeared\nfirst, looking sad but steadfast, and went away with Phebe's letter in\nhis left breast pocket feeling that life was still endurable, though his\nlove was torn from him, for Rose had many comfortable things to say and\nread him delicious bits from the voluminous correspondence lately begun.\n\nHardly was he gone when Will and Geordie came marching in, looking\nas fine as gray uniforms with much scarlet piping could make them and\nfeeling peculiarly important, as this was their first essay in New\nYear's call-making. Brief was their stay, for they planned to visit\nevery friend they had, and Rose could not help laughing at the droll\nmixture of manly dignity and boyish delight with which they drove off\nin their own carriage, both as erect as ramrods, arms folded, and caps\nstuck at exactly the same angle on each blond head.\n\n\"Here comes the other couple Steve, in full feather, with a big bouquet\nfor Kitty, and poor Mac, looking like a gentleman and feeling like a\nmartyr, I'm sure,\" said Rose, watching one carriage turn in as the\nother turned out of the great gate, with its arch of holly, ivy, and\nevergreen.\n\n\"Here he is. I've got him in tow for the day and want you to cheer him\nup with a word of praise, for he came without a struggle though planning\nto bolt somewhere with Uncle,\" cried Steve, falling back to display his\nbrother, who came in looking remarkably well in his state and festival\narray, for polishing had begun to tell.\n\n\"A happy New Year, Aunty, same to you, Cousin, and best wishes for as\nmany more as you deserve,\" said Mac, heeding Steve no more than if he\nhad been a fly as he gave the old lady a hearty kiss and offered Rose a\nquaint little nosegay of pansies.\n\n\"Heart's-ease do you think I need it?\" she asked, looking up with sudden\nsobriety.\n\n\"We all do. Could I give you anything better on a day like this?\"\n\n\"No thank you very much.\" And a sudden dew came to Rose's eyes, for,\nthough often blunt in speech, when Mac did do a tender thing, it always\ntouched her because he seemed to understand her moods so well.\n\n\"Has Archie been here? He said he shouldn't go anywhere else, but I hope\nyou talked that nonsense out of his head,\" said Steve, settling his tie\nbefore the mirror.\n\n\"Yes, dear, he came but looked so out of spirits I really felt\nreproached. Rose cheered him up a little, but I don't believe he will\nfeel equal to making calls and I hope he won't, for his face tells the\nwhole story much too plainly,\" answered Aunty Plenty, rustling about her\nbountiful table in her richest black silk with all her old lace on.\n\n\"Oh, he'll get over it in a month or two, and Phebe will soon find\nanother lover, so don't be worried about him, Aunty,\" said Steve, with\nthe air of a man who knew all about that sort of thing.\n\n\"If Archie does forget, I shall despise him, and I know Phebe won't try\nto find another lover, though she'll probably have them she is so sweet\nand good!\" cried Rose indignantly, for, having taken the pair under her\nprotection, she defended them valiantly.\n\n\"Then you'd have Arch hope against hope and never give up, would you?\"\nasked Mac, putting on his glasses to survey the thin boots which were\nhis especial abomination.\n\n\"Yes, I would, for a lover is not worth having if he's not in earnest!\"\n\n\"Exactly. So you'd like them to wait and work and keep on loving till\nthey made you relent or plainly proved that it was no use.\"\n\n\"If they were good as well as constant, I think I should relent in\ntime.\"\n\n\"I'll mention that to Pemberton, for he seemed to be hit the hardest,\nand a ray of hope will do him good, whether he is equal to the ten\nyears' wait or not,\" put in Steve, who liked to rally Rose about her\nlovers.\n\n\"I'll never forgive you if you say a word to anyone. It is only Mac's\nodd way of asking questions, and I ought not to answer them. You will\ntalk about such things and I can't stop you, but I don't like it,\" said\nRose, much annoyed.\n\n\"Poor little Penelope! She shall not be teased about her suitors but\nleft in peace till her Ulysses comes home,\" said Mac, sitting down to\nread the mottoes sticking out of certain fanciful bonbons on the table.\n\n\"It is this fuss about Archie which has demoralized us all. Even the owl\nwaked up and hasn't got over the excitement yet, you see. He's had no\nexperience, poor fellow, so he doesn't know how to behave,\" observed\nSteve, regarding his bouquet with tender interest.\n\n\"That's true, and I asked for information because I may be in love\nmyself someday and all this will be useful, don't you see?\"\n\n\"You in love!\" And Steve could not restrain a laugh at the idea of the\nbookworm a slave to the tender passion.\n\nQuite unruffled, Mac leaned his chin in both hands, regarding them with\na meditative eye as he answered in his whimsical way: \"Why not? I intend\nto study love as well as medicine, for it is one of the most mysterious\nand remarkable diseases that afflict mankind, and the best way to\nunderstand it is to have it. I may catch it someday, and then I should\nlike to know how to treat and cure it.\"\n\n\"If you take it as badly as you did measles and whooping cough, it will\ngo hard with you, old fellow,\" said Steve, much amused with the fancy.\n\n\"I want it to. No great experience comes or goes easily, and this is the\ngreatest we can know, I believe, except death.\"\n\nSomething in Mac's quiet tone and thoughtful eyes made Rose look at him\nin surprise, for she had never heard him speak in that way before. Steve\nalso stared for an instant, equally amazed, then said below his breath,\nwith an air of mock anxiety: \"He's been catching something at the\nhospital, typhoid probably, and is beginning to wander. I'll take him\nquietly away before he gets any wilder. Come, old lunatic, we must be\noff.\"\n\n\"Don't be alarmed. I'm all right and much obliged for your advice, for I\nfancy I shall be a desperate lover when my time comes, if it ever does.\nYou don't think it impossible, do you?\" And Mac put the question so\nsoberly that there was a general smile.\n\n\"Certainly not you'll be a regular Douglas, tender and true,\" answered\nRose, wondering what queer question would come next.\n\n\"Thank you. The fact is, I've been with Archie so much in his trouble\nlately that I've gotten interested in this matter and very naturally\nwant to investigate the subject as every rational man must, sooner or\nlater, that's all. Now, Steve, I'm ready.\" And Mac got up as if the\nlesson was over.\n\n\"My dear, that boy is either a fool or a genius, and I'm sure I should\nbe glad to know which,\" said Aunt Plenty, putting her bonbons to rights\nwith a puzzled shake of her best cap.\n\n\"Time will show, but I incline to think that he is not a fool by any\nmeans,\" answered the girl, pulling a cluster of white roses out of her\nbosom to make room for the pansies, though they did not suit the blue\ngown half so well.\n\nJust then Aunt Jessie came in to help them receive, with Jamie to make\nhimself generally useful, which he proceeded to do by hovering around\nthe table like a fly about a honey pot when not flattening his nose\nagainst the windowpanes to announce excitedly, \"Here's another man\ncoming up the drive!\"\n\nCharlie arrived next in his most sunshiny humor, for anything social\nand festive was his delight, and when in this mood the Prince was quite\nirresistible. He brought a pretty bracelet for Rose and was graciously\nallowed to put it on while she chid him gently for his extravagance.\n\n\"I am only following your example, for you know 'nothing is too good\nfor those we love, and giving away is the best thing one can do,'\" he\nretorted, quoting words of her own.\n\n\"I wish you would follow my example in some other things as well as you\ndo in this,\" said Rose soberly as Aunt Plenty called him to come and see\nif the punch was right.\n\n\"Must conform to the customs of society. Aunty's heart would be broken\nif we did not drink her health in the good old fashion. But don't be\nalarmed I've a strong head of my own, and that's lucky, for I shall need\nit before I get through,\" laughed Charlie, showing a long list as\nhe turned away to gratify the old lady with all sorts of merry and\naffectionate compliments as the glasses touched.\n\nRose did feel rather alarmed, for if he drank the health of all the\nowners of those names, she felt sure that Charlie would need a very\nstrong head indeed. It was hard to say anything then and there without\nseeming disrespect to Aunt Plenty, yet she longed to remind her cousin\nof the example she tried to set him in this respect, for Rose never\ntouched wine, and the boys knew it. She was thoughtfully turning the\nbracelet, with its pretty device of turquoise forget-me-nots, when the\ngiver came back to her, still bubbling over with good spirits.\n\n\"Dear little saint, you look as if you'd like to smash all the punch\nbowls in the city, and save us jolly young fellows from tomorrow's\nheadache.\"\n\n\"I should, for such headaches sometimes end in heartaches, I'm afraid.\nDear Charlie, don't be angry, but you know better than I that this is a\ndangerous day for such as you so do be careful for my sake,\" she added,\nwith an unwonted touch of tenderness in her voice, for, looking at the\ngallant figure before her, it was impossible to repress the womanly\nlonging to keep it always as brave and blithe as now.\n\nCharlie saw that new softness in the eyes that never looked unkindly on\nhim, fancied that it meant more than it did, and, with a sudden fervor\nin his own voice, answered quickly: \"My darling, I will!\"\n\nThe glow which had risen to his face was reflected in hers, for at that\nmoment it seemed as if it would be possible to love this cousin who was\nso willing to be led by her and so much needed some helpful influence\nto make a noble man of him. The thought came and went like a flash, but\ngave her a quick heartthrob, as if the old affection was trembling\non the verge of some warmer sentiment, and left her with a sense of\nresponsibility never felt before. Obeying the impulse, she said, with a\npretty blending of earnestness and playfulness, \"If I wear the bracelet\nto remember you by, you must wear this to remind you of your promise.\"\n\n\"And you,\" whispered Charlie, bending his head to kiss the hands that\nput a little white rose in his buttonhole.\n\nJust at that most interesting moment they became aware of an arrival in\nthe front drawing room, whither Aunt Plenty had discreetly retired. Rose\nfelt grateful for the interruption, because, not being at all sure\nof the state of her heart as yet, she was afraid of letting a sudden\nimpulse lead her too far. But Charlie, conscious that a very propitious\ninstant had been spoiled, regarded the newcomer with anything but a\nbenignant expression of countenance and, whispering, \"Good-bye, my Rose,\nI shall look in this evening to see how you are after the fatigues of\nthe day,\" he went away, with such a cool nod to poor Fun See that the\namiable Asiatic thought he must have mortally offended him.\n\nRose had little leisure to analyze the new emotions of which she was\nconscious, for Mr. Tokio came up at once to make his compliments with\na comical mingling of Chinese courtesy and American awkwardness, and\nbefore he had got his hat on Jamie shouted with admiring energy: \"Here's\nanother! Oh, such a swell!\"\n\nThey now came thick and fast for many hours, and the ladies stood\nbravely at their posts till late into the evening. Then Aunt Jessie went\nhome, escorted by a very sleepy little son, and Aunt Plenty retired to\nbed, used up. Dr. Alec had returned in good season, for his friends were\nnot fashionable ones, but Aunt Myra had sent up for him in hot haste and\nhe had good-naturedly obeyed the summons. In fact, he was quite used to\nthem now, for Mrs. Myra, having tried a variety of dangerous diseases,\nhad finally decided upon heart complaint as the one most likely to keep\nher friends in a chronic state of anxiety and was continually sending\nword that she was dying. One gets used to palpitations as well as\neverything else, so the doctor felt no alarm but always went and\nprescribed some harmless remedy with the most amiable sobriety and\npatience.\n\nRose was tired but not sleepy and wanted to think over several things,\nso instead of going to bed she sat down before the open fire in the\nstudy to wait for her uncle and perhaps Charlie, though she did not\nexpect him so late.\n\nAunt Myra's palpitations must have been unusually severe, for the clock\nstruck twelve before Dr. Alec came, and Rose was preparing to end her\nreverie when the sound of someone fumbling at the hall door made her\njump up, saying to herself: \"Poor man! His hands are so cold he can't\nget his latchkey in. Is that you, Uncle?\" she added, running to admit\nhim, for Jane was slow and the night as bitter as it was brilliant.\n\nA voice answered, \"Yes.\" And as the door swung open, in walked, not Dr.\nAlec, but Charlie, who immediately took one of the hall chairs and sat\nthere with his hat on, rubbing his gloveless hands and blinking as if\nthe light dazzled him, as he said in a rapid, abrupt sort of tone, \"I\ntold you I'd come left the fellows keeping it up gloriously going to see\nthe old year out, you know. But I promised never break my word and here\nI am. Angel in blue, did you slay your thousands?\"\n\n\"Hush! The waiters are still about. Come to the study fire and warm\nyourself, you must be frozen,\" said Rose, going before to roll up the\neasy chair.\n\n\"Not at all never warmer looks very comfortable, though. Where's\nUncle?\" asked Charlie, following with his hat still on, his hands in his\npockets, and his eye fixed steadily on the bright head in front of him.\n\n\"Aunt Myra sent for him, and I was waiting up to see how she was,\"\nanswered Rose, busily mending the fire.\n\nCharlie laughed and sat down upon a corner of the library table. \"Poor\nold soul! What a pity she doesn't die before he is quite worn out.\nA little too much ether some of these times would send her off quite\ncomfortably, you know.\"\n\n\"Don't speak in that way. Uncle says imaginary troubles are often as\nhard to bear as real ones,\" said Rose, turning around displeased.\n\nTill now she had not fairly looked at him, for recollections of the\nmorning made her a little shy. His attitude and appearance surprised her\nas much as his words, and the quick change in her face seemed to remind\nhim of his manners. Getting up, he hastily took off his hat and stood\nlooking at her with a curiously fixed yet absent look as he said in the\nsame rapid, abrupt way, as if, when once started, he found it hard to\nstop, \"I beg pardon only joking very bad taste I know, and won't do it\nagain. The heat of the room makes me a little dizzy, and I think I got a\nchill coming out. It is cold I am frozen, I daresay though I drove like\nthe devil.\"\n\n\"Not that bad horse of yours, I hope? I know it is dangerous, so\nlate and alone,\" said Rose, shrinking behind the big chair as Charlie\napproached the fire, carefully avoiding a footstool in his way.\n\n\"Danger is exciting that's why I like it. No man ever called me a coward\nlet him try it once. I never give in and that horse shall not conquer\nme. I'll break his neck, if he breaks my spirit doing it. No I don't\nmean that never mind it's all right,\" and Charlie laughed in a way that\ntroubled her, because there was no mirth in it.\n\n\"Have you had a pleasant day?\" asked Rose, looking at him intently as he\nstood pondering over the cigar and match which he held, as if doubtful\nwhich to strike and which to smoke.\n\n\"Day? Oh, yes, capital. About two thousand calls, and a nice little\nsupper at the Club. Randal can't sing any more than a crow, but I left\nhim with a glass of champagne upside down, trying to give them my old\nfavorite:\n\n\"'Tis better to laugh than be sighing,\"\n\nand Charlie burst forth in that bacchanalian melody at the top of his\nvoice, waving an allumette holder over his head to represent Randal's\ninverted wineglass.\n\n\"Hush! You'll wake Aunty,\" cried Rose in a tone so commanding that he\nbroke off in the middle of a roulade to stare at her with a blank look\nas he said apologetically, \"I was merely showing how it should be done.\nDon't be angry, dearest look at me as you did this morning, and I'll\nswear never to sing another note if you say so. I'm only a little gay we\ndrank your health handsomely, and they all congratulated me. Told 'em\nit wasn't out yet. Stop, though I didn't mean to mention that. No matter\nI'm always in a scrape, but you always forgive me in the sweetest way.\nDo it now, and don't be angry, little darling.\" And, dropping the vase,\nhe went toward her with a sudden excitement that made her shrink behind\nthe chair.\n\nShe was not angry, but shocked and frightened, for she knew now what the\nmatter was and grew so pale, he saw it and asked pardon before she could\nutter a rebuke.\n\n\"We'll talk of that tomorrow. It is very late. Go home now, please,\nbefore Uncle comes,\" she said, trying to speak naturally yet betraying\nher distress by the tremor of her voice and the sad anxiety in her eyes.\n\n\"Yes, yes, I will go you are tired I'll make it all right tomorrow.\" And\nas if the sound of his uncle's name steadied him for an instant, Charlie\nmade for the door with an unevenness of gait which would have told the\nshameful truth if his words had not already done so. Before he reached\nit, however, the sound of wheels arrested him and, leaning against the\nwall, he listened with a look of dismay mingled with amusement creeping\nover his face. \"Brutus has bolted now I am in a fix. Can't walk home\nwith this horrid dizziness in my head. It's the cold, Rose, nothing\nelse, I do assure you, and a chill yes, a chill. See here! Let one of\nthose fellows there lend me an arm no use to go after that brute. Won't\nMother be frightened though when he gets home?\" And with that empty\nlaugh again, he fumbled for the door handle.\n\n\"No, no don't let them see you! Don't let anyone know! Stay here till\nUncle comes, and he'll take care of you. Oh, Charlie! How could you do\nit! How could you when you promised?\" And, forgetting fear in the sudden\nsense of shame and anguish that came over her, Rose ran to him, caught\nhis hand from the lock, and turned the key; then, as if she could not\nbear to see him standing there with that vacant smile on his lips, she\ndropped into a chair and covered up her face.\n\nThe cry, the act, and, more than all, the sight of the bowed head would\nhave sobered poor Charlie if it had not been too late. He looked about\nthe room with a vague, despairing look, as if to find reason fast\nslipping from his control, but heat and cold, excitement and reckless\npledging of many healths had done their work too well to make instant\nsobriety possible, and owning his defeat with a groan, he turned away\nand threw himself face-downward on the sofa, one of the saddest sights\nthe new year looked upon as it came in.\n\nAs she sat there with hidden eyes, Rose felt that something dear to her\nwas dead forever. The ideal, which all women cherish, look for, and too\noften think they have found when love glorifies a mortal man, is hard to\ngive up, especially when it comes in the likeness of the first lover who\ntouches a young girl's heart. Rose had just begun to feel that perhaps\nthis cousin, despite his faults, might yet become the hero that he\nsometimes looked, and the thought that she might be his inspiration was\ngrowing sweet to her, although she had not entertained it until\nvery lately. Alas, how short the tender dream had been, how rude the\nawakening! How impossible it would be ever again to surround that fallen\nfigure with all the romance of an innocent fancy or gift it with the\nhigh attributes beloved by a noble nature!\n\nBreathing heavily in the sudden sleep that kindly brought a brief\noblivion of himself, he lay with flushed cheeks, disordered hair, and\nat his feet the little rose that never would be fresh and fair again a\npitiful contrast now to the brave, blithe young man who went so gaily\nout that morning to be so ignominiously overthrown at night.\n\nMany girls would have made light of a trespass so readily forgiven by\nthe world, but Rose had not yet learned to offer temptation with a smile\nand shut her eyes to the weakness that makes a man a brute. It always\ngrieved or disgusted her to see it in others, and now it was very\nterrible to have it brought so near not in its worst form, by any means,\nbut bad enough to wring her heart with shame and sorrow and fill\nher mind with dark forebodings for the future. So she could only sit\nmourning for the Charlie that might have been while watching the Charlie\nthat was with an ache in her heart which found no relief till, putting\nher hands there as if to ease the pain, they touched the pansies, faded\nbut still showing gold among the somber purple, and then two great tears\ndropped on them as she sighed: \"Ah, me! I do need heart's-ease sooner\nthan I thought!\"\n\nHer uncle's step made her spring up and unlock the door, showing him\nsuch an altered face that he stopped short, ejaculating in dismay, \"Good\nheavens, child! What's the matter?\" adding, as she pointed to the sofa\nin pathetic silence, \"Is he hurt? ill? dead?\"\n\n\"No, Uncle, he is--\" She could not utter the ugly word but whispered\nwith a sob in her throat, \"Be kind to him,\" and fled away to her own\nroom, feeling as if a great disgrace had fallen on the house.\n\n\n\n\nChapter 10 THE SAD AND SOBER PART\n\n\"How will he look? What will he say? Can anything make us forget and be\nhappy again?\" were the first questions Rose asked herself as soon as she\nwoke from the brief sleep which followed a long, sad vigil. It seemed\nas if the whole world must be changed because a trouble darkened it for\nher. She was too young yet to know how possible it is to forgive much\ngreater sins than this, forget far heavier disappointments, outlive\nhigher hopes, and bury loves compared to which hers was but a girlish\nfancy. She wished it had not been so bright a day, wondered how her\nbirds could sing with such shrill gaiety, put no ribbon in her hair,\nand said, as she looked at the reflection of her own tired face in\nthe glass, \"Poor thing! You thought the new leaf would have something\npleasant on it. The story has been very sweet and easy to read so far,\nbut the sad and sober part is coming now.\"\n\nA tap at the door reminded her that, in spite of her afflictions,\nbreakfast must be eaten, and the sudden thought that Charlie might still\nbe in the house made her hurry to the door, to find Dr. Alec waiting for\nher with his morning smile. She drew him in and whispered anxiously, as\nif someone lay dangerously ill nearby, \"Is he better, Uncle? Tell me all\nabout it I can bear it now.\"\n\nSome men would have smiled at her innocent distress and told her this\nwas only what was to be expected and endured, but Dr. Alec believed in\nthe pure instincts that make youth beautiful, desired to keep them true,\nand hoped his girl would never learn to look unmoved by pain and pity\nupon any human being vanquished by a vice, no matter how trivial it\nseemed, how venial it was held. So his face grew grave, though his voice\nwas cheerful as he answered: \"All right, I daresay, by this time, for\nsleep is the best medicine in such cases. I took him home last night,\nand no one knows he came but you and I.\"\n\n\"No one ever shall. How did you do it, Uncle?\"\n\n\"Just slipped out of the long study window and got him cannily off, for\nthe air and motion, after a dash of cold water, brought him around, and\nhe was glad to be safely landed at home. His rooms are below, you know,\nso no one was disturbed, and I left him sleeping nicely.\"\n\n\"Thank you so much,\" sighed Rose. \"And Brutus? Weren't they frightened\nwhen he got back alone?\"\n\n\"Not at all. The sagacious beast went quietly to the stable, and the\nsleepy groom asked no questions, for Charlie often sends the horse round\nby himself when it is late or stormy. Rest easy, dear no eye but ours\nsaw the poor lad come and go, and we'll forgive it for love's sake.\"\n\n\"Yes, but not forget it. I never can, and he will never be again to me\nthe Charlie I've been so proud and fond of all these years. Oh, Uncle,\nsuch a pity! Such a pity!\"\n\n\"Don't break your tender heart about it, child, for it is not incurable,\nthank God! I don't make light of it, but I am sure that under better\ninfluences Charlie will redeem himself because his impulses are good and\nthis his only vice. I can hardly blame him for what he is, because his\nmother did the harm. I declare to you, Rose, I sometimes feel as if I\nmust break out against that woman and thunder in her ears that she is\nruining the immortal soul for which she is responsible to heaven!\"\n\nDr. Alec seldom spoke in this way, and when he did it was rather awful,\nfor his indignation was of the righteous sort and such thunder often\nrouses up a drowsy soul when sunshine has no effect. Rose liked it, and\nsincerely wished Aunt Clara had been there to get the benefit of the\noutbreak, for she needed just such an awakening from the self-indulgent\ndream in which she lived.\n\n\"Do it, and save Charlie before it is too late!\" she cried, kindling\nherself as she watched him, for he looked like a roused lion as he\nwalked about the room with his hand clenched and a spark in his eye,\nevidently in desperate earnest and ready to do almost anything.\n\n\"Will you help?\" he asked, stopping suddenly with a look that made her\nstand up straight and strong as she answered with an eager voice: \"I\nwill.\"\n\n\"Then don't love him yet.\"\n\nThat startled her, but she asked steadily, though her heart began to\nbeat and her color to come: \"Why not?\"\n\n\"Firstly, because no woman should give her happiness into the keeping\nof a man without fixed principles; secondly, because the hope of being\nworthy of you will help him more than any prayers or preaching of mine.\nThirdly, because it will need all our wit and patience to undo the work\nof nearly four and twenty years. You understand what I mean?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"Can you say 'no' when he asks you to say 'yes' and wait a little for\nyour happiness?\"\n\n\"I can.\"\n\n\"And will you?\"\n\n\"I will.\"\n\n\"Then I'm satisfied, and a great weight taken off my heart. I can't help\nseeing what goes on, or trembling when I think of you setting sail with\nno better pilot than poor Charlie. Now you answer as I hoped you would,\nand I am proud of my girl!\"\n\nThey had been standing with the width of the room between them, Dr.\nAlec looking very much like a commander issuing orders, Rose like a\nwell-drilled private obediently receiving them, and both wore the air\nof soldiers getting ready for a battle, with the bracing of nerves and\nquickening of the blood brave souls feel as they put on their armor. At\nthe last words he went to her, brushed back the hair, and kissed her on\nthe forehead with a tender sort of gravity and a look that made her\nfeel as if he had endowed her with the Victoria Cross for courage on the\nfield.\n\nNo more was said then, for Aunt Plenty called them down and the day's\nduties began. But that brief talk showed Rose what to do and fitted her\nto do it, for it set her to thinking of the duty one owes one's self in\nloving as in all the other great passions or experiences which make or\nmar a life.\n\nShe had plenty of time for quiet meditation that day because everyone\nwas resting after yesterday's festivity, and she sat in her little room\nplanning out a new year so full of good works, grand successes, and\nbeautiful romances that if it could have been realized, the Millennium\nwould have begun. It was a great comfort to her, however, and lightened\nthe long hours haunted by a secret desire to know when Charlie would\ncome and a secret fear of the first meeting. She was sure he would be\nbowed down with humiliation and repentance, and a struggle took place\nin her mind between the pity she could not help feeling and the\ndisapprobation she ought to show. She decided to be gentle, but very\nfrank; to reprove, but also to console; and to try to improve the\nsoftened moment by inspiring the culprit with a wish for all the virtues\nwhich make a perfect man.\n\nThe fond delusion grew quite absorbing, and her mind was full of it as\nshe sat watching the sun set from her western window and admiring with\ndreamy eyes the fine effect of the distant hills clear and dark against\na daffodil sky when the bang of a door made her sit suddenly erect in\nher low chair and say with a catch in her breath: \"He's coming! I must\nremember what I promised Uncle and be very firm.\"\n\nUsually Charlie announced his approach with music of some sort. Now he\nneither whistled, hummed, nor sang, but came so quietly Rose was sure\nthat he dreaded this meeting as much as she did and, compassionating\nhis natural confusion, did not look around as the steps drew near. She\nthought perhaps he would go down upon his knees, as he used to after a\nboyish offense, but hoped not, for too much humility distressed her, so\nshe waited for the first demonstration anxiously.\n\nIt was rather a shock when it came, however, for a great nosegay dropped\ninto her lap and a voice, bold and gay as usual, said lightly: \"Here she\nis, as pretty and pensive as you please. Is the world hollow, our\ndoll stuffed with sawdust, and do we want to go into a nunnery today,\nCousin?\"\n\nRose was so taken aback by this unexpected coolness that the flowers lay\nunnoticed as she looked up with a face so full of surprise, reproach,\nand something like shame that it was impossible to mistake its meaning.\nCharlie did not, and had the grace to redden deeply, and his eyes fell\nas he said quickly, though in the same light tone: \"I humbly apologize\nfor coming so late last night. Don't be hard upon me, Cousin. You know\nAmerica expects every man to do his duty on New Year's Day.\"\n\n\"I am tired of forgiving! You make and break promises as easily as you\ndid years ago, and I shall never ask you for another,\" answered Rose,\nputting the bouquet away, for the apology did not satisfy her and she\nwould not be bribed to silence.\n\n\"But, my dear girl, you are so very exacting, so peculiar in your\nnotions, and so angry about trifles that a poor fellow can't please you,\ntry as he will,\" began Charlie, ill at ease, but too proud to show half\nthe penitence he felt, not so much for the fault as for her discovery of\nit.\n\n\"I am not angry I am grieved and disappointed, for I expect every man to\ndo his duty in another way and keep his word to the uttermost, as I try\nto do. If that is exacting, I'm sorry, and won't trouble you with my\nold-fashioned notions anymore.\"\n\n\"Bless my soul! What a rout about nothing! I own that I forgot I know I\nacted like a fool and I beg pardon. What more can I do?\"\n\n\"Act like a man, and never let me be so terribly ashamed of you again as\nI was last night.\" And Rose gave a little shiver as she thought of it.\n\nThat involuntary act hurt Charlie more than her words, and it was his\nturn now to feel \"terribly ashamed,\" for the events of the previous\nevening were very hazy in his mind and fear magnified them greatly.\nTurning sharply away, he went and stood by the fire, quite at a loss how\nto make his peace this time, because Rose was so unlike herself. Usually\na word of excuse sufficed, and she seemed glad to pardon and forget;\nnow, though very quiet, there was something almost stern about her that\nsurprised and daunted him, for how could he know that all the while her\npitiful heart was pleading for him and the very effort to control it\nmade her a little hard and cold?\n\nAs he stood there, restlessly fingering the ornaments upon the\nchimneypiece, his eye brightened suddenly and, taking up the pretty\nbracelet lying there, he went slowly back to her, saying in a tone that\nwas humble and serious enough now: \"I will act like a man, and you shall\nnever be ashamed again. Only be kind to me. Let me put this on, and\npromise afresh this time I swear I'll keep it. Won't you trust me,\nRose?\"\n\nIt was very hard to resist the pleading voice and eyes, for this\nhumility was dangerous; and, but for Uncle Alec, Rose would have\nanswered \"yes.\" The blue forget-me-nots reminded her of her own promise,\nand she kept it with difficulty now, to be glad always afterward.\nPutting back the offered trinket with a gentle touch, she said firmly,\nthough she dared not look up into the anxious face bending toward her:\n\"No, Charlie I can't wear it. My hands must be free if I'm to help you\nas I ought. I will be kind, I will trust you, but don't swear anything,\nonly try to resist temptation, and we'll all stand by you.\"\n\nCharlie did not like that and lost the ground he had gained by saying\nimpetuously: \"I don't want anyone but you to stand by me, and I must be\nsure you won't desert me, else, while I'm mortifying soul and body to\nplease you, some stranger will come and steal your heart away from me.\nI couldn't bear that, so I give you fair warning, in such a case I'll\nbreak the bargain, and go straight to the devil.\"\n\nThe last sentence spoiled it all, for it was both masterful and defiant.\nRose had the Campbell spirit in her, though it seldom showed; as yet she\nvalued her liberty more than any love offered her, and she resented the\nauthority he assumed too soon resented it all the more warmly because\nof the effort she was making to reinstate her hero, who would insist\non being a very faulty and ungrateful man. She rose straight out of her\nchair, saying with a look and tone which rather startled her hearer and\nconvinced him that she was no longer a tenderhearted child but a woman\nwith a will of her own and a spirit as proud and fiery as any of\nher race: \"My heart is my own, to dispose of as I please. Don't shut\nyourself out of it by presuming too much, for you have no claim on me\nbut that of cousinship, and you never will have unless you earn it.\nRemember that, and neither threaten nor defy me anymore.\"\n\nFor a minute it was doubtful whether Charlie would answer this flash\nwith another, and a general explosion ensue, or wisely quench the flame\nwith the mild answer which turneth away wrath. He chose the latter\ncourse and made it very effective by throwing himself down before his\noffended goddess, as he had often done in jest. This time it was not\nacting, but serious, earnest, and there was real passion in his voice\nas he caught Rose's dress in both hands, saying eagerly: \"No, no! Don't\nshut your heart against me or I shall turn desperate. I'm not half good\nenough for such a saint as you, but you can do what you will with me. I\nonly need a motive to make a man of me, and where can I find a stronger\none than in trying to keep your love?\"\n\n\"It is not yours yet,\" began Rose, much moved, though all the while she\nfelt as if she were on a stage and had a part to play, for Charlie\nhad made life so like a melodrama that it was hard for him to be quite\nsimple even when most sincere.\n\n\"Let me earn it, then. Show me how, and I'll do anything, for you are my\ngood angel, Rose, and if you cast me off, I feel as if I shouldn't care\nhow soon there was an end of me,\" cried Charlie, getting tragic in his\nearnestness and putting both arms around her, as if his only safety lay\nin clinging to this beloved fellow creature.\n\nBehind footlights it would have been irresistible, but somehow it did\nnot touch the one spectator, though she had neither time nor skill to\ndiscover why. For all their ardor the words did not ring quite true.\nDespite the grace of the attitude, she would have liked him better\nmanfully erect upon his feet, and though the gesture was full of\ntenderness, a subtle instinct made her shrink away as she said with\na composure that surprised herself even more than it did him: \"Please\ndon't. No, I will promise nothing yet, for I must respect the man I\nlove.\"\n\nThat brought Charlie to his feet, pale with something deeper than anger,\nfor the recoil told him more plainly than the words how much he had\nfallen in her regard since yesterday. The memory of the happy moment\nwhen she gave the rose with that new softness in her eyes, the shy\ncolor, the sweet \"for my sake\" came back with sudden vividness,\ncontrasting sharply with the now averted face, the hand outstretched to\nput him back, the shrinking figure, and in that instant's silence, poor\nCharlie realized what he had lost, for a girl's first thought of love is\nas delicate a thing as the rosy morning glory, which a breath of air\ncan shatter. Only a hint of evil, only an hour's debasement for him,\na moment's glimpse for her of the coarser pleasures men know, and the\ninnocent heart, just opening to bless and to be blessed, closed again\nlike a sensitive plant and shut him out perhaps forever.\n\nThe consciousness of this turned him pale with fear, for his love was\ndeeper than she knew, and he proved this when he said in a tone so full\nof mingled pain and patience that it touched her to the heart: \"You\nshall respect me if I can make you, and when I've earned it, may I hope\nfor something more?\"\n\nShe looked up then, saw in his face the noble shame, the humble sort\nof courage that shows repentance to be genuine and gives promise of\nsuccess, and, with a hopeful smile that was a cordial to him, answered\nheartily: \"You may.\"\n\n\"Bless you for that! I'll make no promises, I'll ask for none only trust\nme, Rose, and while you treat me like a cousin, remember that no matter\nhow many lovers you may have you'll never be to any of them as dear as\nyou are to me.\"\n\nA traitorous break in his voice warned Charlie to stop there, and with\nno other good-bye, he very wisely went away, leaving Rose to put the\nneglected flowers into water with remorseful care and lay away the\nbracelet, saying to herself: \"I'll never wear it till I feel as I did\nbefore. Then he shall put it on and I'll say 'yes.'\"\n\n\n\n\nChapter 11 SMALL TEMPTATIONS\n\n\"Oh, Rose, I've got something so exciting to tell you!\" cried Kitty Van\nTassel, skipping into the carriage next morning when her friend called\nfor her to go shopping.\n\nKitty always did have some \"perfectly thrilling\" communication to make\nand Rose had learned to take them quietly, but the next demonstration\nwas a new one, for, regardless alike of curious observers outside and\ndisordered hats within, Kitty caught Rose around the neck, exclaiming in\na rapturous whisper: \"My dearest creature, I'm engaged!\"\n\n\"I'm so glad! Of course it is Steve?\"\n\n\"Dear fellow, he did it last night in the nicest way, and Mama is so\ndelighted. Now what shall I be married in?\" And Kitty composed herself\nwith a face full of the deepest anxiety.\n\n\"How can you talk of that so soon? Why, Kit, you unromantic girl, you\nought to be thinking of your lover and not your clothes,\" said Rose,\namused yet rather scandalized at such want of sentiment.\n\n\"I am thinking of my lover, for he says he will not have a long\nengagement, so I must begin to think about the most important things at\nonce, mustn't I?\"\n\n\"Ah, he wants to be sure of you, for you are such a slippery creature\nhe is afraid you'll treat him as you did poor Jackson and the rest,\"\ninterrupted Rose, shaking her finger at her prospective cousin, who had\ntried this pastime twice before and was rather proud than otherwise of\nher brief engagements.\n\n\"You needn't scold, for I know I'm right, and when you've been in\nsociety as long as I have you'll find that the only way to really know a\nman is to be engaged to him. While they want you they are all devotion,\nbut when they think they've got you, then you find out what wretches\nthey are,\" answered Kitty with an air of worldly wisdom which contrasted\noddly with her youthful face and giddy manners.\n\n\"A sad prospect for poor Steve, unless I give him a hint to look well to\nhis ways.\"\n\n\"Oh, my dear child, I'm sure of him, for my experience has made me very\nsharp and I'm convinced I can manage him without a bit of trouble. We've\nknown each other for ages\" Steve was twenty and Kitty eighteen \"and\nalways been the best of friends. Besides, he is quite my ideal man. I\nnever could bear big hands and feet, and his are simply adorable. Then\nhe's the best dancer I know and dresses in perfect taste. I really do\nbelieve I fell in love with his pocket handkerchiefs first, they were so\nenchanting I couldn't resist,\" laughed Kitty, pulling a large one out\nof her pocket and burying her little nose in the folds, which shed a\ndelicious fragrance upon the air.\n\n\"Now, that looks promising, and I begin to think you have got a little\nsentiment after all,\" said Rose, well pleased, for the merry brown eyes\nhad softened suddenly and a quick color came up in Kitty's cheek as she\nanswered, still half hiding her face in the beloved handkerchief: \"Of\ncourse I have, lots of it, only I'm ashamed to show it to most people,\nbecause it's the style to take everything in the most nonchalant way. My\ngracious, Rose, you'd have thought me a romantic goose last night while\nSteve proposed in the back parlor, for I actually cried, he was so\ndreadfully in earnest when I pretended that I didn't care for him, and\nso very dear and nice when I told the truth. I didn't know he had it in\nhim, but he came out delightfully and never cared a particle, though I\ndropped tears all over his lovely shirtfront. Wasn't that good of him?\nFor you know he hates his things to be mussed.\"\n\n\"He's a true Campbell, and has got a good warm heart of his own under\nthose fine fronts of his. Aunt Jane doesn't believe in sentiment, so\nhe has been trained never to show any, but it is there, and you must\nencourage him to let it out, not foolishly, but in a way to make him\nmore manly and serious.\"\n\n\"I will if I can, for though I wouldn't own this to everybody, I like it\nin him very much and feel as if Steve and I should get on beautifully.\nHere we are now, be sure not to breathe a word if we meet anyone. I want\nit to be a profound secret for a week at least,\" added Kitty, whisking\nher handkerchief out of sight as the carriage stopped before the\nfashionable store they were about to visit.\n\nRose promised with a smile, for Kitty's face betrayed her without\nwords, so full was it of the happiness which few eyes fail to understand\nwhenever they see it.\n\n\"Just a glance at the silks. You ask my opinion about white ones, and\nI'll look at the colors. Mama says satin, but that is out now, and I've\nset my heart on the heaviest corded thing I can find,\" whispered Kitty\nas they went rustling by the long counters strewn with all that could\ndelight the feminine eye and tempt the feminine pocket.\n\n\"Isn't that opal the loveliest thing you ever saw? I'm afraid I'm too\ndark to wear it, but it would just suit you. You'll need a variety, you\nknow,\" added Kitty in a significant aside as Rose stood among the white\nsilks while her companion affected great interest in the delicate hues\nlaid before her.\n\n\"But I have a variety now, and don't need a new dress of any sort.\"\n\n\"No matter, get it, else it will be gone. You've worn all yours several\ntimes already and must have a new one whether you need it or not. Dear\nme! If I had as much pocket money as you have, I'd come out in a fresh\ntoilet at every party I went to,\" answered Kitty, casting an envious eye\nupon the rainbow piles before her.\n\nThe quick-witted shopman saw that a wedding was afoot, for when two\npretty girls whisper, smile, and blush over their shopping, clerks\nscent bridal finery and a transient gleam of interest brightens their\nimperturbable countenances and lends a brief energy to languid voices\nweary with crying, \"Cash!\" Gathering both silks with a practiced turn\nof the hand, he held them up for inspection, detecting at a glance which\nwas the bride-elect and which the friend, for Kitty fell back to study\nthe effect of silvery white folds with an absorbing interest impossible\nto mistake while Rose sat looking at the opal as if she scarcely heard a\nbland voice saying, with the rustle of silk so dear to girlish ears:\n\"A superb thing, just opened; all the rage in Paris; very rare shade;\ntrying to most, as the lady says, but quite perfect for a blonde.\"\n\nRose was not listening to those words but to others which Aunt Clara had\nlately uttered, laughed at then, but thought over more than once since.\n\n\"I'm tired of hearing people wonder why Miss Campbell does not dress\nmore. Simplicity is all very well for schoolgirls and women who can't\nafford anything better, but you can, and you really ought. Your things\nare pretty enough in their way, and I rather like you to have a style\nof your own, but it looks odd and people will think you are mean if\nyou don't make more show. Besides, you don't do justice to your beauty,\nwhich would be both peculiar and striking if you'd devote your mind to\ngetting up ravishing costumes.\"\n\nMuch more to the same effect did her aunt say, discussing the subject\nquite artistically and unconsciously appealing to several of Rose's\nruling passions. One was a love for the delicate fabrics, colors, and\nornaments which refined tastes enjoy and whose costliness keeps them\nfrom ever growing common; another, her strong desire to please the eyes\nof those she cared for and gratify their wishes in the smallest matter\nif she could. And last, but not least, the natural desire of a young and\npretty woman to enhance the beauty which she so soon discovers to be her\nmost potent charm for the other sex, her passport to a high place among\nher maiden peers.\n\nShe had thought seriously of surprising and delighting everyone by\nappearing in a costume which should do justice to the loveliness which\nwas so modest that it was apt to forget itself in admiring others what\ngirls call a \"ravishing\" dress, such as she could imagine and easily\nprocure by the magic of the Fortunatus' purse in her pocket. She\nhad planned it all, the shimmer of pale silk through lace like woven\nfrostwork, ornaments of some classic pattern, and all the dainty\naccessories as perfect as time, taste, and money could make them.\n\nShe knew that Uncle Alec's healthful training had given her a figure\nthat could venture on any fashion and Nature blessed her with a\ncomplexion that defied all hues. So it was little wonder that she felt\na strong desire to use these gifts, not for the pleasure of display, but\nto seem fair in the eyes that seldom looked at her without a tender sort\nof admiration, all the more winning when no words marred the involuntary\nhomage women love.\n\nThese thoughts were busy in Rose's mind as she sat looking at the lovely\nsilk and wondering what Charlie would say if she should some night burst\nupon him in a pale rosy cloud, like the Aurora to whom he often likened\nher. She knew it would please him very much and she longed to do all she\nhonestly could to gratify the poor fellow, for her tender heart already\nfelt some remorseful pangs, remembering how severe she had been the\nnight before. She could not revoke her words, because she meant them\nevery one, but she might be kind and show that she did not wholly shut\nhim out from her regard by asking him to go with her to Kitty's ball\nand gratify his artistic taste by a lovely costume. A very girlish but\nkindly plan, for that ball was to be the last of her frivolities, so\nshe wanted it to be a pleasant one and felt that \"being friends\" with\nCharlie would add much to her enjoyment.\n\nThis idea made her fingers tighten on the gleaming fabric so temptingly\nupheld, and she was about to take it when, \"If ye please, sir, would\nye kindly tell me where I'd be finding the flannel place?\" said a voice\nbehind her, and, glancing up, she saw a meek little Irishwoman looking\nquite lost and out of place among the luxuries around her.\n\n\"Downstairs, turn to the left,\" was the clerk's hasty reply, with a\nvague wave of the hand which left the inquirer more in the dark than\never.\n\nRose saw the woman's perplexity and said kindly, \"I'll show you this\nway.\"\n\n\"I'm ashamed to be throublin' ye, miss, but it's strange I am in it, and\nwouldn't be comin' here at all, at all, barrin' they tould me I'd get\nthe bit I'm wantin' chaper in this big shop than the little ones more\nbecomin' the like o' me,\" explained the little woman humbly.\n\nRose looked again as she led the way through a well-dressed crowd of\nbusy shoppers, and something in the anxious, tired face under the old\nwoolen hood the bare, purple hands holding fast a meager wallet and a\nfaded scrap of the dotted flannel little children's frocks are so often\nmade of touched the generous heart that never could see want without\nan impulse to relieve it. She had meant only to point the way, but,\nfollowing a new impulse, she went on, listening to the poor soul's\nmotherly prattle about \"me baby\" and the \"throuble\" it was to \"find\nclothes for the growin' childer when me man is out av work and the\nbit and sup inconvaynient these hard times\" as they descended to that\ndarksome lower world where necessities take refuge when luxuries crowd\nthem out from the gayer place above.\n\nThe presence of a lady made Mrs. Sullivan's shopping very easy now, and\nher one poor \"bit\" of flannel grew miraculously into yards of several\ncolors, since the shabby purse was no lighter when she went away, wiping\nher eyes on the corner of a big, brown bundle. A very little thing, and\nno one saw it but a wooden-faced clerk, who never told, yet it did Rose\ngood and sent her up into the light again with a sober face, thinking\nself-reproachfully, \"What right have I to more gay gowns when some poor\nbabies have none, or to spend time making myself fine while there is so\nmuch bitter want in the world?\"\n\nNevertheless the pretty things were just as tempting as ever, and she\nyearned for the opal silk with a renewed yearning when she got back. It\nis not certain that it would not have been bought in spite of her better\nself if a good angel in the likeness of a stout lady with silvery curls\nabout the benevolent face, enshrined in a plain bonnet, had not accosted\nher as she joined Kitty, still brooding over the wedding gowns.\n\n\"I waited a moment for you, my dear, because I'm in haste, and very glad\nto save myself a journey or a note,\" began the newcomer in a low tone as\nRose shook hands with the most affectionate respect. \"You know the great\nbox factory was burned a day or two ago and over a hundred girls thrown\nout of work. Some were hurt and are in the hospital, many have no homes\nto go to, and nearly all need temporary help of some sort. We've had\nso many calls this winter I hardly know which way to turn, for want is\npressing, and I've had my finger in so many purses I'm almost ashamed\nto ask again. Any little contribution ah, thank you, I was sure you\nwouldn't fail me, my good child,\" and Mrs. Gardener warmly pressed the\nhand that went so quickly into the little porte-monnaie and came out so\ngenerously filled.\n\n\"Let me know how else I can help, and thank you very much for allowing\nme to have a share in your good works,\" said Rose, forgetting all\nabout gay gowns as she watched the black bonnet go briskly away with an\napproving smile on the fine old face inside it.\n\n\"You extravagant thing! How could you give so much?\" whispered Kitty,\nwhose curious eye had seen three figures on the single bill which had so\nrapidly changed hands.\n\n\"I believe if Mrs. Gardener asked me for my head I should give it to\nher,\" answered Rose lightly, then, turning to the silks, she asked,\n\"Which have you decided upon, the yellow white or the blue, the corded\nor the striped?\"\n\n\"I've decided nothing; except that you are to have the pink and wear it\nat my ahem! ball,\" said Kitty, who had made up her mind, but could not\ngive her orders till Mama had been consulted.\n\n\"No, I can't afford it just yet. I never overstep my allowance, and I\nshall have to if I get any more finery. Come, we ought not to waste time\nhere if you have all the patterns you want.\" And Rose walked quickly\naway, glad that it was out of her power to break through two resolutions\nwhich hitherto had been faithfully kept one to dress simply for\nexample's sake, the other not to be extravagant for charity's sake.\n\nAs Rosamond had her day of misfortunes, so this seemed to be one of\nsmall temptations to Rose. After she had set Kitty down at home and been\nto see her new houses, she drove about doing various errands for the\naunts and, while waiting in the carriage for the execution of an order,\nyoung Pemberton came by.\n\nAs Steve said, this gentleman had been \"hard hit\" and still hovered\nmothlike about the forbidden light. Being the most eligible parti of the\nseason, his regard was considered a distinction to be proud of, and Rose\nhad been well scolded by Aunt Clara for refusing so honorable a mate.\nThe girl liked him, and he was the suitor of whom she had spoken so\nrespectfully to Dr. Alec because he had no need of the heiress and had\nsincerely loved Rose. He had been away, and she hoped had gotten over\nhis disappointment as happily as the rest, but now when he saw her,\nand came hurrying up so hungry for a word, she felt that he had not\nforgotten and was too kind to chill him with the bow which plainly says\n\"Don't stop.\"\n\nA personable youth was Pemberton, and had brought with him from the\nwilds of Canada a sable-lined overcoat which was the envy of every\nmasculine and the admiration of every feminine friend he had, and as he\nstood at her carriage window Rose knew that this luxurious garment\nand its stalwart wearer were objects of interest to the passersby. It\nchanced that the tide of shoppers flowed in that direction and, as she\nchatted, familiar faces often passed with glances, smiles, and nods of\nvarying curiosity, significance, and wonder.\n\nShe could not help feeling a certain satisfaction in giving him a\nmoment's pleasure, since she could do no more, but it was not that\namiable desire alone which made her ignore the neat white parcels which\nthe druggist's boy deposited on the front seat and kept her lingering a\nlittle longer to enjoy one of the small triumphs which girls often risk\nmore than a cold in the head to display. The sight of several snowflakes\non the broad shoulders which partially obstructed her view, as well as\nthe rapidly increasing animation of Pemberton's chat, reminded her that\nit was high time to go.\n\n\"I mustn't keep you it is beginning to storm,\" she said, taking up her\nmuff, much to old Jacob's satisfaction, for small talk is not exciting\nto a hungry man whose nose feels like an icicle.\n\n\"Is it? I thought the sun was shining.\" And the absorbed gentleman\nturned to the outer world with visible reluctance, for it looked very\nwarm and cozy in the red-lined carriage.\n\n\"Wise people say we must carry our sunshine with us,\" answered Rose,\ntaking refuge in commonplaces, for the face at the window grew pensive\nsuddenly as he answered, with a longing look, \"I wish I could.\" Then,\nsmiling gratefully, he added, \"Thank you for giving me a little of\nyours.\"\n\n\"You are very welcome.\" And Rose offered him her hand while her eyes\nmutely asked pardon for withholding her leave to keep it.\n\nHe pressed it silently and, shouldering the umbrella which he forgot to\nopen, turned away with an \"up again and take another\" expression, which\ncaused the soft eyes to follow him admiringly.\n\n\"I ought not to have kept him a minute longer than I could help, for it\nwasn't all pity; it was my foolish wish to show off and do as I liked\nfor a minute, to pay for being good about the gown. Oh, me! How weak\nand silly I am in spite of all my trying!\" And Miss Campbell fell into a\nremorseful reverie, which lasted till she got home.\n\n\"Now, young man, what brought you out in this driving storm?\" asked Rose\nas Jamie came stamping in that same afternoon.\n\n\"Mama sent you a new book thought you'd like it. I don't mind your\nold storms!\" replied the boy, wrestling his way out of his coat and\npresenting a face as round and red and shiny as a well-polished Baldwin\napple.\n\n\"Much obliged it is just the day to enjoy it and I was longing for\nsomething nice to read,\" said Rose as Jamie sat down upon the lower\nstair for a protracted struggle with his rubber boots.\n\n\"Here you are, then no yes I do believe I've forgotten it, after all!\"\ncried Jamie, slapping his pockets one after the other with a dismayed\nexpression of countenance.\n\n\"Never mind, I'll hunt up something else. Let me help you with those\nyour hands are so cold.\" And Rose good-naturedly gave a tug at the boots\nwhile Jamie clutched the banisters, murmuring somewhat incoherently\nas his legs flew up and down: \"I'll go back if you want me to. I'm so\nsorry! It's very good of you, I'm sure. Getting these horrid things on\nmade me forget. Mother would make me wear 'em, though I told her they'd\nstick like like gumdrops,\" he added, inspired by recollections of\ncertain dire disappointments when the above-mentioned sweetmeat melted\nin his pockets and refused to come out.\n\n\"Now what shall we do?\" asked Rose when he was finally extricated.\n\"Since I've nothing to read, I may as well play.\"\n\n\"I'll teach you to pitch and toss. You catch very well for a girl, but\nyou can't throw worth a cent,\" replied Jamie, gamboling down the hall\nin his slippers and producing a ball from some of the mysterious\nreceptacles in which boys have the art of storing rubbish enough to fill\na peck measure.\n\nOf course Rose agreed and cheerfully risked getting her eyes blackened\nand her fingers bruised till her young receptor gratefully observed that\n\"it was no fun playing where you had to look out for windows and jars\nand things, so I'd like that jolly book about Captain Nemo and the\nNautilus, please.\"\n\nBeing gratified, he spread himself upon the couch, crossed his legs in\nthe air, and without another word dived Twenty Thousand Leagues\nUnder the Sea, where he remained for two mortal hours, to the general\nsatisfaction of his relatives.\n\nBereft both of her unexpected playfellow and the much desired book, Rose\nwent into the parlor, there to discover a French novel which Kitty\nhad taken from a library and left in the carriage among the bundles.\nSettling herself in her favorite lounging chair, she read as diligently\nas Jamie while the wind howled and snow fell fast without.\n\nFor an hour nothing disturbed the cozy quiet of the house for Aunt\nPlenty was napping upstairs and Dr. Alec writing in his own sanctum; at\nleast Rose thought so, till his step made her hastily drop the book and\nlook up with very much the expression she used to wear when caught in\nmischief years ago.\n\n\"Did I startle you? Have a screen you are burning your face before this\nhot fire.\" And Dr. Alec pulled one forward.\n\n\"Thank you, Uncle. I didn't feel it.\" And the color seemed to deepen in\nspite of the screen while the uneasy eyes fell upon the book in her lap.\n\n\"Have you got the Quarterly there? I want to glance at an article in it\nif you can spare it for a moment,\" he said, leaning toward her with an\ninquiring glance.\n\n\"No, sir, I am reading.\" And, without mentioning the name, Rose put the\nbook into his hand.\n\nThe instant his eye fell on the title he understood the look she wore\nand knew what \"mischief\" she had been in. He knit his brows,\nthen smiled, because it was impossible to help it Rose looked so\nconscience-stricken in spite of her twenty years.\n\n\"How do you find it? Interesting?\"\n\n\"Oh, very! I felt as if I was in another world and forgot all about\nthis.\"\n\n\"Not a very good world, I fancy, if you were afraid or ashamed to be\nfound in it. Where did this come from?\" asked Dr. Alec, surveying\nthe book with great disfavor. Rose told him, and added slowly, \"I\nparticularly wanted to read it, and fancied I might, because you did\nwhen it was so much talked about the winter we were in Rome.\"\n\n\"I did read it to see if it was fit for you.\"\n\n\"And decided that it was not, I suppose, since you never gave it to me!\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Then I won't finish it. But, Uncle, I don't see why I should not,\"\nadded Rose wistfully, for she had reached the heart of the romance and\nfound it wonderfully fascinating.\n\n\"You may not see, but don't you feel why not?\" asked Dr. Alec gravely.\n\nRose leaned her flushed cheek on her hand and thought a minute, then\nlooked up and answered honestly, \"Yes, I do, but can't explain it,\nexcept that I know something must be wrong, because I blushed and\nstarted when you came in.\"\n\n\"Exactly.\" And the doctor gave an emphatic nod, as if the symptoms\npleased him.\n\n\"But I really don't see any harm in the book so far. It is by a famous\nauthor, wonderfully well written, as you know, and the characters so\nlifelike that I feel as if I should really meet them somewhere.\"\n\n\"I hope not!\" ejaculated the doctor, shutting the book quickly, as if to\nkeep the objectionable beings from escaping.\n\nRose laughed, but persisted in her defense, for she did want to finish\nthe absorbing story, yet would not without leave.\n\n\"I have read French novels before, and you gave them to me. Not many, to\nbe sure, but the best, so I think I know what is good and shouldn't like\nthis if it was harmful.\"\n\nHer uncle's answer was to reopen the volume and turn the leaves an\ninstant as if to find a particular place. Then he put it into her hand,\nsaying quietly: \"Read a page or two aloud, translating as you go. You\nused to like that try it again.\"\n\nRose obeyed and went glibly down a page, doing her best to give the\nsense in her purest English. Presently she went more slowly, then\nskipped a sentence here and there, and finally stopped short, looking as\nif she needed a screen again.\n\n\"What's the matter?\" asked her uncle, who had been watching her with a\nserious eye.\n\n\"Some phrases are untranslatable, and it only spoils them to try. They\nare not amiss in French, but sound coarse and bad in our blunt English,\"\nshe said a little pettishly, for she felt annoyed by her failure to\nprove the contested point.\n\n\"Ah, my dear, if the fine phrases won't bear putting into honest\nEnglish, the thoughts they express won't bear putting into your innocent\nmind! That chapter is the key to the whole book, and if you had been led\nup, or rather down, to it artfully and artistically, you might have\nread it to yourself without seeing how bad it is. All the worse for the\nundeniable talent which hides the evil so subtly and makes the danger so\ndelightful.\"\n\nHe paused a moment, then added with an anxious glance at the book, over\nwhich she was still bending, \"Finish it if you choose only remember, my\ngirl, that one may read at forty what is unsafe at twenty, and that we\nnever can be too careful what food we give that precious yet perilous\nthing called imagination.\"\n\nAnd taking his Review, he went away to look over a learned article which\ninterested him much less than the workings of a young mind nearby.\n\nAnother long silence, broken only by an occasional excited bounce from\nJamie when the sociable cuttlefish looked in at the windows or the\nNautilus scuttled a ship or two in its terrific course. A bell rang, and\nthe doctor popped his head out to see if he was wanted. It was only a\nmessage for Aunt Plenty, and he was about to pop in again when his eye\nwas caught by a square parcel on the slab.\n\n\"What's this?\" he asked, taking it up.\n\n\"Rose wants me to leave it at Kitty Van's when I go. I forgot to bring\nher book from Mama, so I shall go and get it as soon as ever I've done\nthis,\" replied Jamie from his nest.\n\nAs the volume in his hands was a corpulent one, and Jamie only a third\nof the way through, Dr. Alec thought Rose's prospect rather doubtful\nand, slipping the parcel into his pocket, he walked away, saying with a\nsatisfied air: \"Virtue doesn't always get rewarded, but it shall be this\ntime if I can do it.\"\n\nMore than half an hour afterward, Rose woke from a little nap and found\nthe various old favorites with which she had tried to solace herself\nreplaced by the simple, wholesome story promised by Aunt Jessie.\n\n\"Good boy! I'll go and thank him,\" she said half aloud, jumping up, wide\nawake and much pleased.\n\nBut she did not go, for just then she spied her uncle standing on the\nrug warming his hands with a generally fresh and breezy look about him\nwhich suggested a recent struggle with the elements.\n\n\"How did this come?\" she asked suspiciously.\n\n\"A man brought it.\"\n\n\"This man? Oh, Uncle! Why did you take so much trouble just to gratify\na wish of mine?\" she cried, taking both the cold hands in hers with a\ntenderly reproachful glance from the storm without to the ruddy face\nabove her.\n\n\"Because, having taken away your French bonbons with the poisonous color\non them, I wanted to get you something better. Here it is, all pure\nsugar, the sort that sweetens the heart as well as the tongue and leaves\nno bad taste behind.\"\n\n\"How good you are to me! I don't deserve it, for I didn't resist\ntemptation, though I tried. Uncle, after I'd put the book away, I\nthought I must just see how it ended, and I'm afraid I should have read\nit all if it had not been gone,\" said Rose, laying her face down on the\nhands she held as humbly as a repentant child.\n\nBut Uncle Alec lifted up the bent head and, looking into the eyes that\nmet his frankly, though either held a tear, he said, with the energy\nthat always made his words remembered: \"My little girl, I would face a\ndozen storms far worse than this to keep your soul as stainless as snow,\nfor it is the small temptations which undermine integrity unless we\nwatch and pray and never think them too trivial to be resisted.\"\n\nSome people would consider Dr. Alec an overcareful man, but Rose felt\nthat he was right, and when she said her prayers that night, added a\nmeek petition to be kept from yielding to three of the small temptations\nwhich beset a rich, pretty, and romantic girl extravagance, coquetry,\nand novel reading.\n\n\n\n\nChapter 12 AT KITTY'S BALL\n\nRose had no new gown to wear on this festive occasion, and gave one\nlittle sigh of regret as she put on the pale blue silk refreshed with\nclouds of gaze de Chamb\u00c3\u00a9ry. But a smile followed, very bright and sweet,\nas she added the clusters of forget-me-not which Charlie had conjured\nup through the agency of an old German florist, for one part of her plan\nhad been carried out, and Prince was invited to be her escort, much\nto his delight, though he wisely made no protestations of any sort and\nshowed his gratitude by being a model gentleman. This pleased Rose, for\nthe late humiliation and a very sincere desire to atone for it gave him\nan air of pensive dignity which was very effective.\n\nAunt Clara could not go, for a certain new cosmetic, privately used to\nimprove the once fine complexion, which had been her pride till late\nhours impaired it, had brought out an unsightly eruption, reducing her\nto the depths of woe and leaving her no solace for her disappointment\nbut the sight of the elegant velvet dress spread forth upon her bed in\nmelancholy state.\n\nSo Aunt Jessie was chaperon, to Rose's great satisfaction, and looked as\n\"pretty as a pink,\" Archie thought, in her matronly pearl-colored gown\nwith a dainty trifle of rich lace on her still abundant hair. He was\nvery proud of his little mama, and as devoted as a lover, \"to keep his\nhand in against Phebe's return,\" she said laughingly when he brought her\na nosegay of blush roses to light up her quiet costume.\n\nA happier mother did not live than Mrs. Jessie as she sat contentedly\nbeside Sister Jane (who graced the frivolous scene in a serious black\ngown with a diadem of purple asters nodding above her severe brow), both\nwatching their boys with the maternal conviction that no other parent\ncould show such remarkable specimens as these. Each had done her best\naccording to her light, and years of faithful care were now beginning to\nbear fruit in the promise of goodly men, so dear to the hearts of true\nmothers.\n\nMrs. Jessie watched her three tall sons with something like wonder,\nfor Archie was a fine fellow, grave and rather stately, but full of the\ncordial courtesy and respect we see so little of nowadays and which is\nthe sure sign of good home training. \"The cadets,\" as Will and Geordie\ncalled themselves, were there as gorgeous as you please, and the agonies\nthey suffered that night with tight boots and stiff collars no pen can\nfitly tell. But only to one another did they confide these sufferings\nand the rare moments of repose when they could stand on one aching foot\nwith heads comfortably sunken inside the excruciating collars, which\nrasped their ears and made the lobes thereof a pleasing scarlet. Brief\nwere these moments, however, and the Spartan boys danced on with smiling\nfaces, undaunted by the hidden anguish which preyed upon them \"fore and\naft,\" as Will expressed it.\n\nMrs. Jane's pair were an odd contrast, and even the stern disciplinarian\nherself could not help smiling as she watched them. Steve was\nsuperb, and might have been married on the spot, so superfine was his\nbroad-cloth, glossy his linen, and perfect the fit of his gloves. While\npride and happiness so fermented in his youthful bosom, there would have\nbeen danger of spontaneous combustion if dancing had not proved a safety\nvalve, for his strong sense of the proprieties would not permit him to\nvent his emotions in any other way.\n\nKitty felt no such restraint, and looked like a blissful little gypsy,\nwith her brunet prettiness set off by a dashing costume of cardinal and\ncream color and every hair on her head curled in a Merry Pecksniffian\ncrop, for youth was her strong point, and she much enjoyed the fact that\nshe had been engaged three times before she was nineteen.\n\nTo see her and Steve spin around the room was a sight to bring a smile\nto the lips of the crustiest bachelor or saddest spinster, for happy\nlovers are always a pleasing spectacle, and two such merry little grigs\nas these are seldom seen.\n\nMac, meantime, with glasses astride his nose, surveyed his brother's\nperformances \"on the light fantastic\" very much as a benevolent\nNewfoundland would the gambols of a toy terrier, receiving with thanks\nthe hasty hints for his guidance which Steve breathed into his ear as\nhe passed and forgetting all about them the next minute. When not thus\nengaged Mac stood about with his thumbs in his vest pockets, regarding\nthe lively crowd like a meditative philosopher of a cheerful aspect,\noften smiling to himself at some whimsical fancy of his own, knitting\nhis brows as some bit of ill-natured gossip met his ear, or staring with\nundisguised admiration as a beautiful face or figure caught his eye.\n\n\"I hope that girl knows what a treasure she has got. But I doubt if she\never fully appreciates it,\" said Mrs. Jane, bringing her spectacles to\nbear upon Kitty as she whisked by, causing quite a gale with her flying\nskirts.\n\n\"I think she will, for Steve has been so well brought up, she cannot but\nsee and feel the worth of what she has never had, and being so young she\nwill profit by it,\" answered Mrs. Jessie softly, thinking of the days\nwhen she and her Jem danced together, just betrothed.\n\n\"I've done my duty by both the boys, and done it thoroughly, or their\nfather would have spoilt them, for he's no more idea of discipline than\na child.\" And Aunt Jane gave her own palm a smart rap with her closed\nfan, emphasizing the word \"thoroughly\" in a most suggestive manner.\n\n\"I've often wished I had your firmness, Jane but after all, I'm not sure\nthat I don't like my own way best, at least with my boys, for plenty of\nlove, and plenty of patience, seem to have succeeded pretty well.\"\nAnd Aunt Jessie lifted the nosegay from her lap, feeling as if that\nunfailing love and patience were already blooming into her life as\nbeautifully as the sweet-breathed roses given by her boy refreshed and\nbrightened these long hours of patient waiting in a corner.\n\n\"I don't deny that you've done well, Jessie, but you've been let alone\nand had no one to hold your hand or interfere. If my Mac had gone to sea\nas your Jem did, I never should have been as severe as I am. Men are so\nperverse and shortsighted, they don't trouble about the future as long\nas things are quiet and comfortable in the present,\" continued Mrs.\nJane, quite forgetting that the shortsighted partner of the firm,\nphysically speaking at least, was herself.\n\n\"Ah, yes! We mothers love to foresee and foretell our children's lives\neven before they are born, and are very apt to be disappointed if they\ndo not turn out as we planned. I know I am yet I really have no cause to\ncomplain and am learning to see that all we can do is to give the dear\nboys good principles and the best training we may, then leave them\nto finish what we have begun.\" And Mrs. Jessie's eye wandered away to\nArchie, dancing with Rose, quite unconscious what a pretty little castle\nin the air tumbled down when he fell in love with Phebe.\n\n\"Right, quite right on that point we agree exactly. I have spared\nnothing to give my boys good principles and good habits, and I am\nwilling to trust them anywhere. Nine times did I whip my Steve to cure\nhim of fibbing, and over and over again did Mac go without his dinner\nrather than wash his hands. But I whipped and starved them both into\nobedience, and now I have my reward,\" concluded the \"stern parent\" with\na proud wave of the fan, which looked very like a ferule, being as big,\nhard, and uncompromising as such an article could be.\n\nMrs. Jessie gave a mild murmur of assent, but could not help thinking,\nwith a smile, that in spite of their early tribulations the sins for\nwhich the boys suffered had gotten a little mixed in their result, for\nfibbing Steve was now the tidy one, and careless Mac the truth teller.\nBut such small contradictions will happen in the best-regulated\nfamilies, and all perplexed parents can do is to keep up a steadfast\npreaching and practicing in the hope that it will bear fruit sometime,\nfor according to an old proverb, Children pick up words as pigeons\npease, To utter them again as God shall please.\n\n\"I hope they won't dance the child to death among them, for each one\nseems bound to have his turn, even your sober Mac,\" said Mrs. Jessie a\nfew minutes later as she saw Archie hand Rose over to his cousin, who\ncarried her off with an air of triumph from several other claimants.\n\n\"She's very good to him, and her influence is excellent, for he is of an\nage now when a young woman's opinion has more weight than an old one's.\nThough he is always good to his mother, and I feel as if I should take\ngreat comfort in him. He's one of the sort who will not marry till late,\nif ever, being fond of books and a quiet life,\" responded Mrs. Jane,\nremembering how often her son had expressed his belief that philosophers\nshould not marry and brought up Plato as an example of the serene\nwisdom to be attained only by a single man while her husband sided with\nSocrates, for whom he felt a profound sympathy, though he didn't dare to\nown it.\n\n\"Well, I don't know about that. Since my Archie surprised me by losing\nhis heart as he did, I'm prepared for anything, and advise you to do\nlikewise. I really shouldn't wonder if Mac did something remarkable in\nthat line, though he shows no sign of it yet, I confess,\" answered Mrs.\nJessie, laughing.\n\n\"It won't be in that direction, you may be sure, for her fate is sealed.\nDear me, how sad it is to see a superior girl like that about to throw\nherself away on a handsome scapegrace. I won't mention names, but you\nunderstand me.\" And Mrs. Jane shook her head, as if she could mention\nthe name of one superior girl who had thrown herself away and now saw\nthe folly of it.\n\n\"I'm very anxious, of course, and so is Alec, but it may be the saving\nof one party and the happiness of the other, for some women love to give\nmore than they receive,\" said Mrs. Jessie, privately wondering, for\nthe thousandth time, why brother Mac ever married the learned Miss\nHumphries.\n\n\"You'll see that it won't prosper, and I shall always maintain that a\nwife cannot entirely undo a mother's work. Rose will have her hands\nfull if she tries to set all Clara's mistakes right,\" answered Aunt Jane\ngrimly, then began to fan violently as their hostess approached to have\na dish of chat about \"our dear young people.\"\n\nRose was in a merry mood that night, and found Mac quite ready for fun,\nwhich was fortunate, since her first remark set them off on a droll\nsubject.\n\n\"Oh, Mac! Annabel has just confided to me that she is engaged to Fun\nSee! Think of her going to housekeeping in Canton someday and having to\norder rats, puppies, and bird's-nest soup for dinner,\" whispered Rose,\ntoo much amused to keep the news to herself.\n\n\"By Confucius! Isn't that a sweet prospect?\" And Mac burst out laughing,\nto the great surprise of his neighbors, who wondered what there was\namusing about the Chinese sage. \"It is rather alarming, though, to have\nthese infants going on at this rate. Seems to be catching, a new sort of\nscarlet fever, to judge by Annabel's cheeks and Kitty's gown,\" he added,\nregarding the aforesaid ladies with eyes still twinkling with merriment.\n\n\"Don't be ungallant, but go and do likewise, for it is all the fashion.\nI heard Mrs. Van tell old Mrs. Joy that it was going to be a marrying\nyear, so you'll be sure to catch it,\" answered Rose, reefing her skirts,\nfor, with all his training, Mac still found it difficult to keep his\nlong legs out of the man-traps.\n\n\"It doesn't look like a painful disease, but I must be careful, for\nI've no time to be ill now. What are the symptoms?\" asked Mac, trying\nto combine business with pleasure and improve his mind while doing his\nduty.\n\n\"If you ever come back I'll tell you,\" laughed Rose as he danced away\ninto the wrong corner, bumped smartly against another gentleman, and\nreturned as soberly as if that was the proper figure.\n\n\"Well, tell me 'how not to do it,'\" he said, subsiding for a moment's\ntalk when Rose had floated to and fro in her turn.\n\n\"Oh! You see some young girl who strikes you as particularly charming\nwhether she really is or not doesn't matter a bit and you begin to\nthink about her a great deal, to want to see her, and to get generally\nsentimental and absurd,\" began Rose, finding it difficult to give a\ndiagnosis of the most mysterious disease under the sun.\n\n\"Don't think it sounds enticing. Can't I find an antidote somewhere, for\nif it is in the air this year I'm sure to get it, and it may be fatal,\"\nsaid Mac, who felt pretty lively and liked to make Rose merry, for he\nsuspected that she had a little trouble from a hint Dr. Alec had given\nhim.\n\n\"I hope you will catch it, because you'll be so funny.\"\n\n\"Will you take care of me as you did before, or have you got your hands\nfull?\"\n\n\"I'll help, but really with Archie and Steve and Charlie, I shall have\nenough to do. You'd better take it lightly the first time, and so won't\nneed much care.\"\n\n\"Very well, how shall I begin? Enlighten my ignorance and start me\nright, I beg.\"\n\n\"Go about and see people, make yourself agreeable, and not sit in\ncorners observing other people as if they were puppets dancing for your\namusement. I heard Mrs. Van once say that propinquity works wonders, and\nshe ought to know, having married off two daughters, and just engaged a\nthird to 'a most charming young man.'?\n\n\"Good lack! The cure sounds worse than the disease. Propinquity, hey?\nWhy, I may be in danger this identical moment and can't flee for my\nlife,\" said Mac, gently catching her round the waist for a general\nwaltz.\n\n\"Don't be alarmed, but mind your steps, for Charlie is looking at us,\nand I want you to do your best. That's perfect take me quite round, for\nI love to waltz and seldom get a good turn except with you boys,\" said\nRose, smiling up at him approvingly as his strong arm guided her among\nthe revolving couples and his feet kept time without a fault.\n\n\"This certainly is a great improvement on the chair business, to which\nI have devoted myself with such energy that I've broken the backs of two\npartners and dislocated the arm of the old rocker. I took an occasional\nturn with that heavy party, thinking it good practice in case I ever\nhappen to dance with stout ladies.\" And Mac nodded toward Annabel,\npounding gaily with Mr. Tokio, whose yellow countenance beamed as his\nbeady eyes rested on his plump fianc\u00c3\u00a9e.\n\nPausing in the midst of her merriment at the image of Mac and the old\nrocking chair, Rose said reprovingly, \"Though a heathen Chinee, Fun puts\nyou to shame, for he did not ask foolish questions but went a-wooing\nlike a sensible little man, and I've no doubt Annabel will be very\nhappy.\"\n\n\"Choose me a suitable divinity and I will try to adore. Can I do more\nthan that to retrieve my character?\" answered Mac, safely landing his\npartner and plying the fan according to instructions.\n\n\"How would Emma do?\" inquired Rose, whose sense of the ludicrous was\nstrong and who could not resist the temptation of horrifying Mac by the\nsuggestion.\n\n\"Never! It sets my teeth on edge to look at her tonight. I suppose that\ndress is 'a sweet thing just out,' but upon my word she reminds me of\nnothing but a Harlequin ice,\" and Mac turned his back on her with a\nshudder, for he was sensitive to discords of all kinds.\n\n\"She certainly does, and that mixture of chocolate, pea green, and pink\nis simply detestable, though many people would consider it decidedly\n'chic,' to use her favorite word. I suppose you will dress your wife\nlike a Spartan matron of the time of Lycurgus,\" added Rose, much tickled\nby his new conceit.\n\n\"I'll wait till I get her before I decide. But one thing I'm sure of she\nshall not dress like a Greek dancer of the time of Pericles,\" answered\nMac, regarding with great disfavor a young lady who, having a statuesque\nfigure, affected drapery of the scanty and clinging description.\n\n\"Then it is of no use to suggest that classic creature, so as you reject\nmy first attempts, I won't go on but look about me quietly, and you had\nbetter do the same. Seriously, Mac, more gaiety and less study would do\nyou good, for you will grow old before your time if you shut yourself up\nand pore over books so much.\"\n\n\"I don't believe there is a younger or a jollier-feeling fellow in the\nroom than I am, though I may not conduct myself like a dancing dervish.\nBut I own you may be right about the books, for there are many sorts of\nintemperance, and a library is as irresistible to me as a barroom to a\ntoper. I shall have to sign a pledge and cork up the only bottle that\ntempts me my ink-stand.\"\n\n\"I'll tell you how to make it easier to abstain. Stop studying and write\na novel into which you can put all your wise things, and so clear your\nbrains for a new start by and by. Do I should so like to read it,\" cried\nRose, delighted with the project, for she was sure Mac could do anything\nhe liked in that line.\n\n\"First live, then write. How can I go to romancing till I know what\nromance means?\" he asked soberly, feeling that so far he had had very\nlittle in his life.\n\n\"Then you must find out, and nothing will help you more than to love\nsomeone very much. Do as I've advised and be a modern Diogenes going\nabout with spectacles instead of a lantern in search, not of an honest\nman, but a perfect woman. I do hope you will be successful.\" And Rose\nmade her curtsey as the dance ended.\n\n\"I don't expect perfection, but I should like one as good as they ever\nmake them nowadays. If you are looking for the honest man, I wish you\nsuccess in return,\" said Mac, relinquishing her fan with a glance of\nsuch sympathetic significance that a quick flush of feeling rose to the\ngirl's face as she answered very low, \"If honesty was all I wanted, I\ncertainly have found it in you.\"\n\nThen she went away with Charlie, who was waiting for his turn, and Mac\nroamed about, wondering if anywhere in all that crowd his future wife\nwas hidden, saying to himself, as he glanced from face to face, quite\nunresponsive to the various allurements displayed,\n\n    \"What care I how fair she be,\n    If she be not fair for me?\"\n\nJust before supper several young ladies met in the dressing room to\nrepair damages and, being friends, they fell into discourse as they\nsmoothed their locks and had their tattered furbelows sewed or pinned up\nby the neat-handed Phillis-in-waiting.\n\nWhen each had asked the other, \"How do I look tonight, dear?\" and been\nanswered with reciprocal enthusiasm, \"Perfectly lovely, darling!\" Kitty\nsaid to Rose, who was helping her to restore order out of the chaos to\nwhich much exercise had reduced her curls: \"By the way, young Randal is\ndying to be presented to you. May I after supper?\"\n\n\"No, thank you,\" answered Rose very decidedly.\n\n\"Well, I'm sure I don't see why not,\" began Kitty, looking displeased\nbut not surprised.\n\n\"I think you do, else why didn't you present him when he asked? You\nseldom stop to think of etiquette why did you now?\"\n\n\"I didn't like to do it till I had you are so particular I thought you'd\nsay 'no,' but I couldn't tell him so,\" stammered Kitty, feeling that she\nhad better have settled the matter herself, for Rose was very particular\nand had especial reason to dislike this person because he was not only a\ndissipated young reprobate himself but seemed possessed of Satan to lead\nothers astray likewise.\n\n\"I don't wish to be rude, dear, but I really must decline, for I cannot\nknow such people, even though I meet them here,\" said Rose, remembering\nCharlie's revelations on New Year's night and hardening her heart\nagainst the man who had been his undoing on that as well as on other\noccasions, she had reason to believe.\n\n\"I couldn't help it! Old Mr. Randal and Papa are friends, and though I\nspoke of it, brother Alf wouldn't hear of passing that bad boy over,\"\nexplained Kitty eagerly.\n\n\"Yet Alf forbade you driving or skating with him, for he knows better\nthan we how unfit he is to come among us.\"\n\n\"I'd drop him tomorrow if I could, but I must be civil in my own house.\nHis mother brought him, and he won't dare to behave here as he does at\ntheir bachelor parties.\"\n\n\"She ought not to have brought him till he had shown some desire to\nmend his ways. It is none of my business, I know, but I do wish people\nwouldn't be so inconsistent, letting boys go to destruction and then\nexpecting us girls to receive them like decent people.\" Rose spoke in\nan energetic whisper, but Annabel heard her and exclaimed, as she turned\nround with a powder puff in her hand: \"My goodness, Rose! What is all\nthat about going to destruction?\"\n\n\"She is being strong-minded, and I don't very much blame her in this\ncase. But it leaves me in a dreadful scrape,\" said Kitty, supporting her\nspirits with a sniff of aromatic vinegar.\n\n\"I appeal to you, since you heard me, and there's no one here but\nourselves do you consider young Randal a nice person to know?\" And Rose\nturned to Annabel and Emma with an anxious eye, for she did not find it\neasy to abide by her principles when so doing annoyed friends.\n\n\"No, indeed, he's perfectly horrid! Papa says he and Gorham are the\nwildest young men he knows, and enough to spoil the whole set. I'm so\nglad I've got no brothers,\" responded Annabel, placidly powdering her\npink arms, quite undeterred by the memory of sundry white streaks left\non sundry coat sleeves.\n\n\"I think that sort of scrupulousness is very ill-bred, if you'll excuse\nmy saying so, Rose. We are not supposed to know anything about fastness,\nand wildness, and so on, but to treat every man alike and not be fussy\nand prudish,\" said Emma, settling her many-colored streamers with the\nsuperior air of a woman of the world, aged twenty.\n\n\"Ah! But we do know, and if our silence and civility have no effect, we\nought to try something else and not encourage wickedness of any kind. We\nneedn't scold and preach, but we can refuse to know such people and that\nwill do some good, for they don't like to be shunned and shut out from\nrespectable society. Uncle Alec told me not to know that man, and I\nwon't.\" Rose spoke with unusual warmth, forgetting that she could not\ntell the real reason for her strong prejudice against \"that man.\"\n\n\"Well, I know him. I think him very jolly, and I'm engaged to dance\nthe German with him after supper. He leads quite as well as your cousin\nCharlie and is quite as fascinating, some people think,\" returned Emma,\ntossing her head disdainfully, for Prince Charming did not worship at\nher shrine and it piqued her vanity.\n\nIn spite of her quandary, Rose could not help smiling as she recalled\nMac's comparison, for Emma turned so red with spiteful chagrin, she\nseemed to have added strawberry ice to the other varieties composing the\nHarlequin.\n\n\"Each must judge for herself. I shall follow Aunt Jessie's advice and\ntry to keep my atmosphere as pure as I can, for she says every woman has\nher own little circle and in it can use her influence for good, if she\nwill. I do will heartily, and I'll prove that I'm neither proud nor\nfussy by receiving, here or at home, any respectable man you like to\npresent to me, no matter how poor or plain or insignificant he may be.\"\n\nWith which declaration Rose ended her protest, and the four damsels\nstreamed downstairs together like a wandering rainbow. But Kitty laid\nto heart what she had said; Annabel took credit herself for siding with\nher; and Emma owned that she was not trying to keep her atmosphere pure\nwhen she came to dance with the objectionable Randal. So Rose's \"little\ncircle\" was the better for the influence she tried to exert, although\nshe never knew it.\n\nAt suppertime Charlie kept near her, and she was quite content with him,\nfor he drank only coffee, and she saw him shake his head with a frown\nwhen young Van beckoned him toward an anteroom, from whence the sound of\npopping corks had issued with increasing frequency as the evening wore\non.\n\n\"Dear fellow, he does try,\" thought Rose, longing to show how she\nadmired his self-denial, but she could only say, as they left the supper\nroom with the aunts, who were going early: \"If I had not promised Uncle\nto get home as soon after midnight as possible, I'd stay and dance the\nGerman with you, for you deserve a reward tonight.\"\n\n\"A thousand thanks, but I am going when you do,\" answered Charlie,\nunderstanding both her look and words and very grateful for them.\n\n\"Really?\" cried Rose, delighted.\n\n\"Really. I'll be in the hall when you come down.\" And Charlie thought\nthe Fra Angelico angel was not half so bright and beautiful as the one\nwho looked back at him out of a pale blue cloud as Rose went upstairs as\nif on wings.\n\nWhen she came down again Charlie was not in the hall, however, and,\nafter waiting a few minutes, Mac offered to go and find him, for Aunt\nJane was still hunting a lost rubber above.\n\n\"Please say I'm ready, but he needn't come if he doesn't want to,\" said\nRose, not wishing to demand too much of her promising penitent.\n\n\"If he has gone into that barroom, I'll have him out, no matter who is\nthere!\" growled Mac to himself as he made his way to the small apartment\nwhither the gentlemen retired for a little private refreshment when the\nspirit moved, as it often did.\n\nThe door was ajar, and Charlie seemed to have just entered, for Mac\nheard a familiar voice call out in a jovial tone: \"Come, Prince! You're\njust in time to help us drink Steve's health with all the honors.\"\n\n\"Can't stop, only ran in to say good night, Van. Had a capital time, but\nI'm on duty and must go.\"\n\n\"That's a new dodge. Take a stirrup cup anyway, and come back in time\nfor a merry-go-rounder when you've disposed of the ladies,\" answered the\nyoung host, diving into the wine cooler for another bottle.\n\n\"Charlie's going in for sanctity, and it doesn't seem to agree with\nhim,\" laughed one of the two other young men who occupied several chairs\napiece, resting their soles in every sense of the word.\n\n\"Apron strings are coming into fashion the bluer the better hey,\nPrince?\" added the other, trying to be witty, with the usual success.\n\n\"You'd better go home early yourself, Barrow, or that tongue of yours\nwill get you into trouble,\" retorted Charlie, conscious that he ought\nto take his own advice, yet lingering, nervously putting on his gloves\nwhile the glasses were being filled.\n\n\"Now, brother-in-law, fire away! Here you are, Prince.\" And Steve handed\na glass across the table to his cousin, feeling too much elated with\nvarious pleasurable emotions to think what he was doing, for the boys\nall knew Charlie's weakness and usually tried to defend him from it.\n\nBefore the glass could be taken, however, Mac entered in a great hurry,\ndelivering his message in an abbreviated and rather peremptory form:\n\"Rose is waiting for you. Hurry up!\"\n\n\"All right. Good night, old fellows!\" And Charlie was off, as if the\nname had power to stop him in the very act of breaking the promise made\nto himself.\n\n\"Come, Solon, take a social drop, and give us an epithalamium in your\nbest Greek. Here's to you!\" And Steve was lifting the wine to his own\nlips when Mac knocked the glass out of his hand with a flash of the\neye that caused his brother to stare at him with his mouth open in\nan imbecile sort of way, which seemed to excite Mac still more, for,\nturning to his young host, he said, in a low voice, and with a look that\nmade the gentlemen on the chairs sit up suddenly: \"I beg pardon, Van,\nfor making a mess, but I can't stand by and see my own brother tempt\nanother man beyond his strength or make a brute of himself. That's plain\nEnglish, but I can't help speaking out, for I know not one of you would\nwillingly hurt Charlie, and you will if you don't let him alone.\"\n\n\"What do you pitch into me for? I've done nothing. A fellow must be\ncivil in his own house, mustn't he?\" asked Van good-humoredly as he\nfaced about, corkscrew in hand.\n\n\"Yes, but it is not civil to urge or joke a guest into doing what you\nknow and he knows is bad for him. That's only a glass of wine to you,\nbut it is perdition to Charlie, and if Steve knew what he was about,\nhe'd cut his right hand off before he'd offer it.\"\n\n\"Do you mean to say I'm tipsy?\" demanded Steve, ruffling up like a\nlittle gamecock, for though he saw now what he had done and was ashamed\nof it, he hated to have Mac air his peculiar notions before other\npeople.\n\n\"With excitement, not champagne, I hope, for I wouldn't own you if you\nwere,\" answered Mac, in whom indignation was effervescing like the wine\nin the forgotten bottle, for the men were all young, friends of Steve's\nand admirers of Charlie's. \"Look here, boys,\" he went on more quietly,\n\"I know I ought not to explode in this violent sort of way, but upon my\nlife I couldn't help it when I heard what you were saying and saw what\nSteve was doing. Since I have begun, I may as well finish and tell you\nstraight out that Prince can't stand this sort of thing. He is trying\nto flee temptation, and whoever leads him into it does a cowardly\nand sinful act, for the loss of one's own self-respect is bad enough,\nwithout losing the more precious things that make life worth having.\nDon't tell him I've said this, but lend a hand if you can, and never\nhave to reproach yourselves with the knowledge that you helped to ruin a\nfellow creature, soul and body.\"\n\nIt was well for the success of Mac's first crusade that his hearers\nwere gentlemen and sober, so his outburst was not received with jeers or\nlaughter but listened to in silence, while the expression of the faces\nchanged from one of surprise to regret and respect, for earnestness is\nalways effective and championship of this sort seldom fails to touch\nhearts as yet unspoiled. As he paused with an eloquent little quiver\nin his eager voice, Van corked the bottle at a blow, threw down the\ncorkscrew, and offered Mac his hand, saying heartily, in spite of his\nslang: \"You are a first-class old brick! I'll lend a hand for one, and\ndo my best to back up Charlie, for he's the finest fellow I know, and\nshan't go to the devil like poor Randal if I can help it.\"\n\nMurmurs of applause from the others seemed to express a general assent\nto this vigorous statement, and, giving the hand a grateful shake, Mac\nretreated to the door, anxious to be off now that he had freed his mind\nwith such unusual impetuosity.\n\n\"Count on me for anything I can do in return for this, Van. I'm sorry\nto be such a marplot, but you can take it out in quizzing me after I'm\ngone. I'm fair game, and Steve can set you going.\"\n\nWith that, Mac departed as abruptly as he had come, feeling that he\nhad \"made a mess\" of it, but comforting himself with the thought that\nperhaps he had secured help for Charlie at his own expense and thinking\nwith a droll smile as he went back to his mother: \"My romance begins by\nlooking after other girls' lovers instead of finding a sweetheart for\nmyself, but I can't tell Rose, so she won't laugh at me.\"\n\n\n\n\nChapter 13 BOTH SIDES\n\nSteve's engagement made a great stir in the family a pleasant one this\ntime, for nobody objected, everything seemed felicitous, and the course\nof true love ran very smoothly for the young couple, who promised to\nremove the only obstacle to their union by growing old and wise as soon\nas possible. If he had not been so genuinely happy, the little lover's\nairs would have been unbearable, for he patronized all mankind in\ngeneral, his brother and elder cousins in particular.\n\n\"Now, that is the way to manage matters,\" he declared, standing before\nthe fire in Aunt Clara's billiard room a day or two after the ball, with\nhis hands behind his back. \"No nonsense, no delay, no domestic rows or\ntragic separations. Just choose with taste and judgment, make yourself\nagreeable through thick and thin, and when it is perfectly evident that\nthe dear creature adores the ground you walk on, say the word like a\nman, and there you are.\"\n\n\"All very easy to do that with a girl like Kitty, who has no confounded\nnotions to spoil her and trip you up every time you don't exactly toe\nthe mark,\" muttered Charlie, knocking the balls about as if it were\na relief to hit something, for he was in a gloriously bad humor that\nevening, because time hung heavy on his hands since he had forsworn the\ncompany he could not keep without danger to himself.\n\n\"You should humor those little notions, for all women have them, and it\nneeds tact to steer clear of them. Kitty's got dozens, but I treat them\nwith respect, have my own way when I can, give in without growling when\nI can't, and we get on like a couple of--\"\n\n\"Spoons,\" put in Charlie, who felt that he had not steered clear and so\nsuffered shipwreck in sight of land.\n\nSteve meant to have said \"doves,\" but his cousin's levity caused him to\nadd with calm dignity, \"reasonable beings,\" and then revenged himself by\nmaking a good shot which won him the game.\n\n\"You always were a lucky little dog, Steve. I don't begrudge you a\nparticle of your happiness, but it does seem as if things weren't quite\nfair sometimes,\" said Archie, suppressing an envious sigh, for, though\nhe seldom complained, it was impossible to contrast his own and his\ncousin's prospects with perfect equanimity.\n\n    \"His worth shines forth the brightest who in hope\n     Always confides: the Abject soul despairs,\"\n\nobserved Mac, quoting Euripides in a conversational tone as he lay upon\na divan reposing after a hard day's work.\n\n\"Thank you,\" said Archie, brightening a little, for a hopeful word from\nany source was very comfortable.\n\n\"That's your favorite Rip, isn't it? He was a wise old boy, but you\ncould find advice as good as that nearer home,\" put in Steve, who just\nthen felt equal to slapping Plato on the shoulder, so elated was he at\nbeing engaged \"first of all the lot,\" as he gracefully expressed it.\n\n\"Don't halloo till you are out of the wood, Dandy Mrs. Kit has jilted\ntwo men, and may a third, so you'd better not brag of your wisdom too\nsoon, for she may make a fool of you yet,\" said Charlie, cynically, his\nviews of life being very gloomy about this time.\n\n\"No, she won't, Steve, if you do your part honestly. There's the making\nof a good little woman in Kitty, and she has proved it by taking you\ninstead of those other fellows. You are not a Solomon, but you're not\nspoilt yet, and she had the sense to see it,\" said Mac encouragingly\nfrom his corner, for he and his brother were better friends than even\nsince the little scene at the Van Tassels'.\n\n\"Hear! Hear!\" cried Steve, looking more than ever like a cheerful young\ncockerel trying to crow as he stood upon the hearth rug with his hands\nunder his coat tails, rising and falling alternately upon the toes and\nheels of his neat little boots.\n\n\"Come, you've given them each a pat on the head haven't you got one for\nme? I need it enough, for if ever there was a poor devil born under an\nevil star, it is C. C. Campbell,\" exclaimed Charlie, leaning his chin on\nhis cue with a discontented expression of countenance, for trying to be\ngood is often very hard work till one gets used to it.\n\n\"Oh, yes! I can accommodate you.\" And, as if his words suggested the\nselection, Mac, still lying flat upon his back, repeated one of his\nfavorite bits from Beaumont and Fletcher, for he had a wonderful memory\nand could reel off poetry by the hour together.\n\n    \"Man is his own star; and the soul that can\n    Render an honest and a perfect man\n    Commands all light, all influence, all fate.\n    Nothing to him falls early or too late.\n\n    Our acts our angels are; or good or ill,\n    Our fatal shadows that walk by us still.\"\n\n\"Confoundedly bad angels they are too,\" muttered Charlie ruefully,\nremembering the one that undid him.\n\nHis cousins never knew exactly what occurred on New Year's night, but\nsuspected that something was amiss, for Charlie had the blues, and Rose,\nthough as kind as ever, expressed no surprise at his long absences. They\nhad all observed and wondered at this state of things, yet discreetly\nmade no remark till Steve, who was as inquisitive as a magpie, seized\nthis opportunity to say in a friendly tone, which showed that he bore no\nmalice for the dark prophecy regarding his Kitty's faithfulness: \"What's\nthe trouble, Prince? You are so seldom in a bad humor that we don't know\nwhat to make of it and all feel out of spirits when you have the blues.\nHad a tiff with Rose?\"\n\n\"Never you mind, little boy, but this I will say the better women are,\nthe more unreasonable they are. They don't require us to be saints like\nthemselves, which is lucky, but they do expect us to render an 'honest\nand a perfect man' sometimes, and that is asking rather too much in a\nfallen world like this,\" said Charlie, glad to get a little sympathy,\nthough he had no intention of confessing his transgressions.\n\n\"No, it isn't,\" said Mac, decidedly.\n\n\"Much you know about it,\" began Charlie, ill pleased to be so flatly\ncontradicted.\n\n\"Well, I know this much,\" added Mac, suddenly sitting up with his hair\nin a highly disheveled condition. \"It is very unreasonable in us to ask\nwomen to be saints and then expect them to feel honored when we offer\nthem our damaged hearts or, at best, one not half as good as theirs. If\nthey weren't blinded by love, they'd see what a mean advantage we take\nof them and not make such bad bargains.\"\n\n\"Upon my word, the philosopher is coming out strong upon the subject!\nWe shall have him preaching 'Women's Rights' directly,\" said Steve, much\namazed at this outburst.\n\n\"I've begun, you see, and much good may it do you,\" answered Mac, laying\nhimself placidly down again.\n\n\"Well, but look here, man you are arguing on the wrong side,\" put in\nArchie, quite agreeing with him, but feeling that he must stand by his\norder at all costs.\n\n\"Never mind sides, uphold the right wherever you find it. You needn't\nstare, Steve I told you I was going to look into this matter, and I am.\nYou think I'm wrapped up in books, but I see a great deal more of what\nis going on around me than you imagine, and I'm getting on in this new\nbranch, let me tell you, quite as fast as is good for me, I daresay.\"\n\n\"Going in for perfection, are you?\" asked Charlie, both amused and\ninterested, for he respected Mac more than he owned even to himself, and\nthough he had never alluded to the timely warning, neither forgot.\n\n\"Yes, I think of it.\"\n\n\"How will you begin?\"\n\n\"Do my best all-round keep good company, read good books, love good\nthings, and cultivate soul and body as faithfully and wisely as I can.\"\n\n\"And you expect to succeed, do you?\"\n\n\"Please God, I will.\"\n\nThe quiet energy of Mac's last words produced a momentary silence.\nCharlie thoughtfully studied the carpet; Archie, who had been absently\npoking the fire, looked over at Mac as if he thanked him again, and\nSteve, forgetting his self-conceit, began to wonder if it was not\npossible to improve himself a little for Kitty's sake. Only a minute,\nfor young men do not give much time to thoughts of this kind, even when\nlove stirs up the noblest impulses within them. To act rather than to\ntalk is more natural to most of them, as Charlie's next question showed,\nfor, having the matter much at heart, he ventured to ask in an offhand\nway as he laughed and twirled his cue: \"Do you intend to reach the\nhighest point of perfection before you address one of the fair saints,\nor shall you ask her to lend a hand somewhere short of that?\"\n\n\"As it takes a long lifetime to do what I plan, I think I shall ask some\ngood woman 'to lend a hand' when I've got anything worth offering her.\nNot a saint, for I never shall be one myself, but a gentle creature who\nwill help me, as I shall try to help her, so that we can go on together\nand finish our work hereafter, if we haven't time to do it here.\"\n\nIf Mac had been a lover, he would not have discussed the subject in\nthis simple and sincere fashion, though he might have felt it far more\ndeeply, but being quite heart-free, he frankly showed his interest and,\ncuriously enough, out of his wise young head unconsciously gave the\nthree lovers before him counsel which they valued, because he practiced\nwhat he preached.\n\n\"Well, I hope you'll find her!\" said Charlie heartily as he went back to\nhis game.\n\n\"I think I shall.\" And while the others played, Mac lay staring at the\nwindow curtain as contentedly as if, through it, he beheld \"a dream of\nfair women\" from which to choose his future mate.\n\nA few days after this talk in the billiard room, Kitty went to call upon\nRose, for as she was about to enter the family she felt it her duty\nto become acquainted with all its branches. This branch, however, she\ncultivated more assiduously than any other and was continually running\nin to confer with \"Cousin Rose,\" whom she considered the wisest,\ndearest, kindest girl ever created. And Rose, finding that, in spite\nof her flighty head, Kitty had a good heart of her own, did her best to\nencourage all the new hopes and aspirations springing up in it under the\nwarmth of the first genuine affection she had ever known.\n\n\"My dear, I want to have some serious conversation with you upon a\nsubject in which I take an interest for the first time in my life,\"\nbegan Miss Kitty, seating herself and pulling off her gloves as if the\nsubject was one which needed a firm grasp.\n\n\"Tell away, and don't mind if I go on working, as I want to finish this\njob today,\" answered Rose, with a long-handled paintbrush in her hand\nand a great pair of shears at her side.\n\n\"You are always so busy! What is it now? Let me help I can talk faster\nwhen I'm doing something,\" which seemed hardly possible, for Kitty's\ntongue went like a mill clapper at all hours.\n\n\"Making picture books for my sick babies at the hospital. Pretty work,\nisn't it? You cut out, and I'll paste them on these squares of gay\ncambric then we just tie up a few pages with a ribbon and there is a\nnice, light, durable book for the poor dears to look at as they lie in\ntheir little beds.\"\n\n\"A capital idea. Do you go there often? How ever do you find the time\nfor such things?\" asked Kitty, busily cutting from a big sheet the\ntouching picture of a parent bird with a red head and a blue tail\noffering what looked like a small boa constrictor to one of its\nnestlings, a fat young squab with a green head, yellow body, and no tail\nat all.\n\n\"I have plenty of time now I don't go out so much, for a party uses up\ntwo days generally one to prepare for it and one to get over it, you\nknow.\"\n\n\"People think it is so odd of you to give up society all of a sudden.\nThey say you have 'turned pious' and it is owing to your peculiar\nbringing-up. I always take your part and say it is a pity other girls\nhaven't as sensible an education, for I don't know one who is as\nsatisfactory on the whole as you are.\"\n\n\"Much obliged. You may also tell people I gave up gaiety because I value\nhealth more. But I haven't forsworn everything of the kind, Kit. I go\nto concerts and lectures, and all sorts of early things, and have nice\ntimes at home, as you know. I like fun as well as ever, but I'm getting\non, you see, and must be preparing a little for the serious part of\nlife. One never knows when it may come,\" said Rose, thoughtfully as she\npasted a squirrel upside down on the pink cotton page before her.\n\n\"That reminds me of what I wanted to say. If you'll believe me, my\ndear, Steve has got that very idea into his head! Did you or Mac put it\nthere?\" asked Kitty, industriously clashing her shears.\n\n\"No, I've given up lecturing the boys lately they are so big now they\ndon't like it, and I fancy I'd got into a way that was rather tiresome.\"\n\n\"Well, then, he is 'turning pious' too. And what is very singular, I\nlike it. Now don't smile I really do and I want to be getting ready\nfor the 'serious part of life,' as you call it. That is, I want to grow\nbetter as fast as I can, for Steve says he isn't half good enough for\nme. Just think of that!\"\n\nKitty looked so surprised and pleased and proud that Rose felt no\ndesire to laugh at her sudden fancy for sobriety but said in her most\nsympathetic tone: \"I'm very glad to hear it, for it shows that he loves\nyou in the right way.\"\n\n\"Is there more than one way?\"\n\n\"Yes, I fancy so, because some people improve so much after they fall in\nlove, and others do not at all. Have you never observed that?\"\n\n\"I never learned how to observe. Of course I know that some matches turn\nout well and some don't, but I never thought much about it.\"\n\n\"Well, I have, for I was rather interested in the subject lately and had\na talk with Aunt Jessie and Uncle about it.\"\n\n\"Gracious! You don't talk to them about such things, do you?\"\n\n\"Yes, indeed. I ask any questions I like, and always get a good answer.\nIt is such a nice way to learn, Kitty, for you don't have to pore over\nbooks, but as things come along you talk about them and remember, and\nwhen they are spoken of afterward you understand and are interested,\nthough you don't say a word,\" explained Rose.\n\n\"It must be nice, but I haven't anyone to do so for me. Papa is too\nbusy, and Mama always says when I ask question, 'Don't trouble your head\nwith such things, child,' so I don't. What did you learn about matches\nturning out well? I'm interested in that, because I want mine to be\nquite perfect in all respects.\"\n\n\"After thinking it over, I came to the conclusion that Uncle was right,\nand it is not always safe to marry a person just because you love him,\"\nbegan Rose, trying to enlighten Kitty without betraying herself.\n\n\"Of course not if they haven't money or are bad. But otherwise I don't\nsee what more is needed,\" said Kitty wonderingly.\n\n\"One should stop and see if it is a wise love, likely to help both\nparties and wear well, for you know it ought to last all one's lifetime,\nand it is very sad if it doesn't.\"\n\n\"I declare it quite scares me to think of it, for I don't usually go\nbeyond my wedding day in making plans. I remember, though, that when I\nwas engaged the first time you don't know the man; it was just after\nyou went away, and I was only sixteen someone very ill-naturedly said I\nshould 'marry in haste and repent at leisure,' and that made me try to\nimagine how it would seem to go on year after year with Gustavus who had\na dreadful temper, by the way and it worried me so to think of it that I\nbroke the engagement, and was so glad ever afterward.\"\n\n\"You were a wise girl and I hope you'll do it again if you find, after a\ntime, that you and Steve do not truly trust and respect as well as love\none another. If you don't, you'll be miserable when it is too late, as\nso many people are who do marry in haste and have a lifetime to repent\nit. Aunt Jessie says so, and she knows.\"\n\n\"Don't be solemn, Rose. It fidgets me to think about life-times, and\nrespecting, and all those responsible things. I'm not used to it, and I\ndon't know how to do it.\"\n\n\"But you must think, and you must learn how before you take the\nresponsibility upon yourself. That is what your life is for, and you\nmustn't spoil it by doing a very solemn thing without seeing if you are\nready for it.\"\n\n\"Do you think about all this?\" asked Kitty, shrugging up her shoulders\nas if responsibility of any sort did not sit comfortably on them.\n\n\"One has to sometimes, you know. But is that all you wanted to tell me?\"\nadded Rose, anxious to turn the conversation from herself.\n\n\"Oh, dear, no! The most serious thing of all is this. Steve is putting\nhimself in order generally, and so I want to do my part, and I must\nbegin right away before my thoughts get distracted with clothes and all\nsorts of dear, delightful, frivolous things that I can't help liking.\nNow I wish you'd tell me where to begin. Shouldn't I improve my mind\nby reading something solid?\" And Kitty looked over at the well-filled\nbookcase as if to see if it contained anything large and dry enough to\nbe considered \"solid.\"\n\n\"It would be an excellent plan, and we'll look up something. What do you\nfeel as if you needed most?\"\n\n\"A little of everything I should say, for when I look into my mind there\nreally doesn't seem to be much there but odds and ends, and yet I'm sure\nI've read a great deal more than some girls do. I suppose novels don't\ncount, though, and are of no use, for, goodness knows, the people and\nthings they describe aren't a bit like the real ones.\"\n\n\"Some novels are very useful and do as much good as sermons, I've heard\nUncle say, because they not only describe truly, but teach so pleasantly\nthat people like to learn in that way,\" said Rose, who knew the sort of\nbooks Kitty had read and did not wonder that she felt rather astray when\nshe tried to guide herself by their teaching.\n\n\"You pick me out some of the right kind, and I'll apply my mind to\nthem. Then I ought to have some 'serious views' and 'methods' and\n'principles.' Steve said 'principles,' good firm ones, you know.\"\nAnd Kitty gave a little pull at the bit of cambric she was cutting as\nhousewives pull cotton or calico when they want \"a good firm article.\"\n\nRose could not help laughing now, though much pleased, for Kitty was so\nprettily in earnest, and yet so perfectly ignorant how to begin on the\nself-improvement she very much needed, that it was pathetic as well as\ncomical to see and hear her.\n\n\"You certainly want some of those, and must begin at once to get them,\nbut Aunt Jessie can help you there better than I can, or Aunt Jane, for\nshe has very 'firm' ones, I assure you,\" said Rose, sobering down as\nquickly as possible.\n\n\"Mercy on us! I should never dare to say a word about it to Mrs. Mac,\nfor I'm dreadfully afraid of her, she is so stern, and how I'm ever to\nget on when she is my mother-in-law I don't know!\" cried Kitty, clasping\nher hands in dismay at the idea.\n\n\"She isn't half as stern as she looks, and if you go to her without\nfear, you've no idea how sensible and helpful she is. I used to be\nfrightened out of my wits with her, but now I'm not a bit, and we get on\nnicely. Indeed, I'm fond of her, she is so reliable and upright in all\nthings.\"\n\n\"She certainly is the straightest woman I ever saw, and the most\nprecise. I never shall forget how scared I was when Steve took me up to\nsee her that first time. I put on all my plainest things, did my hair\nin a meek knob, and tried to act like a sober, sedate young woman. Steve\nwould laugh at me and say I looked like a pretty nun, so I couldn't be\nas proper as I wished. Mrs. Mac was very kind, of course, but her eye\nwas so sharp I felt as if she saw right through me, and knew that I'd\npinned on my bonnet strings, lost a button off my boot, and didn't brush\nmy hair for ten minutes every night,\" said Kitty in an awe-stricken\ntone.\n\n\"She likes you, though, and so does Uncle, and he's set his heart on\nhaving you live with them by and by, so don't mind her eyes but look\nstraight up at her, and you'll see how kind they can grow.\"\n\n\"Mac likes me, too, and that did please me, for he doesn't like girls\ngenerally. Steve told me he said I had the 'making of a capital little\nwoman in me.' Wasn't it nice of him? Steve was so proud, though he does\nlaugh at Mac sometimes.\"\n\n\"Don't disappoint them, dear. Encourage Steve in all the good things he\nlikes or wants, make friends with Mac, love Aunt Jane, and be a daughter\nto Uncle, and you'll find yourself a very happy girl.\"\n\n\"I truly will, and thank you very much for not making fun of me. I know\nI'm a little goose, but lately I've felt as if I might come to something\nif I had the right sort of help. I'll go up and see Aunt Jessie\ntomorrow. I'm not a bit afraid of her, and then if you'll just quietly\nfind out from Uncle Doctor what I must read, I'll work as hard as I\ncan. Don't tell anyone, please, they'll think it odd and affected, and I\ncan't bear to be laughed at, though I daresay it is good discipline.\"\n\nRose promised, and both worked in silence for a moment, then Kitty asked\nrather timidly: \"Are you and Charlie trying this plan too? Since you've\nleft off going out so much, he keeps away also, and we don't know what\nto make of it.\"\n\n\"He has had what he calls an 'artistic fit' lately, set up a studio, and\nis doing some crayon sketches of us all. If he'd only finish his things,\nthey would be excellent, but he likes to try a great variety at once.\nI'll take you in sometime, and perhaps he will do a portrait of you for\nSteve. He likes girls' faces and gets the likenesses wonderfully well.\"\n\n\"People say you are engaged but I contradict it, because, of course, I\nshould know if you were.\"\n\n\"We are not.\"\n\n\"I'm glad of it, for really, Rose, I'm afraid Charlie hasn't got 'firm\nprinciples,' though he is a fascinating fellow and one can't scold him.\nYou don't mind my saying so, do you, dear?\" added Kitty, for Rose did\nnot answer at once.\n\n\"Not in the least, for you are one of us now, and I can speak frankly\nand I will, for I think in one way you can help Steve very much. You\nare right about Charlie, both as to the principles and the fascination.\nSteve admires him exceedingly, and always from a boy liked to imitate\nhis pleasant ways. Some of them are very harmless and do Steve good, but\nsome are not. I needn't talk about it, only you must show your boy that\nyou depend on him to keep out of harm and help him do it.\"\n\n\"I will, I will! And then perhaps, when he is a perfect model, Charlie\nwill imitate him. I really begin to feel as if I had a great deal to\ndo.\" And Kitty looked as if she was beginning to like it also.\n\n\"We all have and the sooner we go to work the better for us and those we\nlove. You wouldn't think now that Phebe was doing anything for\nArchie, but she is, and writes such splendid letters, they stir him up\nwonderfully and make us all love and admire her more than ever.\"\n\n\"How is she getting on?\" asked Kitty, who, though she called herself a\n\"little goose,\" had tact enough to see that Rose did not care to talk\nabout Charlie.\n\n\"Nicely, for you know she used to sing in our choir, so that was a good\nrecommendation for another. She got a fine place in the new church at\nL----, and that gives her a comfortable salary, though she has something\nput away. She was always a saving creature and kept her wages carefully.\nUncle invested them, and she begins to feel quite independent already.\nNo fear but my Phebe will get on she has such energy and manages so\nwell. I sometimes wish I could run away and work with her.\"\n\n\"Ah, my dear! We rich girls have our trials as well as poor ones, though\nwe don't get as much pity as they do,\" sighed Kitty. \"Nobody knows what\nI suffer sometimes from worries that I can't talk about, and I shouldn't\nget much sympathy if I did, just because I live in a big house, wear\ngood gowns, and have lots of lovers. Annabel used to say she envied me\nabove all created beings, but she doesn't now, and is perfectly absorbed\nin her dear little Chinaman. Do you see how she ever could like him?\"\n\nSo they began to gossip, and the sober talk was over for that time, but\nwhen Kitty departed, after criticizing all her dear friends and their\nrespective sweethearts, she had a helpful little book in her muff, a\nresolute expression on her bright face, and so many excellent plans for\nself-improvement in her busy brain that she and Steve bid fair to turn\nout the model couple of the century.\n\n\n\n\nChapter 14 AUNT CLARA'S PLAN\n\nBeing seriously alarmed by the fear of losing the desire of his heart,\nCharlie had gone resolutely to work and, like many another young\nreformer, he rather overdid the matter, for in trying to keep out of\nthe way of temptation, he denied himself much innocent enjoyment. The\n\"artistic fit\" was a good excuse for the seclusion which he fancied\nwould be a proper penance, and he sat listlessly plying crayon or\npaintbrush, with daily wild rides on black Brutus, which seemed to do\nhim good, for danger of that sort was his delight.\n\nPeople were used to his whims and made light of what they considered a\nnew one, but when it lasted week after week and all attempts to draw him\nout were vain, his jolly comrades gave him up and the family began\nto say approvingly, \"Now he really is going to settle down and do\nsomething.\" Fortunately, his mother let him alone, for though Dr. Alec\nhad not \"thundered in her ear\" as he threatened, he had talked with her\nin a way which first made her very angry, then anxious, and, lastly,\nquite submissive, for her heart was set on the boy's winning Rose and\nshe would have had him put on sackcloth and ashes if that would have\nsecured the prize. She made light of the cause of Rose's displeasure,\nconsidering her extremely foolish and straitlaced, \"for all young men\nof any spirit had their little vices, and came out well enough when the\nwild oats were sowed.\" So she indulged Charlie in his new vagary, as she\nhad in all his others, and treated him like an ill-used being, which was\nneither an inspiring nor helpful course on her part. Poor soul! She saw\nher mistake by and by, and when too late repented of it bitterly.\n\nRose wanted to be kind, and tried in various ways to help her cousin,\nfeeling very sure she should succeed as many another hopeful woman has\ndone, quite unconscious how much stronger an undisciplined will is than\nthe truest love, and what a difficult task the wisest find it to undo\nthe mistakes of a bad education. But it was a hard thing to do, for at\nthe least hint of commendation or encouragement, he looked so hopeful\nthat she was afraid of seeming to promise too much, and, of all things,\nshe desired to escape the accusation of having trifled with him.\n\nSo life was not very comfortable to either just then; and while Charlie\nwas \"mortifying soul and body\" to please her, she was studying how to\nserve him best. Aunt Jessie helped her very much, and no one guessed,\nwhen they saw pretty Miss Campbell going up and down the hill with such\na serious face, that she was intent upon anything except taking, with\npraiseworthy regularity, the constitutionals which gave her such a\ncharming color.\n\nMatters were in this state when one day a note came to Rose from Mrs.\nClara.\n\nMY SWEET CHILD, Do take pity on my poor boy and cheer him up with a\nsight of you, for he is so triste it breaks my heart to see him. He has\na new plan in his head, which strikes me as an excellent one, if you\nwill only favor it. Let him come and take you for a drive this fine\nafternoon and talk things over. It will do him a world of good and\ndeeply oblige\n\nYour ever loving\n\nAUNT CLARA.\n\nRose read the note twice and stood a moment pondering, with her eyes\nabsently fixed on the little bay before her window. The sight of several\nblack figures moving briskly to and fro across its frozen surface seemed\nto suggest a mode of escape from the drive she dreaded in more ways than\none. \"That will be safer and pleasanter,\" she said, and going to her\ndesk wrote her answer.\n\nDEAR AUNTY, I'm afraid of Brutus, but if Charlie will go skating with\nme, I should enjoy it very much and it would do us both good. I can\nlisten to the new plan with an undivided mind there, so give him my\nlove, please, and say I shall expect him at three.\n\nAffectionately, ROSE.\n\nPunctually at three Charlie appeared with his skates over his arm and\nwith a very contented face, which brightened wonderfully as Rose came\ndownstairs in a sealskin suit and scarlet skirt, so like the one she\nwore years ago that he involuntarily exclaimed as he took her skates:\n\"You look so like little Rose I hardly know you, and it seems so like\nold times I feel sixteen again.\"\n\n\"That is just the way one ought to feel on such a day as this. Now let\nus be off and have a good spin before anyone comes. There are only a few\nchildren there now, but it is Saturday, you know, and everybody will be\nout before long,\" answered Rose, carefully putting on her mittens as she\ntalked, for her heart was not as light as the one little Rose carried\nunder the brown jacket, and the boy of sixteen never looked at her with\nthe love and longing she read in the eyes of the young man before her.\n\nAway they went, and were soon almost as merry and warm as the children\naround them, for the ice was in good condition, the February sunshine\nbrilliant, and the keen wind set their blood a-tingle with a healthful\nglow.\n\n\"Now tell me the plan your mother spoke of,\" began Rose as they went\ngliding across the wide expanse before them, for Charlie seemed to have\nforgotten everything but the bliss of having her all to himself for a\nlittle while.\n\n\"Plan? Oh, yes! It is simply this. I'm going out to Father next month.\"\n\n\"Really?\" and Rose looked both surprised and incredulous, for this plan\nwas not a new one.\n\n\"Really. You don't believe it, but I am, and mother means to go with\nme. We've had another letter from the governor, and he says if she can't\npart from her big baby to come along too, and all be happy together.\nWhat do you think of that?\" he asked, eyeing her intently, for they were\nface to face as she went backward and he held both of her hands to steer\nand steady her.\n\n\"I like it immensely, and do believe it now only it rather takes my\nbreath away to think of Aunty's going, when she never would hear of it\nbefore.\"\n\n\"She doesn't like the plan very well now and consents to go only on one\ncondition.\"\n\n\"What is that?\" asked Rose, trying to free her hands, for a look at\nCharlie made her suspect what was coming.\n\n\"That you go with us.\" And, holding the hands fast, he added rapidly,\n\"Let me finish before you speak. I don't mean that anything is to be\nchanged till you are ready, but if you go, I am willing to give up\neverything else and live anywhere as long as you like. Why shouldn't you\ncome to us for a year or two? We've never had our share. Father would be\ndelighted, mother contented, and I the happiest man alive.\"\n\n\"Who made this plan?\" asked Rose as soon as she got the breath which\ncertainly had been rather taken away by this entirely new and by no\nmeans agreeable scheme.\n\n\"Mother suggested it I shouldn't have dared even to dream of such\nrichness. I'd made up my mind to go alone, and when I told her, she\nwas in despair till this superb idea came into her head. After that, of\ncourse, it was easy enough for me to stick to the resolution I'd made.\"\n\n\"Why did you decide to go, Charlie?\" And Rose looked up into the eyes\nthat were fixed beseechingly on hers.\n\nThey wavered and glanced aside, then met hers honestly yet full of\nhumility, which made her own fall as he answered very low: \"Because I\ndon't dare to stay.\"\n\n\"Is it so hard?\" she said pitifully.\n\n\"Very hard. I haven't the moral courage to own up and face ridicule, and\nit seems so mean to hide for fear of breaking my word. I will keep it\nthis time, Rose, if I go to the ends of the earth to do it.\"\n\n\"It is not cowardly to flee temptation, and nobody whose opinion is\nworth having will ridicule any brave attempt to conquer one's self.\nDon't mind it, Charlie, but stand fast, and I am sure you will succeed.\"\n\n\"You don't know what it is, and I can't tell you, for till I tried to\ngive it up I never guessed what a grip it had on me. I thought it was\nonly a habit, easy to drop when I liked, but it is stronger than I, and\nsometimes I feel as if possessed of a devil that will get the better of\nme, try as I may.\"\n\nHe dropped her hands abruptly as he said that, with the energy of\ndespair; and, as if afraid of saying too much, he left her for a minute,\nstriking away at full speed, as if in truth he would \"go to the ends of\nthe earth\" to escape the enemy within himself.\n\nRose stood still, appalled by this sudden knowledge of how much greater\nthe evil was than she had dreamed. What ought she to do? Go with her\ncousin, and by so doing tacitly pledge herself as his companion on that\nlonger journey for which he was as yet so poorly equipped? Both heart\nand conscience protested against this so strongly that she put the\nthought away. But compassion pleaded for him tenderly, and the spirit of\nself-sacrifice, which makes women love to give more than they receive,\ncaused her to feel as if in a measure this man's fate lay in her hands,\nto be decided for good or ill through her. How should she be true both\nto him and to herself?\n\nBefore this question could be answered, he was back again, looking as if\nhe had left his care behind him, for his moods varied like the wind. Her\nattitude, as she stood motionless and alone with downcast face, was so\nunlike the cheerful creature who came to meet him an hour ago, it filled\nhim with self-reproach, and, coming up, he drew one hand through his\narm, saying, as she involuntarily followed him, \"You must not stand\nstill. Forget my heroics and answer my question. Will you go with us,\nRose?\"\n\n\"Not now that is asking too much, Charlie, and I will promise nothing,\nbecause I cannot do it honestly,\" she answered, so firmly that he knew\nappeal was useless.\n\n\"Am I to go alone, then, leaving all I care for behind me?\"\n\n\"No, take your mother with you, and do your best to reunite your\nparents. You could not give yourself to a better task.\"\n\n\"She won't go without you.\"\n\n\"I think she will if you hold fast to your resolution. You won't give\nthat up, I hope?\"\n\n\"No I must go somewhere, for I can't stay here, and it may as well be\nIndia, since that pleases Father,\" answered Charlie doggedly.\n\n\"It will more than you can imagine. Tell him all the truth, and see how\nglad he will be to help you, and how sincerely he will respect you for\nwhat you've done.\"\n\n\"If you respect me, I don't care much about the opinion of anyone else,\"\nanswered Charlie, clinging with a lover's pertinacity to the hope that\nwas dearest.\n\n\"I shall, if you go manfully away and do the duty you owe your father\nand yourself.\"\n\n\"And when I've done it, may I come back to be rewarded, Rose?\" he asked,\ntaking possession of the hand on his arm as if it was already his.\n\n\"I wish I could say what you want me to. But how can I promise when I am\nnot sure of anything? I don't love you as I ought, and perhaps I never\nshall so why persist in making me bind myself in this way? Be generous,\nCharlie, and don't ask it,\" implored Rose, much afflicted by his\npersistence.\n\n\"I thought you did love me it looked very like it a month ago, unless\nyou have turned coquette, and I can't quite believe that,\" he answered\nbitterly.\n\n\"I was beginning to love you, but you made me afraid to go on,\" murmured\nRose, trying to tell the truth kindly.\n\n\"That cursed custom! What can a man do when his hostess asks him to\ndrink wine with her?\" And Charlie looked as if he could have cursed\nhimself even more heartily.\n\n\"He can say 'no.'\"\n\n\"I can't.\"\n\n\"Ah, that's the trouble! You never learned to say it even to yourself,\nand now it is so hard, you want me to help you.\"\n\n\"And you won't.\"\n\n\"Yes, I will, by showing you that I can say it to myself, for your\nsake.\" And Rose looked up with a face so full of tender sorrow he could\nnot doubt the words which both reproached and comforted him.\n\n\"My little saint! I don't deserve one half your goodness to me, but I\nwill, and go away without one complaint to do my best, for your sake,\"\nhe cried, touched by her grief and stirred to emulation by the example\nof courage and integrity she tried to set him.\n\nHere Kitty and Steve bore down upon them; and, obeying the impulse to\nput care behind them, which makes it possible for young hearts to ache\none minute and dance the next, Rose and Charlie banished their troubles,\njoined in the sport that soon turned the lonely little bay into a\nballroom, and enjoyed the splendors of a winter sunset forgetful of\nseparation and Calcutta.\n\n\n\n\nChapter 15 ALAS FOR CHARLIE!\n\nIn spite of much internal rebellion, Charlie held fast to his\nresolution, and Aunt Clara, finding all persuasions vain, gave in and in\na state of chronic indignation against the world in general and Rose in\nparticular, prepared to accompany him. The poor girl had a hard time of\nit and, but for her uncle, would have fared still worse. He was a sort\nof shield upon which Mrs. Clara's lamentations, reproaches, and irate\nglances fell unavailingly instead of wounding the heart against which\nthey were aimed.\n\nThe days passed very quickly now, for everyone seemed anxious to have\nthe parting over and preparations went on rapidly. The big house was\nmade ready to shut up for a year at least, comforts for the long voyage\nlaid in, and farewell visits paid. The general activity and excitement\nrendered it impossible for Charlie to lead the life of an artistic\nhermit any longer and he fell into a restless condition which caused\nRose to long for the departure of the Rajah when she felt that he would\nbe safe, for these farewell festivities were dangerous to one who was\njust learning to say \"no.\"\n\n\"Half the month safely gone. If we can only get well over these last\nweeks, a great weight will be off my mind,\" thought Rose as she went\ndown one wild, wet morning toward the end of February.\n\nOpening the study door to greet her uncle, she exclaimed, \"Why, Archie!\"\nthen paused upon the threshold, transfixed by fear, for in her cousin's\nwhite face she read the tidings of some great affliction.\n\n\"Hush! Don't be frightened. Come in and I'll tell you,\" he whispered,\nputting down the bottle he had just taken from the doctor's medicine\ncloset.\n\nRose understood and obeyed, for Aunt Plenty was poorly with her\nrheumatism and depended on her morning doze.\n\n\"What is it?\" she said, looking about the room with a shiver, as if\nexpecting to see again what she saw there New Year's night. Archie was\nalone, however, and, drawing her toward the closet, answered with an\nevident effort to be quite calm and steady \"Charlie is hurt! Uncle wants\nmore ether and the wide bandages in some drawer or other. He told me,\nbut I forget. You keep this place in order find them for me. Quick!\"\n\nBefore he had done, Rose was at the drawer, turning over the bandages\nwith hands that trembled as they searched.\n\n\"All narrow! I must make some. Can you wait?\" And, catching up a piece\nof old linen, she tore it into wide strips, adding, in the same quick\ntone, as she began to roll them, \"Now, tell me.\"\n\n\"I can wait those are not needed just yet. I didn't mean anyone should\nknow, you least of all,\" began Archie, smoothing out the strips as they\nlay across the table and evidently surprised at the girl's nerve and\nskill.\n\n\"I can bear it make haste! Is he much hurt?\"\n\n\"I'm afraid he is. Uncle looks sober, and the poor boy suffers so, I\ncouldn't stay,\" answered Archie, turning still whiter about the lips\nthat never had so hard a tale to tell before.\n\n\"You see, he went to town last evening to meet the man who is going to\nbuy Brutus.\"\n\n\"And Brutus did it? I knew he would!\" cried Rose, dropping her work to\nwring her hands, as if she guessed the ending of the story now.\n\n\"Yes, and if he wasn't shot already I'd do it myself with pleasure, for\nhe's done his best to kill Charlie,\" muttered Charlie's mate with a grim\nlook, then gave a great sigh and added with averted face, \"I shouldn't\nblame the brute, it wasn't his fault. He needed a firm hand and--\" He\nstopped there, but Rose said quickly: \"Go on. I must know.\"\n\n\"Charlie met some of his old cronies, quite by accident; there was a\ndinner party, and they made him go, just for a good-bye, they said. He\ncouldn't refuse, and it was too much for him. He would come home alone\nin the storm, though they tried to keep him, as he wasn't fit. Down\nby the new bridge that high embankment, you know the wind had put the\nlantern out he forgot or something scared Brutus, and all went down\ntogether.\"\n\nArchie had spoken fast and brokenly but Rose understood and at the last\nword hid her face with a little moan, as if she saw it all.\n\n\"Drink this and never mind the rest,\" he said, dashing into the next\nroom and coming back with a glass of water, longing to be done and away,\nfor this sort of pain seemed almost as bad as that he had left.\n\nRose drank, but held his arm tightly, as he would have turned away,\nsaying in a tone of command he could not disobey: \"Don't keep anything\nback tell me the worst at once.\"\n\n\"We knew nothing of it,\" he went on obediently. \"Aunt Clara thought he\nwas with me, and no one found him till early this morning. A workman\nrecognized him and he was brought home, dead they thought. I came for\nUncle an hour ago. Charlie is conscious now, but awfully hurt, and I'm\nafraid from the way Mac and Uncle looked at one another that Oh! Think\nof it, Rose! Crushed and helpless, alone in the rain all night, and I\nnever knew, I never knew!\"\n\nWith that, poor Archie broke down entirely and, flinging himself into a\nchair, laid his face on the table, sobbing like a girl. Rose had never\nseen a man cry before, and it was so unlike a woman's gentler grief that\nit moved her very much. Putting by her own anguish, she tried to comfort\nhis and, going to him, lifted up his head and made him lean on her, for\nin such hours as this women are the stronger. It was a very little to\ndo, but it did comfort Archie, for the poor fellow felt as if fate was\nvery hard upon him just then, and in this faithful bosom he could pour\nhis brief but pathetic plaint.\n\n\"Phebe's gone, and now if Charlie's taken, I don't see how I can bear\nit!\"\n\n\"Phebe will come back, dear, and let us hope poor Charlie isn't going to\nbe taken yet. Such things always seem worst at first, I've heard people\nsay, so cheer up and hope for the best,\" answered Rose, seeking for some\ncomfortable words to say and finding very few.\n\nThey took effect, however, for Archie did cheer up like a man. Wiping\naway the tears which he so seldom shed that they did not know where to\ngo, he got up, gave himself a little shake, and said with a long breath,\nas if he had been underwater: \"Now I'm all right, thank you. I couldn't\nhelp it the shock of being waked suddenly to find the dear old fellow in\nsuch a pitiful state upset me. I ought to go are these ready?\"\n\n\"In a minute. Tell Uncle to send for me if I can be of any use. Oh, poor\nAunt Clara! How does she bear it?\"\n\n\"Almost distracted. I took Mother to her, and she will do all that\nanybody can. Heaven only knows what Aunt will do if--\"\n\n\"And only heaven can help her,\" added Rose as Archie stopped at the\nwords he could not utter. \"Now take them, and let me know often.\"\n\n\"You brave little soul, I will.\" And Archie went away through the\nrain with his sad burden, wondering how Rose could be so calm when the\nbeloved Prince might be dying.\n\nA long dark day followed, with nothing to break its melancholy monotony\nexcept the bulletins that came from hour to hour reporting little change\neither for better or for worse. Rose broke the news gently to Aunt\nPlenty and set herself to the task of keeping up the old lady's spirits,\nfor, being helpless, the good soul felt as if everything would go wrong\nwithout her. At dusk she fell asleep, and Rose went down to order lights\nand fire in the parlor, with tea ready to serve at any moment, for she\nfelt sure some of the men would come and that a cheerful greeting and\ncreature comforts would suit them better than tears, darkness, and\ndesolation.\n\nPresently Mac arrived, saying the instant he entered the room: \"More\ncomfortable, Cousin.\"\n\n\"Thank heaven!\" cried Rose, unclasping her hands. Then seeing how worn\nout, wet, and weary Mac looked as he came into the light, she added in\na tone that was a cordial in itself, \"Poor boy, how tired you are! Come\nhere, and let me make you comfortable.\"\n\n\"I was going home to freshen up a bit, for I must be back in an hour.\nMother took my place, so I could be spared, and came off, as Uncle\nrefused to stir.\"\n\n\"Don't go home, for if Aunty isn't there it will be very dismal. Step\ninto Uncle's room and refresh, then come back and I'll give you your\ntea. Let me, let me! I can't help in any other way, and I must do\nsomething, this waiting is so dreadful.\"\n\nHer last words betrayed how much suspense was trying her, and Mac\nyielded at once, glad to comfort and be comforted. When he came back,\nlooking much revived, a tempting little tea table stood before the fire\nand Rose went to meet him, saying with a faint smile, as she liberally\nbedewed him with the contents of a cologne flask: \"I can't bear the\nsmell of ether it suggests such dreadful things.\"\n\n\"What curious creatures women are! Archie told us you bore the news like\na hero, and now you turn pale at a whiff of bad air. I can't explain\nit,\" mused Mac as he meekly endured the fragrant shower bath.\n\n\"Neither can I, but I've been imagining horrors all day and made myself\nnervous. Don't let us talk about it, but come and have some tea.\"\n\n\"That's another queer thing. Tea is your panacea for all human ills\nyet there isn't any nourishment in it. I'd rather have a glass of milk,\nthank you,\" said Mac, taking an easy chair and stretching his feet to\nthe fire.\n\nShe brought it to him and made him eat something; then, as he shut his\neyes wearily, she went away to the piano and, having no heart to sing,\nplayed softly till he seemed asleep. But at the stroke of six he was up\nand ready to be off again.\n\n\"He gave me that. Take it with you and put some on his hair. He likes\nit, and I do so want to help a little,\" she said, slipping the pretty\nflagon into his pocket with such a wistful look Mac never thought of\nsmiling at this very feminine request.\n\n\"I'll tell him. Is there anything else I can do for you, Cousin?\" he\nasked, holding the cold hand that had been serving him so helpfully.\n\n\"Only this if there is any sudden change, promise to send for me, no\nmatter at what hour it is. I must say 'good-bye'\".\n\n\"I will come for you. But, Rose, I am sure you may sleep in peace\ntonight, and I hope to have good news for you in the morning.\"\n\n\"Bless you for that! Come early, and let me see him soon. I will be very\ngood, and I know it will not do him any harm.\"\n\n\"No fear of that. The first thing he said when he could speak was 'Tell\nRose carefully,' and as I came away he guessed where I was going and\ntried to kiss his hand in the old way, you know.\"\n\nMac thought it would cheer her to hear that Charlie remembered her, but\nthe sudden thought that she might never see the familiar little gesture\nanymore was the last drop that made her full heart overflow, and Mac saw\nthe \"hero\" of the morning sink down at his feet in a passion of tears\nthat frightened him. He took her to the sofa and tried to comfort her,\nbut as soon as the bitter sobbing quieted she looked up and said quite\nsteadily, great drops rolling down her cheeks the while: \"Let me cry it\nis what I need, and I shall be all the better for it by and by. Go to\nCharlie now and tell him I said with all my heart, 'Good night!'?\n\n\"I will!\" And Mac trudged away, marveling in his turn at the curiously\nblended strength and weakness of womankind.\n\nThat was the longest night Rose ever spent, but joy came in the morning\nwith the early message: \"He is better. You are to come by and by.\" Then\nAunt Plenty forgot her lumbago and arose; Aunt Myra, who had come to\nhave a social croak, took off her black bonnet as if it would not be\nneeded at present, and the girl made ready to go and say \"Welcome back,\"\nnot the hard \"Good-bye.\"\n\nIt seemed very long to wait, for no summons came till afternoon, then\nher uncle arrived, and at the first sight of his face Rose began to\ntremble.\n\n\"I came for my little girl myself, because we must go back at once,\" he\nsaid as she hurried toward him hat in hand.\n\n\"I'm ready, sir.\" But her hands shook as she tried to tie the ribbons,\nand her eyes never left the face that was full of tender pity for her.\n\nHe took her quickly into the carriage and, as they rolled away, said\nwith the quiet directness which soothes such agitation better than any\nsympathetic demonstration: \"Charlie is worse. I feared it when the pain\nwent so suddenly this morning, but the chief injuries are internal and\none can never tell what the chances are. He insists that he is better,\nbut he will soon begin to fail, I fear, become unconscious, and slip\naway without more suffering. This is the time for you to see him, for he\nhas set his heart on it, and nothing can hurt him now. My child, it is\nvery hard, but we must help each other bear it.\"\n\nRose tried to say, \"Yes, Uncle\" bravely, but the words would not\ncome, and she could only slip her hand into his with a look of mute\nsubmission. He laid her head on his shoulder and went on talking so\nquietly that anyone who did not see how worn and haggard his face had\ngrown with two days and a night of sharp anxiety might have thought him\ncold.\n\n\"Jessie has gone home to rest, and Jane is with poor Clara, who has\ndropped asleep at last. I've sent for Steve and the other boys. There\nwill be time for them later, but he so begged to see you now, I thought\nit best to come while this temporary strength keeps him up. I have\ntold him how it is, but he will not believe me. If he asks you, answer\nhonestly and try to fit him a little for this sudden ending of so many\nhopes.\"\n\n\"How soon, Uncle?\"\n\n\"A few hours, probably. This tranquil moment is yours make the most of\nit and, when we can do no more for him, we'll comfort one another.\"\n\nMac met them in the hall, but Rose hardly saw him. She was conscious\nonly of the task before her and, when her uncle led her to the door, she\nsaid quietly, \"Let me go in alone, please.\"\n\nArchie, who had been hanging over the bed, slipped away into the inner\nroom as she appeared, and Rose found Charlie waiting for her with such\na happy face, she could not believe what she had heard and found it easy\nto say almost cheerfully as she took his eager hand in both of hers:\n\"Dear Charlie, I'm so glad you sent for me. I longed to come, but waited\ntill you were better. You surely are?\" she added, as a second glance\nshowed to her the indescribable change which had come upon the face\nwhich at first seemed to have both light and color in it.\n\n\"Uncle says not, but I think he is mistaken, because the agony is all\ngone, and except for this odd sinking now and then, I don't feel so much\namiss,\" he answered feebly but with something of the old lightness in\nhis voice.\n\n\"You will hardly be able to sail in the Rajah, I fear, but you won't\nmind waiting a little while we nurse you,\" said poor Rose, trying to\ntalk on quietly, with her heart growing heavier every minute.\n\n\"I shall go if I'm carried! I'll keep that promise, though it costs\nme my life. Oh, Rose! You know? They've told you?\" And, with a sudden\nmemory of what brought him there, he hid his face in the pillow.\n\n\"You broke no promise, for I would not let you make one, you remember.\nForget all that, and let us talk about the better time that may be\ncoming for you.\"\n\n\"Always so generous, so kind!\" he murmured, with her hand against\nhis feverish cheek; then, looking up, he went on in a tone so humbly\ncontrite it made her eyes fill with slow, hot tears.\n\n\"I tried to flee temptation I tried to say 'no,' but I am so pitiably\nweak, I couldn't. You must despise me. But don't give me up entirely,\nfor if I live, I'll do better. I'll go away to Father and begin again.\"\n\nRose tried to keep back the bitter drops, but they would fall, to hear\nhim still speak hopefully when there was no hope. Something in the mute\nanguish of her face seemed to tell him what she could not speak, and a\nquick change came over him as he grasped her hand tighter, saying in a\nsharp whisper: \"Have I really got to die, Rose?\"\n\nHer only answer was to kneel down and put her arms about him, as if she\ntried to keep death away a little longer. He believed it then, and lay\nso still, she looked up in a moment, fearing she knew not what.\n\nBut Charlie bore it manfully, for he had the courage which can face a\ngreat danger bravely, though not the strength to fight a bosom sin and\nconquer it. His eyes were fixed, as if trying to look into the unseen\nworld whither he was going, and his lips firmly set that no word of\ncomplaint should spoil the proof he meant to give that, though he had\nnot known how to live, he did know how to die. It seemed to Rose as\nif for one brief instant she saw the man that might have been if early\ntraining had taught him how to rule himself; and the first words he\nuttered with a long sigh, as his eye came back to her, showed that he\nfelt the failure and owned it with pathetic candor.\n\n\"Better so, perhaps; better go before I bring any more sorrow to you and\nshame to myself. I'd like to stay a little longer and try to redeem the\npast; it seems so wasted now, but if I can't, don't grieve, Rose. I'm no\nloss to anyone, and perhaps it is too late to mend.\"\n\n\"Oh, don't say that! No one will find your place among us we never can\nforget how much we loved you, and you must believe how freely we forgive\nas we would be forgiven,\" cried Rose, steadied by the pale despair that\nhad fallen on Charlie's face with those bitter words.\n\n\"'Forgive us our trespasses!' Yes, I should say that. Rose, I'm not\nready, it is so sudden. What can I do?\" he whispered, clinging to her as\nif he had no anchor except the creature whom he loved so much.\n\n\"Uncle will tell you I am not good enough I can only pray for you.\" And\nshe moved as if to call in the help so sorely needed.\n\n\"No, no, not yet! Stay by me, darling read something there, in\nGrandfather's old book, some prayer for such as I. It will do me more\ngood from you than any minister alive.\"\n\nShe got the venerable book given to Charlie because he bore the good\nman's name and, turning to the \"Prayer for the Dying,\" read it brokenly\nwhile the voice beside her echoed now and then some word that reproved\nor comforted.\n\n\"The testimony of a good conscience.\" \"By the sadness of his countenance\nmay his heart be made better.\" \"Christian patience and fortitude.\"\n\"Leave the world in peace.\" \"Amen.\"\n\nThere was silence for a little; then Rose, seeing how wan he looked,\nsaid softly, \"Shall I call Uncle now?\"\n\n\"If you will. But first don't smile at my foolishness, dear I want my\nlittle heart. They took it off please give it back and let me keep it\nalways,\" he answered with the old fondness strong as ever, even when he\ncould show it only by holding fast the childish trinket which she found\nand had given him the old agate heart with the faded ribbon. \"Put it on,\nand never let them take it off,\" he said, and when she asked if there\nwas anything else she could do for him, he tried to stretch out his arms\nto her with a look which asked for more.\n\nShe kissed him very tenderly on lips and forehead, tried to say\n\"good-bye,\" but could not speak, and groped her way to the door. Turning\nfor a last look, Charlie's hopeful spirit rose for a moment, as if\nanxious to send her away more cheerful, and he said with a shadow of\nthe old blithe smile, a feeble attempt at the familiar farewell gesture:\n\"Till tomorrow, Rose.\"\n\nAlas for Charlie! His tomorrow never came, and when she saw him next, he\nlay there looking so serene and noble, it seemed as if it must be well\nwith him, for all the pain was past; temptation ended; doubt and fear,\nhope and love, could no more stir his quiet heart, and in solemn truth\nhe had gone to meet his Father, and begin again.\n\n\n\n\nChapter 16 GOOD WORKS\n\nThe Rajah was delayed awhile, and when it sailed poor Mrs. Clara was\non board, for everything was ready. All thought she had better go to\ncomfort her husband, and since her boy died she seemed to care very\nlittle what became of her. So, with friends to cheer the long voyage,\nshe sailed away, a heavyhearted woman, yet not quite disconsolate,\nfor she knew her mourning was excessively becoming and felt sure that\nStephen would not find her altered by her trials as much as might have\nbeen expected.\n\n\nThen nothing was left of that gay household but the empty rooms, silence\nnever broken by a blithe voice anymore, and pictures full of promise,\nbut all unfinished, like poor Charlie's life.\n\nThere was much mourning for the bonny Prince, but no need to tell of it\nexcept as it affected Rose, for it is with her we have most to do, the\nother characters being of secondary importance.\n\nWhen time had soothed the first shock of sudden loss, she was surprised\nto find the memory of his faults and failings, short life and piteous\ndeath, grew dim, as if a kindly hand had wiped out the record and given\nhim back to her in the likeness of the brave, bright boy she had loved,\nnot as the wayward, passionate young man who had loved her.\n\nThis comforted her very much, and folding down the last blotted leaf\nwhere his name was written, she gladly turned back to reopen and reread\nthe happier chapters which painted the youthful knight before he went\nout to fall in his first battle. None of the bitterness of love\nbereaved marred this memory for Rose, because she found that the warmer\nsentiment, just budding in her heart, had died with Charlie and lay cold\nand quiet in his grave. She wondered, yet was glad, though sometimes a\nremorseful pang smote her when she discovered how possible it was to go\non without him, feeling almost as if a burden had been lifted off, since\nhis happiness was taken out of her hands. The time had not yet come when\nthe knowledge that a man's heart was in her keeping would make the pride\nand joy of her life, and while she waited for that moment she enjoyed\nthe liberty she seemed to have recovered.\n\nSuch being her inward state, it much annoyed her to be regarded as a\nbrokenhearted girl and pitied for the loss of her young lover. She could\nnot explain to all the world, so let it pass, and occupied her mind with\nthe good works which always lie ready to be taken up and carried on.\nHaving chosen philanthropy as her profession, she felt that it was high\ntime to begin the task too long neglected.\n\nHer projects were excellent, but did not prosper as rapidly as she\nhoped, for, having to deal with people, not things, unexpected obstacles\nwere constantly arising. The \"Home for Decayed Gentlewomen,\" as the boys\ninsisted on calling her two newly repaired houses, started finely and\nit was a pleasant sight to see the comfortable rooms filled with\nrespectable women busy at their various tasks, surrounded by the\ndecencies and many of the comforts which make life endurable. But,\npresently, Rose was disturbed to find that the good people expected her\nto take care of them in a way she had not bargained for. Buffum, her\nagent, was constantly reporting complaints, new wants, and general\ndiscontent if they were not attended to. Things were very neglected,\nwater pipes froze and burst, drains got out of order, yards were in\na mess, and rents behind-hand. Worst of all, outsiders, instead of\nsympathizing, only laughed and said, \"We told you so,\" which is a most\ndiscouraging remark to older and wiser workers than Rose.\n\nUncle Alec, however, stood by her staunchly and helped her out of many\nof her woes by good advice and an occasional visit of inspection, which\ndid much to impress upon the dwellers there the fact that, if they did\nnot do their part, their leases would be short ones.\n\n\"I didn't expect to make anything out of it, but I did think they would\nbe grateful,\" said Rose on one occasion when several complaints had come\nin at once and Buffum had reported great difficulty in collecting the\nlow rents.\n\n\"If you do this thing for the sake of the gratitude, then it is a\nfailure but if it is done for the love of helping those who need help,\nit is a success, for in spite of their worry every one of these women\nfeel what privileges they enjoy and value them highly,\" said Dr. Alec as\nthey went home after one of these unsatisfactory calls.\n\n\"Then the least they can do is to say 'thank you.' I'm afraid I have\nthought more of the gratitude than the work, but if there isn't any, I\nmust make up my mind to go without,\" answered Rose, feeling defrauded of\nher due.\n\n\"Favors often separate instead of attracting people nearer to one\nanother, and I've seen many a friendship spoilt by the obligation being\nall on one side. Can't explain it, but it is so, and I've come to the\nconclusion that it is as hard to give in the right spirit as it is to\nreceive. Puzzle it out, my dear, while you are learning to do good for\nits own sake.\"\n\n\"I know one sort of people who are grateful and I'm going to devote\nmy mind to them. They thank me in many ways, and helping them is all\npleasure and no worry. Come into the hospital and see the dear babies,\nor the Asylum, and carry oranges to Phebe's orphans they don't complain\nand fidget one's life out, bless their hearts!\" cried Rose, cheering up\nsuddenly.\n\nAfter that she left Buffum to manage the \"Retreat,\" and devoted her\nenergies to the little folks, always so ready to receive the smallest\ngift and repay the giver with their artless thanks. Here she found\nplenty to do, and did it with such sweet goodwill that she won her way\nlike sunshine, making many a little heart dance over splendid dolls, gay\npicture books, and pots of flowers, as well as food, fire, and clothes\nfor the small bodies pinched with want and pain.\n\nAs spring came new plans sprang up as naturally as dandelions. The poor\nchildren longed for the country; and, as the green fields could not come\nto them, Rose carried them to the green fields. Down on the Point stood\nan old farmhouse, often used by the Campbell tribe for summer holidays.\nThat spring it was set to rights unusually early, several women\ninstalled as housekeeper, cook, and nurses, and when the May days grew\nbright and warm, squads of pale children came to toddle in the grass,\nrun over the rocks, and play upon the smooth sands of the beach. A\npretty sight, and one that well repaid those who brought it to pass.\n\nEveryone took an interest in the \"Rose Garden,\" as Mac named it, and the\nwomenfolk were continually driving over to the Point for something for\nthe \"poor dears.\" Aunt Plenty sowed gingerbread broadcast; Aunt Jessie\nmade pinafores by the dozen while Aunt Jane \"kept her eye\" on the\nnurses, and Aunt Myra supplied medicines so liberally that the mortality\nwould have been awful if Dr. Alec had not taken them in charge. To him\nthis was the most delightful spot in the world and well it might be, for\nhe suggested the idea and gave Rose all the credit of it. He was often\nthere, and his appearance was always greeted with shrieks of rapture,\nas the children gathered from all quarters creeping, running, hopping\non crutches, or carried in arms which they gladly left to sit on \"Uncle\nDoctor's\" knee, for that was the title by which he went among them.\n\nHe seemed as young as any of his comrades, though the curly head was\ngetting gray, and the frolics that went on when he arrived were better\nthan any medicine to children who had never learned to play. It was\na standing joke among the friends that the bachelor brother had the\nlargest family and was the most domestic man of the remaining four,\nthough Uncle Mac did his part manfully and kept Aunt Jane in a constant\nfidget by his rash propositions to adopt the heartiest boys and\nprettiest girls to amuse him and employ her.\n\nOn one occasion Aunt Jane had a very narrow escape, and the culprit\nbeing her son, not her husband, she felt free to repay herself for many\nscares of this sort by a good scolding, which, unlike many, produced\nexcellent results.\n\nOne bright June day, as Rose came cantering home from the Point on her\npretty bay pony, she saw a man sitting on a fallen tree beside the road\nand something in his despondent attitude arrested her attention. As she\ndrew nearer he turned his head, and she stopped short, exclaiming in\ngreat surprise: \"Why, Mac! What are you doing here?\"\n\n\"Trying to solve a problem,\" he answered, looking up with a whimsical\nexpression of perplexity and amusement in his face which made Rose smile\ntill his next words turned her sober in a twinkling: \"I've eloped with\na young lady, and don't know what to do with her. I took her home, of\ncourse, but mother turned her out of the house, and I'm in a quandary.\"\n\n\"Is that her baggage?\" asked Rose, pointing with her whip to the large\nbundle which he held while the wild idea flashed through her head that\nperhaps he really had done some rash deed of this sort.\n\n\"No, this is the young lady herself.\" And, opening a corner of the brown\nshawl, he displayed a child of three so pale, so thin and tiny that she\nlooked like a small scared bird just fallen from the nest as she shrank\naway from the light with great frightened eyes and a hand like a little\nclaw tightly clutched a button of Mac's coat.\n\n\"Poor baby! Where did it come from?\" cried Rose, leaning down to look.\n\n\"I'll tell you the story, and then you shall advise me what to do. At\nour hospital we've had a poor woman who got hurt and died two days\nago. I had nothing to do with her, only took her a bit of fruit once or\ntwice, for she had big, wistful sort of eyes that haunted me. The day\nshe died I stopped a minute, and the nurse said she'd been wanting to\nspeak to me but didn't dare. So I asked if I could do anything for her\nand, though she could hardly breathe for pain being almost gone she\nimplored me to take care of baby. I found out where the child was, and\npromised I'd see after her for the poor soul couldn't seem to die till\nI'd given her that comfort. I never can forget the look in her eyes as\nI held her hand and said, 'Baby shall be taken care of.' She tried to\nthank me, and died soon after quite peacefully. Well, I went today and\nhunted up the poor little wretch. Found her in a miserable place, left\nin the care of an old hag who had shut her up alone to keep her out of\nthe way, and there this mite was, huddled in a corner, crying 'Marmar,\nmarmar!' fit to touch a heart of stone. I blew up at the woman and took\nthe baby straightaway, for she had been abused. It was high time. Look\nthere, will you?\"\n\nMac turned the little skinny arm and showed a blue mark which made Rose\ndrop her reins and stretch out both hands, crying with a tender sort\nof indignation: \"How dared they do it? Give her to me, poor little\nmotherless thing!\"\n\nMac laid the bundle in her arms, and Rose began to cuddle it in the\nfond, foolish way women have a most comfortable and effective way,\nnevertheless and baby evidently felt that things were changing for\nthe better when warm lips touched her cheeks, a soft hand smoothed her\ntumbled hair, and a womanly face bent over her with the inarticulate\ncooings and purrings mothers make. The frightened eyes went up to this\ngentle countenance and rested there as if reassured; the little claw\ncrept to the girl's neck, and poor baby nestled to her with a long sigh\nand a plaintive murmur of \"Marmar, marmar\" that certainly would have\ntouched a stony heart.\n\n\"Now, go on. No, Rosa, not you,\" said the new nurse as the intelligent\nanimal looked around to see if things were all right before she\nproceeded.\n\n\"I took the child home to mother, not knowing what else to do, but\nshe wouldn't have it at any price, even for a night. She doesn't like\nchildren, you know, and Father has joked so much about 'the Pointers'\nthat she is quite rampant at the mere idea of a child in the house. She\ntold me to take it to the Rose Garden. I said it was running over now,\nand no room even for a mite like this. 'Go to the Hospital,' says she.\n'Baby isn't ill, ma'am,' says I. 'Orphan Asylum,' says she. 'Not an\norphan got a father who can't take care of her,' says I. 'Take her to\nthe Foundling place, or Mrs. Gardener, or someone whose business it is.\nI will not have the creature here, sick and dirty and noisy. Carry it\nback, and ask Rose to tell you what to do with it.' So my cruel parent\ncast me forth but relented as I shouldered baby, gave me a shawl to put\nher in, a jumble to feed her with, and money to pay her board in some\ngood place. Mother's bark is always worse than her bite, you know.\"\n\n\"And you were trying to think of the 'good place' as you sat here?\"\nasked Rose, looking down at him with great approval as he stood patting\nRosa's glossy neck.\n\n\"Exactly. I didn't want to trouble you, for you have your house full\nalready, and I really couldn't lay my hand on any good soul who would be\nbothered with this little forlornity. She has nothing to recommend her,\nyou see not pretty; feeble; shy as a mouse; no end of care, I daresay\nyet she needs every bit she can get to keep soul and body together, if\nI'm any judge.\"\n\nRose opened her lips impulsively, but closed them without speaking and\nsat a minute looking straight between Rosa's ears, as if forcing herself\nto think twice before she spoke. Mac watched her out of the corner of\nhis eyes as he said, in a musing tone, tucking the shawl around a pair\nof shabby little feet the while, \"This seems to be one of the charities\nthat no one wants to undertake, yet I can't help feeling that my promise\nto the mother binds me to something more than merely handing baby\nover to some busy matron or careless nurse in any of our overcrowded\ninstitutions. She is such a frail creature she won't trouble anyone\nlong, perhaps, and I should like to give her just a taste of comfort, if\nnot love, before she finds her 'Marmar' again.\"\n\n\"Lead Rosa I'm going to take this child home, and if Uncle is willing,\nI'll adopt her, and she shall be happy!\" cried Rose, with the sudden\nglow of feeling that always made her lovely. And gathering poor baby\nclose, she went on her way like a modern Britomart, ready to redress the\nwrongs of any who had need of her.\n\nAs he led the slowly stepping horse along the quiet road, Mac could not\nhelp thinking that they looked a little like the Flight into Egypt, but\nhe did not say so, being a reverent youth only glanced back now and\nthen at the figure above him, for Rose had taken off her hat to keep the\nlight from baby's eyes and sat with the sunshine turning her uncovered\nhair to gold as she looked down at the little creature resting on the\nsaddle before her with the sweet thoughtfulness one sees in some of\nCorreggio's young Madonnas.\n\nNo one else saw the picture, but Mac long remembered it, and ever after\nthere was a touch of reverence added to the warm affection he had always\nborne his cousin Rose.\n\n\"What is the child's name?\" was the sudden question which disturbed a\nbrief silence, broken only by the sound of pacing hoofs, the rustle of\ngreen boughs overhead, and the blithe caroling of birds.\n\n\"I'm sure I don't know,\" answered Mac, suddenly aware that he had fallen\nout of one quandary into another.\n\n\"Didn't you ask?\"\n\n\"No, the mother called her 'Baby,' and the old woman, 'Brat.' And that\nis all I know of the first name the last is Kennedy. You may christen\nher what you like.\"\n\n\"Then I shall name her Dulcinea, as you are her knight, and call her\nDulce for short. That is a sweet diminutive, I'm sure,\" laughed Rose,\nmuch amused at the idea.\n\nDon Quixote looked pleased and vowed to defend his little lady stoutly,\nbeginning his services on the spot by filling the small hands with\nbuttercups, thereby winning for himself the first smile baby's face had\nknown for weeks.\n\nWhen they got home Aunt Plenty received her new guest with her\naccustomed hospitality and, on learning the story, was as warmly\ninterested as even enthusiastic Rose could desire, bustling about to\nmake the child comfortable with an energy pleasant to see, for the\ngrandmotherly instincts were strong in the old lady and of late had been\nbeautifully developed.\n\nIn less than half an hour from the time baby went upstairs, she came\ndown again on Rose's arm, freshly washed and brushed, in a pink gown\nmuch too large and a white apron decidedly too small; an immaculate pair\nof socks, but no shoes; a neat bandage on the bruised arm, and a string\nof spools for a plaything hanging on the other. A resigned expression\nsat upon her little face, but the frightened eyes were only shy now, and\nthe forlorn heart evidently much comforted.\n\n\"There! How do you like your Dulce now?\" said Rose, proudly displaying\nthe work of her hands as she came in with her habit pinned up and\ncarrying a silver porringer of bread and milk.\n\nMac knelt down, took the small, reluctant hand, and kissed it as\ndevoutly as ever good Alonzo Quixada did that of the Duchess while he\nsaid, merrily quoting from the immortal story: \"'High and Sovereign\nLady, thine till death, the Knight of the Rueful Countenance.'\"\n\nBut baby had no heart for play and, withdrawing her hand, pointed to the\nporringer with the suggestive remark: \"Din-din, now.\"\n\nSo Rose sat down and fed the Duchess while the Don stood by and watched\nthe feast with much satisfaction.\n\n\"How nice she looks! Do you consider shoes unhealthy?\" he asked,\nsurveying the socks with respectful interest.\n\n\"No, her shoes are drying. You must have let her go in the mud.\"\n\n\"I only put her down for a minute when she howled, and she made for a\npuddle, like a duck. I'll buy her some new ones clothes too. Where do I\ngo, what do I ask for, and how much do I get?\" he said, diving for his\npocketbook, amiably anxious but pitiably ignorant.\n\n\"I'll see to that. We always have things on hand for the Pointers as\nthey come along and can soon fit Dulce out. You may make some inquiries\nabout the father if you will, for I don't want to have her taken away\njust as I get fond of her. Do you know anything about him?\"\n\n\"Only that he is in State Prison for twenty-one years, and not likely to\ntrouble you.\"\n\n\"How dreadful! I really think Phebe was better off to have none at all.\nI'll go to work at once, then, and try to bring up the convict's little\ndaughter to be a good woman so that she will have an honest name of her\nown, since he has nothing but disgrace to give her.\"\n\n\"Uncle can show you how to do that if you need any help. He has been so\nsuccessful in his first attempt, I fancy you won't require much,\" said\nMac, picking up the spools for the sixth time.\n\n\"Yes, I shall, for it is a great responsibility, and I do not undertake\nit lightly,\" answered Rose soberly, though the double-barreled\ncompliment pleased her very much.\n\n\"I'm sure Phebe has turned out splendidly, and you began very early with\nher.\"\n\n\"So I did! That's encouraging. Dear thing, how bewildered she looked\nwhen I proposed adopting her. I remember all about it, for Uncle had\njust come and I was quite crazy over a box of presents and rushed at\nPhebe as she was cleaning brasses. How little I thought my childish\noffer would end so well!\" And Rose fell a-musing with a happy smile on\nher face while baby picked the last morsels out of the porringer with\nher own busy fingers.\n\nIt certainly had ended well, for Phebe at the end of six months not only\nhad a good place as choir singer but several young pupils and excellent\nprospects for the next winter.\n\n\"Accept the blessing of a poor young man, Whose lucky steps have led him\nto your door, and let me help as much as I can. Good-bye, my Dulcinea.\"\n\nAnd, with a farewell stroke of the smooth head, Mac went away to report\nhis success to his mother, who, in spite of her seeming harshness, was\nalready planning how she could best befriend this inconvenient baby.\n\n\n\n\nChapter 17 AMONG THE HAYCOCKS\n\nUncle Alec did not object and, finding that no one had any claim upon\nthe child, permitted Rose to keep it for a time at least. So little\nDulce, newly equipped even to a name, took her place among them and\nslowly began to thrive. But she did not grow pretty and never was a gay,\nattractive child, for she seemed to have been born in sorrow and brought\nup in misery. A pale, pensive little creature, always creeping into\ncorners and looking timidly out, as if asking leave to live, and, when\noffered playthings, taking them with a meek surprise that was very\ntouching.\n\nRose soon won her heart, and then almost wished she had not, for baby\nclung to her with inconvenient fondness, changing her former wail of\n\"Marmar\" into a lament for \"Aunty Wose\" if separated long. Nevertheless,\nthere was great satisfaction in cherishing the little waif, for she\nlearned more than she could teach and felt a sense of responsibility\nwhich was excellent ballast for her enthusiastic nature.\n\nKitty Van, who made Rose her model in all things, was immediately\ninspired to go and do likewise, to the great amusement as well as\nannoyance of her family. Selecting the prettiest, liveliest child in\nthe Asylum, she took it home on trial for a week. \"A perfect cherub\" she\npronounced it the first day, but an \"enfant terrible\" before the week\nwas over, for the young hero rioted by day, howled by night, ravaged the\nhouse from top to bottom, and kept his guardians in a series of panics\nby his hairbreadth escapes. So early on Saturday, poor exhausted Kitty\nrestored the \"cherub\" with many thanks, and decided to wait until her\nviews of education were rather more advanced.\n\nAs the warm weather came on, Rose announced that Dulce needed mountain\nair, for she dutifully repeated as many of Dr. Alec's prescriptions as\npossible and, remembering how much good Cozy Corner did her long ago,\nresolved to try it on her baby. Aunt Jessie and Jamie went with her, and\nMother Atkinson received them as cordially as ever. The pretty daughters\nwere all married and gone, but a stout damsel took their place, and\nnothing seemed changed except that the old heads were grayer and the\nyoung ones a good deal taller than six years ago.\n\nJamie immediately fraternized with neighboring boys and devoted himself\nto fishing with an ardor which deserved greater success. Aunt Jessie\nreveled in reading, for which she had no time at home, and lay in\nher hammock a happy woman, with no socks to darn, buttons to sew, or\nhousekeeping cares to vex her soul. Rose went about with Dulce like a\nvery devoted hen with one rather feeble chicken, for she was anxious to\nhave this treatment work well and tended her little patient with\ndaily increasing satisfaction. Dr. Alec came up to pass a few days and\npronounced the child in a most promising condition. But the grand event\nof the season was the unexpected arrival of Phebe.\n\nTwo of her pupils had invited her to join them in a trip to the\nmountains, and she ran away from the great hotel to surprise her little\nmistress with a sight of her, so well and happy that Rose had no anxiety\nleft on her account.\n\nThree delightful days they spent, roaming about together, talking as\nonly girls can talk after a long separation, and enjoying one another\nlike a pair of lovers. As if to make it quite perfect, by one of those\nremarkable coincidences which sometimes occur, Archie happened to run\nup for the Sunday, so Phebe had her surprise, and Aunt Jessie and the\ntelegraph kept their secret so well, no one ever knew what maternal\nmachinations brought the happy accident to pass.\n\nThen Rose saw a very pretty, pastoral bit of lovemaking, and long after\nit was over, and Phebe gone one way, Archie another, the echo of sweet\nwords seemed to linger in the air, tender ghosts to haunt the pine\ngrove, and even the big coffeepot had a halo of romance about it, for\nits burnished sides reflected the soft glances the lovers interchanged\nas one filled the other's cup at that last breakfast.\n\nRose found these reminiscences more interesting than any novel she had\nread, and often beguiled her long leisure by planning a splendid future\nfor her Phebe as she trotted about after her baby in the lovely July\nweather.\n\nOn one of the most perfect days she sat under an old apple tree on the\nslope behind the house where they used to play. Before her opened the\nwide intervale, dotted with haymakers at their picturesque work. On the\nleft flowed the swift river fringed with graceful elms in their bravest\ngreenery; on the right rose the purple hills serene and grand; and\noverhead glowed the midsummer sky, which glorified it all.\n\nLittle Dulce, tired of play, lay fast asleep in the nest she had made\nin one of the haycocks close by, and Rose leaned against the gnarled old\ntree, dreaming daydreams with her work at her feet. Happy and absorbing\nfancies they seemed to be, for her face was beautifully tranquil, and\nshe took no heed of the train which suddenly went speeding down the\nvalley, leaving a white cloud behind. Its rumble concealed the sound of\napproaching steps, and her eyes never turned from the distant hills till\nthe abrupt appearance of a very sunburned but smiling young man made her\njump up, exclaiming joyfully: \"Why, Mac! Where did you drop from?\"\n\n\"The top of Mount Washington. How do you do?\"\n\n\"Never better. Won't you go in? You must be tired after such a fall.\"\n\n\"No, thank you. I've seen the old lady. She told me Aunt Jessie and the\nboy had gone to town and that you were 'settin' round' in the old\nplace. I came on at once and will take a lounge here if you don't mind,\"\nanswered Mac, unstrapping his knapsack and taking a haycock as if it\nwere a chair.\n\nRose subsided into her former seat, surveying her cousin with much\nsatisfaction as she said: \"This is the third surprise I've had since I\ncame. Uncle popped in upon us first, then Phebe, and now you. Have you\nhad a pleasant tramp? Uncle said you were off.\"\n\n\"Delightful! I feel as if I'd been in heaven, or near it, for about\nthree weeks, and thought I'd break the shock of coming down to the earth\nby calling here on my way home.\"\n\n\"You look as if heaven suited you. Brown as a berry, but so fresh and\nhappy I should never guess you had been scrambling down a mountain,\"\nsaid Rose, trying to discover why he looked so well in spite of the blue\nflannel suit and dusty shoes, for there was a certain sylvan freshness\nabout him as he sat there full of reposeful strength the hills seemed to\nhave given, the wholesome cheerful days of air and sunshine put into a\nman, and the clear, bright look of one who had caught glimpses of a new\nworld from the mountaintop.\n\n\"Tramping agrees with me. I took a dip in the river as I came along and\nmade my toilet in a place where Milton's Sabrina might have lived,\"\nhe said, shaking back his damp hair and settling the knot of scarlet\nbunchberries stuck in his buttonhole.\n\n\"You look as if you found the nymph at home,\" said Rose, knowing how\nmuch he liked the \"Comus.\"\n\n\"I found her here,\" and he made a little bow.\n\n\"That's very pretty, and I'll give you one in return. You grow more like\nUncle Alec every day, and I think I'll call you Alec, Jr.\"\n\n\"Alexander the Great wouldn't thank you for that,\" and Mac did not look\nas grateful as she had expected.\n\n\"Very like, indeed, except the forehead. His is broad and benevolent,\nyours high and arched. Do you know if you had no beard, and wore your\nhair long, I really think you'd look like Milton,\" added Rose, sure that\nwould please him.\n\nIt certainly did amuse him, for he lay back on the hay and laughed so\nheartily that his merriment scared the squirrel on the wall and woke\nDulce.\n\n\"You ungrateful boy! Will nothing suit you? When I say you look like the\nbest man I know, you gave a shrug, and when I liken you to a great poet,\nyou shout. I'm afraid you are very conceited, Mac.\" And Rose laughed,\ntoo, glad to see him so gay.\n\n\"If I am, it is your fault. Nothing I can do will ever make a Milton of\nme, unless I go blind someday,\" he said, sobering at the thought.\n\n\"You once said a man could be what he liked if he tried hard enough, so\nwhy shouldn't you be a poet?\" asked Rose, liking to trip him up with his\nown words, as he often did her.\n\n\"I thought I was to be an M.D.\"\n\n\"You might be both. There have been poetical doctors, you know.\"\n\n\"Would you like me to be such a one?\" asked Mac, looking at her as\nseriously as if he really thought of trying it.\n\n\"No. I'd rather have you one or the other. I don't care which, only\nyou must be famous in either you choose. I'm very ambitious for you,\nbecause, I insist upon it, you are a genius of some sort. I think it is\nbeginning to simmer already, and I've got a great curiosity to know what\nit will turn out to be.\"\n\nMac's eyes shone as she said that, but before he could speak a little\nvoice said, \"Aunty Wose!\" and he turned to find Dulce sitting up in her\nnest staring at the broad blue back before her with round eyes.\n\n\"Do you know your Don?\" he asked, offering his hand with respectful\ngentleness, for she seemed a little doubtful whether he was a friend or\nstranger.\n\n\"It is 'Mat,'\" said Rose, and that familiar word seemed to reassure the\nchild at once, for, leaning forward, she kissed him as if quite used to\ndoing it.\n\n\"I picked up some toys for her, by the way, and she shall have them at\nonce to pay for that. I didn't expect to be so graciously received by\nthis shy mouse,\" said Mac, much gratified, for Dulce was very chary of\nher favors.\n\n\"She knew you, for I always carry my home album with me, and when she\ncomes to your picture she always kisses it, because I never want her to\nforget her first friend,\" explained Rose, pleased with her pupil.\n\n\"First, but not best,\" answered Mac, rummaging in his knapsack for the\npromised toys, which he set forth upon the hay before delighted Dulce.\n\nNeither picture books nor sweeties, but berries strung on long stems of\ngrass, acorns, and pretty cones, bits of rock shining with mica, several\nbluebirds' feathers, and a nest of moss with white pebbles for eggs.\n\n\"Dearest Nature, strong and kind\" knows what children love, and has\nplenty of such playthings ready for them all, if one only knows how\nto find them. These were received with rapture. And leaving the little\ncreature to enjoy them in her own quiet way, Mac began to tumble the\nthings back into his knapsack again. Two or three books lay near Rose,\nand she took up one which opened at a place marked by a scribbled paper.\n\n\"Keats? I didn't know you condescended to read anything so modern,\" she\nsaid, moving the paper to see the page beneath.\n\nMac looked up, snatched the book out of her hand, and shook down several\nmore scraps, then returned it with a curiously shamefaced expression,\nsaying, as he crammed the papers into his pocket, \"I beg pardon, but it\nwas full of rubbish. Oh, yes! I'm fond of Keats. Don't you know him?\"\n\n\"I used to read him a good deal, but Uncle found me crying over the 'Pot\nof Basil' and advised me to read less poetry for a while or I should get\ntoo sentimental,\" answered Rose, turning the pages without seeing them,\nfor a new idea had just popped into her head.\n\n\"'The Eve of St. Agnes' is the most perfect love story in the world, I\nthink,\" said Mac, enthusiastically.\n\n\"Read it to me. I feel just like hearing poetry, and you will do it\njustice if you are fond of it,\" said Rose, handing him the book with an\ninnocent air.\n\n\"Nothing I'd like better, but it is rather long.\"\n\n\"I'll tell you to stop if I get tired. Baby won't interrupt; she will be\ncontented for an hour with those pretty things.\"\n\nAs if well pleased with his task, Mac laid himself comfortably on the\ngrass and, leaning his head on his hand, read the lovely story as only\none could who entered fully into the spirit of it. Rose watched him\nclosely and saw how his face brightened over some quaint fancy, delicate\ndescription, or delicious word; heard how smoothly the melodious\nmeasures fell from his lips, and read something more than admiration in\nhis eyes as he looked up now and then to mark if she enjoyed it as much\nas he.\n\nShe could not help enjoying it, for the poet's pen painted as well as\nwrote, and the little romance lived before her, but she was not thinking\nof John Keats as she listened; she was wondering if this cousin was\na kindred spirit, born to make such music and leave as sweet an echo\nbehind him. It seemed as if it might be; and, after going through the\nrough caterpillar and the pent-up chrysalis changes, the beautiful\nbutterfly would appear to astonish and delight them all. So full of\nthis fancy was she that she never thanked him when the story ended but,\nleaning forward, asked in a tone that made him start and look as if he\nhad fallen from the clouds: \"Mac, do you ever write poetry?\"\n\n\"Never.\"\n\n\"What do you call the song Phebe sang with her bird chorus?\"\n\n\"That was nothing till she put the music to it. But she promised not to\ntell.\"\n\n\"She didn't. I suspected, and now I know,\" laughed Rose, delighted to\nhave caught him.\n\nMuch discomfited, Mac gave poor Keats a fling and, leaning on both\nelbows, tried to hide his face for it had reddened like that of a modest\ngirl when teased about her lover.\n\n\"You needn't look so guilty; it is no sin to write poetry,\" said Rose,\namused at his confession.\n\n\"It's a sin to call that rubbish poetry,\" muttered Mac with great scorn.\n\n\"It is a greater sin to tell a fib and say you never write it.\"\n\n\"Reading so much sets one thinking about such things, and every fellow\nscribbles a little jingle when he is lazy or in love, you know,\"\nexplained Mac, looking very guilty.\n\nRose could not quite understand the change she saw in him till his last\nwords suggested a cause which she knew by experience was apt to inspire\nyoung men. Leaning forward again, she asked solemnly, though her eyes\ndanced with fun, \"Mac, are you in love?\"\n\n\"Do I look like it?\" And he sat up with such an injured and indignant\nface that she apologized at once, for he certainly did not look\nloverlike with hayseed in his hair, several lively crickets playing\nleapfrog over his back, and a pair of long legs stretching from tree to\nhaycock.\n\n\"No, you don't, and I humbly beg your pardon for making such an\nunwarrantable insinuation. It merely occurred to me that the general\nupliftedness I observe in you might be owing to that, since it wasn't\npoetry.\"\n\n\"It is the good company I've been keeping, if anything. A fellow can't\nspend 'A Week' with Thoreau and not be the better for it. I'm glad I\nshow it, because in the scramble life is to most of us, even an hour\nwith such a sane, simple, and sagacious soul as his must help one,\"\nsaid Mac, taking a much worn book out of his pocket with the air of\nintroducing a dear and honored friend.\n\n\"I've read bits, and like them they are so original and fresh and\nsometimes droll,\" said Rose, smiling to see what natural and appropriate\nmarks of approbation the elements seemed to set upon the pages Mac was\nturning eagerly, for one had evidently been rained on, a crushed berry\nstained another, some appreciative field-mouse or squirrel had nibbled\none corner, and the cover was faded with the sunshine, which seemed to\nhave filtered through to the thoughts within.\n\n\"Here's a characteristic bit for you: 'I would rather sit on a pumpkin,\nand have it all to myself, than be crowded on a velvet cushion. I would\nrather ride on earth in an oxcart, with free circulation, than go to\nheaven in the fancy car of an excursion train, and breathe malaria all\nthe way.'\n\n\"I've tried both and quite agree with him,\" laughed Mac, and skimming\ndown another page, gave her a paragraph here and there.\n\n\"'Read the best books first, or you may not have a chance to read them\nat all.'\n\n\"'We do not learn much from learned books, but from sincere human books:\nfrank, honest biographies.'\n\n\"'At least let us have healthy books. Let the poet be as vigorous as the\nsugar maple, with sap enough to maintain his own verdure, besides\nwhat runs into the trough; and not like a vine which, being cut in the\nspring, bears no fruit, but bleeds to death in the endeavor to heal its\nwounds.'\"\n\n\"That will do for you,\" said Rose, still thinking of the new suspicion\nwhich pleased her by its very improbability.\n\nMac flashed a quick look at her and shut the book, saying quietly,\nalthough his eyes shone, and a conscious smile lurked about his mouth:\n\"We shall see, and no one need meddle, for, as my Thoreau says,\n\n    \"Whate'er we leave to God, God does\n    And blesses us: The work we choose should be our own\n    God lets alone.\"\n\nRose sat silent, as if conscious that she deserved his poetical reproof.\n\n\"Come, you have catechized me pretty well; now I'll take my turn and ask\nyou why you look 'uplifted,' as you call it. What have you been doing\nto make yourself more like your namesake than ever?\" asked Mac, carrying\nwar into the enemy's camp with the sudden question.\n\n\"Nothing but live, and enjoy doing it. I actually sit here, day after\nday, as happy and contented with little things as Dulce is and feel as\nif I wasn't much older than she,\" answered the girl, feeling as if\nsome change was going on in that pleasant sort of pause but unable to\ndescribe it.\n\n\"As if a rose should shut and be a bud again,\" murmured Mac, borrowing\nfrom his beloved Keats.\n\n\"Ah, but I can't do that! I must go on blooming whether I like it or\nnot, and the only trouble I have is to know what leaf I ought to unfold\nnext,\" said Rose, playfully smoothing out the white gown, in which she\nlooked very like a daisy among the green.\n\n\"How far have you got?\" asked Mac, continuing his catechism as if the\nfancy suited him.\n\n\"Let me see. Since I came home last year, I've been gay, then sad,\nthen busy, and now I am simply happy. I don't know why, but seem to\nbe waiting for what is to come next and getting ready for it, perhaps\nunconsciously,\" she said, looking dreamily away to the hills again, is\nif the new experience was coming to her from afar.\n\nMac watched her thoughtfully for a minute, wondering how many more\nleaves must unfold before the golden heart of this human flower would\nlie open to the sun. He felt a curious desire to help in some way, and\ncould think of none better than to offer her what he had found most\nhelpful to himself. Picking up another book, he opened it at a place\nwhere an oak leaf lay and, handing it to her, said, as if presenting\nsomething very excellent and precious: \"If you want to be ready to take\nwhatever comes in a brave and noble way, read that, and the one where\nthe page is turned down.\"\n\nRose took it, saw the words \"Self-Reliance,\" and turning the leaves,\nread here and there a passage which was marked: \"'My life is for itself,\nand not for a spectacle.'\n\n\"'Insist on yourself: never imitate. That which each can do best, none\nbut his Maker can teach him.'\n\n\"'Do that which is assigned to you, and you cannot hope or dare too\nmuch.'\"\n\nThen, coming to the folded page, whose title was \"Heroism,\" she read,\nand brightened as she read:\n\n\"'Let the maiden, with erect soul, walk serenely on her way; accept the\nhint of each new experience; search in turn all the objects that solicit\nher eye, that she may learn the power and the charm of her newborn\nbeing.'\n\n\"'The fair girl who repels interference by a decided and proud choice of\ninfluences inspires every beholder with something of her own nobleness;\nand the silent heart encourages her. O friend, never strike sail to a\nfear! Come into port greatly, or sail with God the seas.'\"\n\n\"You understand that, don't you?\" asked Mac as she glanced up with the\nlook of one who had found something suited to her taste and need.\n\n\"Yes, but I never dared to read these Essays, because I thought they\nwere too wise for me.\"\n\n\"The wisest things are sometimes the simplest, I think. Everyone\nwelcomes light and air, and cannot do without them, yet very few could\nexplain them truly. I don't ask you to read or understand all of that\ndon't myself but I do recommend the two essays I've marked, as well as\n'Love' and 'Friendship.' Try them, and let me know how they suit. I'll\nleave you the book.\"\n\n\"Thanks. I wanted something fine to read up here and, judging by what I\nsee, I fancy this will suit. Only Aunt Jessie may think I'm putting on\nairs if I try Emerson.\"\n\n\"Why should she? He has done more to set young men and women thinking\nthan any man in this century at least. Don't you be afraid if it is what\nyou want, take it, and go ahead as he tells you\n\n    \"Without halting, without rest,\n    Lifting Better up to Best.\"\n\n\"I'll try,\" said Rose meekly, feeling that Mac had been going ahead\nhimself much faster than she had any suspicion.\n\nHere a voice exclaimed \"Hallo!\" and, looking around, Jamie was\ndiscovered surveying them critically as he stood in an independent\nattitude, like a small Colossus of Rhodes in brown linen, with a bundle\nof molasses candy in one hand, several new fishhooks cherished carefully\nin the other, and his hat well on the back of his head, displaying as\nmany freckles as one somewhat limited nose could reasonably accommodate.\n\n\"How are you, young one?\" said Mac, nodding.\n\n\"Tip-top. Glad it's you. Thought Archie might have turned up again, and\nhe's no fun. Where did you come from? What did you come for? How long\nare you going to stay? Want a bit? It's jolly good.\"\n\nWith which varied remarks Jamie approached, shook hands in a manly way,\nand, sitting down beside his long cousin, hospitably offered sticks of\ncandy all around.\n\n\"Did you get any letters?\" asked Rose, declining the sticky treat.\n\n\"Lots, but Mama forgot to give 'em to me, and I was rather in a hurry,\nfor Mrs. Atkinson said somebody had come and I couldn't wait,\" explained\nJamie, reposing luxuriously with his head on Mac's legs and his mouth\nfull.\n\n\"I'll step and get them. Aunty must be tired, and we should enjoy\nreading the news together.\"\n\n\"She is the most convenient girl that ever was,\" observed Jamie as Rose\ndeparted, thinking Mac might like some more substantial refreshment than\nsweetmeats.\n\n\"I should think so, if you let her run your errands, you lazy little\nscamp,\" answered Mac, looking after her as she went up the green slope,\nfor there was something very attractive to him about the slender figure\nin a plain white gown with a black sash about the waist and all the wavy\nhair gathered to the top of the head with a little black bow.\n\n\"Sort of pre-Raphaelite, and quite refreshing after the furbelowed\ncreatures at the hotels,\" he said to himself as she vanished under the\narch of scarlet runners over the garden gate.\n\n\"Oh, well! She likes it. Rose is fond of me, and I'm very good to her\nwhen I have time,\" continued Jamie, calmly explaining. \"I let her cut\nout a fishhook, when it caught in my leg, with a sharp penknife, and\nyou'd better believe it hurt, but I never squirmed a bit, and she said I\nwas a brave boy. And then, one day I got left on my desert island out in\nthe pond, you know the boat floated off, and there I was for as much\nas an hour before I could make anyone hear. But Rose thought I might be\nthere, and down she came, and told me to swim ashore. It wasn't far, but\nthe water was horrid cold, and I didn't like it. I started though, just\nas she said, and got on all right, till about halfway, then cramp or\nsomething made me shut up and howl, and she came after me slapdash, and\npulled me ashore. Yes, sir, as wet as a turtle, and looked so funny, I\nlaughed, and that cured the cramp. Wasn't I good to mind when she said,\n'Come on'?\"\n\n\"She was, to dive after such a scapegrace. I guess you lead her a life\nof it, and I'd better take you home with me in the morning,\" suggested\nMac, rolling the boy over and giving him a good-natured pummeling on the\nhaycock while Dulce applauded from her nest.\n\nWhen Rose returned with ice-cold milk, gingerbread, and letters, she\nfound the reader of Emerson up in the tree, pelting and being pelted\nwith green apples as Jamie vainly endeavored to get at him. The siege\nended when Aunt Jessie appeared, and the rest of the afternoon was spent\nin chat about home affairs.\n\nEarly the next morning Mac was off, and Rose went as far as the old\nchurch with him.\n\n\"Shall you walk all the way?\" she asked as he strode along beside her in\nthe dewy freshness of the young day.\n\n\"Only about twenty miles, then take car and whisk back to my work,\" he\nanswered, breaking a delicate fern for her.\n\n\"Are you never lonely?\"\n\n\"Never. I take my best friends along, you know,\" and he gave a slap to\nthe pocket from which peeped the volume of Thoreau.\n\n\"I'm afraid you leave your very best behind you,\" said Rose, alluding to\nthe book he had lent her yesterday.\n\n\"I'm glad to share it with you. I have much of it here, and a little\ngoes a great way, as you will soon discover,\" he answered, tapping his\nhead.\n\n\"I hope the reading will do as much for me as it seems to have done for\nyou. I'm happy, but you are wise and good I want to be also.\"\n\n\"Read away, and digest it well, then write and tell me what you think of\nit. Will you?\" he asked as they paused where the four roads met.\n\n\"If you will answer. Shall you have time with all your other work?\nPoetry I beg pardon medicine is very absorbing, you know,\" answered Rose\nmischievously, for just then, as he stood bareheaded in the shadows of\nthe leaves playing over his fine forehead, she remembered the chat among\nthe haycocks, and he did not look at all like an M.D.\n\n\"I'll make time.\"\n\n\"Good-bye, Milton.\"\n\n\"Good-bye, Sabrina.\"\n\n\n\n\nChapter 18 WHICH WAS IT?\n\nRose did read and digest, and found her days much richer for the\ngood company she kept, for an introduction to so much that was wise,\nbeautiful, and true could not but make that month a memorable one. It\nis not strange that while the young man most admired \"Heroism\" and\n\"Self-Reliance,\" the girl preferred \"Love\" and \"Friendship,\" reading\nthem over and over like prose poems, as they are, to the fitting\naccompaniment of sunshine, solitude, and sympathy, for letters went to\nand fro with praiseworthy regularity.\n\nRose much enjoyed this correspondence, and found herself regretting that\nit was at an end when she went home in September, for Mac wrote better\nthan he talked, though he could do that remarkably well when he chose.\nBut she had no chance to express either pleasure or regret, for\nthe first time she saw him after her return the great change in his\nappearance made her forget everything else. Some whim had seized him to\nbe shaven and shorn, and when he presented himself to welcome Rose, she\nhardly knew him. The shaggy hair was nicely trimmed and brushed, the\ncherished brown beard entirely gone, showing a well-cut mouth and\nhandsome chin and giving a new expression to the whole face.\n\n\"Are you trying to look like Keats?\" she asked, after a critical glance,\nwhich left her undecided whether the change was an improvement or not.\n\n\"I am trying not to look like Uncle,\" answered Mac coolly.\n\n\"And why, if you please?\" demanded Rose in great surprise.\n\n\"Because I prefer to look like myself, and not resemble any other man,\nno matter how good or great he may be.\"\n\n\"You haven't succeeded then, for you look now very much like the young\nAugustus,\" returned Rose, rather pleased on the whole to see what a\nfinely shaped head appeared after the rough thatch was off.\n\n\"Trust a woman to find a comparison for everything under the sun!\"\nlaughed Mac, not at all flattered by the one just made. \"What do you\nthink of me, on the whole?\" he asked a minute later, as he found Rose\nstill scrutinizing him with a meditative air.\n\n\"Haven't made up my mind. It is such an entire change, I don't know you,\nand feel as if I ought to be introduced. You certainly look much more\ntidy, and I fancy I shall like it when I'm used to seeing a somewhat\ndistinguished-looking man about the house instead of my old friend\nOrson,\" answered Rose, with her head on one side to get a profile view.\n\n\"Don't tell Uncle why I did it, please he thinks it was for the sake of\ncoolness and likes it, so take no notice. They are all used to me now,\nand don't mind,\" said Mac, roving about the room as if rather ashamed of\nhis whim after all.\n\n\"No, I won't, but you mustn't mind if I'm not as sociable as usual for\na while. I never can be with strangers, and you really do seem like\none. That will be a punishment for your want of taste and love of\noriginality,\" returned Rose, resolved to punish him for the slight put\nupon her beloved uncle.\n\n\"As you like. I won't trouble you much anyway, for I'm going to be\nvery busy. May go to L this winter, if Uncle thinks best, and then my\n'originality' can't annoy you.\"\n\n\"I hope you won't go. Why, Mac, I'm just getting to know and enjoy\nyou, and thought we'd have a nice time this winter reading something\ntogether. Must you go?\" And Rose seemed to forget his strangeness, as\nshe held him still by one button while she talked.\n\n\"That would be nice. But I feel as if I must go my plans are all made,\nand I've set my heart on it,\" answered Mac, looking so eager that Rose\nreleased him, saying sadly: \"I suppose it is natural for you all to get\nrestless and push off, but it is hard for me to let you go one after the\nother and stay here alone. Charlie is gone, Archie and Steve are wrapped\nup in their sweethearts, the boys away, and only Jamie left to 'play\nwith Rose.'?\n\n\"But I'll come back, and you'll be glad I went if I bring you my--\"\nbegan Mac with sudden animation, then stopped abruptly to bite his lips,\nas if he had nearly said too much.\n\n\"Your what?\" asked Rose curiously, for he neither looked nor acted like\nhimself.\n\n\"I forgot how long it takes to get a diploma,\" he said, walking away\nagain.\n\n\"There will be one comfort if you go you'll see Phebe and can tell me\nall about her, for she is so modest, she doesn't half do it. I shall\nwant to know how she gets on, if she is engaged to sing ballads in the\nconcerts they talk of for next winter. You will write, won't you?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes! No doubt of that,\" and Mac laughed low to himself as he\nstooped to look at the little Psyche on the mantelpiece. \"What a pretty\nthing it is!\" he added soberly as he took it up.\n\n\"Be careful. Uncle gave it to me last New Year, and I'm very fond of it.\nShe is just lifting her lamp to see what Cupid is like, for she hasn't\nseen him yet,\" said Rose, busy putting her worktable in order.\n\n\"You ought to have a Cupid for her to look at. She has been waiting\npatiently a whole year, with nothing but a bronze lizard in sight,\" said\nMac with the half-shy, half-daring look which was so new and puzzling.\n\n\"Cupid fled away as soon as she woke him, you know, and she had a bad\ntime of it. She must wait longer till she can find and keep him.\"\n\n\"Do you know she looks like you? Hair tied up in a knot, and a spiritual\nsort of face. Don't you see it?\" asked Mac, turning the graceful little\nfigure toward her.\n\n\"Not a bit of it. I wonder whom I shall resemble next! I've been\ncompared to a Fra Angelico angel, Saint Agnes, and now 'Syke,' as\nAnnabel once called her.\"\n\n\"You'd see what I mean, if you'd ever watched your own face when you\nwere listening to music, talking earnestly, or much moved, then your\nsoul gets into your eyes and you are like Psyche.\"\n\n\"Tell me the next time you see me in a 'soulful' state, and I'll look in\nthe glass, for I'd like to see if it is becoming,\" said Rose merrily as\nshe sorted her gay worsteds.\n\n    \"Your feet in the full-grown grasses,\n    Moved soft as a soft wind blows;\n    You passed me as April passes,\n    With a face made out of a rose,\"\n\nmurmured Mac under his breath, thinking of the white figure going up\na green slope one summer day; then, as if chiding himself for\nsentimentality, he set Psyche down with great care and began to talk\nabout a course of solid reading for the winter.\n\nAfter that, Rose saw very little of him for several weeks, as he seemed\nto be making up for lost time and was more odd and absent than ever when\nhe did appear.\n\nAs she became accustomed to the change in his external appearance,\nshe discovered that he was altering fast in other ways and watched the\n\"distinguished-looking gentleman\" with much interest, saying to herself,\nwhen she saw a new sort of dignity about him alternating with an unusual\nrestlessness of manner, and now and then a touch of sentiment, \"Genius\nis simmering, just as I predicted.\"\n\nAs the family were in mourning, there were no festivities on Rose's\ntwenty-first birthday, though the boys had planned all sorts of\nrejoicings. Everyone felt particularly tender toward their girl on that\nday, remembering how \"poor Charlie\" had loved her, and they tried\nto show it in the gifts and good wishes they sent her. She found her\nsanctum all aglow with autumn leaves, and on her table so many rare and\npretty things, she quite forgot she was an heiress and only felt how\nrich she was in loving friends.\n\nOne gift greatly pleased her, though she could not help smiling at the\nsource from whence it came, for Mac sent her a Cupid not the chubby\nchild with a face of naughty merriment, but a slender, winged youth\nleaning on his unstrung bow, with a broken arrow at his feet. A poem,\n\"To Psyche,\" came with it, and Rose was much surprised at the beauty of\nthe lines, for, instead of being witty, complimentary, or gay, there was\nsomething nobler than mere sentiment in them, and the sweet old fable\nlived again in language which fitly painted the maiden Soul looking for\na Love worthy to possess it.\n\nRose read them over and over as she sat among the gold and scarlet\nleaves which glorified her little room, and each time found new depth\nand beauty in them, looking from the words that made music in her ear to\nthe lovely shapes that spoke with their mute grace to her eye. The whole\nthing suited her exactly, it was so delicate and perfect in its way,\nfor she was tired of costly gifts and valued very much this proof of\nher cousin's taste and talent, seeing nothing in it but an affectionate\ndesire to please her.\n\nAll the rest dropped in at intervals through the day to say a loving\nword, and last of all came Mac. Rose happened to be alone with Dulce,\nenjoying a splendid sunset from her western window, for October gave her\nchild a beautiful good night.\n\nRose turned around as he entered and, putting down the little girl,\nwent to him with the evening red shining on her happy face as she said\ngratefully: \"Dear Mac, it was so lovely! I don't know how to thank you\nfor it in any way but this.\" And, drawing down his tall head, she gave\nhim the birthday kiss she had given all the others.\n\nBut this time it produced a singular effect, for Mac turned scarlet,\nthen grew pale, and when Rose added playfully, thinking to relieve the\nshyness of so young a poet, \"Never again say you don't write poetry, or\ncall your verses rubbish I knew you were a genius, and now I'm sure of\nit,\" he broke out, as if against his will: \"No. It isn't genius, it is\nlove!\" Then, as she shrank a little, startled at his energy, he added,\nwith an effort at self-control which made his voice sound strange: \"I\ndidn't mean to speak, but I can't suffer you to deceive yourself so. I\nmust tell the truth, and not let you kiss me like a cousin when I love\nyou with all my heart and soul!\"\n\n\"Oh, Mac, don't joke!\" cried Rose, bewildered by this sudden glimpse\ninto a heart she thought she knew so well.\n\n\"I'm in solemn earnest,\" he answered steadily, in such a quiet tone\nthat, but for the pale excitement of his face, she might have doubted\nhis words. \"Be angry, if you will. I expect it, for I know it is too\nsoon to speak. I ought to wait for years, perhaps, but you seemed so\nhappy I dared to hope you had forgotten.\"\n\n\"Forgotten what?\" asked Rose sharply.\n\n\"Charlie.\"\n\n\"Ah! You all will insist on believing that I loved him better than I\ndid!\" she cried, with both pain and impatience in her voice, for the\nfamily delusion tried her very much at times.\n\n\"How could we help it, when he was everything women most admire?\" said\nMac, not bitterly, but as if he sometimes wondered at their want of\ninsight.\n\n\"I do not admire weakness of any sort I could never love without either\nconfidence or respect. Do me the justice to believe that, for I'm tired\nof being pitied.\"\n\nShe spoke almost passionately, being more excited by Mac's repressed\nemotion than she had ever been by Charlie's most touching demonstration,\nthough she did not know why.\n\n\"But he loved you so!\" began Mac, feeling as if a barrier had suddenly\ngone down but not daring to venture in as yet.\n\n\"That was the hard part of it! That was why I tried to love him, why\nI hoped he would stand fast for my sake, if not for his own, and why I\nfound it so sad sometimes not to be able to help despising him for his\nwant of courage. I don't know how others feel, but, to me, love isn't\nall. I must look up, not down, trust and honor with my whole heart, and\nfind strength and integrity to lean on. I have had it so far, and I know\nI could not live without it.\"\n\n\"Your ideal is a high one. Do you hope to find it, Rose?\" Mac asked,\nfeeling, with the humility of a genuine love, that he could not give her\nall she desired.\n\n\"Yes,\" she answered, with a face full of the beautiful confidence in\nvirtue, the instinctive desire for the best which so many of us lose too\nsoon, to find again after life's great lessons are well learned. \"I\ndo hope to find it, because I try not to be unreasonable and expect\nperfection. Smile if you will, but I won't give up my hero yet,\" and she\ntried to speak lightly, hoping to lead him away from a more dangerous\ntopic.\n\n\"You'll have to look a long while, I'm afraid,\" and all the glow was\ngone out of Mac's face, for he understood her wish and knew his answer\nhad been given.\n\n\"I have Uncle to help me, and I think my ideal grew out of my knowledge\nof him. How can I fail to believe in goodness, when he shows me what it\ncan be and do?\"\n\n\"It's no use for me to say any more, for I have very little to offer. I\ndid not mean to say a word till I earned a right to hope for something\nin return. I cannot take it back, but I can wish you success, and I do,\nbecause you deserve the very best.\" And Mac moved as if he was going\naway without more words, accepting the inevitable as manfully as he\ncould.\n\n\"Thank you that makes me feel very ungrateful and unkind. I wish I could\nanswer you as you want me to for, indeed, dear Mac, I'm very fond of\nyou in my own way,\" and Rose looked up with such tender pity and frank\naffection in her face, it was no wonder the poor fellow caught at a ray\nof hope and, brightening suddenly, said in his own odd way: \"Couldn't\nyou take me on trial while you are waiting for a true hero? It may be\nyears before you find him; meantime, you could be practicing on me in\nways that would be useful when you get him.\"\n\n\"Oh, Mac! What shall I do with you?\" exclaimed Rose, so curiously\naffected by this very characteristic wooing that she did not know\nwhether to laugh or cry, for he was looking at her with his heart in his\neyes, though his proposition was the queerest ever made at such a time.\n\n\"Just go on being fond of me in your own way, and let me love you as\nmuch as I like in mine. I'll try to be satisfied with that.\" And he took\nboth her hands so beseechingly that she felt more ungrateful than ever.\n\n\"No, it would not be fair, for you would love the most and, if the hero\ndid appear, what would become of you?\"\n\n\"I should resemble Uncle Alec in one thing at least fidelity, for my\nfirst love would be my last.\"\n\nThat went straight to Rose's heart, and for a minute she stood silent,\nlooking down at the two strong hands that held hers so firmly yet\nso gently, and the thought went through her mind, \"Must he, too, be\nsolitary all his life? I have no dear lover as my mother had, why cannot\nI make him happy and forget myself?\"\n\nIt did not seem very hard, and she owned that, even while she told\nherself that compassion was no equivalent for love. She wanted to give\nall she could, and keep as much of Mac's affection as she honestly\nmight, because it seemed to grow more sweet and precious when she\nthought of putting it away.\n\n\"You will be like Uncle in happier ways than that, I hope, for you, too,\nmust have a high ideal and find her and be happy,\" she said, resolving\nto be true to the voice of conscience, not be swayed by the impulse of\nthe moment.\n\n\"I have found her, but I don't see any prospect of happiness, do you?\"\nhe asked wistfully.\n\n\"Dear Mac, I cannot give you the love you want, but I do trust and\nrespect you from the bottom of my heart, if that is any comfort,\" began\nRose, looking up with eyes full of contrition for the pain her reply\nmust give.\n\nShe got no further, however, for those last words wrought a marvelous\nchange in Mac. Dropping her hands, he stood erect, as if inspired with\nsudden energy and hope, while over his face there came a brave, bright\nlook, which for the moment made him a nobler and comelier man than\never handsome Prince had been. \"It is a comfort!\" he said, in a tone\nof gratitude that touched her very much. \"You said your love must be\nfounded on respect, and that you have given me why can I not earn the\nrest? I'm nothing now, but everything is possible when one loves with\nall his heart and soul and strength. Rose, I will be your hero if a\nmortal man can, even though I have to work and wait for years. I'll make\nyou love me, and be glad to do it. Don't be frightened. I've not lost my\nwits I've just found them. I don't ask anything I'll never speak of my\nhope, but it is no use to stop me. I must try it, and I will succeed!\"\n\nWith the last words, uttered in a ringing voice while his face glowed,\nhis eyes shone, and he looked as if carried out of himself by the\npassion that possessed him, Mac abruptly left the room, like one eager\nto change words to deeds and begin his task at once.\n\nRose was so amazed by all this that she sat down trembling a little, not\nwith fear or anger, but a feeling half pleasure, half pain, and a sense\nof some new power subtle, strong, and sweet that had come into her life.\nIt seemed as if another Mac had taken the place of the one she had\nknown so long an ardent, ambitious man, ready for any work now that the\nmagical moment had come when everything seems possible to love. If hope\ncould work such a marvelous change for a moment, could not happiness\ndo it for a lifetime? It would be an exciting experiment to try, she\nthought, remembering the sudden illumination which made that familiar\nface both beautiful and strange.\n\nShe could not help wondering how long this unsuspected sentiment\nhad been growing in his heart and felt perplexed by its peculiar\ndemonstration, for she had never had a lover like this before. It\ntouched and flattered her, nevertheless and she could not but feel\nhonored by a love so genuine and generous, for it seemed to make a\nman of Mac all at once, and a manly man, too, who was not daunted by\ndisappointment but could \"hope against hope\" and resolve to make her\nlove him if it took years to do it.\n\nThere was the charm of novelty about this sort of wooing, and she tried\nto guess how he would set about it, felt curious to see how he would\nbehave when next they met, and was half angry with herself for not being\nable to decide how she ought to act. The more she thought, the more\nbewildered she grew, for having made up her mind that Mac was a genius,\nit disturbed all her plans to find him a lover, and such an ardent one.\nAs it was impossible to predict what would come next, she gave up trying\nto prepare for it and, tired with vain speculations, carried Dulce off\nto bed, wishing she could tuck away her love troubles as quietly and\ncomfortably as she did her sleepy little charge.\n\nSimple and sincere in all things, Mac gave Rose a new surprise by\nkeeping his promise to the letter asked nothing of her, said nothing\nof his hope, and went on as if nothing had happened, quite in the old\nfriendly way. No, not quite, for now and then, when she least expected\nit, she saw again the indescribable expression on his face, a look\nthat seemed to shed a sudden sunshine over her, making her eyes fall\ninvoluntarily, her color rise, and her heart beat quicker for a moment.\nNot a word did he say, but she felt that a new atmosphere surrounded\nher when he was by, and although he used none of the little devices most\nlovers employ to keep the flame alight, it was impossible to forget that\nunderneath his quietude there was a hidden world of fire and force ready\nto appear at a touch, a word from her.\n\nThis was rather dangerous knowledge for Rose, and she soon began to feel\nthat there were more subtle temptations than she had expected, for it\nwas impossible to be unconscious of her power, or always to resist the\ntrials of it which daily came unsought. She had never felt this desire\nbefore, for Charlie was the only one who had touched her heart, and he\nwas constantly asking as well as giving, and wearied her by demanding\ntoo much or oppressed her by offering more than she could accept.\n\nMac did neither; he only loved her, silently, patiently, hopefully, and\nthis generous sort of fidelity was very eloquent to a nature like hers.\nShe could not refuse or chide, since nothing was asked or urged; there\nwas no need of coldness, for he never presumed; no call for pity, since\nhe never complained. All that could be done was to try and be as just\nand true as he was, and to wait as trustfully for the end, whatever it\nwas to be.\n\nFor a time she liked the new interest it put into her life, yet did\nnothing to encourage it and thought that if she gave this love no food\nit would soon starve to death. But it seemed to thrive on air, and\npresently she began to feel as if a very strong will was slowly but\nsteadily influencing her in many ways. If Mac had never told her that he\nmeant to \"make her love him,\" she might have yielded unconsciously, but\nnow she mistook the impulse to obey this undercurrent for compassion and\nresisted stoutly, not comprehending yet the reason for the unrest which\ntook possession of her about this time.\n\nShe had as many moods as an April day, and would have much surprised Dr.\nAlec by her vagaries had he known them all. He saw enough, however, to\nguess what was the matter, but took no notice, for he knew this fever\nmust run its course, and much medicine only does harm. The others were\nbusy about their own affairs, and Aunt Plenty was too much absorbed in\nher rheumatism to think of love, for the cold weather set in early, and\nthe poor lady kept her room for days at a time with Rose as nurse.\n\nMac had spoken of going away in November, and Rose began to hope he\nwould, for she decided that this silent sort of adoration was bad for\nher, as it prevented her from steadily pursuing the employments she\nhad marked out for that year. What was the use of trying to read useful\nbooks when her thoughts continually wandered to those charming essays on\n\"Love\" and \"Friendship\"? To copy antique casts, when all the masculine\nheads looked like Cupid and the feminine ones like the Psyche on her\nmantelpiece? To practice the best music if it ended in singing over and\nover the pretty spring song without Phebe's bird chorus? Dulce's company\nwas pleasantest now, for Dulce seldom talked, so much meditation was\npossible. Even Aunt Plenty's red flannel, camphor, and Pond's Extract\nwere preferable to general society, and long solitary rides on Rosa\nseemed the only thing to put her in tune after one of her attempts to\nfind out what she ought to do or leave undone.\n\nShe made up her mind at last, and arming herself with an unmade pen,\nlike Fanny Squeers, she boldly went into the study to confer with Dr.\nAlec at an hour when Mac was usually absent. \"I want a pen for marking\ncan you make me one, Uncle?\" she asked, popping her head in to be sure\nhe was alone.\n\n\"Yes, my dear,\" answered a voice so like the doctor's that she entered\nwithout delay.\n\nBut before she had taken three steps she stopped, looking rather\nannoyed, for the head that rose from behind the tall desk was not rough\nand gray, but brown and smooth, and Mac, not Uncle Alec, sat there\nwriting. Late experience had taught her that she had nothing to fear\nfrom a tete-a-tete and, having with difficulty taken a resolution, she\ndid not like to fail of carrying it out.\n\n\"Don't get up, I won't trouble you if you are busy, there is no hurry,\"\nshe said, not quite sure whether it were wiser to stay or run away.\n\nMac settled the point by taking the pen out of her hand and beginning to\ncut it, as quietly as Nicholas did on that \"thrilling\" occasion. Perhaps\nhe was thinking of that, for he smiled as he asked, \"Hard or soft?\"\n\nRose evidently had forgotten that the family of Squeers ever existed,\nfor she answered: \"Hard, please,\" in a voice to match. \"I'm glad to see\nyou doing that,\" she added, taking courage from his composure and going\nas straight to her point as could be expected of a woman.\n\n\"And I am very glad to do it.\"\n\n\"I don't mean making pens, but the romance I advised,\" and she touched\nthe closely written page before him, looking as if she would like to\nread it.\n\n\"That is my abstract on a lecture on the circulation of the blood,\"\nhe answered, kindly turning it so that she could see. \"I don't write\nromances I'm living one,\" and he glanced up with the happy, hopeful\nexpression which always made her feel as if he was heaping coals of fire\non her head.\n\n\"I wish you wouldn't look at me in that way it fidgets me,\" she said a\nlittle petulantly, for she had been out riding, and knew that she did\nnot present a \"spiritual\" appearance after the frosty air had reddened\nnose as well as cheeks.\n\n\"I'll try to remember. It does itself before I know it. Perhaps this may\nmend matters.\" And, taking out the blue glasses he sometimes wore in the\nwind, he gravely put them on.\n\nRose could not help laughing, but his obedience only aggravated her, for\nshe knew he could observe her all the better behind his ugly screen.\n\n\"No, it won't they are not becoming, and I don't want to look blue when\nI do not feel so,\" she said, finding it impossible to guess what he\nwould do next or to help enjoying his peculiarities.\n\n\"But you don't to me, for in spite of the goggles everything is\nrose-colored now.\" And he pocketed the glasses without a murmur at the\ncharming inconsistency of his idol.\n\n\"Really, Mac, I'm tired of this nonsense, it worries me and wastes your\ntime.\"\n\n\"Never worked harder. But does it really trouble you to know I love\nyou?\" he asked anxiously.\n\n\"Don't you see how cross it makes me?\" And she walked away, feeling that\nthings were not going as she intended to have them at all.\n\n\"I don't mind the thorns if I get the rose at last, and I still hope I\nmay, some ten years hence,\" said this persistent suitor, quite undaunted\nby the prospect of a \"long wait.\"\n\n\"I think it is rather hard to be loved whether I like it or not,\"\nobjected Rose, at a loss how to make any headway against such\nindomitable hopefulness.\n\n\"But you can't help it, nor can I so I must go on doing it with all my\nheart till you marry, and then well, then I'm afraid I may hate somebody\ninstead,\" and Mac spoilt the pen by an involuntary slash of his knife.\n\n\"Please don't, Mac!\"\n\n\"Do which, love or hate?\"\n\n\"Don't do either go and care for someone else; there are plenty of nice\ngirls who will be glad to make you happy,\" said Rose, intent upon ending\nher disquiet in some way.\n\n\"That is too easy. I enjoy working for my blessings, and the harder I\nhave to work, the more I value them when they come.\"\n\n\"Then if I suddenly grew very kind, would you stop caring about me?\"\nasked Rose, wondering if that treatment would free her from a passion\nwhich both touched and tormented her.\n\n\"Try and see.\" But there was a traitorous glimmer in Mac's eyes which\nplainly showed what a failure it would be.\n\n\"No, I'll get something to do, so absorbing I shall forget all about\nyou.\"\n\n\"Don't think about me if it troubles you,\" he said tenderly.\n\n\"I can't help it.\" Rose tried to catch back the words, but it was too\nlate, and she added hastily, \"That is, I cannot help wishing you would\nforget me. It is a great disappointment to find I was mistaken when I\nhoped such fine things of you.\"\n\n\"Yes, you were very sure that it was love when it was poetry, and now\nyou want poetry when I've nothing on hand but love. Will both together\nplease you?\"\n\n\"Try and see.\"\n\n\"I'll do my best. Anything else?\" he asked, forgetting the small task\nshe had given him in his eagerness to attempt the greater.\n\n\"Tell me one thing. I've often wanted to know, and now you speak of it\nI'll venture to ask. Did you care about me when you read Keats to me\nlast summer?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"When did you begin?\" asked Rose, smiling in spite of herself at his\nunflattering honesty.\n\n\"How can I tell? Perhaps it did begin up there, though, for that talk\nset us writing, and the letters showed me what a beautiful soul you had.\nI loved that first it was so quick to recognize good things, to use them\nwhen they came, and give them out again as unconsciously as a flower\ndoes its breath. I longed for you to come home, and wanted you to find\nme altered for the better in some way as I had found you. And when you\ncame it was very easy to see why I needed you to love you entirely, and\nto tell you so. That's all, Rose.\"\n\nA short story, but it was enough the voice that told it with such simple\ntruth made the few words so eloquent, Rose felt strongly tempted to add\nthe sequel Mac desired. But her eyes had fallen as he spoke, for she\nknew his were fixed upon her, dark and dilated, with the same repressed\nemotion that put such fervor into his quiet tones, and just as she was\nabout to look up, they fell on a shabby little footstool. Trifles affect\nwomen curiously, and often most irresistibly when some agitation sways\nthem. The sight of the old hassock vividly recalled Charlie, for he\nhad kicked it on the night she never liked to remember. Like a spark it\nfired a long train of recollections, and the thought went through her\nmind: \"I fancied I loved him, and let him see it, but I deceived myself,\nand he reproached me for a single look that said too much. This feeling\nis very different, but too new and sudden to be trusted. I'll neither\nlook nor speak till I am quite sure, for Mac's love is far deeper than\npoor Charlie's, and I must be very true.\"\n\nNot in words did the resolve shape itself, but in a quick impulse, which\nshe obeyed certain that it was right, since it was hard to yield to it.\nOnly an instant's silence followed Mac's answer as she stood looking\ndown with fingers intertwined and color varying in her cheeks. A foolish\nattitude, but Mac thought it a sweet picture of maiden hesitation and\nbegan to hope that a month's wooing was about to end in winning for a\nlifetime. He deceived himself, however, and cold water fell upon his\nflame, subduing but by no means quenching it, when Rose looked up with\nan air of determination which could not escape eyes that were growing\nwonderfully farsighted lately.\n\n\"I came in here to beg Uncle to advise you to go away soon. You are very\npatient and forbearing, and I feel it more than I can tell. But it\nis not good for you to depend on anyone so much for your happiness, I\nthink, and I know it is bad for me to feel that I have so much power\nover a fellow creature. Go away, Mac, and see if this isn't all a\nmistake. Don't let a fancy for me change or delay your work, because\nit may end as suddenly as it began, and then we should both reproach\nourselves and each other. Please do! I respect and care for you so much,\nI can't be happy to take all and give nothing. I try to, but I'm not\nsure I want to think it is too soon to know yet.\"\n\nRose began bravely, but ended in a fluttered sort of way as she moved\ntoward the door, for Mac's face though it fell at first, brightened\nas she went on, and at the last word, uttered almost involuntarily, he\nactually laughed low to himself, as if this order into exile pleased him\nmuch.\n\n\"Don't say that you give nothing, when you've just shown me that I'm\ngetting on. I'll go; I'll go at once, and see if absence won't help\nyou 'to think, to know, and to be sure' as it did me. I wish I could do\nsomething more for you. As I can't, good-bye.\"\n\n\"Are you going now?\" And Rose paused in her retreat to look back with a\nstartled face as he offered her a badly made pen and opened the door\nfor her just as Dr. Alec always did; for, in spite of himself, Mac did\nresemble the best of uncles.\n\n\"Not yet, but you seem to be.\"\n\nRose turned as red as a poppy, snatched the pen, and flew upstairs, to\ncall herself hard names as she industriously spoiled all Aunt Plenty's\nnew pocket handkerchiefs by marking them \"A.M.C.\"\n\nThree days later Mac said \"good-bye\" in earnest, and no one was\nsurprised that he left somewhat abruptly, such being his way, and a\ncourse of lectures by a famous physician the ostensible reason for a\ntrip to L----. Uncle Alec deserted most shamefully at the last moment\nby sending word that he would be at the station to see the traveler\noff, Aunt Plenty was still in her room, so when Mac came down from his\nfarewell to her, Rose met him in the hall, as if anxious not to delay\nhim. She was a little afraid of another tete-a-tete, as she fared so\nbadly at the last, and had assumed a calm and cousinly air which she\nflattered herself would plainly show on what terms she wished to part.\n\nMac apparently understood, and not only took the hint, but surpassed her\nin cheerful composure, for, merely saying \"Good-bye, Cousin; write\nwhen you feel like it,\" he shook hands and walked out of the house as\ntranquilly as if only a day instead of three months were to pass before\nthey met again. Rose felt as if a sudden shower bath had chilled her\nand was about to retire, saying to herself with disdainful decision:\n\"There's no love about it after all, only one of the eccentricities of\ngenius,\" when a rush of cold air made her turn to find herself in what\nappeared to be the embrace of an impetuous overcoat, which wrapped her\nclose for an instant, then vanished as suddenly as it had come, leaving\nher to hide in the sanctum and confide to Psyche with a tender sort of\ntriumph in her breathless voice: \"No, no, it isn't genius that must be\nlove!\"\n\n\n\n\nChapter 19 BEHIND THE FOUNTAIN\n\nTwo days after Christmas a young man of serious aspect might have been\nseen entering one of the large churches at L----. Being shown to a seat,\nhe joined in the services with praiseworthy devotion, especially the\nmusic, to which he listened with such evident pleasure that a gentleman\nwho sat nearby felt moved to address this appreciative stranger after\nchurch.\n\n\"Fine sermon today. Ever heard our minister before, sir?\" he began, as\nthey went down the aisle together among the last, for the young man had\nlingered as if admiring the ancient building.\n\n\"Very fine. No, sir, I have never had that pleasure. I've often wished\nto see this old place, and am not at all disappointed. Your choir,\ntoo, is unusually good,\" answered the stranger, glancing up at several\nbonnets bobbing about behind the half-drawn curtains above.\n\n\"Finest in the city, sir. We pride ourselves on our music, and always\nhave the best. People often come for that alone.\" And the old gentleman\nlooked as satisfied as if a choir of cherubim and seraphim \"continually\ndid cry\" in his organ loft.\n\n\"Who is the contralto? That solo was beautifully sung,\" observed the\nyounger man, pausing to read a tablet on the wall.\n\n\"That is Miss Moore. Been here about a year, and is universally\nadmired. Excellent young lady couldn't do without her. Sings superbly in\noratorios. Ever heard her?\"\n\n\"Never. She came from X, I believe?\n\n\"Yes, highly recommended. She was brought up by one of the first\nfamilies there. Campbell is the name. If you come from X, you doubtless\nknow them.\"\n\n\"I have met them. Good morning.\" And with bows the gentlemen parted, for\nat that instant the young man caught sight of a tall lady going down the\nchurch steps with a devout expression in her fine eyes and a prayer-book\nin her hand.\n\nHastening after her, the serious-minded young man accosted her just as\nshe turned into a quiet street.\n\n\"Phebe!\"\n\nOnly a word, but it wrought a marvelous change, for the devout\nexpression vanished in the drawing of a breath, and the quiet face\nblossomed suddenly with color, warmth, and \"the light that never was on\nsea or land\" as she turned to meet her lover with an answering word as\neloquent as his.\n\n\"Archie!\"\n\n\"The year is out today. I told you I should come. Have you forgotten?\"\n\n\"No I knew you'd come.\"\n\n\"And are you glad?\"\n\n\"How can I help it?\"\n\n\"You can't don't try. Come into this little park and let us talk.\" And\ndrawing her hand through his arm, Archie led her into what to other\neyes was a very dismal square, with a boarded-up fountain in the middle,\nsodden grass plots, and dead leaves dancing in the wintry wind.\n\nBut to them it was a summery Paradise, and they walked to and fro in the\npale sunshine, quite unconscious that they were objects of interest\nto several ladies and gentlemen waiting anxiously for their dinner or\nyawning over the dull books kept for Sunday reading. \"Are you ready\nto come home now, Phebe?\" asked Archie tenderly as he looked at the\ndowncast face beside him and wondered why all women did not wear\ndelightful little black velvet bonnets with one deep red flower against\ntheir hair.\n\n\"Not yet. I haven't done enough,\" began Phebe, finding it very hard to\nkeep the resolution made a year ago.\n\n\"You have proved that you can support yourself, make friends, and earn a\nname, if you choose. No one can deny that, and we are all getting proud\nof you. What more can you ask, my dearest?\"\n\n\"I don't quite know, but I am very ambitious. I want to be famous, to do\nsomething for you all, to make some sacrifice for Rose, and, if I can,\nto have something to give up for your sake. Let me wait and work longer\nI know I haven't earned my welcome yet,\" pleaded Phebe so earnestly\nthat her lover knew it would be in vain to try and turn her, so wisely\ncontented himself with half, since he could not have the whole.\n\n\"Such a proud woman! Yet I love you all the better for it, and\nunderstand your feeling. Rose made me see how it seems to you, and I\ndon't wonder that you cannot forget the unkind things that were looked,\nif not said, by some of my amiable aunts. I'll try to be patient on one\ncondition, Phebe.\"\n\n\"And what is that?\"\n\n\"You are to let me come sometimes while I wait, and wear this lest you\nshould forget me,\" he said, pulling a ring from his pocket and gently\ndrawing a warm, bare hand out of the muff where it lay hidden.\n\n\"Yes, Archie, but not here not now!\" cried Phebe, glancing about her as\nif suddenly aware that they were not alone.\n\n\"No one can see us here I thought of that. Give me one happy minute,\nafter this long, long year of waiting,\" answered Archie, pausing just\nwhere the fountain hid them from all eyes, for there were houses only on\none side.\n\nPhebe submitted and never did a plain gold ring slip more easily to its\nplace than the one he put on in such a hurry that cold December day.\nThen one hand went back into the muff red with the grasp he gave it, and\nthe other to its old place on his arm with a confiding gesture, as if it\nhad a right there.\n\n\"Now I feel sure of you,\" said Archie as they went on again, and no one\nthe wiser for that tender transaction behind the ugly pyramid of boards.\n\"Mac wrote me that you were much admired by your church people, and that\ncertain wealthy bachelors evidently had designs on the retiring Miss\nMoore. I was horribly jealous, but now I defy every man of them.\"\n\nPhebe smiled with the air of proud humility that was so becoming and\nanswered briefly: \"There was no danger kings could not change me,\nwhether you ever came or not. But Mac should not have told you.\"\n\n\"You shall be revenged on him, then, for, as he told secrets about you,\nI'll tell you one about him. Phebe, he loves Rose!\" And Archie looked as\nif he expected to make a great sensation with his news.\n\n\"I know it.\" And Phebe laughed at his sudden change of countenance as he\nadded inquiringly, \"She told you, then?\"\n\n\"Not a word. I guessed it from her letters, for lately she says nothing\nabout Mac, and before there was a good deal, so I suspected what the\nsilence meant and asked no questions.\"\n\n\"Wise girl! Then you think she does care for the dear old fellow?\"\n\n\"Of course she does. Didn't he tell you so?\"\n\n\"No, he only said when he went away, 'Take care of my Rose, and I'll\ntake care of your Phebe,' and not another thing could I get out of him,\nfor I did ask questions. He stood by me like a hero, and kept Aunt Jane\nfrom driving me stark mad with her 'advice.' I don't forget that, and\nburned to lend him a hand somewhere, but he begged me to let him manage\nhis wooing in his own way. And from what I see, I should say he knew how\nto do it,\" added Archie, finding it very delightful to gossip about love\naffairs with his sweetheart.\n\n\"Dear little mistress! How does she behave?\" asked Phebe, longing\nfor news, but too grateful to ask at headquarters, remembering how\ngenerously Rose had tried to help her, even by silence, the greatest\nsacrifice a woman can make at such interesting periods.\n\n\"Very sweet and shy and charming. I try not to watch but upon my word I\ncannot help it sometimes, she is so 'cunning,' as you girls say. When I\ncarry her a letter from Mac she tries so hard not to show how glad she\nis that I want to laugh and tell her I know all about it. But I look as\nsober as a judge and as stupid as an owl by daylight, and she enjoys her\nletters in peace and thinks I'm so absorbed in my own passion that I'm\nblind to hers.\"\n\n\"But why did Mac come away? He says lectures brought him, and he goes,\nbut I am sure something else is in his mind, he looks so happy at times.\nI don't see him very often, but when I do I'm conscious that he isn't\nthe Mac I left a year ago,\" said Phebe, leading Archie away, for\ninexorable propriety forbade a longer stay, even if prudence and duty\nhad not given her a reminding nudge, as it was very cold, and afternoon\nchurch came in an hour.\n\n\"Well, you see Mac was always peculiar, and he cannot even grow up like\nother fellows. I don't understand him yet, and am sure he's got some\nplan in his head that no one suspects, unless it is Uncle Alec. Love\nmakes us all cut queer capers, and I've an idea that the Don will\ndistinguish himself in some uncommon way. So be prepared to applaud\nwhatever it is. We owe him that, you know.\"\n\n\"Indeed we do! If Rose ever speaks of him to you, tell her I shall see\nthat he comes to no harm, and she must do the same for my Archie.\"\n\nThat unusual demonstration of tenderness from reserved Phebe very\nnaturally turned the conversation into a more personal channel, and\nArchie devoted himself to building castles in the air so successfully\nthat they passed the material mansion without either being aware of it.\n\n\"Will you come in?\" asked Phebe when the mistake was rectified and she\nstood on her own steps looking down at her escort, who had discreetly\nreleased her before a pull at the bell caused five heads to pop up at\nfive different windows.\n\n\"No, thanks. I shall be at church this afternoon, and the oratorio this\nevening. I must be off early in the morning, so let me make the most of\nprecious time and come home with you tonight as I did before,\" answered\nArchie, making his best bow, and quite sure of consent.\n\n\"You may.\" And Phebe vanished, closing the door softly, as if she found\nit hard to shut out so much love and happiness as that in the heart of\nthe sedate young gentleman who went briskly down the street humming a\nverse of old \"Clyde\" like a tuneful bass viol:\n\n    \"Oh, let our mingling voices rise\n    In grateful rapture to the skies,\n    Where love has had its birth.\n\n    Let songs of joy this day declare\n    That spirits come their bliss to share\n    With all the sons of earth.\"\n\nThat afternoon Miss Moore sang remarkably well, and that evening quite\nelectrified even her best friends by the skill and power with which she\nrendered \"Inflammatus\" in the oratorio.\n\n\"If that is not genius, I should like to know what it is?\" said one\nyoung man to another as they went out just before the general crush at\nthe end.\n\n\"Some genius and a great deal of love. They are a grand team, and,\nwhen well driven, astonish the world by the time they make in the great\nrace,\" answered the second young man with the look of one inclined to\ntry his hand at driving that immortal span.\n\n\"Daresay you are right. Can't stop now she's waiting for me. Don't sit\nup, Mac.\"\n\n\"The gods go with you, Archie.\"\n\nAnd the cousins separated one to write till midnight, the other to bid\nhis Phebe good-bye, little dreaming how unexpectedly and successfully\nshe was to earn her welcome home.\n\n\n\n\nChapter 20 WHAT MAC DID\n\nRose, meantime, was trying to find out what the sentiment was with\nwhich she regarded her cousin Mac. She could not seem to reconcile the\ncharacter she had known so long with the new one lately shown her, and\nthe idea of loving the droll, bookish, absentminded Mac of former times\nappeared quite impossible and absurd, but the new Mac, wide awake, full\nof talent, ardent and high-handed, was such a surprise to her, she felt\nas if her heart was being won by a stranger, and it became her to study\nhim well before yielding to a charm which she could not deny.\n\nAffection came naturally, and had always been strong for the boy; regard\nfor the studious youth easily deepened to respect for the integrity of\nthe young man, and now something warmer was growing up within her; but\nat first she could not decide whether it was admiration for the rapid\nunfolding of talent of some sort or love answering to love.\n\nAs if to settle that point, Mac sent her on New Year's Day a little book\nplainly bound and modestly entitled Songs and Sonnets. After reading\nthis with ever-growing surprise and delight, Rose never had another\ndoubt about the writer's being a poet, for though she was no critic, she\nhad read the best authors and knew what was good. Unpretentious as it\nwas, this had the true ring, and its very simplicity showed conscious\npower for, unlike so many first attempts, the book was not full of \"My\nLady,\" neither did it indulge in Swinburnian convulsions about\n\n    \"The lilies and languors of peace,\n    The roses and raptures of love.\";\n\nor contain any of the highly colored medieval word pictures so much\nin vogue. \"My book should smell of pines, and resound with the hum of\ninsects,\" might have been its motto, so sweet and wholesome was it with\na springlike sort of freshness which plainly betrayed that the author\nhad learned some of Nature's deepest secrets and possessed the skill to\ntell them in tuneful words. The songs went ringing through one's memory\nlong after they were read, and the sonnets were full of the subtle\nbeauty, insight, and half-unconscious wisdom, which seem to prove that\n\"genius is divine when young.\"\n\nMany faults it had, but was so full of promise that it was evident Mac\nhad not \"kept good company, read good books, loved good things, and\ncultivated soul and body as faithfully as he could\" in vain. It all\ntold now, for truth and virtue had blossomed into character and had a\nlanguage of their own more eloquent than the poetry to which they were\nwhat the fragrance is to the flower. Wiser critics than Rose felt and\nadmired this; less partial ones could not deny their praise to a first\neffort, which seemed as spontaneous and aspiring as a lark's song; and,\nwhen one or two of these Jupiters had given a nod of approval, Mac found\nhimself, not exactly famous, but much talked about. One set abused, the\nother set praised, and the little book was sadly mauled among them, for\nit was too original to be ignored, and too robust to be killed by hard\nusage, so it came out of the fray none the worse but rather brighter, if\nanything, for the friction which proved the gold genuine.\n\nThis took time, however, and Rose could only sit at home reading all the\nnotices she could get, as well as the literary gossip Phebe sent\nher, for Mac seldom wrote, and never a word about himself, so Phebe\nskillfully extracted from him in their occasional meetings all the\npersonal news her feminine wit could collect and faithfully reported it.\n\nIt was a little singular that without a word of inquiry on either side,\nthe letters of the girls were principally filled with tidings of their\nrespective lovers. Phebe wrote about Mac; Rose answered with minute\nparticulars about Archie; and both added hasty items concerning their\nown affairs, as if these were of little consequence.\n\nPhebe got the most satisfaction out of the correspondence, for soon\nafter the book appeared Rose began to want Mac home again and to be\nrather jealous of the new duties and delights that kept him. She was\nimmensely proud of her poet, and had little jubilees over the beautiful\nfulfillment of her prophecies, for even Aunt Plenty owned now with\ncontrition that \"the boy was not a fool.\" Every word of praise was\nread aloud on the housetops, so to speak, by happy Rose; every adverse\ncriticism was hotly disputed; and the whole family was in a great state\nof pleasant excitement over this unexpectedly successful first flight of\nthe Ugly Duckling, now generally considered by his relatives as the most\npromising young swan of the flock.\n\nAunt Jane was particularly funny in her new position of mother to a\ncallow poet and conducted herself like a proud but bewildered hen when\none of her brood takes to the water. She pored over the poems, trying\nto appreciate them but quite failing to do so, for life was all prose to\nher, and she vainly tried to discover where Mac got his talent from. It\nwas pretty to see the new respect with which she treated his possessions\nnow; the old books were dusted with a sort of reverence; scraps of paper\nwere laid carefully by lest some immortal verse be lost; and a certain\nshabby velvet jacket fondly smoothed when no one was by to smile at\nthe maternal pride with filled her heart and caused her once severe\ncountenance to shine with unwonted benignity.\n\nUncle Mac talked about \"my son\" with ill-concealed satisfaction, and\nevidently began to feel as if his boy was going to confer distinction\nupon the whole race of Campbell, which had already possessed one poet.\nSteve exulted with irrepressible delight and went about quoting Songs\nand Sonnets till he bored his friends dreadfully by his fraternal\nraptures.\n\nArchie took it more quietly, and even suggested that it was too soon to\ncrow yet, for the dear old fellow's first burst might be his last, since\nit was impossible to predict what he would do next. Having proved that\nhe could write poetry, he might drop it for some new world to conquer,\nquoting his favorite Thoreau, who, having made a perfect pencil, gave\nup the business and took to writing books with the sort of indelible ink\nwhich grows clearer with time.\n\nThe aunts of course had their \"views,\" and enjoyed much prophetic gossip\nas they wagged their caps over many social cups of tea. The younger boys\nthought it \"very jolly,\" and hoped the Don would \"go ahead and come\nto glory as soon as possible,\" which was all that could by expected of\n\"Young America,\" with whom poetry is not usually a passion.\n\nBut Dr. Alec was a sight for \"sair een,\" so full of concentrated\ncontentment was he. No one but Rose, perhaps, knew how proud and pleased\nthe good man felt at this first small success of his godson, for he had\nalways had high hopes of the boy, because in spite of his oddities he\nhad such an upright nature, and promising little, did much, with the\nquiet persistence which foretells a manly character. All the romance\nof the doctor's heart was stirred by this poetic bud of promise and\nthe love that made it bloom so early, for Mac had confided his hopes to\nUncle, finding great consolation and support in his sympathy and advice.\nLike a wise man, Dr. Alec left the young people to learn the great\nlesson in their own way, counseling Mac to work and Rose to wait till\nboth were quite certain that their love was built on a surer foundation\nthan admiration or youthful romance.\n\nMeantime he went about with a well-worn little book in his pocket,\nhumming bits from a new set of songs and repeating with great fervor\ncertain sonnets which seemed to him quite equal, if not superior, to\nany that Shakespeare ever wrote. As Rose was doing the same thing, they\noften met for a private \"read and warble,\" as they called it, and while\ndiscussing the safe subject of Mac's poetry, both arrived at a pretty\nclear idea of what Mac's reward was to be when he came home.\n\nHe seemed in no hurry to do this, however, and continued to astonish his\nfamily by going into society and coming out brilliantly in that line.\nIt takes very little to make a lion, as everyone knows who has seen what\npoor specimens are patted and petted every year, in spite of their bad\nmanners, foolish vagaries, and very feeble roaring. Mac did not want to\nbe lionized and took it rather scornfully, which only added to the charm\nthat people suddenly discovered about the nineteenth cousin of Thomas\nCampbell, the poet. He desired to be distinguished in the best sense\nof the word, as well as to look so, and thought a little of the polish\nsociety gives would not be amiss, remembering Rose's efforts in that\nline. For her sake he came out of his shell and went about seeing and\ntesting all sorts of people with those observing eyes of his, which saw\nso much in spite of their nearsightedness. What use he meant to make of\nthese new experiences no one knew, for he wrote short letters and,\nwhen questioned, answered with imperturbable patience: \"Wait till I get\nthrough; then I'll come home and talk about it.\"\n\nSo everyone waited for the poet, till something happened which\nproduced a greater sensation in the family than if all the boys had\nsimultaneously taken to rhyming.\n\nDr. Alec got very impatient and suddenly announced that he was going to\nL to see after those young people, for Phebe was rapidly singing herself\ninto public favor with the sweet old ballads which she rendered so\nbeautifully that hearers were touched as well as ears delighted, and her\nprospects brightened every month.\n\n\"Will you come with me, Rose, and surprise this ambitious pair who are\ngetting famous so fast they'll forget their homekeeping friends if we\ndon't remind them of us now and then?\" he said when he proposed the trip\none wild March morning.\n\n\"No, thank you, sir I'll stay with Aunty; that is all I'm fit for and\nI should only be in the way among those fine people,\" answered Rose,\nsnipping away at the plants blooming in the study window.\n\nThere was a slight bitterness in her voice and a cloud on her face,\nwhich her uncle heard and saw at once, half guessed the meaning of, and\ncould not rest till he had found out.\n\n\"Do you think Phebe and Mac would not care to see you?\" he asked,\nputting down a letter in which Mac gave a glowing account of a concert\nat which Phebe surpassed herself.\n\n\"No, but they must be very busy,\" began Rose, wishing she had held her\ntongue.\n\n\"Then what is the matter?\" persisted Dr. Alec.\n\nRose did not speak for a moment, and decapitated two fine geraniums with\na reckless slash of her scissors, as if pent-up vexation of some kind\nmust find a vent. It did in words also, for, as if quite against her\nwill, she exclaimed impetuously: \"The truth is, I'm jealous of them\nboth!\"\n\n\"Bless my soul! What now?\" ejaculated the doctor in great surprise.\n\nRose put down her water pot and shears, came and stood before him with\nher hands nervously twisted together, and said, just as she used to do\nwhen she was a little girl confessing some misdeed: \"Uncle, I must tell\nyou, for I've been getting very envious, discontented, and bad lately.\nNo, don't be good to me yet, for you don't know how little I deserve it.\nScold me well, and make me see how wicked I am.\"\n\n\"I will as soon as I know what I am to scold about. Unburden yourself,\nchild, and let me see all your iniquity, for if you begin by being\njealous of Mac and Phebe, I'm prepared for anything,\" said Dr. Alec,\nleaning back as if nothing could surprise him now.\n\n\"But I am not jealous in that way, sir. I mean I want to be or do\nsomething splendid as well as they. I can't write poetry or sing like a\nbird, but I should think I might have my share of glory in some way. I\nthought perhaps I could paint, and I've tried, but I can only copy I've\nno power to invent lovely things, and I'm so discouraged, for that is\nmy one accomplishment. Do you think I have any gift that could be\ncultivated and do me credit like theirs?\" she asked so wistfully that\nher uncle felt for a moment as if he never could forgive the fairies who\nendow babies in their cradles for being so niggardly to his girl. But\none look into the sweet, open face before him reminded him that the good\nelves had been very generous and he answered cheerfully: \"Yes, I do, for\nyou have one of the best and noblest gifts a woman can possess. Music\nand poetry are fine things, and I don't wonder you want them, or that\nyou envy the pleasant fame they bring. I've felt just so, and been ready\nto ask why it didn't please heaven to be more generous to some people,\nso you needn't be ashamed to tell me all about it.\"\n\n\"I know I ought to be contented, but I'm not. My life is very\ncomfortable, but so quiet and uneventful, I get tired of it and want to\nlaunch out as the others have, and do something, or at least try. I'm\nglad you think it isn't very bad of me, and I'd like to know what my\ngift is,\" said Rose, looking less despondent already.\n\n\"The art of living for others so patiently and sweetly that we enjoy it\nas we do the sunshine, and are not half grateful enough for the great\nblessing.\"\n\n\"It is very kind of you to say so, but I think I'd like a little fun and\nfame nevertheless.\" And Rose did not look as thankful as she ought.\n\n\"Very natural, dear, but the fun and the fame do not last, while the\nmemory of a real helper is kept green long after poetry is forgotten and\nmusic silent. Can't you believe that, and be happy?\"\n\n\"But I do so little, nobody sees or cares, and I don't feel as if I was\nreally of any use,\" sighed Rose, thinking of the long, dull winter, full\nof efforts that seemed fruitless.\n\n\"Sit here, and let us see if you really do very little and if no one\ncares.\" And, drawing her to his knee, Dr. Alec went on, telling off each\nitem on one of the fingers of the soft hand he held.\n\n\"First, an infirm old aunt is kept very happy by the patient, cheerful\ncare of this good-for-nothing niece. Secondly, a crotchety uncle, for\nwhom she reads, runs, writes, and sews so willingly that he cannot get\non without her. Thirdly, various relations who are helped in various\nways. Fourthly, one dear friend never forgotten, and a certain cousin\ncheered by praise which is more to him than the loudest blast Fame could\nblow. Fifthly, several young girls find her an example of many good\nworks and ways. Sixthly, a motherless baby is cared for as tenderly as\nif she were a little sister. Seventhly, half a dozen poor ladies made\ncomfortable; and, lastly, some struggling boys and girls with artistic\nlongings are put into a pleasant room furnished with casts, studies,\neasels, and all manner of helpful things, not to mention free lessons\ngiven by this same idle girl, who now sits upon my knee owning to\nherself that her gift is worth having after all.\"\n\n\"Indeed, I am! Uncle, I'd no idea I had done so many things to please\nyou, or that anyone guessed how hard I try to fill my place usefully.\nI've learned to do without gratitude now I'll learn not to care for\npraise, but to be contented to do my best, and have only God know.\"\n\n\"He knows, and He rewards in His own good time. I think a quiet life\nlike this often makes itself felt in better ways than one that the world\nsees and applauds, and some of the noblest are never known till they\nend, leaving a void in many hearts. Yours may be one of these if you\nchoose to make it so, and no one will be prouder of this success than I,\nunless it be Mac.\"\n\nThe clouds were quite gone now, and Rose was looking straight into her\nuncle's face with a much happier expression when that last word made\nit color brightly and the eyes glance away for a second. Then they came\nback full of a tender sort of resolution as she said: \"That will be\nthe reward I work for,\" and rose, as if ready to be up and doing with\nrenewed courage.\n\nBut her uncle held her long enough to ask quite soberly, though his eyes\nlaughed: \"Shall I tell him that?\"\n\n\"No, sir, please don't! When he is tired of other people's praise, he\nwill come home, and then I'll see what I can do for him,\" answered Rose,\nslipping away to her work with the shy, happy look that sometimes came\nto give to her face the charm it needed.\n\n\"He is such a thorough fellow, he never is in a hurry to go from one\nthing to another. An excellent habit, but a trifle trying to impatient\npeople like me,\" said the doctor and, picking up Dulce, who sat upon\nthe rug with her dolly, he composed his feelings by tossing her till she\ncrowed with delight.\n\nRose heartily echoed that last remark, but said nothing aloud, only\nhelped her uncle off with dutiful alacrity and, when he was gone, began\nto count the days till his return, wishing she had decided to go too.\n\nHe wrote often, giving excellent accounts of the \"great creatures,\" as\nSteve called Phebe and Mac, and seemed to find so much to do in various\nways that the second week of absence was nearly over before he set a\nday for his return, promising to astonish them with the account of his\nadventures.\n\nRose felt as if something splendid was going to happen and set her\naffairs in order so that the approaching crisis might find her fully\nprepared. She had \"found out\" now, was quite sure, and put away all\ndoubts and fears to be ready to welcome home the cousin whom she was\nsure Uncle would bring as her reward. She was thinking of this one day\nas she got out her paper to write a long letter to poor Aunt Clara, who\npined for news far away there in Calcutta.\n\nSomething in the task reminded her of that other lover whose wooing\nended so tragically, and opening a little drawer of keepsakes, she took\nout the blue bracelet, feeling that she owed Charlie a tender thought in\nthe midst of her new happiness, for of late she had forgotten him.\n\nShe had worn the trinket hidden under her black sleeve for a long time\nafter his death, with the regretful constancy one sometimes shows in\ndoing some little kindness all too late. But her arm had grown too round\nto hide the ornament, the forget-me-nots had fallen one by one,\nthe clasp had broken, and that autumn she laid the bracelet away,\nacknowledging that she had outgrown the souvenir as well as the\nsentiment that gave it.\n\nShe looked at it in silence for a moment, then put it softly back and,\nshutting the drawer, took up the little gray book which was her pride,\nthinking as she contrasted the two men and their influence on her life\nthe one sad and disturbing, the other sweet and inspiring \"Charlie's was\npassion Mac's is love.\"\n\n\"Rose! Rose!\" called a shrill voice, rudely breaking the pensive\nreverie, and with a start, she shut the desk, exclaiming as she ran to\nthe door: \"They have come! They have come!\"\n\n\n\n\nChapter 21 HOW PHEBE EARNED HER WELCOME\n\nDr. Alec had not arrived, but bad tidings had, as Rose guessed the\ninstant her eyes fell upon Aunt Plenty, hobbling downstairs with her\ncap awry, her face pale, and a letter flapping wildly in her hand as she\ncried distractedly: \"Oh, my boy! My boy! Sick, and I not there to nurse\nhim! Malignant fever, so far away. What can those children do? Why did I\nlet Alec go?\"\n\nRose got her into the parlor, and while the poor old lady lamented, she\nread the letter which Phebe had sent to her that she might \"break the\nnews carefully to Rose.\"\n\nDEAR MISS PLENTY, Please read this to yourself first, and tell my little\nmistress as you think best. The dear doctor is very ill, but I am with\nhim, and shall not leave him day or night till he is safe. So trust me,\nand do not be anxious, for everything shall be done that care and skill\nand entire devotion can do. He would not let us tell you before, fearing\nyou would try to come at the risk of your health. Indeed it would be\nuseless, for only one nurse is needed, and I came first, so do not let\nRose or anybody else rob me of my right to the danger and the duty. Mac\nhas written to his father, for Dr. Alec is now too ill to know what we\ndo, and we both felt that you ought to be told without further delay. He\nhas a bad malignant fever, caught no one can tell how, unless among some\npoor emigrants whom he met wandering about quite forlorn in a strange\ncity. He understood Portuguese and sent them to a proper place when they\nhad told their story. But I fear he has suffered for his kindness, for\nthis fever came on rapidly, and before he knew what it was I was there,\nand it was too late to send me away.\n\nNow I can show you how grateful I am, and if need be give my life so\ngladly for this friend who has been a father to me. Tell Rose his last\nconscious word and thought were for her. \"Don't let her come; keep my\ndarling safe.\" Oh, do obey him! Stay safely at home and, God helping me,\nI'll bring Uncle Alec back in time. Mac does all I will let him. We have\nthe best physicians, and everything is going as well as can be hoped\ntill the fever turns.\n\nDear Miss Plenty, pray for him and for me, that I may do this one happy\nthing for those who have done so much for Your ever dutiful and loving\n\nPHEBE\n\nAs Rose looked up from the letter, half stunned by the sudden news\nand the great danger, she found that the old lady had already stopped\nuseless bewailing and was praying heartily, like one who knew well where\nhelp was to be found. Rose went and knelt down at her knee, laying her\nface on the clasped hands in her lap, and for a few minutes neither\nwept nor spoke. Then a stifled sob broke from the girl, and Aunt Plenty\ngathered the young head in her arms, saying, with the slow tears of age\ntrickling down her own withered cheeks: \"Bear up, my lamb, bear up. The\ngood Lord won't take him from us I am sure and that brave child will be\nallowed to pay her debt to him. I feel she will.\"\n\n\"But I want to help. I must go, Aunty, I must no matter what the danger\nis,\" cried Rose, full of a tender jealousy of Phebe for being first to\nbrave peril for the sake of him who had been a father to them both.\n\n\"You can't go, dear, it's no use now, and she is right to say, 'Keep\naway.' I know those fevers, and the ones who nurse often take it, and\nfare worse for the strain they've been through. Good girl to stand by so\nbravely, to be so sensible, and not let Mac go too near! She's a grand\nnurse Alec couldn't have a better, and she'll never leave him till he's\nsafe,\" said Miss Plenty excitedly.\n\n\"Ah, you begin to know her now, and value her as you ought. I think few\nwould have done as she has, and if she does get ill and die, it will be\nour fault partly, because she'd go through fire and water to make us\ndo her justice and receive her as we ought,\" cried Rose, proud of an\nexample which she longed to follow.\n\n\"If she brings my boy home, I'll never say another word. She may marry\nevery nephew I've got, if she likes, and I'll give her my blessing,\"\nexclaimed Aunt Plenty, feeling that no price would be too much to pay\nfor such a deed.\n\nRose was going to clap her hands, but wrung them instead, remembering\nwith a sudden pang that the battle was not over yet, and it was much too\nsoon to award the honors.\n\nBefore she could speak Uncle Mac and Aunt Jane hurried in, for Mac's\nletter had come with the other, and dismay fell upon the family at the\nthought of danger to the well-beloved Uncle Alec. His brother decided\nto go at once, and Aunt Jane insisted on accompanying him, though all\nagreed that nothing could be done but wait, and leave Phebe at her post\nas long as she held out, since it was too late to save her from danger\nnow and Mac reported her quite equal to the task.\n\nGreat was the hurry and confusion till the relief party was off. Aunt\nPlenty was heartbroken that she could not go with them, but felt that\nshe was too infirm to be useful and, like a sensible old soul, tried to\ncontent herself with preparing all sorts of comforts for the invalid.\nRose was less patient, and at first had wild ideas of setting off alone\nand forcing her way to the spot where all her thoughts now centered. But\nbefore she could carry out any rash project, Aunt Myra's palpitations\nset in so alarmingly that they did good service for once and kept Rose\nbusy taking her last directions and trying to soothe her dying bed, for\neach attack was declared fatal till the patient demanded toast and tea,\nwhen hope was again allowable and the rally began.\n\nThe news flew fast, as such tidings always do, and Aunt Plenty was\nconstantly employed in answering inquiries, for her knocker kept up a\nsteady tattoo for several days. All sorts of people came: gentlefolk\nand paupers, children with anxious little faces, old people full of\nsympathy, pretty girls sobbing as they went away, and young men who\nrelieved their feelings by swearing at all emigrants in general and\nPortuguese in particular. It was touching and comforting to see how many\nloved the good man who was known only by his benefactions and now lay\nsuffering far away, quite unconscious how many unsuspected charities\nwere brought to light by this grateful solicitude as hidden flowers\nspring up when warm rains fall.\n\nIf Rose had ever felt that the gift of living for others was a poor one,\nshe saw now how beautiful and blessed it was how rich the returns, how\nwide the influence, how much more precious the tender tie which knit so\nmany hearts together than any breath of fame or brilliant talent that\ndazzled but did not win and warm. In after years she found how true her\nuncle's words had been and, listening to eulogies of great men, felt\nless moved and inspired by praises of their splendid gifts than by the\nsight of some good man's patient labor for the poorest of his kind. Her\nheroes ceased to be the world's favorites and became such as Garrison\nfighting for his chosen people; Howe restoring lost senses to the deaf,\nthe dumb, and blind; Sumner unbribable, when other men were bought and\nsold and many a large-hearted woman working as quietly as Abby Gibbons,\nwho for thirty years had made Christmas merry for two hundred little\npaupers in a city almshouse, besides saving Magdalens and teaching\nconvicts.\n\nThe lesson came to Rose when she was ready for it, and showed her what\na noble profession philanthropy is, made her glad of her choice, and\nhelped fit her for a long life full of the loving labor and sweet\nsatisfaction unostentatious charity brings to those who ask no reward\nand are content if \"only God knows.\"\n\nSeveral anxious weeks went by with wearing fluctuations of hope and\nfear, for Life and Death fought over the prize each wanted, and more\nthan once Death seemed to have won. But Phebe stood at her post, defying\nboth danger and Death with the courage and devotion women often show.\nAll her soul and strength were in her work, and when it seemed most\nhopeless, she cried out with the passionate energy which seems to send\nsuch appeals straight up to heaven: \"Grant me this one boon, dear Lord,\nand I will never ask another for myself!\"\n\nSuch prayers avail much, and such entire devotion often seems to work\nmiracles when other aids are in vain. Phebe's cry was answered, her\nself-forgetful task accomplished, and her long vigil rewarded with a\nhappy dawn. Dr. Alec always said that she kept him alive by the force of\nher will, and that, during the hours when he seemed to lie unconscious,\nhe felt a strong, warm hand holding his, as if keeping him away from\nthe swift current trying to sweep him away. The happiest hour of all her\nlife was that in which he knew her, looked up with the shadow of a smile\nin his hollow eyes, and tried to say in his old cheery way: \"Tell Rose\nI've turned the corner, thanks to you, my child.\"\n\nShe answered very quietly, smoothed the pillow, and saw him drop asleep\nagain before she stole away into the other room, meaning to write the\ngood news, but could only throw herself down and find relief for a full\nheart in the first tears she had shed for weeks. Mac found her there,\nand took such care of her that she was ready to go back to her place now\nindeed a post of honor while he ran off to send home a telegram which\nmade many hearts sing for joy and caused Jamie, in his first burst of\ndelight, to propose to ring all the city bells and order out the cannon:\n\"Saved thanks to God and Phebe.\"\n\nThat was all, but everyone was satisfied, and everyone fell a-crying,\nas if hope needed much salty water to strengthen it. That was soon over,\nhowever, and then people went about smiling and saying to one another,\nwith handshakes or embraces, \"He is better no doubt of it now!\" A\ngeneral desire to rush away and assure themselves of the truth pervaded\nthe family for some days, and nothing but awful threats from Mac, stern\nmandates from the doctor, and entreaties from Phebe not to undo her work\nkept Miss Plenty, Rose, and Aunt Jessie at home.\n\nAs the only way in which they could ease their minds and bear the delay,\nthey set about spring cleaning with an energy which scared the spiders\nand drove charwomen distracted. If the old house had been infected with\nsmallpox, it could not have been more vigorously scrubbed, aired, and\nrefreshed. Early as it was, every carpet was routed up, curtains pulled\ndown, cushions banged, and glory holes turned out till not a speck of\ndust, a last year's fly, or stray straw could be found. Then they all\nsat down and rested in such an immaculate mansion that one hardly dared\nto move for fear of destroying the shining order everywhere visible.\n\nIt was late in April before this was accomplished, and the necessary\nquarantine of the absentees well over. The first mild days seemed to\ncome early, so that Dr. Alec might return with safety from the journey\nwhich had so nearly been his last. It was perfectly impossible to keep\nany member of the family away on that great occasion. They came from all\nquarters in spite of express directions to the contrary, for the invalid\nwas still very feeble and no excitement must be allowed. As if the wind\ncarried the glad news, Uncle Jem came into port the night before; Will\nand Geordie got a leave on their own responsibility; Steve would have\ndefied the entire faculty, had it been necessary; and Uncle Mac and\nArchie said simultaneously, \"Business be hanged today.\"\n\nOf course the aunts arrived in all their best, all cautioning everybody\nelse to keep quiet and all gabbling excitedly at the least provocation.\nJamie suffered the most during that day, so divided was he between the\ndesire to behave well and the frantic impulse to shout at the top of his\nvoice, turn somersaults, and race all over the house. Occasional bolts\ninto the barn, where he let off steam by roaring and dancing jigs, to\nthe great dismay of the fat old horses and two sedate cows, helped him\nto get through that trying period.\n\nBut the heart that was fullest beat and fluttered in Rose's bosom as\nshe went about putting spring flowers everywhere; very silent, but so\nradiant with happiness that the aunts watched her, saying softly to one\nanother, \"Could an angel look sweeter?\"\n\nIf angels ever wore pale green gowns and snowdrops in their hair, had\ncountenances full of serenest joy, and large eyes shining with an inward\nlight that made them very lovely, then Rose did look like one. But she\nfelt like a woman and well she might, for was not life very rich that\nday, when Uncle, friend, and lover were coming back to her together?\nCould she ask anything more, except the power to be to all of them the\ncreature they believed her, and to return the love they gave her with\none as faithful, pure, and deep? Among the portraits in the hall hung\none of Dr. Alec, done soon after his return by Charlie in one of his\nbrief fits of inspiration. Only a crayon, but wonderfully lifelike and\ncarefully finished, as few of the others were. This had been handsomely\nframed and now held the place of honor, garlanded with green wreaths,\nwhile the great Indian jar below blazed with a pyramid of hothouse\nflowers sent by Kitty. Rose was giving these a last touch, with Dulce\nclose by, cooing over a handful of sweet \"daffydowndillies,\" when the\nsound of wheels sent her flying to the door. She meant to have spoken\nthe first welcome and had the first embrace, but when she saw the\naltered face in the carriage, the feeble figure being borne up the steps\nby all the boys, she stood motionless till Phebe caught her in her arms,\nwhispering with a laugh and a cry struggling in her voice: \"I did it for\nyou, my darling, all for you!\"\n\n\"Oh, Phebe, never say again you owe me anything! I never can repay you\nfor this,\" was all Rose had time to answer as they stood one instant\ncheek to cheek, heart to heart, both too full of happiness for many\nwords.\n\nAunt Plenty had heard the wheels also and, as everybody rose en masse,\nhad said as impressively as extreme agitation would allow, while she\nput her glasses on upside down and seized a lace tidy instead of her\nhandkerchief: \"Stop! All stay here, and let me receive Alec. Remember\nhis weak state, and be calm, quite calm, as I am.'\n\n\"Yes, Aunt, certainly,\" was the general murmur of assent, but it was\nas impossible to obey as it would have been to keep feathers still in\na gale, and one irresistible impulse carried the whole roomful into the\nhall to behold Aunt Plenty beautifully illustrating her own theory of\ncomposure by waving the tidy wildly, rushing into Dr. Alec's arms, and\nlaughing and crying with a hysterical abandonment which even Aunt Myra\ncould not have surpassed.\n\nThe tearful jubilee was soon over, however, and no one seemed the\nworse for it, for the instant his arms were at liberty, Dr. Alec forgot\nhimself and began to make other people happy by saying seriously, though\nhis thin face beamed paternally, as he drew Phebe forward: \"Aunt Plenty,\nbut for this good daughter I never should have come back to be so\nwelcomed. Love her for my sake.\"\n\nThen the old lady came out splendidly and showed her mettle, for,\nturning to Phebe, she bowed her gray head as if saluting an equal and,\noffering her hand, answered with repentance, admiration, and tenderness\ntrembling in her voice: \"I'm proud to do it for her own sake. I ask\npardon for my silly prejudices, and I'll prove that I'm sincere by\nwhere's that boy?\"\n\nThere were six boys present, but the right one was in exactly the right\nplace at the right moment, and, seizing Archie's hand, Aunt Plenty put\nPhebe's into it, trying to say something appropriately solemn, but could\nnot, so hugged them both and sobbed out: \"If I had a dozen nephews, I'd\ngive them all to you, my dear, and dance at the wedding, though I had\nrheumatism in every limb.\"\n\nThat was better than any oration, for it set them all to laughing, and\nDr. Alec was floated to the sofa on a gentle wave of merriment. Once\nthere, everyone but Rose and Aunt Plenty was ordered off by Mac, who was\nin command now and seemed to have sunk the poet in the physician.\n\n\"The house must be perfectly quiet, and he must go to sleep as soon as\npossible after the journey, so all say 'good-bye' now and call again\ntomorrow,\" he said, watching his uncle anxiously as he leaned in the\nsofa corner, with four women taking off his wraps, three boys contending\nfor his overshoes, two brothers shaking hands at short intervals, and\nAunt Myra holding a bottle of strong salts under his devoted nose every\ntime there was an opening anywhere.\n\nWith difficulty the house was partially cleared, and then, while Aunt\nPlenty mounted guard over her boy, Rose stole away to see if Mac had\ngone with the rest, for as yet they had hardly spoken in the joyful\nflurry, though eyes and hands had met.\n\n\n\n\nChapter 22 SHORT AND SWEET\n\nIn the hall she found Steve and Kitty, for he had hidden his little\nsweetheart behind the big couch, feeling that she had a right there,\nhaving supported his spirits during the late anxiety with great\nconstancy and courage. They seemed so cozy, billing and cooing in the\nshadow of the gay vase, that Rose would have slipped silently away if\nthey had not seen and called to her. \"He's not gone I guess you'll find\nhim in the parlor,\" said Steve, divining with a lover's instinct the\nmeaning of the quick look she had cast at the hat rack as she shut the\nstudy door behind her.\n\n\"Mercy, no! Archie and Phebe are there, so he'd have the sense to pop\ninto the sanctum and wait, unless you'd like me to go and bring him\nout?\" added Kitty, smoothing Rose's ruffled hair and settling the\nflowers on the bosom where Uncle Alec's head had lain until he fell\nasleep.\n\n\"No, thank you, I'll go to him when I've seen my Phebe. She won't mind\nme,\" answered Rose, moving on to the parlor.\n\n\"Look here,\" called Steve, \"do advise them to hurry up and all be\nmarried at once. We were just ready when Uncle fell ill, and now we\ncannot wait a day later than the first of May.\"\n\n\"Rather short notice,\" laughed Rose, looking back with the doorknob in\nher hand.\n\n\"We'll give up all our splendor, and do it as simply as you like, if\nyou will only come too. Think how lovely! Three weddings at once! Do\nfly round and settle things there's a dear,\" implored Kitty, whose\nimagination was fired with this romantic idea.\n\n\"How can I, when I have no bridegroom yet?\" began Rose, with conscious\ncolor in her telltale face.\n\n\"Sly creature! You know you've only got to say a word and have a famous\none. Una and her lion will be nothing to it,\" cried Steve, bent on\nhastening his brother's affair, which was much too dilatory and peculiar\nfor his taste.\n\n\"He has been in no haste to come home, and I am in no haste to leave it.\nDon't wait for me, 'Mr. and Mrs. Harry Walmers, Jr.,' I shall be a year\nat least making up my mind, so you may lead off as splendidly as you\nlike and I'll profit by your experience.\" And Rose vanished into the\nparlor, leaving Steve to groan over the perversity of superior women and\nKitty to comfort him by promising to marry him on May Day \"all alone.\"\n\nA very different couple occupied the drawing room, but a happier one,\nfor they had known the pain of separation and were now enjoying the\nbliss of a reunion which was to last unbroken for their lives. Phebe sat\nin an easy chair, resting from her labors, pale and thin and worn, but\nlovelier in Archie's eyes than ever before. It was very evident that he\nwas adoring his divinity, for, after placing a footstool at her feet, he\nhad forgotten to get up and knelt there with his elbow on the arm of\nher chair, looking like a thirsty man drinking long drafts of the purest\nwater.\n\n\"Shall I disturb you if I pass through?\" asked Rose, loath to spoil the\npretty tableau.\n\n\"Not if you stop a minute on the way and congratulate me, Cousin, for\nshe says 'yes' at last!\" cried Archie, springing up to go and bring her\nto the arms Phebe opened as she appeared.\n\n\"I knew she would reward your patience and put away her pride when both\nhad been duly tried,\" said Rose, laying the tired head on her bosom with\nsuch tender admiration in her eyes that Phebe had to shake some bright\ndrops from her own before she could reply in a tone of grateful humility\nthat showed how much her heart was touched: \"How can I help it, when\nthey are all so kind to me? Any pride would melt away under such praise\nand thanks and loving wishes as I've had today, for every member of the\nfamily has taken pains to welcome me, to express far too much gratitude,\nand to beg me to be one of you. I needed very little urging, but when\nArchie's father and mother came and called me 'daughter,' I would have\npromised anything to show my love for them.\"\n\n\"And him,\" added Rose, but Archie seemed quite satisfied and kissed the\nhand he held as if it had been that of a beloved princess while he said\nwith all the pride Phebe seemed to have lost: \"Think what she gives up\nfor me fame and fortune and the admiration of many a better man. You\ndon't know what a splendid prospect she has of becoming one of the sweet\nsingers who are loved and honored everywhere, and all this she puts away\nfor my sake, content to sing for me alone, with no reward but love.\"\n\n\"I am so glad to make a little sacrifice for a great happiness I never\nshall regret it or think my music lost if it makes home cheerful for my\nmate. Birds sing sweetest in their own nests, you know.\" And Phebe bent\ntoward him with a look and gesture which plainly showed how willingly\nshe offered up all ambitious hopes upon the altar of a woman's happy\nlove.\n\nBoth seemed to forget that they were not alone, and in a moment they\nwere, for a sudden impulse carried Rose to the door of her sanctum, as\nif the south wind which seemed to have set in was wafting this little\nship also toward the Islands of the Blessed, where the others were\nsafely anchored now.\n\nThe room was a blaze of sunshine and a bower of spring freshness and\nfragrance, for here Rose had let her fancy have free play, and each\ngarland, fern, and flower had its meaning. Mac seemed to have been\nreading this sweet language of symbols, to have guessed why Charlie's\nlittle picture was framed in white roses, why pansies hung about his\nown, why Psyche was half hidden among feathery sprays of maidenhair, and\na purple passion flower lay at Cupid's feet. The last fancy evidently\npleased him, for he was smiling over it, and humming to himself as if\nto beguile his patient waiting, the burden of the air Rose had so often\nsung to him:\n\n\"Bonny lassie, will ye gang, will ye gang To the birks of Aberfeldie?\"\n\n\"Yes, Mac, anywhere!\"\n\nHe had not heard her enter, and wheeling around, looked at her with a\nradiant face as he said, drawing a long breath, \"At last! You were so\nbusy over the dear man, I got no word. But I can wait I'm used to it.\"\n\nRose stood quite still, surveying him with a new sort of reverence in\nher eyes, as she answered with a sweet solemnity that made him laugh and\nredden with the sensitive joy of one to whom praise from her lips was\nvery precious: \"You forget that you are not the Mac who went away. I\nshould have run to meet my cousin, but I did not dare to be familiar\nwith the poet whom all begin to honor.\"\n\n\"You like the mixture, then? You know I said I'd try to give you love\nand poetry together.\"\n\n\"Like it! I'm so glad, so proud, I haven't any words strong and\nbeautiful enough to half express my wonder and my admiration. How could\nyou do it, Mac?\" And a whole face full of smiles broke loose as Rose\nclapped her hands, looking as if she could dance with sheer delight.\n\n\"It did itself, up there among the hills, and here with you, or out\nalone upon the sea. I could write a heavenly poem this very minute, and\nput you in as Spring you look like her in that green gown with snowdrops\nin your bonny hair. Rose, am I getting on a little? Does a hint of fame\nhelp me nearer to the prize I'm working for? Is your heart more willing\nto be won?\"\n\nHe did not stir a step, but looked at her with such intense longing that\nhis glance seemed to draw her nearer like an irresistible appeal, for\nshe went and stood before him, holding out both hands, as if she offered\nall her little store, as she said with simplest sincerity: \"It is not\nworth so much beautiful endeavor, but if you still want so poor a thing,\nit is yours.\"\n\nHe caught her hands in his and seemed about to take the rest of her, but\nhesitated for an instant, unable to believe that so much happiness was\ntrue.\n\n\"Are you sure, Rose very sure? Don't let a momentary admiration blind\nyou I'm not a poet yet, and the best are but mortal men, you know.\"\n\n\"It is not admiration, Mac.\"\n\n\"Nor gratitude for the small share I've taken in saving Uncle? I had my\ndebt to pay, as well as Phebe, and was as glad to risk my life.\"\n\n\"No it is not gratitude.\"\n\n\"Nor pity for my patience? I've only done a little yet, and I am as far\nas ever from being like your hero. I can work and wait still longer if\nyou are not sure, for I must have all or nothing.\"\n\n\"Oh, Mac! Why will you be so doubtful? You said you'd make me love\nyou, and you've done it. Will you believe me now?\" And, with a sort of\ndesperation, she threw herself into his arms, clinging there in eloquent\nsilence while he held her close; feeling, with a thrill of tender\ntriumph, that this was no longer little Rose, but a loving woman, ready\nto live and die for him.\n\n\"Now I'm satisfied!\" he said presently, when she lifted up her face,\nfull of maidenly shame at the sudden passion which had carried her out\nof herself for a moment. \"No don't slip away so soon. Let me keep you\nfor one blessed minute and feel that I have really found my Psyche.\"\n\n\"And I my Cupid,\" answered Rose, laughing, in spite of her emotion, at\nthe idea of Mac in that sentimental character.\n\nHe laughed, too, as only a happy lover could, then said, with sudden\nseriousness: \"Sweet soul! Lift up your lamp and look well before it is\ntoo late, for I'm no god, only a very faulty man.\"\n\n\"Dear love! I will. But I have no fear, except that you will fly too\nhigh for me to follow, because I have no wings.\"\n\n\"You shall live the poetry, and I will write it, so my little gift will\ncelebrate your greater one.\"\n\n\"No you shall have all the fame, and I'll be content to be known only as\nthe poet's wife.\"\n\n\"And I'll be proud to own that my best inspiration comes from the\nbeneficent life of a sweet and noble woman.\"\n\n\"Oh, Mac! We'll work together and try to make the world better by the\nmusic and the love we leave behind us when we go.\"\n\n\"Please God, we will!\" he answered fervently and, looking at her as she\nstood there in the spring sunshine, glowing with the tender happiness,\nhigh hopes, and earnest purposes that make life beautiful and sacred, he\nfelt that now the last leaf had folded back, the golden heart lay open\nto the light, and his Rose had bloomed.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Rose in Bloom, by Louisa May Alcott\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK ROSE IN BLOOM ***\n\n***** This file should be named 2804-8.txt or 2804-8.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/2\/8\/0\/2804\/\n\nProduced by David Reed\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http:\/\/pglaf.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":1366,"split":"test"}
