{"ori_id":"cefe0b107c44873159f4502d8698c5a3ad9352a0","title":"The Tale of Genji","context":"The Tale of Genji\n The work recounts the life of Hikaru Genji, or \"Shining Genji\", the son of an ancient Japanese emperor, known to readers as Emperor Kiritsubo, and a low-ranking but beloved concubine called Lady Kiritsubo. For political reasons, the emperor removes Genji from the line of succession, demoting him to a commoner by giving him the surname Minamoto, and he pursues a career as an imperial officer. The tale concentrates on Genji's romantic life and describes the customs of the aristocratic society of the time.\nGenji's mother dies when he is three years old, and the Emperor cannot forget her. The Emperor Kiritsubo then hears of a woman (Lady Fujitsubo), formerly a princess of the preceding emperor, who resembles his deceased concubine, and later she becomes one of his wives. Genji loves her first as a stepmother, but later as a woman, and they fall in love with each other. Genji is frustrated by his forbidden love for the Lady Fujitsubo and is on bad terms with his wife (Aoi no Ue). He engages in a series of unfulfilling love affairs with other women, but in most cases his advances are rebuffed, his lover dies suddenly during the affair, or he becomes bored with his lover.\nGenji visits Kitayama, the northern rural hilly area of Kyoto, where he finds a beautiful ten-year-old girl. He is fascinated by this little girl (Murasaki), and discovers that she is a niece of the Lady Fujitsubo. Finally he kidnaps her, brings her to his own palace and educates her to be his ideal lady \u2014 that is, like the Lady Fujitsubo. During this time Genji also meets the Lady Fujitsubo secretly, and she bears his son, Reizei. Everyone except the two lovers believes the father of the child is the Emperor Kiritsubo. Later, the boy becomes the Crown Prince and Lady Fujitsubo becomes the Empress, but Genji and Lady Fujitsubo swear to keep their secret.\nGenji and his wife, Lady Aoi, reconcile. She gives birth to a son but dies soon after. Genji is sorrowful, but finds consolation in Murasaki, whom he marries. Genji's father, the Emperor Kiritsubo, dies. He is succeeded by his son Suzaku, whose mother (Kokiden), together with Kiritsubo's political enemies, takes power in the court. Then another of Genji's secret love affairs is exposed: Genji and a concubine of the Emperor Suzaku are discovered when they meet in secret. The Emperor Suzaku confides his personal amusement at Genji's exploits with the woman (Oborozukiyo), but is duty-bound to punish his half-brother. He exiles Genji to the town of Suma in rural Harima province (now part of Kobe in Hy\u014dgo Prefecture). There, a prosperous man known as the Akashi Novice (because he is from Akashi in Settsu province) entertains Genji, and Genji has a love affair with Akashi's daughter. She gives birth to Genji's only daughter, who will later become the Empress.\nIn the capital, the Emperor Suzaku is troubled by dreams of his late father, Kiritsubo, and something begins to affect his eyes. Meanwhile, his mother, Kokiden, grows ill, which weakens her powerful sway over the throne. Thus the Emperor orders Genji pardoned, and he returns to Kyoto. His son by Lady Fujitsubo, Reizei, becomes the emperor. The new Emperor Reizei knows Genji is his real father, and raises Genji's rank to the highest possible.\nHowever, when Genji turns 40 years old, his life begins to decline. His political status does not change, but his love and emotional life are slowly damaged. He marries another wife, the Third Princess (known as Onna san no miya in the Seidensticker version, or Ny\u014dsan in Waley's). Genji's nephew, Kashiwagi, later forces himself on the Third Princess, and she bears Kaoru (who, in a similar situation to that of Reizei, is legally known as the son of Genji). Genji's new marriage changes his relationship with Murasaki, who becomes a nun (bikuni).\nGenji's beloved Murasaki dies. In the following chapter, Maboroshi (\"Illusion\"), Genji contemplates how fleeting life is. Immediately after Maboroshi, there is a chapter entitled Kumogakure (\"Vanished into the Clouds\"), which is left blank, but implies the death of Genji.\nThe rest of the work is known as the \"Uji Chapters\". These chapters follow Kaoru and his best friend, Niou. Niou is an imperial prince, the son of Genji's daughter, the current Empress now that Reizei has abdicated the throne, while Kaoru is known to the world as Genji's son but is in fact fathered by Genji's nephew. The chapters involve Kaoru and Niou's rivalry over several daughters of an imperial prince who lives in Uji, a place some distance away from the capital. The tale ends abruptly, with Kaoru wondering if Niou is hiding the lady the former loves away from him. Kaoru has sometimes been called the first anti-hero in literature.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg EBook of Japanese Literature, by Various\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

It has been regarded for\ncenturies as a national treasure. The title of the work is by no means\nunknown to those Europeans who take an interest in Japanese matters,\nfor it is mentioned or alluded to in almost every European work\nrelating to our country. It was written by a lady, who, from her\nwritings, is considered one of the most talented women that Japan has\never produced.\n\nShe was the daughter of Fujiwara Tametoki, a petty Court noble,\nremotely connected with the great family of Fujiwara, in the tenth\ncentury after Christ, and was generally called Murasaki Shikib. About\nthese names a few remarks are necessary. The word \"Shikib\" means\n\"ceremonies,\" and is more properly a name adopted, with the addition\nof certain suffixes, to designate special Court offices. Thus the term\n\"Shikib-Ki\u00c3\u00b4\" is synonymous with \"master of the ceremonies,\" and\n\"Shikib-no-Ji\u00c3\u00b4\" with \"secretary to the master of the ceremonies.\"\nHence it might at first sight appear rather peculiar if such an\nappellation should happen to be used as the name of a woman. It was,\nhowever, a custom of the period for noble ladies and their attendants\nto be often called after such offices, generally with the suffix\n\"No-Kata,\" indicating the female sex, and somewhat corresponding to\nthe word \"madam.\" This probably originated in the same way as the\npractice in America of calling ladies by their husbands' official\ntitles, such as Mrs. Captain, Mrs. Judge, etc., only that in the case\nof the Japanese custom the official title came in time to be used\nwithout any immediate association with the offices themselves, and\noften even as a maiden name. From this custom our authoress came to\nbe called \"Shikib,\" a name which did not originally apply to a person.\nTo this another name, Murasaki, was added, in order to distinguish her\nfrom other ladies who may also have been called Shikib. \"Murasaki\"\nmeans \"violet,\" whether the flower or the color. Concerning the origin\nof this appellation there exist two different opinions. Those holding\none, derive it from her family name, Fujiwara; for \"Fujiwara\"\nliterally means \"the field of Wistaria,\" and the color of the Wistaria\nblossom is violet. Those holding the other, trace it to the fact that\nout of several persons introduced into the story, Violet (Murasaki in\nthe text) is a most modest and gentle woman, whence it is thought that\nthe admirers of the work transferred the name to the authoress\nherself. In her youth she was maid of honor to a daughter of the then\nprime minister, who became eventually the wife of the Emperor Ichiji\u00c3\u00b4,\nbetter known by her surname, Ji\u00c3\u00b4t\u00c3\u00b4-Monin, and who is especially famous\nas having been the patroness of our authoress. Murasaki Shikib married\na noble, named Nobtaka, to whom she bore a daughter, who, herself,\nwrote a work of fiction, called \"Sagoromo\" (narrow sleeves). She\nsurvived her husband, Nobtaka, some years, and spent her latter days\nin quiet retirement, dying in the year 992 after Christ. The diary\nwhich she wrote during her retirement is still in existence, and her\ntomb may yet be seen in a Buddhist temple in Ki\u00c3\u00b4to, the old capital\nwhere the principal scenes of her story are laid.\n\nThe exact date when her story was written is not given in the work,\nbut her diary proves that it was evidently composed before she arrived\nat old age.\n\nThe traditional account given of the circumstances which preceded the\nwriting of the story is this: when the above-mentioned Empress was\nasked by the Saig\u00c3\u00bb (the sacred virgin of the temple of Ise) if her\nMajesty could not procure an interesting romance for her, because the\nolder fictions had become too familiar, she requested Shikib to write\na new one, and the result of this request was this story.\n\nThe tradition goes on to say that when this request was made Shikib\nretired to the Buddhist temple in Ishiyama, situated on hilly ground\nat the head of the picturesque river Wooji, looking down on Lake Biwa.\nThere she betook herself to undergo the \"Tooya\" (confinement in a\ntemple throughout the night), a solemn religious observance for the\npurpose of obtaining divine help and good success in her undertaking.\nIt was the evening of the fifteenth of August. Before her eyes the\nview extended for miles. In the silver lake below, the pale face of\nthe full moon was reflected in the calm, mirror-like waters,\ndisplaying itself in indescribable beauty. Her mind became more and\nmore serene as she gazed on the prospect before her, while her\nimagination became more and more lively as she grew calmer and calmer.\nThe ideas and incidents of the story, which she was about to write,\nstole into her mind as if by divine influence. The first topic which\nstruck her most strongly was that given in the chapters on exile.\nThese she wrote down immediately, in order not to allow the\ninspiration of the moment to be lost, on the back of a roll of\nDaihannia (the Chinese translation of Mah\u00c3\u00a2praj\u00c3\u00b1\u00c3\u00a2p\u00c3\u00a2ramit\u00c3\u00a2, one of the\nBuddhist S\u00c3\u00bbtras), and formed subsequently two chapters in the text,\nthe Suma and Akashi, all the remaining parts of the work having been\nadded one by one. It is said that this idea of exile came naturally to\nher mind, because a prince who had been known to her from her\nchildhood had been an exile at Ki\u00c3\u00bbsi\u00c3\u00bb, a little before this period.\n\nIt is also said that the authoress afterwards copied the roll of\nDaihannia with her own hand, in expiation of her having profanely used\nit as a notebook, and that she dedicated it to the Temple, in which\nthere is still a room where she is alleged to have written down the\nstory. A roll of Daihannia is there also, which is asserted to be the\nvery same one copied by her.\n\nHow far these traditions are in accordance with fact may be a matter\nof question, but thus they have come down to us, and are popularly\nbelieved.\n\nMany Europeans, I daresay, have noticed on our lacquer work and other\nart objects, the representation of a lady seated at a writing-desk,\nwith a pen held in her tiny fingers, gazing at the moon reflected in a\nlake. This lady is no other than our authoress.\n\nThe number of chapters in the modern text of the story is fifty-four,\none of these having the title only and nothing else. There is some\nreason to believe that there might have existed a few additional\nchapters.\n\nOf these fifty-four chapters, the first forty-one relate to the life\nand adventures of Prince Genji; and those which come after refer\nprincipally to one of his sons. The last ten are supposed to have\nbeen added by another hand, generally presumed to have been that of\nher daughter. This is conjectured because the style of these final\nchapters is somewhat dissimilar to that of those which precede. The\nperiod of time covered by the entire story is some sixty years, and\nthis volume of translation comprises the first seventeen chapters.\n\nThe aims which the authoress seems always to have kept in view are\nrevealed to us at some length by the mouth of her hero: \"ordinary\nhistories,\" he is made to say, \"are the mere records of events, and\nare generally treated in a one-sided manner. They give no insight into\nthe true state of society. This, however, is the very sphere on which\nromances principally dwell. Romances,\" he continues, \"are indeed\nfictions, but they are by no means always pure inventions; their only\npeculiarities being these, that in them the writers often trace out,\namong numerous real characters, the best, when they wish to represent\nthe good, and the oddest, when they wish to amuse.\"\n\nFrom these remarks we can plainly see that our authoress fully\nunderstood the true vocation of a romance writer, and has successfully\nrealized the conception in her writings.\n\nThe period to which her story relates is supposed to be the earlier\npart of the tenth century after Christ, a time contemporary with her\nown life. For some centuries before this period, our country had made\na signal progress in civilization by its own internal development, and\nby the external influence of the enlightenment of China, with whom we\nhad had for some time considerable intercourse. No country could have\nbeen happier than was ours at this epoch. It enjoyed perfect\ntranquillity, being alike free from all fears of foreign invasion and\ndomestic commotions. Such a state of things, however, could not\ncontinue long without producing some evils; and we can hardly be\nsurprised to find that the Imperial capital became a sort of centre of\ncomparative luxury and idleness. Society lost sight, to a great\nextent, of true morality, and the effeminacy of the people constituted\nthe chief feature of the age. Men were ever ready to carry on\nsentimental adventures whenever they found opportunities, and the\nladies of the time were not disposed to disencourage them altogether.\nThe Court was the focus of society, and the utmost ambition of ladies\nof some birth was to be introduced there. As to the state of politics,\nthe Emperor, it is true, reigned; but all the real power was\nmonopolized by members of the Fujiwara families. These, again, vied\namong themselves for the possession of this power, and their daughters\nwere generally used as political instruments, since almost all the\nRoyal consorts were taken from some of these families. The abdication\nof an emperor was a common event, and arose chiefly from the intrigues\nof these same families, although partly from the prevailing influence\nof Buddhism over the public mind.\n\nSuch, then, was the condition of society at the time when the\nauthoress, Murasaki Shikib, lived; and such was the sphere of her\nlabors, a description of which she was destined to hand down to\nposterity by her writings. In fact, there is no better history than\nher story, which so vividly illustrates the society of her time. True\nit is that she openly declares in one passage of her story that\npolitics are not matters which women are supposed to understand; yet,\nwhen we carefully study her writings, we can scarcely fail to\nrecognize her work as a partly political one. This fact becomes more\nvividly interesting when we consider that the unsatisfactory\nconditions of both the state and society soon brought about a grievous\nweakening of the Imperial authority, and opened wide the gate for the\nascendency of the military class. This was followed by the systematic\nformation of feudalism, which, for some seven centuries, totally\nchanged the face of Japan. For from the first ascendency of this\nmilitary system down to our own days everything in society--ambitions,\nhonors, the very temperament and daily pursuits of men, and political\ninstitutes themselves--became thoroughly unlike those of which our\nauthoress was an eye-witness. I may almost say that for several\ncenturies Japan never recovered the ancient civilization which she had\nonce attained and lost.\n\nAnother merit of the work consists in its having been written in pure\nclassical Japanese; and here it may be mentioned that we had once made\na remarkable progress in our own language quite independently of any\nforeign influence, and that when the native literature was at first\nfounded, its language was identical with that spoken. Though the\npredominance of Chinese studies had arrested the progress of the\nnative literature, it was still extant at the time, and even for some\ntime after the date of our authoress. But with the ascendency of the\nmilitary class, the neglect of all literature became for centuries\nuniversal. The little that has been preserved is an almost unreadable\nchaos of mixed Chinese and Japanese. Thus a gulf gradually opened\nbetween the spoken and the written language. It has been only during\nthe last two hundred and fifty years that our country has once more\nenjoyed a long continuance of peace, and has once more renewed its\ninterest in literature. Still Chinese has occupied the front rank, and\nalmost monopolized attention. It is true that within the last sixty or\nseventy years numerous works of fiction of different schools have been\nproduced, mostly in the native language, and that these, when judged\nas stories, generally excel in their plots those of the classical\nperiod. The status, however, of these writers has never been\nrecognized by the public, nor have they enjoyed the same degree of\nhonor as scholars of a different description. Their style of\ncomposition, moreover, has never reached the same degree of refinement\nwhich distinguished the ancient works. This last is a strong reason\nfor our appreciation of true classical works such as that of our\nauthoress.\n\nAgain, the concise description of scenery, the elegance of which it is\nalmost impossible to render with due force in another language, and\nthe true and delicate touches of human nature which everywhere abound\nin the work, especially in the long dialogue in Chapter II, are almost\nmarvellous when we consider the sex of the writer, and the early\nperiod when she wrote.\n\nYet this work affords fair ground for criticism. The thread of her\nstory is often diffuse and somewhat disjointed, a fault probably due\nto the fact that she had more flights of imagination than power of\nequal and systematic condensation: she having been often carried away\nby that imagination from points where she ought to have rested. But,\non the other hand, in most parts the dialogue is scanty, which might\nhave been prolonged to considerable advantage, if it had been framed\non models of modern composition. The work, also, is too voluminous.\n\nIn translating I have cut out several passages which appeared\nsuperfluous, though nothing has been added to the original.\n\nThe authoress has been by no means exact in following the order of\ndates, though this appears to have proceeded from her endeavor to\ncomplete each distinctive group of ideas in each particular chapter.\nIn fact she had even left the chapters unnumbered, simply contenting\nherself with a brief heading, after which each is now called, such as\n\"Chapter Kiri-Tsubo,\" etc., so that the numbering has been undertaken\nby the translator for the convenience of the reader. It has no\nextraordinarily intricate plot like those which excite the readers of\nthe sensational romances of the modern western style. It has many\nheroines, but only one hero, and this comes no doubt from the peculiar\npurpose of the writer to portray different varieties and shades of\nfemale characters at once, as is shadowed in Chapter II, and also to\ndisplay the intense fickleness and selfishness of man.\n\nI notice these points beforehand in order to prepare the reader for\nthe more salient faults of the work. On the whole my principal object\nis not so much to amuse my readers as to present them with a study of\nhuman nature, and to give them information on the history of the\nsocial and political condition of my native country nearly a thousand\nyears ago. They will be able to compare it with the condition of\nmedi\u00c3\u00a6val and modern Europe.\n\nAnother peculiarity of the work to which I would draw attention is\nthat, with few exceptions, it does not give proper names to the\npersonages introduced; for the male characters official titles are\ngenerally employed, and to the principal female ones some appellation\ntaken from an incident belonging to the history of each; for instance,\na girl is named Violet because the hero once compared her to that\nflower, while another is called Y\u00c3\u00bbgao because she was found in a\nhumble dwelling where the flowers of the Y\u00c3\u00bbgao covered the hedges with\na mantle of blossom.\n\nI have now only to add that the translation is, perhaps, not always\nidiomatic, though in this matter I have availed myself of some\nvaluable assistance, for which I feel most thankful.\n\nSUYEMATZ KENCHIO.\n\n_Tokyo, Japan._\n\nFOOTNOTES:\n\n[Footnote 1: Which means, \"The Romance of Genji.\"]\n\n\n\n\nGENJI MONOGATARI\n\nCHAPTER I\n\nTHE CHAMBER OF KIRI[2]\n\n\nIn the reign of a certain Emperor, whose name is unknown to us, there\nwas, among the Niogo[76] and K\u00c3\u00b4yi[3] of the Imperial Court, one who,\nthough she was not of high birth, enjoyed the full tide of Royal\nfavor. Hence her superiors, each one of whom had always been\nthinking--\"I shall be the _one_,\" gazed upon her disdainfully with\nmalignant eyes, and her equals and inferiors were more indignant\nstill.\n\nSuch being the state of affairs, the anxiety which she had to endure\nwas great and constant, and this was probably the reason why her\nhealth was at last so much affected, that she was often compelled to\nabsent herself from Court, and to retire to the residence of her\nmother.\n\nHer father, who was a Dainagon,[4] was dead; but her mother, being a\nwoman of good sense, gave her every possible guidance in the due\nperformance of Court ceremony, so that in this respect she seemed but\nlittle different from those whose fathers and mothers were still alive\nto bring them before public notice, yet, nevertheless, her\nfriendliness made her oftentimes feel very diffident from the want of\nany patron of influence.\n\nThese circumstances, however, only tended to make the favor shown to\nher by the Emperor wax warmer and warmer, and it was even shown to\nsuch an extent as to become a warning to after-generations. There had\nbeen instances in China in which favoritism such as this had caused\nnational disturbance and disaster; and thus the matter became a\nsubject of public animadversion, and it seemed not improbable that\npeople would begin to allude even to the example of Y\u00c3\u00b4-ki-hi.[5]\n\nIn due course, and in consequence, we may suppose, of the Divine\nblessing on the sincerity of their affection, a jewel of a little\nprince was born to her. The first prince who had been born to the\nEmperor was the child of Koki-den-Niogo,[6] the daughter of the\nUdaijin (a great officer of State). Not only was he first in point of\nage, but his influence on his mother's side was so great that public\nopinion had almost unanimously fixed upon him as heir-apparent. Of\nthis the Emperor was fully conscious, and he only regarded the\nnew-born child with that affection which one lavishes on a domestic\nfavorite. Nevertheless, the mother of the first prince had, not\nunnaturally, a foreboding that unless matters were managed adroitly\nher child might be superseded by the younger one. She, we may observe,\nhad been established at Court before any other lady, and had more\nchildren than one. The Emperor, therefore, was obliged to treat her\nwith due respect, and reproaches from her always affected him more\nkeenly than those of any others.\n\nTo return to her rival. Her constitution was extremely delicate, as we\nhave seen already, and she was surrounded by those who would fain lay\nbare, so to say, her hidden scars. Her apartments in the palace were\nKiri-Tsubo (the chamber of Kiri); so called from the trees that were\nplanted around. In visiting her there the Emperor had to pass before\nseveral other chambers, whose occupants universally chafed when they\nsaw it. And again, when it was her turn to attend upon the Emperor, it\noften happened that they played off mischievous pranks upon her, at\ndifferent points in the corridor, which leads to the Imperial\nquarters. Sometimes they would soil the skirts of her attendants,\nsometimes they would shut against her the door of the covered portico,\nwhere no other passage existed; and thus, in every possible way, they\none and all combined to annoy her.\n\nThe Emperor at length became aware of this, and gave her, for her\nspecial chamber, another apartment, which was in the K\u00c3\u00b4r\u00c3\u00b4-Den, and\nwhich was quite close to those in which he himself resided. It had\nbeen originally occupied by another lady who was now removed, and thus\nfresh resentment was aroused.\n\nWhen the young Prince was three years old the Hakamagi[7] took place.\nIt was celebrated with a pomp scarcely inferior to that which adorned\nthe investiture of the first Prince. In fact, all available treasures\nwere exhausted on the occasion. And again the public manifested its\ndisapprobation. In the summer of the same year the Kiri-Tsubo-K\u00c3\u00b4yi\nbecame ill, and wished to retire from the palace. The Emperor,\nhowever, who was accustomed to see her indisposed, strove to induce\nher to remain. But her illness increased day by day; and she had\ndrooped and pined away until she was now but a shadow of her former\nself. She made scarcely any response to the affectionate words and\nexpressions of tenderness which her Royal lover caressingly bestowed\nupon her. Her eyes were half-closed: she lay like a fading flower in\nthe last stage of exhaustion, and she became so much enfeebled that\nher mother appeared before the Emperor and entreated with tears that\nshe might be allowed to leave. Distracted by his vain endeavors to\ndevise means to aid her, the Emperor at length ordered a Te-gruma[8]\nto be in readiness to convey her to her own home, but even then he\nwent to her apartment and cried despairingly: \"Did not we vow that we\nwould neither of us be either before or after the other even in\ntravelling the last long journey of life? And can you find it in your\nheart to leave me now?\" Sadly and tenderly looking up, she thus\nreplied, with almost failing breath:--\n\n    \"Since my departure for this dark journey,\n      Makes you so sad and lonely,\n    Fain would I stay though weak and weary,\n      And live for your sake only!\"\n\n\"Had I but known this before--\"\n\nShe appeared to have much more to say, but was too weak to continue.\nOverpowered with grief, the Emperor at one moment would fain accompany\nher himself, and at another moment would have her remain to the end\nwhere she then was.\n\nAt the last, her departure was hurried, because the exorcism for the\nsick had been appointed to take place on that evening at her home, and\nshe went. The child Prince, however, had been left in the Palace, as\nhis mother wished, even at that time, to make her withdrawal as\nprivately as possible, so as to avoid any invidious observations on\nthe part of her rivals. To the Emperor the night now became black with\ngloom. He sent messenger after messenger to make inquiries, and could\nnot await their return with patience. Midnight came, and with it the\nsound of lamentation. The messenger, who could do nothing else,\nhurried back with the sad tidings of the truth. From that moment the\nmind of the Emperor was darkened, and he confined himself to his\nprivate apartments.\n\nHe would still have kept with himself the young Prince now motherless,\nbut there was no precedent for this, and it was arranged that he\nshould be sent to his grandmother for the mourning. The child, who\nunderstood nothing, looked with amazement at the sad countenances of\nthe Emperor, and of those around him. All separations have their\nsting, but sharp indeed was the sting in a case like this.\n\nNow the funeral took place. The weeping and wailing mother, who might\nhave longed to mingle in the same flames,[9] entered a carriage,\naccompanied by female mourners. The procession arrived at the cemetery\nof Otagi, and the solemn rites commenced. What were then the thoughts\nof the desolate mother? The image of her dead daughter was still\nvividly present to her--still seemed animated with life. She must see\nher remains become ashes to convince herself that she was really dead.\nDuring the ceremony, an Imperial messenger came from the Palace, and\ninvested the dead with the title of Sammi. The letters patent were\nread, and listened to in solemn silence. The Emperor conferred this\ntitle now in regret that during her lifetime he had not even promoted\nher position from a K\u00c3\u00b4yi to a Niogo, and wishing at this last moment\nto raise her title at least one step higher. Once more several tokens\nof disapprobation were manifested against the proceeding. But, in\nother respects, the beauty of the departed, and her gracious bearing,\nwhich had ever commanded admiration, made people begin to think of her\nwith sympathy. It was the excess of the Emperor's favor which had\ncreated so many detractors during her lifetime; but now even rivals\nfelt pity for her; and if any did not, it was in the Koki-den. \"When\none is no more, the memory becomes so dear,\" may be an illustration of\na case such as this.\n\nSome days passed, and due requiem services were carefully performed.\nThe Emperor was still plunged in thought, and no society had\nattractions for him. His constant consolation was to send messengers\nto the grandmother of the child, and to make inquiries after them. It\nwas now autumn, and the evening winds blew chill and cold. The\nEmperor--who, when he saw the first Prince, could not refrain from\nthinking of the younger one--became more thoughtful than ever; and, on\nthis evening, he sent Yugei-no Mi\u00c3\u00b4bu[10] to repeat his inquiries. She\nwent as the new moon just rose, and the Emperor stood and contemplated\nfrom his veranda the prospect spread before him. At such moments he\nhad usually been surrounded by a few chosen friends, one of whom was\nalmost invariably his lost love. Now she was no more. The thrilling\nnotes of her music, the touching strains of her melodies, stole over\nhim in his dark and dreary reverie.\n\nThe Mi\u00c3\u00b4bu arrived at her destination; and, as she drove in, a sense of\nsadness seized upon her.\n\nThe owner of the house had long been a widow; but the residence, in\nformer times, had been made beautiful for the pleasure of her only\ndaughter. Now, bereaved of this daughter, she dwelt alone; and the\ngrounds were overgrown with weeds, which here and there lay prostrated\nby the violence of the winds; while over them, fair as elsewhere,\ngleamed the mild lustre of the impartial moon. The Mi\u00c3\u00b4bu entered, and\nwas led into a front room in the southern part of the building. At\nfirst the hostess and the messenger were equally at a loss for words.\nAt length the silence was broken by the hostess, who said:--\n\n\"Already have I felt that I have lived too long, but doubly do I feel\nit now that I am visited by such a messenger as you.\" Here she paused,\nand seemed unable to contend with her emotion.\n\n\"When Naishi-no-Ske returned from you,\" said the Mi\u00c3\u00b4bu, \"she reported\nto the Emperor that when she saw you, face to face, her sympathy for\nyou was irresistible. I, too, see now how true it is!\" A moment's\nhesitation, and she proceeded to deliver the Imperial message:--\n\n\"The Emperor commanded me to say that for some time he had wandered in\nhis fancy, and imagined he was but in a dream; and that, though he was\nnow more tranquil, he could not find that it was only a dream. Again,\nthat there is no one who can really sympathize with him; and he hopes\nthat you will come to the Palace, and talk with him. His Majesty said\nalso that the absence of the Prince made him anxious, and that he is\ndesirous that you should speedily make up your mind. In giving me this\nmessage, he did not speak with readiness. He seemed to fear to be\nconsidered unmanly, and strove to exercise reserve. I could not help\nexperiencing sympathy with him, and hurried away here, almost fearing\nthat, perhaps, I had not quite caught his full meaning.\"\n\nSo saying, she presented to her a letter from the Emperor. The lady's\nsight was dim and indistinct. Taking it, therefore, to the lamp, she\nsaid, \"Perhaps the light will help me to decipher,\" and then read as\nfollows, much in unison with the oral message: \"I thought that time\nonly would assuage my grief; but time only brings before me more\nvividly my recollection of the lost one. Yet, it is inevitable. How is\nmy boy? Of him, too, I am always thinking. Time once was when we both\nhoped to bring him up together. May he still be to you a memento of\nhis mother!\"\n\nSuch was the brief outline of the letter, and it contained the\nfollowing:--\n\n    \"The sound of the wind is dull and drear\n      Across Miyagi's[11] dewy lea,\n    And makes me mourn for the motherless deer\n      That sleeps beneath the Hagi tree.\"\n\nShe put gently the letter aside, and said, \"Life and the world are\nirksome to me; and you can see, then, how reluctantly I should present\nmyself at the Palace. I cannot go myself, though it is painful to me\nto seem to neglect the honored command. As for the little Prince, I\nknow not why he thought of it, but he seems quite willing to go. This\nis very natural. Please to inform his Majesty that this is our\nposition. Very possibly, when one remembers the birth of the young\nPrince, it would not be well for him to spend too much of his time as\nhe does now.\"\n\nThen she wrote quickly a short answer, and handed it to the Mi\u00c3\u00b4bu. At\nthis time her grandson was sleeping soundly.\n\n\"I should like to see the boy awake, and to tell the Emperor all about\nhim, but he will already be impatiently awaiting my return,\" said the\nmessenger. And she prepared to depart.\n\n\"It would be a relief to me to tell you how a mother laments over her\ndeparted child. Visit me, then, sometimes, if you can, as a friend,\nwhen you are not engaged or pressed for time. Formerly, when you came\nhere, your visit was ever glad and welcome; now I see in you the\nmessenger of woe. More and more my life seems aimless to me. From the\ntime of my child's birth, her father always looked forward to her\nbeing presented at Court, and when dying he repeatedly enjoined me to\ncarry out that wish. You know that my daughter had no patron to watch\nover her, and I well knew how difficult would be her position among\nher fellow-maidens. Yet, I did not disobey her father's request, and\nshe went to Court. There the Emperor showed her a kindness beyond our\nhopes. For the sake of that kindness she uncomplainingly endured all\nthe cruel taunts of envious companions. But their envy ever deepening,\nand her troubles ever increasing, at last she passed away, worn out,\nas it were, with care. When I think of the matter in that light, the\nkindest favors seem to me fraught with misfortune. Ah! that the blind\naffection of a mother should make me talk in this way!\"\n\n\"The thoughts of his Majesty may be even as your own,\" said the Mi\u00c3\u00b4bu.\n\"Often when he alluded to his overpowering affection for her, he said\nthat perhaps all this might have been because their love was destined\nnot to last long. And that though he ever strove not to injure any\nsubject, yet for Kiri-Tsubo, and for her alone, he had sometimes\ncaused the ill-will of others; that when all this has been done, she\nwas no more! All this he told me in deep gloom, and added that it made\nhim ponder on their previous existence.\"\n\nThe night was now far advanced, and again the Mi\u00c3\u00b4bu rose to take\nleave. The moon was sailing down westward and the cool breeze was\nwaving the herbage to and fro, in which numerous _mushi_ were\nplaintively singing.[12] The messenger, being still somehow unready to\nstart, hummed--\n\n    \"Fain would one weep the whole night long,\n    As weeps the Sudu-Mushi's song,\n    Who chants her melancholy lay,\n    Till night and darkness pass away.\"\n\nAs she still lingered, the lady took up the refrain--\n\n    \"To the heath where the Sudu-Mushi sings,\n      From beyond the clouds[13] one comes from on high\n    And more dews on the grass around she flings,\n      And adds her own, to the night wind's sigh.\"\n\nA Court dress and a set of beautiful ornamental hairpins, which had\nbelonged to Kiri-Tsubo, were presented to the Mi\u00c3\u00b4bu by her hostess,\nwho thought that these things, which her daughter had left to be\navailable on such occasions, would be a more suitable gift, under\npresent circumstances, than any other.\n\nOn the return of the Mi\u00c3\u00b4bu she found that the Emperor had not yet\nretired to rest. He was really awaiting her return, but was apparently\nengaged in admiring the Tsubo-Senzai--or stands of flowers--which were\nplaced in front of the palaces, and in which the flowers were in full\nbloom. With him were four or five ladies, his intimate friends, with\nwhom he was conversing. In these days his favorite topic of\nconversation was the \"Long Regret.\"[14] Nothing pleased him more than\nto gaze upon the picture of that poem, which had been painted by\nPrince Teishi-In, or to talk about the native poems on the same\nsubject, which had been composed, at the Royal command, by Ise, the\npoetess, and by Tsurayuki, the poet. And it was in this way that he\nwas engaged on this particular evening.\n\nTo him the Mi\u00c3\u00b4bu now went immediately, and she faithfully reported to\nhim all that she had seen, and she gave to him also the answer to his\nletter. That letter stated that the mother of Kiri-Tsubo felt honored\nby his gracious inquiries, and that she was so truly grateful that she\nscarcely knew how to express herself. She proceeded to say that his\ncondescension made her feel at liberty to offer to him the\nfollowing:--\n\n    \"Since now no fostering love is found,\n      And the Hagi tree is dead and sere,\n    The motherless deer lies on the ground,\n      Helpless and weak, no shelter near.\"\n\nThe Emperor strove in vain to repress his own emotion; and old\nmemories, dating from the time when he first saw his favorite, rose up\nbefore him fast and thick. \"How precious has been each moment to me,\nbut yet what a long time has elapsed since then,\" thought he, and he\nsaid to the Mi\u00c3\u00b4bu, \"How often have I, too, desired to see the daughter\nof the Dainagon in such a position as her father would have desired to\nsee her. 'Tis in vain to speak of that now!\"\n\nA pause, and he continued, \"The child, however, may survive, and\nfortune may have some boon in store for him; and his grandmother's\nprayer should rather be for long life.\"\n\nThe presents were then shown to him. \"Ah,\" thought he, \"could they be\nthe souvenirs sent by the once lost love,\" as he murmured--\n\n    \"Oh, could I find some wizard sprite,\n      To bear my words to her I love,\n    Beyond the shades of envious night,\n      To where she dwells in realms above!\"\n\nNow the picture of beautiful Y\u00c3\u00b4-ki-hi, however skilful the painter may\nhave been, is after all only a picture. It lacks life and animation.\nHer features may have been worthily compared to the lotus and to the\nwillow of the Imperial gardens, but the style after all was Chinese,\nand to the Emperor his lost love was all in all, nor, in his eyes, was\nany other object comparable to her. Who doubts that they, too, had\nvowed to unite wings, and intertwine branches! But to what end? The\nmurmur of winds, the music of insects, now only served to cause him\nmelancholy.\n\nIn the meantime, in the Koki-Den was heard the sound of music. She who\ndwelt there, and who had not now for a long time been with the\nEmperor, was heedlessly protracting her strains until this late hour\nof the evening.\n\nHow painfully must these have sounded to the Emperor!\n\n    \"Moonlight is gone, and darkness reigns\n      E'en in the realms 'above the clouds,'\n    Ah! how can light, or tranquil peace,\n      Shine o'er that lone and lowly home!\"\n\nThus thought the Emperor, and he did not retire until \"the lamps were\ntrimmed to the end!\" The sound of the night watch of the right\nguard[15] was now heard. It was five o'clock in the morning. So, to\navoid notice, he withdrew to his bedroom, but calm slumber hardly\nvisited his eyes. This now became a common occurrence.\n\nWhen he rose in the morning he would reflect on the time gone by when\n\"they knew not even that the casement was bright.\" But now, too, he\nwould neglect \"Morning Court.\" His appetite failed him. The delicacies\nof the so-called \"great table\" had no temptation for him. Men pitied\nhim much. \"There must have been some divine mystery that predetermined\nthe course of their love,\" said they, \"for in matters in which she is\nconcerned he is powerless to reason, and wisdom deserts him. The\nwelfare of the State ceases to interest him.\" And now people actually\nbegan to quote instances that had occurred in a foreign Court.\n\nWeeks and months had elapsed, and the son of Kiri-Tsubo was again at\nthe Palace. In the spring of the following year the first Prince was\nproclaimed heir-apparent to the throne. Had the Emperor consulted his\nprivate feelings, he would have substituted the younger Prince for the\nelder one. But this was not possible, and, especially for this\nreason:--There was no influential party to support him, and, moreover,\npublic opinion would also have been strongly opposed to such a\nmeasure, which, if effected by arbitrary power, would have become a\nsource of danger. The Emperor, therefore, betrayed no such desire, and\nrepressed all outward appearance of it. And now the public expressed\nits satisfaction at the self-restraint of the Emperor, and the mother\nof the first Prince felt at ease.\n\nIn this year, the mother of Kiri-Tsubo departed this life. She may not\nimprobably have longed to follow her daughter at an earlier period;\nand the only regret to which she gave utterance, was that she was\nforced to leave her grandson, whom she had so tenderly loved.\n\nFrom this time the young Prince took up his residence in the Imperial\npalace; and next year, at the age of seven, he began to learn to read\nand write under the personal superintendence of the Emperor. He now\nbegan to take him into the private apartments, among others, of the\nKoki-den, saying, \"The mother is gone! now at least, let the child be\nreceived with better feeling.\" And if even stony-hearted warriors, or\nbitter enemies, if any such there were, smiled when they saw the boy,\nthe mother of the heir-apparent, too, could not entirely exclude him\nfrom her sympathies. This lady had two daughters, and they found in\ntheir half-brother a pleasant playmate. Every one was pleased to greet\nhim, and there was already a winning coquetry in his manners, which\namused people, and made them like to play with him. We need not allude\nto his studies in detail, but on musical instruments, such as the\nflute and the _koto_,[16] he also showed great proficiency.\n\nAbout this time there arrived an embassy from Corea, and among them\nwas an excellent physiognomist. When the Emperor heard of this, he\nwished to have the Prince examined by him. It was, however, contrary\nto the warnings of the Emperor Wuda, to call in foreigners to the\nPalace. The Prince was, therefore, disguised as the son of one\nUdaiben, his instructor, with whom he was sent to the K\u00c3\u00b4ro-Kwan, where\nforeign embassies are entertained.\n\nWhen the physiognomist saw him, he was amazed, and, turning his own\nhead from side to side, seemed at first to be unable to comprehend the\nlines of his features, and then said, \"His physiognomy argues that he\nmight ascend to the highest position in the State, but, in that case,\nhis reign will be disturbed, and many misfortunes will ensue. If,\nhowever, his position should only be that of a great personage in the\ncountry, his fortune may be different.\"\n\nThis Udaiben was a clever scholar. He had with the Corean pleasant\nconversations, and they also interchanged with one another some\nChinese poems, in one of which the Corean said what great pleasure it\nhad given him to have seen before his departure, which was now\nimminent, a youth of such remarkable promise. The Coreans made some\nvaluable presents to the Prince, who had also composed a few lines,\nand to them, too, many costly gifts were offered from the Imperial\ntreasures.\n\nIn spite of all the precautions which were taken to keep all this\nrigidly secret, it did, somehow or other, become known to others, and\namong those to the Udaijin, who, not unnaturally, viewed it with\nsuspicion, and began to entertain doubts of the Emperor's intentions.\nThe latter, however, acted with great prudence. It must be remembered\nthat, as yet, he had not even created the boy a Royal Prince. He now\nsent for a native physiognomist, who approved of his delay in doing\nso, and whose observations to this effect, the Emperor did not receive\nunfavorably. He wisely thought to be a Royal Prince, without having\nany influential support on the mother's side, would be of no real\nadvantage to his son. Moreover, his own tenure of power seemed\nprecarious, and he, therefore, thought it better for his own dynasty,\nas well as for the Prince, to keep him in a private station, and to\nconstitute him an outside supporter of the Royal cause.\n\nAnd now he took more and more pains with his education in different\nbranches of learning; and the more the boy studied, the more talent\ndid he evince--talent almost too great for one destined to remain in a\nprivate station. Nevertheless, as we have said, suspicions would have\nbeen aroused had Royal rank been conferred upon him, and the\nastrologists, whom also the Emperor consulted, having expressed their\ndisapproval of such a measure, the Emperor finally made up his mind to\ncreate a new family. To this family he assigned the name of Gen, and\nhe made the young Prince the founder of it.[17]\n\nSome time had now elapsed since the death of the Emperor's favorite,\nbut he was still often haunted by her image. Ladies were introduced\ninto his presence, in order, if possible, to divert his attention, but\nwithout success.\n\nThere was, however, living at this time a young Princess, the fourth\nchild of a late Emperor. She had great promise of beauty, and was\nguarded with jealous care by her mother, the Empress-Dowager. The\nNaishi-no-Ske, who had been at the Court from the time of the said\nEmperor, was intimately acquainted with the Empress and familiar with\nthe Princess, her daughter, from her very childhood. This person now\nrecommended the Emperor to see the Princess, because her features\nclosely resembled those of Kiri-Tsubo.\n\n\"I have now fulfilled,\" she said, \"the duties of my office under three\nreigns, and, as yet, I have seen but one person who resembles the\ndeparted. The daughter of the Empress-Dowager does resemble her, and\nshe is singularly beautiful.\"\n\n\"There may be some truth in this,\" thought the Emperor, and he began\nto regard her with awakening interest.\n\nThis was related to the Empress-Dowager. She, however, gave no\nencouragement whatever to the idea, \"How terrible!\" she said. \"Do we\nnot remember the cruel harshness of the mother of the Heir-apparent,\nwhich hastened the fate of Kiri-Tsubo!\"\n\nWhile thus discountenancing any intimacy between her daughter and the\nEmperor, she too died, and the princess was left parentless. The\nEmperor acted with great kindness, and intimated his wish to regard\nher as his own daughter. In consequence of this her guardian, and her\nbrother, Prince Hi\u00c3\u00b4b-Ki\u00c3\u00b4, considering that life at Court would be\nbetter for her and more attractive for her than the quiet of her own\nhome, obtained for her an introduction there.\n\nShe was styled the Princess Fuji-Tsubo (of the Chamber of Wistaria),\nfrom the name of the chamber which was assigned to her.\n\nThere was, indeed, both in features and manners a strange resemblance\nbetween her and Kiri-Tsubo. The rivals of the latter constantly caused\npain both to herself and to the Emperor; but the illustrious birth of\nthe Princess prevented any one from ever daring to humiliate her, and\nshe uniformly maintained the dignity of her position. And to her alas!\nthe Emperor's thoughts were now gradually drawn, though he could not\nyet be said to have forgotten Kiri-Tsubo.\n\nThe young Prince, whom we now style Genji (the Gen), was still with\nthe Emperor, and passed his time pleasantly enough in visiting the\nvarious apartments where the inmates of the palace resided. He found\nthe companionship of all of them sufficiently agreeable; but beside\nthe many who were now of maturer years, there was one who was still in\nthe bloom of her youthful beauty, and who more particularly caught his\nfancy, the Princess Wistaria. He had no recollection of his mother,\nbut he had been told by Naishi-no-Ske that this lady was exceedingly\nlike her; and for this reason he often yearned to see her and to be\nwith her.\n\nThe Emperor showed equal affection to both of them, and he sometimes\ntold her that he hoped she would not treat the boy with coldness or\nthink him forward. He said that his affection for the one made him\nfeel the same for the other too, and that the mutual resemblance of\nher own and of his mother's face easily accounted for Genji's\npartiality to her. And thus as a result of this generous feeling on\nthe part of the Emperor, a warmer tinge was gradually imparted both to\nthe boyish humor and to the awakening sentiment of the young Prince.\n\nThe mother of the Heir-apparent was not unnaturally averse to the\nPrincess, and this revived her old antipathy to Genji also. The beauty\nof her son, the Heir-apparent, though remarkable, could not be\ncompared to his, and so bright and radiant was his face that Genji was\ncalled by the public Hikal-Genji-no-Kimi (the shining Prince Gen).\n\nWhen he attained the age of twelve the ceremony of Gembuk[18] (or\ncrowning) took place. This was also performed with all possible\nmagnificence. Various _f\u00c3\u00aates_, which were to take place in public,\nwere arranged by special order by responsible officers of the\nHousehold. The Royal chair was placed in the Eastern wing of the\nSeiri\u00c3\u00b4-Den, where the Emperor dwells, and in front of it were the\nseats of the hero of the ceremony and of the Sadaijin, who was to\ncrown him and to regulate the ceremonial.\n\nAbout ten o'clock in the forenoon Genji appeared on the scene. The\nboyish style of his hair and dress excellently became his features;\nand it almost seemed matter for regret that it should be altered. The\nOkura-Ki\u00c3\u00b4-Kurahito, whose office it was to rearrange the hair of\nGenji, faltered as he did so. As to the Emperor, a sudden thought\nstole into his mind. \"Ah! could his mother but have lived to have seen\nhim now!\" This thought, however, he at once suppressed. After he had\nbeen crowned the Prince withdrew to a dressing-room, where he attired\nhimself in the full robes of manhood. Then descending to the\nCourt-yard he performed a measured dance in grateful acknowledgment.\nThis he did with so much grace and skill that all present were filled\nwith admiration; and his beauty, which some feared might be lessened,\nseemed only more remarkable from the change. And the Emperor, who had\nbefore tried to resist them, now found old memories irresistible.\n\nSadaijin had by his wife, who was a Royal Princess, an only daughter.\nThe Heir-apparent had taken some notice of her, but her father did not\nencourage him. He had, on the other hand, some idea of Genji, and had\nsounded the Emperor on the subject. He regarded the idea with favor,\nand especially on the ground that such a union would be of advantage\nto Genji, who had not yet any influential supporters.\n\nNow all the Court and the distinguished visitors were assembled in the\npalace, where a great festival was held; Genji occupied a seat next to\nthat of the Royal Princess. During the entertainment Sadaijin\nwhispered something several times into his ear, but he was too young\nand diffident to make any answer.\n\nSadaijin was now summoned before the da\u00c3\u00afs of the Emperor, and,\naccording to custom, an Imperial gift, a white \u00c3\u0094-Uchiki (grand robe),\nand a suit of silk vestments were presented to him by a lady. Then\nproffering his own wine-cup, the Emperor addressed him thus:--\n\n    \"In the first hair-knot[19] of youth,\n    Let love that lasts for age be bound!\"\n\nThis evidently implied an idea of matrimony. Sadaijin feigned surprise\nand responded:--\n\n    \"Aye! if the purple[20] of the cord,\n    I bound so anxiously, endure!\"\n\nHe then descended into the Court-yard, and gave expression to his\nthanks in the same manner in which Genji had previously done. A horse\nfrom the Imperial stables and a falcon from the Kurand-Dokoro[21] were\non view in the yard, and were now presented to him. The princes and\nnobles were all gathered together in front of the grand staircase, and\nappropriate gifts were also presented to each one of them. Among the\ncrowd baskets and trays of fruits and delicacies were distributed by\nthe Emperor's order, under the direction of Udaiben; and more\nrice-cakes and other things were given away now than at the Gembuk of\nthe Heir-apparent.\n\nIn the evening the young Prince went to the mansion of the Sadaijin,\nwhere the espousal with the young daughter of the latter was\ncelebrated with much splendor. The youthfulness of the beautiful boy\nwas well pleasing to Sadaijin; but the bride, who was some years older\nthan he was, and who considered the disparity in their age to be\nunsuitable, blushed when she thought of it.\n\nNot only was this Sadaijin himself a distinguished personage in the\nState, but his wife was also the sister of the Emperor by the same\nmother, the late Empress; and her rank therefore was unequivocal. When\nto this we add the union of their daughter with Genji, it was easy to\nunderstand that the influence of Udaijin, the grandfather of the\nHeir-apparent, and who therefore seemed likely to attain great power,\nwas not after all of very much moment.\n\nSadaijin had several children. One of them, who was the issue of his\nRoyal wife, was the Kurand Shi\u00c3\u00b4shi\u00c3\u00b4.\n\nUdaijin was not, for political reasons, on good terms with this\nfamily; but nevertheless he did not wish to estrange the youthful\nKurand. On the contrary, he endeavored to establish friendly relations\nwith him, as was indeed desirable, and he went so far as to introduce\nhim to his fourth daughter, the younger sister of the Koki-Den.\n\nGenji still resided in the palace, where his society was a source of\nmuch pleasure to the Emperor, and he did not take up his abode in a\nprivate house. Indeed, his bride, Lady Aoi (Lady Hollyhock), though\nher position insured her every attention from others, had few charms\nfor him, and the Princess Wistaria much more frequently occupied his\nthoughts. \"How pleasant her society, and how few like her!\" he was\nalways thinking; and a hidden bitterness blended with his constant\nreveries.\n\nThe years rolled on, and Genji being now older was no longer allowed\nto continue his visits to the private rooms of the Princess as before.\nBut the pleasure of overhearing her sweet voice, as its strains flowed\noccasionally through the curtained casement, and blended with the\nmusic of the flute and _koto_, made him still glad to reside in the\nPalace. Under these circumstances he seldom visited the home of his\nbride, sometimes only for a day or two after an absence of five or six\nat Court.\n\nHis father-in-law, however, did not attach much importance to this, on\naccount of his youth; and whenever they did receive a visit from him,\npleasant companions were invited to meet him, and various games likely\nto suit his taste were provided for his entertainment.\n\nIn the Palace, Shigeisa, his late mother's quarters, was allotted to\nhim, and those who had waited on her waited on him. The private house,\nwhere his grandmother had resided, was beautifully repaired for him by\nthe Shuri Takmi--the Imperial Repairing Committee--in obedience to the\nwishes of the Emperor. In addition to the original loveliness of the\nlandscape and the noble forest ranges, the basin of the lake was now\nenlarged, and similar improvements were effected throughout with the\ngreatest pains. \"Oh, how delightful would it not be to be in a place\nlike that which such an one as one might choose!\" thought Genji within\nhimself.\n\nWe may here also note that the name Hikal Genji is said to have been\noriginated by the Corean who examined his physiognomy.\n\nFOOTNOTES:\n\n[Footnote 2: The beautiful tree, called Kiri, has been named Paulownia\nImperialis, by botanists.]\n\n[Footnote 3: Official titles held by Court ladies.]\n\n[Footnote 4: The name of a Court office.]\n\n[Footnote 5: A celebrated and beautiful favorite of an Emperor of the\nThang dynasty in China, whose administration was disturbed by a\nrebellion, said to have been caused by the neglect of his duties for\nher sake.]\n\n[Footnote 6: A Niogo who resided in a part of the Imperial palace\ncalled \"Koki-den.\"]\n\n[Footnote 7: The Hakamagi is the investiture of boys with trousers,\nwhen they pass from childhood to boyhood.

Indeed, he had many intrigues in his\nlifetime, and most of them are vividly preserved in our memories. He\nhad always striven to keep all these intrigues in the utmost secrecy,\nand had to appear constantly virtuous. This caution was observed to\nsuch an extent that he scarcely accomplished anything really romantic,\na fact which Katano-no-Shi\u00c3\u00b4shi\u00c3\u00b4[22] would have ridiculed.\n\nEven with such jealous watchfulness, secrets easily transpire from one\nto another; so loquacious is man! Moreover, he had unfortunately from\nnature a disposition of not appreciating anything within easy reach,\nbut of directing his thought in undesirable quarters, hence sundry\nimproprieties in his career.\n\nNow, it was the season of continuous rain (namely, the month of May),\nand the Court was keeping a strict Monoimi.[23] Genji, who had now\nbeen made a Chi\u00c3\u00bbji\u00c3\u00b4,[24] and who was still continuing his residence in\nthe Imperial Palace, was also confined to his apartments for a\nconsiderable length of time. His father-in-law naturally felt for him,\nand his sons were sent to bear him company. Among these, Kurand\nShi\u00c3\u00b4shi\u00c3\u00b4, who was now elevated to the post of T\u00c3\u00b4-no-Chi\u00c3\u00bbji\u00c3\u00b4, proved to\nbe the most intimate and interesting companion. He was married to the\nfourth daughter of the Udaijin, but being a man of lively disposition,\nhe, too, like Genji, did not often resort to the mansion of the bride.\nWhen Genji went to the Sadaijin's he was always his favorite\nassociate; they were together in their studies and in their sports,\nand accompanied each other everywhere. And so all stiffness and\nformality were dispensed with, and they did not scruple to reveal\ntheir secrets to each other.\n\nIt was on an evening in the above-mentioned season. Rain was falling\ndrearily. The inhabitants of the Palace had almost all retired, and\nthe apartment of Genji was more than usually still. He was engaged in\nreading near a lamp, but at length mechanically put his book aside,\nand began to take out some letters and writings from a bureau which\nstood on one side of the room. T\u00c3\u00b4-no-Chi\u00c3\u00bbji\u00c3\u00b4 happened to be present,\nand Genji soon gathered from his countenance that he was anxious to\nlook over them.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Genji; \"some you may see, but there may be others!\"\n\n\"Those others,\" retorted T\u00c3\u00b4-no-Chi\u00c3\u00bbji\u00c3\u00b4, \"are precisely those which I\nwish to see; ordinary ones, even your humble servant may have\nreceived. I only long to look upon those which may have been written\nby fair hands, when the tender writer had something to complain of, or\nwhen in twilight hour she was outpouring all her yearning!\"\n\nBeing so pressed, Genji allowed his brother-in-law to see them all. It\nis, however, highly probable that any very sacred letters would not\nhave been loosely deposited in an ordinary bureau; and these would\ntherefore seem, after all, to have been of second-rate importance.\n\n\"What a variety,\" said T\u00c3\u00b4-no-Chi\u00c3\u00bbji\u00c3\u00b4, as he turned them over, and he\nasked several questions guessingly about this or that. About some he\nguessed correctly, about others he was puzzled and suspicious.[25]\nGenji smiled and spoke little, only making some obscure remark, and\ncontinuing as he took the letters: \"but _you_, surely, must have\ncollected many. Will not you show me some? And then my bureau also may\nopen more easily.\"\n\n\"You do not suppose that I have any worth reading, do you?\" replied\nT\u00c3\u00b4-no-Chi\u00c3\u00bbji\u00c3\u00b4. \"I have only just now discovered,\" continued he, \"how\ndifficult it is to meet with a fair creature, of whom one can say,\n'This is, indeed, _the_ one; here is, at last, perfection.' There are,\nindeed, many who fascinate; many who are ready with their pens, and\nwho, when occasion may require, are quick at repartee. But how often\nsuch girls as these are conceited about their own accomplishments, and\nendeavor unduly to disparage those of others! There are again some who\nare special pets of their parents, and most jealously watched over at\nhome. Often, no doubt, they are pretty, often graceful; and frequently\nthey will apply themselves with effect to music and to poetry, in\nwhich they may even attain to special excellence. But then, their\nfriends will keep their drawbacks in the dark, and eulogize their\nmerits to the utmost. If we were to give full credence to this\nexaggerated praise, we could not but fail in every single instance to\nbe more or less disappointed.\"\n\nSo saying T\u00c3\u00b4-no-Chi\u00c3\u00bbji\u00c3\u00b4 paused, and appeared as if he were ashamed of\nhaving such an experience, when Genji smilingly remarked, \"Can any one\nof them, however, exist without at least one good point?\"\n\n\"Nay, were there any so little favored as that, no one would ever be\nmisled at all!\" replied T\u00c3\u00b4-no-Chi\u00c3\u00bbji\u00c3\u00b4, and he continued, \"In my\nopinion, the most and the least favored are in the same proportion. I\nmean, they are both not many. Their birth, also, divides them into\nthree classes. Those, however, who are especially well born, are often\ntoo jealously guarded, and are, for the most part, kept secluded from\nthe outside gaze, which frequently tends to make their deportment shy\nand timid. It is those of the middle class, who are much more\nfrequently seen by us, who afford us most chance of studying their\ncharacter. As for the lower class, it would be almost useless to\ntrouble ourselves with them.\"\n\nThus T\u00c3\u00b4-no-Chi\u00c3\u00bbji\u00c3\u00b4 appeared to be thoroughly at home in his\ndescription of the merits of the fair sex, which made Genji amused,\nand he said: \"But how do you define the classes you have referred to,\nand classify them into three? Those who are of high birth sink\nsometimes in the social scale until the distinction of their rank is\nforgotten in the abjectness of their present position. Others, again,\nof low origin, rise to a high position, and, with self-important faces\nand in ostentatious residences, regard themselves as inferior to none.\nInto what class will you allot _these_?\"\n\nJust at this moment the Sama-no-Kami[26] and T\u00c3\u00b4 Shikib-no-Ji\u00c3\u00b4[27]\njoined the party. They came to pay their respects to Genji, and both\nof them were gay and light-hearted talkers. So T\u00c3\u00b4-no-Chi\u00c3\u00bbji\u00c3\u00b4 now made\nover the discussion to them, and it was carried to rather questionable\nlengths.\n\n\"However exalted a lady's position may be,\" said Sama-no-Kami, \"if her\norigin is an unenviable one, the estimation of the public for her\nwould be widely different from that which it shows to those who are\nnaturally entitled to it. If, again, adverse fortune assails one whose\nbirth is high, so that she becomes friendless and helpless,\ndegradation here will meet our eyes, though her heart may still remain\nas noble as ever. Examples of both of these are very common. After\nmuch reflection, I can only come to the conclusion that both of them\nshould be included in the middle class. In this class, too, must be\nincluded many daughters of the Duri\u00c3\u00b4,[28] who occupy themselves with\nlocal administration. These ladies are often very attractive, and are\nnot seldom introduced at Court and enjoy high favor.\"\n\n\"And successes depend pretty much upon the state of one's fortune, I\nfancy,\" interrupted Genji, with a placid smile.\n\n\"That is a remark very unlikely to fall from the lips of a champion of\nromance,\" chimed in T\u00c3\u00b4-no-Chi\u00c3\u00bbji\u00c3\u00b4.\n\n\"There may be some,\" resumed Sama-no-Kami, \"who are of high birth, and\nto whom public respect is duly paid, yet whose domestic education has\nbeen much neglected. Of a lady such as this we may simply remark,\n'Why, and how, is it that she is so brought up?' and she would only\ncause discredit to her class. There are, of course, some who combine\nin themselves every perfection befitting their position. These best of\nthe best are, however, not within every one's reach. But, listen!\nWithin an old dilapidated gateway, almost unknown to the world, and\novergrown with wild vegetation, perchance we might find, shut up, a\nmaiden charming beyond imagination. Her father might be an aged man,\ncorpulent in person, and stern in mien, and her brothers of repulsive\ncountenance; but there, in an uninviting room, she lives, full of\ndelicacy and sentiment, and fairly skilled in the arts of poetry or\nmusic, which she may have acquired by her own exertions alone,\nunaided. If there were such a case, surely she deserves our\nattention, save that of those of us who themselves are highly exalted\nin position.\"\n\nSo saying, Sama-no-Kami winked slyly at Shikib-no-Ji\u00c3\u00b4. The latter was\nsilent: perhaps he fancied that Sama-no-Kami was speaking in the above\nstrain, with a hidden reference to his (Shikib's) sisters, who, he\nimagined, answered the description.\n\nMeantime, Genji may have thought, \"If it is so difficult to choose one\neven from the best class, how can--Ah!\" and he began to close his eyes\nand doze. His dress was of soft white silk, partly covered by the\n_naoshi_,[29] worn carelessly, with its cord left loose and untied.\nHis appearance and bearing formed quite a picture.\n\nMeanwhile, the conversation went on about different persons and\ncharacters, and Sama-no-Kami proceeded: \"It is unquestionable that\nthough at first glance many women appear to be without defects, yet\nwhen we come to the actual selection of any one of them, we should\nseriously hesitate in our choice.\n\n\"Let me illustrate my meaning by reference to the numerous public men\nwho may be aspiring to fulfil the duties of several important posts.\nYou will at once recognize the great difficulty there would be in\nfixing upon the individual statesman under whose guardianship the\nempire could best repose. And supposing that, if at last, by good\nfortune, the most able man were designated, even then we must bear in\nmind that it is not in the power of one or two individuals, however\ngifted they may be, to carry on the whole administration of the\nkingdom alone. Public business can only be tranquilly conducted when\nthe superior receives the assistance of subordinates, and when the\nsubordinate yields a becoming respect and loyalty to his superior, and\naffairs are thus conducted in a spirit of mutual conciliation. So,\ntoo, it is in the narrow range of the domestic circle. To make a good\nmistress of that circle, one must possess, if our ideal is to be fully\nrealized, many important qualifications. Were we to be constantly\nindulging in the severity of criticism, always objecting to this or\nthat, a perfect character would be almost unattainable. Men should\ntherefore bear with patience any trifling dissatisfaction which they\nmay feel, and strive constantly to keep alive, to augment, and to\ncherish, the warmth of their early love. Only such a man as this can\nbe called faithful, and the partner of such a man alone can enjoy the\nreal happiness of affection. How unsatisfactory to us, however, seems\nthe actual world if we look round upon it. Still more difficult must\nit be to satisfy such as you who seek your companions but from among\nthe best!\n\n\"How varied are the characters and the dispositions of women! Some who\nare youthful and favored by Nature strive almost selfishly to keep\nthemselves with the utmost reserve. If they write, they write\nharmlessly and innocently; yet, at the same time, they are choice in\ntheir expressions, which have delicate touches of bewitching\nsentiment. This might possibly make us entertain a suddenly conceived\nfancy for them; yet they would give us but slight encouragement. They\nmay allow us just to hear their voices, but when we approach them they\nwill speak with subdued breath, and almost inaudibly. Beware, however,\nlest among these you chance to encounter some astute artiste, who,\nunder a surface that is smooth, conceals a current that is deep. This\nsort of lady, it is true, generally appears quite modest; but often\nproves, when we come closer, to be of a very different temperament\nfrom what we anticipated. Here is one drawback to be guarded against.\n\n\"Among characters differing from the above, some are too full of\nsentimental sweetness--whenever occasion offers them romance they\nbecome spoilt. Such would be decidedly better if they had less\nsentiment, and more sense.\n\n\"Others, again, are singularly earnest--too earnest, indeed--in the\nperformance of their domestic duty; and such, with their hair pushed\nback,[30] devote themselves like household drudges to household\naffairs. Man, whose duties generally call him from home all the day,\nnaturally hears and sees the social movements both of public and\nprivate life, and notices different things, both good and bad. Of such\nthings he would not like to talk freely with strangers, but only with\nsome one closely allied to him. Indeed, a man may have many things in\nhis mind which cause him to smile or to grieve. Occasionally something\nof a political nature may irritate him beyond endurance. These matters\nhe would like to talk over with his fair companion, that she might\nsoothe him, and sympathize with him. But a woman as above described is\noften unable to understand him, or does not endeavor to do so; and\nthis only makes him more miserable. At another time he may brood over\nhis hopes and aspirations; but he has no hope of solace. She is not\nonly incapable of sharing these with him, but might carelessly remark,\n'What ails you?' How severely would this try the temper of a man!\n\n\"If, then, we clearly see all these, the only suggestion I can make is\nthat the best thing to do is to choose one who is gentle and modest,\nand strive to guide and educate her according to the best ideal we may\nthink of. This is the best plan; and why should we not do so? Our\nefforts would not be surely all in vain. But no! A girl whom we thus\neducate, and who proves to be competent to bear us company, often\ndisappoints us when she is left alone. She may then show her\nincapability, and her occasional actions may be done in such an\nunbecoming manner that both good and bad are equally displeasing. Are\nnot all these against us men?--Remember, however, that there are some\nwho may not be very agreeable at ordinary times, yet who flash\noccasionally upon us with a potent and almost irresistible charm.\"\n\nThus Sama-no-Kami, though eloquent, not having come to one point or\nanother, remained thoughtful for some minutes, and again resumed:--\n\n\"After all, as I have once observed, I can only make this suggestion:\nThat we should not too much consider either birth or beauty, but\nselect one who is gentle and tranquil, and consider her to be best\nsuited for our last haven of rest. If, in addition, she is of fair\nposition, and is blessed with sweetness of temper, we should be\ndelighted with her, and not trouble ourselves to search or notice any\ntrifling deficiency. And the more so as, if her conscience is clear\nand pure, calmness and serenity of features can naturally be looked\nfor.\n\n\"There are women who are too diffident, and too reserved, and carry\ntheir generosity to such an extent as to pretend not to be aware even\nof such annoyances as afford them just grounds of complaint. A time\narrives when their sorrows and anxieties become greater than they can\nbear. Even then, however, they cannot resort to plain speaking, and\ncomplain. But, instead thereof, they will fly away to some remote\nretreat among the mountain hamlets, or to some secluded spot by the\nseaside, leaving behind them some painful letter or despairing verses,\nand making themselves mere sad memories of the past. Often when a boy\nI heard such stories read by ladies, and the sad pathos of them even\ncaused my tears to flow; but now I can only declare such deeds to be\nacts of mere folly. For what does it all amount to? Simply to this:\nThat the woman, in spite of the pain which it causes her, and\ndiscarding a heart which may be still lingering towards her, takes to\nflight, regardless of the feelings of others--of the anguish, and of\nthe anxiety, which those who are dearest to her suffer with her. Nay,\nthis act of folly may even be committed simply to test the sincerity\nof her lover's affection for her. What pitiable subtlety!\n\n\"Worse than this, the woman thus led astray, perhaps by ill advice,\nmay even be beguiled into more serious errors. In the depth of her\ndespairing melancholy she will become a nun. Her conscience, when she\ntakes the fatal vow, may be pure and unsullied, and nothing may seem\nable to call her back again to the world which she forsook. But, as\ntime rolls on, some household servant or aged nurse brings her tidings\nof the lover who has been unable to cast her out of his heart, and\nwhose tears drop silently when he hears aught about her. Then, when\nshe hears of his affections still living, and his heart still\nyearning, and thinks of the uselessness of the sacrifice she has made\nvoluntarily, she touches the hair[31] on her forehead, and she becomes\nregretful. She may, indeed, do her best to persevere in her resolve,\nbut if one single tear bedews her cheek, she is no longer strong in\nthe sanctity of her vow. Weakness of this kind would be in the eyes of\nBuddha more sinful than those offences which are committed by those\nwho never leave the lay circle at all, and she would eventually wander\nabout in the 'wrong passage.'[32]\n\n\"But there are also women, who are too self-confident and obtrusive.\nThese, if they discover some slight inconsistency in men, fiercely\nbetray their indignation and behave with arrogance. A man may show a\nlittle inconsistency occasionally, but yet his affection may remain;\nthen matters will in time become right again, and they will pass\ntheir lives happily together. If, therefore, the woman cannot show a\ntolerable amount of patience, this will but add to her unhappiness.\nShe should, above all things, strive not to give way to excitement;\nand when she experiences any unpleasantness, she should speak of it\nfrankly but with moderation. And if there should be anything worse\nthan unpleasantness she should even then complain of it in such a way\nas not to irritate the men. If she guides her conduct on principles\nsuch as these, even her very words, her very demeanor, may in all\nprobability increase his sympathy and consideration for her. One's\nself-denial and the restraint which one imposes upon one's self, often\ndepend on the way in which another behaves to us. The woman who is too\nindifferent and too forgiving is also inconsiderate. Remember 'the\nunmoored boat floats about.' Is it not so?\"\n\nT\u00c3\u00b4-no-Chi\u00c3\u00bbji\u00c3\u00b4 quickly nodded assent, as he said, \"Quite true! A woman\nwho has no strength of emotion, no passion of sorrow or of joy, can\nnever be holders of us. Nay even jealousy, if not carried to the\nextent of undue suspicion, is not undesirable. If we ourselves are not\nin fault, and leave the matter alone, such jealousy may easily be kept\nwithin due bounds. But stop\"--added he suddenly--\"Some women have to\nbear, and do bear, every grief that they may encounter with\nunmurmuring and suffering patience.\"\n\nSo said T\u00c3\u00b4-no-Chi\u00c3\u00bbji\u00c3\u00b4, who implied by this allusion that his sister\nwas a woman so circumstanced. But Genji was still dozing, and no\nremark came from his lips.\n\nSama-no-Kami had been recently made a doctor of literature, and (like\na bird) was inflating his feathers, so T\u00c3\u00b4-no-Chi\u00c3\u00bbji\u00c3\u00b4, willing to draw\nhim out as much as possible, gave him every encouragement to proceed\nwith his discourse.\n\nAgain, therefore, he took up the conversation, and said, \"Call to your\nmind affairs in general, and judge of them. Is it not always true that\nreality and sincerity are to be preferred to merely artificial\nexcellence? Artisans, for instance, make different sorts of articles,\nas their talents serve them. Some of them are keen and expert, and\ncleverly manufacture objects of temporary fashion, which have no fixed\nor traditional style, and which are only intended to strike the\nmomentary fancy. These, however, are not the true artisans. The real\nexcellence of the true artisan is tested by those who make, without\ndefects or sensational peculiarities, articles to decorate, we will\nsay, some particular building, in conformity with correct taste and\nhigh \u00c3\u00a6sthetic principles. Look for another instance at the eminence\nwhich has been attained by several of the artists of the Imperial\nCollege of Painting. Take the case of draughtsmen in black ink.\nPictures, indeed, such as those of Mount Horai,[33] which has never\nbeen beheld by mortal eye, or of some raging monstrous fish in a rough\nsea, or of a wild animal of some far-off country, or of the imaginary\nface of the demon, are often drawn with such striking vividness that\npeople are startled at the sight of them. These pictures, however, are\nneither real nor true. On the other hand, ordinary scenery, of\nfamiliar mountains, of calm streams of water, and of dwellings just\nbefore our eyes, may be sketched with an irregularity so charming, and\nwith such excellent skill, as almost to rival Nature. In pictures such\nas these, the perspective of gentle mountain slopes, and sequestered\nnooks surrounded by leafy trees, are drawn with such admirable\nfidelity to Nature that they carry the spectator in imagination to\nsomething beyond them. These are the pictures in which is mostly\nevinced the spirit and effectiveness of the superior hand of a master;\nand in these an inferior artist would only show dulness and\ninefficiency.\n\n\"Similar observations are applicable to handwriting.[34] Some people\nboldly dash away with great freedom and endless flourishes, and appear\nat the first glance to be elegant and skilful. But that which is\nwritten with scrupulous neatness, in accordance with the true rules of\npenmanship, constitutes a very different handwriting from the above.\nIf perchance the upstrokes and downstrokes do not, at first sight,\nappear to be fully formed, yet when we take it up and critically\ncompare it with writing in which dashes and flourishes predominate, we\nshall at once see how much more of real and sterling merit it\npossesses.\n\n\"Such then is the nature of the case in painting, in penmanship, and\nin the arts generally. And how much more then are those women\nundeserving of our admiration, who though they are rich in outward and\nin fashionable display, attempting to dazzle our eyes, are yet\nlacking in the solid foundations of reality, fidelity, and truth! Do\nnot, my friends, consider me going too far, but let me proceed to\nillustrate these observations by my own experience.\"\n\nSo saying, Sama-no-Kami advanced his seat, and Genji awoke.\nT\u00c3\u00b4-no-Chi\u00c3\u00bbji\u00c3\u00b4 was quite interested in the conversation, and was\nkeeping his eye upon the speaker, leaning his cheek upon his hand.\nThis long discourse of Sama-no-Kami reminds us of the preacher's\nsermon, and amuses us. And it seems that, on occasions like these, one\nmay easily be carried away by circumstances, until he is willing to\ncommunicate even his own private affairs.\n\n\"It was at a time,\" continued Sama-no-Kami, \"when I was in a still\nmore humble position, that there was a girl to whom I had taken a\nfancy. She was like one of those whom I described in the process of my\ndiscourse; not a regular beauty. Although for this reason my youthful\nvanity did not allow me to pledge myself to her forever, I still\nconsidered her a pleasant companion. Nevertheless, from occasional\nfits of restlessness, I roamed often here and there. This she always\nresented fiercely, and with so much indignation that I sighed for a\nsweeter temper and more moderation. Indeed, there were times when her\nsuspicion and spitefulness were more than I could endure. But my\nirritation was generally calmed down, and I even felt sorry myself,\nwhen I reflected how strong and devoted her affection for me was, in\nspite of the mean state of my circumstances. As to her general\ncharacter, her only endeavor seemed to be to do everything for my\nsake, even what was beyond her powers, while she struggled to perfect\nherself in anything in which she might be deficient, and took the most\nfaithful care of all my interests, striving constantly and earnestly\nto please me. She appeared at first even too zealous, but in time\nbecame more moderate. She seemed as if she felt uneasy lest her plain\nface should cause me displeasure, and she even denied herself the\nsight of other people, in order to avoid unbecoming comment.\n\n\"As time went by, the more I became accustomed to observe how really\nsimple-hearted she was, the more I sympathized with her. The one thing\nthat I could not bear, however, was that jealousy of hers. Sincere and\ndevoted as she is, thought I, is there no means of ridding her of this\njealous weakness? Could I but do that, it would not matter even if I\nwere to alarm her a little. And I also thought that since she was\ndevoted to me, if I showed any symptoms of getting tired of her, she\nwould, in all probability, be warned by it. Therefore, I purposely\nbehaved to her with great coolness and heartlessness. This she\nresented as usual. I then said to her, that though our affection had\nbeen of old date, I should not see her again; 'if you wish to sever\nfrom me you may suspect me as much as you like. If you prefer to enjoy\nlong happiness with me in future, be modest and patient in trifling\nmatters. If you can only be so, how can I do otherwise than love you?\nMy position also may in time be improved, and then we may enjoy\ngreater happiness!'\n\n\"In saying this, I thought I had managed matters very ingeniously.\nWithout meaning it, however, I had in fact spoken a little too\nharshly. She replied, with a bitter smile, that 'to put up with a life\nof undistinguished condition, even though with faint hopes of future\npromotion, was not a thing about which we ought to trouble ourselves,\nbut that it was indeed a hard task to pass long wearisome days in\nwaiting until a man's mind should be restored to a sense of propriety.\nAnd that for this reason we had, perhaps, better separate at once.'\n\n\"This she said with such sarcastic bitterness that I was irritated and\nstung to the quick, and overwhelmed her with a fresh torrent of\nreproaches. At this juncture she gave way to an uncontrollable fit of\npassion, and snatching up my hand, she thrust my little finger into\nher mouth and bit off the end of it. Then, notwithstanding my pain, I\nbecame quite cool and collected, and calmly said, 'insulted and maimed\nas I have now been, it is most fitting that I should absent myself for\nthe future from polite society. Office and title would ill become me\nnow. Your spite has now left me without spirit to face the world in\nwhich I should be ridiculed, and has left me no alternative but to\nwithdraw my maimed person from the public gaze!' After I had alarmed\nher by speaking in this exalted strain, I added, 'to-day we meet for\nthe last time,' and bending these fingers (pointing to them as she\nspoke) I made the farewell remark:--\n\n    When on my fingers, I must say\n      I count the hours I spent with thee,\n    Is this, and this alone, I pray\n      The only pang you've caused to me?\n\nYou are now quits with me,' At the instant I said so, she burst into\ntears and without premeditation, poured forth the following:--\n\n    'From me, who long bore grievous harms,\n      From that cold hand and wandering heart,\n    You now withdraw your sheltering arms,\n      And coolly tell me, we must part.'\n\n\"To speak the truth, I had no real intention of separating from her\naltogether. For some time, however, I sent her no communication, and\nwas passing rather an unsettled life. Well! I was once returning from\nthe palace late one evening in November, after an experimental\npractice of music for a special festival in the Temple of Kamo. Sleet\nwas falling heavily. The wind blew cold, and my road was dark and\nmuddy. There was no house near where I could make myself at home. To\nreturn and spend a lonely night in the palace was not to be thought\nof. At this moment a reflection flashed across my mind. 'How cold must\nshe feel whom I have treated so coldly,' thought I, and suddenly\nbecame very anxious to know what she felt and what she was about. This\nmade me turn my steps towards her dwelling, and brushing away the snow\nthat had gathered on my shoulders I trudged on: at one moment shyly\nbiting my nails, at another thinking that on such a night at least all\nher enmity towards me might be all melted away. I approached the\nhouse. The curtains were not drawn, and I saw the dim light of a lamp\nreflected on the windows. It was even perceivable that a soft quilt\nwas being warmed and thrown over the large couch. The scene was such\nas to give you the notion that she was really anticipating that I\nmight come at least on such an evening. This gave me encouragement,\nbut alas! she whom I hoped to see was not at home. I was told she had\ngone to her parents that very evening. Previous to that time, she had\nsent me no sad verses, no conciliatory letter, and this had already\ngiven birth to unpleasant feelings on my part. And at this moment,\nwhen I was told that she had gone away, all these things seemed to\nhave been done almost purposely, and I involuntarily began to suspect\nthat her very jealousy had only been assumed by her on purpose to\ncause me to become tired of her.\n\n\"As I reflected what our future might be after such an estrangement as\nthis, I was truly depressed. I did not, however, give up all hope,\nthinking that she would not be so determined as to abandon me forever.\nI had even carefully selected some stuff for a dress for her. Some\ntime, however, passed away without anything particularly occurring.\nShe neither accepted nor refused the offers of reconciliation which I\nmade to her. She did not, it is true, hide herself away like any of\nthose of whom I have spoken before. But, nevertheless, she did not\nevince the slightest symptom of regret for her previous conduct.\n\n\"At last, after a considerable interval, she intimated to me that her\nfinal resolve was not to forgive me any more if I intended in future\nto behave as I had done before; but that, on the other hand, she\nshould be glad to see me again if I would thoroughly change my habits,\nand treat her with the kindness which was her due. From this I became\nmore convinced that she still entertained longings for me. Hence, with\nthe hope of warning her a little more, I made no expressions of any\nintention to make a change in my habits, and I tried to find out which\nof us had the most patience.\n\n\"While matters were in this state, she, to my great surprise, suddenly\ndied, perhaps broken-hearted.\n\n\"I must now frankly confess that she certainly was a woman in whom a\nman might place his confidence. Often, too, I had talked with her on\nmusic and on poetry, as well as on the more important business of\nlife, and I found her to be by no means wanting in intellect and\ncapability. She had too the clever hands of Tatyta-him\u00c3\u00a8[35] and\nTanabata.[36]\n\n\"When I recall these pleasant memories my heart still clings to her\nendearingly.\"\n\n\"Clever in weaving, she may have been like Tanabata, that is but a\nsmall matter,\" interposed T\u00c3\u00b4-no-Chi\u00c3\u00bbji\u00c3\u00b4, \"we should have preferred to\nhave seen your love as enduring as Tanabata's.[37] Nothing is so\nbeautiful as the brilliant dyes spread over the face of Nature, yet\nthe red tints of autumn are often not dyed to a color so deep as we\ndesire, because of the early drying of the dew, so we say, 'such is\nthe uncertain fate of this world,'\" and so saying, he made a sign to\nSama-no-Kami to go on with his story. He went on accordingly.\n\n\"About that time I knew another lady. She was on the whole a superior\nkind of person. A fair poetess, a good musician, and a fluent speaker,\nwith good enunciation, and graceful in her movements. All these\nadmirable qualities I noticed myself, and heard them spoken of by\nothers. As my acquaintance with her commenced at the time when I was\nnot on the best of terms with my former companion, I was glad to enjoy\nher society. The more I associated with her the more fascinating she\nbecame.\n\n\"Meanwhile my first friend died, at which I felt truly sorry, still I\ncould not help it, and I therefore paid frequent visits to this one.\nIn the course of my attentions to her, however, I discovered many\nunpleasant traits. She was not very modest, and did not appear to be\none whom a man could trust. On this account, I became somewhat\ndisappointed, and visited her less often. While matters were on this\nfooting I accidentally found out that she had another lover to whom\nshe gave a share of her heart.\n\n\"It happened that one inviting moonlight evening in October, I was\ndriving out from home on my way to a certain Dainagon. On the road I\nmet with a young noble who was going in the same direction. We\ntherefore drove together, and as we were journeying on, he told me\nthat 'some one might be waiting for him, and he was anxious to see\nher'; well! by and by we arrived at the house of my lady-love. The\nbright reflection of the waters of an ornamental lake was seen through\ncrevices in the walls; and the pale moon, as she shed her full\nradiance over the shimmering waves, seemed to be charmed with the\nbeauty of the scene. It would have been heartless to pass by with\nindifference, and we both descended from the carriage, without knowing\neach other's intention.\n\n\"This youth seems to have been 'the other one'; he was rather shy. He\nsat down on a mat of reeds that was spread beside a corridor near the\ngateway; and, gazing up at the sky, meditated for some moments in\nsilence. The chrysanthemums in the gardens were in full bloom, whose\nsweet perfume soothed us with its gentle influence; and round about us\nthe scarlet leaves of the maple were falling, as ever and anon they\nwere shaken by the breeze. The scene was altogether romantic.\n\n\"Presently, he took a flute out of his bosom and played. He then\nwhispered, 'Its shade is refreshing.'\n\n\"In a few minutes the fair one struck up responsively on a sweet-toned\n_wagon_ (a species of _koto_).\n\n\"The melody was soft and exquisite, in charming strains of modern\nmusic, and admirably adapted to the lovely evening. No wonder that he\nwas fascinated; he advanced towards the casement from which the sounds\nproceeded, and glancing at the leaves scattered on the ground,\nwhispered in invidious tones, 'Sure no strange footsteps would ever\ndare to press these leaves.' He then culled a chrysanthemum, humming,\nas he did so:--\n\n    'Even this spot, so fair to view\n      With moon, and Koto's gentle strain,\n    Could make no other lover true,\n      As me, thy fond, thy only swain.'\n\n\"'Wretched!' he exclaimed, alluding to his poetry; and then added,\n'One tune more! Stay not your hand when one is near, who so ardently\nlongs to hear you.' Thus he began to flatter the lady, who, having\nheard his whispers, replied thus, in a tender, hesitating voice:--\n\n    'Sorry I am my voice too low\n      To match thy flute's far sweeter sound;\n    Which mingles with the winds that blow\n      The Autumn leaves upon the ground.'\n\n\"Ah! she little thought I was a silent and vexed spectator of all this\nflirtation. She then took up a _soh_ (another kind of _koto_ with\nthirteen strings) and tuned it to a Banjiki key (a winter tune), and\nplayed on it still more excellently. Though an admirer of music, I\ncannot say that these bewitching melodies gave me any pleasure under\nthe peculiar circumstances I stood in.\n\n\"Now, romantic interludes, such as this, might be pleasant enough in\nthe case of maidens who are kept strictly in Court service, and whom\nwe have very little opportunity of meeting with, but even there we\nshould hesitate to make such a one our life companion. How much less\ncould one ever entertain such an idea in a case like my own? Making,\ntherefore, that evening's experience a ground of dissatisfaction I\nnever saw her more.\n\n\"Now, gentlemen, let us take into consideration these two instances\nwhich have occurred to myself and see how equally unsatisfactory they\nare. The one too jealous, the other too forward. Thus, early in life,\nI found out how little reliance was to be placed on such characters.\nAnd now I think so still more; and this opinion applies more\nespecially to the latter of the two. Dewdrops on the 'Hagi flower' of\nbeauty so delicate that they disappear as soon as we touch\nthem--hailstones on the bamboo grass that melt in our hand as soon as\nwe prick them--appear at a distance extremely tempting and attractive.\nTake my humble advice, however, and go not near them. If you do not\nappreciate this advice now, the lapse of another seven years will\nrender you well able to understand that such adventures will only\nbring a tarnished fame.\"\n\nThus Sama-no-Kami admonished them, and T\u00c3\u00b4-no-Chi\u00c3\u00bbji\u00c3\u00b4 nodded as usual.\nGenji slightly smiled; perhaps he thought it was all very true, and he\nsaid, \"Your twofold experience was indeed disastrous and irritating!\"\n\n\"Now,\" said T\u00c3\u00b4-no-Chi\u00c3\u00bbji\u00c3\u00b4, \"I will tell you a story concerning myself.\nIt was the evil fortune of Sama-no-Kami to meet with too much jealousy\nin one of the ladies to whom he might otherwise have given his heart;\nwhile he could feel no confidence in another owing to flirtations. It\nwas my hard lot to encounter an instance of excessive diffidence. I\nonce knew a girl whose person was altogether pleasing, and although I,\ntoo, had no intention, as Sama-no-Kami said, of forming an everlasting\nconnection with her, I nevertheless took a great fancy to her. As our\nacquaintance was prolonged, our mutual affection grew warmer. My\nthoughts were always of her, and she placed entire confidence in me.\nNow, when complete confidence is placed by one person in another, does\nnot Nature teach us to expect resentment when that confidence is\nabused? No such resentment, however, seemed under any circumstances to\ntrouble her. When I very seldom visited her, she showed no excitement\nor indignation, but behaved and looked as if we had never been\nseparated from each other. This patient silence was more trying to me\nthan reproaches. She was parentless and friendless. For this reason\nresponsibility weighed more heavily on me. Abusing her gentle nature,\nhowever, I frequently neglected her. About this time, moreover, a\ncertain person who lived near her, discovered our friendship, and\nfrightened her by sending, through some channel, mischief-making\nmessages to her. This I did not become aware of till afterwards, and,\nit seems, she was quite cast down and helpless. She had a little one\nfor whose sake, it appears, she was additionally sad. One day I\nunexpectedly received a bunch of Nadeshiko[38] flowers. They were from\nher.\"\n\nAt this point T\u00c3\u00b4-no-Chi\u00c3\u00bbji\u00c3\u00b4 became gloomy.\n\n\"And what,\" inquired Genji, \"were the words of her message?\"\n\n\"Sir! nothing but the verse,\n\n    Forgot may be the lowly bed\n      From which these darling flowerets spring,\n    Still let a kindly dew be shed,\n      Upon their early nurturing.\n\n\"No sooner had I read this than I went to her at once. She was gentle\nand sedate as usual, but evidently absent and preoccupied. Her eyes\nrested on the dew lying on the grass in the garden, and her ears were\nintent upon the melancholy singing of the autumn insects. It was as if\nwe were in a real romance. I said to her:--\n\n    When with confused gaze we view\n      The mingled flowers on gay parterre,\n    Amid their blooms of radiant hue\n      The Tokonatz,[39] my love, is there.\n\nAnd avoiding all allusion to the Nadeshiko flowers, I repeatedly\nendeavored to comfort the mother's heart. She murmured in reply:--\n\n    'Ah! Flower already bent with dew,\n      The winds of autumn cold and chill\n    Will wither all thy beauteous hue,\n      And soon, alas, unpitying kill.'\n\nThus she spoke sadly. But she reproached me no further. The tears came\ninvoluntarily into her eyes. She was, however, apparently sorry for\nthis, and tried to conceal them. On the whole she behaved as if she\nmeant to show that she was quite accustomed to such sorrows. I\ncertainly deeply sympathized with her, yet still further abusing her\npatience. I did not visit her again for some time; but I was\npunished. When I did so she had flown, leaving no traces behind her.\nIf she is still living she must needs be passing a miserable\nexistence.\n\n\"Now, if she had been free from this excessive diffidence, this apathy\nof calmness, if she had complained when it was necessary, with\nbecoming warmth and spirit, she need never have been a wanderer, and I\nwould never have abused her confidence. But, as I said before, a woman\nwho has no strength of emotion, no passionate bursts of sorrow or of\njoy, can never retain a dominion over us.\n\n\"I loved this woman without understanding her nature; and I am\nconstantly, but in vain, trying to find her and her little darling,\nwho was also very lovely; and often I think with grief and pain that,\nthough I may succeed in forgetting her, she may possibly not be able\nto forget me, and, surely, there must be many an evening when she is\ndisquieted by sad memories of the past.\n\n\"Let us now sum up our experiences, and reflect on the lessons which\nthey teach us. One who bites your finger will easily estrange your\naffection by her violence. Falseness and forwardness will be the\nreproach of some other, in spite of her melodious music and the\nsweetness of her songs. A third, too self-contained and too gentle, is\nopen to the charge of a cold silence, which oppresses one, and cannot\nbe understood.\n\n\"Whom, then, are we to choose? All this variety, and this perplexing\ndifficulty of choice, seems to be the common lot of humanity. Where,\nagain, I say, are we to go to find the one who will realize our\ndesires? Shall we fix our aspirations on the beautiful goddess, the\nheavenly Kichiji\u00c3\u00b4?[40] Ah! this would be but superstitious and\nimpracticable.\"\n\nSo mournfully finished T\u00c3\u00b4-no-Chi\u00c3\u00bbji\u00c3\u00b4; and all his companions, who had\nbeen attentively listening, burst simultaneously into laughter at his\nlast allusion.\n\n\"And now, Shikib, it is your turn. Tell us your story,\" exclaimed\nT\u00c3\u00b4-no-Chi\u00c3\u00bbji\u00c3\u00b4, turning to him.\n\n\"What worth hearing can your humble servant tell you?\"\n\n\"Go on; be quick; don't be shy; let us hear!\"\n\nShikib-no-Ji\u00c3\u00b4, after a little meditation, thus began:--\n\n\"When I was a student at the University, I met there with a woman of\nvery unusual intelligence. She was in every respect one with whom, as\nSama-no-Kami has said, you could discuss affairs, both public and\nprivate. Her dashing genius and eloquence were such that all ordinary\nscholars would find themselves unable to cope with her, and would be\nat once reduced to silence. Now, my story is as follows:--\n\n\"I was taking lessons from a certain professor, who had several\ndaughters, and she was one of them. It happened by some chance or\nother I fell much into her society. The professor, who noticed this,\nonce took up a wine-cup in his hand, and said to me, 'Hear what I sing\nabout two choices.'[41]\n\n\"This was a plain offer put before me, and thenceforward I endeavored,\nfor the sake of his tuition, to make myself as agreeable as possible\nto his daughter. I tell you frankly, however, that I had no particular\naffection for her, though she seemed already to regard me as her\nvictim. She seized every opportunity of pointing out to me the way in\nwhich we should have to steer, both in public and private life. When\nshe wrote to me she never employed the effeminate style of the\nKana,[42] but wrote, oh! so magnificently! The great interest which\nshe took in me induced me to pay frequent visits to her; and, by\nmaking her my tutor, I learned how to compose ordinary Chinese poems.\nHowever, though I do not forget all these benefits, and though it is\nno doubt true that our wife or daughter should not lack intelligence,\nyet, for the life of me, I cannot bring myself to approve of a woman\nlike this. And still less likely is it that such could be of any use\nto the wives of high personages like yourselves. Give me a lovable\nnature in lieu of sharpness! I quite agree with Sama-no-Kami on this\npoint.\"\n\n\"What an interesting woman she must have been,\" exclaimed\nT\u00c3\u00b4-no-Chi\u00c3\u00bbji\u00c3\u00b4, with the intention of making Shikib go on with his\nstory.\n\nThis he fully understood, and, making a grimace, he thus proceeded:--\n\n\"Once when I went to her after a long absence--a way we all have, you\nknow--she did not receive me openly as usual, but spoke to me from\nbehind a screen. I surmised that this arose from chagrin at my\nnegligence, and I intended to avail myself of this opportunity to\nbreak with her. But the sagacious woman was a woman of the world, and\nnot like those who easily lose their temper or keep silence about\ntheir grief. She was quite as open and frank as Sama-no-Kami would\napprove of. She told me, in a low clear voice, 'I am suffering from\nheartburn, and I cannot, therefore, see you face to face; yet, if you\nhave anything important to say to me, I will listen to you.' This was,\nno doubt, a plain truth; but what answer could I give to such a\nterribly frank avowal? 'Thank you,' said I, simply; and I was just on\nthe point of leaving, when, relenting, perhaps, a little, she said\naloud, 'Come again soon, and I shall be all right.' To pass this\nunnoticed would have been impolite; yet I did not like to remain there\nany longer, especially under such circumstances: so, looking askance,\nI said--\n\n     Here I am, then why excuse me, is my visit all in vain:\n     And my consolation is, you tell me, come again?\n\nNo sooner had I said this than she dashed out as follows with a\nbrilliancy of repartee which became a woman of her genius:--\n\n     'If we fond lovers were, and meeting every night,\n     I should not be ashamed, were it even in the light!'\n\n\"Nonsense, nonsense!\" cried Genji and the others, who either were, or\npretended to be, quite shocked. \"Where can there be such a woman as\nthat? She must have been a devil! Fearful! fearful!\" And, snapping\ntheir fingers with disapproving glances, they said, \"Do tell us\nsomething better--do give us a better story than that.\"\n\nShikib-no-Ji\u00c3\u00b4, however, quietly remarked: \"I have nothing else to\nrelate,\" and remained silent.\n\nHereupon a conversation took place to the following effect:--\n\n\"It is a characteristic of thoughtless people--and that, without\ndistinction of sex--that they try to show off their small\naccomplishments. This is, in the highest degree, unpleasant. As for\nladies, it may not, indeed, be necessary to be thorough master of the\nthree great histories, and the five classical texts; yet they ought\nnot to be destitute of some knowledge of both public and private\naffairs, and this knowledge can be imperceptibly acquired without any\nregular study of them, which, though superficial, will yet be amply\nsufficient to enable them to talk pleasantly about them with their\nfriends. But how contemptible they would seem if this made them vain\nof it! The Manna[43] style and pedantic phrases were not meant for\nthem; and, if they use them, the public will only say, 'would that\nthey would remember that they are women and not men,' and they would\nonly incur the reproach of being pedants, as many ladies, especially\namong the aristocracy, do. Again, while they should not be altogether\nunversed in poetical compositions, they should never be slaves to\nthem, or allow themselves to be betrayed into using strange\nquotations, the only consequence of which would be that they would\nappear to be bold when they ought to be reserved, and abstracted when\nvery likely they have practical duties to attend to. How utterly\ninappropriate, for instance, it would be on the May festival[44] if,\nwhile the attention of all present was concentrated on the solemnity\nof the occasion, the thoughts of these ladies were wandering on their\nown poetical imaginations about 'sweet flags;' or if, again, on the\nNinth-day festival,[45] when all the nobles present were exercising\ntheir inventive faculties on the subject of Chinese poems, they were\nto volunteer to pour forth their grand ideas on the dew-laid flowers\nof the chrysanthemum, thus endeavoring to rival their opponents of the\nstronger sex. There is a time for everything; and all people, but more\nespecially women, should be constantly careful to watch circumstances,\nand not to air their accomplishments at a time when nobody cares for\nthem. They should practise a sparing economy in displaying their\nlearning and eloquence, and should even, if circumstances require,\nplead ignorance on subjects with which they are familiar.\"\n\nAs to Genji, even these last observations seemed only to encourage his\nreverie still to run upon a certain one, whom he considered to be the\nhappy medium between the too much and the too little; and, no definite\nconclusion having been arrived at through the conversation, the\nevening passed away.\n\nThe long-continued rainy weather had now cleared up bright and fine,\nand the Prince Genji proceeded to the mansion of his father-in-law,\nwhere Lady Aoi, his bride, still resided with him. She was in her\nprivate suite of apartments, and he soon joined her there. She was\ndignified and stately, both in manners and demeanor, and everything\nabout her bore traces of scrupulous neatness.\n\n\"Such may be one of those described by Sama-no-Kami, in whom we may\nplace confidence,\" he thought, as he approached her. At the same time,\nher lofty queenliness caused him to feel a momentary embarrassment,\nwhich he at once tried to hide by chatting with the attendant maid.\nThe air was close and heavy, and he was somewhat oppressed by it. His\nfather-in-law happened to pass by the apartment. He stopped and\nuttered a few words from behind the curtain which overhung the door.\n\"In this hot weather,\" said Genji, in a low tone, \"what makes him come\nhere?\" and did not give the slightest encouragement to induce his\nfather-in-law to enter the room; so he passed along. All present\nsmiled significantly, and tittered. \"How indiscreet!\" exclaimed Genji,\nglancing at them reprovingly, and throwing himself back on a _ki\u00c3\u00b4-sok_\n(arm-stool), where he remained calm and silent.\n\nIt was, by no means, becoming behavior on the part of the Prince.\n\nThe day was drawing to an end when it was announced that the mansion\nwas closed in the certain celestial direction of the Naka-gami\n(central God).[46] His own mansion in Niji\u00c3\u00b4 (the one mentioned as\nbeing repaired in a previous chapter) was also in the same line of\ndirection.\n\n\"Where shall I go then?\" said Genji, and without troubling himself any\nfurther, went off into a doze. All present expressed in different\nwords their surprise at his unusual apathy. Thereupon some one\nreported that the residence of Ki-no-Kami, who was in waiting on the\nPrince, on the banks of the middle river (the River Ki\u00c3\u00b4gok) had lately\nbeen irrigated by bringing the stream into its gardens, making them\ncool and refreshing.\n\n\"That's very good, especially on such a close evening,\" exclaimed\nGenji, rousing himself, and he at once intimated to Ki-no-Kami his\ndesire of visiting his house. To which the latter answered simply,\n\"Yes.\" He did not, however, really like the Prince's visit, and was\nreluctantly telling his fellow attendants that, owing to a certain\ncircumstance which had taken place at Iyo-no-Kami's[47] residence, his\nwife (Ki-no-Kami's stepmother) had taken up her abode with him that\nvery evening, and that the rooms were all in confusion.\n\nGenji heard all this distinctly, but he would not change his mind, and\nsaid, \"That is all the better! I don't care to stay in a place where\nno fair statue dwells; it is slow work.\"\n\nBeing thus pressed, no alternative remained for the Ki-no-Kami, and a\nmessenger was despatched to order the preparation of apartments for\nthe Prince. Not long after this messenger had gone, Genji started on\nhis way to the house of Ki-no-Kami, whose mild objections against this\nquick proceeding were not listened to.\n\nHe left the mansion as quietly as possible, even without taking formal\nleave of its master, and his escort consisted of a few favorite\nattendants.\n\nThe \"eastern front room\" in the \"dwelling quarters\" was wide open, and\na temporary arrangement was made for the reception of the Prince, who\narrived there very quickly. The scene of the garden struck him before\nanything else. The surface of the lake sparkled with its glittering\nwaters. The hedges surrounded it in rustic beauty, and luxuriant\nshrubs grew in pleasing order. Over all the fair scene the breeze of\nevening swept softly, summer insects sang distinctly here and there,\nand the fireflies hovered about in mazy dances.\n\nThe escort took up its quarters in a position which overlooked the\nstream of water which ran beneath the corridor, and here began to take\ncups of _sak\u00c3\u00a9_. The host hastened to order also some refreshment to be\nprepared for Genji.\n\nThe latter was meanwhile gazing abstractedly about him, thinking such\na place might belong to the class which Sama-no-Kami fairly placed in\nthe middle category. He knew that the lady who was under the same roof\nwas a young beauty of whom he had heard something before, and he was\nlooking forward to a chance of seeing her.\n\nHe then noticed the rustling of a silken dress escaping from a small\nboudoir to the right, and some youthful voices, not without charm,\nwere also heard, mingled with occasional sounds of suppressed\nlaughter. The casement of the boudoir had been, until a short time\nbefore, open, but was pulled down by order of Ki-no-Kami, who,\nperhaps, doubted the propriety of its being as it was, and now only\nallowed a struggling light to issue through the paper of the \"sliding\nscreen!\" He proceeded to one side of his room that he might see what\ncould be seen, but there was no chance. He still stood there that he\nmight be able, at least, to catch some part of the conversation. It\nseems that this boudoir adjoined the general family room of the female\ninmates, and his ears were greeted by some faint talking. He inclined\nhis head attentively, and heard them whispering probably about\nhimself.\n\n\"Is it not a pity that the fate of so fine a prince should be already\nfixed?\" said one voice.\n\n\"Yet he loses no opportunity of availing himself of the favors of\nfortune,\" added another.\n\nThese remarks may have been made with no serious intention, but as to\nGenji, he, even in hearing them, could not help thinking of a certain\nfair image of which he so fondly dreamt. At the same time feeling a\nthrill on reflecting that, if this kind of secret were to be\ndiscovered and discussed in such a manner, what could be done.\n\nHe then heard an observation in delicate allusion to his verse which\nhe had presented to the Princess Momo-zono (peach-gardens) with the\nflowers of Asagao (morning-glory, or convolvulus).\n\n\"What _cautious_ beauties they are to talk in that way! But I wonder\nif their forms when seen will answer to the pictures of my fancy,\"\nthought Genji, as he retired to his original position, for he could\nhear nothing more interesting.\n\nKi-no-Kami presently entered the room, brought in some fruits, trimmed\nthe lamp, and the visitor and host now began to enjoy a pleasant\nleisure.\n\n\"What has become of the ladies? Without some of them no society is\ncheerful,\" observed Genji.\n\n\"Who can there be to meet such wishes?\" said the Ki-no-Kami to\nhimself, but took no notice of Genji's remark.\n\nThere were several boys in the house who had followed Ki-no-Kami into\nthe room. They were the sons and brothers of Ki-no-Kami. Among them\nthere was one about twelve or thirteen, who was nicer-looking than the\nothers. Genji, of course, did not know who they all were, and\naccordingly made inquiries. When he came to the last-mentioned boy,\nKi-no-Kami replied:--\n\n\"He is the youngest son of the late Lord Yemon, now an orphan, and,\nfrom his sister's connections, he is now staying here. He is shrewd\nand unlike ordinary boys. His desire is to take Court service, but he\nhas as yet no patron.\"\n\n\"What a pity! Is, then, the sister you mentioned your stepmother?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir, it is so.\"\n\n\"What a good mother you have got. I once overheard the Emperor, to\nwhom, I believe, a private application had been some time made in her\nbehalf, referring to her, said, 'What has become of her?' Is she here\nnow?\" said Genji; and lowering his voice, added, \"How changeable are\nthe fortunes of the world!\"\n\n\"It is her present state, sir. But, as you may perceive, it differs\nfrom her original expectation. Changeable indeed are the fortunes of\nthis world, especially so the fortunes of women!\"\n\n\"Does Iyo respect her? Perhaps he idolizes her, as his master.\"\n\n\"That is a question, perhaps, as a _private_ master. I am the foremost\nto disapprove of this infatuation on his part.\"\n\n\"Are you? Nevertheless he trusts her to such a one as you. He is a\nkind father! But where are they all?\"\n\n\"All in their private apartments.\"\n\nGenji by this time apparently desired to be alone, and Ki-no-Kami now\nretired with the boys. All the escort were already slumbering\ncomfortably, each on his own cool rush mat, under the pleasant\npersuasion of _sak\u00c3\u00a9_.\n\nGenji was now alone. He tried to doze, but could not. It was late in\nthe evening, and all was still around. His sharpened senses made him\naware that the room next but one to his own was occupied, which led\nhim to imagine that the lady of whom he had been speaking might be\nthere. He rose softly, and once more proceeded to the other side of\nthe room to listen to what he might overhear. He heard a tender voice,\nprobably that of Kokimi, the boy spoken of before, who appeared to\nhave just entered the room, saying:--\n\n\"Are you here?\"\n\nTo which a female voice replied, \"Yes, dear, but has the visitor yet\nretired?\" And the same voice added--\n\n\"Ah! so near, and yet so far!\"\n\n\"Yes, I should think so, he is so nice-looking, as they say.\"\n\n\"Were it daytime I would see him, too,\" said the lady in a drowsy\nvoice.\n\n\"I shall go to bed, too! But what a bad light,\" said the boy, and\nGenji conjectured that he had been trimming the lamp.\n\nThe lady presently clapped her hands for a servant, and said, \"Where\nis Chi\u00c3\u00bbji\u00c3\u00b4, I feel lonely, I wish to see her.\"\n\n\"Madam, she is in the bath now, she will be here soon,\" replied the\nservant.\n\n\"Suppose I pay my visit to her, too? What harm! no harm, perhaps,\"\nsaid Genji to himself. He withdrew the fastening of the intervening\ndoor, on the other side there was none, and it opened. The entrance to\nthe room where the lady was sitting was only screened by a curtain,\nwith a glimmering light inside. By the reflection of this light he saw\ntravelling trunks and bags all scattered about; through these he\ngroped his way and approached the curtain. He saw, leaning on a\ncushion, the small and pretty figure of a lady, who did not seem to\nnotice his approach, probably thinking it was Chi\u00c3\u00bbji\u00c3\u00b4, for whom she\nhad sent. Genji felt nervous, but struggling against the feeling,\nstartled the lady by saying:--\n\n\"Chi\u00c3\u00bbji\u00c3\u00b4 was called for, I thought it might mean myself, and I come to\noffer you my devoted services.\"\n\nThis was really an unexpected surprise, and the lady was at a loss.\n\n\"It is, of course, natural,\" he said, \"you should be astonished at my\nboldness, but pray excuse me. It is solely from my earnest desire to\nshow at such an opportunity the great respect for you which I have\nfelt for a very long time.\"\n\nHe was clever enough to know how to speak, and what to say, under all\ncircumstances, and made the above speech in such an extremely humble\nand insinuating manner that the demon himself could not have taken\noffence, so she forbore to show any sudden resentment. She had,\nhowever, grave doubts as to the propriety of his conduct, and felt\nsomewhat uncomfortable, saying shyly, \"Perhaps you have made a\nmistake!\"\n\n\"No, certainly not,\" he replied. \"What mistake can I have made? On the\nother hand, I have no wish to offend you. The evening, however, is\nvery irksome, and I should feel obliged if you would permit me to\nconverse with you.\" Then gently taking her hand he pressed her to\nreturn with him to his lonely apartment.\n\nShe was still young and weak, and did not know what was most proper to\ndo under these circumstances, so half yielding, half reluctantly was\ninduced to be led there by him.\n\nAt this juncture Chi\u00c3\u00bbji\u00c3\u00b4, for whom she had sent previously, entered\nthe room. Upon which Genji exclaimed \"Ha!\"\n\nChi\u00c3\u00bbji\u00c3\u00b4 stared with astonishment at him, whom she at once recognized\nas the Prince, by the rich perfume which he carried about him.\n\n\"What does this mean?\" thought Chi\u00c3\u00bbji\u00c3\u00b4. She could still do nothing.\nHad he been an ordinary personage she would have immediately seized\nhim. Even in that case, however, there was enough room to doubt\nwhether it would not have been better to avoid any violent steps lest\nit might have given rise to a disagreeable family scandal, hence\nChi\u00c3\u00bbji\u00c3\u00b4 was completely perplexed and mechanically followed them.\n\nGenji was too bold to fear bystanders, a common fault with high\npersonages, and coolly closed the door upon her saying, \"She will soon\nreturn to you.\"\n\nThe lady being placed in such an awkward position, and not knowing\nwhat Chi\u00c3\u00bbji\u00c3\u00b4 might imagine, became, as it were, bewildered. Genji was,\nhowever, as artful and insinuating as might be expected in consoling\nher, though we do not know where he had learnt his eloquence. This was\nreally trying for her, and she said, \"Your condescension is beyond my\nmerit. I cannot disregard it. It is, however, absolutely necessary to\nknow 'Who is who.'\"\n\n\"But such ignorance,\" he a little abashed, rejoined \"as not to know\n'Who is who,' is the very proof of my inexperience. Were I supposed to\nunderstand too well, I should indeed be sorry. You have very likely\nheard how little I mix in the world. This perhaps is the very reason\nwhy you distrust me. The excess of the blindness of my mind seems\nstrange even to myself.\"\n\nHe spoke thus insinuatingly. She, on her part, feared that if his\nfascinating address should assume a warmer tone it would be still\nmore trying for her and more difficult to withstand, so she\ndetermined, however hard she might appear, not to give any\nencouragement to his feelings, and showed therefore a coolness of\nmanner. To her meek character there was thus added a firm resolution,\nand it seemed like a young bamboo reed with its strength and\ntenderness combined, difficult to bend! Still she felt the struggle\nvery keenly, and tears moistened her eyes.\n\nGenji could not help feeling touched. Not knowing exactly how to\nsoothe her, he exclaimed, \"What makes you treat me so coolly? It is\ntrue we are not old acquaintances, but it does not follow that this\nshould prevent us from becoming good friends. Please don't discompose\nyourself like one who does not know the world at all: it pierces my\nheart.\"\n\nThis speech touched her, and her firmness began to waver.\n\n\"Were my position what it once was,\" said she, \"and I received such\nattention, I might, however unworthy, have been moved by your\naffection, but as my position in life is now changed, its\nunsatisfactory condition often makes me dream of a happiness I cannot\nhope to enjoy.\" Hereupon she remained silent for some moments, and\nlooked as if she meant to say that she could no longer help thinking\nof the line:--\n\n     Don't tell anyone you've seen my home.\n\nBut these few moments of silence agitated the pure waters of her\nvirtuous mind, and the sudden recollection of her aged husband, whom\nshe did not generally think much about, occurred tenderly to her\nmemory. She shuddered at the idea of his seeing her in such a dilemma\nas this, even in a dream, and without a word fled back to her\napartment, and Genji was once more alone.\n\nNow the chanticleer began to proclaim the coming day, and the\nattendants rose from their couches, some exclaiming \"How soundly we\nhave slept,\" others, \"Let us get the carriage ready.\"\n\nKi-no-Kami also came out saying, \"Why so early, no need of such hurry\nfor the Prince.\"\n\nGenji also arose, and putting on his _naoshi_, went out on a balcony\non the southern side of the house, where he leaned upon the wooden\nbalustrade and meditated as he looked round him.\n\nIt appears that people were peeping out of the casement on the western\nside, probably being anxious to catch a glimpse of the Prince, whose\nfigure was indistinctly to be seen by them from the top of a short\nscreen standing within the trellis. Among these spectators there was\none who perhaps might have felt a thrill run through her frame as she\nbeheld him. It was the very moment when the sky was being tinted by\nthe glowing streaks of morn, and the moon's pale light was still\nlingering in the far distance. The aspect of the passionless heavens\nbecomes radiant or gloomy in response to the heart of him who looks\nupon it. And to Genji, whose thoughts were secretly occupied with the\nevents of the evening, the scene could only have given rise to\nsorrowful emotions.\n\nReflecting how he might on some future occasion convey a message to\nthe lady, and looking back several times, he presently quitted the\nhouse and returned to the mansion of his father-in-law.\n\nDuring some days succeeding the above events, he was staying at the\nmansion with his bride. His thoughts, however, were now constantly\nturning to the lady on the bank of the middle river. He therefore\nsummoned Ki-no-Kami before him, and thus addressed him:--\n\n\"Cannot you let me have the boy, the son of the late Chi\u00c3\u00bbnagon[48]\nwhom I saw the other day? He is a nice lad, and I wish to have him\nnear at hand. I will also introduce him to the Emperor.\"\n\n\"I receive your commands. I will talk with his _sister_, and see if\nshe consents to it,\" replied Ki-no-Kami with a bow.\n\nThese last words alluding to the object which occupied his thoughts\ncaused Genji to start, but he said with apparent calmness--\n\n\"Has the lady presented you yet with a brother or a sister?\"\n\n\"No, sir, not yet; she has been married now these two years, but it\nseems she is always thinking she is not settled in the way her parents\ndesired, and is not quite contented with her position.\"\n\n\"What a pity! I heard, however, she was a very good lady. Is it so?\"\n\n\"Yes, I quite believe so; but hitherto we have lived separately, and\nwere not very cordial, which, as all the world knows, is usual in such\nrelationship.\"\n\nAfter the lapse of five or six days the boy Kokimi was brought to\nhim. He was not tall or handsome but very intelligent, and in manners\nperfectly well-bred. Genji treated him with the greatest kindness, at\nwhich, in his boyish mind, he was highly delighted. Genji now asked\nhim many questions about his sister, to which he gave such answers as\nhe could, but often with shyness and diffidence. Hence Genji was\nunable to take him into his confidence, but by skilfully coaxing and\npleasing him, he ventured to hand him a letter to be taken to his\nsister. The boy, though he possibly guessed at its meaning, did not\ntrouble himself much, but taking it, duly delivered it to his sister.\nShe became confused and thoughtful as she took it, and fearing what\nthe boy might think, opened the letter and held it before her face as\nshe read, in order to conceal the expression of her countenance.\n\nIt was a long one, and among other things contained the following\nlines:--\n\n    I had a dream, a dream so sweet,\n      Ah! would that I could dream again;\n    Alas, no sleep these eyes will greet,\n      And so I strive to dream in vain!\n\nIt was beautifully written, and as her eyes fell upon the passionate\nwords, a mist gathered over them, and a momentary thought of her own\nlife and position once more flashed over her mind, and without a word\nof comment to the boy, she retired to rest.\n\nA few days afterwards Kokimi was again invited to join the Prince.\nThereupon he asked his sister to give him an answer to the Prince's\nletter.\n\n\"Tell the Prince,\" she said, \"there is no one _here_ who reads such\nletters.\"\n\n\"But,\" said the boy, \"he does not expect such an answer as this! How\ncan I tell him so?\"\n\nAt first, she half-resolved to explain everything to Kokimi, and to\nmake him thoroughly understand why she ought not to receive such\nletters, but the effort was too painful, so she simply said, \"It is\nall the better for you not to talk in that way. If you think it so\nserious why should you go to him at all?\"\n\n\"Yet, how can I disobey his commands to go back?\" exclaimed the boy,\nand so he returned to Genji without any written answer to him.\n\n\"I was weary of waiting for you. Perhaps you, too, had forgotten me,\"\nsaid Genji, when he saw the boy, who was, however, silent and blushed.\n\"And what answer have you brought me?\" continued Genji, and then the\nboy replied in the exact words which his sister had used.\n\n\"What?\" cried Genji: and continued, \"Perhaps you may not know, so I\nwill tell you. I knew your sister before she knew Iyo. But she likes\nto treat me so because she thinks she has got a very good friend in\nIyo; but do you be like a brother to me. The days of Iyo will be\nprobably fewer than mine.\"\n\nHe now returned to the Palace taking Komini with him, and, going to\nhis dressing-room, attired him nicely in the Court style; in a word,\nhe treated him as a parent would do.\n\nBy the boy's assistance several more letters were conveyed to his\nsister. Her resolution, however, remained unshaken.\n\n\"If one's heart were once to deviate from the path,\" she reflected,\n\"the only end we could expect would be a damaged reputation and misery\nfor life: the good and the bad result from one's self!\"\n\nThus thinking, she resolved to return no answer. She might, indeed,\nhave admired the person of Genji, and probably did so, yet, whenever\nsuch feelings came into her mind, the next thought that suggested\nitself was, \"What is the use of such idle admiration?\"\n\nMeanwhile, Genji was often thinking of paying a visit to the house\nwhere she was staying, but he did not consider it becoming to do so,\nwithout some reasonable pretext, more especially as he would have been\nsorry, and for her sake more than his own, to draw a suspicion upon\nher.\n\nIt happened, however, after a prolonged residence at the Court, that\nanother occasion of closing the Palace in the certain celestial line\nof direction arrived. Catching at this opportunity he left the Palace,\nand suddenly turning out of his road, went straight to Ki-no-Kami's\nresidence, with the excuse that he had just discovered the above fact\non his way. Ki-no-Kami surprised at this unexpected visit, had only to\nbow before him, and acknowledge the honor of his presence. The boy,\nKokimi, was already there before him, having been secretly informed of\nhis intention beforehand, and he attended on him as usual in his\napartment on his arrival.\n\nThe lady, who had been told by her brother that the Prince earnestly\ndesired to see her, knew well how dangerous it was to approach an\ninviting flower growing on the edge of a precipice. She was not, of\ncourse, insensible to his coming in such a manner, with an excuse for\nthe sake of seeing her, but she did not wish to increase her dreamlike\ninquietude by seeing him. And again, if he ventured to visit her\napartment, as he did before, it might be a serious compromise for her.\n\nFor these reasons she retired while her brother was with Genji, to a\nprivate chamber of Chi\u00c3\u00bbji\u00c3\u00b4, her companion, in the rear of the main\nbuilding, under the pretence that her own room was too near that of\nthe Prince, besides she was indisposed and required \"Tataki,\"[49]\nwhich she desired to have done in a retired part of the house.\n\nGenji sent his attendants very early to their own quarters, and then,\nthrough Kokimi, requested an interview with the lady. Kokimi at first\nwas unable to find her, till after searching everywhere, he, at last,\ncame to the apartment of Chi\u00c3\u00bbji\u00c3\u00b4, and with great earnestness\nendeavored to persuade her to see Genji, in an anxious and half\ntrembling voice, while she replied in a tone slightly angry, \"What\nmakes you so busy? Why do you trouble yourself? Boys carrying such\nmessages are highly blamable.\"\n\nAfter thus daunting him, she added, more mildly, \"Tell the Prince I am\nsomewhat indisposed, and also that some friends are with me, and I\ncannot well leave them now.\" And she again cautioned the boy not to be\ntoo officious, and sent him away from her at once.\n\nYet, at the bottom of her heart, different feelings might have been\nstruggling from those which her words seemed to express, and some such\nthoughts as these shaped themselves to her mind: \"Were I still a\nmaiden in the home of my beloved parents, and occasionally received\nhis visits there, how happy might I not be? How trying to act as if no\nromantic sentiment belonged to my heart!\"\n\nGenji, who was anxiously waiting to know how the boy would succeed in\npersuading his sister, was soon told that all his efforts were in\nvain. Upon hearing this he remained for some moments silent, and then\nrelieved his feelings with a long-drawn sigh, and hummed:--\n\n    \"The Hahaki-gi[50] distant tree\n      Spreads broom-like o'er the silent waste;\n    Approach, how changed its shape we see,\n      In vain we try its shade to taste.\"\n\nThe lady was unable to sleep, and her thoughts also took the following\npoetic shape:--\n\n    Too like the Hahaki-gi tree,\n      Lonely and humble, I must dwell,\n    Nor dare to give a thought to thee,\n      But only sigh a long farewell.\n\nAll the other inmates of the house were now in a sound slumber, but\nsleep came not to Genji's eyes. He did, indeed, admire her immovable\nand chaste nature, but this only drew his heart more towards her. He\nwas agitated. At one moment he cried, \"Well, then!\" at another,\n\"However!\" \"Still!\" At last, turning to the boy, he passionately\nexclaimed, \"Lead me to her at once!\"\n\nKokimi calmly replied, \"It is impossible, too many eyes are around\nus!\"\n\nGenji with a sigh then threw himself back on the cushion, saying to\nKokimi, \"You, at least, will be my friend, and shall share my\napartment!\"\n\nFOOTNOTES:\n\n[Footnote 22: A hero of an older fiction, who is represented as the\nperfect ideal of a gallant.]\n\n[Footnote 23: A fast observed when some remarkable or supernatural\nevent took place, or on the anniversary of days of domestic\nmisfortune.]\n\n[Footnote 24: A general of the Imperial Guards.]\n\n[Footnote 25: Love letters generally are not signed or are signed with\na fancy name.]\n\n[Footnote 26: Left Master of the Horse.]\n\n[Footnote 27: Secretary to the Master of Ceremonies.]\n\n[Footnote 28: Deputy-governors of provinces.

I have\nnow discovered what the disappointment of the world means,\" he\nmurmured, while the boy Kokimi lay down beside him fast asleep. The\nsmallness of his stature, and the graceful waving of his short hair,\ncould not but recall to Genji the beautiful tresses of his sister, and\nbring her image vividly before him; and, long before the daylight\nappeared, he rose up, and returned to his residence with all speed.\nFor some time after this no communication took place between the lady\nand himself. He could not, however, banish her from his thoughts, and\nhe said to Kokimi that \"he felt his former experience too painful, and\nthat he strove to drive away his care; yet in vain; his thoughts would\nnot obey his wish, and he begged him, therefore, to seek some\nfavorable opportunity for him to see her.\" Kokimi, though he did not\nquite like the task, felt proud of being made his confidant, and\nthenceforward looked incessantly, with keen boyish eyes, for a chance\nof obliging him.\n\nNow, it happened that Ki-no-Kami went down to his official residence\nin his province, and only the female members of his family were left\nat home. \"This is the time,\" said Kokimi to himself, and went to\nGenji, and persuaded him to come with him. \"What can the boy do?\"\nthought Genji; \"I fear not very much, but I must not expect too much\";\nand they started at once, in Kokimi's carriage, so as to arrive in\ngood time.\n\nThe evening was darkening round them, and they drew up on one side of\nthe house, where few persons were likely to observe them. As it\nhappened to be Kokimi who had come, no fuss was made about his\narrival, nor any notice taken of it. He entered the house; and,\nleaving the Prince in the Eastern Hall, proceeded first into the inner\nroom. The casement was closed.\n\n\"How is it the casement is closed?\" he demanded of the servants. They\ntold him \"That the Lady of the West (Ki-no-Kami's sister, so called by\nthe domestics from her living to the westward of the house) was there\non a visit since noon, and was playing Go with his sister.\" The door\nby which the boy had entered the room was not entirely closed. Genji\nsoftly came up to it, and the whole interior of the apartment was\nvisible. He stood facing the west. On one side of the room was a\nfolding screen, one end of which was pushed back, and there was\nnothing besides to obstruct his view. His first glance fell on the\nfair figure of her of whom he had so fondly dreamt, sitting by a lamp\nnear a central pillar. She wore a dress of dark purple, and a kind of\nscarf thrown over her shoulders; her figure was slight and delicate,\nand her face was partly turned aside, as if she did not like to expose\nit even to her companions. Her hands were prettily shaped and tiny,\nand she used them with a gentle reserve, half covering them. Another\nlady, younger than herself, sat facing the east--that is, just\nopposite Genji--and was, therefore, entirely visible to him. She was\ndressed in a thin white silk, with a Ko-uchiki (outer vestment),\nworked with red and blue flowers, thrown loosely over it, and a\ncrimson sash round her waist. Her bosom was partly revealed; her\ncomplexion very fair; her figure rather stout and tall; the head and\nneck in good proportions, and the lips and eyelids lovely. The hair\nwas not very long, but reached in wavy lines to her shoulders.\n\n\"If a man had such a daughter, he might be satisfied,\" thought Genji.\n\"But perhaps she may be a little deficient in quietness. No matter how\nthis may be, she has sufficient attractions.\"\n\nThe game was drawing to a close, and they paid very little attention\nto Kokimi on his entrance. The principal interest in it was over; they\nwere hurrying to finish it. One was looking quietly at the board, and\nsaid, \"Let me see, that point must be Ji. Let me play the K\u00c3\u00b4h[51] of\nthis spot.\" The other saying, \"I am beaten; let me calculate,\" began\nto count on her fingers the number of spaces at each corner, at the\nsame time saying \"Ten! twenty! thirty! forty!\" When Genji came in this\nway to see them together, he perceived that his idol, in the matter of\npersonal beauty, was somewhat inferior to her friend. He was not,\nindeed, able to behold the full face of the former; yet, when he\nshifted his position, and fixed his gaze steadfastly upon her, the\nprofile became distinct. He observed that her eyelids were a little\nswollen, and the line of the nose was not very delicate. He still\nadmired her, and said to himself, \"But perhaps she is more\nsweet-tempered than the others\"; but when he again turned his eyes to\nthe younger one, strange to say the calm and cheerful smile which\noccasionally beamed in her face touched the heart of Genji; moreover,\nhis usual interviews with ladies generally took place in full\nceremony. He had never seen them in so familiar an attitude before,\nwithout restraint or reserve, as on the present occasion, which made\nhim quite enjoy the scene. Kokimi now came out, and Genji retired\nstealthily to one side of the door along the corridor. The former, who\nsaw him there, and supposed he had remained waiting in the place he\nhad left him all the while, apologized for keeping him so long, and\nsaid: \"A certain young lady is now staying here; I am sorry, but I did\nnot dare mention your visit.\"\n\n\"Do you mean to send me away again disappointed? How inglorious it\nis,\" replied Genji.\n\n\"No; why so? The lady may leave shortly. I will then announce you.\"\n\nGenji said no more. The ladies had by this time concluded their game,\nand the servants, who were about to retire to their own apartments,\ncried out, \"Where is our young master? we must close this door.\"\n\n\"Now is the time; pray take me there; don't be too late. Go and ask,\"\nsaid Genji.\n\nKokimi knew very well how hard was his task to persuade his sister to\nsee the Prince, and was meditating taking him into her room, without\nher permission, when she was alone. So he said, hesitatingly, \"Please\nwait a little longer, till the other lady, Ki-no-Kami's sister, goes\naway.\"\n\n\"Is Ki-no's sister here? So much the better. Please introduce me to\nher before she leaves,\" said Genji.\n\n\"But!\"\n\n\"But what? Do you mean that she is not worth seeing?\" retorted Genji;\nand would fain have told the boy that he had already seen her, but\nthought it better not to do so, and continued: \"Were we to wait for\nher to retire, it would become too late; we should have no chance.\"\n\nHereupon Kokimi determined to risk a little, and went back to his\nsister's room, rolling up a curtain which hung in his way. \"It is too\nwarm--let the air in!\" he cried, as he passed through. After a few\nminutes he returned, and led Genji to the apartment on his own\nresponsibility. The lady with the scarf (his sister), who had been for\nsome time fondly supposing that Genji had given up thinking about her,\nappeared startled and embarrassed when she saw him; but, as a matter\nof course, the usual courtesies were paid. The younger lady, however\n(who was free from all such thoughts), was rather pleased at his\nappearance. It happened that, when the eyes of the younger were turned\nin another direction, Genji ventured to touch slightly the shoulder of\nhis favorite, who, startled at the action rose suddenly and left the\nroom, on pretence of seeking something she required, dropping her\nscarf in her haste, as a cicada casts off its tender wingy shell, and\nleaving her friend to converse with the Prince. He was chagrined, but\ndid not betray his vexation either by words or looks, and now began to\ncarry on a conversation with the lady who remained, whom he had\nalready admired. Here his usual bold flirtation followed. The young\nlady, who was at first disturbed at his assurance, betrayed her\nyouthful inexperience in such matters; yet for an innocent maiden, she\nwas rather coquettish, and he went on flirting with her.\n\n\"Chance meetings like this,\" said he, \"often arise from deeper causes\nthan those which take place in the usual routine of things, so at\nleast say the ancients. If I say I love you, you might not believe me;\nand yet, indeed, it is so. Do think of me! True, we are not yet quite\nfree, and perhaps I might not be able to see you so often as I wish;\nbut I hope you will wait with patience, and not forget me.\"\n\n\"Truly, I also fear what people might suspect; and, therefore, I may\nnot be able to communicate with you at all,\" said she, innocently.\n\n\"Perhaps it might not be desirable to employ any other hand,\" he\nrejoined. \"If you only send your message, say through Kokimi, there\nwould not be any harm.\"\n\nGenji now rose to depart, and slyly possessed himself of the scarf\nwhich had been dropped by the other lady. Kokimi, who had been dozing\nall the time, started up suddenly when Genji roused him. He then led\nthe latter to the door. At this moment, the tremulous voice of an\naged female domestic, who appeared quite unexpectedly, exclaimed--\n\n\"Who is there?\"\n\nTo which Kokimi immediately replied, \"It is I!\"\n\n\"What brings you here so late?\" asked the old woman, in a querulous\ntone.\n\n\"How inquisitive! I am now going out. What harm?\" retorted the boy,\nrather scornfully; and, stepping up to the threshold, gave Genji a\npush over it, when all at once the shadow of his tall figure was\nprojected on the moonlit floor.\n\n\"Who's that?\" cried the old woman sharply, and in alarm; but the next\nmoment, without waiting for any reply, mumbled on: \"Ah, ah! 'tis Miss\nMimb, no wonder so tall.\"\n\nThis remark seemed to allude to one of her fellow-servants, who must\nhave been a stalwart maiden, and the subject of remarks among her\ncompanions. The old woman, quite satisfied in thinking that it was she\nwho was with Kokimi, added: \"You, my young master, will soon be as\ntall as she is; I will come out this way, too,\" and approached the\ndoor. Genji could do nothing but stand silent and motionless. When she\ncame nearer she said, addressing the supposed Mimb, \"Have you been\nwaiting on the young mistress this evening? I have been ill since the\nday before yesterday, and kept myself to my room, but was sent for\nthis evening because my services were required. I cannot stand it.\" So\nsaying, and without waiting for any reply, she passed on, muttering as\nshe went, \"Oh! my pain! my pain!\" Genji and the boy now went forth,\nand they drove back to the mansion in Niji\u00c3\u00b4. Talking over the events\nof the evening, Genji ironically said to his companion, \"Ah! you are a\nnice boy!\" and snapped his fingers with chagrin at the escape of his\nfavorite and her indifference. Kokimi said nothing. Genji then\nmurmured, \"I was clearly slighted. Oh wretched me! I cannot rival the\nhappy Iyo!\" Shortly after, he retired to rest, taking with him, almost\nunconsciously, the scarf he had carried off, and again making Kokimi\nshare his apartment, for company's sake. He had still some hope that\nthe latter might be useful to him; and, with the intention of stirring\nup his energies, observed, \"You are a nice boy; but I am afraid the\ncoldness shown to me by your sister may at last weaken the friendship\nbetween you and me.\"\n\nKokimi still made no reply. Genji closed his eyes but could not\nsleep, so he started up and, taking writing materials, began to write,\napparently without any fixed purpose, and indited the following\ndistich:--\n\n    \"Where the cicada casts her shell\n      In the shadows of the tree,\n    There is one whom I love well,\n      Though her heart is cold to me.\"\n\nCasting away the piece of paper on which these words were\nwritten--purposely or not, who knows?--he again leaned his head on his\nhand. Kokimi slyly stretching out his hand, picked up the paper from\nthe floor, and hid it quickly in his dress. Genji soon fell into\nprofound slumber, in which he was speedily joined by Kokimi.\n\nSome days passed away and Kokimi returned to his sister, who, on\nseeing him, chided him severely, saying:--\n\n\"Though I managed with some difficulty, we must not forget what people\nmight say of us, _your_ officiousness is most unpardonable. Do you\nknow what the Prince himself will think of your childish trick?\"\n\nThus was poor Kokimi, on the one hand, reproached by Genji for not\ndoing enough, and on the other by his sister for being too officious!\nwas he not in a very happy position! Yet, notwithstanding her words,\nhe ventured to draw from his dress the paper he had picked up in\nGenji's apartment, and offered it to her. The lady hesitated a moment,\nthough somewhat inclined to read it, holding it in her hand for some\nlittle time, undecided. At length she ventured to throw her eyes over\nits contents. At once the loss of her scarf floated upon her mind as\nshe read, and, taking up her pen, wrote on part of the paper where\nGenji had written his verses, the words of a song:--\n\n    \"Amidst dark shadows of the tree,\n      Cicada's wing with dew is wet,\n    So in mine eyes unknown to thee,\n      Spring sweet tears of fond regret.\"\n\nFOOTNOTES:\n\n[Footnote 51: Ji and K\u00c3\u00b4h are the names of certain positions in the\ngame of \"Go.\"]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\nEVENING GLORY\n\n\nIt happened that when Genji was driving about in the Rokji\u00c3\u00b4 quarter,\nhe was informed that his old nurse, Daini, was ill, and had become a\nnun. Her residence was in Goji\u00c3\u00b4. He wished to visit her, and drove to\nthe house. The main gate was closed, so that his carriage could not\ndrive up; therefore, he sent in a servant to call out Koremitz, a son\nof the nurse.\n\nMeantime, while awaiting him, he looked round on the deserted terrace.\nHe noticed close by a small and rather dilapidated dwelling, with a\nwooden fence round a newly-made enclosure. The upper part, for eight\nor ten yards in length, was surrounded by a trellis-work, over which\nsome white reed blinds--rude, but new--were thrown. Through these\nblinds the indistinct outline of some fair heads were faintly\ndelineated, and the owners were evidently peeping down the roadway\nfrom their retreat. \"Ah,\" thought Genji, \"they can never be so tall as\nto look over the blind. They must be standing on something within. But\nwhose residence is it? What sort of people are they?\" His equipage was\nstrictly private and unostentatious. There were, of course, no\noutriders; hence he had no fear of being recognized by them. And so he\nstill watched the house. The gate was also constructed of something\nlike trellis-work, and stood half open, revealing the loneliness of\nthe interior. The line: \"Where do we seek our home?\" came first into\nhis mind, and he then thought that \"even this must be as comfortable\nas golden palaces to its inmates.\"\n\nA long wooden rail, covered with luxuriant creepers, which, fresh and\ngreen, climbed over it in full vigor, arrested his eye; their white\nblossoms, one after another disclosing their smiling lips in\nunconscious beauty. Genji began humming to himself: \"Ah! stranger\ncrossing there.\" When his attendant informed him that these lovely\nwhite flowers were called \"Y\u00c3\u00bbgao\" (evening-glory), adding, and at the\nsame time pointing to the flowers, \"See the flowers _only_,\nflourishing in that glorious state.\"\n\n\"What beautiful flowers they are,\" exclaimed Genji. \"Go and beg a\nbunch.\"\n\nThe attendant thereupon entered the half-opened gate and asked for\nsome of them, on which a young girl, dressed in a long tunic, came\nout, taking an old fan in her hand, and saying, \"Let us put them on\nthis, those with strong stems,\" plucked off a few stalks and laid them\non the fan.\n\nThese were given to the attendant, who walked slowly back. Just as he\ncame near to Genji, the gate of Koremitz's courtyard opened and\nKoremitz himself appeared, who took the flowers from him and handed\nthem to Genji, at the same moment saying, \"I am very sorry I could not\nfind the gate key, and that I made you wait so long in the public\nroad, though there is no one hereabouts to stare at, or recognize you,\nI sincerely beg your pardon.\"\n\nThe carriage was now driven in, and Genji alighted. The Ajari,[52]\nelder brother of Koremitz; Mikawa-no-Kami, his brother-in-law; and the\ndaughter of Daini, all assembled and greeted him. The nun also rose\nfrom her couch to welcome him.\n\n\"How pleased I am to see you,\" she said, \"but you see I have quite\naltered, I have become a nun. I have given up the world. I had no\nreluctance in doing this. If I had any uneasiness, it was on your\naccount alone. My health, however, is beginning to improve; evidently\nthe divine blessing on this sacrifice.\"\n\n\"I was so sorry,\" replied Genji, \"to hear you were ill, and now still\nmore so to find you have given up the world. I hope that you may live\nto witness my success and prosperity. It grieves me to think you were\ncompelled to make such a change; yet, I believe, this will secure your\nenjoyment of happiness hereafter. It is said that when one leaves this\nworld without a single regret, one passes straight to Paradise.\" As he\nsaid these words his eyes became moistened.\n\nNow, it is common for nurses to regard their foster children with\nblind affection, whatever may be their faults, thinking, so to speak,\nthat what is crooked is straight. So in Genji's case, who, in Daini's\neyes, was next door to perfection, this blindness was still more\nstrongly apparent, and she always regarded her office as his nurse, as\nan honor, and while Genji was discoursing in the above manner, a tear\nbegan to trickle from her eyes.\n\n\"You know,\" he continued, \"at what an early age I was deprived of my\ndearest ties; there were, indeed, several who looked after me, but you\nwere the one to whom I was most attached. In due course, after I grew\nup, I ceased to see you regularly. I could not visit you as often as I\nthought of you, yet, when I did not see you for a long time, I often\nfelt very lonely. Ah! if there were no such things as partings in the\nworld!\"\n\nHe then enjoined them earnestly to persevere in prayer for their\nmother's health, and said, \"Good-by.\"\n\nAt the moment of quitting the house he remembered that something was\nwritten on the fan that held the flowers. It was already twilight, and\nhe asked Koremitz to bring a taper, that he might see to read it. It\nseemed to him as if the fragrance of some fair hand that had used it\nstill remained, and on it was written the following couplets:--\n\n    \"The crystal dew at Evening's hour\n    Sleeps on the Y\u00c3\u00bbgao's beauteous flower,\n    Will this please him, whose glances bright,\n    Gave to the flowers a dearer light?\"\n\nWith apparent carelessness, without any indication to show who the\nwriter was, it bore, however, the marks of a certain excellence. Genji\nthought, \"this is singular, coming from whence it does,\" and turning\nto Koremitz, he asked, \"Who lives in this house to your right?\" \"Ah,\"\nexclaimed Koremitz mentally, \"as usual, I see,\" but replied with\nindifference, \"Truly I have been here some days, but I have been so\nbusy in attending my mother that I neither know nor have asked about\nthe neighbors.\" \"You may probably be surprised at my inquisitiveness,\"\nsaid Genji, \"but I have reasons for asking this on account of this\nfan. I request you to call on them, and make inquiries what sort of\npeople they are.\"\n\nKoremitz thereupon proceeded to the house, and, calling out a servant,\nsought from him the information he wanted, when he was told that,\n\"This is the house of Mr. Y\u00c3\u00b4mei-no-Ske. He is at present in the\ncountry; his lady is still young; her brothers are in the Court\nservice, and often come here to see her. The whole history of the\nfamily I am not acquainted with.\" With this answer Koremitz returned,\nand repeated it to Genji, who thought, \"Ah! the sending of this verse\nmay be a trick of these conceited Court fellows!\" but he could not\nentirely free his mind from the idea of its having been sent\nespecially to himself. This was consistent with the characteristic\nvanity of his disposition. He, therefore, took out a paper, and\ndisguising his handwriting (lest it should be identified), indited the\nfollowing:--\n\n    \"Were I the flower to see more near,\n    Which once at dusky eve I saw,\n    It might have charms for me more dear,\n    And look more beauteous than before.\"\n\nAnd this he sent to the house by his servant, and set off on his way.\nHe saw a faint light through the chinks of the blinds of the house,\nlike the glimmer of the firefly. It gave him, as he passed, a silent\nsort of longing. The mansion in Rokji\u00c3\u00b4, to which he was proceeding\nthis evening, was a handsome building, standing amidst fine woods of\nrare growth and beauty, and all was of comfortable appearance. Its\nmistress was altogether in good circumstances, and here Genji spent\nthe hours in full ease and comfort.\n\nOn his way home next morning he again passed the front of the house,\nwhere grew the Y\u00c3\u00bbgao flowers, and the recollection of flowers which he\nhad received the previous evening, made him anxious to ascertain who\nthe people were who lived there.\n\nAfter the lapse of some time Koremitz came to pay him a visit,\nexcusing himself for not having come before, on account of his\nmother's health being more unsatisfactory. He said, \"In obedience to\nyour commands to make further inquiries, I called on some people who\nknow about my neighbors, but could not get much information. I was\ntold, however, that there is a lady who has been living there since\nlast May, but who she is even the people in the house do not know.\nSometimes I looked over the hedges between our gardens, and saw the\nyouthful figure of a lady, and a maiden attending her, in a style of\ndress which betrayed a good origin. Yesterday evening, after sunset, I\nsaw the lady writing a letter, her face was very calm in expression,\nbut full of thought, and her attendant was often sobbing secretly, as\nshe waited on her. These things I saw distinctly.\"\n\nGenji smiled. He seemed more anxious than before to know something\nabout them, and Koremitz continued: \"Hoping to get some fuller\ninformation, I took an opportunity which presented itself of sending a\ncommunication to the house. To this a speedy answer was returned,\nwritten by a skilful hand. I concluded from this and other\ncircumstances that there was something worth seeing and knowing\nenclosed within those walls.\" Genji immediately exclaimed, \"Do! do!\ntry again; not to be able to find out is too provoking,\" and he\nthought to himself, \"If in lowly life, which is often left unnoticed,\nwe find something attractive and fair, as Sama-no-Kami said, how\ndelightful it will be, and I think, perhaps, this may be such a one.\"\n\nIn the meantime his thoughts were occasionally reverting to Cicada.\nHis nature was not, perhaps, so perverted as to think about persons of\nsuch condition and position in life as Cicada; but since he had heard\nthe discussion about women, and their several classifications, he had\nsomehow become speculative in his sentiments, and ambitious of testing\nall those different varieties by his own experience. While matters\nwere in this state Iyo-no-Kami returned to the capital, and came in\nhaste to pay his respects to Genji. He was a swarthy, repulsive\nlooking man, bearing the traces of a long journey in his appearance,\nand of advanced age. Still there was nothing unpleasant in his natural\ncharacter and manners. Genji was about to converse with him freely,\nbut somehow or another an awkward feeling arose in his mind, and threw\na restraint upon his cordiality. \"Iyo is such an honest old man,\" he\nreflected, \"it is too bad to take advantage of him. What Sama-no-Kami\nsaid is true, 'that to strive to carry out wrong desires is man's evil\nfailing!' Her hardheartedness to me is unpleasant, but from the other\nside this deserves praise!\"\n\nIt was announced after this that Iyo-no-Kami would return to his\nprovince, and take his wife with him, and that his daughter would be\nleft behind to be soon married.\n\nThis intelligence was far from pleasing to Genji, and he longed once\nmore, only once more to behold the lady of the scarf, and he concerted\nwith Kokimi how to arrange a plan for obtaining an interview. The\nlady, however, was quite deaf to such proposals, and the only\nconcession she vouchsafed was that she occasionally received a letter,\nand sometimes answered it.\n\nAutumn had now come; Genji was still thoughtful. Lady Aoi saw him but\nseldom, and was constantly disquieted by his protracted absence from\nher. There was, as we have before hinted, at Rokji\u00c3\u00b4, another person\nwhom he had won with great difficulty, and it would have been a little\ninconsistent if he became too easily tired of her. He indeed had not\nbecome cool towards her, but the violence of his passion had somewhat\nabated. The cause of this seems to have been that this lady was rather\ntoo zealous, or, we may say, jealous; besides, her age exceeded that\nof Genji by some years. The following incident will illustrate the\nstate of matters between them:--\n\nOne morning early Genji was about to take his departure, with sleepy\neyes, listless and weary, from her mansion at Rokji\u00c3\u00b4. A slight mist\nspread over the scene. A maiden attendant of the mistress opened the\ndoor for his departure, and led him forth. The shrubbery of flowering\ntrees struck refreshingly on the sight, with interlacing branches in\nrich confusion, among which was some Asagao in full blossom. Genji was\ntempted to dally, and looked contemplatively over them. The maiden\nstill accompanied him. She wore a thin silk tunic of light green\ncolors, showing off her graceful waist and figure, which it covered.\nHer appearance was attractive. Genji looked at her tenderly, and led\nher to a seat in the garden, and sat down by her side. Her countenance\nwas modest and quiet; her wavy hair was neatly and prettily arranged.\nGenji began humming in a low tone:--\n\n    \"The heart that roams from flower to flower,\n      Would fain its wanderings not betray,\n    Yet 'Asagao,' in morning's hour,\n      Impels my tender wish to stray.\"\n\nSo saying, he gently took her hand; she, however, without appearing to\nunderstand his real meaning, answered thus:--\n\n    \"You stay not till the mist be o'er,\n      But hurry to depart,\n    Say can the flower you leave, no more\n      Detain your changeful heart?\"\n\nAt this juncture a young attendant in Sasinuki[53] entered the garden,\nbrushing away the dewy mist from the flowers, and began to gather some\nbunches of Asagao. The scene was one which we might desire to paint,\nso full of quiet beauty, and Genji rose from his seat, and slowly\npassed homeward. In those days Genji was becoming more and more an\nobject of popular admiration in society, and we might even attribute\nthe eccentricity of some of his adventures to the favor he enjoyed,\ncombined with his great personal attractions. Where beautiful flowers\nexpand their blossoms even the rugged mountaineer loves to rest under\ntheir shade, so wherever Genji showed himself people sought his\nnotice.\n\nNow with regard to the fair one about whom Koremitz was making\ninquiries. After some still further investigations, he came to Genji\nand told him that \"there is some one who often visits there. Who he\nwas I could not at first find out, for he comes with the utmost\nprivacy. I made up my mind to discover him; so one evening I concealed\nmyself outside the house, and waited. Presently the sound of an\napproaching carriage was heard, and the inmates of the house began to\npeep out. The lady I mentioned before was also to be seen; I could not\nsee her very plainly, but I can tell you so much: she looked charming.\nThe carriage itself was now seen approaching, and it apparently\nbelonged to some one of rank. A little girl who was peeping out\nexclaimed, \"Ukon, look here, quick, Chi\u00c3\u00bbji\u00c3\u00b4 is coming.\" Then one older\ncame forward rubbing her hands and saying to the child, 'Don't be so\nfoolish, don't be excited.' How could they tell, I wondered, that the\ncarriage was a Chi\u00c3\u00bbji\u00c3\u00b4's. I stole forth cautiously and reconnoitred.\nNear the house there is a small stream, over which a plank had been\nthrown by way of a bridge. The visitor was rapidly approaching this\nbridge when an amusing incident occurred: The elder girl came out in\nhaste to meet him, and was passing the bridge, when the skirt of her\ndress caught in something, and she well-nigh fell into the water.\n'Confound that bridge, what a bad Katzragi,'[54] she cried, and\nsuddenly turned pale. How amusing it was, you may imagine. The visitor\nwas dressed in plain style, he was followed by his page, whom I\nrecognized as belonging to T\u00c3\u00b4-no-Chi\u00c3\u00bbji\u00c3\u00b4.\"\n\n\"I should like to see that same carriage,\" interrupted Genji eagerly,\nas he thought to himself, \"that house may be the home of the very girl\nwhom he (T\u00c3\u00b4-no-Chi\u00c3\u00bbji\u00c3\u00b4) spoke about, perhaps he has discovered her\nhiding-place.\"\n\n\"I have also made an acquaintance,\" Koremitz continued, \"with a\ncertain person in this house, and it was through these means that I\nmade closer observations. The girl who nearly fell over the bridge is,\nno doubt, the lady's attendant, but they pretend to be all on an\nequality. Even when the little child said anything to betray them by\nits remarks, they immediately turned it off.\" Koremitz laughed as he\ntold this, adding, \"this was an amusing trick indeed.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" exclaimed Genji, \"I must have a look at them when I go to visit\nyour mother; you must manage this,\" and with the words the picture of\nthe \"Evening-Glory\" rose pleasantly before his eyes.\n\nNow Koremitz not only was always prompt in attending to the wishes of\nPrince Genji, but also was by his own temperament fond of carrying on\nsuch intrigues. He tried every means to favor his designs, and to\ningratiate himself with the lady, and at last succeeded in bringing\nher and Genji together. The details of the plans by which all this was\nbrought about are too long to be given here. Genji visited her often,\nbut it was with the greatest caution and privacy; he never asked her\nwhen they met any particulars about her past life, nor did he reveal\nhis own to her. He would not drive to her in his own carriage, and\nKoremitz often lent him his own horse to ride. He took no attendant\nwith him except the one who had asked for the \"Evening-Glory.\" He\nwould not even call on the nurse, lest it might lead to discoveries.\nThe lady was puzzled at his reticence. She would sometimes send her\nservant to ascertain, if possible, what road he took, and where he\nwent. But somehow, by chance or design, he always became lost to her\nwatchful eye. His dress, also, was of the most ordinary description,\nand his visits were always paid late in the evening. To her all this\nseemed like the mysteries of old legends. True, she conjectured from\nhis demeanor and ways that he was a person of rank, but she never\nascertained exactly who he was. She sometimes reproached Koremitz for\nbringing her into such strange circumstances. But he cunningly kept\nhimself aloof from such taunts.\n\nBe this as it may, Genji still frequently visited her, though at the\nsame time he was not unmindful that this kind of adventure was\nscarcely consistent with his position. The girl was simple and modest\nin nature, not certainly manoeuvring, neither was she stately or\ndignified in mien, but everything about her had a peculiar charm and\ninterest, impossible to describe, and in the full charm of youth not\naltogether void of experience.\n\n\"But by what charm in her,\" thought Genji, \"am I so strongly affected;\nno matter, I am so,\" and thus his passion continued.\n\nHer residence was only temporary, and this Genji soon became aware of.\n\"If she leaves this place,\" thought he, \"and I lose sight of her--for\nwhen this may happen is uncertain--what shall I do?\" He at last\ndecided to carry her off secretly to his own mansion in Niji\u00c3\u00b4. True,\nif this became known it would be an awkward business; but such are\nlove affairs; always some dangers to be risked! He therefore fondly\nentreated her to accompany him to some place where they could be\nfreer.\n\nHer answer, however, was \"That such a proposal on his part only\nalarmed her.\" Genji was amused at her girlish mode of expression, and\nearnestly said, \"Which of us is a fox?[55] I don't know, but anyhow be\npersuaded by me.\" And after repeated conversations of the same nature,\nshe at last half-consented. He had much doubt of the propriety of\ninducing her to take this step, nevertheless her final compliance\nflattered his vanity. He recollected very well the Tokonatz (Pinks)\nwhich T\u00c3\u00b4-no-Chi\u00c3\u00bbji\u00c3\u00b4 spoke of, but never betrayed that he had any\nknowledge of that circumstance.\n\nIt was on the evening of the 15th of August when they were together.\nThe moonlight streamed through the crevices of the broken wall. To\nGenji such a scene was novel and peculiar. The dawn at length began to\nbreak, and from the surrounding houses the voices of the farmers might\nbe heard talking.\n\nOne remarked, \"How cool it is.\" Another, \"There is not much hope for\nour crops this year.\" \"My carrying business I do not expect to\nanswer,\" responded the first speaker. \"But are our neighbors\nlistening!\" Conversing in this way they proceeded to their work.\n\nHad the lady been one to whom surrounding appearances were important,\nshe might have felt disturbed, but she was far from being so, and\nseemed as if no outward circumstances could trouble her equanimity,\nwhich appeared to him an admirable trait. The noise of the threshing\nof the corn came indistinctly to their ears like distant thunder. The\nbeating of the bleacher's hammer was also heard faintly from afar off.\n\nThey were in the front of the house. They opened the window and looked\nout on the dawn. In the small garden before their eyes was a pretty\nbamboo grove; their leaves, wet with dew, shone brilliantly, even as\nbright as in the gardens of the palace. The cricket sang cheerfully in\nthe old walls as if it was at their very ears, and the flight of wild\ngeese in the air rustled overhead. Everything spoke of rural scenes\nand business, different from what Genji was in the habit of seeing and\nhearing round him.\n\nTo him all these sights and sounds, from their novelty and variety,\ncombined with the affection he had for the girl beside him, had a\ndelightful charm. She wore a light dress of clear purple, not very\ncostly; her figure was slight and delicate; the tones of her voice\nsoft and insinuating. \"If she were only a little more cultivated,\"\nthought he, but, in any case, he was determined to carry her off.\n\n\"Now is the time,\" said he, \"let us go together, the place is not very\nfar off.\"\n\n\"Why so soon?\" she replied, gently. As her implied consent to his\nproposal was thus given without much thought, he, on his part, became\nbolder. He summoned her maid, Ukon, and ordered the carriage to be got\nready. Dawn now fairly broke; the cocks had ceased to crow, and the\nvoice of an aged man was heard repeating his orisons, probably during\nhis fast. \"His days will not be many,\" thought Genji, \"what is he\npraying for?\" And while so thinking, the aged mortal muttered, \"Nam\nT\u00c3\u00b4rai no D\u00c3\u00b4shi\" (Oh! the Divine guide of the future). \"Do listen to\nthat prayer,\" said Genji, turning to the girl, \"it shows our life is\nnot limited to this world,\" and he hummed:--\n\n    \"Let us together, bind our soul\n      With vows that Woobasok[56] has given,\n    That when this world from sight shall roll\n      Unparted we shall wake in heaven.\"\n\nAnd added, \"By Mirok,[57] let us bind ourselves in love forever.\"\n\nThe girl, doubtful of the future, thus replied in a melancholy tone:--\n\n    \"When in my present lonely lot,\n      I feel my past has not been free\n    From sins which I remember not,\n      I dread more, what to come, may be.\"\n\nIn the meantime a passing cloud had suddenly covered the sky, and made\nits face quite gray. Availing himself of this obscurity, Genji hurried\nher away and led her to the carriage, where Ukon also accompanied her.\n\nThey drove to an isolated mansion on the Rokji\u00c3\u00b4 embankment, which was\nat no great distance, and called out the steward who looked after it.\nThe grounds were in great solitude, and over them lay a thick mist.\nThe curtains of the carriage were not drawn close, so that the sleeves\nof their dresses were almost moistened. \"I have never experienced this\nsort of trouble before,\" said Genji; \"how painful are the sufferings\nof love.\"\n\n    \"Oh! were the ancients, tell me pray,\n      Thus led away, by love's keen smart,\n    I ne'er such morning's misty ray\n      Have felt before with beating heart.\n\nHave you ever?\"\n\nThe lady shyly averted her face and answered:--\n\n    \"I, like the wandering moon, may roam,\n      Who knows not if her mountain love\n    Be true or false, without a home,\n      The mist below, the clouds above.\"\n\nThe steward presently came out and the carriage was driven inside the\ngates, and was brought close to the entrance, while the rooms were\nhurriedly prepared for their reception. They alighted just as the mist\nwas clearing away.\n\nThis steward was in the habit of going to the mansion of Sadaijin, and\nwas well acquainted with Genji.\n\n\"Oh!\" he exclaimed, as they entered. \"Without proper attendants!\" And\napproaching near to Genji said, \"Shall I call in some more servants?\"\n\nGenji replied at once and impressively, \"I purposely chose a place\nwhere many people should not intrude. Don't trouble yourself, and be\ndiscreet.\"\n\nRice broth was served up for their breakfast, but no regular meal had\nbeen prepared.\n\nThe sun was now high in the heavens. Genji got up and opened the\nwindow. The gardens had been uncared for, and had run wild. The forest\nsurrounding the mansion was dense and old, and the shrubberies were\nravaged and torn by the autumn gales, and the bosom of the lake was\nhidden by rank weeds. The main part of the house had been for a long\ntime uninhabited, except the servants' quarter, where there were only\na few people living.\n\n\"How fearful the place looks; but let no demon molest us,\" thought\nGenji, and endeavored to direct the girl's attention by fond and\ncaressing conversation. And now he began, little by little, to throw\noff the mask, and told her who he was, and then began humming:--\n\n    \"The flower that bloomed in evening's dew,\n    Was the bright guide that led to you.\"\n\nShe looked at him askance, replying:--\n\n    \"The dew that on the Y\u00c3\u00bbgao lay,\n    Was a false guide and led astray.\"\n\nThus a faint allusion was made to the circumstances which were the\ncause of their acquaintance, and it became known that the verse and\nthe fan had been sent by her attendant mistaking Genji for her\nmistress's former lover.\n\nIn the course of a few hours the girl became more at her ease, and\nlater on in the afternoon Koremitz came and presented some fruits. The\nlatter, however, stayed with them only a short time.\n\nThe mansion gradually became very quiet, and the evening rapidly\napproached. The inner room was somewhat dark and gloomy. Y\u00c3\u00bbgao was\nnervous; she was too nervous to remain there alone, and Genji\ntherefore drew back the curtains to let the twilight in, staying there\nwith her. Here the lovers remained, enjoying each other's sight and\ncompany, yet the more the evening advanced, the more timid and\nrestless she became, so he quickly closed the casement, and she drew\nby degrees closer and closer to his side. At these moments he also\nbecame distracted and thoughtful. How the Emperor would be asking\nafter him, and know not where he might be! What would the lady, the\njealous lady, in the neighboring mansion think or say if she\ndiscovered their secret? How painful it would be if her jealous rage\nshould flash forth on him! Such were the reflections which made him\nmelancholy; and as his eyes fell upon the girl affectionately sitting\nbeside him, ignorant of all these matters, he could not but feel a\nkind of pity for her.\n\nNight was now advancing, and they unconsciously dropped off to sleep,\nwhen suddenly over the pillow of Genji hovered the figure of a lady of\nthreatening aspect. It said fiercely, \"You faithless one, wandering\nastray with such a strange girl.\"\n\nAnd then the apparition tried to pull away the sleeping girl near him.\nGenji awoke much agitated. The lamp had burnt itself out. He drew his\nsword, and placed it beside him, and called aloud for Ukon, and she\ncame to him also quite alarmed.\n\n\"Do call up the servants and procure a light,\" said Genji.\n\n\"How can I go, 'tis too dark,\" she replied, shaking with fear.\n\n\"How childish!\" he exclaimed, with a false laugh, and clapped his\nhands to call a servant. The sound echoed drearily through the empty\nrooms, but no servant came. At this moment he found the girl beside\nhim was also strangely affected. Her brow was covered with great drops\nof cold perspiration, and she appeared rapidly sinking into a state of\nunconsciousness.\n\n\"Ah! she is often troubled with the nightmare,\" said Ukon, \"and\nperhaps this disturbs her now; but let us try and rouse her.\"\n\n\"Yes, very likely,\" said Genji; \"she was very much fatigued, and since\nnoon her eyes have often been riveted upwards, like one suffering from\nsome inward malady. I will go myself and call the servants\"--he\ncontinued, \"clapping one's hands is useless, besides it echoes\nfearfully. Do come here, Ukon, for a little while, and look after your\nmistress.\" So pulling Ukon near Y\u00c3\u00bbgao, he advanced to the entrance of\nthe saloon. He saw all was dark in the adjoining chambers. The wind\nwas high, and blew gustily round the mansion. The few servants,\nconsisting of a son of the steward, footman, and page, were all buried\nin profound slumber. Genji called to them loudly, and they awoke with\na start. \"Come,\" said he, \"bring a light. Valet, twang your\nbow-string, and drive away the fiend. How can you sleep so soundly in\nsuch a place? But has Koremitz come?\"\n\n\"Sir, he came in the evening, but you had given no command, and so he\nwent away, saying he would return in the morning,\" answered one.\n\nThe one who gave this reply was an old knight, and he twanged his\nbow-strings vigorously, \"Hiy\u00c3\u00b4jin! hiy\u00c3\u00b4jin!\" (Be careful of the fire!\nbe careful of the fire!) as he walked round the rooms.\n\nThe mind of Genji instinctively reverted at this moment to the comfort\nof the palace. \"At this hour of midnight,\" he thought, \"the careful\nknights are patrolling round its walls. How different it is here!\"\n\nHe returned to the room he had left; it was still dark. He found Y\u00c3\u00bbgao\nlying half dead and unconscious as before, and Ukon rendered helpless\nby fright.\n\n\"What is the matter? What does it mean? What foolish fear is this?\"\nexclaimed Genji, greatly alarmed. \"Perhaps in lonely places like this\nthe fox, for instance, might try to exercise his sorcery to alarm us,\nbut I am here, there is no cause for fear,\" and he pulled Ukon's\nsleeve as he spoke, to arouse her.\n\n\"I was so alarmed,\" she replied; \"but my lady must be more so; pray\nattend to her.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Genji, and bending over his beloved, shook her gently,\nbut she neither spoke nor moved. She had apparently fainted, and he\nbecame seriously alarmed.\n\nAt this juncture the lights were brought. Genji threw a mantle over\nhis mistress, and then called to the man to bring the light to him.\nThe servant remained standing at a distance (according to etiquette),\nand would not approach.\n\n\"Come near,\" exclaimed Genji, testily. \"Do act according to\ncircumstances,\" and taking the lamp from him threw its light full on\nthe face of the lady, and gazed upon it anxiously, when at this very\nmoment he beheld the apparition of the same woman he had seen before\nin his terrible dream, float before his eyes and vanish. \"Ah!\" he\ncried, \"this is like the phantoms in old tales. What is the matter\nwith the girl?\" His own fears were all forgotten in his anxiety on her\naccount. He leaned over and called upon her, but in vain. She answered\nnot, and her glance was fixed. What was to be done? There was no one\nwhom he could consult. The exorcisms of a priest, he thought, might do\nsome good, but there was no priest. He tried to compose himself with\nall the resolution he could summon, but his anguish was too strong for\nhis nerves. He threw himself beside her, and embracing her\npassionately, cried, \"Come back! come back to me, my darling! Do not\nlet us suffer such dreadful events.\" But she was gone; her soul had\npassed gently away.\n\nThe story of the mysterious power of the demon, who had threatened a\ncertain courtier possessed of considerable strength of mind, suddenly\noccurred to Genji, who thought self-possession was the only remedy in\npresent circumstances, and recovering his composure a little, said to\nUkon, \"She cannot be dead! She shall not die yet!\" He then called the\nservant, and told him. \"Here is one who has been strangely frightened\nby a vision. Go to Koremitz and tell him to come at once; and if his\nbrother, the priest, is there, ask him to come also. Tell them\ncautiously; don't alarm their mother.\"\n\nThe midnight passed, and the wind blew louder, rushing amongst the\nbranches of the old pines, and making them moan more and more sadly.\nThe cries of strange weird birds were heard, probably the shrieks of\nthe ill-omened screech-owl, and the place seemed more and more remote\nfrom all human sympathy. Genji could only helplessly repeat, \"How\ncould I have chosen such a retreat.\" While Ukon, quite dismayed, cried\npitifully at his side. To him it seemed even that this girl might\nbecome ill, might die! The light of the lamp flickered and burnt dim.\nEach side of the walls seemed to his alarmed sight to present\nnumberless openings one after another (where the demon might rush in),\nand the sound of mysterious footsteps seemed approaching along the\ndeserted passages behind them. \"Ah! were Koremitz but here,\" was the\nonly thought of Genji; but it would seem that Koremitz was from home,\nand the time Genji had to wait for him seemed an age. At last the\ncrowing cocks announced the coming day, and gave him new courage.\n\nHe said to himself, \"I must now admit this to be a punishment for all\nmy inconsiderateness. However secretly we strive to conceal our\nfaults, eventually they are discovered. First of all, what might not\nmy father think! and then the general public? And what a subject for\nscandal the story of my escapades will become.\"\n\nKoremitz now arrived, and all at once the courage with which Genji had\nfought against calamity gave way, and he burst into tears, and then\nslowly spoke. \"Here a sad and singular event has happened; I cannot\nexplain to you why. For such sudden afflictions prayers, I believe,\nare the only resource. For this reason I wished your brother to\naccompany you here.\"\n\n\"He returned to his monastery only yesterday,\" replied Koremitz. \"But\ntell me what has happened; any unusual event to the girl?\"\n\n\"She is dead,\" returned Genji in a broken voice; \"dead without any\napparent cause.\"\n\nKoremitz, like the Prince, was but young. If he had had greater\nexperience he would have been more serviceable to Genji; indeed, they\nboth were equally perplexed to decide what were the best steps to be\ntaken under the trying circumstances of the case.\n\nAt last Koremitz said, \"If the steward should learn this strange\nmisfortune it might be awkward; as to the man himself he might be\nrelied on, but his family, who probably would not be so discreet,\nmight hear of the matter. It would, therefore, be better to quit this\nplace at once.\"\n\n\"But where can we find a spot where there are fewer observers than\nhere?\" replied Genji.\n\n\"That is true. Suppose the old lodgings of the deceased. No, there are\ntoo many people there. I think a mountain convent would be better,\nbecause there they are accustomed to receive the dead within their\nwalls, so that matters can be more easily concealed.\"\n\nAnd after a little reflection, he continued, \"There is a nun whom I\nknow living in a mountain convent in Higashi-Yama. Let us take the\ncorpse there. She was my father's nurse; she is living there in strict\nseclusion. That is the best plan I can think of.\"\n\nThis proposal was decided on, and the carriage was summoned.\n\nPresuming that Genji would not like to carry the dead body in his\narms, Koremitz covered it with a mantle, and lifted it into the\ncarriage. Over the features of the dead maiden a charming calmness was\nstill spread, unlike what usually happens, there being nothing\nrepulsive. Her wavy hair fell outside the mantle, and her small mouth,\nstill parted, wore a faint smile. The sight distressed both the eyes\nand heart of Genji. He fain would have followed the body; but this\nKoremitz would not permit.\n\n\"Do take my horse and ride back to Niji\u00c3\u00b4 at once,\" he said, and\nordered the horse for him. Then taking Ukon away in the same carriage\nwith the dead, he, girding up his dress, followed it on foot. It was\nby no means a pleasant task for Koremitz, but he put up with it\ncheerfully.\n\nGenji, sunk in apathy, now rode back to Niji\u00c3\u00b4; he was greatly\nfatigued, and looked pale. The people of the mansion noticed his sad\nand haggard appearance.\n\nGenji said nothing, but hurried straight away to his own private\napartment.\n\n\"Why did I not go with her?\" he still vainly exclaimed. \"What would\nshe think of me were she to return to life?\" And these thoughts\naffected him so deeply that he became ill, his head ached, his pulse\nbeat high, and his body burned with fever. The sun rose high, but he\ndid not leave his couch. His domestics were all perplexed. Rice gruel\nwas served up to him, but he would not touch it. The news of his\nindisposition soon found its way out of the mansion, and in no time a\nmessenger arrived from the Imperial Palace to make inquiries. His\nbrother-in-law also came, but Genji only allowed T\u00c3\u00b4-no-Chi\u00c3\u00bbji\u00c3\u00b4 to\nenter his room, saying to him, \"My aged nurse has been ill since last\nMay, and has been tonsured, and received consecration; it was,\nperhaps, from this sacrifice that at one time she became better, but\nlately she has had a relapse, and is again very bad. I was advised to\nvisit her, moreover, she was always most kind to me, and if she had\ndied without seeing me it would have pained her, so I went to see her.\nAt this time a servant of her house, who had been ill, died suddenly.\nBeing rendered 'unclean' by this event, I am passing the time\nprivately. Besides, since the morning, I have become ill, evidently\nthe effects of cold. By the bye, you must excuse me receiving you in\nthis way.\"\n\n\"Well, sir,\" replied T\u00c3\u00b4-no-Chi\u00c3\u00bbji\u00c3\u00b4, \"I will represent these\ncircumstances to his Majesty. Your absence last night has given much\ninquietude to the Emperor. He caused inquiries to be made for you\neverywhere, and his humor was not very good.\" And thereupon\nT\u00c3\u00b4-no-Chi\u00c3\u00bbji\u00c3\u00b4 took his leave, thinking as he went, \"What sort of\n'uncleanness' can this really be. I cannot put perfect faith in what\nhe tells me.\"\n\nLittle did T\u00c3\u00b4-no-Chi\u00c3\u00bbji\u00c3\u00b4 imagine that the dead one was no other than\nhis own long-lost Tokonatz (Pinks).\n\nIn the evening came Koremitz from the mountain, and was secretly\nintroduced, though all general visitors were kept excluded on the\npretext of the \"uncleanness.\"\n\n\"What has become of her?\" cried Genji, passionately, when he saw him.\n\"Is she really gone?\"\n\n\"Her end has come,\" replied Koremitz, in a tone of sadness; \"and we\nmust not keep the dead too long. To-morrow we will place her in the\ngrave: to-morrow 'is a good day.' I know a faithful old priest. I have\nconsulted with him how to arrange all.\"\n\n\"And what has become of Ukon?\" asked Genji. \"How does she bear it?\"\n\n\"That is, indeed, a question. She was really deeply affected, and she\nfoolishly said, 'I will die with my mistress.' She was actually going\nto throw herself headlong from the cliff; but I warned, I advised, I\nconsoled her, and she became more pacified.\"\n\n\"The state of her feelings may be easily conceived. I am myself not\nless deeply wounded than she. I do not even know what might become of\nmyself.\"\n\n\"Why do you grieve so uselessly? Every uncertainty is the result of a\ncertainty. There is nothing in this world really to be lamented. If\nyou do not wish the public to know anything of this matter, I,\nKoremitz, will manage it.\"\n\n\"I, also, am aware that everything is fated. Still, I am deeply sorry\nto have brought this misfortune on this poor girl by my own\ninconsiderate rashness. The only thing I have now to ask you, is to\nkeep these events in the dark. Do not mention them to any one--nay,\nnot even to your mother.\"\n\n\"Even from the priests to whom it must necessarily be known, I will\nconceal the reality,\" replied Koremitz.\n\n\"Do manage all this most skilfully!\"\n\n\"Why, of course I shall manage it as secretly as possible,\" cried\nKoremitz; and he was about to take his departure, but Genji stopped\nhim.\n\n\"I must see her once more,\" said Genji, sorrowfully. \"I will go with\nyou to behold her, before she is lost to my sight forever.\" And he\ninsisted on accompanying him.\n\nKoremitz, however, did not at all approve of this project; but his\nresistance gave way to the earnest desire of Genji, and he said, \"If\nyou think so much about it, I cannot help it.\"\n\n\"Let us hasten, then, and return before the night be far advanced.\"\n\n\"You shall have my horse to ride.\"\n\nGenji rose, and dressed himself in the ordinary plain style he usually\nadopted for his private expeditions, and started away with one\nconfidential servant, besides Koremitz.\n\nThey crossed the river Kamo, the torches carried before them burning\ndimly. They passed the gloomy cemetery of Toribeno, and at last\nreached the convent.\n\nIt was a rude wooden building, and adjoining was a small Buddha Hall,\nthrough whose walls votive tapers mysteriously twinkled. Within,\nnothing but the faint sound of a female's voice repeating prayers was\nto be heard. Outside, and around, the evening services in the\nsurrounding temples were all finished, and all Nature was in silent\nrepose. In the direction of Kiyomidz alone some scattered lights\nstudding the dark scene betrayed human habitations.\n\nThey entered. Genji's heart was beating fast with emotion. He saw Ukon\nreclining beside a screen, with her back to the lamp. He did not speak\nto her, but proceeded straight to the body, and gently drew aside the\nmantle which covered its face. It still wore a look of tranquil\ncalmness; no change had yet attacked the features. He took the cold\nhand in his own, crying out as he did so:--\n\n\"Do let me hear thy voice once more! Why have you left me thus\nbereaved?\" But the silence of death was unbroken!\n\nHe then, half sobbing, began to talk with Ukon, and invited her to\ncome to his mansion, and help to console him. But Koremitz now\nadmonished him to consider that time was passing quickly.\n\nOn this Genji threw a long sad farewell glance at the face of the\ndead, and rose to depart. He was so feeble and powerless that he could\nnot mount his horse without the help of Koremitz. The countenance of\nthe dead girl floated ever before his sight, with the look she wore\nwhen living, and it seemed as if he were being led on by some\nmysterious influence.\n\nThe banks of the river Kamo were reached, when Genji found himself too\nweak to support himself on horseback, and so dismounted.\n\n\"I am afraid,\" he exclaimed, \"I shall not be able to reach home.\"\n\nKoremitz was a little alarmed. \"If I had only been firm,\" he thought,\n\"and had prevented this journey, I should not have exposed him to such\na trial.\" He descended to the river, and bathing his hands,[58]\noffered up a prayer to Kwannon of Kiyomidz, and again assisted Genji\nto mount, who struggled to recover his energy, and managed somehow to\nreturn to Niji\u00c3\u00b4, praying in silence as he rode along.\n\nThe people of the mansion entertained grave apprehensions about him;\nand not unnaturally, seeing he had been unusually restless for some\ndays, and had become suddenly ill since the day before, and they could\nnever understand what urgency had called him out on that evening.\n\nGenji now lay down on his couch, fatigued and exhausted, and continued\nin the same state for some days, when he became quite weak.\n\nThe Emperor was greatly concerned, as was also Sadaijin. Numerous\nprayers were offered, and exorcisms performed everywhere in his\nbehalf, all with the most careful zeal. The public was afraid he was\ntoo beautiful to live long.\n\nThe only solace he had at this time was Ukon; he had sent for her, and\nmade her stay in his mansion.\n\nAnd whenever he felt better he had her near him, and conversed with\nher about her dead mistress.\n\nIn the meantime, it might have been the result of his own energetic\nefforts to realize the ardent hopes of the Emperor and his\nfather-in-law, that his condition became better, after a heavy trial\nof some three weeks; and towards the end of September he became\nconvalescent. He now felt as though he had been restored to the world\nto which he had formerly belonged. He was, however, still thin and\nweak, and, for consolation, still resorted to talk with Ukon.\n\n\"How strange,\" he said to her, as they were conversing together one\nfine autumn evening. \"Why did she not reveal to me all her past life?\nIf she had but known how deeply I loved her, she might have been a\nlittle more frank with me.\"\n\n\"Ah! no,\" replied Ukon; \"she would not intentionally have concealed\nanything from you; but it was, I imagine, more because she had no\nchoice. You at first conducted yourself in such a mysterious manner;\nand she, on her part, regarded her acquaintance with you as something\nlike a dream. That was the cause of her reticence.\"\n\n\"What a useless reticence it was,\" exclaimed Genji. \"I was not so\nfrank as, perhaps, I ought to have been; but you may be sure that made\nno difference in my affection towards her. Only, you must remember,\nthere is my father, the Emperor, besides many others, whose vigilant\nadmonitions I am bound to respect. That was the reason why I had to be\ncareful. Nevertheless, my love to your mistress was singularly deep;\ntoo deep, perhaps, to last long. Do tell me now all you know about\nher; I do not see any reason why you should conceal it. I have\ncarefully ordered the weekly requiem for the dead; but tell me in\nwhose behalf it is, and what was her origin?\"\n\n\"I have no intention of concealing anything from you. Why should I? I\nonly thought it would be blamable if one should reveal after death\nwhat another had thought best to reserve,\" replied Ukon. \"Her parents\ndied when she was a mere girl. Her father was called Sammi-Chi\u00c3\u00bbji\u00c3\u00b4,\nand loved her very dearly. He was always aspiring to better his\nposition, and wore out his life in the struggle. After his death, she\nwas left helpless and poor. She was however, by chance, introduced to\nT\u00c3\u00b4-no-Chi\u00c3\u00bbji\u00c3\u00b4, when he was still Shi\u00c3\u00b4shi\u00c3\u00b4, and not Chi\u00c3\u00bbji\u00c3\u00b4. During\nthree years they kept on very good terms, and he was very kind to\nher. But some wind or other attacks every fair flower; and, in the\nautumn of last year, she received a fearful menace from the house of\nUdaijin, to whose daughter, as you know, T\u00c3\u00b4-no-Chi\u00c3\u00bbji\u00c3\u00b4 is married.\nPoor girl, she was terrified at this. She knew not what to do, and hid\nherself, with her nurse, in an obscure part of the capital. It was not\na very agreeable place, and she was about removing to a certain\nmountain hamlet, but, as its 'celestial direction' was closed this\nyear, she was still hesitating, and while matters were in this state,\nyou appeared on the scene. To do her justice, she had no thought of\nwandering from one to another; but circumstances often make things\nappear as if we did so. She was, by nature, extremely reserved, so\nthat she did not like to speak out her feelings to others, but rather\nsuffered in silence by herself. This, perhaps, you also have noticed.\"\n\n\"Then it was so, after all. She was the Tokonatz of T\u00c3\u00b4-no-Chi\u00c3\u00bbji\u00c3\u00b4,\"\nthought Genji; and now it also transpired that all that Koremitz had\nstated about T\u00c3\u00b4-no-Chi\u00c3\u00bbji\u00c3\u00b4's visiting her at the Y\u00c3\u00bbgao house was a\npure invention, suggested by a slight acquaintance with the girl's\nprevious history.\n\n\"The Chi\u00c3\u00bbji\u00c3\u00b4 told me once,\" said Genji, \"that she had a little one.\nWas there any such?\"\n\n\"Yes, she had one in the spring of the year before last--a girl, a\nnice child,\" replied Ukon.\n\n\"Where is she now?\" asked Genji, \"perhaps you will bring her to me\nsome day. I should like to have her with me as a memento of her\nmother. I should not mind mentioning it to her father, but if I did\nso, I must reveal the whole sad story of her mother's fate, and this\nwould not be advisable at present; however, I do not see any harm if I\nwere to bring her up as my daughter. You might manage it somehow\nwithout my name being mentioned to any one concerned.\"\n\n\"That would be a great happiness for the child,\" exclaimed Ukon,\ndelighted, \"I do not much appreciate her being brought up where she\nis.\"\n\n\"Well, I will do so, only let us wait for some better chance. For the\npresent be discreet.\"\n\n\"Yes, of course. I cannot yet take any steps towards that object; we\nmust not unfurl our sails before the storm is completely over.\"\n\nThe foliage of the ground, touched with autumnal tints, was beginning\nto fade, and the sounds of insects (_mushi_) were growing faint, and\nboth Genji and Ukon were absorbed by the sad charm of the scene. As\nthey meditated, they heard doves cooing among the bamboo woods.\n\nTo Genji it brought back the cries of that strange bird, which cry he\nhad heard on that fearful night in Rokji\u00c3\u00b4, and the subject recurred to\nhis mind once more, and he said to Ukon, \"How old was she?\"\n\n\"Nineteen.\"\n\n\"And how came you to know her?\"\n\n\"I was the daughter of her first nurse, and a great favorite of her\nfather's, who brought me up with her, and from that time I never left\nher. When I come to think of those days I wonder how I can exist\nwithout her. The poet says truly, 'The deeper the love, the more\nbitter the parting.' Ah! how gentle and retiring she was. How much I\nloved her!\"\n\n\"That retiring and gentle temperament,\" said Genji, \"gives far greater\nbeauty to women than all beside, for to have no natural pliability\nmakes women utterly worthless.\"\n\nThe sky by this time became covered, and the wind blew chilly. Genji\ngazed intently on it and hummed:--\n\n    \"When we regard the clouds above,\n      Our souls are filled with fond desire,\n    To me the smoke of my dead love,\n      Seems rising from the funeral pyre.\"\n\nThe distant sound of the bleacher's hammer reached their ears, and\nreminded him of the sound he had heard in the Y\u00c3\u00bbgao's house. He bade\n\"Good-night\" to Ukon, and retired to rest, humming as he went:--\n\n    \"In the long nights of August and September.\"\n\nOn the forty-ninth day (after the death of the Y\u00c3\u00bbgao) he went to the\nHokke Hall in the Hiye mountain, and there had a service for the dead\nperformed, with full ceremony and rich offerings. The monk-brother of\nKoremitz took every pains in its performance.\n\nThe composition of requiem prayers was made by Genji himself, and\nrevised by a professor of literature, one of his intimate friends. He\nexpressed in it the melancholy sentiment about the death of one whom\nhe had dearly loved, and whom he had yielded to Buddha. But who she\nwas was not stated. Among the offerings there was a dress. He took it\nup in his hands and sorrowfully murmured,\n\n    \"With tears to-day, the dress she wore\n      I fold together, when shall I\n    Bright Elysium's far-off shore\n      This robe of hers again untie?\"\n\nAnd the thought that the soul of the deceased might be still wandering\nand unsettled to that very day, but that now the time had come when\nher final destiny would be decided,[59] made him pray for her more\nfervently.\n\nSo closed the sad event of Y\u00c3\u00bbgao.\n\nNow Genji was always thinking that he should wish to see his beloved\nin a dream.\n\nThe evening after his visit to the Hokke Hall, he beheld her in his\nslumbers, as he wished, but at the same moment the terrible face of\nthe woman that he had seen on that fearful evening in Rokji\u00c3\u00b4 again\nappeared before him; hence he concluded that the same mysterious being\nwho tenanted that dreary mansion had taken advantage of his fears and\nhad destroyed his beloved Y\u00c3\u00bbgao.\n\nA few words more about the house in which she had lived. After her\nflight no communication had been sent to them even by Ukon, and they\nhad no idea of where she had gone to. The mistress of the house was a\ndaughter of the nurse of Y\u00c3\u00bbgao. She with her two sisters lived there.\nUkon was a stranger to them, and they imagined that her being so was\nthe reason of her sending no intelligence to them. True they had\nentertained some suspicions about the gay Prince, and pressed Koremitz\nto confide the truth to them, but the latter, as he had done before,\nkept himself skilfully aloof.\n\nThey then thought she might have been seduced and carried off by some\ngallant son of a local Governor, who feared his intrigue might be\ndiscovered by T\u00c3\u00b4-no-Chi\u00c3\u00bbji\u00c3\u00b4.\n\nDuring these days Kokimi, of Ki-no-Kami's house, still used to come\noccasionally to Genji. But for some time past the latter had not sent\nany letter to Cicada. When she heard of his illness she not\nunnaturally felt for him, and also she had experienced a sort of\ndisappointment in not seeing his writing for some time, especially as\nthe time of her departure for the country was approaching. She\ntherefore sent him a letter of inquiry with the following:--\n\n    \"If long time passes slow away,\n      Without a word from absent friend,\n    Our fears no longer brook delay,\n      But must some kindly greeting send.\"\n\nTo this letter Genji returned a kind answer and also the following:--\n\n    \"This world to me did once appear\n      Like Cicada's shell, when cast away,\n    Till words addressed by one so dear,\n      Have taught my hopes a brighter day.\"\n\nThis was written with a trembling hand, but still bearing nice traits,\nand when it reached Cicada, and she saw that he had not yet forgotten\npast events, and the scarf he had carried away, she was partly amused\nand partly pleased.\n\nIt was about this time that the daughter of Iyo-no-Kami was engaged to\na certain Kurando Shi\u00c3\u00b4shi\u00c3\u00b4, and he was her frequent visitor. Genji\nheard of this, and without any intention of rivalry, sent her the\nfollowing by Kokimi:--\n\n    \"Like the green reed that grows on high\n      By river's brink, our love has been,\n    And still my wandering thoughts will fly\n      Back to that quickly passing scene.\"\n\nShe was a little flattered by it, and gave Kokimi a reply, as\nfollows:--\n\n    \"The slender reed that feels the wind\n      That faintly stirs its humble leaf,\n    Feels that too late it breathes its mind,\n      And only wakes, a useless grief.\"\n\nNow the departure of Iyo-no-Kami was fixed for the beginning of\nOctober.\n\nGenji sent several parting presents to his wife, and in addition to\nthese some others, consisting of beautiful combs, fans, _nusa_,[60]\nand the scarf he had carried away, along with the following, privately\nthrough Kokimi:--\n\n    \"I kept this pretty souvenir\n      In hopes of meeting you again,\n    I send it back with many a tear,\n      Since now, alas! such hope is vain.\"\n\nThere were many other minute details, which I shall pass over as\nuninteresting to the reader.\n\nGenji's official messenger returned, but her reply about the scarf was\nsent through Kokimi:--\n\n    \"When I behold the summer wings\n      Cicada like, I cast aside;\n    Back to my heart fond memory springs,\n      And on my eyes, a rising tide.\"\n\nThe day of the departure happened to be the commencement of the winter\nseason. An October shower fell lightly, and the sky looked gloomy.\n\nGenji stood gazing upon it and hummed:--\n\n    \"Sad and weary Autumn hours,\n      Summer joys now past away,\n    Both departing, dark the hours,\n      Whither speeding, who can say?\"\n\nAll these intrigues were safely kept in strict privacy, and to have\nboldly written all particulars concerning them is to me a matter of\npain. So at first I intended to omit them, but had I done so my\nhistory would have become like a fiction, and the censure I should\nexpect would be that I had done so intentionally, because my hero was\nthe son of an Emperor; but, on the other hand, if I am accused of too\nmuch loquacity, I cannot help it.\n\nFOOTNOTES:\n\n[Footnote 52: Name of an ecclesiastical office.]\n\n[Footnote 53: Sasinuki is a sort of loose trousers, and properly worn\nby men only, hence some commentators conclude, the attendant here\nmentioned to mean a boy, others contend, this garment was worn by\nfemales also when they rode.]\n\n[Footnote 54: A mythological repulsive deity who took part in the\nbuilding of a bridge at the command of a powerful magician.]\n\n[Footnote 55: A popular superstition in China and Japan believes foxes\nto have mysterious powers over men.]\n\n[Footnote 56: Upasaka, a sect of the followers of Buddhism who are\nlaymen though they observe the rules of clerical life.]\n\n[Footnote 57: Meitreya, a Buddhisatva destined to reappear as a Buddha\nafter the lapse of an incalculable series of years.]\n\n[Footnote 58: It is the Oriental custom that when one offers up a\nprayer, he first washes his hands, to free them from all impurity.]\n\n[Footnote 59: According to the Buddhist's doctrine of the Hosso sect,\nall the souls of the dead pass, during seven weeks after death, into\nan intermediate state, and then their fate is decided.

At length he was told by a friend that in a certain\ntemple on the northern mountain (Mount Kurama) there dwelt a famous\nascetic, and that when the epidemic had prevailed during the previous\nsummer, many people had recovered through his exorcisms. \"If,\" added\nthe friend, \"the disease is neglected it becomes serious; try\ntherefore, this method of procuring relief at once, and before it is\ntoo late.\"\n\nGenji, therefore, sent for the hermit, but he declined to come, saying\nthat he was too old and decrepit to leave his retreat. \"What shall I\ndo?\" exclaimed Genji, \"shall I visit him privately?\" Eventually,\ntaking four or five attendants, he started off early one morning for\nthe place, which was at no great distance on the mountain.\n\nIt was the last day of March, and though the height of the season for\nflowers in the capital was over, yet, on the mountain, the\ncherry-trees were still in blossom. They advanced on their way further\nand further. The haze clung to the surface like a soft sash does round\nthe waist, and to Genji, who had scarcely ever been out of the\ncapital, the scenery was indescribably novel. The ascetic lived in a\ndeep cave in the rocks, near the lofty summit. Genji did not, however,\ndeclare who he was, and the style of his retinue was of a very private\ncharacter. Yet his nobility of manners was easily recognizable.\n\n\"Welcome your visit!\" cried the hermit, saluting him. \"Perhaps you are\nthe one who sent for me the other day? I have long since quitted the\naffairs of this world, and have almost forgotten the secret of my\nexorcisms. I wonder why you have come here for me.\" So saying, he\npleasingly embraced him. He was evidently a man of great holiness. He\nwrote out a talismanic prescription, which he gave to Genji to drink\nin water, while he himself proceeded to perform some mysterious rite.\nDuring the performance of this ceremony the sun rose high in the\nheavens. Genji, meantime, walked out of the cave and looked around him\nwith his attendants. The spot where they stood was very lofty, and\nnumerous monasteries were visible, scattered here and there in the\ndistance beneath. There was immediately beyond the winding path in\nwhich they were walking a picturesque and pretty building enclosed by\nhedges. Its well arranged balconies and the gardens around it\napparently betokened the good taste of its inhabitants. \"Whose house\nmay that be?\" inquired Genji of his attendants. They told him it was a\nhouse in which a certain priest had been living for the last two\nyears. \"Ah! I know him,\" said Genji. \"Strange, indeed, would it be if\nhe were to discover that I am here in this privacy.\" They noticed a\nnun and a few more females with her walking in the garden, who were\ncarrying fresh water for their offerings, and were gathering flowers.\n\"Ah! there are ladies walking there,\" cried the attendants in tones of\nsurprise. \"Surely, the Reverend Father would not indulge in\nflirtations! Who can they be?\" And some of them even descended a\nlittle distance, and peered over the enclosure, where a pretty little\ngirl was also seen amongst them.\n\nGenji now engaged in prayer until the sun sank in the heavens. His\nattendants, who were anxious about his disease, told him that it would\nbe good for him to have a change from time to time. Hereupon, he\nadvanced to the back of the temple, and his gaze fell on the far-off\nCapital in the distance, which was enveloped in haze as the dusk was\nsetting in, over the tops of the trees around. \"What a lovely\nlandscape!\" exclaimed Genji. \"The people to whom such scenery is\nfamiliar, are perhaps happy and contented.\" \"Nay,\" said the\nattendants, \"but were you to see the beautiful mountain ranges and the\nsea-coast in our various provinces, the pictures would indeed be found\nlovely.\" Then some of them described to him Fuji Yama, while others\ntold him of other mountains, diverting his attention by their animated\ndescription of the beautiful bays and coasts of the Western Provinces;\nthus as they depicted them to him, they cheered and gladdened his\nmind. One of them went on to say: \"Among such sights and at no great\ndistance, there is the sea-coast of Akashi, in the Province of\nHarima, which is, I think, especially beautiful. I cannot, indeed,\npoint out in detail its most remarkable features, but, in general, the\nblue expanse of the sea is singularly charming. Here, too, the home of\nthe former Governor of the Province constitutes an object of great\nattraction. He has assumed the tonsure, and resides there with his\nbeautiful daughter. He is the descendant of a high personage, and was\nnot without hope of elevation at Court, but, being of an eccentric\ncharacter, he was strongly averse to society. He had formerly been a\nChi\u00c3\u00bbji\u00c3\u00b4 of the Imperial Guard, but having resigned that office, had\nbecome Governor of Harima. He was not, however, popular in that\noffice. In this state of affairs he reflected within himself, no\ndoubt, that his presence in the Capital could not but be disagreeable.\nWhen, therefore, his term of office expired, he determined still to\nremain in the province. He did not, however, go to the mountainous\nregions of the interior, but chose the sea-coast. There are in this\ndistrict several places which are well situated for quiet retirement,\nand it would have seemed inconsistent in him had he preferred a part\nof the sea-coast so near the gay world; nevertheless, a retreat in the\ntoo remote interior would have been too solitary, and might have met\nwith objections on the part of his wife and child. For this reason, it\nappears, that he finally selected the place which I have already\nalluded to for the sake of his family. When I went down there last\ntime, I became acquainted with the history and circumstances of the\nfamily, and I found that though he may not have been well received in\nthe Capital, yet, that here, having been formerly governor, he enjoys\nconsiderable popularity and respect. His residence, moreover, is well\nappointed and of sufficient magnitude, and he performs with\npunctuality and devoutness his religious duties--nay, almost with more\nearnestness than many regular priests.\" Here Genji interrupted. \"What\nis his daughter like?\" \"Without doubt,\" answered his companion, \"the\nbeauty of her person is unrivalled, and she is endowed with\ncorresponding mental ability. Successive governors often offer their\naddresses to her with great sincerity, but no one has ever yet been\naccepted. The dominant idea of her father seems to be this: 'What,\nhave I sunk to such a position! Well, I trust, at least, that my only\ndaughter may be successful and prosperous in her life!' He often told\nher, I heard, that if she survived him, and if his fond hopes for her\nshould not be realized, it would be better for her to cast herself\ninto the sea.\"\n\nGenji was much interested in this conversation, and the rest of the\ncompany laughingly said, \"Ah! she is a woman who is likely to become\nthe Queen of the Blue Main. In very truth her father must be an\nextraordinary being!\"\n\nThe attendant who had given this account of the ex-governor and his\ndaughter, was the son of the present Governor of the Province. He was\nuntil lately a Kurand, and this year had received the title of Jugoi.\nHis name was Yoshikiyo, and he, too, was a man of gay habits, which\ngave occasion to one of his companions to observe: \"Ah! perhaps you\nalso have been trying to disappoint the hopes of the aged father.\"\nAnother said, \"Well, our friend has given us a long account, but we\nmust take it with some reserve. She must be, after all, a country\nmaiden, and all that I can give credit to is this much: that her\nmother may be a woman of some sense, who takes great care of the girl.\nI am only afraid that if any future governor should be seized with an\nardent desire to possess her, she would not long remain unattached.\"\n\n\"What possible object could it serve if she were carried to the bottom\nof the sea? The natives of the deep would derive no pleasure from her\ncharms,\" remarked Genji, while he himself secretly desired to behold\nher.\n\n\"Ay,\" thought his companions, \"with his susceptible temperament, what\nwonder if this story touches him.\"\n\nThe day was far advanced, and the Prince prepared to leave the\nmountain. The Hermit, however, told him that it would be better to\nspend the evening in the Temple, and to be further prayed for. His\nattendants also supported this suggestion. So Genji made up his mind\nto stay there, saying, \"Then I shall not return home till to-morrow.\"\n\nThe days at this season were of long duration, and he felt it rather\ntiresome to pass a whole evening in sedate society, so, under the\ncover of the shades of the evening, he went out of the Temple, and\nproceeded to the pretty building enclosed by hedges. All the\nattendants had been despatched home except Koremitz, who accompanied\nhim. They peeped at this building through the hedges. In the western\nantechamber of the house was placed an image of Buddha, and here an\nevening service was performed. A nun, raising a curtain before\nBuddha, offered a garland of flowers on the altar, and placing a Ki\u00c3\u00b4\n(or Sutra, i.e., Buddhist Bible) on her \"arm-stool,\" proceeded to read\nit. She seemed to be rather more than forty years old. Her face was\nrather round, and her appearance was noble. Her hair was thrown back\nfrom her forehead and was cut short behind, which suited her very\nwell. She was, however, pale and weak, her voice, also, being\ntremulous. Two maiden attendants went in and out of the room waiting\nupon her, and a little girl ran into the room with them. She was about\nten years old or more, and wore a white silk dress, which fitted her\nwell and which was lined with yellow. Her hair was waved like a fan,\nand her eyes were red from crying. \"What is the matter? Have you\nquarrelled with the boy?\" exclaimed the nun, looking at her. There was\nsome resemblance between the features of the child and the nun, so\nGenji thought that she possibly might be her daughter.\n\n\"Inuki has lost my sparrow, which I kept so carefully in the cage,\"\nreplied the child.\n\n\"That stupid boy,\" said one of the attendants. \"Has he again been the\ncause of this? Where can the bird be gone? And all this, too, after we\nhad tamed it with so much care.\" She then left the room, possibly to\nlook for the lost bird. The people who addressed her called her\nShi\u00c3\u00b4nagon, and she appeared to have been the little girl's nurse.\n\n\"To you,\" said the nun to the girl, \"the sparrow may be dearer than I\nmay be, who am so ill; but have I not told you often that the caging\nof birds is a sin? Be a good girl; come nearer!\"\n\nThe girl advanced and stood silent before her, her face being bathed\nin tears. The contour of the child-like forehead and of the small and\ngraceful head was very pleasing. Genji, as he surveyed the scene from\nwithout, thought within himself, \"If she is thus fair in her girlhood,\nwhat will she be when she is grown up?\" One reason why Genji was so\nmuch attracted by her was, that she greatly resembled a certain lady\nin the Palace, to whom he, for a long time, had been fondly attached.\nThe nun stroked the beautiful hair of the child and murmured to\nherself, \"How splendid it looks! Would that she would always strive to\nkeep it thus. Her extreme youth makes me anxious, however. Her mother\ndeparted this life when she only a very young girl, but she was quite\nsensible at the age of this one. Supposing that I were to leave her\nbehind, I wonder what would happen to her!\" As she thus murmured, her\ncountenance became saddened by her forebodings.\n\nThe sight moved Genji's sympathy as he gazed. It seemed that the\ntender heart of the child was also touched, for she silently watched\nthe expression of the nun's features, and then with downcast eyes bent\nher face towards the ground, the lustrous hair falling over her back\nin waves.\n\nThe nun hummed, in a tone sufficiently audible to Genji,\n\n    \"The dews that wet the tender grass,\n    At the sun's birth, too quickly pass,\n    Nor e'er can hope to see it rise\n    In full perfection to the skies.\"\n\nShi\u00c3\u00b4nagon, who now joined them, and heard the above distich, consoled\nthe nun with the following:--\n\n    \"The dews will not so quickly pass,\n      Nor shall depart before they see\n    The full perfection of the grass,\n      They loved so well in infancy.\"\n\nAt this juncture a priest entered and said, \"Do you know that this\nvery day Prince Genji visited the hermit in order to be exorcised by\nhim. I must forthwith go and see him.\"\n\nGenji observing this movement quickly returned to the monastery,\nthinking as he went what a lovely girl he had seen. \"I can guess from\nthis,\" thought he, \"why those gay fellows (referring to his\nattendants) so often make their expeditions in search of good fortune.\nWhat a charming little girl have I seen to-day! Who can she be? Would\nthat I could see her morning and evening in the palace, where I can no\nlonger see the fair loved one whom she resembles!\" He now returned to\nthe monastery, and retired to his quarters. Soon after a disciple of\nthe priest came and delivered a message from him through Koremitz,\nsaying, \"My master has just heard of the Prince's visit to the\nmountain, and would have waited on him at once, but thought it better\nto postpone calling. Nevertheless he would be much pleased to offer a\nhumble welcome, and feels disappointed that he has not yet had an\nopportunity of doing so.\"\n\nGenji said in reply, \"I have been afflicted with constant attacks of\nague for the last few weeks, and, therefore, by the advice of my\nfriends, I came to this mountain to be exorcised. If, however, the\nspells of the holy man are of no avail to me, his reputation might\nsuffer in consequence. For that reason I wish to keep my visit as\nprivate as possible, nevertheless I will come now to your master.\"\nThereupon the priest himself soon made his appearance, and, after\nbriefly relating the circumstances which had occasioned his retirement\nto this locality, he offered to escort Genji to his house, saying, \"My\ndwelling is but a rustic cottage, but still I should like you to see,\nat least, the pretty mountain streamlet which waters my garden.\"\n\nGenji accepted the offer, thinking as he went, \"I wonder what the\npriest has said at home about myself to those to whom I have not yet\nbeen introduced. But it will be pleasant to see them once more.\"\n\nThe night was moonless. The fountain was lit up by torches, and many\nlamps also were lighted in the garden. Genji was taken to an airy room\nin the southern front of the building, where incense which was burning\nthrew its sweet odors around. The priest related to him many\ninteresting anecdotes, and also spoke eloquently of man's future\ndestiny. Genji as he heard him, felt some qualms of conscience, for he\nremembered that his own conduct was far from being irreproachable. The\nthought troubled him that he would never be free from the sting of\nthese recollections through his life, and that there was a world to\ncome, too! \"Oh, could I but live in a retreat like this priest!\" As he\nthus thought of a retreat, he was involuntarily taken by a fancy, that\nhow happy would he be if accompanied to such a retreat by such a girl\nas he had seen in the evening, and with this fancy her lovely face\nrose up before him.\n\nSuddenly he said to the priest, \"I had once a dream which made me\nanxious to know who was living in this house, and here to-day that\ndream has again come back to my memory!\" The priest laughed, and said,\n\"A strange dream! even were you to obtain your wish it might not\ngratify you. The late Lord Azechi Dainagon died long ago, and perhaps\nyou know nothing about him. Well! his widow is my sister, and since\nher husband's death her health has not been satisfactory, so lately\nshe has been living here in retirement.\"\n\n\"Ah, yes,\" said Genji, venturing upon a guess, \"and I heard that she\nbore a daughter to Dainagon.\"\n\n\"Yes, she had a daughter, but she died about ten years ago. After her\nfather's death the sole care of her fell upon her widowed mother\nalone. I know not how it came to pass, but she became secretly\nintimate with Prince Hi\u00c3\u00b4bki\u00c3\u00b4. But the Prince's wife was very jealous\nand severe, so she had much to suffer and put up with. I saw\npersonally the truth that 'care kills more than labor.'\"\n\n\"Ah, then,\" thought Genji, \"the little one is her daughter, and no\nwonder that she resembles the one in the palace (because Prince\nHi\u00c3\u00b4bki\u00c3\u00b4 was the brother of the Princess Wistaria). How would it be if\nI had free control over her, and had her brought up and educated\naccording to my own notions?\" So thinking, he proceeded to say how sad\nit was that she died! \"Did she leave any offspring?\"\n\n\"She gave birth to a child at her death, which was also a girl, and\nabout this girl the grandmother is always feeling very anxious.\"\n\n\"Then,\" said Genji, \"let it not appear strange to you if I say this,\nbut I should be very happy to become the guardian of this girl. Will\nyou speak to her grandmother about it? It is true that there is one to\nwhom my lot is linked, but I care but little for her, and indeed\nusually lead a solitary life.\"\n\n\"Your offer is very kind,\" replied the priest, \"but she is extremely\nyoung. However every woman grows up under the protecting care of some\none, and so I cannot say much about her, only it shall be mentioned to\nmy sister.\"\n\nThe priest said this with a grave and even a stern expression on his\ncountenance, which caused Genji to drop the subject.\n\nHe then asked the Prince to excuse him, for it was the hour for\nvespers, and as he quitted the room to attend the service, said he\nwould return as soon as it was finished.\n\nGenji was alone. A slight shower fell over the surrounding country,\nand the mountain breezes blew cool. The waters of the torrent were\nswollen, and the roar of them might be heard from afar. Broken and\nindistinct, one might hear the melancholy sound of the sleepy\nintonation of prayers. Even those people who have no sorrow of their\nown often feel melancholy from the circumstances in which they are\nplaced. So Genji, whose mind was occupied in thought, could not\nslumber here. The priest said he was going to vespers, but in reality\nit was later than the proper time for them. Genji perceived that the\ninmates had not yet retired to rest in the inner apartments of the\nhouse. They were very quiet, yet the sound of the telling of beads,\nwhich accidentally struck the lectern, was heard from time to time.\nThe room was not far from his own. He pulled the screen slightly\naside, and standing near the door, he struck his fan on his hand, to\nsummon some one.\n\n\"What can be the matter,\" said an attendant, and as she came near to\nthe Prince's room she added, \"Perhaps my ear was deceived,\" and she\nbegan to retire.\n\n\"Buddha will guide you; fear not the darkness, I am here,\" said Genji.\n\n\"Sir!\" replied the servant, timidly.\n\n\"Pray do not think me presumptuous,\" said Genji; \"but may I beg you to\ntransmit this poetical effusion to your mistress for me?\n\n    Since first that tender grass I viewed,\n      My heart no soft repose e'er feels,\n    But gathering mist my sleeve bedews,\n      And pity to my bosom steals.\"\n\n\"Surely you should know, sir, that there is no one here to whom such\nthings can be presented!\"\n\n\"Believe me, I have my own reasons for this,\" said Genji. \"Let me\nbeseech you to take it.\"\n\nSo the attendant went back, and presented it to the nun.\n\n\"I do not see the real intent of the effusion,\" thought the nun.\n\"Perhaps he thinks that she is already a woman. But\"--she continued,\nwonderingly--\"how could he have known about the young grass?\" And she\nthen remained silent for a while. At last, thinking it would be\nunbecoming to take no notice of it, she gave orally the following\nreply to the attendant to be given to Genji:--\n\n    \"You say your sleeve is wet with dew,\n    'Tis but one night alone for you,\n    But there's a mountain moss grows nigh,\n    Whose leaves from dew are never dry.\"\n\nWhen Genji heard this, he said: \"I am not accustomed to receive an\nanswer such as this through the mouth of a third person. Although I\nthank the lady for even that much, I should feel more obliged to her\nif she would grant me an interview, and allow me to explain to her my\nsincere wishes.\"\n\nThis at length obliged the nun to have an interview with the Prince.\nHe then told her that he called Buddha to witness that, though his\nconduct may have seemed bold, it was dictated by pure and\nconscientious motives.\n\n\"All the circumstances of your family history are known to me,\"\ncontinued he. \"Look upon me, I pray, as a substitute for your once\nloved daughter. I, too, when a mere infant, was deprived by death of\nmy best friend--my mother--and the years and months which then rolled\nby were fraught with trouble to me. In that same position your little\none is now. Allow us, then, to become friends. We could sympathize\nwith each other. 'Twas to reveal these wishes to you that I came here,\nand risked the chance of offending you in doing so.\"\n\n\"Believe me, I am well disposed at your offer,\" said the nun; \"but you\nmay have been incorrectly informed. It is true that there is a little\ngirl dependent upon myself, but she is but a child. Her society could\nnot afford you any pleasure; and forgive me, therefore, if I decline\nyour request.\"\n\n\"Yet let there be no reserve in the expression of your ideas,\"\ninterrupted Genji; but, before they could talk further, the return of\nthe priest put an end to the subject, and Genji retired to his\nquarters, after thanking the nun for his kind reception.\n\nThe night passed away, and dawn appeared. The sky was again hazy, and\nhere and there melodious birds were singing among the mountain shrubs\nand flowers that blossomed around. The deer, too, which were to be\nseen here, added to the beauty of the picture. Gazing around at these\nGenji once more proceeded to the temple. The hermit--though too infirm\nto walk--again contrived to offer up his prayers on Genji's behalf,\nand he also read from the Darani.[61] The tremulous accents of the old\nman--poured forth from his nearly toothless mouth--imparted a greater\nreverence to his prayers.\n\nGenji's attendants now arrived from the capital, and congratulated him\non the improvement in his health. A messenger was despatched from the\nImperial Palace for the same purpose. The priest now collected wild\nand rare fruits, not to be met with in the distant town, and, with all\nrespect, presented them to Genji, saying: \"The term of my vow has not\nyet expired; and I am, therefore, sorry to say that I am unable to\ndescend the mountain with you on your departure.\" He then offered to\nhim the parting cup of _sak\u00c3\u00a9_.\n\n\"This mountain, with its waters, fill me with admiration,\" said Genji,\n\"and I regret that the anxiety of my father the Emperor obliges me to\nquit the charming scene; but before the season is past, I will revisit\nit: and--\n\n    The city's folk from me shall hear\n    How mountain cherries blossom fair,\n    And ere the Spring has passed away,\n    I'll bid them view the prospect gay.\"\n\nTo this the priest replied--\n\n    \"Your noble presence seems to me\n    Like the rare flowers of Udon tree,[62]\n    Nor does the mountain cherry white,\n    Attract my gaze while you're in sight.\"\n\nGenji smiled slightly, and said: \"That is a very great compliment; but\nthe Udon tree does not blossom so easily.\"\n\nThe hermit also raised the cup to his lips, and said:--\n\n    \"Opening my lonely hermit's door,\n      Enclosed around by mountain pine,\n    A blossom never seen before\n      My eyes behold that seems divine.\"\n\nAnd he presented to him his _toko_ (a small ecclesiastical wand). On\nseeing this, the priest also made him the following presents:--A\nrosary of Kong\u00c3\u00b4ji (a kind of precious stone), which the sage Prince\nSh\u00c3\u00b4tok obtained from Corea, enclosed in the original case in which it\nhad been sent from that country; some medicine of rare virtue in a\nsmall emerald jar; and several other objects, with a spray of\nWistaria, and a branch of cherry blossoms.\n\nGenji, too, on the other hand, made presents, which he had ordered\nfrom the capital, to the hermit and his disciples who had taken part\nin the religious ceremonies, and also to the poor mountaineers. He\nalso sent the following to the nun, by the priest's page:--\n\n    \"In yester-eve's uncertain light,\n    A flower I saw so young and bright,\n    But like a morning mist. Now pain\n    Impels me yet to see again.\"\n\nA reply from the nun was speedily brought to him, which ran thus:--\n\n    \"You say you feel, perhaps 'tis true,\n      A pang to leave these mountain bowers,\n    For sweet the blossoms, sweet the view,\n      To strangers' eyes of mountain flowers.\"\n\nWhile this was being presented to him in his carriage, a few more\npeople came, as if accidentally, to wait upon him on his journey.\nAmong them was T\u00c3\u00b4-no-Chi\u00c3\u00bbji\u00c3\u00b4, and his brother Ben, who said: \"We are\nalways pleased to follow you; it was unkind of you to leave us\nbehind.\"\n\nJust as the party were on the point of starting, some of them observed\nthat it was a pity to leave so lovely a spot without resting awhile\namong the flowers. This was immediately agreed to, and they took their\nseats on a moss-grown rock, a short distance from which a little\nstreamlet descended in a murmuring cascade.\n\nThey there began to drink _sak\u00c3\u00a9_, and T\u00c3\u00b4-no-Chi\u00c3\u00bbji\u00c3\u00b4 taking his flute,\nevoked from it a rich and melodious strain; while Ben, tapping his fan\nin concert, sang \"The Temple of Toyora,\" while the Prince, as he\nleaned against a rock, presented a picturesque appearance, though he\nwas pale and thin.\n\nAmong the attendants was one who blew on a long flute, called\nHichiriki, and another on a Shi\u00c3\u00b4 flute. The priest brought a _koto_,\nand begged Genji to perform upon it, saying: \"If we are to have music\nat all, let us have a harmonious concert.\" Genji said that he was no\nmaster of music; but, nevertheless, he played, with fair ability, a\npleasing air. Then they all rose up, and departed.\n\nAfter they had quitted the mountain, Genji first of all went to the\nPalace, where he immediately had an interview with the Emperor, who\nconsidered his son to be still weak in health; and who asked him\nseveral questions with regard to the efficacy of the prayers of the\nreverend hermit. Genji gave him all particulars of his visit to the\nmountain.\n\n\"Ah!\" said the Emperor, \"he may some day be entitled to become a dean\n(Azali). His virtue and holiness have not yet been duly appreciated by\nthe government and the nation.\"\n\nSadaijin, the father-in-law of the Prince, here entered, and entreated\nGenji to accompany him to his mansion, and spend a few days. Genji did\nnot feel very anxious to accept this invitation, but was persuaded to\ndo so. Sadaijin conveyed him in his own carriage, and gave up to him\nthe seat of honor.\n\nThey arrived; but, as usual, his bride did not appear, and only\npresented herself at last at the earnest request of her father. She\nwas one of those model princesses whom one may see in a picture--very\nformal and very sedate--and it was very difficult to draw her into\nconversation. She was very uninteresting to Genji. He thought that it\nwould only lead to a very unpleasant state of affairs, as years grew\non, if they were to be as cool and reserved to each other as they had\nbeen hitherto. Turning to her, he said, with some reproachfulness in\nhis accents, \"Surely you should sometimes show me a little of the\nordinary affection of people in our position!\"\n\nShe made no reply; but, glancing coolly upon him, murmured with\nmodest, yet dignified, tone--\n\n     \"When you cease to care for me,\n     What can I then do for thee?\"\n\n\"Your words are few; but they have a sting in them. You say I cease to\ncare for you; but you do me wrong in saying so. May the time come when\nyou will no longer pain me thus,\" said Genji; and he made every effort\nto conciliate her. But she was not easily appeased. He was\nunsuccessful in his effort, and presently they retired to their\napartment, where he soon relapsed into sleepy indifference. His\nthoughts began to wander back into other regions, and hopes of the\nfuture growth and charms of the young mountain-violet again occupied\nhis mind. \"Oh! how difficult it is to secure a prize,\" thought he.\n\"How can I do so? Her father, Prince Hi\u00c3\u00b4bki\u00c3\u00b4, is a man of rank, and\naffable, but he is not of prepossessing appearance. Why does his\ndaughter resemble so much, in her personal attractions, the lovely one\nin the chamber of Wistaria. Is it that the mother of her father and of\nWistaria is the same person? How charming is the resemblance between\nthem! How can I make her mine?\"\n\nSome days afterwards he sent a letter to the mountain home, and also a\ncommunication--perhaps with some hint in it--to the priest. In his\nletter to the nun he said that her indifference made it desirable to\nrefrain from urging his wishes; but, nevertheless, that he should be\ndeeply gratified if she would think more favorably of the idea which\nwas now so deeply rooted in his mind. Inside the letter he enclosed a\nsmall folded slip of paper, on which was written:--\n\n    \"The mountain flower I left behind\n      I strive but vainly to forget,\n    Those lovely traits still rise to mind\n      And fill my heart with sad regret.\"\n\nThis ludicrous effusion caused the nun to be partly amused and partly\nvexed. She wrote an answer as follows:--\n\n\"When you came into our neighborhood your visit was very pleasing to\nus, and your special message does us honor. I am, however, at a loss\nhow to express myself with regard to the little one, as yet she cannot\neven manage the naniwadz.\"[63]\n\nEnclosed in the note were the following lines, in which she hinted as\nto her doubts of the steadfastness of Genji's character:\n\n    \"Your heart admires the lowly flower\n    That dwells within our mountain bower.\n    Not long, alas! that flower may last\n    Torn by the mountain's angry blast.\"\n\nThe tenor of the priest's answer was much the same, and it caused\nGenji some vexation.\n\nAbout this time the Lady Wistaria, in consequence of an attack of\nillness, had retired from the palace to her private residence, and\nGenji, while sympathizing with the anxiety of the Emperor about her,\nlonged greatly for an opportunity of seeing her, ill though she was.\nHence at this time he went nowhere, but kept himself in his mansion at\nNiji\u00c3\u00b4, and became thoughtful and preoccupied. At length he endeavored\nto cajole \u00c3\u0094 Mi\u00c3\u00b4bu, Wistaria's attendant, into arranging an opportunity\nfor him to see her. On Wistaria's part there were strong doubts as to\nthe propriety of complying with his request, but at last the\nearnestness of the Prince overcame her scruples, and \u00c3\u0094 Mi\u00c3\u00b4bu managed\neventually to bring about a meeting between them.[64]\n\nGenji gave vent to his feelings to the Princess, as follows:--\n\n    \"Though now we meet, and not again\n      We e'er may meet, I seem\n    As though to die, I were full fain\n      Lost in this blissful dream.\"\n\nThen the Princess replied to him, full of sadness:--\n\n    \"We might dream on but fear the name,\n      The envious world to us may give,\n    Forgetful of the darkened fame,\n      That lives when we no longer live.\"\n\nFor some time after this meeting had taken place, Genji found himself\ntoo timid to appear at his father's palace, and remained in his\nmansion. The Princess, too, experienced a strong feeling of remorse.\nShe had, moreover, a cause of anxiety special in its nature and\npeculiar to herself as a woman, for which she alone felt some\nuneasiness of conscience.\n\nThree months of the summer had passed away, and her secret began to\nbetray itself externally. The Emperor was naturally anxious about the\nhealth of his favorite, and kind inquiries were sent from time to time\nto her. But the kinder he was to her the more conscience-stricken she\nfelt.\n\nGenji at this time was often visited by strange dreams. When he\nconsulted a diviner about them, he was told that something remarkable\nand extraordinary might happen to him, and that it behooved him to be\ncautious and prudent.\n\n\"Here is a pretty source of embarrassment,\" thought Genji.\n\nHe cautioned the diviner to be discreet about it, especially because\nhe said the dreams were not his own but another person's. When at last\nhe heard authentically about the condition of the Princess, he was\nextremely anxious to communicate with her, but she now peremptorily\nobjected to any kind of correspondence between them, and \u00c3\u0094 Mi\u00c3\u00b4bu too\nrefused any longer to assist him.\n\nIn July Wistaria returned to the palace. There she was received by the\nEmperor with great rejoicing, and he thought that her condition did\nbut add to her attractiveness.\n\nIt was now autumn, the season when agreeable receptions were often\nheld by the Emperor in Court, and it was awkward when Genji and the\nPrincess happened to face each other on these occasions, as neither of\nthem could be free from their tender recollections.\n\nDuring these autumn evenings the thoughts of Genji were often directed\nto the granddaughter of the nun, especially because she resembled the\nPrincess so much. His desire to possess her was considerably\nincreased, and the recollection of the first evening when he heard\nthe nun intoning to herself the verses about the tender grass,\nrecurred to his mind. \"What,\" thought he, \"if I pluck this tender\ngrass, would it then be, would it then grow up, as fair as now.\"\n\n    \"When will be mine this lovely flower\n      Of tender grace and purple hue?\n    Like the Wistaria of the bower,\n      Its charms are lovely to my view.\"\n\nThe Emperor's visit to the Palace Suzak-in was now announced to take\nplace in October, and dancers and musicians were selected from among\nthe young nobles who were accomplished in these arts, and Royal\nPrinces and officers of State were fully engaged in preparation for\nthe _f\u00c3\u00aate_. After the Royal festivities, a separate account of which\nwill be given hereafter, he sent again a letter to the mountain. The\nanswer, however, came only from the priest, who said that his sister\nhad died on the twentieth day of the last month; and added that though\ndeath is inevitable to all of us, still he painfully felt her loss.\n\nGenji pondered first on the precariousness of human life, and then\nthought how that little one who had depended on her must be afflicted,\nand gradually the memory of his own childhood, during which he too had\nlost his mother, came back to his mind.\n\nWhen the time of full mourning was over, Shi\u00c3\u00b4nagon, together with the\nyoung girl, returned to their house in the capital. There one evening\nGenji paid them a visit. The house was rather a gloomy one, and was\ntenanted by fewer inmates than usual.\n\n\"How timid the little girl must feel!\" thought Genji, as he was shown\nin. Shi\u00c3\u00b4nagon now told him with tearful eyes every circumstance which\nhad taken place since she had seen him. She also said that the girl\nmight be handed over to her father, who told her that she must do so,\nbut his present wife was said to be very austere. The girl is not\nyoung enough to be without ideas and wishes of her own, but yet not\nold enough to form them sensibly; so were she to be taken to her\nfather's house and be placed with several other children, much misery\nwould be the result. Her grandmother suffered much on this account.\n\"Your kindness is great,\" continued she, \"and we ought not, perhaps,\nto think too anxiously about the future. Still she is young, too\nyoung, and we cannot think of it without pity.\"\n\n\"Why do you recur to that so often?\" said Genji, \"it is her very\nyouthfulness which moves my sympathy. I am anxious to talk to her,\n\n    Say, can the wave that rolls to land,\n      Return to ocean's heaving breast,\n    Nor greet the weed upon the strand\n      With one wild kiss, all softly pressed.\n\nHow sweet it would be!\"\n\n\"That is very beautifully put, sir,\" said Shi\u00c3\u00b4nagon, \"but,\n\n    Half trembling at the coming tide\n      That rolls about the sea-beat sand,\n    Say, can the tender weed untried,\n      Be trusted to its boisterous hand?\"\n\nMeanwhile the girl, who was with her companions in her apartment, and\nwho was told that a gentleman in Court dress had arrived, and that\nperhaps it was the Prince, her father, came running in, saying,\n\"Shi\u00c3\u00b4nagon, where is the gentleman in Court dress; has the Prince, my\nfather, arrived?\"\n\n\"Not the Prince, your father,\" uttered Genji, \"but I am here, and I\ntoo am your friend. Come here!\"\n\nThe girl, glancing with shy timidity at Genji, for whom she already\nhad some liking, and thinking that perhaps there was impropriety in\nwhat she had spoken, went over to her nurse, and said, \"Oh! I am very\nsleepy, and wish to lie down!\"\n\n\"See how childish she still is,\" remarked Shi\u00c3\u00b4nagon.\n\n\"Why are you so timid, little one, come here and sleep on my knees,\"\nsaid Genji.\n\n\"Go, my child, as you are asked,\" observed Shi\u00c3\u00b4nagon, and she pushed\nher towards Genji.\n\nHalf-unconsciously she took her place by his side. He pushed aside a\nsmall shawl which covered her hair, and played with her long tresses,\nand then he took her small hand in his. \"Ah, my hand!\" cried she, and\ndrawing it back, she ran into a neighboring room. Genji followed her,\nand tried to coax her out of her shyness, telling her that he was one\nof her best friends, and that she was not to be so timid.\n\nBy this time darkness had succeeded to the beautiful evening, and hail\nbegan to fall.\n\n\"Close the casement, it is too fearful, I will watch over you this\nevening,\" said Genji, as he led the girl away, to the great surprise\nof Shi\u00c3\u00b4nagon and others who wondered at his ease in doing this.\n\nBy and by she became sleepy, and Genji, as skilfully as any nurse\ncould, removed all her outer clothing, and placed her on the couch to\nsleep, telling her as he sat beside her, \"some day you must come with\nme to some beautiful palace, and there you shall have as many pictures\nand playthings as you like.\" Many other similar remarks he added to\narrest her attention and to please her.\n\nHer fears gradually subsided, and as she kept looking on the handsome\nface of Genji, and taking notice of his kindness, she did not fall\nasleep for some time.\n\nWhen the night was advanced, and the hailstorm had passed away, Genji\nat last took his departure. The temperature now suddenly changed, and\nthe hail was lying white upon the grass. \"Can it be,\" thought he,\n\"that I am leaving this place as a lover?\" At that moment he\nremembered that the house of a maiden with whom he had had an\nacquaintance was on his road home. When he came near to it he ordered\none of his attendants to knock at the door. No one, however, came\nforth. Thereupon Genji turned to another, who had a remarkably good\nvoice, and ordered him to sing the following lines:--\n\n    \"Though wandering in the morning gray,\n      This gate is one I cannot pass,\n    A tender memory bids me stay\n      To see once more a pretty lass.\"\n\nThis was repeated twice, when presently a man came to the door and\nsang, in reply, as follows:--\n\n    \"If you cannot pass the gate,\n    Welcome all to stop and wait.\n    Nought prevents you. Do not fear,\n    For the gate stands always here.\"\n\nAnd then went in, slamming the door in their faces, and appearing no\nmore. Genji, therefore disappointed, proceeded on his way home.\n\nOn the morrow he took up his pen to write a letter to Violet, but\nfinding that he had nothing in particular to say, he laid it aside,\nand instead of a letter several beautiful pictures were sent for her.\n\nFrom this time Koremitz was sent there very often, partly to do them\nservice, and partly to watch over their movements. At last the time\nwhen the girl's father was to take her home approached within a night,\nand Shi\u00c3\u00b4nagon was busily occupied in sewing a dress for the girl, and\nwas thus consequently unable to take much notice of Koremitz when he\narrived. Noting these preparatory arrangements, Koremitz at once\nhastened to inform Genji about them. He happened to be this evening at\nthe mansion of Sadaijin, but Lady Aoi was not, as was often the case,\nwith him, and he was amusing himself there with thumping a _wagon_ as\nhe sang a \"Hitachi\" song. Koremitz presented himself before him, and\ngave him the latest information of what was going on.\n\nGenji, when he had listened to Koremitz, thought, \"This will never do;\nI must not lose her in this way. But the difficulty is indeed\nperplexing. If, on the one hand, she goes to her father, it will not\nbecome me to ask him for her. If, on the other hand, I carry her off,\npeople may say that I stole her. However, upon consideration, this\nlatter plan, if I can manage to shut people's mouths beforehand, will\nbe much better than that I should demand her from her father.\"\n\nSo, turning to Koremitz, he said, \"I must go there. See that the\ncarriage is ready at whatever hour I may appoint. Let two or three\nattendants be in readiness.\" Koremitz, having received these orders,\nretired.\n\nLong before dawn broke, Genji prepared to leave the mansion. Lady Aoi,\nas usual, was a little out of temper, but Genji told her that he had\nsome particular arrangements to make at his mansion at Niji\u00c3\u00b4, but that\nhe would soon return to her. He soon started, Koremitz alone following\nhim on horseback.\n\nOn their arrival Koremitz proceeded to a small private entrance and\nannounced himself. Shi\u00c3\u00b4nagon recognized his voice and came out, and\nupon this he informed her that the Prince had come. She, presuming\nthat he did so only because he happened to pass by them, said, \"What!\nat this late hour?\" As she spoke, Genji came up and said:--\n\n\"I hear that the little one is to go to the Prince, her father, and I\nwish to say a few words to her before she goes.\"\n\n\"She is asleep; really, I am afraid that she cannot talk with you at\nthis hour. Besides, what is the use?\" replied Shi\u00c3\u00b4nagon, with a smile.\n\nGenji, however, pressed his way into the house, saying:--\n\n\"Perhaps the girl is not awake yet, but I will awake her,\" and, as the\npeople could not prevent his doing so, he proceeded to the room where\nshe was unconsciously sleeping on a couch. He shook her gently. She\nstarted up, thinking it was her father who had come.\n\nGenji pushed the hair back from her face, as he said to her, \"I am\ncome from your father;\" but this she knew to be false, and was\nalarmed. \"Don't be frightened,\" said Genji; \"there is nothing in me to\nalarm you.\" And in spite of Shi\u00c3\u00b4nagon's request not to disturb her, he\nlifted her from the couch, abruptly saying that he could not allow her\nto go elsewhere, and that he had made up his mind that he himself\nwould be her guardian. He also said she should go with him, and that\nsome of them should go with her.\n\nShi\u00c3\u00b4nagon was thunderstruck. \"We are expecting her father to-morrow,\nand what are we to say to him?\" She added, \"Surely, you can find some\nbetter opportunity to manage matters than this.\"\n\n\"All right, you can come afterward; we will go first,\" retorted Genji,\nas he ordered his carriage to drive up.\n\nShi\u00c3\u00b4nagon was perplexed, and Violet also cried, thinking how strange\nall this was. At last Shi\u00c3\u00b4nagon saw it was no use to resist, and so\nhaving hurriedly changed her own dress for a better one, and taking\nwith her the pretty dress of Violet which she had been making in the\nevening, got into the carriage, where Genji had already placed the\nlittle one.\n\nIt was no great distance to Niji\u00c3\u00b4, and they arrived there before dawn.\nThe carriage was driven up to the western wing of the mansion. To\nShi\u00c3\u00b4nagon the whole affair seemed like a dream. \"What am I to do?\" she\nsaid to Genji, who teasingly answered, \"What you choose. You may go if\nyou like; so long as this darling is here I am content.\" Genji lifted\nthe girl out and carried her into the house. That part of the mansion\nin which they now were, had not been inhabited, and the furniture was\nscanty and inappropriate; so, calling Koremitz, the Prince ordered him\nto see that proper furniture was brought. The beds were therefore\ntaken from the eastern wing, where he himself lived.\n\nDay broke, and Shi\u00c3\u00b4nagon surveyed with admiration all the magnificence\nwith which she was surrounded. Both the exterior of the building and\nits internal arrangements left nothing to be desired. Going to the\ncasement, she saw the gravelled walks flashing brightly in the sun.\n\"Ah,\" thought she, \"where am I amidst all this splendor? This is too\ngrand for me!\"\n\nBath water for their ablutions, and rice soup were now brought into\nthe apartment, and Genji afterward made his appearance.\n\n\"What! no attendants? No one to play with the girl? I will send some,\"\nand he then ordered some young persons from the eastern wing of the\nmansion. Four accordingly came.\n\nViolet was still fast asleep in her night-dress, and now Genji gently\nshook and woke her. \"Do not be frightened any more,\" he said quietly\nto her; \"a good girl would not be so, but would know that it is best\nto be obedient.\" She became more and more pleasing to him, and he\ntried to please her by presenting to her a variety of pretty pictures\nand playthings, and by consulting her wishes in whatever she desired.\nShe was still wearing the dress of mourning, of sombre color and of\nsoft material, and it was only now at last that she began to smile a\nlittle, and this filled Genji with delight. He now had to return to\nthe eastern wing, and Violet, for the first time, went to the casement\nand looked out on the scenery around. The trees covered with foliage,\na small lake, and the plantations round about expanded before her as\nin a picture. Here and there young people were going in and out. \"Ah!\nwhat a pretty place,\" she exclaimed, charmed as she gazed around.\nThen, turning again into the apartment, she saw beautiful pictures\npainted on the screens and walls, which could not but please her.\n\nGenji did not go to the Palace for two or three days, but spent his\ntime in trying to train Violet. \"She must soon take lessons in\nwriting,\" he thought, and he wrote several writing copies for her.\nAmong these was one in plain characters on violet-colored paper, with\nthe title, \"Musashi-no\" (The field of Musashi is known for its\nviolets). She took it up, and in handwriting plain and clear though\nsmall, she found the following:\n\n    Though still a bud the violet be,\n      A still unopened blossom here,\n    Its tenderness has charms for me,\n      Recalling one no longer near.\n\n\"Come, _you_ must write one now,\" said Genji.\n\n\"I cannot write well enough,\" said Violet, looking up at him, with an\nextremely charming look.\n\n\"Never mind, whether good or bad,\" said he, \"but still write\nsomething, to refuse is unkind. When there is any difficulty I will\nhelp you through with it.\"\n\nThereupon she turned aside shyly and wrote something, handling the pen\ngracefully with her tiny fingers. \"I have done it badly,\" she cried\nout, and tried to conceal what she had written, but Genji insisted on\nseeing it and found the following:--\n\n     I wonder what's the floweret's name,\n     From which that bud its charm may claim!\n\nThis was, of course, written in a childish hand, but the writing was\nlarge and plain, giving promise of future excellence.\n\n\"How like her grandmother's it is,\" thought Genji. \"Were she to take\nlessons from a good professor she might become a master of the art.\"\n\nHe ordered for her a beautiful doll's house, and played with her\ndifferent innocent and amusing games.\n\nIn the meantime, the Prince, her father, had duly arrived at the old\nhome of Violet and asked for her. The servants were embarrassed, but\nas they had been requested by Genji not to tell, and as Shi\u00c3\u00b4nagon had\nalso enjoined them to keep silence, they simply told him that the\nnurse had taken her and absconded. The Prince was greatly amazed, but\nhe remembered that the girl's grandmother never consented to send his\ndaughter to his house, and knowing Shi\u00c3\u00b4nagon to be a shrewd and\nintelligent woman, he concluded that she had found out the reasons\nwhich influenced her, and that so out of respect to her, and out of\ndislike to tell him the reason of it, she had carried the girl off in\norder that she might be kept away from him. He therefore merely told\nthe servants to inform him at once if they heard anything about them,\nand he returned home.\n\nOur story again brings us back to Niji\u00c3\u00b4. The girl gradually became\nreconciled to her new home, as she was most kindly treated by Genji.\nTrue, during those evenings when Genji was absent she thought of her\ndead grandmother, but the image of her father never presented itself\nto her, as she had seldom seen him. And now, naturally enough, Genji,\nwhom she had learned to look upon as a second father, was the only one\nfor whom she cared. She was the first to greet him when he came home,\nand she came forward to be fondled and caressed by him without shame\nor diffidence. Girls at her age are usually shy and under restraint,\nbut with her it was quite different. And again, if a girl has somewhat\nof jealousy in her disposition, and looks upon every little trifle in\na serious light, a man will have to be cautious in his dealings with\nher, and she herself, too, will often have to undergo vexation. Thus\nmany disagreeable and unexpected incidents might often result. In the\ncase of Violet, however, things were very different, and she was ever\namiable and invariably pleasant.\n\nFOOTNOTES:\n\n[Footnote 61: An Indian theological writing.]\n\n[Footnote 62: In the Buddhist Bible it is stated that there is in\nParadise a divine tree, called Udon, which rarely blossoms.

Her attractive nature, thoughtfulness, and\npatient manner had seemed to him surpassingly charming. At last he\nbegan to think of seeking for some other maiden who might resemble her\nin these qualities. True, his thoughts had often reverted to Cicada,\nand to her young friend; but it was now of little use thinking of\nthem, for one had gone to the country, and the other was married.\n\nNow, Genji had another nurse, next in degree to Daini. The daughter of\nthis nurse, Tay\u00c3\u00bb-no-Mi\u00c3\u00b4bu, was in Court service. She was still young,\nand full of mirth and life. Genji was wont to make her useful when in\nthe palace. Her father, who had been remotely connected with the Royal\nblood, was an official in the War Department. Her mother, however, had\nbeen married again to the Governor of the province of Chikzen, and had\ngone there with her husband; so Tay\u00c3\u00bb made her father's house her home,\nand went from there backwards and forwards to the palace. She was an\nintimate acquaintance of a young Princess, the daughter of the late\nLord-Lieutenant of Hitachi, and she had been the child of his old age,\nand was at this time his survivor. The life that she passed was\nsomewhat lonely, and her circumstances miserable. Tay\u00c3\u00bb mentioned this\nyoung lady to Genji, who exclaimed:--\n\n\"How sad! Tell me all about her.\"\n\n\"I cannot say that I know so much about her,\" replied Tay\u00c3\u00bb. \"She leads\na very retired life, and is seldom seen in society. Perhaps, some\nfavorable evening, you might see her from a hiding-place. The _koto_\nis her favorite instrument, and the favorite amusement of her\nsolitude.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" said Genji, \"I see, one of the three friends (as the Chinese\npoets call them)--Music, Poetry, and Wine; but, of the other two, one\nis not always a good friend.\" And he added, \"Well, you may manage some\ntime to let me hear her _koto_. The Prince, her father, had great\ntaste and reputation in such arts; so, I believe, she is no ordinary\nperformer.\"\n\n\"But, perhaps, after all, not so good as you imagine,\" replied Tay\u00c3\u00bb,\ndisingenuously.\n\n\"Oh! that remains to be discovered,\" cried Genji, nibbling at the\nbait. \"One of these evenings I will come, and you had better be there\nalso.\"\n\nNow, the home of Tay\u00c3\u00bb's father was at some distance from the\nPrincess's mansion; but Tay\u00c3\u00bb used to spend her time very often with\nthe Princess, when she had leave of absence from the Court, chiefly\nbecause she did not like being at home with her stepmother. For this\nreason Tay\u00c3\u00bb had plenty of chances for gratifying the wish of Genji to\nsee the Princess; so a certain evening was appointed.\n\nIt was a sweet balmy day in spring, and the grounds of the palace were\nfull of silence and repose. Tay\u00c3\u00bb left the palace, and proceeded to the\nmansion of the Princess, attracted more by the beauty of the evening\nthan by the appointment made. Genji also appeared on the scene, with\nthe newly risen moon, and was soon prattling with Tay\u00c3\u00bb.\n\n\"You have not come at a very favorable time,\" said she. \"This is not\nthe sort of evening when the _koto_ sounds sweetest.\"\n\n\"But take me somewhere, so that I may hear her voice. I cannot go away\nwithout hearing that.\"\n\nTay\u00c3\u00bb then led him into a private room, where she made him sit down,\nand left him, saying, as she went away, \"I am sorry to make you wait,\nbut you must have a little patience.\" She proceeded to another part of\nthe palace occupied by the Princess, whom she found sitting pensively\nnear an open casement, inhaling the rich perfume of the plum blossoms.\n\n\"A good opportunity,\" thought Tay\u00c3\u00bb; and, advancing to the Princess,\nsaid: \"What a lovely evening! How sweet at such an hour is the music\nof the _koto_! My official going to and fro to the palace prevents me\nfrom having the pleasure of hearing it often; so do now, if you\nplease, play me a tune.\"\n\n\"You appreciate music,\" said the Princess; \"but I am afraid that mine\nis not good enough to charm the ear of courtiers; but, if you wish it,\nI will play one tune.\" And she ordered the _koto_ to be brought, and\nbegan to strike it. Her skill was certainly not super-excellent; but\nshe had been well instructed, and the effect was by no means\ndispleasing to the ear.\n\nTay\u00c3\u00bb, however, it must be remembered, was rather a sharp girl. She did\nnot like Genji to hear too much, so as to criticise; and, therefore,\nsaid to the Princess, casting a glance upwards, \"How changed and dull\nthe sky has become. A friend of mine is waiting; and is, perhaps,\nimpatient. I must have more of this pleasure some other time; at\npresent I must go and see him.\" Thus she caused the Princess to cease\nplaying, and went to Genji, who exclaimed, when she returned, \"Her\nmusic seems pretty good; but I had better not have heard it at all.\nHow can we judge by so little? If you are willing to oblige me at all,\nlet me hear and see more closely than this.\" Tay\u00c3\u00bb made a difficulty.\n\"She is so retiring,\" she said, \"and always keeps herself in the\nstrictest privacy. Were you to intrude upon her, it would not be\nacting rightly.\"\n\n\"Truly so,\" replied Genji; \"her position insures her from intrusion.\nLet us, then, seek for some better opportunity.\" And then he prepared\nto take leave, as if he had some other affairs on his hands. Tay\u00c3\u00bb\nobserved, with a knowing smile, \"The Emperor, your father, always\nthinks of you as quite guileless, and actually says so. When I hear\nthese remarks I often laugh in my sleeve. Were his Majesty to see you\nin these disguises, what would he then think?\"\n\nGenji answered, with a slight laugh: \"Nonsense! If these trifling\namusements were thought so improper, how cheerless the life of woman\nwould be!\"\n\nTay\u00c3\u00bb made no remark in reply; so Genji then left the house, and took a\nstroll round the garden, intending to reach that part of the mansion\nwhere the Princess had her apartments. As he sauntered along, he came\nto a thick hedge, in which there was a dark bower, and here wished to\nstop awhile. He stepped cautiously into it, when he suddenly perceived\na tall man concealed there. \"Who can this be?\" thought Genji, as he\nwithdrew to a corner where the moonlight did not reach. This was\nT\u00c3\u00b4-no-Chi\u00c3\u00bbji\u00c3\u00b4, and the reason of his being there was this:\n\nHe had left the Palace that evening in company with Genji, who did not\ngo to his house in Niji\u00c3\u00b4, nor to his bride, but separated from him on\nthe road. T\u00c3\u00b4-no-Chi\u00c3\u00bbji\u00c3\u00b4 was very anxious to find out where Genji was\ngoing. He therefore followed him unperceived. When he saw Genji enter\nthe mansion of the Princess, he wished to see how the business would\nend; so he waited in the garden, in order that he might witness\nGenji's departure, listening, at the same time, to the _koto_ of the\nPrincess. Genji did not know who the man was, nor did he wish to be\nrecognized. He therefore began to retreat slowly on tip-toe, when\nT\u00c3\u00b4-no-Chi\u00c3\u00bbji\u00c3\u00b4 came up to him from behind, and addressed him: \"You\nslighted me, but I have come to watch over you:--\n\n    Though like two wandering moons on high\n      We left our vast imperial home,\n    We parted on our road, and I\n      Knew not where you were bent to roam.\"\n\nGenji at once recognized his companion; and, being somewhat amused at\nhis pertinacity, exclaimed: \"What an unexpected surprise!\n\n    We all admire the moon, 'tis true,\n      Whose home unknown to mortal eye\n    Is in the mountains hid, but who\n      To find that far-off home, would try?\"\n\nHereupon T\u00c3\u00b4-no-Chi\u00c3\u00bbji\u00c3\u00b4 gave him a taunt: \"What would you do,\" said he,\n\"if I were to follow you very often? Were you to maintain true\npropriety in your position, you ought always to have trustworthy\nattendants; and I am sure, by so doing, you will meet with better\nfortune. I cannot say that it is very decorous of you to go wandering\nabout in such a fashion. It is too frivolous!\"\n\n\"How very tiresome!\" mentally exclaimed Genji; \"but he little knows\nabout his Nadeshiko (little darling). I have him there!\"\n\nNeither of them ventured to go to any other rendezvous that night;\nbut, with many mutual home-thrusts, they got into a carriage together,\nand proceeded home, amusing themselves all the way with a duet on\ntheir flutes. Entering the mansion, they went to a small apartment,\nwhere they changed their dresses, and commenced playing the flutes in\nsuch a manner as if they had come from the Palace. The Sadaijin,\nhearing this music, could not forbear joining them, and blew skilfully\na Corean flute in concert with theirs. Lady Aoi, also, in her room,\ncatching the impulse, ordered some practised players on the _koto_ to\nperform.\n\nMeantime, both Genji and T\u00c3\u00b4-no-Chi\u00c3\u00bbji\u00c3\u00b4, in their secret minds, were\nthinking of the notes of the _koto_ heard before on that evening, and\nof the bare and pitiable condition of the residence of the Princess\nwhom they had left--a great contrast to the luxury of their present\nquarters. T\u00c3\u00b4-no-Chi\u00c3\u00bbji\u00c3\u00b4's idea about her took something of this shape:\n\"If girls who, from a modest propriety, keep themselves aloof for\nyears from our society, were at last to be subdued by our attentions,\nour affection for them would become irresistible, even braving\nwhatever remarks popular scandal might pass upon us. She may be like\none of these. The Prince Genji seems to have made her the object of\nsome attentions. He is not one to waste his time without reason. He\nknows what he is doing.\"\n\nAs these thoughts arose in his mind, a slight feeling of jealousy\ndisturbed him, and made him ready to dare a little rivalry in that\nquarter; for, it would appear, that after this day amatory letters\nwere often sent both by him and Genji to the Princess, who, however,\nreturned no answer to either.\n\nThis silence on her part made T\u00c3\u00b4-no-Chi\u00c3\u00bbji\u00c3\u00b4, more especially, think\nthus: \"A strange rejection; and from one, too, who possesses such a\nsecluded life. True, her birth is high; but that cannot be the only\nreason which makes her bury herself in retirement. There must be some\nstronger reason, I presume.\"\n\nAs we have before mentioned, Genji and T\u00c3\u00b4-no-Chi\u00c3\u00bbji\u00c3\u00b4 were so intimate\nthat all ceremony was dispensed with between them, and they could ask\neach other any question without reserve. From this circumstance\nT\u00c3\u00b4-no-Chi\u00c3\u00bbji\u00c3\u00b4 one day boldly inquired of Genji: \"I dare say you have\nreceived some replies from the Princess. Have you not? I for my part\nhave thrown out some hints in that quarter by way of experiment, but I\ngave up in disappointment.\"\n\n\"Ah, then, he too has been trying there,\" thought Genji, smiling\nslightly, and he replied very vaguely, \"I am not particularly\nconcerned whether I get an answer or not, therefore I cannot tell you\nwhether I have received any.\"\n\n\"I understand that,\" thought T\u00c3\u00b4-no-Chi\u00c3\u00bbji\u00c3\u00b4; \"perhaps he has got one; I\nsuspect so.\"\n\nTo state the truth, Genji was not very deeply smitten by the Princess,\nand he was but little concerned at her sending no reply to his letter;\nbut when he heard the confession of his brother-in-law's attempts in\nthe same quarter, the spirit of rivalry stirred him once more. \"A\ngirl,\" thought he, \"will yield to him who pays her the most\nattentions. I must not allow him to excel me in that.\" And Genji\ndetermined to achieve what he intended to do, and with this object\nstill enlisted the aid of Tay\u00c3\u00bb. He told her that the Princess's\ntreating his letter with such indifference was an act of great\ncruelty. \"Perhaps she does this,\" said he, \"because she suspects I am\nchangeable. I am not, however, such a one as that. It is often only\nthe fault of ladies themselves that causes men to appear so; besides a\nlady, like the Princess, who has neither parent nor brother to\ninterfere with her, is a most desirable acquaintance, as we can\nmaintain our friendship far better than we could otherwise do.\"\n\n\"Yes! what you say is all very well,\" replied Tay\u00c3\u00bb, \"but the Princess\nis not exactly so placed that any one can make himself quite at ease\nwith her. As I told you before she is very bashful and reserved; but\nyet is perhaps more desirable for this very reason,\" and she detailed\nmany more particulars about her. This enabled Genji to fully picture\nthe general bearing of the Princess's character; and he thought,\n\"Perhaps her mind is not one of brilliant activity, but she may be\nmodest, and of a quiet nature, worthy of attention.\" And so he kept\nthe recollection of her alive in his mind. Before, however, he met\nher, many events had taken place. He had been attacked by the ague,\nwhich led to his journey to the mountain and his discovery of Violet,\nand his secret affection for a certain one in the palace.\n\nHis mind being thus otherwise occupied, the spring and summer passed\naway without anything further transpiring about the Princess. As the\nautumn advanced his thoughts recurred to past times, and even the\nsound of the fuller's hammer, which he had listened to in the home of\nY\u00c3\u00bbgao, came back to his mental ear; and these reveries again brought\nhim to the recollection of the Princess Hitachi, and now once more he\nbegan to urge Tay\u00c3\u00bb to contrive a meeting.\n\nIt would seem that there was no difficulty for Tay\u00c3\u00bb to bring the\nmatter about, but at the same time no one knew better than herself\nthat the natural gifts and culture of the Princess were far from\ncoming up to Genji's standard. She thought, however, that it would\nmatter very little if he did not care for her, but if, on the other\nhand, he did so, he was quite free to come and see her without any\ninterference. For this reason she at last made up her mind to bring\nthem together, and she gave several hints to the Princess.\n\nNow it so happened towards the end of August that Tay\u00c3\u00bb was on one\noccasion engaged in conversing with the Princess. The evening was as\nyet moonless, the stars alone twinkled in the heavens, and the gentle\nwinds blew plaintively over the tall trees around the mansion. The\nconversation gradually led to times gone by, and the Princess was\nrendered sad by the contrast of her present circumstances with those\nof her father's time. \"This is a good opportunity,\" thought Tay\u00c3\u00bb, and\nshe sent, it seems, a message to Genji, who soon hastened to the\nmansion with his usual alacrity. At the moment when he arrived on the\nscene the long-looked-for moon had just made her appearance over the\ntops of a distant mountain, and as he looked along the wildly growing\nhedges around the residence, he heard the sound of the _koto_, which\nwas being played by the Princess at Tay\u00c3\u00bb's request. It sounded a\nlittle too old-fashioned, but that was of no consequence to the eager\nears of the Prince. He soon made his way to the entrance, and\nrequested a domestic to announce him to Tay\u00c3\u00bb.\n\nWhen the latter heard of this she affected great surprise, and said to\nthe Princess, \"The Prince has come. How annoying! He has often been\ndispleased because I have not yet introduced him to you. I have often\ntold him that you do not particularly like it, and therefore I cannot\nthink what makes him come here. I had better see him and send him\naway, but what shall I say. We cannot treat him like an ordinary\nperson. I am really puzzled what to do. Will you not let me ask you if\nyou will see him for a few minutes, then all matters will end\nsatisfactorily?\"\n\n\"But I am not used to receive people,\" said the Princess, blushing.\n\"How simple minded!\" rejoined Tay\u00c3\u00bb, coaxingly, \"I am sorry for that,\nfor the bashfulness of young ladies who are under the care of their\nparents may sometimes be even desirable, but how then is that parallel\nwith your case? Besides, I do not see any good in a friendless maiden\nrefusing the offer of a good acquaintance.\"\n\n\"Well, if you really insist upon it,\" said the Princess, \"perhaps I\nwill; but don't expose me too much to the gaze of a stranger.\"\n\nHaving thus cunningly persuaded the Princess, Tay\u00c3\u00bb set the\nreception-room in order, into which Genji was soon shown. The Princess\nwas all the while experiencing much nervousness, and as she did not\nknow exactly how to manage, she left everything to Tay\u00c3\u00bb, and was led\nby her to the room to receive her visitor. The room was arranged in\nsuch a way that the Princess had her back to the light so that her\nface and emotions could be obscured.\n\nThe perfume which she used was rich, still preserving the trait of\nhigh birth, but her demeanor was timid, and her deportment awkward.\n\nGenji at once noticed this. \"Just as I imagined. She is so simple,\"\nthought he, and then he commenced to talk with her, and to explain how\npassionately he had desired to see her. She, however, listened to him\nalmost in silence, and gave no plain answer. Genji was disconcerted,\nand at last said,\n\n    \"From you I sought so oft reply,\n      But you to give one would not deign,\n    If you discard me, speak, and I\n      Will cease to trouble you again.\"\n\nThe governess of the Princess, Kojiji\u00c3\u00bb by name, who was present, was a\nsagacious woman, and noticing the embarrassment of the lady, she\nadvanced to her side, and made the following reply in such a\nwell-timed manner that her real object, which was to conceal the\ndeficiencies of her mistress, did not betray itself--\n\n    \"Not by the ringing of a bell,\n      Your words we wish to stay;\n    But simply, she has nought to tell,\n      And nothing much to say.\"\n\n\"Your eloquence has so struck me that my mouth is almost closed,\" said\nGenji, smiling--\n\n    \"Not speaking is a wiser part,\n      And words are sometimes vain,\n    But to completely close the heart\n      In silence, gives me pain.\"\n\nHe then tried to speak of this thing and that indifferently, but all\nhopes of agreeable responsiveness on the lady's part being vain, he\ncoolly took his leave, and left the mansion, much disappointed.\n\nThis evening he slept in his mansion at Niji\u00c3\u00b4. The next morning\nT\u00c3\u00b4-no-Chi\u00c3\u00bbji\u00c3\u00b4 appeared before he had risen.\n\n\"How late, how late!\" he cried, in a peculiar tone. \"Were you fatigued\nlast night, eh?\"\n\nGenji rose and presently came out, saying, \"I have overslept myself,\nthat is all; nothing to disturb me. But have you come from the palace?\nWas it your official watch-night?\"[65]\n\n\"Yes,\" replied T\u00c3\u00b4-no-Chi\u00c3\u00bbji\u00c3\u00b4, \"and I must inform you that the dancers\nand musicians for the _f\u00c3\u00aate_ in Suzak-in are to be nominated to-day. I\ncame from the palace to report this to my father, so I must now go\nhome, but I will soon return to you.\"\n\n\"I will go with you,\" said Genji, \"but let us breakfast before we\nstart.\"\n\nBreakfast was accordingly brought, of which they partook. Two\ncarriages, Genji's and T\u00c3\u00b4-no-Chi\u00c3\u00bbji\u00c3\u00b4's, were driven to the door, but\nT\u00c3\u00b4-no-Chi\u00c3\u00bbji\u00c3\u00b4 invited the Prince to take a seat with him. Genji\ncomplied, and they drove off. Going along T\u00c3\u00b4-no-Chi\u00c3\u00bbji\u00c3\u00b4 observed with\nan envious tone in his voice, \"You look very sleepy;\" to which Genji\nreturned an indifferent reply. From the house of Sadaijin they\nproceeded to the Imperial Palace to attend the selection of the\ndancers and musicians. Thence Genji drove with his father-in-law to\nthe mansion of the latter.\n\nHere in the excitement of the coming _f\u00c3\u00aate_ were assembled several\nyoung nobles, in addition to Genji himself. Some practised dancing,\nothers music, the sound of which echoed everywhere around. A large\n_hichiriki_ and a _shakuhachi_ (two kinds of flute) were blown with\nthe utmost vigor. Even large drums were rolled upon a balcony and\nbeaten with a will.\n\nDuring the following days, therefore, Genji was so busily engaged that\nno thought came across his mind of revisiting the Princess Hitachi.\nTay\u00c3\u00bb certainly came now and then, and strove to induce him to pay the\nPrincess another visit, but he made an excuse on the pretext of being\nso much occupied.\n\nIt was not until the _f\u00c3\u00aate_ was over that one evening he resolved to\npay a visit there. He did not, however, announce his intention openly,\nbut went there in strict secrecy, making his way to the house\nunobserved, as there was no one about.\n\nOn his arrival he went up to the latticed window and peeped through.\nThe curtains were old and half worn out, yet were still left to hang\nin the once pretty and decorated chamber. There were a few domestic\nmaidens there partaking of supper. The table and service seemed to be\nold Chinese, but everything else betrayed a scantiness of furniture.\n\nIn the further room where the mistress was probably dining, an old\nwaitress was passing in and out, wearing a peculiar white dress rather\nfaded in appearance, and an awkward-looking comb in her hair, after\nthe old-fashioned style of those formerly in the service of the\naristocratic class, of whom a few might still be retained in a family.\n\n\"Ah,\" thought Genji, smiling, \"we might see this kind of thing in the\ncollege of ceremonies.\" One of the maids happened to say, \"This poor\ncold place! when one's life is too long, such fate comes to us.\"\nAnother answered her, \"How was it we did not like the mansion when the\nlate Prince was living?\"\n\nThus they talked about one thing or another connected with their\nmistress's want of means.\n\nGenji did not like that they should know that he had seen and heard\nall this, so he slyly withdrew some distance, and then advancing with\na firm step, approached the door and knocked.\n\n\"Some one is come,\" cried a servant, who then brought a light, opened\nthe door, and showed him into a room where he was soon joined by the\nPrincess, neither Tay\u00c3\u00bb nor Kojiji\u00c3\u00bb being there on this occasion. The\nlatter was acquainted with the Saiin (the sacred virgin at the Temple\nof Kamo),[66] and often spent some time with her. On this occasion she\nhappened to be visiting her, a circumstance which was not very\nconvenient for the Princess. The dilapidated state of the mansion was\njust as novel to Genji as that which he had seen in the lodge of\nY\u00c3\u00bbgao, but the great drawback consisted in the Princess's want of\nresponsiveness. He spoke much, she but little. Outside, in the\nmeantime, the weather had become boisterous and snow fell thickly,\nwhile within in the room where they sat the lamp burned dimly, no one\nwaiting there even to trim the light.\n\nSome hours were spent between them, and then Genji rose, and throwing\nup the shutter in the same way as he did in the lodge of Y\u00c3\u00bbgao, looked\nupon the snow which had fallen in the garden. The ground was covered\nwith a sheet of pure whiteness; no footstep had left its trace,\nbetraying the fact that few persons came to the mansion. He was about\nto take his departure, but some vague impulse arrested him. Turning to\nthe Princess, he asked her to come near him, and to look out on the\nscene, and she somewhat unreadily complied.\n\nThe evening was far advanced, but the reflection of the snow threw a\nfaint light over all. Now, for the first time, he discovered the\nimperfections of the personal attractions of the Princess. First, her\nstature was very tall, the upper part of her figure being out of\nproportion to the lower, then one thing which startled him most was\nher nose. It reminded him of the elephant of Fugen. It was high and\nlong; while its peak, a little drooping, was tinged with pink. To the\nrefined eyes of Genji this was a sad defect. Moreover, she was thin,\ntoo thin; and her shoulders drooped too much, as if the dress was too\nheavy for them.\n\n\"Why am I so anxious to examine and criticise?\" thought Genji, but his\ncuriosity impelled him to continue his examination. Her hair and the\nshape of her head were good, in no way inferior to those of others he\nliked so well. Her complexion was fair, and her forehead well\ndeveloped. The train of her dress, which hung down gracefully, seemed\nabout a foot too long. If I described everything which she wore I\nshould become loquacious, but in old stories the dress of the\npersonages is very often more minutely described than anything else;\nso I must, I suppose, do the same. Her vest and skirt dress were\ndouble, and were of light green silk, a little worn, over which was a\nrobe of dark color. Over all this she wore a mantle of sable of good\nquality, only a little too antique in fashion. To all these things,\ntherefore, he felt no strong objection; but the two things he could\nnot pass unnoticed were her nose, and her style of movement. She moved\nin a stiff and constrained manner, like a master of the ceremonies in\nsome Court procession, spreading out his arms and looking important.\nThis afforded him amusement, but still he felt for her. \"If I say too\nmuch, pardon me,\" said Genji, \"but you seem apparently friendless. I\nshould advise you to take interest in one with whom you have made\nacquaintance. He will sympathize with you. You are much too reserved.\nWhy are you so?\n\n    The icicle hangs at the gable end,\n      But melts when the sun is high,\n    Why does your heart not to me unbend,\n      And warm to my melting sigh.\"\n\nA smile passed over the lips of the Princess, but they seemed too\nstiff to reply in a similar strain. She said nothing.\n\nThe time had now come for Genji to depart. His carriage was drawn up\nto the middle gate, which, like everything else that belonged to the\nmansion, was in a state of dilapidation. \"The spot overgrown with wild\nvegetation, spoken of by Sama-no-Kami might be such as this,\" he\nthought. \"If one can find a real beauty of elevated character and\nobtain her, how delightful would it not be! The spot answers the\ndescription, but the girl does not quite equal the idea; however, I\nreally pity her, and will look after her. She is a fortunate girl, for\nif I were not such a one as I am, I should have little sympathy for\nthe unfortunate and unfavored. But this is not what I shall do.\"\n\nHe saw an orange tree in the garden covered with snow. He bade his\nservant shake it free. A pine tree which stood close by suddenly\njerked its branches as if in emulation of its neighbor, and threw off\nits load of snow like a wave. The gate through which he had to drive\nout was not yet opened. The gatekeeper was summoned to open it.\nThereupon an aged man came forth from his lodge. A miserable-looking\ngirl with a pinched countenance stood by, his daughter or his\ngranddaughter, whose dress looked poorer from the whiteness of the\nsurrounding snow. She had something containing lighted charcoal which\nshe held to her breast for warmth.\n\nWhen she observed that her aged parent could scarcely push back the\ngate, she came forward and helped him. And the scene was quite droll.\nGenji's servant also approached them, and the gates were thrown open.\n\nAgain Genji hummed:--\n\n    \"The one who on the time-bent head of age,\n      Beholds the gathered snow,\n    Nor less his tears of grief may shed,\n      For griefs that youth can only know.\"\n\nand added, \"Youth with its body uncovered.\"[67] Then the pitiable\nimage of one with a tinged flower[68] on her face presented itself\nonce more to his thoughts and made him smile.\n\n\"If T\u00c3\u00b4-no-Chi\u00c3\u00bbji\u00c3\u00b4 observed this, what would he not have to say?\"\nthought he, as he drove back slowly to his mansion.\n\nAfter this time communications were frequently sent from Genji to the\nPrincess. This he did because he pitied the helpless condition and\ncircumstances he had witnessed more than for any other reason. He also\nsent her rolls of silk, which might replace the old-fashioned\nsable-skins, some damask, calico and the like. Indeed, presents were\nmade even to her aged servants and to the gatekeeper.\n\nIn ordinary circumstances with women, particular attention such as\nthis might make a blush, but the Princess did not take it in such a\nserious light, nor did Genji do this from any other motive than\nkindness.\n\nThe year approached its end! He was in his apartment in the Imperial\nPalace, when one morning Tay\u00c3\u00bb came in. She was very useful to him in\nsmall services, such as hairdressing, so she had easy access to him,\nand thus she came to him this morning.\n\n\"I have something strange to tell you, but it is somewhat trying for\nme to do so,\" she said, half smiling.\n\n\"What can it be? There can be nothing to conceal from me!\"\n\n\"But I have some reason for my hesitation to reveal it,\" replied Tay\u00c3\u00bb.\n\n\"You make a difficulty, as usual,\" rejoined Genji.\n\n\"This is from the Princess,\" she said, taking a letter from her pocket\nand presenting it.\n\n\"Is this a thing of all others that you ought to conceal,\" cried\nGenji, taking the letter and opening it. It was written on thick and\ncoarse paper of Michinok manufacture. The verse it contained ran as\nfollows:--\n\n    \"Like this, my sleeves are worn away,\n    By weeping at your long delay.\"\n\nThese words puzzled Genji. Inclining his head in a contemplative way,\nhe glanced from the paper to Tay\u00c3\u00bb, and from Tay\u00c3\u00bb to the paper. Then\nshe drew forth a substantial case of antique pattern, saying, \"I\ncannot produce such a thing without shame, but the Princess expressly\nsent this for your New Year. I could not return it to her nor keep it\nmyself; I hope you will just look at it.\"\n\n\"Oh, certainly,\" replied Genji. \"It is very kind of her,\" at the same\ntime thinking, \"What a pitiful verse! This may really be her own\ncomposition. No doubt Kojiji\u00c3\u00bb has been absent, besides she seems to\nhave had no master to improve her penmanship. This must have been\nwritten with great effort. We ought to be grateful for it, as they\nsay.\" Here a smile rose on Genji's cheeks, and a blush upon Tay\u00c3\u00bb's.\nThe case was opened, and a Naoshi (a kind of gown), of scarlet, shabby\nand old-fashioned, of the same color on both sides, was found inside.\nThe sight was almost too much for Genji from its very absurdity. He\nstretched out the paper on which the verse had been written, and began\nto write on one side, as if he was merely playing with the pen. Tay\u00c3\u00bb,\nglancing slyly, found that he had written:--\n\n    This color pleases not mine eye,\n      Too fiery bright its gaudy hue,\n    And when the saffron flower was nigh,\n      The same pink tinge was plain to view.\n\nHe then erased what he had written, but Tay\u00c3\u00bb quickly understood what\nhe really meant by \"saffron flower,\" referring to the pinkness of its\nflower, so she remarked:--\n\n    \"Although the dress too bright in hue,\n      And scarlet tints may please you not,\n    At least to her, who sends, be true,\n      Soon will Naoshi be forgot.\"\n\nWhile they were thus prattling on the matter, people were entering the\nroom to see him, so Genji hastily put the things aside, and Tay\u00c3\u00bb\nretired.\n\nA few days after, Genji one morning looked into the Daihan-sho (large\nparlor), where he found Tay\u00c3\u00bb, and threw a letter to her, saying,\n\"Tay\u00c3\u00bb, here is the answer. It has cost me some pains,\" and then passed\nthrough, humming as he went, with a peculiar smile,\n\n    \"Like that scarlet-tinged plum.\"\n\nNone but Tay\u00c3\u00bb understood the real allusion. One of the women observed,\n\"The weather is too frosty, perhaps he has seen some one reddened by\nthe frost.\" Another said, \"What an absurdity! There is no one among us\nof that hue, but perhaps Sakon or Unem\u00c3\u00a9 may be like this,\" and thus\nthey chattered on till the matter dropped.\n\nThe letter was soon sent by Tay\u00c3\u00bb to the Princess, who assembled all\nher attendants round her, and they all read it together, when the\nfollowing was found in it:--\n\n    Of my rare visits you complain,\n      But can the meaning be,\n    Pray come not often, nor again,\n      For I am tired of thee.\n\nOn the last day of the year he made the following presents to the\nPrincess, sending them in the same case as the Naoshi had been sent to\nhim: stuff for a complete dress, which had originally been presented\nto himself; also rolls of silk, one of the color of the purple grape,\nanother of the Kerria japonica color, and others. All these were\nhanded to the Princess by Tay\u00c3\u00bb. It should be observed that these\npresents were made by Genji to the Princess chiefly on account of her\nreduced circumstances. Her attendants, however, who wished to flatter\ntheir mistress, exclaimed, \"Our scarlet dress was very good, too.\nScarlet is a color which never fades. The lines we sent were also\nexcellent. Those of the Prince are, no doubt, a little amusing, but\nnothing more.\"\n\nThe Princess, flattered by the remarks, wrote down her verse in her\nalbum, as if worthy of preservation.\n\nThe New Year began with the morrow; and it was announced that the\nOtoko-d\u00c3\u00b4ka (gentlemen's singing dances) would soon take place in which\nGenji would take part. Hence he was busy in going backwards and\nforwards, to practise, but the lonely residence of the saffron flower\nbegan to draw his thoughts in that direction. So after the ceremony of\nthe State Festival, on the seventh day, he betook himself there in the\nevening, after he had left the Emperor's presence, having made a\npretence of retiring to his own private apartments. On this occasion\nthe appearance of the lady happened to be a little more attractive,\nand Genji was pleased, thinking there might be a time when she would\nimprove still more. When the sun shone forth he rose to leave. He\nopened the casement on the western side of the mansion, and, looking\nat the corridor, perceived that its roof was broken. Through it the\nsunshine peeped, and shone upon the slight cover of snow scattered in\nthe crevices. The scene, as we have before said, betrayed everywhere\ndilapidation and decay.\n\nThe mirror-stand, combs, and dressing-case were brought in by an\nattendant. They were all of an extremely antique pattern. He drew an\n\"arm-stool\" near him, and resting himself upon it began combing his\nhair. He was amused at the sight of these articles, which were\ndoubtless a legacy from her parents. The dress of the Princess was in\nevery way nicer. It had been made out of the silk of Genji's present.\nHe recognized it by the tasteful pattern. Turning to her he said,\n\"This year you might become a little more genial, the only thing I\nwait for above all is a change in your demeanor.\" To which she, with\nsome awkwardness, said,\n\n     \"In the spring, when numerous birds sing.\"\n\nSuch poetic responses were a great delight to Genji, who thought they\nwere the silent touches of time, and that she had made some\nimprovement. He then left and returned to his mansion in Niji\u00c3\u00b4, where\nhe saw the young Violet innocently amusing herself. She wore with\ngrace a long close-fitting cherry-colored dress of plain silk. She had\nnot yet blackened her teeth,[69] but he now made her do so, which gave\na pleasant contrast to her eyebrows. He played at their usual games at\ntoys with her, trying in every way to please her. She drew pictures\nand painted them, so did he also. He drew the likeness of a lady with\nlong hair, and painted her nose with pink. Even in caricature it was\nodd to see. He turned his head to a mirror in which he saw his own\nimage reflected in great serenity. He then took the brush and painted\nhis own nose pink. Violet, on seeing this, screamed.\n\n\"When I become ornamented in this way what shall I be like?\" inquired\nGenji.\n\n\"That would be a great pity. Do wipe it off, it might stain,\" she\nreplied.\n\nGenji partly wiped it off, saying, \"Need I wipe it off any more?\nSuppose I go with this to the Palace?\"\n\nOn this Violet approached and carefully wiped it for him. \"Don't put\nany more color,\" cried Genji, \"and play upon me as Heiji\u00c3\u00bb.\"[70]\n\nThe mild sun of spring descended in the west, and darkness slowly\ngathered over the forest tops, obscuring all but the lovely white plum\nblossoms which were still visible amidst the gloom. At the front of\nthe porch, also, a red plum blossom, which usually opens very early,\nwas deeply tinged with glowing hues. Genji murmured:--\n\n    \"The 'red-tinged flower' is far from fair,\n      Nor do my eyes delight to see,\n    But yon red plum which blossoms there,\n      Is full of loveliness to me.\"\n\nWhat will become of all these personages!\n\nFOOTNOTES:\n\n[Footnote 65: Young nobles spent a night in the palace in turns, to\nattend to any unexpected official business.]\n\n[Footnote 66: When a new emperor succeeded, two virgins, chosen from\nthe royal princesses, were sent--one to the Shint\u00c3\u00b4 temple at Ise, the\nother to the same temple at Kamo--to become vestals, and superintend\nthe services.]\n\n[Footnote 67: From a Chinese poem about poor people \"night advancing,\nsnow and hail fly white around.

He often pretended to be weeping, and made his eyes moist\nby using the water which he kept in his bottle for mixing ink, in\norder to deceive her. She discovered this ruse; so one day she put ink\ninto it secretly. He damped his eyes as usual, when, giving him a hand\nmirror, she hummed, \"You may show me your tears, but don't show your\nblackened face to strangers.\"]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\nMAPLE F\u00c3\u008aTE\n\n\nThe Royal visit to the Suzak-in was arranged to take place towards the\nmiddle of October, and was anticipated to be a grand affair. Ladies\nwere not expected to take part in it, and they all regretted their not\nbeing able to be present.\n\nThe Emperor, therefore, wished to let his favorite, the Princess\nWistaria, above others, have an opportunity of witnessing a rehearsal\nthat would represent the coming _f\u00c3\u00aate_, and ordered a preliminary\nconcert to be performed at the Court, in which Genji danced the \"Blue\nMain Waves,\" with T\u00c3\u00b4-no-Chi\u00c3\u00bbji\u00c3\u00b4 for his partner. They stood and danced\ntogether, forming a most pleasing contrast--one, so to speak, like a\nbright flower; the other, an everlasting verdure beside it. The rays\nof the setting sun shone over their heads, and the tones of the music\nrose higher and higher in measure to their steps. The movements both\nof hand and foot were eminently graceful; as well, also, was the song\nof Genji, which was sung at the end of his dance, so that some of the\npeople remarked that the sound of the holy bird, Kari\u00c3\u00b4binga,[71] might\nbe even like this. And so the rehearsal ended.\n\nWhen the day of the _f\u00c3\u00aate_ came, all the Royal Princes, including the\nHeir-apparent, and all personages of State, were present at the scene.\nOn the lake, \"the music boat,\" filled with selected musicians, floated\nabout, as usual on such occasions; and in the grounds, the bands,\nwhich were divided into two divisions on the right and left, under the\ndirection of two Ministers and two Yemon-no-Kami, played. With this\nmusic different dances, including Chinese and Corean, were performed,\none after another, by various dancers. As the performance went on, the\nhigh winds rustled against the tall fir-trees, as though Divine\nstrains of music had broken forth on high in harmony with them. The\ntune of the bands became quick and thrilling, as different colored\nleaves whirled about overhead.\n\nThen, at length, the hero of the \"Blue Main Waves\" made his\nappearance, to the delight of the suddenly startled spectators, from\nthe midst of a knoll in the grounds, covered with maple leaves. The\ntwigs of maple which crowned his head, became thinned as he danced,\nand a Sadaishi\u00c3\u00b4, plucking a bunch of chrysanthemums from in front of\nthe Royal stand, replaced the lessened maple leaves. The sun was by\nthis time descending, and the sky had become less glaring, while the\nface of Nature seemed as if it were smiling on the scene. Genji danced\nwith unusual skill and energy. All the pages and attendants, who were\nseverally stationed here under the side of the rock, there under the\nshade of the foliage, were quite impressed with the effects of the\nperformance.\n\nAfter Genji, a little prince, the child of the Niogo of Ji\u00c3\u00b4ki\u00c3\u00b4-den,\ndanced the \"Autumn Gales,\" with a success next to that of Genji. Then,\nthe principal interest of the day being over, as these dances were\nfinished, the _f\u00c3\u00aate_ ended. This very evening Genji was invested with\nthe title of Sh\u00c3\u00b4sammi, and T\u00c3\u00b4-no-Chi\u00c3\u00bbji\u00c3\u00b4 with that of Sh\u00c3\u00b4shii. Many\nother persons also received promotion in rank according to their\nmerits.\n\nIt was after this _f\u00c3\u00aate_ that the young Violet was taken into the\nmansion of Genji at Niji\u00c3\u00b4, and she lived with him. The more care he\ntook of her the more amiable she became, while nothing pleased him\nmore than teaching her to read and write.\n\nThe full extent of her mourning for her grandmother was three months,\nas it is for the maternal side; and on the last day of December her\ndress was changed. As she, however, had been always brought up under\nthe care of her grandmother, her indebtedness to the latter was not to\nbe held lightly; consequently any bright colors were not advisable for\nher, so she wore plain scarlet, mauve, and light yellow, without\ntrimmings or ornament on them.\n\nThe dawn ushered in the New Year's day. Genji was about to leave his\nmansion to attend the New Year's _lev\u00c3\u00a9e_. Just before starting, he\ncame into Violet's room to see her.\n\n\"How are you? Are you becoming less childish now?\" said he, with a\nsmile to the girl who was playing with her Hina (toys).\n\n\"I am trying to mend this. Inuki damaged it when he was playing what\nhe called 'driving out devils,'\"[72] replied the girl.\n\n\"What carelessness! I will soon get it mended for you. Don't cry this\nday, please,\" said Genji, and he went off, the maidens who attended on\nViolet accompanying him to the door. This example was also followed by\nViolet herself.\n\nShe went back again to her toys, and presented a toy prince, whom she\ncalled Genji, at the Court of her toy house. Shi\u00c3\u00b4nagon was beside her.\nShe said:--\n\n\"You might really be a little more womanly, as the Prince told you.\nHow very childish! a girl older than ten always playing with toys!\"\n\nViolet said nothing; but she seemed, for the first time, to have\nbecome aware that she was expected to be a woman in the course of\ntime.\n\nFrom the Court, Genji went to the mansion of Sadaijin. Lady Aoi was as\ncool to him as ever. His persuasive eloquence availed him but little.\nShe was older than Genji by four years, and was as cold and stately in\nher mien as ever. Her father, however, received him joyfully whenever\nhe called, although he was not always satisfied with the\ncapriciousness of his son-in-law.\n\nThe next morning Genji rose early, and was arranging his toilet, with\na view of making his New Year's visits, when Sadaijin entered the\nroom, and officiously assisted him in putting on his dress, except,\nperhaps, his boots. He, moreover, had brought him a belt mounted with\nrare jewels, and requested him to wear it.\n\nGenji observed: \"Such a belt is more suited for some special\noccasion--such as a Royal banquet, or the like.\" But Sadaijin insisted\non his putting it on, telling him that for that sort of occasion he\npossessed a much more valuable one.\n\nThese New Year's visits were only paid to the Emperor, to the\nHeir-apparent, and to the Princess Wistaria at her private residence\nin Sanji\u00c3\u00b4, where she had retired, but she did not receive him\npersonally. At this time, the Princess was not in her usual state of\nhealth, for she was approaching her confinement. Many people, who\nthought that they might have heard of the event in December, now began\nto say, \"At least we shall receive the intelligence this month,\" and\nthe Emperor himself became impatient; but the month passed away, and\nyet it did not happen. In the middle of February, however, she was\nsafely delivered of a Prince. During the following April the child was\npresented to the Emperor.[73] He was rather big for his age, and had\nalready begun to notice those around him.\n\nIn these days much of Genji's time was passed at Niji\u00c3\u00b4 with Violet,\nand Lady Aoi was still greatly neglected. The circumstances which\ninduced him to stay at home more than ever were these: He would order\nhis carriage to be brought in readiness to take him; but, before it\nwas ready, he would proceed to the western wing, where Violet lived.\nPerhaps, with eyes drowsy after dozing, and playing on a flute as he\nwent, he would find her moping on one side of the room, like a fair\nflower moistened with dews. He would then approach her side, and say,\n\"How are you? Are you not well?\" She, without being startled, would\nslowly open her eyes, and murmur: \"Sad like the weed in a creek,\" and\nthen put her hand on her mouth deprecatingly. On this he would remark,\n\"How knowing you are! Where did you learn such things?\" He would then\ncall for a _koto_, and saying \"The worst of the _soh-koto_ is that its\nmiddle chord should break so easily,\" would arrange it for a Hi\u00c3\u00b4ji\u00c3\u00b4\ntune, and when he had struck a few chords on it, would offer it to\nher, asking her to play, and would presently accompany her with his\nflute. They would then play some difficult air, perhaps Hosoroguseri,\na very ugly name, but a very lively tune, and she would keep very good\ntime, and display her skill. The lamp would be presently brought in,\nand they would look over some pictures together. In due time, the\ncarriage would be announced. Perhaps it might be added, \"It is coming\non to rain.\" Upon hearing this, she would, perhaps, put her pictures\naside, and become downcast. He would then smooth her wavy hair, and\nsay, \"Are you sorry when I am not here?\" To this question she would\nindicate her feelings by slightly nodding an affirmative, and she\nwould lean on his knee and begin to doze.\n\nHe would then say, \"I shall not go out to-night.\" The servant having\nbrought in supper, would tell her that Genji was not going out that\nevening. Then she would manifest the greatest delight, and would\npartake of the supper. And thus it came to pass that he often\ndisappointed one who was expecting him.\n\nThe way that Genji neglected his bride gradually became known to the\npublic--nay, to the Emperor himself, who sometimes admonished him,\ntelling him that his father-in-law always took great interest in him\nand great care from his earliest childhood, and saying that he hoped\nthat he would surely not forget all these benefits, and that it was\nstrange to be unkind to his daughter. But when these remarks were made\nto Genji, he answered nothing.\n\nLet us now change our subject. The Emperor, though he had already\npassed the meridian of life, was still fond of the society of the fair\nsex. And his Court was full of ladies who were well versed in the ways\nof the world. Some of these would occasionally amuse themselves by\npaying attentions to Genji. We will here relate the following amusing\nincident:--\n\nThere was at the Court a Naishi-no-Ske, who was already no longer\nyoung, and commonly called Gen-Naishi-no-Ske. Both her family and\ncharacter were good. She was, however, in spite of her age, still\ncoquettish, which was her only fault. Genji often felt amused at her\nbeing so young in temperament, and he enjoyed occasionally talking\nnonsense with her. She used to attend on the Emperor while his hair\nwas being dressed. One day, after he had retired into his\ndressing-room, she remained in the other room, and was smoothing her\nown hair. Genji happened to pass by. He stole unperceived into the\nroom, and slyly tugged the skirt of her robe. She started, and\ninstinctively half concealed her face with an old-fashioned fan, and\nlooked back at Genji with an arch glance in her sunken eyes. \"What an\nunsuitable fan for you!\" exclaimed Genji, and took it from her hand.\nIt was made of reddish paper, apparently long in use, and upon it an\nancient forest had been thickly painted. In a corner was written, in\nantique style, the following words:--\n\n    \"On grasses old, 'neath forest trees,\n      No steed will browse or swain delay,\n    However real that grass may be,\n      'Tis neither good for food nor play.\"\n\nGenji was highly amused. \"There are many things one might write on\nfans,\" thought he; \"what made her think of writing such odd lines as\nthese?\"\n\n\"Ah!\" said Genji, \"I see, 'its summer shade is still thick\nthough!'\"[74]\n\nWhile he was joking he felt something like nervousness in thinking\nwhat people might say if anyone happened to see him flirting with such\nan elderly lady. She, on her side, had no such fear. She replied--\n\n    \"If beneath that forest tree,\n    The steed should come or swain should be,\n    Where that ancient forest grows,\n    Is grass for food, and sweet repose.\"\n\n\"What?\" retorted Genji,\n\n    \"If my steed should venture near,\n    Perhaps he'd find a rival there,\n    Some one's steed full well, I ween,\n    Rejoices in these pastures green.\"\n\nAnd quitted the room.\n\nThe Emperor, who had been peeping unobserved into it, after he had\nfinished his toilet, laughed heartily to himself at the scene.\n\nT\u00c3\u00b4-no-Chi\u00c3\u00bbji\u00c3\u00b4 was somehow informed of Genji's fun with this lady, and\nbecame anxious to discover how far he meant to carry on the joke. He\ntherefore sought her acquaintance. Genji knew nothing of this. It\nhappened on a cool summer evening that Genji was sauntering round the\nUmmeiden in the palace yard. He heard the sound of a _biwa_ (mandolin)\nproceeding from a veranda. It was played by this lady. She performed\nwell upon it, for she was often accustomed to play it before the\nEmperor along with male musicians. It sounded very charming. She was\nalso singing to it the \"Melon grower.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" thought Genji, \"the singing woman in Gakshoo, whom the poet\nspoke of, may have been like this one,\" and he stood still and\nlistened. Slowly he approached near the veranda, humming slowly, as\nhe went, \"Adzmaya,\" which she soon noticed, and took up the song, \"Do\nopen and come in! but\n\n    I do not believe you're in the rain,\n    Nor that you really wish to come in.\"\n\nGenji at once responded,\n\n    \"Whose love you may be I know not,\n    But I'll not stand outside your cot,\"\n\nand was going away, when he suddenly thought, \"This is too abrupt!\"\nand coming back, he entered the apartment.\n\nHow great was the joy of T\u00c3\u00b4-no-Chi\u00c3\u00bbji\u00c3\u00b4, who had followed Genji\nunperceived by him, when he saw this. He contrived a plan to frighten\nhim, so he reconnoitred in order to find some favorable opportunity.\n\nThe evening breeze blew chill, and Genji it appears was becoming very\nindifferent. Choosing this moment T\u00c3\u00b4-no-Chi\u00c3\u00bbji\u00c3\u00b4 slyly stepped forth to\nthe spot where Genji was resting.\n\nGenji soon noticed his footsteps, but he never imagined that it was\nhis brother-in-law. He thought it was Suri-no-Kami, a great friend of\nthe lady. He did not wish to be seen by this man. He reproached her\nfor knowing that he was expected, but that she did not give him any\nhint. Carrying his Naoshi on his arm, he hid himself behind a folding\nscreen. T\u00c3\u00b4-no-Chi\u00c3\u00bbji\u00c3\u00b4, suppressing a laugh, advanced to the side of\nthe screen, and began to fold it from one end to the other, making a\ncrashing noise as he did so. The lady was in a dilemma, and stood\naloof. Genji would fain have run out, and concealed himself elsewhere,\nbut he could not get on his Naoshi, and his head-dress was all awry.\nThe Chi\u00c3\u00bbji\u00c3\u00b4 spoke not a word lest he should betray himself, but making\na pretended angry expostulation, he drew his sword. All at once the\nlady threw herself at his feet, crying, \"My lord! my lord!\"\nT\u00c3\u00b4-no-Chi\u00c3\u00bbji\u00c3\u00b4 could scarcely constrain himself from laughing. She was\na woman of about fifty seven, but her excitement was more like that of\na girl of twenty.\n\nGenji gradually perceived that the man's rage was only simulated, and\nsoon became aware who it was that was there; so he suddenly rushed\nout, and catching hold of T\u00c3\u00b4-no-Chi\u00c3\u00bbji\u00c3\u00b4's sword-arm, pinched it\nseverely. T\u00c3\u00b4-no-Chi\u00c3\u00bbji\u00c3\u00b4 no longer maintained his disguise, but burst\ninto loud laughter.\n\n\"How are you my friend, were you in earnest?\" exclaimed Genji,\njestingly--\"but first let me put on my Naoshi.\" But T\u00c3\u00b4-no-Chi\u00c3\u00bbji\u00c3\u00b4\ncaught it, and tried to prevent him putting it on.\n\n\"Then I will have yours,\" cried Genji, seizing the end of\nT\u00c3\u00b4-no-Chi\u00c3\u00bbji\u00c3\u00b4's sash, and beginning to unfasten it, while the latter\nresisted. Then they both began to struggle, and their Naoshi soon\nbegan to tear.\n\n\"Ah,\" cried T\u00c3\u00b4-no-Chi\u00c3\u00bbji\u00c3\u00b4,\n\n     \"Like the Naoshi to the eye,\n     Your secrets all discovered lie.\"\n\n\"Well,\" replied Genji,\n\n     \"This secret if so well you know,\n     Why am I now disturbed by you?\"\n\nAnd they both quitted the room without much noticing the state of\ntheir garments.\n\nT\u00c3\u00b4-no-Chi\u00c3\u00bbji\u00c3\u00b4 proceeded to his official chamber, and Genji to his own\napartment. The sash and other things which they had left behind them\nwere soon afterwards sent to Genji by the lady.\n\nThe sash was that of T\u00c3\u00b4-no-Chi\u00c3\u00bbji\u00c3\u00b4. Its color was somewhat deeper than\nhis own, and while he was looking at this, he suddenly noticed that\none end of a sleeve of his own Naoshi was wanting. \"T\u00c3\u00b4-no-Chi\u00c3\u00bbji\u00c3\u00b4, I\nsuppose, has carried it off, but I have him also, for here is his\nsash!\" A page boy from T\u00c3\u00b4-no-Chi\u00c3\u00bbji\u00c3\u00b4's office hereupon entered,\ncarrying a packet in which the missing sleeve was wrapped, and a\nmessage advising Genji to get it mended before all things. \"Fancy if I\nhad not got this sash?\" thought Genji, as he made the boy take it back\nto his master in return.\n\nIn the morning they were in attendance at Court. They were both\nserious and solemn in demeanor, as it happened to be a day when there\nwas more official business than on other days; T\u00c3\u00b4-no-Chi\u00c3\u00bbji\u00c3\u00b4 (who\nbeing chief of the Kurand, which office has to receive and despatch\nofficial documents) was especially much occupied. Nevertheless they\nwere amused themselves at seeing each other's solemn gravity.\n\nIn an interval, when free from duty, T\u00c3\u00b4-no-Chi\u00c3\u00bbji\u00c3\u00b4 came up to Genji\nand said, with envious eyes, \"Have you not been a little scared in\nyour private expedition?\" when Genji replied, \"No, why so? there was\nnothing serious in it; but I do sympathize with one who took so much\nuseless trouble.\"\n\nThey then cautioned each other to be discreet about the matter, which\nbecame afterwards a subject for laughter between them.\n\nNow even some Royal Princes would give way to Genji, on account of his\nfather's favor towards him, but T\u00c3\u00b4-no-Chi\u00c3\u00bbji\u00c3\u00b4, on the contrary, was\nalways prepared to dispute with him on any subject, and did not yield\nto him in any way. He was the only brother of the Lady Aoi by the same\nRoyal mother, with an influential State personage for their father,\nand in his eyes there did not seem to be much difference between\nhimself and Genji.\n\nThe incidents of the rivalry between them, therefore, were often very\namusing, though we cannot relate them all.\n\nIn the month of July the Princess Wistaria was proclaimed Empress.\nThis was done because the Emperor had a notion of abdication in favor\nof the Heir-apparent and of making the son of the Princess Wistaria\nthe Heir-apparent to the new Emperor, but there was no appropriate\nguardian or supporter, and all relations on the mother's side were of\nthe Royal blood, and thereby disqualified from taking any active part\nin political affairs.\n\nFor this reason the Emperor wished to make the position of the mother\nfirmer.\n\nThe mother of the Heir-apparent, whom this arrangement left still a\nsimple Niogo, was naturally hurt and uneasy at another being\nproclaimed Empress. Indeed she was the mother of the Heir-apparent,\nand had been so for more than twenty years. And the public remarked\nthat it was a severe trial for her to be thus superseded by another.\n\nFOOTNOTES:\n\n[Footnote 71: Kalavinka, the beautifully singing holy birds in\nParadise, to whose singing the voice of Buddha is compared.]\n\n[Footnote 72: On New Year's Eve, in Japan, some people fry peas, and\nthrow them about the rooms, saying, \"Avaunt, Devil, avaunt!

The weather was most lovely, and the merry\nbirds were singing their melody to the charms of the scene. All the\nRoyal Princes, nobles and _literati_ were assembled, and among them\nthe Emperor made his appearance, accompanied by the Princess Wistaria\n(now Empress) on the one side, and the Niogo of Kokiden, the mother of\nthe Heir-apparent on the other; the latter having constrained herself\nto take part with her rival in the _f\u00c3\u00aate_, in spite of her uneasiness\nat the recent promotion of that rival.\n\nWhen all the seats were taken the composing[75] of poems, as was the\ncustom, commenced, and they began picking up the rhymes. The turn came\nin due course to Genji, who picked up the word spring. Next to Genji,\nT\u00c3\u00b4-no-Chi\u00c3\u00bbji\u00c3\u00b4 took his.\n\nMany more followed them, including several aged professors, who had\noften been present on similar occasions, with faces wrinkled by time,\nand figures bowed by the weight of years. The movements and\nannouncements[76] both of Genji and his brother-in-law were elegant\nand graceful, as might be expected; but among those who followed there\nwere not a few who showed awkwardness, this being more the case with\nscholars of ordinary accomplishments, since this was an epoch when the\nEmperor, the Heir-apparent and others of high distinction were more or\nless accomplished in these arts.\n\nMeanwhile, they all partook of the feast; the selected musicians\njoyfully played their parts, and as the sun was setting, \"The\nSpring-lark Sings\" (name of a dance) was danced. This reminded those\npresent of Genji's dance at the maple _f\u00c3\u00aate_, and the Heir-apparent\npressed him to dance, at the same moment putting on his head a wreath\nof flowers. Upon this Genji stood up, and waving his sleeves, danced a\nlittle. T\u00c3\u00b4-no-Chi\u00c3\u00bbji\u00c3\u00b4 was next requested by the Emperor to do the same\nthing, and he danced the \"Willow Flower Gardens\" most elaborately, and\nwas honored by the Emperor with a present of a roll of silk. After\nthem, many young nobles danced indiscriminately, one after another,\nbut we cannot give an opinion about them as the darkness was already\ngathering round. Lamps were at length brought, when the reading of the\npoems took place, and late in the evening all present dispersed.\n\nThe palace grounds now became quite tranquil, and over them the moon\nshone with her soft light.\n\nGenji, his temper mellowed by _sak\u00c3\u00a9_, was tempted to take a stroll to\nsee what he could see. He first sauntered round Fuji-Tsubo (the\nchamber of Wistaria) and came up by the side of the corridor of\nKokiden. He noticed a small private door standing open. It seems that\nthe Niogo was in her upper chamber at the Emperor's quarters, having\ngone there after she retired from the feast. The inner sliding door\nwas also left open, and no human voice was heard from within.\n\n\"Such are occasions on which one often compromises one's self,\"\nthought he, and yet slowly approached the entrance. Just at that\nmoment he heard a tender voice coming toward him, humming, \"Nothing so\nsweet as the _oboro_[77] moon-night.\" Genji waited her approach, and\ncaught her by the sleeve. It made her start. \"Who are you?\" she\nexclaimed. \"Don't be alarmed,\" he replied, and gently led her back to\nthe corridor. He then added, \"Let us look out on the moonlight\ntogether.\" She was, of course, nervous, and would fain have cried out.\n\"Hush,\" said he; \"know that I am one with whom no one will interfere;\nbe gentle, and let us talk a little while.\" These words convinced her\nthat it was Prince Genji, and calmed her fears.\n\nIt appears that he had taken more _sak\u00c3\u00a9_ than usual, and this made him\nrather reckless. The girl, on the other hand, was still very young,\nbut she was witty and pleasantly disposed, and spent some time in\nconversing with him.\n\nHe did not yet know who she was, and asked, \"Can't you let me know\nyour name? Suppose I wish to write to you hereafter?\" But she gave no\ndecided answer; so Genji, after exchanging his fan with hers, left her\nand quietly returned to his apartments.\n\nGenji's thoughts were now directed to his new acquaintance. He was\nconvinced that she was one of the younger sisters of the Niogo. He\nknew that one of them was married to a Prince, one of his own\nrelations, and another to his brother-in-law, T\u00c3\u00b4-no-Chi\u00c3\u00bbji\u00c3\u00b4. He was\nperfectly sure that his new acquaintance was not either of these, and\nhe presumed her to be the fifth or sixth of them, but was not sure\nwhich of these two.\n\n\"How can I ascertain this?\" he thought. \"If I compromise myself, and\nher father becomes troublesome, that won't do; but yet I must know.\"\n\nThe fan which he had just acquired was of the color of cherry. On it\nwas a picture representing the pale moon coming out of a purple cloud,\nthrowing a dim light upon the water.\n\nTo Genji this was precious. He wrote on one side the following, and\nkept it carefully, with a longing for the chance of making it\nuseful:--\n\n    \"The moon I love has left the sky,\n      And where 'tis hid I cannot tell;\n    I search in vain, in vain I try\n      To find the spot where it may dwell.\"\n\nNow, it so happened that on a certain day at the end of March, an\narchery meeting was to be held at Udaijin's, in which numerous noble\nyouths were to be present, and which was to be succeeded by the\nWistaria flower-feast. The height of the flower season was past, but\nthere were two cherry-trees, besides the Wistaria in the gardens,\nwhich blossomed later. A new building in the ground, which had been\ndecorated for the occasion of the Mogi[78] of the two Princesses, was\nbeing beautifully arranged for this occasion.\n\nGenji also had been told one day at Court by Udaijin that he might\njoin the meeting. When the day came Genji did not arrive early.\nUdaijin sent by one of his sons the following haughty message to\nGenji, who was at the time with the Emperor:--\n\n     \"If the flowers of my home were of every-day hue,\n     Why should they so long a time have tarried for you?\"\n\nGenji at once showed this to the Emperor, asking whether he had better\ngo. \"Ah!\" said the latter, smiling, \"This is from a great personage.\nYou had better go, I should think; besides there are the Princesses\nthere.\"\n\nThereupon he prepared to go, and made his appearance late in the\nafternoon.\n\nThe party was very pleasant, although the archery-match was almost\nfinished, and several hours were spent in different amusements. As\ntwilight fell around, Genji affected to be influenced by the _sak\u00c3\u00a9_ he\nhad taken, left the party, and went to that part of the Palace where\nthe Princesses lived. The Wistaria flowers in the gardens could also\nbe seen from this spot, and several ladies were looking out on them.\n\n\"I have been too much pressed. Let me take a little quiet shelter\nhere,\" said Genji, as he joined them. The room was nicely scented with\nburning perfume. There he saw his two half-sisters and some others\nwith whom he was not acquainted. He was certain that the one he wished\nto ascertain about was among them, but from the darkness of the\nadvancing evening he was unable to distinguish her. He adopted a\ndevice for doing so. He hummed, as he looked vacantly around, the\n\"Ishi-kawa,\"[79] but instead of the original line, \"My belt being\ntaken,\" artfully, and in an arch tone, substituted the word \"fan\" for\n\"belt.\"\n\nSome were surprised at this change, while others even said, \"What a\nstrange Ishi-kawa!\" One only said nothing, but looked down, and thus\nbetrayed herself as the one whom he was seeking, and Genji was soon at\nher side.\n\nFOOTNOTES:\n\n[Footnote 75: Composing poems in Chinese was a principal part of the\nfeast.

It\nwas the custom that royal children should be brought up at the home of\nthe mother.]\n\n[Footnote 79: Name of a well-known ballad.]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\nHOLLYHOCK\n\n\nThe Emperor has at last abdicated his throne, as he has long intended,\nin favor of the Heir-apparent, and the only child of the Princess\nWistaria is made Heir-apparent to the new Emperor.\n\nThe ex-Emperor now lived in a private palace with this Princess in a\nless royal style; and the Niogo of Kokiden, to whom was given the\nhonorary title of ex-Empress, resided in the Imperial Palace with the\nEmperor, her son, and took up a conspicuous position. The ex-Emperor\nstill felt some anxiety about the Heir-apparent, and appointed Genji\nas his guardian, as he had not yet a suitable person for that office.\n\nThis change in the reigning Emperor, and the gradual advancement of\nGenji's position, gave the latter greater responsibility, and he had\nto restrain his wandering.\n\nNow, according to usage, the Saig\u00c3\u00bb[80] and Saiin[81] were selected;\nfor the latter the second sister of the Emperor was chosen, and for\nthe former the only daughter of the Lady of Rokji\u00c3\u00b4, whose husband had\nbeen a Royal Prince.\n\nThe day of the departure of the Saig\u00c3\u00bb for Ise was not yet fixed; and\nthe mind of her mother, who had some reasons for dissatisfaction with\nGenji, was still wavering in her indecision, whether or not she should\ngo to Ise with her daughter.\n\nThe case of the Saiin, however, was different, and the day of her\ninstallation was soon fixed. She was the favorite child of her mother\nas well as of her father, and the ceremonies for the day of\nconsecration were arranged with especial splendor. The number of\npersons who take a share in the procession on this occasion is defined\nby regulations; yet the selection of this number was most carefully\nmade from the most fashionable of the nobles of the time, and their\ndresses and saddles were all chosen of beautiful appearance. Genji was\nalso directed by special order to take part in the ceremony.\n\nAs the occasion was expected to be magnificent, every class of the\npeople showed great eagerness to witness the scene, and a great number\nof stands were erected all along the road. The day thus looked forward\nto at last arrived.\n\nLady Aoi seldom showed herself on such occasions; besides, she was now\nin a delicate state of health, near her confinement, and had,\ntherefore, no inclination to go out. Her attendants, however,\nsuggested to her that she ought to go. \"It is a great pity,\" they\nsaid, \"not to see it; people come from a long distance to see it.\" Her\nmother also said, \"You seem better to-day. I think you had better go.\nTake these girls with you.\"\n\nBeing pressed in this way, she hastily made up her mind, and went with\na train of carriages. All the road was thronged by multitudes of\npeople, many dressed in a style which is called Tsubo-Sh\u00c3\u00b4zok. Many of\ngreat age prostrated themselves in an attitude of adoration, and many\nothers, notwithstanding their natural plainness, looked almost\nblooming, from the joy expressed in their countenances--nay, even nuns\nand aged women, from their retreats, were to be seen amongst them.\nNumerous carriages were also squeezed closely together, so that the\nbroad thoroughfare of the Ichiji\u00c3\u00b4 road was made almost spaceless.\nWhen, however, the carriages of the Lady Aoi's party appeared, her\nattendants ordered several others to make way, and forced a passage to\nthe spot where the best view could be obtained, and where the common\npeople were not allowed. Among these happened to be two _ajiro_[82]\ncarriages, and their inmates were plainly incognito and persons of\nrank.\n\nThese belonged to the party of the Lady of Rokji\u00c3\u00b4. When these\ncarriages were forced to give place, their attendants cried out,\n\"These carriages do not belong to people who ought to be so abruptly\nforced away.\" But the attendants of the Lady Aoi, who were slightly\nunder the influence of drink, would not listen to their\nexpostulations, and they at last made their way and took up their\nposition, pushing the other two back where nothing could be seen, even\nbreaking their poles.\n\nThe lady so maltreated was of course extremely indignant, and she\nwould fain have gone home without seeing the spectacle, but there was\nno passage for retiring. Meanwhile the approach of the procession was\nannounced, and only this calmed her a little.\n\nGenji was as usual conspicuous in the procession. There were several\ncarriages along the roads on whose occupants his glance was cast; that\nof Lady Aoi, however, was the most striking, and as he passed by the\nattendants saluted him courteously, which act Genji acknowledged. What\nwere the feelings of the Lady of Rokji\u00c3\u00b4, who had been driven back, at\nthis moment!\n\nIn due course the procession passed, and the exciting scene of the day\nwas over. The quarrels about the carriage naturally came to the ears\nof Genji. He thought that Lady Aoi was too modest to be the instigator\nof such a dispute; but her house was one of great and powerful\nfamilies famous for overweening pride, a tendency shared by its\ndomestics; and they, for other motives, also of rivalry, were glad to\nhave an opportunity of mortifying the Lady of Rokji\u00c3\u00b4.\n\nHe felt for the wounded lady, and hastened to see her; but she, under\nsome pretext, refused to see him.\n\nThe day of the hollyhock _f\u00c3\u00aate_ of the same temple came. It was\nespecially grand, as it was the first one after the installation of\nthe new Saiin, but neither Lady Aoi or the Lady of Rokji\u00c3\u00b4 was present,\nwhile Genji privately took Violet with him in a close carriage to see\nthe festival, and saw the horse-races.\n\nWe have already mentioned that the mind of the Lady of Rokji\u00c3\u00b4 was\nstill wavering and unsettled whether or not she should go to Ise with\nher daughter; and this state of mind became more and more augmented\nand serious after the day of the dispute about the carriages, which\nmade her feel a bitter disdain and jealousy towards the Lady Aoi.\nStrange to say, that from about the same time, Lady Aoi became ill,\nand began to suffer from spiritual influences. All sorts of exorcisms\nwere duly performed, and some spirits came forth and gave their names.\nBut among them was a spirit, apparently a \"living one,\"[83] which\nobstinately refused to be transmitted to the third party. It caused\nher great suffering, and seemed not to be of a casual nature, but a\npermanent hostile influence. Some imagined this to be the effect of\nfearful jealousy of some one who was intimately known to Genji and who\nhad most influence over him; but the spirit gave no information to\nthis effect. Hence some even surmised that the wandering spirit of\nsome aged nurse, or the like, long since dead, still haunted the\nmansion, and might have seized the opportunity of the lady's delicate\nhealth, and taken possession of her. Meanwhile at the mansion of\nRokji\u00c3\u00b4, the lady, when she was informed of the sufferings of Lady Aoi,\nfelt somewhat for her, and began to experience a sort of compassion.\n\nThis became stronger when she was told that the sufferings of the Lady\nAoi were owing to some living spirit. She thought that she never\nwished any evil to her; but, when she reflected, there were several\ntimes when she began to think that a wounded spirit, such as her own,\nmight have some influence of the kind. She had sometimes dreams, after\nweary thinking, between slumber and waking, in which she seemed to fly\nto some beautiful girl, apparently Lady Aoi, and to engage in bitter\ncontention and struggle with her. She became even terrified at these\ndreams; but yet they took place very often. \"Even in ordinary\nmatters,\" she thought, \"it is too common a practice, to say nothing of\nthe good done by people, but to exaggerate the bad; and so, in such\ncases, if it should be rumored that mine was that living spirit which\ntormented Lady Aoi, how trying it would be to me! It is no rare\noccurrence that one's disembodied spirit, after death, should wander\nabout; but even that is not a very agreeable idea. How much more,\nthen, must it be disagreeable to have the repute that one's living\nspirit was inflicting pain upon another!\"\n\nThese thoughts still preyed upon her mind, and made her listless and\ndepressed.\n\nIn due course, the confinement of Lady Aoi approached. At the same\ntime, the jealous spirit still vexed her, and now more vigorous\nexorcising was employed. She became much affected by it, and cried\nout, \"Please release me a little; I have something to tell the\nPrince.\"\n\nHereupon he was ushered into the room. The curtain was dropped, and\nthe mother of the lady left the room, as she thought her daughter\nmight prefer to speak to him in private. The sound of the spells\nperformed in the next chamber ceased, and Hoke-ki\u00c3\u00b4 was read in its\nplace. The lady was lying on her couch, dressed in a pure white\ngarment, with her long tresses unfastened. He approached her, and\ntaking her hand, said: \"What sad affliction you cause us!\" She then\nlifted her heavy eyelids, and gazed on Genji for some minutes.\n\nHe tried to soothe her, and said, \"Pray don't trouble yourself too\nmuch about matters. Everything will come right. Your illness, I think,\nwill soon pass away. Even supposing you quit this present world, there\nis another where we shall meet, and where I shall see you once more\ncheerful, and there will be a time when your mother and father will\nalso join you.\"\n\n\"Ah! no. I only come here to solicit you to give me a little rest. I\nfeel extremely disturbed. I never thought of coming here in such a\nway; but it seems the spirit of one whose thoughts are much\ndisconcerted wanders away unknown even to itself.\n\n    Oh, bind my wandering spirit, pray,\n    Dear one, nor let it longer stray.\"\n\nThe enunciation of these words was not that of Lady Aoi herself; and\nwhen Genji came to reflect, it clearly belonged to the Lady of Rokji\u00c3\u00b4.\nAlways before, when anyone had talked with him about a living spirit\ncoming to vex Lady Aoi, he felt inclined to suppress such ideas; but\nnow he began to think that such things might really happen, and he\nfelt disturbed. \"You speak thus,\" said Genji, as if he was addressing\nthe spirit, \"but you do not tell me who you are. Do, therefore, tell\nme clearly.\" At these words, strange to say, the face of the Lady Aoi\nseemed momentarily to assume the likeness of that of Rokji\u00c3\u00b4. On this,\nGenji was still more perplexed and anxious, and put a stop to the\ncolloquy. Presently she became very calm, and people thought that she\nwas a little relieved. Soon after this, the lady was safely delivered\nof a child.\n\nNow, to perform due thanksgiving for this happy deliverance, the head\nof the monastery on Mount Hiye and some other distinguished priests\nwere sent for. They came in all haste, wiping off the perspiration\nfrom their faces as they journeyed; and, from the Emperor and Royal\nprinces down to the ordinary nobles, all took an interest in the\nceremony of Ub-yashinai (first feeding), and the more so as the child\nwas a boy.\n\nTo return to the Lady of Rokji\u00c3\u00b4. When she heard of the safe delivery\nof Lady Aoi, a slightly jealous feeling once more seemed to vex her;\nand when she began to move about, she could not understand how it was,\nbut she perceived that her dress was scented with a strange odor.[84]\nShe thought this most surprising, and took baths and changed her\ndress, in order to get rid of it; but the odor soon returned, and she\nwas disgusted with herself.\n\nSome days passed, and the day of autumn appointments arrived. By this\ntime, Lady Aoi's health seemed progressing favorably, and Genji left\nher in order to attend the Court.\n\nWhen he said good-by to her, there was a strange and unusual look in\nher eyes. Sadaijin also went to Court, as well as his sons, who had\nsome expectation of promotion, and there were few people left in the\nmansion.\n\nIt was in the evening of that day that Lady Aoi was suddenly attacked\nby a spasm, and before the news of this could be carried to the Court,\nshe died.\n\nThese sad tidings soon reached the Court, and created great distress\nand confusion: even the arrangements for appointments and promotion\nwere disturbed. As it happened late in the evening there was no time\nto send for the head of the monastery, or any other distinguished\npriest. Messengers of inquiry came one after another to the mansion,\nso numerous that it was almost impossible to return them all answers.\nWe need not add how greatly affected were all her relations.\n\nAs the death took place from a malign spiritual influence, she was\nleft untouched during two or three days, in the hope that she might\nrevive; but no change took place, and now all hope was abandoned. In\ndue course the corpse was taken to the cemetery of Toribeno. Numerous\nmourners and priests of different churches crowded to the spot, while\nrepresentatives of the ex-Emperor, Princess Wistaria, and the\nHeir-apparent also were present. The ceremony of burial was performed\nwith all solemnity and pathos.\n\nThus the modest and virtuous Lady Aoi passed away forever.\n\nGenji forthwith confined himself to his apartment in the grand mansion\nof Sadaijin, for mourning and consolation. T\u00c3\u00b4-no-Chi\u00c3\u00bbji\u00c3\u00b4, who was now\nelevated to the title of Sammi, constantly bore him company, and\nconversed with him both on serious and amusing subjects. Their\nstruggle in the apartment of Gen-naishi, and also their rencontre in\nthe garden of the \"Saffron Flower,\" were among the topics of their\nconsoling conversation.\n\nIt was on one of these occasions that a soft shower of rain was\nfalling. The evening was rendered cheerless, and T\u00c3\u00b4-no-Chi\u00c3\u00bbji\u00c3\u00b4 came to\nsee him, walking slowly in his mourning robes of a dull color. Genji\nwas leaning out of a window, his cheek resting on his hand; and,\nlooking out upon the half-fading shrubberies, was humming--\n\n    \"Has she become rain or cloud?\n    'Tis now unknown.\"\n\nT\u00c3\u00b4-no-Chi\u00c3\u00bbji\u00c3\u00b4 gently approached him. They had, as usual, some pathetic\nconversation, and then the latter hummed, as if to himself--\n\n    \"Beyond the cloud in yonder sky,\n      From which descends the passing rain,\n    Her gentle soul may dwell,\n      Though we may cease to trace its form in vain.\"\n\nThis was soon responded to by Genji:--\n\n    \"That cloudy shrine we view on high,\n      Where my lost love may dwell unseen,\n    Looks gloomy now to this sad eye\n      That looks with tears on what has been.\"\n\nThere was among the faded plants of the garden a solitary\nRind\u00c3\u00b4-nadeshko.[85] When T\u00c3\u00b4-no-Chi\u00c3\u00bbji\u00c3\u00b4 had gone, Genji picked this\nflower, and sent it to his mother-in-law by the nurse of the infant\nchild, with the following:--\n\n    \"In bowers where all beside are dead\n      Survives alone this lovely flower,\n    Departed autumn's cherished gem,\n      Symbol of joy's departed hour.\"[86]\n\nGenji still felt lonely. He wrote a letter to the Princess Momo-zono\n(peach-gardens). He had known her long. He admired her, too. She had\nbeen a spectator, with her father, on the day of the consecration of\nthe Saiin, and was one of those to whom the appearance of Genji was\nmost welcome. In his letter he stated that she might have a little\nsympathy with him in his sorrow, and he also sent with it the\nfollowing:--\n\n    \"Many an autumn have I past\n      In gloomy thought, but none I ween\n    Has been so mournful as the last,\n      Which rife with grief and change hath been.\"\n\nThere was, indeed, nothing serious between Genji and this princess;\nyet, as far as correspondence was concerned, they now and then\nexchanged letters, so she did not object to receiving this\ncommunication. She felt for him much, and an answer was returned, in\nwhich she expressed her sympathy at his bereavement.\n\nNow, in the mansion of Sadaijin every performance of requiem was\ncelebrated. The forty-ninth day had passed, and the mementoes of the\ndead, both trifling and valuable, were distributed in a due and\nagreeable manner; and Genji at length left the grand mansion with the\nintention of first going to the ex-Emperor, and then of returning to\nhis mansion at Niji\u00c3\u00b4. After his departure, Sadaijin went into the\napartment occupied till lately by him. The room was the same as\nbefore, and everything was unchanged; but his only daughter, the\npride of his old days, was no more, and his son-in-law had gone too.\n\nHe looked around him for some moments. He saw some papers lying about.\nThey were those on which Genji had been practising penmanship for\namusement--some in Chinese, others in Japanese; some in free style,\nothers in stiff. Among these papers he saw one on which the words \"Old\npillows and old quilts\" were written, and close to these the\nfollowing:--\n\n    \"How much the soul departed, still\n      May love to linger round this couch,\n    My own heart tells me, even I\n      Reluctant am to leave it now.\"\n\nAnd on another of these papers, accompanying the words, \"The white\nfrost lies upon the tiles,\" the following:--\n\n    \"How many more of nights shall I\n    On this lone bed without thee lie;\n    The flower has left its well-known bed,\n    And o'er its place the dews are shed.\"\n\nAs Sadaijin was turning over these papers a withered flower, which\nseems to have marked some particular occasion, dropped from amongst\nthem.\n\nReturn we now to Genji. He went to the ex-Emperor, to whom he still\nseemed thin and careworn. He had some affectionate conversation with\nhim, remained till evening, and then proceeded to his mansion at\nNiji\u00c3\u00b4. He went to the western wing to visit the young Violet. All were\nhabited in new winter apparel, and looked fresh and blooming.\n\n\"How long it seems since I saw you!\" he exclaimed. Violet turned her\nglance a little aside. She was apparently shy, which only increased\nher beauty.\n\nHe approached, and after having a little conversation, said, \"I have\nmany things to say to you, but now I must have a little rest,\" and\nreturned to his own quarters.\n\nThe next morning, first of all he sent a letter to Sadaijin's, making\ninquiry after his infant child.\n\nAt this time he confined himself more than usual to his own house, and\nfor companionship he was constantly with Violet, who was now\napproaching womanhood. He would sometimes talk with her differently\nfrom the manner in which he would speak to a mere girl; but on her\npart she seemed not to notice the difference, and for their daily\namusement either Go or Hentski[87] was resorted to, and sometimes they\nwould play on till late in the evening.\n\nSome weeks thus passed away, and there was one morning when Violet did\nnot appear so early as usual. The inmates of the house, who did not\nknow what was the reason, were anxious about her, thinking she was\nindisposed. About noon Genji came. He entered the little room, saying,\n\"Are you not quite well? Perhaps you would like to play at Go again,\nlike last night, for a change;\" but she was more than ever shy.\n\n\"Why are you so shy?\" he exclaimed; \"be a little more cheerful--people\nmay think it strange,\" said he, and stayed with her a long time trying\nto soothe her; but to no effect--she still continued silent and shy.\n\nThis was the evening of Wild Boar's day, and some _mochi_ (pounded\nrice cake) was presented to him, according to custom, on a tray of\nplain white wood.\n\nHe called Koremitz before him and said, \"To-day is not a very\nopportune day; I would rather have them to-morrow evening. Do send in\nsome to-morrow.[88] It need not be of so many colors.\" So saying, he\nsmiled a little, and sharp Koremitz soon understood what he meant. And\nthis he accordingly did on the morrow, on a beautiful flower-waiter.\n\nUp to this time nothing about Violet had been publicly known, and\nGenji thought it was time to inform her father about his daughter; but\nhe considered he had better have the ceremony of Mogi first performed,\nand ordered preparations to be made with that object.\n\nLet us here notice that the young daughter of Udaijin, after she saw\nGenji, was longing to see him again. This inclination was perceived by\nher relations. It seems that her father was not quite averse to this\nliking, and he told his eldest daughter, the reigning Emperor's\nmother, that Genji was recently bereaved of his good consort, and that\nhe should not feel discontented if his daughter were to take the place\nof Lady Aoi; but this the royal mother did not approve. \"It would be\nfar better for her to be introduced at Court,\" she said, and began\ncontriving to bring this about.\n\nFOOTNOTES:\n\n[Footnote 80: The sacred virgin of the temple of Ise.]\n\n[Footnote 81: The same of Kamo, which is situated in the neighborhood\nof Ki\u00c3\u00b4to, the then capital.]\n\n[Footnote 82: \"Ajiro\" means woven bamboo, and here it signifies a\ncarriage made of woven bamboo.]\n\n[Footnote 83: Before proceeding with the story, it is necessary for\nthe reader to peruse the following note: In Japan there existed, and\nstill more or less exists, a certain superstition which is\nentertained, that the spirits of the dead have the power of inflicting\ninjury on mankind; for instance, a woman when slighted or deserted,\ndies, her spirit often works evil on the man who forsook her, or on\nher rival. This is the spirit of the dead. There is also another\nbelief that the spirits of the living have sometimes the same power,\nbut in this case it only takes place when one is fiercely jealous.\nWhen this spirit works upon the rival, the owner of the spirit is not\naware of it; but she herself becomes more gloomy, as if she had, as it\nwere, lost her own spirit. These spirits can be exorcised, and the act\nis performed by a certain sect of priests; but the living one is\nconsidered far more difficult to exorcise than the other, because it\nis imagined that the dead spirit can be easily \"laid,\" or driven back\nto the tomb, while the living one, being still in its present state,\ncannot be settled so easily. The method of exorcism is as follows:\nCertain spells are used on the sufferer, and certain religious\naddresses are read from the Buddhist bibles, and then the sufferer is\nmade to speak out all his subjects of complaint; but it is supposed\nnot to be the man himself who speaks and tells these causes of\ncomplaint, but the spirit of which he is possessed. This process is\nsometimes performed on a third party; in that case the priest\ntemporarily transmits the spirit from the sufferer to the substitute\nand makes it speak with his mouth. When he has told all the causes of\nhis complaint and wrongs, the priest sometimes argues with him,\nsometimes chides, sometimes soothes, and sometimes threatens, and at\nlast says to the spirit, \"If you do not go out quietly, I will confine\nyou by my sacred power.\" By such means the spirit is exorcised; the\nprocess resembles mesmerism in some points, but of course has no\nsensible foundation. In other cases the spirits of those who have\neither recently, or even years before, met with cruel wrongs or death,\nmay in their wanderings seize upon some person in the vicinity, though\ntotally unconnected with the crime done upon them, and may cause them\nsuffering, or even spirits, who from any cause, are unable to obtain\nrest, may do the same thing.]\n\n[Footnote 84: In the ceremony of exorcism a sacred perfume is burnt,\nand it was this scent which the Lady of Rokji\u00c3\u00b4 perceived in her\ngarment because her spirit was supposed to go to and fro between\nherself and Lady Aoi, and to bring with it the smell of this perfume.]\n\n[Footnote 85: A kind of pink; some translate it Gentian.]\n\n[Footnote 86: Here the flower is compared to the child, and autumn to\nthe mother.]\n\n[Footnote 87: \"Hentski,\" a children's game. It consists in choosing\nbeforehand a \"hen\" or half-character, opening a book and seeing which\nof the players can most quickly pick out the words beginning with this\n\"hen.\"]\n\n[Footnote 88: It seemed to have been the ancient custom, that on the\nthird night of a wedding, the same kind of rice cake, but only of one\ncolor, was served up.]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\nDIVINE TREE\n\n\nThe departure of the Saig\u00c3\u00bb, the daughter of the Lady of Rokji\u00c3\u00b4, for\nher destination in the Temple of Ise, which was postponed from time to\ntime, owing to different circumstances, was at length arranged to take\nplace in September. This definite arrangement delighted the Saig\u00c3\u00bb, to\nwhom the uncertainty of the event had been somewhat tiresome. Her\nmother also made up her mind to accompany her to the temple. Although\nthere was no precedent for the mother of the Saig\u00c3\u00bb accompanying her\ndaughter, this lady made up her mind to do so, because she would not\nallow her young daughter to go alone.\n\nIn a suburban field the \"field palace\" was built.[89] It was of wood,\nand surrounded by a fence of newly cut branches of trees. In front\nstood a huge _torii_[90] of logs, and within the compound were the\nquarters of the Kandzkasa.[91] Here the Saig\u00c3\u00bb took up her residence,\nwhere her mother also accompanied her. When the sixteenth of\nSeptember, which was fixed for the departure, arrived, the ceremony of\nher last consecration was duly performed on the banks of the River\nKatzra, whence the sacred virgin went to the Imperial Palace to have\nthe farewell audience with the Emperor. She was accompanied by her\nmother. The father of the latter had been a great personage of State,\nand she had been married to a Royal Prince at sixteen, when there had\nbeen every possibility of her coming to the Court in a position far\nsuperior to what she now enjoyed. She was, however, bereaved of him at\nthe age of twenty; and now at thirty she comes to take leave at her\ndeparture for a far-off province with her only daughter. The Saig\u00c3\u00bb was\nabout fourteen years of age, was extremely delicate and fair to look\nupon, and when presented to the Emperor he was struck by the charms\nof her youthful appearance.\n\nNumerous carriages were ranged at the front of eight State departments\nto see her off in state, besides many others along the road, full of\nspectators.\n\nLate in the afternoon her party left the palace, and turned away from\nNiji\u00c3\u00b4 round to the highway of T\u00c3\u00b4in, and passed by the mansion of\nGenji, who witnessed their passing, and sent the following to the\nlady-mother with a twig of Sakaki (divine tree):--\n\n    \"Bravely you quit this scene, 'tis true;\n      But though you dauntless fly so far,\n    Your sleeve may yet be wet with dew,\n      Before you cross Suzukah.\"[92]\n\nThe answer to this was sent to him from beyond the barrier of Ausaka\n(meeting-path) in the following form:--\n\n    \"Whether my sleeve be wet or not,\n      In the waters of the Suzukah,\n    Who will care? Too soon forgot\n      Will Ise be that lies so far.\"\n\nAnd thus the Lady of Rokji\u00c3\u00b4 and her daughter disappear for some time\nfrom our scenes in the capital.\n\nIt was about this time that the ex-Emperor was indisposed for some\ntime, and in October his state became precarious. The anxiety of the\npublic was general, and the Emperor went to visit him. Notwithstanding\nhis weakness, the former gave him every injunction, first about the\nHeir-apparent, then about Genji, and said:--\n\n\"Regard him as your adviser, both in large and small matters, without\nreserve, and not otherwise than if I were still alive. He is not\nincapable of sharing in the administration of public affairs,\nnotwithstanding his youth. He has a physiognomy which argues great\nqualities, and for this reason, I made him remain in an ordinary\nposition, without creating him a Royal Prince, with the object that he\nshould be able to take part in public affairs. Do not misconstrue\nthese ideas.\"\n\nThere were some more injunctions given of like nature relating to\npublic matters, and the Emperor sorrowfully and repeatedly assured him\nthat he would not neglect them. Such, however, are not subjects which\nwe women are supposed to understand, and even thus much that I have\nmentioned is given not without some apprehension.\n\nA few days after the visit of the Emperor the Heir-apparent was\nbrought before his dying father. There had been some idea that he\nshould be brought on the day when the Emperor paid his visit, but it\nwas postponed to avoid any possible confusion. The boy Prince was\napparently more pleased at seeing his father than concerned at his\nillness. To him the ex-Emperor told many things, but he was too young\nto heed them. Genji was also present, and the ex-Emperor explained to\nhim in what way he should serve the Government, and how he should look\nafter this young Prince. When their interview concluded it was already\nmerging towards the evening, and the young Prince returned to the\npalace.\n\nThe Royal mother of the reigning Emperor (formerly Koki-den-Niogo)\nwould also have visited the ex-Emperor but for her repugnance to\nencounter the Princess Wistaria, who never left his side.\n\nIn the course of a few days the strength of the Emperor began to\ndecline, and at last he quietly and peacefully passed away.\n\nAnd now the Court went into general mourning, and Genji, being one of\nthe principal mourners, put on a dress of Wistaria cloth;[93] so\nfrequently did misfortune fall on him in the course of a few years,\nand his cares became really great.\n\nThe funeral and the weekly requiems were performed with all due pomp\nand ceremony, and when the forty-ninth day had passed, all the private\nhousehold of his late Majesty dispersed in the midst of the dreary\nweather of the latter part of December to their own homes; the\nPrincess Wistaria retiring to her own residence in Sanji\u00c3\u00b4, accompanied\nby her brother, Prince Hi\u00c3\u00b4bki\u00c3\u00b4.\n\nTrue, it is that his late Majesty had been for some time off the\nthrone, but his authority had by no means diminished on that account.\nBut his death now altered the state of things, and the ascendancy of\nthe family of Udaijin became assured. The people in general\nentertained great fear that infelicitous changes would take place in\npublic affairs, and among these Genji and the Princess Wistaria were\nthe most disturbed by such anxieties.\n\nThe new year came in, but nothing joyful or exciting accompanied its\npresence--the world was still.\n\nGenji kept himself to his mansion. In those days, when his father was\nstill in power, his courtyard was filled with the carriages of\nvisitors, especially when the days of the appointments were\napproaching; but now this was changed, and his household secretaries\nhad but little to occupy them.\n\nIn January the Princess Momo-zono (peach-gardens) was chosen for the\nSaiin, of the Temple of Kamo, her predecessor having retired from\noffice, on account of the mourning for her father, the late\nex-Emperor.\n\nThere were not many precedents for Princesses of the second generation\nbeing appointed to this position; but this Princess was so chosen,\nowing, it seems, to the circumstance that there was no immediate issue\nof the Imperial blood suitable for this office.\n\nIn February the youngest daughter of the Udaijin became the\nNaishi-no-Kami,[94] in the place of the former one, who had left\noffice and become a nun after the death of the ex-Emperor.\n\nShe took up her residence in the Kokiden, which was till lately\noccupied by her sister, the Empress-mother, who at this period spent\nmost of her time at her father's, and who when she came to the Court\nmade the Ume-Tsubo (the plum-chamber) her apartment.\n\nMeanwhile the Empress-mother, who was by nature sagacious and\nrevengeful, and who during the late Emperor's life had been fain to\ndisguise her spiteful feelings, now conceived designs of vengeance\nagainst those who had been adverse to her; and this spirit was\ndirected especially against Genji and his father-in-law,\nSadaijin--against the latter because he had married his only daughter\nto Genji against the wishes of the Emperor when Heir-apparent, and\nbecause during the life of the late Emperor his influence eclipsed\nthat of her father, Udaijin, who had long been his political\nadversary.\n\nThe Emperor, it is true, never forgot the dying injunctions of his\nfather, and never failed in sympathy with Genji; but he was still\nyoung, with a weak mind, and therefore he was under the influence of\nhis mother and grandfather, Udaijin, and was often constrained by\nthem in his actions to go contrary to his own wishes.\n\nSuch being the state of things, Sadaijin seldom appeared at Court, and\nhis loss of influence became manifest. Genji, too, had become less\nadventurous and more steady in his life; and in his mansion Violet\nbecame the favorite object of attraction, in whose behalf the ceremony\nof Mogi had been duly performed some time before, and who had been\npresented to her father. The latter had for a long time regarded her\nas lost, and even now he never forgave the way in which his daughter\nhad been taken away by Genji.\n\nThe summer had passed without any particular events, and autumn\narrived. Genji, wishing to have a little change, went to the monastery\nof Unlinin,[95] and spent some days in the chamber of a rissh\n(discipline-master), who was a brother of his mother. Maple-trees were\nchanging their tints, and the beautiful scenery around this spot made\nhim almost forget his home. His daily amusement was to gather together\nseveral monks, and make them discuss before him.\n\nHe himself perused the so-called \"sixty volumes,\"[96] and would get\nthe monks to explain any point which was not clear to his\nunderstanding.\n\nWhen he came to reflect on the various circumstances taking place in\nthe capital, he would have preferred remaining in his present\nretirement; but he could not forget one whom he had left behind there,\nand this caused him to return. After he had requested a splendid\nexpiatory service to be performed, he left the monastery. The monks\nand the neighbors came to see him depart. His carriage was still\nblack, and his sleeves were still of Wistaria, and in this gloomy\nstate he made his return to his mansion in Niji\u00c3\u00b4.\n\nHe brought back some twigs of maple, whose hues, when compared with\nthose in his own garden, he perceived were far more beautiful. He,\ntherefore, sent one of these to the residence of Princess Wistaria,\nwho had it put in a vase, and hung at the side of her veranda.\n\nNext day he went to the Imperial Palace, to see his brother the\nEmperor, who was passing a quiet and unoccupied leisure, and soon\nentered into a pleasant conversation on matters both past and present.\nThis Emperor, it must be remembered, was a person of quiet ways and\nmoderate ambition. He was kind in heart, and affectionate to his\nrelatives. His eyes were shut to the more objectionable actions of\nGenji. He talked with him on different topics of literature, and asked\nhis opinions on different questions. He also talked on several\npoetical subjects, and on the news of the day--of the departure of the\nSaig\u00c3\u00bb.\n\nThe conversation then led to the little Prince, the Heir-apparent. The\nEmperor said, \"Our father has enjoined me to adopt him as my son, and\nto be kind to him in every way; but he was always a favorite of mine,\nand this injunction was unnecessary, for I could not be any more\nparticularly kind to him. I am very glad that he is very clever for\nhis age in penmanship and the like.\"\n\nGenji replied, \"Yes, I also notice that he is of no ordinary promise;\nbut yet we must admit that his ability may be only partial.\"\n\nAfter this conversation Genji left. On his way he came across a nephew\nof the Empress-mother, who seems to have been a person of rather\narrogant and rough character. As he crossed Genji's path he stopped\nfor a minute, and loudly reciting,\n\n    \"The white rainbow crossed the sun,\n    And the Prince was frightened,\"[97]\n\npassed on. Genji at once understood what it was intended for, but\nprudently proceeded on his way homeward without taking any notice of\nit.\n\nLet us now proceed to the Princess Wistaria. Since she had been\nbereaved of the late Emperor she retired to her private residence. She\nfully participated in all those inglorious mortifications to which\nGenji and his father-in-law were subjected. She was convinced she\nwould never suffer such cruel treatment as that which Seki-Foojin[98]\ndid at the hands of her rival, but she was also convinced that some\nsort of misfortune was inevitable. These thoughts at last led her to\ndetermine to give up the world. The fortune of her child, however, had\nbeen long a subject of anxiety to her; and though she had determined\nto do so, the thought of him had affected her mind still more keenly.\nShe had hitherto rarely visited the Court, where he was residing; for\nher visits might be unpleasing to the feelings of her rival, the other\nex-Empress, and prejudicial to his interests.\n\nHowever, she now went there unceremoniously, in order to see him\nbefore she carried out her intention to retire. In the course of her\nchatting with him, she said, \"Suppose, that while I do not see you for\nsome time, my features become changed, what would you think?\"\n\nThe little Prince, who watched her face, replied, \"Like\nShikib?[99]--no--that can't be.\" The Princess smiled a little, and\nsaid, \"No, that is not so; Shikib's is changed by age, but suppose\nmine were different from hers, and my hair became shorter than hers,\nand I wore a black dress like a chaplain-in-waiting, and I could not\nsee you often, any longer.\" And she became a little sad, which made\nthe Prince also a little downcast.\n\nSerene was his face, and finely pencilled were his eyebrows. He was\ngrowing up fast, and his teeth were a little decayed and\nblackened,[100] which gave a peculiar beauty to his smile, and the\nprettiness of his appearance only served to increase her regret; and\nwith a profound pensiveness she returned to her residence.\n\nIn the middle of December she performed Mihakk\u00c3\u00b4 (a grand special\nservice on the anniversary of death), which she was carefully\npreparing for some days. The rolls of the Ki\u00c3\u00b4 (Buddhist Bible) used\nfor this occasion were made most magnificently--the spindle of jade,\nthe covering of rich satin, and its case of woven bamboo ornamented\nlikewise, as well as the flower-table.\n\nThe first day's ceremony was for her father, the second for her\nmother, and the third for the late Emperor. Several nobles were\npresent, and participated, Genji being one of them. Different presents\nwere made by them all. At the end of the third day's performance her\nvows of retirement were, to the surprise of all, announced by the\npriest. At the conclusion of the whole ceremony, the chief of the Hiye\nmonastery, whom she had sent for, arrived, and from whom she received\nthe \"commandments.\" She then had her hair cut off by her uncle, Bishop\nof Yokogawa.\n\nThese proceedings cast a gloom over the minds of all present, but\nespecially on those of Hi\u00c3\u00b4b-Ki\u00c3\u00b4, her brother, and Genji; and soon\nafter every one departed for his home.\n\nAnother New Year came in, and the aspect of the Court was brighter. A\nroyal banquet and singing dances were soon expected to take place, but\nthe Princess Wistaria no longer took any heed of them, and most of her\ntime was devoted to prayer in a new private chapel, which she had had\nbuilt expressly for herself in her grounds.\n\nGenji came to pay his New Year's visit on the seventh day, but he saw\nno signs of the season. All nobles who used to pay visits of\nfelicitation, now shunned her house and gathered at the mansion of\nUdaijin, near her own. The only things which caught Genji's attention\nin her mansion was a white horse,[101] which was being submitted to\nher inspection as on former occasions. When he entered, he noticed\nthat all the hangings of the room and the dresses of the inmates were\nof the dark hues of conventual life. The only things that there seemed\nto herald spring, were the melting of the thin ice on the surface of\nthe lake, and the budding of the willows on its banks. The scene\nsuggested many reflections to his mind; and, after the usual greetings\nof the season, and a short conversation, he quitted the mansion.\n\nIt should be here noticed that none of her household officers received\nany promotion or appointment to any sinecure office, or honorary\ntitle, even where the merit of the individual deserved it, or the\nCourt etiquette required it. Nay, even the proper income for her\nhousehold expenses was, under different pretexts, neglected. As for\nthe Princess, she must have been prepared for such inevitable\nconsequences of her giving up the world; but it ought not to be taken\nas implying that the sacrifice should be so great. Hence these facts\ncaused much disappointment to her household, and the mind of the\nPrincess herself was sometimes moved by feelings of mortification.\nNevertheless, troubled about herself no longer, she only studied the\nwelfare and prosperity of her child, and persevered in the most\ndevout prayers for this. She also remembered a secret sin, still\nunknown to the world, which tormented the recesses of her soul, and\nshe was constantly praying to Buddha to lighten her burden.\n\nAbout the same time, tired of the world, both public and private,\nSadaijin sent in his resignation. The Emperor had not forgotten how\nmuch he was respected by the late ex-Emperor, how the latter had\nenjoined him always to regard him as a support of the country, and he\nseveral times refused to accept his resignation; but Sadaijin\npersevered in his request, and confined himself to his own mansion.\nThis gave complete ascendancy to the family of Udaijin. All the sons\nof Sadaijin, who formerly had enjoyed considerable distinction at\nCourt, were now fast sinking into insignificance, and had very little\ninfluence. T\u00c3\u00b4-no-Chi\u00c3\u00bbji\u00c3\u00b4, the eldest of them, was one of those\naffected by the change of circumstances. True, he was married to the\nfourth daughter of Udaijin; but he passed little time with her, she\nstill residing with her father, and he was not among the favorite\nsons-in-law. His name was also omitted in the appointment list on\npromotion day, which seems to have been intended by his father-in-law\nas a warning.\n\nUnder such circumstances he was constantly with Genji, and they\nstudied and played together. They both well remembered how they used\nto compete with each other in such matters as studying and playing,\nand they still kept their rivalry alive. They would sometimes send for\nsome scholars, and would compose poems together, or play the \"Covering\nRhymes.\"[102] They seldom appeared at Court, while in the outer world\ndifferent scandals about them were increasing day by day.\n\nOne day in summer T\u00c3\u00b4-no-Chi\u00c3\u00bbji\u00c3\u00b4 came to pay his usual visit to Genji.\nHe had brought by his page several interesting books, and Genji also\nordered several rare books from his library. Many scholars were sent\nfor, in such a manner as not to appear too particular; and many nobles\nand University students were also present. They were divided into two\nparties, the right and the left, and began betting on the game of\n\"Covering Rhymes.\" Genji headed the right, and T\u00c3\u00b4-no-Chi\u00c3\u00bbji\u00c3\u00b4 the left.\nTo his credit the former often hit on the most difficult rhymes, with\nwhich the scholars were puzzled. At last the left was beaten by the\nright, consequently T\u00c3\u00b4-no-Chi\u00c3\u00bbji\u00c3\u00b4 gave an entertainment to the party,\nas arranged in their bet.\n\nThey also amused themselves by writing prose and verse. Some roses\nwere blossoming in front of the veranda, which possessed a quiet charm\ndifferent from those of the full season of spring.\n\nThe sight of these afforded them a delightful enjoyment while they\nwere partaking of refreshment. A son of T\u00c3\u00b4-no-Chi\u00c3\u00bbji\u00c3\u00b4, about eight or\nnine years old, was present. He was the second boy by his wife,\nUdaijin's daughter, and a tolerable player on the S\u00c3\u00b4h-flute. Both his\ncountenance and disposition were amiable. The party was in full\nenjoyment when the boy rose and sang \"Takasago\" (high sand).[103] When\nhe proceeded to the last clause of his song,\n\n    \"Oh, could I see that lovely flower,\n    That blossomed this morn!\"\n\nT\u00c3\u00b4-no-Chi\u00c3\u00bbji\u00c3\u00b4 offered his cup to Genji, saying,\n\n    \"How glad am I to see your gentleness,\n    Sweet as the newly blooming flower!\"\n\nGenji, smiling, took the cup as he replied,\n\n    \"Yet that untimely flower, I fear,\n    The rain will beat, the wind will tear,\n    Ere it be fully blown.\"\n\nAnd added,\n\n    \"Oh, I myself am but a sere leaf.\"\n\nGenji was pressed by T\u00c3\u00b4-no-Chi\u00c3\u00bbji\u00c3\u00b4 to take several more cups, and his\nhumor reached its height. Many poems, both in Chinese and Japanese,\nwere composed by those present, most of whom paid high compliment to\nGenji. He felt proud, and unconsciously exclaimed, \"The son of King\nYuen, the brother of King Mu;\" and would have added, \"the King Ching's\n----\"[104] but there he paused.\n\nTo describe the scene which followed at a time such as this, when\nevery mind is not in due equilibrium, is against the warning of\nTsurayuki, the poet, so I will here pass over the rest.\n\nNaishi-no-Kami, the young daughter of Udaijin, now retired to her home\nfrom the Court, having been attacked by ague; and the object of her\nretirement was to enjoy rest and repose, as well as to have spells\nperformed for her illness.\n\nThis change did her great good, and she speedily recovered from the\nattack.\n\nWe had mentioned before that she always had a tender yearning for\nGenji, and she was the only one of her family who entertained any\nsympathy or good feeling towards him. She had seen, for some time, the\nlack of consideration and the indifference with which he was treated\nby her friends, and used to send messages of kind inquiry. Genji, on\nhis part also, had never forgotten her, and the sympathy which she\nshowed towards him excited in his heart the most lively appreciation.\n\nThese mutual feelings led at length to making appointments for meeting\nduring her retirement. Genji ran the risk of visiting her secretly in\nher own apartments. This was really hazardous, more especially so\nbecause her sister, the Empress-mother, was at this time staying in\nthe same mansion. We cannot regard either the lady or Genji as\nentirely free from the charge of imprudence, which, on his part, was\nprincipally the result of his old habits of wandering.\n\nIt was on a summer's evening that Genji contrived to see her in her\nown apartment, and while they were conversing, a thunderstorm suddenly\nbroke forth, and all the inmates got up and ran to and fro in their\nexcitement. Genji had lost the opportunity of escape, and, besides,\nthe dawn had already broken.\n\nWhen the storm became lighter and the thunder ceased, Udaijin went\nfirst to the room of his royal daughter, and then to that of\nNaishi-no-Kami. The noise of the falling rain made his footsteps\ninaudible, and all unexpectedly he appeared at the door and said:\n\"What a storm it has been! Were you not frightened?\"\n\nThis voice startled both Genji and the lady. The former hid himself on\none side of the room, and the latter stepped forth to meet her father.\nHer face was deeply flushed, which he soon noticed. He said, \"You seem\nstill excited; is your illness not yet quite passed?\" While he was so\nsaying he caught sight of the sash of a man's cloak, twisted round her\nskirt.\n\n\"How strange!\" thought he. The next moment he noticed some papers\nlying about, on which something had been scribbled. \"This is more\nstrange!\" he thought again; and exclaimed, \"Whose writings are these?\"\nAt this request she looked aside, and all at once noticed the sash\nround her skirt, and became quite confused. Udaijin was a man of quiet\nnature; so, without distressing her further, bent down to pick up the\npapers, when by so doing he perceived a man behind the screen, who was\napparently in great confusion and was endeavoring to hide his face.\nHowever, Udaijin soon discovered who he was, and without any further\nremarks quitted the room, taking the papers with him.\n\nThe troubled state of Genji and the lady may be easily imagined, and\nin great anxiety he left the scene.\n\nNow it was the character of Udaijin that he could never keep anything\nto himself, even his thoughts. He therefore went to the eldest\ndaughter--that is, the Empress-mother, and told her that he had found\npapers which clearly were in the handwriting of Genji, and that though\nventuresomeness is the characteristic of men, such conduct as that\nwhich Genji had indulged in was against all propriety. \"People said,\"\ncontinued Udaijin, \"that he was always carrying on a correspondence\nwith the present Saiin. Were this true, it would not only be against\npublic decorum, but his own interest; although I did not entertain any\nsuspicion before.\"\n\nWhen the sagacious Empress-mother heard this, her anger was something\nfearful. \"See the Emperor,\" she said; \"though he is Emperor, how\nlittle he is respected! When he was Heir-apparent, the ex-Sadaijin,\nnot having presented his daughter to him, gave her to Genji, then a\nmere boy, on the eve of his Gembuk; and now this Genji boldly dares to\ncarry on such intrigues with a lady who is intended to be the Royal\nconsort! How daring, also, is his correspondence with the sacred\nSaiin! On the whole, his conduct, in every respect, does not appear to\nbe as loyal as might be expected, and this only seems to arise from\nhis looking forward to the ascent of the young Prince to the throne.\"\n\nUdaijin somehow felt the undesirability of this anger, and he began to\nchange his tone, and tried to soothe her, saying: \"You have some\nreason for being so affected; yet don't disclose such matters to the\npublic, and pray don't tell it to the Emperor. It is, of course, an\nimpropriety on the part of the Prince, but we must admit that our\ngirl, also, would not escape censure. We had better first warn her\nprivately among ourselves; and if the matter does not even then come\nall right, I will myself be responsible for that.\"\n\nThe Empress-mother, however, could not calm her angry feelings. It\nstruck her as a great disrespect to her dignity, on Genji's part, to\nventure to intrude into the very mansion where she was staying. And\nshe began to meditate how to turn this incident into a means of\ncarrying out the design which she had been forming for some time.\n\nFOOTNOTES:\n\n[Footnote 89: A temporary residence expressly built for the Saig\u00c3\u00bb to\nundergo purification.]\n\n[Footnote 90: A peculiar gate erected in front of the sacred places.]\n\n[Footnote 91: Shinto priests.]\n\n[Footnote 92: Name of a river of the province of Ise, which the\ntravellers had to cross.]\n\n[Footnote 93: A dress made of the bark of the Wistaria was worn by\nthose who were in deep mourning for near relatives.]\n\n[Footnote 94: This was an office held by a Court lady, whose duty it\nwas to act as a medium of communication in the transmitting of\nmessages between the Emperor and State officials.]\n\n[Footnote 95: It is said that the tomb of the authoress of this work\nis to be found at this spot.]\n\n[Footnote 96: In the Tendai sect of Buddhists there are sixty volumes\nof the theological writings which are considered most authoritative\nfor their doctrine.]\n\n[Footnote 97: A passage of a Chinese history.

One incident, however, deserves a brief notice before\nwe enter into the main consequences of these troubles.\n\nThere was a lady who had been a Niogo at the Court of the late\nex-Emperor, and who was called Reikeiden-Niogo, from the name of her\nchamber. She had borne no child to him, and after his death she,\ntogether with a younger sister, was living in straitened\ncircumstances. Genji had long known both of them, and they were often\naided by the liberality with which he cheerfully assisted them, both\nfrom feelings of friendship, and out of respect to his late father.\n\nHe, at this time, kept himself quiet at his own home, but he now paid\nthese ladies a visit one evening, when the weather, after a\nlong-continued rain, had cleared up. He conversed with them on topics\nof past times until late in the evening. The waning moon threw her\nfaint light over the tall trees standing in the garden, which spread\ntheir dark shadows over the ground. From among them an orange-tree in\nfull blossom poured forth its sweet perfume, and a Hototo-gisu[105]\nflew over it singing most enchantingly.\n\n\"'Ah! how he recollects his own friend!'\" said Genji, and continued:--\n\n    \"To this home of 'falling flower,'\n      The odors bring thee back again,\n    And now thou sing'st, in evening hour,\n      Thy faithful loving strain.\"\n\nTo this the elder lady replied:--\n\n    \"At the home where one lives, all sadly alone,\n      And the shadow of friendship but seldom is cast,\n    These blossoms reach the bright days that are gone\n      And bring to our sadness the joys of the past.\"\n\nAnd, after a long and friendly conversation, Genji returned to his\nhome. One may say that the character of Genji was changeable, it is\ntrue, yet we must do him justice for his kind-heartedness to his old\nacquaintances such as these two sisters, and this would appear to be\nthe reason why he seldom estranged the hearts of those whom he liked.\n\nFOOTNOTES:\n\n[Footnote 105: The name of a small bird which appears about the time\nwhen the orange trees are in blossom. It sings, and is most active in\nthe evening. In poetry, therefore, the orange blossom and this bird\nare associated, and they are both, the blossom and the bird, emblems\nof old memories.]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII\n\nEXILE AT SUMA\n\n\nGenji at last made up his mind to undergo a voluntary exile, before\nthe opinion of the Imperial Court should be publicly announced against\nhim. He heard that the beautiful sea-coast along Suma was a most\nsuitable place for retirement, and that, though formerly populous,\nthere were now only a few fishermen's dwellings scattered here and\nthere. To Suma he finally determined to go into voluntary exile.\n\nWhen he had thus made up his mind he became somewhat regretful to\nleave the capital, although it had hitherto appeared ungenial. The\nfirst thing which disturbed his mind was the young Violet, whom he\ncould not take with him. The young lady, also, in the \"Villa of\nFalling Flowers\" (notwithstanding that he was not a frequent visitor)\nwas another object of his regret.\n\nIn spite of these feelings he prepared to set off at the end of March,\nand at length it came within a few days of the time fixed for his\ndeparture, when he went privately, under the cover of the evening, to\nthe mansion of the ex-Sadaijin, in an ajiro carriage, generally used\nby women. He proceeded into the inner apartments, where he was greeted\nby the nurse of his little child. The boy was growing fast, was able\nto stand by this time and to toddle about, and run into Genji's arms\nwhen he saw him. The latter took him on his knee, saying, \"Ah! my good\nlittle fellow, I have not seen you for some time, but you do not\nforget me, do you?\" The ex-Sadaijin now entered. He said, \"Often have\nI thought of coming to have a talk with you, but you see my health has\nbeen very bad of late, and I seldom appear at Court, having resigned\nmy office. It would be impolitic to give cause to be talked about, and\nfor it to be said that I stretch my old bones when private matters\nplease me. Of course, I have no particular reason to fear the world;\nstill, if there is anything dreadful, it is the demagogical world.\nWhen I see what unpleasant things are happening to you, which were no\nmore probable than that the heavens should fall, I really feel that\neverything in the world is irksome to me.\"\n\n\"Yes, what you say is indeed true,\" replied Genji. \"However, all\nthings in the world--this or that--are the outcome of what we have\ndone in our previous existence. Hence if we dive to the bottom we\nshall see that every misfortune is only the result of our own\nnegligence. Examples of men's losing the pleasures of the Court are,\nindeed, not wanting. Some of these cases may not go so far as a\ndeprivation of titles and honors, as is mine;[106] still, if one thus\nbanished from the pleasures of Court, behaves himself as unconcernedly\nas those to whom no such misfortune has happened, this would not be\nbecoming. So, at least, it is considered in a foreign country.\nRepentance is what one ought to expect in such circumstances, and\nbanishment to a far-off locality is a measure generally adopted for\noffences different from ordinary ones. If I, simply relying on my\ninnocence, pass unnoticed the recent displeasure of the Court, this\nwould only bring upon me greater dishonor. I have, therefore,\ndetermined to go into voluntary exile, before receiving such a\nsentence from the Court.\"\n\nThen the conversation fell back, as usual, on the times of the late\nex-Emperor, which made them sad; while the child also, who innocently\nplayed near, made them still more gloomy. The ex-Sadaijin went on to\nsay:--\"There is no moment when I ever forget the mother of the boy,\nbut now I almost dare to think that she was fortunate in being short\nlived, and being free from witnessing the dreamlike sorrow we now\nsuffer. With regard to the boy, the first thing which strikes me as\nunbearable is that he may pass some time of his lovely childhood away\nfrom the gaze of your eyes. There are, as you say, no want of\ninstances of persons suffering a miserable fate, without having\ncommitted any real offence; yet still, in such cases, there was some\npretext to justify their being so treated. I cannot see any such\nagainst you.\"\n\nWhile he was thus speaking T\u00c3\u00b4-no-Chi\u00c3\u00bbji\u00c3\u00b4 joined them, and, partaking\nof _sak\u00c3\u00a9_, they continued their conversation till late in the\nevening. This night Genji remained in the mansion.\n\nEarly the next morning he returned to his own residence, and he spent\nthe whole day with Violet in the western wing. It should here be\nnoticed that she was scarcely ever with her father, even from\nchildhood. He strongly disapproved of his daughter being with Genji,\nand of the way in which she had been carried off, so he scarcely ever\nhad any communication with her, or did he visit her. These\ncircumstances made her feel Genji's affection more keenly than she\notherwise would have; hence her sorrow at the thought of parting with\nhim in a few days may be easily imagined.\n\nTowards the evening Prince Sotz came with T\u00c3\u00b4-no-Chi\u00c3\u00bbji\u00c3\u00b4 and some\nothers to pay him a visit. Genji, in order to receive them, rose to\nput on one of his Naoshi, which was plain, without pattern, as proper\nfor one who had no longer a title. Approaching the mirror, to comb his\nhair, he noticed that his face had grown much thinner.\n\n\"Oh, how changed I appear,\" he exclaimed. \"Am I really like this image\nwhich I see of myself?\" he said, turning to the girl, who cast on him\na sad and tearful glance. Genji continued:--\n\n    \"Though changed I wander far away,\n      My soul shall still remain with you,\n    Perhaps in this mirror's mystic ray,\n      My face may linger still in view.\"\n\nTo this Violet replied:--\n\n    \"If in this mirror I could see,\n    Always your face, then it would be\n    My consolation when thou art gone.\"\n\nAs she said this she turned her face to one side of the room, and by\ndoing so obscured the tears gathering in her soft eyes. Genji then\nleft her to receive his friends, who, however, did not remain long,\nleaving the mansion after a short conversation of a consolatory\nnature. This evening Genji paid his visit to the sisters of the\n\"Falling Flower\" villa.\n\nOn the following day the final arrangements necessary for his\nhousehold affairs were made at his residence. The management of the\nmansion was intrusted to a few confidential friends; while that of his\nlands and pasture, and the charge of his documents, were intrusted to\nthe care of Violet, to whom he gave every instruction what she should\ndo. Besides, he enjoined Shi\u00c3\u00b4nagon, in whom he placed his confidence,\nto give her every assistance. He told all the inmates who wished to\nremain in the mansion, in order to await his return, that they might\ndo so. He also made an appropriate present to the nurse of his boy,\nand to the ladies of the \"Villa of Falling Flowers.\" When all these\nthings were accomplished, he occupied himself in writing farewell\nletters to his intimate friends, such as the young daughter of Udaijin\nand others, to none of whom he had paid a visit.\n\nOn the evening prior to his departure he went on horseback to visit\nthe tomb of his father. On his way he called on the Princess Wistaria,\nand thence proceeded to the mountain where the remains reposed. The\ntomb was placed among tall growing grass, under thick and gloomy\nfoliage. Genji advanced to the tomb, and, half kneeling down before\nit, and half sobbing, uttered many words of remembrance and sorrow. Of\ncourse no reply came forth. The moon by this time was hidden behind\ndark clouds, and the winds blew keen and nipping, when suddenly a\nshadowy phantom of the dead stood before Genji's eyes.\n\n    \"How would his image look on me,\n      Knew he the secret of the past;\n    As yonder moon in clouded sky,\n      Looks o'er the scene mysteriously.\"\n\nHe returned to his mansion late in the night.\n\nEarly in the morning he sent a letter to \u00c3\u0094 Mi\u00c3\u00b4bu, the nurse of the\nHeir-apparent, in which he said: \"I at last leave the capital, to-day.\nI know not when I may come and see the Prince again. On him my\nthoughts and anxieties are concentrated, above all else. Realize these\nfeelings in your own mind, and tell them to him.\" He also sent the\nfollowing, fastened to a bough of cherry flowers, already becoming\nthin:--\n\n    \"When shall I see these scenes again,\n      And view the flowers of spring in bloom,\n    Like rustic from his mountain home,\n      A mere spectator shall I come?\"\n\nThese were carefully read by \u00c3\u0094 Mi\u00c3\u00b4bu to the Prince, and when he was\nasked what she should write in answer, he said: \"Write that I said\nthat since I feel every longing to see him, when I do not see him for\na long time, how shall I feel when he goes away altogether?\" Thereupon\nshe wrote an answer, in which she indefinitely stated that she had\nshown the letter to the Prince, whose answer was simple, yet very\naffectionate, and so on, with the following:--\n\n    \"'Tis sad that fair blossoms so soon fade away,\n      In the darkness of winter no flower remains,\n    But let spring return with its sunshiny ray,\n      Then once more the flowers we look on again.\"\n\nNow, with regard to the recent disgrace of Genji, the public in\ngeneral did not approve of the severity which the Court had shown to\nhim. Moreover, he had been constantly with the Emperor, his father,\nsince the age of seven, and his requests had been always cheerfully\nlistened to by the latter; hence there were very many, especially\namong public servants of the ordinary class, who were much indebted to\nhim. However, none of them now came to pay their respects to him. It\nseems that in a world of intrigue none dares do what is right for fear\nof risking his own interests. Such being the state of things, Genji,\nduring the whole day, was unoccupied, and the time was entirely spent\nwith Violet. Then, at his usual late hour in the evening, he, in a\ntravelling dress of incognito, at length left the capital, where he\nhad passed five-and-twenty years of his life.\n\nHis attendants, Koremitz and Yoshikiyo being among them, were seven or\neight in number. He took with him but little luggage. All ostentatious\nrobes, all unnecessary articles of luxury were dispensed with. Among\nthings taken, was a box containing the works of Hak-rak-ten (a famous\nChinese poet), with other books, and besides these a _kin-koto_ for\nhis amusement. They embarked in a boat and sailed down the river.\nEarly the next morning they arrived at the sea-coast of Naniwa. They\nnoticed the \u00c3\u0094ye Palace standing lonely amidst the group of pine trees.\nThe sight of this palace gave a thrill of sadness to Genji, who was\nnow leaving, and not returning, home. He saw the waves rolling on the\ncoast and again sweep back. He hummed, as he saw them:--\n\n    \"The waves roll back, but unlike me,\n      They come again.\"\n\nFrom Naniwa they continued their voyage, sailing in the bay. As they\nproceeded they looked back on the scenes they had left. They saw all\nthe mountains veiled in haze, growing more and more distant, while the\nrowers gently pulled against the rippling waves. It seemed to them as\nif they were really going \"three thousand miles' distance.\"[107]\n\n    \"Our home is lost in the mist of the mountain,\n      Let us gaze on the sky which is ever the same.\"\n\nThe day was long and the wind was fair, so they soon arrived at the\ncoast of Suma.[108] The place was near the spot where the exiled\nYukihira had lived, and had watched the beautiful smoke rising from\nthe salt ovens. There was a thatched house in which the party\ntemporarily took up their residence. It was a very different home from\nwhat they had been used to, and it might have appeared even novel, had\nthe circumstances of their coming there been different. The\nauthorities of the neighborhood were sent for, and a lodge was built\nunder the direction of Yoshikiyo, in accordance with Genji's wishes.\nThe work was hurried on, and the building was soon completed. In the\ngarden, several trees, cherries and others, were planted, and water\nwas also conducted into it. Here Genji soon took up his abode. The\nGovernor of the province, who had been at Court, secretly paid\nattention to the Prince, with as much respect as was possible.\n\nFor some time Genji did not feel settled in his new residence. When he\nhad become in some degree accustomed to it, the season of continuous\nrain had arrived (May); his thoughts more than ever reverted to the\nold capital.\n\nThe thoughtful expression of Violet's face, the childish affection of\nthe Heir-apparent, and the innocent playfulness of his little son,\nbecame the objects of his reveries and anxiety, nor did he forget his\nold companions and acquaintances. He, therefore, sent a special\nmessenger to the capital bearing his letters, so that speedy answers\nmight be returned from every quarter. He also sent a messenger to Ise\nto make inquiry after the lady, who also sent one to him in return.\n\nNow the young daughter of Udaijin had been remaining repentingly in\nthe mansion of her father since the events of the stormy evening. Her\nfather felt much for her, and interceded with the Empress-mother in\nher behalf, and also with her son, that is, the Emperor, thus getting\npermission to introduce her once more into Court, an event which took\nplace in the month of July.\n\nTo return to Suma. The rainy season had passed, and autumn arrived.\nThe sea was at some distance from the residence of Genji, but the dash\nof its waves sounded close to their ears as the winds passed by, of\nwhich Yukihira sang,\n\n    \"The autumn wind which passes the barrier of Suma.\"\n\nThe autumn winds are, it seems, in such a place as this, far more\nplaintive than elsewhere.\n\nIt happened one evening that when all the attendants were fast asleep\nGenji was awake and alone. He raised his head and rested his arms on\nhis pillow and listened to the sound of the waves which reached his\near from a distance. They seemed nearer than ever, as though they were\ncoming to flood his pillows. He drew his _koto_ towards him and struck\na melancholy air, as he hummed a verse of a poem in a low tone. With\nthis every one awoke and responded with a sigh.\n\nSuch was a common occurrence in the evening, and Genji always felt\nsaddened whenever he came to think that all his attendants had\naccompanied him, having left their families and homes simply for his\nsake. In the daytime, however, there were changes. He would then enjoy\npleasant conversations. He also joined several papers into long rolls\non which he might practise penmanship. He spent a good deal of time in\ndrawing and sketching. He remembered how Yoshikiyo, on one occasion in\nMount Kurama, had described the beautiful scenery of the place on\nwhich he was now gazing. He sketched every beautiful landscape of the\nneighborhood, and collected them in albums, thinking how nice it would\nbe if he could send for Tsunenori, a renowned contemporary artist, and\nget him to paint the sketches which he had made.\n\nOut of all the attendants of Genji there were four or five who had\nbeen more especially his favorites, and who had constantly attended on\nhim. One evening they were all sitting together in a corridor which\ncommanded a full view of the sea. They perceived the island of Awaji\nlying in the distance, as if it were floating on the horizon, and also\nseveral boats with sailors, singing as they rowed to the shore over\nthe calm surface of the water, like waterfowl in their native element.\nOver their heads flocks of wild geese rustled on their way homeward\nwith their plaintive cry, which made the thoughts of the spectators\nrevert to their homes. Genji hummed this verse:--\n\n    \"Those wandering birds above us flying,\n      Do they our far-off friends resemble.\n    With their voice of plaintive crying\n      Make us full of thoughtful sighing.\"\n\nYoshikiyo took up the idea and replied:--\n\n    \"Though these birds no friends of ours\n      Are, and we to them are nought,\n    Yet their voice in these still hours\n      Bring those old friends to our thought.\"\n\nThen Koremitz continued:--\n\n    \"Before to-day I always thought\n      They flew on pleasure's wing alone,\n    But now their fate to me is fraught\n      With some resemblance to our own.\"\n\nUkon-no-Ji\u00c3\u00b4 added:--\n\n    \"Though we, like them, have left our home\n      To wander forth, yet still for me\n    There's joy to think where'er I roam\n      My faithful friends are still with me.\"\n\nUkon-no-Ji\u00c3\u00b4 was the brother of Ki-no-Kami. His father, Iyo-no-Kami,\nhad now been promoted to be Hitachi-no-Kami (Governor of Hitachi), and\nhad gone down to that province, but Ukon-no-Ji\u00c3\u00b4 did not join his\nfather, who would have gladly taken him, and faithfully followed\nGenji.\n\nThis evening happened to be the fifteenth of August, on which day a\npleasant reunion is generally held at the Imperial Palace. Genji\nlooked at the silvery pale sky, and as he did so the affectionate face\nof the Emperor, his brother, whose expression strikingly resembled\ntheir father's, presented itself to his mind. After a deep and long\nsigh, he returned to his couch, humming as he went:--\n\n    \"Here is still a robe\n      His Majesty gave to me.\"\n\nIt should be here noticed that he had been presented by the Emperor on\na certain occasion with a robe, and this robe he had never parted\nwith, even in his exile.\n\nAbout this time Daini (the senior Secretary of the Lord-Lieutenant of\nKi\u00c3\u00bbsi\u00c3\u00bb) returned to the capital with his family, having completed his\nofficial term. His daughter had been a virgin dancer, and was known to\nGenji. They preferred to travel by water, and slowly sailed up along\nthe beautiful coast. When they arrived at Suma, the distant sound of a\n_kin_[109] was heard, mingled with the sea-coast wind, and they were\ntold that Genji was there in exile. Daini therefore sent his son\nChikzen-no-Kami to the Prince with these words: \"Coming back from a\ndistant quarter I expected as soon as I should arrive in the capital\nto have had the pleasure of visiting you and listening to your\npleasant voice, and talking of events which have taken place there,\nbut little did I think that you had taken up your residence in this\npart of the country. How greatly do I sympathize with you! I ought to\nland and see you at once, but there are too many people in the same\nboat, therefore I think it better to avoid the slightest grounds which\nmay cause them to talk. However, possibly I shall pay you a visit\nsoon.\"\n\nThis Chikzen-no-Kami had been for some time previously a Kurand (a\nsort of equerry) to Genji, therefore his visit was especially welcome\nto him. He said that since he had left the capital it had become\ndifficult to see any of his acquaintances, and that therefore this\nespecial visit was a great pleasure to him. His reply to the message\nof Daini was to the same effect. Chikzen-no-Kami soon took his leave,\nand returning to the boat, reported to his father and others all he\nhad seen. His sister also wrote to Genji privately thus: \"Pray excuse\nme if I am too bold.\n\n    Know you not the mind is swayed\n      Like the tow-rope of our boat,\n    At the sounds your Kin has made,\n      Which around us sweetly float.\"\n\nWhen Genji received this, his pleasure was expressed by his placid\nsmile, and he sent back the following:--\n\n    \"If this music moves the mind\n      So greatly as you say,\n    No one would care to leave behind\n      These lonely waves of Suma's bay.\"\n\nThis recalls to our mind that there was in the olden time an exile\nwho gave a stanza even to the postmaster of a village.[110] Why then\nshould not Genji have sent to her whom he knew this stanza?\n\nIn the meantime, as time went on, more sympathizers with Genji were\nfound in the capital, including no less a personage than the Emperor\nhimself. True it is that before Genji left, many even of his relatives\nand most intimate friends refrained from paying their respects to him,\nbut in the course of time not a few began to correspond with him, and\nsometimes they communicated their ideas to each other in pathetic\npoetry. These things reached the ears of the Empress-mother, who was\ngreatly irritated by them. She said: \"The only thing a man who has\noffended the Court should do is to keep himself as quiet as possible.\nIt is most unpardonable that such a man should haughtily cause scandal\nto the Court from his humble dwelling. Does he intend to imitate the\ntreacherous example of one who made a deer pass for a horse?[111]\nThose who intrigue with such a man are equally blamable.\" These\nspiteful remarks once more put a stop to the correspondence.\n\nMeanwhile, at Suma, the autumn passed away and winter succeeded, with\nall its dreariness of scene, and with occasional falls of snow. Genji\noften spent the evening in playing upon the Kin, being accompanied by\nKoremitz's flute and the singing of Yoshikiyo. It was on one of these\nevenings that the story of a young Chinese Court lady, who had been\nsent to the frozen land of barbarians, occurred to Genji's mind. He\nthought what a great trial it would be if one were obliged to send\naway one whom he loved, like the lady in the tale, and as he reflected\non this, with some melancholy feelings, it appeared to him as vividly\nas if it were only an event of yesterday, and he hummed:--\n\n    \"The sound of the piper's distant strain\n      Broke on her dreams in the frozen eve.\"\n\nHe then tried to sleep, but could not do so, and as he lay the distant\ncry of Chidori reached his ears.[112] He hummed again as he heard\nthem:--\n\n    \"Although on lonely couch I lie\n      Without a mate, yet still so near,\n    At dawn the cries of Chidori,\n      With their fond mates, 'tis sweet to hear.\"\n\nHaving washed his hands, he spent some time in reading a Ki\u00c3\u00b4 (Sutra),\nand in this manner the winter-time passed away.\n\nTowards the end of February the young cherry-trees which Genji had\nplanted in his garden blossomed, and this brought to his memory the\nwell-known cherry-tree in the Southern Palace, and the _f\u00c3\u00aate_ in which\nhe had taken part. The noble countenance of the late ex-Emperor, and\nthat of the present one, the then Heir-apparent, which had struck him\nmuch at that time, returned to his recollection with the scene where\nhe had read out his poem.\n\n    \"While on the lordly crowd I muse,\n      Which haunts the Royal festive hours,\n    The day has come when I've put on\n      The crown of fairest cherry flowers.\"\n\nWhile thus meditating on the past, strange to say, T\u00c3\u00b4-no-Chi\u00c3\u00bbji\u00c3\u00b4,\nGenji's brother-in-law, came from the capital to see the Prince. He\nhad been now made Saishi\u00c3\u00b4 (privy councillor). Having, therefore, more\nresponsibility, he had to be more cautious in dealing with the public.\nHe had, however, a personal sympathy with Genji, and thus came to see\nhim, at the risk of offending the Court.\n\nThe first thing which struck his eyes was, not the natural beauty of\nthe scenery, but the style of Genji's residence, which showed the\nnovelty of pure Chinese fashion. The enclosure was surrounded by \"a\ntrellis-work of bamboo,\" with \"stone steps,\" and \"pillars of\npine-tree.\"[113]\n\nHe entered, and the pleasure of Genji and T\u00c3\u00b4-no-Chi\u00c3\u00bbji\u00c3\u00b4 was immense,\nso much so that they shed tears. The style of the Prince's dress next\nattracted the attention of T\u00c3\u00b4-no-Chi\u00c3\u00bbji\u00c3\u00b4. He was habited in a plain,\nsimple country style, the coat being of an unforbidden color, a dull\nyellow, the trousers of a subdued green.\n\nThe furniture was all of a temporary nature, with Go and Sugorok\nplaying boards, as well as one for the game of Dagi. He noticed some\narticles for the services of religion, showing that Genji was wont to\nindulge in devotional exercises. The visitor told Genji many things on\nthe subject of affairs in the capital, which he had been longing to\nimpart to him for many months past; telling him also how the\ngrandfather of his boy always delighted in playing with him, and\ngiving him many more interesting details.\n\nSeveral fishermen came with the fish which they had caught. Genji\ncalled them in and made them show their spoils. He also led them to\ntalk of their lives spent on the sea, and each in his own peculiar\nlocal dialect gave him a narration of his joys and sorrows. He then\ndismissed them with the gift of some stuff to make them clothing. All\nthis was quite a novelty to the eyes of T\u00c3\u00b4-no-Chi\u00c3\u00bbji\u00c3\u00b4, who also saw\nthe stable in which he obtained a glimpse of some horses. The\nattendants at the time were feeding them. Dinner was presently served,\nat which the dishes were necessarily simple, yet tasteful. In the\nevening they did not retire to rest early, but spent their time in\ncontinuing their conversation and in composing verses.\n\nAlthough T\u00c3\u00b4-no-Chi\u00c3\u00bbji\u00c3\u00b4 had, in coming, risked the displeasure of the\nCourt, he still thought it better to avoid any possible slander, and\ntherefore he made up his mind to set out for his home early next\nmorning. The _sak\u00c3\u00a9_ cup was offered, and they partook of it as they\nhummed,\n\n    \"In our parting cup, the tears of sadness fall.\"\n\nSeveral presents had been brought from the capital for Genji by\nT\u00c3\u00b4-no-Chi\u00c3\u00bbji\u00c3\u00b4, and, in return, the former made him a present of an\nexcellent dark-colored horse, and also a celebrated flute, as a token\nof remembrance.\n\nAs the sun shed forth his brilliant rays T\u00c3\u00b4-no-Chi\u00c3\u00bbji\u00c3\u00b4 took his leave,\nand as he did so he said, \"When shall I see you again, you cannot be\nhere long?\" Genji replied,\n\n    \"Yon noble crane that soars on high,[114]\n      And hovers in the clear blue sky,\n    Believe my soul as pure and light;\n      As spotless as the spring day bright.\n\nHowever, a man like me, whose fortune once becomes adverse seldom\nregains, even in the case of great wisdom, the prosperity he once\nfully enjoyed, and so I cannot predict when I may find myself again in\nthe capital.\"\n\nSo T\u00c3\u00b4-no-Chi\u00c3\u00bbji\u00c3\u00b4, having replied as follows:--\n\n    \"The crane mounts up on high, 'tis true,\n      But now he soars and cries alone,\n    Still fondly thinking of his friend,\n      With whom in former days he flew,\"\n\nset off on his homeward road, leaving Genji cast down for some time.\n\nNow the coast of Akashi is a very short distance from Suma, and there\nlived the former Governor of the province, now a priest, of whom we\nhave spoken before. Yoshikiyo well remembered his lovely daughter,\nand, after he came to Suma with Genji, he wrote to her now and then.\nHe did not get any answer from her, but sometimes heard from her\nfather, to whom Genji's exile became soon known, and who wished to see\nhim for a reason not altogether agreeable to himself. It should be\nremembered that this old man always entertained aspirations on behalf\nof his daughter, and in his eyes the successive governors of the\nprovince who came after him, and whose influence had been unbounded,\nwere considered as nobodies. To him, his young daughter was\neverything; and he used to send her twice a year to visit the temple\nof Sumiyoshi, in order that she might obtain good fortune by the\nblessing of the god.\n\nShe was not of an ideal beauty, but yet expressive in countenance and\nexalted in mind. She could, in this respect, rival any of those of\nhigh birth in the capital.\n\nThe priest said one day to his wife, \"Prince Genji, the imperial son\nof the K\u00c3\u00b4yi of Kiritsubo is now at Suma in exile, having offended the\nCourt. How fortunate it would be if we could take the opportunity of\npresenting our child to him!\"\n\nThe wife replied, \"Ah, how dreadful, when I heard what the townspeople\ntalk, I understood that he has several mistresses. He went even so far\nas to carry on a secret intimacy, which happened to be obnoxious to\nthe Emperor, and it is said that this offence was the cause of his\nexile.\"\n\n\"I have some reason for mentioning this to you,\" he interrupted,\nimpatiently; \"it is not a thing which you understand, so make up your\nmind, I shall bring the matter about, and take an opportunity of\nmaking him come to us.\"\n\n\"No matter how distinguished a personage he is,\" replied the wife, \"it\nis a fact that he has offended the Court and is exiled. I do not\nunderstand why you could take a fancy to such a man for our maiden\ndaughter. It is not a joking matter. I hope you will take it into\ngraver consideration.\"\n\n\"That a man of ability and distinction should meet with adverse\nfortune is a very common occurrence,\" said he, still more obstinately,\n\"both in our empire and in that of China. How then do you venture to\nsay such things against the Prince? His mother was the daughter of an\nAzechi Dainagon, who was my uncle. She enjoyed a good reputation, and\nwhen she was introduced at Court, became both prosperous and\ndistinguished. Although her life was shortened by the suffering caused\nby the fierce jealousy of her rivals, she left behind the royal child,\nwho is no other person than Prince Genji. A woman should always be\naspiring, as this lady was. What objection then is there in the idea\nof introducing our only child to a man like him? Although I am now\nonly a country gentleman, I do not think he would withdraw his favor\nfrom me.\"\n\nSuch were the opinions of this old man, and hence his discouragement\nof the advances of Yoshikiyo.\n\nThe first of March came, and Genji was persuaded by some to perform\nHorai (prayer for purification) for the coming occasion of the\nThird.[115] He therefore sent for a calendar-priest, with whom he went\nout, accompanied by attendants, to the sea-shore. Here a tent was\nerected ceremoniously, and the priest began his prayers, which were\naccompanied by the launching of a small boat, containing figures\nrepresenting human images. On seeing this Genji said,\n\n    \"Never thought I, in my younger day,\n      To be thrown on the wild sea-shore,\n    And like these figures to float away,\n      And perhaps see my home no more.\"\n\nAs he contemplated the scene around him, he perceived that the wild\nsurface of the sea was still and calm, like a mirror without its\nframe. He offered prayers in profound silence, and then exclaimed,\n\n    \"Oh, all ye eight millions of gods,[116] hear my cry,\n      Oh, give me your sympathy, aid me, I pray,\n    For when I look over my life, ne'er did I\n      Commit any wrong, or my fellows betray.\"\n\nSuddenly, as he spoke these words, the wind arose and began to blow\nfiercely. The sky became dark, and torrents of rain soon followed.\nThis caused great confusion to all present, and each ran back to the\nhouse without finishing the ceremony of prayers. None of them were\nprepared for the storm, and all got drenched with the rain. From this\nthe rain continued to pour down, and the surface of the sea became as\nit were tapestried with white, over which the lightning darted and the\nthunder rolled. It seemed as if thunderbolts were crashing overhead,\nand the force of the rain appeared to penetrate the earth. Everyone\nwas frightened, for they thought the end of the world was near.\n\nGenji occupied his time in quietly reading his Buddhist Bible. In the\nevening, the thunder became less loud, though the wind still blew not\nless violently than in the daytime. Everyone in the residence said\nthat they had heard of what is termed a flood-tide, which often caused\na great deal of damage, but they had never witnessed such a scene as\nthey had that day. Genji dropped off into a slumber, when indistinctly\nthe resemblance of a human figure came to him and said, \"You are\nrequested to come to the palace, why don't you come?\"\n\nGenji was startled by the words, and awoke. He thought that the king\nof the dragon palace[117] might have admired him, and was perhaps the\nauthor of this strange dream. These thoughts made him weary of\nremaining at Suma.\n\nFOOTNOTES:\n\n[Footnote 106: When a person was exiled, he was generally deprived of\nhis own title, or was degraded. Genji appears to have been deprived of\nhis.]\n\n[Footnote 107: A favorite phrase in Chinese poems describing the\njourney of exile.]\n\n[Footnote 108: Suma is about sixty miles from Ki\u00c3\u00b4to, the then\ncapital.]\n\n[Footnote 109: A musical instrument--often called a _koto._]\n\n[Footnote 110: When Sugawara, before referred to, arrived at Akashi,\non his way to exile, the village postmaster expressed his surprise.\nThereupon Sugawara gave him a stanza, which he composed:\n\n    \"Oh, master, be not surprised to see\n      This change in my estate, for so\n    Once to bloom, and once to fade\n      Is spring and autumn's usual lot.\"\n]\n\n[Footnote 111: In Chinese history it is recounted that a certain\nartful intriguer made a fool of his Sovereign by bringing a deer to\nthe Court and presenting it before the Emperor, declaring it to be a\nhorse.

The\nlatter took the fishing-rod, and went to the sea, but unfortunately\nlost his brother's hook in the water. At this he was very miserable,\nand wandered abstractedly along the coast. The dragon god of the\ndragon palace, under the blue main, admired his beauty, and wishing\nhim to marry his daughter, lured him into the dragon palace.]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII\n\nEXILE AT AKASHI\n\n\nThe storm and thunder still continued for some days, and the same\nstrange dream visited Genji over and over again.\n\nThis made him miserable. To return to the capital was not yet to be\nthought of, as to do so before the imperial permission was given,\nwould only be to increase his disgrace. On the other hand, to render\nhimself obscure by seeking further retreat was also not to be thought\nof, as it might cause another rumor that he had been driven away by\nmere fear of the disturbed state of the ocean.\n\nIn the meantime, a messenger arrived from the capital with a letter\nfrom Violet. It was a letter of inquiry about himself. It was written\nin most affectionate terms, and stated that the weather there was\nextremely disagreeable, as rain was pouring down continuously, and\nthat this made her especially gloomy in thinking of him. This letter\ngave Genji great pleasure.\n\nThe messenger was of the lowest class. At other times Genji would\nnever have permitted such sort of people to approach him, but under\nthe present circumstances of his life he was only too glad to put up\nwith it. He summoned the man to his presence, and made him talk of all\nthe latest news in the capital.\n\nThe messenger told him, in awkward terms, that in the capital these\nstorms were considered to be a kind of heavenly warning, that a\nNin-w\u00c3\u00b4-ye[118] was going to be held; and that many nobles who had to\ngo to Court were prevented from doing so by the storms, adding that he\nnever remembered such violent storms before.\n\nFrom the dawn of the next day the winds blew louder, the tide flowed\nhigher, and the sound of the waves resounded with a deafening noise.\nThe thunder rolled and the lightning flashed, while everyone was\ntrembling in alarm, and were all, including Genji, offering up prayers\nand vows to the God of Sumiyoshi, whose temple was at no great\ndistance, and also to other gods. Meanwhile a thunderbolt struck the\ncorridor of Genji's residence and set fire to it. The Prince and his\nfriends retired to a small house behind, which served as a kitchen.\nThe sky was as if blackened with ink, and in that state of darkness\nthe day ended. In the evening the wind gradually abated, the rain\ndiminished to a thin shower, and even the stars began to blink out of\nthe heavens.\n\nThis temporary retreat was now irksome, and they thought of returning\nto their dwelling quarters, but they saw nothing but ruins and\nconfusion from the storm, so they remained where they were. Genji was\noccupied in prayer. The moon began to smile from above, the flow of\nthe tide could be seen, and the rippling of the waves heard. He opened\nthe rude wooden door, and contemplated the scene before him. He seemed\nto be alone in the world, having no one to participate in his\nfeelings. He heard several fishermen talking in their peculiar\ndialect. Feeling much wearied by the events of the day, he soon\nretired, and resigned himself to slumber, reclining near one side of\nthe room, in which there were none of the comforts of an ordinary\nbedchamber.\n\nAll at once his late father appeared before his eyes in the exact\nimage of life, and said to him, \"Why are you in so strange a place?\"\nand taking his hand, continued, \"Embark at once in a boat, as the God\nof Sumiyoshi[119] guides you, and leave this coast.\"\n\nGenji was delighted at this, and replied, \"Since I parted from you I\nhave undergone many misfortunes, and I thought that I might be buried\non this coast.\"\n\n\"It must not be thus,\" the phantom replied; \"your being here is only a\npunishment for a trifling sin which you have committed. For my own\npart, when I was on the throne, I did no wrong, but I have somehow\nbeen involved in some trifling sin, and before I expiated it I left\nthe world. Hurt, however, at beholding you oppressed with such\nhardships I came up here, plunging into the waves, and rising on the\nshore. I am much fatigued; but I have something I wish to tell the\nEmperor, so I must haste away,\" and he left Genji, who felt very much\naffected, and cried out, \"Let me accompany you!\" With this exclamation\nhe awoke, and looked up, when he saw nothing but the moon's face\nshining through the windows, with the clouds reposing in the sky.\n\nThe image of his father still vividly remained before his eyes, and he\ncould not realize that it was only a dream. He became suddenly sad,\nand was filled with regret that he did not talk a little more, even\nthough it was only in a dream. He could not sleep any more this night,\nand dawn broke, when a small boat was seen approaching the coast, with\na few persons in it.\n\nA man from the boat came up to the residence of Genji. When he was\nasked who he was, he replied that the priest of Akashi (the former\nGovernor) had come from Akashi in his boat, and that he wished to see\nYoshikiyo, and to tell him the reason of his coming. Yoshikiyo was\nsurprised, and said, \"I have known him for years, but there was a\nslight reason why we were not the best of friends, and some time has\nnow passed without correspondence. What makes him come?\"\n\nAs to Genji, however, the arrival of the boat made him think of its\ncoincidence with the subject of his dream, so he hurried Yoshikiyo to\ngo and see the new comers. Thereupon the latter went to the boat,\nthinking as he went, \"How could he come to this place amidst the\nstorms which have been raging?\"\n\nThe priest now told Yoshikiyo that in a dream which he had on the\nfirst day of the month, a strange being told him a strange thing, and,\nsaid he, \"I thought it too credulous to believe in a dream, but the\nobject appeared again, and told me that on the thirteenth of this\nmonth he will give me a supernatural sign, directing me also to\nprepare a boat, and as soon as the storm ceased, to sail out to this\ncoast. Therefore, to test its truth I launched a boat, but strange to\nsay, on this day the extraordinarily violent weather of rain, wind,\nand thunder occurred. I then thought that in China there had been\nseveral instances of people benefiting the country by believing in\ndreams, so though this may not exactly be the case with mine, yet I\nthought it my duty, at all events, to inform you of the fact. With\nthese thoughts I started in the boat, when a slight miraculous breeze,\nas it were, blew, and drove me to this coast. I can have no doubt that\nthis was divine direction. Perhaps there might have been some\ninspiration in this place, too; and I wish to trouble you to transmit\nthis to the Prince.\"\n\nYoshikiyo then returned and faithfully told Genji all about his\nconversation with the priest. When Genji came to reflect, he thought\nthat so many dreams having visited him must have some significance. It\nmight only increase his disgrace if he were to despise such divine\nwarnings merely from worldly considerations, and from fear of\nconsequences. It would be better to resign himself to one more\nadvanced in age, and more experienced than himself. An ancient sage\nsays, that \"resigning one's self makes one happier,\" besides, his\nfather had also enjoined him in the dream to leave the coast of Suma,\nand there remained no further doubt for taking this step. He,\ntherefore, gave this answer to the priest, that \"coming into an\nunknown locality, plunged in solitude, receiving scarcely any visits\nfrom friends in the capital, the only thing I have to regard as\nfriends of old times are the sun and the moon that pass over the\nboundless heavens. Under these circumstances, I shall be only too\ndelighted to visit your part of the coast, and to find there such a\nsuitable retreat.\"\n\nThis answer gave the priest great joy, and he pressed Genji to set out\nat once and come to him. The Prince did so with his usual four or five\nconfidential attendants. The same wind which had miraculously blown\nthe vessel of the priest to Suma now changed, and carried them with\nequal favor and speed back to Akashi. On their landing they entered a\ncarriage waiting for them, and went to the mansion of the priest.\n\nThe scenery around the coast was no less novel than that of Suma, the\nonly difference being that there were more people there. The building\nwas grand, and there was also a grand Buddha-hall adjoining for the\nservice of the priest. The plantations of trees, the shrubberies, the\nrock-work, and the mimic lakes in the garden were so beautifully\narranged as to exceed the power of an artist to depict, while the\nstyle of the dwelling was so tasteful that it was in no way inferior\nto any in the capital.\n\nThe wife and the daughter of the priest were not residing here, but\nwere at another mansion on the hill-side, where they had removed from\nfear of the recent high tides.\n\nGenji now took up his quarters with the priest in this seaside\nmansion. The first thing he did when he felt a little settled was to\nwrite to the capital, and tell his friends of his change of residence.\nThe priest was about sixty years old, and was very sincere in his\nreligious service. The only subject of anxiety which he felt was, as\nwe have already mentioned, the welfare of his daughter. When Genji\nbecame thoroughly settled he often joined the priest, and spent hours\nin conversing with him. The latter, from his age and experience, was\nfull of information and anecdotes, many of which were quite new to\nGenji, but the narration of them seemed always to turn upon his\ndaughter.\n\nApril had now come. The trees began to be clothed with a thick shade\nof leaves, which had a peculiar novelty of appearance, differing from\nthat of the flowers of spring, or the bright dyes of autumn. The Kuina\n(a particular bird of summer) commenced their fluttering. The\nfurniture and dresses were changed for those more suitable to the time\nof year. The comfort of the house was most agreeable. It was on one of\nthese evenings that the surface of the broad ocean spread before the\neye was unshadowed by the clouds, and the Isle of Awaji floated like\nfoam on its face, just as it appeared to do at Suma. Genji took out\nhis favorite _kin_, on which he had not practised for some time, and\nwas playing an air called \"K\u00c3\u00b4ri\u00c3\u00b4,\" when the priest joined him, having\nleft for awhile his devotions, and said that his music recalled to his\nmind the old days and the capital which he had quitted so long. He\nsent for a _biwa_ (mandolin)[120] and a _soh-koto_ from the hill-side\nmansion, and, after the fashion of a blind singer of ballads to the\n_biwa_, played two or three airs.\n\nHe then handed the _soh-koto_ to Genji, who also played a few tunes,\nsaying, as he did so, in a casual manner, \"This sounds best when\nplayed upon by some fair hand.\" The priest smiled, and rejoined: \"What\nbetter hand than yours need we wish to hear playing; for my part, my\npoor skill has been transmitted to me, through three generations, from\nthe royal hand of the Emperor Yenghi, though I now belong to the past;\nbut, occasionally, when my loneliness oppresses me, I indulge in my\nold amusement, and there is one who, listening to my strains, has\nlearnt to imitate them so well that they resemble those of the Emperor\nYenghi himself. I shall be very happy, if you desire, to find an\nopportunity for you to hear them.\"\n\nGenji at once laid aside the instrument, saying: \"Ah, how bold! I did\nnot know I was among proficients,\" and continued, \"From olden time the\n_soh-koto_ was peculiarly adopted by female musicians. The fifth\ndaughter of the Emperor Saga, from whom she had received the secret,\nwas a celebrated performer, but no one of equal skill succeeded her.\nOf course there are several players, but these merely strike or strum\non the instrument; but in this retreat there is a skilful hand. How\ndelightful it will be.\"\n\n\"If you desire to hear, there is no difficulty. I will introduce her\nto you. She also plays the _biwa_ very well. The _biwa_ has been\nconsidered from olden time very difficult to master, and I am proud of\nher doing so.\"\n\nIn this manner the priest led the conversation to his own daughter,\nwhile fruit and _sake_ were brought in for refreshment. He then went\non talking of his life since he first came to the coast of Akashi, and\nof his devotion to religion, for the sake of future happiness, and\nalso out of solicitude for his daughter. He continued: \"Although I\nfeel rather awkward in saying it, I am almost inclined to think your\ncoming to this remote vicinity has something providential in it, as an\nanswer, as it were, to our earnest prayers, and it may give you some\nconsolation and pleasure. The reason why I think so is this--it is\nnearly eighteen years since we began to pray for the blessing of the\nGod Sumiyoshi on our daughter, and we have sent her twice a year, in\nspring and autumn, to his temple. At the 'six-time' service,[121]\nalso, the prayers for my own repose on the lotus flower,[122] are only\nsecondary to those which I put up for the happiness of my daughter. My\nfather, as you may know, held a good office in the capital, but I am\nnow a plain countryman, and if I leave matters in their present state,\nthe status of my family will soon become lower and lower. Fortunately\nthis girl was promising from her childhood, and my desire was to\npresent her to some distinguished personage in the capital, not\nwithout disappointment to many suitors, and I have often told her that\nif my desire is not fulfilled she had better throw herself into the\nsea.\"\n\nSuch was the tedious discourse which the priest held on the subject of\nhis family affairs; yet it is not surprising that it awakened an\ninterest in the susceptible mind of Genji for the fair maiden thus\ndescribed as so promising. The priest at last, in spite of the shyness\nand reserve of the daughter, and the unwillingness of the mother,\nconducted Genji to the hill-side mansion, and introduced him to the\nmaiden. In the course of time they gradually became more than mere\nacquaintances to each other. For some time Genji often found himself\nat the hill-side mansion, and her society appeared to afford him\ngreater pleasure than anything else, but this did not quite meet with\nthe approval of his conscience, and the girl in the mansion at Nijio\nreturned to his thoughts. If this flirtation of his should become\nknown to her, he thought, it perhaps would be very annoying to her.\nTrue, she was not much given to be jealous, but he well remembered the\noccasional complaints she had now and then made to him while in the\ncapital. These feelings induced him to write more frequently and more\nminutely to her, and he soon began to frequent the hill-side mansion\nless often. His leisure hours were spent in sketching, as he used to\ndo in Suma, and writing short poetic effusions explanatory of the\nscenery. This was also going on in the mansion at Nijio, where Violet\npassed the long hours away in painting different pictures, and also in\nwriting, in the form of a diary, what she saw and did. What will be\nthe issue of all these things?\n\nNow, since the spring of the year there had been several heavenly\nwarnings in the capital, and things in general were somewhat\nunsettled. On the evening of the thirteenth of March, when the rain\nand wind had raged, the late Emperor appeared in a dream to his son\nthe Emperor, in front of the palace, looking reproachfully upon him.\nThe Emperor showed every token of submission and respect when the dead\nEmperor told him of many things, all of which concerned Genji's\ninterests. The Emperor became alarmed, and when he awoke he told his\nmother all about his dream. She, however, told him that on such\noccasions, when the storm rages, and the sky is obscured by the\ndisturbance of the elements, all things, especially on which our\nthoughts have been long occupied, appear to us in a dream in a\ndisturbed sleep; and she continued, \"I further counsel you not to be\ntoo hastily alarmed by such trifles.\" From this time he began to\nsuffer from sore eyes, which may have resulted from the angry glances\nof his father's spirit. About the same time the father of the\nEmpress-mother died. His death was by no means premature; but yet,\nwhen such events take place repeatedly, it causes the mind to imagine\nthere is something more than natural going on, and this made the\nEmpress-mother feel a little indisposed.\n\nThe Emperor then constantly told her that if Genji were left in his\npresent condition it might induce evil, and, therefore, it would be\nbetter to recall him, and restore his titles and honors to him. She\nobstinately opposed these ideas, saying, \"If a person who proved to be\nguilty, and has retired from the capital, were to be recalled before\nthe expiration of at least three years, it would naturally show the\nweakness of authority.\"\n\nShe gained her point, and thus the days were spent and the year\nchanged.\n\nThe Emperor still continually suffered from indisposition, and the\nunsettled state of things remained the same as before. A prince had\nbeen born to him, who was now about two years old, and he began to\nthink of abdicating the throne in favor of the Heir-apparent, the\nchild of the Princess Wistaria. When he looked around to see who would\nbest minister public affairs, he came to think that the disgrace of\nGenji was a matter not to be allowed to continue, and at last,\ncontrary to the advice of his mother, he issued a public permission\nfor Genji's return to the capital, which was repeated at the end of\nJuly. Genji therefore prepared to come back. Before, however, he\nstarted, a month passed away, which time was mostly spent in the\nsociety of the lady of the hill-side mansion. The expected journey of\nGenji was now auspicious, even to him, and ought also to have been so\nto the family of the priest, but parting has always something painful\nin its nature. This was more so because the girl had by this time the\nwitness of their love in her bosom, but he told her that he would send\nfor her when his position was assured in the capital.\n\nTowards the middle of August everything was in readiness, and Genji\nstarted on his journey homeward. He went to Naniwa, where he had the\nceremony of Horai performed. To the temple of Sumiyoshi he sent a\nmessenger to say that the haste of his journey prevented him coming at\nthis time, but that he would fulfil his vows as soon as circumstances\nwould permit. From Naniwa he proceeded to the capital, and returned\nonce more, after an absence of nearly three years, to his mansion at\nNiji\u00c3\u00b4. The joy and excitement of the inmates of the mansion were\nunbounded, and the development of Violet charmed his eyes. His delight\nwas great and the pleasure of his mind was of the most agreeable\nnature; still, from time to time, in the midst of this very pleasure,\nthe recollection of the maiden whom he had left at Akashi occurred to\nhis thoughts. But this kind of perturbation was only the result of\nwhat had arisen from the very nature of Genji's character.\n\nBefore the lapse of many days all his titles and honors were restored\nto him, and he was soon created an extra Vice-Dainagon.\n\nAll those who had lost dignities or office on account of Genji's\ncomplications were also restored to them. It seemed to these like a\nsudden and unexpected return of spring to the leafless tree.\n\nIn the course of a few days Genji was invited by the Emperor to come\nand see him. The latter had scarcely recovered from his indisposition,\nand was still looking weak and thin. When Genji appeared before him,\nhe manifested great pleasure, and they conversed together in a\nfriendly way till the evening.\n\nFOOTNOTES:\n\n[Footnote 118: A religious feast in the Imperial Palace, in which\nNin-w\u00c3\u00b4-ki\u00c3\u00b4, one of the Buddhist Bibles, was read, an event which\nrarely took place.

He was always thinking of having solemn service\nperformed for him, which might prove to be a remedy for evils.\n\nHe was now in the capital, and at liberty to do anything he wished. In\nOctober, therefore, he ordered the grand ceremony of Mihakk\u00c3\u00b4 to be\nperformed for the repose of the dead. Meanwhile the respect of the\npublic towards Genji had now returned to its former state, and he\nhimself had become a distinguished personage in the capital. The\nEmpress-mother, though indisposed, regretted she had not ruined Genji\naltogether; while the Emperor, who had not forgotten the injunction of\nthe late ex-Emperor, felt satisfied with his recent disposition\ntowards his half-brother, which he believed to be an act of goodness.\n\nThis he felt the more, because he noticed the improvement in his\nhealth continued from day to day, and he experienced a sensation of\nfresh vigor. He did not, however, believe he should be long on the\nthrone, and when he found himself lonely, he often sent for Genji, and\nspent hours conversing with him, without any reserve, on public\naffairs.\n\nIn February of the next year the ceremony of the \"Gembuk\" of the\nHeir-apparent, who was eleven years of age, was performed.\n\nAt the end of the same month the Emperor abdicated the throne in favor\nof the Heir-apparent, and his own son was made the Heir-apparent to\nthe new Emperor.\n\nThe suddenness of these changes struck the Empress-mother with\nsurprise, but she was told by her son that his abdication had been\noccasioned by his desire to enjoy quiet and repose.\n\nThe new reign opened with several changes in public affairs. Genji had\nbeen made Naidaijin. He filled this extra office of Daijin because\nthere was no vacancy either in the Sadaijin or the Udaijin. He was to\ntake an active part in the administration, but as he was not yet\ndisposed to engage in the busy cares of official life, the\nex-Sadaijin, his father-in-law, was solicited to become the regent for\nthe young Emperor. He at first declined to accept the office, on the\nground that he was advanced in age, that he had already retired from\nofficial life, and that the decline of his life left him insufficient\nenergy. There was, however, an example in a foreign State, where some\nwise councillors, who resigned and had retired into the far-off\nmountains when their country was in a disturbed state, came forth from\ntheir retreat, with their snow-crowned heads, and took part in the\nadministration of affairs. Nor was it an unusual thing for a statesman\nwho had retired from political scenes to assume again a place under\nanother government.\n\nSo the ex-Sadaijin did not persist in his refusal, but finally\naccepted the post of Daji\u00c3\u00b4daijin (the Premier). He was now sixty-three\nyears of age. His former retirement had taken place more on account of\nhis disgust with the world than from his indisposition, and hence,\nwhen he accepted his new post, he at once showed how capable he was of\nbeing a responsible Minister. T\u00c3\u00b4-no-Chi\u00c3\u00bbji\u00c3\u00b4, his eldest son, was also\nmade the Gon-Chi\u00c3\u00bbnagon. His daughter by his wife, the fourth daughter\nof Udaijin, was now twelve years old, and was shortly expected to be\npresented at Court; while his son, who had sung the \"high sand\" at a\nsummer-day reunion at Genji's mansion, received a title. The young\nGenji too, the son of the late Lady Aoi, was admitted to the Court of\nthe Emperor and of the Heir-apparent.\n\nThe attendants who faithfully served the young Genji, and those in the\nmansion at Niji\u00c3\u00b4, had all received a satisfactory token of\nappreciation from Genji, who now began to have a mansion repaired,\nwhich was situated to the east of the one in which he resided, and\nwhich had formerly belonged to his father. This he did with a notion\nof placing there some of his intimate friends, such as the younger one\nof the ladies in the \"Villa of Falling Flowers.\"\n\nNow the young maiden also, whom Genji had left behind at Akashi, and\nwho had been in delicate health, did not pass away from his thoughts.\nHe despatched a messenger there on the first of March, as he deemed\nthe happy event would take place about that time. When the messenger\nreturned, he reported that she was safely delivered of a girl on the\nsixteenth of the month.\n\nHe remembered the prediction of an astrologer who had told him that an\nEmperor would be born to him, and another son who would eventually\nbecome a Daji\u00c3\u00b4daijin. He also remembered that a daughter, who would be\nafterwards an Empress, would be also born to him, by a lady inferior\nto the mothers of the other two children. When he reflected on this\nprediction and on the series of events, he began thinking of the\nremarkable coincidences they betrayed; and as he thought of sending\nfor her, as soon as the condition of the young mother's health would\nadmit, he hurried forward the repairs of the eastern mansion. He also\nthought that as there might not be a suitable nurse at Akashi for the\nchild, he ought to send one from the capital. Fortunately there was a\nlady there who had lately been delivered of a child. Her mother, who\nhad waited at Court when the late ex-Emperor lived, and her father,\nwho had been some time Court Chamberlain, were both dead. She was now\nin miserable circumstances. Genji sounded her, through a certain\nchannel, whether she would not be willing to be useful to him. This\noffer on his part she accepted without much hesitation, and was\ndespatched with a confidential servant to attend on the new-born\nchild. He also sent with her a sword and other presents. She left the\ncapital in a carriage, and proceeded by boat to the province of\nSettsu, and thence on horseback to Akashi.\n\nWhen she arrived the priest was intensely delighted, and the young\nmother, who had been gradually improving in health, felt great\nconsolation. The child was very healthy, and the nurse at once began\nto discharge her duties most faithfully.\n\nHitherto Genji did not confide the story of his relations with the\nmaiden of Akashi to Violet, but he thought he had better do so, as the\nmatter might naturally reach her ears. He now, therefore, informed her\nof all the circumstances, and of the birth of the child, saying, \"If\nyou feel any unpleasantness about the matter, I cannot blame you in\nany way. It was not the blessing which I desired. How greatly do I\nregret that in the quarter where I wished to see the heavenly gift,\nthere is none, but see it in another, where there was no expectation.\nThe child is merely a girl too, and I almost think that I need pay no\nfurther attention. But this would make me heartless towards my\nundoubted offspring. I shall send for it and show it to you, and hope\nyou will be generous to her. Can you assure me you will be so?\" At\nthese words Violet's face became red as crimson, but she did not lose\nher temper, and quietly replied:\n\n\"Your saying this only makes me contemptible to myself, as I think my\ngenerosity may not yet be fully understood; but I should like to know\nwhen and where I could have learnt to be ungenerous.\"\n\n\"These words sound too hard to me,\" said he. \"How can you be so cruel\nto me? Pray don't attribute any blame to me; I never thought of it.\nHow miserable am I!\" And he began to drop tears when he came to\nreflect how faithful she had been all the time, and how affectionate,\nand also how regular had been her correspondence. He felt sorry for\nher, and continued, \"In my anxious thoughts about this child, I have\nsome intentions which may be agreeable to you also, only I will not\ntell you too hastily, since, if I do so now, they might not be taken\nin a favorable light. The attractions of the mother seem only to have\narisen from the position in which she was placed. You must not think\nof the matter too seriously.\" He then briefly sketched her character\nand her skill in music. But on the part of Violet she could not but\nthink that it was cruel to her to give away part of his heart, while\nher thoughts were with no one but him, and she was quite cast down for\nsome time.\n\nGenji tried to console her. He took up a _kin_ and asked her to play\nand sing with him; but she did not touch it, saying that she could not\nplay it so well as the maiden of Akashi. This very manner of her mild\njealousy made her more captivating to him, and without further remarks\nthe subject was dropped.\n\nThe fifth of May was the fiftieth day of the birth of the child, so\nGenji sent a messenger to Akashi a few days before the time when he\nwould be expected. At Akashi the feast for the occasion was arranged\nwith great pains, and the arrival of Genji's messenger was most\nopportune.\n\nLet us now relate something about the Princess Wistaria.--Though she\nhad become a nun, her title of ex-Empress had never been lost; and\nnow the change in the reigning sovereign gave her fresh honors. She\nhad been recognized as equivalent to an Empress-regnant who had\nabdicated. A liberal allowance was granted to her, and a becoming\nhousehold was established for her private use. She, however, still\ncontinued her devotion to religion, now and then coming to Court to\nsee her son, where she was received with all cordiality; so that her\nrival, the mother of the ex-Emperor, whose influence was overwhelming\ntill lately, now began to feel like one to whom the world had become\nirksome.\n\nIn the meantime, public affairs entirely changed their aspects, and\nthe world seemed at this time to have been divided between the\nDaji\u00c3\u00b4daijin and his son-in-law, Genji, by whose influence all things\nin public were swayed.\n\nIn August, of this year, the daughter of Gon-Chi\u00c3\u00bbnagon (formerly\nT\u00c3\u00b4-no-Chi\u00c3\u00bbji\u00c3\u00b4) was introduced at Court. She took up her abode in the\nKokiden, which had been formerly occupied by her maternal aunt, and\nshe was also styled from this time the Niogo of Kokiden. Prince\nHi\u00c3\u00b4b-Ki\u00c3\u00b4 had also the intention of introducing his second daughter at\nCourt, but Genji took no interest in this. What will he eventually do\nabout this matter?\n\nIn the same autumn Genji went to the Temple of Sumiyoshi to fulfil his\nvows. His party consisted of many young nobles and Court retainers,\nbesides his own private attendants.\n\nBy a coincidence the maiden of Akashi, who had been prevented from\ncoming to the Temple since the last year, happened to arrive there on\nthe same day. Her party travelled in a boat, and when it reached the\nbeach they saw the procession of Genji's party crossing before them.\nThey did not know what procession it was, and asked the bystanders\nabout it, who, in return, asked them sarcastically, \"Can there be\nanyone who does not know of the coming of Naidaijin, the Prince Genji,\nhere to-day to fulfil his vows?\"\n\nMost of the young nobles were on horseback, with beautifully made\nsaddles; and others, including Ukon-no-Ji\u00c3\u00b4, Yoshikiyo, and Koremitz,\nin fine uniforms of different colors (blue, green, or scarlet),\naccording to their different ranks, formed the procession, contrasting\nwith the hue of the range of pine-trees on both sides of the road.\n\nGenji was in a carriage, which was followed by ten boy pages, granted\nby the Court in the same way as a late Sadaijin, Kawara, had been\nhonored. They were dressed in admirable taste, and their hair was\ntwisted up in the form of a double knot, with ribbons of gorgeous\npurple. The young Genji was also in the procession on horseback, and\nfollowed the carriage.\n\nThe maiden of Akashi witnessed the procession, but she avoided making\nherself known. She thought she had better not go up to the Temple on\nthat day; but she could not sail back to Akashi, so she had her boat\nmoored in the bay of Naniwa for the night. As to Genji, he knew\nnothing of the maiden being a spectator of the procession, and spent\nthe whole night in the Temple with his party in performing services\nwhich might please the God.\n\nIt was then that he was informed by Koremitz that he had seen the\nmaiden of Akashi in a boat. On the morrow Genji and his party set off\nfor their homes. As they proceeded Genji hummed,\n\n    \"Ima hata onaji Naniwa nal,\"[123]\n\nand he stopped, while contemplating the bay. Koremitz, who stood\nbeside him, and divined what he was thinking about, took out a small\npen from his pocket and presented it to Genji, who took it and wrote\nthe following on a piece of paper, which he sent to the maiden by one\nof his attendants who knew her whereabouts:--\n\n    \"Divinely led by love's bright flame,\n      To this lone temple's shrine we come;\n    And as yon beacon meets our eye,\n      To dream, perchance, of days gone by.\"\n\nA few words more. The change of the ruler had brought a change of the\nSaig\u00c3\u00bb; and the Lady of Rokji\u00c3\u00b4, with her daughter, returned to the\ncapital. Her health, however, began to fail, and she became a nun, and\nafter some time died. Before her death Genji visited her, and with her\nlast breath she consigned her daughter to his care. Genji was\nthinking, therefore, of introducing her at Court at some future time.\n\nFOOTNOTES:\n\n[Footnote 123: A line of an old ode about the beacon in the bay of\nNaniwa, at the same time expressing the desire of meeting with a loved\none. It is impossible to translate this ode literally, as in the\noriginal there is a play upon words, the word beacon (in Japanese)\nalso meaning \"enthusiastic endeavor.\" The word \"myo-tzkushi\" (=\nbeacon) more properly means \"water-marker\" though disused in the\nmodern Japanese. In the translation a little liberty has been taken.]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV\n\nOVERGROWN MUGWORT\n\n\nWhen Genji was an exile on the sea-coast, many people had been longing\nfor his return. Among these was the Princess Hitachi. She was, as we\nhave seen, the survivor of his Royal father, and the kindness which\nshe had received from Genji was to her like the reflection of the\nbroad starlit sky in a basin of water. After Genji left the capital,\nhowever, no correspondence ever passed between them. Several of her\nservants left her, and her residence became more lonely than ever. A\nfox might have found a covert in the overgrown shrubbery, and the cry\nof the owl might have been heard among the thick branches. One might\nimagine some mysterious \"tree-spirit\" to reign there. Nevertheless,\nsuch grounds as these, surrounded with lofty trees, are more tempting\nto those who desire to have a stylish dwelling. Hence there were\nseveral Duri\u00c3\u00b4s (local governors) who had become rich, and having\nreturned from different provinces, sounded the Princess to see if she\nwere inclined to part with her residence; but this she always refused\nto do, saying that, however unfortunate she might be, she was not able\nto give up a mansion inherited from her parents.\n\nThe mansion contained also a store of rare and antique articles.\nSeveral fashionable persons endeavored to induce the Princess to part\nwith them; but such people appeared only contemptible to her, as she\nlooked upon them as proposing such a thing solely because they knew\nshe was poor. Her attendants sometimes suggested to her that it was by\nno means an uncommon occurrence for one to dispose of such articles\nwhen destiny necessitated the sacrifice; but her reply was that these\nthings had been handed down to her only that she might make use of\nthem, and that she would be violating the wishes of the dead if she\nconsented to part with them, allowing them to become the ornament of\nthe dwellings of some lowborn upstarts.\n\nScarcely anyone paid a visit to her dwelling, her only occasional\nvisitor being her brother, a priest, who came to see her when he came\nto the capital, but he was a man of eccentric character, and was not\nvery flourishing in his circumstances.\n\nSuch being the state of affairs with the Princess Hitachi, the grounds\nof her mansion became more and more desolate and wild, the mugwort\ngrowing so tall that it reached the veranda. The surrounding walls of\nmassive earth broke down here and there and crumbled away, being\ntrampled over by wandering cattle. In spring and summer boys would\nsometimes play there. In the autumn a gale blew down a corridor, and\ncarried away part of the shingle roof. Only one blessing remained\nthere--no thief intruded into the enclosure, as no temptation was\noffered to them for their attack.\n\nBut never did the Princess lose her accustomed reserve, which her\nparents had instilled into her mind. Society for her had no\nattractions. She solaced the hours of her loneliness by looking over\nancient story-books and poems, which were stored in the old\nbookshelves, such as the Karamori, Hakoya-no-toji, or Kakya-hime.\nThese, with their illustrations, were her chief resources.\n\nNow a sister of the Princess's mother had married a Duri\u00c3\u00b4, and had\nalready borne him a daughter. This marriage had been considered an\nunequal match by the father of the Princess, and for this reason she\nwas not very friendly with the family. Jiji\u00c3\u00bb, however, who was a\ndaughter of the Princess's nurse, and who still remained with the\nPrincess, used to go to her. This aunt was influenced by a secret\nfeeling of spite, and when Jiji\u00c3\u00bb visited her she often whispered to\nher many things which did not become her as a lady. It seems to me\nthat where a lady of ordinary degree is elevated to a higher position,\nshe often acquires a refinement like one originally belonging to it;\nbut there are other women, who when degraded from their rank spoil\ntheir taste and habits just like the lady in question. She fondly\nhoped to revenge herself for having been formerly looked down upon, by\nshowing an apparent kindness to the Princess Hitachi, and by wishing\nto take her into her home, and make her wait upon her daughters. With\nthis view she told Jijiu to tell her mistress to come to her, and\nJijiu did so; but the Princess did not comply with this request.\n\nIn the meantime the lady's husband was appointed Daini (Senior\nSecretary to the Lord-Lieutenant), and they were to go down to Tzkushi\n(modern Kiusiu). She wished to take the Princess with her, and told\nher that she felt sorry to go to such a far-off locality, leaving her\nin her present circumstances; but the latter still unhesitatingly\nreplied in the negative, and declined the offer; whereupon her aunt\ntauntingly remarked that she was too proud, and that, however exalted\nshe might think herself, no one, not even Genji, would show her any\nfurther attention.\n\nAbout this time Genji returned, but for some while she heard nothing\nfrom him, and only the public rejoicing of many people, and the news\nabout him from the outside world reached her ears. This gave her aunt\na further opportunity of repeating the same taunts. She said, \"See now\nwho cares for you in your present circumstances. It is not\npraiseworthy to display such self-importance as you did in the\nlifetime of your father.\" And again she pressed her to go with her,\nbut the Princess still clung to the hope that the time would come when\nGenji would remember her and renew his kindness.\n\nWinter came! One day, quite unexpectedly, the aunt arrived at the\nmansion, bringing as a present a dress for the Princess. Her carriage\ndashed into the garden in a most pompous style, and drove right up to\nthe southern front of the building. Jijiu went to meet her, and\nconducted her into the Princess's apartment.\n\n\"I must soon be leaving the capital,\" said the visitor. \"It is not my\nwish to leave you behind, but you would not listen to me, and now\nthere is no help. But this one, this Jijiu at least, I wish to take\nwith me. I have come to-day to fetch her. I cannot understand how you\ncan be content with your present condition.\"\n\nHere she manifested a certain sadness, but her delight at her\nhusband's promotion was unmistakable, and she continued:--\n\n\"When your father was alive, I was looked down upon by him, which\ncaused a coolness between us. But nevertheless I at no time\nentertained any ill-will towards you, only you were much favored by\nPrince Genji, as I heard, which made me abstain from visiting you\noften; but fortune is fickle, for those in a humble position often\nenjoy comfort, and those that are higher in station are not quite so\nwell circumstanced. I do really feel sorry to leave you behind.\"\n\nThe Princess said very little, but her answer was, \"I really thank you\nfor your kind attention, but I do not think I am now fit to move about\nin the world. I shall be quite happy to bury myself under this roof.\"\n\n\"Well, you may think so, but it is simply foolish to abandon one's\nself, and to bury one's life under such a mass of dilapidation. Had\nPrince Genji been kind enough to repair the place, it might have\nbecome transformed into a golden palace, and how joyous would it not\nbe? but this you cannot expect. As far as I am informed the daughter\nof Prince Hiob-Kio is the only favorite of the Prince, and no one else\nshares his attention, all his old favorites being now abandoned. How,\nthen, can you expect him to say that, because you have been faithful\nto him, he will therefore come to you again?\"\n\nThese words touched the Princess, but she gave no vent to her\nfeelings. The visitor, therefore, hurried Jijiu to get ready, saying\nthat they must leave before the dusk.\n\n\"When I hear what the lady says,\" said Jijiu, \"it sounds to me very\nreasonable; but when I see how anxious the Princess is, that also\nseems natural. Thus I am puzzled between the two. Let me, however, say\nthis, I will only see the lady off to-day.\"\n\nNevertheless, the Princess foresaw that Jijiu was going to leave her,\nand she thought of giving her some souvenir. Her own dress was not to\nbe thought of, as it was too old; fortunately she had a long tress of\nfalse hair, about nine feet long, made of the hair which had fallen\nfrom her own head. This she put into an old casket, and gave it to\nJijiu, with a jar of rare perfume.\n\nJijiu had been an attendant on the Princess for a very long time,\nbesides, her mother (the nurse), before she died, told the Princess\nand her daughter that she hoped they might be long together; so the\nparting with Jijiu was very trying to the Princess who said to her\nthat though she could not blame her for leaving, she still felt sorry\nto lose her. To this Jijiu replied, that she never forgot the wishes\nof her mother, and was only too happy to share joy and sorrow with the\nPrincess; yet she was sorry to say that circumstances obliged her to\nleave her for some time; but before she could say much, she was\nhurried away by the visitor.\n\nIt was one evening in April of the following year that Genji happened\nto be going to the villa of \"the falling flowers,\" and passed by the\nmansion of the Princess. There was in the garden a large pine-tree,\nfrom whose branches the beautiful clusters of a wistaria hung in rich\nprofusion. A sigh of the evening breeze shook them as they hung in the\nsilver moonlight, and scattered their rich fragrance towards the\nwayfarer. There was also a weeping willow close by, whose pensile\ntresses of new verdure touched the half-broken walls of earth\nunderneath.\n\nWhen Genji beheld this beautiful scene from his carriage, he at once\nremembered it was a place he had seen before. He stopped his carriage,\nand said to Koremitz, who was with him as usual--\n\n\"Is this not the mansion of the Princess Hitachi?\"\n\n\"Yes, it is,\" replied Koremitz.\n\n\"Do ask if she is still here,\" said Genji; \"this is a good chance; I\nwill see her if she is at home--ask!\"\n\nKoremitz entered, and proceeding to the door, called out. An old woman\nfrom the inside demanded to know who he was. Koremitz announced\nhimself, and asked if Jiji\u00c3\u00bb was within. The old women replied that she\nwas not, but that she herself was the same as Jiji\u00c3\u00bb.\n\nKoremitz recognized her as an aunt of the latter. He then asked her\nabout the Princess, and told her of Genji's intention. To his\ninquiries he soon obtained a satisfactory answer, and duly reported it\nto Genji, who now felt a pang of remorse for his long negligence of\none so badly circumstanced. He descended from his carriage, but the\npathway was all but overgrown with tall mugwort, which was wet with a\npassing shower; so Koremitz whisked them with his whip, and led him\nin.\n\nInside, meanwhile, the Princess, though she felt very pleased,\nexperienced a feeling of shyness. Her aunt, it will be remembered, had\npresented her with a suitable dress, which she had hitherto had no\npleasure in wearing, and had kept it in a box which had originally\ncontained perfume. She now took this out and put it on. Genji was\npresently shown into the room.\n\n\"It is a long time since I saw you last,\" said Genji, \"but still I\nhave never forgotten you, only I heard nothing from you; so I waited\ntill now, and here I find myself once more.\"\n\nThe Princess, as usual, said very little, only thanking him for his\nvisit. He then addressed her in many kind and affectionate words, many\nof which he might not really have meant, and after a considerable stay\nhe at last took his departure.\n\nThis was about the time of the feast in the Temple of Kamo, and Genji\nreceived several presents under various pretexts. He distributed these\npresents among his friends, such as those in the villa of \"the falling\nflowers,\" and to the Princess. He also sent his servant to the mansion\nof the latter to cut down the rampant mugwort, and he restored the\ngrounds to proper order. Moreover, he had a wooden enclosure placed\nall round the garden.\n\nSo far as the world hitherto knew about Genji, he was supposed only to\ncast his eyes on extraordinary and pre-eminent beauties; but we see in\nhim a very different character in the present instance. He showed so\nmuch kindness to the Princess Hitachi, who was by no means\ndistinguished for her beauty, and who still bore a mark on her nose\nwhich might remind one of a well-ripened fruit carried by\nmountaineers. How was this? it might have been preordained to be so.\n\nThe Princess continued to live in the mansion for two years, and then\nshe removed to a part of a newly built \"eastern mansion\" belonging to\nGenji, where she lived happily under the kind care of the Prince,\nthough he had much difficulty in coming often to see her. I would fain\ndescribe the astonishment of her aunt when she returned from the\nWestern Island and saw the Princess's happy condition, and how Jijiu\nregretted having left her too hastily; but my head is aching and my\nfingers are tired, so I shall wait for some future opportunity when I\nmay again take up the thread of my story.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI\n\nBARRIER HOUSE\n\n\nWe left beautiful Cicada at the time when she quitted the capital with\nher husband. Now this husband Iyo-no-Kami, had been promoted to the\ngovernorship of Hitachi, in the year which followed that of the demise\nof the late ex-Emperor, and Cicada accompanied him to the province. It\nwas a year after Genji's return that they came back to the capital. On\nthe day when they had to pass the barrier house of Ausaka\n(meeting-path) on their homeward way, Hitachi's sons, the eldest known\nto us as Ki-no-Kami, now became Kawachi-no-Kami, and others went from\nthe city to meet them. It so happened that Genji was to pay his visit\nto the Temple of Ishiyama on this very day. This became known to\nHitachi, who, thinking it would be embarrassing if they met with his\nprocession on the road, determined to start very early; but, somehow\nor another, time passed on, and when they came to the lake coast of\nUchiide (modern Otz, a place along Lake Biwa), the sun had risen high,\nand this was the moment when Genji was crossing the Awata Road. In the\ncourse of a few hours the outriders of Genji's cort\u00c3\u00a8ge came in sight;\nso that Hitachi's party left their several carriages, and seated\nthemselves under the shade of the cedars on the hill-side of Ausaka,\nin order to avoid encountering Genji and his procession. It was the\nlast day of September. All the herbage was fading under the influence\nof the coming winter, and many tinted autumn leaves displayed their\ndifferent hues over the hills and fields. The scene was in every way\npleasing to the eyes of the spectators. The number of the carriages of\nHitachi's party was about ten in all, and the style and appearance of\nthe party showed no traces of rusticity of taste. It might have been\nimagined that the party of the Saig\u00c3\u00bb journeying towards or from Ise,\nmight be something similar to this one.\n\nGenji soon caught sight of them, and became aware that it was Hitachi.\nHe therefore sent for Cicada's brother--whom we know as Kokimi, and\nwho had now been made Uyemon-no-Ske--from the party, and told him that\nhe hoped his attention in coming there to meet them would not be\nconsidered unfavorable. This Kokimi, as we know, had received much\nkindness from Genji up to the time of his becoming a man; but when\nGenji had to quit the capital he left him and joined his\nbrother-in-law in his official province. This was not viewed as very\nsatisfactory; but Genji manifested no bad feeling to him, and treated\nhim still as one of his household attendants. Ukon-no-Ji\u00c3\u00b4, a\nbrother-in-law of Cicada, on the other hand, had faithfully followed\nGenji to his exile, and after their return he was more than ever\nfavored by Genji. This state of things made many feel for the bad\ntaste of the ordinary weakness of the world, exhibited by the\nfaithfully following of one when circumstances are flourishing, and\ndeserting him in the time of adversity. Kokimi himself was one of\nthose who fully realized these feelings, and was pained by them. When\nGenji finished his visit to the Temple, and was coming back, Kokimi\nonce more came from the capital to meet him. Through him Genji sent a\nletter to his sister, asking her if she had recognized him when he\npassed at Ausaka, adding the following verse:--\n\n    \"As onward we our way did take,\n      On Meeting-Path, both I and you,\n    We met not, for by the saltless lake,\n      No _milme_[124] by its waters grew.\"\n\nIn handing the letter to Kokimi, Genji said, \"Give this to your\nsister; it is a long time since I heard anything from her, still the\npast seems to me only like yesterday. But do you disapprove of my\nsending this?\" Kokimi replied in a few words, and took the letter back\nto his sister, and told her, when he gave it, that she might easily\ngive him some sort of answer. She did indeed disapprove of treating\nthe matter in any way more seriously than she had formerly done, yet\nshe wrote the following:--\n\n    \"By Barrier-House--oh, name unkind,\n      That bars the path of friendly greeting;\n    We passed along with yearning mind,\n      But passed, alas! without a meeting.\"\n\nAfter this time some other correspondence now and then passed between\nthem. As time rolled on the health of her aged husband visibly\ndeclined; and after fervently enjoining his sons to be kind and\nattentive to her, in due time he breathed his last.\n\nFor some time they were kind and attentive to her, as their father had\nrequested, and there was nothing unsatisfactory in their behavior\ntowards her, yet many things which were not altogether pleasant\ngradually presented themselves to her, and so it is always in life.\nFinally Cicada, telling her intentions to no one beforehand, became a\nnun.\n\nFOOTNOTES:\n\n[Footnote 124: The name of a seaweed, but also meaning the eyes that\nmeet, and hence the twofold sense of the word.]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII\n\nCOMPETITIVE SHOW OF PICTURES\n\n\nThe introduction of the late Saig\u00c3\u00bb, the daughter of the Lady of\nRokji\u00c3\u00b4, at Court, was now arranged to take place, with the approval of\nthe Empress-mother (the Princess Wistaria). All the arrangements and\npreparations were made, though not quite openly, under the eye of\nGenji, who took a parental interest in her. It may be remembered that\nthe ex-Emperor was once struck by her charms, on the eve of her\ndeparture for Ise; and though he never encouraged this fancy to become\nanything more than an ordinary partiality, he took no small interest\nin all that concerned her welfare.\n\nWhen the day of introduction arrived, he made her several beautiful\npresents, such as a comb-box, a dressing-table, and a casket\ncontaining rare perfumes. At her residence all her female attendants,\nand some others, assembled, who made every preparation with the utmost\npains.\n\nIn the Palace, the Empress-mother was with her Royal son on this day.\nHe was still a mere boy, and scarcely understood what was going on;\nbut he was now fully informed on the subject by his mother, and was\ntold that a very interesting lady was going to reside in the Palace to\nattend on him, and that he must be good and kind to her. The\npresentation took place late in the evening, and henceforth she was\ncalled the Niogo of the Ume-Tsubo (plum-chamber), from the name of her\napartment.\n\nShe was a charming lady, and the Emperor was not without a certain\nliking for her; yet Lady Kokiden, the daughter of Gon-Chi\u00c3\u00bbnagon\n(T\u00c3\u00b4-no-Chi\u00c3\u00bbji\u00c3\u00b4), who had been introduced some time previously, and\nconsequently was an acquaintance of an older date, was much more\nfrequently preferred by him to the other for society in daily\namusement. When Gon-Chi\u00c3\u00bbnagon introduced his daughter, he did not of\ncourse do so without hope of her further elevation; but now Lady Plum\ncame to assume a position through Genji's influence, as if to compete\nwith his daughter for the royal favor; and it was by no means glad\ntidings for him. It may be here mentioned that Prince Hiob-Kio had\nalso, as we have already seen, an intention of introducing one of his\ndaughters at Court; but this hope was doomed to disappointment by the\nestablishing of the two ladies already introduced, and he was induced\nto defer his intention, at least for the present.\n\nThe Emperor was very fond of pictures, and painted with considerable\nability. Lady Plum, too, as it happened, possessed the same taste as\nthe Emperor, and used often to amuse herself by painting. If,\ntherefore, he liked ordinary courtiers who exhibited a taste for\npainting, it was no matter of surprise that he liked to see the\ndelicate hands of the lady occupied in carefully laying on colors.\nThis similarity of taste gradually drew his attention to her, and led\nto frequent visits to the \"plum-chamber.\" When Gon-Chi\u00c3\u00bbnagon was\ninformed of these circumstances, he took the matter into his own\nhands. He himself determined to excite a spirit of rivalry. He\ncontrived means to counteract the influence of painting, and\ncommissioned several famous artists of the times to execute some\nelaborate pictures. Most of these were subjects taken from old\nromances, as he conceived that these were always more attractive than\nmere fanciful pictures. He had also caused to be painted a\nrepresentation of every month of the year, which would also be likely,\nhe thought, to interest the Emperor. When these pictures were finished\nhe took them to Court, and submitted them to his inspection; but he\nwould not agree that he should take any of them to the plum-chamber;\nand they were all deposited in the chamber of his daughter.\n\nGenji, when he heard of this, said of his brother-in-law, \"He is\nyoung; he never could be behind others.\" He was, however, unable to\npass the matter over unnoticed. He told the Emperor that he would\npresent him with some old pictures, and returning to his mansion at\nNijio he opened his picture cabinet, where numbers of old and new\npictures were kept. From these, with the assistance of Violet, he made\na selection of the best. But such pictures as illustrations of the\n\"Long Regrets,\" or representations of \"O-shio-kun,\" were reserved,\nbecause the terminations of these stories were not happy ones. He\nalso took out of his cabinet the sketches which he had made while in\nSuma and Akashi, and showed them for the first time to Violet, who was\na little angry at his not having shown them to her sooner.\n\nIt was about the tenth of February, and the face of Nature began to\nsmile with the approach of spring, making the hearts and tempers of\npeople more calm and cheerful; besides, it was just the time when the\nCourt was unoccupied with the keeping of any festival. There could be\nno better chance than this for such an exhibition of pictures to\nattract the attention of people enjoying leisure. Genji, therefore,\nsent his collection of pictures to the Palace in behalf of the lady of\nthe plum-chamber.\n\nThis soon created a sensation in the Palace. Most of the pictures that\nwere in the possession of the lady of the plum-chamber were from old\nromances, and the pictures themselves were of ancient date, being\nrare, while those of Kokiden were more modern subjects and by living\nartists. Thus each of them had their special merits, so that it became\ndifficult to say which were more excellent. Talking of these pictures\nbecame quite a fashionable subject of conversation of the courtiers of\nthe day. The Imperial-mother happened to be at Court, and when she saw\nthese pictures and heard different persons at Court discussing their\nrelative merits, she suggested that they should divide themselves into\ntwo parties, right and left, and regularly to give their judgment.\nThis was accordingly done: Hei-Naishi-no-Ske, Jiji\u00c3\u00bb-no-Naishi, and\nShi\u00c3\u00b4shi\u00c3\u00b4-no-Mi\u00c3\u00b4bu took the left, on the side of the lady of the\nplum-chamber; while Daini-no-Naishi-no-Ske, Chi\u00c3\u00bbji\u00c3\u00b4-no-Mi\u00c3\u00b4bu, and\nHi\u00c3\u00b4ye-no-Mi\u00c3\u00b4bu took the right, on the side of the Kokiden.\n\nThe first picture selected was the illustration of the \"Bamboo\nCutter,\"[125] by the left, as it was the most appropriate to come\nfirst for the discussion of its merits, as being the parent of\nromance. To compete with this, that of \"Toshikag\u00c3\u00a8,\"[126] from \"The\nEmpty Wood,\" was selected by the right. The left now stated their\ncase, saying, \"The bamboo--indeed, its story too--may be an old and\ncommonly known thing, but the maiden Kakya, in keeping her purity\nunsullied in this world, is highly admirable; besides, it was an\noccurrence that belongs to a pre-historical period. No ordinary woman\nwould ever be equal to her, and so this picture has an excellence.\"\nThereupon the right argued in opposition to this, saying, \"The sky,\nwhere the maiden Kakya has gone away, may indeed be high, but it is\nbeyond human reach, so we may put it aside. When she made her\nappearance in this world she was, after all, a creature of bamboo;\nand, indeed, we may consider her even lower than ourselves. It may\nalso be true that she threw a bright radiance over the inside of a\ncottage, but she never shone in the august society of a palace.\nAbe-no-oshi's[127] spending millions of money in order to get the\nso-called fire-proof rat, which, when obtained, was consumed in the\nflames in a moment, is simply ridiculous. Prince Kuramochi's[128]\npretended jewel branch was simply a delusion. Besides, this picture is\nby Kose-no-Omi, with notes[129] by Tsurayuki. These are not very\nuncommon. The paper is Kamiya, only covered with Chinese satin. The\nouter cover is reddish purple, and the centre stick is purple\nAzedarach. These are very common ornaments. Now Toshikag\u00c3\u00a8, though he\nhad undergone a severe trial from the raging storm, and had been\ncarried to a strange country, arrived at length at the country to\nwhich he was originally despatched, and from there returned to his\nnative land, having achieved his object, and having made his ability\nrecognized both at home and abroad. This picture is the life of this\nman, and it represents many scenes, not only of his country but of\nforeign ones, which cannot fail to be interesting. We therefore dare\nto place this one above the other in merit.\"\n\nThe ground of this picture was thick white tinted paper, the outer\ncover was green, and the centre stick jade. The picture was by\nTsunenori, and the writing by Michikage. It was in the highest taste\nof the period.\n\nThe left made no more protestation against the right.\n\nNext the romance of Ise by the left, and that of Shi\u00c3\u00b4-Sammi by the\nright, were brought into competition. Here again the relative merit\nwas very difficult to be decided at once. That of the right had\napparently more charms than that of the other, since it beautifully\nrepresented the society of a more recent period.\n\nHei-Naishi, of the left, therefore said,\n\n    \"If leaving the depths of Ise's night-sea,\n      We follow the fancies of new-fashioned dreams,\n    All the beauty and skill of the ancients will be\n      Swept away by the current of art's modern streams.\n\nWho would run down the fame of Narihira for the sake of the\npretentious humbug of our own days?\"\n\nThen Daini-no-Naishi-no-Ske, of the right, replied,\n\n    \"The noble mind that soars on high,\n      Beyond the star-bespangled sky;\n    Looks down with ease on depths that lie\n      A thousand fathoms 'neath his eye.\"[130]\n\nUpon this, the Empress-mother interceded. She said, that \"The exalted\nnobility of Lord Hi\u00c3\u00b4ye[131] may not, indeed, be passed over without\nnotice, yet the name of Narihira could not altogether be eclipsed by\nhis.\n\n    Though too well-known to all may be\n      The lovely shore of Ise's sea;\n    Its aged fisher's honored name,\n      A tribute of respect may claim.\"\n\nThere were several more rolls to be exhibited, and the rival\nprotestations on both sides became very warm, so that one roll\noccasioned considerable discussion.\n\nWhile this was going on, Genji arrived on the scene. He suggested to\nthem that if there was any competition at all it should be decided on\na specially appointed day, in a more solemn manner, in the presence of\nthe Emperor. This suggestion having been adopted, the discussion came\nto an end.\n\nThe day for this purpose was fixed. The ex-Emperor, who had been\ninformed of this, presented several pictures to the lady of the\nplum-chamber. They were mostly illustrations of Court Festivals, on\nwhich there were explanatory remarks written by the Emperor Yenghi.\nBesides these, there was one which had been expressly executed at his\nown order by Kim-mochi. This was an illustration of the ceremony which\ntook place at his palace on the departure of the lady for Ise, some\ntime back, when she had gone there as the Saig\u00c3\u00bb. It was also probable\nthat some of his pictures came into the possession of her rival, the\nLady Kokiden, through his mother (as the mother of the former was a\nsister of the latter).\n\nWhen the day arrived every arrangement was made in the large saloon at\nthe rear of the Palace, where the Imperial seat was placed at the top.\nThe Court ladies of both parties--those of the lady of the\nplum-chamber, and those of the lady of Kokiden--were arranged\nrespectively left and right, the left, or those of the lady of the\nplum-chamber, facing southwards, and those of the right, northwards.\nAll the courtiers also took the places allotted to them. Here the\npictures were brought. The box, containing those of the left was of\npurple Azedarach. The stand on which the box was placed was of safran,\nand over this was thrown a cover of Chinese brocade with a mauve\nground. The seat underneath was of Chinese colored silk. Six young\ngirls brought all this in, and arranged it all in order. Their Kazami\n(outer dress) was of red and cherry color, with tunics of Wistaria\nlining (light purple outside, and light green within).\n\nThe box which contained the pictures of the right was of \"Jin\" wood,\nthe stand of light colored \"Jin,\" the cover of Corean silk with a\ngreen ground. The legs of the stand, which were trellised round with a\nsilken cord, showed modern and artistic taste. The Kazami of the young\ngirls was of willow lining (white outside and green within), and their\ntunics were of Kerria japonica lining (or yellow outside and light red\nwithin). Both Genji and Gon-Chi\u00c3\u00bbnagon were present, by the Emperor's\nspecial invitation, as also the Prince Lord-Lieutenant of Tzkushi who\nloved pictures above all things, and he was consequently chosen umpire\nfor this day's competition. Many of the pictures were highly\nadmirable, and it was most difficult to make any preference between\nthem. For instance, if there was produced by one party a roll of \"The\nSeason,\" which was the masterpiece of some old master, on selected\nsubjects; there was produced also, by the other party, a roll of\nsketches on paper, which were scarcely inferior to, and more\nornamented with flourishing than the ancient works, in spite of the\nnecessary limitation of space which generally makes the wide expanse\nof scenery almost too difficult to express. Thus the disputes on both\nsides were very warm.\n\nMeanwhile the Imperial-mother (the Princess Wistaria) also came into\nthe saloon, pushing aside the sliding screen of the breakfast chamber.\nThe criticisms still continued, in which Genji made, now and then,\nsuggestive remarks. Before all was finished the shades of evening\nbegan to fall on them. There remained, on the right, one more roll,\nwhen the roll of \"Suma\" was produced on the left. It made\nGon-Chi\u00c3\u00bbnagon slightly embarrassed. The last roll of the right was, of\ncourse, a selected one, but it had several disadvantages in comparison\nwith that of \"Suma.\" The sketches on this roll had been done by Genji,\nwith great pains and time. They were illustrations of different bays\nand shores. They were most skilfully executed, and carried away the\nminds of the spectators to the actual spots. On them illustrative\nremarks were written, sometimes in the shape of a diary, occasionally\nmingled with poetical effusions in style both grave and easy. These\nmade a great impression on the Emperor, and on everyone present; and\nfinally, owing to this roll, the left was decided to have won the\nvictory.\n\nThen followed the partaking of refreshments, as was usual on such\noccasions. In the course of conversation, Genji remarked to the\nLord-Lieutenant, \"From my boyhood I paid much attention to reading and\nwriting, and perhaps my father noticed that I had benefited by these\npursuits. He observed that 'few very clever men enjoyed worldly\nhappiness and long life'; perhaps because ability and knowledge are\ntoo highly valued in the world to admit of other blessings. True it\nis, that even a man whose high birth assures him a certain success in\nlife, ought not to be devoid of learning, but I advise you to moderate\nyour exertions. After this time, he took more pains in instructing me\nin the ways and manners of men of high position than in the minute\ndetails of science. For these reasons, though on the one hand I was\nnot quite clumsy, I cannot, on the other, say in what particular\nsubject I am well versed and efficient. Drawing, however, was a\nfavorite object of my taste and ambition, and I also desired to\nexecute a work to the full extent of my ideas. In the meantime, I\nenjoyed quiet leisure by the sea-shore, and as I contemplated the wide\nexpanse of scenery, my conception seemed to enlarge as I gazed upon\nit. This made me take up my brush, but not a few parts of the work\nhave fallen short of those conceptions. Therefore, I thought them\naltogether unworthy to be shown expressly, though I have now boldly\nsubmitted them to your inspection on this good opportunity.\"\n\n\"Nothing can be well learned that is not agreeable to one's natural\ntaste,\" replied the Lord-Lieutenant. \"It is true, but every art has\nits special instructor, and by this means their methods can be copied\nby their pupils, though there may be differences in skill and\nperfection. Among arts, however, nothing betrays one's tastes and\nnature more than work of pen or brush (writing and painting), and\nplaying the game of Go. Of course men of low origin, and of little\naccomplishment, often happen to excel in these arts, but not so\nfrequently as persons of position. Under the auspicious care of the\nlate Emperor, what prince or princess could have failed to attain the\nknowledge of such arts? a care which was directed towards yourself\nespecially. I will not speak of literature and learning too. Your\naccomplishments comprised the _kin_, next the flute, the mandolin, and\n_soh-koto_--this we all knew, and so, too, the late Emperor said: your\npainting, however, has been hitherto thought to be mere amusement, but\nwe now have seen your sketches executed with a skill not unequal to\nthe ancient famous draughtsmen in black ink.\"\n\nIt was about the twentieth of the month, and the evening moon appeared\nin the sky, while they were thus conversing. Her radiance was too weak\nto make the ground near them bright, but afar-off the sky became\npalely white. Several musical instruments were sent for from the\nguardian of the library. Genji played a _kin_, Gon-Chi\u00c3\u00bbnagon a\n_wagon_, the Lord-Lieutenant a _soh-koto_, and Shi\u00c3\u00b4shi\u00c3\u00b4-no-Mi\u00c3\u00b4bu a\nmandolin. The _hi\u00c3\u00b4shi_ (beating time to music) was undertaken by a\ncourtier. As this went on, the darkness of night began to diminish,\nand the hues of the flowers in the garden, and the countenance of each\nof the party, became gradually visible, while the birds themselves\nbegan to chirp in the trees. It was a pleasant dawn. Several presents\nwere made to the company by the Imperial-mother, and to the\nLord-Lieutenant a robe was given in addition, as an acknowledgment of\nhis services as judge in the competition. And so the party broke up.\nThe roll of \"Suma\" was left, as was requested, in the hands of the\nImperial-mother. Genji had some more rolls of the same series, but\nthey were reserved for some future occasion.\n\nDuring the reign of this Emperor every care was taken on the occasion\nof all Court Festivals, so that future generations should hold that\nsuch and such precedents took their origin in this reign. Hence a\nmeeting even such as above described, which was only private in its\nnature, was carried out in a manner as pleasant and enlightened as\npossible.\n\nAs to Genji, he thought he had obtained a position too exalted, and an\ninfluence too great. There were, indeed, several instances of public\nmen surprised by misfortune, who, in premature age, obtained high\nposition and vast influence. He thought of these examples, and though\nhe had hitherto enjoyed his position and authority, as if he regarded\nthem as a compensation for his former fall, he began, as the Emperor\nwas now becoming older, to retire gradually from public life, so as to\nprepare his mind and thoughts, and devote himself to the attainment of\nhappiness in the world to come, and also for the prolongation of life.\nFor these reasons he ordered a chapel to be built for himself on a\nmountain side, where he might retire. In the meantime he had the\nambition to see his children satisfactorily brought out into the\nworld--an ambition which restrained him from carrying out his wishes\nof retiring.\n\nIt is not easy to understand or define the exact state of his mind at\nthis period.\n\nFOOTNOTES:\n\n[Footnote 125: A short romance, supposed to be the oldest work of the\nkind ever written in Japan, as the authoress states. The story is,\nthat once upon a time there was an aged man whose occupation was to\ncut bamboo. One day he found a knot in a bamboo cane which was radiant\nand shining, and upon cutting it he found in it a little girl who was\nnamed Kakya-hime. He took her home and brought her up. She grew a\nremarkable beauty. She had many suitors, but she refused to listen to\ntheir addresses, and kept her maiden reputation unsullied. Finally, in\nleaving this world, she ascended into the moon, from which she\nprofessed to have originally come down.]\n\n[Footnote 126: This is another old romance, and Toshikag\u00c3\u00a8 is its\nprincipal hero.

This is the case even where poetry is imitative, for\nimitation only pertains to the form of poetry, and not to its essence.\nVergil copied the metre and borrowed the phraseology of Homer, but is\nnever Homeric. In one sense, all national poetry is original, even\nthough it be shackled by rules of traditional prosody, and has adopted\nthe system of rhyme devised by writers in another language, whose\nwords seem naturally to bourgeon into assonant terminations. But\nJapanese poetry is original in every sense of the term. Imitative as\nthe Japanese are, and borrowers from other nations in every department\nof plastic, fictile, and pictorial art, as well as in religion,\npolitics, and manufactures, the poetry of Japan is a true-born flower\nof the soil, unique in its mechanical structure, spontaneous and\nunaffected in its sentiment and subject.\n\nThe present collection of Japanese poetry is compiled and translated\ninto English from what the Japanese call \"The Collection of Myriad\nLeaves,\" and from a number of other anthologies made by imperial\ndecree year by year from the tenth until the fifteenth century. This\nwas the golden age of Japanese literature, and nowadays, when poetry\nis dead in Japan, and the people and their rulers are aiming at\nnothing but the benefits of material civilization, these ancient\nanthologies are drawn upon for vamping up and compiling what pass for\nthe current verses of the hour. The twenty volumes of the \"Myriad\nLeaves\" were probably published first in the latter half of the eighth\ncentury, in the reign of the Mikado Shiyaumu; the editor was Prince\nMoroye, for in those days the cultivation of verse was especially\nconsidered the privilege of the princely and aristocratic. A poem\nwritten by a man of obscure rank was sometimes included in the royal\ncollections, but the name of the author never. And indeed some of the\ndistinctive quality of Japanese poetry is undoubtedly due to the air\nin which it flourished. It is never religious, and it is often\nimmoral, but it is always suffused with a certain hue of courtliness,\neven gentleness. The language is of the most refined delicacy, the\nthought is never boorish or rude; there is the self-collectedness\nwhich we find in the poetry of France and Italy during the\nRenaissance, and in England during the reign of Queen Anne. It\nexhibits the most exquisite polish, allied with an avoidance of every\nshocking or perturbing theme. It seems to combine the enduring lustre\nof a precious metal with the tenuity of gold-leaf. Even the most vivid\nemotions of grief and love, as well as the horrors of war, were\nbanished from the Japanese Parnassus, where the Muse of Tragedy\nwarbles, and the lyric Muse utters nothing but ditties of exquisite\nand melting sweetness, which soothe the ear, but never stir the heart:\nwhile their meaning is often so obscure as even to elude the\nunderstanding.\n\nAllied to this polite reserve of the courtly poets of Japan is the\nsimplicity of their style, which is, doubtless, in a large measure,\ndue to the meagre range of spiritual faculties which characterize the\nJapanese mind. This intellectual poverty manifests itself in the\nabsence of all personification and reference to abstract ideas. The\nnarrow world of the poet is here a concrete and literal sphere of\nexperience. He never rises on wings above the earth his feet are\ntreading, and the things around him that his fingers touch. But within\nthis limited area he revels in a great variety of subjects. In the\npresent anthology will be found ballads, love-songs, elegies, as well\nas short stanzas composed with the strictest economy of word and\nphrase. These we must characterize as epigrams. They are gems,\npolished with almost passionless nicety and fastidious care. They\nremind us very much of Roman poetry under the later Empire, and many\nof them might have been written by Martial, at the court of Domitian.\nThey contain references to court doings, compliments, and sentiments\ncouched in pointed language. The drama of Japan is represented by two\ntypes, one of which may be called lyrical, and the other the comedy of\nreal life. Specimens of both are found in the present collection,\nwhich will furnish English readers with a very fair idea of what the\nmost interesting and enterprising of Oriental nations has done in the\ndomain of imaginative literature.\n\nE.

[_He returns to the outer\nhall and addresses his father._] Condescend to come this way.\n           [_They go to Bijiyau's apartment._\n\nNAKAMITSU.--It is long since I was last here.\n\nBIJIYAU.--And what is it that hath now brought thee?\n\nNAKAMITSU.--'Tis that my lord, your father, hath sent me to bid your\nlordship follow me home without delay.\n\nBIJIYAU.--Shall I, then, go without saying anything to the priests, my\npreceptors?\n\nNAKAMITSU.--Yes; if the priests be told, they will surely wish to see\nyour lordship on the way, whereas, my lord, your father's commands\nwere, that I alone was to escort you.\n\nBIJIYAU.--Then we will away.\n\nNAKAMITSU.--Kauzhiyu! thou, too, shalt accompany thy master.\n\nKAUZHIYU.--Your commands shall be obeyed.\n\n    [_They depart from the temple, and arrive at Mitsunaka's palace._\n\nNAKAMITSU.--How shall I dare address my lord? I have brought hither\nhis lordship Bijiyau.\n\nMITSUNAKA.--Well, Bijiyau! my only reason for sending thee up to the\nmonastery was to help thy learning; and I would fain begin, by hearing\nthee read aloud from the Scriptures.\n    And with these words, and bidding him read on,\n    He lays on ebon desk before his son\n    The sacred text, in golden letters writ.\n\nBIJIYAU.--But how may he who never bent his wit\n    To make the pencil trace Asaka's[163] line\n    Spell out one letter of the book divine?\n    In vain, in vain his sire's behest he hears:--\n    Nought may he do but choke with idle tears.\n\nMITSUNAKA.--Ah! surely 'tis that, being my child, he respecteth the\nScriptures too deeply, and chooseth not to read them except for\npurposes of devotion. What of verse-making, then?\n\nBIJIYAU.--I cannot make any.\n\nMITSUNAKA.--And music?      [_Bijiyau makes no answer._\n\nMITSUNAKA.--What! no reply? Hast lost thy tongue, young fool?\n\nCHORUS.--Whom, then, to profit wentest thou to school?\n    And can it be that e'en a father's word,\n    Like snow that falling melts, is scarcely heard,\n    But 'tis unheeded? Ah! 'twill drive me wild\n    To point thee out to strangers as my child!\n    No sooner said, than out the scabbard flies\n    His trusty sword, and with fierce flashing eyes\n    Forward he darts; but rushing in between,\n    Good Nakamitsu checks the bloody scene--\n    Firm, though respectful, stays his master's arm,\n    And saves the lad from perilous alarm.\n\nNAKAMITSU.--Good my lord, deign to be merciful this once!\n\nMITSUNAKA.--Why stayed'st thou my hand? Haste thou now and slay\nBijiyau with this my sword.\n\nNAKAMITSU.--Your commands shall be obeyed. [_He retires into another\napartment._] What is this horror unutterable? 'Tis no mere passing fit\nof anger. What shall I do?--Ah! I have it! I have it! I will take upon\nmyself to contrive some plan for his escape. Kauzhiyu, Kauzhiyu, art\nthou there?\n\nKAUZHIYU.--Behold me at thy service.\n\nNAKAMITSU.--Where is my lord Bijiyau?\n\nKAUZHIYU.--All my prayers have been unavailing to make him leave this\nspot.\n\nNAKAMITSU.--But why will he not seek refuge somewhere? Here am I come\nfrom my lord, his father, as a messenger of death!     [_Bijiyau shows\nhimself._\n\nBIJIYAU.--That I am alive here at this moment is thy doing. But\nthrough the lattice I heard my father's words to thee just now.\n    Little imports it an' I die or live,\n    But 'tis for thee I cannot choose but grieve\n    If thou do vex thy lord: to avert his ire\n    Strike off my head, and show it to my sire!\n\nNAKAMITSU.--My lord, deign to be calm! I will take upon myself to\ncontrive some plan for your escape.--What! say you a messenger hath\ncome? My heart sinks within me.--What! another messenger?\n\n    [_These are messengers from Mitsunaka to ask whether his orders be not\n    yet carried into execution_.\n\nNAKAMITSU.--Alas! each joy, each grief we see unfurl'd\n    Rewards some action in a former world.\n\nKAUZHIYU.--In ages past thou sinned;\n\nBIJIYAU.--And to-day\n\nCHORUS.--Comes retribution! think not then to say\n    'Tis others' fault, nor foolishly upbraid\n    The lot thyself for thine own self hast made.\n    Say not the world's askew! with idle prate\n    Of never-ending grief the hour grows late.\n    Strike off my head! with many a tear he cries,\n    And might, in sooth, draw tears from any eyes.[164]\n\nNAKAMITSU.--Ah! young my lord, were I but of like age with thee, how\nreadily would I not redeem thy life at the cost of mine own! Alas!\nthat so easy a sacrifice should not be possible!\n\nKAUZHIYU.--Father, I would make bold to speak a word unto thee.\n\nNAKAMITSU.--What may it be?\n\nKAUZHIYU.--'Tis, father, that the words thou hast just spoken have\nfound a lodgment in mine ears. Thy charge, truly, is Mitsunaka; but\nMitsunaka's son is mine. This, if any, is a great occasion, and my\nyears point to me as of right the chief actor in it. Be quick! be\nquick! strike off my head, and show it to Mitsunaka[165] as the head\nof my lord Bijiyau!\n\nNAKAMITSU.--Thou'st spoken truly, Nakamitsu cries,\n    And the long sword from out his scabbard flies,\n    What time he strides behind his boy.\n\nBIJIYAU.--But no!\n    The youthful lord on such stupendous woe\n    May never gaze unmov'd; with bitter wail\n    The father's sleeve he clasps. Nought may 't avail,\n    He weeping cries, e'en should the deed be done,\n    For I will slay myself if falls thy son.\n\nKAUZHIYU.--But 'tis the rule--a rule of good renown--\n    That for his lord a warrior must lay down\n    His lesser life.\n\nBIJIYAU.--          But e'en if lesser, yet\n    He, too, is human; neither shouldst forget\n    What shame will e'er be mine if I survive\n\nNAKAMITSU.--Alas! alas! and 'tis for death they strive!\n\nKAUZHIYU.--Me deign to hear.\n\nBIJIYAU.--No! mine the truer word!\n\nNAKAMITSU.--Ah! this my child!\n\nKAUZHIYU.--And there behold thy lord!\n\nNAKAMITSU.--Betwixt the two see Nakamitsu stand:--\n\nCHORUS.--His own brave life, an' 'twere his lord's command,\n    Were freely giv'n; but now, in sore dismay,\n    E'en his fierce courage fades and droops away.\n\nBIJIYAU.--Why heed a life my sire himself holds cheap?\n    Nought may thy pity do but sink more deep\n    My soul in wretchedness.\n\nKAUZHIYU.--Mistake me not!\n    Think not 'tis pity moves me; but a blot\n    The martial honor of our house will stain,\n    If, when I might have bled, my lord be slain.\n\nCHORUS.--On either side 'tis infancy that pleads.\n\nNAKAMITSU.--And yet how well they've learnt where duty leads!\n\nCHORUS.--Dear is thy lord!\n\nNAKAMITSU.--And mine own child how dear!\n\nCHORUS.--But Nakamitsu knows full well that ne'er,\n    To save the child his craven heart ador'd,\n    Warrior yet dar'd lay hands upon his lord.\n    He to the left, the trembling father cries,\n    Was sure my boy, nor lifts his tear-stain'd eyes:--\n    A flash, a moment, the fell sabre gleams,\n    And sends his infant to the land of dreams.[166]\n\nNAKAMITSU.--Oh, horror unutterable! to think that I should have slain\nmine own innocent child! But I must go and inform my lord. [_He goes\nto Mitsunaka's apartment._ How shall I dare to address my lord? I\nhave slain my lord Bijiyau according to your commands.\n\nMITSUNAKA.--So thou hast killed the fellow? I trow his last moments\nwere those of a coward. Is it not true?\n\nNAKAMITSU.--Not so, my lord. As I stood there aghast, holding in my\nhand the sword your lordship gave me, your son called out, \"Why doth\nNakamitsu thus delay?\" and those were the last words he was pleased to\nutter.\n\nMITSUNAKA.--As thou well knowest, Bijiyau was mine only child. Go and\ncall thy son Kauzhiyu, and I will adopt him as mine heir.\n\nNAKAMITSU.--Kauzhiyu, my lord, in despair at being separated from\nyoung my lord, hath cut off his locks,[167] and vanished none knows\nwhither.\n    I, too, thy gracious license would obtain.\n    Hence to depart, and in some holy fane\n    To join the priesthood.\n\nMITSUNAKA.--Harsh was my decree,\n    Yet can I think what thy heart's grief must be\n    That as its own my recreant child receiv'd,\n    And now of both its children is bereav'd.\n    But 'tis a rule of universal sway\n    That a retainer ever must obey.\n\nCHORUS.--Thus would my lord, with many a suasion fond,\n    Have rais'd poor Nakamitsu from despond.\n    Nor eke himself, with heart all stony hard,\n    Might, as a father, ev'ry pang discard:--\n    Behold him now, oh! lamentable sight!\n    O'er his own son perform the fun'ral rite.\n\n\n\n\nPART II\n\nScene I.--Mitsunaka's Palace\n\n\n_Some time is supposed to have elapsed, and Weshi\u00c3\u00b1, abbot of the\nmonastery on Mount Hiyei, comes down from that retreat to Mitsunaka's\npalace in the capital, bringing with him Bijiyau, who had been\npersuaded by Nakamitsu to take refuge with the holy man._\n\nWESHI\u00c3\u0091.--I am the priest Weshi\u00c3\u00b1, and am hastening on my way to my lord\nMitsunaka's palace, whither certain motives guide me. [_They arrive at\nthe gate and he cries out_:] I would fain crave admittance.\n\nNAKAMITSU.--Who is it that asks to be admitted? Ah! 'tis his\nreverence, Weshi\u00c3\u00b1.\n\nWESHI\u00c3\u0091.--Alas, for poor Kauzhiyu!\n\nNakamitsu.--Yes; but prithee speak not of this before his lordship.\n[_He goes to Mitsunaka's apartment._] How shall I venture to address\nmy lord? His reverence, Weshi\u00c3\u00b1, hath arrived from Mount Hiyei.\n\nMITSUNAKA.--Call him hither.\n\nNakamitsu.--Your commands shall be obeyed. [_He goes to the room where\nWeshi\u00c3\u00b1 is waiting, and says_:] Be pleased to pass this way.\n\n    [_They enter Mitsunaka's apartment._\n\nMITSUNAKA.--What may it be that has brought your reverence here\nto-day?\n\nWESHI\u00c3\u0091.--'Tis this, and this only. I come desiring to speak to your\nlordship anent my lord Bijiyau.\n\nMITSUNAKA.--Respecting him I gave orders to Nakamitsu, which orders\nhave been carried out.\n\nWESHI\u00c3\u0091.--Ah! my lord, 'tis that, 'tis that I would discourse of. Be\nnot agitated, but graciously deign to give me thine attention while I\nspeak. Thou didst indeed command that my lord Bijiyau's head should\nbe struck off. But never might Nakamitsu prevail upon himself to lay\nhands on one to whom, as his lord, he knew himself bound in reverence\nthrough all the changing scenes of the Three Worlds.[168] Wherefore he\nslew his own son, Kauzhiyu, to save my lord Bijiyau's life. And now\nhere I come bringing Bijiyau with me, and would humbly supplicate thee\nto forgive one who was so loved that a man hath given his own son in\nexchange for him.[169]\n\nMITSUNAKA.--Then he was a coward, as I thought! Wherefore, if Kauzhiyu\nwas sacrificed, did he, too, not slay himself?\n\nWESHI\u00c3\u0091.--My lord, put all other thoughts aside, and if it be only as\nan act of piety towards Kauzhiyu's soul--curse not thy son!\n\nCHORUS.--As thus the good man speaks,\n    Tears of entreaty pour adown his cheeks.\n    The father hears, and e'en his ruthless breast,\n    Soft'ning at last, admits the fond request,\n    While Nakamitsu, crowning their delight,\n    The flow'ry wine brings forth, and cups that might\n    Have served the fays: but who would choose to set\n    Their fav'rite's bliss that, home returning, wet\n    His grandson's grandson's still remoter line,\n    Beside the joy that doth itself entwine\n    Round the fond hearts of father and of son,\n    Parted and now in the same life made one?\n\nWESHI\u00c3\u0091.--Prithee, Nakamitsu, wilt thou not dance and sing to us\nawhile, in honor of this halcyon hour?\n\n    [_During the following song Nakamitsu dances._\n\nNAKAMITSU.--Water-bird, left all alone\n    Now thy little mate hath flown,\n    On the billows to and fro\n    Flutter, flutter, full of woe!\n\nCHORUS.--Full of woe, so full of woe,\n    Flutter, flutter, full of woe!\n\nNAKAMITSU.--Ah! if my darling were but here to-day\n    I'd make the two together dance and play\n    While I beat time, and, gazing on my boy,\n    Instead of tears of grief, shed tears of joy!\n\nCHORUS.--Behold him weep!\n\nNAKAMITSU.--But the gay throng perceive\n    Nought but the rhythmic waving of my sleeve.\n\nCHORUS.--Hither and thither, flutt'ring in the wind.\n\nNAKAMITSU.--Above, beneath, with many a dewdrop lin'd!\n\nCHORUS.--Ah, dewy tears! in this our world of woe\n    If any stay, the friends he loves must go:--\n    Thus 'tis ordain'd, and he that smiles to-day\n    To-morrow owns blank desolation's sway.\n    But now 'tis time to part, the good priest cries--\n    Him his disciple follows, and they rise;\n    While Nakamitsu walking in their train,\n    The palanquin escorts; for he would fain\n    Last counsel give: \"Beware, young lord, beware!\n    Nor cease from toilsome study; for if e'er\n    Thy sire again be anger'd, all is lost!\"\n    Then takes his leave, low bending to the dust.\n    Forward they're borne; but Nakamitsu stays,\n    Watching and weeping with heart-broken gaze,\n    And, mutely weeping, thinks how ne'er again\n    He'll see his child borne homeward o'er the plain.\n\n\n\n\nABSTRACTION\n\n[_The Japanese title is \"Za-ze\u00c3\u00b1\"._]\n\n\nDRAMATIS PERSON\u00c3\u0086\n\nA HUSBAND.\n\nHIS WIFE.\n\nTARAUKUWAZHIYA, their servant.\n\n\n\n\nABSTRACTION\n\nScene I.--A Room in a Private House in Kiyauto\n\n\nHUSBAND.--I am a resident in the suburbs of the metropolis. On the\noccasion of a recent journey down[170] East, I was served (at a\ntea-house) in the post-town of Nogami, in the province of Mino, by a\ngirl called Hana, who, having since then heard of my return to the\ncapital, has followed me up here, and settled down at Kita-Shira-kaha,\nwhere she expects me this evening according to a promise made by\nletter. But my vixen of a wife has got scent of the affair and thus\nmade it difficult for me to go. So what I mean to do is to call her,\nand tell her some pretty fable that may set me free. Halloo! halloo!\nare you there, pray? are you there?\n\nWIFE.--So it seems you are pleased to call me. What may it be that\nmakes you thus call me?\n\nHUSBAND.--Well, please to come in.\n\nWIFE.--Your commands are obeyed.\n\nHUSBAND.--My reason for calling you is just simply this: I want to\ntell you how much my spirits have been affected by continual dreams\nthat I have had. That is why I have called you.\n\nWIFE.--You are talking rubbish. Dreams proceed from organic\ndisturbance, and do not come true; so pray don't trouble your head\nabout them.\n\nHUSBAND.--What you say is quite correct. Dreams, proceeding as they do\nfrom organic disturbance, do not come true nine times out of ten.\nStill, mine have affected my spirits to such an extent, that I think\nof making some pilgrimage or other to offer up prayers both on your\nbehalf and on my own.\n\nWIFE.--Then where shall you go?\n\nHUSBAND.--I mean (to say nothing of those in the metropolis and in the\nsuburbs) to worship at every Shi\u00c3\u00b1tau shrine and every Buddhist temple\nthroughout the land.\n\nWIFE.--No, no! I won't allow you to go out of the house for a single\nhour. If you are so completely bent upon it, choose some devotion that\ncan be performed at home.\n\nHUSBAND.--Some devotion to be performed at home? What devotion could\nit be?\n\nWIFE.--Burning incense on your arm or on your head.[171]\n\nHUSBAND.--How thoughtlessly you do talk! What! is a devotion like that\nto suit _me_--a layman if ever there was one?\n\nWIFE.--I won't tolerate any devotion that cannot be performed at home.\n\nHUSBAND.--Well, I never! You _are_ one for talking at random. Hang it!\nwhat devotion shall it be? [_He reflects a few moments._] Ah! I have\nit! I will perform the devotion of abstraction.\n\nWIFE.--Abstraction? What is that?\n\nHUSBAND.--Your want of familiarity with the term is but natural. It is a\ndevotion that was practised in days of old by Saint Daruma[172]--(blessings\non him!) you put your head under what is called the \"abstraction blanket,\"\nand obtain salvation by forgetting all things past and to come--a most\ndifficult form of devotion.\n\nWIFE.--About how long does it take?\n\nHUSBAND.--Well, I should say about a week or two.\n\nWIFE.--That won't do, either, if it is to last so many days.\n\nHUSBAND.--Then for how long would my darling consent to it without\ncomplaining?\n\nWIFE.--About one hour is what I should suggest; but, however, if you\ncan do it in a day, you are welcome to try.\n\nHUSBAND.--Never, never! This important devotion is not a thing to be\nso easily performed within the limits of a single day. Please, won't\nyou grant me leave for at least a day and a night?\n\nWIFE.--A day and a night?\n\nHUSBAND.--Yes.\n\nWIFE.--I don't much relish the idea; but if you are so completely bent\nupon it, take a day and a night for your devotion.\n\nHUSBAND.--Really and truly?\n\nWIFE.--Really and truly.\n\nHUSBAND.--Oh! that is indeed too delightful! But I have something to\ntell you: know then, that if a woman so much as peep through a chink,\nto say nothing of her coming into the actual room where the devotee is\nsitting, the spell of the devotion is instantly broken. So be sure not\nto come to where I am.\n\nWIFE.--All right. I will not come to you. So perform away.\n\nHUSBAND.--Well, then, we will meet again after it shall have been\nhappily accomplished.\n\nWIFE.--I shall have the pleasure of seeing you when it is over.\n\nHUSBAND AND WIFE.--Good-by! good-by!      [_She moves away._\n\nHUSBAND.--I say!\n\nWIFE.--What is it?\n\nHUSBAND.--As I mentioned before, mind you don't come to me. We have\nthe Buddhist's warning words: \"When there is a row in the kitchen, to\nbe rapt in abstraction is an impossibility.\"[173] So whatever you do,\ndo not come to me.\n\nWIFE.--Please feel no uneasiness. I shall not think of intruding.\n\nHUSBAND.--Well, then, we shall meet again when the devotion is over.\n\nWIFE.--When it is done, I shall have the pleasure of seeing you.\n\nHUSBAND AND WIFE.--Good-by! Good-by!\n\nHUSBAND [_laughing_].--What fools women are, to be sure! To think of\nthe delight of her taking it all for truth, when I tell her that I am\ngoing to perform the religious devotion of abstraction for one whole\nday and night! Taraukuwazhiya, are you there? halloo?\n\nSERVANT.--Yes, sir!\n\nHUSBAND.--Are you there?\n\nSERVANT.--At your service.\n\nHUSBAND.--Oh! you have been quick in coming.\n\nSERVANT.--You seem, master, to be in good spirits.\n\nHUSBAND.--For my good spirits there is a good reason. I have made, as\nyou know, an engagement to go and visit Hana this evening. But as my\nold woman has got scent of the affair, thus making it difficult for me\nto go, I have told her that I mean to perform the religious devotion\nof abstraction for a whole day and night--a very good denial, is it\nnot? for carrying out my plan of going to see Hana!\n\nSERVANT.--A very good device indeed, sir.\n\nHUSBAND.--But in connection with it, I want to ask you to do me a good\nturn. Will you?\n\nSERVANT.--Pray, what may it be?\n\nHUSBAND.--Why, just simply this: it is that I have told my old woman\nnot to intrude on my devotions; but, being the vixen that she is, who\nknows but what she may not peep and look in? in which case she would\nmake a fine noise if there were no semblance of a religious practice\nto be seen; and so, though it is giving you a great deal of trouble, I\nwish you would oblige me by taking my place until my return.\n\nSERVANT.--Oh! it would be no trouble; but I shall get such a scolding\nif found out, that I would rather ask you to excuse me.\n\nHUSBAND.--What nonsense you talk! Do oblige me by taking my place; for\nI will not allow her to scold you.\n\nSERVANT.--Oh sir! that is all very well; but pray excuse me for this\ntime.\n\nHUSBAND.--No, no! you must please do this for me; for I will not so\nmuch as let her point a finger at you.\n\nSERVANT.--Please, please let me off!\n\nHUSBAND.--Gracious goodness! The fellow heeds what my wife says, and\nwon't heed what I say myself! Do you mean that you have made up your\nmind to brave me?\n\n    [_Threatening to beat him._\n\nSERVANT.--Oh! I will obey.\n\nHUSBAND.--No, no! you mean to brave me!\n\nSERVANT.--Oh no, sir! surely I have no choice but to obey.\n\nHUSBAND.--Really and truly?\n\nSERVANT.--Yes, really and truly.\n\nHUSBAND.--My anger was only a feint. Well, then, take my place,\nplease.\n\nSERVANT.--Yes, to be sure; if it is your desire, I will do so.\n\nHUSBAND.--That is really too delightful. Just stop quiet while I set\nthings to rights for you to sit in abstraction.\n\nSERVANT.--Your commands are laid to heart.\n\nHUSBAND.--Sit down here.\n\nSERVANT.--Oh! what an unexpected honor!\n\nHUSBAND.--Now, then; I fear it will be uncomfortable, but oblige me by\nputting your head under this \"abstraction blanket.\"\n\nSERVANT.--Your commands are laid to heart.\n\nHUSBAND.--Well, it is scarcely necessary to say so; but even if my old\nwoman should tell you to take off the abstraction blanket, be sure not\nto do so until my return.\n\nSERVANT.--Of course not. I should not think of taking it off. Pray\ndon't be alarmed.\n\nHUSBAND.--I will be back soon.\n\nSERVANT.--Please be good enough to return quickly.\n\nHUSBAND.--Ah! that is well over! No doubt Hana is waiting impatiently\nfor me. I will make haste and go.\n\nWIFE.--I am mistress of this house. I perfectly understood my partner\nthe first time he asked me not to come to him on account of the\nreligious devotion which he was going to perform. But there is\nsomething suspicious in his insisting on it a second time with a\n\"Don't come to look at me! don't come to look at me!\" So I will just\npeep through some hidden corner, and see what the thing looks like.\n[_Peeping._] What's this? Why, it seems much more uncomfortable than I\nhad supposed! [_Coming in and drawing near._] Please, please; you told\nme not to come to you, and therefore I had intended not to do so; but\nI felt anxious, and so I have come. Won't you lift off that\n\"abstraction blanket,\" and take something, if only a cup of tea, to\nunbend your mind a little? [_The figure under the blanket shakes its\nhead._] You are quite right. The thought of my being so disobedient\nand coming to you after the care you took to tell me not to intrude\nmay justly rouse your anger; but please forgive my rudeness, and do\nplease take that blanket off and repose yourself, do! [_The figure\nshakes its head again._] You may say no again and again, but I _will_\nhave it off. You _must_ take it off. Do you hear? [_She pulls it off,\nand Taraukuwazhiya stands exposed._] What! you, you rascal? Where has\nmy old man gone? Won't you speak? Won't you speak?\n\nSERVANT.--Oh! I know nothing.\n\nWIFE.--Oh! how furious I am! Oh! how furious I am! Of course he must\nhave gone to that woman's house. Won't you speak? Won't you speak? I\nshall tear you in pieces?\n\nSERVANT.--In that case, how can I keep anything from you? Master has\nwalked out to see Miss Hana.\n\nWIFE.--What! _Miss_ Hana, do you say? Say, _Minx_, say _Minx_.\nGracious me, what a rage I am in! Then he really has gone to Hana's\nhouse, has he?\n\nSERVANT.--Yes, he really has gone there.\n\nWIFE.--Oh! when I hear he has gone to Hana's house, I feel all ablaze,\nand oh! in such a passion! oh! in such a passion!      [_She bursts out\ncrying._\n\nSERVANT.--Your tears are but natural.\n\nWIFE.--Ah! I had meant not to let you go if you had kept it from me.\nBut as you have told the truth I forgive you. So get up.\n\nSERVANT.--I am extremely grateful for your kindness.\n\nWIFE.--Now tell me, how came you to be sitting there?\n\nSERVANT.--It was master's order that I should take his place; and so,\nalthough it was most repugnant to me, there was no alternative but for\nme to sit down, and I did so.\n\nWIFE.--Naturally. Now I want to ask you to do me a good turn. Will\nyou?\n\nSERVANT.--Pray, what may it be?\n\nWIFE.--Why, just simply this: you will arrange the blanket on top of\nme just as it was arranged on the top of you; won't you?\n\nSERVANT.--Oh! your commands ought of course to be laid to heart; but I\nshall get such a scolding if the thing becomes known, that I would\nrather ask you to excuse me.\n\nWIFE.--No, no! I will not allow him to scold you; so you must really\nplease arrange me.\n\nSERVANT.--Please, please, let me off this time.\n\nWIFE.--No, no! you must arrange me, as I will not so much as let him\npoint a finger at you.\n\nSERVANT.--Well, then, if it comes to my getting a scolding, I count on\nyou, ma'am, as an intercessor.\n\nWIFE.--Of course. I will intercede for you; so do you please arrange\nme.\n\nSERVANT.--In that case, be so good as to sit down here.\n\nWIFE.--All right.\n\nSERVANT.--I fear it will be uncomfortable, but I must ask you to put\nyour head under this.\n\nWIFE.--Please arrange me so that he cannot possibly know the\ndifference between us.\n\nSERVANT.--He will never know. It will do very nicely like this.\n\nWIFE.--Will it?\n\nSERVANT.--Yes.\n\nWIFE.--Well, then! do you go and rest.\n\nSERVANT.--Your commands are laid to heart.\n\n    [_He moves away._\n\nWIFE.--Wait a moment, Taraukuwazhiya!\n\nSERVANT.--Yes, ma'am.\n\nWIFE.--It is scarcely necessary to say so, but be sure not to tell him\nthat it is I.\n\nSERVANT.--Of course not, I should not think of telling him.\n\nWIFE.--It has come to my ears that you have been secretly wishing for\na purse and silk wrapper.[174] I will give you one of each which I\nhave worked myself.\n\nSERVANT.--I am extremely grateful for your kindness.\n\nWIFE.--Now be off and rest.\n\nSERVANT.--Yes, ma'am.\n\n    _Enter husband, singing as he walks along the road._\n\n     Why should the lonely sleeper heed\n      The midnight bell, the bird of dawn?\n    But ah! they're sorrowful indeed\n      When loosen'd was the damask zone.\n\n    Her image still, with locks that sleep\n      Had tangled, haunts me, and for aye;\n    Like willow-sprays where winds do sweep,\n      All tangled too, my feelings lie.\n\nAs the world goes, it rarely happens even with the most ardent secret\nlove; but in my case I never see her but what I care for her more and\nmore:--\n\n    'Twas in the spring-time that we first did meet,\n    Nor e'er can I forget my flow'ret sweet.\n\nAh well! ah well! I keep talking like one in a dream, and meantime\nTaraukuwazhiya is sure to be impatiently awaiting me. I must get home.\nHow will he have been keeping my place for me? I feel a bit uneasy.\n[_He arrives at his house._] Halloo! halloo! Taraukuwazhiya! I'm back!\nI'm back! [_He enters the room._] I'm just back. Poor fellow! the time\nmust have seemed long to you. There now! [_Seating himself._] Well, I\nshould like to tell you to take off the \"abstraction blanket\"; but you\nwould probably feel ashamed at being exposed.[175] Anyhow I will\nrelate to you what Hana said last night if you care to listen. Do you?\n[_The figure nods acquiescence._] So you would like to? Well, then,\nI'll tell you all about it: I made all the haste I could, but yet it\nwas nearly dark before I arrived; and I was just going to ask\nadmittance, my thoughts full of how anxiously Hana must be waiting for\nme in her loneliness, saying, perhaps, with the Chinese poet[176]:--\n\n    He promised but he comes not, and I lie on my pillow in the fifth\n        watch of the night:--\n    The wind shakes the pine trees and the bamboos; can it be my beloved?\n\nwhen there comes borne to me the sound of her voice, humming as she\nsat alone:--\n\n    \"The breezes through the pine trees moan,\n      The dying torch burns low;\n    Ah me! 'tis eerie all alone!\n      Say, will he come or no?\"\n\nSo I gave a gentle rap on the back door, on hearing which she cried\nout: \"Who's there? who's there?\" Well, a shower was falling at the\ntime. So I answered by singing:--\n\n    Who comes to see you Hana dear,\n      Regardless of the soaking rain?\n    And do your words, Who's there, who's there?\n      Mean that you wait for lovers twain?\n\nto which Hana replied:--\n\n    \"What a fine joke! well, who can tell?\n      On such a dark and rainy night\n    Who ventures out must love me well,\n      And I, of course, must be polite,\n      And say: Pray sir, pass this way.\"\n\nAnd, with these words, she loosened the ring and staple with a\ncling-a-ring, and pushed open the door with a crick-a-tick; and while\nthe breeze from the bamboo blind poured towards me laden with the\nscent of flowers, out she comes to me, and, \"At your service, sir,\"\nsays she, \"though I am but a poor country maid.\" So in we went, hand\nin hand, to the parlor. But yet her first question, \"Who's there?\" had\nleft me so doubtful as to whether she might not be playing a double\ngame, that I turned my back on her, and said crossly that I supposed\nshe had been expecting a number of lovers, and that the thought quite\nspoiled my pleasure. But oh! what a darling Hana is! Coming to my side\nand clasping tight my hand, she whispered, saying:\n\n    \"If I do please you not, then from the first\n    Better have said that I do please you not;\n    But wherefore pledge your troth, and after turn\n    Against me? Alas! alas!\n\n\"Why be so angry? I am playing no double game.\" Then she asked why I\nhad not brought you, Taraukuwazhiya, with me; and on my telling her\nthe reason why you had remained at home, \"Poor fellow!\" said she, \"how\nlonely he must be all by himself! Never was there a handier lad at\neverything than he, though doubtless it is a case of the mugwort\nplanted among the hemp, which grows straight without need of twisting,\nand of the sand mixed with the mud, which gets black without need of\ndyeing,[177] and it is his having been bound to you from a boy that\nhas made him so genteel and clever. Please always be a kind master to\nhim.\" Yes, those are the things you have said of you when Hana is the\nspeaker. As for my old vixen, she wouldn't let as much fall from her\nmug in the course of a century, I'll warrant! [_Violent shaking under\nthe blanket._] Then she asked me to pass into the inner room to rest\nawhile. So in we went to the inner room, hand in hand. And then she\nbrought out wine and food, and pressed me to drink, so that what with\ndrinking one's self, and passing the cup to her, and pressing each\nother to drink, we kept feasting until quite far into the night, when\nat her suggestion another room was sought and a little repose taken.\nBut soon day began to break, and I said I would go home. Then Hana\nexclaimed:--\n\n    \"Methought that when I met thee, dearest heart!\n    I'd tell thee all that swells within my breast:--\n    But now already 'tis the hour to part,\n    And oh! how much still lingers unexpress'd!\n\nPlease stay and rest a little longer!\" \"But no!\" said I, \"I must get\nhome. All the temple-bells are a-ringing.\" \"And heartless priests they\nare,\" cried she, \"that ring them! Horrid wretches to begin their\nding-dong, ding-dong, ding-dong, when it is still the middle of the\nnight!\" But for all her entreaties, and for all my own regrets, I\nremembered that \"meeting is but parting,\" and,\n\n    Tearing me loose, I made to go; farewell!\n    Farewell a thousand times, like ocean sands\n    Untold! and followed by her distant gaze\n    I went; but as I turn'd me round, the moon,\n    A slender rim, sparkling remain'd behind,\n    And oh! what pain it was to me to part!\n\n[_He sheds tears._] And so I came home. Oh! isn't it a pity? [_Weeping\nagain._] Ah well! out of my heart's joy has flamed all this long\nhistory, and meanwhile you must be very uncomfortable. Take off that\n\"abstraction blanket.\" Take it off, for I have nothing more to tell\nyou. Gracious goodness! what a stickler you are! Well, then! I must\npull it off myself. I _will_ have it off, man! do you hear me?\n\n    [_He pulls off the blanket, and up jumps his wife._\n\nWIFE.--Oh! how furious I am! Oh! how furious I am! To hoax me and go\noff to Hana in that manner!\n\nHUSBAND.--Oh! not at all, not at all! I never went to Hana. I have\nbeen performing my devotions, indeed I have.\n\nWIFE.--What! so he means to come and tell me that he has been\nperforming his devotions? and then into the bargain to talk about\n\"things the old vixen would never have let drop\"! Oh! I'm all ablaze\nwith rage! Hoaxing me and going off--where? Going off where?\n\n    [_Pursuing her husband round the stage._\n\nHUSBAND.--Not at all, not at all! I never said anything of the kind.\nDo, do forgive me! do forgive me!\n\nWIFE.--Oh! how furious I am! Oh! how furious I am! Where have you\nbeen, sir? where have you been?\n\nHUSBAND.--Well, then! why should I conceal it from you? I have been to\npray both for your welfare and for my own at the Temple of the Five\nHundred Disciples[178] in Tsukushi.\n\nWIFE.--Oh! how furious I am! Oh! how furious I am! as if you could\nhave got as far as the Five Hundred Disciples!\n\nHUSBAND.--Do, do forgive me! Do forgive me!\n\nWIFE.--Oh! how furious I am! Oh! how furious I am!\n\n    [_The husband runs away._\n\nWhere's the unprincipled wretch off to? Is there nobody there? Please\ncatch him! I won't let him escape! I won't let him escape!\n\nFOOTNOTES:\n\n[Footnote 162: The reader will call to mind the extreme simplicity\nwhich distinguishes the method of representing the Japanese lyric\ndramas.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http:\/\/pglaf.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n\n*** END: FULL LICENSE ***\n","id":900,"split":"train"}
