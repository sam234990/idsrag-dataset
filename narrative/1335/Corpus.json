{"ori_id":"ad020448b562d244e23b4d9a55fde6b31971f583","title":"Marius the Epicurean","context":"Marius the Epicurean\n Marius, a sensitive only child of a patrician family, growing up near Luna in rural Etruria, is impressed by the traditions and rituals of the ancestral religion of the Lares, by his natural surroundings, and by a boyhood visit to a sanctuary of Aesculapius. His childhood ends with the death of his mother (he had early lost his father) and with his departure for boarding school in Pisae. As a youth he is befriended by and falls under the influence of a brilliant, hedonistic older boy, Flavianus, who awakens in him a love of literature (the two read with delight the story of Cupid and Psyche in Apuleius, and Pater in due course makes Flavian, who is \"an ardent student of words, of the literary art\", the author of the Pervigilium Veneris). Flavian falls ill during the Festival of Isis and Marius tends him during his long death-agony (end of 'Part the First'). Grown to manhood, Marius now embraces the philosophy of the 'flux' of Heraclitus and the Epicureanism (or Cyrenaicism) of Aristippus. He journeys to Rome (166 AD), encountering by chance on the way a blithesome young knight, Cornelius, who becomes a friend. Marius explores Rome in awe, and, \"as a youth of great attainments in Greek letters and philosophy\", is appointed amanuensis to the Emperor Marcus Aurelius. Aurelius's Meditations on Stoicism and on Plato, and the public lectures of the rhetorician Fronto, open Marius' eyes to the narrowness of Epicureanism. Aurelius's indifference, however, to the cruelty to animals in the amphitheatre, and later to the torments inflicted on people there, causes Marius to question the values of Stoicism (end of 'Part the Second'). Disillusioned with Rome and the imperial court which seem \"like some stifling forest of bronze-work, transformed as if by malign enchantment out of the living trees\", puzzled by the source of Cornelius's serenity, still Epicurean by temperament but seeking a more satisfying life-philosophy, Marius makes repeated visits alone to the Campagna and Alban Hills, on one occasion experiencing in the Sabine Hills a sort of spiritual \"epiphany\" on a perfect day of peace and beauty (end of 'Part the Third'). Later he is taken by Cornelius to a household in the Campagna centred on a charismatic young widow, Cecilia, where prevails an atmosphere of peace and love, gradually revealing itself as a new religion with liturgy and rituals that appeal aesthetically and emotionally to Marius. The sense of purposeful community there, set against the persecution of Christians by the authorities and the competing philosophical systems in Rome, contributes to Marius' mood of isolation and emotional failure. Overshadowed by thoughts of mortality he revisits home and pays his respects to the family dead, burying their funerary urns, and sets out again for Rome in Cornelius's company. On the way the two are arrested as part of a sweep of suspected Christians. It emerges that only one of the young men is of this sect, and Marius, unbeknown to Cornelius, makes their captors believe it is he. Cornelius is set free, deceived into thinking that Marius will follow shortly. The latter endures hardship and exhaustion as he journeys captive towards Rome, falls ill, and dying is abandoned by his captors. \"Had there been one to listen just then,\" Pater comments, \"there would have come, from the very depth of his desolation, an eloquent utterance at last, on the irony of men's fates, on the singular accidents of life and death.\"  Marius is tended in his last days by some poor country people, secret believers who take him to be one of their own. Though he has shown little interest in the doctrines of the new faith and dies more or less in ignorance of them, he is nevertheless, Pater implies, \"a soul naturally Christian\" (anima naturaliter christiana ) and he finds peace in his final hours as he reviews his life: \"He would try to fix his mind on all the persons he had loved in life, dead or living, grateful for his love or not. In the bare sense of having loved he seemed to find that on which his soul might 'assuredly rest and depend'. ... And again, as of old, the sense of gratitude seemed to bring with it the sense also of a living person at his side\" (end of 'Part the Fourth').\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfProject Gutenberg's Marius the Epicurean, Volume One, by Walter Horatio Pater\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

Glimpses of such a survival we may\ncatch below the merely artificial attitudes of Latin pastoral poetry;\nin Tibullus especially, who has preserved for us many poetic details of\nold Roman religious usage.\n\n     At mihi contingat patrios celebrare Penates,\n     Reddereque antiquo menstrua thura Lari:\n\n[4] --he prays, with unaffected seriousness.  Something liturgical,\nwith repetitions of a consecrated form of words, is traceable in one of\nhis elegies, as part of the order of a birthday sacrifice.  The hearth,\nfrom a spark of which, as one form of old legend related, the child\nRomulus had been miraculously born, was still indeed an altar; and the\nworthiest sacrifice to the gods the perfect physical sanity of the\nyoung men and women, which the scrupulous ways of that religion of the\nhearth had tended to maintain.  A religion of usages and sentiment\nrather than of facts and belief, and attached to very definite things\nand places--the oak of immemorial age, the rock on the heath fashioned\nby weather as if by some dim human art, the shadowy grove of ilex,\npassing into which one exclaimed involuntarily, in consecrated phrase,\nDeity is in this Place!  Numen Inest!--it was in natural harmony with\nthe temper of a quiet people amid the spectacle of rural life, like\nthat simpler faith between man and man, which Tibullus expressly\nconnects with the period when, with an inexpensive worship, the old\nwooden gods had been still pressed for room in their homely little\nshrines.\n\nAnd about the time when the dying Antoninus Pius ordered his golden\nimage of Fortune to be carried into the chamber of his successor (now\nabout to test the truth of the old Platonic contention, that the world\nwould at last find itself [5] happy, could it detach some reluctant\nphilosophic student from the more desirable life of celestial\ncontemplation, and compel him to rule it), there was a boy living in an\nold country-house, half farm, half villa, who, for himself, recruited\nthat body of antique traditions by a spontaneous force of religious\nveneration such as had originally called them into being.  More than a\ncentury and a half had past since Tibullus had written; but the\nrestoration of religious usages, and their retention where they still\nsurvived, was meantime come to be the fashion through the influence of\nimperial example; and what had been in the main a matter of family\npride with his father, was sustained by a native instinct of devotion\nin the young Marius.  A sense of conscious powers external to\nourselves, pleased or displeased by the right or wrong conduct of every\ncircumstance of daily life--that conscience, of which the old Roman\nreligion was a formal, habitual recognition, was become in him a\npowerful current of feeling and observance.  The old-fashioned, partly\npuritanic awe, the power of which Wordsworth noted and valued so highly\nin a northern peasantry, had its counterpart in the feeling of the\nRoman lad, as he passed the spot, \"touched of heaven,\" where the\nlightning had struck dead an aged labourer in the field: an upright\nstone, still with mouldering garlands about it, marked the place.  He\nbrought to that system of symbolic [6] usages, and they in turn\ndeveloped in him further, a great seriousness--an impressibility to the\nsacredness of time, of life and its events, and the circumstances of\nfamily fellowship; of such gifts to men as fire, water, the earth, from\nlabour on which they live, really understood by him as gifts--a sense\nof religious responsibility in the reception of them.  It was a\nreligion for the most part of fear, of multitudinous scruples, of a\nyear-long burden of forms; yet rarely (on clear summer mornings, for\ninstance) the thought of those heavenly powers afforded a welcome\nchannel for the almost stifling sense of health and delight in him, and\nrelieved it as gratitude to the gods.\n\nThe day of the \"little\" or private Ambarvalia was come, to be\ncelebrated by a single family for the welfare of all belonging to it,\nas the great college of the Arval Brothers officiated at Rome in the\ninterest of the whole state.  At the appointed time all work ceases;\nthe instruments of labour lie untouched, hung with wreaths of flowers,\nwhile masters and servants together go in solemn procession along the\ndry paths of vineyard and cornfield, conducting the victims whose blood\nis presently to be shed for the purification from all natural or\nsupernatural taint of the lands they have \"gone about.\" The old Latin\nwords of the liturgy, to be said as the procession moved on its way,\nthough their precise meaning was long [7] since become unintelligible,\nwere recited from an ancient illuminated roll, kept in the painted\nchest in the hall, together with the family records.  Early on that day\nthe girls of the farm had been busy in the great portico, filling large\nbaskets with flowers plucked short from branches of apple and cherry,\nthen in spacious bloom, to strew before the quaint images of the\ngods--Ceres and Bacchus and the yet more mysterious Dea Dia--as they\npassed through the fields, carried in their little houses on the\nshoulders of white-clad youths, who were understood to proceed to this\noffice in perfect temperance, as pure in soul and body as the air they\nbreathed in the firm weather of that early summer-time.  The clean\nlustral water and the full incense-box were carried after them.  The\naltars were gay with garlands of wool and the more sumptuous sort of\nblossom and green herbs to be thrown into the sacrificial fire,\nfresh-gathered this morning from a particular plot in the old garden,\nset apart for the purpose.  Just then the young leaves were almost as\nfragrant as flowers, and the scent of the bean-fields mingled\npleasantly with the cloud of incense.  But for the monotonous\nintonation of the liturgy by the priests, clad in their strange, stiff,\nantique vestments, and bearing ears of green corn upon their heads,\nsecured by flowing bands of white, the procession moved in absolute\nstillness, all persons, even the children, abstaining from [8] speech\nafter the utterance of the pontifical formula, Favete\nlinguis!--Silence!  Propitious Silence!--lest any words save those\nproper to the occasion should hinder the religious efficacy of the rite.\n\nWith the lad Marius, who, as the head of his house, took a leading part\nin the ceremonies of the day, there was a devout effort to complete\nthis impressive outward silence by that inward tacitness of mind,\nesteemed so important by religious Romans in the performance of these\nsacred functions.  To him the sustained stillness without seemed really\nbut to be waiting upon that interior, mental condition of preparation\nor expectancy, for which he was just then intently striving.  The\npersons about him, certainly, had never been challenged by those\nprayers and ceremonies to any ponderings on the divine nature: they\nconceived them rather to be the appointed means of setting such\ntroublesome movements at rest.  By them, \"the religion of Numa,\" so\nstaid, ideal and comely, the object of so much jealous conservatism,\nthough of direct service as lending sanction to a sort of high\nscrupulosity, especially in the chief points of domestic conduct, was\nmainly prized as being, through its hereditary character, something\nlike a personal distinction--as contributing, among the other\naccessories of an ancient house, to the production of that aristocratic\natmosphere which separated them from newly-made people.  But [9] in the\nyoung Marius, the very absence from those venerable usages of all\ndefinite history and dogmatic interpretation, had already awakened much\nspeculative activity; and to-day, starting from the actual details of\nthe divine service, some very lively surmises, though scarcely distinct\nenough to be thoughts, were moving backwards and forwards in his mind,\nas the stirring wind had done all day among the trees, and were like\nthe passing of some mysterious influence over all the elements of his\nnature and experience.  One thing only distracted him--a certain pity\nat the bottom of his heart, and almost on his lips, for the sacrificial\nvictims and their looks of terror, rising almost to disgust at the\ncentral act of the sacrifice itself, a piece of everyday butcher's\nwork, such as we decorously hide out of sight; though some then present\ncertainly displayed a frank curiosity in the spectacle thus permitted\nthem on a religious pretext.  The old sculptors of the great procession\non the frieze of the Parthenon at Athens, have delineated the placid\nheads of the victims led in it to sacrifice, with a perfect feeling for\nanimals in forcible contrast with any indifference as to their\nsufferings.  It was this contrast that distracted Marius now in the\nblessing of his fields, and qualified his devout absorption upon the\nscrupulous fulfilment of all the details of the ceremonial, as the\nprocession approached the altars.\n\n[10] The names of that great populace of \"little gods,\" dear to the\nRoman home, which the pontiffs had placed on the sacred list of the\nIndigitamenta, to be invoked, because they can help, on special\noccasions, were not forgotten in the long litany--Vatican who causes\nthe infant to utter his first cry, Fabulinus who prompts his first\nword, Cuba who keeps him quiet in his cot, Domiduca especially, for\nwhom Marius had through life a particular memory and devotion, the\ngoddess who watches over one's safe coming home.  The urns of the dead\nin the family chapel received their due service.  They also were now\nbecome something divine, a goodly company of friendly and protecting\nspirits, encamped about the place of their former abode--above all\nothers, the father, dead ten years before, of whom, remembering but a\ntall, grave figure above him in early childhood, Marius habitually\nthought as a genius a little cold and severe.\n\n     Candidus insuetum miratur limen Olympi,\n     Sub pedibusque videt nubes et sidera.--\n\nPerhaps!--but certainly needs his altar here below, and garlands to-day\nupon his urn.  But the dead genii were satisfied with little--a few\nviolets, a cake dipped in wine, or a morsel of honeycomb.  Daily, from\nthe time when his childish footsteps were still uncertain, had Marius\ntaken them their portion of the family meal, at the second course,\namidst the silence [11] of the company.  They loved those who brought\nthem their sustenance; but, deprived of these services, would be heard\nwandering through the house, crying sorrowfully in the stillness of the\nnight.\n\nAnd those simple gifts, like other objects as trivial--bread, oil,\nwine, milk--had regained for him, by their use in such religious\nservice, that poetic and as it were moral significance, which surely\nbelongs to all the means of daily life, could we but break through the\nveil of our familiarity with things by no means vulgar in themselves. A\nhymn followed, while the whole assembly stood with veiled faces.  The\nfire rose up readily from the altars, in clean, bright flame--a\nfavourable omen, making it a duty to render the mirth of the evening\ncomplete.  Old wine was poured out freely for the servants at supper in\nthe great kitchen, where they had worked in the imperfect light through\nthe long evenings of winter.  The young Marius himself took but a very\nsober part in the noisy feasting.  A devout, regretful after-taste of\nwhat had been really beautiful in the ritual he had accomplished took\nhim early away, that he might the better recall in reverie all the\ncircumstances of the celebration of the day.  As he sank into a sleep,\npleasant with all the influences of long hours in the open air, he\nseemed still to be moving in procession through the fields, with a kind\nof pleasurable awe.  That feeling was still upon him as he [12] awoke\namid the beating of violent rain on the shutters, in the first storm of\nthe season.  The thunder which startled him from sleep seemed to make\nthe solitude of his chamber almost painfully complete, as if the\nnearness of those angry clouds shut him up in a close place alone in\nthe world.  Then he thought of the sort of protection which that day's\nceremonies assured.  To procure an agreement with the gods--Pacem\ndeorum exposcere: that was the meaning of what they had all day been\nbusy upon.  In a faith, sincere but half-suspicious, he would fain have\nthose Powers at least not against him.  His own nearer household gods\nwere all around his bed.  The spell of his religion as a part of the\nvery essence of home, its intimacy, its dignity and security, was\nforcible at that moment; only, it seemed to involve certain heavy\ndemands upon him.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II: WHITE-NIGHTS\n\n[13] To an instinctive seriousness, the material abode in which the\nchildhood of Marius was passed had largely added.  Nothing, you felt,\nas you first caught sight of that coy, retired place,--surely nothing\ncould happen there, without its full accompaniment of thought or\nreverie.  White-nights! so you might interpret its old Latin name.*\n\"The red rose came first,\" says a quaint German mystic, speaking of\n\"the mystery of so-called white things,\" as being \"ever an\nafter-thought--the doubles, or seconds, of real things, and themselves\nbut half-real, half-material--the white queen, the white witch, the\nwhite mass, which, as the black mass is a travesty of the true mass\nturned to evil by horrible old witches, is celebrated by young\ncandidates for the priesthood with an unconsecrated host, by way of\nrehearsal.\" So, white-nights, I suppose, after something like the same\nanalogy, should be [14] nights not of quite blank forgetfulness, but\npassed in continuous dreaming, only half veiled by sleep.  Certainly\nthe place was, in such case, true to its fanciful name in this, that\nyou might very well conceive, in face of it, that dreaming even in the\ndaytime might come to much there.\n\nThe young Marius represented an ancient family whose estate had come\ndown to him much curtailed through the extravagance of a certain\nMarcellus two generations before, a favourite in his day of the\nfashionable world at Rome, where he had at least spent his substance\nwith a correctness of taste Marius might seem to have inherited from\nhim; as he was believed also to resemble him in a singularly pleasant\nsmile, consistent however, in the younger face, with some degree of\nsombre expression when the mind within was but slightly moved.\n\nAs the means of life decreased, the farm had crept nearer and nearer to\nthe dwelling-house, about which there was therefore a trace of workday\nnegligence or homeliness, not without its picturesque charm for some,\nfor the young master himself among them.  The more observant passer-by\nwould note, curious as to the inmates, a certain amount of dainty care\namid that neglect, as if it came in part, perhaps, from a reluctance to\ndisturb old associations.  It was significant of the national\ncharacter, that a sort of elegant gentleman farming, as we say, had\nbeen much affected by some of the most cultivated [15] Romans.  But it\nbecame something more than an elegant diversion, something of a serious\nbusiness, with the household of Marius; and his actual interest in the\ncultivation of the earth and the care of flocks had brought him, at\nleast, intimately near to those elementary conditions of life, a\nreverence for which, the great Roman poet, as he has shown by his own\nhalf-mystic pre-occupation with them, held to be the ground of\nprimitive Roman religion, as of primitive morals.  But then, farm-life\nin Italy, including the culture of the olive and the vine, has a grace\nof its own, and might well contribute to the production of an ideal\ndignity of character, like that of nature itself in this gifted region.\nVulgarity seemed impossible.  The place, though impoverished, was still\ndeservedly dear, full of venerable memories, and with a living\nsweetness of its own for to-day.\n\nTo hold by such ceremonial traditions had been a part of the struggling\nfamily pride of the lad's father, to which the example of the head of\nthe state, old Antoninus Pius--an example to be still further enforced\nby his successor--had given a fresh though perhaps somewhat artificial\npopularity.  It had been consistent with many another homely and\nold-fashioned trait in him, not to undervalue the charm of\nexclusiveness and immemorial authority, which membership in a local\npriestly college, hereditary in his house, conferred upon him.  To set\na real value on [16] these things was but one element in that pious\nconcern for his home and all that belonged to it, which, as Marius\nafterwards discovered, had been a strong motive with his father.  The\nancient hymn--Fana Novella!--was still sung by his people, as the new\nmoon grew bright in the west, and even their wild custom of leaping\nthrough heaps of blazing straw on a certain night in summer was not\ndiscouraged.  The privilege of augury itself, according to tradition,\nhad at one time belonged to his race; and if you can imagine how, once\nin a way, an impressible boy might have an inkling, an inward mystic\nintimation, of the meaning and consequences of all that, what was\nimplied in it becoming explicit for him, you conceive aright the mind\nof Marius, in whose house the auspices were still carefully consulted\nbefore every undertaking of moment.\n\nThe devotion of the father then had handed on loyally--and that is all\nmany not unimportant persons ever find to do--a certain tradition of\nlife, which came to mean much for the young Marius.  The feeling with\nwhich he thought of his dead father was almost exclusively that of awe;\nthough crossed at times by a not unpleasant sense of liberty, as he\ncould but confess to himself, pondering, in the actual absence of so\nweighty and continual a restraint, upon the arbitrary power which Roman\nreligion and Roman law gave to the parent over the son. [17] On the\npart of his mother, on the other hand, entertaining the husband's\nmemory, there was a sustained freshness of regret, together with the\nrecognition, as Marius fancied, of some costly self-sacrifice to be\ncredited to the dead.  The life of the widow, languid and shadowy\nenough but for the poignancy of that regret, was like one long service\nto the departed soul; its many annual observances centering about the\nfuneral urn--a tiny, delicately carved marble house, still white and\nfair, in the family-chapel, wreathed always with the richest flowers\nfrom the garden.  To the dead, in fact, was conceded in such places a\nsomewhat closer neighbourhood to the old homes they were thought still\nto protect, than is usual with us, or was usual in Rome itself--a\ncloseness which the living welcomed, so diverse are the ways of our\nhuman sentiment, and in which the more wealthy, at least in the\ncountry, might indulge themselves.  All this Marius followed with a\ndevout interest, sincerely touched and awed by his mother's sorrow.\nAfter the deification of the emperors, we are told, it was considered\nimpious so much as to use any coarse expression in the presence of\ntheir images.  To Marius the whole of life seemed full of sacred\npresences, demanding of him a similar collectedness.  The severe and\narchaic religion of the villa, as he conceived it, begot in him a sort\nof devout circumspection lest he should fall short at any point of the\ndemand upon him of anything [18] in which deity was concerned.  He must\nsatisfy with a kind of sacred equity, he must be very cautious lest he\nbe found wanting to, the claims of others, in their joys and\ncalamities--the happiness which deity sanctioned, or the blows in which\nit made itself felt. And from habit, this feeling of a responsibility\ntowards the world of men and things, towards a claim for due sentiment\nconcerning them on his side, came to be a part of his nature not to be\nput off.  It kept him serious and dignified amid the Epicurean\nspeculations which in after years much engrossed him, and when he had\nlearned to think of all religions as indifferent, serious amid many\nfopperies and through many languid days, and made him anticipate all\nhis life long as a thing towards which he must carefully train himself,\nsome great occasion of self-devotion, such as really came, that should\nconsecrate his life, and, it might be, its memory with others, as the\nearly Christian looked forward to martyrdom at the end of his course,\nas a seal of worth upon it.\n\nThe traveller, descending from the slopes of Luna, even as he got his\nfirst view of the Port-of-Venus, would pause by the way, to read the\nface, as it were, of so beautiful a dwelling-place, lying away from the\nwhite road, at the point where it began to decline somewhat steeply to\nthe marsh-land below.  The building of pale red and yellow marble,\nmellowed by age, which he saw beyond the gates, was indeed but the\nexquisite [19] fragment of a once large and sumptuous villa. Two\ncenturies of the play of the sea-wind were in the velvet of the mosses\nwhich lay along its inaccessible ledges and angles.  Here and there the\nmarble plates had slipped from their places, where the delicate weeds\nhad forced their way.  The graceful wildness which prevailed in garden\nand farm gave place to a singular nicety about the actual habitation,\nand a still more scrupulous sweetness and order reigned within.  The\nold Roman architects seem to have well understood the decorative value\nof the floor--the real economy there was, in the production of rich\ninterior effect, of a somewhat lavish expenditure upon the surface they\ntrod on.  The pavement of the hall had lost something of its evenness;\nbut, though a little rough to the foot, polished and cared for like a\npiece of silver, looked, as mosaic-work is apt to do, its best in old\nage.  Most noticeable among the ancestral masks, each in its little\ncedarn chest below the cornice, was that of the wasteful but elegant\nMarcellus, with the quaint resemblance in its yellow waxen features to\nMarius, just then so full of animation and country colour.  A chamber,\ncurved ingeniously into oval form, which he had added to the mansion,\nstill contained his collection of works of art; above all, that head of\nMedusa, for which the villa was famous.  The spoilers of one of the old\nGreek towns on the coast had flung away or lost the [20] thing, as it\nseemed, in some rapid flight across the river below, from the sands of\nwhich it was drawn up in a fisherman's net, with the fine golden\nlaminae still clinging here and there to the bronze.  It was Marcellus\nalso who had contrived the prospect-tower of two storeys with the white\npigeon-house above, so characteristic of the place. The little glazed\nwindows in the uppermost chamber framed each its dainty landscape--the\npallid crags of Carrara, like wildly twisted snow-drifts above the\npurple heath; the distant harbour with its freight of white marble\ngoing to sea; the lighthouse temple of Venus Speciosa on its dark\nheadland, amid the long-drawn curves of white breakers.  Even on summer\nnights the air there had always a motion in it, and drove the scent of\nthe new-mown hay along all the passages of the house.\n\nSomething pensive, spell-bound, and but half real, something cloistral\nor monastic, as we should say, united to this exquisite order, made the\nwhole place seem to Marius, as it were, sacellum, the peculiar\nsanctuary, of his mother, who, still in real widowhood, provided the\ndeceased Marius the elder with that secondary sort of life which we can\ngive to the dead, in our intensely realised memory of them--the\n\"subjective immortality,\" to use a modern phrase, for which many a\nRoman epitaph cries out plaintively to widow or sister or daughter,\nstill in the land of the living.  Certainly, if any [21] such\nconsiderations regarding them do reach the shadowy people, he enjoyed\nthat secondary existence, that warm place still left, in thought at\nleast, beside the living, the desire for which is actually, in various\nforms, so great a motive with most of us.  And Marius the younger, even\nthus early, came to think of women's tears, of women's hands to lay one\nto rest, in death as in the sleep of childhood, as a sort of natural\nwant.  The soft lines of the white hands and face, set among the many\nfolds of the veil and stole of the Roman widow, busy upon her\nneedlework, or with music sometimes, defined themselves for him as the\ntypical expression of maternity. Helping her with her white and purple\nwools, and caring for her musical instruments, he won, as if from the\nhandling of such things, an urbane and feminine refinement, qualifying\nduly his country-grown habits--the sense of a certain delicate\nblandness, which he relished, above all, on returning to the \"chapel\"\nof his mother, after long days of open-air exercise, in winter or\nstormy summer.  For poetic souls in old Italy felt, hardly less\nstrongly than the English, the pleasures of winter, of the hearth, with\nthe very dead warm in its generous heat, keeping the young myrtles in\nflower, though the hail is beating hard without.  One important\nprinciple, of fruit afterwards in his Roman life, that relish for the\ncountry fixed deeply in him; in the winters especially, when the\nsufferings of [22] the animal world became so palpable even to the\nleast observant.  It fixed in him a sympathy for all creatures, for the\nalmost human troubles and sicknesses of the flocks, for instance.  It\nwas a feeling which had in it something of religious veneration for\nlife as such--for that mysterious essence which man is powerless to\ncreate in even the feeblest degree.  One by one, at the desire of his\nmother, the lad broke down his cherished traps and springes for the\nhungry wild birds on the salt marsh.  A white bird, she told him once,\nlooking at him gravely, a bird which he must carry in his bosom across\na crowded public place--his own soul was like that!  Would it reach the\nhands of his good genius on the opposite side, unruffled and unsoiled?\nAnd as his mother became to him the very type of maternity in things,\nits unfailing pity and protectiveness, and maternity itself the central\ntype of all love;--so, that beautiful dwelling-place lent the reality\nof concrete outline to a peculiar ideal of home, which throughout the\nrest of his life he seemed, amid many distractions of spirit, to be\never seeking to regain.\n\nAnd a certain vague fear of evil, constitutional in him, enhanced still\nfurther this sentiment of home as a place of tried security. His\nreligion, that old Italian religion, in contrast with the really\nlight-hearted religion of Greece, had its deep undercurrent of gloom,\nits sad, haunting imageries, not exclusively confined to the walls [23]\nof Etruscan tombs.  The function of the conscience, not always as the\nprompter of gratitude for benefits received, but oftenest as his\naccuser before those angry heavenly masters, had a large part in it;\nand the sense of some unexplored evil, ever dogging his footsteps, made\nhim oddly suspicious of particular places and persons.  Though his\nliking for animals was so strong, yet one fierce day in early summer,\nas he walked along a narrow road, he had seen the snakes breeding, and\never afterwards avoided that place and its ugly associations, for there\nwas something in the incident which made food distasteful and his sleep\nuneasy for many days afterwards.  The memory of it however had almost\npassed away, when at the corner of a street in Pisa, he came upon an\nAfrican showman exhibiting a great serpent: once more, as the reptile\nwrithed, the former painful impression revived: it was like a peep into\nthe lower side of the real world, and again for many days took all\nsweetness from food and sleep.  He wondered at himself indeed, trying\nto puzzle out the secret of that repugnance, having no particular dread\nof a snake's bite, like one of his companions, who had put his hand\ninto the mouth of an old garden-god and roused there a sluggish viper.\nA kind of pity even mingled with his aversion, and he could hardly have\nkilled or injured the animals, which seemed already to suffer by the\nvery circumstance of their life, being what they [24] were.  It was\nsomething like a fear of the supernatural, or perhaps rather a moral\nfeeling, for the face of a great serpent, with no grace of fur or\nfeathers, so different from quadruped or bird, has a sort of humanity\nof aspect in its spotted and clouded nakedness.  There was a humanity,\ndusty and sordid and as if far gone in corruption, in the sluggish\ncoil, as it awoke suddenly into one metallic spring of pure enmity\nagainst him.  Long afterwards, when it happened that at Rome he saw, a\nsecond time, a showman with his serpents, he remembered the night which\nhad then followed, thinking, in Saint Augustine's vein, on the real\ngreatness of those little troubles of children, of which older people\nmake light; but with a sudden gratitude also, as he reflected how\nrichly possessed his life had actually been by beautiful aspects and\nimageries, seeing how greatly what was repugnant to the eye disturbed\nhis peace.\n\nThus the boyhood of Marius passed; on the whole, more given to\ncontemplation than to action.  Less prosperous in fortune than at an\nearlier day there had been reason to expect, and animating his\nsolitude, as he read eagerly and intelligently, with the traditions of\nthe past, already he lived much in the realm of the imagination, and\nbecame betimes, as he was to continue all through life, something of an\nidealist, constructing the world for himself in great measure from\nwithin, by the exercise [25] of meditative power.  A vein of subjective\nphilosophy, with the individual for its standard of all things, there\nwould be always in his intellectual scheme of the world and of conduct,\nwith a certain incapacity wholly to accept other men's valuations.  And\nthe generation of this peculiar element in his temper he could trace up\nto the days when his life had been so like the reading of a romance to\nhim.  Had the Romans a word for unworldly?  The beautiful word\numbratilis perhaps comes nearest to it; and, with that precise sense,\nmight describe the spirit in which he prepared himself for the\nsacerdotal function hereditary in his family--the sort of mystic\nenjoyment he had in the abstinence, the strenuous self-control and\nasc\u00c3\u00aasis, which such preparation involved. Like the young Ion in the\nbeautiful opening of the play of Euripides, who every morning sweeps\nthe temple floor with such a fund of cheerfulness in his service, he\nwas apt to be happy in sacred places, with a susceptibility to their\npeculiar influences which he never outgrew; so that often in\nafter-times, quite unexpectedly, this feeling would revive in him with\nundiminished freshness.  That first, early, boyish ideal of priesthood,\nthe sense of dedication, survived through all the distractions of the\nworld, and when all thought of such vocation had finally passed from\nhim, as a ministry, in spirit at least, towards a sort of hieratic\nbeauty and order in the conduct of life.\n\n[26] And now what relieved in part this over-tension of soul was the\nlad's pleasure in the country and the open air; above all, the ramble\nto the coast, over the marsh with its dwarf roses and wild lavender,\nand delightful signs, one after another--the abandoned boat, the ruined\nflood-gates, the flock of wild birds--that one was approaching the sea;\nthe long summer-day of idleness among its vague scents and sounds.  And\nit was characteristic of him that he relished especially the grave,\nsubdued, northern notes in all that--the charm of the French or English\nnotes, as we might term them--in the luxuriant Italian landscape.\n\nNOTES\n\n13. *Ad Vigilias Albas.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III: CHANGE OF AIR\n\nDilexi decorem domus tuae.\n\n[27] THAT almost morbid religious idealism, and his healthful love of\nthe country, were both alike developed by the circumstances of a\njourney, which happened about this time, when Marius was taken to a\ncertain temple of Aesculapius, among the hills of Etruria, as was then\nusual in such cases, for the cure of some boyish sickness.  The\nreligion of Aesculapius, though borrowed from Greece, had been\nnaturalised in Rome in the old republican times; but had reached under\nthe Antonines the height of its popularity throughout the Roman world.\nThat was an age of valetudinarians, in many instances of imaginary\nones; but below its various crazes concerning health and disease,\nlargely multiplied a few years after the time of which I am speaking by\nthe miseries of a great pestilence, lay a valuable, because partly\npracticable, belief that all the maladies of the soul might be reached\nthrough the subtle gateways of the body.\n\n[28] Salus, salvation, for the Romans, had come to mean bodily sanity.\nThe religion of the god of bodily health, Salvator, as they called him\nabsolutely, had a chance just then of becoming the one religion; that\nmild and philanthropic son of Apollo surviving, or absorbing, all other\npagan godhead.  The apparatus of the medical art, the salutary mineral\nor herb, diet or abstinence, and all the varieties of the bath, came to\nhave a kind of sacramental character, so deep was the feeling, in more\nserious minds, of a moral or spiritual profit in physical health,\nbeyond the obvious bodily advantages one had of it; the body becoming\ntruly, in that case, but a quiet handmaid of the soul.  The priesthood\nor \"family\" of Aesculapius, a vast college, believed to be in\npossession of certain precious medical secrets, came nearest perhaps,\nof all the institutions of the pagan world, to the Christian\npriesthood; the temples of the god, rich in some instances with the\naccumulated thank-offerings of centuries of a tasteful devotion, being\nreally also a kind of hospitals for the sick, administered in a full\nconviction of the religiousness, the refined and sacred happiness, of a\nlife spent in the relieving of pain.\n\nElements of a really experimental and progressive knowledge there were\ndoubtless amid this devout enthusiasm, bent so faithfully on the\nreception of health as a direct gift from God; but for the most part\nhis care was held to take [29] effect through a machinery easily\ncapable of misuse for purposes of religious fraud.  Through dreams,\nabove all, inspired by Aesculapius himself, information as to the cause\nand cure of a malady was supposed to come to the sufferer, in a belief\nbased on the truth that dreams do sometimes, for those who watch them\ncarefully, give many hints concerning the conditions of the body--those\nlatent weak points at which disease or death may most easily break into\nit.  In the time of Marcus Aurelius these medical dreams had become\nmore than ever a fashionable caprice.  Aristeides, the \"Orator,\" a man\nof undoubted intellectual power, has devoted six discourses to their\ninterpretation; the really scientific Galen has recorded how\nbeneficently they had intervened in his own case, at certain\nturning-points of life; and a belief in them was one of the frailties\nof the wise emperor himself.  Partly for the sake of these dreams,\nliving ministers of the god, more likely to come to one in his actual\ndwelling-place than elsewhere, it was almost a necessity that the\npatient should sleep one or more nights within the precincts of a\ntemple consecrated to his service, during which time he must observe\ncertain rules prescribed by the priests.\n\nFor this purpose, after devoutly saluting the Lares, as was customary\nbefore starting on a journey, Marius set forth one summer morning on\nhis way to the famous temple which lay [30] among the hills beyond the\nvalley of the Arnus.  It was his greatest adventure hitherto; and he\nhad much pleasure in all its details, in spite of his feverishness.\nStarting early, under the guidance of an old serving-man who drove the\nmules, with his wife who took all that was needful for their\nrefreshment on the way and for the offering at the shrine, they went,\nunder the genial heat, halting now and then to pluck certain flowers\nseen for the first time on these high places, upwards, through a long\nday of sunshine, while cliffs and woods sank gradually below their\npath.  The evening came as they passed along a steep white road with\nmany windings among the pines, and it was night when they reached the\ntemple, the lights of which shone out upon them pausing before the\ngates of the sacred enclosure, while Marius became alive to a singular\npurity in the air.  A rippling of water about the place was the only\nthing audible, as they waited till two priestly figures, speaking Greek\nto one another, admitted them into a large, white-walled and clearly\nlighted guest-chamber, in which, while he partook of a simple but\nwholesomely prepared supper, Marius still seemed to feel pleasantly the\nheight they had attained to among the hills.\n\nThe agreeable sense of all this was spoiled by one thing only, his old\nfear of serpents; for it was under the form of a serpent that\nAesculapius [31] had come to Rome, and the last definite thought of his\nweary head before he fell asleep had been a dread either that the god\nmight appear, as he was said sometimes to do, under this hideous\naspect, or perhaps one of those great sallow-hued snakes themselves,\nkept in the sacred place, as he had also heard was usual.\n\nAnd after an hour's feverish dreaming he awoke--with a cry, it would\nseem, for some one had entered the room bearing a light.  The footsteps\nof the youthful figure which approached and sat by his bedside were\ncertainly real.  Ever afterwards, when the thought arose in his mind of\nsome unhoped-for but entire relief from distress, like blue sky in a\nstorm at sea, would come back the memory of that gracious countenance\nwhich, amid all the kindness of its gaze, had yet a certain air of\npredominance over him, so that he seemed now for the first time to have\nfound the master of his spirit.  It would have been sweet to be the\nservant of him who now sat beside him speaking.\n\nHe caught a lesson from what was then said, still somewhat beyond his\nyears, a lesson in the skilled cultivation of life, of experience, of\nopportunity, which seemed to be the aim of the young priest's\nrecommendations.  The sum of them, through various forgotten intervals\nof argument, as might really have happened in a [32] dream, was the\nprecept, repeated many times under slightly varied aspects, of a\ndiligent promotion of the capacity of the eye, inasmuch as in the eye\nwould lie for him the determining influence of life: he was of the\nnumber of those who, in the words of a poet who came long after, must\nbe \"made perfect by the love of visible beauty.\"  The discourse was\nconceived from the point of view of a theory Marius found afterwards in\nPlato's Phaedrus, which supposes men's spirits susceptible to certain\ninfluences, diffused, after the manner of streams or currents, by fair\nthings or persons visibly present--green fields, for instance, or\nchildren's faces--into the air around them, acting, in the case of some\npeculiar natures, like potent material essences, and conforming the\nseer to themselves as with some cunning physical necessity.  This\ntheory,* in itself so fantastic, had however determined in a range of\nmethodical suggestions, altogether quaint here and there from their\ncircumstantial minuteness.  And throughout, the possibility of some\nvision, as of a new city coming down \"like a bride out of heaven,\" a\nvision still indeed, it might seem, a long way off, but to be granted\nperhaps one day to the eyes thus trained, was presented as the motive\nof this laboriously practical direction.\n\n\"If thou wouldst have all about thee like the colours of some fresh\npicture, in a clear [33] light,\" so the discourse recommenced after a\npause, \"be temperate in thy religious notions, in love, in wine, in all\nthings, and of a peaceful heart with thy fellows.\"  To keep the eye\nclear by a sort of exquisite personal alacrity and cleanliness,\nextending even to his dwelling-place; to discriminate, ever more and\nmore fastidiously, select form and colour in things from what was less\nselect; to meditate much on beautiful visible objects, on objects, more\nespecially, connected with the period of youth--on children at play in\nthe morning, the trees in early spring, on young animals, on the\nfashions and amusements of young men; to keep ever by him if it were\nbut a single choice flower, a graceful animal or sea-shell, as a token\nand representative of the whole kingdom of such things; to avoid\njealously, in his way through the world, everything repugnant to sight;\nand, should any circumstance tempt him to a general converse in the\nrange of such objects, to disentangle himself from that circumstance at\nany cost of place, money, or opportunity; such were in brief outline\nthe duties recognised, the rights demanded, in this new formula of\nlife.  And it was delivered with conviction; as if the speaker verily\nsaw into the recesses of the mental and physical being of the listener,\nwhile his own expression of perfect temperance had in it a fascinating\npower--the merely negative element of purity, the mere freedom from\ntaint or flaw, in exercise [34] as a positive influence.  Long\nafterwards, when Marius read the Charmides--that other dialogue of\nPlato, into which he seems to have expressed the very genius of old\nGreek temperance--the image of this speaker came back vividly before\nhim, to take the chief part in the conversation.\n\nIt was as a weighty sanction of such temperance, in almost visible\nsymbolism (an outward imagery identifying itself with unseen\nmoralities) that the memory of that night's double experience, the\ndream of the great sallow snake and the utterance of the young priest,\nalways returned to him, and the contrast therein involved made him\nrevolt with unfaltering instinct from the bare thought of an excess in\nsleep, or diet, or even in matters of taste, still more from any excess\nof a coarser kind.\n\nWhen he awoke again, still in the exceeding freshness he had felt on\nhis arrival, and now in full sunlight, it was as if his sickness had\nreally departed with the terror of the night: a confusion had passed\nfrom the brain, a painful dryness from his hands.  Simply to be alive\nand there was a delight; and as he bathed in the fresh water set ready\nfor his use, the air of the room about him seemed like pure gold, the\nvery shadows rich with colour.  Summoned at length by one of the\nwhite-robed brethren, he went out to walk in the temple garden.  At a\ndistance, on either side, his guide pointed out to him the Houses of\nBirth and Death, erected for the reception [35] respectively of women\nabout to become mothers, and of persons about to die; neither of those\nincidents being allowed to defile, as was thought, the actual precincts\nof the shrine.  His visitor of the previous night he saw nowhere again.\nBut among the official ministers of the place there was one, already\nmarked as of great celebrity, whom Marius saw often in later days at\nRome, the physician Galen, now about thirty years old.  He was\nstanding, the hood partly drawn over his face, beside the holy well, as\nMarius and his guide approached it.\n\nThis famous well or conduit, primary cause of the temple and its\nsurrounding institutions, was supplied by the water of a spring flowing\ndirectly out of the rocky foundations of the shrine.  From the rim of\nits basin rose a circle of trim columns to support a cupola of singular\nlightness and grace, itself full of reflected light from the rippling\nsurface, through which might be traced the wavy figure-work of the\nmarble lining below as the stream of water rushed in.  Legend told of a\nvisit of Aesculapius to this place, earlier and happier than his first\ncoming to Rome: an inscription around the cupola recorded it in letters\nof gold.  \"Being come unto this place the son of God loved it\nexceedingly:\"--Huc profectus filius Dei maxime amavit hunc locum;--and\nit was then that that most intimately human of the gods had given men\nthe well, with all its salutary properties.  The [36] element itself\nwhen received into the mouth, in consequence of its entire freedom from\nadhering organic matter, was more like a draught of wonderfully pure\nair than water; and after tasting, Marius was told many mysterious\ncircumstances concerning it, by one and another of the bystanders:--he\nwho drank often thereof might well think he had tasted of the Homeric\nlotus, so great became his desire to remain always on that spot:\ncarried to other places, it was almost indefinitely conservative of its\nfine qualities: nay! a few drops of it would amend other water; and it\nflowed not only with unvarying abundance but with a volume so oddly\nrhythmical that the well stood always full to the brim, whatever\nquantity might be drawn from it, seeming to answer with strange\nalacrity of service to human needs, like a true creature and pupil of\nthe philanthropic god.  Certainly the little crowd around seemed to\nfind singular refreshment in gazing on it.  The whole place appeared\nsensibly influenced by the amiable and healthful spirit of the thing.\nAll the objects of the country were there at their freshest.  In the\ngreat park-like enclosure for the maintenance of the sacred animals\noffered by the convalescent, grass and trees were allowed to grow with\na kind of graceful wildness; otherwise, all was wonderfully nice.  And\nthat freshness seemed to have something moral in its influence, as if\nit acted upon the body and the merely bodily [37] powers of\napprehension, through the intelligence; and to the end of his visit\nMarius saw no more serpents.\n\nA lad was just then drawing water for ritual uses, and Marius followed\nhim as he returned from the well, more and more impressed by the\nreligiousness of all he saw, on his way through a long cloister or\ncorridor, the walls well-nigh hidden under votive inscriptions\nrecording favours from the son of Apollo, and with a distant fragrance\nof incense in the air, explained when he turned aside through an open\ndoorway into the temple itself.  His heart bounded as the refined and\ndainty magnificence of the place came upon him suddenly, in the flood\nof early sunshine, with the ceremonial lights burning here and there,\nand withal a singular expression of sacred order, a surprising\ncleanliness and simplicity.  Certain priests, men whose countenances\nbore a deep impression of cultivated mind, each with his little group\nof assistants, were gliding round silently to perform their morning\nsalutation to the god, raising the closed thumb and finger of the right\nhand with a kiss in the air, as they came and went on their sacred\nbusiness, bearing their frankincense and lustral water.  Around the\nwalls, at such a level that the worshippers might read, as in a book,\nthe story of the god and his sons, the brotherhood of the Asclepiadae,\nran a series of imageries, in low relief, their delicate light and\nshade being [38] heightened, here and there, with gold.  Fullest of\ninspired and sacred expression, as if in this place the chisel of the\nartist had indeed dealt not with marble but with the very breath of\nfeeling and thought, was the scene in which the earliest generation of\nthe sons of Aesculapius were transformed into healing dreams; for\n\"grown now too glorious to abide longer among men, by the aid of their\nsire they put away their mortal bodies, and came into another country,\nyet not indeed into Elysium nor into the Islands of the Blest.  But\nbeing made like to the immortal gods, they began to pass about through\nthe world, changed thus far from their first form that they appear\neternally young, as many persons have seen them in many\nplaces--ministers and heralds of their father, passing to and fro over\nthe earth, like gliding stars. Which thing is, indeed, the most\nwonderful concerning them!\"  And in this scene, as throughout the\nseries, with all its crowded personages, Marius noted on the carved\nfaces the same peculiar union of unction, almost of hilarity, with a\ncertain self-possession and reserve, which was conspicuous in the\nliving ministrants around him.\n\nIn the central space, upon a pillar or pedestal, hung, ex voto, with\nthe richest personal ornaments, stood the image of Aesculapius himself,\nsurrounded by choice flowering plants.  It presented the type, still\nwith something of the [39] severity of the earlier art of Greece about\nit, not of an aged and crafty physician, but of a youth, earnest and\nstrong of aspect, carrying an ampulla or bottle in one hand, and in the\nother a traveller's staff, a pilgrim among his pilgrim worshippers; and\none of the ministers explained to Marius this pilgrim guise.--One chief\nsource of the master's knowledge of healing had been observation of the\nremedies resorted to by animals labouring under disease or pain--what\nleaf or berry the lizard or dormouse lay upon its wounded fellow; to\nwhich purpose for long years he had led the life of a wanderer, in wild\nplaces.  The boy took his place as the last comer, a little way behind\nthe group of worshippers who stood in front of the image.  There, with\nuplifted face, the palms of his two hands raised and open before him,\nand taught by the priest, he said his collect of thanksgiving and\nprayer (Aristeides has recorded it at the end of his Asclepiadae) to\nthe Inspired Dreams:--\n\n\"O ye children of Apollo! who in time past have stilled the waves of\nsorrow for many people, lighting up a lamp of safety before those who\ntravel by sea and land, be pleased, in your great condescension, though\nye be equal in glory with your elder brethren the Dioscuri, and your\nlot in immortal youth be as theirs, to accept this prayer, which in\nsleep and vision ye have inspired.  Order it aright, I pray you,\naccording to your loving-kindness to men.  Preserve me [40] from\nsickness; and endue my body with such a measure of health as may\nsuffice it for the obeying of the spirit, that I may pass my days\nunhindered and in quietness.\"\n\nOn the last morning of his visit Marius entered the shrine again, and\njust before his departure the priest, who had been his special director\nduring his stay at the place, lifting a cunningly contrived panel,\nwhich formed the back of one of the carved seats, bade him look\nthrough.  What he saw was like the vision of a new world, by the\nopening of some unsuspected window in a familiar dwelling-place.  He\nlooked out upon a long-drawn valley of singularly cheerful aspect,\nhidden, by the peculiar conformation of the locality, from all points\nof observation but this.  In a green meadow at the foot of the steep\nolive-clad rocks below, the novices were taking their exercise.  The\nsoftly sloping sides of the vale lay alike in full sunlight; and its\ndistant opening was closed by a beautifully formed mountain, from which\nthe last wreaths of morning mist were rising under the heat. It might\nhave seemed the very presentment of a land of hope, its hollows brimful\nof a shadow of blue flowers; and lo! on the one level space of the\nhorizon, in a long dark line, were towers and a dome: and that was\nPisa.--Or Rome, was it? asked Marius, ready to believe the utmost, in\nhis excitement.\n\nAll this served, as he understood afterwards [41] in retrospect, at\nonce to strengthen and to purify a certain vein of character in him.\nDeveloping the ideal, pre-existent there, of a religious beauty,\nassociated for the future with the exquisite splendour of the temple of\nAesculapius, as it dawned upon him on that morning of his first\nvisit--it developed that ideal in connexion with a vivid sense of the\nvalue of mental and bodily sanity.  And this recognition of the beauty,\neven for the aesthetic sense, of mere bodily health, now acquired,\noperated afterwards as an influence morally salutary, counteracting the\nless desirable or hazardous tendencies of some phases of thought,\nthrough which he was to pass.\n\nHe came home brown with health to find the health of his mother\nfailing; and about her death, which occurred not long afterwards, there\nwas a circumstance which rested with him as the cruellest touch of all,\nin an event which for a time seemed to have taken the light out of the\nsunshine.  She died away from home, but sent for him at the last, with\na painful effort on her part, but to his great gratitude, pondering, as\nhe always believed, that he might chance otherwise to look back all his\nlife long upon a single fault with something like remorse, and find the\nburden a great one.  For it happened that, through some sudden,\nincomprehensible petulance there had been an angry childish gesture,\nand a slighting word, at the very moment of her departure, actually for\nthe last time.  Remembering this [42] he would ever afterwards pray to\nbe saved from offences against his own affections; the thought of that\nmarred parting having peculiar bitterness for one, who set so much\nstore, both by principle and habit, on the sentiment of home.\n\nNOTES\n\n32. *[Transliteration:] \u00c3\u008a aporro\u00c3\u00aa tou kallous.  +Translation:\n\"Emanation from a thing of beauty.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV: THE TREE OF KNOWLEDGE\n\n     O mare!  O littus! verum secretumque Mouseion,+\n     quam multa invenitis, quam multa dictatis!\n                               Pliny's Letters.\n\n[43] IT would hardly have been possible to feel more seriously than did\nMarius in those grave years of his early life.  But the death of his\nmother turned seriousness of feeling into a matter of the intelligence:\nit made him a questioner; and, by bringing into full evidence to him\nthe force of his affections and the probable importance of their place\nin his future, developed in him generally the more human and earthly\nelements of character.  A singularly virile consciousness of the\nrealities of life pronounced itself in him; still however as in the\nmain a poetic apprehension, though united already with something of\npersonal ambition and the instinct of self-assertion.  There were days\nwhen he could suspect, though it was a suspicion he was careful at\nfirst to put from him, that that early, much [44] cherished religion of\nthe villa might come to count with him as but one form of poetic\nbeauty, or of the ideal, in things; as but one voice, in a world where\nthere were many voices it would be a moral weakness not to listen to.\nAnd yet this voice, through its forcible pre-occupation of his childish\nconscience, still seemed to make a claim of a quite exclusive\ncharacter, defining itself as essentially one of but two possible\nleaders of his spirit, the other proposing to him unlimited\nself-expansion in a world of various sunshine.  The contrast was so\npronounced as to make the easy, light-hearted, unsuspecting exercise of\nhimself, among the temptations of the new phase of life which had now\nbegun, seem nothing less than a rival religion, a rival religious\nservice.  The temptations, the various sunshine, were those of the old\ntown of Pisa, where Marius was now a tall schoolboy.  Pisa was a place\nlying just far enough from home to make his rare visits to it in\nchildhood seem like adventures, such as had never failed to supply new\nand refreshing impulses to the imagination.  The partly decayed pensive\ntown, which still had its commerce by sea, and its fashion at the\nbathing-season, had lent, at one time the vivid memory of its fair\nstreets of marble, at another the solemn outline of the dark hills of\nLuna on its background, at another the living glances of its men and\nwomen, to the thickly gathering crowd [45] of impressions, out of which\nhis notion of the world was then forming.  And while he learned that\nthe object, the experience, as it will be known to memory, is really\nfrom first to last the chief point for consideration in the conduct of\nlife, these things were feeding also the idealism constitutional with\nhim--his innate and habitual longing for a world altogether fairer than\nthat he saw.  The child could find his way in thought along those\nstreets of the old town, expecting duly the shrines at their corners,\nand their recurrent intervals of garden-courts, or side-views of\ndistant sea.  The great temple of the place, as he could remember it,\non turning back once for a last look from an angle of his homeward\nroad, counting its tall gray columns between the blue of the bay and\nthe blue fields of blossoming flax beyond; the harbour and its lights;\nthe foreign ships lying there; the sailors' chapel of Venus, and her\ngilded image, hung with votive gifts; the seamen themselves, their\nwomen and children, who had a whole peculiar colour-world of their\nown--the boy's superficial delight in the broad light and shadow of all\nthat was mingled with the sense of power, of unknown distance, of the\ndanger of storm and possible death.\n\nTo this place, then, Marius came down now from White-nights, to live in\nthe house of his guardian or tutor, that he might attend the school of\na famous rhetorician, and learn, among [46] other things, Greek.  The\nschool, one of many imitations of Plato's Academy in the old Athenian\ngarden, lay in a quiet suburb of Pisa, and had its grove of cypresses,\nits porticoes, a house for the master, its chapel and images.  For the\nmemory of Marius in after-days, a clear morning sunlight seemed to lie\nperpetually on that severe picture in old gray and green.  The lad went\nto this school daily betimes, in state at first, with a young slave to\ncarry the books, and certainly with no reluctance, for the sight of his\nfellow-scholars, and their petulant activity, coming upon the sadder\nsentimental moods of his childhood, awoke at once that instinct of\nemulation which is but the other side of sympathy; and he was not\naware, of course, how completely the difference of his previous\ntraining had made him, even in his most enthusiastic participation in\nthe ways of that little world, still essentially but a spectator. While\nall their heart was in their limited boyish race, and its transitory\nprizes, he was already entertaining himself, very pleasurably\nmeditative, with the tiny drama in action before him, as but the mimic,\npreliminary exercise for a larger contest, and already with an implicit\nepicureanism. Watching all the gallant effects of their small\nrivalries--a scene in the main of fresh delightful sunshine--he entered\nat once into the sensations of a rivalry beyond them, into the passion\nof men, and had already recognised a certain [47] appetite for fame,\nfor distinction among his fellows, as his dominant motive to be.\n\nThe fame he conceived for himself at this time was, as the reader will\nhave anticipated, of the intellectual order, that of a poet perhaps.\nAnd as, in that gray monastic tranquillity of the villa, inward voices\nfrom the reality of unseen things had come abundantly; so here, with\nthe sounds and aspects of the shore, and amid the urbanities, the\ngraceful follies, of a bathing-place, it was the reality, the tyrannous\nreality, of things visible that was borne in upon him.  The real world\naround--a present humanity not less comely, it might seem, than that of\nthe old heroic days--endowing everything it touched upon, however\nremotely, down to its little passing tricks of fashion even, with a\nkind of fleeting beauty, exercised over him just then a great\nfascination.\n\nThat sense had come upon him in all its power one exceptionally fine\nsummer, the summer when, at a somewhat earlier age than was usual, he\nhad formally assumed the dress of manhood, going into the Forum for\nthat purpose, accompanied by his friends in festal array.  At night,\nafter the full measure of those cloudless days, he would feel well-nigh\nwearied out, as if with a long succession of pictures and music. As he\nwandered through the gay streets or on the sea-shore, the real world\nseemed indeed boundless, and himself almost absolutely free in it, with\na boundless [48] appetite for experience, for adventure, whether\nphysical or of the spirit.  His entire rearing hitherto had lent itself\nto an imaginative exaltation of the past; but now the spectacle\nactually afforded to his untired and freely open senses, suggested the\nreflection that the present had, it might be, really advanced beyond\nthe past, and he was ready to boast in the very fact that it was\nmodern.  If, in a voluntary archaism, the polite world of that day went\nback to a choicer generation, as it fancied, for the purpose of a\nfastidious self-correction, in matters of art, of literature, and even,\nas we have seen, of religion, at least it improved, by a shade or two\nof more scrupulous finish, on the old pattern; and the new era, like\nthe Neu-zeit of the German enthusiasts at the beginning of our own\ncentury, might perhaps be discerned, awaiting one just a single step\nonward--the perfected new manner, in the consummation of time, alike as\nregards the things of the imagination and the actual conduct of life.\nOnly, while the pursuit of an ideal like this demanded entire liberty\nof heart and brain, that old, staid, conservative religion of his\nchildhood certainly had its being in a world of somewhat narrow\nrestrictions.  But then, the one was absolutely real, with nothing less\nthan the reality of seeing and hearing--the other, how vague, shadowy,\nproblematical!  Could its so limited probabilities be worth taking into\naccount in any practical question as to the rejecting or receiving [49]\nof what was indeed so real, and, on the face of it, so desirable?\n\nAnd, dating from the time of his first coming to school, a great\nfriendship had grown up for him, in that life of so few\nattachments--the pure and disinterested friendship of schoolmates.  He\nhad seen Flavian for the first time the day on which he had come to\nPisa, at the moment when his mind was full of wistful thoughts\nregarding the new life to begin for him to-morrow, and he gazed\ncuriously at the crowd of bustling scholars as they came from their\nclasses.  There was something in Flavian a shade disdainful, as he\nstood isolated from the others for a moment, explained in part by his\nstature and the distinction of the low, broad forehead; though there\nwas pleasantness also for the newcomer in the roving blue eyes which\nseemed somehow to take a fuller hold upon things around than is usual\nwith boys.  Marius knew that those proud glances made kindly note of\nhim for a moment, and felt something like friendship at first sight.\nThere was a tone of reserve or gravity there, amid perfectly\ndisciplined health, which, to his fancy, seemed to carry forward the\nexpression of the austere sky and the clear song of the blackbird on\nthat gray March evening.  Flavian indeed was a creature who changed\nmuch with the changes of the passing light and shade about him, and was\nbrilliant enough under the early sunshine in [50] school next morning.\nOf all that little world of more or less gifted youth, surely the\ncentre was this lad of servile birth.  Prince of the school, he had\ngained an easy dominion over the old Greek master by the fascination of\nhis parts, and over his fellow-scholars by the figure he bore.  He wore\nalready the manly dress; and standing there in class, as he displayed\nhis wonderful quickness in reckoning, or his taste in declaiming Homer,\nhe was like a carved figure in motion, thought Marius, but with that\nindescribable gleam upon it which the words of Homer actually\nsuggested, as perceptible on the visible forms of the gods--hoia theous\nepen\u00c3\u00aanothen aien eontas.+\n\nA story hung by him, a story which his comrades acutely connected with\nhis habitual air of somewhat peevish pride.  Two points were held to be\nclear amid its general vagueness--a rich stranger paid his schooling,\nand he was himself very poor, though there was an attractive piquancy\nin the poverty of Flavian which in a scholar of another figure might\nhave been despised.  Over Marius too his dominion was entire.  Three\nyears older than he, Flavian was appointed to help the younger boy in\nhis studies, and Marius thus became virtually his servant in many\nthings, taking his humours with a sort of grateful pride in being\nnoticed at all, and, thinking over all this afterwards, found that the\n[51] fascination experienced by him had been a sentimental one,\ndependent on the concession to himself of an intimacy, a certain\ntolerance of his company, granted to none beside.\n\nThat was in the earliest days; and then, as their intimacy grew, the\ngenius, the intellectual power of Flavian began its sway over him. The\nbrilliant youth who loved dress, and dainty food, and flowers, and\nseemed to have a natural alliance with, and claim upon, everything else\nwhich was physically select and bright, cultivated also that foppery of\nwords, of choice diction which was common among the \u00c3\u00a9lite spirits of\nthat day; and Marius, early an expert and elegant penman, transcribed\nhis verses (the euphuism of which, amid a genuine original power, was\nthen so delightful to him) in beautiful ink, receiving in return the\nprofit of Flavian's really great intellectual capacities, developed and\naccomplished under the ambitious desire to make his way effectively in\nlife.  Among other things he introduced him to the writings of a\nsprightly wit, then very busy with the pen, one Lucian--writings\nseeming to overflow with that intellectual light turned upon dim\nplaces, which, at least in seasons of mental fair weather, can make\npeople laugh where they have been wont, perhaps, to pray.  And, surely,\nthe sunlight which filled those well-remembered early mornings in\nschool, had had more than the usual measure of gold in it! [52] Marius,\nat least, would lie awake before the time, thinking with delight of the\nlong coming hours of hard work in the presence of Flavian, as other\nboys dream of a holiday.\n\nIt was almost by accident at last, so wayward and capricious was he,\nthat reserve gave way, and Flavian told the story of his father--a\nfreedman, presented late in life, and almost against his will, with the\nliberty so fondly desired in youth, but on condition of the sacrifice\nof part of his peculium--the slave's diminutive hoard--amassed by many\na self-denial, in an existence necessarily hard.  The rich man,\ninterested in the promise of the fair child born on his estate, had\nsent him to school.  The meanness and dejection, nevertheless, of that\nunoccupied old age defined the leading memory of Flavian, revived\nsometimes, after this first confidence, with a burst of angry tears\namid the sunshine.  But nature had had her economy in nursing the\nstrength of that one natural affection; for, save his half-selfish care\nfor Marius, it was the single, really generous part, the one piety, in\nthe lad's character.  In him Marius saw the spirit of unbelief,\nachieved as if at one step.  The much-admired freedman's son, as with\nthe privilege of a natural aristocracy, believed only in himself, in\nthe brilliant, and mainly sensuous gifts, he had, or meant to acquire.\n\nAnd then, he had certainly yielded himself, [53] though still with\nuntouched health, in a world where manhood comes early, to the\nseductions of that luxurious town, and Marius wondered sometimes, in\nthe freer revelation of himself by conversation, at the extent of his\nearly corruption.  How often, afterwards, did evil things present\nthemselves in malign association with the memory of that beautiful\nhead, and with a kind of borrowed sanction and charm in its natural\ngrace!  To Marius, at a later time, he counted for as it were an\nepitome of the whole pagan world, the depth of its corruption, and its\nperfection of form.  And still, in his mobility, his animation, in his\neager capacity for various life, he was so real an object, after that\nvisionary idealism of the villa.  His voice, his glance, were like the\nbreaking in of the solid world upon one, amid the flimsy fictions of a\ndream.  A shadow, handling all things as shadows, had felt a sudden\nreal and poignant heat in them.\n\nMeantime, under his guidance, Marius was learning quickly and\nabundantly, because with a good will.  There was that in the actual\neffectiveness of his figure which stimulated the younger lad to make\nthe most of opportunity; and he had experience already that education\nlargely increased one's capacity for enjoyment.  He was acquiring what\nit is the chief function of all higher education to impart, the art,\nnamely, of so relieving the ideal or poetic traits, [54] the elements\nof distinction, in our everyday life--of so exclusively living in\nthem--that the unadorned remainder of it, the mere drift or d\u00c3\u00a9bris of\nour days, comes to be as though it were not.  And the consciousness of\nthis aim came with the reading of one particular book, then fresh in\nthe world, with which he fell in about this time--a book which awakened\nthe poetic or romantic capacity as perhaps some other book might have\ndone, but was peculiar in giving it a direction emphatically sensuous.\nIt made him, in that visionary reception of every-day life, the seer,\nmore especially, of a revelation in colour and form.  If our modern\neducation, in its better efforts, really conveys to any of us that kind\nof idealising power, it does so (though dealing mainly, as its\nprofessed instruments, with the most select and ideal remains of\nancient literature) oftenest by truant reading; and thus it happened\nalso, long ago, with Marius and his friend.\n\nNOTES\n\n43. +Transliteration: Mouseion.

They looked round: the western sun smote\nthrough the broad chinks of the shutters.  How like a picture! and it\nwas precisely the scene described in what they were reading, with just\nthat added poetic touch in the book which made it delightful and\nselect, and, in the actual place, the ray of sunlight transforming the\nrough grain among the cool brown shadows into heaps of gold.  What they\nwere intent on was, indeed, the book of books, the \"golden\" book of\nthat day, a gift to Flavian, as was shown by the purple writing on the\nhandsome yellow wrapper, following the title Flaviane!--it said,\n\n     Flaviane! lege Felicitur!\n     Flaviane!  Vivas!  Fioreas!\n     Flaviane!  Vivas!  Gaudeas!\n\n[56] It was perfumed with oil of sandal-wood, and decorated with carved\nand gilt ivory bosses at the ends of the roller.\n\nAnd the inside was something not less dainty and fine, full of the\narchaisms and curious felicities in which that generation delighted,\nquaint terms and images picked fresh from the early dramatists, the\nlifelike phrases of some lost poet preserved by an old grammarian, racy\nmorsels of the vernacular and studied prettinesses:--all alike, mere\nplaythings for the genuine power and natural eloquence of the erudite\nartist, unsuppressed by his erudition, which, however, made some people\nangry, chiefly less well \"got-up\" people, and especially those who were\nuntidy from indolence.\n\nNo! it was certainly not that old-fashioned, unconscious ease of the\nearly literature, which could never come again; which, after all, had\nhad more in common with the \"infinite patience\" of Apuleius than with\nthe hack-work readiness of his detractors, who might so well have been\n\"self-conscious\" of going slip-shod.  And at least his success was\nunmistakable as to the precise literary effect he had intended,\nincluding a certain tincture of \"neology\" in expression--nonnihil\ninterdum elocutione novella parum signatum--in the language of\nCornelius Fronto, the contemporary prince of rhetoricians.  What words\nhe had found for conveying, with a single touch, the sense of textures,\ncolours, [57] incidents!  \"Like jewellers' work!  Like a myrrhine\nvase!\"--admirers said of his writing.  \"The golden fibre in the hair,\nthe gold thread-work in the gown marked her as the mistress\"--aurum in\ncomis et in tunicis, ibi inflexum hic intextum, matronam profecto\nconfitebatur--he writes, with his \"curious felicity,\" of one of his\nheroines.  Aurum intextum: gold fibre:--well! there was something of\nthat kind in his own work.  And then, in an age when people, from the\nemperor Aurelius downwards, prided themselves unwisely on writing in\nGreek, he had written for Latin people in their own tongue; though\nstill, in truth, with all the care of a learned language.  Not less\nhappily inventive were the incidents recorded--story within\nstory--stories with the sudden, unlooked-for changes of dreams.  He had\nhis humorous touches also.  And what went to the ordinary boyish taste,\nin those somewhat peculiar readers, what would have charmed boys more\npurely boyish, was the adventure:--the bear loose in the house at\nnight, the wolves storming the farms in winter, the exploits of the\nrobbers, their charming caves, the delightful thrill one had at the\nquestion--\"Don't you know that these roads are infested by robbers?\"\n\nThe scene of the romance was laid in Thessaly, the original land of\nwitchcraft, and took one up and down its mountains, and into its old\nweird towns, haunts of magic and [58] incantation, where all the more\ngenuine appliances of the black art, left behind her by Medea when she\nfled through that country, were still in use.  In the city of Hypata,\nindeed, nothing seemed to be its true self--\"You might think that\nthrough the murmuring of some cadaverous spell, all things had been\nchanged into forms not their own; that there was humanity in the\nhardness of the stones you stumbled on; that the birds you heard\nsinging were feathered men; that the trees around the walls drew their\nleaves from a like source.  The statues seemed about to move, the walls\nto speak, the dumb cattle to break out in prophecy; nay! the very sky\nand the sunbeams, as if they might suddenly cry out.\" Witches are there\nwho can draw down the moon, or at least the lunar virus--that white\nfluid she sheds, to be found, so rarely, \"on high, heathy places: which\nis a poison.  A touch of it will drive men mad.\"\n\nAnd in one very remote village lives the sorceress Pamphile, who turns\nher neighbours into various animals.  What true humour in the scene\nwhere, after mounting the rickety stairs, Lucius, peeping curiously\nthrough a chink in the door, is a spectator of the transformation of\nthe old witch herself into a bird, that she may take flight to the\nobject of her affections--into an owl!  \"First she stripped off every\nrag she had.  Then opening a certain chest she took from it many small\nboxes, and removing the lid [59] of one of them, rubbed herself over\nfor a long time, from head to foot, with an ointment it contained, and\nafter much low muttering to her lamp, began to jerk at last and shake\nher limbs.  And as her limbs moved to and fro, out burst the soft\nfeathers: stout wings came forth to view: the nose grew hard and\nhooked: her nails were crooked into claws; and Pamphile was an owl. She\nuttered a queasy screech; and, leaping little by little from the\nground, making trial of herself, fled presently, on full wing, out of\ndoors.\"\n\nBy clumsy imitation of this process, Lucius, the hero of the romance,\ntransforms himself, not as he had intended into a showy winged\ncreature, but into the animal which has given name to the book; for\nthroughout it there runs a vein of racy, homely satire on the love of\nmagic then prevalent, curiosity concerning which had led Lucius to\nmeddle with the old woman's appliances.  \"Be you my Venus,\" he says to\nthe pretty maid-servant who has introduced him to the view of Pamphile,\n\"and let me stand by you a winged Cupid!\" and, freely applying the\nmagic ointment, sees himself transformed, \"not into a bird, but into an\nass!\"\n\nWell! the proper remedy for his distress is a supper of roses, could\nsuch be found, and many are his quaintly picturesque attempts to come\nby them at that adverse season; as he contrives to do at last, when,\nthe grotesque procession of Isis [60] passing by with a bear and other\nstrange animals in its train, the ass following along with the rest\nsuddenly crunches the chaplet of roses carried in the High-priest's\nhand.\n\nMeantime, however, he must wait for the spring, with more than the\noutside of an ass; \"though I was not so much a fool, nor so truly an\nass,\" he tells us, when he happens to be left alone with a daintily\nspread table, \"as to neglect this most delicious fare, and feed upon\ncoarse hay.\"  For, in truth, all through the book, there is an\nunmistakably real feeling for asses, with bold touches like Swift's,\nand a genuine animal breadth.  Lucius was the original ass, who peeping\nslily from the window of his hiding-place forgot all about the big\nshade he cast just above him, and gave occasion to the joke or proverb\nabout \"the peeping ass and his shadow.\"\n\nBut the marvellous, delight in which is one of the really serious\nelements in most boys, passed at times, those young readers still\nfeeling its fascination, into what French writers call the\nmacabre--that species of almost insane pre-occupation with the\nmaterialities of our mouldering flesh, that luxury of disgust in gazing\non corruption, which was connected, in this writer at least, with not a\nlittle obvious coarseness.  It was a strange notion of the gross lust\nof the actual world, that Marius took from some of these episodes. \"I\nam told,\" they read, \"that [61] when foreigners are interred, the old\nwitches are in the habit of out-racing the funeral procession, to\nravage the corpse\"--in order to obtain certain cuttings and remnants\nfrom it, with which to injure the living--\"especially if the witch has\nhappened to cast her eye upon some goodly young man.\"  And the scene of\nthe night-watching of a dead body lest the witches should come to tear\noff the flesh with their teeth, is worthy of Th\u00c3\u00a9ophile Gautier.\n\nBut set as one of the episodes in the main narrative, a true gem amid\nits mockeries, its coarse though genuine humanity, its burlesque\nhorrors, came the tale of Cupid and Psyche, full of brilliant,\nlife-like situations, speciosa locis, and abounding in lovely visible\nimagery (one seemed to see and handle the golden hair, the fresh\nflowers, the precious works of art in it!) yet full also of a gentle\nidealism, so that you might take it, if you chose, for an allegory.\nWith a concentration of all his finer literary gifts, Apuleius had\ngathered into it the floating star-matter of many a delightful old\nstory.--\n\nThe Story of Cupid and Psyche.\n\nIn a certain city lived a king and queen who had three daughters\nexceeding fair.  But the beauty of the elder sisters, though pleasant\nto behold, yet passed not the measure of human praise, while such was\nthe loveliness of the [62] youngest that men's speech was too poor to\ncommend it worthily and could express it not at all.  Many of the\ncitizens and of strangers, whom the fame of this excellent vision had\ngathered thither, confounded by that matchless beauty, could but kiss\nthe finger-tips of their right hands at sight of her, as in adoration\nto the goddess Venus herself.  And soon a rumour passed through the\ncountry that she whom the blue deep had borne, forbearing her divine\ndignity, was even then moving among men, or that by some fresh\ngermination from the stars, not the sea now, but the earth, had put\nforth a new Venus, endued with the flower of virginity.\n\nThis belief, with the fame of the maiden's loveliness, went daily\nfurther into distant lands, so that many people were drawn together to\nbehold that glorious model of the age.  Men sailed no longer to Paphos,\nto Cnidus or Cythera, to the presence of the goddess Venus: her sacred\nrites were neglected, her images stood uncrowned, the cold ashes were\nleft to disfigure her forsaken altars.  It was to a maiden that men's\nprayers were offered, to a human countenance they looked, in\npropitiating so great a godhead: when the girl went forth in the\nmorning they strewed flowers on her way, and the victims proper to that\nunseen goddess were presented as she passed along.  This conveyance of\ndivine worship to a mortal kindled meantime the anger of the true\nVenus.  \"Lo! now, the ancient [63] parent of nature,\" she cried, \"the\nfountain of all elements!  Behold me, Venus, benign mother of the\nworld, sharing my honours with a mortal maiden, while my name, built up\nin heaven, is profaned by the mean things of earth!  Shall a perishable\nwoman bear my image about with her?  In vain did the shepherd of Ida\nprefer me!  Yet shall she have little joy, whosoever she be, of her\nusurped and unlawful loveliness!\" Thereupon she called to her that\nwinged, bold boy, of evil ways, who wanders armed by night through\nmen's houses, spoiling their marriages; and stirring yet more by her\nspeech his inborn wantonness, she led him to the city, and showed him\nPsyche as she walked.\n\n\"I pray thee,\" she said, \"give thy mother a full revenge.  Let this\nmaid become the slave of an unworthy love.\"  Then, embracing him\nclosely, she departed to the shore and took her throne upon the crest\nof the wave.  And lo! at her unuttered will, her ocean-servants are in\nwaiting: the daughters of Nereus are there singing their song, and\nPortunus, and Salacia, and the tiny charioteer of the dolphin, with a\nhost of Tritons leaping through the billows.  And one blows softly\nthrough his sounding sea-shell, another spreads a silken web against\nthe sun, a third presents the mirror to the eyes of his mistress, while\nthe others swim side by side below, drawing her chariot.  Such was the\nescort of Venus as she went upon the sea.\n\n[64] Psyche meantime, aware of her loveliness, had no fruit thereof.\nAll people regarded and admired, but none sought her in marriage.  It\nwas but as on the finished work of the craftsman that they gazed upon\nthat divine likeness.  Her sisters, less fair than she, were happily\nwedded.  She, even as a widow, sitting at home, wept over her\ndesolation, hating in her heart the beauty in which all men were\npleased.\n\nAnd the king, supposing the gods were angry, inquired of the oracle of\nApollo, and Apollo answered him thus: \"Let the damsel be placed on the\ntop of a certain mountain, adorned as for the bed of marriage and of\ndeath.  Look not for a son-in-law of mortal birth; but for that evil\nserpent-thing, by reason of whom even the gods tremble and the shadows\nof Styx are afraid.\"\n\nSo the king returned home and made known the oracle to his wife.  For\nmany days she lamented, but at last the fulfilment of the divine\nprecept is urgent upon her, and the company make ready to conduct the\nmaiden to her deadly bridal.  And now the nuptial torch gathers dark\nsmoke and ashes: the pleasant sound of the pipe is changed into a cry:\nthe marriage hymn concludes in a sorrowful wailing: below her yellow\nwedding-veil the bride shook away her tears; insomuch that the whole\ncity was afflicted together at the ill-luck of the stricken house.\n\nBut the mandate of the god impelled the hapless Psyche to her fate,\nand, these solemnities [65] being ended, the funeral of the living soul\ngoes forth, all the people following.  Psyche, bitterly weeping,\nassists not at her marriage but at her own obsequies, and while the\nparents hesitate to accomplish a thing so unholy the daughter cries to\nthem: \"Wherefore torment your luckless age by long weeping?  This was\nthe prize of my extraordinary beauty!  When all people celebrated us\nwith divine honours, and in one voice named the New Venus, it was then\nye should have wept for me as one dead.  Now at last I understand that\nthat one name of Venus has been my ruin.  Lead me and set me upon the\nappointed place.  I am in haste to submit to that well-omened marriage,\nto behold that goodly spouse.  Why delay the coming of him who was born\nfor the destruction of the whole world?\"\n\nShe was silent, and with firm step went on the way.  And they proceeded\nto the appointed place on a steep mountain, and left there the maiden\nalone, and took their way homewards dejectedly.  The wretched parents,\nin their close-shut house, yielded themselves to perpetual night; while\nto Psyche, fearful and trembling and weeping sore upon the\nmountain-top, comes the gentle Zephyrus.  He lifts her mildly, and,\nwith vesture afloat on either side, bears her by his own soft breathing\nover the windings of the hills, and sets her lightly among the flowers\nin the bosom of a valley below.\n\nPsyche, in those delicate grassy places, lying [66] sweetly on her dewy\nbed, rested from the agitation of her soul and arose in peace. And lo!\na grove of mighty trees, with a fount of water, clear as glass, in the\nmidst; and hard by the water, a dwelling-place, built not by human\nhands but by some divine cunning.  One recognised, even at the\nentering, the delightful hostelry of a god.  Golden pillars sustained\nthe roof, arched most curiously in cedar-wood and ivory. The walls were\nhidden under wrought silver:--all tame and woodland creatures leaping\nforward to the visitor's gaze.  Wonderful indeed was the craftsman,\ndivine or half-divine, who by the subtlety of his art had breathed so\nwild a soul into the silver!  The very pavement was distinct with\npictures in goodly stones.  In the glow of its precious metal the house\nis its own daylight, having no need of the sun.  Well might it seem a\nplace fashioned for the conversation of gods with men!\n\nPsyche, drawn forward by the delight of it, came near, and, her courage\ngrowing, stood within the doorway.  One by one, she admired the\nbeautiful things she saw; and, most wonderful of all! no lock, no\nchain, nor living guardian protected that great treasure house.  But as\nshe gazed there came a voice--a voice, as it were unclothed of bodily\nvesture--\"Mistress!\" it said, \"all these things are thine. Lie down,\nand relieve thy weariness, and rise again for the bath when thou wilt.\nWe thy servants, whose [67] voice thou hearest, will be beforehand with\nour service, and a royal feast shall be ready.\"\n\nAnd Psyche understood that some divine care was providing, and,\nrefreshed with sleep and the Bath, sat down to the feast.  Still she\nsaw no one: only she heard words falling here and there, and had voices\nalone to serve her.  And the feast being ended, one entered the chamber\nand sang to her unseen, while another struck the chords of a harp,\ninvisible with him who played on it.  Afterwards the sound of a company\nsinging together came to her, but still so that none were present to\nsight; yet it appeared that a great multitude of singers was there.\n\nAnd the hour of evening inviting her, she climbed into the bed; and as\nthe night was far advanced, behold a sound of a certain clemency\napproaches her.  Then, fearing for her maidenhood in so great solitude,\nshe trembled, and more than any evil she knew dreaded that she knew\nnot.  And now the husband, that unknown husband, drew near, and\nascended the couch, and made her his wife; and lo! before the rise of\ndawn he had departed hastily.  And the attendant voices ministered to\nthe needs of the newly married.  And so it happened with her for a long\nseason.  And as nature has willed, this new thing, by continual use,\nbecame a delight to her: the sound of the voice grew to be her solace\nin that condition of loneliness and uncertainty.\n\n[68] One night the bridegroom spoke thus to his beloved, \"O Psyche,\nmost pleasant bride!  Fortune is grown stern with us, and threatens\nthee with mortal peril.  Thy sisters, troubled at the report of thy\ndeath and seeking some trace of thee, will come to the mountain's top.\nBut if by chance their cries reach thee, answer not, neither look forth\nat all, lest thou bring sorrow upon me and destruction upon thyself.\"\nThen Psyche promised that she would do according to his will.  But the\nbridegroom was fled away again with the night. And all that day she\nspent in tears, repeating that she was now dead indeed, shut up in that\ngolden prison, powerless to console her sisters sorrowing after her, or\nto see their faces; and so went to rest weeping.\n\nAnd after a while came the bridegroom again, and lay down beside her,\nand embracing her as she wept, complained, \"Was this thy promise, my\nPsyche?  What have I to hope from thee?  Even in the arms of thy\nhusband thou ceasest not from pain.  Do now as thou wilt.  Indulge\nthine own desire, though it seeks what will ruin thee.  Yet wilt thou\nremember my warning, repentant too late.\"  Then, protesting that she is\nlike to die, she obtains from him that he suffer her to see her\nsisters, and present to them moreover what gifts she would of golden\nornaments; but therewith he ofttimes advised her never at any time,\nyielding to pernicious counsel, to enquire concerning his bodily form,\nlest she fall, [69] through unholy curiosity, from so great a height of\nfortune, nor feel ever his embrace again.  \"I would die a hundred\ntimes,\" she said, cheerful at last, \"rather than be deprived of thy\nmost sweet usage.  I love thee as my own soul, beyond comparison even\nwith Love himself.  Only bid thy servant Zephyrus bring hither my\nsisters, as he brought me.  My honeycomb!  My husband!  Thy Psyche's\nbreath of life!\"  So he promised; and after the embraces of the night,\nere the light appeared, vanished from the hands of his bride.\n\nAnd the sisters, coming to the place where Psyche was abandoned, wept\nloudly among the rocks, and called upon her by name, so that the sound\ncame down to her, and running out of the palace distraught, she cried,\n\"Wherefore afflict your souls with lamentation?  I whom you mourn am\nhere.\"  Then, summoning Zephyrus, she reminded him of her husband's\nbidding; and he bare them down with a gentle blast.  \"Enter now,\" she\nsaid, \"into my house, and relieve your sorrow in the company of Psyche\nyour sister.\"\n\nAnd Psyche displayed to them all the treasures of the golden house, and\nits great family of ministering voices, nursing in them the malice\nwhich was already at their hearts.  And at last one of them asks\ncuriously who the lord of that celestial array may be, and what manner\nof man her husband?  And Psyche [70] answered dissemblingly, \"A young\nman, handsome and mannerly, with a goodly beard.  For the most part he\nhunts upon the mountains.\"  And lest the secret should slip from her in\nthe way of further speech, loading her sisters with gold and gems, she\ncommanded Zephyrus to bear them away.\n\nAnd they returned home, on fire with envy.  \"See now the injustice of\nfortune!\" cried one.  \"We, the elder children, are given like servants\nto be the wives of strangers, while the youngest is possessed of so\ngreat riches, who scarcely knows how to use them. You saw, Sister! what\na hoard of wealth lies in the house; what glittering gowns; what\nsplendour of precious gems, besides all that gold trodden under foot.\nIf she indeed hath, as she said, a bridegroom so goodly, then no one in\nall the world is happier.  And it may be that this husband, being of\ndivine nature, will make her too a goddess.  Nay! so in truth it is. It\nwas even thus she bore herself.  Already she looks aloft and breathes\ndivinity, who, though but a woman, has voices for her handmaidens, and\ncan command the winds.\"  \"Think,\" answered the other, \"how arrogantly\nshe dealt with us, grudging us these trifling gifts out of all that\nstore, and when our company became a burden, causing us to be hissed\nand driven away from her through the air!  But I am no woman if she\nkeep her hold on this great fortune; and if the insult done us has\ntouched [71] thee too, take we counsel together.  Meanwhile let us hold\nour peace, and know naught of her, alive or dead.  For they are not\ntruly happy of whose happiness other folk are unaware.\"\n\nAnd the bridegroom, whom still she knows not, warns her thus a second\ntime, as he talks with her by night: \"Seest thou what peril besets\nthee?  Those cunning wolves have made ready for thee their snares, of\nwhich the sum is that they persuade thee to search into the fashion of\nmy countenance, the seeing of which, as I have told thee often, will be\nthe seeing of it no more for ever.  But do thou neither listen nor make\nanswer to aught regarding thy husband.  Besides, we have sown also the\nseed of our race.  Even now this bosom grows with a child to be born to\nus, a child, if thou but keep our secret, of divine quality; if thou\nprofane it, subject to death.\"  And Psyche was glad at the tidings,\nrejoicing in that solace of a divine seed, and in the glory of that\npledge of love to be, and the dignity of the name of mother.  Anxiously\nshe notes the increase of the days, the waning months.  And again, as\nhe tarries briefly beside her, the bridegroom repeats his warning:\n\n\"Even now the sword is drawn with which thy sisters seek thy life. Have\npity on thyself, sweet wife, and upon our child, and see not those evil\nwomen again.\"  But the sisters make their way into the palace once\nmore, crying to her in [72] wily tones, \"O Psyche! and thou too wilt be\na mother!  How great will be the joy at home!  Happy indeed shall we be\nto have the nursing of the golden child.  Truly if he be answerable to\nthe beauty of his parents, it will be a birth of Cupid himself.\"\n\nSo, little by little, they stole upon the heart of their sister. She,\nmeanwhile, bids the lyre to sound for their delight, and the playing is\nheard: she bids the pipes to move, the quire to sing, and the music and\nthe singing come invisibly, soothing the mind of the listener with\nsweetest modulation.  Yet not even thereby was their malice put to\nsleep: once more they seek to know what manner of husband she has, and\nwhence that seed.  And Psyche, simple over-much, forgetful of her first\nstory, answers, \"My husband comes from a far country, trading for great\nsums.  He is already of middle age, with whitening locks.\"  And\ntherewith she dismisses them again.\n\nAnd returning home upon the soft breath of Zephyrus one cried to the\nother, \"What shall be said of so ugly a lie?  He who was a young man\nwith goodly beard is now in middle life.  It must be that she told a\nfalse tale: else is she in very truth ignorant what manner of man he\nis.  Howsoever it be, let us destroy her quickly.  For if she indeed\nknows not, be sure that her bridegroom is one of the gods: it is a god\nshe bears in her womb.  And let [73] that be far from us!  If she be\ncalled mother of a god, then will life be more than I can bear.\"\n\nSo, full of rage against her, they returned to Psyche, and said to her\ncraftily, \"Thou livest in an ignorant bliss, all incurious of thy real\ndanger.  It is a deadly serpent, as we certainly know, that comes to\nsleep at thy side.  Remember the words of the oracle, which declared\nthee destined to a cruel beast.  There are those who have seen it at\nnightfall, coming back from its feeding.  In no long time, they say, it\nwill end its blandishments.  It but waits for the babe to be formed in\nthee, that it may devour thee by so much the richer. If indeed the\nsolitude of this musical place, or it may be the loathsome commerce of\na hidden love, delight thee, we at least in sisterly piety have done\nour part.\"  And at last the unhappy Psyche, simple and frail of soul,\ncarried away by the terror of their words, losing memory of her\nhusband's precepts and her own promise, brought upon herself a great\ncalamity.  Trembling and turning pale, she answers them, \"And they who\ntell those things, it may be, speak the truth.  For in very deed never\nhave I seen the face of my husband, nor know I at all what manner of\nman he is.  Always he frights me diligently from the sight of him,\nthreatening some great evil should I too curiously look upon his face.\nDo ye, if ye can help your sister in her great peril, stand by her now.\"\n\n[74] Her sisters answered her, \"The way of safety we have well\nconsidered, and will teach thee.  Take a sharp knife, and hide it in\nthat part of the couch where thou art wont to lie: take also a lamp\nfilled with oil, and set it Privily behind the curtain.  And when he\nshall have drawn up his coils into the accustomed place, and thou\nhearest him breathe in sleep, slip then from his side and discover the\nlamp, and, knife in hand, put forth thy strength, and strike off the\nserpent's head.\"  And so they departed in haste.\n\nAnd Psyche left alone (alone but for the furies which beset her) is\ntossed up and down in her distress, like a wave of the sea; and though\nher will is firm, yet, in the moment of putting hand to the deed, she\nfalters, and is torn asunder by various apprehension of the great\ncalamity upon her.  She hastens and anon delays, now full of distrust,\nand now of angry courage: under one bodily form she loathes the monster\nand loves the bridegroom.  But twilight ushers in the night; and at\nlength in haste she makes ready for the terrible deed. Darkness came,\nand the bridegroom; and he first, after some faint essay of love, falls\ninto a deep sleep.\n\nAnd she, erewhile of no strength, the hard purpose of destiny assisting\nher, is confirmed in force.  With lamp plucked forth, knife in hand,\nshe put by her sex; and lo! as the secrets of the bed became manifest,\nthe sweetest and most gentle of all creatures, Love himself, reclined\n[75] there, in his own proper loveliness!  At sight of him the very\nflame of the lamp kindled more gladly!  But Psyche was afraid at the\nvision, and, faint of soul, trembled back upon her knees, and would\nhave hidden the steel in her own bosom.  But the knife slipped from her\nhand; and now, undone, yet ofttimes looking upon the beauty of that\ndivine countenance, she lives again.  She sees the locks of that golden\nhead, pleasant with the unction of the gods, shed down in graceful\nentanglement behind and before, about the ruddy cheeks and white\nthroat.  The pinions of the winged god, yet fresh with the dew, are\nspotless upon his shoulders, the delicate plumage wavering over them as\nthey lie at rest.  Smooth he was, and, touched with light, worthy of\nVenus his mother.  At the foot of the couch lay his bow and arrows, the\ninstruments of his power, propitious to men.\n\nAnd Psyche, gazing hungrily thereon, draws an arrow from the quiver,\nand trying the point upon her thumb, tremulous still, drave in the\nbarb, so that a drop of blood came forth.  Thus fell she, by her own\nact, and unaware, into the love of Love.  Falling upon the bridegroom,\nwith indrawn breath, in a hurry of kisses from eager and open lips, she\nshuddered as she thought how brief that sleep might be.  And it chanced\nthat a drop of burning oil fell from the lamp upon the god's shoulder.\nAh! maladroit minister of love, thus to wound him from whom [76] all\nfire comes; though 'twas a lover, I trow, first devised thee, to have\nthe fruit of his desire even in the darkness!  At the touch of the fire\nthe god started up, and beholding the overthrow of her faith, quietly\ntook flight from her embraces.\n\nAnd Psyche, as he rose upon the wing, laid hold on him with her two\nhands, hanging upon him in his passage through the air, till she sinks\nto the earth through weariness.  And as she lay there, the divine\nlover, tarrying still, lighted upon a cypress tree which grew near,\nand, from the top of it, spake thus to her, in great emotion. \"Foolish\none! unmindful of the command of Venus, my mother, who had devoted thee\nto one of base degree, I fled to thee in his stead.  Now know I that\nthis was vainly done.  Into mine own flesh pierced mine arrow, and I\nmade thee my wife, only that I might seem a monster beside thee--that\nthou shouldst seek to wound the head wherein lay the eyes so full of\nlove to thee!  Again and again, I thought to put thee on thy guard\nconcerning these things, and warned thee in loving-kindness.  Now I\nwould but punish thee by my flight hence.\"  And therewith he winged his\nway into the deep sky.\n\nPsyche, prostrate upon the earth, and following far as sight might\nreach the flight of the bridegroom, wept and lamented; and when the\nbreadth of space had parted him wholly from her, cast herself down from\nthe bank of a river [77] which was nigh.  But the stream, turning\ngentle in honour of the god, put her forth again unhurt upon its\nmargin.  And as it happened, Pan, the rustic god, was sitting just then\nby the waterside, embracing, in the body of a reed, the goddess Canna;\nteaching her to respond to him in all varieties of slender sound.  Hard\nby, his flock of goats browsed at will.  And the shaggy god called her,\nwounded and outworn, kindly to him and said, \"I am but a rustic\nherdsman, pretty maiden, yet wise, by favour of my great age and long\nexperience; and if I guess truly by those faltering steps, by thy\nsorrowful eyes and continual sighing, thou labourest with excess of\nlove.  Listen then to me, and seek not death again, in the stream or\notherwise.  Put aside thy woe, and turn thy prayers to Cupid.  He is in\ntruth a delicate youth: win him by the delicacy of thy service.\"\n\nSo the shepherd-god spoke, and Psyche, answering nothing, but with a\nreverence to his serviceable deity, went on her way.  And while she, in\nher search after Cupid, wandered through many lands, he was lying in\nthe chamber of his mother, heart-sick.  And the white bird which floats\nover the waves plunged in haste into the sea, and approaching Venus, as\nshe bathed, made known to her that her son lies afflicted with some\ngrievous hurt, doubtful of life.  And Venus cried, angrily, \"My son,\nthen, has a mistress!  And it is Psyche, who witched away [78] my\nbeauty and was the rival of my godhead, whom he loves!\"\n\nTherewith she issued from the sea, and returning to her golden chamber,\nfound there the lad, sick, as she had heard, and cried from the\ndoorway, \"Well done, truly! to trample thy mother's precepts under\nfoot, to spare my enemy that cross of an unworthy love; nay, unite her\nto thyself, child as thou art, that I might have a daughter-in-law who\nhates me!  I will make thee repent of thy sport, and the savour of thy\nmarriage bitter.  There is one who shall chasten this body of thine,\nput out thy torch and unstring thy bow. Not till she has plucked forth\nthat hair, into which so oft these hands have smoothed the golden\nlight, and sheared away thy wings, shall I feel the injury done me\navenged.\"  And with this she hastened in anger from the doors.\n\nAnd Ceres and Juno met her, and sought to know the meaning of her\ntroubled countenance.  \"Ye come in season,\" she cried; \"I pray you,\nfind for me Psyche.  It must needs be that ye have heard the disgrace\nof my house.\"  And they, ignorant of what was done, would have soothed\nher anger, saying, \"What fault, Mistress, hath thy son committed, that\nthou wouldst destroy the girl he loves?  Knowest thou not that he is\nnow of age?  Because he wears his years so lightly must he seem to thee\never but a child?  Wilt thou for ever thus pry into the [79] pastimes\nof thy son, always accusing his wantonness, and blaming in him those\ndelicate wiles which are all thine own?\" Thus, in secret fear of the\nboy's bow, did they seek to please him with their gracious patronage.\nBut Venus, angry at their light taking of her wrongs, turned her back\nupon them, and with hasty steps made her way once more to the sea.\n\nMeanwhile Psyche, tost in soul, wandering hither and thither, rested\nnot night or day in the pursuit of her husband, desiring, if she might\nnot sooth his anger by the endearments of a wife, at the least to\npropitiate him with the prayers of a handmaid.  And seeing a certain\ntemple on the top of a high mountain, she said, \"Who knows whether\nyonder place be not the abode of my lord?\"  Thither, therefore, she\nturned her steps, hastening now the more because desire and hope\npressed her on, weary as she was with the labours of the way, and so,\npainfully measuring out the highest ridges of the mountain, drew near\nto the sacred couches.  She sees ears of wheat, in heaps or twisted\ninto chaplets; ears of barley also, with sickles and all the\ninstruments of harvest, lying there in disorder, thrown at random from\nthe hands of the labourers in the great heat.  These she curiously sets\napart, one by one, duly ordering them; for she said within herself, \"I\nmay not neglect the shrines, nor the holy service, of any god there be,\nbut must rather [80] win by supplication the kindly mercy of them all.\"\n\nAnd Ceres found her bending sadly upon her task, and cried aloud,\n\"Alas, Psyche!  Venus, in the furiousness of her anger, tracks thy\nfootsteps through the world, seeking for thee to pay her the utmost\npenalty; and thou, thinking of anything rather than thine own safety,\nhast taken on thee the care of what belongs to me!\"  Then Psyche fell\ndown at her feet, and sweeping the floor with her hair, washing the\nfootsteps of the goddess in her tears, besought her mercy, with many\nprayers:--\"By the gladdening rites of harvest, by the lighted lamps and\nmystic marches of the Marriage and mysterious Invention of thy daughter\nProserpine, and by all beside that the holy place of Attica veils in\nsilence, minister, I pray thee, to the sorrowful heart of Psyche!\nSuffer me to hide myself but for a few days among the heaps of corn,\ntill time have softened the anger of the goddess, and my strength,\nout-worn in my long travail, be recovered by a little rest.\"\n\nBut Ceres answered her, \"Truly thy tears move me, and I would fain help\nthee; only I dare not incur the ill-will of my kinswoman. Depart hence\nas quickly as may be.\"  And Psyche, repelled against hope, afflicted\nnow with twofold sorrow, making her way back again, beheld among the\nhalf-lighted woods of the valley below a sanctuary builded with cunning\n[81] art.  And that she might lose no way of hope, howsoever doubtful,\nshe drew near to the sacred doors.  She sees there gifts of price, and\ngarments fixed upon the door-posts and to the branches of the trees,\nwrought with letters of gold which told the name of the goddess to whom\nthey were dedicated, with thanksgiving for that she had done.  So, with\nbent knee and hands laid about the glowing altar, she prayed saying,\n\"Sister and spouse of Jupiter! be thou to these my desperate fortune's\nJuno the Auspicious!  I know that thou dost willingly help those in\ntravail with child; deliver me from the peril that is upon me.\"  And as\nshe prayed thus, Juno in the majesty of her godhead, was straightway\npresent, and answered, \"Would that I might incline favourably to thee;\nbut against the will of Venus, whom I have ever loved as a daughter, I\nmay not, for very shame, grant thy prayer.\"\n\nAnd Psyche, dismayed by this new shipwreck of her hope, communed thus\nwith herself, \"Whither, from the midst of the snares that beset me,\nshall I take my way once more?  In what dark solitude shall I hide me\nfrom the all-seeing eye of Venus?  What if I put on at length a man's\ncourage, and yielding myself unto her as my mistress, soften by a\nhumility not yet too late the fierceness of her purpose?  Who knows but\nthat I may find him also whom my soul seeketh after, in the abode of\nhis mother?\"\n\n[82] And Venus, renouncing all earthly aid in her search, prepared to\nreturn to heaven.  She ordered the chariot to be made ready, wrought\nfor her by Vulcan as a marriage-gift, with a cunning of hand which had\nleft his work so much the richer by the weight of gold it lost under\nhis tool.  From the multitude which housed about the bed-chamber of\ntheir mistress, white doves came forth, and with joyful motions bent\ntheir painted necks beneath the yoke.  Behind it, with playful riot,\nthe sparrows sped onward, and other birds sweet of song, making known\nby their soft notes the approach of the goddess. Eagle and cruel hawk\nalarmed not the quireful family of Venus.  And the clouds broke away,\nas the uttermost ether opened to receive her, daughter and goddess,\nwith great joy.\n\nAnd Venus passed straightway to the house of Jupiter to beg from him\nthe service of Mercury, the god of speech.  And Jupiter refused not her\nprayer.  And Venus and Mercury descended from heaven together; and as\nthey went, the former said to the latter, \"Thou knowest, my brother of\nArcady, that never at any time have I done anything without thy help;\nfor how long time, moreover, I have sought a certain maiden in vain.\nAnd now naught remains but that, by thy heraldry, I proclaim a reward\nfor whomsoever shall find her.  Do thou my bidding quickly.\"  And\ntherewith [83] she conveyed to him a little scrip, in the which was\nwritten the name of Psyche, with other things; and so returned home.\n\nAnd Mercury failed not in his office; but departing into all lands,\nproclaimed that whosoever delivered up to Venus the fugitive girl,\nshould receive from herself seven kisses--one thereof full of the\ninmost honey of her throat.  With that the doubt of Psyche was ended.\nAnd now, as she came near to the doors of Venus, one of the household,\nwhose name was Use-and-Wont, ran out to her, crying, \"Hast thou\nlearned, Wicked Maid! now at last! that thou hast a mistress?\" And\nseizing her roughly by the hair, drew her into the presence of Venus.\nAnd when Venus saw her, she cried out, saying, \"Thou hast deigned then\nto make thy salutations to thy mother-in-law.  Now will I in turn treat\nthee as becometh a dutiful daughter-in-law!\"\n\nAnd she took barley and millet and poppy-seed, every kind of grain and\nseed, and mixed them together, and laughed, and said to her: \"Methinks\nso plain a maiden can earn lovers only by industrious ministry: now\nwill I also make trial of thy service.  Sort me this heap of seed, the\none kind from the others, grain by grain; and get thy task done before\nthe evening.\"  And Psyche, stunned by the cruelty of her bidding, was\nsilent, and moved not her hand to the inextricable heap.  And there\ncame [84] forth a little ant, which had understanding of the difficulty\nof her task, and took pity upon the consort of the god of Love; and he\nran deftly hither and thither, and called together the whole army of\nhis fellows.  \"Have pity,\" he cried, \"nimble scholars of the Earth,\nMother of all things!--have pity upon the wife of Love, and hasten to\nhelp her in her perilous effort.\"  Then, one upon the other, the hosts\nof the insect people hurried together; and they sorted asunder the\nwhole heap of seed, separating every grain after its kind, and so\ndeparted quickly out of sight.\n\nAnd at nightfall Venus returned, and seeing that task finished with so\nwonderful diligence, she cried, \"The work is not thine, thou naughty\nmaid, but his in whose eyes thou hast found favour.\"  And calling her\nagain in the morning, \"See now the grove,\" she said, \"beyond yonder\ntorrent.  Certain sheep feed there, whose fleeces shine with gold.\nFetch me straightway a lock of that precious stuff, having gotten it as\nthou mayst.\"\n\nAnd Psyche went forth willingly, not to obey the command of Venus, but\neven to seek a rest from her labour in the depths of the river. But\nfrom the river, the green reed, lowly mother of music, spake to her: \"O\nPsyche! pollute not these waters by self-destruction, nor approach that\nterrible flock; for, as the heat groweth, they wax fierce.  Lie down\nunder yon plane-tree, till the [85] quiet of the river's breath have\nsoothed them.  Thereafter thou mayst shake down the fleecy gold from\nthe trees of the grove, for it holdeth by the leaves.\"\n\nAnd Psyche, instructed thus by the simple reed, in the humanity of its\nheart, filled her bosom with the soft golden stuff, and returned to\nVenus.  But the goddess smiled bitterly, and said to her, \"Well know I\nwho was the author of this thing also.  I will make further trial of\nthy discretion, and the boldness of thy heart.  Seest thou the utmost\npeak of yonder steep mountain?  The dark stream which flows down thence\nwaters the Stygian fields, and swells the flood of Cocytus.  Bring me\nnow, in this little urn, a draught from its innermost source.\"  And\ntherewith she put into her hands a vessel of wrought crystal.\n\nAnd Psyche set forth in haste on her way to the mountain, looking there\nat last to find the end of her hapless life.  But when she came to the\nregion which borders on the cliff that was showed to her, she\nunderstood the deadly nature of her task.  From a great rock, steep and\nslippery, a horrible river of water poured forth, falling straightway\nby a channel exceeding narrow into the unseen gulf below. And lo!\ncreeping from the rocks on either hand, angry serpents, with their long\nnecks and sleepless eyes.  The very waters found a voice and bade her\ndepart, in smothered cries of, Depart hence! and [86] What doest thou\nhere?  Look around thee! and Destruction is upon thee!  And then sense\nleft her, in the immensity of her peril, as one changed to stone.\n\nYet not even then did the distress of this innocent soul escape the\nsteady eye of a gentle providence.  For the bird of Jupiter spread his\nwings and took flight to her, and asked her, \"Didst thou think, simple\none, even thou! that thou couldst steal one drop of that relentless\nstream, the holy river of Styx, terrible even to the gods? But give me\nthine urn.\"  And the bird took the urn, and filled it at the source,\nand returned to her quickly from among the teeth of the serpents,\nbringing with him of the waters, all unwilling--nay! warning him to\ndepart away and not molest them.\n\nAnd she, receiving the urn with great joy, ran back quickly that she\nmight deliver it to Venus, and yet again satisfied not the angry\ngoddess.  \"My child!\" she said, \"in this one thing further must thou\nserve me.  Take now this tiny casket, and get thee down even unto hell,\nand deliver it to Proserpine.  Tell her that Venus would have of her\nbeauty so much at least as may suffice for but one day's use, that\nbeauty she possessed erewhile being foreworn and spoiled, through her\ntendance upon the sick-bed of her son; and be not slow in returning.\"\n\nAnd Psyche perceived there the last ebbing of her fortune--that she was\nnow thrust openly [87] upon death, who must go down, of her own motion,\nto Hades and the Shades.  And straightway she climbed to the top of an\nexceeding high tower, thinking within herself, \"I will cast myself down\nthence: so shall I descend most quickly into the kingdom of the dead.\"\nAnd the tower again, broke forth into speech: \"Wretched Maid!  Wretched\nMaid!  Wilt thou destroy thyself?  If the breath quit thy body, then\nwilt thou indeed go down into Hades, but by no means return hither.\nListen to me.  Among the pathless wilds not far from this place lies a\ncertain mountain, and therein one of hell's vent-holes.  Through the\nbreach a rough way lies open, following which thou wilt come, by\nstraight course, to the castle of Orcus.  And thou must not go\nempty-handed.  Take in each hand a morsel of barley-bread, soaked in\nhydromel; and in thy mouth two pieces of money.  And when thou shalt be\nnow well onward in the way of death, then wilt thou overtake a lame ass\nladen with wood, and a lame driver, who will pray thee reach him\ncertain cords to fasten the burden which is falling from the ass: but\nbe thou cautious to pass on in silence.  And soon as thou comest to the\nriver of the dead, Charon, in that crazy bark he hath, will put thee\nover upon the further side.  There is greed even among the dead: and\nthou shalt deliver to him, for the ferrying, one of those two pieces of\nmoney, in such wise that he take [88] it with his hand from between thy\nlips.  And as thou passest over the stream, a dead old man, rising on\nthe water, will put up to thee his mouldering hands, and pray thee draw\nhim into the ferry-boat.  But beware thou yield not to unlawful pity.\n\n\"When thou shalt be come over, and art upon the causeway, certain aged\nwomen, spinning, will cry to thee to lend thy hand to their work; and\nbeware again that thou take no part therein; for this also is the snare\nof Venus, whereby she would cause thee to cast away one at least of\nthose cakes thou bearest in thy hands.  And think not that a slight\nmatter; for the loss of either one of them will be to thee the losing\nof the light of day.  For a watch-dog exceeding fierce lies ever before\nthe threshold of that lonely house of Proserpine.  Close his mouth with\none of thy cakes; so shalt thou pass by him, and enter straightway into\nthe presence of Proserpine herself.  Then do thou deliver thy message,\nand taking what she shall give thee, return back again; offering to the\nwatch-dog the other cake, and to the ferryman that other piece of money\nthou hast in thy mouth.  After this manner mayst thou return again\nbeneath the stars. But withal, I charge thee, think not to look into,\nnor open, the casket thou bearest, with that treasure of the beauty of\nthe divine countenance hidden therein.\"\n\nSo spake the stones of the tower; and Psyche [89] delayed not, but\nproceeding diligently after the manner enjoined, entered into the house\nof Proserpine, at whose feet she sat down humbly, and would neither the\ndelicate couch nor that divine food the goddess offered her, but did\nstraightway the business of Venus.  And Proserpine filled the casket\nsecretly and shut the lid, and delivered it to Psyche, who fled\ntherewith from Hades with new strength.  But coming back into the light\nof day, even as she hasted now to the ending of her service, she was\nseized by a rash curiosity.  \"Lo! now,\" she said within herself, \"my\nsimpleness! who bearing in my hands the divine loveliness, heed not to\ntouch myself with a particle at least therefrom, that I may please the\nmore, by the favour of it, my fair one, my beloved.\"  Even as she\nspoke, she lifted the lid; and behold! within, neither beauty, nor\nanything beside, save sleep only, the sleep of the dead, which took\nhold upon her, filling all her members with its drowsy vapour, so that\nshe lay down in the way and moved not, as in the slumber of death.\n\nAnd Cupid being healed of his wound, because he would endure no longer\nthe absence of her he loved, gliding through the narrow window of the\nchamber wherein he was holden, his pinions being now repaired by a\nlittle rest, fled forth swiftly upon them, and coming to the place\nwhere Psyche was, shook that sleep away from her, and set him in his\nprison again, awaking her with the [90] innocent point of his arrow.\n\"Lo! thine old error again,\" he said, \"which had like once more to have\ndestroyed thee!  But do thou now what is lacking of the command of my\nmother: the rest shall be my care.\"  With these words, the lover rose\nupon the air; and being consumed inwardly with the greatness of his\nlove, penetrated with vehement wing into the highest place of heaven,\nto lay his cause before the father of the gods.  And the father of gods\ntook his hand in his, and kissed his face and said to him, \"At no time,\nmy son, hast thou regarded me with due honour. Often hast thou vexed my\nbosom, wherein lies the disposition of the stars, with those busy darts\nof thine.  Nevertheless, because thou hast grown up between these mine\nhands, I will accomplish thy desire.\"  And straightway he bade Mercury\ncall the gods together; and, the council-chamber being filled, sitting\nupon a high throne, \"Ye gods,\" he said, \"all ye whose names are in the\nwhite book of the Muses, ye know yonder lad.  It seems good to me that\nhis youthful heats should by some means be restrained.  And that all\noccasion may be taken from him, I would even confine him in the bonds\nof marriage. He has chosen and embraced a mortal maiden.  Let him have\nfruit of his love, and possess her for ever.\"\n\nThereupon he bade Mercury produce Psyche in heaven; and holding out to\nher his ambrosial cup, \"Take it,\" he said, \"and live for ever; [91] nor\nshall Cupid ever depart from thee.\"  And the gods sat down together to\nthe marriage-feast.\n\nOn the first couch lay the bridegroom, and Psyche in his bosom.  His\nrustic serving-boy bare the wine to Jupiter; and Bacchus to the rest.\nThe Seasons crimsoned all things with their roses.  Apollo sang to the\nlyre, while a little Pan prattled on his reeds, and Venus danced very\nsweetly to the soft music.  Thus, with due rites, did Psyche pass into\nthe power of Cupid; and from them was born the daughter whom men call\nVoluptas.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI: EUPHUISM\n\n[92] So the famous story composed itself in the memory of Marius, with\nan expression changed in some ways from the original and on the whole\ngraver.  The petulant, boyish Cupid of Apuleius was become more like\nthat \"Lord, of terrible aspect,\" who stood at Dante's bedside and wept,\nor had at least grown to the manly earnestness of the Er\u00c3\u00b4s of\nPraxiteles.  Set in relief amid the coarser matter of the book, this\nepisode of Cupid and Psyche served to combine many lines of meditation,\nalready familiar to Marius, into the ideal of a perfect imaginative\nlove, centered upon a type of beauty entirely flawless and clean--an\nideal which never wholly faded from his thoughts, though he valued it\nat various times in different degrees.  The human body in its beauty,\nas the highest potency of all the beauty of material objects, seemed to\nhim just then to be matter no longer, but, having taken celestial fire,\nto assert itself as indeed the true, though visible, [93] soul or\nspirit in things.  In contrast with that ideal, in all the pure\nbrilliancy, and as it were in the happy light, of youth and morning and\nthe springtide, men's actual loves, with which at many points the book\nbrings one into close contact, might appear to him, like the general\ntenor of their lives, to be somewhat mean and sordid.  The hiddenness\nof perfect things: a shrinking mysticism, a sentiment of diffidence\nlike that expressed in Psyche's so tremulous hope concerning the child\nto be born of the husband she had never yet seen--\"in the face of this\nlittle child, at the least, shall I apprehend thine\"--in hoc saltem\nparvulo cognoscam faciem tuam: the fatality which seems to haunt any\nsignal+ beauty, whether moral or physical, as if it were in itself\nsomething illicit and isolating: the suspicion and hatred it so often\nexcites in the vulgar:--these were some of the impressions, forming, as\nthey do, a constant tradition of somewhat cynical pagan experience,\nfrom Medusa and Helen downwards, which the old story enforced on him. A\nbook, like a person, has its fortunes with one; is lucky or unlucky in\nthe precise moment of its falling in our way, and often by some happy\naccident counts with us for something more than its independent value.\nThe Metamorphoses of Apuleius, coming to Marius just then, figured for\nhim as indeed The Golden Book: he felt a sort of personal gratitude to\nits writer, and saw in it doubtless [94] far more than was really there\nfor any other reader.  It occupied always a peculiar place in his\nremembrance, never quite losing its power in frequent return to it for\nthe revival of that first glowing impression.\n\nIts effect upon the elder youth was a more practical one: it stimulated\nthe literary ambition, already so strong a motive with him, by a signal\nexample of success, and made him more than ever an ardent,\nindefatigable student of words, of the means or instrument of the\nliterary art.  The secrets of utterance, of expression itself, of that\nthrough which alone any intellectual or spiritual power within one can\nactually take effect upon others, to over-awe or charm them to one's\nside, presented themselves to this ambitious lad in immediate connexion\nwith that desire for predominance, for the satisfaction of which\nanother might have relied on the acquisition and display of brilliant\nmilitary qualities.  In him, a fine instinctive sentiment of the exact\nvalue and power of words was connate with the eager longing for sway\nover his fellows.  He saw himself already a gallant and effective\nleader, innovating or conservative as occasion might require, in the\nrehabilitation of the mother-tongue, then fallen so tarnished and\nlanguid; yet the sole object, as he mused within himself, of the only\nsort of patriotic feeling proper, or possible, for one born of slaves.\nThe popular speech was gradually departing from the form [95] and rule\nof literary language, a language always and increasingly artificial.\nWhile the learned dialect was yearly becoming more and more barbarously\npedantic, the colloquial idiom, on the other hand, offered a thousand\nchance-tost gems of racy or picturesque expression, rejected or at\nleast ungathered by what claimed to be classical Latin.  The time was\ncoming when neither the pedants nor the people would really understand\nCicero; though there were some indeed, like this new writer, Apuleius,\nwho, departing from the custom of writing in Greek, which had been a\nfashionable affectation among the sprightlier wits since the days of\nHadrian, had written in the vernacular.\n\nThe literary programme which Flavian had already designed for himself\nwould be a work, then, partly conservative or reactionary, in its\ndealing with the instrument of the literary art; partly popular and\nrevolutionary, asserting, so to term them, the rights of the\nproletariate of speech.  More than fifty years before, the younger\nPliny, himself an effective witness for the delicate power of the Latin\ntongue, had said,--\"I am one of those who admire the ancients, yet I do\nnot, like some others, underrate certain instances of genius which our\nown times afford.  For it is not true that nature, as if weary and\neffete, no longer produces what is admirable.\"  And he, Flavian, would\nprove himself the true master of the opportunity thus indicated.  In\n[96] his eagerness for a not too distant fame, he dreamed over all\nthat, as the young Caesar may have dreamed of campaigns.  Others might\nbrutalise or neglect the native speech, that true \"open field\" for\ncharm and sway over men.  He would make of it a serious study, weighing\nthe precise power of every phrase and word, as though it were precious\nmetal, disentangling the later associations and going back to the\noriginal and native sense of each,--restoring to full significance all\nits wealth of latent figurative expression, reviving or replacing its\noutworn or tarnished images.  Latin literature and the Latin tongue\nwere dying of routine and languor; and what was necessary, first of\nall, was to re-establish the natural and direct relationship between\nthought and expression, between the sensation and the term, and restore\nto words their primitive power.\n\nFor words, after all, words manipulated with all his delicate force,\nwere to be the apparatus of a war for himself.  To be forcibly\nimpressed, in the first place; and in the next, to find the means of\nmaking visible to others that which was vividly apparent, delightful,\nof lively interest to himself, to the exclusion of all that was but\nmiddling, tame, or only half-true even to him--this scrupulousness of\nliterary art actually awoke in Flavian, for the first time, a sort of\nchivalrous conscience.  What care for style! what patience of\nexecution! what research for the significant [97] tones of ancient\nidiom--sonantia verba et antiqua!  What stately and regular\nword-building--gravis et decora constructio!  He felt the whole meaning\nof the sceptical Pliny's somewhat melancholy advice to one of his\nfriends, that he should seek in literature deliverance from\nmortality--ut studiis se literarum a mortalitate vindicet.  And there\nwas everything in the nature and the training of Marius to make him a\nfull participator in the hopes of such a new literary school, with\nFlavian for its leader.  In the refinements of that curious spirit, in\nits horror of profanities, its fastidious sense of a correctness in\nexternal form, there was something which ministered to the old ritual\ninterest, still surviving in him; as if here indeed were involved a\nkind of sacred service to the mother-tongue.\n\nHere, then, was the theory of Euphuism, as manifested in every age in\nwhich the literary conscience has been awakened to forgotten duties\ntowards language, towards the instrument of expression: in fact it does\nbut modify a little the principles of all effective expression at all\ntimes.  'Tis art's function to conceal itself: ars est celare\nartem:--is a saying, which, exaggerated by inexact quotation, has\nperhaps been oftenest and most confidently quoted by those who have had\nlittle literary or other art to conceal; and from the very beginning of\nprofessional literature, the \"labour of the file\"--a labour in the case\nof Plato, for instance, or Virgil, like [98] that of the oldest of\ngoldsmiths as described by Apuleius, enriching the work by far more\nthan the weight of precious metal it removed--has always had its\nfunction.  Sometimes, doubtless, as in later examples of it, this Roman\nEuphuism, determined at any cost to attain beauty in writing--es kallos\ngraphein+--might lapse into its characteristic fopperies or mannerisms,\ninto the \"defects of its qualities,\" in truth, not wholly unpleasing\nperhaps, or at least excusable, when looked at as but the toys (so\nCicero calls them), the strictly congenial and appropriate toys, of an\nassiduously cultivated age, which could not help being polite,\ncritical, self-conscious.  The mere love of novelty also had, of\ncourse, its part there: as with the Euphuism of the Elizabethan age,\nand of the modern French romanticists, its neologies were the ground of\none of the favourite charges against it; though indeed, as regards\nthese tricks of taste also, there is nothing new, but a quaint family\nlikeness rather, between the Euphuists of successive ages.  Here, as\nelsewhere, the power of \"fashion,\" as it is called, is but one minor\nform, slight enough, it may be, yet distinctly symptomatic, of that\ndeeper yearning of human nature towards ideal perfection, which is a\ncontinuous force in it; and since in this direction too human nature is\nlimited, such fashions must necessarily reproduce themselves. Among\nother resemblances to later growths of Euphuism, its archaisms on the\none hand, and [99]  its neologies on the other, the Euphuism of the\ndays of Marcus Aurelius had, in the composition of verse, its fancy for\nthe refrain.  It was a snatch from a popular chorus, something he had\nheard sounding all over the town of Pisa one April night, one of the\nfirst bland and summer-like nights of the year, that Flavian had chosen\nfor the refrain of a poem he was then pondering--the Pervigilium\nVeneris--the vigil, or \"nocturn,\" of Venus.\n\nCertain elderly counsellors, filling what may be thought a constant\npart in the little tragi-comedy which literature and its votaries are\nplaying in all ages, would ask, suspecting some affectation or\nunreality in that minute culture of form:--Cannot those who have a\nthing to say, say it directly?  Why not be simple and broad, like the\nold writers of Greece?  And this challenge had at least the effect of\nsetting his thoughts at work on the intellectual situation as it lay\nbetween the children of the present and those earliest masters.\nCertainly, the most wonderful, the unique, point, about the Greek\ngenius, in literature as in everything else, was the entire absence of\nimitation in its productions.  How had the burden of precedent, laid\nupon every artist, increased since then!  It was all around one:--that\nsmoothly built world of old classical taste, an accomplished fact, with\noverwhelming authority on every detail of the conduct of one's [100]\nwork.  With no fardel on its own back, yet so imperious towards those\nwho came labouring after it, Hellas, in its early freshness, looked as\ndistant from him even then as it does from ourselves.  There might seem\nto be no place left for novelty or originality,--place only for a\npatient, an infinite, faultlessness. On this question too Flavian\npassed through a world of curious art-casuistries, of self-tormenting,\nat the threshold of his work.  Was poetic beauty a thing ever one and\nthe same, a type absolute; or, changing always with the soul of time\nitself, did it depend upon the taste, the peculiar trick of\napprehension, the fashion, as we say, of each successive age?  Might\none recover that old, earlier sense of it, that earlier manner, in a\nmasterly effort to recall all the complexities of the life, moral and\nintellectual, of the earlier age to which it had belonged?  Had there\nbeen really bad ages in art or literature?  Were all ages, even those\nearliest, adventurous, matutinal days, in themselves equally poetical\nor unpoetical; and poetry, the literary beauty, the poetic ideal,\nalways but a borrowed light upon men's actual life?\n\nHomer had said--\n\n     Hoi d' hote d\u00c3\u00aa limenos polybentheos entos hikonto,\n     Histia men steilanto, thesan d' en n\u00c3\u00aai melain\u00c3\u00aa...\n     Ek de kai autoi bainon epi ph\u00c3\u00aagmini thalass\u00c3\u00aas.+\n\nAnd how poetic the simple incident seemed, told just thus!  Homer was\nalways telling [101] things after this manner.  And one might think\nthere had been no effort in it: that here was but the almost mechanical\ntranscript of a time, naturally, intrinsically, poetic, a time in which\none could hardly have spoken at all without ideal effect, or, the\nsailors pulled down their boat without making a picture in \"the great\nstyle,\" against a sky charged with marvels. Must not the mere prose of\nan age, itself thus ideal, have counted for more than half of Homer's\npoetry?  Or might the closer student discover even here, even in Homer,\nthe really mediatorial function of the poet, as between the reader and\nthe actual matter of his experience; the poet waiting, so to speak, in\nan age which had felt itself trite and commonplace enough, on his\nopportunity for the touch of \"golden alchemy,\" or at least for the\npleasantly lighted side of things themselves?  Might not another, in\none's own prosaic and used-up time, so uneventful as it had been\nthrough the long reign of these quiet Antonines, in like manner,\ndiscover his ideal, by a due waiting upon it?  Would not a future\ngeneration, looking back upon this, under the power of the\nenchanted-distance fallacy, find it ideal to view, in contrast with its\nown languor--the languor that for some reason (concerning which\nAugustine will one day have his view) seemed to haunt men always?  Had\nHomer, even, appeared unreal and affected in his poetic flight, to some\nof the people of his own age, [102] as seemed to happen with every new\nliterature in turn?  In any case, the intellectual conditions of early\nGreece had been--how different from these!  And a true literary tact\nwould accept that difference in forming the primary conception of the\nliterary function at a later time.  Perhaps the utmost one could get by\nconscious effort, in the way of a reaction or return to the conditions\nof an earlier and fresher age, would be but novitas, artificial\nartlessness, na\u00c3\u00afvet\u00c3\u00a9; and this quality too might have its measure of\neuphuistic charm, direct and sensible enough, though it must count, in\ncomparison with that genuine early Greek newness at the beginning, not\nas the freshness of the open fields, but only of a bunch of\nfield-flowers in a heated room.\n\nThere was, meantime, all this:--on one side, the old pagan culture, for\nus but a fragment, for him an accomplished yet present fact, still a\nliving, united, organic whole, in the entirety of its art, its thought,\nits religions, its sagacious forms of polity, that so weighty authority\nit exercised on every point, being in reality only the measure of its\ncharm for every one: on the other side, the actual world in all its\neager self-assertion, with Flavian himself, in his boundless animation,\nthere, at the centre of the situation.  From the natural defects, from\nthe pettiness, of his euphuism, his assiduous cultivation of manner, he\nwas saved by the consciousness that he had a matter to present, very\nreal, [103] at least to him.  That preoccupation of the dilettante with\nwhat might seem mere details of form, after all, did but serve the\npurpose of bringing to the surface, sincerely and in their integrity,\ncertain strong personal intuitions, a certain vision or apprehension of\nthings as really being, with important results, thus, rather than\nthus,--intuitions which the artistic or literary faculty was called\nupon to follow, with the exactness of wax or clay, clothing the model\nwithin. Flavian too, with his fine clear mastery of the practically\neffective, had early laid hold of the principle, as axiomatic in\nliterature: that to know when one's self is interested, is the first\ncondition of interesting other people.  It was a principle, the\nforcible apprehension of which made him jealous and fastidious in the\nselection of his intellectual food; often listless while others read or\ngazed diligently; never pretending to be moved out of mere complaisance\nto people's emotions: it served to foster in him a very scrupulous\nliterary sincerity with himself.  And it was this uncompromising demand\nfor a matter, in all art, derived immediately from lively personal\nintuition, this constant appeal to individual judgment, which saved his\neuphuism, even at its weakest, from lapsing into mere artifice.\n\nWas the magnificent exordium of Lucretius, addressed to the goddess\nVenus, the work of [104]  his earlier manhood, and designed originally\nto open an argument less persistently sombre than that protest against\nthe whole pagan heaven which actually follows it?  It is certainly the\nmost typical expression of a mood, still incident to the young poet, as\na thing peculiar to his youth, when he feels the sentimental current\nsetting forcibly along his veins, and so much as a matter of purely\nphysical excitement, that he can hardly distinguish it from the\nanimation of external nature, the upswelling of the seed in the earth,\nand of the sap through the trees.  Flavian, to whom, again, as to his\nlater euphuistic kinsmen, old mythology seemed as full of untried,\nunexpressed motives and interest as human life itself, had long been\noccupied with a kind of mystic hymn to the vernal principle of life in\nthings; a composition shaping itself, little by little, out of a\nthousand dim perceptions, into singularly definite form (definite and\nfirm as fine-art in metal, thought Marius) for which, as I said, he had\ncaught his \"refrain,\" from the lips of the young men, singing because\nthey could not help it, in the streets of Pisa.  And as oftenest\nhappens also, with natures of genuinely poetic quality, those piecemeal\nbeginnings came suddenly to harmonious completeness among the fortunate\nincidents, the physical heat and light, of one singularly happy day.\n\nIt was one of the first hot days of March--\"the sacred day\"--on which,\nfrom Pisa, as from [105] many another harbour on the Mediterranean, the\nShip of Isis went to sea, and every one walked down to the shore-side\nto witness the freighting of the vessel, its launching and final\nabandonment among the waves, as an object really devoted to the Great\nGoddess, that new rival, or \"double,\" of ancient Venus, and like her a\nfavourite patroness of sailors.  On the evening next before, all the\nworld had been abroad to view the illumination of the river; the\nstately lines of building being wreathed with hundreds of many-coloured\nlamps.  The young men had poured forth their chorus--\n\n     Cras amet qui nunquam amavit,\n     Quique amavit cras amet--\n\nas they bore their torches through the yielding crowd, or rowed their\nlanterned boats up and down the stream, till far into the night, when\nheavy rain-drops had driven the last lingerers home.  Morning broke,\nhowever, smiling and serene; and the long procession started betimes.\nThe river, curving slightly, with the smoothly paved streets on either\nside, between its low marble parapet and the fair dwelling-houses,\nformed the main highway of the city; and the pageant, accompanied\nthroughout by innumerable lanterns and wax tapers, took its course up\none of these streets, crossing the water by a bridge up-stream, and\ndown the other, to the haven, every possible standing-place, out of\ndoors [106] and within, being crowded with sight-seers, of whom Marius\nwas one of the most eager, deeply interested in finding the spectacle\nmuch as Apuleius had described it in his famous book.\n\nAt the head of the procession, the master of ceremonies, quietly waving\nback the assistants, made way for a number of women, scattering\nperfumes.  They were succeeded by a company of musicians, piping and\ntwanging, on instruments the strangest Marius had ever beheld, the\nnotes of a hymn, narrating the first origin of this votive rite to a\nchoir of youths, who marched behind them singing it. The tire-women and\nother personal attendants of the great goddess came next, bearing the\ninstruments of their ministry, and various articles from the sacred\nwardrobe, wrought of the most precious material; some of them with long\nivory combs, plying their hands in wild yet graceful concert of\nmovement as they went, in devout mimicry of the toilet.  Placed in\ntheir rear were the mirror-bearers of the goddess, carrying large\nmirrors of beaten brass or silver, turned in such a way as to reflect\nto the great body of worshippers who followed, the face of the\nmysterious image, as it moved on its way, and their faces to it, as\nthough they were in fact advancing to meet the heavenly visitor.  They\ncomprehended a multitude of both sexes and of all ages, already\ninitiated into the divine secret, clad in fair linen, the females\nveiled, the males with shining [107] tonsures, and every one carrying a\nsistrum--the richer sort of silver, a few very dainty persons of fine\ngold--rattling the reeds, with a noise like the jargon of innumerable\nbirds and insects awakened from torpor and abroad in the spring sun.\nThen, borne upon a kind of platform, came the goddess herself,\nundulating above the heads of the multitude as the bearers walked, in\nmystic robe embroidered with the moon and stars, bordered gracefully\nwith a fringe of real fruit and flowers, and with a glittering crown\nupon the head.  The train of the procession consisted of the priests in\nlong white vestments, close from head to foot, distributed into various\ngroups, each bearing, exposed aloft, one of the sacred symbols of\nIsis--the corn-fan, the golden asp, the ivory hand of equity, and among\nthem the votive ship itself, carved and gilt, and adorned bravely with\nflags flying.  Last of all walked the high priest; the people kneeling\nas he passed to kiss his hand, in which were those well-remembered\nroses.\n\nMarius followed with the rest to the harbour, where the mystic ship,\nlowered from the shoulders of the priests, was loaded with as much as\nit could carry of the rich spices and other costly gifts, offered in\ngreat profusion by the worshippers, and thus, launched at last upon the\nwater, left the shore, crossing the harbour-bar in the wake of a much\nstouter vessel than itself with a crew of white-robed mariners, whose\n[108] function it was, at the appointed moment, finally to desert it on\nthe open sea.\n\nThe remainder of the day was spent by most in parties on the water.\nFlavian and Marius sailed further than they had ever done before to a\nwild spot on the bay, the traditional site of a little Greek colony,\nwhich, having had its eager, stirring life at the time when Etruria was\nstill a power in Italy, had perished in the age of the civil wars.  In\nthe absolute transparency of the air on this gracious day, an\ninfinitude of detail from sea and shore reached the eye with sparkling\nclearness, as the two lads sped rapidly over the waves--Flavian at work\nsuddenly, from time to time, with his tablets.  They reached land at\nlast.  The coral fishers had spread their nets on the sands, with a\ntumble-down of quaint, many-hued treasures, below a little shrine of\nVenus, fluttering and gay with the scarves and napkins and gilded\nshells which these people had offered to the image.  Flavian and Marius\nsat down under the shadow of a mass of gray rock or ruin, where the\nsea-gate of the Greek town had been, and talked of life in those old\nGreek colonies.  Of this place, all that remained, besides those rude\nstones, was--a handful of silver coins, each with a head of pure and\narchaic beauty, though a little cruel perhaps, supposed to represent\nthe Siren Ligeia, whose tomb was formerly shown here--only these, and\nan ancient song, the very strain which Flavian [109] had recovered in\nthose last months.  They were records which spoke, certainly, of the\ncharm of life within those walls.  How strong must have been the tide\nof men's existence in that little republican town, so small that this\ncircle of gray stones, of service now only by the moisture they\ngathered for the blue-flowering gentians among them, had been the line\nof its rampart!  An epitome of all that was liveliest, most animated\nand adventurous, in the old Greek people of which it was an offshoot,\nit had enhanced the effect of these gifts by concentration within\nnarrow limits.  The band of \"devoted youth,\"--hiera neot\u00c3\u00aas.+--of the\nyounger brothers, devoted to the gods and whatever luck the gods might\nafford, because there was no room for them at home--went forth, bearing\nthe sacred flame from the mother hearth; itself a flame, of power to\nconsume the whole material of existence in clear light and heat, with\nno smouldering residue. The life of those vanished townsmen, so\nbrilliant and revolutionary, applying so abundantly the personal\nqualities which alone just then Marius seemed to value, associated\nitself with the actual figure of his companion, standing there before\nhim, his face enthusiastic with the sudden thought of all that; and\nstruck him vividly as precisely the fitting opportunity for a nature\nlike his, so hungry for control, for ascendency over men.\n\nMarius noticed also, however, as high spirits [110] flagged at last, on\nthe way home through the heavy dew of the evening, more than physical\nfatigue in Flavian, who seemed to find no refreshment in the coolness.\nThere had been something feverish, perhaps, and like the beginning of\nsickness, about his almost forced gaiety, in this sudden spasm of\nspring; and by the evening of the next day he was lying with a burning\nspot on his forehead, stricken, as was thought from the first, by the\nterrible new disease.\n\nNOTES\n\n93. +Corrected from the Macmillan edition misprint \"singal.\"\n\n98. +Transliteration: es kallos graphein.

People actually\nsickened at a sudden touch of the unsuspected foe, as they watched in\ndense crowds the pathetic or grotesque imagery of failure or success in\nthe triumphal procession.  And, as usual, the plague brought with it a\npower to develop all pre-existent germs of superstition.  It was by\ndishonour done to Apollo himself, said popular rumour--to Apollo, the\nold titular divinity of pestilence, that the poisonous thing had come\nabroad.  Pent up in a golden coffer consecrated to the god, it had\nescaped in the sacrilegious plundering of his temple at Seleucia by the\nsoldiers of Lucius Verus, after a traitorous surprise of that town and\na cruel massacre.  Certainly there was something which baffled all\nimaginable precautions and all medical science, in the suddenness [112]\nwith which the disease broke out simultaneously, here and there, among\nboth soldiers and citizens, even in places far remote from the main\nline of its march in the rear of the victorious army.  It seemed to\nhave invaded the whole empire, and some have even thought that, in a\nmitigated form, it permanently remained there.  In Rome itself many\nthousands perished; and old authorities tell of farmsteads, whole\ntowns, and even entire neighbourhoods, which from that time continued\nwithout inhabitants and lapsed into wildness or ruin.\n\nFlavian lay at the open window of his lodging, with a fiery pang in the\nbrain, fancying no covering thin or light enough to be applied to his\nbody.  His head being relieved after a while, there was distress at the\nchest.  It was but the fatal course of the strange new sickness, under\nmany disguises; travelling from the brain to the feet, like a material\nresident, weakening one after another of the organic centres; often,\nwhen it did not kill, depositing various degrees of lifelong infirmity\nin this member or that; and after such descent, returning upwards\nagain, now as a mortal coldness, leaving the entrenchments of the\nfortress of life overturned, one by one, behind it.\n\nFlavian lay there, with the enemy at his breast now in a painful cough,\nbut relieved from that burning fever in the head, amid the rich-scented\nflowers--rare Paestum roses, and the like [113] --procured by Marius\nfor his solace, in a fancied convalescence; and would, at intervals,\nreturn to labour at his verses, with a great eagerness to complete and\ntranscribe the work, while Marius sat and wrote at his dictation, one\nof the latest but not the poorest specimens of genuine Latin poetry.\n\nIt was in fact a kind of nuptial hymn, which, taking its start from the\nthought of nature as the universal mother, celebrated the preliminary\npairing and mating together of all fresh things, in the hot and genial\nspring-time--the immemorial nuptials of the soul of spring itself and\nthe brown earth; and was full of a delighted, mystic sense of what\npassed between them in that fantastic marriage. That mystic burden was\nrelieved, at intervals, by the familiar playfulness of the Latin\nverse-writer in dealing with mythology, which, though coming at so late\na day, had still a wonderful freshness in its old age.--\"Amor has put\nhis weapons by and will keep holiday.  He was bidden go without\napparel, that none might be wounded by his bow and arrows.  But take\ncare!  In truth he is none the less armed than usual, though he be all\nunclad.\"\n\nIn the expression of all this Flavian seemed, while making it his chief\naim to retain the opulent, many-syllabled vocabulary of the Latin\ngenius, at some points even to have advanced beyond it, in anticipation\nof wholly new laws of [114] taste as regards sound, a new range of\nsound itself.  The peculiar resultant note, associating itself with\ncertain other experiences of his, was to Marius like the foretaste of\nan entirely novel world of poetic beauty to come. Flavian had caught,\nindeed, something of the rhyming cadence, the sonorous organ-music of\nthe medieval Latin, and therewithal something of its unction and\nmysticity of spirit.  There was in his work, along with the last\nsplendour of the classical language, a touch, almost prophetic, of that\ntransformed life it was to have in the rhyming middle age, just about\nto dawn.  The impression thus forced upon Marius connected itself with\na feeling, the exact inverse of that, known to every one, which seems\nto say, You have been just here, just thus, before!--a feeling, in his\ncase, not reminiscent but prescient of the future, which passed over\nhim afterwards many times, as he came across certain places and people.\nIt was as if he detected there the process of actual change to a wholly\nundreamed-of and renewed condition of human body and soul: as if he saw\nthe heavy yet decrepit old Roman architecture about him, rebuilding on\nan intrinsically better pattern.  Could it have been actually on a new\nmusical instrument that Flavian had first heard the novel accents of\nhis verse?  And still Marius noticed there, amid all its richness of\nexpression and imagery, that firmness of outline he had always relished\nso much in the composition of [115] Flavian.  Yes! a firmness like that\nof some master of noble metal-work, manipulating tenacious bronze or\ngold.  Even now that haunting refrain, with its impromptu variations,\nfrom the throats of those strong young men, came floating through the\nwindow.\n\n     Cras amet qui nunquam amavit,\n     Quique amavit cras amet!\n\n--repeated Flavian, tremulously, dictating yet one stanza more.\n\nWhat he was losing, his freehold of a soul and body so fortunately\nendowed, the mere liberty of life above-ground, \"those sunny mornings\nin the cornfields by the sea,\" as he recollected them one day, when the\nwindow was thrown open upon the early freshness--his sense of all this,\nwas from the first singularly near and distinct, yet rather as of\nsomething he was but debarred the use of for a time than finally\nbidding farewell to.  That was while he was still with no very grave\nmisgivings as to the issue of his sickness, and felt the sources of\nlife still springing essentially unadulterate within him.  From time to\ntime, indeed, Marius, labouring eagerly at the poem from his dictation,\nwas haunted by a feeling of the triviality of such work just then.  The\nrecurrent sense of some obscure danger beyond the mere danger of death,\nvaguer than that and by so much the more terrible, like the menace of\nsome shadowy [116] adversary in the dark with whose mode of attack they\nhad no acquaintance, disturbed him now and again through those hours of\nexcited attention to his manuscript, and to the purely physical wants\nof Flavian.  Still, during these three days there was much hope and\ncheerfulness, and even jesting. Half-consciously Marius tried to\nprolong one or another relieving circumstance of the day, the\npreparations for rest and morning refreshment, for instance; sadly\nmaking the most of the little luxury of this or that, with something of\nthe feigned cheer of the mother who sets her last morsels before her\nfamished child as for a feast, but really that he \"may eat it and die.\"\n\nOn the afternoon of the seventh day he allowed Marius finally to put\naside the unfinished manuscript.  For the enemy, leaving the chest\nquiet at length though much exhausted, had made itself felt with full\npower again in a painful vomiting, which seemed to shake his body\nasunder, with great consequent prostration.  From that time the\ndistress increased rapidly downwards.  Omnia tum vero vitai claustra\nlababant;+ and soon the cold was mounting with sure pace from the dead\nfeet to the head.\n\nAnd now Marius began more than to suspect what the issue must be, and\nhenceforward could but watch with a sort of agonised fascination the\nrapid but systematic work of the destroyer, [117] faintly relieving a\nlittle the mere accidents of the sharper forms of suffering.  Flavian\nhimself appeared, in full consciousness at last--in clear-sighted,\ndeliberate estimate of the actual crisis--to be doing battle with his\nadversary.  His mind surveyed, with great distinctness, the various\nsuggested modes of relief.  He must without fail get better, he would\nfancy, might he be removed to a certain place on the hills where as a\nchild he had once recovered from sickness, but found that he could\nscarcely raise his head from the pillow without giddiness.  As if now\nsurely foreseeing the end, he would set himself, with an eager effort,\nand with that eager and angry look, which is noted as one of the\npremonitions of death in this disease, to fashion out, without formal\ndictation, still a few more broken verses of his unfinished work, in\nhard-set determination, defiant of pain, to arrest this or that little\ndrop at least from the river of sensuous imagery rushing so quickly\npast him.\n\nBut at length delirium--symptom that the work of the plague was done,\nand the last resort of life yielding to the enemy--broke the coherent\norder of words and thoughts; and Marius, intent on the coming agony,\nfound his best hope in the increasing dimness of the patient's mind. In\nintervals of clearer consciousness the visible signs of cold, of sorrow\nand desolation, were very painful.  No longer battling with the\ndisease, he seemed as it were to place himself [118] at the disposal of\nthe victorious foe, dying passively, like some dumb creature, in\nhopeless acquiescence at last.  That old, half-pleading petulance,\nunamiable, yet, as it might seem, only needing conditions of life a\nlittle happier than they had actually been, to become refinement of\naffection, a delicate grace in its demand on the sympathy of others,\nhad changed in those moments of full intelligence to a clinging and\ntremulous gentleness, as he lay--\"on the very threshold of death\"--with\na sharply contracted hand in the hand of Marius, to his almost\nsurprised joy, winning him now to an absolutely self-forgetful\ndevotion.  There was a new sort of pleading in the misty eyes, just\nbecause they took such unsteady note of him, which made Marius feel as\nif guilty; anticipating thus a form of self-reproach with which even\nthe tenderest ministrant may be sometimes surprised, when, at death,\naffectionate labour suddenly ceasing leaves room for the suspicion of\nsome failure of love perhaps, at one or another minute point in it.\nMarius almost longed to take his share in the suffering, that he might\nunderstand so the better how to relieve it.\n\nIt seemed that the light of the lamp distressed the patient, and Marius\nextinguished it.  The thunder which had sounded all day among the\nhills, with a heat not unwelcome to Flavian, had given way at nightfall\nto steady rain; and [119] in the darkness Marius lay down beside him,\nfaintly shivering now in the sudden cold, to lend him his own warmth,\nundeterred by the fear of contagion which had kept other people from\npassing near the house.  At length about day-break he perceived that\nthe last effort had come with a revival of mental clearness, as Marius\nunderstood by the contact, light as it was, in recognition of him\nthere.  \"Is it a comfort,\" he whispered then, \"that I shall often come\nand weep over you?\"--\"Not unless I be aware, and hear you weeping!\"\n\nThe sun shone out on the people going to work for a long hot day, and\nMarius was standing by the dead, watching, with deliberate purpose to\nfix in his memory every detail, that he might have this picture in\nreserve, should any hour of forgetfulness hereafter come to him with\nthe temptation to feel completely happy again.  A feeling of outrage,\nof resentment against nature itself, mingled with an agony of pity, as\nhe noted on the now placid features a certain look of humility, almost\nabject, like the expression of a smitten child or animal, as of one,\nfallen at last, after bewildering struggle, wholly under the power of a\nmerciless adversary.  From mere tenderness of soul he would not forget\none circumstance in all that; as a man might piously stamp on his\nmemory the death-scene of a brother wrongfully condemned to die,\nagainst a time that may come.\n\n[120] The fear of the corpse, which surprised him in his effort to\nwatch by it through the darkness, was a hint of his own failing\nstrength, just in time.  The first night after the washing of the body,\nhe bore stoutly enough the tax which affection seemed to demand,\nthrowing the incense from time to time on the little altar placed\nbeside the bier.  It was the recurrence of the thing--that unchanged\noutline below the coverlet, amid a silence in which the faintest rustle\nseemed to speak--that finally overcame his determination.  Surely,\nhere, in this alienation, this sense of distance between them, which\nhad come over him before though in minor degree when the mind of\nFlavian had wandered in his sickness, was another of the pains of\ndeath.  Yet he was able to make all due preparations, and go through\nthe ceremonies, shortened a little because of the infection, when, on a\ncloudless evening, the funeral procession went forth; himself, the\nflames of the pyre having done their work, carrying away the urn of the\ndeceased, in the folds of his toga, to its last resting-place in the\ncemetery beside the highway, and so turning home to sleep in his own\ndesolate lodging.\n\n     Quis desiderio sit pudor aut modus\n         Tam cari capitis?--+\n\nWhat thought of others' thoughts about one could there be with the\nregret for \"so dear a head\" fresh at one's heart?\n\nNOTES\n\n116. +Lucretius, Book VI.1153.\n\n120. +Horace, Odes I.xxiv.1-2.\n\n\n\nPART THE SECOND\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII: ANIMULA VAGULA\n\n     Animula, vagula, blandula\n     Hospes comesque corporis,\n     Quae nunc abibis in loca?\n     Pallidula, rigida, nudula.\n\n            The Emperor Hadrian to his Soul\n\n[123] FLAVIAN was no more.  The little marble chest with its dust and\ntears lay cold among the faded flowers.  For most people the actual\nspectacle of death brings out into greater reality, at least for the\nimagination, whatever confidence they may entertain of the soul's\nsurvival in another life.  To Marius, greatly agitated by that event,\nthe earthly end of Flavian came like a final revelation of nothing less\nthan the soul's extinction.  Flavian had gone out as utterly as the\nfire among those still beloved ashes.  Even that wistful suspense of\njudgment expressed by the dying Hadrian, regarding further stages of\nbeing still possible for the soul in some dim journey hence, seemed\nwholly untenable, and, with it, almost all that remained of the\nreligion of his childhood.  Future extinction seemed just then [124] to\nbe what the unforced witness of his own nature pointed to. On the other\nhand, there came a novel curiosity as to what the various schools of\nancient philosophy had had to say concerning that strange, fluttering\ncreature; and that curiosity impelled him to certain severe studies, in\nwhich his earlier religious conscience seemed still to survive, as a\nprinciple of hieratic scrupulousness or integrity of thought, regarding\nthis new service to intellectual light.\n\nAt this time, by his poetic and inward temper, he might have fallen a\nprey to the enervating mysticism, then in wait for ardent souls in many\na melodramatic revival of old religion or theosophy.  From all this,\nfascinating as it might actually be to one side of his character, he\nwas kept by a genuine virility there, effective in him, among other\nresults, as a hatred of what was theatrical, and the instinctive\nrecognition that in vigorous intelligence, after all, divinity was most\nlikely to be found a resident.  With this was connected the feeling,\nincreasing with his advance to manhood, of a poetic beauty in mere\nclearness of thought, the actually aesthetic charm of a cold austerity\nof mind; as if the kinship of that to the clearness of physical light\nwere something more than a figure of speech.  Of all those various\nreligious fantasies, as so many forms of enthusiasm, he could well\nappreciate the picturesque; that was made easy by his natural\nEpicureanism, already prompting [125] him to conceive of himself as but\nthe passive spectator of the world around him.  But it was to the\nseverer reasoning, of which such matters as Epicurean theory are born,\nthat, in effect, he now betook himself. Instinctively suspicious of\nthose mechanical arcana, those pretended \"secrets unveiled\" of the\nprofessional mystic, which really bring great and little souls to one\nlevel, for Marius the only possible dilemma lay between that old,\nancestral Roman religion, now become so incredible to him and the\nhonest action of his own untroubled, unassisted intelligence.  Even the\nArcana Celestia of Platonism--what the sons of Plato had had to say\nregarding the essential indifference of pure soul to its bodily house\nand merely occasional dwelling-place--seemed to him while his heart was\nthere in the urn with the material ashes of Flavian, or still lingering\nin memory over his last agony, wholly inhuman or morose, as tending to\nalleviate his resentment at nature's wrong.  It was to the sentiment of\nthe body, and the affections it defined--the flesh, of whose force and\ncolour that wandering Platonic soul was but so frail a residue or\nabstract--he must cling.  The various pathetic traits of the beloved,\nsuffering, perished body of Flavian, so deeply pondered, had made him a\nmaterialist, but with something of the temper of a devotee.\n\nAs a consequence it might have seemed at first that his care for poetry\nhad passed away, [126] to be replaced by the literature of thought. His\nmuch-pondered manuscript verses were laid aside; and what happened now\nto one, who was certainly to be something of a poet from first to last,\nlooked at the moment like a change from poetry to prose.  He came of\nage about this time, his own master though with beardless face; and at\neighteen, an age at which, then as now, many youths of capacity, who\nfancied themselves poets, secluded themselves from others chiefly in\naffectation and vague dreaming, he secluded himself indeed from others,\nbut in a severe intellectual meditation, that salt of poetry, without\nwhich all the more serious charm is lacking to the imaginative world.\nStill with something of the old religious earnestness of his childhood,\nhe set himself--Sich im Denken zu orientiren--to determine his\nbearings, as by compass, in the world of thought--to get that precise\nacquaintance with the creative intelligence itself, its structure and\ncapacities, its relation to other parts of himself and to other things,\nwithout which, certainly, no poetry can be masterly.  Like a young man\nrich in this world's goods coming of age, he must go into affairs, and\nascertain his outlook.  There must be no disguises.  An exact estimate\nof realities, as towards himself, he must have--a delicately measured\ngradation of certainty in things--from the distant, haunted horizon of\nmere surmise or imagination, to the actual [127] feeling of sorrow in\nhis heart, as he reclined one morning, alone instead of in pleasant\ncompany, to ponder the hard sayings of an imperfect old Greek\nmanuscript, unrolled beside him.  His former gay companions, meeting\nhim in the streets of the old Italian town, and noting the graver lines\ncoming into the face of the sombre but enthusiastic student of\nintellectual structure, who could hold his own so well in the society\nof accomplished older men, were half afraid of him, though proud to\nhave him of their company.  Why this reserve?--they asked, concerning\nthe orderly, self-possessed youth, whose speech and carriage seemed so\ncarefully measured, who was surely no poet like the rapt, dishevelled\nLupus.  Was he secretly in love, perhaps, whose toga was so daintily\nfolded, and who was always as fresh as the flowers he wore; or bent on\nhis own line of ambition: or even on riches?\n\nMarius, meantime, was reading freely, in early morning for the most\npart, those writers chiefly who had made it their business to know what\nmight be thought concerning that strange, enigmatic, personal essence,\nwhich had seemed to go out altogether, along with the funeral fires.\nAnd the old Greek who more than any other was now giving form to his\nthoughts was a very hard master.  From Epicurus, from the thunder and\nlightning of Lucretius--like thunder and lightning some distance off,\none might recline to enjoy, in a garden of roses--he had gone back to\n[128] the writer who was in a certain sense the teacher of both,\nHeraclitus of Ionia.  His difficult book \"Concerning Nature\" was even\nthen rare, for people had long since satisfied themselves by the\nquotation of certain brilliant, isolated, oracles only, out of what was\nat best a taxing kind of lore.  But the difficulty of the early Greek\nprose did but spur the curiosity of Marius; the writer, the superior\nclearness of whose intellectual view had so sequestered him from other\nmen, who had had so little joy of that superiority, being avowedly\nexacting as to the amount of devout attention he required from the\nstudent.  \"The many,\" he said, always thus emphasising the difference\nbetween the many and the few, are \"like people heavy with wine,\" \"led\nby children,\" \"knowing not whither they go;\" and yet, \"much learning\ndoth not make wise;\" and again, \"the ass, after all, would have his\nthistles rather than fine gold.\"\n\nHeraclitus, indeed, had not under-rated the difficulty for \"the many\"\nof the paradox with which his doctrine begins, and the due reception of\nwhich must involve a denial of habitual impressions, as the necessary\nfirst step in the way of truth.  His philosophy had been developed in\nconscious, outspoken opposition to the current mode of thought, as a\nmatter requiring some exceptional loyalty to pure reason and its \"dry\nlight.\"  Men are subject to an illusion, he protests, regarding matters\napparent to sense. [129] What the uncorrected sense gives was a false\nimpression of permanence or fixity in things, which have really changed\ntheir nature in the very moment in which we see and touch them.  And\nthe radical flaw in the current mode of thinking would lie herein:\nthat, reflecting this false or uncorrected sensation, it attributes to\nthe phenomena of experience a durability which does not really belong\nto them. Imaging forth from those fluid impressions a world of firmly\nout-lined objects, it leads one to regard as a thing stark and dead\nwhat is in reality full of animation, of vigour, of the fire of\nlife--that eternal process of nature, of which at a later time Goethe\nspoke as the \"Living Garment,\" whereby God is seen of us, ever in\nweaving at the \"Loom of Time.\"\n\nAnd the appeal which the old Greek thinker made was, in the first\ninstance, from confused to unconfused sensation; with a sort of\nprophetic seriousness, a great claim and assumption, such as we may\nunderstand, if we anticipate in this preliminary scepticism the\nulterior scope of his speculation, according to which the universal\nmovement of all natural things is but one particular stage, or measure,\nof that ceaseless activity wherein the divine reason consists.  The one\ntrue being--that constant subject of all early thought--it was his\nmerit to have conceived, not as sterile and stagnant inaction, but as a\nperpetual energy, from the restless stream of which, [130] at certain\npoints, some elements detach themselves, and harden into non-entity and\ndeath, corresponding, as outward objects, to man's inward condition of\nignorance: that is, to the slowness of his faculties.  It is with this\nparadox of a subtle, perpetual change in all visible things, that the\nhigh speculation of Heraclitus begins.  Hence the scorn he expresses\nfor anything like a careless, half-conscious, \"use-and-wont\" reception\nof our experience, which took so strong a hold on men's memories! Hence\nthose many precepts towards a strenuous self-consciousness in all we\nthink and do, that loyalty to cool and candid reason, which makes\nstrict attentiveness of mind a kind of religious duty and service.\n\nThe negative doctrine, then, that the objects of our ordinary\nexperience, fixed as they seem, are really in perpetual change, had\nbeen, as originally conceived, but the preliminary step towards a large\npositive system of almost religious philosophy.  Then as now, the\nilluminated philosophic mind might apprehend, in what seemed a mass of\nlifeless matter, the movement of that universal life, in which things,\nand men's impressions of them, were ever \"coming to be,\" alternately\nconsumed and renewed.  That continual change, to be discovered by the\nattentive understanding where common opinion found fixed objects, was\nbut the indicator of a subtler but all-pervading motion--the sleepless,\never-sustained, inexhaustible energy of the divine [131] reason itself,\nproceeding always by its own rhythmical logic, and lending to all mind\nand matter, in turn, what life they had.  In this \"perpetual flux\" of\nthings and of souls, there was, as Heraclitus conceived, a continuance,\nif not of their material or spiritual elements, yet of orderly\nintelligible relationships, like the harmony of musical notes, wrought\nout in and through the series of their mutations--ordinances of the\ndivine reason, maintained throughout the changes of the phenomenal\nworld; and this harmony in their mutation and opposition, was, after\nall, a principle of sanity, of reality, there.  But it happened, that,\nof all this, the first, merely sceptical or negative step, that easiest\nstep on the threshold, had alone remained in general memory; and the\n\"doctrine of motion\" seemed to those who had felt its seduction to make\nall fixed knowledge impossible.  The swift passage of things, the still\nswifter passage of those modes of our conscious being which seemed to\nreflect them, might indeed be the burning of the divine fire: but what\nwas ascertained was that they did pass away like a devouring flame, or\nlike the race of water in the mid-stream--too swiftly for any real\nknowledge of them to be attainable.  Heracliteanism had grown to be\nalmost identical with the famous doctrine of the sophist Protagoras,\nthat the momentary, sensible apprehension of the individual was the\nonly standard of what is or is [132] not, and each one the measure of\nall things to himself.  The impressive name of Heraclitus had become\nbut an authority for a philosophy of the despair of knowledge.\n\nAnd as it had been with his original followers in Greece, so it\nhappened now with the later Roman disciple.  He, too, paused at the\napprehension of that constant motion of things--the drift of flowers,\nof little or great souls, of ambitious systems, in the stream around\nhim, the first source, the ultimate issue, of which, in regions out of\nsight, must count with him as but a dim problem.  The bold mental\nflight of the old Greek master from the fleeting, competing objects of\nexperience to that one universal life, in which the whole sphere of\nphysical change might be reckoned as but a single pulsation, remained\nby him as hypothesis only--the hypothesis he actually preferred, as in\nitself most credible, however scantily realisable even by the\nimagination--yet still as but one unverified hypothesis, among many\nothers, concerning the first principle of things.  He might reserve it\nas a fine, high, visionary consideration, very remote upon the\nintellectual ladder, just at the point, indeed, where that ladder\nseemed to pass into the clouds, but for which there was certainly no\ntime left just now by his eager interest in the real objects so close\nto him, on the lowlier earthy steps nearest the ground.  And those\nchildish days of reverie, [133] when he played at priests, played in\nmany another day-dream, working his way from the actual present, as far\nas he might, with a delightful sense of escape in replacing the outer\nworld of other people by an inward world as himself really cared to\nhave it, had made him a kind of \"idealist.\" He was become aware of the\npossibility of a large dissidence between an inward and somewhat\nexclusive world of vivid personal apprehension, and the unimproved,\nunheightened reality of the life of those about him.  As a consequence,\nhe was ready now to concede, somewhat more easily than others, the\nfirst point of his new lesson, that the individual is to himself the\nmeasure of all things, and to rely on the exclusive certainty to\nhimself of his own impressions. To move afterwards in that outer world\nof other people, as though taking it at their estimate, would be\npossible henceforth only as a kind of irony.  And as with the Vicaire\nSavoyard, after reflecting on the variations of philosophy, \"the first\nfruit he drew from that reflection was the lesson of a limitation of\nhis researches to what immediately interested him; to rest peacefully\nin a profound ignorance as to all beside; to disquiet himself only\nconcerning those things which it was of import for him to know.\"  At\nleast he would entertain no theory of conduct which did not allow its\ndue weight to this primary element of incertitude or negation, in the\nconditions of man's life. [134] Just here he joined company, retracing\nin his individual mental pilgrimage the historic order of human\nthought, with another wayfarer on the journey, another ancient Greek\nmaster, the founder of the Cyrenaic philosophy, whose weighty\ntraditional utterances (for he had left no writing) served in turn to\ngive effective outline to the contemplations of Marius.  There was\nsomething in the doctrine itself congruous with the place wherein it\nhad its birth; and for a time Marius lived much, mentally, in the\nbrilliant Greek colony which had given a dubious name to the philosophy\nof pleasure.  It hung, for his fancy, between the mountains and the\nsea, among richer than Italian gardens, on a certain breezy table-land\nprojecting from the African coast, some hundreds of miles southward\nfrom Greece.  There, in a delightful climate, with something of\ntransalpine temperance amid its luxury, and withal in an inward\natmosphere of temperance which did but further enhance the brilliancy\nof human life, the school of Cyrene had maintained itself as almost one\nwith the family of its founder; certainly as nothing coarse or unclean,\nand under the influence of accomplished women.\n\nAristippus of Cyrene too had left off in suspense of judgment as to\nwhat might really lie behind--flammantia moenia mundi: the flaming\nramparts of the world.  Those strange, bold, sceptical surmises, which\nhad haunted the minds [135] of the first Greek enquirers as merely\nabstract doubt, which had been present to the mind of Heraclitus as one\nelement only in a system of abstract philosophy, became with Aristippus\na very subtly practical worldly-wisdom.  The difference between him and\nthose obscure earlier thinkers is almost like that between an ancient\nthinker generally, and a modern man of the world: it was the difference\nbetween the mystic in his cell, or the prophet in the desert, and the\nexpert, cosmopolitan, administrator of his dark sayings, translating\nthe abstract thoughts of the master into terms, first of all, of\nsentiment.  It has been sometimes seen, in the history of the human\nmind, that when thus translated into terms of sentiment--of sentiment,\nas lying already half-way towards practice--the abstract ideas of\nmetaphysics for the first time reveal their true significance.  The\nmetaphysical principle, in itself, as it were, without hands or feet,\nbecomes impressive, fascinating, of effect, when translated into a\nprecept as to how it were best to feel and act; in other words, under\nits sentimental or ethical equivalent.  The leading idea of the great\nmaster of Cyrene, his theory that things are but shadows, and that we,\neven as they, never continue in one stay, might indeed have taken\neffect as a languid, enervating, consumptive nihilism, as a precept of\n\"renunciation,\" which would touch and handle and busy itself with\nnothing.  But in the reception of [136] metaphysical formulae, all\ndepends, as regards their actual and ulterior result, on the\npre-existent qualities of that soil of human nature into which they\nfall--the company they find already present there, on their admission\ninto the house of thought; there being at least so much truth as this\ninvolves in the theological maxim, that the reception of this or that\nspeculative conclusion is really a matter of will.  The persuasion that\nall is vanity, with this happily constituted Greek, who had been a\ngenuine disciple of Socrates and reflected, presumably, something of\nhis blitheness in the face of the world, his happy way of taking all\nchances, generated neither frivolity nor sourness, but induced, rather,\nan impression, just serious enough, of the call upon men's attention of\nthe crisis in which they find themselves.  It became the stimulus\ntowards every kind of activity, and prompted a perpetual,\ninextinguishable thirst after experience.\n\nWith Marius, then, the influence of the philosopher of pleasure\ndepended on this, that in him an abstract doctrine, originally somewhat\nacrid, had fallen upon a rich and genial nature, well fitted to\ntransform it into a theory of practice, of considerable stimulative\npower towards a fair life.  What Marius saw in him was the spectacle of\none of the happiest temperaments coming, so to speak, to an\nunderstanding with the most depressing of theories; accepting the [137]\nresults of a metaphysical system which seemed to concentrate into\nitself all the weakening trains of thought in earlier Greek\nspeculation, and making the best of it; turning its hard, bare truths,\nwith wonderful tact, into precepts of grace, and delicate wisdom, and a\ndelicate sense of honour.  Given the hardest terms, supposing our days\nare indeed but a shadow, even so, we may well adorn and beautify, in\nscrupulous self-respect, our souls, and whatever our souls touch\nupon--these wonderful bodies, these material dwelling-places through\nwhich the shadows pass together for a while, the very raiment we wear,\nour very pastimes and the intercourse of society.  The most discerning\njudges saw in him something like the graceful \"humanities\" of the later\nRoman, and our modern \"culture,\" as it is termed; while Horace recalled\nhis sayings as expressing best his own consummate amenity in the\nreception of life.\n\nIn this way, for Marius, under the guidance of that old master of\ndecorous living, those eternal doubts as to the criteria of truth\nreduced themselves to a scepticism almost drily practical, a scepticism\nwhich developed the opposition between things as they are and our\nimpressions and thoughts concerning them--the possibility, if an\noutward world does really exist, of some faultiness in our apprehension\nof it--the doctrine, in short, of what is termed \"the subjectivity of\nknowledge.\"  That is a consideration, indeed, [138] which lies as an\nelement of weakness, like some admitted fault or flaw, at the very\nfoundation of every philosophical account of the universe; which\nconfronts all philosophies at their starting, but with which none have\nreally dealt conclusively, some perhaps not quite sincerely; which\nthose who are not philosophers dissipate by \"common,\" but\nunphilosophical, sense, or by religious faith.  The peculiar strength\nof Marius was, to have apprehended this weakness on the threshold of\nhuman knowledge, in the whole range of its consequences.  Our knowledge\nis limited to what we feel, he reflected: we need no proof that we\nfeel.  But can we be sure that things are at all like our feelings?\nMere peculiarities in the instruments of our cognition, like the little\nknots and waves on the surface of a mirror, may distort the matter they\nseem but to represent.  Of other people we cannot truly know even the\nfeelings, nor how far they would indicate the same modifications, each\none of a personality really unique, in using the same terms as\nourselves; that \"common experience,\" which is sometimes proposed as a\nsatisfactory basis of certainty, being after all only a fixity of\nlanguage.  But our own impressions!--The light and heat of that blue\nveil over our heads, the heavens spread out, perhaps not like a curtain\nover anything!--How reassuring, after so long a debate about the rival\ncriteria of truth, to fall back upon direct sensation, to limit one's\n[139] aspirations after knowledge to that!  In an age still materially\nso brilliant, so expert in the artistic handling of material things,\nwith sensible capacities still in undiminished vigour, with the whole\nworld of classic art and poetry outspread before it, and where there\nwas more than eye or ear could well take in--how natural the\ndetermination to rely exclusively upon the phenomena of the senses,\nwhich certainly never deceive us about themselves, about which alone we\ncan never deceive ourselves!\n\nAnd so the abstract apprehension that the little point of this present\nmoment alone really is, between a past which has just ceased to be and\na future which may never come, became practical with Marius, under the\nform of a resolve, as far as possible, to exclude regret and desire,\nand yield himself to the improvement of the present with an absolutely\ndisengaged mind.  America is here and now--here, or nowhere: as Wilhelm\nMeister finds out one day, just not too late, after so long looking\nvaguely across the ocean for the opportunity of the development of his\ncapacities.  It was as if, recognising in perpetual motion the law of\nnature, Marius identified his own way of life cordially with it,\n\"throwing himself into the stream,\" so to speak.  He too must maintain\na harmony with that soul of motion in things, by constantly renewed\nmobility of character.\n\nOmnis Aristippum decuit color et status et res.--\n\n[140] Thus Horace had summed up that perfect manner in the reception of\nlife attained by his old Cyrenaic master; and the first practical\nconsequence of the metaphysic which lay behind that perfect manner, had\nbeen a strict limitation, almost the renunciation, of metaphysical\nenquiry itself.  Metaphysic--that art, as it has so often proved, in\nthe words of Michelet, de s'\u00c3\u00a9garer avec m\u00c3\u00a9thode, of bewildering oneself\nmethodically:--one must spend little time upon that!  In the school of\nCyrene, great as was its mental incisiveness, logical and physical\nspeculation, theoretic interests generally, had been valued only so far\nas they served to give a groundwork, an intellectual justification, to\nthat exclusive concern with practical ethics which was a note of the\nCyrenaic philosophy.  How earnest and enthusiastic, how true to itself,\nunder how many varieties of character, had been the effort of the\nGreeks after Theory--The\u00c3\u00b4ria--that vision of a wholly reasonable world,\nwhich, according to the greatest of them, literally makes man like God:\nhow loyally they had still persisted in the quest after that, in spite\nof how many disappointments!  In the Gospel of Saint John, perhaps,\nsome of them might have found the kind of vision they were seeking for;\nbut not in \"doubtful disputations\" concerning \"being\" and \"not being,\"\nknowledge and appearance.  Men's minds, even young men's minds, at that\nlate day, might well seem oppressed by the weariness of systems which\n[141] had so far outrun positive knowledge; and in the mind of Marius,\nas in that old school of Cyrene, this sense of ennui, combined with\nappetites so youthfully vigorous, brought about reaction, a sort of\nsuicide (instances of the like have been seen since) by which a great\nmetaphysical acumen was devoted to the function of proving metaphysical\nspeculation impossible, or useless. Abstract theory was to be valued\nonly just so far as it might serve to clear the tablet of the mind from\nsuppositions no more than half realisable, or wholly visionary, leaving\nit in flawless evenness of surface to the impressions of an experience,\nconcrete and direct.\n\nTo be absolutely virgin towards such experience, by ridding ourselves\nof such abstractions as are but the ghosts of bygone impressions--to be\nrid of the notions we have made for ourselves, and that so often only\nmisrepresent the experience of which they profess to be the\nrepresentation--idola, idols, false appearances, as Bacon calls them\nlater--to neutralise the distorting influence of metaphysical system by\nan all-accomplished metaphysic skill: it is this bold, hard, sober\nrecognition, under a very \"dry light,\" of its own proper aim, in union\nwith a habit of feeling which on the practical side may perhaps open a\nwide doorway to human weakness, that gives to the Cyrenaic doctrine, to\nreproductions of this doctrine in the time of Marius or in our own,\ntheir gravity and importance.  It was a [142] school to which the young\nman might come, eager for truth, expecting much from philosophy, in no\nignoble curiosity, aspiring after nothing less than an \"initiation.\" He\nwould be sent back, sooner or later, to experience, to the world of\nconcrete impressions, to things as they may be seen, heard, felt by\nhim; but with a wonderful machinery of observation, and free from the\ntyranny of mere theories.\n\nSo, in intervals of repose, after the agitation which followed the\ndeath of Flavian, the thoughts of Marius ran, while he felt himself as\nif returned to the fine, clear, peaceful light of that pleasant school\nof healthfully sensuous wisdom, in the brilliant old Greek colony, on\nits fresh upland by the sea.  Not pleasure, but a general completeness\nof life, was the practical ideal to which this anti-metaphysical\nmetaphysic really pointed.  And towards such a full or complete life, a\nlife of various yet select sensation, the most direct and effective\nauxiliary must be, in a word, Insight.  Liberty of soul, freedom from\nall partial and misrepresentative doctrine which does but relieve one\nelement in our experience at the cost of another, freedom from all\nembarrassment alike of regret for the past and of calculation on the\nfuture: this would be but preliminary to the real business of\neducation--insight, insight through culture, into all that the present\nmoment holds in trust for us, as we stand so briefly in its presence.\nFrom that maxim of [143] Life as the end of life, followed, as a\npractical consequence, the desirableness of refining all the\ninstruments of inward and outward intuition, of developing all their\ncapacities, of testing and exercising one's self in them, till one's\nwhole nature became one complex medium of reception, towards the\nvision--the \"beatific vision,\" if we really cared to make it such--of\nour actual experience in the world.  Not the conveyance of an abstract\nbody of truths or principles, would be the aim of the right education\nof one's self, or of another, but the conveyance of an art--an art in\nsome degree peculiar to each individual character; with the\nmodifications, that is, due to its special constitution, and the\npeculiar circumstances of its growth, inasmuch as no one of us is \"like\nanother, all in all.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX: NEW CYRENAICISM\n\n[144] SUCH were the practical conclusions drawn for himself by Marius,\nwhen somewhat later he had outgrown the mastery of others, from the\nprinciple that \"all is vanity.\"  If he could but count upon the\npresent, if a life brief at best could not certainly be shown to\nconduct one anywhere beyond itself, if men's highest curiosity was\nindeed so persistently baffled--then, with the Cyrenaics of all ages,\nhe would at least fill up the measure of that present with vivid\nsensations, and such intellectual apprehensions, as, in strength and\ndirectness and their immediately realised values at the bar of an\nactual experience, are most like sensations.  So some have spoken in\nevery age; for, like all theories which really express a strong natural\ntendency of the human mind or even one of its characteristic modes of\nweakness, this vein of reflection is a constant tradition in\nphilosophy.  Every age of European thought has had its Cyrenaics or\nEpicureans, under many disguises: even under the hood of the monk.\n\n[145] But--Let us eat and drink, for to-morrow we die!--is a proposal,\nthe real import of which differs immensely, according to the natural\ntaste, and the acquired judgment, of the guests who sit at the table.\nIt may express nothing better than the instinct of Dante's Ciacco, the\naccomplished glutton, in the mud of the Inferno;+ or, since on no\nhypothesis does man \"live by bread alone,\" may come to be identical\nwith--\"My meat is to do what is just and kind;\" while the soul, which\ncan make no sincere claim to have apprehended anything beyond the veil\nof immediate experience, yet never loses a sense of happiness in\nconforming to the highest moral ideal it can clearly define for itself;\nand actually, though but with so faint hope, does the \"Father's\nbusiness.\"\n\nIn that age of Marcus Aurelius, so completely disabused of the\nmetaphysical ambition to pass beyond \"the flaming ramparts of the\nworld,\" but, on the other hand, possessed of so vast an accumulation of\nintellectual treasure, with so wide a view before it over all varieties\nof what is powerful or attractive in man and his works, the thoughts of\nMarius did but follow the line taken by the majority of educated\npersons, though to a different issue.  Pitched to a really high and\nserious key, the precept--Be perfect in regard to what is here and now:\nthe precept of \"culture,\" as it is called, or of a complete\neducation--might at least save him from the vulgarity and heaviness\n[146] of a generation, certainly of no general fineness of temper,\nthough with a material well-being abundant enough.  Conceded that what\nis secure in our existence is but the sharp apex of the present moment\nbetween two hypothetical eternities, and all that is real in our\nexperience but a series of fleeting impressions:--so Marius continued\nthe sceptical argument he had condensed, as the matter to hold by, from\nhis various philosophical reading:--given, that we are never to get\nbeyond the walls of the closely shut cell of one's own personality;\nthat the ideas we are somehow impelled to form of an outer world, and\nof other minds akin to our own, are, it may be, but a day-dream, and\nthe thought of any world beyond, a day-dream perhaps idler still: then,\nhe, at least, in whom those fleeting impressions--faces, voices,\nmaterial sunshine--were very real and imperious, might well set himself\nto the consideration, how such actual moments as they passed might be\nmade to yield their utmost, by the most dexterous training of capacity.\nAmid abstract metaphysical doubts, as to what might lie one step only\nbeyond that experience, reinforcing the deep original materialism or\nearthliness of human nature itself, bound so intimately to the sensuous\nworld, let him at least make the most of what was \"here and now.\"  In\nthe actual dimness of ways from means to ends--ends in themselves\ndesirable, yet for the most part distant and for him, certainly, below\nthe [147] visible horizon--he would at all events be sure that the\nmeans, to use the well-worn terminology, should have something of\nfinality or perfection about them, and themselves partake, in a\nmeasure, of the more excellent nature of ends--that the means should\njustify the end.\n\nWith this view he would demand culture, paideia,+ as the Cyrenaics\nsaid, or, in other words, a wide, a complete, education--an education\npartly negative, as ascertaining the true limits of man's capacities,\nbut for the most part positive, and directed especially to the\nexpansion and refinement of the power of reception; of those powers,\nabove all, which are immediately relative to fleeting phenomena, the\npowers of emotion and sense.  In such an education, an \"aesthetic\"\neducation, as it might now be termed, and certainly occupied very\nlargely with those aspects of things which affect us pleasurably\nthrough sensation, art, of course, including all the finer sorts of\nliterature, would have a great part to play.  The study of music, in\nthat wider Platonic sense, according to which, music comprehends all\nthose matters over which the Muses of Greek mythology preside, would\nconduct one to an exquisite appreciation of all the finer traits of\nnature and of man.  Nay! the products of the imagination must\nthemselves be held to present the most perfect forms of life--spirit\nand matter alike under their purest and most perfect conditions--the\nmost strictly appropriate [148] objects of that impassioned\ncontemplation, which, in the world of intellectual discipline, as in\nthe highest forms of morality and religion, must be held to be the\nessential function of the \"perfect.\"  Such manner of life might come\neven to seem a kind of religion--an inward, visionary, mystic piety, or\nreligion, by virtue of its effort to live days \"lovely and pleasant\" in\nthemselves, here and now, and with an all-sufficiency of well-being in\nthe immediate sense of the object contemplated, independently of any\nfaith, or hope that might be entertained as to their ulterior tendency.\nIn this way, the true aesthetic culture would be realisable as a new\nform of the contemplative life, founding its claim on the intrinsic\n\"blessedness\" of \"vision\"--the vision of perfect men and things.  One's\nhuman nature, indeed, would fain reckon on an assured and endless\nfuture, pleasing itself with the dream of a final home, to be attained\nat some still remote date, yet with a conscious, delightful home-coming\nat last, as depicted in many an old poetic Elysium.  On the other hand,\nthe world of perfected sensation, intelligence, emotion, is so close to\nus, and so attractive, that the most visionary of spirits must needs\nrepresent the world unseen in colours, and under a form really borrowed\nfrom it.  Let me be sure then--might he not plausibly say?--that I miss\nno detail of this life of realised consciousness in the present!  Here\nat least is a vision, a theory, [149] the\u00c3\u00b4ria,+ which reposes on no\nbasis of unverified hypothesis, which makes no call upon a future after\nall somewhat problematic; as it would be unaffected by any discovery of\nan Empedocles (improving on the old story of Prometheus) as to what had\nreally been the origin, and course of development, of man's actually\nattained faculties and that seemingly divine particle of reason or\nspirit in him.  Such a doctrine, at more leisurable moments, would of\ncourse have its precepts to deliver on the embellishment, generally, of\nwhat is near at hand, on the adornment of life, till, in a not\nimpracticable rule of conduct, one's existence, from day to day, came\nto be like a well-executed piece of music; that \"perpetual motion\" in\nthings (so Marius figured the matter to himself, under the old Greek\nimageries) according itself to a kind of cadence or harmony.\n\nIt was intelligible that this \"aesthetic\" philosophy might find itself\n(theoretically, at least, and by way of a curious question in\ncasuistry, legitimate from its own point of view) weighing the claims\nof that eager, concentrated, impassioned realisation of experience,\nagainst those of the received morality.  Conceiving its own function in\na somewhat desperate temper, and becoming, as every high-strung form of\nsentiment, as the religious sentiment itself, may become, somewhat\nantinomian, when, in its effort towards the order of experiences it\nprefers, it is confronted with the traditional and popular [150]\nmorality, at points where that morality may look very like a\nconvention, or a mere stage-property of the world, it would be found,\nfrom time to time, breaking beyond the limits of the actual moral\norder; perhaps not without some pleasurable excitement in so bold a\nventure.\n\nWith the possibility of some such hazard as this, in thought or even in\npractice--that it might be, though refining, or tonic even, in the case\nof those strong and in health, yet, as Pascal says of the kindly and\ntemperate wisdom of Montaigne, \"pernicious for those who have any\nnatural tendency to impiety or vice,\" the line of reflection traced out\nabove, was fairly chargeable.--Not, however, with \"hedonism\" and its\nsupposed consequences.  The blood, the heart, of Marius were still\npure.  He knew that his carefully considered theory of practice braced\nhim, with the effect of a moral principle duly recurring to mind every\nmorning, towards the work of a student, for which he might seem\nintended.  Yet there were some among his acquaintance who jumped to the\nconclusion that, with the \"Epicurean stye,\" he was making\npleasure--pleasure, as they so poorly conceived it--the sole motive of\nlife; and they precluded any exacter estimate of the situation by\ncovering it with a high-sounding general term, through the vagueness of\nwhich they were enabled to see the severe and laborious youth in the\nvulgar company of Lais.  Words like \"hedonism\"-- [151] terms of large\nand vague comprehension--above all when used for a purpose avowedly\ncontroversial, have ever been the worst examples of what are called\n\"question-begging terms;\" and in that late age in which Marius lived,\namid the dust of so many centuries of philosophical debate, the air was\nfull of them.  Yet those who used that reproachful Greek term for the\nphilosophy of pleasure, were hardly more likely than the old Greeks\nthemselves (on whom regarding this very subject of the theory of\npleasure, their masters in the art of thinking had so emphatically to\nimpress the necessity of \"making distinctions\") to come to any very\ndelicately correct ethical conclusions by a reasoning, which began with\na general term, comprehensive enough to cover pleasures so different in\nquality, in their causes and effects, as the pleasures of wine and\nlove, of art and science, of religious enthusiasm and political\nenterprise, and of that taste or curiosity which satisfied itself with\nlong days of serious study.  Yet, in truth, each of those pleasurable\nmodes of activity, may, in its turn, fairly become the ideal of the\n\"hedonistic\" doctrine.  Really, to the phase of reflection through\nwhich Marius was then passing, the charge of \"hedonism,\" whatever its\ntrue weight might be, was not properly applicable at all.  Not\npleasure, but fulness of life, and \"insight\" as conducting to that\nfulness--energy, variety, and choice of experience, including [152]\nnoble pain and sorrow even, loves such as those in the exquisite old\nstory of Apuleius, sincere and strenuous forms of the moral life, such\nas Seneca and Epictetus--whatever form of human life, in short, might\nbe heroic, impassioned, ideal: from these the \"new Cyrenaicism\" of\nMarius took its criterion of values.  It was a theory, indeed, which\nmight properly be regarded as in great degree coincident with the main\nprinciple of the Stoics themselves, and an older version of the precept\n\"Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy might\"--a doctrine\nso widely acceptable among the nobler spirits of that time.  And, as\nwith that, its mistaken tendency would lie in the direction of a kind\nof idolatry of mere life, or natural gift, or strength--l'id\u00c3\u00b4latrie des\ntalents.\n\nTo understand the various forms of ancient art and thought, the various\nforms of actual human feeling (the only new thing, in a world almost\ntoo opulent in what was old) to satisfy, with a kind of scrupulous\nequity, the claims of these concrete and actual objects on his\nsympathy, his intelligence, his senses--to \"pluck out the heart of\ntheir mystery,\" and in turn become the interpreter of them to others:\nthis had now defined itself for Marius as a very narrowly practical\ndesign: it determined his choice of a vocation to live by. It was the\nera of the rhetoricians, or sophists, as they were sometimes called; of\nmen who came in some instances to [153] great fame and fortune, by way\nof a literary cultivation of \"science.\" That science, it has been often\nsaid, must have been wholly an affair of words.  But in a world,\nconfessedly so opulent in what was old, the work, even of genius, must\nnecessarily consist very much in criticism; and, in the case of the\nmore excellent specimens of his class, the rhetorician was, after all,\nthe eloquent and effective interpreter, for the delighted ears of\nothers, of what understanding himself had come by, in years of travel\nand study, of the beautiful house of art and thought which was the\ninheritance of the age.  The emperor Marcus Aurelius, to whose service\nMarius had now been called, was himself, more or less openly, a\n\"lecturer.\"  That late world, amid many curiously vivid modern traits,\nhad this spectacle, so familiar to ourselves, of the public lecturer or\nessayist; in some cases adding to his other gifts that of the Christian\npreacher, who knows how to touch people's sensibilities on behalf of\nthe suffering. To follow in the way of these successes, was the natural\ninstinct of youthful ambition; and it was with no vulgar egotism that\nMarius, at the age of nineteen, determined, like many another young man\nof parts, to enter as a student of rhetoric at Rome.\n\nThough the manner of his work was changed formally from poetry to\nprose, he remained, and must always be, of the poetic temper: by which,\nI mean, among other things, that quite [154] independently of the\ngeneral habit of that pensive age he lived much, and as it were by\nsystem, in reminiscence.  Amid his eager grasping at the sensation, the\nconsciousness, of the present, he had come to see that, after all, the\nmain point of economy in the conduct of the present, was the\nquestion:--How will it look to me, at what shall I value it, this day\nnext year?--that in any given day or month one's main concern was its\nimpression for the memory.  A strange trick memory sometimes played\nhim; for, with no natural gradation, what was of last month, or of\nyesterday, of to-day even, would seem as far off, as entirely detached\nfrom him, as things of ten years ago. Detached from him, yet very real,\nthere lay certain spaces of his life, in delicate perspective, under a\nfavourable light; and, somehow, all the less fortunate detail and\ncircumstance had parted from them.  Such hours were oftenest those in\nwhich he had been helped by work of others to the pleasurable\napprehension of art, of nature, or of life.  \"Not what I do, but what I\nam, under the power of this vision\"--he would say to himself--\"is what\nwere indeed pleasing to the gods!\"\n\nAnd yet, with a kind of inconsistency in one who had taken for his\nphilosophic ideal the monochronos h\u00c3\u00aadon\u00c3\u00aa+ of Aristippus--the pleasure\nof the ideal present, of the mystic now--there would come, together\nwith that precipitate sinking of things into the past, a desire, after\nall, [155] to retain \"what was so transitive.\"  Could he but arrest,\nfor others also, certain clauses of experience, as the imaginative\nmemory presented them to himself!  In those grand, hot summers, he\nwould have imprisoned the very perfume of the flowers.  To create, to\nlive, perhaps, a little while beyond the allotted hours, if it were but\nin a fragment of perfect expression:--it was thus his longing defined\nitself for something to hold by amid the \"perpetual flux.\" With men of\nhis vocation, people were apt to say, words were things. Well! with\nhim, words should be indeed things,--the word, the phrase, valuable in\nexact proportion to the transparency with which it conveyed to others\nthe apprehension, the emotion, the mood, so vividly real within\nhimself.  Verbaque provisam rem non invita sequentur:+ Virile\napprehension of the true nature of things, of the true nature of one's\nown impression, first of all!--words would follow that naturally, a\ntrue understanding of one's self being ever the first condition of\ngenuine style.  Language delicate and measured, the delicate Attic\nphrase, for instance, in which the eminent Aristeides could speak, was\nthen a power to which people's hearts, and sometimes even their purses,\nreadily responded.  And there were many points, as Marius thought, on\nwhich the heart of that age greatly needed to be touched.  He hardly\nknew how strong that old religious sense of responsibility, the\nconscience, as we call it, [156] still was within him--a body of inward\nimpressions, as real as those so highly valued outward ones--to offend\nagainst which, brought with it a strange feeling of disloyalty, as to a\nperson.  And the determination, adhered to with no misgiving, to add\nnothing, not so much as a transient sigh, to the great total of men's\nunhappiness, in his way through the world:--that too was something to\nrest on, in the drift of mere \"appearances.\"\n\nAll this would involve a life of industry, of industrious study, only\npossible through healthy rule, keeping clear the eye alike of body and\nsoul.  For the male element, the logical conscience asserted itself\nnow, with opening manhood--asserted itself, even in his literary style,\nby a certain firmness of outline, that touch of the worker in metal,\namid its richness.  Already he blamed instinctively alike in his work\nand in himself, as youth so seldom does, all that had not passed a long\nand liberal process of erasure.  The happy phrase or sentence was\nreally modelled upon a cleanly finished structure of scrupulous\nthought.  The suggestive force of the one master of his development,\nwho had battled so hard with imaginative prose; the utterance, the\ngolden utterance, of the other, so content with its living power of\npersuasion that he had never written at all,--in the commixture of\nthese two qualities he set up his literary ideal, and this rare\nblending of grace with an intellectual [157] rigour or astringency, was\nthe secret of a singular expressiveness in it.\n\nHe acquired at this time a certain bookish air, the somewhat sombre\nhabitude of the avowed scholar, which though it never interfered with\nthe perfect tone, \"fresh and serenely disposed,\" of the Roman\ngentleman, yet qualified it as by an interesting oblique trait, and\nfrightened away some of his equals in age and rank.  The sober\ndiscretion of his thoughts, his sustained habit of meditation, the\nsense of those negative conclusions enabling him to concentrate\nhimself, with an absorption so entire, upon what is immediately here\nand now, gave him a peculiar manner of intellectual confidence, as of\none who had indeed been initiated into a great secret.--Though with an\nair so disengaged, he seemed to be living so intently in the visible\nworld!  And now, in revolt against that pre-occupation with other\npersons, which had so often perturbed his spirit, his wistful\nspeculations as to what the real, the greater, experience might be,\ndetermined in him, not as the longing for love--to be with Cynthia, or\nAspasia--but as a thirst for existence in exquisite places.  The veil\nthat was to be lifted for him lay over the works of the old masters of\nart, in places where nature also had used her mastery. And it was just\nat this moment that a summons to Rome reached him.\n\nNOTES\n\n145. +Canto VI.\n\n147. +Transliteration: paideia.

That summons had come from one\nof the former friends of his father in the capital, who had kept\nhimself acquainted with the lad's progress, and, assured of his parts,\nhis courtly ways, above all of his beautiful penmanship, now offered\nhim a place, virtually that of an amanuensis, near the person of the\nphilosophic emperor.  The old town-house of his family on the Caelian\nhill, so long neglected, might well require his personal care; and\nMarius, relieved a little by his preparations for travelling from a\ncertain over-tension [159] of spirit in which he had lived of late, was\npresently on his way, to await introduction to Aurelius, on his\nexpected return home, after a first success, illusive enough as it was\nsoon to appear, against the invaders from beyond the Danube.\n\nThe opening stage of his journey, through the firm, golden weather, for\nwhich he had lingered three days beyond the appointed time of\nstarting--days brown with the first rains of autumn--brought him, by\nthe byways among the lower slopes of the Apennines of Luna, to the town\nof Luca, a station on the Cassian Way; travelling so far mainly on\nfoot, while the baggage followed under the care of his attendants. He\nwore a broad felt hat, in fashion not unlike a more modern pilgrim's,\nthe neat head projecting from the collar of his gray paenula, or\ntravelling mantle, sewed closely together over the breast, but with its\ntwo sides folded up upon the shoulders, to leave the arms free in\nwalking, and was altogether so trim and fresh, that, as he climbed the\nhill from Pisa, by the long steep lane through the olive-yards, and\nturned to gaze where he could just discern the cypresses of the old\nschool garden, like two black lines down the yellow walls, a little\nchild took possession of his hand, and, looking up at him with entire\nconfidence, paced on bravely at his side, for the mere pleasure of his\ncompany, to the spot where the road declined again [160] into the\nvalley beyond.  From this point, leaving the servants behind, he\nsurrendered himself, a willing subject, as he walked, to the\nimpressions of the road, and was almost surprised, both at the\nsuddenness with which evening came on, and the distance from his old\nhome at which it found him.\n\nAnd at the little town of Luca, he felt that indescribable sense of a\nwelcoming in the mere outward appearance of things, which seems to mark\nout certain places for the special purpose of evening rest, and gives\nthem always a peculiar amiability in retrospect.  Under the deepening\ntwilight, the rough-tiled roofs seem to huddle together side by side,\nlike one continuous shelter over the whole township, spread low and\nbroad above the snug sleeping-rooms within; and the place one sees for\nthe first time, and must tarry in but for a night, breathes the very\nspirit of home.  The cottagers lingered at their doors for a few\nminutes as the shadows grew larger, and went to rest early; though\nthere was still a glow along the road through the shorn corn-fields,\nand the birds were still awake about the crumbling gray heights of an\nold temple.  So quiet and air-swept was the place, you could hardly\ntell where the country left off in it, and the field-paths became its\nstreets.  Next morning he must needs change the manner of his journey.\nThe light baggage-wagon returned, and he proceeded now more quickly,\ntravelling [161] a stage or two by post, along the Cassian Way, where\nthe figures and incidents of the great high-road seemed already to tell\nof the capital, the one centre to which all were hastening, or had\nlately bidden adieu.  That Way lay through the heart of the old,\nmysterious and visionary country of Etruria; and what he knew of its\nstrange religion of the dead, reinforced by the actual sight of the\nfuneral houses scattered so plentifully among the dwelling-places of\nthe living, revived in him for a while, in all its strength, his old\ninstinctive yearning towards those inhabitants of the shadowy land he\nhad known in life. It seemed to him that he could half divine how time\npassed in those painted houses on the hillsides, among the gold and\nsilver ornaments, the wrought armour and vestments, the drowsy and dead\nattendants; and the close consciousness of that vast population gave\nhim no fear, but rather a sense of companionship, as he climbed the\nhills on foot behind the horses, through the genial afternoon.\n\nThe road, next day, passed below a town not less primitive, it might\nseem, than its rocky perch--white rocks, that had long been glistening\nbefore him in the distance.  Down the dewy paths the people were\ndescending from it, to keep a holiday, high and low alike in rough,\nwhite-linen smocks.  A homely old play was just begun in an open-air\ntheatre, with seats hollowed out of the turf-grown slope. Marius [162]\ncaught the terrified expression of a child in its mother's arms, as it\nturned from the yawning mouth of a great mask, for refuge in her bosom.\nThe way mounted, and descended again, down the steep street of another\nplace, all resounding with the noise of metal under the hammer; for\nevery house had its brazier's workshop, the bright objects of brass and\ncopper gleaming, like lights in a cave, out of their dark roofs and\ncorners.  Around the anvils the children were watching the work, or ran\nto fetch water to the hissing, red-hot metal; and Marius too watched,\nas he took his hasty mid-day refreshment, a mess of chestnut-meal and\ncheese, while the swelling surface of a great copper water-vessel grew\nflowered all over with tiny petals under the skilful strokes.  Towards\ndusk, a frantic woman at the roadside, stood and cried out the words of\nsome philter, or malison, in verse, with weird motion of her hands, as\nthe travellers passed, like a wild picture drawn from Virgil.\n\nBut all along, accompanying the superficial grace of these incidents of\nthe way, Marius noted, more and more as he drew nearer to Rome, marks\nof the great plague.  Under Hadrian and his successors, there had been\nmany enactments to improve the condition of the slave.  The ergastula+\nwere abolished.  But no system of free labour had as yet succeeded.  A\nwhole mendicant population, artfully exaggerating every symptom and\ncircumstance of misery, still hung [163] around, or sheltered\nthemselves within, the vast walls of their old, half-ruined\ntask-houses.  And for the most part they had been variously stricken by\nthe pestilence.  For once, the heroic level had been reached in rags,\nsquints, scars--every caricature of the human type--ravaged beyond what\ncould have been thought possible if it were to survive at all.\nMeantime, the farms were less carefully tended than of old: here and\nthere they were lapsing into their natural wildness: some villas also\nwere partly fallen into ruin.  The picturesque, romantic Italy of a\nlater time--the Italy of Claude and Salvator Rosa--was already forming,\nfor the delight of the modern romantic traveller.\n\nAnd again Marius was aware of a real change in things, on crossing the\nTiber, as if some magic effect lay in that; though here, in truth, the\nTiber was but a modest enough stream of turbid water. Nature, under the\nricher sky, seemed readier and more affluent, and man fitter to the\nconditions around him: even in people hard at work there appeared to be\na less burdensome sense of the mere business of life.  How dreamily the\nwomen were passing up through the broad light and shadow of the steep\nstreets with the great water-pots resting on their heads, like women of\nCaryae, set free from slavery in old Greek temples.  With what a fresh,\nprimeval poetry was daily existence here impressed--all the details of\nthe threshing-floor and the vineyard; [164] the common farm-life even;\nthe great bakers' fires aglow upon the road in the evening.  In the\npresence of all this Marius felt for a moment like those old, early,\nunconscious poets, who created the famous Greek myths of Dionysus, and\nthe Great Mother, out of the imagery of the wine-press and the\nploughshare.  And still the motion of the journey was bringing his\nthoughts to systematic form.  He seemed to have grown to the fulness of\nintellectual manhood, on his way hither.  The formative and literary\nstimulus, so to call it, of peaceful exercise which he had always\nobserved in himself, doing its utmost now, the form and the matter of\nthought alike detached themselves clearly and with readiness from the\nhealthfully excited brain.--\"It is wonderful,\" says Pliny, \"how the\nmind is stirred to activity by brisk bodily exercise.\"  The presentable\naspects of inmost thought and feeling became evident to him: the\nstructure of all he meant, its order and outline, defined itself: his\ngeneral sense of a fitness and beauty in words became effective in\ndaintily pliant sentences, with all sorts of felicitous linking of\nfigure to abstraction.  It seemed just then as if the desire of the\nartist in him--that old longing to produce--might be satisfied by the\nexact and literal transcript of what was then passing around him, in\nsimple prose, arresting the desirable moment as it passed, and\nprolonging its life a little.--To live in the concrete!  To be sure, at\nleast, of [165] one's hold upon that!--Again, his philosophic scheme\nwas but the reflection of the data of sense, and chiefly of sight, a\nreduction to the abstract, of the brilliant road he travelled on,\nthrough the sunshine.\n\nBut on the seventh evening there came a reaction in the cheerful flow\nof our traveller's thoughts, a reaction with which mere bodily fatigue,\nasserting itself at last over his curiosity, had much to do; and he\nfell into a mood, known to all passably sentimental wayfarers, as night\ndeepens again and again over their path, in which all journeying, from\nthe known to the unknown, comes suddenly to figure as a mere foolish\ntruancy--like a child's running away from home--with the feeling that\none had best return at once, even through the darkness.  He had chosen\nto climb on foot, at his leisure, the long windings by which the road\nascended to the place where that day's stage was to end, and found\nhimself alone in the twilight, far behind the rest of his\ntravelling-companions.  Would the last zigzag, round and round those\ndark masses, half natural rock, half artificial substructure, ever\nbring him within the circuit of the walls above? It was now that a\nstartling incident turned those misgivings almost into actual fear.\nFrom the steep slope a heavy mass of stone was detached, after some\nwhisperings among the trees above his head, and rushing down through\nthe stillness fell to pieces in a [166] cloud of dust across the road\njust behind him, so that he felt the touch upon his heel.  That was\nsufficient, just then, to rouse out of its hiding-place his old vague\nfear of evil--of one's \"enemies\"--a distress, so much a matter of\nconstitution with him, that at times it would seem that the best\npleasures of life could but be snatched, as it were hastily, in one\nmoment's forgetfulness of its dark, besetting influence.  A sudden\nsuspicion of hatred against him, of the nearness of \"enemies,\" seemed\nall at once to alter the visible form of things, as with the child's\nhero, when he found the footprint on the sand of his peaceful, dreamy\nisland.  His elaborate philosophy had not put beneath his feet the\nterror of mere bodily evil; much less of \"inexorable fate, and the\nnoise of greedy Acheron.\"\n\nThe resting-place to which he presently came, in the keen, wholesome\nair of the market-place of the little hill-town, was a pleasant\ncontrast to that last effort of his journey.  The room in which he sat\ndown to supper, unlike the ordinary Roman inns at that day, was trim\nand sweet.  The firelight danced cheerfully upon the polished,\nthree-wicked lucernae burning cleanly with the best oil, upon the\nwhite-washed walls, and the bunches of scarlet carnations set in glass\ngoblets.  The white wine of the place put before him, of the true\ncolour and flavour of the grape, and with a ring of delicate foam as it\nmounted in the cup, had a reviving edge or freshness he had [167] found\nin no other wine.  These things had relieved a little the melancholy of\nthe hour before; and it was just then that he heard the voice of one,\nnewly arrived at the inn, making his way to the upper floor--a youthful\nvoice, with a reassuring clearness of note, which completed his cure.\n\nHe seemed to hear that voice again in dreams, uttering his name: then,\nawake in the full morning light and gazing from the window, saw the\nguest of the night before, a very honourable-looking youth, in the rich\nhabit of a military knight, standing beside his horse, and already\nmaking preparations to depart.  It happened that Marius, too, was to\ntake that day's journey on horseback.  Riding presently from the inn,\nhe overtook Cornelius--of the Twelfth Legion--advancing carefully down\nthe steep street; and before they had issued from the gates of\nUrbs-vetus, the two young men had broken into talk together. They were\npassing along the street of the goldsmiths; and Cornelius must needs\nenter one of the workshops for the repair of some button or link of his\nknightly trappings.  Standing in the doorway, Marius watched the work,\nas he had watched the brazier's business a few days before, wondering\nmost at the simplicity of its processes, a simplicity, however, on\nwhich only genius in that craft could have lighted.--By what\nunguessed-at stroke of hand, for instance, had the grains of precious\nmetal associated themselves [168] with so daintily regular a roughness,\nover the surface of the little casket yonder?  And the conversation\nwhich followed, hence arising, left the two travellers with sufficient\ninterest in each other to insure an easy companionship for the\nremainder of their journey.  In time to come, Marius was to depend very\nmuch on the preferences, the personal judgments, of the comrade who now\nlaid his hand so brotherly on his shoulder, as they left the workshop.\n\nItineris matutini gratiam capimus,+--observes one of our scholarly\ntravellers; and their road that day lay through a country, well-fitted,\nby the peculiarity of its landscape, to ripen a first acquaintance into\nintimacy; its superficial ugliness throwing the wayfarers back upon\neach other's entertainment in a real exchange of ideas, the tension of\nwhich, however, it would relieve, ever and anon, by the unexpected\nassertion of something singularly attractive. The immediate aspect of\nthe land was, indeed, in spite of abundant olive and ilex, unpleasing\nenough.  A river of clay seemed, \"in some old night of time,\" to have\nburst up over valley and hill, and hardened there into fantastic\nshelves and slides and angles of cadaverous rock, up and down among the\ncontorted vegetation; the hoary roots and trunks seeming to confess\nsome weird kinship with them.  But that was long ago; and these pallid\nhillsides needed only the declining sun, touching the rock with purple,\nand throwing deeper shadow into [169] the immemorial foliage, to put on\na peculiar, because a very grave and austere, kind of beauty; while the\ngraceful outlines common to volcanic hills asserted themselves in the\nbroader prospect.  And, for sentimental Marius, all this was\nassociated, by some perhaps fantastic affinity, with a peculiar trait\nof severity, beyond his guesses as to the secret of it, which mingled\nwith the blitheness of his new companion.  Concurring, indeed, with the\ncondition of a Roman soldier, it was certainly something far more than\nthe expression of military hardness, or asc\u00c3\u00aasis; and what was earnest,\nor even austere, in the landscape they had traversed together, seemed\nto have been waiting for the passage of this figure to interpret or\ninform it.  Again, as in his early days with Flavian, a vivid personal\npresence broke through the dreamy idealism, which had almost come to\ndoubt of other men's reality: reassuringly, indeed, yet not without\nsome sense of a constraining tyranny over him from without.\n\nFor Cornelius, returning from the campaign, to take up his quarters on\nthe Palatine, in the imperial guard, seemed to carry about with him, in\nthat privileged world of comely usage to which he belonged, the\natmosphere of some still more jealously exclusive circle.  They halted\non the morrow at noon, not at an inn, but at the house of one of the\nyoung soldier's friends, whom they found absent, indeed, in consequence\nof the [170] plague in those parts, so that after a mid-day rest only,\nthey proceeded again on their journey.  The great room of the villa, to\nwhich they were admitted, had lain long untouched; and the dust rose,\nas they entered, into the slanting bars of sunlight, that fell through\nthe half-closed shutters.  It was here, to while away the time, that\nCornelius bethought himself of displaying to his new friend the various\narticles and ornaments of his knightly array--the breastplate, the\nsandals and cuirass, lacing them on, one by one, with the assistance of\nMarius, and finally the great golden bracelet on the right arm,\nconferred on him by his general for an act of valour.  And as he\ngleamed there, amid that odd interchange of light and shade, with the\nstaff of a silken standard firm in his hand, Marius felt as if he were\nface to face, for the first time, with some new knighthood or chivalry,\njust then coming into the world.\n\nIt was soon after they left this place, journeying now by carriage,\nthat Rome was seen at last, with much excitement on the part of our\ntravellers; Cornelius, and some others of whom the party then\nconsisted, agreeing, chiefly for the sake of Marius, to hasten forward,\nthat it might be reached by daylight, with a cheerful noise of rapid\nwheels as they passed over the flagstones.  But the highest light upon\nthe mausoleum of Hadrian was quite gone out, and it was dark, before\nthey reached the Flaminian Gate.  The [171] abundant sound of water was\nthe one thing that impressed Marius, as they passed down a long street,\nwith many open spaces on either hand: Cornelius to his military\nquarters, and Marius to the old dwelling-place of his fathers.\n\nNOTES\n\n162. +E-text editor's note: ergastula were the Roman agrarian\nequivalent of prison-workhouses.\n\n168. +Apuleius, The Golden Ass, I.17.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI: \"THE MOST RELIGIOUS CITY IN THE WORLD\"\n\n[172] MARIUS awoke early and passed curiously from room to room, noting\nfor more careful inspection by and by the rolls of manuscripts.  Even\ngreater than his curiosity in gazing for the first time on this ancient\npossession, was his eagerness to look out upon Rome itself, as he\npushed back curtain and shutter, and stepped forth in the fresh morning\nupon one of the many balconies, with an oft-repeated dream realised at\nlast.  He was certainly fortunate in the time of his coming to Rome.\nThat old pagan world, of which Rome was the flower, had reached its\nperfection in the things of poetry and art--a perfection which\nindicated only too surely the eve of decline.  As in some vast\nintellectual museum, all its manifold products were intact and in their\nplaces, and with custodians also still extant, duly qualified to\nappreciate and explain them.  And at no period of history had the\nmaterial Rome itself been better worth seeing--lying there not less\nconsummate than that world of [173] pagan intellect which it\nrepresented in every phase of its darkness and light.  The various work\nof many ages fell here harmoniously together, as yet untouched save by\ntime, adding the final grace of a rich softness to its complex\nexpression.  Much which spoke of ages earlier than Nero, the great\nre-builder, lingered on, antique, quaint, immeasurably venerable, like\nthe relics of the medieval city in the Paris of Lewis the Fourteenth:\nthe work of Nero's own time had come to have that sort of old world and\npicturesque interest which the work of Lewis has for ourselves; while\nwithout stretching a parallel too far we might perhaps liken the\narchitectural finesses of the archaic Hadrian to the more excellent\nproducts of our own Gothic revival.  The temple of Antoninus and\nFaustina was still fresh in all the majesty of its closely arrayed\ncolumns of cipollino; but, on the whole, little had been added under\nthe late and present emperors, and during fifty years of public quiet,\na sober brown and gray had grown apace on things.  The gilding on the\nroof of many a temple had lost its garishness: cornice and capital of\npolished marble shone out with all the crisp freshness of real flowers,\namid the already mouldering travertine and brickwork, though the birds\nhad built freely among them.  What Marius then saw was in many\nrespects, after all deduction of difference, more like the modern Rome\nthan the enumeration of particular losses [174]  might lead us to\nsuppose; the Renaissance, in its most ambitious mood and with amplest\nresources, having resumed the ancient classical tradition there, with\nno break or obstruction, as it had happened, in any very considerable\nwork of the middle age. Immediately before him, on the square, steep\nheight, where the earliest little old Rome had huddled itself together,\narose the palace of the Caesars.  Half-veiling the vast substruction of\nrough, brown stone--line upon line of successive ages of builders--the\ntrim, old-fashioned garden walks, under their closely-woven walls of\ndark glossy foliage, test of long and careful cultivation, wound\ngradually, among choice trees, statues and fountains, distinct and\nsparkling in the full morning sunlight, to the richly tinted mass of\npavilions and corridors above, centering in the lofty, white-marble\ndwelling-place of Apollo himself.\n\nHow often had Marius looked forward to that first, free wandering\nthrough Rome, to which he now went forth with a heat in the town\nsunshine (like a mist of fine gold-dust spread through the air) to the\nheight of his desire, making the dun coolness of the narrow streets\nwelcome enough at intervals.  He almost feared, descending the stair\nhastily, lest some unforeseen accident should snatch the little cup of\nenjoyment from him ere he passed the door.  In such morning rambles in\nplaces new to him, [175] life had always seemed to come at its fullest:\nit was then he could feel his youth, that youth the days of which he\nhad already begun to count jealously, in entire possession.  So the\ngrave, pensive figure, a figure, be it said nevertheless, fresher far\nthan often came across it now, moved through the old city towards the\nlodgings of Cornelius, certainly not by the most direct course, however\neager to rejoin the friend of yesterday.\n\nBent as keenly on seeing as if his first day in Rome were to be also\nhis last, the two friends descended along the Vicus Tuscus, with its\nrows of incense-stalls, into the Via Nova, where the fashionable people\nwere busy shopping; and Marius saw with much amusement the frizzled\nheads, then \u00c3\u00a0 la mode.  A glimpse of the Marmorata, the haven at the\nriver-side, where specimens of all the precious marbles of the world\nwere lying amid great white blocks from the quarries of Luna, took his\nthoughts for a moment to his distant home.  They visited the\nflower-market, lingering where the coronarii pressed on them the newest\nspecies, and purchased zinias, now in blossom (like painted flowers,\nthought Marius), to decorate the folds of their togas.  Loitering to\nthe other side of the Forum, past the great Galen's drug-shop, after a\nglance at the announcements of new poems on sale attached to the\ndoorpost of a famous bookseller, they entered the curious [176] library\nof the Temple of Peace, then a favourite resort of literary men, and\nread, fixed there for all to see, the Diurnal or Gazette of the day,\nwhich announced, together with births and deaths, prodigies and\naccidents, and much mere matter of business, the date and manner of the\nphilosophic emperor's joyful return to his people; and, thereafter,\nwith eminent names faintly disguised, what would carry that day's news,\nin many copies, over the provinces--a certain matter concerning the\ngreat lady, known to be dear to him, whom he had left at home.  It was\na story, with the development of which \"society\" had indeed for some\ntime past edified or amused itself, rallying sufficiently from the\npanic of a year ago, not only to welcome back its ruler, but also to\nrelish a chronique scandaleuse; and thus, when soon after Marius saw\nthe world's wonder, he was already acquainted with the suspicions which\nhave ever since hung about her name.  Twelve o'clock was come before\nthey left the Forum, waiting in a little crowd to hear the Accensus,\naccording to old custom, proclaim the hour of noonday, at the moment\nwhen, from the steps of the Senate-house, the sun could be seen\nstanding between the Rostra and the Graecostasis.  He exerted for this\nfunction a strength of voice, which confirmed in Marius a judgment the\nmodern visitor may share with him, that Roman throats and Roman chests,\nnamely, must, in some peculiar way, be differently [177] constructed\nfrom those of other people.  Such judgment indeed he had formed in part\nthe evening before, noting, as a religious procession passed him, how\nmuch noise a man and a boy could make, though not without a great deal\nof real music, of which in truth the Romans were then as ever\npassionately fond.\n\nHence the two friends took their way through the Via Flaminia, almost\nalong the line of the modern Corso, already bordered with handsome\nvillas, turning presently to the left, into the Field-of-Mars, still\nthe playground of Rome.  But the vast public edifices were grown to be\nalmost continuous over the grassy expanse, represented now only by\noccasional open spaces of verdure and wild-flowers.  In one of these a\ncrowd was standing, to watch a party of athletes stripped for exercise.\nMarius had been surprised at the luxurious variety of the litters borne\nthrough Rome, where no carriage horses were allowed; and just then one\nfar more sumptuous than the rest, with dainty appointments of ivory and\ngold, was carried by, all the town pressing with eagerness to get a\nglimpse of its most beautiful woman, as she passed rapidly.  Yes!\nthere, was the wonder of the world--the empress Faustina herself:\nMarius could distinguish, could distinguish clearly, the well-known\nprofile, between the floating purple curtains.\n\nFor indeed all Rome was ready to burst into gaiety again, as it awaited\nwith much real [178] affection, hopeful and animated, the return of its\nemperor, for whose ovation various adornments were preparing along the\nstreets through which the imperial procession would pass.  He had left\nRome just twelve months before, amid immense gloom.  The alarm of a\nbarbarian insurrection along the whole line of the Danube had happened\nat the moment when Rome was panic-stricken by the great pestilence.\n\nIn fifty years of peace, broken only by that conflict in the East from\nwhich Lucius Verus, among other curiosities, brought back the plague,\nwar had come to seem a merely romantic, superannuated incident of\nbygone history.  And now it was almost upon Italian soil. Terrible were\nthe reports of the numbers and audacity of the assailants.  Aurelius,\nas yet untried in war, and understood by a few only in the whole scope\nof a really great character, was known to the majority of his subjects\nas but a careful administrator, though a student of philosophy,\nperhaps, as we say, a dilettante.  But he was also the visible centre\nof government, towards whom the hearts of a whole people turned,\ngrateful for fifty years of public happiness--its good genius, its\n\"Antonine\"--whose fragile person might be foreseen speedily giving way\nunder the trials of military life, with a disaster like that of the\nslaughter of the legions by Arminius. Prophecies of the world's\nimpending conflagration were easily credited: \"the secular fire\" would\ndescend from [179] heaven: superstitious fear had even demanded the\nsacrifice of a human victim.\n\nMarcus Aurelius, always philosophically considerate of the humours of\nother people, exercising also that devout appreciation of every\nreligious claim which was one of his characteristic habits, had\ninvoked, in aid of the commonwealth, not only all native gods, but all\nforeign deities as well, however strange.--\"Help!  Help! in the ocean\nspace!\"  A multitude of foreign priests had been welcomed to Rome, with\ntheir various peculiar religious rites.  The sacrifices made on this\noccasion were remembered for centuries; and the starving poor, at\nleast, found some satisfaction in the flesh of those herds of \"white\nbulls,\" which came into the city, day after day, to yield the savour of\ntheir blood to the gods.\n\nIn spite of all this, the legions had but followed their standards\ndespondently.  But prestige, personal prestige, the name of \"Emperor,\"\nstill had its magic power over the nations.  The mere approach of the\nRoman army made an impression on the barbarians. Aurelius and his\ncolleague had scarcely reached Aquileia when a deputation arrived to\nask for peace.  And now the two imperial \"brothers\" were returning home\nat leisure; were waiting, indeed, at a villa outside the walls, till\nthe capital had made ready to receive them.  But although Rome was thus\nin genial reaction, with much relief, [180] and hopefulness against the\nwinter, facing itself industriously in damask of red and gold, those\ntwo enemies were still unmistakably extant: the barbarian army of the\nDanube was but over-awed for a season; and the plague, as we saw when\nMarius was on his way to Rome, was not to depart till it had done a\nlarge part in the formation of the melancholy picturesque of modern\nItaly--till it had made, or prepared for the making of the Roman\nCampagna.  The old, unaffected, really pagan, peace or gaiety, of\nAntoninus Pius--that genuine though unconscious humanist--was gone for\never.  And again and again, throughout this day of varied observation,\nMarius had been reminded, above all else, that he was not merely in\n\"the most religious city of the world,\" as one had said, but that Rome\nwas become the romantic home of the wildest superstition.  Such\nsuperstition presented itself almost as religious mania in many an\nincident of his long ramble,--incidents to which he gave his full\nattention, though contending in some measure with a reluctance on the\npart of his companion, the motive of which he did not understand till\nlong afterwards.  Marius certainly did not allow this reluctance to\ndeter his own curiosity.  Had he not come to Rome partly under poetic\nvocation, to receive all those things, the very impress of life itself,\nupon the visual, the imaginative, organ, as upon a mirror; to reflect\nthem; to transmute them [181] into golden words?  He must observe that\nstrange medley of superstition, that centuries' growth, layer upon\nlayer, of the curiosities of religion (one faith jostling another out\nof place) at least for its picturesque interest, and as an indifferent\noutsider might, not too deeply concerned in the question which, if any\nof them, was to be the survivor.\n\nSuperficially, at least, the Roman religion, allying itself with much\ndiplomatic economy to possible rivals, was in possession, as a vast and\ncomplex system of usage, intertwining itself with every detail of\npublic and private life, attractively enough for those who had but \"the\nhistoric temper,\" and a taste for the past, however much a Lucian might\ndepreciate it.  Roman religion, as Marius knew, had, indeed, been\nalways something to be done, rather than something to be thought, or\nbelieved, or loved; something to be done in minutely detailed manner,\nat a particular time and place, correctness in which had long been a\nmatter of laborious learning with a whole school of ritualists--as\nalso, now and again, a matter of heroic sacrifice with certain\nexceptionally devout souls, as when Caius Fabius Dorso, with his life\nin his hand, succeeded in passing the sentinels of the invading Gauls\nto perform a sacrifice on the Quirinal, and, thanks to the divine\nprotection, had returned in safety.  So jealous was the distinction\nbetween sacred and profane, that, in the matter [182] of the \"regarding\nof days,\" it had made more than half the year a holiday.  Aurelius had,\nindeed, ordained that there should be no more than a hundred and\nthirty-five festival days in the year; but in other respects he had\nfollowed in the steps of his predecessor, Antoninus Pius--commended\nespecially for his \"religion,\" his conspicuous devotion to its public\nceremonies--and whose coins are remarkable for their reference to the\noldest and most hieratic types of Roman mythology.  Aurelius had\nsucceeded in more than healing the old feud between philosophy and\nreligion, displaying himself, in singular combination, as at once the\nmost zealous of philosophers and the most devout of polytheists, and\nlending himself, with an air of conviction, to all the pageantries of\npublic worship.  To his pious recognition of that one orderly spirit,\nwhich, according to the doctrine of the Stoics, diffuses itself through\nthe world, and animates it--a recognition taking the form, with him, of\na constant effort towards inward likeness thereto, in the harmonious\norder of his own soul--he had added a warm personal devotion towards\nthe whole multitude of the old national gods, and a great many new\nforeign ones besides, by him, at least, not ignobly conceived.  If the\ncomparison may be reverently made, there was something here of the\nmethod by which the catholic church has added the cultus of the saints\nto its worship of the one Divine Being.\n\n[183] And to the view of the majority, though the emperor, as the\npersonal centre of religion, entertained the hope of converting his\npeople to philosophic faith, and had even pronounced certain public\ndiscourses for their instruction in it, that polytheistic devotion was\nhis most striking feature.  Philosophers, indeed, had, for the most\npart, thought with Seneca, \"that a man need not lift his hands to\nheaven, nor ask the sacristan's leave to put his mouth to the ear of an\nimage, that his prayers might be heard the better.\"--Marcus Aurelius,\n\"a master in Israel,\" knew all that well enough.  Yet his outward\ndevotion was much more than a concession to popular sentiment, or a\nmere result of that sense of fellow-citizenship with others, which had\nmade him again and again, under most difficult circumstances, an\nexcellent comrade.  Those others, too!--amid all their ignorances, what\nwere they but instruments in the administration of the Divine Reason,\n\"from end to end sweetly and strongly disposing all things\"?  Meantime\n\"Philosophy\" itself had assumed much of what we conceive to be the\nreligious character.  It had even cultivated the habit, the power, of\n\"spiritual direction\"; the troubled soul making recourse in its hour of\ndestitution, or amid the distractions of the world, to this or that\ndirector--philosopho suo--who could really best understand it.\n\nAnd it had been in vain that the old, grave [184] and discreet religion\nof Rome had set itself, according to its proper genius, to prevent or\nsubdue all trouble and disturbance in men's souls.  In religion, as in\nother matters, plebeians, as such, had a taste for movement, for\nrevolution; and it had been ever in the most populous quarters that\nreligious changes began.  To the apparatus of foreign religion, above\nall, recourse had been made in times of public disquietude or sudden\nterror; and in those great religious celebrations, before his\nproceeding against the barbarians, Aurelius had even restored the\nsolemnities of Isis, prohibited in the capital since the time of\nAugustus, making no secret of his worship of that goddess, though her\ntemple had been actually destroyed by authority in the reign of\nTiberius.  Her singular and in many ways beautiful ritual was now\npopular in Rome.  And then--what the enthusiasm of the swarming\nplebeian quarters had initiated, was sure to be adopted, sooner or\nlater, by women of fashion.  A blending of all the religions of the\nancient world had been accomplished.  The new gods had arrived, had\nbeen welcomed, and found their places; though, certainly, with no real\nsecurity, in any adequate ideal of the divine nature itself in the\nbackground of men's minds, that the presence of the new-comer should be\nedifying, or even refining.  High and low addressed themselves to all\ndeities alike without scruple; confusing them together when they\nprayed, and in the old, [185] authorised, threefold veneration of their\nvisible images, by flowers, incense, and ceremonial lights--those\nbeautiful usages, which the church, in her way through the world, ever\nmaking spoil of the world's goods for the better uses of the human\nspirit, took up and sanctified in her service.\n\nAnd certainly \"the most religious city in the world\" took no care to\nveil its devotion, however fantastic.  The humblest house had its\nlittle chapel or shrine, its image and lamp; while almost every one\nseemed to exercise some religious function and responsibility.\nColleges, composed for the most part of slaves and of the poor,\nprovided for the service of the Compitalian Lares--the gods who\npresided, respectively, over the several quarters of the city.  In one\nstreet, Marius witnessed an incident of the festival of the patron\ndeity of that neighbourhood, the way being strewn with box, the houses\ntricked out gaily in such poor finery as they possessed, while the\nancient idol was borne through it in procession, arrayed in gaudy\nattire the worse for wear.  Numerous religious clubs had their stated\nanniversaries, on which the members issued with much ceremony from\ntheir guild-hall, or schola, and traversed the thoroughfares of Rome,\npreceded, like the confraternities of the present day, by their sacred\nbanners, to offer sacrifice before some famous image.  Black with the\nperpetual smoke of lamps and incense, oftenest old and [186] ugly,\nperhaps on that account the more likely to listen to the desires of the\nsuffering--had not those sacred effigies sometimes given sensible\ntokens that they were aware?  The image of the Fortune of\nWomen--Fortuna Muliebris, in the Latin Way, had spoken (not once only)\nand declared; Bene me, Matronae! vidistis riteque dedicastis! The\nApollo of Cumae had wept during three whole nights and days.  The\nimages in the temple of Juno Sospita had been seen to sweat.  Nay!\nthere was blood--divine blood--in the hearts of some of them: the\nimages in the Grove of Feronia had sweated blood!\n\nFrom one and all Cornelius had turned away: like the \"atheist\" of whom\nApuleius tells he had never once raised hand to lip in passing image or\nsanctuary, and had parted from Marius finally when the latter\ndetermined to enter the crowded doorway of a temple, on their return\ninto the Forum, below the Palatine hill, where the mothers were\npressing in, with a multitude of every sort of children, to touch the\nlightning-struck image of the wolf-nurse of Romulus--so tender to\nlittle ones!--just discernible in its dark shrine, amid a blaze of\nlights.  Marius gazed after his companion of the day, as he mounted the\nsteps to his lodging, singing to himself, as it seemed. Marius failed\nprecisely to catch the words.\n\nAnd, as the rich, fresh evening came on, there was heard all over Rome,\nfar above a whisper, [187] the whole town seeming hushed to catch it\ndistinctly, the lively, reckless call to \"play,\" from the sons and\ndaughters of foolishness, to those in whom their life was still\ngreen--Donec virenti canities abest!--Donec virenti canities abest!+\nMarius could hardly doubt how Cornelius would have taken the call.  And\nas for himself, slight as was the burden of positive moral obligation\nwith which he had entered Rome, it was to no wasteful and vagrant\naffections, such as these, that his Epicureanism had committed him.\n\nNOTES\n\n187. +Horace, Odes I.ix.17.  Translation: \"So long as youth is fresh\nand age is far away.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII: THE DIVINITY THAT DOTH HEDGE A KING\n\n     But ah!  Maecenas is yclad in claye,\n     And great Augustus long ygoe is dead,\n     And all the worthies liggen wrapt in lead,\n     That matter made for poets on to playe.+\n\n[188] MARCUS AURELIUS who, though he had little relish for them\nhimself, had ever been willing to humour the taste of his people for\nmagnificent spectacles, was received back to Rome with the lesser\nhonours of the Ovation, conceded by the Senate (so great was the public\nsense of deliverance) with even more than the laxity which had become\nits habit under imperial rule, for there had been no actual bloodshed\nin the late achievement.  Clad in the civic dress of the chief Roman\nmagistrate, and with a crown of myrtle upon his head, his colleague\nsimilarly attired walking beside him, he passed up to the Capitol on\nfoot, though in solemn procession along the Sacred Way, to offer\nsacrifice to the national gods.  The victim, a goodly sheep, whose\nimage we may still see between the pig and the ox of the [189]\nSuovetaurilia, filleted and stoled almost like some ancient canon of\nthe church, on a sculptured fragment in the Forum, was conducted by the\npriests, clad in rich white vestments, and bearing their sacred\nutensils of massive gold, immediately behind a company of\nflute-players, led by the great choir-master, or conductor, of the day,\nvisibly tetchy or delighted, according as the instruments he ruled with\nhis tuning-rod, rose, more or less adequately amid the difficulties of\nthe way, to the dream of perfect music in the soul within him.  The\nvast crowd, including the soldiers of the triumphant army, now restored\nto wives and children, all alike in holiday whiteness, had left their\nhouses early in the fine, dry morning, in a real affection for \"the\nfather of his country,\" to await the procession, the two princes having\nspent the preceding night outside the walls, at the old Villa of the\nRepublic.  Marius, full of curiosity, had taken his position with much\ncare; and stood to see the world's masters pass by, at an angle from\nwhich he could command the view of a great part of the processional\nroute, sprinkled with fine yellow sand, and punctiliously guarded from\nprofane footsteps.\n\nThe coming of the pageant was announced by the clear sound of the\nflutes, heard at length above the acclamations of the people--Salve\nImperator!--Dii te servent!--shouted in regular time, over the hills.\nIt was on the central [190] figure, of course, that the whole attention\nof Marius was fixed from the moment when the procession came in sight,\npreceded by the lictors with gilded fasces, the imperial image-bearers,\nand the pages carrying lighted torches; a band of knights, among whom\nwas Cornelius in complete military, array, following.  Amply swathed\nabout in the folds of a richly worked toga, after a manner now long\nsince become obsolete with meaner persons, Marius beheld a man of about\nfive-and-forty years of age, with prominent eyes--eyes, which although\ndemurely downcast during this essentially religious ceremony, were by\nnature broadly and benignantly observant.  He was still, in the main,\nas we see him in the busts which represent his gracious and courtly\nyouth, when Hadrian had playfully called him, not Verus, after the name\nof his father, but Verissimus, for his candour of gaze, and the bland\ncapacity of the brow, which, below the brown hair, clustering thickly\nas of old, shone out low, broad, and clear, and still without a trace\nof the trouble of his lips.  You saw the brow of one who, amid the\nblindness or perplexity of the people about him, understood all things\nclearly; the dilemma, to which his experience so far had brought him,\nbetween Chance with meek resignation, and a Providence with boundless\npossibilities and hope, being for him at least distinctly defined.\n\nThat outward serenity, which he valued so [191] highly as a point of\nmanner or expression not unworthy the care of a public\nminister--outward symbol, it might be thought, of the inward religious\nserenity it had been his constant purpose to maintain--was increased\nto-day by his sense of the gratitude of his people; that his life had\nbeen one of such gifts and blessings as made his person seem in very\ndeed divine to them.  Yet the cloud of some reserved internal sorrow,\npassing from time to time into an expression of fatigue and effort, of\nloneliness amid the shouting multitude, might have been detected there\nby the more observant--as if the sagacious hint of one of his officers,\n\"The soldiers can't understand you, they don't know Greek,\" were\napplicable always to his relationships with other people.  The nostrils\nand mouth seemed capable almost of peevishness; and Marius noted in\nthem, as in the hands, and in the spare body generally, what was new to\nhis experience--something of asceticism, as we say, of a bodily\ngymnastic, by which, although it told pleasantly in the clear blue\nhumours of the eye, the flesh had scarcely been an equal gainer with\nthe spirit.  It was hardly the expression of \"the healthy mind in the\nhealthy body,\" but rather of a sacrifice of the body to the soul, its\nneeds and aspirations, that Marius seemed to divine in this assiduous\nstudent of the Greek sages--a sacrifice, in truth, far beyond the\ndemands of their very saddest philosophy of life.\n\n[192] Dignify thyself with modesty and simplicity for thine\nornaments!--had been ever a maxim with this dainty and high-bred Stoic,\nwho still thought manners a true part of morals, according to the old\nsense of the term, and who regrets now and again that he cannot control\nhis thoughts equally well with his countenance.  That outward composure\nwas deepened during the solemnities of this day by an air of pontifical\nabstraction; which, though very far from being pride--nay, a sort of\nhumility rather--yet gave, to himself, an air of unapproachableness,\nand to his whole proceeding, in which every minutest act was\nconsidered, the character of a ritual.  Certainly, there was no\nhaughtiness, social, moral, or even philosophic, in Aurelius, who had\nrealised, under more trying conditions perhaps than any one before,\nthat no element of humanity could be alien from him. Yet, as he walked\nto-day, the centre of ten thousand observers, with eyes discreetly\nfixed on the ground, veiling his head at times and muttering very\nrapidly the words of the \"supplications,\" there was something many\nspectators may have noted as a thing new in their experience, for\nAurelius, unlike his predecessors, took all this with absolute\nseriousness.  The doctrine of the sanctity of kings, that, in the words\nof Tacitus, Princes are as Gods--Principes instar deorum esse--seemed\nto have taken a novel, because a literal, sense.  For Aurelius, indeed,\nthe old legend of his descent from Numa, from [193] Numa who had talked\nwith the gods, meant much.  Attached in very early years to the service\nof the altars, like many another noble youth, he was \"observed to\nperform all his sacerdotal functions with a constancy and exactness\nunusual at that age; was soon a master of the sacred music; and had all\nthe forms and ceremonies by heart.\" And now, as the emperor, who had\nnot only a vague divinity about his person, but was actually the chief\nreligious functionary of the state, recited from time to time the forms\nof invocation, he needed not the help of the prompter, or\nceremoniarius, who then approached, to assist him by whispering the\nappointed words in his ear.  It was that pontifical abstraction which\nthen impressed itself on Marius as the leading outward characteristic\nof Aurelius; though to him alone, perhaps, in that vast crowd of\nobservers, it was no strange thing, but a matter he had understood from\nof old.\n\nSome fanciful writers have assigned the origin of these triumphal\nprocessions to the mythic pomps of Dionysus, after his conquests in the\nEast; the very word Triumph being, according to this supposition, only\nThriambos-the Dionysiac Hymn.  And certainly the younger of the two\nimperial \"brothers,\" who, with the effect of a strong contrast, walked\nbeside Aurelius, and shared the honours of the day, might well have\nreminded people of the delicate Greek god of flowers and wine. This\n[194] new conqueror of the East was now about thirty-six years old, but\nwith his scrupulous care for all the advantages of his person, and a\nsoft curling beard powdered with gold, looked many years younger.  One\nresult of the more genial element in the wisdom of Aurelius had been\nthat, amid most difficult circumstances, he had known throughout life\nhow to act in union with persons of character very alien from his own;\nto be more than loyal to the colleague, the younger brother in empire,\nhe had too lightly taken to himself, five years before, then an\nuncorrupt youth, \"skilled in manly exercises and fitted for war.\"  When\nAurelius thanks the gods that a brother had fallen to his lot, whose\ncharacter was a stimulus to the proper care of his own, one sees that\nthis could only have happened in the way of an example, putting him on\nhis guard against insidious faults. But it is with sincere amiability\nthat the imperial writer, who was indeed little used to be ironical,\nadds that the lively respect and affection of the junior had often\n\"gladdened\" him.  To be able to make his use of the flower, when the\nfruit perhaps was useless or poisonous:--that was one of the practical\nsuccesses of his philosophy; and his people noted, with a blessing,\n\"the concord of the two Augusti.\"\n\nThe younger, certainly, possessed in full measure that charm of a\nconstitutional freshness of aspect which may defy for a long time\nextravagant or erring habits of life; a physiognomy, [195]\nhealthy-looking, cleanly, and firm, which seemed unassociable with any\nform of self-torment, and made one think of the muzzle of some young\nhound or roe, such as human beings invariably like to stroke--a\nphysiognomy, in effect, with all the goodliness of animalism of the\nfiner sort, though still wholly animal.  The charm was that of the\nblond head, the unshrinking gaze, the warm tints: neither more nor less\nthan one may see every English summer, in youth, manly enough, and with\nthe stuff which makes brave soldiers, in spite of the natural kinship\nit seems to have with playthings and gay flowers. But innate in Lucius\nVerus there was that more than womanly fondness for fond things, which\nhad made the atmosphere of the old city of Antioch, heavy with\ncenturies of voluptuousness, a poison to him: he had come to love his\ndelicacies best out of season, and would have gilded the very flowers.\nBut with a wonderful power of self-obliteration, the elder brother at\nthe capital had directed his procedure successfully, and allowed him,\nbecome now also the husband of his daughter Lucilla, the credit of a\n\"Conquest,\" though Verus had certainly not returned a conqueror over\nhimself.  He had returned, as we know, with the plague in his company,\nalong with many another strange creature of his folly; and when the\npeople saw him publicly feeding his favourite horse Fleet with almonds\nand sweet grapes, wearing the animal's image in gold, and [196] finally\nbuilding it a tomb, they felt, with some un-sentimental misgiving, that\nhe might revive the manners of Nero.--What if, in the chances of war,\nhe should survive the protecting genius of that elder brother?\n\nHe was all himself to-day: and it was with much wistful curiosity that\nMarius regarded him.  For Lucius Verus was, indeed, but the highly\nexpressive type of a class,--the true son of his father, adopted by\nHadrian.  Lucius Verus the elder, also, had had the like strange\ncapacity for misusing the adornments of life, with a masterly grace; as\nif such misusing were, in truth, the quite adequate occupation of an\nintelligence, powerful, but distorted by cynical philosophy or some\ndisappointment of the heart.  It was almost a sort of genius, of which\nthere had been instances in the imperial purple: it was to ascend the\nthrone, a few years later, in the person of one, now a hopeful little\nlad at home in the palace; and it had its following, of course, among\nthe wealthy youth at Rome, who concentrated no inconsiderable force of\nshrewdness and tact upon minute details of attire and manner, as upon\nthe one thing needful. Certainly, flowers were pleasant to the eye.\nSuch things had even their sober use, as making the outside of human\nlife superficially attractive, and thereby promoting the first steps\ntowards friendship and social amity.  But what precise place could\nthere be for Verus and his peculiar charm, [197] in that Wisdom, that\nOrder of divine Reason \"reaching from end to end, strongly and sweetly\ndisposing all things,\" from the vision of which Aurelius came down, so\ntolerant of persons like him?  Into such vision Marius too was\ncertainly well-fitted to enter, yet, noting the actual perfection of\nLucius Verus after his kind, his undeniable achievement of the select,\nin all minor things, felt, though with some suspicion of himself, that\nhe entered into, and could understand, this other so dubious sort of\ncharacter also.  There was a voice in the theory he had brought to Rome\nwith him which whispered \"nothing is either great nor small;\" as there\nwere times when he could have thought that, as the \"grammarian's\" or\nthe artist's ardour of soul may be satisfied by the perfecting of the\ntheory of a sentence, or the adjustment of two colours, so his own life\nalso might have been fulfilled by an enthusiastic quest after\nperfection--say, in the flowering and folding of a toga.\n\nThe emperors had burned incense before the image of Jupiter, arrayed in\nits most gorgeous apparel, amid sudden shouts from the people of Salve\nImperator! turned now from the living princes to the deity, as they\ndiscerned his countenance through the great open doors.  The imperial\nbrothers had deposited their crowns of myrtle on the richly embroidered\nlapcloth of the god; and, with their chosen guests, sat down to a\npublic feast in the temple [198] itself.  There followed what was,\nafter all, the great event of the day:--an appropriate discourse, a\ndiscourse almost wholly de contemptu mundi, delivered in the presence\nof the assembled Senate, by the emperor Aurelius, who had thus, on\ncertain rare occasions, condescended to instruct his people, with the\ndouble authority of a chief pontiff and a laborious student of\nphilosophy.  In those lesser honours of the ovation, there had been no\nattendant slave behind the emperors, to make mock of their effulgence\nas they went; and it was as if with the discretion proper to a\nphilosopher, and in fear of a jealous Nemesis, he had determined\nhimself to protest in time against the vanity of all outward success.\n\nThe Senate was assembled to hear the emperor's discourse in the vast\nhall of the Curia Julia.  A crowd of high-bred youths idled around, or\non the steps before the doors, with the marvellous toilets Marius had\nnoticed in the Via Nova; in attendance, as usual, to learn by\nobservation the minute points of senatorial procedure.  Marius had\nalready some acquaintance with them, and passing on found himself\nsuddenly in the presence of what was still the most august assembly the\nworld had seen.  Under Aurelius, ever full of veneration for this\nancient traditional guardian of public religion, the Senate had\nrecovered all its old dignity and independence.  Among its members many\n[199] hundreds in number, visibly the most distinguished of them all,\nMarius noted the great sophists or rhetoricians of the day, in all\ntheir magnificence.  The antique character of their attire, and the\nancient mode of wearing it, still surviving with them, added to the\nimposing character of their persons, while they sat, with their staves\nof ivory in their hands, on their curule chairs--almost the exact\npattern of the chair still in use in the Roman church when a Bishop\npontificates at the divine offices--\"tranquil and unmoved, with a\nmajesty that seemed divine,\" as Marius thought, like the old Gaul of\nthe Invasion.  The rays of the early November sunset slanted full upon\nthe audience, and made it necessary for the officers of the Court to\ndraw the purple curtains over the windows, adding to the solemnity of\nthe scene.  In the depth of those warm shadows, surrounded by her\nladies, the empress Faustina was seated to listen. The beautiful Greek\nstatue of Victory, which since the days of Augustus had presided over\nthe assemblies of the Senate, had been brought into the hall, and\nplaced near the chair of the emperor; who, after rising to perform a\nbrief sacrificial service in its honour, bowing reverently to the\nassembled fathers left and right, took his seat and began to speak.\n\nThere was a certain melancholy grandeur in the very simplicity or\ntriteness of the theme: as it were the very quintessence of all the old\n[200] Roman epitaphs, of all that was monumental in that city of tombs,\nlayer upon layer of dead things and people.  As if in the very fervour\nof disillusion, he seemed to be composing--H\u00c3\u00b4sper epigraphas chron\u00c3\u00b4n\nkai hol\u00c3\u00b4n ethn\u00c3\u00b4n+--the sepulchral titles of ages and whole peoples;\nnay! the very epitaph of the living Rome itself.  The grandeur of the\nruins of Rome,--heroism in ruin: it was under the influence of an\nimaginative anticipation of this, that he appeared to be speaking.  And\nthough the impression of the actual greatness of Rome on that day was\nbut enhanced by the strain of contempt, falling with an accent of\npathetic conviction from the emperor himself, and gaining from his\npontifical pretensions the authority of a religious intimation, yet the\ncurious interest of the discourse lay in this, that Marius, for one, as\nhe listened, seemed to forsee a grass-grown Forum, the broken ways of\nthe Capitol, and the Palatine hill itself in humble occupation.  That\nimpression connected itself with what he had already noted of an actual\nchange even then coming over Italian scenery.  Throughout, he could\ntrace something of a humour into which Stoicism at all times tends to\nfall, the tendency to cry, Abase yourselves!  There was here the almost\ninhuman impassibility of one who had thought too closely on the\nparadoxical aspect of the love of posthumous fame.  With the ascetic\npride which lurks under all Platonism, [201] resultant from its\nopposition of the seen to the unseen, as falsehood to truth--the\nimperial Stoic, like his true descendant, the hermit of the middle age,\nwas ready, in no friendly humour, to mock, there in its narrow bed, the\ncorpse which had made so much of itself in life.  Marius could but\ncontrast all that with his own Cyrenaic eagerness, just then, to taste\nand see and touch; reflecting on the opposite issues deducible from the\nsame text.  \"The world, within me and without, flows away like a\nriver,\" he had said; \"therefore let me make the most of what is here\nand now.\"--\"The world and the thinker upon it, are consumed like a\nflame,\" said Aurelius, \"therefore will I turn away my eyes from vanity:\nrenounce: withdraw myself alike from all affections.\"  He seemed\ntacitly to claim as a sort of personal dignity, that he was very\nfamiliarly versed in this view of things, and could discern a\ndeath's-head everywhere.  Now and again Marius was reminded of the\nsaying that \"with the Stoics all people are the vulgar save\nthemselves;\" and at times the orator seemed to have forgotten his\naudience, and to be speaking only to himself.\n\n\"Art thou in love with men's praises, get thee into the very soul of\nthem, and see!--see what judges they be, even in those matters which\nconcern themselves.  Wouldst thou have their praise after death,\nbethink thee, that they who shall come hereafter, and with whom thou\n[202] wouldst survive by thy great name, will be but as these, whom\nhere thou hast found so hard to live with.  For of a truth, the soul of\nhim who is aflutter upon renown after death, presents not this aright\nto itself, that of all whose memory he would have each one will\nlikewise very quickly depart, until memory herself be put out, as she\njourneys on by means of such as are themselves on the wing but for a\nwhile, and are extinguished in their turn.--Making so much of those\nthou wilt never see!  It is as if thou wouldst have had those who were\nbefore thee discourse fair things concerning thee.\n\n\"To him, indeed, whose wit hath been whetted by true doctrine, that\nwell-worn sentence of Homer sufficeth, to guard him against regret and\nfear.--\n\n                     Like the race of leaves\n      The race of man is:--\n\n                         The wind in autumn strows\n      The earth with old leaves: then the spring\n         the woods with new endows.+\n\nLeaves! little leaves!--thy children, thy flatterers, thine enemies!\nLeaves in the wind, those who would devote thee to darkness, who scorn\nor miscall thee here, even as they also whose great fame shall outlast\nthem.  For all these, and the like of them, are born indeed in the\nspring season--Earos epigignetai h\u00c3\u00b4r\u00c3\u00aa+: and soon a wind hath scattered\nthem, and thereafter the [203] wood peopleth itself again with another\ngeneration of leaves.  And what is common to all of them is but the\nlittleness of their lives: and yet wouldst thou love and hate, as if\nthese things should continue for ever.  In a little while thine eyes\nalso will be closed, and he on whom thou perchance hast leaned thyself\nbe himself a burden upon another.\n\n\"Bethink thee often of the swiftness with which the things that are, or\nare even now coming to be, are swept past thee: that the very substance\nof them is but the perpetual motion of water: that there is almost\nnothing which continueth: of that bottomless depth of time, so close at\nthy side.  Folly! to be lifted up, or sorrowful, or anxious, by reason\nof things like these!  Think of infinite matter, and thy portion--how\ntiny a particle, of it! of infinite time, and thine own brief point\nthere; of destiny, and the jot thou art in it; and yield thyself\nreadily to the wheel of Clotho, to spin of thee what web she will.\n\n\"As one casting a ball from his hand, the nature of things hath had its\naim with every man, not as to the ending only, but the first beginning\nof his course, and passage thither.  And hath the ball any profit of\nits rising, or loss as it descendeth again, or in its fall? or the\nbubble, as it groweth or breaketh on the air? or the flame of the lamp,\nfrom the beginning to the end of its brief story?\n\n[204] \"All but at this present that future is, in which nature, who\ndisposeth all things in order, will transform whatsoever thou now\nseest, fashioning from its substance somewhat else, and therefrom\nsomewhat else in its turn, lest the world grow old.  We are such stuff\nas dreams are made of--disturbing dreams.  Awake, then! and see thy\ndream as it is, in comparison with that erewhile it seemed to thee.\n\n\"And for me, especially, it were well to mind those many mutations of\nempire in time past; therein peeping also upon the future, which must\nneeds be of like species with what hath been, continuing ever within\nthe rhythm and number of things which really are; so that in forty\nyears one may note of man and of his ways little less than in a\nthousand.  Ah! from this higher place, look we down upon the\nship-wrecks and the calm!  Consider, for example, how the world went,\nunder the emperor Vespasian.  They are married and given in marriage,\nthey breed children; love hath its way with them; they heap up riches\nfor others or for themselves; they are murmuring at things as then they\nare; they are seeking for great place; crafty, flattering, suspicious,\nwaiting upon the death of others:--festivals, business, war, sickness,\ndissolution: and now their whole life is no longer anywhere at all.\nPass on to the reign of Trajan: all things continue the same: and that\nlife also is no longer anywhere at all. [205] Ah! but look again, and\nconsider, one after another, as it were the sepulchral inscriptions of\nall peoples and times, according to one pattern.--What multitudes,\nafter their utmost striving--a little afterwards! were dissolved again\ninto their dust.\n\n\"Think again of life as it was far off in the ancient world; as it must\nbe when we shall be gone; as it is now among the wild heathen. How many\nhave never heard your names and mine, or will soon forget them!  How\nsoon may those who shout my name to-day begin to revile it, because\nglory, and the memory of men, and all things beside, are but vanity--a\nsand-heap under the senseless wind, the barking of dogs, the\nquarrelling of children, weeping incontinently upon their laughter.\n\n\"This hasteth to be; that other to have been: of that which now cometh\nto be, even now somewhat hath been extinguished.  And wilt thou make\nthy treasure of any one of these things?  It were as if one set his\nlove upon the swallow, as it passeth out of sight through the air!\n\n\"Bethink thee often, in all contentions public and private, of those\nwhom men have remembered by reason of their anger and vehement\nspirit--those famous rages, and the occasions of them--the great\nfortunes, and misfortunes, of men's strife of old.  What are they all\nnow, and the dust of their battles?  Dust [206] and ashes indeed; a\nfable, a mythus, or not so much as that.  Yes! keep those before thine\neyes who took this or that, the like of which happeneth to thee, so\nhardly; were so querulous, so agitated.  And where again are they?\nWouldst thou have it not otherwise with thee?\n\nConsider how quickly all things vanish away--their bodily structure\ninto the general substance; the very memory of them into that great\ngulf and abysm of past thoughts.  Ah! 'tis on a tiny space of earth\nthou art creeping through life--a pigmy soul carrying a dead body to\nits grave.\n\n\"Let death put thee upon the consideration both of thy body and thy\nsoul: what an atom of all matter hath been distributed to thee; what a\nlittle particle of the universal mind.  Turn thy body about, and\nconsider what thing it is, and that which old age, and lust, and the\nlanguor of disease can make of it.  Or come to its substantial and\ncausal qualities, its very type: contemplate that in itself, apart from\nthe accidents of matter, and then measure also the span of time for\nwhich the nature of things, at the longest, will maintain that special\ntype.  Nay! in the very principles and first constituents of things\ncorruption hath its part--so much dust, humour, stench, and scraps of\nbone!  Consider that thy marbles are but the earth's callosities, thy\ngold and silver its faeces; this silken robe but a worm's bedding, and\nthy [207] purple an unclean fish.  Ah! and thy life's breath is not\notherwise, as it passeth out of matters like these, into the like of\nthem again.\n\n\"For the one soul in things, taking matter like wax in the hands,\nmoulds and remoulds--how hastily!--beast, and plant, and the babe, in\nturn: and that which dieth hath not slipped out of the order of nature,\nbut, remaining therein, hath also its changes there, disparting into\nthose elements of which nature herself, and thou too, art compacted.\nShe changes without murmuring.  The oaken chest falls to pieces with no\nmore complaining than when the carpenter fitted it together.  If one\ntold thee certainly that on the morrow thou shouldst die, or at the\nfurthest on the day after, it would be no great matter to thee to die\non the day after to-morrow, rather than to-morrow.  Strive to think it\na thing no greater that thou wilt die--not to-morrow, but a year, or\ntwo years, or ten years from to-day.\n\n\"I find that all things are now as they were in the days of our buried\nancestors--all things sordid in their elements, trite by long usage,\nand yet ephemeral.  How ridiculous, then, how like a countryman in\ntown, is he, who wonders at aught.  Doth the sameness, the repetition\nof the public shows, weary thee?  Even so doth that likeness of events\nin the spectacle of the world.  And so must it be with thee to the end.\nFor the wheel of the world hath ever the same [208] motion, upward and\ndownward, from generation to generation. When, when, shall time give\nplace to eternity?\n\n\"If there be things which trouble thee thou canst put them away,\ninasmuch as they have their being but in thine own notion concerning\nthem.  Consider what death is, and how, if one does but detach from it\nthe appearances, the notions, that hang about it, resting the eye upon\nit as in itself it really is, it must be thought of but as an effect of\nnature, and that man but a child whom an effect of nature shall\naffright.  Nay! not function and effect of nature, only; but a thing\nprofitable also to herself.\n\n\"To cease from action--the ending of thine effort to think and do:\nthere is no evil in that.  Turn thy thought to the ages of man's life,\nboyhood, youth, maturity, old age: the change in every one of these\nalso is a dying, but evil nowhere.  Thou climbedst into the ship, thou\nhast made thy voyage and touched the shore.  Go forth now! Be it into\nsome other life: the divine breath is everywhere, even there.  Be it\ninto forgetfulness for ever; at least thou wilt rest from the beating\nof sensible images upon thee, from the passions which pluck thee this\nway and that like an unfeeling toy, from those long marches of the\nintellect, from thy toilsome ministry to the flesh.\n\n\"Art thou yet more than dust and ashes and bare bone--a name only, or\nnot so much as [209] that, which, also, is but whispering and a\nresonance, kept alive from mouth to mouth of dying abjects who have\nhardly known themselves; how much less thee, dead so long ago!\n\n\"When thou lookest upon a wise man, a lawyer, a captain of war, think\nupon another gone.  When thou seest thine own face in the glass, call\nup there before thee one of thine ancestors--one of those old Caesars.\nLo! everywhere, thy double before thee!  Thereon, let the thought occur\nto thee: And where are they? anywhere at all, for ever? And thou,\nthyself--how long?  Art thou blind to that thou art--thy matter, how\ntemporal; and thy function, the nature of thy business? Yet tarry, at\nleast, till thou hast assimilated even these things to thine own proper\nessence, as a quick fire turneth into heat and light whatsoever be cast\nupon it.\n\n\"As words once in use are antiquated to us, so is it with the names\nthat were once on all men's lips: Camillus, Volesus, Leonnatus: then,\nin a little while, Scipio and Cato, and then Augustus, and then\nHadrian, and then Antoninus Pius.  How many great physicians who lifted\nwise brows at other men's sick-beds, have sickened and died! Those wise\nChaldeans, who foretold, as a great matter, another man's last hour,\nhave themselves been taken by surprise.  Ay! and all those others, in\ntheir pleasant places: those who doated on a Capreae like [210]\nTiberius, on their gardens, on the baths: Pythagoras and Socrates, who\nreasoned so closely upon immortality: Alexander, who used the lives of\nothers as though his own should last for ever--he and his mule-driver\nalike now!--one upon another.  Well-nigh the whole court of Antoninus\nis extinct.  Panthea and Pergamus sit no longer beside the sepulchre of\ntheir lord.  The watchers over Hadrian's dust have slipped from his\nsepulchre.--It were jesting to stay longer.  Did they sit there still,\nwould the dead feel it? or feeling it, be glad? or glad, hold those\nwatchers for ever?  The time must come when they too shall be aged men\nand aged women, and decease, and fail from their places; and what shift\nwere there then for imperial service?  This too is but the breath of\nthe tomb, and a skinful of dead men's blood.\n\n\"Think again of those inscriptions, which belong not to one soul only,\nbut to whole families: Eschatos tou idiou genous:+ He was the last of\nhis race.  Nay! of the burial of whole cities: Helice, Pompeii: of\nothers, whose very burial place is unknown.\n\n\"Thou hast been a citizen in this wide city.  Count not for how long,\nnor repine; since that which sends thee hence is no unrighteous judge,\nno tyrant, but Nature, who brought thee hither; as when a player leaves\nthe stage at the bidding of the conductor who hired him.  Sayest thou,\n'I have not played five acts'?  True! but in [211] human life, three\nacts only make sometimes an entire play.  That is the composer's\nbusiness, not thine.  Withdraw thyself with a good will; for that too\nhath, perchance, a good will which dismisseth thee from thy part.\"\n\nThe discourse ended almost in darkness, the evening having set in\nsomewhat suddenly, with a heavy fall of snow.  The torches, made ready\nto do him a useless honour, were of real service now, as the emperor\nwas solemnly conducted home; one man rapidly catching light from\nanother--a long stream of moving lights across the white Forum, up the\ngreat stairs, to the palace.  And, in effect, that night winter began,\nthe hardest that had been known for a lifetime.  The wolves came from\nthe mountains; and, led by the carrion scent, devoured the dead bodies\nwhich had been hastily buried during the plague, and, emboldened by\ntheir meal, crept, before the short day was well past, over the walls\nof the farmyards of the Campagna.  The eagles were seen driving the\nflocks of smaller birds across the dusky sky.  Only, in the city itself\nthe winter was all the brighter for the contrast, among those who could\npay for light and warmth.  The habit-makers made a great sale of the\nspoil of all such furry creatures as had escaped wolves and eagles, for\npresents at the Saturnalia; and at no time had the winter roses from\nCarthage seemed more lustrously yellow and red.\n\nNOTES\n\n188. +Spenser, Shepheardes Calendar, October, 61-66.\n\n200. +Transliteration: H\u00c3\u00b4sper epigraphas chron\u00c3\u00b4n kai hol\u00c3\u00b4n ethn\u00c3\u00b4n.\nPater's Translation: \"the sepulchral titles of ages and whole peoples.\"\n\n202. +Homer, Iliad VI.146-48.\n\n202. +Transliteration: Earos epigignetai h\u00c3\u00b4r\u00c3\u00aa.

Attired in the newest\nmode, his legs wound in dainty fasciae of white leather, with the heavy\ngold ring of the ingenuus, and in his toga of ceremony, he still\nretained all his country freshness of complexion.  The eyes of the\n\"golden youth\" of Rome were upon him as the chosen friend of Cornelius,\nand the destined servant of the emperor; but not jealously.  In spite\nof, perhaps partly because of, his habitual reserve of manner, he had\nbecome \"the fashion,\" even among those who felt instinctively the irony\nwhich lay beneath that remarkable self-possession, as of one taking all\nthings with a [213] difference from other people, perceptible in voice,\nin expression, and even in his dress.  It was, in truth, the air of one\nwho, entering vividly into life, and relishing to the full the\ndelicacies of its intercourse, yet feels all the while, from the point\nof view of an ideal philosophy, that he is but conceding reality to\nsuppositions, choosing of his own will to walk in a day-dream, of the\nillusiveness of which he at least is aware.\n\nIn the house of the chief chamberlain Marius waited for the due moment\nof admission to the emperor's presence.  He was admiring the peculiar\ndecoration of the walls, coloured like rich old red leather. In the\nmidst of one of them was depicted, under a trellis of fruit you might\nhave gathered, the figure of a woman knocking at a door with wonderful\nreality of perspective.  Then the summons came; and in a few minutes,\nthe etiquette of the imperial household being still a simple matter, he\nhad passed the curtains which divided the central hall of the palace\ninto three parts--three degrees of approach to the sacred person--and\nwas speaking to Aurelius himself; not in Greek, in which the emperor\noftenest conversed with the learned, but, more familiarly, in Latin,\nadorned however, or disfigured, by many a Greek phrase, as now and\nagain French phrases have made the adornment of fashionable English. It\nwas with real kindliness that Marcus Aurelius looked upon Marius, as\n[214] a youth of great attainments in Greek letters and philosophy; and\nhe liked also his serious expression, being, as we know, a believer in\nthe doctrine of physiognomy--that, as he puts it, not love only, but\nevery other affection of man's soul, looks out very plainly from the\nwindow of the eyes.\n\nThe apartment in which Marius found himself was of ancient aspect, and\nrichly decorated with the favourite toys of two or three generations of\nimperial collectors, now finally revised by the high connoisseurship of\nthe Stoic emperor himself, though destined not much longer to remain\ntogether there.  It is the repeated boast of Aurelius that he had\nlearned from old Antoninus Pius to maintain authority without the\nconstant use of guards, in a robe woven by the handmaids of his own\nconsort, with no processional lights or images, and \"that a prince may\nshrink himself almost into the figure of a private gentleman.\"  And\nyet, again as at his first sight of him, Marius was struck by the\nprofound religiousness of the surroundings of the imperial presence.\nThe effect might have been due in part to the very simplicity, the\ndiscreet and scrupulous simplicity, of the central figure in this\nsplendid abode; but Marius could not forget that he saw before him not\nonly the head of the Roman religion, but one who might actually have\nclaimed something like divine worship, had he cared to do so.  Though\nthe fantastic pretensions of Caligula had brought some contempt [215]\non that claim, which had become almost a jest under the ungainly\nClaudius, yet, from Augustus downwards, a vague divinity had seemed to\nsurround the Caesars even in this life; and the peculiar character of\nAurelius, at once a ceremonious polytheist never forgetful of his\npontifical calling, and a philosopher whose mystic speculation\nencircled him with a sort of saintly halo, had restored to his person,\nwithout his intending it, something of that divine prerogative, or\nprestige.  Though he would never allow the immediate dedication of\naltars to himself, yet the image of his Genius--his spirituality or\ncelestial counterpart--was placed among those of the deified princes of\nthe past; and his family, including Faustina and the young Commodus,\nwas spoken of as the \"holy\" or \"divine\" house.  Many a Roman courtier\nagreed with the barbarian chief, who, after contemplating a predecessor\nof Aurelius, withdrew from his presence with the exclamation:--\"I have\nseen a god to-day!\"  The very roof of his house, rising into a pediment\nor gable, like that of the sanctuary of a god, the laurels on either\nside its doorway, the chaplet of oak-leaves above, seemed to designate\nthe place for religious veneration.  And notwithstanding all this, the\nhousehold of Aurelius was singularly modest, with none of the wasteful\nexpense of palaces after the fashion of Lewis the Fourteenth; the\npalatial dignity being felt only in a peculiar sense of order, the\nabsence [216] of all that was casual, of vulgarity and discomfort.  A\nmerely official residence of his predecessors, the Palatine had become\nthe favourite dwelling-place of Aurelius; its many-coloured memories\nsuiting, perhaps, his pensive character, and the crude splendours of\nNero and Hadrian being now subdued by time. The window-less Roman abode\nmust have had much of what to a modern would be gloom.  How did the\nchildren, one wonders, endure houses with so little escape for the eye\ninto the world outside?  Aurelius, who had altered little else,\nchoosing to live there, in a genuine homeliness, had shifted and made\nthe most of the level lights, and broken out a quite medieval window\nhere and there, and the clear daylight, fully appreciated by his\nyouthful visitor, made pleasant shadows among the objects of the\nimperial collection.  Some of these, indeed, by reason of their Greek\nsimplicity and grace, themselves shone out like spaces of a purer,\nearly light, amid the splendours of the Roman manufacture.\n\nThough he looked, thought Marius, like a man who did not sleep enough,\nhe was abounding and bright to-day, after one of those pitiless\nheadaches, which since boyhood had been the \"thorn in his side,\"\nchallenging the pretensions of his philosophy to fortify one in humble\nendurances.  At the first moment, to Marius, remembering the spectacle\nof the emperor in ceremony, it was almost bewildering to be in [217]\nprivate conversation with him.  There was much in the philosophy of\nAurelius--much consideration of mankind at large, of great bodies,\naggregates and generalities, after the Stoic manner--which, on a nature\nless rich than his, might have acted as an inducement to care for\npeople in inverse proportion to their nearness to him.  That has\nsometimes been the result of the Stoic cosmopolitanism.  Aurelius,\nhowever, determined to beautify by all means, great or little, a\ndoctrine which had in it some potential sourness, had brought all the\nquickness of his intelligence, and long years of observation, to bear\non the conditions of social intercourse.  He had early determined \"not\nto make business an excuse to decline the offices of humanity--not to\npretend to be too much occupied with important affairs to concede what\nlife with others may hourly demand;\" and with such success, that, in an\nage which made much of the finer points of that intercourse, it was\nfelt that the mere honesty of his conversation was more pleasing than\nother men's flattery.  His agreeableness to his young visitor to-day\nwas, in truth, a blossom of the same wisdom which had made of Lucius\nVerus really a brother--the wisdom of not being exigent with men, any\nmore than with fruit-trees (it is his own favourite figure) beyond\ntheir nature.  And there was another person, still nearer to him,\nregarding whom this wisdom became a marvel, of equity--of charity.\n\n[218] The centre of a group of princely children, in the same apartment\nwith Aurelius, amid all the refined intimacies of a modern home, sat\nthe empress Faustina, warming her hands over a fire.  With her long\nfingers lighted up red by the glowing coals of the brazier Marius\nlooked close upon the most beautiful woman in the world, who was also\nthe great paradox of the age, among her boys and girls.  As has been\ntruly said of the numerous representations of her in art, so in life,\nshe had the air of one curious, restless, to enter into conversation\nwith the first comer.  She had certainly the power of stimulating a\nvery ambiguous sort of curiosity about herself.  And Marius found this\nenigmatic point in her expression, that even after seeing her many\ntimes he could never precisely recall her features in absence.  The lad\nof six years, looking older, who stood beside her, impatiently plucking\na rose to pieces over the hearth, was, in outward appearance, his\nfather--the young Verissimus--over again; but with a certain feminine\nlength of feature, and with all his mother's alertness, or license, of\ngaze.\n\nYet rumour knocked at every door and window of the imperial house\nregarding the adulterers who knocked at them, or quietly left their\nlovers' garlands there.  Was not that likeness of the husband, in the\nboy beside her, really the effect of a shameful magic, in which the\nblood of the murdered gladiator, his true father, had been an\ningredient?  Were the tricks for [219] deceiving husbands which the\nRoman poet describes, really hers, and her household an efficient\nschool of all the arts of furtive love?  Or, was the husband too aware,\nlike every one beside?  Were certain sudden deaths which happened\nthere, really the work of apoplexy, or the plague?\n\nThe man whose ears, whose soul, those rumours were meant to penetrate,\nwas, however, faithful to his sanguine and optimist philosophy, to his\ndetermination that the world should be to him simply what the higher\nreason preferred to conceive it; and the life's journey Aurelius had\nmade so far, though involving much moral and intellectual loneliness,\nhad been ever in affectionate and helpful contact with other wayfarers,\nvery unlike himself.  Since his days of earliest childhood in the\nLateran gardens, he seemed to himself, blessing the gods for it after\ndeliberate survey, to have been always surrounded by kinsmen, friends,\nservants, of exceptional virtue.  From the great Stoic idea, that we\nare all fellow-citizens of one city, he had derived a tenderer, a more\nequitable estimate than was common among Stoics, of the eternal\nshortcomings of men and women.  Considerations that might tend to the\nsweetening of his temper it was his daily care to store away, with a\nkind of philosophic pride in the thought that no one took more\ngood-naturedly than he the \"oversights\" of his neighbours.  For had not\nPlato taught (it was not [220] paradox, but simple truth of experience)\nthat if people sin, it is because they know no better, and are \"under\nthe necessity of their own ignorance\"?  Hard to himself, he seemed at\ntimes, doubtless, to decline too softly upon unworthy persons.\nActually, he came thereby upon many a useful instrument.  The empress\nFaustina he would seem at least to have kept, by a constraining\naffection, from becoming altogether what most people have believed her,\nand won in her (we must take him at his word in the \"Thoughts,\"\nabundantly confirmed by letters, on both sides, in his correspondence\nwith Cornelius Fronto) a consolation, the more secure, perhaps, because\nmisknown of others.  Was the secret of her actual blamelessness, after\nall, with him who has at least screened her name?  At all events, the\none thing quite certain about her, besides her extraordinary beauty, is\nher sweetness to himself.\n\nNo!  The wise, who had made due observation on the trees of the garden,\nwould not expect to gather grapes of thorns or fig-trees: and he was\nthe vine, putting forth his genial fruit, by natural law, again and\nagain, after his kind, whatever use people might make of it. Certainly,\nhis actual presence never lost its power, and Faustina was glad in it\nto-day, the birthday of one of her children, a boy who stood at her\nknee holding in his fingers tenderly a tiny silver trumpet, one of his\nbirthday gifts.--\"For my [221] part, unless I conceive my hurt to be\nsuch, I have no hurt at all,\"--boasts the would-be apathetic\nemperor:--\"and how I care to conceive of the thing rests with me.\"  Yet\nwhen his children fall sick or die, this pretence breaks down, and he\nis broken-hearted: and one of the charms of certain of his letters\nstill extant, is his reference to those childish sicknesses.--\"On my\nreturn to Lorium,\" he writes, \"I found my little lady--domnulam\nmeam--in a fever;\" and again, in a letter to one of the most serious of\nmen, \"You will be glad to hear that our little one is better, and\nrunning about the room--parvolam nostram melius valere et intra\ncubiculum discurrere.\"\n\nThe young Commodus had departed from the chamber, anxious to witness\nthe exercises of certain gladiators, having a native taste for such\ncompany, inherited, according to popular rumour, from his true\nfather--anxious also to escape from the too impressive company of the\ngravest and sweetest specimen of old age Marius had ever seen, the\ntutor of the imperial children, who had arrived to offer his birthday\ncongratulations, and now, very familiarly and affectionately, made a\npart of the group, falling on the shoulders of the emperor, kissing the\nempress Faustina on the face, the little ones on the face and hands.\nMarcus Cornelius Fronto, the \"Orator,\" favourite teacher of the\nemperor's youth, afterwards his most trusted counsellor, and now the\nundisputed occupant of the sophistic throne, whose equipage, [222]\nelegantly mounted with silver, Marius had seen in the streets of Rome,\nhad certainly turned his many personal gifts to account with a good\nfortune, remarkable even in that age, so indulgent to professors or\nrhetoricians.  The gratitude of the emperor Aurelius, always generous\nto his teachers, arranging their very quarrels sometimes, for they were\nnot always fair to one another, had helped him to a really great place\nin the world.  But his sumptuous appendages, including the villa and\ngardens of Maecenas, had been borne with an air perfectly becoming, by\nthe professor of a philosophy which, even in its most accomplished and\nelegant phase, presupposed a gentle contempt for such things.  With an\nintimate practical knowledge of manners, physiognomies, smiles,\ndisguises, flatteries, and courtly tricks of every kind--a whole\naccomplished rhetoric of daily life--he applied them all to the\npromotion of humanity, and especially of men's family affection.\nThrough a long life of now eighty years, he had been, as it were,\nsurrounded by the gracious and soothing air of his own eloquence--the\nfame, the echoes, of it--like warbling birds, or murmuring bees.\nSetting forth in that fine medium the best ideas of matured pagan\nphilosophy, he had become the favourite \"director\" of noble youth\n\nYes! it was the one instance Marius, always eagerly on the look-out for\nsuch, had yet seen of [223] a perfectly tolerable, perfectly beautiful,\nold age--an old age in which there seemed, to one who perhaps\nhabitually over-valued the expression of youth, nothing to be\nregretted, nothing really lost, in what years had taken away.  The wise\nold man, whose blue eyes and fair skin were so delicate, uncontaminate\nand clear, would seem to have replaced carefully and consciously each\nnatural trait of youth, as it departed from him, by an equivalent grace\nof culture; and had the blitheness, the placid cheerfulness, as he had\nalso the infirmity, the claim on stronger people, of a delightful\nchild.  And yet he seemed to be but awaiting his exit from life--that\nmoment with which the Stoics were almost as much preoccupied as the\nChristians, however differently--and set Marius pondering on the\ncontrast between a placidity like this, at eighty years, and the sort\nof desperateness he was aware of in his own manner of entertaining that\nthought.  His infirmities nevertheless had been painful and\nlong-continued, with losses of children, of pet grandchildren.  What\nwith the crowd, and the wretched streets, it was a sign of affection\nwhich had cost him something, for the old man to leave his own house at\nall that day; and he was glad of the emperor's support, as he moved\nfrom place to place among the children he protests so often to have\nloved as his own.\n\nFor a strange piece of literary good fortune, at the beginning of the\npresent century, has set [224] free the long-buried fragrance of this\nfamous friendship of the old world, from below a valueless later\nmanuscript, in a series of letters, wherein the two writers exchange,\nfor the most part their evening thoughts, especially at family\nanniversaries, and with entire intimacy, on their children, on the art\nof speech, on all the various subtleties of the \"science of\nimages\"--rhetorical images--above all, of course, on sleep and matters\nof health.  They are full of mutual admiration of each other's\neloquence, restless in absence till they see one another again, noting,\ncharacteristically, their very dreams of each other, expecting the day\nwhich will terminate the office, the business or duty, which separates\nthem--\"as superstitious people watch for the star, at the rising of\nwhich they may break their fast.\"  To one of the writers, to Aurelius,\nthe correspondence was sincerely of value. We see him once reading his\nletters with genuine delight on going to rest.  Fronto seeks to deter\nhis pupil from writing in Greek.--Why buy, at great cost, a foreign\nwine, inferior to that from one's own vineyard?  Aurelius, on the other\nhand, with an extraordinary innate susceptibility to words--la parole\npour la parole, as the French say--despairs, in presence of Fronto's\nrhetorical perfection.\n\nLike the modern visitor to the Capitoline and some other museums,\nFronto had been struck, pleasantly struck, by the family likeness [225]\namong the Antonines; and it was part of his friendship to make much of\nit, in the case of the children of Faustina.  \"Well!  I have seen the\nlittle ones,\" he writes to Aurelius, then, apparently, absent from\nthem: \"I have seen the little ones--the pleasantest sight of my life;\nfor they are as like yourself as could possibly be.  It has well repaid\nme for my journey over that slippery road, and up those steep rocks;\nfor I beheld you, not simply face to face before me, but, more\ngenerously, whichever way I turned, to my right and my left.  For the\nrest, I found them, Heaven be thanked! with healthy cheeks and lusty\nvoices.  One was holding a slice of white bread, like a king's son; the\nother a crust of brown bread, as becomes the offspring of a\nphilosopher.  I pray the gods to have both the sower and the seed in\ntheir keeping; to watch over this field wherein the ears of corn are so\nkindly alike.  Ah!  I heard too their pretty voices, so sweet that in\nthe childish prattle of one and the other I seemed somehow to be\nlistening--yes! in that chirping of your pretty chickens--to the\nlimpid+ and harmonious notes of your own oratory. Take care! you will\nfind me growing independent, having those I could love in your\nplace:--love, on the surety of my eyes and ears.\"\n\n\"Magistro meo salutem!\" replies the Emperor, \"I too have seen my little\nones in your sight of them; as, also, I saw yourself in reading your\n[226] letter.  It is that charming letter forces me to write thus:\"\nwith reiterations of affection, that is, which are continual in these\nletters, on both sides, and which may strike a modern reader perhaps as\nfulsome; or, again, as having something in common with the old Judaic\nunction of friendship.  They were certainly sincere.\n\nTo one of those children Fronto had now brought the birthday gift of\nthe silver trumpet, upon which he ventured to blow softly now and\nagain, turning away with eyes delighted at the sound, when he thought\nthe old man was not listening.  It was the well-worn, valetudinarian\nsubject of sleep, on which Fronto and Aurelius were talking together;\nAurelius always feeling it a burden, Fronto a thing of magic\ncapacities, so that he had written an encomium in its praise, and often\nby ingenious arguments recommends his imperial pupil not to be sparing\nof it.  To-day, with his younger listeners in mind, he had a story to\ntell about it:--\n\n\"They say that our father Jupiter, when he ordered the world at the\nbeginning, divided time into two parts exactly equal: the one part he\nclothed with light, the other with darkness: he called them Day and\nNight; and he assigned rest to the night and to day the work of life.\nAt that time Sleep was not yet born and men passed the whole of their\nlives awake: only, the quiet of the night was ordained for them,\ninstead of sleep.  But it came to pass, little by little, [227] being\nthat the minds of men are restless, that they carried on their business\nalike by night as by day, and gave no part at all to repose. And\nJupiter, when he perceived that even in the night-time they ceased not\nfrom trouble and disputation, and that even the courts of law remained\nopen (it was the pride of Aurelius, as Fronto knew, to be assiduous in\nthose courts till far into the night) resolved to appoint one of his\nbrothers to be the overseer of the night and have authority over man's\nrest.  But Neptune pleaded in excuse the gravity of his constant charge\nof the seas, and Father Dis the difficulty of keeping in subjection the\nspirits below; and Jupiter, having taken counsel with the other gods,\nperceived that the practice of nightly vigils was somewhat in favour.\nIt was then, for the most part, that Juno gave birth to her children:\nMinerva, the mistress of all art and craft, loved the midnight lamp:\nMars delighted in the darkness for his plots and sallies; and the\nfavour of Venus and Bacchus was with those who roused by night.  Then\nit was that Jupiter formed the design of creating Sleep; and he added\nhim to the number of the gods, and gave him the charge over night and\nrest, putting into his hands the keys of human eyes.  With his own\nhands he mingled the juices wherewith Sleep should soothe the hearts of\nmortals--herb of Enjoyment and herb of Safety, gathered from a grove in\nHeaven; and, from the meadows of [228] Acheron, the herb of Death;\nexpressing from it one single drop only, no bigger than a tear one\nmight hide.  'With this juice,' he said, 'pour slumber upon the eyelids\nof mortals.  So soon as it hath touched them they will lay themselves\ndown motionless, under thy power.  But be not afraid: they shall\nrevive, and in a while stand up again upon their feet.'  Thereafter,\nJupiter gave wings to Sleep, attached, not, like Mercury's, to his\nheels, but to his shoulders, like the wings of Love.  For he said, 'It\nbecomes thee not to approach men's eyes as with the noise of chariots,\nand the rushing of a swift courser, but in placid and merciful flight,\nas upon the wings of a swallow--nay! with not so much as the flutter of\nthe dove.'  Besides all this, that he might be yet pleasanter to men,\nhe committed to him also a multitude of blissful dreams, according to\nevery man's desire.  One watched his favourite actor; another listened\nto the flute, or guided a charioteer in the race: in his dream, the\nsoldier was victorious, the general was borne in triumph, the wanderer\nreturned home.  Yes!--and sometimes those dreams come true!\n\nJust then Aurelius was summoned to make the birthday offerings to his\nhousehold gods.  A heavy curtain of tapestry was drawn back; and beyond\nit Marius gazed for a few moments into the Lararium, or imperial\nchapel.  A patrician youth, in white habit, was in waiting, with a\nlittle chest in his hand containing incense for the [229] use of the\naltar.  On richly carved consoles, or side boards, around this narrow\nchamber, were arranged the rich apparatus of worship and the golden or\ngilded images, adorned to-day with fresh flowers, among them that image\nof Fortune from the apartment of Antoninus Pius, and such of the\nemperor's own teachers as were gone to their rest.  A dim fresco on the\nwall commemorated the ancient piety of Lucius Albinius, who in flight\nfrom Rome on the morrow of a great disaster, overtaking certain priests\non foot with their sacred utensils, descended from the wagon in which\nhe rode and yielded it to the ministers of the gods.  As he ascended\ninto the chapel the emperor paused, and with a grave but friendly look\nat his young visitor, delivered a parting sentence, audible to him\nalone: Imitation is the most acceptable-- Make sure that those to whom\nyou come nearest be the happier by your*\n\nIt was the very spirit of the scene and the hour--the hour Marius had\nspent in the imperial house.  How temperate, how tranquillising! what\nhumanity!  Yet, as he left the eminent company concerning whose ways of\nlife at home he had been so youthfully curious, and sought, after his\nmanner, to determine the main trait in all this, he had to confess that\nit was a sentiment of mediocrity, though of a mediocrity for once\nreally golden.\n\nNOTES\n\n225. +\"Limpid\" is misprinted \"Limped.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV: MANLY AMUSEMENT\n\nDURING the Eastern war there came a moment when schism in the empire\nhad seemed possible through the defection of Lucius Verus; when to\nAurelius it had also seemed possible to confirm his allegiance by no\nless a gift than his beautiful daughter Lucilla, the eldest of his\nchildren--the domnula, probably, of those letters.  The little lady,\ngrown now to strong and stately maidenhood, had been ever something of\nthe good genius, the better soul, to Lucius Verus, by the law of\ncontraries, her somewhat cold and apathetic modesty acting as\ncounterfoil to the young man's tigrish fervour.  Conducted to Ephesus,\nshe had become his wife by form of civil marriage, the more solemn\nwedding rites being deferred till their return to Rome.\n\nThe ceremony of the Confarreation, or religious marriage, in which\nbride and bridegroom partook together of a certain mystic bread, was\ncelebrated accordingly, with due pomp, early in the spring; Aurelius\nhimself [231] assisting, with much domestic feeling.  A crowd of\nfashionable people filled the space before the entrance to the\napartments of Lucius on the Palatine hill, richly decorated for the\noccasion, commenting, not always quite delicately, on the various\ndetails of the rite, which only a favoured few succeeded in actually\nwitnessing.  \"She comes!\"  Marius could hear them say, \"escorted by her\nyoung brothers: it is the young Commodus who carries the torch of\nwhite-thornwood, the little basket of work-things, the toys for the\nchildren:\"--and then, after a watchful pause, \"she is winding the\nwoollen thread round the doorposts.  Ah!  I see the marriage-cake: the\nbridegroom presents the fire and water.\"  Then, in a longer pause, was\nheard the chorus, Thalassie!  Thalassie! and for just a few moments, in\nthe strange light of many wax tapers at noonday, Marius could see them\nboth, side by side, while the bride was lifted over the doorstep:\nLucius Verus heated and handsome--the pale, impassive Lucilla looking\nvery long and slender, in her closely folded yellow veil, and high\nnuptial crown.\n\nAs Marius turned away, glad to escape from the pressure of the crowd,\nhe found himself face to face with Cornelius, an infrequent spectator\non occasions such as this.  It was a relief to depart with him--so\nfresh and quiet he looked, though in all his splendid equestrian array\nin honour of the ceremony--from the garish heat [232] of the marriage\nscene.  The reserve which had puzzled Marius so much on his first day\nin Rome, was but an instance of many, to him wholly unaccountable,\navoidances alike of things and persons, which must certainly mean that\nan intimate companionship would cost him something in the way of\nseemingly indifferent amusements.  Some inward standard Marius seemed\nto detect there (though wholly unable to estimate its nature) of\ndistinction, selection, refusal, amid the various elements of the\nfervid and corrupt life across which they were moving together:--some\nsecret, constraining motive, ever on the alert at eye and ear, which\ncarried him through Rome as under a charm, so that Marius could not but\nthink of that figure of the white bird in the market-place as\nundoubtedly made true of him.  And Marius was still full of admiration\nfor this companion, who had known how to make himself very pleasant to\nhim.  Here was the clear, cold corrective, which the fever of his\npresent life demanded.  Without it, he would have felt alternately\nsuffocated and exhausted by an existence, at once so gaudy and\noverdone, and yet so intolerably empty; in which people, even at their\nbest, seemed only to be brooding, like the wise emperor himself, over a\nworld's disillusion.  For with all the severity of Cornelius, there was\nsuch a breeze of hopefulness--freshness and hopefulness, as of new\nmorning, about him. [233] For the most part, as I said, those refusals,\nthat reserve of his, seemed unaccountable.  But there were cases where\nthe unknown monitor acted in a direction with which the judgment, or\ninstinct, of Marius himself wholly concurred; the effective decision of\nCornelius strengthening him further therein, as by a kind of outwardly\nembodied conscience.  And the entire drift of his education determined\nhim, on one point at least, to be wholly of the same mind with this\npeculiar friend (they two, it might be, together, against the world!)\nwhen, alone of a whole company of brilliant youth, he had withdrawn\nfrom his appointed place in the amphitheatre, at a grand public show,\nwhich after an interval of many months, was presented there, in honour\nof the nuptials of Lucius Verus and Lucilla.\n\nAnd it was still to the eye, through visible movement and aspect, that\nthe character, or genius of Cornelius made itself felt by Marius; even\nas on that afternoon when he had girt on his armour, among the\nexpressive lights and shades of the dim old villa at the roadside, and\nevery object of his knightly array had seemed to be but sign or symbol\nof some other thing far beyond it.  For, consistently with his really\npoetic temper, all influence reached Marius, even more exclusively than\nhe was aware, through the medium of sense. From Flavian in that brief\nearly summer of his existence, he had derived a powerful impression of\nthe [234] \"perpetual flux\": he had caught there, as in cipher or\nsymbol, or low whispers more effective than any definite language, his\nown Cyrenaic philosophy, presented thus, for the first time, in an\nimage or person, with much attractiveness, touched also, consequently,\nwith a pathetic sense of personal sorrow:--a concrete image, the\nabstract equivalent of which he could recognise afterwards, when the\nagitating personal influence had settled down for him, clearly enough,\ninto a theory of practice. But of what possible intellectual formula\ncould this mystic Cornelius be the sensible exponent; seeming, as he\ndid, to live ever in close relationship with, and recognition of, a\nmental view, a source of discernment, a light upon his way, which had\ncertainly not yet sprung up for Marius?  Meantime, the discretion of\nCornelius, his energetic clearness and purity, were a charm, rather\nphysical than moral: his exquisite correctness of spirit, at all\nevents, accorded so perfectly with the regular beauty of his person, as\nto seem to depend upon it. And wholly different as was this later\nfriendship, with its exigency, its warnings, its restraints, from the\nfeverish attachment to Flavian, which had made him at times like an\nuneasy slave, still, like that, it was a reconciliation to the world of\nsense, the visible world.  From the hopefulness of this gracious\npresence, all visible things around him, even the commonest objects of\neveryday life--if they but [235] stood together to warm their hands at\nthe same fire--took for him a new poetry, a delicate fresh bloom, and\ninterest.  It was as if his bodily eyes had been indeed mystically\nwashed, renewed, strengthened.\n\nAnd how eagerly, with what a light heart, would Flavian have taken his\nplace in the amphitheatre, among the youth of his own age! with what an\nappetite for every detail of the entertainment, and its various\naccessories:--the sunshine, filtered into soft gold by the vela, with\ntheir serpentine patterning, spread over the more select part of the\ncompany; the Vestal virgins, taking their privilege of seats near the\nempress Faustina, who sat there in a maze of double-coloured gems,\nchanging, as she moved, like the waves of the sea; the cool circle of\nshadow, in which the wonderful toilets of the fashionable told so\neffectively around the blazing arena, covered again and again during\nthe many hours' show, with clean sand for the absorption of certain\ngreat red patches there, by troops of white-shirted boys, for whom the\ngood-natured audience provided a scramble of nuts and small coin, flung\nto them over a trellis-work of silver-gilt and amber, precious gift of\nNero, while a rain of flowers and perfume fell over themselves, as they\npaused between the parts of their long feast upon the spectacle of\nanimal suffering.\n\nDuring his sojourn at Ephesus, Lucius Verus had readily become a\npatron, patron or prot\u00c3\u00a9g\u00c3\u00a9, [236] of the great goddess of Ephesus, the\ngoddess of hunters; and the show, celebrated by way of a compliment to\nhim to-day, was to present some incidents of her story, where she\nfigures almost as the genius of madness, in animals, or in the humanity\nwhich comes in contact with them.  The entertainment would have an\nelement of old Greek revival in it, welcome to the taste of a learned\nand Hellenising society; and, as Lucius Verus was in some sense a lover\nof animals, was to be a display of animals mainly. There would be real\nwild and domestic creatures, all of rare species; and a real slaughter.\nOn so happy an occasion, it was hoped, the elder emperor might even\nconcede a point, and a living criminal fall into the jaws of the wild\nbeasts.  And the spectacle was, certainly, to end in the destruction,\nby one mighty shower of arrows, of a hundred lions, \"nobly\" provided by\nAurelius himself for the amusement of his people.--Tam magnanimus fuit!\n\nThe arena, decked and in order for the first scene, looked delightfully\nfresh, re-inforcing on the spirits of the audience the actual freshness\nof the morning, which at this season still brought the dew.  Along the\nsubterranean ways that led up to it, the sound of an advancing chorus\nwas heard at last, chanting the words of a sacred song, or hymn to\nDiana; for the spectacle of the amphitheatre was, after all, a [237]\nreligious occasion.  To its grim acts of blood-shedding a kind of\nsacrificial character still belonged in the view of certain religious\ncasuists, tending conveniently to soothe the humane sensibilities of so\npious an emperor as Aurelius, who, in his fraternal complacency, had\nconsented to preside over the shows.\n\nArtemis or Diana, as she may be understood in the actual development of\nher worship, was, indeed, the symbolical expression of two allied yet\ncontrasted elements of human temper and experience--man's amity, and\nalso his enmity, towards the wild creatures, when they were still, in a\ncertain sense, his brothers.  She is the complete, and therefore highly\ncomplex, representative of a state, in which man was still much\noccupied with animals, not as his flock, or as his servants after the\npastoral relationship of our later, orderly world, but rather as his\nequals, on friendly terms or the reverse,--a state full of primeval\nsympathies and antipathies, of rivalries and common wants--while he\nwatched, and could enter into, the humours of those \"younger brothers,\"\nwith an intimacy, the \"survivals\" of which in a later age seem often to\nhave had a kind of madness about them.  Diana represents alike the\nbright and the dark side of such relationship. But the humanities of\nthat relationship were all forgotten to-day in the excitement of a\nshow, in which mere cruelty to animals, their useless suffering and\ndeath, formed [238] the main point of interest. People watched their\ndestruction, batch after batch, in a not particularly inventive\nfashion; though it was expected that the animals themselves, as living\ncreatures are apt to do when hard put to it, would become inventive,\nand make up, by the fantastic accidents of their agony, for the\ndeficiencies of an age fallen behind in this matter of manly amusement.\nIt was as a Deity of Slaughter--the Taurian goddess who demands the\nsacrifice of the shipwrecked sailors thrown on her coasts--the cruel,\nmoonstruck huntress, who brings not only sudden death, but rabies,\namong the wild creatures that Diana was to be presented, in the person\nof a famous courtesan.  The aim at an actual theatrical illusion, after\nthe first introductory scene, was frankly surrendered to the display of\nthe animals, artificially stimulated and maddened to attack each other.\nAnd as Diana was also a special protectress of new-born creatures,\nthere would be a certain curious interest in the dexterously contrived\nescape of the young from their mother's torn bosoms; as many pregnant\nanimals as possible being carefully selected for the purpose.\n\nThe time had been, and was to come again, when the pleasures of the\namphitheatre centered in a similar practical joking upon human beings.\nWhat more ingenious diversion had stage manager ever contrived than\nthat incident, itself a practical epigram never to be forgottten, [239]\nwhen a criminal, who, like slaves and animals, had no rights, was\ncompelled to present the part of Icarus; and, the wings failing him in\ndue course, had fallen into a pack of hungry bears?  For the long shows\nof the amphitheatre were, so to speak, the novel-reading of that age--a\ncurrent help provided for sluggish imaginations, in regard, for\ninstance, to grisly accidents, such as might happen to one's self; but\nwith every facility for comfortable inspection.  Scaevola might watch\nhis own hand, consuming, crackling, in the fire, in the person of a\nculprit, willing to redeem his life by an act so delightful to the\neyes, the very ears, of a curious public.  If the part of Marsyas was\ncalled for, there was a criminal condemned to lose his skin.  It might\nbe almost edifying to study minutely the expression of his face, while\nthe assistants corded and pegged him to the bench, cunningly; the\nservant of the law waiting by, who, after one short cut with his knife,\nwould slip the man's leg from his skin, as neatly as if it were a\nstocking--a finesse in providing the due amount of suffering for\nwrong-doers only brought to its height in Nero's living bonfires.  But\nthen, by making his suffering ridiculous, you enlist against the\nsufferer, some real, and all would-be manliness, and do much to stifle\nany false sentiment of compassion.  The philosophic emperor, having no\ngreat taste for sport, and asserting here a personal scruple, had\ngreatly changed all [240] that; had provided that nets should be spread\nunder the dancers on the tight-rope, and buttons for the swords of the\ngladiators.  But the gladiators were still there.  Their bloody\ncontests had, under the form of a popular amusement, the efficacy of a\nhuman sacrifice; as, indeed, the whole system of the public shows was\nunderstood to possess a religious import.  Just at this point,\ncertainly, the judgment of Lucretius on pagan religion is without\nreproach--\n\n     Tantum religio potuit suadere malorum.\n\nAnd Marius, weary and indignant, feeling isolated in the great\nslaughter-house, could not but observe that, in his habitual\ncomplaisance to Lucius Verus, who, with loud shouts of applause from\ntime to time, lounged beside him, Aurelius had sat impassibly through\nall the hours Marius himself had remained there.  For the most part\nindeed, the emperor had actually averted his eyes from the show,\nreading, or writing on matters of public business, but had seemed,\nafter all, indifferent.  He was revolving, perhaps, that old Stoic\nparadox of the Imperceptibility of pain; which might serve as an\nexcuse, should those savage popular humours ever again turn against men\nand women.  Marius remembered well his very attitude and expression on\nthis day, when, a few years later, certain things came to pass in Gaul,\nunder his full authority; and that attitude and expression [241]\ndefined already, even thus early in their so friendly intercourse, and\nthough he was still full of gratitude for his interest, a permanent\npoint of difference between the emperor and himself--between himself,\nwith all the convictions of his life taking centre to-day in his\nmerciful, angry heart, and Aurelius, as representing all the light, all\nthe apprehensive power there might be in pagan intellect.  There was\nsomething in a tolerance such as this, in the bare fact that he could\nsit patiently through a scene like this, which seemed to Marius to mark\nAurelius as his inferior now and for ever on the question of\nrighteousness; to set them on opposite sides, in some great conflict,\nof which that difference was but a single presentment.  Due, in\nwhatever proportions, to the abstract principles he had formulated for\nhimself, or in spite of them, there was the loyal conscience within\nhim, deciding, judging himself and every one else, with a wonderful\nsort of authority:--You ought, methinks, to be something quite\ndifferent from what you are; here! and here!  Surely Aurelius must be\nlacking in that decisive conscience at first sight, of the intimations\nof which Marius could entertain no doubt--which he looked for in\nothers.  He at least, the humble follower of the bodily eye, was aware\nof a crisis in life, in this brief, obscure existence, a fierce\nopposition of real good and real evil around him, the issues of which\nhe must by no [242] means compromise or confuse; of the antagonisms of\nwhich the \"wise\" Marcus Aurelius was unaware.\n\nThat long chapter of the cruelty of the Roman public shows may,\nperhaps, leave with the children of the modern world a feeling of\nself-complacency.  Yet it might seem well to ask ourselves--it is\nalways well to do so, when we read of the slave-trade, for instance, or\nof great religious persecutions on this side or on that, or of anything\nelse which raises in us the question, \"Is thy servant a dog, that he\nshould do this thing?\"--not merely, what germs of feeling we may\nentertain which, under fitting circumstances, would induce us to the\nlike; but, even more practically, what thoughts, what sort of\nconsiderations, may be actually present to our minds such as might have\nfurnished us, living in another age, and in the midst of those legal\ncrimes, with plausible excuses for them: each age in turn, perhaps,\nhaving its own peculiar point of blindness, with its consequent\npeculiar sin--the touch-stone of an unfailing conscience in the select\nfew.\n\nThose cruel amusements were, certainly, the sin of blindness, of\ndeadness and stupidity, in the age of Marius; and his light had not\nfailed him regarding it.  Yes! what was needed was the heart that would\nmake it impossible to witness all this; and the future would be with\nthe forces that could beget a heart like that. [243] His chosen\nphilosophy had said,--Trust the eye: Strive to be right always in\nregard to the concrete experience: Beware of falsifying your\nimpressions. And its sanction had at least been effective here, in\nprotesting--\"This, and this, is what you may not look upon!\"  Surely\nevil was a real thing, and the wise man wanting in the sense of it,\nwhere, not to have been, by instinctive election, on the right side,\nwas to have failed in life.\n\n\n\nEND OF VOL.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http:\/\/www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp:\/\/pglaf.org\/fundraising.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http:\/\/pglaf.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":1335,"split":"test"}
