Zuleika's current occupation (though, more importantly, perhaps, her enrapturing beauty) has made her something of a small-time celebrity and she manages to gain entrance to the privileged, all-male domain of Oxford University because her grandfather is the Warden of Judas College (based on Merton College, Beerbohm's alma mater). There, she falls in love for the first time in her life with the Duke of Dorset, a snobbish, emotionally detached student who\u2014frustrated with the lack of control over his feelings when he sees her\u2014is forced to admit that she too is his first love, impulsively proposing to her. As she feels that she cannot love anyone unless he is impervious to her charms, however, she rejects all her suitors, doing the same with the astonished Duke. The Duke quickly discovers that Noaks, another Oxford student, also claims to have fallen in love with her, without ever having even interacted with her. Apparently, men immediately fall in love with her upon seeing her. As the first to have his love reciprocated by her (for however brief a time) the Duke decides that he will commit suicide to symbolise his passion for Zuleika and in hopes that he will raise awareness in her of the terrible power of her bewitching allure, as she innocently goes on crushing men's affections.\nZuleika is able to interrupt the Duke's first suicide attempt from a river boat, but seems to have a romanticised view of men dying for her, and does not oppose the notion of his suicide altogether. The Duke, instead pledging to kill himself the next day\u2014which Zuleika more or less permits\u2014has dinner that night with his social club where the other members also affirm their love for Zuleika. Upon telling them of his plan to die, the others unexpectedly agree to also commit suicide for Zuleika. This idea soon reaches the minds of all Oxford undergraduates, who inevitably fall in love with Zuleika upon first sight.\nThe Duke eventually decides that the only way he can stop all the undergraduates from killing themselves is by not committing suicide himself, hoping they will follow his example. By an ancient tradition, on the eve of the death of a Duke of Dorset, two black owls come and perch on the battlements of Tankerton Hall, the family seat; the owls remain there hooting through the night and at dawn they fly away to an unknown place. After debating whether to follow through with his suicide, while seeming to decide at last to embrace his life as just as valuable as Zuleika's, the Duke receives a telegram from his butler at Tankerton, reporting the portentous return of the owls. The Duke promptly interprets the omen as a sign that the gods have decreed his doom. He proudly tells Zuleika that he will still die, but no longer for her; she agrees as long as he makes it appear that he is dying for her by shouting her name as he jumps into the river. Later the same day, a thunderstorm overwhelms the Eights Week boat races while the Duke drowns himself in the River Isis, wearing the robes of a Knight of the Garter. Every fellow undergraduate, except one, promptly follows suit.\nAll of the Oxford undergraduates now dead, including, with some delay, the cowardly Noaks, Zuleika discusses the ordeal with her grandfather, who reveals that he too was enamoured by all when he was her age. While Oxford's academic staff barely notice that nearly all of their undergraduates have vanished, Zuleika decides to order a special train for the next morning ... bound for Cambridge.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg EBook of Zuleika Dobson, by Max Beerbohm\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

I had always thought\n         of the lady as Zu-leek-a. Surely it was thus that\n         Joseph thought of his Wife, and Selim of his Bride?\n         And I do hope that it is thus that any reader of\n         these pages will think of Miss Dobson.\n\n                                              M.B.\n                                              Rapallo, 1922.\n\n\n\n\nILLI ALMAE MATRI\n\n\n\n\n\nZULEIKA DOBSON\n\n\n\n\nI\n\nThat old bell, presage of a train, had just sounded through Oxford\nstation; and the undergraduates who were waiting there, gay figures in\ntweed or flannel, moved to the margin of the platform and gazed idly\nup the line. Young and careless, in the glow of the afternoon sunshine,\nthey struck a sharp note of incongruity with the worn boards they stood\non, with the fading signals and grey eternal walls of that antique\nstation, which, familiar to them and insignificant, does yet whisper to\nthe tourist the last enchantments of the Middle Age.\n\nAt the door of the first-class waiting-room, aloof and venerable, stood\nthe Warden of Judas. An ebon pillar of tradition seemed he, in his garb\nof old-fashioned cleric. Aloft, between the wide brim of his silk hat\nand the white extent of his shirt-front, appeared those eyes which\nhawks, that nose which eagles, had often envied. He supported his years\non an ebon stick. He alone was worthy of the background.\n\nCame a whistle from the distance. The breast of an engine was descried,\nand a long train curving after it, under a flight of smoke. It grew\nand grew. Louder and louder, its noise foreran it. It became a furious,\nenormous monster, and, with an instinct for safety, all men receded\nfrom the platform's margin. (Yet came there with it, unknown to them,\na danger far more terrible than itself.) Into the station it came\nblustering, with cloud and clangour. Ere it had yet stopped, the door of\none carriage flew open, and from it, in a white travelling dress, in a\ntoque a-twinkle with fine diamonds, a lithe and radiant creature slipped\nnimbly down to the platform.\n\nA cynosure indeed! A hundred eyes were fixed on her, and half as many\nhearts lost to her. The Warden of Judas himself had mounted on his nose\na pair of black-rimmed glasses. Him espying, the nymph darted in his\ndirection. The throng made way for her. She was at his side.\n\n\"Grandpapa!\" she cried, and kissed the old man on either cheek. (Not a\nyouth there but would have bartered fifty years of his future for that\nsalute.)\n\n\"My dear Zuleika,\" he said, \"welcome to Oxford! Have you no luggage?\"\n\n\"Heaps!\" she answered. \"And a maid who will find it.\"\n\n\"Then,\" said the Warden, \"let us drive straight to College.\" He offered\nher his arm, and they proceeded slowly to the entrance. She chatted\ngaily, blushing not in the long avenue of eyes she passed through. All\nthe youths, under her spell, were now quite oblivious of the relatives\nthey had come to meet. Parents, sisters, cousins, ran unclaimed about\nthe platform. Undutiful, all the youths were forming a serried suite to\ntheir enchantress. In silence they followed her. They saw her leap into\nthe Warden's landau, they saw the Warden seat himself upon her left. Nor\nwas it until the landau was lost to sight that they turned--how slowly,\nand with how bad a grace!--to look for their relatives.\n\nThrough those slums which connect Oxford with the world, the landau\nrolled on towards Judas. Not many youths occurred, for nearly all--it\nwas the Monday of Eights Week--were down by the river, cheering the\ncrews. There did, however, come spurring by, on a polo-pony, a very\nsplendid youth. His straw hat was encircled with a riband of blue and\nwhite, and he raised it to the Warden.\n\n\"That,\" said the Warden, \"is the Duke of Dorset, a member of my College.\nHe dines at my table to-night.\"\n\nZuleika, turning to regard his Grace, saw that he had not reined in and\nwas not even glancing back at her over his shoulder. She gave a little\nstart of dismay, but scarcely had her lips pouted ere they curved to a\nsmile--a smile with no malice in its corners.\n\nAs the landau rolled into \"the Corn,\" another youth--a pedestrian, and\nvery different--saluted the Warden. He wore a black jacket, rusty and\namorphous. His trousers were too short, and he himself was too short:\nalmost a dwarf. His face was as plain as his gait was undistinguished.\nHe squinted behind spectacles.\n\n\"And who is that?\" asked Zuleika.\n\nA deep flush overspread the cheek of the Warden. \"That,\" he said, \"is\nalso a member of Judas. His name, I believe, is Noaks.\"\n\n\"Is he dining with us to-night?\" asked Zuleika.\n\n\"Certainly not,\" said the Warden. \"Most decidedly not.\"\n\nNoaks, unlike the Duke, had stopped for an ardent retrospect. He gazed\ntill the landau was out of his short sight; then, sighing, resumed his\nsolitary walk.\n\nThe landau was rolling into \"the Broad,\" over that ground which had once\nblackened under the fagots lit for Latimer and Ridley. It rolled past\nthe portals of Balliol and of Trinity, past the Ashmolean. From those\npedestals which intersperse the railing of the Sheldonian, the high\ngrim busts of the Roman Emperors stared down at the fair stranger in\nthe equipage. Zuleika returned their stare with but a casual glance. The\ninanimate had little charm for her.\n\nA moment later, a certain old don emerged from Blackwell's, where he had\nbeen buying books. Looking across the road, he saw, to his amazement,\ngreat beads of perspiration glistening on the brows of those Emperors.\nHe trembled, and hurried away. That evening, in Common Room, he told\nwhat he had seen; and no amount of polite scepticism would convince him\nthat it was but the hallucination of one who had been reading too much\nMommsen. He persisted that he had seen what he described. It was not\nuntil two days had elapsed that some credence was accorded him.\n\nYes, as the landau rolled by, sweat started from the brows of the\nEmperors. They, at least, foresaw the peril that was overhanging Oxford,\nand they gave such warning as they could. Let that be remembered to\ntheir credit. Let that incline us to think more gently of them. In their\nlives we know, they were infamous, some of them--\"nihil non commiserunt\nstupri, saevitiae, impietatis.\" But are they too little punished, after\nall? Here in Oxford, exposed eternally and inexorably to heat and frost,\nto the four winds that lash them and the rains that wear them away, they\nare expiating, in effigy, the abominations of their pride and cruelty\nand lust. Who were lechers, they are without bodies; who were tyrants,\nthey are crowned never but with crowns of snow; who made themselves even\nwith the gods, they are by American visitors frequently mistaken for\nthe Twelve Apostles. It is but a little way down the road that the two\nBishops perished for their faith, and even now we do never pass the spot\nwithout a tear for them. Yet how quickly they died in the flames! To\nthese Emperors, for whom none weeps, time will give no surcease. Surely,\nit is sign of some grace in them that they rejoiced not, this bright\nafternoon, in the evil that was to befall the city of their penance.\n\n\n\n\n\nII\n\nThe sun streamed through the bay-window of a \"best\" bedroom in the\nWarden's house, and glorified the pale crayon-portraits on the wall,\nthe dimity curtains, the old fresh chintz. He invaded the many trunks\nwhich--all painted Z. D.--gaped, in various stages of excavation, around\nthe room. The doors of the huge wardrobe stood, like the doors of\nJanus' temple in time of war, majestically open; and the sun seized this\nopportunity of exploring the mahogany recesses. But the carpet, which\nhad faded under his immemorial visitations, was now almost ENTIRELY\nhidden from him, hidden under layers of fair fine linen, layers of\nsilk, brocade, satin, chiffon, muslin. All the colours of the rainbow,\nmaterialised by modistes, were there. Stacked on chairs were I know not\nwhat of sachets, glove-cases, fan-cases. There were innumerable packages\nin silver-paper and pink ribands. There was a pyramid of bandboxes.\nThere was a virgin forest of boot-trees. And rustling quickly hither and\nthither, in and out of this profusion, with armfuls of finery, was an\nobviously French maid. Alert, unerring, like a swallow she dipped and\ndarted. Nothing escaped her, and she never rested. She had the air of\nthe born unpacker--swift and firm, yet withal tender. Scarce had her\narms been laden but their loads were lying lightly between shelves or\ntightly in drawers. To calculate, catch, distribute, seemed in her but a\nsingle process. She was one of those who are born to make chaos cosmic.\n\nInsomuch that ere the loud chapel-clock tolled another hour all the\ntrunks had been sent empty away. The carpet was unflecked by any scrap\nof silver-paper. From the mantelpiece, photographs of Zuleika surveyed\nthe room with a possessive air. Zuleika's pincushion, a-bristle with\nnew pins, lay on the dimity-flounced toilet-table, and round it stood\na multitude of multiform glass vessels, domed, all of them, with dull\ngold, on which Z. D., in zianites and diamonds, was encrusted. On\na small table stood a great casket of malachite, initialled in like\nfashion. On another small table stood Zuleika's library. Both books were\nin covers of dull gold. On the back of one cover BRADSHAW, in beryls,\nwas encrusted; on the back of the other, A.B.C. GUIDE, in amethysts,\nberyls, chrysoprases, and garnets. And Zuleika's great cheval-glass\nstood ready to reflect her. Always it travelled with her, in a great\ncase specially made for it. It was framed in ivory, and of fluted ivory\nwere the slim columns it swung between. Of gold were its twin sconces,\nand four tall tapers stood in each of them.\n\nThe door opened, and the Warden, with hospitable words, left his\ngrand-daughter at the threshold.\n\nZuleika wandered to her mirror. \"Undress me, Melisande,\" she said. Like\nall who are wont to appear by night before the public, she had the habit\nof resting towards sunset.\n\nPresently Melisande withdrew. Her mistress, in a white peignoir tied\nwith a blue sash, lay in a great chintz chair, gazing out of the\nbay-window. The quadrangle below was very beautiful, with its walls of\nrugged grey, its cloisters, its grass carpet. But to her it was of no\nmore interest than if it had been the rattling court-yard to one of\nthose hotels in which she spent her life. She saw it, but heeded it not.\nShe seemed to be thinking of herself, or of something she desired, or of\nsome one she had never met. There was ennui, and there was wistfulness,\nin her gaze. Yet one would have guessed these things to be transient--to\nbe no more than the little shadows that sometimes pass between a bright\nmirror and the brightness it reflects.\n\nZuleika was not strictly beautiful. Her eyes were a trifle large, and\ntheir lashes longer than they need have been. An anarchy of small curls\nwas her chevelure, a dark upland of misrule, every hair asserting its\nrights over a not discreditable brow. For the rest, her features were\nnot at all original. They seemed to have been derived rather from a\ngallimaufry of familiar models. From Madame la Marquise de Saint-Ouen\ncame the shapely tilt of the nose. The mouth was a mere replica of\nCupid's bow, lacquered scarlet and strung with the littlest pearls.\nNo apple-tree, no wall of peaches, had not been robbed, nor any Tyrian\nrose-garden, for the glory of Miss Dobson's cheeks. Her neck was\nimitation-marble. Her hands and feet were of very mean proportions. She\nhad no waist to speak of.\n\nYet, though a Greek would have railed at her asymmetry, and an\nElizabethan have called her \"gipsy,\" Miss Dobson now, in the midst of\nthe Edwardian Era, was the toast of two hemispheres. Late in her 'teens\nshe had become an orphan and a governess. Her grandfather had refused\nher appeal for a home or an allowance, on the ground that he would not\nbe burdened with the upshot of a marriage which he had once forbidden\nand not yet forgiven. Lately, however, prompted by curiosity or by\nremorse, he had asked her to spend a week or so of his declining\nyears with him. And she, \"resting\" between two engagements--one at\nHammerstein's Victoria, N.Y.C., the other at the Folies Bergeres,\nParis--and having never been in Oxford, had so far let bygones be\nbygones as to come and gratify the old man's whim.\n\nIt may be that she still resented his indifference to those early\nstruggles which, even now, she shuddered to recall. For a governess'\nlife she had been, indeed, notably unfit. Hard she had thought it, that\npenury should force her back into the school-room she was scarce out of,\nthere to champion the sums and maps and conjugations she had never\ntried to master. Hating her work, she had failed signally to pick up\nany learning from her little pupils, and had been driven from house\nto house, a sullen and most ineffectual maiden. The sequence of her\nsituations was the swifter by reason of her pretty face. Was there a\ngrown-up son, always he fell in love with her, and she would let his\neyes trifle boldly with hers across the dinner-table. When he offered\nher his hand, she would refuse it--not because she \"knew her place,\"\nbut because she did not love him. Even had she been a good teacher, her\npresence could not have been tolerated thereafter. Her corded trunk,\nheavier by another packet of billets-doux and a month's salary in\nadvance, was soon carried up the stairs of some other house.\n\nIt chanced that she came, at length, to be governess in a large family\nthat had Gibbs for its name and Notting Hill for its background. Edward,\nthe eldest son, was a clerk in the city, who spent his evenings in the\npractice of amateur conjuring. He was a freckled youth, with hair that\nbristled in places where it should have lain smooth, and he fell in love\nwith Zuleika duly, at first sight, during high-tea. In the course of the\nevening, he sought to win her admiration by a display of all his tricks.\nThese were familiar to this household, and the children had been sent\nto bed, the mother was dozing, long before the seance was at an end. But\nMiss Dobson, unaccustomed to any gaieties, sat fascinated by the young\nman's sleight of hand, marvelling that a top-hat could hold so many\ngoldfish, and a handkerchief turn so swiftly into a silver florin. All\nthat night, she lay wide awake, haunted by the miracles he had wrought.\nNext evening, when she asked him to repeat them, \"Nay,\" he whispered,\n\"I cannot bear to deceive the girl I love. Permit me to explain the\ntricks.\" So he explained them. His eyes sought hers across the bowl of\ngold-fish, his fingers trembled as he taught her to manipulate the magic\ncanister. One by one, she mastered the paltry secrets. Her respect for\nhim waned with every revelation. He complimented her on her skill. \"I\ncould not do it more neatly myself!\" he said. \"Oh, dear Miss Dobson,\nwill you but accept my hand, all these things shall be yours--the cards,\nthe canister, the goldfish, the demon egg-cup--all yours!\" Zuleika,\nwith ravishing coyness, answered that if he would give her them now, she\nwould \"think it over.\" The swain consented, and at bed-time she\nretired with the gift under her arm. In the light of her bedroom candle\nMarguerite hung not in greater ecstasy over the jewel-casket than\nhung Zuleika over the box of tricks. She clasped her hands over the\ntremendous possibilities it held for her--manumission from her bondage,\nwealth, fame, power. Stealthily, so soon as the house slumbered,\nshe packed her small outfit, embedding therein the precious gift.\nNoiselessly, she shut the lid of her trunk, corded it, shouldered it,\nstole down the stairs with it. Outside--how that chain had grated!\nand her shoulder, how it was aching!--she soon found a cab. She took\na night's sanctuary in some railway-hotel. Next day, she moved into\na small room in a lodging-house off the Edgware Road, and there for\na whole week she was sedulous in the practice of her tricks. Then she\ninscribed her name on the books of a \"Juvenile Party Entertainments\nAgency.\"\n\nThe Christmas holidays were at hand, and before long she got an\nengagement. It was a great evening for her. Her repertory was, it must\nbe confessed, old and obvious; but the children, in deference to their\nhostess, pretended not to know how the tricks were done, and assumed\ntheir prettiest airs of wonder and delight. One of them even pretended\nto be frightened, and was led howling from the room. In fact, the whole\nthing went off splendidly. The hostess was charmed, and told Zuleika\nthat a glass of lemonade would be served to her in the hall. Other\nengagements soon followed. Zuleika was very, very happy. I cannot claim\nfor her that she had a genuine passion for her art. The true conjurer\nfinds his guerdon in the consciousness of work done perfectly and for\nits own sake. Lucre and applause are not necessary to him. If he were\nset down, with the materials of his art, on a desert island, he would\nyet be quite happy. He would not cease to produce the barber's-pole from\nhis mouth. To the indifferent winds he would still speak his patter, and\neven in the last throes of starvation would not eat his live rabbit or\nhis gold-fish. Zuleika, on a desert island, would have spent most of her\ntime in looking for a man's foot-print. She was, indeed, far too human\na creature to care much for art. I do not say that she took her work\nlightly. She thought she had genius, and she liked to be told that this\nwas so. But mainly she loved her work as a means of mere self-display.\nThe frank admiration which, into whatsoever house she entered, the\ngrown-up sons flashed on her; their eagerness to see her to the door;\ntheir impressive way of putting her into her omnibus--these were the\nthings she revelled in. She was a nymph to whom men's admiration was the\ngreater part of life. By day, whenever she went into the streets,\nshe was conscious that no man passed her without a stare; and this\nconsciousness gave a sharp zest to her outings. Sometimes she was\nfollowed to her door--crude flattery which she was too innocent to fear.\nEven when she went into the haberdasher's to make some little purchase\nof tape or riband, or into the grocer's--for she was an epicure in her\nhumble way--to buy a tin of potted meat for her supper, the homage of\nthe young men behind the counter did flatter and exhilarate her. As the\nhomage of men became for her, more and more, a matter of course, the\nmore subtly necessary was it to her happiness. The more she won of it,\nthe more she treasured it. She was alone in the world, and it saved her\nfrom any moment of regret that she had neither home nor friends. For\nher the streets that lay around her had no squalor, since she paced them\nalways in the gold nimbus of her fascinations. Her bedroom seemed not\nmean nor lonely to her, since the little square of glass, nailed above\nthe wash-stand, was ever there to reflect her face. Thereinto, indeed,\nshe was ever peering. She would droop her head from side to side, she\nwould bend it forward and see herself from beneath her eyelashes, then\ntilt it back and watch herself over her supercilious chin. And she would\nsmile, frown, pout, languish--let all the emotions hover upon her face;\nand always she seemed to herself lovelier than she had ever been.\n\nYet was there nothing Narcissine in her spirit. Her love for her own\nimage was not cold aestheticism. She valued that image not for its own\nsake, but for sake of the glory it always won for her. In the little\nremote music-hall, where she was soon appearing nightly as an \"early\nturn,\" she reaped glory in a nightly harvest. She could feel that all\nthe gallery-boys, because of her, were scornful of the sweethearts\nwedged between them, and she knew that she had but to say \"Will any\ngentleman in the audience be so good as to lend me his hat?\" for the\nstalls to rise as one man and rush towards the platform. But greater\nthings were in store for her. She was engaged at two halls in the West\nEnd. Her horizon was fast receding and expanding. Homage became nightly\ntangible in bouquets, rings, brooches--things acceptable and (luckier\nthan their donors) accepted. Even Sunday was not barren for Zuleika:\nmodish hostesses gave her postprandially to their guests. Came that\nSunday night, notanda candidissimo calculo! when she received certain\nguttural compliments which made absolute her vogue and enabled her to\ncommand, thenceforth, whatever terms she asked for.\n\nAlready, indeed, she was rich. She was living at the most exorbitant\nhotel in all Mayfair. She had innumerable gowns and no necessity to buy\njewels; and she also had, which pleased her most, the fine cheval-glass\nI have described. At the close of the Season, Paris claimed her for\na month's engagement. Paris saw her and was prostrate. Boldini did a\nportrait of her. Jules Bloch wrote a song about her; and this, for a\nwhole month, was howled up and down the cobbled alleys of Montmartre.\nAnd all the little dandies were mad for \"la Zuleika.\" The jewellers\nof the Rue de la Paix soon had nothing left to put in their\nwindows--everything had been bought for \"la Zuleika.\" For a whole month,\nbaccarat was not played at the Jockey Club--every member had succumbed\nto a nobler passion. For a whole month, the whole demi-monde was\nforgotten for one English virgin. Never, even in Paris, had a woman\ntriumphed so. When the day came for her departure, the city wore such an\nair of sullen mourning as it had not worn since the Prussians marched to\nits Elysee. Zuleika, quite untouched, would not linger in the conquered\ncity. Agents had come to her from every capital in Europe, and, for a\nyear, she ranged, in triumphal nomady, from one capital to another. In\nBerlin, every night, the students escorted her home with torches. Prince\nVierfuenfsechs-Siebenachtneun offered her his hand, and was condemned\nby the Kaiser to six months' confinement in his little castle. In Yildiz\nKiosk, the tyrant who still throve there conferred on her the Order of\nChastity, and offered her the central couch in his seraglio. She\ngave her performance in the Quirinal, and, from the Vatican, the Pope\nlaunched against her a Bull which fell utterly flat. In Petersburg, the\nGrand Duke Salamander Salamandrovitch fell enamoured of her. Of every\narticle in the apparatus of her conjuring-tricks he caused a replica\nto be made in finest gold. These treasures he presented to her in that\ngreat malachite casket which now stood on the little table in her room;\nand thenceforth it was with these that she performed her wonders.\nThey did not mark the limit of the Grand Duke's generosity. He was for\nbestowing on Zuleika the half of his immensurable estates. The Grand\nDuchess appealed to the Tzar. Zuleika was conducted across the frontier,\nby an escort of love-sick Cossacks. On the Sunday before she left\nMadrid, a great bull-fight was held in her honour. Fifteen bulls\nreceived the coup-de-grace, and Alvarez, the matador of matadors, died\nin the arena with her name on his lips. He had tried to kill the\nlast bull without taking his eyes off la divina senorita. A prettier\ncompliment had never been paid her, and she was immensely pleased with\nit. For that matter, she was immensely pleased with everything. She\nmoved proudly to the incessant music of a paean, aye! of a paean that\nwas always crescendo.\n\nIts echoes followed her when she crossed the Atlantic, till they were\nlost in the louder, deeper, more blatant paean that rose for her from\nthe shores beyond. All the stops of that \"mighty organ, many-piped,\" the\nNew York press, were pulled out simultaneously, as far as they could be\npulled, in Zuleika's honour. She delighted in the din. She read every\nline that was printed about her, tasting her triumph as she had never\ntasted it before. And how she revelled in the Brobdingnagian drawings of\nher, which, printed in nineteen colours, towered between the columns or\nsprawled across them! There she was, measuring herself back to back with\nthe Statue of Liberty; scudding through the firmament on a comet,\nwhilst a crowd of tiny men in evening-dress stared up at her from the\nterrestrial globe; peering through a microscope held by Cupid over a\ndiminutive Uncle Sam; teaching the American Eagle to stand on its head;\nand doing a hundred-and-one other things--whatever suggested itself\nto the fancy of native art. And through all this iridescent maze of\nsymbolism were scattered many little slabs of realism. At home, on the\nstreet, Zuleika was the smiling target of all snap-shooters, and all the\nsnap-shots were snapped up by the press and reproduced with annotations:\nZuleika Dobson walking on Broadway in the sables gifted her by Grand\nDuke Salamander--she says \"You can bounce blizzards in them\"; Zuleika\nDobson yawning over a love-letter from millionaire Edelweiss; relishing\na cup of clam-broth--she says \"They don't use clams out there\"; ordering\nher maid to fix her a warm bath; finding a split in the gloves she has\njust drawn on before starting for the musicale given in her honour by\nMrs. Suetonius X. Meistersinger, the most exclusive woman in New York;\nchatting at the telephone to Miss Camille Van Spook, the best-born girl\nin New York; laughing over the recollection of a compliment made her by\nGeorge Abimelech Post, the best-groomed man in New York; meditating a\nnew trick; admonishing a waiter who has upset a cocktail over her skirt;\nhaving herself manicured; drinking tea in bed. Thus was Zuleika enabled\ndaily to be, as one might say, a spectator of her own wonderful life.\nOn her departure from New York, the papers spoke no more than the\ntruth when they said she had had \"a lovely time.\" The further she went\nWest--millionaire Edelweiss had loaned her his private car--the lovelier\nher time was. Chicago drowned the echoes of New York; final Frisco\ndwarfed the headlines of Chicago. Like one of its own prairie-fires, she\nswept the country from end to end. Then she swept back, and sailed for\nEngland. She was to return for a second season in the coming Fall. At\npresent, she was, as I have said, \"resting.\"\n\nAs she sat here in the bay-window of her room, she was not reviewing\nthe splendid pageant of her past. She was a young person whose reveries\nnever were in retrospect. For her the past was no treasury of distinct\nmemories, all hoarded and classified, some brighter than others and more\nhighly valued. All memories were for her but as the motes in one fused\nradiance that followed her and made more luminous the pathway of\nher future. She was always looking forward. She was looking forward\nnow--that shade of ennui had passed from her face--to the week she was\nto spend in Oxford. A new city was a new toy to her, and--for it was\nyouth's homage that she loved best--this city of youths was a toy after\nher own heart.\n\nAye, and it was youths who gave homage to her most freely. She was\nof that high-stepping and flamboyant type that captivates youth most\nsurely. Old men and men of middle age admired her, but she had not that\nflower-like quality of shyness and helplessness, that look of innocence,\nso dear to men who carry life's secrets in their heads. Yet Zuleika\nWAS very innocent, really. She was as pure as that young shepherdess\nMarcella, who, all unguarded, roved the mountains and was by all the\nshepherds adored. Like Marcella, she had given her heart to no man, had\npreferred none. Youths were reputed to have died for love of her,\nas Chrysostom died for love of the shepherdess; and she, like the\nshepherdess, had shed no tear. When Chrysostom was lying on his bier in\nthe valley, and Marcella looked down from the high rock, Ambrosio,\nthe dead man's comrade, cried out on her, upbraiding her with bitter\nwords--\"Oh basilisk of our mountains!\" Nor do I think Ambrosio spoke too\nstrongly. Marcella cared nothing for men's admiration, and yet, instead\nof retiring to one of those nunneries which are founded for her kind,\nshe chose to rove the mountains, causing despair to all the shepherds.\nZuleika, with her peculiar temperament, would have gone mad in a\nnunnery. \"But,\" you may argue, \"ought not she to have taken the veil,\neven at the cost of her reason, rather than cause so much despair in the\nworld? If Marcella was a basilisk, as you seem to think, how about Miss\nDobson?\" Ah, but Marcella knew quite well, boasted even, that she never\nwould or could love any man. Zuleika, on the other hand, was a woman of\nreally passionate fibre. She may not have had that conscious, separate,\nand quite explicit desire to be a mother with which modern playwrights\ncredit every unmated member of her sex. But she did know that she could\nlove. And, surely, no woman who knows that of herself can be rightly\ncensured for not recluding herself from the world: it is only women\nwithout the power to love who have no right to provoke men's love.\n\nThough Zuleika had never given her heart, strong in her were the desire\nand the need that it should be given. Whithersoever she had fared, she\nhad seen nothing but youths fatuously prostrate to her--not one upright\nfigure which she could respect. There were the middle-aged men, the old\nmen, who did not bow down to her; but from middle-age, as from eld, she\nhad a sanguine aversion. She could love none but a youth. Nor--though\nshe herself, womanly, would utterly abase herself before her\nideal--could she love one who fell prone before her. And before her all\nyouths always did fall prone. She was an empress, and all youths were\nher slaves. Their bondage delighted her, as I have said. But no empress\nwho has any pride can adore one of her slaves. Whom, then, could proud\nZuleika adore? It was a question which sometimes troubled her. There\nwere even moments when, looking into her cheval-glass, she cried out\nagainst that arrangement in comely lines and tints which got for her\nthe dulia she delighted in. To be able to love once--would not that be\nbetter than all the homage in the world? But would she ever meet whom,\nlooking up to him, she could love--she, the omnisubjugant? Would she\never, ever meet him?\n\nIt was when she wondered thus, that the wistfulness came into her eyes.\nEven now, as she sat by the window, that shadow returned to them. She\nwas wondering, shyly, had she met him at length? That young equestrian\nwho had not turned to look at her; whom she was to meet at dinner\nto-night... was it he? The ends of her blue sash lay across her lap,\nand she was lazily unravelling their fringes. \"Blue and white!\" she\nremembered. \"They were the colours he wore round his hat.\" And she gave\na little laugh of coquetry. She laughed, and, long after, her lips were\nstill parted in a smile.\n\nSo did she sit, smiling, wondering, with the fringes of her sash\nbetween her fingers, while the sun sank behind the opposite wall of the\nquadrangle, and the shadows crept out across the grass, thirsty for the\ndew.\n\n\n\n\nIII\n\nThe clock in the Warden's drawing-room had just struck eight, and\nalready the ducal feet were beautiful on the white bearskin hearthrug.\nSo slim and long were they, of instep so nobly arched, that only with\na pair of glazed ox-tongues on a breakfast-table were they comparable.\nIncomparable quite, the figure and face and vesture of him who ended in\nthem.\n\nThe Warden was talking to him, with all the deference of elderly\ncommoner to patrician boy. The other guests--an Oriel don and his\nwife--were listening with earnest smile and submissive droop, at a\nslight distance. Now and again, to put themselves at their ease, they\nexchanged in undertone a word or two about the weather.\n\n\"The young lady whom you may have noticed with me,\" the Warden was\nsaying, \"is my orphaned grand-daughter.\" (The wife of the Oriel don\ndiscarded her smile, and sighed, with a glance at the Duke, who was\nhimself an orphan.) \"She has come to stay with me.\" (The Duke glanced\nquickly round the room.) \"I cannot think why she is not down yet.\" (The\nOriel don fixed his eyes on the clock, as though he suspected it of\nbeing fast.) \"I must ask you to forgive her. She appears to be a bright,\npleasant young woman.\"\n\n\"Married?\" asked the Duke.\n\n\"No,\" said the Warden; and a cloud of annoyance crossed the boy's face.\n\"No; she devotes her life entirely to good works.\"\n\n\"A hospital nurse?\" the Duke murmured.\n\n\"No, Zuleika's appointed task is to induce delightful wonder rather than\nto alleviate pain. She performs conjuring-tricks.\"\n\n\"Not--not Miss Zuleika Dobson?\" cried the Duke.\n\n\"Ah yes. I forgot that she had achieved some fame in the outer world.\nPerhaps she has already met you?\"\n\n\"Never,\" said the young man coldly. \"But of course I have heard of Miss\nDobson. I did not know she was related to you.\"\n\nThe Duke had an intense horror of unmarried girls. All his vacations\nwere spent in eluding them and their chaperons. That he should be\nconfronted with one of them--with such an one of them!--in Oxford,\nseemed to him sheer violation of sanctuary. The tone, therefore, in\nwhich he said \"I shall be charmed,\" in answer to the Warden's request\nthat he would take Zuleika into dinner, was very glacial. So was his\ngaze when, a moment later, the young lady made her entry.\n\n\"She did not look like an orphan,\" said the wife of the Oriel don,\nsubsequently, on the way home. The criticism was a just one. Zuleika\nwould have looked singular in one of those lowly double-files of\nstraw-bonnets and drab cloaks which are so steadying a feature of\nour social system. Tall and lissom, she was sheathed from the bosom\ndownwards in flamingo silk, and she was liberally festooned with\nemeralds. Her dark hair was not even strained back from her forehead and\nbehind her ears, as an orphan's should be. Parted somewhere at the side,\nit fell in an avalanche of curls upon one eyebrow. From her right\near drooped heavily a black pearl, from her left a pink; and their\ndifference gave an odd, bewildering witchery to the little face between.\n\nWas the young Duke bewitched? Instantly, utterly. But none could\nhave guessed as much from his cold stare, his easy and impassive bow.\nThroughout dinner, none guessed that his shirt-front was but the screen\nof a fierce warfare waged between pride and passion. Zuleika, at the\nfoot of the table, fondly supposed him indifferent to her. Though he\nsat on her right, not one word or glance would he give her. All his\nconversation was addressed to the unassuming lady who sat on his other\nside, next to the Warden. Her he edified and flustered beyond measure\nby his insistent courtesy. Her husband, alone on the other side of\nthe table, was mortified by his utter failure to engage Zuleika in\nsmall-talk. Zuleika was sitting with her profile turned to him--the\nprofile with the pink pearl--and was gazing full at the young Duke. She\nwas hardly more affable than a cameo. \"Yes,\" \"No,\" \"I don't know,\"\nwere the only answers she would vouchsafe to his questions. A vague \"Oh\nreally?\" was all he got for his timid little offerings of information.\nIn vain he started the topic of modern conjuring-tricks as compared with\nthe conjuring-tricks performed by the ancient Egyptians. Zuleika did not\neven say \"Oh really?\" when he told her about the metamorphosis of the\nbulls in the Temple of Osiris. He primed himself with a glass of sherry,\ncleared his throat. \"And what,\" he asked, with a note of firmness, \"did\nyou think of our cousins across the water?\" Zuleika said \"Yes;\" and\nthen he gave in. Nor was she conscious that he ceased talking to her. At\nintervals throughout the rest of dinner, she murmured \"Yes,\" and \"No,\"\nand \"Oh really?\" though the poor little don was now listening silently\nto the Duke and the Warden.\n\nShe was in a trance of sheer happiness. At last, she thought, her hope\nwas fulfilled--that hope which, although she had seldom remembered it in\nthe joy of her constant triumphs, had been always lurking in her, lying\nnear to her heart and chafing her, like the shift of sackcloth which\nthat young brilliant girl, loved and lost of Giacopone di Todi, wore\nalways in secret submission to her own soul, under the fair soft robes\nand the rubies men saw on her. At last, here was the youth who would not\nbow down to her; whom, looking up to him, she could adore. She ate and\ndrank automatically, never taking her gaze from him. She felt not one\ntouch of pique at his behaviour. She was tremulous with a joy that was\nnew to her, greater than any joy she had known. Her soul was as a flower\nin its opetide. She was in love. Rapt, she studied every lineament of\nthe pale and perfect face--the brow from which bronze-coloured hair rose\nin tiers of burnished ripples; the large steel-coloured eyes, with their\ncarven lids; the carven nose, and the plastic lips. She noted how long\nand slim were his fingers, and how slender his wrists. She noted the\nglint cast by the candles upon his shirt-front. The two large white\npearls there seemed to her symbols of his nature. They were like two\nmoons: cold, remote, radiant. Even when she gazed at the Duke's face,\nshe was aware of them in her vision.\n\nNor was the Duke unconscious, as he seemed to be, of her scrutiny.\nThough he kept his head averse, he knew that always her eyes were\nwatching him. Obliquely, he saw them; saw, too, the contour of the face,\nand the black pearl and the pink; could not blind himself, try as he\nwould. And he knew that he was in love.\n\nLike Zuleika herself, this young Duke was in love for the first time.\nWooed though he had been by almost as many maidens as she by youths, his\nheart, like hers, had remained cold. But he had never felt, as she\nhad, the desire to love. He was not now rejoicing, as she was, in the\nsensation of first love; nay, he was furiously mortified by it, and\nstruggled with all his might against it. He had always fancied himself\nsecure against any so vulgar peril; always fancied that by him at least,\nthe proud old motto of his family--\"Pas si bete\"--would not be belied.\nAnd I daresay, indeed, that had he never met Zuleika, the irresistible,\nhe would have lived, and at a very ripe old age died, a dandy without\nreproach. For in him the dandiacal temper had been absolute hitherto,\nquite untainted and unruffled. He was too much concerned with his\nown perfection ever to think of admiring any one else. Different from\nZuleika, he cared for his wardrobe and his toilet-table not as a means\nto making others admire him the more, but merely as a means through\nwhich he could intensify, a ritual in which to express and realise, his\nown idolatry. At Eton he had been called \"Peacock,\" and this nick-name\nhad followed him up to Oxford. It was not wholly apposite, however. For,\nwhereas the peacock is a fool even among birds, the Duke had already\ntaken (besides a particularly brilliant First in Mods) the Stanhope,\nthe Newdigate, the Lothian, and the Gaisford Prize for Greek Verse. And\nthese things he had achieved currente calamo, \"wielding his pen,\" as\nScott said of Byron, \"with the easy negligence of a nobleman.\" He was\nnow in his third year of residence, and was reading, a little, for\nLiterae Humaniores. There is no doubt that but for his untimely death he\nwould have taken a particularly brilliant First in that school also.\n\nFor the rest, he had many accomplishments. He was adroit in the killing\nof all birds and fishes, stags and foxes. He played polo, cricket,\nracquets, chess, and billiards as well as such things can be played.\nHe was fluent in all modern languages, had a very real talent in\nwater-colour, and was accounted, by those who had had the privilege of\nhearing him, the best amateur pianist on this side of the Tweed. Little\nwonder, then, that he was idolised by the undergraduates of his day.\nHe did not, however, honour many of them with his friendship. He had a\ntheoretic liking for them as a class, as the \"young barbarians all at\nplay\" in that little antique city; but individually they jarred on him,\nand he saw little of them. Yet he sympathised with them always, and, on\noccasion, would actively take their part against the dons. In the middle\nof his second year, he had gone so far that a College Meeting had to be\nheld, and he was sent down for the rest of term. The Warden placed his\nown landau at the disposal of the illustrious young exile, who therein\nwas driven to the station, followed by a long, vociferous procession\nof undergraduates in cabs. Now, it happened that this was a time of\npolitical excitement in London. The Liberals, who were in power,\nhad passed through the House of Commons a measure more than usually\nsocialistic; and this measure was down for its second reading in the\nLords on the very day that the Duke left Oxford, an exile. It was but a\nfew weeks since he had taken his seat in the Lords; and this afternoon,\nfor the want of anything better to do, he strayed in. The Leader of the\nHouse was already droning his speech for the bill, and the Duke found\nhimself on one of the opposite benches. There sat his compeers, sullenly\nwaiting to vote for a bill which every one of them detested. As the\nspeaker subsided, the Duke, for the fun of the thing, rose. He made\na long speech against the bill. His gibes at the Government were so\nscathing, so utterly destructive his criticism of the bill itself, so\nlofty and so irresistible the flights of his eloquence, that, when he\nresumed his seat, there was only one course left to the Leader of the\nHouse. He rose and, in a few husky phrases, moved that the bill \"be read\nthis day six months.\" All England rang with the name of the young Duke.\nHe himself seemed to be the one person unmoved by his exploit. He did\nnot re-appear in the Upper Chamber, and was heard to speak in slighting\nterms of its architecture, as well as of its upholstery. Nevertheless,\nthe Prime Minister became so nervous that he procured for him, a month\nlater, the Sovereign's offer of a Garter which had just fallen vacant.\nThe Duke accepted it. He was, I understand, the only undergraduate on\nwhom this Order had ever been conferred. He was very much pleased with\nthe insignia, and when, on great occasions, he wore them, no one dared\nsay that the Prime Minister's choice was not fully justified. But you\nmust not imagine that he cared for them as symbols of achievement and\npower. The dark blue riband, and the star scintillating to eight\npoints, the heavy mantle of blue velvet, with its lining of taffeta\nand shoulder-knots of white satin, the crimson surcoat, the great\nembullioned tassels, and the chain of linked gold, and the plumes of\nostrich and heron uprising from the black velvet hat--these things had\nfor him little significance save as a fine setting, a finer setting than\nthe most elaborate smoking-suit, for that perfection of aspect which\nthe gods had given him. This was indeed the gift he valued beyond\nall others. He knew well, however, that women care little for a man's\nappearance, and that what they seek in a man is strength of character,\nand rank, and wealth. These three gifts the Duke had in a high degree,\nand he was by women much courted because of them. Conscious that every\nmaiden he met was eager to be his Duchess, he had assumed always a\nmanner of high austerity among maidens, and even if he had wished to\nflirt with Zuleika he would hardly have known how to do it. But he did\nnot wish to flirt with her. That she had bewitched him did but make\nit the more needful that he should shun all converse with her. It was\nimperative that he should banish her from his mind, quickly. He must not\ndilute his own soul's essence. He must not surrender to any passion his\ndandihood. The dandy must be celibate, cloistral; is, indeed, but a monk\nwith a mirror for beads and breviary--an anchorite, mortifying his soul\nthat his body may be perfect. Till he met Zuleika, the Duke had not\nknown the meaning of temptation. He fought now, a St. Anthony, against\nthe apparition. He would not look at her, and he hated her. He loved\nher, and he could not help seeing her. The black pearl and the pink\nseemed to dangle ever nearer and clearer to him, mocking him and\nbeguiling. Inexpellible was her image.\n\nSo fierce was the conflict in him that his outward nonchalance gradually\ngave way. As dinner drew to its close, his conversation with the wife\nof the Oriel don flagged and halted. He sank, at length, into a deep\nsilence. He sat with downcast eyes, utterly distracted.\n\nSuddenly, something fell, plump! into the dark whirlpool of his\nthoughts. He started. The Warden was leaning forward, had just said\nsomething to him.\n\n\"I beg your pardon?\" asked the Duke. Dessert, he noticed, was on the\ntable, and he was paring an apple. The Oriel don was looking at him with\nsympathy, as at one who had swooned and was just \"coming to.\"\n\n\"Is it true, my dear Duke,\" the Warden repeated, \"that you have been\npersuaded to play to-morrow evening at the Judas concert?\"\n\n\"Ah yes, I am going to play something.\"\n\nZuleika bent suddenly forward, addressed him. \"Oh,\" she cried, clasping\nher hands beneath her chin, \"will you let me come and turn over the\nleaves for you?\"\n\nHe looked her full in the face. It was like seeing suddenly at close\nquarters some great bright monument that one has long known only as a\nsun-caught speck in the distance. He saw the large violet eyes open to\nhim, and their lashes curling to him; the vivid parted lips; and the\nblack pearl, and the pink.\n\n\"You are very kind,\" he murmured, in a voice which sounded to him quite\nfar away. \"But I always play without notes.\"\n\nZuleika blushed. Not with shame, but with delirious pleasure. For that\nsnub she would just then have bartered all the homage she had hoarded.\nThis, she felt, was the climax. She would not outstay it. She rose,\nsmiling to the wife of the Oriel don. Every one rose. The Oriel don held\nopen the door, and the two ladies passed out of the room.\n\nThe Duke drew out his cigarette case. As he looked down at the\ncigarettes, he was vaguely conscious of some strange phenomenon\nsomewhere between them and his eyes. Foredone by the agitation of the\npast hour, he did not at once realise what it was that he saw. His\nimpression was of something in bad taste, some discord in his costume\n... a black pearl and a pink pearl in his shirt-front!\n\nJust for a moment, absurdly over-estimating poor Zuleika's skill, he\nsupposed himself a victim of legerdemain. Another moment, and the import\nof the studs revealed itself. He staggered up from his chair, covering\nhis breast with one arm, and murmured that he was faint. As he hurried\nfrom the room, the Oriel don was pouring out a tumbler of water and\nsuggesting burnt feathers. The Warden, solicitous, followed him into\nthe hall. He snatched up his hat, gasping that he had spent a delightful\nevening--was very sorry--was subject to these attacks. Once outside, he\ntook frankly to his heels.\n\nAt the corner of the Broad, he looked back over his shoulder. He had\nhalf expected a scarlet figure skimming in pursuit. There was nothing.\nHe halted. Before him, the Broad lay empty beneath the moon. He went\nslowly, mechanically, to his rooms.\n\nThe high grim busts of the Emperors stared down at him, their faces more\nthan ever tragically cavernous and distorted. They saw and read in\nthat moonlight the symbols on his breast. As he stood on his doorstep,\nwaiting for the door to be opened, he must have seemed to them a thing\nfor infinite compassion. For were they not privy to the doom that the\nmorrow, or the morrow's morrow, held for him--held not indeed for him\nalone, yet for him especially, as it were, and for him most lamentably?\n\n\n\n\nIV\n\nThe breakfast-things were not yet cleared away. A plate streaked with\nfine strains of marmalade, an empty toast-rack, a broken roll--these and\nother things bore witness to a day inaugurated in the right spirit.\n\nAway from them, reclining along his window-seat, was the Duke. Blue\nspirals rose from his cigarette, nothing in the still air to trouble\nthem. From their railing, across the road, the Emperors gazed at him.\n\nFor a young man, sleep is a sure solvent of distress. There whirls not\nfor him in the night any so hideous a phantasmagoria as will not become,\nin the clarity of next morning, a spruce procession for him to lead.\nBrief the vague horror of his awakening; memory sweeps back to him,\nand he sees nothing dreadful after all. \"Why not?\" is the sun's bright\nmessage to him, and \"Why not indeed?\" his answer. After hours of\nagony and doubt prolonged to cock-crow, sleep had stolen to the Duke's\nbed-side. He awoke late, with a heavy sense of disaster; but lo! when he\nremembered, everything took on a new aspect. He was in love. \"Why not?\"\nHe mocked himself for the morbid vigil he had spent in probing and\nvainly binding the wounds of his false pride. The old life was done\nwith. He laughed as he stepped into his bath. Why should the disseizin\nof his soul have seemed shameful to him? He had had no soul till it\npassed out of his keeping. His body thrilled to the cold water, his soul\nas to a new sacrament. He was in love, and that was all he wished for...\nThere, on the dressing-table, lay the two studs, visible symbols of his\nlove. Dear to him, now, the colours of them! He took them in his hand,\none by one, fondling them. He wished he could wear them in the day-time;\nbut this, of course, was impossible. His toilet finished, he dropped\nthem into the left pocket of his waistcoat.\n\nTherein, near to his heart, they were lying now, as he looked out at\nthe changed world--the world that had become Zuleika. \"Zuleika!\" his\nrecurrent murmur, was really an apostrophe to the whole world.\n\nPiled against the wall were certain boxes of black japanned tin, which\nhad just been sent to him from London. At any other time he would\ncertainly not have left them unopened. For they contained his robes of\nthe Garter. Thursday, the day after to-morrow, was the date fixed for\nthe investiture of a foreign king who was now visiting England: and the\nfull chapter of Knights had been commanded to Windsor for the ceremony.\nYesterday the Duke had looked keenly forward to his excursion. It was\nonly in those too rarely required robes that he had the sense of being\nfully dressed. But to-day not a thought had he of them.\n\nSome clock clove with silver the stillness of the morning. Ere came the\nsecond stroke, another and nearer clock was striking. And now there were\nothers chiming in. The air was confused with the sweet babel of its many\nspires, some of them booming deep, measured sequences, some tinkling\nimpatiently and outwitting others which had begun before them. And when\nthis anthem of jealous antiphonies and uneven rhythms had dwindled quite\naway and fainted in one last solitary note of silver, there started\nsomewhere another sequence; and this, almost at its last stroke, was\ninterrupted by yet another, which went on to tell the hour of noon in\nits own way, quite slowly and significantly, as though none knew it.\n\nAnd now Oxford was astir with footsteps and laughter--the laughter and\nquick footsteps of youths released from lecture-rooms. The Duke shifted\nfrom the window. Somehow, he did not care to be observed, though it was\nusually at this hour that he showed himself for the setting of some\nnew fashion in costume. Many an undergraduate, looking up, missed the\npicture in the window-frame.\n\nThe Duke paced to and fro, smiling ecstatically. He took the two studs\nfrom his pocket and gazed at them. He looked in the glass, as one\nseeking the sympathy of a familiar. For the first time in his life,\nhe turned impatiently aside. It was a new kind of sympathy he needed\nto-day.\n\nThe front door slammed, and the staircase creaked to the ascent of two\nheavy boots. The Duke listened, waited irresolute. The boots passed his\ndoor, were already clumping up the next flight. \"Noaks!\" he cried. The\nboots paused, then clumped down again. The door opened and disclosed\nthat homely figure which Zuleika had seen on her way to Judas.\n\nSensitive reader, start not at the apparition! Oxford is a plexus of\nanomalies. These two youths were (odd as it may seem to you) subject to\nthe same Statutes, affiliated to the same College, reading for the same\nSchool; aye! and though the one had inherited half a score of noble and\ncastellated roofs, whose mere repairs cost him annually thousands and\nthousands of pounds, and the other's people had but one little mean\nsquare of lead, from which the fireworks of the Crystal Palace were\nclearly visible every Thursday evening, in Oxford one roof sheltered\nboth of them. Furthermore, there was even some measure of intimacy\nbetween them. It was the Duke's whim to condescend further in the\ndirection of Noaks than in any other. He saw in Noaks his own foil and\nantithesis, and made a point of walking up the High with him at least\nonce in every term. Noaks, for his part, regarded the Duke with feelings\nmingled of idolatry and disapproval. The Duke's First in Mods oppressed\nhim (who, by dint of dogged industry, had scraped a Second) more than\nall the other differences between them. But the dullard's envy of\nbrilliant men is always assuaged by the suspicion that they will come to\na bad end. Noaks may have regarded the Duke as a rather pathetic figure,\non the whole.\n\n\"Come in, Noaks,\" said the Duke. \"You have been to a lecture?\"\n\n\"Aristotle's Politics,\" nodded Noaks.\n\n\"And what were they?\" asked the Duke. He was eager for sympathy in his\nlove. But so little used was he to seeking sympathy that he could not\nunburden himself. He temporised. Noaks muttered something about getting\nback to work, and fumbled with the door-handle.\n\n\"Oh, my dear fellow, don't go,\" said the Duke. \"Sit down. Our Schools\ndon't come on for another year. A few minutes can't make a difference in\nyour Class. I want to--to tell you something, Noaks. Do sit down.\"\n\nNoaks sat down on the edge of a chair. The Duke leaned against the\nmantel-piece, facing him. \"I suppose, Noaks,\" he said, \"you have never\nbeen in love.\"\n\n\"Why shouldn't I have been in love?\" asked the little man, angrily.\n\n\"I can't imagine you in love,\" said the Duke, smiling.\n\n\"And I can't imagine YOU. You're too pleased with yourself,\" growled\nNoaks.\n\n\"Spur your imagination, Noaks,\" said his friend. \"I AM in love.\"\n\n\"So am I,\" was an unexpected answer, and the Duke (whose need of\nsympathy was too new to have taught him sympathy with others) laughed\naloud. \"Whom do you love?\" he asked, throwing himself into an arm-chair.\n\n\"I don't know who she is,\" was another unexpected answer.\n\n\"When did you meet her?\" asked the Duke. \"Where? What did you say to\nher?\"\n\n\"Yesterday. In the Corn. I didn't SAY anything to her.\"\n\n\"Is she beautiful?\"\n\n\"Yes. What's that to you?\"\n\n\"Dark or fair?\"\n\n\"She's dark. She looks like a foreigner. She looks like--like one of\nthose photographs in the shop-windows.\"\n\n\"A rhapsody, Noaks! What became of her? Was she alone?\"\n\n\"She was with the old Warden, in his carriage.\"\n\nZuleika--Noaks! The Duke started, as at an affront, and glared. Next\nmoment, he saw the absurdity of the situation. He relapsed into his\nchair, smiling. \"She's the Warden's niece,\" he said. \"I dined at the\nWarden's last night.\"\n\nNoaks sat still, peering across at the Duke. For the first time in his\nlife, he was resentful of the Duke's great elegance and average stature,\nhis high lineage and incomputable wealth. Hitherto, these things\nhad been too remote for envy. But now, suddenly, they seemed near to\nhim--nearer and more overpowering than the First in Mods had ever been.\n\"And of course she's in love with you?\" he snarled.\n\nReally, this was for the Duke a new issue. So salient was his own\npassion that he had not had time to wonder whether it were returned.\nZuleika's behaviour during dinner... But that was how so many young\nwomen had behaved. It was no sign of disinterested love. It might mean\nmerely... Yet no! Surely, looking into her eyes, he had seen there a\nradiance finer than could have been lit by common ambition. Love, none\nother, must have lit in those purple depths the torches whose clear\nflames had leapt out to him. She loved him. She, the beautiful, the\nwonderful, had not tried to conceal her love for him. She had shown him\nall--had shown all, poor darling! only to be snubbed by a prig, driven\naway by a boor, fled from by a fool. To the nethermost corner of his\nsoul, he cursed himself for what he had done, and for all he had left\nundone. He would go to her on his knees. He would implore her to impose\non him insufferable penances. There was no penance, how bittersweet\nsoever, could make him a little worthy of her.\n\n\"Come in!\" he cried mechanically. Entered the landlady's daughter.\n\n\"A lady downstairs,\" she said, \"asking to see your Grace. Says she'll\nstep round again later if your Grace is busy.\"\n\n\"What is her name?\" asked the Duke, vacantly. He was gazing at the girl\nwith pain-shot eyes.\n\n\"Miss Zuleika Dobson,\" pronounced the girl.\n\nHe rose.\n\n\"Show Miss Dobson up,\" he said.\n\nNoaks had darted to the looking-glass and was smoothing his hair with a\ntremulous, enormous hand.\n\n\"Go!\" said the Duke, pointing to the door. Noaks went, quickly. Echoes\nof his boots fell from the upper stairs and met the ascending susurrus\nof a silk skirt.\n\nThe lovers met. There was an interchange of ordinary greetings: from the\nDuke, a comment on the weather; from Zuleika, a hope that he was well\nagain--they had been so sorry to lose him last night. Then came a pause.\nThe landlady's daughter was clearing away the breakfast-things.\nZuleika glanced comprehensively at the room, and the Duke gazed at the\nhearthrug. The landlady's daughter clattered out with her freight. They\nwere alone.\n\n\"How pretty!\" said Zuleika. She was looking at his star of the Garter,\nwhich sparkled from a litter of books and papers on a small side-table.\n\n\"Yes,\" he answered. \"It is pretty, isn't it?\"\n\n\"Awfully pretty!\" she rejoined.\n\nThis dialogue led them to another hollow pause. The Duke's heart beat\nviolently within him. Why had he not asked her to take the star and keep\nit as a gift? Too late now! Why could he not throw himself at her feet?\nHere were two beings, lovers of each other, with none by. And yet...\n\nShe was examining a water-colour on the wall, seemed to be absorbed by\nit. He watched her. She was even lovelier than he had remembered;\nor rather her loveliness had been, in some subtle way, transmuted.\nSomething had given to her a graver, nobler beauty. Last night's nymph\nhad become the Madonna of this morning. Despite her dress, which was\nof a tremendous tartan, she diffused the pale authentic radiance of a\nspirituality most high, most simple. The Duke wondered where lay the\nchange in her. He could not understand. Suddenly she turned to him, and\nhe understood. No longer the black pearl and the pink, but two white\npearls!... He thrilled to his heart's core.\n\n\"I hope,\" said Zuleika, \"you aren't awfully vexed with me for coming\nlike this?\"\n\n\"Not at all,\" said the Duke. \"I am delighted to see you.\" How inadequate\nthe words sounded, how formal and stupid!\n\n\"The fact is,\" she continued, \"I don't know a soul in Oxford. And\nI thought perhaps you'd give me luncheon, and take me to see the\nboat-races. Will you?\"\n\n\"I shall be charmed,\" he said, pulling the bell-rope. Poor fool! he\nattributed the shade of disappointment on Zuleika's face to the coldness\nof his tone. He would dispel that shade. He would avow himself. He would\nleave her no longer in this false position. So soon as he had told them\nabout the meal, he would proclaim his passion.\n\nThe bell was answered by the landlady's daughter.\n\n\"Miss Dobson will stay to luncheon,\" said the Duke. The girl withdrew.\nHe wished he could have asked her not to.\n\nHe steeled himself. \"Miss Dobson,\" he said, \"I wish to apologise to\nyou.\"\n\nZuleika looked at him eagerly. \"You can't give me luncheon? You've got\nsomething better to do?\"\n\n\"No. I wish to ask you to forgive me for my behaviour last night.\"\n\n\"There is nothing to forgive.\"\n\n\"There is. My manners were vile. I know well what happened. Though you,\ntoo, cannot have forgotten, I won't spare myself the recital. You were\nmy hostess, and I ignored you. Magnanimous, you paid me the prettiest\ncompliment woman ever paid to man, and I insulted you. I left the house\nin order that I might not see you again. To the doorsteps down which\nhe should have kicked me, your grandfather followed me with words of\nkindliest courtesy. If he had sped me with a kick so skilful that my\nskull had been shattered on the kerb, neither would he have outstepped\nthose bounds set to the conduct of English gentlemen, nor would you have\ngarnered more than a trifle on account of your proper reckoning. I do\nnot say that you are the first person whom I have wantonly injured. But\nit is a fact that I, in whom pride has ever been the topmost quality,\nhave never expressed sorrow to any one for anything. Thus, I might urge\nthat my present abjectness must be intolerably painful to me, and should\nincline you to forgive. But such an argument were specious merely.\nI will be quite frank with you. I will confess to you that, in this\nhumbling of myself before you, I take a pleasure as passionate as it is\nstrange. A confusion of feelings? Yet you, with a woman's instinct, will\nhave already caught the clue to it. It needs no mirror to assure me\nthat the clue is here for you, in my eyes. It needs no dictionary of\nquotations to remind me that the eyes are the windows of the soul. And I\nknow that from two open windows my soul has been leaning and signalling\nto you, in a code far more definitive and swifter than words of mine,\nthat I love you.\"\n\nZuleika, listening to him, had grown gradually paler and paler. She had\nraised her hands and cowered as though he were about to strike her. And\nthen, as he pronounced the last three words, she had clasped her hands\nto her face and with a wild sob darted away from him. She was leaning\nnow against the window, her head bowed and her shoulders quivering.\n\nThe Duke came softly behind her. \"Why should you cry? Why should you\nturn away from me? Did I frighten you with the suddenness of my words? I\nam not versed in the tricks of wooing. I should have been more patient.\nBut I love you so much that I could hardly have waited. A secret hope\nthat you loved me too emboldened me, compelled me. You DO love me. I\nknow it. And, knowing it, I do but ask you to give yourself to me, to\nbe my wife. Why should you cry? Why should you shrink from me? Dear,\nif there were anything... any secret... if you had ever loved and been\ndeceived, do you think I should honour you the less deeply, should not\ncherish you the more tenderly? Enough for me, that you are mine. Do you\nthink I should ever reproach you for anything that may have--\"\n\nZuleika turned on him. \"How dare you?\" she gasped. \"How dare you speak\nto me like that?\"\n\nThe Duke reeled back. Horror had come into his eyes. \"You do not love\nme!\" he cried.\n\n\"LOVE you?\" she retorted. \"YOU?\"\n\n\"You no longer love me. Why? Why?\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"You loved me. Don't trifle with me. You came to me loving me with all\nyour heart.\"\n\n\"How do you know?\"\n\n\"Look in the glass.\" She went at his bidding. He followed her. \"You\nsee them?\" he said, after a long pause. Zuleika nodded. The two pearls\nquivered to her nod.\n\n\"They were white when you came to me,\" he sighed. \"They were white\nbecause you loved me. From them it was that I knew you loved me even as\nI loved you. But their old colours have come back to them. That is how I\nknow that your love for me is dead.\"\n\nZuleika stood gazing pensively, twitching the two pearls between her\nfingers. Tears gathered in her eyes. She met the reflection of her\nlover's eyes, and her tears brimmed over. She buried her face in her\nhands, and sobbed like a child.\n\nLike a child's, her sobbing ceased quite suddenly. She groped for her\nhandkerchief, angrily dried her eyes, and straightened and smoothed\nherself.\n\n\"Now I'm going,\" she said.\n\n\"You came here of your own accord, because you loved me,\" said the Duke.\n\"And you shall not go till you have told me why you have left off loving\nme.\"\n\n\"How did you know I loved you?\" she asked after a pause. \"How did you\nknow I hadn't simply put on another pair of ear-rings?\"\n\nThe Duke, with a melancholy laugh, drew the two studs from his\nwaistcoat-pocket. \"These are the studs I wore last night,\" he said.\n\nZuleika gazed at them. \"I see,\" she said; then, looking up, \"When did\nthey become like that?\"\n\n\"It was when you left the dining-room that I saw the change in them.\"\n\n\"How strange! It was when I went into the drawing-room that I noticed\nmine. I was looking in the glass, and\"--She started. \"Then you were in\nlove with me last night?\"\n\n\"I began to be in love with you from the moment I saw you.\"\n\n\"Then how could you have behaved as you did?\"\n\n\"Because I was a pedant. I tried to ignore you, as pedants always do try\nto ignore any fact they cannot fit into their pet system. The basis\nof my pet system was celibacy. I don't mean the mere state of being\na bachelor. I mean celibacy of the soul--egoism, in fact. You have\nconverted me from that. I am now a confirmed tuist.\"\n\n\"How dared you insult me?\" she cried, with a stamp of her foot.\n\"How dared you make a fool of me before those people? Oh, it is too\ninfamous!\"\n\n\"I have already asked you to forgive me for that. You said there was\nnothing to forgive.\"\n\n\"I didn't dream that you were in love with me.\"\n\n\"What difference can that make?\"\n\n\"All the difference! All the difference in life!\"\n\n\"Sit down! You bewilder me,\" said the Duke. \"Explain yourself!\" he\ncommanded.\n\n\"Isn't that rather much for a man to ask of a woman?\"\n\n\"I don't know. I have no experience of women. In the abstract, it seems\nto me that every man has a right to some explanation from the woman who\nhas ruined his life.\"\n\n\"You are frightfully sorry for yourself,\" said Zuleika, with a bitter\nlaugh. \"Of course it doesn't occur to you that _I_ am at all to be\npitied. No! you are blind with selfishness. You love me--I don't love\nyou: that is all you can realise. Probably you think you are the first\nman who has ever fallen on such a plight.\"\n\nSaid the Duke, bowing over a deprecatory hand, \"If there were to pass my\nwindow one tithe of them whose hearts have been lost to Miss Dobson, I\nshould win no solace from that interminable parade.\"\n\nZuleika blushed. \"Yet,\" she said more gently, \"be sure they would all be\nnot a little envious of YOU! Not one of them ever touched the surface of\nmy heart. You stirred my heart to its very depths. Yes, you made me love\nyou madly. The pearls told you no lie. You were my idol--the one thing\nin the wide world to me. You were so different from any man I had ever\nseen except in dreams. You did not make a fool of yourself. I admired\nyou. I respected you. I was all afire with adoration of you. And now,\"\nshe passed her hand across her eyes, \"now it is all over. The idol has\ncome sliding down its pedestal to fawn and grovel with all the other\ninfatuates in the dust about my feet.\"\n\nThe Duke looked thoughtfully at her. \"I thought,\" he said, \"that you\nrevelled in your power over men's hearts. I had always heard that you\nlived for admiration.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" said Zuleika, \"of course I like being admired. Oh yes, I like all\nthat very much indeed. In a way, I suppose, I'm even pleased that\nYOU admire me. But oh, what a little miserable pleasure that is in\ncomparison with the rapture I have forfeited! I had never known the\nrapture of being in love. I had longed for it, but I had never guessed\nhow wonderfully wonderful it was. It came to me. I shuddered and wavered\nlike a fountain in the wind. I was more helpless and flew lightlier\nthan a shred of thistledown among the stars. All night long, I could not\nsleep for love of you; nor had I any desire of sleep, save that it might\ntake me to you in a dream. I remember nothing that happened to me this\nmorning before I found myself at your door.\"\n\n\"Why did you ring the bell? Why didn't you walk away?\"\n\n\"Why? I had come to see you, to be near you, to be WITH you.\"\n\n\"To force yourself on me.\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"You know the meaning of the term 'effective occupation'? Having marched\nin, how could you have held your position, unless\"--\n\n\"Oh, a man doesn't necessarily drive a woman away because he isn't in\nlove with her.\"\n\n\"Yet that was what you thought I had done to you last night.\"\n\n\"Yes, but I didn't suppose you would take the trouble to do it again.\nAnd if you had, I should have only loved you the more. I thought you\nwould most likely be rather amused, rather touched, by my importunity. I\nthought you would take a listless advantage, make a plaything of me--the\ndiversion of a few idle hours in summer, and then, when you had tired\nof me, would cast me aside, forget me, break my heart. I desired nothing\nbetter than that. That is what I must have been vaguely hoping for. But\nI had no definite scheme. I wanted to be with you and I came to you. It\nseems years ago, now! How my heart beat as I waited on the doorstep! 'Is\nhis Grace at home?' 'I don't know. I'll inquire. What name shall I say?'\nI saw in the girl's eyes that she, too, loved you. Have YOU seen that?\"\n\n\"I have never looked at her,\" said the Duke.\n\n\"No wonder, then, that she loves you,\" sighed Zuleika. \"She read my\nsecret at a glance. Women who love the same man have a kind of bitter\nfreemasonry. We resented each other. She envied me my beauty, my dress.\nI envied the little fool her privilege of being always near to you.\nLoving you, I could conceive no life sweeter than hers--to be always\nnear you; to black your boots, carry up your coals, scrub your doorstep;\nalways to be working for you, hard and humbly and without thanks. If you\nhad refused to see me, I would have bribed that girl with all my jewels\nto cede me her position.\"\n\nThe Duke made a step towards her. \"You would do it still,\" he said in a\nlow voice.\n\nZuleika raised her eyebrows. \"I would not offer her one garnet,\" she\nsaid, \"now.\"\n\n\"You SHALL love me again,\" he cried. \"I will force you to. You said just\nnow that you had ceased to love me because I was just like other men. I\nam not. My heart is no tablet of mere wax, from which an instant's heat\ncan dissolve whatever impress it may bear, leaving it blank and soft\nfor another impress, and another, and another. My heart is a bright hard\ngem, proof against any die. Came Cupid, with one of his arrow-points\nfor graver, and what he cut on the gem's surface never can be effaced.\nThere, deeply and forever, your image is intagliated. No years, nor\nfires, nor cataclysm of total Nature, can efface from that great gem\nyour image.\"\n\n\"My dear Duke,\" said Zuleika, \"don't be so silly. Look at the matter\nsensibly. I know that lovers don't try to regulate their emotions\naccording to logic; but they do, nevertheless, unconsciously conform\nwith some sort of logical system. I left off loving you when I found\nthat you loved me. There is the premiss. Very well! Is it likely that I\nshall begin to love you again because you can't leave off loving me?\"\n\nThe Duke groaned. There was a clatter of plates outside, and she whom\nZuleika had envied came to lay the table for luncheon.\n\nA smile flickered across Zuleika's lips; and \"Not one garnet!\" she\nmurmured.\n\n\n\n\nV\n\nLuncheon passed in almost unbroken silence. Both Zuleika and the Duke\nwere ravenously hungry, as people always are after the stress of any\ngreat emotional crisis. Between them, they made very short work of\na cold chicken, a salad, a gooseberry-tart and a Camembert. The Duke\nfilled his glass again and again. The cold classicism of his face had\nbeen routed by the new romantic movement which had swept over his soul.\nHe looked two or three months older than when first I showed him to my\nreader.\n\nHe drank his coffee at one draught, pushed back his chair, threw away\nthe cigarette he had just lit. \"Listen!\" he said.\n\nZuleika folded her hands on her lap.\n\n\"You do not love me. I accept as final your hint that you never will\nlove me. I need not say--could not, indeed, ever say--how deeply, deeply\nyou have pained me. As lover, I am rejected. But that rejection,\" he\ncontinued, striking the table, \"is no stopper to my suit. It does but\ndrive me to the use of arguments. My pride shrinks from them. Love,\nhowever, is greater than pride; and I, John, Albert, Edward, Claude,\nOrde, Angus, Tankerton,* Tanville-Tankerton,** fourteenth Duke of\nDorset, Marquis of Dorset, Earl of Grove, Earl of Chastermaine, Viscount\nBrewsby, Baron Grove, Baron Petstrap, and Baron Wolock, in the Peerage\nof England, offer you my hand. Do not interrupt me. Do not toss your\nhead. Consider well what I am saying. Weigh the advantages you would\ngain by acceptance of my hand. Indeed, they are manifold and tremendous.\nThey are also obvious: do not shut your eyes to them. You, Miss Dobson,\nwhat are you? A conjurer, and a vagrant; without means, save such as you\ncan earn by the sleight of your hand; without position; without a\nhome; all unguarded but by your own self-respect. That you follow an\nhonourable calling, I do not for one moment deny. I do, however, ask\nyou to consider how great are its perils and hardships, its fatigues and\ninconveniences. From all these evils I offer you instant refuge. I offer\nyou, Miss Dobson, a refuge more glorious and more augustly gilded\nthan you, in your airiest flights of fancy, can ever have hoped for or\nimagined. I own about 340,000 acres. My town-residence is in St. James's\nSquare. Tankerton, of which you may have seen photographs, is the chief\nof my country-seats. It is a Tudor house, set on the ridge of a valley.\nThe valley, its park, is halved by a stream so narrow that the deer leap\nacross. The gardens are estraded upon the slope. Round the house runs\na wide paven terrace. There are always two or three peacocks trailing\ntheir sheathed feathers along the balustrade, and stepping how stiffly!\nas though they had just been unharnessed from Juno's chariot. Two\nflights of shallow steps lead down to the flowers and fountains. Oh,\nthe gardens are wonderful. There is a Jacobean garden of white roses.\nBetween the ends of two pleached alleys, under a dome of branches, is\na little lake, with a Triton of black marble, and with water-lilies.\nHither and thither under the archipelago of water-lilies, dart\ngold-fish--tongues of flame in the dark water. There is also a long\nstrait alley of clipped yew. It ends in an alcove for a pagoda\nof painted porcelain which the Prince Regent--peace be to his\nashes!--presented to my great-grandfather. There are many twisting\npaths, and sudden aspects, and devious, fantastic arbours. Are you fond\nof horses? In my stables of pine-wood and plated-silver seventy are\ninstalled. Not all of them together could vie in power with one of the\nmeanest of my motor-cars.\"\n\n   *Pronounced as Tacton.\n\n  **Pronounced as Tavvle-Tacton.\n\n\"Oh, I never go in motors,\" said Zuleika. \"They make one look like\nnothing on earth, and like everybody else.\"\n\n\"I myself,\" said the Duke, \"use them little for that very reason. Are\nyou interested in farming? At Tankerton there is a model farm which\nwould at any rate amuse you, with its heifers and hens and pigs that are\nlike so many big new toys. There is a tiny dairy, which is called 'Her\nGrace's.' You could make, therein, real butter with your own hands, and\nround it into little pats, and press every pat with a different device.\nThe boudoir that would be yours is a blue room. Four Watteaus hang in\nit. In the dining-hall hang portraits of my forefathers--in petto,\nyour forefathers-in-law--by many masters. Are you fond of peasants?\nMy tenantry are delightful creatures, and there is not one of them who\nremembers the bringing of the news of the Battle of Waterloo. When a\nnew Duchess is brought to Tankerton, the oldest elm in the park must\nbe felled. That is one of many strange old customs. As she is driven\nthrough the village, the children of the tenantry must strew the road\nwith daisies. The bridal chamber must be lighted with as many candles as\nyears have elapsed since the creation of the Dukedom. If you came into\nit, there would be\"--and the youth, closing his eyes, made a rapid\ncalculation--\"exactly three hundred and eighty-eight candles. On the eve\nof the death of a Duke of Dorset, two black owls come and perch on the\nbattlements. They remain there through the night, hooting. At dawn\nthey fly away, none knows whither. On the eve of the death of any other\nTanville-Tankerton, comes (no matter what be the time of year) a cuckoo.\nIt stays for an hour, cooing, then flies away, none knows whither.\nWhenever this portent occurs, my steward telegraphs to me, that I, as\nhead of the family, be not unsteeled against the shock of a bereavement,\nand that my authority be sooner given for the unsealing and garnishing\nof the family-vault. Not every forefather of mine rests quiet beneath\nhis escutcheoned marble. There are they who revisit, in their wrath or\ntheir remorse, the places wherein erst they suffered or wrought evil.\nThere is one who, every Halloween, flits into the dining-hall, and\nhovers before the portrait which Hans Holbein made of him, and flings\nhis diaphanous grey form against the canvas, hoping, maybe, to catch\nfrom it the fiery flesh-tints and the solid limbs that were his, and so\nto be re-incarnate. He flies against the painting, only to find himself\nt'other side of the wall it hangs on. There are five ghosts permanently\nresiding in the right wing of the house, two in the left, and eleven in\nthe park. But all are quite noiseless and quite harmless. My servants,\nwhen they meet them in the corridors or on the stairs, stand aside to\nlet them pass, thus paying them the respect due to guests of mine; but\nnot even the rawest housemaid ever screams or flees at sight of them. I,\ntheir host, often waylay them and try to commune with them; but always\nthey glide past me. And how gracefully they glide, these ghosts! It is a\npleasure to watch them. It is a lesson in deportment. May they never be\nlaid! Of all my household-pets, they are the dearest to me. I am Duke\nof Strathsporran and Cairngorm, Marquis of Sorby, and Earl Cairngorm, in\nthe Peerage of Scotland. In the glens of the hills about Strathsporran\nare many noble and nimble stags. But I have never set foot in my house\nthere, for it is carpeted throughout with the tartan of my clan. You\nseem to like tartan. What tartan is it you are wearing?\"\n\nZuleika looked down at her skirt. \"I don't know,\" she said. \"I got it in\nParis.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said the Duke, \"it is very ugly. The Dalbraith tartan is\nharmonious in comparison, and has, at least, the excuse of history. If\nyou married me, you would have the right to wear it. You would have many\nstrange and fascinating rights. You would go to Court. I admit that the\nHanoverian Court is not much. Still, it is better than nothing. At your\npresentation, moreover, you would be given the entree. Is that nothing\nto you? You would be driven to Court in my statecoach. It is swung so\nhigh that the streetsters can hardly see its occupant. It is lined\nwith rose-silk; and on its panels, and on its hammer-cloth, my arms\nare emblazoned--no one has ever been able to count the quarterings. You\nwould be wearing the family-jewels, reluctantly surrendered to you by my\naunt. They are many and marvellous, in their antique settings. I don't\nwant to brag. It humiliates me to speak to you as I am speaking. But\nI am heart-set on you, and to win you there is not a precious stone I\nwould leave unturned. Conceive a parure all of white stones--diamonds,\nwhite sapphires, white topazes, tourmalines. Another, of rubies and\namethysts, set in gold filigree. Rings that once were poison-combs on\nFlorentine fingers. Red roses for your hair--every petal a hollowed\nruby. Amulets and ape-buckles, zones and fillets. Aye! know that you\nwould be weeping for wonder before you had seen a tithe of these gauds.\nKnow, too, Miss Dobson, that in the Peerage of France I am Duc d'Etretat\net de la Roche Guillaume. Louis Napoleon gave the title to my father for\nnot cutting him in the Bois. I have a house in the Champs Elysees. There\nis a Swiss in its courtyard. He stands six-foot-seven in his stockings,\nand the chasseurs are hardly less tall than he. Wherever I go, there are\ntwo chefs in my retinue. Both are masters in their art, and furiously\njealous of each other. When I compliment either of them on some dish,\nthe other challenges him. They fight with rapiers, next morning, in the\ngarden of whatever house I am occupying. I do not know whether you are\ngreedy? If so, it may interest you to learn that I have a third chef,\nwho makes only souffles, and an Italian pastry-cook; to say nothing of\na Spaniard for salads, an Englishwoman for roasts, and an Abyssinian for\ncoffee. You found no trace of their handiwork in the meal you have just\nhad with me? No; for in Oxford it is a whim of mine--I may say a point\nof honour--to lead the ordinary life of an undergraduate. What I eat\nin this room is cooked by the heavy and unaided hand of Mrs. Batch,\nmy landlady. It is set before me by the unaided and--or are you in\nerror?--loving hand of her daughter. Other ministers have I none here. I\ndispense with my private secretaries. I am unattended by a single valet.\nSo simple a way of life repels you? You would never be called upon to\nshare it. If you married me, I should take my name off the books of my\nCollege. I propose that we should spend our honeymoon at Baiae. I have\na villa at Baiae. It is there that I keep my grandfather's collection of\nmajolica. The sun shines there always. A long olive-grove secretes the\ngarden from the sea. When you walk in the garden, you know the sea only\nin blue glimpses through the vacillating leaves. White-gleaming from the\nbosky shade of this grove are several goddesses. Do you care for Canova?\nI don't myself. If you do, these figures will appeal to you: they are in\nhis best manner. Do you love the sea? This is not the only house of mine\nthat looks out on it. On the coast of County Clare--am I not Earl of\nEnniskerry and Baron Shandrin in the Peerage of Ireland?--I have an\nancient castle. Sheer from a rock stands it, and the sea has always\nraged up against its walls. Many ships lie wrecked under that loud\nimplacable sea. But mine is a brave strong castle. No storm affrights\nit; and not the centuries, clustering houris, with their caresses can\nseduce it from its hard austerity. I have several titles which for the\nmoment escape me. Baron Llffthwchl am I, and... and... but you can\nfind them for yourself in Debrett. In me you behold a Prince of the Holy\nRoman Empire, and a Knight of the Most Noble Order of the Garter. Look\nwell at me! I am Hereditary Comber of the Queen's Lap-Dogs. I am young.\nI am handsome. My temper is sweet, and my character without blemish. In\nfine, Miss Dobson, I am a most desirable parti.\"\n\n\"But,\" said Zuleika, \"I don't love you.\"\n\nThe Duke stamped his foot. \"I beg your pardon,\" he said hastily. \"I\nought not to have done that. But--you seem to have entirely missed the\npoint of what I was saying.\"\n\n\"No, I haven't,\" said Zuleika.\n\n\"Then what,\" cried the Duke, standing over her, \"what is your reply?\"\n\nSaid Zuleika, looking up at him, \"My reply is that I think you are an\nawful snob.\"\n\nThe Duke turned on his heel, and strode to the other end of the room.\nThere he stood for some moments, his back to Zuleika.\n\n\"I think,\" she resumed in a slow, meditative voice, \"that you are, with\nthe possible exception of a Mr. Edelweiss, THE most awful snob I have\never met.\"\n\nThe Duke looked back over his shoulder. He gave Zuleika the stinging\nreprimand of silence. She was sorry, and showed it in her eyes. She felt\nshe had gone too far. True, he was nothing to her now. But she had loved\nhim once. She could not forget that.\n\n\"Come!\" she said. \"Let us be good friends. Give me your hand!\" He came\nto her, slowly. \"There!\"\n\nThe Duke withdrew his fingers before she unclasped them. That\ntwice-flung taunt rankled still. It was monstrous to have been called\na snob. A snob!--he, whose readiness to form what would certainly be\nregarded as a shocking misalliance ought to have stifled the charge, not\nmerely vindicated him from it! He had forgotten, in the blindness of his\nlove, how shocking the misalliance would be. Perhaps she, unloving, had\nnot been so forgetful? Perhaps her refusal had been made, generously,\nfor his own sake. Nay, rather for her own. Evidently, she had felt that\nthe high sphere from which he beckoned was no place for the likes of\nher. Evidently, she feared she would pine away among those strange\nsplendours, never be acclimatised, always be unworthy. He had thought to\noverwhelm her, and he had done his work too thoroughly. Now he must try\nto lighten the load he had imposed.\n\nSeating himself opposite to her, \"You remember,\" he said, \"that there is\na dairy at Tankerton?\"\n\n\"A dairy? Oh yes.\"\n\n\"Do you remember what it is called?\"\n\nZuleika knit her brows.\n\nHe helped her out. \"It is called 'Her Grace's'.\"\n\n\"Oh, of course!\" said Zuleika.\n\n\"Do you know WHY it is called so?\"\n\n\"Well, let's see... I know you told me.\"\n\n\"Did I? I think not. I will tell you now... That cool out-house dates\nfrom the middle of the eighteenth century. My great-great-grandfather,\nwhen he was a very old man, married en troisiemes noces a dairy-maid\non the Tankerton estate. Meg Speedwell was her name. He had seen her\nwalking across a field, not many months after the interment of his\nsecond Duchess, Maria, that great and gifted lady. I know not whether it\nwas that her bonny mien fanned in him some embers of his youth, or that\nhe was loth to be outdone in gracious eccentricity by his crony the Duke\nof Dewlap, who himself had just taken a bride from a dairy. (You have\nread Meredith's account of that affair? No? You should.) Whether it was\nveritable love or mere modishness that formed my ancestor's resolve,\npresently the bells were ringing out, and the oldest elm in the park was\nbeing felled, in Meg Speedwell's honour, and the children were strewing\ndaisies on which Meg Speedwell trod, a proud young hoyden of a bride,\nwith her head in the air and her heart in the seventh heaven. The Duke\nhad given her already a horde of fine gifts; but these, he had said,\nwere nothing--trash in comparison with the gift that was to ensure for\nher a perdurable felicity. After the wedding-breakfast, when all the\nsquires had ridden away on their cobs, and all the squires' ladies in\ntheir coaches, the Duke led his bride forth from the hall, leaning on\nher arm, till they came to a little edifice of new white stone, very\nspick and span, with two lattice-windows and a bright green door\nbetween. This he bade her enter. A-flutter with excitement, she\nturned the handle. In a moment she flounced back, red with shame and\nanger--flounced forth from the fairest, whitest, dapperest dairy,\nwherein was all of the best that the keenest dairy-maid might need. The\nDuke bade her dry her eyes, for that it ill befitted a great lady to be\nweeping on her wedding-day. 'As for gratitude,' he chuckled, 'zounds!\nthat is a wine all the better for the keeping.' Duchess Meg soon forgot\nthis unworthy wedding-gift, such was her rapture in the other, the so\naugust, appurtenances of her new life. What with her fine silk gowns\nand farthingales, and her powder-closet, and the canopied bed she slept\nin--a bed bigger far than the room she had slept in with her sisters,\nand standing in a room far bigger than her father's cottage; and\nwhat with Betty, her maid, who had pinched and teased her at the\nvillage-school, but now waited on her so meekly and trembled so\nfearfully at a scolding; and what with the fine hot dishes that were set\nbefore her every day, and the gallant speeches and glances of the fine\nyoung gentlemen whom the Duke invited from London, Duchess Meg was quite\nthe happiest Duchess in all England. For a while, she was like a child\nin a hay-rick. But anon, as the sheer delight of novelty wore away, she\nbegan to take a more serious view of her position. She began to realise\nher responsibilities. She was determined to do all that a great lady\nought to do. Twice every day she assumed the vapours. She schooled\nherself in the mysteries of Ombre, of Macao. She spent hours over the\ntambour-frame. She rode out on horse-back, with a riding-master. She had\na music-master to teach her the spinet; a dancing-master, too, to teach\nher the Minuet and the Triumph and the Gaudy. All these accomplishments\nshe found mighty hard. She was afraid of her horse. All the morning, she\ndreaded the hour when it would be brought round from the stables. She\ndreaded her dancing-lesson. Try as she would, she could but stamp her\nfeet flat on the parquet, as though it had been the village-green. She\ndreaded her music-lesson. Her fingers, disobedient to her ambition,\nclumsily thumped the keys of the spinet, and by the notes of the score\npropped up before her she was as cruelly perplexed as by the black and\nred pips of the cards she conned at the gaming-table, or by the red\nand gold threads that were always straying and snapping on her\ntambour-frame. Still she persevered. Day in, day out, sullenly, she\nworked hard to be a great lady. But skill came not to her, and hope\ndwindled; only the dull effort remained. One accomplishment she did\nmaster--to wit, the vapours: they became for her a dreadful reality. She\nlost her appetite for the fine hot dishes. All night long she lay awake,\nrestless, tearful, under the fine silk canopy, till dawn stared her\ninto slumber. She seldom scolded Betty. She who had been so lusty and so\nblooming saw in her mirror that she was pale and thin now; and the fine\nyoung gentlemen, seeing it too, paid more heed now to their wine and\ntheir dice than to her. And always, when she met him, the Duke smiled\nthe same mocking smile. Duchess Meg was pining slowly and surely away...\nOne morning, in Spring-time, she altogether vanished. Betty, bringing\nthe cup of chocolate to the bedside, found the bed empty. She raised the\nalarm among her fellows. They searched high and low. Nowhere was their\nmistress. The news was broken to their master, who, without comment,\nrose, bade his man dress him, and presently walked out to the place\nwhere he knew he would find her. And there, to be sure, she was,\nchurning, churning for dear life. Her sleeves were rolled above her\nelbows, and her skirt was kilted high; and, as she looked back over her\nshoulder and saw the Duke, there was the flush of roses in her cheeks,\nand the light of a thousand thanks in her eyes. 'Oh,' she cried, 'what\na curtsey I would drop you, but that to let go the handle were to spoil\nall!' And every morning, ever after, she woke when the birds woke, rose\nwhen they rose, and went singing through the dawn to the dairy, there to\npractise for her pleasure that sweet and lowly handicraft which she had\nonce practised for her need. And every evening, with her milking-stool\nunder her arm, and her milk-pail in her hand, she went into the field\nand called the cows to her, as she had been wont to do. To those other,\nthose so august, accomplishments she no more pretended. She gave them\nthe go-by. And all the old zest and joyousness of her life came back\nto her. Soundlier than ever slept she, and sweetlier dreamed, under the\nfine silk canopy, till the birds called her to her work. Greater than\never was her love of the fine furbelows that were hers to flaunt in, and\nsharper her appetite for the fine hot dishes, and more tempestuous her\nscolding of Betty, poor maid. She was more than ever now the cynosure,\nthe adored, of the fine young gentlemen. And as for her husband, she\nlooked up to him as the wisest, kindest man in all the world.\"\n\n\"And the fine young gentlemen,\" said Zuleika, \"did she fall in love with\nany of them?\"\n\n\"You forget,\" said the Duke coldly, \"she was married to a member of my\nfamily.\"\n\n\"Oh, I beg your pardon. But tell me: did they ALL adore her?\"\n\n\"Yes. Every one of them, wildly, madly.\"\n\n\"Ah,\" murmured Zuleika, with a smile of understanding. A shadow crossed\nher face, \"Even so,\" she said, with some pique, \"I don't suppose she had\nso very many adorers. She never went out into the world.\"\n\n\"Tankerton,\" said the Duke drily, \"is a large house, and my\ngreat-great-grandfather was the most hospitable of men. However,\" he\nadded, marvelling that she had again missed the point so utterly, \"my\npurpose was not to confront you with a past rival in conquest, but to\nset at rest a fear which I had, I think, roused in you by my somewhat\nfull description of the high majestic life to which you, as my bride,\nwould be translated.\"\n\n\"A fear? What sort of a fear?\"\n\n\"That you would not breathe freely--that you would starve (if I may use\na somewhat fantastic figure) among those strawberry-leaves. And so I\ntold you the story of Meg Speedwell, and how she lived happily ever\nafter. Nay, hear me out! The blood of Meg Speedwell's lord flows in\nmy veins. I think I may boast that I have inherited something of his\nsagacity. In any case, I can profit by his example. Do not fear that\nI, if you were to wed me, should demand a metamorphosis of your present\nself. I should take you as you are, gladly. I should encourage you to be\nalways exactly as you are--a radiant, irresistible member of the upper\nmiddle-class, with a certain freedom of manner acquired through a\nlife of peculiar liberty. Can you guess what would be my principal\nwedding-gift to you? Meg Speedwell had her dairy. For you, would be\nbuilt another outhouse--a neat hall wherein you would perform your\nconjuring-tricks, every evening except Sunday, before me and my tenants\nand my servants, and before such of my neighbours as might care to come.\nNone would respect you the less, seeing that I approved. Thus in\nyou would the pleasant history of Meg Speedwell repeat itself. You,\npractising for your pleasure--nay, hear me out!--that sweet and lowly\nhandicraft which--\"\n\n\"I won't listen to another word!\" cried Zuleika. \"You are the most\ninsolent person I have ever met. I happen to come of a particularly good\nfamily. I move in the best society. My manners are absolutely perfect.\nIf I found myself in the shoes of twenty Duchesses simultaneously, I\nshould know quite well how to behave. As for the one pair you can offer\nme, I kick them away--so. I kick them back at you. I tell you--\"\n\n\"Hush,\" said the Duke, \"hush! You are over-excited. There will be a\ncrowd under my window. There, there! I am sorry. I thought--\"\n\n\"Oh, I know what you thought,\" said Zuleika, in a quieter tone. \"I am\nsure you meant well. I am sorry I lost my temper. Only, you might have\ngiven me credit for meaning what I said: that I would not marry you,\nbecause I did not love you. I daresay there would be great advantages\nin being your Duchess. But the fact is, I have no worldly wisdom. To me,\nmarriage is a sacrament. I could no more marry a man about whom I could\nnot make a fool of myself than I could marry one who made a fool of\nhimself about me. Else had I long ceased to be a spinster. Oh my friend,\ndo not imagine that I have not rejected, in my day, a score of suitors\nquite as eligible as you.\"\n\n\"As eligible? Who were they?\" frowned the Duke.\n\n\"Oh, Archduke this, and Grand Duke that, and His Serene Highness the\nother. I have a wretched memory for names.\"\n\n\"And my name, too, will soon escape you, perhaps?\"\n\n\"No. Oh, no. I shall always remember yours. You see, I was in love with\nyou. You deceived me into loving you...\" She sighed. \"Oh, had you but\nbeen as strong as I thought you... Still, a swain the more. That is\nsomething.\" She leaned forward, smiling archly. \"Those studs--show me\nthem again.\"\n\nThe Duke displayed them in the hollow of his hand. She touched them\nlightly, reverently, as a tourist touches a sacred relic in a church.\n\nAt length, \"Do give me them,\" she said. \"I will keep them in a little\nsecret partition of my jewel-case.\" The Duke had closed his fist. \"Do!\"\nshe pleaded. \"My other jewels--they have no separate meanings for me.\nI never remember who gave me this one or that. These would be quite\ndifferent. I should always remember their history... Do!\"\n\n\"Ask me for anything else,\" said the Duke. \"These are the one thing I\ncould not part with--even to you, for whose sake they are hallowed.\"\n\nZuleika pouted. On the verge of persisting, she changed her mind, and\nwas silent.\n\n\"Well!\" she said abruptly, \"how about these races? Are you going to take\nme to see them?\"\n\n\"Races? What races?\" murmured the Duke. \"Oh yes. I had forgotten. Do you\nreally mean that you want to see them?\"\n\n\"Why, of course! They are great fun, aren't they?\"\n\n\"And you are in a mood for great fun? Well, there is plenty of time. The\nSecond Division is not rowed till half-past four.\"\n\n\"The Second Division? Why not take me to the First?\"\n\n\"That is not rowed till six.\"\n\n\"Isn't this rather an odd arrangement?\"\n\n\"No doubt. But Oxford never pretended to be strong in mathematics.\"\n\n\"Why, it's not yet three!\" cried Zuleika, with a woebegone stare at the\nclock. \"What is to be done in the meantime?\"\n\n\"Am not I sufficiently diverting?\" asked the Duke bitterly.\n\n\"Quite candidly, no. Have you any friend lodging with you here?\"\n\n\"One, overhead. A man named Noaks.\"\n\n\"A small man, with spectacles?\"\n\n\"Very small, with very large spectacles.\"\n\n\"He was pointed out to me yesterday, as I was driving from the Station\n... No, I don't think I want to meet him. What can you have in common\nwith him?\"\n\n\"One frailty, at least: he, too, Miss Dobson, loves you.\"\n\n\"But of course he does. He saw me drive past. Very few of the others,\"\nshe said, rising and shaking herself, \"have set eyes on me. Do let us go\nout and look at the Colleges. I do need change of scene. If you were a\ndoctor, you would have prescribed that long ago. It is very bad for me\nto be here, a kind of Cinderella, moping over the ashes of my love for\nyou. Where is your hat?\"\n\nLooking round, she caught sight of herself in the glass. \"Oh,\" she\ncried, \"what a fright I do look! I must never be seen like this!\"\n\n\"You look very beautiful.\"\n\n\"I don't. That is a lover's illusion. You yourself told me that this\ntartan was perfectly hideous. There was no need to tell me that. I\ncame thus because I was coming to see you. I chose this frock in the\ndeliberate fear that you, if I made myself presentable, might succumb at\nsecond sight of me. I would have sent out for a sack and dressed myself\nin that, I would have blacked my face all over with burnt cork, only I\nwas afraid of being mobbed on the way to you.\"\n\n\"Even so, you would but have been mobbed for your incorrigible beauty.\"\n\n\"My beauty! How I hate it!\" sighed Zuleika. \"Still, here it is, and I\nmust needs make the best of it. Come! Take me to Judas. I will change my\nthings. Then I shall be fit for the races.\"\n\nAs these two emerged, side by side, into the street, the Emperors\nexchanged stony sidelong glances. For they saw the more than normal\npallor of the Duke's face, and something very like desperation in his\neyes. They saw the tragedy progressing to its foreseen close. Unable to\nstay its course, they were grimly fascinated now.\n\n\n\n\nVI\n\n\"The evil that men do lives after them; the good is oft interred with\ntheir bones.\" At any rate, the sinner has a better chance than the saint\nof being hereafter remembered. We, in whom original sin preponderates,\nfind him easier to understand. He is near to us, clear to us. The saint\nis remote, dim. A very great saint may, of course, be remembered through\nsome sheer force of originality in him; and then the very mystery that\ninvolves him for us makes him the harder to forget: he haunts us the\nmore surely because we shall never understand him. But the ordinary\nsaints grow faint to posterity; whilst quite ordinary sinners pass\nvividly down the ages.\n\nOf the disciples of Jesus, which is he that is most often remembered\nand cited by us? Not the disciple whom Jesus loved; neither of the\nBoanerges, nor any other of them who so steadfastly followed Him and\nserved Him; but the disciple who betrayed Him for thirty pieces of\nsilver. Judas Iscariot it is who outstands, overshadowing those\nother fishermen. And perhaps it was by reason of this precedence that\nChristopher Whitrid, Knight, in the reign of Henry VI., gave the name of\nJudas to the College which he had founded. Or perhaps it was because he\nfelt that in a Christian community not even the meanest and basest of\nmen should be accounted beneath contempt, beyond redemption.\n\nAt any rate, thus he named his foundation. And, though for Oxford men\nthe savour of the name itself has long evaporated through its local\nconnexion, many things show that for the Founder himself it was no empty\nvocable. In a niche above the gate stands a rudely carved statue\nof Judas, holding a money-bag in his right hand. Among the original\nstatutes of the College is one by which the Bursar is enjoined to\ndistribute in Passion Week thirty pieces of silver among the needier\nscholars \"for saike of atonynge.\" The meadow adjoining the back of the\nCollege has been called from time immemorial \"the Potter's Field.\" And\nthe name of Salt Cellar is not less ancient and significant.\n\nSalt Cellar, that grey and green quadrangle visible from the room\nassigned to Zuleika, is very beautiful, as I have said. So tranquil is\nit as to seem remote not merely from the world, but even from Oxford, so\ndeeply is it hidden away in the core of Oxford's heart. So tranquil\nis it, one would guess that nothing had ever happened in it. For five\ncenturies these walls have stood, and during that time have beheld, one\nwould say, no sight less seemly than the good work of weeding, mowing,\nrolling, that has made, at length, so exemplary the lawn. These\ncloisters that grace the south and east sides--five centuries have\npassed through them, leaving in them no echo, leaving on them no\nsign, of all that the outer world, for good or evil, has been doing so\nfiercely, so raucously.\n\nAnd yet, if you are versed in the antiquities of Oxford, you know that\nthis small, still quadrangle has played its part in the rough-and-tumble\nof history, and has been the background of high passions and strange\nfates. The sun-dial in its midst has told the hours to more than one\nbygone King. Charles I. lay for twelve nights in Judas; and it was here,\nin this very quadrangle, that he heard from the lips of a breathless and\nblood-stained messenger the news of Chalgrove Field. Sixty years later,\nJames, his son, came hither, black with threats, and from one of the\nhind-windows of the Warden's house--maybe, from the very room where now\nZuleika was changing her frock--addressed the Fellows, and presented\nto them the Papist by him chosen to be their Warden, instead of the\nProtestant whom they had elected. They were not of so stern a stuff as\nthe Fellows of Magdalen, who, despite His Majesty's menaces, had just\nrejected Bishop Farmer. The Papist was elected, there and then, al\nfresco, without dissent. Cannot one see them, these Fellows of Judas,\nhuddled together round the sun-dial, like so many sheep in a storm? The\nKing's wrath, according to a contemporary record, was so appeased by\ntheir pliancy that he deigned to lie for two nights in Judas, and at\na grand refection in Hall \"was gracious and merrie.\" Perhaps it was in\nlingering gratitude for such patronage that Judas remained so pious to\nhis memory even after smug Herrenhausen had been dumped down on us for\never. Certainly, of all the Colleges none was more ardent than Judas for\nJames Stuart. Thither it was that young Sir Harry Esson led, under cover\nof night, three-score recruits whom he had enlisted in the surrounding\nvillages. The cloisters of Salt Cellar were piled with arms and stores;\nand on its grass--its sacred grass!--the squad was incessantly drilled,\nagainst the good day when Ormond should land his men in Devon. For a\nwhole month Salt Cellar was a secret camp. But somehow, at length--woe\nto \"lost causes and impossible loyalties\"--Herrenhausen had wind of\nit; and one night, when the soldiers of the white cockade lay snoring\nbeneath the stars, stealthily the white-faced Warden unbarred his\npostern--that very postern through which now Zuleika had passed on the\nway to her bedroom--and stealthily through it, one by one on tip-toe,\ncame the King's foot-guards. Not many shots rang out, nor many swords\nclashed, in the night air, before the trick was won for law and order.\nMost of the rebels were overpowered in their sleep; and those who had\ntime to snatch arms were too dazed to make good resistance. Sir Harry\nEsson himself was the only one who did not live to be hanged. He had\nsprung up alert, sword in hand, at the first alarm, setting his back to\nthe cloisters. There he fought calmly, ferociously, till a bullet went\nthrough his chest. \"By God, this College is well-named!\" were the words\nhe uttered as he fell forward and died.\n\nComparatively tame was the scene now being enacted in this place. The\nDuke, with bowed head, was pacing the path between the lawn and the\ncloisters. Two other undergraduates stood watching him, whispering\nto each other, under the archway that leads to the Front Quadrangle.\nPresently, in a sheepish way, they approached him. He halted and looked\nup.\n\n\"I say,\" stammered the spokesman.\n\n\"Well?\" asked the Duke. Both youths were slightly acquainted with him;\nbut he was not used to being spoken to by those whom he had not first\naddressed. Moreover, he was loth to be thus disturbed in his sombre\nreverie. His manner was not encouraging.\n\n\"Isn't it a lovely day for the Eights?\" faltered the spokesman.\n\n\"I conceive,\" the Duke said, \"that you hold back some other question.\"\n\nThe spokesman smiled weakly. Nudged by the other, he muttered \"Ask him\nyourself!\"\n\nThe Duke diverted his gaze to the other, who, with an angry look at the\none, cleared his throat, and said \"I was going to ask if you thought\nMiss Dobson would come and have luncheon with me to-morrow?\"\n\n\"A sister of mine will be there,\" explained the one, knowing the Duke to\nbe a precisian.\n\n\"If you are acquainted with Miss Dobson, a direct invitation should be\nsent to her,\" said the Duke. \"If you are not--\" The aposiopesis was icy.\n\n\"Well, you see,\" said the other of the two, \"that is just the\ndifficulty. I AM acquainted with her. But is she acquainted with ME? I\nmet her at breakfast this morning, at the Warden's.\"\n\n\"So did I,\" added the one.\n\n\"But she--well,\" continued the other, \"she didn't take much notice of\nus. She seemed to be in a sort of dream.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" murmured the Duke, with melancholy interest.\n\n\"The only time she opened her lips,\" said the other, \"was when she asked\nus whether we took tea or coffee.\"\n\n\"She put hot milk in my tea,\" volunteered the one, \"and upset the cup\nover my hand, and smiled vaguely.\"\n\n\"And smiled vaguely,\" sighed the Duke.\n\n\"She left us long before the marmalade stage,\" said the one.\n\n\"Without a word,\" said the other.\n\n\"Without a glance?\" asked the Duke. It was testified by the one and the\nother that there had been not so much as a glance.\n\n\"Doubtless,\" the disingenuous Duke said, \"she had a headache... Was she\npale?\"\n\n\"Very pale,\" answered the one.\n\n\"A healthy pallor,\" qualified the other, who was a constant reader of\nnovels.\n\n\"Did she look,\" the Duke inquired, \"as if she had spent a sleepless\nnight?\"\n\nThat was the impression made on both.\n\n\"Yet she did not seem listless or unhappy?\"\n\nNo, they would not go so far as to say that.\n\n\"Indeed, were her eyes of an almost unnatural brilliance?\"\n\n\"Quite unnatural,\" confessed the one.\n\n\"Twin stars,\" interpolated the other.\n\n\"Did she, in fact, seem to be consumed by some inward rapture?\"\n\nYes, now they came to think of it, this was exactly how she HAD seemed.\n\nIt was sweet, it was bitter, for the Duke. \"I remember,\" Zuleika had\nsaid to him, \"nothing that happened to me this morning till I found\nmyself at your door.\" It was bitter-sweet to have that outline filled in\nby these artless pencils. No, it was only bitter, to be, at his time of\nlife, living in the past.\n\n\"The purpose of your tattle?\" he asked coldly.\n\nThe two youths hurried to the point from which he had diverted them.\n\"When she went by with you just now,\" said the one, \"she evidently\ndidn't know us from Adam.\"\n\n\"And I had so hoped to ask her to luncheon,\" said the other.\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"Well, we wondered if you would re-introduce us. And then perhaps...\"\n\nThere was a pause. The Duke was touched to kindness for these\nfellow-lovers. He would fain preserve them from the anguish that beset\nhimself. So humanising is sorrow.\n\n\"You are in love with Miss Dobson?\" he asked.\n\nBoth nodded.\n\n\"Then,\" said he, \"you will in time be thankful to me for not affording\nyou further traffic with that lady. To love and be scorned--does Fate\nhold for us a greater inconvenience? You think I beg the question? Let\nme tell you that I, too, love Miss Dobson, and that she scorns me.\"\n\nTo the implied question \"What chance would there be for you?\" the reply\nwas obvious.\n\nAmazed, abashed, the two youths turned on their heels.\n\n\"Stay!\" said the Duke. \"Let me, in justice to myself, correct an\ninference you may have drawn. It is not by reason of any defect in\nmyself, perceived or imagined, that Miss Dobson scorns me. She scorns me\nsimply because I love her. All who love her she scorns. To see her is\nto love her. Therefore shut your eyes to her. Strictly exclude her from\nyour horizon. Ignore her. Will you do this?\"\n\n\"We will try,\" said the one, after a pause.\n\n\"Thank you very much,\" added the other.\n\nThe Duke watched them out of sight. He wished he could take the good\nadvice he had given them... Suppose he did take it! Suppose he went\nto the Bursar, obtained an exeat, fled straight to London! What just\nhumiliation for Zuleika to come down and find her captive gone! He\npictured her staring around the quadrangle, ranging the cloisters,\ncalling to him. He pictured her rustling to the gate of the College,\ninquiring at the porter's lodge. \"His Grace, Miss, he passed through a\nminute ago. He's going down this afternoon.\"\n\nYet, even while his fancy luxuriated in this scheme, he well knew that\nhe would not accomplish anything of the kind--knew well that he would\nwait here humbly, eagerly, even though Zuleika lingered over her toilet\ntill crack o' doom. He had no desire that was not centred in her. Take\naway his love for her, and what remained? Nothing--though only in the\npast twenty-four hours had this love been added to him. Ah, why had\nhe ever seen her? He thought of his past, its cold splendour and\ninsouciance. But he knew that for him there was no returning. His boats\nwere burnt. The Cytherean babes had set their torches to that flotilla,\nand it had blazed like match-wood. On the isle of the enchantress he was\nstranded for ever. For ever stranded on the isle of an enchantress who\nwould have nothing to do with him! What, he wondered, should be done in\nso piteous a quandary? There seemed to be two courses. One was to pine\nslowly and painfully away. The other...\n\nAcademically, the Duke had often reasoned that a man for whom life holds\nno chance of happiness cannot too quickly shake life off. Now, of a\nsudden, there was for that theory a vivid application.\n\n\"Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer\" was not a point by which he,\n\"more an antique Roman than a Dane,\" was at all troubled. Never had he\ngiven ear to that cackle which is called Public Opinion. The judgment\nof his peers--this, he had often told himself, was the sole arbitrage he\ncould submit to; but then, who was to be on the bench? Peerless, he was\nirresponsible--the captain of his soul, the despot of his future. No\ninjunction but from himself would he bow to; and his own injunctions--so\nlittle Danish was he--had always been peremptory and lucid. Lucid and\nperemptory, now, the command he issued to himself.\n\n\"So sorry to have been so long,\" carolled a voice from above. The Duke\nlooked up. \"I'm all but ready,\" said Zuleika at her window.\n\nThat brief apparition changed the colour of his resolve. He realised\nthat to die for love of this lady would be no mere measure of\nprecaution, or counsel of despair. It would be in itself a passionate\nindulgence--a fiery rapture, not to be foregone. What better could\nhe ask than to die for his love? Poor indeed seemed to him now\nthe sacrament of marriage beside the sacrament of death. Death was\nincomparably the greater, the finer soul. Death was the one true bridal.\n\nHe flung back his head, spread wide his arms, quickened his pace almost\nto running speed. Ah, he would win his bride before the setting of the\nsun. He knew not by what means he would win her. Enough that even now,\nfull-hearted, fleet-footed, he was on his way to her, and that she heard\nhim coming.\n\nWhen Zuleika, a vision in vaporous white, came out through the postern,\nshe wondered why he was walking at so remarkable a pace. To him, wildly\nexpressing in his movement the thought within him, she appeared as his\nawful bride. With a cry of joy, he bounded towards her, and would have\ncaught her in his arms, had she not stepped nimbly aside.\n\n\"Forgive me!\" he said, after a pause. \"It was a mistake--an idiotic\nmistake of identity. I thought you were...\"\n\nZuleika, rigid, asked \"Have I many doubles?\"\n\n\"You know well that in all the world is none so blest as to be like you.\nI can only say that I was over-wrought. I can only say that it shall not\noccur again.\"\n\nShe was very angry indeed. Of his penitence there could be no doubt. But\nthere are outrages for which no penitence can atone. This seemed to be\none of them. Her first impulse was to dismiss the Duke forthwith and for\never. But she wanted to show herself at the races. And she could not go\nalone. And except the Duke there was no one to take her. True, there was\nthe concert to-night; and she could show herself there to advantage; but\nshe wanted ALL Oxford to see her--see her NOW.\n\n\"I am forgiven?\" he asked. In her, I am afraid, self-respect outweighed\ncharity. \"I will try,\" she said merely, \"to forget what you have done.\"\nMotioning him to her side, she opened her parasol, and signified her\nreadiness to start.\n\nThey passed together across the vast gravelled expanse of the Front\nQuadrangle. In the porch of the College there were, as usual, some\nchained-up dogs, patiently awaiting their masters. Zuleika, of course,\ndid not care for dogs. One has never known a good man to whom dogs were\nnot dear; but many of the best women have no such fondness. You will\nfind that the woman who is really kind to dogs is always one who has\nfailed to inspire sympathy in men. For the attractive woman, dogs are\nmere dumb and restless brutes--possibly dangerous, certainly soulless.\nYet will coquetry teach her to caress any dog in the presence of a\nman enslaved by her. Even Zuleika, it seems, was not above this rather\nobvious device for awaking envy. Be sure she did not at all like the\nlook of the very big bulldog who was squatting outside the porter's\nlodge. Perhaps, but for her present anger, she would not have stooped\nendearingly down to him, as she did, cooing over him and trying to pat\nhis head. Alas, her pretty act was a failure. The bulldog cowered away\nfrom her, horrifically grimacing. This was strange. Like the majority\nof his breed, Corker (for such was his name) had ever been wistful to\nbe noticed by any one--effusively grateful for every word or pat, an\never-ready wagger and nuzzler, to none ineffable. No beggar, no burglar,\nhad ever been rebuffed by this catholic beast. But he drew the line at\nZuleika.\n\nSeldom is even a fierce bulldog heard to growl. Yet Corker growled at\nZuleika.\n\n\n\n\nVII\n\nThe Duke did not try to break the stony silence in which Zuleika walked.\nHer displeasure was a luxury to him, for it was so soon to be dispelled.\nA little while, and she would be hating herself for her pettiness. Here\nwas he, going to die for her; and here was she, blaming him for a breach\nof manners. Decidedly, the slave had the whip-hand. He stole a sidelong\nlook at her, and could not repress a smile. His features quickly\ncomposed themselves. The Triumph of Death must not be handled as a\ncheap score. He wanted to die because he would thereby so poignantly\nconsummate his love, express it so completely, once and for all...\nAnd she--who could say that she, knowing what he had done, might not,\nillogically, come to love him? Perhaps she would devote her life to\nmourning him. He saw her bending over his tomb, in beautiful humble\ncurves, under a starless sky, watering the violets with her tears.\n\nShades of Novalis and Friedrich Schlegel and other despicable\nmaunderers! He brushed them aside. He would be practical. The point was,\nwhen and how to die? Time: the sooner the better. Manner:.. less easy to\ndetermine. He must not die horribly, nor without dignity. The manner of\nthe Roman philosophers? But the only kind of bath which an undergraduate\ncan command is a hip-bath. Stay! there was the river. Drowning (he had\noften heard) was a rather pleasant sensation. And to the river he was\neven now on his way.\n\nIt troubled him that he could swim. Twice, indeed, from his yacht,\nhe had swum the Hellespont. And how about the animal instinct of\nself-preservation, strong even in despair? No matter! His soul's set\npurpose would subdue that. The law of gravitation that brings one to the\nsurface? There his very skill in swimming would help him. He would swim\nunder water, along the river-bed, swim till he found weeds to cling to,\nweird strong weeds that he would coil round him, exulting faintly...\n\nAs they turned into Radcliffe Square, the Duke's ear caught the sound of\na far-distant gun. He started, and looked up at the clock of St. Mary's.\nHalf-past four! The boats had started.\n\nHe had heard that whenever a woman was to blame for a disappointment,\nthe best way to avoid a scene was to inculpate oneself. He did not\nwish Zuleika to store up yet more material for penitence. And so \"I am\nsorry,\" he said. \"That gun--did you hear it? It was the signal for the\nrace. I shall never forgive myself.\"\n\n\"Then we shan't see the race at all?\" cried Zuleika.\n\n\"It will be over, alas, before we are near the river. All the people\nwill be coming back through the meadows.\"\n\n\"Let us meet them.\"\n\n\"Meet a torrent? Let us have tea in my rooms and go down quietly for the\nother Division.\"\n\n\"Let us go straight on.\"\n\nThrough the square, across the High, down Grove Street, they passed.\nThe Duke looked up at the tower of Merton, \"os oupot authis alla nyn\npaunstaton.\" Strange that to-night it would still be standing here,\nin all its sober and solid beauty--still be gazing, over the roofs and\nchimneys, at the tower of Magdalen, its rightful bride. Through untold\ncenturies of the future it would stand thus, gaze thus. He winced.\nOxford walls have a way of belittling us; and the Duke was loth to\nregard his doom as trivial.\n\nAye, by all minerals we are mocked. Vegetables, yearly deciduous, are\nfar more sympathetic. The lilac and laburnum, making lovely now the\nrailed pathway to Christ Church meadow, were all a-swaying and a-nodding\nto the Duke as he passed by. \"Adieu, adieu, your Grace,\" they were\nwhispering. \"We are very sorry for you--very sorry indeed. We never\ndared suppose you would predecease us. We think your death a very great\ntragedy. Adieu! Perhaps we shall meet in another world--that is, if the\nmembers of the animal kingdom have immortal souls, as we have.\"\n\nThe Duke was little versed in their language; yet, as he passed between\nthese gently garrulous blooms, he caught at least the drift of their\nsalutation, and smiled a vague but courteous acknowledgment, to the\nright and the left alternately, creating a very favourable impression.\n\nNo doubt, the young elms lining the straight way to the barges had seen\nhim coming; but any whispers of their leaves were lost in the murmur of\nthe crowd returning from the race. Here, at length, came the torrent\nof which the Duke had spoken; and Zuleika's heart rose at it. Here was\nOxford! From side to side the avenue was filled with a dense procession\nof youths--youths interspersed with maidens whose parasols were as\nflotsam and jetsam on a seething current of straw hats. Zuleika neither\nquickened nor slackened her advance. But brightlier and brightlier shone\nher eyes.\n\nThe vanguard of the procession was pausing now, swaying, breaking at\nsight of her. She passed, imperial, through the way cloven for her. All\na-down the avenue, the throng parted as though some great invisible\ncomb were being drawn through it. The few youths who had already\nseen Zuleika, and by whom her beauty had been bruited throughout the\nUniversity, were lost in a new wonder, so incomparably fairer was she\nthan the remembered vision. And the rest hardly recognised her from the\ndescriptions, so incomparably fairer was the reality than the hope.\n\nShe passed among them. None questioned the worthiness of her escort.\nCould I give you better proof the awe in which our Duke was held? Any\nman is glad to be seen escorting a very pretty woman. He thinks it adds\nto his prestige. Whereas, in point of fact, his fellow-men are saying\nmerely \"Who's that appalling fellow with her?\" or \"Why does she go about\nwith that ass So-and-So?\" Such cavil may in part be envy. But it is a\nfact that no man, howsoever graced, can shine in juxtaposition to a very\npretty woman. The Duke himself cut a poor figure beside Zuleika. Yet not\none of all the undergraduates felt she could have made a wiser choice.\n\nShe swept among them. Her own intrinsic radiance was not all that\nflashed from her. She was a moving reflector and refractor of all the\nrays of all the eyes that mankind had turned on her. Her mien told the\nstory of her days. Bright eyes, light feet--she trod erect from a vista\nwhose glare was dazzling to all beholders. She swept among them, a\nmiracle, overwhelming, breath-bereaving. Nothing at all like her had\never been seen in Oxford.\n\nMainly architectural, the beauties of Oxford. True, the place is no\nlonger one-sexed. There are the virguncules of Somerville and Lady\nMargaret's Hall; but beauty and the lust for learning have yet to be\nallied. There are the innumerable wives and daughters around the Parks,\nrunning in and out of their little red-brick villas; but the indignant\nshade of celibacy seems to have called down on the dons a Nemesis which\nprecludes them from either marrying beauty or begetting it. (From the\nWarden's son, that unhappy curate, Zuleika inherited no tittle of\nher charm. Some of it, there is no doubt, she did inherit from the\ncircus-rider who was her mother.)\n\nBut the casual feminine visitors? Well, the sisters and cousins of an\nundergraduate seldom seem more passable to his comrades than to himself.\nAltogether, the instinct of sex is not pandered to in Oxford. It is not,\nhowever, as it may once have been, dormant. The modern importation of\nsamples of femininity serves to keep it alert, though not to gratify it.\nA like result is achieved by another modern development--photography.\nThe undergraduate may, and usually does, surround himself with\nphotographs of pretty ladies known to the public. A phantom harem! Yet\nthe houris have an effect on their sultan. Surrounded both by plain\nwomen of flesh and blood and by beauteous women on pasteboard, the\nundergraduate is the easiest victim of living loveliness--is as a fire\never well and truly laid, amenable to a spark. And if the spark be such\na flaring torch as Zuleika?--marvel not, reader, at the conflagration.\n\nNot only was the whole throng of youths drawing asunder before her:\nmuch of it, as she passed, was forming up in her wake. Thus, with the\nconfluence of two masses--one coming away from the river, the other\nreturning to it--chaos seethed around her and the Duke before they were\nhalf-way along the avenue. Behind them, and on either side of them, the\npeople were crushed inextricably together, swaying and surging this way\nand that. \"Help!\" cried many a shrill feminine voice. \"Don't push!\" \"Let\nme out!\" \"You brute!\" \"Save me, save me!\" Many ladies fainted, whilst\ntheir escorts, supporting them and protecting them as best they could,\npeered over the heads of their fellows for one glimpse of the divine\nMiss Dobson. Yet for her and the Duke, in the midst of the terrific\ncompress, there was space enough. In front of them, as by a miracle\nof deference, a way still cleared itself. They reached the end of the\navenue without a pause in their measured progress. Nor even when they\nturned to the left, along the rather narrow path beside the barges, was\nthere any obstacle to their advance. Passing evenly forward, they alone\nwere cool, unhustled, undishevelled.\n\nThe Duke was so rapt in his private thoughts that he was hardly\nconscious of the strange scene. And as for Zuleika, she, as well she\nmight be, was in the very best of good humours.\n\n\"What a lot of house-boats!\" she exclaimed. \"Are you going to take me on\nto one of them?\"\n\nThe Duke started. Already they were alongside the Judas barge. \"Here,\"\nhe said, \"is our goal.\"\n\nHe stepped through the gate of the railings, out upon the plank, and\noffered her his hand.\n\nShe looked back. The young men in the vanguard were crushing their\nshoulders against the row behind them, to stay the oncoming host. She\nhad half a mind to go back through the midst of them; but she really did\nwant her tea, and she followed the Duke on to the barge, and under his\nauspices climbed the steps to the roof.\n\nIt looked very cool and gay, this roof, under its awning of red and\nwhite stripes. Nests of red and white flowers depended along either side\nof it. Zuleika moved to the side which commanded a view of the bank. She\nleaned her arms on the balustrade, and gazed down.\n\nThe crowd stretched as far as she could see--a vista of faces upturned\nto her. Suddenly it hove forward. Its vanguard was swept irresistibly\npast the barge--swept by the desire of the rest to see her at closer\nquarters. Such was the impetus that the vision for each man was but\na lightning-flash: he was whirled past, struggling, almost before his\nbrain took the message of his eyes.\n\nThose who were Judas men made frantic efforts to board the barge, trying\nto hurl themselves through the gate in the railings; but they were swept\nvainly on.\n\nPresently the torrent began to slacken, became a mere river, a mere\nprocession of youths staring up rather shyly.\n\nBefore the last stragglers had marched by, Zuleika moved away to the\nother side of the roof, and, after a glance at the sunlit river,\nsank into one of the wicker chairs, and asked the Duke to look less\ndisagreeable and to give her some tea.\n\nAmong others hovering near the little buffet were the two youths whose\nparley with the Duke I have recorded.\n\nZuleika was aware of the special persistence of their gaze. When the\nDuke came back with her cup, she asked him who they were. He replied,\ntruthfully enough, that their names were unknown to him.\n\n\"Then,\" she said, \"ask them their names, and introduce them to me.\"\n\n\"No,\" said the Duke, sinking into the chair beside her. \"That I shall\nnot do. I am your victim: not your pander. Those two men stand on the\nthreshold of a possibly useful and agreeable career. I am not going to\ntrip them up for you.\"\n\n\"I am not sure,\" said Zuleika, \"that you are very polite. Certainly you\nare foolish. It is natural for boys to fall in love. If these two are\nin love with me, why not let them talk to me? It were an experience on\nwhich they would always look back with romantic pleasure. They may never\nsee me again. Why grudge them this little thing?\" She sipped her tea.\n\"As for tripping them up on a threshold--that is all nonsense. What harm\nhas unrequited love ever done to anybody?\" She laughed. \"Look at ME!\nWhen I came to your rooms this morning, thinking I loved in vain, did I\nseem one jot the worse for it? Did I look different?\"\n\n\"You looked, I am bound to say, nobler, more spiritual.\"\n\n\"More spiritual?\" she exclaimed. \"Do you mean I looked tired or ill?\"\n\n\"No, you seemed quite fresh. But then, you are singular. You are no\ncriterion.\"\n\n\"You mean you can't judge those two young men by me? Well, I am only a\nwoman, of course. I have heard of women, no longer young, wasting away\nbecause no man loved them. I have often heard of a young woman fretting\nbecause some particular young man didn't love her. But I never heard of\nher wasting away. Certainly a young man doesn't waste away for love of\nsome particular young woman. He very soon makes love to some other one.\nIf his be an ardent nature, the quicker his transition. All the most\nardent of my past adorers have married. Will you put my cup down,\nplease?\"\n\n\"Past?\" echoed the Duke, as he placed her cup on the floor. \"Have any of\nyour lovers ceased to love you?\"\n\n\"Ah no, no; not in retrospect. I remain their ideal, and all that, of\ncourse. They cherish the thought of me. They see the world in terms of\nme. But I am an inspiration, not an obsession; a glow, not a blight.\"\n\n\"You don't believe in the love that corrodes, the love that ruins?\"\n\n\"No,\" laughed Zuleika.\n\n\"You have never dipped into the Greek pastoral poets, nor sampled the\nElizabethan sonneteers?\"\n\n\"No, never. You will think me lamentably crude: my experience of life\nhas been drawn from life itself.\"\n\n\"Yet often you talk as though you had read rather much. Your way of\nspeech has what is called 'the literary flavour'.\"\n\n\"Ah, that is an unfortunate trick which I caught from a writer, a Mr.\nBeerbohm, who once sat next to me at dinner somewhere. I can't break\nmyself of it. I assure you I hardly ever open a book. Of life, though,\nmy experience has been very wide. Brief? But I suppose the soul of man\nduring the past two or three years has been much as it was in the reign\nof Queen Elizabeth and of--whoever it was that reigned over the Greek\npastures. And I daresay the modern poets are making the same old silly\ndistortions. But forgive me,\" she added gently, \"perhaps you yourself\nare a poet?\"\n\n\"Only since yesterday,\" answered the Duke (not less unfairly to himself\nthan to Roger Newdigate and Thomas Gaisford). And he felt he was\nespecially a dramatic poet. All the while that she had been sitting by\nhim here, talking so glibly, looking so straight into his eyes, flashing\nat him so many pretty gestures, it was the sense of tragic irony\nthat prevailed in him--that sense which had stirred in him, and been\nrepressed, on the way from Judas. He knew that she was making her effect\nconsciously for the other young men by whom the roof of the barge was\nnow thronged. Him alone she seemed to observe. By her manner, she might\nhave seemed to be making love to him. He envied the men she was so\ndeliberately making envious--the men whom, in her undertone to him, she\nwas really addressing. But he did take comfort in the irony. Though she\nused him as a stalking-horse, he, after all, was playing with her as a\ncat plays with a mouse. While she chattered on, without an inkling that\nhe was no ordinary lover, and coaxing him to present two quite ordinary\nyoung men to her, he held over her the revelation that he for love of\nher was about to die.\n\nAnd, while he drank in the radiance of her beauty, he heard her\nchattering on. \"So you see,\" she was saying, \"it couldn't do those young\nmen any harm. Suppose unrequited love IS anguish: isn't the discipline\nwholesome? Suppose I AM a sort of furnace: shan't I purge, refine,\ntemper? Those two boys are but scorched from here. That is horrid; and\nwhat good will it do them?\" She laid a hand on his arm. \"Cast them into\nthe furnace for their own sake, dear Duke! Or cast one of them, or,\" she\nadded, glancing round at the throng, \"any one of these others!\"\n\n\"For their own sake?\" he echoed, withdrawing his arm. \"If you were not,\nas the whole world knows you to be, perfectly respectable, there might\nbe something in what you say. But as it is, you can but be an engine for\nmischief; and your sophistries leave me unmoved. I shall certainly keep\nyou to myself.\"\n\n\"I hate you,\" said Zuleika, with an ugly petulance that crowned the\nirony.\n\n\"So long as I live,\" uttered the Duke, in a level voice, \"you will\naddress no man but me.\"\n\n\"If your prophecy is to be fulfilled,\" laughed Zuleika, rising from her\nchair, \"your last moment is at hand.\"\n\n\"It is,\" he answered, rising too.\n\n\"What do you mean?\" she asked, awed by something in his tone.\n\n\"I mean what I say: that my last moment is at hand.\" He withdrew\nhis eyes from hers, and, leaning his elbows on the balustrade, gazed\nthoughtfully at the river. \"When I am dead,\" he added, over his\nshoulder, \"you will find these fellows rather coy of your advances.\"\n\nFor the first time since his avowal of his love for her, Zuleika found\nherself genuinely interested in him. A suspicion of his meaning had\nflashed through her soul.--But no! surely he could not mean THAT! It\nmust have been a metaphor merely. And yet, something in his eyes... She\nleaned beside him. Her shoulder touched his. She gazed questioningly at\nhim. He did not turn his face to her. He gazed at the sunlit river.\n\nThe Judas Eight had just embarked for their voyage to the\nstarting-point. Standing on the edge of the raft that makes a floating\nplatform for the barge, William, the hoary bargee, was pushing them off\nwith his boat-hook, wishing them luck with deferential familiarity.\nThe raft was thronged with Old Judasians--mostly clergymen--who were\nshouting hearty hortations, and evidently trying not to appear so old\nas they felt--or rather, not to appear so startlingly old as their\ncontemporaries looked to them. It occurred to the Duke as a strange\nthing, and a thing to be glad of, that he, in this world, would never be\nan Old Judasian. Zuleika's shoulder pressed his. He thrilled not at all.\nTo all intents, he was dead already.\n\nThe enormous eight young men in the thread-like skiff--the skiff that\nwould scarce have seemed an adequate vehicle for the tiny \"cox\" who sat\nfacing them--were staring up at Zuleika with that uniformity of impulse\nwhich, in another direction, had enabled them to bump a boat on two of\nthe previous \"nights.\" If to-night they bumped the next boat, Univ.,\nthen would Judas be three places \"up\" on the river; and to-morrow Judas\nwould have a Bump Supper. Furthermore, if Univ. were bumped to-night,\nMagdalen might be bumped to-morrow. Then would Judas, for the first\ntime in history, be head of the river. Oh tremulous hope! Yet, for\nthe moment, these eight young men seemed to have forgotten the awful\nresponsibility that rested on their over-developed shoulders. Their\nhearts, already strained by rowing, had been transfixed this afternoon\nby Eros' darts. All of them had seen Zuleika as she came down to the\nriver; and now they sat gaping up at her, fumbling with their oars. The\ntiny cox gaped too; but he it was who first recalled duty. With piping\nadjurations he brought the giants back to their senses. The boat moved\naway down stream, with a fairly steady stroke.\n\nNot in a day can the traditions of Oxford be sent spinning. From all the\nbarges the usual punt-loads of young men were being ferried across\nto the towing-path--young men naked of knee, armed with rattles,\npost-horns, motor-hooters, gongs, and other instruments of clangour.\nThough Zuleika filled their thoughts, they hurried along the\ntowing-path, as by custom, to the starting-point.\n\nShe, meanwhile, had not taken her eyes off the Duke's profile. Nor\nhad she dared, for fear of disappointment, to ask him just what he had\nmeant.\n\n\"All these men,\" he repeated dreamily, \"will be coy of your advances.\"\nIt seemed to him a good thing that his death, his awful example, would\ndisinfatuate his fellow alumni. He had never been conscious of\npublic spirit. He had lived for himself alone. Love had come to him\nyesternight, and to-day had waked in him a sympathy with mankind. It\nwas a fine thing to be a saviour. It was splendid to be human. He looked\nquickly round to her who had wrought this change in him.\n\nBut the loveliest face in all the world will not please you if you see\nit suddenly, eye to eye, at a distance of half an inch from your own.\nIt was thus that the Duke saw Zuleika's: a monstrous deliquium a-glare.\nOnly for the fraction of an instant, though. Recoiling, he beheld the\nloveliness that he knew--more adorably vivid now in its look of eager\nquestioning. And in his every fibre he thrilled to her. Even so had she\ngazed at him last night, this morning. Aye, now as then, her soul was\nfull of him. He had recaptured, not her love, but his power to please\nher. It was enough. He bowed his head; and \"Moriturus te saluto\" were\nthe words formed silently by his lips. He was glad that his death would\nbe a public service to the University. But the salutary lesson of\nwhat the newspapers would call his \"rash act\" was, after all, only a\nside-issue. The great thing, the prospect that flushed his cheek, was\nthe consummation of his own love, for its own sake, by his own death.\nAnd, as he met her gaze, the question that had already flitted through\nhis brain found a faltering utterance; and \"Shall you mourn me?\" he\nasked her.\n\nBut she would have no ellipses. \"What are you going to do?\" she\nwhispered.\n\n\"Do you not know?\"\n\n\"Tell me.\"\n\n\"Once and for all: you cannot love me?\"\n\nSlowly she shook her head. The black pearl and the pink, quivering, gave\nstress to her ultimatum. But the violet of her eyes was all but hidden\nby the dilation of her pupils.\n\n\"Then,\" whispered the Duke, \"when I shall have died, deeming life a vain\nthing without you, will the gods give you tears for me? Miss Dobson,\nwill your soul awaken? When I shall have sunk for ever beneath these\nwaters whose supposed purpose here this afternoon is but that they be\nploughed by the blades of these young oarsmen, will there be struck from\nthat flint, your heart, some late and momentary spark of pity for me?\"\n\n\"Why of course, of COURSE!\" babbled Zuleika, with clasped hands and\ndazzling eyes. \"But,\" she curbed herself, \"it is--it would--oh, you\nmustn't THINK of it! I couldn't allow it! I--I should never forgive\nmyself!\"\n\n\"In fact, you would mourn me always?\"\n\n\"Why yes!.. Y-es-always.\" What else could she say? But would his answer\nbe that he dared not condemn her to lifelong torment?\n\n\"Then,\" his answer was, \"my joy in dying for you is made perfect.\"\n\nHer muscles relaxed. Her breath escaped between her teeth. \"You are\nutterly resolved?\" she asked. \"Are you?\"\n\n\"Utterly.\"\n\n\"Nothing I might say could change your purpose?\"\n\n\"Nothing.\"\n\n\"No entreaty, howsoever piteous, could move you?\"\n\n\"None.\"\n\nForthwith she urged, entreated, cajoled, commanded, with infinite\nprettiness of ingenuity and of eloquence. Never was such a cascade of\ndissuasion as hers. She only didn't say she could love him. She never\nhinted that. Indeed, throughout her pleading rang this recurrent motif:\nthat he must live to take to himself as mate some good, serious, clever\nwoman who would be a not unworthy mother of his children.\n\nShe laid stress on his youth, his great position, his brilliant\nattainments, the much he had already achieved, the splendid\npossibilities of his future. Though of course she spoke in undertones,\nnot to be overheard by the throng on the barge, it was almost as though\nhis health were being floridly proposed at some public banquet--say,\nat a Tenants' Dinner. Insomuch that, when she ceased, the Duke half\nexpected Jellings, his steward, to bob up uttering, with lifted hands, a\nstentorian \"For-or,\" and all the company to take up the chant: \"he's--a\njolly good fellow.\" His brief reply, on those occasions, seemed always\nto indicate that, whatever else he might be, a jolly good fellow he was\nnot. But by Zuleika's eulogy he really was touched. \"Thank you--thank\nyou,\" he gasped; and there were tears in his eyes. Dear the thought that\nshe so revered him, so wished him not to die. But this was no more than\na rush-light in the austere radiance of his joy in dying for her.\n\nAnd the time was come. Now for the sacrament of his immersion in\ninfinity.\n\n\"Good-bye,\" he said simply, and was about to swing himself on to the\nledge of the balustrade. Zuleika, divining his intention, made way for\nhim. Her bosom heaved quickly, quickly. All colour had left her face;\nbut her eyes shone as never before.\n\nAlready his foot was on the ledge, when hark! the sound of a distant\ngun. To Zuleika, with all the chords of her soul strung to the utmost\ntensity, the effect was as if she herself had been shot; and she\nclutched at the Duke's arm, like a frightened child. He laughed. \"It was\nthe signal for the race,\" he said, and laughed again, rather bitterly,\nat the crude and trivial interruption of high matters.\n\n\"The race?\" She laughed hysterically.\n\n\"Yes. 'They're off'.\" He mingled his laughter with hers, gently seeking\nto disengage his arm. \"And perhaps,\" he said, \"I, clinging to the weeds\nof the river's bed, shall see dimly the boats and the oars pass over me,\nand shall be able to gurgle a cheer for Judas.\"\n\n\"Don't!\" she shuddered, with a woman's notion that a jest means levity.\nA tumult of thoughts surged in her, all confused. She only knew that\nhe must not die--not yet! A moment ago, his death would have been\nbeautiful. Not now! Her grip of his arm tightened. Only by breaking her\nwrist could he have freed himself. A moment ago, she had been in the\nseventh-heaven... Men were supposed to have died for love of her. It\nhad never been proved. There had always been something--card-debts,\nill-health, what not--to account for the tragedy. No man, to the best\nof her recollection, had ever hinted that he was going to die for her.\nNever, assuredly, had she seen the deed done. And then came he, the\nfirst man she had loved, going to die here, before her eyes, because she\nno longer loved him. But she knew now that he must not die--not yet!\n\nAll around her was the hush that falls on Oxford when the signal for the\nrace has sounded. In the distance could be heard faintly the noise of\ncheering--a little sing-song sound, drawing nearer.\n\nAh, how could she have thought of letting him die so soon? She gazed\ninto his face--the face she might never have seen again. Even now, but\nfor that gun-shot, the waters would have closed over him, and his soul,\nmaybe, have passed away. She had saved him, thank heaven! She had him\nstill with her.\n\nGently, vainly, he still sought to unclasp her fingers from his arm.\n\n\"Not now!\" she whispered. \"Not yet!\"\n\nAnd the noise of the cheering, and of the trumpeting and rattling, as\nit drew near, was an accompaniment to her joy in having saved her lover.\nShe would keep him with her--for a while! Let all be done in order. She\nwould savour the full sweetness of his sacrifice. Tomorrow--to-morrow,\nyes, let him have his heart's desire of death. Not now! Not yet!\n\n\"To-morrow,\" she whispered, \"to-morrow, if you will. Not yet!\"\n\nThe first boat came jerking past in mid-stream; and the towing-path,\nwith its serried throng of runners, was like a live thing, keeping pace.\nAs in a dream, Zuleika saw it. And the din was in her ears. No heroine\nof Wagner had ever a louder accompaniment than had ours to the surging\nsoul within her bosom.\n\nAnd the Duke, tightly held by her, vibrated as to a powerful electric\ncurrent. He let her cling to him, and her magnetism range through him.\nAh, it was good not to have died! Fool, he had meant to drain off-hand,\nat one coarse draught, the delicate wine of death. He would let his lips\ncaress the brim of the august goblet. He would dally with the aroma that\nwas there.\n\n\"So be it!\" he cried into Zuleika's ear--cried loudly, for it seemed as\nthough all the Wagnerian orchestras of Europe, with the Straussian ones\nthrown in, were here to clash in unison the full volume of right music\nfor the glory of the reprieve.\n\nThe fact was that the Judas boat had just bumped Univ., exactly opposite\nthe Judas barge. The oarsmen in either boat sat humped, panting, some of\nthem rocking and writhing, after their wholesome exercise. But there\nwas not one of them whose eyes were not upcast at Zuleika. And the\nvocalisation and instrumentation of the dancers and stampers on the\ntowing-path had by this time ceased to mean aught of joy in the victors\nor of comfort for the vanquished, and had resolved itself into a wild\nwordless hymn to the glory of Miss Dobson. Behind her and all around her\non the roof of the barge, young Judasians were venting in like manner\ntheir hearts through their lungs. She paid no heed. It was as if she\nstood alone with her lover on some silent pinnacle of the world. It was\nas if she were a little girl with a brand-new and very expensive doll\nwhich had banished all the little other old toys from her mind.\n\nShe simply could not, in her naive rapture, take her eyes off her\ncompanion. To the dancers and stampers of the towing-path, many of whom\nwere now being ferried back across the river, and to the other youths\non the roof of the barge, Zuleika's air of absorption must have seemed\na little strange. For already the news that the Duke loved Zuleika, and\nthat she loved him not, and would stoop to no man who loved her, had\nspread like wild-fire among the undergraduates. The two youths in whom\nthe Duke had deigned to confide had not held their peace. And the effect\nthat Zuleika had made as she came down to the river was intensified by\nthe knowledge that not the great paragon himself did she deem worthy of\nher. The mere sight of her had captured young Oxford. The news of her\nsupernal haughtiness had riveted the chains.\n\n\"Come!\" said the Duke at length, staring around him with the eyes of one\nawakened from a dream. \"Come! I must take you back to Judas.\"\n\n\"But you won't leave me there?\" pleaded Zuleika. \"You will stay to\ndinner? I am sure my grandfather would be delighted.\"\n\n\"I am sure he would,\" said the Duke, as he piloted her down the steps of\nthe barge. \"But alas, I have to dine at the Junta to-night.\"\n\n\"The Junta? What is that?\"\n\n\"A little dining-club. It meets every Tuesday.\"\n\n\"But--you don't mean you are going to refuse me for that?\"\n\n\"To do so is misery. But I have no choice. I have asked a guest.\"\n\n\"Then ask another: ask me!\" Zuleika's notions of Oxford life were rather\nhazy. It was with difficulty that the Duke made her realise that he\ncould not--not even if, as she suggested, she dressed herself up as a\nman--invite her to the Junta. She then fell back on the impossibility\nthat he would not dine with her to-night, his last night in this world.\nShe could not understand that admirable fidelity to social engagements\nwhich is one of the virtues implanted in the members of our aristocracy.\nBohemian by training and by career, she construed the Duke's refusal as\neither a cruel slight to herself or an act of imbecility. The thought of\nbeing parted from her for one moment was torture to him; but \"noblesse\noblige,\" and it was quite impossible for him to break an engagement\nmerely because a more charming one offered itself: he would as soon have\ncheated at cards.\n\nAnd so, as they went side by side up the avenue, in the mellow light\nof the westering sun, preceded in their course, and pursued, and\nsurrounded, by the mob of hoarse infatuate youths, Zuleika's face was\nas that of a little girl sulking. Vainly the Duke reasoned with her. She\ncould NOT see the point of view.\n\nWith that sudden softening that comes to the face of an angry woman who\nhas hit on a good argument, she turned to him and asked \"How if I hadn't\nsaved your life just now? Much you thought about your guest when you\nwere going to dive and die!\"\n\n\"I did not forget him,\" answered the Duke, smiling at her casuistry.\n\"Nor had I any scruple in disappointing him. Death cancels all\nengagements.\"\n\nAnd Zuleika, worsted, resumed her sulking. But presently, as they neared\nJudas, she relented. It was paltry to be cross with him who had resolved\nto die for her and was going to die so on the morrow. And after all, she\nwould see him at the concert to-night. They would sit together. And all\nto-morrow they would be together, till the time came for parting. Hers\nwas a naturally sunny disposition. And the evening was such a lovely\none, all bathed in gold. She was ashamed of her ill-humour.\n\n\"Forgive me,\" she said, touching his arm. \"Forgive me for being horrid.\"\nAnd forgiven she promptly was. \"And promise you will spend all to-morrow\nwith me.\" And of course he promised.\n\nAs they stood together on the steps of the Warden's front-door, exalted\nabove the level of the flushed and swaying crowd that filled the whole\nlength and breadth of Judas Street, she implored him not to be late for\nthe concert.\n\n\"I am never late,\" he smiled.\n\n\"Ah, you're so beautifully brought up!\"\n\nThe door was opened.\n\n\"And--oh, you're beautiful besides!\" she whispered; and waved her hand\nto him as she vanished into the hall.\n\n\n\n\nVIII\n\nA few minutes before half-past seven, the Duke, arrayed for dinner,\npassed leisurely up the High. The arresting feature of his costume was\na mulberry-coloured coat, with brass buttons. This, to any one versed in\nOxford lore, betokened him a member of the Junta. It is awful to think\nthat a casual stranger might have mistaken him for a footman. It does\nnot do to think of such things.\n\nThe tradesmen, at the doors of their shops, bowed low as he passed,\nrubbing their hands and smiling, hoping inwardly that they took no\nliberty in sharing the cool rosy air of the evening with his Grace. They\nnoted that he wore in his shirt-front a black pearl and a pink. \"Daring,\nbut becoming,\" they opined.\n\nThe rooms of the Junta were over a stationer's shop, next door but one\nto the Mitre. They were small rooms; but as the Junta had now, besides\nthe Duke, only two members, and as no member might introduce more than\none guest, there was ample space.\n\nThe Duke had been elected in his second term. At that time there were\nfour members; but these were all leaving Oxford at the end of the summer\nterm, and there seemed to be in the ranks of the Bullingdon and the\nLoder no one quite eligible for the Junta, that holy of holies. Thus it\nwas that the Duke inaugurated in solitude his second year of membership.\nFrom time to time, he proposed and seconded a few candidates, after\n\"sounding\" them as to whether they were willing to join. But always,\nwhen election evening--the last Tuesday of term--drew near, he began to\nhave his doubts about these fellows. This one was \"rowdy\"; that one\nwas over-dressed; another did not ride quite straight to hounds; in the\npedigree of another a bar-sinister was more than suspected. Election\nevening was always a rather melancholy time. After dinner, when the two\nclub servants had placed on the mahogany the time-worn Candidates' Book\nand the ballot-box, and had noiselessly withdrawn, the Duke, clearing\nhis throat, read aloud to himself \"Mr. So-and-So, of Such-and-Such\nCollege, proposed by the Duke of Dorset, seconded by the Duke of\nDorset,\" and, in every case, when he drew out the drawer of the\nballot-box, found it was a black-ball that he had dropped into the urn.\nThus it was that at the end of the summer term the annual photographic\n\"group\" taken by Messrs. Hills and Saunders was a presentment of the\nDuke alone.\n\nIn the course of his third year he had become less exclusive. Not\nbecause there seemed to be any one really worthy of the Junta; but\nbecause the Junta, having thriven since the eighteenth century, must\nnot die. Suppose--one never knew--he were struck by lightning, the Junta\nwould be no more. So, not without reluctance, but unanimously, he had\nelected The MacQuern, of Balliol, and Sir John Marraby, of Brasenose.\n\nTo-night, as he, a doomed man, went up into the familiar rooms, he was\nwholly glad that he had thus relented. As yet, he was spared the tragic\nknowledge that it would make no difference.*\n\n   * The Junta has been reconstituted. But the apostolic line was\n     broken, the thread was snapped; the old magic is fled.\n\nThe MacQuern and two other young men were already there.\n\n\"Mr. President,\" said The MacQuern, \"I present Mr. Trent-Garby, of\nChrist Church.\"\n\n\"The Junta is honoured,\" said the Duke, bowing.\n\nSuch was the ritual of the club.\n\nThe other young man, because his host, Sir John Marraby, was not yet on\nthe scene, had no locus standi, and, though a friend of The MacQuern,\nand well known to the Duke, had to be ignored.\n\nA moment later, Sir John arrived. \"Mr. President,\" he said, \"I present\nLord Sayes, of Magdalen.\"\n\n\"The Junta is honoured,\" said the Duke, bowing.\n\nBoth hosts and both guests, having been prominent in the throng that\nvociferated around Zuleika an hour earlier, were slightly abashed in\nthe Duke's presence. He, however, had not noticed any one in particular,\nand, even if he had, that fine tradition of the club--\"A member of the\nJunta can do no wrong; a guest of the Junta cannot err\"--would have\nprevented him from showing his displeasure.\n\nA Herculean figure filled the doorway.\n\n\"The Junta is honoured,\" said the Duke, bowing to his guest.\n\n\"Duke,\" said the newcomer quietly, \"the honour is as much mine as\nthat of the interesting and ancient institution which I am this night\nprivileged to inspect.\"\n\nTurning to Sir John and The MacQuern, the Duke said \"I present Mr.\nAbimelech V. Oover, of Trinity.\"\n\n\"The Junta,\" they replied, \"is honoured.\"\n\n\"Gentlemen,\" said the Rhodes Scholar, \"your good courtesy is just such\nas I would have anticipated from members of the ancient Junta. Like most\nof my countrymen, I am a man of few words. We are habituated out there\nto act rather than talk. Judged from the view-point of your beautiful\nold civilisation, I am aware my curtness must seem crude. But,\ngentlemen, believe me, right here--\"\n\n\"Dinner is served, your Grace.\"\n\nThus interrupted, Mr. Oover, with the resourcefulness of a practised\norator, brought his thanks to a quick but not abrupt conclusion. The\nlittle company passed into the front room.\n\nThrough the window, from the High, fading daylight mingled with the\ncandle-light. The mulberry coats of the hosts, interspersed by the black\nones of the guests, made a fine pattern around the oval table a-gleam\nwith the many curious pieces of gold and silver plate that had accrued\nto the Junta in course of years.\n\nThe President showed much deference to his guest. He seemed to listen\nwith close attention to the humorous anecdote with which, in the\nAmerican fashion, Mr. Oover inaugurated dinner.\n\nTo all Rhodes Scholars, indeed, his courtesy was invariable. He went out\nof his way to cultivate them. And this he did more as a favour to Lord\nMilner than of his own caprice. He found these Scholars, good fellows\nthough they were, rather oppressive. They had not--how could they\nhave?--the undergraduate's virtue of taking Oxford as a matter of\ncourse. The Germans loved it too little, the Colonials too much. The\nAmericans were, to a sensitive observer, the most troublesome--as being\nthe most troubled--of the whole lot. The Duke was not one of those\nEnglishmen who fling, or care to hear flung, cheap sneers at America.\nWhenever any one in his presence said that America was not large\nin area, he would firmly maintain that it was. He held, too, in his\nenlightened way, that Americans have a perfect right to exist. But\nhe did often find himself wishing Mr. Rhodes had not enabled them to\nexercise that right in Oxford. They were so awfully afraid of having\ntheir strenuous native characters undermined by their delight in the\nplace. They held that the future was theirs, a glorious asset, far more\nglorious than the past. But a theory, as the Duke saw, is one thing, an\nemotion another. It is so much easier to covet what one hasn't than to\nrevel in what one has. Also, it is so much easier to be enthusiastic\nabout what exists than about what doesn't. The future doesn't exist. The\npast does. For, whereas all men can learn, the gift of prophecy has died\nout. A man cannot work up in his breast any real excitement about what\npossibly won't happen. He cannot very well help being sentimentally\ninterested in what he knows has happened. On the other hand, he owes a\nduty to his country. And, if his country be America, he ought to try to\nfeel a vivid respect for the future, and a cold contempt for the past.\nAlso, if he be selected by his country as a specimen of the best moral,\nphysical, and intellectual type that she can produce for the astounding\nof the effete foreigner, and incidentally for the purpose of raising\nthat foreigner's tone, he must--mustn't he?--do his best to astound,\nto exalt. But then comes in this difficulty. Young men don't like to\nastound and exalt their fellows. And Americans, individually, are of\nall people the most anxious to please. That they talk overmuch is often\ntaken as a sign of self-satisfaction. It is merely a mannerism. Rhetoric\nis a thing inbred in them. They are quite unconscious of it. It is as\nnatural to them as breathing. And, while they talk on, they really do\nbelieve that they are a quick, businesslike people, by whom things are\n\"put through\" with an almost brutal abruptness. This notion of theirs is\nrather confusing to the patient English auditor.\n\nAltogether, the American Rhodes Scholars, with their splendid native\ngift of oratory, and their modest desire to please, and their not less\nevident feeling that they ought merely to edify, and their constant\ndelight in all that of Oxford their English brethren don't notice, and\ntheir constant fear that they are being corrupted, are a noble, rather\nthan a comfortable, element in the social life of the University. So, at\nleast, they seemed to the Duke.\n\nAnd to-night, but that he had invited Oover to dine with him, he could\nhave been dining with Zuleika. And this was his last dinner on earth.\nSuch thoughts made him the less able to take pleasure in his guest.\nPerfect, however, the amenity of his manner.\n\nThis was the more commendable because Oover's \"aura\" was even more\ndisturbing than that of the average Rhodes Scholar. To-night, besides\nthe usual conflicts in this young man's bosom, raged a special one\nbetween his desire to behave well and his jealousy of the man who had\nto-day been Miss Dobson's escort. In theory he denied the Duke's right\nto that honour. In sentiment he admitted it. Another conflict, you see.\nAnd another. He longed to orate about the woman who had his heart; yet\nshe was the one topic that must be shirked.\n\nThe MacQuern and Mr. Trent-Garby, Sir John Marraby and Lord Sayes, they\ntoo--though they were no orators--would fain have unpacked their hearts\nin words about Zuleika. They spoke of this and that, automatically, none\nlistening to another--each man listening, wide-eyed, to his own heart's\nsolo on the Zuleika theme, and drinking rather more champagne than was\ngood for him. Maybe, these youths sowed in themselves, on this night,\nthe seeds of lifelong intemperance. We cannot tell. They did not live\nlong enough for us to know.\n\nWhile the six dined, a seventh, invisible to them, leaned moodily\nagainst the mantel-piece, watching them. He was not of their time. His\nlong brown hair was knotted in a black riband behind. He wore a pale\nbrocaded coat and lace ruffles, silken stockings, a sword. Privy to\ntheir doom, he watched them. He was loth that his Junta must die. Yes,\nhis. Could the diners have seen him, they would have known him by his\nresemblance to the mezzotint portrait that hung on the wall above him.\nThey would have risen to their feet in presence of Humphrey Greddon,\nfounder and first president of the club.\n\nHis face was not so oval, nor were his eyes so big, nor his lips so\nfull, nor his hands so delicate, as they appeared in the mezzotint. Yet\n(bating the conventions of eighteenth-century portraiture) the likeness\nwas a good one. Humphrey Greddon was not less well-knit and graceful\nthan the painter had made him, and, hard though the lines of the face\nwere, there was about him a certain air of high romance that could not\nbe explained away by the fact that he was of a period not our own. You\ncould understand the great love that Nellie O'Mora had borne him.\n\nUnder the mezzotint hung Hoppner's miniature of that lovely and\nill-starred girl, with her soft dark eyes, and her curls all astray from\nbeneath her little blue turban. And the Duke was telling Mr. Oover her\nstory--how she had left her home for Humphrey Greddon when she was but\nsixteen, and he an undergraduate at Christ Church; and had lived for him\nin a cottage at Littlemore, whither he would ride, most days, to be with\nher; and how he tired of her, broke his oath that he would marry her,\nthereby broke her heart; and how she drowned herself in a mill-pond; and\nhow Greddon was killed in Venice, two years later, duelling on the Riva\nSchiavoni with a Senator whose daughter he had seduced.\n\nAnd he, Greddon, was not listening very attentively to the tale. He\nhad heard it told so often in this room, and he did not understand\nthe sentiments of the modern world. Nellie had been a monstrous pretty\ncreature. He had adored her, and had done with her. It was right that\nshe should always be toasted after dinner by the Junta, as in the days\nwhen first he loved her--\"Here's to Nellie O'Mora, the fairest witch\nthat ever was or will be!\" He would have resented the omission of that\ntoast. But he was sick of the pitying, melting looks that were always\ncast towards her miniature. Nellie had been beautiful, but, by God! she\nwas always a dunce and a simpleton. How could he have spent his life\nwith her? She was a fool, by God! not to marry that fool Trailby, of\nMerton, whom he took to see her.\n\nMr. Oover's moral tone, and his sense of chivalry, were of the American\nkind: far higher than ours, even, and far better expressed. Whereas the\nEnglish guests of the Junta, when they heard the tale of Nellie O'Mora,\nwould merely murmur \"Poor girl!\" or \"What a shame!\" Mr. Oover said in a\ntone of quiet authority that compelled Greddon's ear \"Duke, I hope I am\nnot incognisant of the laws that govern the relations of guest and host.\nBut, Duke, I aver deliberately that the founder of this fine old\nclub; at which you are so splendidly entertaining me to-night, was an\nunmitigated scoundrel. I say he was not a white man.\"\n\nAt the word \"scoundrel,\" Humphrey Greddon had sprung forward, drawing\nhis sword, and loudly, in a voice audible to himself alone, challenged\nthe American to make good his words. Then, as this gentleman took no\nnotice, with one clean straight thrust Greddon ran him through the\nheart, shouting \"Die, you damned psalm-singer and traducer! And so die\nall rebels against King George!\"* Withdrawing the blade, he wiped it\ndaintily on his cambric handkerchief. There was no blood. Mr. Oover,\nwith unpunctured shirt-front, was repeating \"I say he was not a white\nman.\" And Greddon remembered himself--remembered he was only a ghost,\nimpalpable, impotent, of no account. \"But I shall meet you in Hell\nto-morrow,\" he hissed in Oover's face. And there he was wrong. It is\nquite certain that Oover went to Heaven.\n\n   * As Edward VII. was at this time on the throne, it must have been\n     to George III. that Mr. Greddon was referring.\n\nUnable to avenge himself, Greddon had looked to the Duke to act for him.\nWhen he saw that this young man did but smile at Oover and make a vague\ndeprecatory gesture, he again, in his wrath, forgot his disabilities.\nDrawing himself to his full height, he took with great deliberation a\npinch of snuff, and, bowing low to the Duke, said \"I am vastly obleeged\nto your Grace for the fine high Courage you have exhibited in the behalf\nof your most Admiring, most Humble Servant.\" Then, having brushed away\na speck of snuff from his jabot, he turned on his heel; and only in the\ndoorway, where one of the club servants, carrying a decanter in each\nhand, walked straight through him, did he realise that he had not\nspoilt the Duke's evening. With a volley of the most appalling\neighteenth-century oaths, he passed back into the nether world.\n\nTo the Duke, Nellie O'Mora had never been a very vital figure. He had\noften repeated the legend of her. But, having never known what love was,\nhe could not imagine her rapture or her anguish. Himself the quarry of\nall Mayfair's wise virgins, he had always--so far as he thought of\nthe matter at all--suspected that Nellie's death was due to thwarted\nambition. But to-night, while he told Oover about her, he could see\ninto her soul. Nor did he pity her. She had loved. She had known the\none thing worth living for--and dying for. She, as she went down to the\nmill-pond, had felt just that ecstasy of self-sacrifice which he himself\nhad felt to-day and would feel to-morrow. And for a while, too--for a\nfull year--she had known the joy of being loved, had been for Greddon\n\"the fairest witch that ever was or will be.\" He could not agree with\nOover's long disquisition on her sufferings. And, glancing at her\nwell-remembered miniature, he wondered just what it was in her that had\ncaptivated Greddon. He was in that blest state when a man cannot believe\nthe earth has been trodden by any really beautiful or desirable lady\nsave the lady of his own heart.\n\nThe moment had come for the removal of the table-cloth. The mahogany of\nthe Junta was laid bare--a clear dark lake, anon to reflect in its still\nand ruddy depths the candelabras and the fruit-cradles, the slender\nglasses and the stout old decanters, the forfeit-box and the snuff-box,\nand other paraphernalia of the dignity of dessert. Lucidly, and\nunwaveringly inverted in the depths these good things stood; and, so\nsoon as the wine had made its circuit, the Duke rose and with uplifted\nglass proposed the first of the two toasts traditional to the Junta.\n\"Gentlemen, I give you Church and State.\"\n\nThe toast having been honoured by all--and by none with a richer\nreverence than by Oover, despite his passionate mental reservation in\nfavour of Pittsburg-Anabaptism and the Republican Ideal--the snuff-box\nwas handed round, and fruit was eaten.\n\nPresently, when the wine had gone round again, the Duke rose and with\nuplifted glass said \"Gentlemen, I give you--\" and there halted.\nSilent, frowning, flushed, he stood for a few moments, and then, with\na deliberate gesture, tilted his glass and let fall the wine to the\ncarpet. \"No,\" he said, looking round the table, \"I cannot give you\nNellie O'Mora.\"\n\n\"Why not?\" gasped Sir John Marraby.\n\n\"You have a right to ask that,\" said the Duke, still standing. \"I can\nonly say that my conscience is stronger than my sense of what is due to\nthe customs of the club. Nellie O'Mora,\" he said, passing his hand over\nhis brow, \"may have been in her day the fairest witch that ever was--so\nfair that our founder had good reason to suppose her the fairest witch\nthat ever would be. But his prediction was a false one. So at least it\nseems to me. Of course I cannot both hold this view and remain President\nof this club. MacQuern--Marraby--which of you is Vice-President?\"\n\n\"He is,\" said Marraby.\n\n\"Then, MacQuern, you are hereby President, vice myself resigned. Take\nthe chair and propose the toast.\"\n\n\"I would rather not,\" said The MacQuern after a pause.\n\n\"Then, Marraby, YOU must.\"\n\n\"Not I!\" said Marraby.\n\n\"Why is this?\" asked the Duke, looking from one to the other.\n\nThe MacQuern, with Scotch caution, was silent. But the impulsive\nMarraby--Madcap Marraby, as they called him in B.N.C.--said \"It's\nbecause I won't lie!\" and, leaping up, raised his glass aloft and cried\n\"I give you Zuleika Dobson, the fairest witch that ever was or will be!\"\n\nMr. Oover, Lord Sayes, Mr. Trent-Garby, sprang to their feet; The\nMacQuern rose to his. \"Zuleika Dobson!\" they cried, and drained their\nglasses.\n\nThen, when they had resumed their seats, came an awkward pause. The\nDuke, still erect beside the chair he had vacated, looked very grave\nand pale. Marraby had taken an outrageous liberty. But \"a member of the\nJunta can do no wrong,\" and the liberty could not be resented. The Duke\nfelt that the blame was on himself, who had elected Marraby to the club.\n\nMr. Oover, too, looked grave. All the antiquarian in him deplored\nthe sudden rupture of a fine old Oxford tradition. All the chivalrous\nAmerican in him resented the slight on that fair victim of the feudal\nsystem, Miss O'Mora. And, at the same time, all the Abimelech V. in him\nrejoiced at having honoured by word and act the one woman in the world.\n\nGazing around at the flushed faces and heaving shirt-fronts of the\ndiners, the Duke forgot Marraby's misdemeanour. What mattered far more\nto him was that here were five young men deeply under the spell of\nZuleika. They must be saved, if possible. He knew how strong his\ninfluence was in the University. He knew also how strong was Zuleika's.\nHe had not much hope of the issue. But his new-born sense of duty to his\nfellows spurred him on. \"Is there,\" he asked with a bitter smile, \"any\none of you who doesn't with his whole heart love Miss Dobson?\"\n\nNobody held up a hand.\n\n\"As I feared,\" said the Duke, knowing not that if a hand had been held\nup he would have taken it as a personal insult. No man really in love\ncan forgive another for not sharing his ardour. His jealousy for himself\nwhen his beloved prefers another man is hardly a stronger passion than\nhis jealousy for her when she is not preferred to all other women.\n\n\"You know her only by sight--by repute?\" asked the Duke. They signified\nthat this was so. \"I wish you would introduce me to her,\" said Marraby.\n\n\"You are all coming to the Judas concert tonight?\" the Duke asked,\nignoring Marraby. \"You have all secured tickets?\" They nodded. \"To hear\nme play, or to see Miss Dobson?\" There was a murmur of \"Both--both.\"\n\"And you would all of you, like Marraby, wish to be presented to this\nlady?\" Their eyes dilated. \"That way happiness lies, think you?\"\n\n\"Oh, happiness be hanged!\" said Marraby.\n\nTo the Duke this seemed a profoundly sane remark--an epitome of his own\nsentiments. But what was right for himself was not right for all. He\nbelieved in convention as the best way for average mankind. And so,\nslowly, calmly, he told to his fellow-diners just what he had told a few\nhours earlier to those two young men in Salt Cellar. Not knowing that\nhis words had already been spread throughout Oxford, he was rather\nsurprised that they seemed to make no sensation. Quite flat, too, fell\nhis appeal that the syren be shunned by all.\n\nMr. Oover, during his year of residence, had been sorely tried by the\nquaint old English custom of not making public speeches after private\ndinners. It was with a deep sigh of satisfaction that he now rose to his\nfeet.\n\n\"Duke,\" he said in a low voice, which yet penetrated to every corner\nof the room, \"I guess I am voicing these gentlemen when I say that your\nwords show up your good heart, all the time. Your mentality, too, is\nbully, as we all predicate. One may say without exaggeration that your\nscholarly and social attainments are a by-word throughout the solar\nsystem, and be-yond. We rightly venerate you as our boss. Sir, we\nworship the ground you walk on. But we owe a duty to our own free and\nindependent manhood. Sir, we worship the ground Miss Z. Dobson treads\non. We have pegged out a claim right there. And from that location\nwe aren't to be budged--not for bob-nuts. We asseverate we\nsquat--where--we--squat, come--what--will. You say we have no chance to\nwin Miss Z. Dobson. That--we--know. We aren't worthy. We lie prone. Let\nher walk over us. You say her heart is cold. We don't pro-fess we\ncan take the chill off. But, Sir, we can't be diverted out of loving\nher--not even by you, Sir. No, Sir! We love her, and--shall, and--will,\nSir, with--our--latest breath.\"\n\nThis peroration evoked loud applause. \"I love her, and shall, and will,\"\nshouted each man. And again they honoured in wine her image. Sir John\nMarraby uttered a cry familiar in the hunting-field. The MacQuern\ncontributed a few bars of a sentimental ballad in the dialect of his\ncountry. \"Hurrah, hurrah!\" shouted Mr. Trent-Garby. Lord Sayes hummed\nthe latest waltz, waving his arms to its rhythm, while the wine he had\njust spilt on his shirt-front trickled unheeded to his waistcoat. Mr.\nOover gave the Yale cheer.\n\nThe genial din was wafted down through the open window to the\npassers-by. The wine-merchant across the way heard it, and smiled\npensively. \"Youth, youth!\" he murmured.\n\nThe genial din grew louder.\n\nAt any other time, the Duke would have been jarred by the disgrace to\nthe Junta. But now, as he stood with bent head, covering his face with\nhis hands, he thought only of the need to rid these young men, here\nand now, of the influence that had befallen them. To-morrow his tragic\nexample might be too late, the mischief have sunk too deep, the agony be\nlife-long. His good breeding forbade him to cast over a dinner-table the\nshadow of his death. His conscience insisted that he must. He uncovered\nhis face, and held up one hand for silence.\n\n\"We are all of us,\" he said, \"old enough to remember vividly the\ndemonstrations made in the streets of London when war was declared\nbetween us and the Transvaal Republic. You, Mr. Oover, doubtless heard\nin America the echoes of those ebullitions. The general idea was that\nthe war was going to be a very brief and simple affair--what was called\n'a walk-over.' To me, though I was only a small boy, it seemed that all\nthis delirious pride in the prospect of crushing a trumpery foe argued\na defect in our sense of proportion. Still, I was able to understand the\ndemonstrators' point of view. To 'the giddy vulgar' any sort of victory\nis pleasant. But defeat? If, when that war was declared, every one had\nbeen sure that not only should we fail to conquer the Transvaal, but\nthat IT would conquer US--that not only would it make good its freedom\nand independence, but that we should forfeit ours--how would the\ncits have felt then? Would they not have pulled long faces, spoken in\nwhispers, wept? You must forgive me for saying that the noise you have\njust made around this table was very like to the noise made on the verge\nof the Boer War. And your procedure seems to me as unaccountable as\nwould have seemed the antics of those mobs if England had been plainly\ndoomed to disaster and to vassalage. My guest here to-night, in the\ncourse of his very eloquent and racy speech, spoke of the need that he\nand you should preserve your 'free and independent manhood.' That seemed\nto me an irreproachable ideal. But I confess I was somewhat taken aback\nby my friend's scheme for realising it. He declared his intention of\nlying prone and letting Miss Dobson 'walk over' him; and he advised you\nto follow his example; and to this counsel you gave evident approval.\nGentlemen, suppose that on the verge of the aforesaid war, some orator\nhad said to the British people 'It is going to be a walk-over for our\nenemy in the field. Mr. Kruger holds us in the hollow of his hand.\nIn subjection to him we shall find our long-lost freedom and\nindependence'--what would have been Britannia's answer? What, on\nreflection, is yours to Mr. Oover? What are Mr. Oover's own second\nthoughts?\" The Duke paused, with a smile to his guest.\n\n\"Go right ahead, Duke,\" said Mr. Oover. \"I'll re-ply when my turn\ncomes.\"\n\n\"And not utterly demolish me, I hope,\" said the Duke. His was the Oxford\nmanner. \"Gentlemen,\" he continued, \"is it possible that Britannia would\nhave thrown her helmet in the air, shrieking 'Slavery for ever'? You,\ngentlemen, seem to think slavery a pleasant and an honourable state. You\nhave less experience of it than I. I have been enslaved to Miss Dobson\nsince yesterday evening; you, only since this afternoon; I, at close\nquarters; you, at a respectful distance. Your fetters have not galled\nyou yet. MY wrists, MY ankles, are excoriated. The iron has entered into\nmy soul. I droop. I stumble. Blood flows from me. I quiver and curse. I\nwrithe. The sun mocks me. The moon titters in my face. I can stand it no\nlonger. I will no more of it. Tomorrow I die.\"\n\nThe flushed faces of the diners grew gradually pale. Their eyes lost\nlustre. Their tongues clove to the roofs of their mouths.\n\nAt length, almost inaudibly, The MacQuern asked \"Do you mean you are\ngoing to commit suicide?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said the Duke, \"if you choose to put it in that way. Yes. And it\nis only by a chance that I did not commit suicide this afternoon.\"\n\n\"You--don't--say,\" gasped Mr. Oover.\n\n\"I do indeed,\" said the Duke. \"And I ask you all to weigh well my\nmessage.\"\n\n\"But--but does Miss Dobson know?\" asked Sir John.\n\n\"Oh yes,\" was the reply. \"Indeed, it was she who persuaded me not to die\ntill to-morrow.\"\n\n\"But--but,\" faltered Lord Sayes, \"I saw her saying good-bye to you in\nJudas Street. And--and she looked quite--as if nothing had happened.\"\n\n\"Nothing HAD happened,\" said the Duke. \"And she was very much pleased\nto have me still with her. But she isn't so cruel as to hinder me from\ndying for her to-morrow. I don't think she exactly fixed the hour. It\nshall be just after the Eights have been rowed. An earlier death would\nmark in me a lack of courtesy to that contest... It seems strange to\nyou that I should do this thing? Take warning by me. Muster all your\nwill-power, and forget Miss Dobson. Tear up your tickets for the\nconcert. Stay here and play cards. Play high. Or rather, go back to your\nvarious Colleges, and speed the news I have told you. Put all Oxford on\nits guard against this woman who can love no lover. Let all Oxford\nknow that I, Dorset, who had so much reason to love life--I, the\nnonpareil--am going to die for the love I bear this woman. And let no\nman think I go unwilling. I am no lamb led to the slaughter. I am priest\nas well as victim. I offer myself up with a pious joy. But enough\nof this cold Hebraism! It is ill-attuned to my soul's mood.\nSelf-sacrifice--bah! Regard me as a voluptuary. I am that. All my\nbaffled ardour speeds me to the bosom of Death. She is gentle and\nwanton. She knows I could never have loved her for her own sake. She\nhas no illusions about me. She knows well I come to her because not\notherwise may I quench my passion.\"\n\nThere was a long silence. The Duke, looking around at the bent heads and\ndrawn mouths of his auditors, saw that his words had gone home. It was\nMarraby who revealed how powerfully home they had gone.\n\n\"Dorset,\" he said huskily, \"I shall die too.\"\n\nThe Duke flung up his hands, staring wildly.\n\n\"I stand in with that,\" said Mr. Oover.\n\n\"So do I!\" said Lord Sayes. \"And I!\" said Mr. Trent-Garby; \"And I!\" The\nMacQuern.\n\nThe Duke found voice. \"Are you mad?\" he asked, clutching at his throat.\n\"Are you all mad?\"\n\n\"No, Duke,\" said Mr. Oover. \"Or, if we are, you have no right to be at\nlarge. You have shown us the way. We--take it.\"\n\n\"Just so,\" said The MacQuern, stolidly.\n\n\"Listen, you fools,\" cried the Duke. But through the open window came\nthe vibrant stroke of some clock. He wheeled round, plucked out his\nwatch--nine!--the concert!--his promise not to be late!--Zuleika!\n\nAll other thoughts vanished. In an instant he dodged beneath the sash\nof the window. From the flower-box he sprang to the road beneath. (The\nfacade of the house is called, to this day, Dorset's Leap.) Alighting\nwith the legerity of a cat, he swerved leftward in the recoil, and was\noff, like a streak of mulberry-coloured lightning, down the High.\n\nThe other men had rushed to the window, fearing the worst. \"No,\" cried\nOover. \"That's all right. Saves time!\" and he raised himself on to the\nwindow-box. It splintered under his weight. He leapt heavily but well,\nfollowed by some uprooted geraniums. Squaring his shoulders, he threw\nback his head, and doubled down the slope.\n\nThere was a violent jostle between the remaining men. The MacQuern\ncannily got out of it, and rushed downstairs. He emerged at the\nfront-door just after Marraby touched ground. The Baronet's left ankle\nhad twisted under him. His face was drawn with pain as he hopped down\nthe High on his right foot, fingering his ticket for the concert. Next\nleapt Lord Sayes. And last of all leapt Mr. Trent-Garby, who, catching\nhis foot in the ruined flower-box, fell headlong, and was, I regret to\nsay, killed. Lord Sayes passed Sir John in a few paces. The MacQuern\novertook Mr. Oover at St. Mary's and outstripped him in Radcliffe\nSquare. The Duke came in an easy first.\n\nYouth, youth!\n\n\n\n\nIX\n\nAcross the Front Quadrangle, heedless of the great crowd to right and\nleft, Dorset rushed. Up the stone steps to the Hall he bounded, and\nonly on the Hall's threshold was he brought to a pause. The doorway\nwas blocked by the backs of youths who had by hook and crook secured\nstanding-room. The whole scene was surprisingly unlike that of the\naverage College concert.\n\n\"Let me pass,\" said the Duke, rather breathlessly. \"Thank you. Make way\nplease. Thanks.\" And with quick-pulsing heart he made his way down the\naisle to the front row. There awaited him a surprise that was like a\ndouche of cold water full in his face. Zuleika was not there! It had\nnever occurred to him that she herself might not be punctual.\n\nThe Warden was there, reading his programme with an air of great\nsolemnity. \"Where,\" asked the Duke, \"is your grand-daughter?\" His tone\nwas as of a man saying \"If she is dead, don't break it gently to me.\"\n\n\"My grand-daughter?\" said the Warden. \"Ah, Duke, good evening.\"\n\n\"She's not ill?\"\n\n\"Oh no, I think not. She said something about changing the dress she\nwore at dinner. She will come.\" And the Warden thanked his young friend\nfor the great kindness he had shown to Zuleika. He hoped the Duke had\nnot let her worry him with her artless prattle. \"She seems to be a good,\namiable girl,\" he added, in his detached way.\n\nSitting beside him, the Duke looked curiously at the venerable profile,\nas at a mummy's. To think that this had once been a man! To think that\nhis blood flowed in the veins of Zuleika! Hitherto the Duke had seen\nnothing grotesque in him--had regarded him always as a dignified\nspecimen of priest and scholar. Such a life as the Warden's, year\nfollowing year in ornamental seclusion from the follies and fusses of\nthe world, had to the Duke seemed rather admirable and enviable. Often\nhe himself had (for a minute or so) meditated taking a fellowship at All\nSouls and spending here in Oxford the greater part of his life. He had\nnever been young, and it never had occurred to him that the Warden had\nbeen young once. To-night he saw the old man in a new light--saw that\nhe was mad. Here was a man who--for had he not married and begotten a\nchild?--must have known, in some degree, the emotion of love. How, after\nthat, could he have gone on thus, year by year, rusting among his\nbooks, asking no favour of life, waiting for death without a sign of\nimpatience? Why had he not killed himself long ago? Why cumbered he the\nearth?\n\nOn the dais an undergraduate was singing a song entitled \"She Loves Not\nMe.\" Such plaints are apt to leave us unharrowed. Across the footlights\nof an opera-house, the despair of some Italian tenor in red tights and\na yellow wig may be convincing enough. Not so, at a concert, the despair\nof a shy British amateur in evening dress. The undergraduate on the\ndais, fumbling with his sheet of music while he predicted that only when\nhe were \"laid within the church-yard cold and grey\" would his lady\nbegin to pity him, seemed to the Duke rather ridiculous; but not half so\nridiculous as the Warden. This fictitious love-affair was less nugatory\nthan the actual humdrum for which Dr. Dobson had sold his soul to the\ndevil. Also, little as one might suspect it, the warbler was perhaps\nexpressing a genuine sentiment. Zuleika herself, belike, was in his\nthoughts.\n\nAs he began the second stanza, predicting that when his lady died too\nthe angels of heaven would bear her straight to him, the audience heard\na loud murmur, or subdued roar, outside the Hall. And after a few bars\nthe warbler suddenly ceased, staring straight in front of him as though\nhe saw a vision. Automatically, all heads veered in the direction of his\ngaze. From the entrance, slowly along the aisle, came Zuleika, brilliant\nin black.\n\nTo the Duke, who had rapturously risen, she nodded and smiled as\nshe swerved down on the chair beside him. She looked to him somehow\ndifferent. He had quite forgiven her for being late: her mere presence\nwas a perfect excuse. And the very change in her, though he could not\ndefine it, was somehow pleasing to him. He was about to question\nher, but she shook her head and held up to her lips a black-gloved\nforefinger, enjoining silence for the singer, who, with dogged British\npluck, had harked back to the beginning of the second stanza. When his\ntask was done and he shuffled down from the dais, he received a great\novation. Zuleika, in the way peculiar to persons who are in the habit of\nappearing before the public, held her hands well above the level of\nher brow, and clapped them with a vigour demonstrative not less of her\npresence than of her delight.\n\n\"And now,\" she asked, turning to the Duke, \"do you see? do you see?\"\n\n\"Something, yes. But what?\"\n\n\"Isn't it plain?\" Lightly she touched the lobe of her left ear. \"Aren't\nyou flattered?\"\n\nHe knew now what made the difference. It was that her little face was\nflanked by two black pearls.\n\n\"Think,\" said she, \"how deeply I must have been brooding over you since\nwe parted!\"\n\n\"Is this really,\" he asked, pointing to the left ear-ring, \"the pearl\nyou wore to-day?\"\n\n\"Yes. Isn't it strange? A man ought to be pleased when a woman goes\nquite unconsciously into mourning for him--goes just because she really\ndoes mourn him.\"\n\n\"I am more than pleased. I am touched. When did the change come?\"\n\n\"I don't know. I only noticed it after dinner, when I saw myself in the\nmirror. All through dinner I had been thinking of you and of--well, of\nto-morrow. And this dear sensitive pink pearl had again expressed my\nsoul. And there was I, in a yellow gown with green embroideries, gay\nas a jacamar, jarring hideously on myself. I covered my eyes and rushed\nupstairs, rang the bell and tore my things off. My maid was very cross.\"\n\nCross! The Duke was shot through with envy of one who was in a position\nto be unkind to Zuleika. \"Happy maid!\" he murmured. Zuleika replied that\nhe was stealing her thunder: hadn't she envied the girl at his lodgings?\n\"But I,\" she said, \"wanted only to serve you in meekness. The idea of\never being pert to you didn't enter into my head. You show a side of\nyour character as unpleasing as it was unforeseen.\"\n\n\"Perhaps then,\" said the Duke, \"it is as well that I am going to die.\"\nShe acknowledged his rebuke with a pretty gesture of penitence. \"You\nmay have been faultless in love,\" he added; \"but you would not have laid\ndown your life for me.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" she answered, \"wouldn't I though? You don't know me. That is just\nthe sort of thing I should have loved to do. I am much more romantic\nthan you are, really. I wonder,\" she said, glancing at his breast, \"if\nYOUR pink pearl would have turned black? And I wonder if YOU would have\ntaken the trouble to change that extraordinary coat you are wearing?\"\n\nIn sooth, no costume could have been more beautifully Cimmerian than\nZuleika's. And yet, thought the Duke, watching her as the concert\nproceeded, the effect of her was not lugubrious. Her darkness shone.\nThe black satin gown she wore was a stream of shifting high-lights.\nBig black diamonds were around her throat and wrists, and tiny black\ndiamonds starred the fan she wielded. In her hair gleamed a great\nraven's wing. And brighter, brighter than all these were her eyes.\nAssuredly no, there was nothing morbid about her. Would one even\n(wondered the Duke, for a disloyal instant) go so far as to say she was\nheartless? Ah no, she was merely strong. She was one who could tread the\ntragic plane without stumbling, and be resilient in the valley of the\nshadow. What she had just said was no more than the truth: she would\nhave loved to die for him, had he not forfeited her heart. She would\nhave asked no tears. That she had none to shed for him now, that she did\nbut share his exhilaration, was the measure of her worthiness to have\nthe homage of his self-slaughter.\n\n\"By the way,\" she whispered, \"I want to ask one little favour of you.\nWill you, please, at the last moment to-morrow, call out my name in a\nloud voice, so that every one around can hear?\"\n\n\"Of course I will.\"\n\n\"So that no one shall ever be able to say it wasn't for me that you\ndied, you know.\"\n\n\"May I use simply your Christian name?\"\n\n\"Yes, I really don't see why you shouldn't--at such a moment.\"\n\n\"Thank you.\" His face glowed.\n\nThus did they commune, these two, radiant without and within. And behind\nthem, throughout the Hall, the undergraduates craned their necks for\na glimpse. The Duke's piano solo, which was the last item in the first\nhalf of the programme, was eagerly awaited. Already, whispered first\nfrom the lips of Oover and the others who had come on from the Junta,\nthe news of his resolve had gone from ear to ear among the men. He, for\nhis part, had forgotten the scene at the Junta, the baleful effect of\nhis example. For him the Hall was a cave of solitude--no one there but\nZuleika and himself. Yet almost, like the late Mr. John Bright, he heard\nin the air the beating of the wings of the Angel of Death. Not awful\nwings; little wings that sprouted from the shoulders of a rosy and\nblindfold child. Love and Death--for him they were exquisitely one. And\nit seemed to him, when his turn came to play, that he floated, rather\nthan walked, to the dais.\n\nHe had not considered what he would play tonight. Nor, maybe, was he\nconscious now of choosing. His fingers caressed the keyboard vaguely;\nand anon this ivory had voice and language; and for its master, and for\nsome of his hearers, arose a vision. And it was as though in delicate\nprocession, very slowly, listless with weeping, certain figures passed\nby, hooded, and drooping forasmuch as by the loss of him whom they were\nfollowing to his grave their own hold on life had been loosened. He\nhad been so beautiful and young. Lo, he was but a burden to be carried\nhence, dust to be hidden out of sight. Very slowly, very wretchedly they\nwent by. But, as they went, another feeling, faint at first, an all but\nimperceptible current, seemed to flow through the procession; and now\none, now another of the mourners would look wanly up, with cast-back\nhood, as though listening; and anon all were listening on their way,\nfirst in wonder, then in rapture; for the soul of their friend was\nsinging to them: they heard his voice, but clearer and more blithe than\nthey had ever known it--a voice etherealised by a triumph of joy that\nwas not yet for them to share. But presently the voice receded, its\nechoes dying away into the sphere whence it came. It ceased; and the\nmourners were left alone again with their sorrow, and passed on all\nunsolaced, and drooping, weeping.\n\nSoon after the Duke had begun to play, an invisible figure came and\nstood by and listened; a frail man, dressed in the fashion of 1840; the\nshade of none other than Frederic Chopin. Behind whom, a moment later,\ncame a woman of somewhat masculine aspect and dominant demeanour,\nmounting guard over him, and, as it were, ready to catch him if he fell.\nHe bowed his head lower and lower, he looked up with an ecstasy more\nand more intense, according to the procedure of his Marche Funebre. And\namong the audience, too, there was a bowing and uplifting of heads, just\nas among the figures of the mourners evoked. Yet the head of the player\nhimself was all the while erect, and his face glad and serene. Nobly\nsensitive as was his playing of the mournful passages, he smiled\nbrilliantly through them.\n\nAnd Zuleika returned his gaze with a smile not less gay. She was not\nsure what he was playing. But she assumed that it was for her, and that\nthe music had some reference to his impending death. She was one of the\npeople who say \"I don't know anything about music really, but I know\nwhat I like.\" And she liked this; and she beat time to it with her fan.\nShe thought her Duke looked very handsome. She was proud of him. Strange\nthat this time yesterday she had been wildly in love with him! Strange,\ntoo, that this time to-morrow he would be dead! She was immensely glad\nshe had saved him this afternoon. To-morrow! There came back to her what\nhe had told her about the omen at Tankerton, that stately home: \"On the\neve of the death of a Duke of Dorset, two black owls come always and\nperch on the battlements. They remain there through the night, hooting.\nAt dawn they fly away, none knows whither.\" Perhaps, thought she, at\nthis very moment these two birds were on the battlements.\n\nThe music ceased. In the hush that followed it, her applause rang sharp\nand notable. Not so Chopin's. Of him and his intense excitement none but\nhis companion was aware. \"Plus fin que Pachmann!\" he reiterated, waving\nhis arms wildly, and dancing.\n\n\"Tu auras une migraine affreuse. Rentrons, petit coeur!\" said George\nSand, gently but firmly.\n\n\"Laisse-moi le saluer,\" cried the composer, struggling in her grasp.\n\n\"Demain soir, oui. Il sera parmi nous,\" said the novelist, as she\nhurried him away. \"Moi aussi,\" she added to herself, \"je me promets un\nbeau plaisir en faisant la connaissance de ce jeune homme.\"\n\nZuleika was the first to rise as \"ce jeune homme\" came down from the\ndais. Now was the interval between the two parts of the programme.\nThere was a general creaking and scraping of pushed-back chairs as the\naudience rose and went forth into the night. The noise aroused from\nsleep the good Warden, who, having peered at his programme, complimented\nthe Duke with old-world courtesy and went to sleep again. Zuleika,\nthrusting her fan under one arm, shook the player by both hands. Also,\nshe told him that she knew nothing about music really, but that she\nknew what she liked. As she passed with him up the aisle, she said this\nagain. People who say it are never tired of saying it.\n\nOutside, the crowd was greater than ever. All the undergraduates from\nall the Colleges seemed now to be concentrated in the great Front\nQuadrangle of Judas. Even in the glow of the Japanese lanterns that hung\naround in honour of the concert, the faces of the lads looked a little\npale. For it was known by all now that the Duke was to die. Even while\nthe concert was in progress, the news had spread out from the Hall,\nthrough the thronged doorway, down the thronged steps, to the confines\nof the crowd. Nor had Oover and the other men from the Junta made any\nsecret of their own determination. And now, as the rest saw Zuleika\nyet again at close quarters, and verified their remembrance of her, the\nhalf-formed desire in them to die too was hardened to a vow.\n\nYou cannot make a man by standing a sheep on its hind-legs. But by\nstanding a flock of sheep in that position you can make a crowd of men.\nIf man were not a gregarious animal, the world might have achieved, by\nthis time, some real progress towards civilisation. Segregate him, and\nhe is no fool. But let him loose among his fellows, and he is lost--he\nbecomes just an unit in unreason. If any one of the undergraduates had\nmet Miss Dobson in the desert of Sahara, he would have fallen in love\nwith her; but not one in a thousand of them would have wished to die\nbecause she did not love him. The Duke's was a peculiar case. For him to\nfall in love was itself a violent peripety, bound to produce a violent\nupheaval; and such was his pride that for his love to be unrequited\nwould naturally enamour him of death. These other, these quite ordinary,\nyoung men were the victims less of Zuleika than of the Duke's example,\nand of one another. A crowd, proportionately to its size, magnifies all\nthat in its units pertains to the emotions, and diminishes all that in\nthem pertains to thought. It was because these undergraduates were a\ncrowd that their passion for Zuleika was so intense; and it was because\nthey were a crowd that they followed so blindly the lead given to them.\nTo die for Miss Dobson was \"the thing to do.\" The Duke was going to do\nit. The Junta was going to do it. It is a hateful fact, but we must face\nthe fact, that snobbishness was one of the springs to the tragedy here\nchronicled.\n\nWe may set to this crowd's credit that it refrained now from following\nZuleika. Not one of the ladies present was deserted by her escort. All\nthe men recognised the Duke's right to be alone with Zuleika now. We may\nset also to their credit that they carefully guarded the ladies from all\nknowledge of what was afoot.\n\nSide by side, the great lover and his beloved wandered away, beyond the\nlight of the Japanese lanterns, and came to Salt Cellar.\n\nThe moon, like a gardenia in the night's button-hole--but no! why should\na writer never be able to mention the moon without likening her to\nsomething else--usually something to which she bears not the faintest\nresemblance?... The moon, looking like nothing whatsoever but herself,\nwas engaged in her old and futile endeavour to mark the hours correctly\non the sun-dial at the centre of the lawn. Never, except once, late one\nnight in the eighteenth century, when the toper who was Sub-Warden had\nspent an hour in trying to set his watch here, had she received the\nslightest encouragement. Still she wanly persisted. And this was the\nmore absurd in her because Salt Cellar offered very good scope for those\nlegitimate effects of hers which we one and all admire. Was it nothing\nto her to have cut those black shadows across the cloisters? Was\nit nothing to her that she so magically mingled her rays with the\ncandle-light shed forth from Zuleika's bedroom? Nothing, that she\nhad cleansed the lawn of all its colour, and made of it a platform of\nsilver-grey, fit for fairies to dance on?\n\nIf Zuleika, as she paced the gravel path, had seen how transfigured--how\nnobly like the Tragic Muse--she was just now, she could not have gone on\nbothering the Duke for a keepsake of the tragedy that was to be.\n\nShe was still set on having his two studs. He was still firm in his\nrefusal to misappropriate those heirlooms. In vain she pointed out to\nhim that the pearls he meant, the white ones, no longer existed; that\nthe pearls he was wearing were no more \"entailed\" than if he had got\nthem yesterday. \"And you actually DID get them yesterday,\" she said.\n\"And from me. And I want them back.\"\n\n\"You are ingenious,\" he admitted. \"I, in my simple way, am but head of\nthe Tanville-Tankerton family. Had you accepted my offer of marriage,\nyou would have had the right to wear these two pearls during your\nlife-time. I am very happy to die for you. But tamper with the property\nof my successor I cannot and will not. I am sorry,\" he added.\n\n\"Sorry!\" echoed Zuleika. \"Yes, and you were 'sorry' you couldn't dine\nwith me to-night. But any little niggling scruple is more to you than I\nam. What old maids men are!\" And viciously with her fan she struck one\nof the cloister pillars.\n\nHer outburst was lost on the Duke. At her taunt about his not dining\nwith her, he had stood still, clapping one hand to his brow. The events\nof the early evening swept back to him--his speech, its unforeseen and\nhorrible reception. He saw again the preternaturally solemn face of\nOover, and the flushed faces of the rest. He had thought, as he pointed\ndown to the abyss over which he stood, these fellows would recoil,\nand pull themselves together. They had recoiled, and pulled themselves\ntogether, only in the manner of athletes about to spring. He was\nresponsible for them. His own life was his to lose: others he must\nnot squander. Besides, he had reckoned to die alone, unique; aloft and\napart... \"There is something--something I had forgotten,\" he said to\nZuleika, \"something that will be a great shock to you\"; and he gave her\nan outline of what had passed at the Junta.\n\n\"And you are sure they really MEANT it?\" she asked in a voice that\ntrembled.\n\n\"I fear so. But they were over-excited. They will recant their folly. I\nshall force them to.\"\n\n\"They are not children. You yourself have just been calling them 'men.'\nWhy should they obey you?\"\n\nShe turned at sound of a footstep, and saw a young man approaching. He\nwore a coat like the Duke's, and in his hand he dangled a handkerchief.\nHe bowed awkwardly, and, holding out the handkerchief, said to her \"I\nbeg your pardon, but I think you dropped this. I have just picked it\nup.\"\n\nZuleika looked at the handkerchief, which was obviously a man's, and\nsmilingly shook her head.\n\n\"I don't think you know The MacQuern,\" said the Duke, with sulky grace.\n\"This,\" he said to the intruder, \"is Miss Dobson.\"\n\n\"And is it really true,\" asked Zuleika, retaining The MacQuern's hand,\n\"that you want to die for me?\"\n\nWell, the Scots are a self-seeking and a resolute, but a shy, race;\nswift to act, when swiftness is needed, but seldom knowing quite what to\nsay. The MacQuern, with native reluctance to give something for nothing,\nhad determined to have the pleasure of knowing the young lady for whom\nhe was to lay down his life; and this purpose he had, by the simple\nstratagem of his own handkerchief, achieved. Nevertheless, in answer to\nZuleika's question, and with the pressure of her hand to inspire him,\nthe only word that rose to his lips was \"Ay\" (which may be roughly\ntranslated as \"Yes\").\n\n\"You will do nothing of the sort,\" interposed the Duke.\n\n\"There,\" said Zuleika, still retaining The MacQuern's hand, \"you see, it\nis forbidden. You must not defy our dear little Duke. He is not used to\nit. It is not done.\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" said The MacQuern, with a stony glance at the Duke,\n\"that he has anything to do with the matter.\"\n\n\"He is older and wiser than you. More a man of the world. Regard him as\nyour tutor.\"\n\n\"Do YOU want me not to die for you?\" asked the young man.\n\n\"Ah, _I_ should not dare to impose my wishes on you,\" said she, dropping\nhis hand. \"Even,\" she added, \"if I knew what my wishes were. And I\ndon't. I know only that I think it is very, very beautiful of you to\nthink of dying for me.\"\n\n\"Then that settles it,\" said The MacQuern.\n\n\"No, no! You must not let yourself be influenced by ME. Besides, I am\nnot in a mood to influence anybody. I am overwhelmed. Tell me,\" she\nsaid, heedless of the Duke, who stood tapping his heel on the ground,\nwith every manifestation of disapproval and impatience, \"tell me, is it\ntrue that some of the other men love me too, and--feel as you do?\"\n\nThe MacQuern said cautiously that he could answer for no one but\nhimself. \"But,\" he allowed, \"I saw a good many men whom I know, outside\nthe Hall here, just now, and they seemed to have made up their minds.\"\n\n\"To die for me? To-morrow?\"\n\n\"To-morrow. After the Eights, I suppose; at the same time as the Duke.\nIt wouldn't do to leave the races undecided.\"\n\n\"Of COURSE not. But the poor dears! It is too touching! I have done\nnothing, nothing to deserve it.\"\n\n\"Nothing whatsoever,\" said the Duke drily.\n\n\"Oh HE,\" said Zuleika, \"thinks me an unredeemed brute; just because I\ndon't love him. YOU, dear Mr. MacQuern--does one call you 'Mr.'? 'The'\nwould sound so odd in the vocative. And I can't very well call you\n'MacQuern'--YOU don't think me unkind, do you? I simply can't bear to\nthink of all these young lives cut short without my having done a thing\nto brighten them. What can I do?--what can I do to show my gratitude?\"\n\nAn idea struck her. She looked up to the lit window of her room.\n\"Melisande!\" she called.\n\nA figure appeared at the window. \"Mademoiselle desire?\"\n\n\"My tricks, Melisande! Bring down the box, quick!\" She turned excitedly\nto the two young men. \"It is all I can do in return, you see. If I could\ndance for them, I would. If I could sing, I would sing to them. I do\nwhat I can. You,\" she said to the Duke, \"must go on to the platform and\nannounce it.\"\n\n\"Announce what?\"\n\n\"Why, that I am going to do my tricks! All you need say is 'Ladies and\ngentlemen, I have the pleasure to--' What is the matter now?\"\n\n\"You make me feel slightly unwell,\" said the Duke.\n\n\"And YOU are the most d-dis-disobliging and the unkindest and the\nb-beastliest person I ever met,\" Zuleika sobbed at him through her\nhands. The MacQuern glared reproaches at him. So did Melisande, who had\njust appeared through the postern, holding in her arms the great casket\nof malachite. A painful scene; and the Duke gave in. He said he would do\nanything--anything. Peace was restored.\n\nThe MacQuern had relieved Melisande of her burden; and to him was the\nprivilege of bearing it, in procession with his adored and her quelled\nmentor, towards the Hall.\n\nZuleika babbled like a child going to a juvenile party. This was the\ngreat night, as yet, in her life. Illustrious enough already it had\nseemed to her, as eve of that ultimate flattery vowed her by the Duke.\nSo fine a thing had his doom seemed to her--his doom alone--that it had\nsufficed to flood her pink pearl with the right hue. And now not on him\nalone need she ponder. Now he was but the centre of a group--a group\nthat might grow and grow--a group that might with a little encouragement\nbe a multitude... With such hopes dimly whirling in the recesses of her\nsoul, her beautiful red lips babbled.\n\n\n\n\nX\n\nSounds of a violin, drifting out through the open windows of the\nHall, suggested that the second part of the concert had begun. All the\nundergraduates, however, except the few who figured in the programme,\nhad waited outside till their mistress should re-appear. The sisters\nand cousins of the Judas men had been escorted back to their places and\nhurriedly left there.\n\nIt was a hushed, tense crowd.\n\n\"The poor darlings!\" murmured Zuleika, pausing to survey them. \"And oh,\"\nshe exclaimed, \"there won't be room for all of them in there!\"\n\n\"You might give an 'overflow' performance out here afterwards,\"\nsuggested the Duke, grimly.\n\nThis idea flashed on her a better. Why not give her performance here and\nnow?--now, so eager was she for contact, as it were, with this crowd;\nhere, by moonlight, in the pretty glow of these paper lanterns. Yes,\nshe said, let it be here and now; and she bade the Duke make the\nannouncement.\n\n\"What shall I say?\" he asked. \"'Gentlemen, I have the pleasure to\nannounce that Miss Zuleika Dobson, the world-renowned She-Wizard, will\nnow oblige'? Or shall I call them 'Gents,' tout court?\"\n\nShe could afford to laugh at his ill-humour. She had his promise of\nobedience. She told him to say something graceful and simple.\n\nThe noise of the violin had ceased. There was not a breath of wind. The\ncrowd in the quadrangle was as still and as silent as the night itself.\nNowhere a tremour. And it was borne in on Zuleika that this crowd had\none mind as well as one heart--a common resolve, calm and clear, as well\nas a common passion. No need for her to strengthen the spell now. No\nwaverers here. And thus it came true that gratitude was the sole motive\nfor her display.\n\nShe stood with eyes downcast and hands folded behind her, moonlit in\nthe glow of lanterns, modest to the point of pathos, while the Duke\ngracefully and simply introduced her to the multitude. He was, he said,\nempowered by the lady who stood beside him to say that she would be\npleased to give them an exhibition of her skill in the art to which\nshe had devoted her life--an art which, more potently perhaps than any\nother, touched in mankind the sense of mystery and stirred the faculty\nof wonder; the most truly romantic of all the arts: he referred to the\nart of conjuring. It was not too much to say that by her mastery of this\nart, in which hitherto, it must be confessed, women had made no very\ngreat mark, Miss Zuleika Dobson (for such was the name of the lady who\nstood beside him) had earned the esteem of the whole civilised world.\nAnd here in Oxford, and in this College especially, she had a peculiar\nclaim to--might he say?--their affectionate regard, inasmuch as she was\nthe grand-daughter of their venerable and venerated Warden.\n\nAs the Duke ceased, there came from his hearers a sound like the\nrustling of leaves. In return for it, Zuleika performed that graceful\nact of subsidence to the verge of collapse which is usually kept for the\ndelectation of some royal person. And indeed, in the presence of this\ndoomed congress, she did experience humility; for she was not altogether\nwithout imagination. But, as she arose from her \"bob,\" she was her own\nbold self again, bright mistress of the situation.\n\nIt was impossible for her to give her entertainment in full. Some of her\ntricks (notably the Secret Aquarium, and the Blazing Ball of Worsted)\nneeded special preparation, and a table fitted with a \"servante\" or\nsecret tray. The table for to-night's performance was an ordinary one,\nbrought out from the porter's lodge. The MacQuern deposited on it the\ngreat casket. Zuleika, retaining him as her assistant, picked nimbly\nout from their places and put in array the curious appurtenances of her\nart--the Magic Canister, the Demon Egg-Cup, and the sundry other vessels\nwhich, lost property of young Edward Gibbs, had been by a Romanoff\ntransmuted from wood to gold, and were now by the moon reduced\ntemporarily to silver.\n\nIn a great dense semicircle the young men disposed themselves around\nher. Those who were in front squatted down on the gravel; those who were\nbehind knelt; the rest stood. Young Oxford! Here, in this mass of boyish\nfaces, all fused and obliterated, was the realisation of that phrase.\nTwo or three thousands of human bodies, human souls? Yet the effect of\nthem in the moonlight was as of one great passive monster.\n\nSo was it seen by the Duke, as he stood leaning against the wall,\nbehind Zuleika's table. He saw it as a monster couchant and enchanted,\na monster that was to die; and its death was in part his own doing.\nBut remorse in him gave place to hostility. Zuleika had begun her\nperformance. She was producing the Barber's Pole from her mouth. And\nit was to her that the Duke's heart went suddenly out in tenderness\nand pity. He forgot her levity and vanity--her wickedness, as he had\ninwardly called it. He thrilled with that intense anxiety which comes to\na man when he sees his beloved offering to the public an exhibition of\nher skill, be it in singing, acting, dancing, or any other art. Would\nshe acquit herself well? The lover's trepidation is painful enough when\nthe beloved has genius--how should these clods appreciate her? and who\nset them in judgment over her? It must be worse when the beloved has\nmediocrity. And Zuleika, in conjuring, had rather less than that. Though\nindeed she took herself quite seriously as a conjurer, she brought to\nher art neither conscience nor ambition, in any true sense of those\nwords. Since her debut, she had learned nothing and forgotten nothing.\nThe stale and narrow repertory which she had acquired from Edward Gibbs\nwas all she had to offer; and this, and her marked lack of skill, she\neked out with the self-same \"patter\" that had sufficed that impossible\nyoung man. It was especially her jokes that now sent shudders up the\nspine of her lover, and brought tears to his eyes, and kept him in\na state of terror as to what she would say next. \"You see,\" she had\nexclaimed lightly after the production of the Barber's Pole, \"how easy\nit is to set up business as a hairdresser.\" Over the Demon Egg-Cup she\nsaid that the egg was \"as good as fresh.\" And her constantly reiterated\ncatch-phrase--\"Well, this is rather queer!\"--was the most distressing\nthing of all.\n\nThe Duke blushed to think what these men thought of her. Would love\nwere blind! These her lovers were doubtless judging her. They forgave\nher--confound their impudence!--because of her beauty. The banality of\nher performance was an added grace. It made her piteous. Damn them, they\nwere sorry for her. Little Noaks was squatting in the front row, peering\nup at her through his spectacles. Noaks was as sorry for her as the rest\nof them. Why didn't the earth yawn and swallow them all up?\n\nOur hero's unreasoning rage was fed by a not unreasonable jealousy. It\nwas clear to him that Zuleika had forgotten his existence. To-day, as\nsoon as he had killed her love, she had shown him how much less to her\nwas his love than the crowd's. And now again it was only the crowd she\ncared for. He followed with his eyes her long slender figure as she\nthreaded her way in and out of the crowd, sinuously, confidingly,\nproducing a penny from one lad's elbow, a threepenny-bit from between\nanother's neck and collar, half a crown from another's hair, and always\nrepeating in that flute-like voice of hers \"Well, this is rather queer!\"\nHither and thither she fared, her neck and arms gleaming white from the\nluminous blackness of her dress, in the luminous blueness of the night.\nAt a distance, she might have been a wraith; or a breeze made visible; a\nvagrom breeze, warm and delicate, and in league with death.\n\nYes, that is how she might have seemed to a casual observer. But to the\nDuke there was nothing weird about her: she was radiantly a woman; a\ngoddess; and his first and last love. Bitter his heart was, but only\nagainst the mob she wooed, not against her for wooing it. She was cruel?\nAll goddesses are that. She was demeaning herself? His soul welled up\nanew in pity, in passion.\n\nYonder, in the Hall, the concert ran its course, making a feeble\nincidental music to the dark emotions of the quadrangle. It ended\nsomewhat before the close of Zuleika's rival show; and then the steps\nfrom the Hall were thronged by ladies, who, with a sprinkling of dons,\nstood in attitudes of refined displeasure and vulgar curiosity. The\nWarden was just awake enough to notice the sea of undergraduates.\nSuspecting some breach of College discipline, he retired hastily to his\nown quarters, for fear his dignity might be somehow compromised.\n\nWas there ever, I wonder, an historian so pure as not to have wished\njust once to fob off on his readers just one bright fable for effect?\nI find myself sorely tempted to tell you that on Zuleika, as her\nentertainment drew to a close, the spirit of the higher thaumaturgy\ndescended like a flame and found in her a worthy agent. Specious\nApollyon whispers to me \"Where would be the harm? Tell your readers\nthat she cast a seed on the ground, and that therefrom presently arose\na tamarind-tree which blossomed and bore fruit and, withering, vanished.\nOr say she conjured from an empty basket of osier a hissing and bridling\nsnake. Why not? Your readers would be excited, gratified. And you would\nnever be found out.\" But the grave eyes of Clio are bent on me, her\nservant. Oh pardon, madam: I did but waver for an instant. It is not too\nlate to tell my readers that the climax of Zuleika's entertainment was\nonly that dismal affair, the Magic Canister.\n\nIt she took from the table, and, holding it aloft, cried \"Now, before I\nsay good night, I want to see if I have your confidence. But you mustn't\nthink this is the confidence trick!\" She handed the vessel to The\nMacQuern, who, looking like an overgrown acolyte, bore it after her as\nshe went again among the audience. Pausing before a man in the front\nrow, she asked him if he would trust her with his watch. He held it\nout to her. \"Thank you,\" she said, letting her fingers touch his for a\nmoment before she dropped it into the Magic Canister. From another man\nshe borrowed a cigarette-case, from another a neck-tie, from another a\npair of sleeve-links, from Noaks a ring--one of those iron rings which\nare supposed, rightly or wrongly, to alleviate rheumatism. And when she\nhad made an ample selection, she began her return-journey to the table.\n\nOn her way she saw in the shadow of the wall the figure of her forgotten\nDuke. She saw him, the one man she had ever loved, also the first\nman who had wished definitely to die for her; and she was touched by\nremorse. She had said she would remember him to her dying day; and\nalready... But had he not refused her the wherewithal to remember\nhim--the pearls she needed as the clou of her dear collection, the great\nrelic among relics?\n\n\"Would you trust me with your studs?\" she asked him, in a voice that\ncould be heard throughout the quadrangle, with a smile that was for him\nalone.\n\nThere was no help for it. He quickly extricated from his shirt-front the\nblack pearl and the pink. Her thanks had a special emphasis.\n\nThe MacQuern placed the Magic Canister before her on the table. She\npressed the outer sheath down on it. Then she inverted it so that the\ncontents fell into the false lid; then she opened it, looked into it,\nand, exclaiming \"Well, this is rather queer!\" held it up so that the\naudience whose intelligence she was insulting might see there was\nnothing in it.\n\n\"Accidents,\" she said, \"will happen in the best-regulated canisters!\nBut I think there is just a chance that I shall be able to restore your\nproperty. Excuse me for a moment.\" She then shut the canister, released\nthe false lid, made several passes over it, opened it, looked into it\nand said with a flourish \"Now I can clear my character!\" Again she went\namong the crowd, attended by The MacQuern; and the loans--priceless now\nbecause she had touched them--were in due course severally restored.\nWhen she took the canister from her acolyte, only the two studs remained\nin it.\n\nNot since the night of her flitting from the Gibbs' humble home had\nZuleika thieved. Was she a back-slider? Would she rob the Duke, and his\nheir-presumptive, and Tanville-Tankertons yet unborn? Alas, yes. But\nwhat she now did was proof that she had qualms. And her way of doing it\nshowed that for legerdemain she had after all a natural aptitude which,\nproperly trained, might have won for her an honourable place in at least\nthe second rank of contemporary prestidigitators. With a gesture of her\ndisengaged hand, so swift as to be scarcely visible, she unhooked her\near-rings and \"passed\" them into the canister. This she did as she\nturned away from the crowd, on her way to the Duke. At the same moment,\nin a manner technically not less good, though morally deplorable, she\nwithdrew the studs and \"vanished\" them into her bosom.\n\nWas it triumph, or shame, or of both a little that so flushed her cheeks\nas she stood before the man she had robbed? Or was it the excitement\nof giving a present to the man she had loved? Certain it is that the\nnakedness of her ears gave a new look to her face--a primitive look,\nopen and sweetly wild. The Duke saw the difference, without noticing\nthe cause. She was more adorable than ever. He blenched and swayed as in\nproximity to a loveliness beyond endurance. His heart cried out within\nhim. A sudden mist came over his eyes.\n\nIn the canister that she held out to him, the two pearls rattled like\ndice.\n\n\"Keep them!\" he whispered.\n\n\"I shall,\" she whispered back, almost shyly. \"But these, these are for\nyou.\" And she took one of his hands, and, holding it open, tilted the\ncanister over it, and let drop into it the two ear-rings, and went\nquickly away.\n\nAs she re-appeared at the table, the crowd gave her a long ovation\nof gratitude for her performance--an ovation all the more impressive\nbecause it was solemn and subdued. She curtseyed again and again, not\nindeed with the timid simplicity of her first obeisance (so familiar\nalready was she with the thought of the crowd's doom), but rather in the\nmanner of a prima donna--chin up, eyelids down, all teeth manifest, and\nhands from the bosom flung ecstatically wide asunder.\n\nYou know how, at a concert, a prima donna who has just sung insists on\nshaking hands with the accompanist, and dragging him forward, to show\nhow beautiful her nature is, into the applause that is for herself\nalone. And your heart, like mine, has gone out to the wretched victim.\nEven so would you have felt for The MacQuern when Zuleika, on the\nimplied assumption that half the credit was his, grasped him by the\nwrist, and, continuing to curtsey, would not release him till the last\nechoes of the clapping had died away.\n\nThe ladies on the steps of the Hall moved down into the quadrangle,\nspreading their resentment like a miasma. The tragic passion of the\ncrowd was merged in mere awkwardness. There was a general movement\ntowards the College gate.\n\nZuleika was putting her tricks back into the great casket, The MacQuern\nassisting her. The Scots, as I have said, are a shy race, but a resolute\nand a self-seeking. This young chieftain had not yet recovered from what\nhis heroine had let him in for. But he did not lose the opportunity of\nasking her to lunch with him to-morrow.\n\n\"Delighted,\" she said, fitting the Demon Egg-Cup into its groove.\nThen, looking up at him, \"Are you popular?\" she asked. \"Have you many\nfriends?\" He nodded. She said he must invite them all.\n\nThis was a blow to the young man, who, at once thrifty and infatuate,\nhad planned a luncheon a deux. \"I had hoped--\" he began.\n\n\"Vainly,\" she cut him short.\n\nThere was a pause. \"Whom shall I invite, then?\"\n\n\"I don't know any of them. How should I have preferences?\" She\nremembered the Duke. She looked round and saw him still standing in the\nshadow of the wall. He came towards her. \"Of course,\" she said hastily\nto her host, \"you must ask HIM.\"\n\nThe MacQuern complied. He turned to the Duke and told him that Miss\nDobson had very kindly promised to lunch with him to-morrow. \"And,\" said\nZuleika, \"I simply WON'T unless you will.\"\n\nThe Duke looked at her. Had it not been arranged that he and she should\nspend his last day together? Did it mean nothing that she had given him\nher ear-rings? Quickly drawing about him some remnants of his tattered\npride, he hid his wound, and accepted the invitation.\n\n\"It seems a shame,\" said Zuleika to The MacQuern, \"to ask you to bring\nthis great heavy box all the way back again. But--\"\n\nThose last poor rags of pride fell away now. The Duke threw a prehensile\nhand on the casket, and, coldly glaring at The MacQuern, pointed with\nhis other hand towards the College gate. He, and he alone, was going to\nsee Zuleika home. It was his last night on earth, and he was not to be\ntrifled with. Such was the message of his eyes. The Scotsman's flashed\nback a precisely similar message.\n\nMen had fought for Zuleika, but never in her presence. Her eyes dilated.\nShe had not the slightest impulse to throw herself between the two\nantagonists. Indeed, she stepped back, so as not to be in the way. A\nshort sharp fight--how much better that is than bad blood! She hoped the\nbetter man would win; and (do not misjudge her) she rather hoped this\nman was the Duke. It occurred to her--a vague memory of some play or\npicture--that she ought to be holding aloft a candelabra of lit tapers;\nno, that was only done indoors, and in the eighteenth century. Ought\nshe to hold a sponge? Idle, these speculations of hers, and based on\ncomplete ignorance of the manners and customs of undergraduates. The\nDuke and The MacQuern would never have come to blows in the presence of\na lady. Their conflict was necessarily spiritual.\n\nAnd it was the Scotsman, Scots though he was, who had to yield. Cowed\nby something demoniac in the will-power pitted against his, he found\nhimself retreating in the direction indicated by the Duke's forefinger.\n\nAs he disappeared into the porch, Zuleika turned to the Duke. \"You were\nsplendid,\" she said softly. He knew that very well. Does the stag in his\nhour of victory need a diploma from the hind? Holding in his hands the\nmalachite casket that was the symbol of his triumph, the Duke smiled\ndictatorially at his darling. He came near to thinking of her as a\nchattel. Then with a pang he remembered his abject devotion to her.\nAbject no longer though! The victory he had just won restored his\nmanhood, his sense of supremacy among his fellows. He loved this woman\non equal terms. She was transcendent? So was he, Dorset. To-night\nthe world had on its moonlit surface two great ornaments--Zuleika and\nhimself. Neither of the pair could be replaced. Was one of them to be\nshattered? Life and love were good. He had been mad to think of dying.\n\nNo word was spoken as they went together to Salt Cellar. She expected\nhim to talk about her conjuring tricks. Could he have been disappointed?\nShe dared not inquire; for she had the sensitiveness, though no other\nquality whatsoever, of the true artist. She felt herself aggrieved. She\nhad half a mind to ask him to give her back her ear-rings. And by the\nway, he hadn't yet thanked her for them! Well, she would make allowances\nfor a condemned man. And again she remembered the omen of which he had\ntold her. She looked at him, and then up into the sky. \"This same moon,\"\nshe said to herself, \"sees the battlements of Tankerton. Does she see\ntwo black owls there? Does she hear them hooting?\"\n\nThey were in Salt Cellar now. \"Melisande!\" she called up to her window.\n\n\"Hush!\" said the Duke, \"I have something to say to you.\"\n\n\"Well, you can say it all the better without that great box in your\nhands. I want my maid to carry it up to my room for me.\" And again she\ncalled out for Melisande, and received no answer. \"I suppose she's in\nthe house-keeper's room or somewhere. You had better put the box down\ninside the door. She can bring it up later.\"\n\nShe pushed open the postern; and the Duke, as he stepped across the\nthreshold, thrilled with a romantic awe. Re-emerging a moment later into\nthe moonlight, he felt that she had been right about the box: it was\nfatal to self-expression; and he was glad he had not tried to speak\non the way from the Front Quad: the soul needs gesture; and the Duke's\nfirst gesture now was to seize Zuleika's hands in his.\n\nShe was too startled to move. \"Zuleika!\" he whispered. She was too angry\nto speak, but with a sudden twist she freed her wrists and darted back.\n\nHe laughed. \"You are afraid of me. You are afraid to let me kiss you,\nbecause you are afraid of loving me. This afternoon--here--I all but\nkissed you. I mistook you for Death. I was enamoured of Death. I was a\nfool. That is what YOU are, you incomparable darling: you are a fool.\nYou are afraid of life. I am not. I love life. I am going to live for\nyou, do you hear?\"\n\nShe stood with her back to the postern. Anger in her eyes had given\nplace to scorn. \"You mean,\" she said, \"that you go back on your\npromise?\"\n\n\"You will release me from it.\"\n\n\"You mean you are afraid to die?\"\n\n\"You will not be guilty of my death. You love me.\"\n\n\"Good night, you miserable coward.\" She stepped back through the\npostern.\n\n\"Don't, Zuleika! Miss Dobson, don't! Pull yourself together! Reflect! I\nimplore you... You will repent...\"\n\nSlowly she closed the postern on him.\n\n\"You will repent. I shall wait here, under your window...\"\n\nHe heard a bolt rasped into its socket. He heard the retreat of a light\ntread on the paven hall.\n\nAnd he hadn't even kissed her! That was his first thought. He ground his\nheel in the gravel.\n\nAnd he had hurt her wrists! This was Zuleika's first thought, as she\ncame into her bedroom. Yes, there were two red marks where he had\nheld her. No man had ever dared to lay hands on her. With a sense of\ncontamination, she proceeded to wash her hands thoroughly with soap and\nwater. From time to time such words as \"cad\" and \"beast\" came through\nher teeth.\n\nShe dried her hands and flung herself into a chair, arose and went\npacing the room. So this was the end of her great night! What had she\ndone to deserve it? How had he dared?\n\nThere was a sound as of rain against the window. She was glad. The night\nneeded cleansing.\n\nHe had told her she was afraid of life. Life!--to have herself caressed\nby HIM; humbly to devote herself to being humbly doted on; to be the\nslave of a slave; to swim in a private pond of treacle--ugh! If the\nthought weren't so cloying and degrading, it would be laughable.\n\nFor a moment her hands hovered over those two golden and gemmed volumes\nencasing Bradshaw and the A.B.C. Guide. To leave Oxford by an early\ntrain, leave him to drown unthanked, unlooked at... But this could\nnot be done without slighting all those hundreds of other men ... And\nbesides...\n\nAgain that sound on the window-pane. This time it startled her. There\nseemed to be no rain. Could it have been--little bits of gravel? She\ndarted noiselessly to the window, pushed it open, and looked down. She\nsaw the upturned face of the Duke. She stepped back, trembling with\nfury, staring around her. Inspiration came.\n\nShe thrust her head out again. \"Are you there?\" she whispered.\n\n\"Yes, yes. I knew you would come.\"\n\n\"Wait a moment, wait!\"\n\nThe water-jug stood where she had left it, on the floor by the\nwash-stand. It was almost full, rather heavy. She bore it steadily to\nthe window, and looked out.\n\n\"Come a little nearer!\" she whispered.\n\nThe upturned and moonlit face obeyed her. She saw its lips forming the\nword \"Zuleika.\" She took careful aim.\n\nFull on the face crashed the cascade of moonlit water, shooting out on\nall sides like the petals of some great silver anemone.\n\nShe laughed shrilly as she leapt back, letting the empty jug roll over\non the carpet. Then she stood tense, crouching, her hands to her mouth,\nher eyes askance, as much as to say \"Now I've done it!\" She listened\nhard, holding her breath. In the stillness of the night was a faint\nsound of dripping water, and presently of footsteps going away. Then\nstillness unbroken.\n\n\n\n\nXI\n\nI said that I was Clio's servant. And I felt, when I said it, that you\nlooked at me dubiously, and murmured among yourselves.\n\nNot that you doubted I was somewhat connected with Clio's household. The\nlady after whom I have named this book is alive, and well known to some\nof you personally, to all of you by repute. Nor had you finished my\nfirst page before you guessed my theme to be that episode in her life\nwhich caused so great a sensation among the newspaper-reading public a\nfew years ago. (It all seems but yesterday, does it not? They are still\nvivid to us, those head-lines. We have hardly yet ceased to be edified\nby the morals pointed in those leading articles.) And yet very soon you\nfound me behaving just like any novelist--reporting the exact words\nthat passed between the protagonists at private interviews--aye, and the\nexact thoughts and emotions that were in their breasts. Little wonder\nthat you wondered! Let me make things clear to you.\n\nI have my mistress' leave to do this. At first (for reasons which you\nwill presently understand) she demurred. But I pointed out to her that I\nhad been placed in a false position, and that until this were rectified\nneither she nor I could reap the credit due to us.\n\nKnow, then, that for a long time Clio had been thoroughly discontented.\nShe was happy enough, she says, when first she left the home of Pierus,\nher father, to become a Muse. On those humble beginnings she looks\nback with affection. She kept only one servant, Herodotus. The romantic\nelement in him appealed to her. He died, and she had about her a large\nstaff of able and faithful servants, whose way of doing their work\nirritated and depressed her. To them, apparently, life consisted of\nnothing but politics and military operations--things to which she, being\na woman, was somewhat indifferent. She was jealous of Melpomene. It\nseemed to her that her own servants worked from without at a mass of dry\ndetails which might as well be forgotten. Melpomene's worked on material\nthat was eternally interesting--the souls of men and women; and not\nfrom without, either; but rather casting themselves into those souls\nand showing to us the essence of them. She was particularly struck by a\nremark of Aristotle's, that tragedy was \"more philosophic\" than history,\ninasmuch as it concerned itself with what might be, while history was\nconcerned with merely what had been. This summed up for her what she\nhad often felt, but could not have exactly formulated. She saw that the\ndepartment over which she presided was at best an inferior one. She saw\nthat just what she had liked--and rightly liked--in poor dear Herodotus\nwas just what prevented him from being a good historian. It was wrong to\nmix up facts and fancies. But why should her present servants deal with\nonly one little special set of the variegated facts of life? It was not\nin her power to interfere. The Nine, by the terms of the charter\nthat Zeus had granted to them, were bound to leave their servants an\nabsolutely free hand. But Clio could at least refrain from reading the\nworks which, by a legal fiction, she was supposed to inspire. Once or\ntwice in the course of a century, she would glance into this or that new\nhistory book, only to lay it down with a shrug of her shoulders. Some\nof the mediaeval chronicles she rather liked. But when, one day, Pallas\nasked her what she thought of \"The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire\"\nher only answer was \"ostis toia echei en edone echei en edone toia\"\n(For people who like that kind of thing, that is the kind of thing they\nlike). This she did let slip. Generally, throughout all the centuries,\nshe kept up a pretence of thinking history the greatest of all the arts.\nShe always held her head high among her Sisters. It was only on the\nsly that she was an omnivorous reader of dramatic and lyric poetry.\nShe watched with keen interest the earliest developments of the prose\nromance in southern Europe; and after the publication of \"Clarissa\nHarlowe\" she spent practically all her time in reading novels. It was\nnot until the Spring of the year 1863 that an entirely new element\nforced itself into her peaceful life. Zeus fell in love with her.\n\nTo us, for whom so quickly \"time doth transfix the flourish set on\nyouth,\" there is something strange, even a trifle ludicrous, in the\nthought that Zeus, after all these years, is still at the beck and call\nof his passions. And it seems anyhow lamentable that he has not yet\ngained self-confidence enough to appear in his own person to the lady\nof his choice, and is still at pains to transform himself into whatever\nobject he deems likeliest to please her. To Clio, suddenly from Olympus,\nhe flashed down in the semblance of Kinglake's \"Invasion of the Crimea\"\n(four vols., large 8vo, half-calf). She saw through his disguise\nimmediately, and, with great courage and independence, bade him begone.\nRebuffed, he was not deflected. Indeed it would seem that Clio's high\nspirit did but sharpen his desire. Hardly a day passed but he appeared\nin what he hoped would be the irresistible form--a recently discovered\nfragment of Polybius, an advance copy of the forthcoming issue of \"The\nHistorical Review,\" the note-book of Professor Carl Voertschlaffen...\nOne day, all-prying Hermes told him of Clio's secret addiction to\nnovel-reading. Thenceforth, year in, year out, it was in the form of\nfiction that Zeus wooed her. The sole result was that she grew sick of\nthe sight of novels, and found a perverse pleasure in reading history.\nThese dry details of what had actually happened were a relief, she told\nherself, from all that make-believe.\n\nOne Sunday afternoon--the day before that very Monday on which this\nnarrative opens--it occurred to her how fine a thing history might be if\nthe historian had the novelist's privileges. Suppose he could be present\nat every scene which he was going to describe, a presence invisible and\ninevitable, and equipped with power to see into the breasts of all the\npersons whose actions he set himself to watch...\n\nWhile the Muse was thus musing, Zeus (disguised as Miss Annie S. Swan's\nlatest work) paid his usual visit. She let her eyes rest on him. Hither\nand thither she divided her swift mind, and addressed him in winged\nwords. \"Zeus, father of gods and men, cloud-compeller, what wouldst thou\nof me? But first will I say what I would of thee\"; and she besought him\nto extend to the writers of history such privileges as are granted to\nnovelists. His whole manner had changed. He listened to her with the\nmassive gravity of a ruler who never yet has allowed private influence\nto obscure his judgment. He was silent for some time after her appeal.\nThen, in a voice of thunder, which made quake the slopes of Parnassus,\nhe gave his answer. He admitted the disabilities under which historians\nlaboured. But the novelists--were they not equally handicapped? They had\nto treat of persons who never existed, events which never were. Only\nby the privilege of being in the thick of those events, and in the very\nbowels of those persons, could they hope to hold the reader's attention.\nIf similar privileges were granted to the historian, the demand for\nnovels would cease forthwith, and many thousand of hard-working,\ndeserving men and women would be thrown out of employment. In fact, Clio\nhad asked him an impossible favour. But he might--he said he conceivably\nmight--be induced to let her have her way just once. In that event, all\nshe would have to do was to keep her eye on the world's surface, and\nthen, so soon as she had reason to think that somewhere was impending\nsomething of great import, to choose an historian. On him, straightway,\nZeus would confer invisibility, inevitability, and psychic penetration,\nwith a flawless memory thrown in.\n\nOn the following afternoon, Clio's roving eye saw Zuleika stepping from\nthe Paddington platform into the Oxford train. A few moments later I\nfound myself suddenly on Parnassus. In hurried words Clio told me how I\ncame there, and what I had to do. She said she had selected me because\nshe knew me to be honest, sober, and capable, and no stranger to Oxford.\nAnother moment, and I was at the throne of Zeus. With a majesty of\ngesture which I shall never forget, he stretched his hand over me, and I\nwas indued with the promised gifts. And then, lo! I was on the platform\nof Oxford station. The train was not due for another hour. But the time\npassed pleasantly enough.\n\nIt was fun to float all unseen, to float all unhampered by any corporeal\nnonsense, up and down the platform. It was fun to watch the inmost\nthoughts of the station-master, of the porters, of the young person at\nthe buffet. But of course I did not let the holiday-mood master me. I\nrealised the seriousness of my mission. I must concentrate myself on\nthe matter in hand: Miss Dobson's visit. What was going to happen?\nPrescience was no part of my outfit. From what I knew about Miss Dobson,\nI deduced that she would be a great success. That was all. Had I had the\ninstinct that was given to those Emperors in stone, and even to the\ndog Corker, I should have begged Clio to send in my stead some man of\nstronger nerve. She had charged me to be calmly vigilant, scrupulously\nfair. I could have been neither, had I from the outset foreseen all.\nOnly because the immediate future was broken to me by degrees, first as\na set of possibilities, then as a set of probabilities that yet might\nnot come off, was I able to fulfil the trust imposed in me. Even so, it\nwas hard. I had always accepted the doctrine that to understand all is\nto forgive all. Thanks to Zeus, I understood all about Miss Dobson, and\nyet there were moments when she repelled me--moments when I wished to\nsee her neither from without nor from within. So soon as the Duke of\nDorset met her on the Monday night, I felt I was in duty bound to keep\nhim under constant surveillance. Yet there were moments when I was so\nsorry for him that I deemed myself a brute for shadowing him.\n\nEver since I can remember, I have been beset by a recurring doubt as\nto whether I be or be not quite a gentleman. I have never attempted to\ndefine that term: I have but feverishly wondered whether in its usual\nacceptation (whatever that is) it be strictly applicable to myself. Many\npeople hold that the qualities connoted by it are primarily moral--a\nkind heart, honourable conduct, and so forth. On Clio's mission, I found\nhonour and kindness tugging me in precisely opposite directions. In so\nfar as honour tugged the harder, was I the more or the less gentlemanly?\nBut the test is not a fair one. Curiosity tugged on the side of honour.\nThis goes to prove me a cad? Oh, set against it the fact that I did\nat one point betray Clio's trust. When Miss Dobson had done the deed\nrecorded at the close of the foregoing chapter, I gave the Duke of\nDorset an hour's grace.\n\nI could have done no less. In the lives of most of us is some one thing\nthat we would not after the lapse of how many years soever confess to\nour most understanding friend; the thing that does not bear thinking\nof; the one thing to be forgotten; the unforgettable thing. Not\nthe commission of some great crime: this can be atoned for by great\npenances; and the very enormity of it has a dark grandeur. Maybe, some\nlittle deadly act of meanness, some hole-and-corner treachery? But\nwhat a man has once willed to do, his will helps him to forget. The\nunforgettable thing in his life is usually not a thing he has done or\nleft undone, but a thing done to him--some insolence or cruelty for\nwhich he could not, or did not, avenge himself. This it is that often\ncomes back to him, years after, in his dreams, and thrusts itself\nsuddenly into his waking thoughts, so that he clenches his hands, and\nshakes his head, and hums a tune loudly--anything to beat it off. In the\nvery hour when first befell him that odious humiliation, would you have\nspied on him? I gave the Duke of Dorset an hour's grace.\n\nWhat were his thoughts in that interval, what words, if any, he uttered\nto the night, never will be known. For this, Clio has abused me in\nlanguage less befitting a Muse than a fishwife. I do not care. I would\nrather be chidden by Clio than by my own sense of delicacy, any day.\n\n\n\n\nXII\n\nNot less averse than from dogging the Duke was I from remaining another\ninstant in the presence of Miss Dobson. There seemed to be no possible\nexcuse for her. This time she had gone too far. She was outrageous. As\nsoon as the Duke had had time to get clear away, I floated out into the\nnight.\n\nI may have consciously reasoned that the best way to forget the present\nwas in the revival of memories. Or I may have been driven by a mere\nhoming instinct. Anyhow, it was in the direction of my old College that\nI went. Midnight was tolling as I floated in through the shut grim gate\nat which I had so often stood knocking for admission.\n\nThe man who now occupied my room had sported his oak--my oak. I read the\nname on the visiting-card attached thereto--E. J. Craddock--and went in.\n\nE. J. Craddock, interloper, was sitting at my table, with elbows squared\nand head on one side, in the act of literary composition. The oars and\ncaps on my walls betokened him a rowing-man. Indeed, I recognised his\nsomewhat heavy face as that of the man whom, from the Judas barge this\nafternoon, I had seen rowing \"stroke\" in my College Eight.\n\nHe ought, therefore, to have been in bed and asleep two hours ago. And\nthe offence of his vigil was aggravated by a large tumbler that stood\nin front of him, containing whisky and soda. From this he took a deep\ndraught. Then he read over what he had written. I did not care to peer\nover his shoulder at MS. which, though written in my room, was not\nintended for my eyes. But the writer's brain was open to me; and he had\nwritten \"I, the undersigned Edward Joseph Craddock, do hereby leave and\nbequeath all my personal and other property to Zuleika Dobson, spinster.\nThis is my last will and testament.\"\n\nHe gnawed his pen, and presently altered the \"hereby leave\" to \"hereby\nand herewith leave.\" Fool!\n\nI thereby and therewith left him. As I emerged through the floor of the\nroom above--through the very carpet that had so often been steeped in\nwine, and encrusted with smithereens of glass, in the brave old days\nof a well-remembered occupant--I found two men, both of them evidently\nreading-men. One of them was pacing round the room. \"Do you know,\" he\nwas saying, \"what she reminded me of, all the time? Those words--aren't\nthey in the Song of Solomon?--'fair as the moon, clear as the sun,\nand... and...'\"\n\n\"'Terrible as an army with banners,'\" supplied his host--rather testily,\nfor he was writing a letter. It began \"My dear Father. By the time you\nreceive this I shall have taken a step which...\"\n\nClearly it was vain to seek distraction in my old College. I floated out\ninto the untenanted meadows. Over them was the usual coverlet of white\nvapour, trailed from the Isis right up to Merton Wall. The scent of\nthese meadows' moisture is the scent of Oxford. Even in hottest noon,\none feels that the sun has not dried THEM. Always there is moisture\ndrifting across them, drifting into the Colleges. It, one suspects,\nmust have had much to do with the evocation of what is called the Oxford\nspirit--that gentlest spirit, so lingering and searching, so dear to\nthem who as youths were brought into ken of it, so exasperating to them\nwho were not. Yes, certainly, it is this mild, miasmal air, not less\nthan the grey beauty and gravity of the buildings, that has helped\nOxford to produce, and foster eternally, her peculiar race of\nartist-scholars, scholar-artists. The undergraduate, in his brief\nperiods of residence, is too buoyant to be mastered by the spirit of\nthe place. He does but salute it, and catch the manner. It is on him\nwho stays to spend his maturity here that the spirit will in its fulness\ngradually descend. The buildings and their traditions keep astir in his\nmind whatsoever is gracious; the climate, enfolding and enfeebling him,\nlulling him, keeps him careless of the sharp, harsh, exigent realities\nof the outer world. Careless? Not utterly. These realities may be seen\nby him. He may study them, be amused or touched by them. But they cannot\nfire him. Oxford is too damp for that. The \"movements\" made there have\nbeen no more than protests against the mobility of others. They have\nbeen without the dynamic quality implied in their name. They have been\nno more than the sighs of men gazing at what other men had left behind\nthem; faint, impossible appeals to the god of retrogression, uttered for\ntheir own sake and ritual, rather than with any intent that they should\nbe heard. Oxford, that lotus-land, saps the will-power, the power\nof action. But, in doing so, it clarifies the mind, makes larger the\nvision, gives, above all, that playful and caressing suavity of manner\nwhich comes of a conviction that nothing matters, except ideas, and that\nnot even ideas are worth dying for, inasmuch as the ghosts of them slain\nseem worthy of yet more piously elaborate homage than can be given to\nthem in their heyday. If the Colleges could be transferred to the dry\nand bracing top of some hill, doubtless they would be more evidently\nuseful to the nation. But let us be glad there is no engineer or\nenchanter to compass that task. Egomet, I would liefer have the rest of\nEngland subside into the sea than have Oxford set on a salubrious level.\nFor there is nothing in England to be matched with what lurks in the\nvapours of these meadows, and in the shadows of these spires--that\nmysterious, inenubilable spirit, spirit of Oxford. Oxford! The very\nsight of the word printed, or sound of it spoken, is fraught for me with\nmost actual magic.\n\nAnd on that moonlit night when I floated among the vapours of these\nmeadows, myself less than a vapour, I knew and loved Oxford as never\nbefore, as never since. Yonder, in the Colleges, was the fume and fret\nof tragedy--Love as Death's decoy, and Youth following her. What then?\nNot Oxford was menaced. Come what might, not a stone of Oxford's walls\nwould be loosened, nor a wreath of her vapours be undone, nor lost a\nbreath of her sacred spirit.\n\nI floated up into the higher, drier air, that I might, for once, see the\ntotal body of that spirit.\n\nThere lay Oxford far beneath me, like a map in grey and black and\nsilver. All that I had known only as great single things I saw now\noutspread in apposition, and tiny; tiny symbols, as it were, of\nthemselves, greatly symbolising their oneness. There they lay, these\nmultitudinous and disparate quadrangles, all their rivalries merged in\nthe making of a great catholic pattern. And the roofs of the buildings\naround them seemed level with their lawns. No higher the roofs of the\nvery towers. Up from their tiny segment of the earth's spinning surface\nthey stood negligible beneath infinity. And new, too, quite new, in\neternity; transient upstarts. I saw Oxford as a place that had no more\npast and no more future than a mining-camp. I smiled down. O hoary and\nunassailable mushroom!... But if a man carry his sense of proportion far\nenough, lo! he is back at the point from which he started. He knows\nthat eternity, as conceived by him, is but an instant in eternity, and\ninfinity but a speck in infinity. How should they belittle the things\nnear to him?... Oxford was venerable and magical, after all, and\nenduring. Aye, and not because she would endure was it the less\nlamentable that the young lives within her walls were like to be taken.\nMy equanimity was gone; and a tear fell on Oxford.\n\nAnd then, as though Oxford herself were speaking up to me, the air\nvibrated with a sweet noise of music. It was the hour of one; the end\nof the Duke's hour of grace. Through the silvery tangle of sounds from\nother clocks I floated quickly down to the Broad.\n\n\n\n\nXIII\n\nI had on the way a horrible apprehension. What if the Duke, in his\nagony, had taken the one means to forgetfulness? His room, I could see,\nwas lit up; but a man does not necessarily choose to die in the dark. I\nhovered, afraid, over the dome of the Sheldonian. I saw that the window\nof the room above the Duke's was also lit up. And there was no reason\nat all to doubt the survival of Noaks. Perhaps the sight of him would\nhearten me.\n\nI was wrong. The sight of Noaks in his room was as dismal a thing as\ncould be. With his chin sunk on his breast, he sat there, on a rickety\nchair, staring up at the mantel-piece. This he had decked out as a sort\nof shrine. In the centre, aloft on an inverted tin that had contained\nAbernethy biscuits, stood a blue plush frame, with an inner rim of\nbrass, several sizes too big for the picture-postcard installed in it.\nZuleika's image gazed forth with a smile that was obviously not intended\nfor the humble worshipper at this execrable shrine. On either side\nof her stood a small vase, one holding some geraniums, the other some\nmignonette. And just beneath her was placed that iron ring which,\nrightly or wrongly, Noaks supposed to alleviate rheumatism--that same\niron ring which, by her touch to-night, had been charged for him with a\nyet deeper magic, insomuch that he dared no longer wear it, and had set\nit before her as an oblation.\n\nYet, for all his humility, he was possessed by a spirit of egoism that\nrepelled me. While he sat peering over his spectacles at the beauteous\nimage, he said again and again to himself, in a hollow voice, \"I am so\nyoung to die.\" Every time he said this, two large, pear-shaped\ntears emerged from behind his spectacles, and found their way to\nhis waistcoat. It did not seem to strike him that quite half of\nthe undergraduates who contemplated death--and contemplated it in a\nfearless, wholesome, manly fashion--were his juniors. It seemed to seem\nto him that his own death, even though all those other far brighter\nand more promising lives than his were to be sacrificed, was a thing to\nbother about. Well, if he did not want to die, why could he not have,\nat least, the courage of his cowardice? The world would not cease to\nrevolve because Noaks still clung to its surface. For me the whole\ntragedy was cheapened by his participation in it. I was fain to\nleave him. His squint, his short legs dangling towards the floor, his\ntear-sodden waistcoat, and his refrain \"I am so young to die,\" were\nbeyond measure exasperating. Yet I hesitated to pass into the room\nbeneath, for fear of what I might see there.\n\nHow long I might have paltered, had no sound come from that room, I\nknow not. But a sound came, sharp and sudden in the night, instantly\nreassuring. I swept down into the presence of the Duke.\n\nHe stood with his head flung back and his arms folded, gorgeous in a\ndressing-gown of crimson brocade. In animation of pride and pomp,\nhe looked less like a mortal man than like a figure from some great\nbiblical group by Paul Veronese.\n\nAnd this was he whom I had presumed to pity! And this was he whom I had\nhalf expected to find dead.\n\nHis face, usually pale, was now red; and his hair, which no eye had ever\nyet seen disordered, stood up in a glistening shock. These two changes\nin him intensified the effect of vitality. One of them, however,\nvanished as I watched it. The Duke's face resumed its pallor. I realised\nthen that he had but blushed; and I realised, simultaneously, that what\nhad called that blush to his cheek was what had also been the signal to\nme that he was alive. His blush had been a pendant to his sneeze. And\nhis sneeze had been a pendant to that outrage which he had been striving\nto forget. He had caught cold.\n\nHe had caught cold. In the hour of his soul's bitter need, his body had\nbeen suborned against him. Base! Had he not stripped his body of its\nwet vesture? Had he not vigorously dried his hair, and robed himself in\ncrimson, and struck in solitude such attitudes as were most congruous\nwith his high spirit and high rank? He had set himself to crush\nremembrance of that by which through his body his soul had been\nassailed. And well had he known that in this conflict a giant demon was\nhis antagonist. But that his own body would play traitor--no, this he\nhad not foreseen. This was too base a thing to be foreseen.\n\nHe stood quite still, a figure orgulous and splendent. And it seemed as\nthough the hot night, too, stood still, to watch him, in awe, through\nthe open lattices of his window, breathlessly. But to me, equipped\nto see beneath the surface, he was piteous, piteous in ratio to the\npretension of his aspect. Had he crouched down and sobbed, I should have\nbeen as much relieved as he. But he stood seignorial and aquiline.\n\nPainless, by comparison with this conflict in him, seemed the conflict\nthat had raged in him yesternight. Then, it had been his dandihood\nagainst his passion for Zuleika. What mattered the issue? Whichever\nwon, the victory were sweet. And of this he had all the while been\nsubconscious, gallantly though he fought for his pride of dandihood.\nTo-night in the battle between pride and memory, he knew from the outset\nthat pride's was but a forlorn hope, and that memory would be barbarous\nin her triumph. Not winning to oblivion, he must hate with a fathomless\nhatred. Of all the emotions, hatred is the most excruciating. Of all\nthe objects of hatred, a woman once loved is the most hateful. Of all\ndeaths, the bitterest that can befall a man is that he lay down his life\nto flatter the woman he deems vilest of her sex.\n\nSuch was the death that the Duke of Dorset saw confronting him. Most\nmen, when they are at war with the past, have the future as ally.\nLooking steadfastly forward, they can forget. The Duke's future was\nopenly in league with his past. For him, prospect was memory. All\nthat there was for him of future was the death to which his honour was\npledged. To envisage that was to... no, he would NOT envisage it! With a\npassionate effort he hypnotised himself to think of nothing at all. His\nbrain, into which, by the power Zeus gave me, I was gazing, became a\nperfect vacuum, insulated by the will. It was the kind of experiment\nwhich scientists call \"beautiful.\" And yes, beautiful it was.\n\nBut not in the eyes of Nature. She abhors a vacuum. Seeing the enormous\nodds against which the Duke was fighting, she might well have stood\naside. But she has no sense of sport whatsoever. She stepped in.\n\nAt first I did not realise what was happening. I saw the Duke's eyes\ncontract, and the muscles of his mouth drawn down, and, at the same\ntime, a tense upward movement of his whole body. Then, suddenly, the\nstrain undone: a downward dart of the head, a loud percussion. Thrice\nthe Duke sneezed, with a sound that was as the bursting of the dams of\nbody and soul together; then sneezed again.\n\nNow was his will broken. He capitulated. In rushed shame and horror and\nhatred, pell-mell, to ravage him.\n\nWhat care now, what use, for deportment? He walked coweringly round and\nround his room, with frantic gestures, with head bowed. He shuffled and\nslunk. His dressing-gown had the look of a gabardine.\n\nShame and horror and hatred went slashing and hewing throughout the\nfallen citadel. At length, exhausted, he flung himself down on the\nwindow-seat and leaned out into the night, panting. The air was full of\nthunder. He clutched at his throat. From the depths of the black caverns\nbeneath their brows the eyes of the unsleeping Emperors watched him.\n\nHe had gone through much in the day that was past. He had loved and\nlost. He had striven to recapture, and had failed. In a strange resolve\nhe had found serenity and joy. He had been at the point of death, and\nhad been saved. He had seen that his beloved was worthless, and he had\nnot cared. He had fought for her, and conquered; and had pled with her,\nand--all these memories were loathsome by reason of that final thing\nwhich had all the while lain in wait for him.\n\nHe looked back and saw himself as he had been at a score of crucial\nmoments in the day--always in the shadow of that final thing. He saw\nhimself as he had been on the playing-fields of Eton; aye! and in the\narms of his nurse, to and fro on the terrace of Tankerton--always in the\nshadow of that final thing, always piteous and ludicrous, doomed. Thank\nheaven the future was unknowable? It wasn't, now. To-morrow--to-day--he\nmust die for that accursed fiend of a woman--the woman with the hyena\nlaugh.\n\nWhat to do meanwhile? Impossible to sleep. He felt in his body the\nstrain of his quick sequence of spiritual adventures. He was dog-tired.\nBut his brain was furiously out of hand: no stopping it. And the night\nwas stifling. And all the while, in the dead silence, as though his soul\nhad ears, there was a sound. It was a very faint, unearthly sound, and\nseemed to come from nowhere, yet to have a meaning. He feared he was\nrather over-wrought.\n\nHe must express himself. That would soothe him. Ever since childhood\nhe had had, from time to time, the impulse to set down in writing\nhis thoughts or his moods. In such exercises he had found for his\nself-consciousness the vent which natures less reserved than his find in\ncasual talk with Tom, Dick and Harry, with Jane, Susan, and Liz. Aloof\nfrom either of these triads, he had in his first term at Eton taken to\nhimself as confidant, and retained ever since, a great quarto volume,\nbound in red morocco and stamped with his coronet and cypher. It was\nherein, year by year, that his soul spread itself.\n\nHe wrote mostly in English prose; but other modes were not infrequent.\nWhenever he was abroad, it was his courteous habit to write in the\nlanguage of the country where he was residing--French, when he was in\nhis house on the Champs Elysees; Italian, when he was in his villa at\nBaiae; and so on. When he was in his own country he felt himself free to\ndeviate sometimes from the vernacular into whatever language were aptest\nto his frame of mind. In his sterner moods he gravitated to Latin,\nand wrought the noble iron of that language to effects that were, if\nanything, a trifle over-impressive. He found for his highest flights of\ncontemplation a handy vehicle in Sanscrit. In hours of mere joy it was\nGreek poetry that flowed likeliest from his pen; and he had a special\nfondness for the metre of Alcaeus.\n\nAnd now, too, in his darkest hour, it was Greek that surged in\nhim--iambics of thunderous wrath such as those which are volleyed by\nPrometheus. But as he sat down to his writing-table, and unlocked the\ndear old album, and dipped his pen in the ink, a great calm fell on him.\nThe iambics in him began to breathe such sweetness as is on the lips of\nAlcestis going to her doom. But, just as he set pen to paper, his hand\nfaltered, and he sprang up, victim of another and yet more violent fit\nof sneezing.\n\nDisbuskined, dangerous. The spirit of Juvenal woke in him. He would\nflay. He would make Woman (as he called Zuleika) writhe. Latin\nhexameters, of course. An epistle to his heir presumptive... \"Vae tibi,\"\nhe began,\n\n     \"Vae tibi, vae misero, nisi circumspexeris artes\n     Femineas, nam nulla salus quin femina possit\n     Tradere, nulla fides quin\"--\n\n\"Quin,\" he repeated. In writing soliloquies, his trouble was to\ncurb inspiration. The thought that he was addressing his\nheir-presumptive--now heir-only-too-apparent--gave him pause. Nor, he\nreflected, was he addressing this brute only, but a huge posthumous\naudience. These hexameters would be sure to appear in the \"authorised\"\nbiography. \"A melancholy interest attaches to the following lines,\nwritten, it would seem, on the very eve of\"... He winced. Was it really\npossible, and no dream, that he was to die to-morrow--to-day?\n\nEven you, unassuming reader, go about with a vague notion that in your\ncase, somehow, the ultimate demand of nature will be waived. The\nDuke, until he conceived his sudden desire to die, had deemed himself\ncertainly exempt. And now, as he sat staring at his window, he saw in\nthe paling of the night the presage of the dawn of his own last day.\nSometimes (orphaned though he was in early childhood) he had even found\nit hard to believe there was no exemption for those to whom he stood in\nany personal relation. He remembered how, soon after he went to Eton,\nhe had received almost with incredulity the news of the death of his\ngod-father, Lord Stackley, an octogenarian.... He took from the table\nhis album, knowing that on one of the earliest pages was inscribed his\nboyish sense of that bereavement. Yes, here the passage was, written in\na large round hand:\n\n\"Death knocks, as we know, at the door of the cottage and of the castle.\nHe stalks up the front-garden and the steep steps of the semi-detached\nvilla, and plies the ornamental knocker so imperiously that the panels\nof imitation stained glass quiver in the thin front-door. Even the\nfamily that occupies the topmost story of a building without a lift is\non his ghastly visiting-list. He rattles his fleshless knuckles against\nthe door of the gypsy's caravan. Into the savage's tent, wigwam, or\nwattled hut, he darts unbidden. Even on the hermit in the cave he forces\nhis obnoxious presence. His is an universal beat, and he walks it with\na grin. But be sure it is at the sombre portal of the nobleman that he\nknocks with the greatest gusto. It is there, where haply his visit will\nbe commemorated with a hatchment; it is then, when the muffled thunder\nof the Dead March in 'Saul' will soon be rolling in cathedrals; it\nis then, it is there, that the pride of his unquestioned power comes\ngrimliest home to him. Is there no withstanding him? Why should he be\nadmitted always with awe, a cravenly-honoured guest? When next he calls,\nlet the butler send him about his business, or tell him to step round to\nthe servants' entrance. If it be made plain to him that his visits are\nan impertinence, he will soon be disemboldened. Once the aristocracy\nmake a stand against him, there need be no more trouble about the\nexorbitant Duties named after him. And for the hereditary system--that\nsystem which both offends the common sense of the Radical, and wounds\nthe Tory by its implied admission that noblemen are mortal--a seemly\nsubstitute will have been found.\"\n\nArtless and crude in expression, very boyish, it seemed now to its\nauthor. Yet, in its simple wistfulness, it had quality: it rang true.\nThe Duke wondered whether, with all that he had since mastered in the\ngreat art of English prose, he had not lost something, too.\n\n\"Is there no withstanding him?\" To think that the boy who uttered that\ncry, and gave back so brave an answer, was within nine years to go\nseek death of his own accord! How the gods must be laughing! Yes,\nthe exquisite point of the joke, for them, was that he CHOSE to die.\nBut--and, as the thought flashed through him, he started like a man\nshot--what if he chose not to? Stay, surely there was some reason why\nhe MUST die. Else, why throughout the night had he taken his doom for\ngranted?... Honour: yes, he had pledged himself. Better death than\ndishonour. Was it, though? was it? Ah, he, who had come so near to\ndeath, saw dishonour as a tiny trifle. Where was the sting of it? Not\nhe would be ridiculous to-morrow--to-day. Every one would acclaim his\nsplendid act of moral courage. She, she, the hyena woman, would be the\nfool. No one would have thought of dying for her, had he not set the\nexample. Every one would follow his new example. Yes, he would\nsave Oxford yet. That was his duty. Duty and darling vengeance! And\nlife--life!\n\nIt was full dawn now. Gone was that faint, monotonous sound which had\npunctuated in his soul the horrors of his vigil. But, in reminder of\nthose hours, his lamp was still burning. He extinguished it; and the\ngoing-out of that tarnished light made perfect his sense of release.\n\nHe threw wide his arms in welcome of the great adorable day, and of all\nthe great adorable days that were to be his.\n\nHe leaned out from his window, drinking the dawn in. The gods had\nmade merry over him, had they? And the cry of the hyena had made night\nhideous. Well, it was his turn now. He would laugh last and loudest.\n\nAnd already, for what was to be, he laughed outright into the morning;\ninsomuch that the birds in the trees of Trinity, and still more the\nEmperors over the way, marvelled greatly.\n\n\n\n\nXIV\n\nThey had awaited thousands and innumerable thousands of daybreaks in the\nBroad, these Emperors, counting the long slow hours till the night were\nover. It is in the night especially that their fallen greatness haunts\nthem. Day brings some distraction. They are not incurious of the lives\naround them--these little lives that succeed one another so quickly. To\nthem, in their immemorial old age, youth is a constant wonder. And so\nis death, which to them comes not. Youth or death--which, they had often\nasked themselves, was the goodlier? But it was ill that these two things\nshould be mated. It was ill-come, this day of days.\n\nLong after the Duke was in bed and asleep, his peal of laughter echoed\nin the ears of the Emperors. Why had he laughed?\n\nAnd they said to themselves \"We are very old men, and broken, and in a\nland not our own. There are things that we do not understand.\"\n\nBrief was the freshness of the dawn. From all points of the compass,\ndark grey clouds mounted into the sky. There, taking their places\nas though in accordance to a strategic plan laid down for them, they\nponderously massed themselves, and presently, as at a given signal,\ndrew nearer to earth, and halted, an irresistible great army, awaiting\norders.\n\nSomewhere under cover of them the sun went his way, transmitting a\nsulphurous heat. The very birds in the trees of Trinity were oppressed\nand did not twitter. The very leaves did not whisper.\n\nOut through the railings, and across the road, prowled a skimpy and\ndingy cat, trying to look like a tiger.\n\nIt was all very sinister and dismal.\n\nThe hours passed. The Broad put forth, one by one, its signs of waking.\n\nSoon after eight o'clock, as usual, the front-door of the Duke's\nlodgings was opened from within. The Emperors watched for the faint\ncloud of dust that presently emerged, and for her whom it preceded. To\nthem, this first outcoming of the landlady's daughter was a moment of\ndaily interest. Katie!--they had known her as a toddling child; and\nlater as a little girl scampering off to school, all legs and pinafore\nand streaming golden hair. And now she was sixteen years old. Her hair,\ntied back at the nape of her neck, would very soon be \"up.\" Her big\nblue eyes were as they had always been; but she had long passed out of\npinafores into aprons, had taken on a sedateness befitting her years and\nher duties, and was anxious to be regarded rather as an aunt than as\na sister by her brother Clarence, aged twelve. The Emperors had always\npredicted that she would be pretty. And very pretty she was.\n\nAs she came slowly out, with eyes downcast to her broom, sweeping the\ndust so seriously over the doorstep and then across the pavement, and\nanon when she reappeared with pail and scrubbing-brush, and abased\nherself before the doorstep, and wrought so vehemently there, what\nfilled her little soul was not the dignity of manual labour. The duties\nthat Zuleika had envied her were dear to her exactly as they would have\nbeen, yesterday morning, to Zuleika. The Emperors had often noticed that\nduring vacations their little favourite's treatment of the doorstep was\nlanguid and perfunctory. They knew well her secret, and always (for who\ncan be long in England without becoming sentimental?) they cherished the\nhope of a romantic union between her and \"a certain young gentleman,\" as\nthey archly called the Duke. His continued indifference to her they took\nalmost as an affront to themselves. Where in all England was a prettier,\nsweeter girl than their Katie? The sudden irruption of Zuleika into\nOxford was especially grievous to them because they could no longer\nhope against hope that Katie would be led by the Duke to the altar, and\nthence into the highest social circles, and live happily ever after.\nLuckily it was for Katie, however, that they had no power to fill her\nhead with their foolish notions. It was well for her to have never\ndoubted she loved in vain. She had soon grown used to her lot. Not until\nyesterday had there been any bitterness. Jealousy surged in Katie at the\nvery moment when she beheld Zuleika on the threshold. A glance at the\nDuke's face when she showed the visitor up was enough to acquaint\nher with the state of his heart. And she did not, for confirming her\nintuition, need the two or three opportunities she took of listening at\nthe keyhole. What in the course of those informal audiences did surprise\nher--so much indeed that she could hardly believe her ear--was that it\nwas possible for a woman not to love the Duke. Her jealousy of \"that\nMiss Dobson\" was for a while swallowed up in her pity for him. What she\nhad borne so cheerfully for herself she could not bear for her hero. She\nwished she had not happened to listen.\n\nAnd this morning, while she knelt swaying and spreading over \"his\"\ndoorstep, her blue eyes added certain tears to be scrubbed away in the\ngeneral moisture of the stone. Rising, she dried her hands in her apron,\nand dried her eyes with her hands. Lest her mother should see that she\nhad been crying, she loitered outside the door. Suddenly, her roving\nglance changed to a stare of acute hostility. She knew well that the\nperson wandering towards her was--no, not \"that Miss Dobson,\" as she had\nfor the fraction of an instant supposed, but the next worst thing.\n\nIt has been said that Melisande indoors was an evidently French maid.\nOut of doors she was not less evidently Zuleika's. Not that she aped her\nmistress. The resemblance had come by force of propinquity and devotion.\nNature had laid no basis for it. Not one point of form or colour had\nthe two women in common. It has been said that Zuleika was not strictly\nbeautiful. Melisande, like most Frenchwomen, was strictly plain. But\nin expression and port, in her whole tournure, she had become, as\nevery good maid does, her mistress' replica. The poise of her head, the\nboldness of her regard and brilliance of her smile, the leisurely and\nswinging way in which she walked, with a hand on the hip--all these\nthings of hers were Zuleika's too. She was no conqueror. None but the\nman to whom she was betrothed--a waiter at the Cafe Tourtel, named\nPelleas--had ever paid court to her; nor was she covetous of other\nhearts. Yet she looked victorious, and insatiable of victories, and\n\"terrible as an army with banners.\"\n\nIn the hand that was not on her hip she carried a letter. And on her\nshoulders she had to bear the full burden of the hatred that Zuleika had\ninspired in Katie. But this she did not know. She came glancing boldly,\nleisurely, at the numbers on the front-doors.\n\nKatie stepped back on to the doorstep, lest the inferiority of her\nstature should mar the effect of her disdain.\n\n\"Good-day. Is it here that Duke D'Orsay lives?\" asked Melisande, as\nnearly accurate as a Gaul may be in such matters.\n\n\"The Duke of Dorset,\" said Katie with a cold and insular emphasis,\n\"lives here.\" And \"You,\" she tried to convey with her eyes, \"you, for\nall your smart black silk, are a hireling. I am Miss Batch. I happen to\nhave a hobby for housework. I have not been crying.\"\n\n\"Then please mount this to him at once,\" said Melisande, holding out the\nletter. \"It is from Miss Dobson's part. Very express. I wait response.\"\n\n\"You are very ugly,\" Katie signalled with her eyes. \"I am very pretty.\nI have the Oxfordshire complexion. And I play the piano.\" With her lips\nshe said merely, \"His Grace is not called before nine o'clock.\"\n\n\"But to-day you go wake him now--quick--is it not?\"\n\n\"Quite out of the question,\" said Katie. \"If you care to leave\nthat letter here, I will see that it is placed on his Grace's\nbreakfast-table, with the morning's post.\" \"For the rest,\" added her\neyes, \"Down with France!\"\n\n\"I find you droll, but droll, my little one!\" cried Melisande.\n\nKatie stepped back and shut the door in her face. \"Like a little\nEmpress,\" the Emperors commented.\n\nThe Frenchwoman threw up her hands and apostrophised heaven. To this day\nshe believes that all the bonnes of Oxford are mad, but mad, and of a\nmadness.\n\nShe stared at the door, at the pail and scrubbing-brush that had been\nshut out with her, at the letter in her hand. She decided that she had\nbetter drop the letter into the slit in the door and make report to Miss\nDobson.\n\nAs the envelope fell through the slit to the door-mat, Katie made at\nMelisande a grimace which, had not the panels been opaque, would have\nastonished the Emperors. Resuming her dignity, she picked the thing up,\nand, at arm's length, examined it. It was inscribed in pencil. Katie's\nlips curled at sight of the large, audacious handwriting. But it is\nprobable that whatever kind of handwriting Zuleika might have had would\nhave been just the kind that Katie would have expected.\n\nFingering the envelope, she wondered what the wretched woman had to\nsay. It occurred to her that the kettle was simmering on the hob in the\nkitchen, and that she might easily steam open the envelope and master\nits contents. However, her doing this would have in no way affected\nthe course of the tragedy. And so the gods (being to-day in a strictly\nartistic mood) prompted her to mind her own business.\n\nLaying the Duke's table for breakfast, she made as usual a neat\nrectangular pile of the letters that had come for him by post. Zuleika's\nletter she threw down askew. That luxury she allowed herself.\n\nAnd he, when he saw the letter, allowed himself the luxury of leaving it\nunopened awhile. Whatever its purport, he knew it could but minister to\nhis happy malice. A few hours ago, with what shame and dread it would\nhave stricken him! Now it was a dainty to be dallied with.\n\nHis eyes rested on the black tin boxes that contained his robes of the\nGarter. Hateful had been the sight of them in the watches of the night,\nwhen he thought he had worn those robes for the last time. But now--!\n\nHe opened Zuleika's letter. It did not disappoint him.\n\n\n\"DEAR DUKE,--DO, DO forgive me. I am beyond words ashamed of the silly\ntomboyish thing I did last night. Of course it was no worse than that,\nbut an awful fear haunts me that you MAY have thought I acted in anger\nat the idea of your breaking your promise to me. Well, it is quite true\nI had been hurt and angry when you hinted at doing that, but the moment\nI left you I saw that you had been only in fun, and I enjoyed the joke\nagainst myself, though I thought it was rather too bad of you. And\nthen, as a sort of revenge, but almost before I knew what I was doing,\nI played that IDIOTIC practical joke on you. I have been MISERABLE ever\nsince. DO come round as early as possible and tell me I am forgiven. But\nbefore you tell me that, please lecture me till I cry--though indeed I\nhave been crying half through the night. And then if you want to be VERY\nhorrid you may tease me for being so slow to see a joke. And then you\nmight take me to see some of the Colleges and things before we go on to\nlunch at The MacQuern's? Forgive pencil and scrawl. Am sitting up in bed\nto write.--Your sincere friend,\n\n\"Z. D.\n\n\"P.S.--Please burn this.\"\n\n\nAt that final injunction, the Duke abandoned himself to his mirth.\n\"Please burn this.\" Poor dear young woman, how modest she was in the\nglare of her diplomacy! Why there was nothing, not one phrase, to\ncompromise her in the eyes of a coroner's jury!... Seriously, she\nhad good reason to be proud of her letter. For the purpose in view it\ncouldn't have been better done. That was what made it so touchingly\nabsurd. He put himself in her position. He pictured himself as her,\n\"sitting up in bed,\" pencil in hand, to explain away, to soothe, to\nclinch and bind... Yes, if he had happened to be some other man--one\nwhom her insult might have angered without giving love its death-blow,\nand one who could be frightened out of not keeping his word--this letter\nwould have been capital.\n\nHe helped himself to some more marmalade, and poured out another cup of\ncoffee. Nothing is more thrilling, thought he, than to be treated as a\ncully by the person you hold in the hollow of your hand.\n\nBut within this great irony lay (to be glided over) another irony. He\nknew well in what mood Zuleika had done what she had done to him last\nnight; yet he preferred to accept her explanation of it.\n\nOfficially, then, he acquitted her of anything worse than tomboyishness.\nBut this verdict for his own convenience implied no mercy to the\nculprit. The sole point for him was how to administer her punishment the\nmost poignantly. Just how should he word his letter?\n\nHe rose from his chair, and \"Dear Miss Dobson--no, MY dear Miss Dobson,\"\nhe murmured, pacing the room, \"I am so very sorry I cannot come to see\nyou: I have to attend two lectures this morning. By contrast with this\nweariness, it will be the more delightful to meet you at The MacQuern's.\nI want to see as much as I can of you to-day, because to-night there is\nthe Bump Supper, and to-morrow morning, alas! I must motor to Windsor\nfor this wretched Investiture. Meanwhile, how can you ask to be forgiven\nwhen there is nothing whatever to forgive? It seems to me that mine, not\nyours, is the form of humour that needs explanation. My proposal to die\nfor you was made in as playful a spirit as my proposal to marry you. And\nit is really for me to ask forgiveness of you. One thing especially,\" he\nmurmured, fingering in his waistcoat-pocket the ear-rings she had given\nhim, \"pricks my conscience. I do feel that I ought not to have let\nyou give me these two pearls--at any rate, not the one which went into\npremature mourning for me. As I have no means of deciding which of the\ntwo this one is, I enclose them both, with the hope that the pretty\ndifference between them will in time reappear\"... Or words to that\neffect... Stay! why not add to the joy of contriving that effect the\ngreater joy of watching it? Why send Zuleika a letter? He would obey her\nsummons. He would speed to her side. He snatched up a hat.\n\nIn this haste, however, he detected a certain lack of dignity. He\nsteadied himself, and went slowly to the mirror. There he adjusted his\nhat with care, and regarded himself very seriously, very sternly, from\nvarious angles, like a man invited to paint his own portrait for the\nUffizi. He must be worthy of himself. It was well that Zuleika should\nbe chastened. Great was her sin. Out of life and death she had fashioned\ntoys for her vanity. But his joy must be in vindication of what was\nnoble, not in making suffer what was vile. Yesterday he had been her\npuppet, her Jumping-Jack; to-day it was as avenging angel that he would\nappear before her. The gods had mocked him who was now their minister.\nTheir minister? Their master, as being once more master of himself. It\nwas they who had plotted his undoing. Because they loved him they were\nfain that he should die young. The Dobson woman was but their agent,\ntheir cat's-paw. By her they had all but got him. Not quite! And now, to\nteach them, through her, a lesson they would not soon forget, he would\ngo forth.\n\nShaking with laughter, the gods leaned over the thunder-clouds to watch\nhim.\n\nHe went forth.\n\nOn the well-whitened doorstep he was confronted by a small boy in\nuniform bearing a telegram.\n\n\"Duke of Dorset?\" asked the small boy.\n\nOpening the envelope, the Duke saw that the message, with which was a\nprepaid form for reply, had been handed in at the Tankerton post-office.\nIt ran thus:\n\n\n     Deeply regret inform your grace last night\n     two black owls came and perched on battlements\n     remained there through night hooting\n     at dawn flew away none knows whither\n     awaiting instructions            Jellings\n\n\nThe Duke's face, though it grew white, moved not one muscle.\n\nSomewhat shamed now, the gods ceased from laughing.\n\nThe Duke looked from the telegram to the boy. \"Have you a pencil?\" he\nasked.\n\n\"Yes, my Lord,\" said the boy, producing a stump of pencil.\n\nHolding the prepaid form against the door, the Duke wrote:\n\n\n     Jellings Tankerton Hall\n     Prepare vault for funeral Monday\n\n                              Dorset\n\n\nHis handwriting was as firmly and minutely beautiful as ever. Only in\nthat he forgot there was nothing to pay did he belie his calm. \"Here,\"\nhe said to the boy, \"is a shilling; and you may keep the change.\"\n\n\"Thank you, my Lord,\" said the boy, and went his way, as happy as a\npostman.\n\n\n\n\nXV\n\nHumphrey Greddon, in the Duke's place, would have taken a pinch of\nsnuff. But he could not have made that gesture with a finer air than the\nDuke gave to its modern equivalent. In the art of taking and lighting\na cigarette, there was one man who had no rival in Europe. This time he\noutdid even himself.\n\n\"Ah,\" you say, \"but 'pluck' is one thing, endurance another. A man who\ndoesn't reel on receipt of his death-warrant may yet break down when he\nhas had time to think it over. How did the Duke acquit himself when he\ncame to the end of his cigarette? And by the way, how was it that after\nhe had read the telegram you didn't give him again an hour's grace?\"\n\nIn a way, you have a perfect right to ask both those questions. But\ntheir very pertinence shows that you think I might omit things that\nmatter. Please don't interrupt me again. Am _I_ writing this history, or\nare you?\n\nThough the news that he must die was a yet sharper douche, as you have\nsuggested, than the douche inflicted by Zuleika, it did at least leave\nunscathed the Duke's pride. The gods can make a man ridiculous through\na woman, but they cannot make him ridiculous when they deal him a blow\ndirect. The very greatness of their power makes them, in that respect,\nimpotent. They had decreed that the Duke should die, and they had told\nhim so. There was nothing to demean him in that. True, he had just\nmeasured himself against them. But there was no shame in being\ngravelled. The peripety was according to the best rules of tragic art.\nThe whole thing was in the grand manner.\n\nThus I felt that there were no indelicacy, this time, in watching\nhim. Just as \"pluck\" comes of breeding, so is endurance especially an\nattribute of the artist. Because he can stand outside himself, and (if\nthere be nothing ignoble in them) take a pleasure in his own sufferings,\nthe artist has a huge advantage over you and me. The Duke, so soon\nas Zuleika's spell was broken, had become himself again--a highly\nself-conscious artist in life. And now, standing pensive on the\ndoorstep, he was almost enviable in his great affliction.\n\nThrough the wreaths of smoke which, as they came from his lips, hung in\nthe sultry air as they would have hung in a closed room, he gazed up at\nthe steadfast thunder-clouds. How nobly they had been massed for him!\nOne of them, a particularly large and dark one, might with advantage,\nhe thought, have been placed a little further to the left. He made a\ngesture to that effect. Instantly the cloud rolled into position.\nThe gods were painfully anxious, now, to humour him in trifles. His\nbehaviour in the great emergency had so impressed them at a distance\nthat they rather dreaded meeting him anon at close quarters. They rather\nwished they had not uncaged, last night, the two black owls. Too late.\nWhat they had done they had done.\n\nThat faint monotonous sound in the stillness of the night--the Duke\nremembered it now. What he had thought to be only his fancy had been\nhis death-knell, wafted to him along uncharted waves of ether, from the\nbattlements of Tankerton. It had ceased at daybreak. He wondered now\nthat he had not guessed its meaning. And he was glad that he had not.\nHe was thankful for the peace that had been granted to him, the joyous\narrogance in which he had gone to bed and got up for breakfast. He\nvalued these mercies the more for the great tragic irony that came of\nthem. Aye, and he was inclined to blame the gods for not having kept him\nstill longer in the dark and so made the irony still more awful. Why had\nthey not caused the telegram to be delayed in transmission? They\nought to have let him go and riddle Zuleika with his scorn and his\nindifference. They ought to have let him hurl through her his defiance\nof them. Art aside, they need not have grudged him that excursion.\n\nHe could not, he told himself, face Zuleika now. As artist, he saw that\nthere was irony enough left over to make the meeting a fine one. As\ntheologian, he did not hold her responsible for his destiny. But as a\nman, after what she had done to him last night, and before what he had\nto do for her to-day, he would not go out of his way to meet her. Of\ncourse, he would not actually avoid her. To seem to run away from her\nwere beneath his dignity. But, if he did meet her, what in heaven's\nname should he say to her? He remembered his promise to lunch with The\nMacQuern, and shuddered. She would be there. Death, as he had said,\ncancelled all engagements. A very simple way out of the difficulty would\nbe to go straight to the river. No, that would be like running away. It\ncouldn't be done.\n\nHardly had he rejected the notion when he had a glimpse of a female\nfigure coming quickly round the corner--a glimpse that sent him walking\nquickly away, across the road, towards Turl Street, blushing violently.\nHad she seen him? he asked himself. And had she seen that he saw her?\nHe heard her running after him. He did not look round, he quickened his\npace. She was gaining on him. Involuntarily, he ran--ran like a hare,\nand, at the corner of Turl Street, rose like a trout, saw the pavement\nrise at him, and fell, with a bang, prone.\n\nLet it be said at once that in this matter the gods were absolutely\nblameless. It is true they had decreed that a piece of orange-peel\nshould be thrown down this morning at the corner of Turl Street. But\nthe Master of Balliol, not the Duke, was the person they had destined\nto slip on it. You must not imagine that they think out and appoint\neverything that is to befall us, down to the smallest detail. Generally,\nthey just draw a sort of broad outline, and leave us to fill it in\naccording to our taste. Thus, in the matters of which this book is\nrecord, it was they who made the Warden invite his grand-daughter to\nOxford, and invite the Duke to meet her on the evening of her arrival.\nAnd it was they who prompted the Duke to die for her on the following\n(Tuesday) afternoon. They had intended that he should execute his\nresolve after, or before, the boat-race of that evening. But an\noversight upset this plan. They had forgotten on Monday night to uncage\nthe two black owls; and so it was necessary that the Duke's death should\nbe postponed. They accordingly prompted Zuleika to save him. For the\nrest, they let the tragedy run its own course--merely putting in a\nfelicitous touch here and there, or vetoing a superfluity, such as that\nKatie should open Zuleika's letter. It was no part of their scheme that\nthe Duke should mistake Melisande for her mistress, or that he should\nrun away from her, and they were genuinely sorry when he, instead of the\nMaster of Balliol, came to grief over the orange-peel.\n\nThem, however, the Duke cursed as he fell; them again as he raised\nhimself on one elbow, giddy and sore; and when he found that the woman\nbending over him was not she whom he dreaded, but her innocent maid, it\nwas against them that he almost foamed at the mouth.\n\n\"Monsieur le Duc has done himself harm--no?\" panted Melisande. \"Here is\na letter from Miss Dobson's part. She say to me 'Give it him with your\nown hand.'\"\n\nThe Duke received the letter and, sitting upright, tore it to shreds,\nthus confirming a suspicion which Melisande had conceived at the moment\nwhen he took to his heels, that all English noblemen are mad, but mad,\nand of a madness.\n\n\"Nom de Dieu,\" she cried, wringing her hands, \"what shall I tell to\nMademoiselle?\"\n\n\"Tell her--\" the Duke choked back a phrase of which the memory would\nhave shamed his last hours. \"Tell her,\" he substituted, \"that you have\nseen Marius sitting among the ruins of Carthage,\" and limped quickly\naway down the Turl.\n\nBoth his hands had been abraded by the fall. He tended them angrily\nwith his handkerchief. Mr. Druce, the chemist, had anon the privilege of\nbathing and plastering them, also of balming and binding the right knee\nand the left shin. \"Might have been a very nasty accident, your Grace,\"\nhe said. \"It was,\" said the Duke. Mr. Druce concurred.\n\nNevertheless, Mr. Druce's remark sank deep. The Duke thought it quite\nlikely that the gods had intended the accident to be fatal, and that\nonly by his own skill and lightness in falling had he escaped the\nignominy of dying in full flight from a lady's-maid. He had not, you\nsee, lost all sense of free-will. While Mr. Druce put the finishing\ntouches to his shin, \"I am utterly purposed,\" he said to himself, \"that\nfor this death of mine I will choose my own manner and my own--well, not\n'time' exactly, but whatever moment within my brief span of life shall\nseem aptest to me. Unberufen,\" he added, lightly tapping Mr. Druce's\ncounter.\n\nThe sight of some bottles of Cold Mixture on that hospitable board\nreminded him of a painful fact. In the clash of the morning's\nexcitements, he had hardly felt the gross ailment that was on him.\nHe became fully conscious of it now, and there leapt in him a hideous\ndoubt: had he escaped a violent death only to succumb to \"natural\ncauses\"? He had never hitherto had anything the matter with him, and\nthus he belonged to the worst, the most apprehensive, class of patients.\nHe knew that a cold, were it neglected, might turn malignant; and he\nhad a vision of himself gripped suddenly in the street by internal\nagonies--a sympathetic crowd, an ambulance, his darkened bedroom; local\ndoctor making hopelessly wrong diagnosis; eminent specialists served up\nhot by special train, commending local doctor's treatment, but shaking\ntheir heads and refusing to say more than \"He has youth on his side\"; a\nslight rally at sunset; the end. All this flashed through his mind. He\nquailed. There was not a moment to lose. He frankly confessed to Mr.\nDruce that he had a cold.\n\nMr. Druce, trying to insinuate by his manner that this fact had not been\nobvious, suggested the Mixture--a teaspoonful every two hours. \"Give me\nsome now, please, at once,\" said the Duke.\n\nHe felt magically better for the draught. He handled the little glass\nlovingly, and eyed the bottle. \"Why not two teaspoonfuls every hour?\"\nhe suggested, with an eagerness almost dipsomaniacal. But Mr. Druce was\nrespectfully firm against that. The Duke yielded. He fancied, indeed,\nthat the gods had meant him to die of an overdose.\n\nStill, he had a craving for more. Few though his hours were, he hoped\nthe next two would pass quickly. And, though he knew Mr. Druce could be\ntrusted to send the bottle round to his rooms immediately, he preferred\nto carry it away with him. He slipped it into the breast-pocket of his\ncoat, almost heedless of the slight extrusion it made there.\n\nJust as he was about to cross the High again, on his way home, a\nbutcher's cart dashed down the slope, recklessly driven. He stepped well\nback on the pavement, and smiled a sardonic smile. He looked to right\nand to left, carefully gauging the traffic. Some time elapsed before he\ndeemed the road clear enough for transit.\n\nSafely across, he encountered a figure that seemed to loom up out of the\ndim past. Oover! Was it but yesternight that Oover dined with him? With\nthe sensation of a man groping among archives, he began to apologise to\nthe Rhodes Scholar for having left him so abruptly at the Junta. Then,\npresto!--as though those musty archives were changed to a crisp morning\npaper agog with terrific head-lines--he remembered the awful resolve of\nOover, and of all young Oxford.\n\n\"Of course,\" he asked, with a lightness that hardly hid his dread of the\nanswer, \"you have dismissed the notion you were toying with when I left\nyou?\"\n\nOover's face, like his nature, was as sensitive as it was massive,\nand it instantly expressed his pain at the doubt cast on his high\nseriousness. \"Duke,\" he asked, \"d'you take me for a skunk?\"\n\n\"Without pretending to be quite sure what a skunk is,\" said the Duke,\n\"I take you to be all that it isn't. And the high esteem in which I\nhold you is the measure for me of the loss that your death would be to\nAmerica and to Oxford.\"\n\nOover blushed. \"Duke\" he said \"that's a bully testimonial. But don't\nworry. America can turn out millions just like me, and Oxford can have\nas many of them as she can hold. On the other hand, how many of YOU\ncan be turned out, as per sample, in England? Yet you choose to destroy\nyourself. You avail yourself of the Unwritten Law. And you're right,\nSir. Love transcends all.\"\n\n\"But does it? What if I told you I had changed my mind?\"\n\n\"Then, Duke,\" said Oover, slowly, \"I should believe that all those yarns\nI used to hear about the British aristocracy were true, after all. I\nshould aver that you were not a white man. Leading us on like that, and\nthen--Say, Duke! Are you going to die to-day, or not?\"\n\n\"As a matter of fact, I am, but--\"\n\n\"Shake!\"\n\n\"But--\"\n\nOover wrung the Duke's hand, and was passing on. \"Stay!\" he was adjured.\n\n\"Sorry, unable. It's just turning eleven o'clock, and I've a lecture.\nWhile life lasts, I'm bound to respect Rhodes' intentions.\" The\nconscientious Scholar hurried away.\n\nThe Duke wandered down the High, taking counsel with himself. He was\nashamed of having so utterly forgotten the mischief he had wrought at\nlarge. At dawn he had vowed to undo it. Undo it he must. But the task\nwas not a simple one now. If he could say \"Behold, I take back my word.\nI spurn Miss Dobson, and embrace life,\" it was possible that his example\nwould suffice. But now that he could only say \"Behold, I spurn Miss\nDobson, and will not die for her, but I am going to commit suicide, all\nthe same,\" it was clear that his words would carry very little force.\nAlso, he saw with pain that they placed him in a somewhat ludicrous\nposition. His end, as designed yesterday, had a large and simple\ngrandeur. So had his recantation of it. But this new compromise between\nthe two things had a fumbled, a feeble, an ignoble look. It seemed to\ncombine all the disadvantages of both courses. It stained his honour\nwithout prolonging his life. Surely, this was a high price to pay for\nsnubbing Zuleika... Yes, he must revert without more ado to his first\nscheme. He must die in the manner that he had blazoned forth. And he\nmust do it with a good grace, none knowing he was not glad; else the\naction lost all dignity. True, this was no way to be a saviour. But only\nby not dying at all could he have set a really potent example.... He\nremembered the look that had come into Oover's eyes just now at the\nnotion of his unfaith. Perhaps he would have been the mock, not the\nsaviour, of Oxford. Better dishonour than death, maybe. But, since\ndie he must, he must die not belittling or tarnishing the name of\nTanville-Tankerton.\n\nWithin these bounds, however, he must put forth his full might to avert\nthe general catastrophe--and to punish Zuleika nearly well enough, after\nall, by intercepting that vast nosegay from her outstretched hands\nand her distended nostrils. There was no time to be lost, then. But he\nwondered, as he paced the grand curve between St. Mary's and Magdalen\nBridge, just how was he to begin?\n\nDown the flight of steps from Queen's came lounging an average\nundergraduate.\n\n\"Mr. Smith,\" said the Duke, \"a word with you.\"\n\n\"But my name is not Smith,\" said the young man.\n\n\"Generically it is,\" replied the Duke. \"You are Smith to all intents\nand purposes. That, indeed, is why I address you. In making your\nacquaintance, I make a thousand acquaintances. You are a short cut to\nknowledge. Tell me, do you seriously think of drowning yourself this\nafternoon?\"\n\n\"Rather,\" said the undergraduate.\n\n\"A meiosis in common use, equivalent to 'Yes, assuredly,'\" murmured the\nDuke. \"And why,\" he then asked, \"do you mean to do this?\"\n\n\"Why? How can you ask? Why are YOU going to do it?\"\n\n\"The Socratic manner is not a game at which two can play. Please answer\nmy question, to the best of your ability.\"\n\n\"Well, because I can't live without her. Because I want to prove my love\nfor her. Because--\"\n\n\"One reason at a time please,\" said the Duke, holding up his hand. \"You\ncan't live without her? Then I am to assume that you look forward to\ndying?\"\n\n\"Rather.\"\n\n\"You are truly happy in that prospect?\"\n\n\"Yes. Rather.\"\n\n\"Now, suppose I showed you two pieces of equally fine amber--a big one\nand a little one. Which of these would you rather possess?\"\n\n\"The big one, I suppose.\"\n\n\"And this because it is better to have more than to have less of a good\nthing?\"\n\n\"Just so.\"\n\n\"Do you consider happiness a good thing or a bad one?\"\n\n\"A good one.\"\n\n\"So that a man would rather have more than less of happiness?\"\n\n\"Undoubtedly.\"\n\n\"Then does it not seem to you that you would do well to postpone your\nsuicide indefinitely?\"\n\n\"But I have just said I can't live without her.\"\n\n\"You have still more recently declared yourself truly happy.\"\n\n\"Yes, but--\"\n\n\"Now, be careful, Mr. Smith. Remember, this is a matter of life and\ndeath. Try to do yourself justice. I have asked you--\"\n\nBut the undergraduate was walking away, not without a certain dignity.\n\nThe Duke felt that he had not handled his man skilfully. He remembered\nthat even Socrates, for all the popular charm of his mock-modesty and\nhis true geniality, had ceased after a while to be tolerable. Without\nsuch a manner to grace his method, Socrates would have had a very brief\ntime indeed. The Duke recoiled from what he took to be another pitfall.\nHe almost smelt hemlock.\n\nA party of four undergraduates abreast was approaching. How should he\naddress them? His choice wavered between the evangelic wistfulness of\n\"Are you saved?\" and the breeziness of the recruiting sergeant's \"Come,\nyou're fine upstanding young fellows. Isn't it a pity,\" etc. Meanwhile,\nthe quartet had passed by.\n\nTwo other undergraduates approached. The Duke asked them simply as a\npersonal favour to himself not to throw away their lives. They said\nthey were very sorry, but in this particular matter they must please\nthemselves. In vain he pled. They admitted that but for his example they\nwould never have thought of dying. They wished they could show him their\ngratitude in any way but the one which would rob them of it.\n\nThe Duke drifted further down the High, bespeaking every undergraduate\nhe met, leaving untried no argument, no inducement. For one man, whose\nname he happened to know, he invented an urgent personal message from\nMiss Dobson imploring him not to die on her account. On another man he\noffered to settle by hasty codicil a sum of money sufficient to yield\nan annual income of two thousand pounds--three thousand--any sum within\nreason. With another he offered to walk, arm in arm, to Carfax and back\nagain. All to no avail.\n\nHe found himself in the precincts of Magdalen, preaching from the little\nopen-air pulpit there an impassioned sermon on the sacredness of human\nlife, and referring to Zuleika in terms which John Knox would have\nhesitated to utter. As he piled up the invective, he noticed an ominous\nrestiveness in the congregation--murmurs, clenching of hands, dark\nlooks. He saw the pulpit as yet another trap laid for him by the gods.\nHe had walked straight into it: another moment, and he might be dragged\ndown, overwhelmed by numbers, torn limb from limb. All that was in\nhim of quelling power he put hastily into his eyes, and manoeuvred his\ntongue to gentler discourse, deprecating his right to judge \"this lady,\"\nand merely pointing the marvel, the awful though noble folly, of his\nresolve. He ended on a note of quiet pathos. \"To-night I shall be among\nthe shades. There be not you, my brothers.\"\n\nGood though the sermon was in style and sentiment, the flaw in its\nreasoning was too patent for any converts to be made. As he walked out\nof the quadrangle, the Duke felt the hopelessness of his cause. Still\nhe battled bravely for it up the High, waylaying, cajoling, commanding,\noffering vast bribes. He carried his crusade into the Loder, and\nthence into Vincent's, and out into the street again, eager, untiring,\nunavailing: everywhere he found his precept checkmated by his example.\n\nThe sight of The MacQuern coming out top-speed from the Market, with\na large but inexpensive bunch of flowers, reminded him of the luncheon\nthat was to be. Never to throw over an engagement was for him, as we\nhave seen, a point of honour. But this particular engagement--hateful,\nwhen he accepted it, by reason of his love--was now impossible for\nthe reason which had made him take so ignominiously to his heels this\nmorning. He curtly told the Scot not to expect him.\n\n\"Is SHE not coming?\" gasped the Scot, with quick suspicion.\n\n\"Oh,\" said the Duke, turning on his heel, \"she doesn't know that I\nshan't be there. You may count on her.\" This he took to be the very\ntruth, and he was glad to have made of it a thrust at the man who had\nso uncouthly asserted himself last night. He could not help smiling,\nthough, at this little resentment erect after the cataclysm that had\nswept away all else. Then he smiled to think how uneasy Zuleika would\nbe at his absence. What agonies of suspense she must have had all this\nmorning! He imagined her silent at the luncheon, with a vacant gaze at\nthe door, eating nothing at all. And he became aware that he was rather\nhungry. He had done all he could to save young Oxford. Now for some\nsandwiches! He went into the Junta.\n\nAs he rang the dining-room bell, his eyes rested on the miniature of\nNellie O'Mora. And the eyes of Nellie O'Mora seemed to meet his in\nreproach. Just as she may have gazed at Greddon when he cast her off,\nso now did she gaze at him who a few hours ago had refused to honour her\nmemory.\n\nYes, and many other eyes than hers rebuked him. It was around the walls\nof this room that hung those presentments of the Junta as focussed,\nyear after year, in a certain corner of Tom Quad, by Messrs. Hills and\nSaunders. All around, the members of the little hierarchy, a hierarchy\never changing in all but youth and a certain sternness of aspect that\ncomes at the moment of being immortalised, were gazing forth now with a\nsternness beyond their wont. Not one of them but had in his day handed\non loyally the praise of Nellie O'Mora, in the form their Founder had\nordained. And the Duke's revolt last night had so incensed them that\nthey would, if they could, have come down from their frames and walked\nstraight out of the club, in chronological order--first, the men of\nthe 'sixties, almost as near in time to Greddon as to the Duke, all\nso gloriously be-whiskered and cravated, but how faded now, alas, by\nexposure; and last of all in the procession and angrier perhaps than any\nof them, the Duke himself--the Duke of a year ago, President and sole\nMember.\n\nBut, as he gazed into the eyes of Nellie O'Mora now, Dorset needed not\nfor penitence the reproaches of his past self or of his forerunners.\n\"Sweet girl,\" he murmured, \"forgive me. I was mad. I was under the\nsway of a deplorable infatuation. It is past. See,\" he murmured with a\ndelicacy of feeling that justified the untruth, \"I am come here for the\nexpress purpose of undoing my impiety.\" And, turning to the club-waiter\nwho at this moment answered the bell, he said \"Bring me a glass of port,\nplease, Barrett.\" Of sandwiches he said nothing.\n\nAt the word \"See\" he had stretched one hand towards Nellie; the other\nhe had laid on his heart, where it seemed to encounter some sort of hard\nobstruction. This he vaguely fingered, wondering what it might be, while\nhe gave his order to Barrett. With a sudden cry he dipped his hand into\nhis breast-pocket and drew forth the bottle he had borne away from\nMr. Druce's. He snatched out his watch: one o'clock!--fifteen minutes\noverdue. Wildly he called the waiter back. \"A tea-spoon, quick! No\nport. A wine-glass and a tea-spoon. And--for I don't mind telling you,\nBarrett, that your mission is of an urgency beyond conjecture--take\nlightning for your model. Go!\"\n\nAgitation mastered him. He tried vainly to feel his pulse, well knowing\nthat if he found it he could deduce nothing from its action. He saw\nhimself haggard in the looking-glass. Would Barrett never come? \"Every\ntwo hours\"--the directions were explicit. Had he delivered himself into\nthe gods' hands? The eyes of Nellie O'Mora were on him compassionately;\nand all the eyes of his forerunners were on him in austere scorn: \"See,\"\nthey seemed to be saying, \"the chastisement of last night's blasphemy.\"\nViolently, insistently, he rang the bell.\n\nIn rushed Barrett at last. From the tea-spoon into the wine-glass the\nDuke poured the draught of salvation, and then, raising it aloft, he\nlooked around at his fore-runners and in a firm voice cried \"Gentlemen,\nI give you Nellie O'Mora, the fairest witch that ever was or will be.\"\nHe drained his glass, heaved the deep sigh of a double satisfaction,\ndismissed with a glance the wondering Barrett, and sat down.\n\nHe was glad to be able to face Nellie with a clear conscience. Her eyes\nwere not less sad now, but it seemed to him that their sadness came of a\nknowledge that she would never see him again. She seemed to be saying\nto him \"Had you lived in my day, it is you that I would have loved, not\nGreddon.\" And he made silent answer, \"Had you lived in my day, I should\nhave been Dobson-proof.\" He realised, however, that to Zuleika he owed\nthe tenderness he now felt for Miss O'Mora. It was Zuleika that had\ncured him of his aseity. She it was that had made his heart a warm and\nnegotiable thing. Yes, and that was the final cruelty. To love and be\nloved--this, he had come to know, was all that mattered. Yesterday, to\nlove and die had seemed felicity enough. Now he knew that the secret,\nthe open secret, of happiness was in mutual love--a state that needed\nnot the fillip of death. And he had to die without having ever lived.\nAdmiration, homage, fear, he had sown broadcast. The one woman who had\nloved him had turned to stone because he loved her. Death would lose\nmuch of its sting for him if there were somewhere in the world just one\nwoman, however lowly, whose heart would be broken by his dying. What a\npity Nellie O'Mora was not really extant!\n\nSuddenly he recalled certain words lightly spoken yesterday by Zuleika.\nShe had told him he was loved by the girl who waited on him--the\ndaughter of his landlady. Was this so? He had seen no sign of it, had\nreceived no token of it. But, after all, how should he have seen a sign\nof anything in one whom he had never consciously visualised? That she\nhad never thrust herself on his notice might mean merely that she had\nbeen well brought-up. What likelier than that the daughter of Mrs.\nBatch, that worthy soul, had been well brought up?\n\nHere, at any rate, was the chance of a new element in his life, or\nrather in his death. Here, possibly, was a maiden to mourn him. He would\nlunch in his rooms.\n\nWith a farewell look at Nellie's miniature, he took the medicine-bottle\nfrom the table, and went quickly out. The heavens had grown steadily\ndarker and darker, the air more sulphurous and baleful. And the High had\na strangely woebegone look, being all forsaken by youth, in this hour of\nluncheon. Even so would its look be all to-morrow, thought the Duke,\nand for many morrows. Well he had done what he could. He was free now to\nbrighten a little his own last hours. He hastened on, eager to see the\nlandlady's daughter. He wondered what she was like, and whether she\nreally loved him.\n\nAs he threw open the door of his sitting-room, he was aware of a rustle,\na rush, a cry. In another instant, he was aware of Zuleika Dobson at his\nfeet, at his knees, clasping him to her, sobbing, laughing, sobbing.\n\n\n\n\nXVI\n\nFor what happened a few moments later you must not blame him. Some\nmeasure of force was the only way out of an impossible situation. It was\nin vain that he commanded the young lady to let go: she did but cling\nthe closer. It was in vain that he tried to disentangle himself of her\nby standing first on one foot, then on the other, and veering sharply on\nhis heel: she did but sway as though hinged to him. He had no choice but\nto grasp her by the wrists, cast her aside, and step clear of her into\nthe room.\n\nHer hat, gauzily basking with a pair of long white gloves on one of his\narm-chairs, proclaimed that she had come to stay.\n\nNor did she rise. Propped on one elbow, with heaving bosom and parted\nlips, she seemed to be trying to realise what had been done to her.\nThrough her undried tears her eyes shone up to him.\n\nHe asked: \"To what am I indebted for this visit?\"\n\n\"Ah, say that again!\" she murmured. \"Your voice is music.\"\n\nHe repeated his question.\n\n\"Music!\" she said dreamily; and such is the force of habit that \"I\ndon't,\" she added, \"know anything about music, really. But I know what I\nlike.\"\n\n\"Had you not better get up from the floor?\" he said. \"The door is open,\nand any one who passed might see you.\"\n\nSoftly she stroked the carpet with the palms of her hands. \"Happy\ncarpet!\" she crooned. \"Aye, happy the very women that wove the threads\nthat are trod by the feet of my beloved master. But hark! he bids his\nslave rise and stand before him!\"\n\nJust after she had risen, a figure appeared in the doorway.\n\n\"I beg pardon, your Grace; Mother wants to know, will you be lunching\nin?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said the Duke. \"I will ring when I am ready.\" And it dawned on\nhim that this girl, who perhaps loved him, was, according to all known\nstandards, extraordinarily pretty.\n\n\"Will--\" she hesitated, \"will Miss Dobson be--\"\n\n\"No,\" he said. \"I shall be alone.\" And there was in the girl's parting\nhalf-glance at Zuleika that which told him he was truly loved, and made\nhim the more impatient of his offensive and accursed visitor.\n\n\"You want to be rid of me?\" asked Zuleika, when the girl was gone.\n\n\"I have no wish to be rude; but--since you force me to say it--yes.\"\n\n\"Then take me,\" she cried, throwing back her arms, \"and throw me out of\nthe window.\"\n\nHe smiled coldly.\n\n\"You think I don't mean it? You think I would struggle? Try me.\" She let\nherself droop sideways, in an attitude limp and portable. \"Try me,\" she\nrepeated.\n\n\"All this is very well conceived, no doubt,\" said he, \"and well\nexecuted. But it happens to be otiose.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"I mean you may set your mind at rest. I am not going to back out of my\npromise.\"\n\nZuleika flushed. \"You are cruel. I would give the world and all not to\nhave written you that hateful letter. Forget it, forget it, for pity's\nsake!\"\n\nThe Duke looked searchingly at her. \"You mean that you now wish to\nrelease me from my promise?\"\n\n\"Release you? As if you were ever bound! Don't torture me!\"\n\nHe wondered what deep game she was playing. Very real, though, her\nanguish seemed; and, if real it was, then--he stared, he gasped--there\ncould be but one explanation. He put it to her. \"You love me?\"\n\n\"With all my soul.\"\n\nHis heart leapt. If she spoke truth, then indeed vengeance was his! But\n\"What proof have I?\" he asked her.\n\n\"Proof? Have men absolutely NO intuition? If you need proof, produce it.\nWhere are my ear-rings?\"\n\n\"Your ear-rings? Why?\"\n\nImpatiently she pointed to two white pearls that fastened the front\nof her blouse. \"These are your studs. It was from them I had the great\nfirst hint this morning.\"\n\n\"Black and pink, were they not, when you took them?\"\n\n\"Of course. And then I forgot that I had them. When I undressed, they\nmust have rolled on to the carpet. Melisande found them this morning\nwhen she was making the room ready for me to dress. That was just after\nshe came back from bringing you my first letter. I was bewildered. I\ndoubted. Might not the pearls have gone back to their natural state\nsimply through being yours no more? That is why I wrote again to you, my\nown darling--a frantic little questioning letter. When I heard how you\nhad torn it up, I knew, I knew that the pearls had not mocked me. I\ntelescoped my toilet and came rushing round to you. How many hours have\nI been waiting for you?\"\n\nThe Duke had drawn her ear-rings from his waistcoat pocket, and was\ncontemplating them in the palm of his hand. Blanched, both of them, yes.\nHe laid them on the table. \"Take them,\" he said.\n\n\"No,\" she shuddered. \"I could never forget that once they were both\nblack.\" She flung them into the fender. \"Oh John,\" she cried, turning to\nhim and falling again to her knees, \"I do so want to forget what I have\nbeen. I want to atone. You think you can drive me out of your life. You\ncannot, darling--since you won't kill me. Always I shall follow you on\nmy knees, thus.\"\n\nHe looked down at her over his folded arms,\n\n\"I am not going to back out of my promise,\" he repeated.\n\nShe stopped her ears.\n\nWith a stern joy he unfolded his arms, took some papers from his\nbreast-pocket, and, selecting one of them, handed it to her. It was the\ntelegram sent by his steward.\n\nShe read it. With a stern joy he watched her reading it.\n\nWild-eyed, she looked up from it to him, tried to speak, and swerved\ndown senseless.\n\nHe had not foreseen this. \"Help!\" he vaguely cried--was she not a\nfellow-creature?--and rushed blindly out to his bedroom, whence he\nreturned, a moment later, with the water-jug. He dipped his hand, and\nsprinkled the upturned face (Dew-drops on a white rose? But some\nother, sharper analogy hovered to him). He dipped and sprinkled. The\nwater-beads broke, mingled--rivulets now. He dipped and flung, then\ncaught the horrible analogy and rebounded.\n\nIt was at this moment that Zuleika opened her eyes. \"Where am I?\" She\nweakly raised herself on one elbow; and the suspension of the Duke's\nhatred would have been repealed simultaneously with that of her\nconsciousness, had it not already been repealed by the analogy. She put\na hand to her face, then looked at the wet palm wonderingly, looked at\nthe Duke, saw the water-jug beside him. She, too, it seemed, had caught\nthe analogy; for with a wan smile she said \"We are quits now, John,\naren't we?\"\n\nHer poor little jest drew to the Duke's face no answering smile, did\nbut make hotter the blush there. The wave of her returning memory swept\non--swept up to her with a roar the instant past. \"Oh,\" she cried,\nstaggering to her feet, \"the owls, the owls!\"\n\nVengeance was his, and \"Yes, there,\" he said, \"is the ineluctable hard\nfact you wake to. The owls have hooted. The gods have spoken. This day\nyour wish is to be fulfilled.\"\n\n\"The owls have hooted. The gods have spoken. This day--oh, it must not\nbe, John! Heaven have mercy on me!\"\n\n\"The unerring owls have hooted. The dispiteous and humorous gods have\nspoken. Miss Dobson, it has to be. And let me remind you,\" he added,\nwith a glance at his watch, \"that you ought not to keep The MacQuern\nwaiting for luncheon.\"\n\n\"That is unworthy of you,\" she said. There was in her eyes a look that\nmade the words sound as if they had been spoken by a dumb animal.\n\n\"You have sent him an excuse?\"\n\n\"No, I have forgotten him.\"\n\n\"That is unworthy of you. After all, he is going to die for you, like\nthe rest of us. I am but one of a number, you know. Use your sense of\nproportion.\"\n\n\"If I do that,\" she said after a pause, \"you may not be pleased by the\nissue. I may find that whereas yesterday I was great in my sinfulness,\nand to-day am great in my love, you, in your hate of me, are small. I\nmay find that what I had taken to be a great indifference is nothing but\na very small hate... Ah, I have wounded you? Forgive me, a weak woman,\ntalking at random in her wretchedness. Oh John, John, if I thought you\nsmall, my love would but take on the crown of pity. Don't forbid me to\ncall you John. I looked you up in Debrett while I was waiting for you.\nThat seemed to bring you nearer to me. So many other names you have,\ntoo. I remember you told me them all yesterday, here in this room--not\ntwenty-four hours ago. Hours? Years!\" She laughed hysterically. \"John,\ndon't you see why I won't stop talking? It's because I dare not think.\"\n\n\"Yonder in Balliol,\" he suavely said, \"you will find the matter of my\ndeath easier to forget than here.\" He took her hat and gloves from the\narm-chair, and held them carefully out to her; but she did not take\nthem.\n\n\"I give you three minutes,\" he told her. \"Two minutes, that is, in\nwhich to make yourself tidy before the mirror. A third in which to say\ngood-bye and be outside the front-door.\"\n\n\"If I refuse?\"\n\n\"You will not.\"\n\n\"If I do?\"\n\n\"I shall send for a policeman.\"\n\nShe looked well at him. \"Yes,\" she slowly said, \"I think you would do\nthat.\"\n\nShe took her things from him, and laid them by the mirror. With a high\nhand she quelled the excesses of her hair--some of the curls still\nagleam with water--and knowingly poised and pinned her hat. Then, after\na few swift touches and passes at neck and waist, she took her gloves\nand, wheeling round to him, \"There!\" she said, \"I have been quick.\"\n\n\"Admirably,\" he allowed.\n\n\"Quick in more than meets the eye, John. Spiritually quick. You saw me\nputting on my hat; you did not see love taking on the crown of pity, and\nme bonneting her with it, tripping her up and trampling the life out of\nher. Oh, a most cold-blooded business, John! Had to be done, though. No\nother way out. So I just used my sense of proportion, as you rashly\nbade me, and then hardened my heart at sight of you as you are. One of\na number? Yes, and a quite unlovable unit. So I am all right again. And\nnow, where is Balliol? Far from here?\"\n\n\"No,\" he answered, choking a little, as might a card-player who, having\nbeen dealt a splendid hand, and having played it with flawless skill,\nhas yet--damn it!--lost the odd trick. \"Balliol is quite near. At the\nend of this street in fact. I can show it to you from the front-door.\"\n\nYes, he had controlled himself. But this, he furiously felt, did not\nmake him look the less a fool. What ought he to have SAID? He prayed,\nas he followed the victorious young woman downstairs, that l'esprit de\nl'escalier might befall him. Alas, it did not.\n\n\"By the way,\" she said, when he had shown her where Balliol lay, \"have\nyou told anybody that you aren't dying just for me?\"\n\n\"No,\" he answered, \"I have preferred not to.\"\n\n\"Then officially, as it were, and in the eyes of the world, you die for\nme? Then all's well that ends well. Shall we say good-bye here? I\nshall be on the Judas Barge; but I suppose there will be a crush, as\nyesterday?\"\n\n\"Sure to be. There always is on the last night of the Eights, you know.\nGood-bye.\"\n\n\"Good-bye, little John--small John,\" she cried across her shoulder,\nhaving the last word.\n\n\n\n\nXVII\n\nHe might not have grudged her the last word, had she properly needed\nit. Its utter superfluity--the perfection of her victory without it--was\nwhat galled him. Yes, she had outflanked him, taken him unawares, and he\nhad fired not one shot. Esprit de l'escalier--it was as he went upstairs\nthat he saw how he might yet have snatched from her, if not the victory,\nthe palm. Of course he ought to have laughed aloud--\"Capital, capital!\nYou really do deserve to fool me. But ah, yours is a love that can't be\ndissembled. Never was man by maiden loved more ardently than I by you,\nmy poor girl, at this moment.\"\n\nAnd stay!--what if she really HAD been but pretending to have killed her\nlove? He paused on the threshold of his room. The sudden doubt made his\nlost chance the more sickening. Yet was the doubt dear to him ... What\nlikelier, after all, than that she had been pretending? She had already\ntwitted him with his lack of intuition. He had not seen that she\nloved him when she certainly did love him. He had needed the pearls'\ndemonstration of that.--The pearls! THEY would betray her. He darted to\nthe fender, and one of them he espied there instantly--white? A rather\nflushed white, certainly. For the other he had to peer down. There it\nlay, not very distinct on the hearth's black-leading.\n\nHe turned away. He blamed himself for not dismissing from his mind the\nhussy he had dismissed from his room. Oh for an ounce of civet and a\nfew poppies! The water-jug stood as a reminder of the hateful visit\nand of... He took it hastily away into his bedroom. There he washed\nhis hands. The fact that he had touched Zuleika gave to this ablution a\nsymbolism that made it the more refreshing.\n\nCivet, poppies? Was there not, at his call, a sweeter perfume, a\nstronger anodyne? He rang the bell, almost caressingly.\n\nHis heart beat at sound of the clinking and rattling of the tray borne\nup the stairs. She was coming, the girl who loved him, the girl whose\nheart would be broken when he died. Yet, when the tray appeared in the\ndoorway, and she behind it, the tray took precedence of her in his soul\nnot less than in his sight. Twice, after an arduous morning, had his\nluncheon been postponed, and the coming of it now made intolerable the\npangs of his hunger.\n\nAlso, while the girl laid the table-cloth, it occurred to him how\nflimsy, after all, was the evidence that she loved him. Suppose she\ndid nothing of the kind! At the Junta, he had foreseen no difficulty in\nasking her. Now he found himself a prey to embarrassment. He wondered\nwhy. He had not failed in flow of gracious words to Nellie O'Mora. Well,\na miniature by Hoppner was one thing, a landlady's live daughter was\nanother. At any rate, he must prime himself with food. He wished Mrs.\nBatch had sent up something more calorific than cold salmon. He asked\nher daughter what was to follow.\n\n\"There's a pigeon-pie, your Grace.\"\n\n\"Cold? Then please ask your mother to heat it in the oven--quickly.\nAnything after that?\"\n\n\"A custard pudding, your Grace.\"\n\n\"Cold? Let this, too, be heated. And bring up a bottle of champagne,\nplease; and--and a bottle of port.\"\n\nHis was a head that had always hitherto defied the grape. But he thought\nthat to-day, by all he had gone through, by all the shocks he had\nsuffered, and the strains he had steeled himself to bear, as well as by\nthe actual malady that gripped him, he might perchance have been sapped\nenough to experience by reaction that cordial glow of which he had now\nand again seen symptoms in his fellows.\n\nNor was he altogether disappointed of this hope. As the meal progressed,\nand the last of the champagne sparkled in his glass, certain things\nsaid to him by Zuleika--certain implied criticisms that had rankled,\nyes--lost their power to discommode him. He was able to smile at the\nimpertinences of an angry woman, the tantrums of a tenth-rate conjurer\ntold to go away. He felt he had perhaps acted harshly. With all her\nfaults, she had adored him. Yes, he had been arbitrary. There seemed to\nbe a strain of brutality in his nature. Poor Zuleika! He was glad for\nher that she had contrived to master her infatuation... Enough for him\nthat he was loved by this exquisite meek girl who had served him at the\nfeast. Anon, when he summoned her to clear the things away, he would bid\nher tell him the tale of her lowly passion. He poured a second glass\nof port, sipped it, quaffed it, poured a third. The grey gloom of the\nweather did but, as he eyed the bottle, heighten his sense of the rich\nsunshine so long ago imprisoned by the vintner and now released to make\nglad his soul. Even so to be released was the love pent for him in the\nheart of this sweet girl. Would that he loved her in return!... Why not?\n\n\n                             \"Prius insolentem\n                    Serva Briseis niveo colore\n                          Movit Achillem.\"\n\n\nNor were it gracious to invite an avowal of love and offer none in\nreturn. Yet, yet, expansive though his mood was, he could not pretend to\nhimself that he was about to feel in this girl's presence anything but\ngratitude. He might pretend to her? Deception were a very poor return\nindeed for all her kindness. Besides, it might turn her head. Some small\ntoken of his gratitude--some trinket by which to remember him--was all\nthat he could allow himself to offer... What trinket? Would she like\nto have one of his scarf-pins? Studs? Still more abs--Ah! he had it, he\nliterally and most providentially had it, there, in the fender: a pair\nof ear-rings!\n\nHe plucked the pink pearl and the black from where they lay, and rang\nthe bell.\n\nHis sense of dramatic propriety needed that the girl should, before he\naddressed her, perform her task of clearing the table. If she had it\nto perform after telling her love, and after receiving his gift and his\nfarewell, the bathos would be distressing for them both.\n\nBut, while he watched her at her task, he did wish she would be a little\nquicker. For the glow in him seemed to be cooling momently. He wished\nhe had had more than three glasses from the crusted bottle which she was\nputting away into the chiffonier. Down, doubt! Down, sense of disparity!\nThe moment was at hand. Would he let it slip? Now she was folding up the\ntable-cloth, now she was going.\n\n\"Stay!\" he uttered. \"I have something to say to you.\" The girl turned to\nhim.\n\nHe forced his eyes to meet hers. \"I understand,\" he said in a\nconstrained voice, \"that you regard me with sentiments of something more\nthan esteem.--Is this so?\"\n\nThe girl had stepped quickly back, and her face was scarlet.\n\n\"Nay,\" he said, having to go through with it now, \"there is no cause for\nembarrassment. And I am sure you will acquit me of wanton curiosity. Is\nit a fact that you--love me?\"\n\nShe tried to speak, could not. But she nodded her head.\n\nThe Duke, much relieved, came nearer to her.\n\n\"What is your name?\" he asked gently.\n\n\"Katie,\" she was able to gasp.\n\n\"Well, Katie, how long have you loved me?\"\n\n\"Ever since,\" she faltered, \"ever since you came to engage the rooms.\"\n\n\"You are not, of course, given to idolising any tenant of your\nmother's?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"May I boast myself the first possessor of your heart?\"\n\n\"Yes.\" She had become very pale now, and was trembling painfully.\n\n\"And may I assume that your love for me has been entirely\ndisinterested?... You do not catch my meaning? I will put my question in\nanother way. In loving me, you never supposed me likely to return your\nlove?\"\n\nThe girl looked up at him quickly, but at once her eyelids fluttered\ndown again.\n\n\"Come, come!\" said the Duke. \"My question is a plain one. Did you ever\nfor an instant suppose, Katie, that I might come to love you?\"\n\n\"No,\" she said in a whisper; \"I never dared to hope that.\"\n\n\"Precisely,\" said he. \"You never imagined that you had anything to\ngain by your affection. You were not contriving a trap for me. You were\nupheld by no hope of becoming a young Duchess, with more frocks than\nyou could wear and more dross than you could scatter. I am glad. I\nam touched. You are the first woman that has loved me in that way. Or\nrather,\" he muttered, \"the first but one. And she... Answer me,\" he\nsaid, standing over the girl, and speaking with a great intensity. \"If I\nwere to tell you that I loved you, would you cease to love me?\"\n\n\"Oh your Grace!\" cried the girl. \"Why no! I never dared--\"\n\n\"Enough!\" he said. \"The catechism is ended. I have something which I\nshould like to give you. Are your ears pierced?\"\n\n\"Yes, your Grace.\"\n\n\"Then, Katie, honour me by accepting this present.\" So saying, he placed\nin the girl's hand the black pearl and the pink. The sight of them\nbanished for a moment all other emotions in their recipient. She forgot\nherself. \"Lor!\" she said.\n\n\"I hope you will wear them always for my sake,\" said the Duke.\n\nShe had expressed herself in the monosyllable. No words came to her\nlips, but to her eyes many tears, through which the pearls were\nvisible. They whirled in her bewildered brain as a token that she was\nloved--loved by HIM, though but yesterday he had loved another. It was\nall so sudden, so beautiful. You might have knocked her down (she says\nso to this day) with a feather. Seeing her agitation, the Duke pointed\nto a chair, bade her be seated.\n\nHer mind was cleared by the new posture. Suspicion crept into it,\nfollowed by alarm. She looked at the ear-rings, then up at the Duke.\n\n\"No,\" said he, misinterpreting the question in her eyes, \"they are real\npearls.\"\n\n\"It isn't that,\" she quavered, \"it is--it is--\"\n\n\"That they were given to me by Miss Dobson?\"\n\n\"Oh, they were, were they? Then\"--Katie rose, throwing the pearls on the\nfloor--\"I'll have nothing to do with them. I hate her.\"\n\n\"So do I,\" said the Duke, in a burst of confidence. \"No, I don't,\" he\nadded hastily. \"Please forget that I said that.\"\n\nIt occurred to Katie that Miss Dobson would be ill-pleased that the\npearls should pass to her. She picked them up.\n\n\"Only--only--\" again her doubts beset her and she looked from the pearls\nto the Duke.\n\n\"Speak on,\" he said.\n\n\"Oh you aren't playing with me, are you? You don't mean me harm, do you?\nI have been well brought up. I have been warned against things. And it\nseems so strange, what you have said to me. You are a Duke, and I--I am\nonly--\"\n\n\"It is the privilege of nobility to condescend.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes,\" she cried. \"I see. Oh I was wicked to doubt you. And love\nlevels all, doesn't it? love and the Board school. Our stations are far\napart, but I've been educated far above mine. I've learnt more than most\nreal ladies have. I passed the Seventh Standard when I was only just\nfourteen. I was considered one of the sharpest girls in the school. And\nI've gone on learning since then,\" she continued eagerly. \"I utilise all\nmy spare moments. I've read twenty-seven of the Hundred Best Books. I\ncollect ferns. I play the piano, whenever...\" She broke off, for she\nremembered that her music was always interrupted by the ringing of the\nDuke's bell and a polite request that it should cease.\n\n\"I am glad to hear of these accomplishments. They do you great credit, I\nam sure. But--well, I do not quite see why you enumerate them just now.\"\n\n\"It isn't that I am vain,\" she pleaded. \"I only mentioned them because\n... oh, don't you see? If I'm not ignorant, I shan't disgrace you.\nPeople won't be so able to say you've been and thrown yourself away.\"\n\n\"Thrown myself away? What do you mean?\"\n\n\"Oh, they'll make all sorts of objections, I know. They'll all be\nagainst me, and--\"\n\n\"For heaven's sake, explain yourself.\"\n\n\"Your aunt, she looked a very proud lady--very high and hard. I thought\nso when she came here last term. But you're of age. You're your own\nmaster. Oh, I trust you; you'll stand by me. If you love me really you\nwon't listen to them.\"\n\n\"Love you? I? Are you mad?\"\n\nEach stared at the other, utterly bewildered.\n\nThe girl was the first to break the silence. Her voice came in a\nwhisper. \"You've not been playing a joke on me? You meant what you said,\ndidn't you?\"\n\n\"What have I said?\"\n\n\"You said you loved me.\"\n\n\"You must be dreaming.\"\n\n\"I'm not. Here are the ear-rings you gave me.\" She pinched them as\nmaterial proof. \"You said you loved me just before you gave me them.\nYou know you did. And if I thought you'd been laughing at me all the\ntime--I'd--I'd\"--a sob choked her voice--\"I'd throw them in your face!\"\n\n\"You must not speak to me in that manner,\" said the Duke coldly. \"And\nlet me warn you that this attempt to trap me and intimidate me--\"\n\nThe girl had flung the ear-rings at his face. She had missed her mark.\nBut this did not extenuate the outrageous gesture. He pointed to the\ndoor. \"Go!\" he said.\n\n\"Don't try that on!\" she laughed. \"I shan't go--not unless you drag\nme out. And if you do that, I'll raise the house. I'll have in the\nneighbours. I'll tell them all what you've done, and--\" But defiance\nmelted in the hot shame of humiliation. \"Oh, you coward!\" she gasped.\n\"You coward!\" She caught her apron to her face and, swaying against the\nwall, sobbed piteously.\n\nUnaccustomed to love-affairs, the Duke could not sail lightly over a\nflood of woman's tears. He was filled with pity for the poor quivering\nfigure against the wall. How should he soothe her? Mechanically he\npicked up the two pearls from the carpet, and crossed to her side. He\ntouched her on the shoulder. She shuddered away from him.\n\n\"Don't,\" he said gently. \"Don't cry. I can't bear it. I have been stupid\nand thoughtless. What did you say your name was? 'Katie,' to be sure.\nWell, Katie, I want to beg your pardon. I expressed myself badly. I was\nunhappy and lonely, and I saw in you a means of comfort. I snatched\nat you, Katie, as at a straw. And then, I suppose, I must have said\nsomething which made you think I loved you. I almost wish I did. I don't\nwonder you threw the ear-rings at me. I--I almost wish they had hit\nme... You see, I have quite forgiven you. Now do you forgive me. You\nwill not refuse now to wear the ear-rings. I gave them to you as a\nkeepsake. Wear them always in memory of me. For you will never see me\nagain.\"\n\nThe girl had ceased from crying, and her anger had spent itself in sobs.\nShe was gazing at him woebegone but composed.\n\n\"Where are you going?\"\n\n\"You must not ask that,\" said he. \"Enough that my wings are spread.\"\n\n\"Are you going because of ME?\"\n\n\"Not in the least. Indeed, your devotion is one of the things which make\nbitter my departure. And yet--I am glad you love me.\"\n\n\"Don't go,\" she faltered. He came nearer to her, and this time she did\nnot shrink from him. \"Don't you find the rooms comfortable?\" she asked,\ngazing up at him. \"Have you ever had any complaint to make about the\nattendance?\"\n\n\"No,\" said the Duke, \"the attendance has always been quite satisfactory.\nI have never felt that so keenly as I do to-day.\"\n\n\"Then why are you leaving? Why are you breaking my heart?\"\n\n\"Suffice it that I cannot do otherwise. Henceforth you will see me no\nmore. But I doubt not that in the cultivation of my memory you will find\nsome sort of lugubrious satisfaction. See! here are the ear-rings. If\nyou like, I will put them in with my own hands.\"\n\nShe held up her face side-ways. Into the lobe of her left ear he\ninsinuated the hook of the black pearl. On the cheek upturned to him\nthere were still traces of tears; the eyelashes were still spangled. For\nall her blondness, they were quite dark, these glistening eyelashes. He\nhad an impulse, which he put from him. \"Now the other ear,\" he said. The\ngirl turned her head. Soon the pink pearl was in its place. Yet the girl\ndid not move. She seemed to be waiting. Nor did the Duke himself seem to\nbe quite satisfied. He let his fingers dally with the pearl. Anon, with\na sigh, he withdrew them. The girl looked up. Their eyes met. He looked\naway from her. He turned away from her. \"You may kiss my hand,\" he\nmurmured, extending it towards her. After a pause, the warm pressure\nof her lips was laid on it. He sighed, but did not look round. Another\npause, a longer pause, and then the clatter and clink of the outgoing\ntray.\n\n\n\n\nXVIII\n\nHer actual offspring does not suffice a very motherly woman. Such a\nwoman was Mrs. Batch. Had she been blest with a dozen children, she\nmust yet have regarded herself as also a mother to whatever two young\ngentlemen were lodging under her roof. Childless but for Katie and\nClarence, she had for her successive pairs of tenants a truly vast fund\nof maternal feeling to draw on. Nor were the drafts made in secret. To\nevery gentleman, from the outset, she proclaimed the relation in which\nshe would stand to him. Moreover, always she needed a strong filial\nsense in return: this was only fair.\n\nBecause the Duke was an orphan, even more than because he was a Duke,\nher heart had with a special rush gone out to him when he and Mr. Noaks\nbecame her tenants. But, perhaps because he had never known a mother,\nhe was evidently quite incapable of conceiving either Mrs. Batch as his\nmother or himself as her son. Indeed, there was that in his manner,\nin his look, which made her falter, for once, in exposition of her\ntheory--made her postpone the matter to some more favourable time. That\ntime never came, somehow. Still, her solicitude for him, her pride in\nhim, her sense that he was a great credit to her, rather waxed than\nwaned. He was more to her (such are the vagaries of the maternal\ninstinct) than Katie or Mr. Noaks: he was as much as Clarence.\n\nIt was, therefore, a deeply agitated woman who now came heaving up into\nthe Duke's presence. His Grace was \"giving notice\"? She was sure she\nbegged his pardon for coming up so sudden. But the news was that\nsudden. Hadn't her girl made a mistake, maybe? Girls were so vague-like\nnowadays. She was sure it was most kind of him to give those handsome\near-rings. But the thought of him going off so unexpected--middle of\nterm, too--with never a why or a but! Well!\n\nIn some such welter of homely phrase (how foreign to these classic\npages!) did Mrs. Batch utter her pain. The Duke answered her tersely but\nkindly. He apologised for going so abruptly, and said he would be very\nhappy to write for her future use a testimonial to the excellence of\nher rooms and of her cooking; and with it he would give her a cheque not\nonly for the full term's rent, and for his board since the beginning of\nterm, but also for such board as he would have been likely to have in\nthe term's remainder. He asked her to present her accounts forthwith.\n\nHe occupied the few minutes of her absence by writing the testimonial.\nIt had shaped itself in his mind as a short ode in Doric Greek. But, for\nthe benefit of Mrs. Batch, he chose to do a rough equivalent in English.\n\n\n     TO AN UNDERGRADUATE NEEDING\n     ROOMS IN OXFORD\n\n     (A Sonnet in Oxfordshire Dialect)\n\n     Zeek w'ere thee will in t'Univursity,\n     Lad, thee'll not vind nor bread nor bed that\n          matches\n     Them as thee'll vind, roight zure, at Mrs.\n          Batch's...\n\n\nI do not quote the poem in extenso, because, frankly, I think it was one\nof his least happily-inspired works. His was not a Muse that could with\na good grace doff the grand manner. Also, his command of the Oxfordshire\ndialect seems to me based less on study than on conjecture. In fact, I\ndo not place the poem higher than among the curiosities of literature.\nIt has extrinsic value, however, as illustrating the Duke's\nthoughtfulness for others in the last hours of his life. And to Mrs.\nBatch the MS., framed and glazed in her hall, is an asset beyond price\n(witness her recent refusal of Mr. Pierpont Morgan's sensational bid for\nit).\n\nThis MS. she received together with the Duke's cheque. The presentation\nwas made some twenty minutes after she had laid her accounts before him.\n\nLavish in giving large sums of his own accord, he was apt to be\ncircumspect in the matter of small payments. Such is ever the way of\nopulent men. Nor do I see that we have a right to sneer at them for it.\nWe cannot deny that their existence is a temptation to us. It is in our\nfallen nature to want to get something out of them; and, as we think in\nsmall sums (heaven knows), it is of small sums that they are careful.\nAbsurd to suppose they really care about halfpence. It must, therefore,\nbe about us that they care; and we ought to be grateful to them for the\npains they are at to keep us guiltless. I do not suggest that Mrs. Batch\nhad at any point overcharged the Duke; but how was he to know that she\nhad not done so, except by checking the items, as was his wont? The\nreductions that he made, here and there, did not in all amount to\nthree-and-sixpence. I do not say they were just. But I do say that his\nmotive for making them, and his satisfaction at having made them, were\nrather beautiful than otherwise.\n\nHaving struck an average of Mrs. Batch's weekly charges, and a similar\naverage of his own reductions, he had a basis on which to reckon his\nboard for the rest of the term. This amount he added to Mrs. Batch's\namended total, plus the full term's rent, and accordingly drew a cheque\non the local bank where he had an account. Mrs. Batch said she would\nbring up a stamped receipt directly; but this the Duke waived,\nsaying that the cashed cheque itself would be a sufficient receipt.\nAccordingly, he reduced by one penny the amount written on the cheque.\nRemembering to initial the correction, he remembered also, with a\nmelancholy smile, that to-morrow the cheque would not be negotiable.\nHanding it, and the sonnet, to Mrs. Batch, he bade her cash it before\nthe bank closed. \"And,\" he said, with a glance at his watch, \"you have\nno time to lose. It is a quarter to four.\" Only two hours and a quarter\nbefore the final races! How quickly the sands were running out!\n\nMrs. Batch paused on the threshold, wanted to know if she could \"help\nwith the packing.\" The Duke replied that he was taking nothing with him:\nhis various things would be sent for, packed, and removed, within a few\ndays. No, he did not want her to order a cab. He was going to walk. And\n\"Good-bye, Mrs. Batch,\" he said. \"For legal reasons with which I won't\nburden you, you really must cash that cheque at once.\"\n\nHe sat down in solitude; and there crept over him a mood of deep\ndepression... Almost two hours and a quarter before the final races!\nWhat on earth should he do in the meantime? He seemed to have done all\nthat there was for him to do. His executors would do the rest. He had no\nfarewell-letters to write. He had no friends with whom he was on terms\nof valediction. There was nothing at all for him to do. He stared\nblankly out of the window, at the greyness and blackness of the sky.\nWhat a day! What a climate! Why did any sane person live in England? He\nfelt positively suicidal.\n\nHis dully vagrant eye lighted on the bottle of Cold Mixture. He ought to\nhave dosed himself a full hour ago. Well, he didn't care.\n\nHad Zuleika noticed the bottle? he idly wondered. Probably not. She\nwould have made some sprightly reference to it before she went.\n\nSince there was nothing to do but sit and think, he wished he could\nrecapture that mood in which at luncheon he had been able to see Zuleika\nas an object for pity. Never, till to-day, had he seen things otherwise\nthan they were. Nor had he ever needed to. Never, till last night, had\nthere been in his life anything he needed to forget. That woman! As\nif it really mattered what she thought of him. He despised himself for\nwishing to forget she despised him. But the wish was the measure of the\nneed. He eyed the chiffonier. Should he again solicit the grape?\n\nReluctantly he uncorked the crusted bottle, and filled a glass. Was he\ncome to this? He sighed and sipped, quaffed and sighed. The spell of the\nold stored sunshine seemed not to work, this time. He could not cease\nfrom plucking at the net of ignominies in which his soul lay enmeshed.\nWould that he had died yesterday, escaping how much!\n\nNot for an instant did he flinch from the mere fact of dying to-day.\nSince he was not immortal, as he had supposed, it were as well he should\ndie now as fifty years hence. Better, indeed. To die \"untimely,\" as men\ncalled it, was the timeliest of all deaths for one who had carved his\nyouth to greatness. What perfection could he, Dorset, achieve beyond\nwhat was already his? Future years could but stale, if not actually\nmar, that perfection. Yes, it was lucky to perish leaving much to the\nimagination of posterity. Dear posterity was of a sentimental, not\na realistic, habit. She always imagined the dead young hero prancing\ngloriously up to the Psalmist's limit a young hero still; and it was the\nsense of her vast loss that kept his memory green. Byron!--he would be\nall forgotten to-day if he had lived to be a florid old gentleman with\niron-grey whiskers, writing very long, very able letters to \"The Times\"\nabout the Repeal of the Corn Laws. Yes, Byron would have been that. It\nwas indicated in him. He would have been an old gentleman exacerbated by\nQueen Victoria's invincible prejudice against him, her brusque refusal\nto \"entertain\" Lord John Russell's timid nomination of him for a post\nin the Government... Shelley would have been a poet to the last. But how\ndull, how very dull, would have been the poetry of his middle age!--a\ngreat unreadable mass interposed between him and us... Did Byron, mused\nthe Duke, know what was to be at Missolonghi? Did he know that he was\nto die in service of the Greeks whom he despised? Byron might not have\nminded that. But what if the Greeks had told him, in so many words,\nthat they despised HIM? How would he have felt then? Would he have been\ncontent with his potations of barley-water?... The Duke replenished his\nglass, hoping the spell might work yet.... Perhaps, had Byron not been a\ndandy--but ah, had he not been in his soul a dandy there would have\nbeen no Byron worth mentioning. And it was because he guarded not his\ndandyism against this and that irrelevant passion, sexual or political,\nthat he cut so annoyingly incomplete a figure. He was absurd in his\npolitics, vulgar in his loves. Only in himself, at the times when he\nstood haughtily aloof, was he impressive. Nature, fashioning him, had\nfashioned also a pedestal for him to stand and brood on, to pose and\nsing on. Off that pedestal he was lost.... \"The idol has come sliding\ndown from its pedestal\"--the Duke remembered these words spoken\nyesterday by Zuleika. Yes, at the moment when he slid down, he, too, was\nlost. For him, master-dandy, the common arena was no place. What had he\nto do with love? He was an utter fool at it. Byron had at least had some\nfun out of it. What fun had HE had? Last night, he had forgotten to kiss\nZuleika when he held her by the wrists. To-day it had been as much as he\ncould do to let poor little Katie kiss his hand. Better be vulgar\nwith Byron than a noodle with Dorset! he bitterly reflected... Still,\nnoodledom was nearer than vulgarity to dandyism. It was a less flagrant\nlapse. And he had over Byron this further advantage: his noodledom was\nnot a matter of common knowledge; whereas Byron's vulgarity had ever\nneeded to be in the glare of the footlights of Europe. The world\nwould say of him that he laid down his life for a woman. Deplorable\nsomersault? But nothing evident save this in his whole life was\nfaulty... The one other thing that might be carped at--the partisan\nspeech he made in the Lords--had exquisitely justified itself by its\nresult. For it was as a Knight of the Garter that he had set the perfect\nseal on his dandyism. Yes, he reflected, it was on the day when first\nhe donned the most grandiose of all costumes, and wore it grandlier\nthan ever yet in history had it been worn, than ever would it be worn\nhereafter, flaunting the robes with a grace unparalleled and inimitable,\nand lending, as it were, to the very insignia a glory beyond their own,\nthat he once and for all fulfilled himself, doer of that which he had\nbeen sent into the world to do.\n\nAnd there floated into his mind a desire, vague at first, soon definite,\nimperious, irresistible, to see himself once more, before he died,\nindued in the fulness of his glory and his might.\n\nNothing hindered. There was yet a whole hour before he need start for\nthe river. His eyes dilated, somewhat as might those of a child about to\n\"dress up\" for a charade; and already, in his impatience, he had undone\nhis neck-tie.\n\nOne after another, he unlocked and threw open the black tin boxes,\nsnatching out greedily their great good splendours of crimson and white\nand royal blue and gold. You wonder he was not appalled by the task of\nessaying unaided a toilet so extensive and so intricate? You wondered\neven when you heard that he was wont at Oxford to make without help his\ntoilet of every day. Well, the true dandy is always capable of such high\nindependence. He is craftsman as well as artist. And, though any unaided\nKnight but he with whom we are here concerned would belike have doddered\nhopeless in that labyrinth of hooks and buckles which underlies the\nvisible glory of a Knight \"arraied full and proper,\" Dorset threaded his\nway featly and without pause. He had mastered his first excitement. In\nhis swiftness was no haste. His procedure had the ease and inevitability\nof a natural phenomenon, and was most like to the coming of a rainbow.\n\nCrimson-doubleted, blue-ribanded, white-trunk-hosed, he stooped to\nunderstrap his left knee with that strap of velvet round which\nsparkles the proud gay motto of the Order. He affixed to his breast the\noctoradiant star, so much larger and more lustrous than any actual star\nin heaven. Round his neck he slung that long daedal chain wherefrom St.\nGeorge, slaying the Dragon, dangles. He bowed his shoulders to assume\nthat vast mantle of blue velvet, so voluminous, so enveloping, that,\ndespite the Cross of St. George blazing on it, and the shoulder-knots\nlike two great white tropical flowers planted on it, we seem to know\nfrom it in what manner of mantle Elijah prophesied. Across his breast\nhe knotted this mantle's two cords of gleaming bullion, one tassel a\ndue trifle higher than its fellow. All these things being done, he moved\naway from the mirror, and drew on a pair of white kid gloves. Both of\nthese being buttoned, he plucked up certain folds of his mantle into the\nhollow of his left arm, and with his right hand gave to his left hand\nthat ostrich-plumed and heron-plumed hat of black velvet in which a\nKnight of the Garter is entitled to take his walks abroad. Then, with\nhead erect, and measured tread, he returned to the mirror.\n\nYou are thinking, I know, of Mr. Sargent's famous portrait of him.\nForget it. Tankerton Hall is open to the public on Wednesdays. Go\nthere, and in the dining-hall stand to study well Sir Thomas Lawrence's\nportrait of the eleventh Duke. Imagine a man some twenty years younger\nthan he whom you there behold, but having some such features and some\nsuch bearing, and clad in just such robes. Sublimate the dignity of\nthat bearing and of those features, and you will then have seen the\nfourteenth Duke somewhat as he stood reflected in the mirror of his\nroom. Resist your impulse to pass on to the painting which hangs next\nbut two to Lawrence's. It deserves, I know, all that you said about it\nwhen (at the very time of the events in this chronicle) it was hanging\nin Burlington House. Marvellous, I grant you, are those passes of the\nswirling brush by which the velvet of the mantle is rendered--passes so\nlight and seemingly so fortuitous, yet, seen at the right distance,\nso absolute in their power to create an illusion of the actual velvet.\nSheen of white satin and silk, glint of gold, glitter of diamonds--never\nwere such things caught by surer hand obedient to more voracious eye.\nYes, all the splendid surface of everything is there. Yet must you not\nlook. The soul is not there. An expensive, very new costume is there,\nbut no evocation of the high antique things it stands for; whereas by\nthe Duke it was just these things that were evoked to make an aura round\nhim, a warm symbolic glow sharpening the outlines of his own\nparticular magnificence. Reflecting him, the mirror reflected, in due\nsubordination, the history of England. There is nothing of that on Mr.\nSargent's canvas. Obtruded instead is the astounding slickness of Mr.\nSargent's technique: not the sitter, but the painter, is master here.\nNay, though I hate to say it, there is in the portrayal of the Duke's\nattitude and expression a hint of something like mockery--unintentional,\nI am sure, but to a sensitive eye discernible. And--but it is clumsy of\nme to be reminding you of the very picture I would have you forget.\n\nLong stood the Duke gazing, immobile. One thing alone ruffled his deep\ninward calm. This was the thought that he must presently put off from\nhim all his splendour, and be his normal self.\n\nThe shadow passed from his brow. He would go forth as he was. He would\nbe true to the motto he wore, and true to himself. A dandy he had lived.\nIn the full pomp and radiance of his dandyism he would die.\n\nHis soul rose from calm to triumph. A smile lit his face, and he held\nhis head higher than ever. He had brought nothing into this world and\ncould take nothing out of it? Well, what he loved best he could carry\nwith him to the very end; and in death they would not be divided.\n\nThe smile was still on his face as he passed out from his room. Down\nthe stairs he passed, and \"Oh,\" every stair creaked faintly, \"I ought to\nhave been marble!\"\n\nAnd it did indeed seem that Mrs. Batch and Katie, who had hurried\nout into the hall, were turned to some kind of stone at sight of the\ndescending apparition. A moment ago, Mrs. Batch had been hoping she\nmight yet at the last speak motherly words. A hopeless mute now! A\nmoment ago, Katie's eyelids had been red with much weeping. Even from\nthem the colour suddenly ebbed now. Dead-white her face was between the\nblack pearl and the pink. \"And this is the man of whom I dared once for\nan instant hope that he loved me!\"--it was thus that the Duke, quite\ncorrectly, interpreted her gaze.\n\nTo her and to her mother he gave an inclusive bow as he swept slowly by.\nStone was the matron, and stone the maid.\n\nStone, too, the Emperors over the way; and the more poignantly thereby\nwas the Duke a sight to anguish them, being the very incarnation of what\nthemselves had erst been, or tried to be. But in this bitterness they\ndid not forget their sorrow at his doom. They were in a mood to forgive\nhim the one fault they had ever found in him--his indifference to their\nKatie. And now--o mirum mirorum--even this one fault was wiped out.\n\nFor, stung by memory of a gibe lately cast at him by himself, the Duke\nhad paused and, impulsively looking back into the hall, had beckoned\nKatie to him; and she had come (she knew not how) to him; and there,\nstanding on the doorstep whose whiteness was the symbol of her love,\nhe--very lightly, it is true, and on the upmost confines of the brow,\nbut quite perceptibly--had kissed her.\n\n\n\n\nXIX\n\nAnd now he had passed under the little arch between the eighth and the\nninth Emperor, rounded the Sheldonian, and been lost to sight of Katie,\nwhom, as he was equally glad and sorry he had kissed her, he was able to\ndismiss from his mind.\n\nIn the quadrangle of the Old Schools he glanced round at the familiar\nlabels, blue and gold, over the iron-studded doors,--Schola Theologiae\net Antiquae Philosophiae; Museum Arundelianum; Schola Musicae. And\nBibliotheca Bodleiana--he paused there, to feel for the last time the\nvague thrill he had always felt at sight of the small and devious portal\nthat had lured to itself, and would always lure, so many scholars from\nthe ends of the earth, scholars famous and scholars obscure, scholars\npolyglot and of the most diverse bents, but none of them not stirred in\nheart somewhat on the found threshold of the treasure-house. \"How\ndeep, how perfect, the effect made here by refusal to make any effect\nwhatsoever!\" thought the Duke. Perhaps, after all... but no: one could\nlay down no general rule. He flung his mantle a little wider from his\nbreast, and proceeded into Radcliffe Square.\n\nAnother farewell look he gave to the old vast horse-chestnut that is\ncalled Bishop Heber's tree. Certainly, no: there was no general rule.\nWith its towering and bulging masses of verdure tricked out all over in\ntheir annual finery of catkins, Bishop Heber's tree stood for the very\ntype of ingenuous ostentation. And who should dare cavil? who not be\ngladdened? Yet awful, more than gladdening, was the effect that the tree\nmade to-day. Strangely pale was the verdure against the black sky; and\nthe multitudinous catkins had a look almost ghostly. The Duke remembered\nthe legend that every one of these fair white spires of blossom is\nthe spirit of some dead man who, having loved Oxford much and well, is\nsuffered thus to revisit her, for a brief while, year by year. And\nit pleased him to doubt not that on one of the topmost branches, next\nSpring, his own spirit would be.\n\n\"Oh, look!\" cried a young lady emerging with her brother and her aunt\nthrough the gate of Brasenose.\n\n\"For heaven's sake, Jessie, try to behave yourself,\" hissed her brother.\n\"Aunt Mabel, for heaven's sake don't stare.\" He compelled the pair to\nwalk on with him. \"Jessie, if you look round over your shoulder...\nNo, it is NOT the Vice-Chancellor. It's Dorset, of Judas--the Duke of\nDorset... Why on earth shouldn't he?... No, it isn't odd in the least...\nNo, I'm NOT losing my temper. Only, don't call me your dear boy... No,\nwe will NOT walk slowly so as to let him pass us... Jessie, if you look\nround...\"\n\nPoor fellow! However fond an undergraduate be of his womenfolk, at\nOxford they keep him in a painful state of tension: at any moment they\nmay somehow disgrace him. And if throughout the long day he shall have\nhad the added strain of guarding them from the knowledge that he is\nabout to commit suicide, a certain measure of irritability must be\ncondoned.\n\nPoor Jessie and Aunt Mabel! They were destined to remember that Harold\nhad been \"very peculiar\" all day. They had arrived in the morning, happy\nand eager despite the menace of the sky, and--well, they were destined\nto reproach themselves for having felt that Harold was \"really rather\nimpossible.\" Oh, if he had only confided in them! They could have\nreasoned with him, saved him--surely they could have saved him! When he\ntold them that the \"First Division\" of the races was always very dull,\nand that they had much better let him go to it alone,--when he told them\nthat it was always very rowdy, and that ladies were not supposed to be\nthere--oh, why had they not guessed and clung to him, and kept him away\nfrom the river?\n\nWell, here they were, walking on Harold's either side, blind to fate,\nand only longing to look back at the gorgeous personage behind them.\nAunt Mabel had inwardly calculated that the velvet of the mantle alone\ncould not have cost less than four guineas a yard. One good look back,\nand she would be able to calculate how many yards there were... She\nfollowed the example of Lot's wife; and Jessie followed hers.\n\n\"Very well,\" said Harold. \"That settles it. I go alone.\" And he was gone\nlike an arrow, across the High, down Oriel Street.\n\nThe two women stood staring ruefully at each other.\n\n\"Pardon me,\" said the Duke, with a sweep of his plumed hat. \"I observe\nyou are stranded; and, if I read your thoughts aright, you are impugning\nthe courtesy of that young runagate. Neither of you, I am very sure, is\nas one of those ladies who in Imperial Rome took a saucy pleasure in the\nspectacle of death. Neither of you can have been warned by your escort\nthat you were on the way to see him die, of his own accord, in company\nwith many hundreds of other lads, myself included. Therefore, regard his\nflight from you as an act not of unkindness, but of tardy compunction.\nThe hint you have had from him let me turn into a counsel. Go back, both\nof you, to the place whence you came.\"\n\n\"Thank you SO much,\" said Aunt Mabel, with what she took to be great\npresence of mind. \"MOST kind of you. We'll do JUST what you tell us.\nCome, Jessie dear,\" and she hurried her niece away with her.\n\nSomething in her manner of fixing him with her eye had made the Duke\nsuspect what was in her mind. Well, she would find out her mistake soon\nenough, poor woman. He desired, however, that her mistake should be made\nby no one else. He would give no more warnings.\n\nTragic it was for him, in Merton Street, to see among the crowd\nconverging to the meadows so many women, young and old, all imprescient,\ntroubled by nothing but the thunder that was in the air, that was on the\nbrows of their escorts. He knew not whether it was for their escorts or\nfor them that he felt the greater pity; and an added load for his heart\nwas the sense of his partial responsibility for what impended. But\nhis lips were sealed now. Why should he not enjoy the effect he was\ncreating?\n\nIt was with a measured tread, as yesterday with Zuleika, that he entered\nthe avenue of elms. The throng streamed past from behind him, parting\nwide, and marvelling as it streamed. Under the pall of this evil evening\nhis splendour was the more inspiring. And, just as yesterday no man had\nquestioned his right to be with Zuleika, so to-day there was none to\ndeem him caparisoned too much. All the men felt at a glance that\nhe, coming to meet death thus, did no more than the right homage to\nZuleika--aye, and that he made them all partakers in his own glory,\ncasting his great mantle over all commorients. Reverence forbade them to\ndo more than glance. But the women with them were impelled by wonder to\nstare hard, uttering sharp little cries that mingled with the cawing of\nthe rooks overhead. Thus did scores of men find themselves shamed like\nour friend Harold. But this, you say, was no more than a just return for\ntheir behaviour yesterday, when, in this very avenue, so many women were\nalmost crushed to death by them in their insensate eagerness to see Miss\nDobson.\n\nTo-day by scores of women it was calculated not only that the velvet of\nthe Duke's mantle could not have cost less than four guineas a yard, but\nalso that there must be quite twenty-five yards of it. Some of the fair\nmathematicians had, in the course of the past fortnight, visited the\nRoyal Academy and seen there Mr. Sargent's portrait of the wearer, so\nthat their estimate now was but the endorsement of an estimate already\nmade. Yet their impression of the Duke was above all a spiritual one.\nThe nobility of his face and bearing was what most thrilled them as they\nwent by; and those of them who had heard the rumour that he was in love\nwith that frightfully flashy-looking creature, Zuleika Dobson, were more\nthan ever sure there wasn't a word of truth in it.\n\nAs he neared the end of the avenue, the Duke was conscious of a thinning\nin the procession on either side of him, and anon he was aware that not\none undergraduate was therein. And he knew at once--did not need to look\nback to know--why this was. SHE was coming.\n\nYes, she had come into the avenue, her magnetism speeding before her,\ninsomuch that all along the way the men immediately ahead of her looked\nround, beheld her, stood aside for her. With her walked The MacQuern,\nand a little bodyguard of other blest acquaintances; and behind her\nswayed the dense mass of the disorganised procession. And now the last\nrank between her and the Duke was broken, and at the revealed vision\nof him she faltered midway in some raillery she was addressing to The\nMacQuern. Her eyes were fixed, her lips were parted, her tread had\nbecome stealthy. With a brusque gesture of dismissal to the men beside\nher, she darted forward, and lightly overtook the Duke just as he was\nturning towards the barges.\n\n\"May I?\" she whispered, smiling round into his face.\n\nHis shoulder-knots just perceptibly rose.\n\n\"There isn't a policeman in sight, John. You're at my mercy. No, no;\nI'm at yours. Tolerate me. You really do look quite wonderful. There, I\nwon't be so impertinent as to praise you. Only let me be with you. Will\nyou?\"\n\nThe shoulder-knots repeated their answer.\n\n\"You needn't listen to me; needn't look at me--unless you care to use my\neyes as mirrors. Only let me be seen with you. That's what I want. Not\nthat your society isn't a boon in itself, John. Oh, I've been so bored\nsince I left you. The MacQuern is too, too dull, and so are his friends.\nOh, that meal with them in Balliol! As soon as I grew used to the\nthought that they were going to die for me, I simply couldn't stand\nthem. Poor boys! it was as much as I could do not to tell them I wished\nthem dead already. Indeed, when they brought me down for the first\nraces, I did suggest that they might as well die now as later. Only they\nlooked very solemn and said it couldn't possibly be done till after the\nfinal races. And oh, the tea with them! What have YOU been doing all the\nafternoon? Oh John, after THEM, I could almost love you again. Why can't\none fall in love with a man's clothes? To think that all those splendid\nthings you have on are going to be spoilt--all for me. Nominally for\nme, that is. It is very wonderful, John. I do appreciate it, really and\ntruly, though I know you think I don't. John, if it weren't mere spite\nyou feel for me--but it's no good talking about that. Come, let us be as\ncheerful as we may be. Is this the Judas house-boat?\"\n\n\"The Judas barge,\" said the Duke, irritated by a mistake which but\nyesterday had rather charmed him.\n\nAs he followed his companion across the plank, there came dully from the\nhills the first low growl of the pent storm. The sound struck for him a\nstrange contrast with the prattle he had perforce been listening to.\n\n\"Thunder,\" said Zuleika over her shoulder.\n\n\"Evidently,\" he answered.\n\nHalf-way up the stairs to the roof, she looked round. \"Aren't you\ncoming?\" she asked.\n\nHe shook his head, and pointed to the raft in front of the barge. She\nquickly descended.\n\n\"Forgive me,\" he said, \"my gesture was not a summons. The raft is for\nmen.\"\n\n\"What do you want to do on it?\"\n\n\"To wait there till the races are over.\"\n\n\"But--what do you mean? Aren't you coming up on to the roof at all?\nYesterday--\"\n\n\"Oh, I see,\" said the Duke, unable to repress a smile. \"But to-day I am\nnot dressed for a flying-leap.\"\n\nZuleika put a finger to her lips. \"Don't talk so loud. Those women up\nthere will hear you. No one must ever know I knew what was going to\nhappen. What evidence should I have that I tried to prevent it? Only my\nown unsupported word--and the world is always against a woman. So do be\ncareful. I've thought it all out. The whole thing must be SPRUNG on me.\nDon't look so horribly cynical... What was I saying? Oh yes; well, it\ndoesn't really matter. I had it fixed in my mind that you--but no, of\ncourse, in that mantle you couldn't. But why not come up on the roof\nwith me meanwhile, and then afterwards make some excuse and--\" The rest\nof her whisper was lost in another growl of thunder.\n\n\"I would rather make my excuses forthwith,\" said the Duke. \"And, as the\nraces must be almost due now, I advise you to go straight up and secure\na place against the railing.\"\n\n\"It will look very odd, my going all alone into a crowd of people whom I\ndon't know. I'm an unmarried girl. I do think you might--\"\n\n\"Good-bye,\" said the Duke.\n\nAgain Zuleika raised a warning finger.\n\n\"Good-bye, John,\" she whispered. \"See, I am still wearing your studs.\nGood-bye. Don't forget to call my name in a loud voice. You promised.\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"And,\" she added, after a pause, \"remember this. I have loved but twice\nin my life; and none but you have I loved. This, too: if you hadn't\nforced me to kill my love, I would have died with you. And you know it\nis true.\"\n\n\"Yes.\" It was true enough.\n\nCourteously he watched her up the stairs.\n\nAs she reached the roof, she cried down to him from the throng, \"Then\nyou will wait down there to take me home afterwards?\"\n\nHe bowed silently.\n\nThe raft was even more crowded than yesterday, but way was made for him\nby Judasians past and present. He took his place in the centre of the\nfront row.\n\nAt his feet flowed the fateful river. From the various barges the last\npunt-loads had been ferried across to the towing-path, and the last\nof the men who were to follow the boats in their course had vanished\ntowards the starting-point. There remained, however, a fringe of lesser\nenthusiasts. Their figures stood outlined sharply in that strange dark\nclearness which immediately precedes a storm.\n\nThe thunder rumbled around the hills, and now and again there was a\nfaint glare on the horizon.\n\nWould Judas bump Magdalen? Opinion on the raft seemed to be divided. But\nthe sanguine spirits were in a majority.\n\n\"If I were making a book on the event,\" said a middle-aged clergyman,\nwith that air of breezy emancipation which is so distressing to the\nlaity, \"I'd bet two to one we bump.\"\n\n\"You demean your cloth, sir,\" the Duke would have said, \"without\ncheating its disabilities,\" had not his mouth been stopped by a loud and\nprolonged thunder-clap.\n\nIn the hush thereafter, came the puny sound of a gunshot. The boats were\nstarting. Would Judas bump Magdalen? Would Judas be head of the river?\n\nStrange, thought the Duke, that for him, standing as he did on the peak\nof dandyism, on the brink of eternity, this trivial question of boats\ncould have importance. And yet, and yet, for this it was that his heart\nwas beating. A few minutes hence, an end to victors and vanquished\nalike; and yet...\n\nA sudden white vertical streak slid down the sky. Then there was\na consonance to split the drums of the world's ears, followed by\na horrific rattling as of actual artillery--tens of thousands of\ngun-carriages simultaneously at the gallop, colliding, crashing, heeling\nover in the blackness.\n\nThen, and yet more awful, silence; the little earth cowering voiceless\nunder the heavens' menace. And, audible in the hush now, a faint sound;\nthe sound of the runners on the towing-path cheering the crews forward,\nforward.\n\nAnd there was another faint sound that came to the Duke's ears. It he\nunderstood when, a moment later, he saw the surface of the river alive\nwith infinitesimal fountains.\n\nRain!\n\nHis very mantle was aspersed. In another minute he would stand sodden,\ninglorious, a mock. He didn't hesitate.\n\n\"Zuleika!\" he cried in a loud voice. Then he took a deep breath, and,\nburying his face in his mantle, plunged.\n\nFull on the river lay the mantle outspread. Then it, too, went under. A\ngreat roll of water marked the spot. The plumed hat floated.\n\nThere was a confusion of shouts from the raft, of screams from the roof.\nMany youths--all the youths there--cried \"Zuleika!\" and leapt emulously\nheadlong into the water. \"Brave fellows!\" shouted the elder men,\nsupposing rescue-work. The rain pelted, the thunder pealed. Here and\nthere was a glimpse of a young head above water--for an instant only.\n\nShouts and screams now from the infected barges on either side. A score\nof fresh plunges. \"Splendid fellows!\"\n\nMeanwhile, what of the Duke? I am glad to say that he was alive and (but\nfor the cold he had caught last night) well. Indeed, his mind had never\nworked more clearly than in this swift dim underworld. His mantle, the\ncords of it having come untied, had drifted off him, leaving his arms\nfree. With breath well-pent, he steadily swam, scarcely less amused than\nannoyed that the gods had, after all, dictated the exact time at which\nhe should seek death.\n\nI am loth to interrupt my narrative at this rather exciting moment--a\nmoment when the quick, tense style, exemplified in the last paragraph\nbut one, is so very desirable. But in justice to the gods I must pause\nto put in a word of excuse for them. They had imagined that it was\nin mere irony that the Duke had said he could not die till after the\nbumping-races; and not until it seemed that he stood ready to make an\nend of himself had the signal been given by Zeus for the rain to fall.\nOne is taught to refrain from irony, because mankind does tend to take\nit literally. In the hearing of the gods, who hear all, it is conversely\nunsafe to make a simple and direct statement. So what is one to do? The\ndilemma needs a whole volume to itself.\n\nBut to return to the Duke. He had now been under water for a full\nminute, swimming down stream; and he calculated that he had yet another\nfull minute of consciousness. Already the whole of his past life\nhad vividly presented itself to him--myriads of tiny incidents, long\nforgotten, now standing out sharply in their due sequence. He had\nmastered this conspectus in a flash of time, and was already tired of\nit. How smooth and yielding were the weeds against his face! He wondered\nif Mrs. Batch had been in time to cash the cheque. If not, of course his\nexecutors would pay the amount, but there would be delays, long delays,\nMrs. Batch in meshes of red tape. Red tape for her, green weeds for\nhim--he smiled at this poor conceit, classifying it as a fair sample of\nmerman's wit. He swam on through the quiet cool darkness, less quickly\nnow. Not many more strokes now, he told himself; a few, only a few; then\nsleep. How was he come here? Some woman had sent him. Ever so many years\nago, some woman. He forgave her. There was nothing to forgive her. It\nwas the gods who had sent him--too soon, too soon. He let his arms rise\nin the water, and he floated up. There was air in that over-world, and\nsomething he needed to know there before he came down again to sleep.\n\nHe gasped the air into his lungs, and he remembered what it was that he\nneeded to know.\n\nHad he risen in mid-stream, the keel of the Magdalen boat might have\nkilled him. The oars of Magdalen did all but graze his face. The eyes of\nthe Magdalen cox met his. The cords of the Magdalen rudder slipped from\nthe hands that held them; whereupon the Magdalen man who rowed \"bow\"\nmissed his stroke.\n\nAn instant later, just where the line of barges begins, Judas had bumped\nMagdalen.\n\nA crash of thunder deadened the din of the stamping and dancing crowd on\nthe towing-path. The rain was a deluge making land and water as one.\n\nAnd the conquered crew, and the conquering, both now had seen the face\nof the Duke. A white smiling face, anon it was gone. Dorset was gone\ndown to his last sleep.\n\nVictory and defeat alike forgotten, the crews staggered erect and flung\nthemselves into the river, the slender boats capsizing and spinning\nfutile around in a melley of oars.\n\nFrom the towing-path--no more din there now, but great single cries\nof \"Zuleika!\"--leapt figures innumerable through rain to river. The\narrested boats of the other crews drifted zigzag hither and thither. The\ndropped oars rocked and clashed, sank and rebounded, as the men plunged\nacross them into the swirling stream.\n\nAnd over all this confusion and concussion of men and man-made things\ncrashed the vaster discords of the heavens; and the waters of the\nheavens fell ever denser and denser, as though to the aid of waters that\ncould not in themselves envelop so many hundreds of struggling human\nforms.\n\nAll along the soaked towing-path lay strewn the horns, the rattles, the\nmotor-hooters, that the youths had flung aside before they leapt. Here\nand there among these relics stood dazed elder men, staring through the\nstorm. There was one of them--a grey-beard--who stripped off his blazer,\nplunged, grabbed at some live man, grappled him, was dragged under. He\ncame up again further along stream, swam choking to the bank, clung to\nthe grasses. He whimpered as he sought foot-hold in the slime. It was\nill to be down in that abominable sink of death.\n\nAbominable, yes, to them who discerned there death only; but sacramental\nand sweet enough to the men who were dying there for love. Any face that\nrose was smiling.\n\nThe thunder receded; the rain was less vehement: the boats and the oars\nhad drifted against the banks. And always the patient river bore its\nawful burden towards Iffley.\n\nAs on the towing-path, so on the youth-bereft rafts of the barges,\nyonder, stood many stupefied elders, staring at the river, staring back\nfrom the river into one another's faces.\n\nDispeopled now were the roofs of the barges. Under the first drops of\nthe rain most of the women had come huddling down for shelter inside;\npanic had presently driven down the rest. Yet on one roof one woman\nstill was. A strange, drenched figure, she stood bright-eyed in the\ndimness; alone, as it was well she should be in her great hour; draining\nthe lees of such homage as had come to no woman in history recorded.\n\n\n\n\nXX\n\nArtistically, there is a good deal to be said for that old Greek friend\nof ours, the Messenger; and I dare say you blame me for having, as it\nwere, made you an eye-witness of the death of the undergraduates, when\nI might so easily have brought some one in to tell you about it after\nit was all over... Some one? Whom? Are you not begging the question?\nI admit there were, that evening in Oxford, many people who, when they\nwent home from the river, gave vivid reports of what they had seen. But\namong them was none who had seen more than a small portion of the whole\naffair. Certainly, I might have pieced together a dozen of the various\naccounts, and put them all into the mouth of one person. But credibility\nis not enough for Clio's servant. I aim at truth. And so, as I by my\nZeus-given incorporeity was the one person who had a good view of the\nscene at large, you must pardon me for having withheld the veil of\nindirect narration.\n\n\"Too late,\" you will say if I offer you a Messenger now. But it was not\nthus that Mrs. Batch and Katie greeted Clarence when, lamentably soaked\nwith rain, that Messenger appeared on the threshold of the kitchen.\nKatie was laying the table-cloth for seven o'clock supper. Neither she\nnor her mother was clairvoyante. Neither of them knew what had been\nhappening. But, as Clarence had not come home since afternoon-school,\nthey had assumed that he was at the river; and they now assumed from the\nlook of him that something very unusual had been happening there. As to\nwhat this was, they were not quickly enlightened. Our old Greek friend,\nafter a run of twenty miles, would always reel off a round hundred of\ngraphic verses unimpeachable in scansion. Clarence was of degenerate\nmould. He collapsed on to a chair, and sat there gasping; and his\nrecovery was rather delayed than hastened by his mother, who, in her\nsolicitude, patted him vigorously between the shoulders.\n\n\"Let him alone, mother, do,\" cried Katie, wringing her hands.\n\n\"The Duke, he's drowned himself,\" presently gasped the Messenger.\n\nBlank verse, yes, so far as it went; but delivered without the slightest\nregard for rhythm, and composed in stark defiance of those laws which\nshould regulate the breaking of bad news. You, please remember, were\ncarefully prepared by me against the shock of the Duke's death; and yet\nI hear you still mumbling that I didn't let the actual fact be told you\nby a Messenger. Come, do you really think your grievance against me\nis for a moment comparable with that of Mrs. and Miss Batch against\nClarence? Did you feel faint at any moment in the foregoing chapter? No.\nBut Katie, at Clarence's first words, fainted outright. Think a little\nmore about this poor girl senseless on the floor, and a little less\nabout your own paltry discomfort.\n\nMrs. Batch herself did not faint, but she was too much overwhelmed to\nnotice that her daughter had done so.\n\n\"No! Mercy on us! Speak, boy, can't you?\"\n\n\"The river,\" gasped Clarence. \"Threw himself in. On purpose. I was on\nthe towing-path. Saw him do it.\"\n\nMrs. Batch gave a low moan.\n\n\"Katie's fainted,\" added the Messenger, not without a touch of personal\npride.\n\n\"Saw him do it,\" Mrs. Batch repeated dully. \"Katie,\" she said, in the\nsame voice, \"get up this instant.\" But Katie did not hear her.\n\nThe mother was loth to have been outdone in sensibility by the daughter,\nand it was with some temper that she hastened to make the necessary\nministrations.\n\n\"Where am I?\" asked Katie, at length, echoing the words used in this\nvery house, at a similar juncture, on this very day, by another lover of\nthe Duke.\n\n\"Ah, you may well ask that,\" said Mrs. Batch, with more force than\nreason. \"A mother's support indeed! Well! And as for you,\" she cried,\nturning on Clarence, \"sending her off like that with your--\" She\nwas face to face again with the tragic news. Katie, remembering it\nsimultaneously, uttered a loud sob. Mrs. Batch capped this with a much\nlouder one. Clarence stood before the fire, slowly revolving on one\nheel. His clothes steamed briskly.\n\n\"It isn't true,\" said Katie. She rose and came uncertainly towards her\nbrother, half threatening, half imploring.\n\n\"All right,\" said he, strong in his advantage. \"Then I shan't tell\neither of you anything more.\"\n\nMrs. Batch through her tears called Katie a bad girl, and Clarence a bad\nboy.\n\n\"Where did you get THEM?\" asked Clarence, pointing to the ear-rings worn\nby his sister.\n\n\"HE gave me them,\" said Katie. Clarence curbed the brotherly intention\nof telling her she looked \"a sight\" in them.\n\nShe stood staring into vacancy. \"He didn't love HER,\" she murmured.\n\"That was all over. I'll vow he didn't love HER.\"\n\n\"Who d'you mean by her?\" asked Clarence.\n\n\"That Miss Dobson that's been here.\"\n\n\"What's her other name?\"\n\n\"Zuleika,\" Katie enunciated with bitterest abhorrence.\n\n\"Well, then, he jolly well did love her. That's the name he called out\njust before he threw himself in. 'Zuleika!'--like that,\" added the boy,\nwith a most infelicitous attempt to reproduce the Duke's manner.\n\nKatie had shut her eyes, and clenched her hands.\n\n\"He hated her. He told me so,\" she said.\n\n\"I was always a mother to him,\" sobbed Mrs. Batch, rocking to and fro on\na chair in a corner. \"Why didn't he come to me in his trouble?\"\n\n\"He kissed me,\" said Katie, as in a trance. \"No other man shall ever do\nthat.\"\n\n\"He did?\" exclaimed Clarence. \"And you let him?\"\n\n\"You wretched little whipper-snapper!\" flashed Katie.\n\n\"Oh, I am, am I?\" shouted Clarence, squaring up to his sister. \"Say that\nagain, will you?\"\n\nThere is no doubt that Katie would have said it again, had not her\nmother closed the scene with a prolonged wail of censure.\n\n\"You ought to be thinking of ME, you wicked girl,\" said Mrs. Batch.\nKatie went across, and laid a gentle hand on her mother's shoulder.\nThis, however, did but evoke a fresh flood of tears. Mrs. Batch had a\nkeen sense of the deportment owed to tragedy. Katie, by bickering with\nClarence, had thrown away the advantage she had gained by fainting. Mrs.\nBatch was not going to let her retrieve it by shining as a consoler.\nI hasten to add that this resolve was only sub-conscious in the good\nwoman. Her grief was perfectly sincere. And it was not the less so\nbecause with it was mingled a certain joy in the greatness of the\ncalamity. She came of good sound peasant stock. Abiding in her was the\nspirit of those old songs and ballads in which daisies and daffodillies\nand lovers' vows and smiles are so strangely inwoven with tombs and\nghosts, with murders and all manner of grim things. She had not had\neducation enough to spoil her nerve. She was able to take the rough with\nthe smooth. She was able to take all life for her province, and death\ntoo.\n\nThe Duke was dead. This was the stupendous outline she had grasped: now\nlet it be filled in. She had been stricken: now let her be racked. Soon\nafter her daughter had moved away, Mrs. Batch dried her eyes, and bade\nClarence tell just what had happened. She did not flinch. Modern Katie\ndid.\n\nSuch had ever been the Duke's magic in the household that Clarence\nhad at first forgotten to mention that any one else was dead. Of\nthis omission he was glad. It promised him a new lease of importance.\nMeanwhile, he described in greater detail the Duke's plunge. Mrs.\nBatch's mind, while she listened, ran ahead, dog-like, into the\nimmediate future, ranging around: \"the family\" would all be here\nto-morrow, the Duke's own room must be \"put straight\" to-night, \"I was\nof speaking\"...\n\nKatie's mind harked back to the immediate past--to the tone of that\nvoice, to that hand which she had kissed, to the touch of those lips on\nher brow, to the door-step she had made so white for him, day by day...\n\nThe sound of the rain had long ceased. There was the noise of a\ngathering wind.\n\n\"Then in went a lot of others,\" Clarence was saying. \"And they all\nshouted out 'Zuleika!' just like he did. Then a lot more went in.\nFirst I thought it was some sort of fun. Not it!\" And he told how,\nby inquiries further down the river, he had learned the extent of the\ndisaster. \"Hundreds and hundreds of them--ALL of them,\" he summed up.\n\"And all for the love of HER,\" he added, as with a sulky salute to\nRomance.\n\nMrs. Batch had risen from her chair, the better to cope with such\nmagnitude. She stood with wide-spread arms, silent, gaping. She seemed,\nby sheer force of sympathy, to be expanding to the dimensions of a\ncrowd.\n\nIntensive Katie recked little of all these other deaths. \"I only know,\"\nshe said, \"that he hated her.\"\n\n\"Hundreds and hundreds--ALL,\" intoned Mrs. Batch, then gave a sudden\nstart, as having remembered something. Mr. Noaks! He, too! She staggered\nto the door, leaving her actual offspring to their own devices, and went\nheavily up the stairs, her mind scampering again before her.... If he\nwas safe and sound, dear young gentleman, heaven be praised! and she\nwould break the awful news to him, very gradually. If not, there was\nanother \"family\" to be solaced; \"I'm a mother myself, Mrs. Noaks\"...\n\nThe sitting-room door was closed. Twice did Mrs. Batch tap on the panel,\nreceiving no answer. She went in, gazed around in the dimness, sighed\ndeeply, and struck a match. Conspicuous on the table lay a piece of\npaper. She bent to examine it. A piece of lined paper, torn from an\nexercise book, it was neatly inscribed with the words \"What is Life\nwithout Love?\" The final word and the note of interrogation were\nsomewhat blurred, as by a tear. The match had burnt itself out. The\nlandlady lit another, and read the legend a second time, that she might\ntake in the full pathos of it. Then she sat down in the arm-chair. For\nsome minutes she wept there. Then, having no more, tears, she went out\non tip-toe, closing the door very quietly.\n\nAs she descended the last flight of stairs, her daughter had just shut\nthe front-door, and was coming along the hall.\n\n\"Poor Mr. Noaks--he's gone,\" said the mother.\n\n\"Has he?\" said Katie listlessly.\n\n\"Yes he has, you heartless girl. What's that you've got in your hand?\nWhy, if it isn't the black-leading! And what have you been doing with\nthat?\"\n\n\"Let me alone, mother, do,\" said poor Katie. She had done her lowly\ntask. She had expressed her mourning, as best she could, there where she\nhad been wont to express her love.\n\n\n\n\nXXI\n\nAnd Zuleika? She had done a wise thing, and was where it was best that\nshe should be.\n\nHer face lay upturned on the water's surface, and round it were the\nmasses of her dark hair, half floating, half submerged. Her eyes were\nclosed, and her lips were parted. Not Ophelia in the brook could have\nseemed more at peace.\n\n          \"Like a creature native and indued\n     Unto that element,\"\ntranquil Zuleika lay.\n\nGently to and fro her tresses drifted on the water, or under the water\nwent ever ravelling and unravelling. Nothing else of her stirred.\n\nWhat to her now the loves that she had inspired and played on? the lives\nlost for her? Little thought had she now of them. Aloof she lay.\n\nSteadily rising from the water was a thick vapour that turned to dew on\nthe window-pane. The air was heavy with scent of violets. These are the\nflowers of mourning; but their scent here and now signified nothing; for\nEau de Violettes was the bath-essence that Zuleika always had.\n\nThe bath-room was not of the white-gleaming kind to which she was\naccustomed. The walls were papered, not tiled, and the bath itself was\nof japanned tin, framed in mahogany. These things, on the evening of\nher arrival at the Warden's, had rather distressed her. But she was the\nbetter able to bear them because of that well-remembered past when a\nbath-room was in itself a luxury pined for--days when a not-large and\nnot-full can of not-hot water, slammed down at her bedroom door by a\ngoverness-resenting housemaid, was as much as the gods allowed her. And\nthere was, to dulcify for her the bath of this evening, the yet sharper\ncontrast with the plight she had just come home in, sopped, shivering,\nclung to by her clothes. Because this bath was not a mere luxury, but a\nnecessary precaution, a sure means of salvation from chill, she did the\nmore gratefully bask in it, till Melisande came back to her, laden with\nwarmed towels.\n\nA few minutes before eight o'clock she was fully ready to go down to\ndinner, with even more than the usual glow of health, and hungry beyond\nher wont.\n\nYet, as she went down, her heart somewhat misgave her. Indeed, by force\nof the wide experience she had had as a governess, she never did feel\nquite at her ease when she was staying in a private house: the fear of\nnot giving satisfaction haunted her; she was always on her guard; the\nshadow of dismissal absurdly hovered. And to-night she could not tell\nherself, as she usually did, not to be so silly. If her grandfather knew\nalready the motive by which those young men had been actuated, dinner\nwith him might be a rather strained affair. He might tell her, in so\nmany words, that he wished he had not invited her to Oxford.\n\nThrough the open door of the drawing room she saw him, standing\nmajestic, draped in a voluminous black gown. Her instinct was to run\naway; but this she conquered. She went straight in, remembering not to\nsmile.\n\n\"Ah, ah,\" said the Warden, shaking a forefinger at her with old-world\nplayfulness. \"And what have you to say for yourself?\"\n\nRelieved, she was also a trifle shocked. Was it possible that he, a\nresponsible old man, could take things so lightly?\n\n\"Oh, grand-papa,\" she answered, hanging her head, \"what CAN I say? It\nis--it is too, too, dreadful.\"\n\n\"There, there, my dear. I was but jesting. If you have had an agreeable\ntime, you are forgiven for playing truant. Where have you been all day?\"\n\nShe saw that she had misjudged him. \"I have just come from the river,\"\nshe said gravely.\n\n\"Yes? And did the College make its fourth bump to-night?\"\n\n\"I--I don't know, grand-papa. There was so much happening. It--I will\ntell you all about it at dinner.\"\n\n\"Ah, but to-night,\" he said, indicating his gown, \"I cannot be with you.\nThe bump-supper, you know. I have to preside in Hall.\"\n\nZuleika had forgotten there was to be a bump-supper, and, though she\nwas not very sure what a bump-supper was, she felt it would be a mockery\nto-night.\n\n\"But grand-papa--\" she began.\n\n\"My dear, I cannot dissociate myself from the life of the College. And,\nalas,\" he said, looking at the clock, \"I must leave you now. As soon as\nyou have finished dinner, you might, if you would care to, come and peep\ndown at us from the gallery. There is apt to be some measure of\nnoise and racket, but all of it good-humoured and--boys will be\nboys--pardonable. Will you come?\"\n\n\"Perhaps, grand-papa,\" she said awkwardly. Left alone, she hardly knew\nwhether to laugh or cry. In a moment, the butler came to her rescue,\ntelling her that dinner was served.\n\nAs the figure of the Warden emerged from Salt Cellar into the Front\nQuadrangle, a hush fell on the group of gowned Fellows outside the Hall.\nMost of them had only just been told the news, and (such is the force\nof routine in an University) were still sceptical of it. And in face of\nthese doubts the three or four dons who had been down at the river were\nnow half ready to believe that there must, after all, be some mistake,\nand that in this world of illusions they had to-night been specially\ntricked. To rebut this theory, there was the notable absence of\nundergraduates. Or was this an illusion, too? Men of thought, agile on\nthe plane of ideas, devils of fellows among books, they groped feebly\nin this matter of actual life and death. The sight of their Warden\nheartened them. After all, he was the responsible person. He was father\nof the flock that had strayed, and grandfather of the beautiful Miss\nZuleika.\n\nLike her, they remembered not to smile in greeting him.\n\n\"Good evening, gentlemen,\" he said. \"The storm seems to have passed.\"\n\nThere was a murmur of \"Yes, Warden.\"\n\n\"And how did our boat acquit itself?\"\n\nThere was a shuffling pause. Every one looked at the Sub-Warden: it was\nmanifestly for him to break the news, or to report the hallucination. He\nwas nudged forward--a large man, with a large beard at which he plucked\nnervously.\n\n\"Well, really, Warden,\" he said, \"we--we hardly know,\"* and he ended\nwith what can only be described as a giggle. He fell low in the esteem\nof his fellows.\n\n\n   *Those of my readers who are interested in athletic sports will\n    remember the long controversy that raged as to whether Judas had\n    actually bumped Magdalen; and they will not need to be minded that\n    it was mainly through the evidence of Mr. E. T. A. Cook, who had\n    been on the towing-path at the time, that the O. U. B. C. decided\n    the point in Judas' favour, and fixed the order of the boats for\n    the following year accordingly.\n\n\nThinking of that past Sub-Warden whose fame was linked with the\nsun-dial, the Warden eyed this one keenly.\n\n\"Well, gentlemen,\" he presently said, \"our young men seem to be already\nat table. Shall we follow their example?\" And he led the way up the\nsteps.\n\nAlready at table? The dons' dubiety toyed with this hypothesis. But the\naspect of the Hall's interior was hard to explain away. Here were the\nthree long tables, stretching white towards the dais, and laden with the\nusual crockery and cutlery, and with pots of flowers in honour of the\noccasion. And here, ranged along either wall, was the usual array of\nscouts, motionless, with napkins across their arms. But that was all.\n\nIt became clear to the Warden that some organised prank or protest was\nafoot. Dignity required that he should take no heed whatsoever. Looking\nneither to the right nor to the left, stately he approached the dais,\nhis Fellows to heel.\n\nIn Judas, as in other Colleges, grace before meat is read by the Senior\nScholar. The Judas grace (composed, they say, by Christopher Whitrid\nhimself) is noted for its length and for the excellence of its Latinity.\nWho was to read it to-night? The Warden, having searched his mind vainly\nfor a precedent, was driven to create one.\n\n\"The Junior Fellow,\" he said, \"will read grace.\"\n\nBlushing to the roots of his hair, and with crablike gait, Mr. Pedby,\nthe Junior Fellow, went and unhooked from the wall that little shield\nof wood on which the words of the grace are carven. Mr. Pedby was--Mr.\nPedby is--a mathematician. His treatise on the Higher Theory of Short\nDivision by Decimals had already won for him an European reputation.\nJudas was--Judas is--proud of Pedby. Nor is it denied that in\nundertaking the duty thrust on him he quickly controlled his nerves and\nread the Latin out in ringing accents. Better for him had he not done\nso. The false quantities he made were so excruciating and so many that,\nwhile the very scouts exchanged glances, the dons at the high table lost\nall command of their features, and made horrible noises in the effort to\ncontain themselves. The very Warden dared not look from his plate.\n\nIn every breast around the high table, behind every shirt-front or\nblack silk waistcoat, glowed the recognition of a new birth. Suddenly,\nunheralded, a thing of highest destiny had fallen into their academic\nmidst. The stock of Common Room talk had to-night been re-inforced and\nenriched for all time. Summers and winters would come and go, old faces\nwould vanish, giving place to new, but the story of Pedby's grace would\nbe told always. Here was a tradition that generations of dons yet unborn\nwould cherish and chuckle over. Something akin to awe mingled itself\nwith the subsiding merriment. And the dons, having finished their soup,\nsipped in silence the dry brown sherry.\n\nThose who sat opposite to the Warden, with their backs to the void,\nwere oblivious of the matter that had so recently teased them. They\nwere conscious only of an agreeable hush, in which they peered down\nthe vistas of the future, watching the tradition of Pedby's grace as it\nrolled brighter and ever brighter down to eternity.\n\nThe pop of a champagne cork startled them to remembrance that this was a\nbump-supper, and a bump-supper of a peculiar kind. The turbot that\ncame after the soup, the champagne that succeeded the sherry, helped to\nquicken in these men of thought the power to grapple with a reality. The\naforesaid three or four who had been down at the river recovered their\nlost belief in the evidence of their eyes and ears. In the rest was a\nspirit of receptivity which, as the meal went on, mounted to conviction.\nThe Sub-Warden made a second and more determined attempt to enlighten\nthe Warden; but the Warden's eye met his with a suspicion so cruelly\npointed that he again floundered and gave in.\n\nAll adown those empty other tables gleamed the undisturbed cutlery, and\nthe flowers in the pots innocently bloomed. And all adown either wall,\nunneeded but undisbanded, the scouts remained. Some of the elder ones\nstood with closed eyes and heads sunk forward, now and again jerking\nthemselves erect, and blinking around, wondering, remembering.\n\nAnd for a while this scene was looked down on by a not disinterested\nstranger. For a while, her chin propped on her hands, Zuleika leaned\nover the rail of the gallery, just as she had lately leaned over the\nbarge's rail, staring down and along. But there was no spark of triumph\nnow in her eyes; only a deep melancholy; and in her mouth a taste as of\ndust and ashes. She thought of last night, and of all the buoyant life\nthat this Hall had held. Of the Duke she thought, and of the whole vivid\nand eager throng of his fellows in love. Her will, their will, had been\ndone. But, there rose to her lips the old, old question that withers\nvictory--\"To what end?\" Her eyes ranged along the tables, and an\nappalling sense of loneliness swept over her. She turned away, wrapping\nthe folds of her cloak closer across her breast. Not in this College\nonly, but through and through Oxford, there was no heart that beat for\nher--no, not one, she told herself, with that instinct for self-torture\nwhich comes to souls in torment. She was utterly alone to-night in the\nmidst of a vast indifference. She! She! Was it possible? Were the gods\nso merciless? Ah no, surely...\n\nDown at the high table the feast drew to its close, and very different\nwas the mood of the feasters from that of the young woman whose glance\nhad for a moment rested on their unromantic heads. Generations of\nundergraduates had said that Oxford would be all very well but for the\ndons. Do you suppose that the dons had had no answering sentiment? Youth\nis a very good thing to possess, no doubt; but it is a tiresome setting\nfor maturity. Youth all around prancing, vociferating, mocking; callow\nand alien youth, having to be looked after and studied and taught,\nas though nothing but it mattered, term after term--and now, all of a\nsudden, in mid-term, peace, ataraxy, a profound and leisured stillness.\nNo lectures to deliver to-morrow; no \"essays\" to hear and criticise;\ntime for the unvexed pursuit of pure learning...\n\nAs the Fellows passed out on their way to Common Room, there to tackle\nwith a fresh appetite Pedby's grace, they paused, as was their wont, on\nthe steps of the Hall, looking up at the sky, envisaging the weather.\nThe wind had dropped. There was even a glimpse of the moon riding behind\nthe clouds. And now, a solemn and plangent token of Oxford's perpetuity,\nthe first stroke of Great Tom sounded.\n\n\n\n\nXXII\n\nStroke by stroke, the great familiar monody of that incomparable curfew\nrose and fell in the stillness.\n\nNothing of Oxford lingers more surely than it in the memory of Oxford\nmen; and to one revisiting these groves nothing is more eloquent of that\nscrupulous historic economy whereby his own particular past is utilised\nas the general present and future. \"All's as it was, all's as it will\nbe,\" says Great Tom; and that is what he stubbornly said on the evening\nI here record.\n\nStroke by measured and leisured stroke, the old euphonious clangour\npervaded Oxford, spreading out over the meadows, along the river,\naudible in Iffley. But to the dim groups gathering and dispersing on\neither bank, and to the silent workers in the boats, the bell's message\ncame softened, equivocal; came as a requiem for these dead.\n\nOver the closed gates of Iffley lock, the water gushed down, eager for\nthe sacrament of the sea. Among the supine in the field hard by, there\nwas one whose breast bore a faint-gleaming star. And bending over him,\nlooking down at him with much love and pity in her eyes, was the shade\nof Nellie O'Mora, that \"fairest witch,\" to whose memory he had to-day\natoned.\n\nAnd yonder, \"sitting upon the river-bank o'ergrown,\" with questioning\neyes, was another shade, more habituated to these haunts--the shade\nknown so well to bathers \"in the abandoned lasher,\" and to dancers\n\"around the Fyfield elm in May.\" At the bell's final stroke, the Scholar\nGipsy rose, letting fall on the water his gathered wild-flowers, and\npassed towards Cumnor.\n\nAnd now, duly, throughout Oxford, the gates of the Colleges were closed,\nand closed were the doors of the lodging-houses. Every night, for many\nyears, at this hour precisely, Mrs. Batch had come out from her kitchen,\nto turn the key in the front-door. The function had long ago become\nautomatic. To-night, however, it was the cue for further tears. These\ndid not cease at her return to the kitchen, where she had gathered\nabout her some sympathetic neighbours--women of her own age and\nkind, capacious of tragedy; women who might be relied on; founts of\nejaculation, wells of surmise, downpours of remembered premonitions.\n\nWith his elbows on the kitchen table, and his knuckles to his brow, sat\nClarence, intent on belated \"prep.\" Even an eye-witness of disaster may\npall if he repeat his story too often. Clarence had noted in the last\nrecital that he was losing his hold on his audience. So now he sat\ncommitting to memory the names of the cantons of Switzerland, and waving\naside with a harsh gesture such questions as were still put to him by\nthe women.\n\nKatie had sought refuge in the need for \"putting the gentlemen's rooms\nstraight,\" against the arrival of the two families to-morrow. Duster\nin hand, and by the light of a single candle that barely survived the\ndraught from the open window, she moved to and fro about the Duke's\nroom, a wan and listless figure, casting queerest shadows on the\nceiling. There were other candles that she might have lit, but this\nambiguous gloom suited her sullen humour. Yes, I am sorry to say, Katie\nwas sullen. She had not ceased to mourn the Duke; but it was even more\nanger than grief that she felt at his dying. She was as sure as ever\nthat he had not loved Miss Dobson; but this only made it the more\noutrageous that he had died because of her. What was there in this woman\nthat men should so demean themselves for her? Katie, as you know, had at\nfirst been unaffected by the death of the undergraduates at large. But,\nbecause they too had died for Zuleika, she was bitterly incensed against\nthem now. What could they have admired in such a woman? She didn't even\nlook like a lady. Katie caught the dim reflection of herself in the\nmirror. She took the candle from the table, and examined the reflection\nclosely. She was sure she was just as pretty as Miss Dobson. It was only\nthe clothes that made the difference--the clothes and the behaviour.\nKatie threw back her head, and smiled brilliantly, hand on hip. She\nnodded reassuringly at herself; and the black pearl and the pink danced\na duet. She put the candle down, and undid her hair, roughly parting\nit on one side, and letting it sweep down over the further eyebrow. She\nfixed it in that fashion, and posed accordingly. Now! But gradually her\nsmile relaxed, and a mist came to her eyes. For she had to admit that\neven so, after all, she hadn't just that something which somehow Miss\nDobson had. She put away from her the hasty dream she had had of a whole\nfuture generation of undergraduates drowning themselves, every one, in\nhonour of her. She went wearily on with her work.\n\nPresently, after a last look round, she went up the creaking stairs, to\ndo Mr. Noaks' room.\n\nShe found on the table that screed which her mother had recited so often\nthis evening. She put it in the waste-paper basket.\n\nAlso on the table were a lexicon, a Thucydides, and some note-books.\nThese she took and shelved without a tear for the closed labours they\nbore witness to.\n\nThe next disorder that met her eye was one that gave her pause--seemed,\nindeed, to transfix her.\n\nMr. Noaks had never, since he came to lodge here, possessed more than\none pair of boots. This fact had been for her a lasting source of\nannoyance; for it meant that she had to polish Mr. Noaks' boots always\nin the early morning, when there were so many other things to be done,\ninstead of choosing her own time. Her annoyance had been all the keener\nbecause Mr. Noaks' boots more than made up in size for what they lacked\nin number. Either of them singly took more time and polish than any\nother pair imaginable. She would have recognised them, at a glance,\nanywhere. Even so now, it was at a glance that she recognised the toes\nof them protruding from beneath the window-curtain. She dismissed the\ntheory that Mr. Noaks might have gone utterly unshod to the river. She\nscouted the hypothesis that his ghost could be shod thus. By process\nof elimination she arrived at the truth. \"Mr. Noaks,\" she said quietly,\n\"come out of there.\"\n\nThere was a slight quiver of the curtain; no more. Katie repeated her\nwords. There was a pause, then a convulsion of the curtain. Noaks stood\nforth.\n\nAlways, in polishing his boots, Katie had found herself thinking of him\nas a man of prodigious stature, well though she knew him to be quite\ntiny. Even so now, at recognition of his boots, she had fixed her eyes\nto meet his, when he should emerge, a full yard too high. With a sharp\ndrop she focussed him.\n\n\"By what right,\" he asked, \"do you come prying about my room?\"\n\nThis was a stroke so unexpected that it left Katie mute. It equally\nsurprised Noaks, who had been about to throw himself on his knees and\nimplore this girl not to betray him. He was quick, though, to clinch his\nadvantage.\n\n\"This,\" he said, \"is the first time I have caught you. Let it be the\nlast.\"\n\nWas this the little man she had so long despised, and so superciliously\nserved? His very smallness gave him an air of concentrated force. She\nremembered having read that all the greatest men in history had been of\nless than the middle height. And--oh, her heart leapt--here was the\none man who had scorned to die for Miss Dobson. He alone had held out\nagainst the folly of his fellows. Sole and splendid survivor he stood,\nrock-footed, before her. And impulsively she abased herself, kneeling at\nhis feet as at the great double altar of some dark new faith.\n\n\"You are great, sir, you are wonderful,\" she said, gazing up to him,\nrapt. It was the first time she had ever called him \"sir.\"\n\nIt is easier, as Michelet suggested, for a woman to change her opinion\nof a man than for him to change his opinion of himself. Noaks, despite\nthe presence of mind he had shown a few moments ago, still saw himself\nas he had seen himself during the past hours: that is, as an arrant\nlittle coward--one who by his fear to die had put himself outside the\npale of decent manhood. He had meant to escape from the house at dead of\nnight and, under an assumed name, work his passage out to Australia--a\nland which had always made strong appeal to his imagination. No one, he\nhad reflected, would suppose because his body was not retrieved from\nthe water that he had not perished with the rest. And he had looked to\nAustralia to make a man of him yet: in Encounter Bay, perhaps, or in the\nGulf of Carpentaria, he might yet end nobly.\n\nThus Katie's behaviour was as much an embarrassment as a relief; and he\nasked her in what way he was great and wonderful.\n\n\"Modest, like all heroes!\" she cried, and, still kneeling, proceeded to\nsing his praises with a so infectious fervour that Noaks did begin to\nfeel he had done a fine thing in not dying. After all, was it not moral\ncowardice as much as love that had tempted him to die? He had wrestled\nwith it, thrown it. \"Yes,\" said he, when her rhapsody was over, \"perhaps\nI am modest.\"\n\n\"And that is why you hid yourself just now?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" he gladly said. \"I hid myself for the same reason,\" he added,\n\"when I heard your mother's footstep.\"\n\n\"But,\" she faltered, with a sudden doubt, \"that bit of writing which\nMother found on the table--\"\n\n\"That? Oh, that was only a general reflection, copied out of a book.\"\n\n\"Oh, won't poor Mother be glad when she knows!\"\n\n\"I don't want her to know,\" said Noaks, with a return of nervousness.\n\"You mustn't tell any one. I--the fact is--\"\n\n\"Ah, that is so like you!\" the girl said tenderly. \"I suppose it was\nyour modesty that all this while blinded me. Please, sir, I have a\nconfession to make to you. Never till to-night have I loved you.\"\n\nExquisite was the shock of these words to one who, not without reason,\nhad always assumed that no woman would ever love him. Before he knew\nwhat he was doing, he had bent down and kissed the sweet upturned face.\nIt was the first kiss he had ever given outside his family circle. It\nwas an artless and a resounding kiss.\n\nHe started back, dazed. What manner of man, he wondered, was he? A\ncoward, piling profligacy on poltroonery? Or a hero, claiming exemption\nfrom moral law? What was done could not be undone; but it could be\nrighted. He drew off from the little finger of his left hand that iron\nring which, after a twinge of rheumatism, he had to-day resumed.\n\n\"Wear it,\" he said.\n\n\"You mean--?\" She leapt to her feet.\n\n\"That we are engaged. I hope you don't think we have any choice?\"\n\nShe clapped her hands, like the child she was, and adjusted the ring.\n\n\"It is very pretty,\" she said.\n\n\"It is very simple,\" he answered lightly. \"But,\" he added, with a change\nof tone, \"it is very durable. And that is the important thing. For I\nshall not be in a position to marry before I am forty.\"\n\nA shadow of disappointment hovered over Katie's clear young brow, but\nwas instantly chased away by the thought that to be engaged was almost\nas splendid as to be married.\n\n\"Recently,\" said her lover, \"I meditated leaving Oxford for Australia.\nBut now that you have come into my life, I am compelled to drop that\nnotion, and to carve out the career I had first set for myself. A year\nhence, if I get a Second in Greats--and I SHALL\" he said, with a\nfierce look that entranced her--\"I shall have a very good chance of an\nassistant-mastership in a good private school. In eighteen years, if I\nam careful--and, with you waiting for me, I SHALL be careful--my savings\nwill enable me to start a small school of my own, and to take a wife.\nEven then it would be more prudent to wait another five years, no doubt.\nBut there was always a streak of madness in the Noakses. I say 'Prudence\nto the winds!'\"\n\n\"Ah, don't say that!\" exclaimed Katie, laying a hand on his sleeve.\n\n\"You are right. Never hesitate to curb me. And,\" he said, touching the\nring, \"an idea has just occurred to me. When the time comes, let this\nbe the wedding-ring. Gold is gaudy--not at all the thing for a\nschoolmaster's bride. It is a pity,\" he muttered, examining her through\nhis spectacles, \"that your hair is so golden. A schoolmaster's bride\nshould--Good heavens! Those ear-rings! Where did you get THEM?\"\n\n\"They were given to me to-day,\" Katie faltered. \"The Duke gave me them.\"\n\n\"Indeed?\"\n\n\"Please, sir, he gave me them as a memento.\"\n\n\"And that memento shall immediately be handed over to his executors.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"I should think so!\" was on the tip of Noaks' tongue, but suddenly he\nceased to see the pearls as trinkets finite and inapposite--saw them,\nin a flash, as things transmutable by sale hereafter into desks, forms,\nblack-boards, maps, lockers, cubicles, gravel soil, diet unlimited, and\nspecial attention to backward pupils. Simultaneously, he saw how mean\nhad been his motive for repudiating the gift. What more despicable than\njealousy of a man deceased? What sillier than to cast pearls before\nexecutors? Sped by nothing but the pulse of his hot youth, he had wooed\nand won this girl. Why flinch from her unsought dowry?\n\nHe told her his vision. Her eyes opened wide to it. \"And oh,\" she cried,\n\"then we can be married as soon as you take your degree!\"\n\nHe bade her not be so foolish. Who ever heard of a head-master aged\nthree-and-twenty? What parent or guardian would trust a stripling? The\nengagement must run its course. \"And,\" he said, fidgeting, \"do you know\nthat I have hardly done any reading to-day?\"\n\n\"You want to read NOW--TO-NIGHT?\"\n\n\"I must put in a good two hours. Where are the books that were on my\ntable?\"\n\nReverently--he was indeed a king of men--she took the books down from\nthe shelf, and placed them where she had found them. And she knew not\nwhich thrilled her the more--the kiss he gave her at parting, or the\ntone in which he told her that the one thing he could not and would not\nstand was having his books disturbed.\n\nStill less than before attuned to the lugubrious session downstairs, she\nwent straight up to her attic, and did a little dance there in the\ndark. She threw open the lattice of the dormer-window, and leaned out,\nsmiling, throbbing.\n\nThe Emperors, gazing up, saw her happy, and wondered; saw Noaks' ring on\nher finger, and would fain have shaken their grey heads.\n\nPresently she was aware of a protrusion from the window beneath hers.\nThe head of her beloved! Fondly she watched it, wished she could reach\ndown to stroke it. She loved him for having, after all, left his books.\nIt was sweet to be his excuse. Should she call softly to him? No, it\nmight shame him to be caught truant. He had already chidden her for\nprying. So she did but gaze down on his head silently, wondering whether\nin eighteen years it would be bald, wondering whether her own hair would\nstill have the fault of being golden. Most of all, she wondered whether\nhe loved her half so much as she loved him.\n\nThis happened to be precisely what he himself was wondering. Not that\nhe wished himself free. He was one of those in whom the will does not,\nexcept under very great pressure, oppose the conscience. What pressure\nhere? Miss Batch was a superior girl; she would grace any station in\nlife. He had always been rather in awe of her. It was a fine thing to be\nsuddenly loved by her, to be in a position to over-rule her every whim.\nPlighting his troth, he had feared she would be an encumbrance, only to\nfind she was a lever. But--was he deeply in love with her? How was it\nthat he could not at this moment recall her features, or the tone of her\nvoice, while of deplorable Miss Dobson, every lineament, every accent,\nso vividly haunted him? Try as he would to beat off these memories, he\nfailed, and--some very great pressure here!--was glad he failed; glad\nthough he found himself relapsing to the self-contempt from which Miss\nBatch had raised him. He scorned himself for being alive. And again, he\nscorned himself for his infidelity. Yet he was glad he could not forget\nthat face, that voice--that queen. She had smiled at him when she\nborrowed the ring. She had said \"Thank you.\" Oh, and now, at this very\nmoment, sleeping or waking, actually she was somewhere--she! herself!\nThis was an incredible, an indubitable, an all-magical fact for the\nlittle fellow.\n\nFrom the street below came a faint cry that was as the cry of his own\nheart, uttered by her own lips. Quaking, he peered down, and dimly saw,\nover the way, a cloaked woman.\n\nShe--yes, it was she herself--came gliding to the middle of the road,\ngazing up at him.\n\n\"At last!\" he heard her say. His instinct was to hide himself from the\nqueen he had not died for. Yet he could not move.\n\n\"Or,\" she quavered, \"are you a phantom sent to mock me? Speak!\"\n\n\"Good evening,\" he said huskily.\n\n\"I knew,\" she murmured, \"I knew the gods were not so cruel. Oh man of my\nneed,\" she cried, stretching out her arms to him, \"oh heaven-sent, I see\nyou only as a dark outline against the light of your room. But I know\nyou. Your name is Noaks, isn't it? Dobson is mine. I am your Warden's\ngrand-daughter. I am faint and foot-sore. I have ranged this desert city\nin search of--of YOU. Let me hear from your own lips that you love me.\nTell me in your own words--\" She broke off with a little scream, and did\nnot stand with forefinger pointed at him, gazing, gasping.\n\n\"Listen, Miss Dobson,\" he stammered, writhing under what he took to be\nthe lash of her irony. \"Give me time to explain. You see me here--\"\n\n\"Hush,\" she cried, \"man of my greater, my deeper and nobler need!\nOh hush, ideal which not consciously I was out for to-night--ideal\nvouchsafed to me by a crowning mercy! I sought a lover, I find a master.\nI sought but a live youth, was blind to what his survival would betoken.\nOh master, you think me light and wicked. You stare coldly down at me\nthrough your spectacles, whose glint I faintly discern now that the moon\npeeps forth. You would be readier to forgive me the havoc I have wrought\nif you could for the life of you understand what charm your friends\nfound in me. You marvel, as at the skull of Helen of Troy. No, you don't\nthink me hideous: you simply think me plain. There was a time when I\nthought YOU plain--you whose face, now that the moon shines full on it,\nis seen to be of a beauty that is flawless without being insipid. Oh\nthat I were a glove upon that hand, that I might touch that cheek! You\nshudder at the notion of such contact. My voice grates on you. You try\nto silence me with frantic though exquisite gestures, and with noises\ninarticulate but divine. I bow to your will, master. Chasten me with\nyour tongue.\"\n\n\"I am not what you think me,\" gibbered Noaks. \"I was not afraid to die\nfor you. I love you. I was on my way to the river this afternoon, but\nI--I tripped and sprained my ankle, and--and jarred my spine. They\ncarried me back here. I am still very weak. I can't put my foot to the\nground. As soon as I can--\"\n\nJust then Zuleika heard a little sharp sound which, for the fraction of\nan instant, before she knew it to be a clink of metal on the pavement,\nshe thought was the breaking of the heart within her. Looking quickly\ndown, she heard a shrill girlish laugh aloft. Looking quickly up,\nshe descried at the unlit window above her lover's a face which she\nremembered as that of the land-lady's daughter.\n\n\"Find it, Miss Dobson,\" laughed the girl. \"Crawl for it. It can't have\nrolled far, and it's the only engagement-ring you'll get from HIM,\" she\nsaid, pointing to the livid face twisted painfully up at her from the\nlower window. \"Grovel for it, Miss Dobson. Ask him to step down and help\nyou. Oh, he can! That was all lies about his spine and ankle. Afraid,\nthat's what he was--I see it all now--afraid of the water. I wish you'd\nfound him as I did--skulking behind the curtain. Oh, you're welcome to\nhim.\"\n\n\"Don't listen,\" Noaks cried down. \"Don't listen to that person. I admit\nI have trifled with her affections. This is her revenge--these wicked\nuntruths--these--these--\"\n\nZuleika silenced him with a gesture. \"Your tone to me,\" she said up to\nKatie, \"is not without offence; but the stamp of truth is on what you\ntell me. We have both been deceived in this man, and are, in some sort,\nsisters.\"\n\n\"Sisters?\" cried Katie. \"Your sisters are the snake and the spider,\nthough neither of them wishes it known. I loathe you. And the Duke\nloathed you, too.\"\n\n\"What's that?\" gasped Zuleika.\n\n\"Didn't he tell you? He told me. And I warrant he told you, too.\"\n\n\"He died for love of me: d'you hear?\"\n\n\"Ah, you'd like people to think so, wouldn't you? Does a man who loves a\nwoman give away the keepsake she gave him? Look!\" Katie leaned forward,\npointing to her ear-rings. \"He loved ME,\" she cried. \"He put them in with\nhis own hands--told me to wear them always. And he kissed me--kissed me\ngood-bye in the street, where every one could see. He kissed me,\" she\nsobbed. \"No other man shall ever do that.\"\n\n\"Ah, that he did!\" said a voice level with Zuleika. It was the voice of\nMrs. Batch, who a few moments ago had opened the door for her departing\nguests.\n\n\"Ah, that he did!\" echoed the guests.\n\n\"Never mind them, Miss Dobson,\" cried Noaks, and at the sound of his\nvoice Mrs. Batch rushed into the middle of the road, to gaze up. \"_I_\nlove you. Think what you will of me. I--\"\n\n\"You!\" flashed Zuleika. \"As for you, little Sir Lily Liver, leaning\nout there, and, I frankly tell you, looking like nothing so much as a\ngargoyle hewn by a drunken stone-mason for the adornment of a Methodist\nChapel in one of the vilest suburbs of Leeds or Wigan, I do but\nfelicitate the river-god and his nymphs that their water was saved\nto-day by your cowardice from the contamination of your plunge.\"\n\n\"Shame on you, Mr. Noaks,\" said Mrs. Batch, \"making believe you were\ndead--\"\n\n\"Shame!\" screamed Clarence, who had darted out into the fray.\n\n\"I found him hiding behind the curtain,\" chimed in Katie.\n\n\"And I a mother to him!\" said Mrs. Batch, shaking her fist. \"'What is\nlife without love?' indeed! Oh, the cowardly, underhand--\"\n\n\"Wretch,\" prompted her cronies.\n\n\"Let's kick him out of the house!\" suggested Clarence, dancing for joy.\n\nZuleika, smiling brilliantly down at the boy, said \"Just you run up and\nfight him!\"\n\n\"Right you are,\" he answered, with a look of knightly devotion, and\ndarted back into the house.\n\n\"No escape!\" she cried up to Noaks. \"You've got to fight him now. He and\nyou are just about evenly matched, I fancy.\"\n\nBut, grimly enough, Zuleika's estimate was never put to the test. Is\nit harder for a coward to fight with his fists than to kill himself? Or\nagain, is it easier for him to die than to endure a prolonged cross-fire\nof women's wrath and scorn? This I know: that in the life of even the\nleast and meanest of us there is somewhere one fine moment--one high\nchance not missed. I like to think it was by operation of this law that\nNoaks had now clambered out upon the window-sill, silencing, sickening,\nscattering like chaff the women beneath him.\n\nHe was already not there when Clarence bounded into the room. \"Come on!\"\nyelled the boy, first thrusting his head behind the door, then diving\nbeneath the table, then plucking aside either window-curtain, vowing\nvengeance.\n\nVengeance was not his. Down on the road without, not yet looked at but\nby the steadfast eyes of the Emperors, the last of the undergraduates\nlay dead; and fleet-footed Zuleika, with her fingers still pressed to\nher ears, had taken full toll now.\n\n\n\n\nXXIII\n\nTwisting and turning in her flight, with wild eyes that fearfully\nretained the image of that small man gathering himself to spring,\nZuleika found herself suddenly where she could no further go.\n\nShe was in that grim ravine by which you approach New College. At sight\nof the great shut gate before her, she halted, and swerved to the wall.\nShe set her brow and the palms of her hands against the cold stones. She\nthrew back her head, and beat the stones with her fists.\n\nIt was not only what she had seen, it was what she had barely saved\nherself from seeing, and what she had not quite saved herself from\nhearing, that she strove so piteously to forget. She was sorrier for\nherself, angrier, than she had been last night when the Duke laid hands\non her. Why should every day have a horrible ending? Last night she\nhad avenged herself. To-night's outrage was all the more foul and mean\nbecause of its certain immunity. And the fact that she had in some\nmeasure brought it on herself did but whip her rage. What a fool she\nhad been to taunt the man! Yet no, how could she have foreseen that he\nwould--do THAT? How could she have guessed that he, who had not dared\nseemly death for her in the gentle river, would dare--THAT?\n\nShe shuddered the more as she now remembered that this very day, in that\nvery house, she had invited for her very self a similar fate. What if\nthe Duke had taken her word? Strange! she wouldn't have flinched then.\nShe had felt no horror at the notion of such a death. And thus she now\nsaw Noaks' conduct in a new light--saw that he had but wished to prove\nhis love, not at all to affront her. This understanding quickly steadied\nher nerves. She did not need now to forget what she had seen; and, not\nneeding to forget it--thus are our brains fashioned--she was able to\nforget it.\n\nBut by removal of one load her soul was but bared for a more grievous\nother. Her memory harked back to what had preceded the crisis. She\nrecalled those moments of doomed rapture in which her heart had soared\nup to the apocalyptic window--recalled how, all the while she was\nspeaking to the man there, she had been chafed by the inadequacy of\nlanguage. Oh, how much more she had meant than she could express! Oh,\nthe ecstasy of that self-surrender! And the brevity of it! the sudden\nodious awakening! Thrice in this Oxford she had been duped. Thrice all\nthat was fine and sweet in her had leapt forth, only to be scourged back\ninto hiding. Poor heart inhibited! She gazed about her. The stone alley\nshe had come into, the terrible shut gate, were for her a visible symbol\nof the destiny she had to put up with. Wringing her hands, she hastened\nalong the way she had come. She vowed she would never again set foot in\nOxford. She wished herself out of the hateful little city to-night. She\neven wished herself dead.\n\nShe deserved to suffer, you say? Maybe. I merely state that she did\nsuffer.\n\nEmerging into Catherine Street, she knew whereabouts she was, and made\nstraight for Judas, turning away her eyes as she skirted the Broad, that\nplace of mocked hopes and shattered ideals.\n\nComing into Judas Street, she remembered the scene of yesterday--the\nhappy man with her, the noise of the vast happy crowd. She suffered in\na worse form what she had suffered in the gallery of the Hall. For\nnow--did I not say she was not without imagination?--her self-pity was\nsharpened by remorse for the hundreds of homes robbed. She realised the\ntruth of what the poor Duke had once said to her: she was a danger in\nthe world... Aye, and all the more dire now. What if the youth of all\nEurope were moved by Oxford's example? That was a horribly possible\nthing. It must be reckoned with. It must be averted. She must not show\nherself to men. She must find some hiding-place, and there abide. Were\nthis a hardship? she asked herself. Was she not sickened for ever of\nmen's homage? And was it not clear now that the absorbing need in her\nsoul, the need to love, would never--except for a brief while, now and\nthen, and by an unfortunate misunderstanding--be fulfilled?\n\nSo long ago that you may not remember, I compared her favourably with\nthe shepherdess Marcella, and pleaded her capacity for passion as an\nexcuse for her remaining at large. I hope you will now, despite your\nrather evident animus against her, set this to her credit: that she did,\nso soon as she realised the hopelessness of her case, make just that\ndecision which I blamed Marcella for not making at the outset. It was as\nshe stood on the Warden's door-step that she decided to take the veil.\n\nWith something of a conventual hush in her voice, she said to the\nbutler, \"Please tell my maid that we are leaving by a very early train\nto-morrow, and that she must pack my things to-night.\"\n\n\"Very well, Miss,\" said the butler. \"The Warden,\" he added, \"is in the\nstudy, Miss, and was asking for you.\"\n\nShe could face her grandfather without a tremour--now. She would hear\nmeekly whatever reproaches he might have for her, but their sting was\nalready drawn by the surprise she had in store for him.\n\nIt was he who seemed a trifle nervous. In his\n\n\"Well, did you come and peep down from the gallery?\" there was a\ndistinct tremour.\n\nThrowing aside her cloak, she went quickly to him, and laid a hand on\nthe lapel of his coat. \"Poor grand-papa!\" she said.\n\n\"Nonsense, my dear child,\" he replied, disengaging himself. \"I didn't\ngive it a thought. If the young men chose to be so silly as to stay\naway, I--I--\"\n\n\"Grand-papa, haven't you been told YET?\"\n\n\"Told? I am a Gallio for such follies. I didn't inquire.\"\n\n\"But (forgive me, grand-papa, if I seem to you, for the moment, pert)\nyou are Warden here. It is your duty, even your privilege, to GUARD.\nIs it not? Well, I grant you the adage that it is useless to bolt the\nstable door when the horse has been stolen. But what shall be said of\nthe ostler who doesn't know--won't even 'inquire' whether--the horse HAS\nbeen stolen, grand-papa?\"\n\n\"You speak in riddles, Zuleika.\"\n\n\"I wish with all my heart I need not tell you the answers. I think I\nhave a very real grievance against your staff--or whatever it is you\ncall your subordinates here. I go so far as to dub them dodderers. And\nI shall the better justify that term by not shirking the duty they have\nleft undone. The reason why there were no undergraduates in your Hall\nto-night is that they were all dead.\"\n\n\"Dead?\" he gasped. \"Dead? It is disgraceful that I was not told. What\ndid they die of?\"\n\n\"Of me.\"\n\n\"Of you?\"\n\n\"Yes. I am an epidemic, grand-papa, a scourge, such as the world has not\nknown. Those young men drowned themselves for love of me.\"\n\nHe came towards her. \"Do you realise, girl, what this means to me? I am\nan old man. For more than half a century I have known this College. To\nit, when my wife died, I gave all that there was of heart left in me.\nFor thirty years I have been Warden; and in that charge has been all my\npride. I have had no thought but for this great College, its honour and\nprosperity. More than once lately have I asked myself whether my eyes\nwere growing dim, my hand less steady. 'No' was my answer, and again\n'No.' And thus it is that I have lingered on to let Judas be struck down\nfrom its high eminence, shamed in the eyes of England--a College for\never tainted, and of evil omen.\" He raised his head. \"The disgrace to\nmyself is nothing. I care not how parents shall rage against me, and the\nHeads of other Colleges make merry over my decrepitude. It is because\nyou have wrought the downfall of Judas that I am about to lay my undying\ncurse on you.\"\n\n\"You mustn't do that!\" she cried. \"It would be a sort of sacrilege. I am\ngoing to be a nun. Besides, why should you? I can quite well understand\nyour feeling for Judas. But how is Judas more disgraced than any other\nCollege? If it were only the Judas undergraduates who had--\"\n\n\"There were others?\" cried the Warden. \"How many?\"\n\n\"All. All the boys from all the Colleges.\"\n\nThe Warden heaved a deep sigh. \"Of course,\" he said, \"this changes the\naspect of the whole matter. I wish you had made it clear at once. You\ngave me a very great shock,\" he said sinking into his arm-chair, \"and I\nhave not yet recovered. You must study the art of exposition.\"\n\n\"That will depend on the rules of the convent.\"\n\n\"Ah, I forgot that you were going into a convent. Anglican, I hope?\"\n\nAnglican, she supposed.\n\n\"As a young man,\" he said, \"I saw much of dear old Dr. Pusey. It might\nhave somewhat reconciled him to my marriage if he had known that my\ngrand-daughter would take the veil.\" He adjusted his glasses, and looked\nat her. \"Are you sure you have a vocation?\"\n\n\"Yes. I want to be out of the world. I want to do no more harm.\"\n\nHe eyed her musingly. \"That,\" he said, \"is rather a revulsion than\na vocation. I remember that I ventured to point out to Dr. Pusey the\ndifference between those two things, when he was almost persuading me\nto enter a Brotherhood founded by one of his friends. It may be that the\nworld would be well rid of you, my dear child. But it is not the world\nonly that we must consider. Would you grace the recesses of the Church?\"\n\n\"I could but try,\" said Zuleika.\n\n\"'You could but try' are the very words Dr. Pusey used to me. I ventured\nto say that in such a matter effort itself was a stigma of unfitness.\nFor all my moods of revulsion, I knew that my place was in the world. I\nstayed there.\"\n\n\"But suppose, grand-papa\"--and, seeing in fancy the vast agitated\nflotilla of crinolines, she could not forbear a smile--\"suppose all the\nyoung ladies of that period had drowned themselves for love of you?\"\n\nHer smile seemed to nettle the Warden. \"I was greatly admired,\" he said.\n\"Greatly,\" he repeated.\n\n\"And you liked that, grand-papa?\"\n\n\"Yes, my dear. Yes, I am afraid I did. But I never encouraged it.\"\n\n\"Your own heart was never touched?\"\n\n\"Never, until I met Laura Frith.\"\n\n\"Who was she?\"\n\n\"She was my future wife.\"\n\n\"And how was it you singled her out from the rest? Was she very\nbeautiful?\"\n\n\"No. It cannot be said that she was beautiful. Indeed, she was accounted\nplain. I think it was her great dignity that attracted me. She did not\nsmile archly at me, nor shake her ringlets. In those days it was the\nfashion for young ladies to embroider slippers for such men in holy\norders as best pleased their fancy. I received hundreds--thousands--of\nsuch slippers. But never a pair from Laura Frith.\"\n\n\"She did not love you?\" asked Zuleika, who had seated herself on the\nfloor at her grandfather's feet.\n\nI concluded that she did not. It interested me very greatly. It fired\nme.\n\n\"Was she incapable of love?\"\n\n\"No, it was notorious in her circle that she had loved often, but loved\nin vain.\"\n\n\"Why did she marry you?\"\n\n\"I think she was fatigued by my importunities. She was not very strong.\nBut it may be that she married me out of pique. She never told me. I did\nnot inquire.\"\n\n\"Yet you were very happy with her?\"\n\n\"While she lived, I was ideally happy.\"\n\nThe young woman stretched out a hand, and laid it on the clasped hands\nof the old man. He sat gazing into the past. She was silent for a while;\nand in her eyes, still fixed intently on his face, there were tears.\n\n\"Grand-papa dear\"--but there were tears in her voice, too.\n\n\"My child, you don't understand. If I had needed pity--\"\n\n\"I do understand--so well. I wasn't pitying you, dear, I was envying you\na little.\"\n\n\"Me?--an old man with only the remembrance of happiness?\"\n\n\"You, who have had happiness granted to you. That isn't what made me\ncry, though. I cried because I was glad. You and I, with all this great\nspan of years between us, and yet--so wonderfully alike! I had always\nthought of myself as a creature utterly apart.\"\n\n\"Ah, that is how all young people think of themselves. It wears off.\nTell me about this wonderful resemblance of ours.\"\n\nHe sat attentive while she described her heart to him. But when, at the\nclose of her confidences, she said, \"So you see it's a case of sheer\nheredity, grand-papa,\" the word \"Fiddlesticks!\" would out.\n\n\"Forgive me, my dear,\" he said, patting her hand. \"I was very much\ninterested. But I do believe young people are even more staggered by\nthemselves than they were in my day. And then, all these grand theories\nthey fall back on! Heredity... as if there were something to baffle us\nin the fact of a young woman liking to be admired! And as if it were\npassing strange of her to reserve her heart for a man she can respect\nand look up to! And as if a man's indifference to her were not of all\nthings the likeliest to give her a sense of inferiority to him! You and\nI, my dear, may in some respects be very queer people, but in the matter\nof the affections we are ordinary enough.\"\n\n\"Oh grand-papa, do you really mean that?\" she cried eagerly.\n\n\"At my age, a man husbands his resources. He says nothing that he does\nnot really mean. The indifference between you and other young women\nis that which lay also between me and other young men: a special\nattractiveness... Thousands of slippers, did I say? Tens of thousands. I\nhad hoarded them with a fatuous pride. On the evening of my betrothal I\nmade a bonfire of them, visible from three counties. I danced round it\nall night.\" And from his old eyes darted even now the reflections of\nthose flames.\n\n\"Glorious!\" whispered Zuleika. \"But ah,\" she said, rising to her feet,\n\"tell me no more of it--poor me! You see, it isn't a mere special\nattractiveness that _I_ have. _I_ am irresistible.\"\n\n\"A daring statement, my child--very hard to prove.\"\n\n\"Hasn't it been proved up to the hilt to-day?\"\n\n\"To-day?... Ah, and so they did really all drown themselves for you?...\nDear, dear!... The Duke--he, too?\"\n\n\"He set the example.\"\n\n\"No! You don't say so! He was a greatly-gifted young man--a true\nornament to the College. But he always seemed to me rather--what shall I\nsay?--inhuman... I remember now that he did seem rather excited when\nhe came to the concert last night and you weren't yet there... You are\nquite sure you were the cause of his death?\"\n\n\"Quite,\" said Zuleika, marvelling at the lie--or fib, rather: he had\nbeen GOING to die for her. But why not have told the truth? Was it\npossible, she wondered, that her wretched vanity had survived her\nrenunciation of the world? Why had she so resented just now the doubt\ncast on that irresistibility which had blighted and cranked her whole\nlife?\n\n\"Well, my dear,\" said the Warden, \"I confess that I am\namazed--astounded.\" Again he adjusted his glasses, and looked at her.\n\nShe found herself moving slowly around the study, with the gait of a\nmannequin in a dress-maker's show-room. She tried to stop this; but her\nbody seemed to be quite beyond control of her mind. It had the insolence\nto go ambling on its own account. \"Little space you'll have in a convent\ncell,\" snarled her mind vindictively. Her body paid no heed whatever.\n\nHer grandfather, leaning back in his chair, gazed at the ceiling, and\nmeditatively tapped the finger-tips of one hand against those of the\nother. \"Sister Zuleika,\" he presently said to the ceiling.\n\n\"Well? and what is there so--so ridiculous in\"--but the rest was lost in\ntrill after trill of laughter; and these were then lost in sobs.\n\nThe Warden had risen from his chair. \"My dear,\" he said, \"I wasn't\nlaughing. I was only--trying to imagine. If you really want to retire\nfrom--\"\n\n\"I do,\" moaned Zuleika.\n\n\"Then perhaps--\"\n\n\"But I don't,\" she wailed.\n\n\"Of course, you don't, my dear.\"\n\n\"Why, of course?\"\n\n\"Come, you are tired, my poor child. That is very natural after this\nwonderful, this historic day. Come dry your eyes. There, that's better.\nTo-morrow--\"\n\n\"I do believe you're a little proud of me.\"\n\n\"Heaven forgive me, I believe I am. A grandfather's heart--But there,\ngood night, my dear. Let me light your candle.\"\n\nShe took her cloak, and followed him out to the hall table. There she\nmentioned that she was going away early to-morrow.\n\n\"To the convent?\" he slyly asked.\n\n\"Ah, don't tease me, grand-papa.\"\n\n\"Well, I am sorry you are going away, my dear. But perhaps, in the\ncircumstances, it is best. You must come and stay here again, later\non,\" he said, handing her the lit candle. \"Not in term-time, though,\" he\nadded.\n\n\"No,\" she echoed, \"not in term-time.\"\n\n\n\n\nXXIV\n\nFrom the shifting gloom of the stair-case to the soft radiance cast\nthrough the open door of her bedroom was for poor Zuleika an almost\nheartening transition. She stood awhile on the threshold, watching\nMelisande dart to and fro like a shuttle across a loom. Already the main\npart of the packing seemed to have been accomplished. The wardrobe was a\nyawning void, the carpet was here and there visible, many of the\ntrunks were already brimming and foaming over... Once more on the road!\nSomewhat as, when beneath the stars the great tent had been struck, and\nthe lions were growling in their vans, and the horses were pawing the\nstamped grass and whinnying, and the elephants trumpeting, Zuleika's\nmother may often have felt within her a wan exhilaration, so now did the\nheart of that mother's child rise and flutter amidst the familiar bustle\nof \"being off.\" Weary she was of the world, and angry she was at not\nbeing, after all, good enough for something better. And yet--well, at\nleast, good-bye to Oxford!\n\nShe envied Melisande, so nimbly and cheerfully laborious till the day\nshould come when her betrothed had saved enough to start a little cafe\nof his own and make her his bride and dame de comptoir. Oh, to have a\npurpose, a prospect, a stake in the world, as this faithful soul had!\n\n\"Can I help you at all, Melisande?\" she asked, picking her way across\nthe strewn floor.\n\nMelisande, patting down a pile of chiffon, seemed to be amused at such\na notion. \"Mademoiselle has her own art. Do I mix myself in that?\" she\ncried, waving one hand towards the great malachite casket.\n\nZuleika looked at the casket, and then very gratefully at the maid. Her\nart--how had she forgotten that? Here was solace, purpose. She would\nwork as she had never worked yet. She KNEW that she had it in her to do\nbetter than she had ever done. She confessed to herself that she had too\noften been slack in the matter of practice and rehearsal, trusting her\npersonal magnetism to carry her through. Only last night she had badly\nfumbled, more than once. Her bravura business with the Demon Egg-Cup had\nbeen simply vile. The audience hadn't noticed it, perhaps, but she\nhad. Now she would perfect herself. Barely a fortnight now before her\nengagement at the Folies Bergeres! What if--no, she must not think of\nthat! But the thought insisted. What if she essayed for Paris that\nwhich again and again she had meant to graft on to her repertory--the\nProvoking Thimble?\n\nShe flushed at the possibility. What if her whole present repertory were\nbut a passing phase in her art--a mere beginning--an earlier manner? She\nremembered how marvellously last night she had manipulated the ear-rings\nand the studs. Then lo! the light died out of her eyes, and her face\ngrew rigid. That memory had brought other memories in its wake.\n\nFor her, when she fled the Broad, Noaks' window had blotted out all\nelse. Now she saw again that higher window, saw that girl flaunting her\near-rings, gibing down at her. \"He put them in with his own hands!\"--the\nwords rang again in her ears, making her cheeks tingle. Oh, he had\nthought it a very clever thing to do, no doubt--a splendid little\nrevenge, something after his own heart! \"And he kissed me in the open\nstreet\"--excellent, excellent! She ground her teeth. And these doings\nmust have been fresh in his mind when she overtook him and walked with\nhim to the house-boat! Infamous! And she had then been wearing his\nstuds! She drew his attention to them when--\n\nHer jewel-box stood open, to receive the jewels she wore to-night. She\nwent very calmly to it. There, in a corner of the topmost tray, rested\nthe two great white pearls--the pearls which, in one way and another,\nhad meant so much to her.\n\n\"Melisande!\"\n\n\"Mademoiselle?\"\n\n\"When we go to Paris, would you like to make a little present to your\nfiance?\"\n\n\"Je voudrais bien, mademoiselle.\"\n\n\"Then you shall give him these,\" said Zuleika, holding out the two\nstuds.\n\n\"Mais jamais de la vie! Chez Tourtel tout le monde le dirait\nmillionaire. Un garcon de cafe qui porte au plastron des perles\npareilles--merci!\"\n\n\"Tell him he may tell every one that they were given to me by the late\nDuke of Dorset, and given by me to you, and by you to him.\"\n\n\"Mais--\" The protest died on Melisande's lips. Suddenly she had ceased\nto see the pearls as trinkets finite and inapposite--saw them as things\npresently transmutable into little marble tables, bocks, dominos,\nabsinthes au sucre, shiny black portfolios with weekly journals in them,\nyellow staves with daily journals flapping from them, vermouths secs,\nvermouths cassis...\n\n\"Mademoiselle is too amiable,\" she said, taking the pearls.\n\nAnd certainly, just then, Zuleika was looking very amiable indeed. The\nlook was transient. Nothing, she reflected, could undo what the Duke had\ndone. That hateful, impudent girl would take good care that every one\nshould know. \"He put them in with his own hands.\" HER ear-rings! \"He\nkissed me in the public street. He loved me\"... Well, he had called out\n\"Zuleika!\" and every one around had heard him. That was something. But\nhow glad all the old women in the world would be to shake their heads\nand say \"Oh, no, my dear, believe me! It wasn't anything to do with HER.\nI'm told on the very best authority,\" and so forth, and so on. She knew\nhe had told any number of undergraduates he was going to die for her.\nBut they, poor fellows, could not bear witness. And good heavens!\nIf there were a doubt as to the Duke's motive, why not doubts as to\ntheirs?... But many of them had called out \"Zuleika!\" too. And of course\nany really impartial person who knew anything at all about the matter at\nfirst hand would be sure in his own mind that it was perfectly absurd to\npretend that the whole thing wasn't entirely and absolutely for her...\nAnd of course some of the men must have left written evidence of their\nintention. She remembered that at The MacQuern's to-day was a Mr.\nCraddock, who had made a will in her favour and wanted to read it aloud\nto her in the middle of luncheon. Oh, there would be proof positive as\nto many of the men. But of the others it would be said that they died\nin trying to rescue their comrades. There would be all sorts of silly\nfar-fetched theories, and downright lies that couldn't be disproved...\n\n\"Melisande, that crackling of tissue paper is driving me mad! Do leave\noff! Can't you see that I am waiting to be undressed?\"\n\nThe maid hastened to her side, and with quick light fingers began to\nundress her. \"Mademoiselle va bien dormir--ca se voit,\" she purred.\n\n\"I shan't,\" said Zuleika.\n\nNevertheless, it was soothing to be undressed, and yet more soothing\nanon to sit merely night-gowned before the mirror, while, slowly and\ngently, strongly and strand by strand, Melisande brushed her hair.\n\nAfter all, it didn't so much matter what the world thought. Let the\nworld whisper and insinuate what it would. To slur and sully, to\nbelittle and drag down--that was what the world always tried to do.\nBut great things were still great, and fair things still fair. With no\nthought for the world's opinion had these men gone down to the water\nto-day. Their deed was for her and themselves alone. It had sufficed\nthem. Should it not suffice her? It did, oh it did. She was a wretch to\nhave repined.\n\nAt a gesture from her, Melisande brought to a close the rhythmical\nministrations, and--using no tissue paper this time--did what was yet to\nbe done among the trunks.\n\n\"WE know, you and I,\" Zuleika whispered to the adorable creature in the\nmirror; and the adorable creature gave back her nod and smile.\n\nTHEY knew, these two.\n\nYet, in their happiness, rose and floated a shadow between them. It was\nthe ghost of that one man who--THEY knew--had died irrelevantly, with a\ncold heart.\n\nCame also the horrid little ghost of one who had died late and unseemly.\n\nAnd now, thick and fast, swept a whole multitude of other ghosts, the\nghosts of all them who, being dead, could not die again; the poor ghosts\nof them who had done what they could, and could do no more.\n\nNo more? Was it not enough? The lady in the mirror gazed at the lady\nin the room, reproachfully at first, then--for were they not\nsisters?--relentingly, then pityingly. Each of the two covered her face\nwith her hands.\n\nAnd there recurred, as by stealth, to the lady in the room a thought\nthat had assailed her not long ago in Judas Street... a thought about\nthe power of example...\n\nAnd now, with pent breath and fast-beating heart, she stood staring at\nthe lady of the mirror, without seeing her; and now she wheeled round\nand swiftly glided to that little table on which stood her two books.\nShe snatched Bradshaw.\n\nWe always intervene between Bradshaw and any one whom we see consulting\nhim. \"Mademoiselle will permit me to find that which she seeks?\" asked\nMelisande.\n\n\"Be quiet,\" said Zuleika. We always repulse, at first, any one who\nintervenes between us and Bradshaw.\n\nWe always end by accepting the intervention. \"See if it is possible to\ngo direct from here to Cambridge,\" said Zuleika, handing the book on.\n\"If it isn't, then--well, see how to get there.\"\n\nWe never have any confidence in the intervener. Nor is the intervener,\nwhen it comes to the point, sanguine. With mistrust mounting to\nexasperation Zuleika sat watching the faint and frantic researches of\nher maid.\n\n\"Stop!\" she said suddenly. \"I have a much better idea. Go down very\nearly to the station. See the station-master. Order me a special train.\nFor ten o'clock, say.\"\n\nRising, she stretched her arms above her head. Her lips parted in a\nyawn, met in a smile. With both hands she pushed back her hair from her\nshoulders, and twisted it into a loose knot. Very lightly she slipped up\ninto bed, and very soon she was asleep.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Zuleika Dobson, by Max Beerbohm\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK ZULEIKA DOBSON ***\n\n***** This file should be named 1845.txt or 1845.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/1\/8\/4\/1845\/\n\nProduced by Judy Boss\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http:\/\/www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp:\/\/pglaf.org\/fundraising.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http:\/\/pglaf.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":1124,"split":"test"}
