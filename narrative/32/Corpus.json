One such tribute appeared in 'The Century', an illustrated monthly magazine. As part of this article he included a summary of Darwin's work relating to this book (p.\u00c2\u00a0428):\n\"The cowslip (Primula veris) has two kinds of flowers in nearly equal proportions: in the one the stamens are long and the style short, and in the other the reverse, so that in one the stamens are visible at the mouth of the tube of the flower, in the other the stigma occupies the same place, while the stamens are halfway down the tube. The fact had been known to botanists for 70 years, but had been classed as a case of mere variability, and therefore considered to be of no importance. In 1860 Darwin set to find out what it meant, since, according to his views, a definite variation like this must have a purpose. After a considerable amount of observation and experiment, he found that bees and moths visited the flowers, and that their proboscis become covered with pollen while sucking up the nectar, and further, the pollen of a long stamened plant would most surely be deposited on the stigma of the long styled plants, and vice versa. Now followed a long series of experiments, in which cowslips were fertilised with either pollen from the same kind or from a different kind of flower, and the invariable result was that the crosses between the two different types of flowers produced more good capsules, and more seed in each capsule; and as these crosses would be most frequently effected by insects, it was clear that this curious arrangement directly served to increase the fertility of this common plant. The same thing was found to occur in the primrose, as well as in flax (Linum perenne), lungworts (Pulmonaria), and a host of other plants, including the American partridge-berry (Mitchella repens). These are called dimorphic heterostyled plants.\nStill more extraordinary is the case of the common loosestrife (Lythrum salicaria), which has both stamens and styles of three distinct lengths, each flower having two sets of stamens and one style, all of different lengths, and arranged in three different ways:\nA short style, with six medium and six long stamens;\nA medium style, with six short and six long stamens;\nA long style, with six medium and six short stamens.\nThese flowers can be fertilised in eighteen distinct ways, necessitating a vast number of experiments, the result being, as in the case of the cowslip, that flowers fertilised by the pollen from stamens of the same length as the styles, gave on the average a larger number of capsules and a very much larger number of seeds than in any other case. The exact correspondence in the length of the style of each form with that of one set of stamens in the other form insures that the pollen attached to any part of the body of an insect shall be applied to a style of the same length on another plant, and there is thus a triple chance of the maximum of fertility....There is thus the clearest proof that these complex arrangements have the important end of securing both a more abundant and more vigorous offspring.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nObservations and experiments still continue today to further the understanding of this phenomenon instigated by Darwin in this original and seminal work.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfProject Gutenberg Etext of Different Forms of Flowers, by Charles Darwin\n#19 in our series by Charles Darwin.\n\nCopyright laws are changing all over the world, be sure to check\nthe laws for your country before redistributing these files!!!\n\nPlease take a look at the important information in this header.\nWe encourage you to keep this file on your own disk, keeping an\nelectronic path open for the next readers.\n\nPlease do not remove this.\n\nThis should be the first thing seen when anyone opens the book.\nDo not change or edit it without written permission.

As far as the sexual relations of flowers are\nconcerned, Linnaeus long ago divided them into hermaphrodite, monoecious,\ndioecious, and polygamous species. This fundamental distinction, with the aid of\nseveral subdivisions in each of the four classes, will serve my purpose; but the\nclassification is artificial, and the groups often pass into one another.\n\nThe hermaphrodite class contains two interesting sub-groups, namely,\nheterostyled and cleistogamic plants; but there are several other less important\nsubdivisions, presently to be given, in which flowers differing in various ways\nfrom one another are produced by the same species.\n\nSome plants were described by me several years ago, in a series of papers read\nbefore the Linnean Society, the individuals of which exist under two or three\nforms, differing in the length of their pistils and stamens and in other\nrespects. (Introduction\/1. \"On the Two Forms or Dimorphic Condition in the\nSpecies of Primula, and on their remarkable Sexual Relations\" 'Journal of the\nProceedings of the Linnean Society' volume 6 1862 page 77. \"On the Existence of\nTwo Forms, and on their Reciprocal Sexual Relation, in several Species of the\nGenus Linum\" Ibid volume 7 1863 page 69. \"On the Sexual Relations of the Three\nForms of Lythrum salicaria\" Ibid volume 8 1864 page 169. \"On the Character and\nHybrid-like Nature of the Offspring from the Illegitimate Unions of Dimorphic\nand Trimorphic Plants\" Ibid volume 10 1868 page 393. \"On the Specific\nDifferences between Primula veris, Brit. Fl. (var. officinalis, Linn.), P.\nvulgaris, Brit. Fl. (var. acaulis, Linn.), and P. elatior, Jacq.; and on the\nHybrid Nature of the Common oxlip. With Supplementary Remarks on Naturally\nProduced Hybrids in the Genus Verbascum\" Ibid volume 10 1868 page 437.) They\nwere called by me dimorphic and trimorphic, but have since been better named by\nHildebrand, heterostyled. (Introduction\/2. The term \"heterostyled\" does not\nexpress all the differences between the forms; but this is a failure common in\nmany cases. As the term has been adopted by writers in various countries, I am\nunwilling to change it for that of heterogone or heterogonous, though this has\nbeen proposed by so high an authority as Professor Asa Gray: see the 'American\nNaturalist' January 1877 page 42.) As I have many still unpublished observations\nwith respect to these plants, it has seemed to me advisable to republish my\nformer papers in a connected and corrected form, together with the new matter.\nIt will be shown that these heterostyled plants are adapted for reciprocal\nfertilisation; so that the two or three forms, though all are hermaphrodites,\nare related to one another almost like the males and females of ordinary\nunisexual animals. I will also give a full abstract of such observations as have\nbeen published since the appearance of my papers; but only those cases will be\nnoticed, with respect to which the evidence seems fairly satisfactory. Some\nplants have been supposed to be heterostyled merely from their pistils and\nstamens varying greatly in length, and I have been myself more than once thus\ndeceived. With some species the pistil continues growing for a long time, so\nthat if old and young flowers are compared they might be thought to be\nheterostyled. Again, a species tending to become dioecious, with the stamens\nreduced in some individuals and with the pistils in others, often presents a\ndeceptive appearance. Unless it be proved that one form is fully fertile only\nwhen it is fertilised with pollen from another form, we have not complete\nevidence that the species is heterostyled. But when the pistils and stamens\ndiffer in length in two or three sets of individuals, and this is accompanied by\na difference in the size of the pollen-grains or in the state of the stigma, we\nmay infer with much safety that the species is heterostyled. I have, however,\noccasionally trusted to a difference between the two forms in the length of the\npistil alone, or in the length of the stigma together with its more or less\npapillose condition; and in one instance differences of this kind have been\nproved by trials made on the fertility of the two forms, to be sufficient\nevidence.\n\nThe second sub-group above referred to consists of hermaphrodite plants, which\nbear two kinds of flowers--the one perfect and fully expanded--the other minute,\ncompletely closed, with the petals rudimentary, often with some of the anthers\naborted, and the remaining ones together with the stigmas much reduced in size;\nyet these flowers are perfectly fertile. They have been called by Dr. Kuhn\ncleistogamic, and they will be described in the last chapter of this volume.\n(Introduction\/3. 'Botanische Zeitung' 1867 page 65. Several plants are known\noccasionally to produce flowers destitute of a corolla; but they belong to a\ndifferent class of cases from cleistogamic flowers. This deficiency seems to\nresult from the conditions to which the plants have been subjected, and partakes\nof the nature of a monstrosity. All the flowers on the same plant are commonly\naffected in the same manner. Such cases, though they have sometimes been ranked\nas cleistogamic, do not come within our present scope: see Dr. Maxwell Masters\n'Vegetable Teratology' 1869 page 403.) They are manifestly adapted for self-\nfertilisation, which is effected at the cost of a wonderfully small expenditure\nof pollen; whilst the perfect flowers produced by the same plant are capable of\ncross-fertilisation. Certain aquatic species, when they flower beneath the\nwater, keep their corollas closed, apparently to protect their pollen; they\nmight therefore be called cleistogamic, but for reasons assigned in the proper\nplace are not included in the present sub-group. Several cleistogamic species,\nas we shall hereafter see, bury their ovaries or young capsules in the ground;\nbut some few other plants behave in the same manner; and, as they do not bury\nall their flowers, they might have formed a small separate subdivision.\n\nAnother interesting subdivision consists of certain plants, discovered by H.\nMuller, some individuals of which bear conspicuous flowers adapted for cross-\nfertilisation by the aid of insects, and others much smaller and less\nconspicuous flowers, which have often been slightly modified so as to ensure\nself-fertilisation. Lysimachia vulgaris, Euphrasia officinalis, Rhinanthus\ncrista-galli, and Viola tricolor come under this head. (Introduction\/4. H.\nMuller 'Nature' September 25, 1873 volume 8 page 433 and November 20, 1873\nvolume 9 page 44. Also 'Die Befruchtung der Blumen' etc. 1873 page 294.) The\nsmaller and less conspicuous flowers are not closed, but as far as the purpose\nwhich they serve is concerned, namely, the assured propagation of the species,\nthey approach in nature cleistogamic flowers; but they differ from them by the\ntwo kinds being produced on distinct plants.\n\nWith many plants, the flowers towards the outside of the inflorescence are much\nlarger and more conspicuous than the central ones. As I shall not have occasion\nto refer to plants of this kind in the following chapters, I will here give a\nfew details respecting them. It is familiar to every one that the ray-florets of\nthe Compositae often differ remarkably from the others; and so it is with the\nouter flowers of many Umbelliferae, some Cruciferae and a few other families.\nSeveral species of Hydrangea and Viburnum offer striking instances of the same\nfact. The Rubiaceous genus Mussaenda presents a very curious appearance from\nsome of the flowers having the tip of one of the sepals developed into a large\npetal-like expansion, coloured either white or purple. The outer flowers in\nseveral Acanthaceous genera are large and conspicuous but sterile; the next in\norder are smaller, open, moderately fertile and capable of cross-fertilisation;\nwhilst the central ones are cleistogamic, being still smaller, closed and highly\nfertile; so that here the inflorescence consists of three kinds of flowers.\n(Introduction\/5. J. Scott 'Journal of Botany' London new series volume 1 1872\npages 161-164.) From what we know in other cases of the use of the corolla,\ncoloured bracteae, etc., and from what H. Muller has observed on the frequency\nof the visits of insects to the flower-heads of the Umbelliferae and Compositae\nbeing largely determined by their conspicuousness, there can be no doubt that\nthe increased size of the corolla of the outer flowers, the inner ones being in\nall the above cases small, serves to attract insects. (Introduction\/6. 'Die\nBefruchtung der Blumen' pages 108, 412.) The result is that cross-fertilisation\nis thus favoured. Most flowers wither soon after being fertilised, but\nHildebrand states that the ray-florets of the Compositae last for a long time,\nuntil all those on the disc are impregnated; and this clearly shows the use of\nthe former. (Introduction\/7. See his interesting memoir 'Ueber die\nGeschlechtsverhaltniss bei den Compositen' 1869 page 92.) The ray-florets,\nhowever, are of service in another and very different manner, namely, by folding\ninwards at night and during cold rainy weather, so as to protect the florets of\nthe disc. (Introduction\/8. Kerner clearly shows that this is the case: 'Die\nSchutzmittel des Pollens' 1873 page 28.) Moreover they often contain matter\nwhich is excessively poisonous to insects, as may be seen in the use of flea-\npowder, and in the case of Pyrethrum, M. Belhomme has shown that the ray-florets\nare more poisonous than the disc-florets in the ratio of about three to two. We\nmay therefore believe that the ray-florets are useful in protecting the flowers\nfrom being gnawed by insects. (Introduction\/9. 'Gardener's Chronicle' 1861 page\n1067. Lindley 'Vegetable Kingdom' on Chrysanthemum 1853 page 706. Kerner in his\ninteresting essay 'Die Schutzmittel der Bluthen gegen unberufene Gaste' 1875\npage 19, insists that the petals of most plants contain matter which is\noffensive to insects, so that they are seldom gnawed, and thus the organs of\nfructification are protected. My grandfather in 1790 'Loves of the Plants' canto\n3 note to lines 184, 188, remarks that \"The flowers or petals of plants are\nperhaps in general more acrid than their leaves; hence they are much seldomer\neaten by insects.\")\n\nIt is a well-known yet remarkable fact that the circumferential flowers of many\nof the foregoing plants have both their male and female reproductive organs\naborted, as with the Hydrangea, Viburnum and certain Compositae; or the male\norgans alone are aborted, as in many Compositae. Between the sexless, female and\nhermaphrodite states of these latter flowers, the finest gradations may be\ntraced, as Hildebrand has shown. (Introduction\/10. 'Ueber die\nGeschlechtsverhaltnisse bei den Compositen' 1869 pages 78-91.) He also shows\nthat there is a close relation between the size of the corolla in the ray-\nflorets and the degree of abortion in their reproductive organs. As we have good\nreason to believe that these florets are highly serviceable to the plants which\npossess them, more especially by rendering the flower-heads conspicuous to\ninsects, it is a natural inference that their corollas have been increased in\nsize for this special purpose; and that their development has subsequently led,\nthrough the principle of compensation or balancement, to the more or less\ncomplete reduction of the reproductive organs. But an opposite view may be\nmaintained, namely, that the reproductive organs first began to fail, as often\nhappens under cultivation, and, as a consequence, the corolla became, through\ncompensation, more highly developed. (Introduction\/11. I have discussed this\nsubject in my 'Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication' chapter 18\n2nd edition volume 2 pages 152, 156.) This view, however, is not probable, for\nwhen hermaphrodite plants become dioecious or gyno-dioecious--that is, are\nconverted into hermaphrodites and females--the corolla of the female seems to be\nalmost invariably reduced in size in consequence of the abortion of the male\norgans. The difference in the result in these two classes of cases, may perhaps\nbe accounted for by the matter saved through the abortion of the male organs in\nthe females of gyno-dioecious and dioecious plants being directed (as we shall\nsee in a future chapter) to the formation of an increased supply of seeds;\nwhilst in the case of the exterior florets and flowers of the plants which we\nare here considering, such matter is expended in the development of a\nconspicuous corolla. Whether in the present class of cases the corolla was first\naffected, as seems to me the more probable view, or the reproductive organs\nfirst failed, their states of development are now firmly correlated. We see this\nwell-illustrated in Hydrangea and Viburnum; for when these plants are\ncultivated, the corollas of both the interior and exterior flowers become\nlargely developed, and their reproductive organs are aborted.\n\nThere is a closely analogous subdivision of plants, including the genus Muscari\n(or Feather Hyacinth) and the allied Bellevalia, which bear both perfect flowers\nand closed bud-like bodies that never expand. The latter resemble in this\nrespect cleistogamic flowers, but differ widely from them in being sterile and\nconspicuous. Not only the aborted flower-buds and their peduncles (which are\nelongated apparently through the principle of compensation) are brightly\ncoloured, but so is the upper part of the spike--all, no doubt, for the sake of\nguiding insects to the inconspicuous perfect flowers. From such cases as these\nwe may pass on to certain Labiatae, for instance, Salvia Horminum in which (as I\nhear from Mr. Thiselton Dyer) the upper bracts are enlarged and brightly\ncoloured, no doubt for the same purpose as before, with the flowers suppressed.\n\nIn the Carrot and some allied Umbelliferae, the central flower has its petals\nsomewhat enlarged, and these are of a dark purplish-red tint; but it cannot be\nsupposed that this one small flower makes the large white umbel at all more\nconspicuous to insects. The central flowers are said to be neuter or sterile,\nbut I obtained by artificial fertilisation a seed (fruit) apparently perfect\nfrom one such flower. (Introduction\/12. 'The English Flora' by Sir J.E. Smith\n1824 volume 2 page 39.) Occasionally two or three of the flowers next to the\ncentral one are similarly characterised; and according to Vaucher \"cette\nsinguliere degeneration s'etend quelquefois a l'ombelle entiere.\"\n(Introduction\/13. 'Hist. Phys. des Plantes d'Europe' 1841 tome 2 page 614. On\nthe Echinophora page 627.) That the modified central flower is of no functional\nimportance to the plant is almost certain. It may perhaps be a remnant of a\nformer and ancient condition of the species, when one flower alone, the central\none, was female and yielded seeds, as in the Umbelliferous genus Echinophora.\nThere is nothing surprising in the central flower tending to retain its former\ncondition longer than the others; for when irregular flowers become regular or\npeloric, they are apt to be central; and such peloric flowers apparently owe\ntheir origin either to arrested development--that is, to the preservation of an\nearly stage of development--or to reversion. Central and perfectly developed\nflowers in not a few plants in their normal condition (for instance, the common\nRue and Adoxa) differ slightly in structure, as in the number of the parts, from\nthe other flowers on the same plant. All such cases seem connected with the fact\nof the bud which stands at the end of the shoot being better nourished than the\nothers, as it receives the most sap. (Introduction\/14. This whole subject,\nincluding pelorism, has been discussed, and references given in my 'Variation of\nAnimals and Plants under Domestication' chapter 26 2nd edition volume 2 page\n338.)\n\nThe cases hitherto mentioned relate to hermaphrodite species which bear\ndifferently constructed flowers; but there are some plants that produce\ndifferently formed seeds, of which Dr. Kuhn has given a list. (Introduction\/15.\n'Botanische Zeitung' 1867 page 67.) With the Umbelliferae and Compositae, the\nflowers that produce these seeds likewise differ, and the differences in the\nstructure of the seeds are of a very important nature. The causes which have led\nto differences in the seeds on the same plant are not known; and it is very\ndoubtful whether they subserve any special end.\n\nWe now come to our second Class, that of monoecious species, or those which have\ntheir sexes separated but borne on the same plant. The flowers necessarily\ndiffer, but when those of one sex include rudiments of the other sex, the\ndifference between the two kinds is usually not great. When the difference is\ngreat, as we see in catkin-bearing plants, this depends largely on many of the\nspecies in this, as well as in the next or dioecious class, being fertilised by\nthe aid of the wind; for the male flowers have in this case to produce a\nsurprising amount of incoherent pollen. (Introduction\/16. Delpino 'Studi sopra\nuno Lignaggio Anemofilo' Firenze 1871.) Some few monoecious plants consist of\ntwo bodies of individuals, with their flowers differing in function, though not\nin structure; for certain individuals mature their pollen before the female\nflowers on the same plant are ready for fertilisation, and are called\nproterandrous; whilst conversely other individuals, called proterogynous, have\ntheir stigmas mature before their pollen is ready. The purpose of this curious\nfunctional difference obviously is to favour the cross-fertilisation of distinct\nplants. A case of this kind was first observed by Delpino in the Walnut (Juglans\nregia), and has since been observed with the common Nut (Corylus avellana). I\nmay add that according to H. Muller the individuals of some few hermaphrodite\nplants differ in a like manner; some being proterandrous and others\nproterogynous. (Introduction\/17. Delpino 'Ult. Osservazioni sulla Dicogamia'\npart 2 fasc 2 page 337. Mr. Wetterhan and H. Muller on Corylus 'Nature' volume\n11 page 507 and 1875 page 26. On proterandrous and proterogynous hermaphrodite\nindividuals of the same species, see H. Muller 'Die Befruchtung' etc. pages 285,\n339.) On cultivated trees of the Walnut and Mulberry, the male flowers have been\nobserved to abort on certain individuals, which have thus been converted into\nfemales; but whether there are any species in a state of nature which co-exist\nas monoecious and female individuals, I do not know. (Introduction\/18.\n'Gardener's Chronicle' 1847 pages 541, 558.)\n\nThe third Class consists of dioecious species, and the remarks made under the\nlast class with respect to the amount of difference between the male and female\nflowers are here applicable. It is at present an inexplicable fact that with\nsome dioecious plants, of which the Restiaceae of Australia and the Cape of Good\nHope offer the most striking instance, the differentiation of the sexes has\naffected the whole plant to such an extent (as I hear from Mr. Thiselton Dyer)\nthat Mr. Bentham and Professor Oliver have often found it impossible to match\nthe male and female specimens of the same species. In my seventh chapter some\nobservations will be given on the gradual conversion of heterostyled and of\nordinary hermaphrodite plants into dioecious or sub-dioecious species.\n\nThe fourth and last Class consists of the plants which were called polygamous by\nLinnaeus; but it appears to me that it would be convenient to confine this term\nto the species which coexist as hermaphrodites, males and females; and to give\nnew names to several other combinations of the sexes--a plan which I shall here\nfollow. Polygamous plants, in this confined sense of the term, may be divided\ninto two sub-groups, according as the three sexual forms are found on the same\nindividual or on distinct individuals. Of this latter or trioicous sub-group,\nthe common Ash (Fraxinus excelsior) offers a good instance: thus, I examined\nduring the spring and autumn fifteen trees growing in the same field; and of\nthese, eight produced male flowers alone, and in the autumn not a single seed;\nfour produced only female flowers, which set an abundance of seeds; three were\nhermaphrodites, which had a different aspect from the other trees whilst in\nflower, and two of them produced nearly as many seeds as the female trees,\nwhilst the third produced none, so that it was in function a male. The\nseparation of the sexes, however, is not complete in the Ash; for the female\nflowers include stamens, which drop off at an early period, and their anthers,\nwhich never open or dehisce, generally contain pulpy matter instead of pollen.\nOn some female trees, however, I found a few anthers containing pollen grains\napparently sound. On the male trees most of the flowers include pistils, but\nthese likewise drop off at an early period; and the ovules, which ultimately\nabort, are very small compared with those in female flowers of the same age.\n\nOf the other or monoicous sub-group of polygamous plants, or those which bear\nhermaphrodite, male and female flowers on the same individual, the common Maple\n(Acer campestre) offers a good instance; but Lecoq states that some trees are\ntruly dioecious, and this shows how easily one state passes into another.\n(Introduction\/19. 'Geographie Botanique' tome 5 page 367.)\n\nA considerable number of plants generally ranked as polygamous exist under only\ntwo forms, namely, as hermaphrodites and females; and these may be called gyno-\ndioecious, of which the common Thyme offers a good example. In my seventh\nchapter I shall give some observations on plants of this nature. Other species,\nfor instance several kinds of Atriplex, bear on the same plant hermaphrodite and\nfemale flowers; and these might be called gyno-monoecious, if a name were\ndesirable for them.\n\nAgain there are plants which produce hermaphrodite and male flowers on the same\nindividual, for instance, some species of Galium, Veratrum, etc.; and these\nmight be called andro-monoecious. If there exist plants, the individuals of\nwhich consist of hermaphrodites and males, these might be distinguished as\nandro-dioecious. But, after making inquiries from several botanists, I can hear\nof no such cases. Lecoq, however, states, but without entering into full\ndetails, that some plants of Caltha palustris produce only male flowers, and\nthat these live mingled with the hermaphrodites. (Introduction\/20. 'Geographie\nBotanique' tome 4 page 488.) The rarity of such cases as this last one is\nremarkable, as the presence of hermaphrodite and male flowers on the same\nindividual is not an unusual occurrence; it would appear as if nature did not\nthink it worth while to devote a distinct individual to the production of\npollen, excepting when this was indispensably necessary, as in the case of\ndioecious species.\n\nI have now finished my brief sketch of the several cases, as far as known to me,\nin which flowers differing in structure or in function are produced by the same\nspecies of plant. Full details will be given in the following chapters with\nrespect to many of these plants. I will begin with the heterostyled, then pass\non to certain dioecious, sub-dioecious, and polygamous species, and end with the\ncleistogamic. For the convenience of the reader, and to save space, the less\nimportant cases and details have been printed in smaller type [].\n\nI cannot close this Introduction without expressing my warm thanks to Dr. Hooker\nfor supplying me with specimens and for other aid; and to Mr. Thiselton Dyer and\nProfessor Oliver for giving me much information and other assistance. Professor\nAsa Gray, also, has uniformly aided me in many ways. To Fritz Muller of St.\nCatharina, in Brazil, I am indebted for many dried flowers of heterostyled\nplants, often accompanied with valuable notes.\n\n\nCHAPTER I.\n\nHETEROSTYLED DIMORPHIC PLANTS: PRIMULACEAE.\n\nPrimula veris or the cowslip.\nDifferences in structure between the two forms.\nTheir degrees of fertility when legitimately and illegitimately united.\nP. elatior, vulgaris, Sinensis, auricula, etc.\nSummary on the fertility of the heterostyled species of Primula.\nHomostyled species of Primula.\nHottonia palustris.\nAndrosace vitalliana.\n\n(FIGURE 1.1. Primula veris.\nLeft: Long-styled form.\nRight: Short-styled form.)\n\nIt has long been known to botanists that the common cowslip (Primula veris,\nBrit. Flora, var. officinalis, Lin.) exists under two forms, about equally\nnumerous, which obviously differ from each other in the length of their pistils\nand stamens. (1\/1. This fact, according to Von Mohl 'Botanische Zeitung' 1863\npage 326, was first observed by Persoon in the year 1794.) This difference has\nhitherto been looked at as a case of mere variability, but this view, as we\nshall presently see, is far from the true one. Florists who cultivate the\nPolyanthus and Auricula have long been aware of the two kinds of flowers, and\nthey call the plants which display the globular stigma at the mouth of the\ncorolla, \"pin-headed\" or \"pin-eyed,\" and those which display the anthers,\n\"thrum-eyed.\" (1\/2. In Johnson's Dictionary, \"thrum\" is said to be the ends of\nweavers' threads; and I suppose that some weaver who cultivated the Polyanthus\ninvented this name, from being struck with some degree of resemblance between\nthe cluster of anthers in the mouth of the corolla and the ends of his threads.)\nI will designate the two forms as the long-styled and short-styled.\n\nThe pistil in the long-styled form is almost exactly twice as long as that of\nthe short-styled. The stigma stands in the mouth of the corolla or projects just\nabove it, and is thus externally visible. It stands high above the anthers,\nwhich are situated halfway down the tube and cannot be easily seen. In the\nshort-styled form the anthers are attached near the mouth of the tube, and\ntherefore stand above the stigma, which is seated in about the middle of the\ntubular corolla. The corolla itself is of a different shape in the two forms;\nthe throat or expanded portion above the attachment of the anthers being much\nlonger in the long-styled than in the short-styled form. Village children notice\nthis difference, as they can best make necklaces by threading and slipping the\ncorollas of the long-styled flowers into one another. But there are much more\nimportant differences. The stigma in the long-styled form is globular; in the\nshort-styled it is depressed on the summit, so that the longitudinal axis of the\nformer is sometimes nearly double that of the latter. Although somewhat variable\nin shape, one difference is persistent, namely, in roughness: in some specimens\ncarefully compared, the papillae which render the stigma rough were in the long-\nstyled form from twice to thrice as long as in the short-styled. The anthers do\nnot differ in size in the two forms, which I mention because this is the case\nwith some heterostyled plants. The most remarkable difference is in the pollen-\ngrains. I measured with the micrometer many specimens, both dry and wet, taken\nfrom plants growing in different situations, and always found a palpable\ndifference. The grains distended with water from the short-styled flowers were\nabout .038 millimetres (10 to 11\/7000 of an inch) in diameter, whilst those from\nthe long-styled were about .0254 millimetres (7\/7000 of an inch), which is in\nthe ratio of 100 to 67. The pollen-grains therefore from the longer stamens of\nthe short-styled form are plainly larger than those from the shorter stamens of\nthe long-styled. When examined dry, the smaller grains are seen under a low\npower to be more transparent than the larger grains, and apparently in a greater\ndegree than can be accounted for by their less diameter. There is also a\ndifference in shape, the grains from the short-styled plants being nearly\nspherical, those from the long-styled being oblong with the angles rounded; this\ndifference disappears when the grains are distended with water. The long-styled\nplants generally tend to flower a little before the short-styled: for instance,\nI had twelve plants of each form growing in separate pots and treated in every\nrespect alike; and at the time when only a single short-styled plant was in\nflower, seven of the long-styled had expanded their flowers.\n\nWe shall, also, presently see that the short-styled plants produce more seed\nthan the long-styled. It is remarkable, according to Professor Oliver, that the\novules in the unexpanded and unimpregnated flowers of the latter are\nconsiderably larger than those of the short-styled flowers (1\/3. 'Natural\nHistory Review' July 1862 page 237.); and this I suppose is connected with the\nlong-styled flowers producing fewer seeds, so that the ovules have more space\nand nourishment for rapid development.\n\nTo sum up the differences:--The long-styled plants have a much longer pistil,\nwith a globular and much rougher stigma, standing high above the anthers. The\nstamens are short; the grains of pollen smaller and oblong in shape. The upper\nhalf of the tube of the corolla is more expanded. The number of seeds produced\nis smaller and the ovules larger. The plants tend to flower first.\n\nThe short-styled plants have a short pistil, half the length of the tube of the\ncorolla, with a smooth depressed stigma standing beneath the anthers. The\nstamens are long; the grains of pollen are spherical and larger. The tube of the\ncorolla is of uniform diameter except close to the upper end. The number of\nseeds produced is larger.\n\nI have examined a large number of flowers; and though the shape of the stigma\nand the length of the pistil both vary, especially in the short-styled form, I\nhave never met with any transitional states between the two forms in plants\ngrowing in a state of nature. There is never the slightest doubt under which\nform a plant ought to be classed. The two kinds of flowers are never found on\nthe same individual plant. I marked many cowslips and primroses, and on the\nfollowing year all retained the same character, as did some in my garden which\nflowered out of their proper season in the autumn. Mr. W. Wooler, of Darlington,\nhowever, informs us that he has seen early blossoms on the Polyanthus, which\nwere not long-styled, but became so later in the season. (1\/4. I have proved by\nnumerous experiments, hereafter to be given, that the Polyanthus is a variety of\nPrimula veris.) Possibly in this case the pistils may not have been fully\ndeveloped during the early spring. An excellent proof of the permanence of the\ntwo forms may be seen in nursery-gardens, where choice varieties of the\nPolyanthus are propagated by division; and I found whole beds of several\nvarieties, each consisting exclusively of the one or the other form. The two\nforms exist in the wild state in about equal numbers: I collected 522 umbels\nfrom plants growing in several stations, taking a single umbel from each plant;\nand 241 were long-styled, and 281 short-styled. No difference in tint or size\ncould be perceived in the two great masses of flowers.\n\nWe shall presently see that most of the species of Primula exist under two\nanalogous forms; and it may be asked what is the meaning of the above-described\nimportant differences in their structure? The question seems well worthy of\ncareful investigation, and I will give my observations on the cowslip in detail.\nThe first idea which naturally occurred to me was, that this species was tending\ntowards a dioecious condition; that the long-styled plants, with their longer\npistils, rougher stigmas, and smaller pollen-grains, were more feminine in\nnature, and would produce more seed;--that the short-styled plants, with their\nshorter pistils, longer stamens and larger pollen-grains, were more masculine in\nnature. Accordingly, in 1860, I marked a few cowslips of both forms growing in\nmy garden, and others growing in an open field, and others in a shady wood, and\ngathered and weighed the seed. In all the lots the short-styled plants yielded,\ncontrary to my expectation, most seed. Taking the lots together, the following\nis the result:--\n\nTABLE 1.1.\n\nColumn 1: Plant.\nColumn 2: Number of Plants.\nColumn 3: Number of Umbels Produced.\nColumn 4: Number of Capsules Produced.\nColumn 5: Weight of Seed In Grains.\n\nShort-styled cowslips :  9 : 33 : 199 : 83.\nLong-styled cowslips  : 13 : 51 : 261 : 91.\n\nIf we compare the weight from an equal number of plants, and from an equal\nnumber of umbels, and from an equal number of capsules of the two forms, we get\nthe following results:--\n\nTABLE 1.2.\n\nColumn 1: Plant.\nColumn 2: Number of Plants.\nColumn 3: Weight of Seed in grains.\n...\nColumn 4: Number of Umbels.\nColumn 5: Weight of Seed.\n...\nColumn 6: Number of Capsules.\nColumn 7: Weight of Seed in grains.\n\nShort-styled cowslips : 10 : 92 :: 100 : 251 :: 100 : 41.\nLong-styled cowslips : 10 : 70 :: 100 : 178 :: 100 : 34.\n\nSo that, by all these standards of comparison, the short-styled form is the more\nfertile; if we take the number of umbels (which is the fairest standard, for\nlarge and small plants are thus equalised), the short-styled plants produce more\nseed than the long-styled, in the proportion of nearly four to three.\n\nIn 1861 the trial was made in a fuller and fairer manner. A number of wild\nplants had been transplanted during the previous autumn into a large bed in my\ngarden, and all were treated alike; the result was:--\n\nTABLE 1.3.\n\nColumn 1: Plant.\nColumn 2: Number of Plants.\nColumn 3: Number of Umbels.\nColumn 4: Weight of Seed in grains.\n\nShort-styled cowslips : 47 : 173 : 745.\nLong-styled cowslips  : 58 : 208 : 692.\n\nThese figures give us the following proportions:--\n\nTABLE 1.4.\n\nColumn 1: Plant.\nColumn 2: Number of Plants.\nColumn 3: Weight of Seed in grains.\n...\nColumn 4: Number of Umbels.\nColumn 5: Weight of Seed in grains.\n\nShort-styled cowslips : 100 : 1585 :: 100 : 430.\nLong-styled cowslips  : 100 : 1093 :: 100 : 332.\n\nThe season was much more favourable this year than the last; the plants also now\ngrew in good soil, instead of in a shady wood or struggling with other plants in\nthe open field; consequently the actual produce of seed was considerably larger.\nNevertheless we have the same relative result; for the short-styled plants\nproduced more seed than the long-styled in nearly the proportion of three to\ntwo; but if we take the fairest standard of comparison, namely, the product of\nseeds from an equal number of umbels, the excess is, as in the former case,\nnearly as four to three.\n\nLooking to these trials made during two successive years on a large number of\nplants, we may safely conclude that the short-styled form is more productive\nthan the long-styled form, and the same result holds good with some other\nspecies of Primula. Consequently my anticipation that the plants with longer\npistils, rougher stigmas, shorter stamens and smaller pollen-grains, would prove\nto be more feminine in nature, is exactly the reverse of the truth.\n\nIn 1860 a few umbels on some plants of both the long-styled and short-styled\nform, which had been covered by a net, did not produce any seed, though other\numbels on the same plants, artificially fertilised, produced an abundance of\nseed; and this fact shows that the mere covering in itself was not injurious.\nAccordingly, in 1861, several plants were similarly covered just before they\nexpanded their flowers; these turned out as follows:--\n\nTABLE 1.5.\n\nColumn 1: Plant.\nColumn 2: Number of Plants.\nColumn 3: Number of Umbels produced.\nColumn 4: Product of Seed.\n\nShort-styled :  6 : 24 : 1.3 grain weight of seed, or about 50 in number.\nLong-styled  : 18 : 74 : Not one seed.\n\nJudging from the exposed plants which grew all round in the same bed, and had\nbeen treated in the same manner, excepting that they had been exposed to the\nvisits of insects, the above six short-styled plants ought to have produced 92\ngrains' weight of seed instead of only 1.3; and the eighteen long-styled plants,\nwhich produced not one seed, ought to have produced above 200 grains' weight.\nThe production of a few seeds by the short-styled plants was probably due to the\naction of Thrips or of some other minute insect. It is scarcely necessary to\ngive any additional evidence, but I may add that ten pots of Polyanthuses and\ncowslips of both forms, protected from insects in my greenhouse, did not set one\npod, though artificially fertilised flowers in other pots produced an abundance.\nWe thus see that the visits of insects are absolutely necessary for the\nfertilisation of Primula veris. If the corolla of the long-styled form had\ndropped off, instead of remaining attached in a withered state to the ovarium,\nthe anthers attached to the lower part of the tube with some pollen still\nadhering to them would have been dragged over the stigma, and the flowers would\nhave been partially self-fertilised, as is the case with Primula Sinensis\nthrough this means. It is a rather curious fact that so trifling a difference as\nthe falling-off of the withered corolla, should make a very great difference in\nthe number of seeds produced by a plant if its flowers are not visited by\ninsects.\n\nThe flowers of the cowslip and of the other species of the genus secrete plenty\nof nectar; and I have often seen humble bees, especially B. hortorum and\nmuscorum, sucking the former in a proper manner, though they sometimes bite\nholes through the corolla. (1\/5. H. Muller has also seen Anthophora pilipes and\na Bombylius sucking the flowers. 'Nature' December 10, 1874 page 111.) No doubt\nmoths likewise visit the flowers, as one of my sons caught Cucullia verbasci in\nthe act. The pollen readily adheres to any thin object which is inserted into a\nflower. The anthers in the one form stand nearly, but not exactly, on a level\nwith the stigma of the other; for the distance between the anthers and stigma in\nthe short-styled form is greater than that in the long-styled, in the ratio of\n100 to 90. This difference is the result of the anthers in the long-styled form\nstanding rather higher in the tube than does the stigma in the short-styled, and\nthis favours their pollen being deposited on it. It follows from the position of\nthe organs that if the proboscis of a dead humble-bee, or a thick bristle or\nrough needle, be pushed down the corolla, first of one form and then of the\nother, as an insect would do in visiting the two forms growing mingled together,\npollen from the long-stamened form adheres round the base of the object, and is\nleft with certainty on the stigma of the long-styled form; whilst pollen from\nthe short stamens of the long-styled form adheres a little way above the\nextremity of the object, and some is generally left on the stigma of the other\nform. In accordance with this observation I found that the two kinds of pollen,\nwhich could easily be recognised under the microscope, adhered in this manner to\nthe proboscides of the two species of humble-bees and of the moth, which were\ncaught visiting the flowers; but some small grains were mingled with the larger\ngrains round the base of the proboscis, and conversely some large grains with\nthe small grains near the extremity of the proboscis. Thus pollen will be\nregularly carried from the one form to the other, and they will reciprocally\nfertilise one another. Nevertheless an insect in withdrawing its proboscis from\nthe corolla of the long-styled form cannot fail occasionally to leave pollen\nfrom the same flower on the stigma; and in this case there might be self-\nfertilisation. But this will be much more likely to occur with the short-styled\nform; for when I inserted a bristle or other such object into the corolla of\nthis form, and had, therefore, to pass it down between the anthers seated round\nthe mouth of the corolla, some pollen was almost invariably carried down and\nleft on the stigma. Minute insects, such as Thrips, which sometimes haunt the\nflowers, would likewise be apt to cause the self-fertilisation of both forms.\n\nThe several foregoing facts led me to try the effects of the two kinds of pollen\non the stigmas of the two forms. Four essentially different unions are possible;\nnamely, the fertilisation of the stigma of the long-styled form by its own-form\npollen, and by that of the short-styled; and the stigma of the short-styled form\nby its own-form pollen, and by that of the long-styled. The fertilisation of\neither form with pollen from the other form may be conveniently called a\nLEGITIMATE UNION, from reasons hereafter to be made clear; and that of either\nform with its own-form pollen an ILLEGITIMATE UNION. I formerly applied the term\n\"heteromorphic\" to the legitimate unions, and \"homomorphic\" to the illegitimate\nunions; but after discovering the existence of trimorphic plants, in which many\nmore unions are possible, these two terms ceased to be applicable. The\nillegitimate unions of both forms might have been tried in three ways; for a\nflower of either form may be fertilised with pollen from the same flower, or\nwith that from a another flower on the same plant, or with that from a distinct\nplant of the same form. But to make my experiments perfectly fair, and to avoid\nany evil result from self-fertilisation or too close interbreeding, I have\ninvariably employed pollen from a distinct plant of the same form for the\nillegitimate unions of all the species; and therefore it may be observed that I\nhave used the term \"own-form pollen\" in speaking of such unions. The several\nplants in all my experiments were treated in exactly the same manner, and were\ncarefully protected by fine nets from the access of insects, excepting Thrips,\nwhich it is impossible to exclude. I performed all the manipulations myself, and\nweighed the seeds in a chemical balance; but during many subsequent trials I\nfollowed the more accurate plan of counting the seeds. Some of the capsules\ncontained no seeds, or only two or three, and these are excluded in the column\nheaded \"good capsules\" in several of the following tables:--\n\nTABLE 1.6. Primula veris.\n\nColumn 1: Nature of the Union.\nColumn 2: Number of Flowers fertilised.\nColumn 3: Number of Capsules produced.\nColumn 4: Number of good Capsules.\nColumn 5: Weight of Seed in grains.\nColumn 6: Calculated Weight of Seed from 100 good Capsules.\n\nLong-styled by pollen of short-styled.

Primula veris.\n\nColumn 1: Nature of the Union.\nColumn 2: Number of Flowers fertilised.\nColumn 3: Number of Capsules.\nColumn 4: Number of good Capsules.\nColumn 5: Weight of Seed in grains.\n...\nColumn 6: Number of Capsules.\nColumn 7: Weight of Seed in grains.\n...\nColumn 8: Number of good Capsules.\nColumn 9: Weight of Seed in grains.\n\nThe two legitimate unions :\n100 : 77 : 71 : 39 :: 100 : 50 :: 100 : 54.\n\nThe two illegitimate unions :\n100 : 45 : 31 : 11 :: 100 : 24 :: 100 : 35.\n\nWe here see that the long-styled flowers fertilised with pollen from the short-\nstyled yield more capsules, especially good ones (i.e. containing more than one\nor two seeds), and that these capsules contain a greater proportional weight of\nseeds than do the flowers of the long-styled when fertilised with pollen from a\ndistinct plant of the same form. So it is with the short-styled flowers, if\ntreated in an analogous manner. Therefore I have called the former method of\nfertilisation a legitimate union, and the latter, as it fails to yield the full\ncomplement of capsules and seeds, an illegitimate union. These two kinds of\nunion are graphically represented in Figure 1.2.\n\n(FIGURE 1.2. Primula veris.\nGraphic representation of two kinds of union between:\nLeft: Long-styled form.\nRight: Short-styled form.)\n\nIf we consider the results of the two legitimate unions taken together and the\ntwo illegitimate ones, as shown in Table 1.7, we see that the former compared\nwith the latter yielded capsules, whether containing many seeds or only a few,\nin the proportion of 77 to 45, or as 100 to 58. But the inferiority of the\nillegitimate unions is here perhaps too great, for on a subsequent occasion 100\nlong-styled and short-styled flowers were illegitimately fertilised, and they\ntogether yielded 53 capsules: therefore the rate of 77 to 53, or as 100 to 69,\nis a fairer one than that of 100 to 58. Returning to Table 1.7, if we consider\nonly the good capsules, those from the two legitimate unions were to those from\nthe two illegitimate in number as 71 to 31, or as 100 to 44. Again, if we take\nan equal number of capsules, whether good or bad, from the legitimately and\nillegitimately fertilised flowers, we find that the former contained seeds by\nweight compared with the latter as 50 to 24, or as 100 to 48; but if all the\npoor capsules are rejected, of which many were produced by the illegitimately\nfertilised flowers, the proportion is 54 to 35, or as 100 to 65. In this and all\nother cases, the relative fertility of the two kinds of union can, I think, be\njudged of more truly by the average number of seeds per capsule than by the\nproportion of flowers which yield capsules. The two methods might have been\ncombined by giving the average number of seeds produced by all the flowers which\nwere fertilised, whether they yielded capsules or not; but I have thought that\nit would be more instructive always to show separately the proportion of flowers\nwhich produced capsules, and the average number of apparently good seeds which\nthe capsules contained.\n\nFlowers legitimately fertilised set seeds under conditions which cause the\nalmost complete failure of illegitimately fertilised flowers. Thus in the spring\nof 1862 forty flowers were fertilised at the same time in both ways. The plants\nwere accidentally exposed in the greenhouse to too hot a sun, and a large number\nof umbels perished. Some, however, remained in moderately good health, and on\nthese there were twelve flowers which had been fertilised legitimately, and\neleven which had been fertilised illegitimately. The twelve legitimate unions\nyielded seven fine capsules, containing on an average each 57.3 good seeds;\nwhilst the eleven illegitimate unions yielded only two capsules, of which one\ncontained 39 seeds, but so poor, that I do not suppose one would have\ngerminated, and the other contained 17 fairly good seeds.\n\nFrom the facts now given the superiority of a legitimate over an illegitimate\nunion admits of not the least doubt; and we have here a case to which no\nparallel exists in the vegetable or, indeed, in the animal kingdom. The\nindividual plants of the present species, and as we shall see of several other\nspecies of Primula, are divided into two sets or bodies, which cannot be called\ndistinct sexes, for both are hermaphrodites; yet they are to a certain extent\nsexually distinct, for they require reciprocal union for perfect fertility. As\nquadrupeds are divided into two nearly equal bodies of different sexes, so here\nwe have two bodies, approximately equal in number, differing in their sexual\npowers and related to each other like males and females. There are many\nhermaphrodite animals which cannot fertilise themselves, but most unite with\nanother hermaphrodite. So it is with numerous plants; for the pollen is often\nmature and shed, or is mechanically protruded, before the flower's own stigma is\nready; and such flowers absolutely require the presence of another hermaphrodite\nfor sexual union. But with the cowslip and various other species of Primula\nthere is this wide difference, that one individual, though it can fertilise\nitself imperfectly, must unite with another individual for full fertility; it\ncannot, however, unite with any other individual in the same manner as an\nhermaphrodite plant can unite with any other one of the same species; or as one\nsnail or earth-worm can unite with any other hermaphrodite individual. On the\ncontrary, an individual belonging to one form of the cowslip in order to be\nperfectly fertile must unite with one of the other form, just as a male\nquadruped must and can unite only with the female.\n\nI have spoken of the legitimate unions as being fully fertile; and I am fully\njustified in doing so, for flowers artificially fertilised in this manner\nyielded rather more seeds than plants naturally fertilised in a state of nature.\nThe excess may be attributed to the plants having been grown separately in good\nsoil. With respect to the illegitimate unions, we shall best appreciate their\ndegree of lessened fertility by the following facts. Gartner estimated the\nsterility of the unions between distinct species, in a manner which allows of a\nstrict comparison with the results of the legitimate and illegitimate unions of\nPrimula. (1\/6. 'Versuche uber die Bastarderzeugung' 1849 page 216.) With P.\nveris, for every 100 seeds yielded by the two legitimate unions, only 64 were\nyielded by an equal number of good capsules from the two illegitimate unions.\nWith P. Sinensis, as we shall hereafter see, the proportion was nearly the same-\n-namely, as 100 to 62. Now Gartner has shown that, on the calculation of\nVerbascum lychnitis yielding with its own pollen 100 seeds, it yielded when\nfertilised by the pollen of Verbascum Phoeniceum 90 seeds; by the pollen of\nVerbascum nigrum, 63 seeds; by that of Verbascum blattaria, 62 seeds. So again,\nDianthus barbatus fertilised by the pollen of D. superbus yielded 81 seeds, and\nby the pollen of D. japonicus 66 seeds, relatively to the 100 seeds produced by\nits own pollen. We thus see--and the fact is highly remarkable--that with\nPrimula the illegitimate unions relatively to the legitimate are more sterile\nthan crosses between distinct species of other genera relatively to their pure\nunions. Mr. Scott has given a still more striking illustration of the same fact:\nhe crossed Primula auricula with pollen of four other species (P. palinuri,\nviscosa, hirsuta, and verticillata), and these hybrid unions yielded a larger\naverage number of seeds than did P. auricula when fertilised illegitimately with\nits own-form pollen. (1\/7. 'Journal of the Linnean Society Botany' volume 8 1864\npage 93.)\n\nThe benefit which heterostyled dimorphic plants derive from the existence of the\ntwo forms is sufficiently obvious, namely, the intercrossing of distinct plants\nbeing thus ensured. (1\/8. I have shown in my work on the 'Effects of Cross and\nSelf-fertilisation' how greatly the offspring from intercrossed plants profit in\nheight, vigour, and fertility.) Nothing can be better adapted for this end than\nthe relative positions of the anthers and stigmas in the two forms, as shown in\nFigure 1.2; but to this whole subject I shall recur. No doubt pollen will\noccasionally be placed by insects or fall on the stigma of the same flower; and\nif cross-fertilisation fails, such self-fertilisation will be advantageous to\nthe plant, as it will thus be saved from complete barrenness. But the advantage\nis not so great as might at first be thought, for the seedlings from\nillegitimate unions do not generally consist of both forms, but all belong to\nthe parent form; they are, moreover, in some degree weakly in constitution, as\nwill be shown in a future chapter. If, however, a flower's own pollen should\nfirst be placed by insects or fall on the stigma, it by no means follows that\ncross-fertilisation will be thus prevented. It is well known that if pollen from\na distinct species be placed on the stigma of a plant, and some hours afterwards\nits own pollen be placed on it, the latter will be prepotent and will quite\nobliterate any effect from the foreign pollen; and there can hardly be a doubt\nthat with heterostyled dimorphic plants, pollen from the other form will\nobliterate the effects of pollen from the same form, even when this has been\nplaced on the stigma a considerable time before. To test this belief, I placed\non several stigmas of a long-styled cowslip plenty of pollen from the same\nplant, and after twenty-four hours added some from a short-styled dark-red\nPolyanthus, which is a variety of the cowslip. From the flowers thus treated 30\nseedlings were raised, and all these, without exception, bore reddish flowers;\nso that the effect of pollen from the same form, though placed on the stigmas\ntwenty-four hours previously, was quite destroyed by that of pollen from a plant\nbelonging to the other form.\n\nFinally, I may remark that of the four kinds of unions, that of the short-styled\nillegitimately fertilised with its own-form pollen seems to be the most sterile\nof all, as judged by the average number of seeds, which the capsules contained.\nA smaller proportion, also, of these seeds than of the others germinated, and\nthey germinated more slowly. The sterility of this union is the more remarkable,\nas it has already been shown that the short-styled plants yield a larger number\nof seeds than the long-styled, when both forms are fertilised, either naturally\nor artificially, in a legitimate manner.\n\nIn a future chapter, when I treat of the offspring from heterostyled dimorphic\nand trimorphic plants illegitimately fertilised with their own-form pollen, I\nshall have occasion to show that with the present species and several others,\nequal-styled varieties sometimes appear.\n\nPrimula elatior, Jacq.\nBardfield oxlip of English authors.\n\nThis plant, as well as the last or cowslip (P. veris, vel officinalis), and the\nprimrose (P. vulgaris, vel acaulis) have been considered by some botanists as\nvarieties of the same species. But they are all three undoubtedly distinct, as\nwill be shown in the next chapter. The present species resembles to a certain\nextent in general appearance the common oxlip, which is a hybrid between the\ncowslip and primrose. Primula elatior is found in England only in two or three\nof the eastern counties; and I was supplied with living plants by Mr. Doubleday,\nwho, as I believe, first called attention to its existence in England. It is\ncommon in some parts of the Continent; and H. Muller has seen several kinds of\nhumble-bees and other bees, and Bombylius, visiting the flowers in North\nGermany. (1\/9. 'Die Befruchtung der Blumen' page 347.)\n\nThe results of my trials on the relative fertility of the two forms, when\nlegitimately and illegitimately fertilised, are given in Table 1.8.\n\nTABLE 1.8. Primula elatior.\n\nColumn 1: Nature of the Union.\nColumn 2: Number of Flowers fertilised.\nColumn 3: Number of good Capsules produced.\nColumn 4: Maximum Number of Seeds in any one Capsule.\nColumn 5: Minimum Number of Seeds in any one Capsule.\nColumn 6: Average Number of Seeds per Capsule.\n\nLong-styled by pollen of short-styled.

If we\njudge of the relative fertility of the two kinds of unions by the average number\nof seeds per capsule, the ratio is as 100 to 75. But this latter number is\nprobably much too high, as many of the seeds produced by the illegitimately\nfertilised long-styled flowers were so small that they probably would not have\ngerminated, and ought not to have been counted. Several long-styled and short-\nstyled plants were protected from the access of insects, and must have been\nspontaneously self-fertilised. They yielded altogether only six capsules,\ncontaining any seeds; and their average number was only 7.8 per capsule. Some,\nmoreover, of these seeds were so small that they could hardly have germinated.\n\nHerr W. Breitenbach informs me that he examined, in two sites near the Lippe (a\ntributary of the Rhine), 894 flowers produced by 198 plants of this species; and\nhe found 467 of these flowers to be long-styled, 411 short-styled, and 16 equal-\nstyled. I have heard of no other instance with heterostyled plants of equal-\nstyled flowers appearing in a state of nature, though far from rare with plants\nwhich have been long cultivated. It is still more remarkable that in eighteen\ncases the same plant produced both long-styled and short-styled, or long-styled\nand equal-styled flowers; and in two out of the eighteen cases, long-styled,\nshort-styled, and equal-styled flowers. The long-styled flowers greatly\npreponderated on these eighteen plants,--61 consisting of this form, 15 of\nequal-styled, and 9 of the short-styled form.\n\nPrimula vulgaris (var. acaulis, Linn.)\nThe primrose of English Writers.\n\n(FIGURE 1.3. Outlines of pollen-grains of Primula vulgaris, distended with\nwater, much magnified and drawn under the camera lucida. The upper and smaller\ngrains from the long-styled form; the lower and larger grains from the short-\nstyled.)\n\nMr. J. Scott examined 100 plants growing near Edinburgh, and found 44 to be\nlong-styled, and 56 short-styled; and I took by chance 79 plants in Kent, of\nwhich 39 were long-styled and 40 short-styled; so that the two lots together\nconsisted of 83 long-styled and 96 short-styled plants. In the long-styled form\nthe pistil is to that of the short-styled in length, from an average of five\nmeasurements, as 100 to 51. The stigma in the long-styled form is conspicuously\nmore globose and much more papillose than in the short-styled, in which latter\nit is depressed on the summit; it is equally broad in the two forms. In both it\nstands nearly, but not exactly, on a level with the anthers of the opposite\nform; for it was found, from an average of 15 measurements, that the distance\nbetween the middle of the stigma and the middle of the anthers in the short-\nstyled form is to that in the long-styled as 100 to 93. The anthers do not\ndiffer in size in the two forms. The pollen-grains from the short-styled flowers\nbefore they were soaked in water were decidedly broader, in proportion to their\nlength, than those from the long-styled; after being soaked they were relatively\nto those from the long-styled as 100 to 71 in diameter, and more transparent. A\nlarge number of flowers from the two forms were compared, and 12 of the finest\nflowers from each lot were measured, but there was no sensible difference\nbetween them in size. Nine long-styled and eight short-styled plants growing\ntogether in a state of nature were marked, and their capsules collected after\nthey had been naturally fertilised; and the seeds from the short-styled weighed\nexactly twice as much as those from an equal number of long-styled plants. So\nthat the primrose resembles the cowslip in the short-styled plants, being the\nmore productive of the two forms. The results of my trials on the fertility of\nthe two forms, when legitimately and illegitimately fertilised, are given in\nTable 1.9.\n\nTABLE 1.9. Primula vulgaris.\n\nColumn 1: Nature of the Union.\nColumn 2: Number of Flowers fertilised.\nColumn 3: Number of good Capsules produced.\nColumn 4: Maximum Number of Seeds in any one Capsule.\nColumn 5: Minimum Number of Seeds in any one Capsule.\nColumn 6: Average Number of Seeds per Capsule.\n\nLong-styled by pollen of short-styled.

Illegitimate union :\n18 :  7 : 43 :  5 : 18.8 (This average is perhaps rather too low).\n\nSUMMARY:\n\nThe two legitimate unions together :\n20 : 18 : 77 : 47 : 66.0.\n\nThe two illegitimate unions together :\n39 : 21 : 66 :  5 : 35.5 (This average is perhaps rather too low).\n\nWe may infer from this table that the fertility of the two legitimate unions\ntaken together is to that of the two illegitimate unions together, as judged by\nthe proportional number of flowers which when fertilised in the two methods\nyielded capsules, as 100 to 60. If we judge by the average number of seeds per\ncapsule produced by the two kinds of unions, the ratio is as 100 to 54; but this\nlatter figure is perhaps rather too low. It is surprising how rarely insects can\nbe seen during the day visiting the flowers, but I have occasionally observed\nsmall kinds of bees at work; I suppose, therefore, that they are commonly\nfertilised by nocturnal Lepidoptera. The long-styled plants when protected from\ninsects yield a considerable number of capsules, and they thus differ remarkably\nfrom the same form of the cowslip, which is quite sterile under the same\ncircumstances. Twenty-three spontaneously self-fertilised capsules from this\nform contained, on an average, 19.2 seeds. The short-styled plants produced\nfewer spontaneously self-fertilised capsules, and fourteen of them contained\nonly 6.2 seeds per capsule. The self-fertilisation of both forms was probably\naided by Thrips, which abounded within the flowers; but these minute insects\ncould not have placed nearly sufficient pollen on the stigmas, as the\nspontaneously self-fertilised capsules contained much fewer seeds, on an\naverage, than those (as may be seen in Table 1.9.) which were artificially\nfertilised with their own-form pollen. But this difference may perhaps be\nattributed in part to the flowers in the table having been fertilised with\npollen from a distinct plant belonging to the same form; whilst those which were\nspontaneously self-fertilised no doubt generally received their own pollen. In a\nfuture part of this volume some observations will be given on the fertility of a\nred-coloured variety of the primrose.\n\nPrimula Sinensis.\n\nIn the long-styled form the pistil is about twice as long as that of the short-\nstyled, and the stamens differ in a corresponding, but reversed, manner. The\nstigma is considerably more elongated and rougher than that of the short-styled,\nwhich is smooth and almost spherical, being somewhat depressed on the summit;\nbut the stigma varies much in all its characters, the result, probably, of\ncultivation. The pollen-grains of the short-styled form, according to\nHildebrand, are 7 divisions of the micrometer in length and 5 in breadth;\nwhereas those of the long-styled are only 4 in length and 3 in breadth. (1\/10.\nAfter the appearance of my paper this author published some excellent\nobservations on the present species 'Botanische Zeitung' January 1, 1864, and he\nshows that I erred greatly about the size of the pollen-grains in the two forms.\nI suppose that by mistake I measured twice over pollen-grains from the same\nform.) The grains, therefore, of the short-styled are to those of the long-\nstyled in length as 100 to 57. Hildebrand also remarked, as I had done in the\ncase of P. veris, that the smaller grains from the long-styled are much more\ntransparent than the larger ones from the short-styled form. We shall hereafter\nsee that this cultivated plant varies much in its dimorphic condition and is\noften equal-styled. Some individuals may be said to be sub-heterostyled; thus in\ntwo white-flowered plants the pistil projected above the stamens, but in one of\nthem it was longer and had a more elongated and rougher stigma, than in the\nother; and the pollen-grains from the latter were to those from the plant with a\nmore elongated pistil only as 100 to 88 in diameter, instead of as 100 to 57.\nThe corolla of the long-styled and short-styled form differs in shape, in the\nsame manner as in P. veris. The long-styled plants tend to flower before the\nshort-styled. When both forms were legitimately fertilised, the capsules from\nthe short-styled plants contained, on an average, more seeds than those from the\nlong-styled, in the ratio of 12.2 to 9.3 by weight, that is, as 100 to 78. In\nTable 1.10 we have the results of two sets of experiments tried at different\nperiods.\n\nTABLE 1.10.

Judging by the average weight of seeds per\ncapsule produced by the two kinds of unions, the ratio is as 100 to 63. On\nanother occasion a large number of flowers of both forms were fertilised in the\nsame manner, but no account of their number was kept. The seeds, however, were\ncarefully counted, and the averages are shown in the right hand column. The\nratio for the number of seeds produced by the two legitimate compared with the\ntwo illegitimate unions is here 100 to 53, which is probably more accurate than\nthe foregoing one of 100 to 63.\n\nTABLE 1.11.

He counted the seeds.\n\nIt is remarkable that here all the flowers which were fertilised legitimately,\nas well as those fertilised illegitimately with pollen from a distinct plant\nbelonging to the same form, yielded capsules; and from this fact it might be\ninferred that the two forms were reciprocally much more fertile in his case than\nin mine. But his illegitimately fertilised capsules from both forms contained\nfewer seeds relatively to the legitimately fertilised capsules than in my\nexperiments; for the ratio in his case is as 42 to 100, instead of, as in mine,\nas 53 to 100. Fertility is a very variable element with most plants, being\ndetermined by the conditions to which they are subjected, of which fact I have\nobserved striking instances with the present species; and this may account for\nthe difference between my results and those of Hildebrand. His plants were kept\nin a room, and perhaps were grown in too small pots or under some other\nunfavourable conditions, for his capsules in almost every case contained a\nsmaller number of seeds than mine, as may be seen by comparing the right hand\ncolumns in Tables 1.10 and 1.11.\n\nThe most interesting point in Hildebrand's experiments is the difference in the\neffects of illegitimate fertilisation with a flower's own pollen, and with that\nfrom a distinct plant of the same form. In the latter case all the flowers\nproduced capsules, whilst only 67 out of 100 of those fertilised with their own\npollen produced capsules. The self-fertilised capsules also contained seeds, as\ncompared with capsules from flowers fertilised with pollen from a distinct plant\nof the same form, in the ratio of 72 to 100.\n\nIn order to ascertain how far the present species was spontaneously self-\nfertile, five long-styled plants were protected by me from insects; and they\nbore up to a given period 147 flowers which set 62 capsules; but many of these\nsoon fell off, showing that they had not been properly fertilised. At the same\ntime five short-styled plants were similarly treated, and they bore 116 flowers\nwhich ultimately produced only seven capsules. On another occasion 13 protected\nlong-styled plants yielded by weight 25.9 grains of spontaneously self-\nfertilised seeds. At the same time seven protected short-styled plants yielded\nonly half-a-grain weight of seeds. Therefore the long-styled plants yielded\nnearly 24 times as many spontaneously self-fertilised seeds as did the same\nnumber of short-styled plants. The chief cause of this great difference appears\nto be, that when the corolla of a long-styled plant falls off, the anthers, from\nbeing situated near the bottom of the tube are necessarily dragged over the\nstigma and leave pollen on it, as I saw when I hastened the fall of nearly\nwithered flowers; whereas in the short-styled flowers, the stamens are seated at\nthe mouth of the corolla, and in falling off do not brush over the lowly-seated\nstigmas. Hildebrand likewise protected some long-styled and short-styled plants,\nbut neither ever yielded a single capsule. He thinks that the difference in our\nresults may be accounted for by his plants having been kept in a room and never\nhaving been shaken; but this explanation seems to me doubtful; his plants were\nin a less fertile condition than mine, as shown by the difference in the number\nof seeds produced, and it is highly probable that their lessened fertility would\nhave interfered with especial force with their capacity for producing self-\nfertilised seeds.\n\n[Primula auricula. (1\/11. According to Kerner our garden auriculas are descended\nfrom P. pubescens, Jacq., which is a hybrid between the true P. auricula and\nhirsuta. This hybrid has now been propagated for about 300 years, and produces,\nwhen legitimately fertilised, a large number of seeds; the long-styled forms\nyielding an average number of 73, and the short-styled 98 seeds per capsule: see\nhis \"Geschichte der Aurikel\" 'Zeitschr. des Deutschen und Oest. Alpen-Vereins'\nBand 6 page 52. Also 'Die Primulaceen-Bastarten' 'Oest. Botanische Zeitschrift'\n1835 Numbers 3, 4 and 5.)\n\nThis species is heterostyled, like the preceding ones; but amongst the varieties\ndistributed by florists the long-styled form is rare, as it is not valued. There\nis a much greater relative inequality in the length of the pistil and stamens in\nthe two forms of the auricula than in the cowslip; the pistil in the long-styled\nbeing nearly four times as long as that in the short-styled, in which it is\nbarely longer than the ovarium. The stigma is nearly of the same shape in both\nforms, but is rougher in the long-styled, though the difference is not so great\nas between the two forms of the cowslip. In the long-styled plants the stamens\nare very short, rising but little above the ovarium. The pollen-grains of these\nshort stamens, when distended with water, were barely 5\/6000 of an inch in\ndiameter, whereas those from the long stamens of the short-styled plants were\nbarely 7\/6000, showing a relative difference of about 71 to 100. The smaller\ngrains of the long-styled plant are also much more transparent, and before\ndistention with water more triangular in outline than those of the other form.\nMr. Scott compared ten plants of both forms growing under similar conditions,\nand found that, although the long-styled plant produced more umbels and more\ncapsules than the short-styled, yet they yielded fewer seeds, in the ratio of 66\nto 100. (1\/12. 'Journal of the Linnean Society Botany' volume 8 1864 page 86.)\nThree short-styled plants were protected by me from the access of insects, and\nthey did not produce a single seed. Mr. Scott protected six plants of both\nforms, and found them excessively sterile. The pistil of the long-styled form\nstands so high above the anthers, that it is scarcely possible that pollen\nshould reach the stigma without some aid; and one of Mr. Scott's long-styled\nplants which yielded a few seeds (only 18 in number) was infested by aphides,\nand he does not doubt that these had imperfectly fertilised it.\n\nI tried a few experiments by reciprocally fertilising the two forms in the same\nmanner as before, but my plants were unhealthy, so I will give, in a condensed\nform, the results of Mr. Scott's experiments. For fuller particulars with\nrespect to this and the five following species, the paper lately referred to may\nbe consulted. In each case the fertility of the two legitimate unions, taken\ntogether, is compared with that of the two illegitimate unions together, by the\nsame two standards as before, namely, by the proportional number of flowers\nwhich produced good capsules, and by the average number of seeds per capsule.\nThe fertility of the legitimate unions is always taken at 100.\n\nBy the first standard, the fertility of the two legitimate unions of the\nauricula is to that of the two illegitimate unions as 100 to 80; and by the\nsecond standard as 100 to 15.\n\nPrimula Sikkimensis.\n\nAccording to Mr. Scott, the pistil of the long-styled form is fully four times\nas long as that of the short-styled, but their stigmas are nearly alike in shape\nand roughness. The stamens do not differ so much in relative length as the\npistils. The pollen-grains differ in a marked manner in the two forms; \"those of\nthe long-styled plants are sharply triquetrous, smaller, and more transparent\nthan those of the short-styled, which are of a bluntly triangular form.\" The\nfertility of the two legitimate unions to that of the two illegitimate unions is\nby the first standard as 100 to 95, and by the second standard as 100 to 31.\n\nPrimula cortusoides.\n\nThe pistil of the long-styled form is about thrice as long as that of the short-\nstyled, the stigma being double as long and covered with much longer papillae.\nThe pollen-grains of the short-styled form are, as usual, \"larger, less\ntransparent, and more bluntly triangular than those from the long-styled\nplants.\" The fertility of the two legitimate unions to that of the two\nillegitimate unions is by the first standard as 100 to 74, and by the second\nstandard as 100 to 66.\n\nPrimula involucrata.\n\nThe pistil of the long-styled form is about thrice as long as that of the short-\nstyled; the stigma of the former is globular and closely beset with papillae,\nwhilst that of the short-styled is smooth and depressed on the apex. The pollen-\ngrains of the two forms differ in size and transparency as before, but not in\nshape. The fertility of the two legitimate to that of the two illegitimate\nunions is by the first standard as 100 to 72; and by the second standard as 100\nto 47.\n\nPrimula farinosa.\n\nAccording to Mr. Scott, the pistil of the long-styled form is only about twice\nas long as that of the short-styled. The stigmas of the two forms differ but\nlittle in shape. The pollen-grains differ in the usual manner in size, but not\nin form. The fertility of the two legitimate to that of the two illegitimate\nunions is by the first standard as 100 to 71, and by the second standard as 100\nto 44.]\n\nSUMMARY ON THE FOREGOING HETEROSTYLED SPECIES OF PRIMULA.\n\nTABLE 1.12. Summary on the Fertility of the two Legitimate Unions, compared with\nthat of the two Illegitimate Unions, in the genus Primula. The former taken at\n100.\n\nColumn 1: Name of Species.\nColumn 2: Illegitimate Unions, Judged of by the Proportional Number of Flowers\nwhich produced Capsules.\nColumn 3: Illegitimate Unions, Judged of by the Average Number (or Weight in\nsome cases) of Seeds per Capsule.\n\nPrimula veris : 69 : 65.\n\nPrimula elatior : 27 : 75 (Probably too high).\n\nPrimula vulgaris : 60 : 54 (Perhaps too low).\n\nPrimula Sinensis : 84 : 63.\n\nPrimula Sinensis (second trial) : ? : 53.\nPrimula Sinensis (after Hildebrand) : 100 : 42.\n\nPrimula auricula (Scott) : 80 : 15.\n\nPrimula Sikkimensis (Scott): 95 : 31.\n\nPrimula cortusoides (Scott): 74 : 66.\n\nPrimula involucrata (Scott): 72 : 48.\n\nPrimula farinosa (Scott): 71 : 44.\n\nAverage of the nine species : 88.4 : 61.8.\n\nThe fertility of the long-and short-styled plants of the above species of\nPrimula, when the two forms are fertilised legitimately, and illegitimately with\npollen of the same form taken from a distinct plant, has now been given. The\nresults are seen in Table 1.12; the fertility being judged by two standards,\nnamely, by that of the proportional number of flowers which yielded capsules,\nand by that of the average number of seeds per capsule. But for full accuracy\nmany more observations, under varied conditions, would be requisite.\n\nWith plants of all kinds some flowers generally fail to produce capsules, from\nvarious accidental causes; but this source of error has been eliminated, as far\nas possible, in all the previous cases, by the manner in which the calculations\nhave been made. Supposing, for instance, that 20 flowers were fertilised\nlegitimately and yielded 18 capsules, and that 30 flowers were fertilised\nillegitimately and yielded 15 capsules, we may assume that on an average an\nequal proportion of the flowers in both lots would fail to produce capsules from\nvarious accidental causes; and the ratio of 18\/20 to 15\/30, or as 100 to 56 (in\nwhole numbers), would show the proportional number of capsules due to the two\nmethods of fertilisation; and the number 56 would appear in the left-hand column\nof Table 1.12, and in my other tables. With respect to the average number of\nseeds per capsule hardly anything need be said: supposing that the legitimately\nfertilised capsules contained, on an average, 50 seeds, and the illegitimately\nfertilised capsules 25 seeds; then as 50 is to 25 so is 100 to 50; and the\nlatter number would appear in the right hand column.\n\nIt is impossible to look at the above table and doubt that the legitimate unions\nbetween the two forms of the above nine species of Primula are much more fertile\nthan the illegitimate unions; although in the latter case pollen was always\ntaken from a distinct plant of the same form. There is, however, no close\ncorrespondence in the two rows of figures, which give, according to the two\nstandards, the difference of fertility between the legitimate and illegitimate\nunions. Thus all the flowers of P. Sinensis which were illegitimately fertilised\nby Hildebrand produced capsules; but these contained only 42 per cent of the\nnumber of seeds yielded by the legitimately fertilised capsules. So again, 95\nper cent of the illegitimately fertilised flowers of P. Sikkimensis produced\ncapsules; but these contained only 31 per cent of the number of seeds in the\nlegitimate capsules. On the other hand, with P. elatior only 27 per cent of the\nillegitimately fertilised flowers yielded capsules; but these contained nearly\n75 per cent of the legitimate number of seeds. It appears that the setting of\nthe flowers, that is, the production of capsules whether good or bad, is not so\nmuch influenced by legitimate and illegitimate fertilisation as is the number of\nseeds which the capsules contain. For, as may be seen at the bottom of Table\n1.12, 88.4 per cent of the illegitimately fertilised flowers yielded capsules;\nbut these contained only 61.8 per cent of seeds, in comparison, in each case,\nwith the legitimately fertilised flowers and capsules of the same species.\nThere is another point which deserves notice, namely, the relative degree of\ninfertility in the several species of the long-styled and short-styled flowers,\nwhen both are illegitimately fertilised. The data may be found in the earlier\ntables, and in those given by Mr. Scott in the Paper already referred to. If we\ncall the number of seeds per capsule produced by the illegitimately fertilised\nlong-styled flowers 100, the seeds from the illegitimately fertilised short-\nstyled flowers will be represented by the following numbers (Table 1.a.):--\n\nTABLE 1.a.\n\nPrimula veris : 71.\n\nPrimula elatior : 44 (Probably too low).\n\nPrimula vulgaris : 36 (Perhaps too low).\n\nPrimula Sinensis : 71.\n\nPrimula auricula : 119.\n\nPrimula Sikkimensis : 57.\n\nPrimula cortusoides : 93.\n\nPrimula involucrata : 74.\n\nPrimula farinosa : 63.\n\nWe thus see that, with the exception of P. auricula, the long-styled flowers of\nall nine species are more fertile than the short-styled flowers, when both forms\nare illegitimately fertilised. Whether P. auricula really differs from the other\nspecies in this respect I can form no opinion, as the result may have been\naccidental. The degree of self-fertility of a plant depends on two elements,\nnamely, on the stigma receiving its own pollen and on its more or less efficient\naction when placed there. Now as the anthers of the short-styled flowers of\nseveral species of Primula stand directly above the stigma, their pollen is more\nlikely to fall on it, or to be carried down to it by insects, than in the case\nof the long-styled form. It appears probable, therefore, at first sight, that\nthe lessened capacity of the short-styled flowers to be fertilised with their\nown pollen, is a special adaptation for counteracting their greater liability to\nreceive their own pollen, and thus for checking self-fertilisation. But from\nfacts with respect to other species hereafter to be given, this view can hardly\nbe admitted. In accordance with the above liability, when some of the species of\nPrimula were allowed to fertilise themselves spontaneously under a net, all\ninsects being excluded, except such minute ones as Thrips, the short-styled\nflowers, notwithstanding their greater innate self-sterility, yielded more seed\nthan did the long-styled. None of the species, however, when insects were\nexcluded, made a near approach to full fertility. But the long-styled form of P.\nSinensis gave, under these circumstances, a considerable number of seeds, as the\ncorolla in falling off drags the anthers, which are seated low down in the tube,\nover the stigma, and thus leaves plenty of pollen on it.\n\nHOMOSTYLED SPECIES OF PRIMULA.\n\nIt has now been shown that nine of the species in this genus exist under two\nforms, which differ not only in structure but in function. Besides these Mr.\nScott enumerates 27 other species which are heterostyled (1\/13. H. Muller has\ngiven in 'Nature' December 10, 1874 page 110, a drawing of one of these species,\nviz. The alpine P. villosa, and shows that it is fertilised exclusively by\nLepidoptera.); and to these probably others will be hereafter added.\nNevertheless, some species are homostyled; that is, they exist only under a\nsingle form; but much caution is necessary on this head, as several species when\ncultivated are apt to become equal-styled. Mr. Scott believes that P. Scotica,\nverticillata, a variety of Sibirica, elata, mollis, and longiflora, are truly\nhomostyled; and to these may be added, according to Axell, P. stricta. (1\/14.\nKoch was aware that this species was homostyled: see \"Treviranus uber Dichogamie\nnach Sprengel und Darwin\" 'Botanische Zeitung' January 2, 1863 page 4.) Mr.\nScott experimented on P. Scotica, mollis, and verticillata, and found that their\nflowers yielded an abundance of seeds when fertilised with their own pollen.\nThis shows that they are not heterostyled in function. P. Scotica is, however,\nonly moderately fertile when insects are excluded, but this depends merely on\nthe coherent pollen not readily falling on the stigma without their aid. Mr.\nScott also found that the capsules of P. verticillata contained rather more seed\nwhen the flowers were fertilised with pollen from a distinct plant than when\nwith their own pollen; and from this fact he infers that they are sub-\nheterostyled in function, though not in structure. But there is no evidence that\ntwo sets of individuals exist, which differ slightly in function and are adapted\nfor reciprocal fertilisation; and this is the essence of heterostylism. The mere\nfact of a plant being more fertile with pollen from a distinct individual than\nwith its own pollen, is common to very many species, as I have shown in my work\n'On the Effects of Cross and Self-fertilisation.'\n\nHottonia palustris.\n\nThis aquatic member of the Primulaceae is conspicuously heterostyled, as the\npistil of the long-styled form projects far out of the flower, the stamens being\nenclosed within the tube; whilst the stamens of the short-styled flower project\nfar outwards, the pistil being enclosed. This difference between the two forms\nhas attracted the attention of various botanists, and that of Sprengel, in 1793,\nwho, with his usual sagacity, adds that he does not believe the existence of the\ntwo forms to be accidental, though he cannot explain their purpose. (1\/15. 'Das\nentdeckte Geheimniss der Nature' page 103.) The pistil of the long-styled form\nis more than twice as long as that of the short-styled, with the stigma rather\nsmaller, though rougher. H. Muller gives figures of the stigmatic papillae of\nthe two forms, and those of the long-styled are seen to be more than double the\nlength, and much thicker than the papillae of the short-styled form. (1\/16. 'Die\nBefruchtung' etc. page 350.) The anthers in the one form do not stand exactly on\na level with the stigma in the other form; for the distance between the organs\nis greater in the short-styled than in the long-styled flowers in the proportion\nof 100 to 71. In dried specimens soaked in water the anthers of the short-styled\nform are larger than those of the long-styled, in the ratio of 100 to 83. The\npollen-grains, also, from the short-styled flowers are conspicuously larger than\nthose from the long-styled; the ratio between the diameters of the moistened\ngrains being as 100 to 64, according to my measurements, but according to the\nmeasurements of H. Muller as 100 to 61; and his are probably the more accurate\nof the two. The contents of the larger pollen-grains appear more coarsely\ngranular and of a browner tint, than those in the smaller grains. The two forms\nof Hottonia thus agree closely in most respects with those of the heterostyled\nspecies of Primula. The flowers of Hottonia are cross-fertilised, according to\nMuller, chiefly by Diptera.\n\nMr. Scott made a few trials on a short-styled plant, and found that the\nlegitimate unions were in all ways more fertile than the illegitimate (1\/17.\n'Journal of the Linnean Society Botany' volume 8 1864 page 79.); but since the\npublication of his paper H. Muller has made much fuller experiments, and I give\nhis results in Table 1.13, drawn up in accordance with my usual plan:--\n\nTABLE 1.13. Hottonia palustris (from H. Muller).\n\nColumn 1: Nature of the Union.\nColumn 2: Number of Capsules examined.\nColumn 3: Average Number of Seeds per Capsule.\n\nLong-styled by pollen of short-styled. Legitimate union:\n34 : 91.4.\n\nLong-styled by own-form pollen, from a distinct plant. Illegitimate union:\n18 : 77.5.\n\nShort-styled by pollen of long-styled. Legitimate union:\n30 : 66.2.\n\nShort-styled by own-form pollen, from a distinct plant. Illegitimate union:\n19 : 18.7.\n\nSUMMARY:\n\nThe two legitimate unions together:\n64 : 78.8.\n\nThe two illegitimate unions together:\n37 : 48.1.\n\nThe most remarkable point in this table is the small average number of seeds\nfrom the short-styled flowers when illegitimately fertilised, and the unusually\nlarge average number of seeds yielded by the illegitimately fertilised long-\nstyled flowers, relatively in both cases to the product of the legitimately\nfertilised flowers. (1\/18. H. Muller says 'Die Befruchtung' etc. page 352, that\nthe long-styled flowers, when illegitimately fertilised, yield as many seeds as\nwhen legitimately fertilised; but by adding up the number of seeds from all the\ncapsules produced by the two methods of fertilisation, as given by him, I arrive\nat the results shown in Table 1.13. The average number in the long-styled\ncapsules, when legitimately fertilised, is 91.4, and when illegitimately\nfertilised, 77.5; or as 100 to 85. H. Muller agrees with me that this is the\nproper manner of viewing the case.) The two legitimate unions compared with the\ntwo illegitimate together yield seeds in the ratio of 100 to 61.\n\nH. Muller also tried the effects of illegitimately fertilising the long-styled\nand short-styled flowers with their own pollen, instead of with that from\nanother plant of the same form; and the results are very striking. For the\ncapsules from the long-styled flowers thus treated contained, on an average,\nonly 15.7 seeds instead of 77.5; and those from the short-styled 6.5, instead of\n18.7 seeds per capsule. The number 6.5 agrees closely with Mr. Scott's result\nfrom the same form similarly fertilised.\n\nFrom some observations by Dr. Torrey, Hottonia inflata, an inhabitant of the\nUnited States, does not appear to be heterostyled, but is remarkable from\nproducing cleistogamic flowers, as will be seen in the last chapter of this\nvolume.\n\nBesides the genera Primula and Hottonia, Androsace (vel Gregoria, vel Aretia)\nvitalliana is heterostyled. Mr. Scott fertilised with their own pollen 21\nflowers on three short-styled plants in the Edinburgh Botanic Gardens, and not\none yielded a single seed; but eight of them which were fertilised with pollen\nfrom one of the other plants of the same form, set two empty capsules. (1\/19.\nSee also Treviranus in 'Botanische Zeitung' 1863 page 6 on this plant being\ndimorphic.) He was able to examine only dried specimens of the long-styled\nforms. But the evidence seems sufficient to leave hardly a doubt that Androsace\nis heterostyled. Fritz Muller sent me from South Brazil dried flowers of a\nStatice which he believed to be heterostyled. In the one form the pistil was\nconsiderably longer and the stamens slightly shorter than the corresponding\norgans in the other form. But as in the shorter-styled form the stigmas reached\nup to the anthers of the same flower, and as I could not detect in the dried\nspecimens of the two forms any difference in their stigmas, or in the size of\ntheir pollen-grains, I dare not rank this plant as heterostyled. From statements\nmade by Vaucher I was led to think that Soldanella alpina was heterostyled, but\nit is impossible that Kerner, who has closely studied this plant, could have\noverlooked the fact. So again from other statements it appeared probable that\nPyrola might be heterostyled, but H. Muller examined for me two species in North\nGermany, and found this not to be the case.\n\n\nCHAPTER II.\n\nHYBRID PRIMULAS.\n\nThe oxlip a hybrid naturally produced between Primula veris and vulgaris.\nThe differences in structure and function between the two parent-species.\nEffects of crossing long-styled and short-styled oxlips with one another and\nwith the two forms of both parent-species.\nCharacter of the offspring from oxlips artificially self-fertilised and cross-\nfertilised in a state of nature.\nPrimula elatior shown to be a distinct species.\nHybrids between other heterostyled species of Primula.\nSupplementary note on spontaneously produced hybrids in the genus Verbascum.\n\nThe various species of Primula have produced in a state of nature throughout\nEurope an extraordinary number of hybrid forms. For instance, Professor Kerner\nhas found no less than twenty-five such forms in the Alps. (2\/1. \"Die\nPrimulaceen-Bastarten\" 'Oesterr. Botanische Zeitschrift' Jahr 1875 Numbers 3, 4\nand 5. See also Godron on hybrid Primulas in 'Bull. Soc. Bot. de France' tome 10\n1853 page 178. Also in 'Revue des Sciences Nat.' 1875 page 331.) The frequent\noccurrence of hybrids in this genus no doubt has been favoured by most of the\nspecies being heterostyled, and consequently requiring cross-fertilisation by\ninsects; yet in some other genera, species which are not heterostyled and which\nin some respects appear not well adapted for hybrid-fertilisation, have likewise\nbeen largely hybridised. In certain districts of England, the common oxlip--a\nhybrid between the cowslip (P. veris, vel officinalis) and the primrose (P.\nvulgaris, vel acaulis)--is frequently found, and it occurs occasionally almost\neverywhere. Owing to the frequency of this intermediate hybrid form, and to the\nexistence of the Bardfield oxlip (P. elatior), which resembles to a certain\nextent the common oxlip, the claim of the three forms to rank as distinct\nspecies has been discussed oftener and at greater length than that of almost any\nother plant. Linnaeus considered P. veris, vulgaris and elatior to be varieties\nof the same species, as do some distinguished botanists at the present day;\nwhilst others who have carefully studied these plants do not doubt that they are\ndistinct species. The following observations prove, I think, that the latter\nview is correct; and they further show that the common oxlip is a hybrid between\nP. veris and vulgaris.\n\nThe cowslip differs so conspicuously in general appearance from the primrose,\nthat nothing need here be said with respect to their external characters. (2\/2.\nThe Reverend W.A. Leighton has pointed out certain differences in the form of\nthe capsules and seed in 'Annals and Magazine of Natural History' 2nd series\nvolume 2 1848 page 164.) But some less obvious differences deserve notice. As\nboth species are heterostyled, their complete fertilisation depends on insects.\nThe cowslip is habitually visited during the day by the larger humble-bees\n(namely Bombus muscorum and hortorum), and at night by moths, as I have seen in\nthe case of Cucullia. The primrose is never visited (and I speak after many\nyears' observation) by the larger humble-bees, and only rarely by the smaller\nkinds; hence its fertilisation must depend almost exclusively on moths. There is\nnothing in the structure of the flowers of the two plants which can determine\nthe visits of such widely different insects. But they emit a different odour,\nand perhaps their nectar may have a different taste. Both the long-styled and\nshort-styled forms of the primrose, when legitimately and naturally fertilised,\nyield on an average many more seeds per capsule than the cowslip, namely, in the\nproportion of 100 to 55. When illegitimately fertilised they are likewise more\nfertile than the two forms of the cowslip, as shown by the larger proportion of\ntheir flowers which set capsules, and by the larger average number of seeds\nwhich the capsules contain. The difference also between the number of seeds\nproduced by the long-styled and short-styled flowers of the primrose, when both\nare illegitimately fertilised, is greater than that between the number produced\nunder similar circumstances by the two forms of the cowslip. The long-styled\nflowers of the primrose when protected from the access of all insects, except\nsuch minute ones as Thrips, yield a considerable number of capsules containing\non an average 19.2 seeds per capsule; whereas 18 plants of the long-styled\ncowslip similarly treated did not yield a single seed.\n\nThe primrose, as every one knows, flowers a little earlier in the spring than\nthe cowslip, and inhabits slightly different stations and districts. The\nprimrose generally grows on banks or in woods, whilst the cowslip is found in\nmore open places. The geographical range of the two forms is different. Dr.\nBromfield remarks that \"the primrose is absent from all the interior region of\nnorthern Europe, where the cowslip is indigenous.\" (2\/3. 'Phytologist' volume 3\npage 694.) In Norway, however, both plants range to the same degree of north\nlatitude. (2\/4. H. Lecoq 'Geograph. Bot. de l'Europe' tome 8 1858 pages 141,\n144. See also 'Annals and Magazine of Natural History' 9 1842 pages 156, 515.\nAlso Boreau 'Flore du centre de la France' 1840 tome 2 page 376. With respect to\nthe rarity of P. veris in western Scotland, see H.C. Watson 'Cybele Britannica'\n2 page 293.)\n\nThe cowslip and primrose, when intercrossed, behave like distinct species, for\nthey are far from being mutually fertile. Gartner crossed 27 flowers of P.\nvulgaris with pollen of P. veris, and obtained 16 capsules; but these did not\ncontain any good seed. (2\/5. 'Bastarderzeugung' 1849 page 721.) He also crossed\n21 flowers of P. veris with pollen of P. vulgaris; and now he got only five\ncapsules, containing seed in a still less perfect condition. Gartner knew\nnothing about heterostylism; and his complete failure may perhaps be accounted\nfor by his having crossed together the same forms of the cowslip and primrose;\nfor such crosses would have been of an illegitimate as well as of a hybrid\nnature, and this would have increased their sterility. My trials were rather\nmore fortunate. Twenty-one flowers, consisting of both forms of the cowslip and\nprimrose, were intercrossed legitimately, and yielded seven capsules (i.e. 33\nper cent), containing on an average 42 seeds; some of these seeds, however, were\nso poor that they probably would not have germinated. Twenty-one flowers on the\nsame cowslip and primrose plants were also intercrossed illegitimately, and they\nlikewise yielded seven capsules (or 33 per cent), but these contained on an\naverage only 13 good and bad seeds. I should, however, state that some of the\nabove flowers of the primrose were fertilised with pollen from the polyanthus,\nwhich is certainly a variety of the cowslip, as may be inferred from the perfect\nfertility inter se of the crossed offspring from these two plants. (2\/6. Mr.\nScott has discussed the nature of the polyanthus ('Proceedings of the Linnean\nSociety' 8 Botany 1864 page 103), and arrives at a different conclusion; but I\ndo not think that his experiments were sufficiently numerous. The degree of\ninfertility of a cross is liable to much fluctuation. Pollen from the cowslip at\nfirst appears rather more efficient on the primrose than that of the polyanthus;\nfor 12 flowers of both forms of the primrose, fertilised legitimately and\nillegitimately with pollen of the cowslip gave five capsules, containing on an\naverage 32.4 seeds; whilst 18 flowers similarly fertilised by polyanthus-pollen\nyielded only five capsules, containing only 22.6 seeds. On the other hand, the\nseeds produced by the polyanthus-pollen were much the finest of the whole lot,\nand were the only ones which germinated.) To show how sterile these hybrid\nunions were I may remind the reader that 90 per cent of the flowers of the\nprimrose fertilised legitimately with primrose-pollen yielded capsules,\ncontaining on an average 66 seeds; and that 54 per cent of the flowers\nfertilised illegitimately yielded capsules containing on an average 35.5 seeds\nper capsule. The primrose, especially the short-styled form, when fertilised by\nthe cowslip, is less sterile, as Gartner likewise observed, than is the cowslip\nwhen fertilised by the primrose. The above experiments also show that a cross\nbetween the same forms of the primrose and cowslip is much more sterile than\nthat between different forms of these two species.\n\nThe seeds from the several foregoing crosses were sown, but none germinated\nexcept those from the short-styled primrose fertilised with pollen of the\npolyanthus; and these seeds were the finest of the whole lot. I thus raised six\nplants, and compared them with a group of wild oxlips which I had transplanted\ninto my garden. One of these wild oxlips produced slightly larger flowers than\nthe others, and this one was identical in every character (in foliage, flower-\npeduncle, and flowers) with my six plants, excepting that the flowers of the\nlatter were tinged of a dingy red colour, from being descended from the\npolyanthus.\n\nWe thus see that the cowslip and primrose cannot be crossed either way except\nwith considerable difficulty, that they differ conspicuously in external\nappearance, that they differ in various physiological characters, that they\ninhabit slightly different stations and range differently. Hence those botanists\nwho rank these plants as varieties ought to be able to prove that they are not\nas well fixed in character as are most species; and the evidence in favour of\nsuch instability of character appears at first sight very strong. It rests,\nfirst, on statements made by several competent observers that they have raised\ncowslips, primroses, and oxlips from seeds of the same plant; and, secondly, on\nthe frequent occurrence in a state of nature of plants presenting every\nintermediate gradation between the cowslip and primrose.\n\nThe first statement, however, is of little value; for, heterostylism not being\nformerly understood, the seed-bearing plants were in no instance protected from\nthe visits of insects (2\/7. One author states in the 'Phytologist' volume 3 page\n703 that he covered with bell-glasses some cowslips, primroses, etc., on which\nhe experimented. He specifies all the details of his experiment, but does not\nsay that he artificially fertilised his plants; yet he obtained an abundance of\nseed, which is simply impossible. Hence there must have been some strange error\nin these experiments, which may be passed over as valueless.); and there would\nbe almost as much risk of an isolated cowslip, or of several cowslips if\nconsisting of the same form, being crossed by a neighbouring primrose and\nproducing oxlips, as of one sex of a dioecious plant, under similar\ncircumstances, being crossed by the opposite sex of an allied and neighbouring\nspecies. Mr. H.C. Watson, a critical and most careful observer, made many\nexperiments by sowing the seeds of cowslips and of various kinds of oxlips, and\narrived at the following conclusion, namely, \"that seeds of a cowslip can\nproduce cowslips and oxlips, and that seeds of an oxlip can produce cowslips,\noxlips, and primroses.\" (2\/8. 'Phytologist' 2 pages 217, 852; 3 page 43.) This\nconclusion harmonises perfectly with the view that in all cases, when such\nresults have been obtained, the unprotected cowslips have been crossed by\nprimroses, and the unprotected oxlips by either cowslips or primroses; for in\nthis latter case we might expect, by the aid of reversion, which notoriously\ncomes into powerful action with hybrids, that the two parent-forms in appearance\npure, as well as many intermediate gradations, would be occasionally produced.\nNevertheless the two following statements offer considerable difficulty. The\nReverend Professor Henslow raised from seeds of a cowslip growing in his garden,\nvarious kinds of oxlips and one perfect primrose; but a statement in the same\npaper perhaps throws light on this anomalous result. (2\/9. Loudon's 'Magazine of\nNatural History' 3 1830 page 409.) Professor Henslow had previously transplanted\ninto his garden a cowslip, which completely changed its appearance during the\nfollowing year, and now resembled an oxlip. Next year again it changed its\ncharacter, and produced, in addition to the ordinary umbels, a few single-\nflowered scapes, bearing flowers somewhat smaller and more deeply coloured than\nthose of the common primrose. From what I have myself observed with oxlips, I\ncannot doubt that this plant was an oxlip in a highly variable condition, almost\nlike that of the famous Cytisus adami. This presumed oxlip was propagated by\noffsets, which were planted in different parts of the garden; and if Professor\nHenslow took by mistake seeds from one of these plants, especially if it had\nbeen crossed by a primrose, the result would be quite intelligible. Another case\nis still more difficult to understand: Dr. Herbert raised, from the seeds of a\nhighly cultivated red cowslip, cowslips, oxlips of various kinds, and a\nprimrose. (2\/10. 'Transactions of the Horticultural Society' 4 page 19.) This\ncase, if accurately recorded, which I much doubt, is explicable only on the\nimprobable assumption that the red cowslip was not of pure parentage. With\nspecies and varieties of many kinds, when intercrossed, one is sometimes\nstrongly prepotent over the other; and instances are known of a variety crossed\nby another, producing offspring which in certain characters, as in colour,\nhairiness, etc., have proved identical with the pollen-bearing parent, and quite\ndissimilar to the mother-plant (2\/11. I have given instances in my work 'On the\nVariation of Animals and Plants under Domestication' chapter 15 2nd edition\nvolume 2 page 69.); but I do not know of any instance of the offspring of a\ncross perfectly resembling, in a considerable number of important characters,\nthe father alone. It is, therefore, very improbable that a pure cowslip crossed\nby a primrose should ever produce a primrose in appearance pure. Although the\nfacts given by Dr. Herbert and Professor Henslow are difficult to explain, yet\nuntil it can be shown that a cowslip or a primrose, carefully protected from\ninsects, will give birth to at least oxlips, the cases hitherto recorded have\nlittle weight in leading us to admit that the cowslip and primrose are varieties\nof one and the same species.\n\nNegative evidence is of little value; but the following facts may be worth\ngiving:--Some cowslips which had been transplanted from the fields into a\nshrubbery were again transplanted into highly manured land. In the following\nyear they were protected from insects, artificially fertilised, and the seed\nthus procured was sown in a hotbed. The young plants were afterwards planted\nout, some in very rich soil, some in stiff poor clay, some in old peat, and some\nin pots in the greenhouse; so that these plants, 765 in number, as well as their\nparents, were subjected to diversified and unnatural treatment; but not one of\nthem presented the least variation except in size--those in the peat attaining\nalmost gigantic dimensions, and those in the clay being much dwarfed.\n\nI do not, of course, doubt that cowslips exposed during SEVERAL successive\ngenerations to changed conditions would vary, and that this might occasionally\noccur in a state of nature. Moreover, from the law of analogical variation, the\nvarieties of any one species of Primula would probably in some cases resemble\nother species of the genus. For instance I raised a red primrose from seed from\na protected plant, and the flowers, though still resembling those of the\nprimrose, were borne during one season in umbels on a long foot-stalk like that\nof a cowslip.\n\nWith regard to the second class of facts in support of the cowslip and primrose\nbeing ranked as mere varieties, namely, the well-ascertained existence in a\nstate of nature of numerous linking forms (2\/12. See an excellent article on\nthis subject by Mr. H.C. Watson in the 'Phytologist' volume 3 page 43.):--If it\ncan be shown that the common wild oxlip, which is intermediate in character\nbetween the cowslip and primrose, resembles in sterility and other essential\nrespects a hybrid plant, and if it can further be shown that the oxlip, though\nin a high degree sterile, can be fertilised by either parent-species, thus\ngiving rise to still finer gradational links, then the presence of such linking\nforms in a state of nature ceases to be an argument of any weight in favour of\nthe cowslip and primrose being varieties, and becomes, in fact, an argument on\nthe other side. The hybrid origin of a plant in a state of nature can be\nrecognised by four tests: first, by its occurrence only where both presumed\nparent-species exist or have recently existed; and this holds good, as far as I\ncan discover, with the oxlip; but the P. elatior of Jacq., which, as we shall\npresently see, constitutes a distinct species, must not be confounded with the\ncommon oxlip. Secondly, by the supposed hybrid plant being nearly intermediate\nin character between the two parent-species, and especially by its resembling\nhybrids artificially made between the same two species. Now the oxlip is\nintermediate in character, and resembles in every respect, except in the colour\nof the corolla, hybrids artificially produced between the primrose and the\npolyanthus, which latter is a variety of the cowslip. Thirdly, by the supposed\nhybrids being more or less sterile when crossed inter se: but to try this fairly\ntwo distinct plants of the same parentage, and not two flowers on the same\nplant, should be crossed; for many pure species are more or less sterile with\npollen from the same individual plant; and in the case of hybrids from\nheterostyled species the opposite forms should be crossed. Fourthly and lastly,\nby the supposed hybrids being much more fertile when crossed with either pure\nparent-species than when crossed inter se, but still not as fully fertile as the\nparent-species.\n\nFor the sake of ascertaining the two latter points, I transplanted a group of\nwild oxlips into my garden. They consisted of one long-styled and three short-\nstyled plants, which, except in the corolla of one being slightly larger,\nresembled each other closely. The trials which were made, and the results\nobtained, are shown in tables 2.14, 2.15, 2.16, 2.17 and 2.18. No less than\ntwenty different crosses are necessary in order to ascertain fully the fertility\nof hybrid heterostyled plants, both inter se and with their two parent-species.\nIn this instance 256 flowers were crossed in the course of four seasons. I may\nmention, as a mere curiosity, that if any one were to raise hybrids between two\ntrimorphic heterostyled species, he would have to make 90 distinct unions in\norder to ascertain their fertility in all ways; and as he would have to try at\nleast 10 flowers in each case, he would be compelled to fertilise 900 flowers\nand count their seeds. This would probably exhaust the patience of the most\npatient man.\n\nTABLE 2.14.

Average 48.7.\n\nWe see in Tables 2\/14 to 2\/18 the number of capsules and of seeds produced, by\ncrossing both forms of the oxlip in a legitimate and illegitimate manner with\none another, and with the two forms of the primrose and cowslip. I may premise\nthat the pollen of two of the short-styled oxlips consisted of nothing but\nminute aborted whitish cells; but in the third short-styled plant about one-\nfifth of the grains appeared in a sound condition. Hence it is not surprising\nthat neither the short-styled nor the long-styled oxlip produced a single seed\nwhen fertilised with this pollen. Nor did the pure cowslips or primroses when\nillegitimately fertilised with it; but when thus legitimately fertilised they\nyielded a few good seeds. The female organs of the short-styled oxlips, though\ngreatly deteriorated in power, were in a rather better condition than the male\norgans; for though the short-styled oxlips yielded no seed when fertilised by\nthe long-styled oxlips, and hardly any when illegitimately fertilised by pure\ncowslips or primroses, yet when legitimately fertilised by these latter species,\nespecially by the long-styled primrose, they yielded a moderate supply of good\nseed.\n\nThe long-styled oxlip was more fertile than the three short-styled oxlips, and\nabout half its pollen-grains appeared sound. It bore no seed when legitimately\nfertilised by the short-styled oxlips; but this no doubt was due to the badness\nof the pollen of the latter; for when illegitimately fertilised (Table 2.14) by\nits own pollen it produced some good seeds, though much fewer than self-\nfertilised cowslips or primroses would have produced. The long-styled oxlip\nlikewise yielded a very low average of seed, as may be seen in the third\ncompartment of Tables 2.15 to 2.18, when illegitimately fertilised by, and when\nillegitimately fertilising, pure cowslips and primroses. The four corresponding\nlegitimate unions, however, were moderately fertile, and one (namely that\nbetween a short-styled cowslip and the long-styled oxlip in Table 2.17) was\nnearly as fertile as if both parents had been pure. A short-styled primrose\nlegitimately fertilised by the long-styled oxlip (Table 2.18) also yielded a\nmoderately good average, namely 48.7 seeds; but if this short-styled primrose\nhad been fertilised by a long-styled primrose it would have yielded an average\nof 65 seeds. If we take the ten legitimate unions together, and the ten\nillegitimate unions together, we shall find that 29 per cent of the flowers\nfertilised in a legitimate manner yielded capsules, these containing on an\naverage 27.4 good and bad seeds; whilst only 15 per cent of the flowers\nfertilised in an illegitimate manner yielded capsules, these containing on an\naverage only 11.0 good and bad seeds.\n\nIn a previous part of this chapter it was shown that illegitimate crosses\nbetween the long-styled form of the primrose and the long-styled cowslip, and\nbetween the short-styled primrose and short-styled cowslip, are more sterile\nthan legitimate crosses between these two species; and we now see that the same\nrule holds good almost invariably with their hybrid offspring, whether these are\ncrossed inter se, or with either parent-species; so that in this particular\ncase, but not as we shall presently see in other cases, the same rule prevails\nwith the pure unions between the two forms of the same heterostyled species,\nwith crosses between two distinct heterostyled species, and with their hybrid\noffspring.\n\nSeeds from the long-styled oxlip fertilised by its own pollen were sown, and\nthree long-styled plants raised. The first of these was identical in every\ncharacter with its parent. The second bore rather smaller flowers, of a paler\ncolour, almost like those of the primrose; the scapes were at first single-\nflowered, but later in the season a tall thick scape, bearing many flowers, like\nthat of the parent oxlip, was thrown up. The third plant likewise produced at\nfirst only single-flowered scapes, with the flowers rather small and of a darker\nyellow; but it perished early. The second plant also died in September; and the\nfirst plant, though all three grew under very favourable conditions, looked very\nsickly. Hence we may infer that seedlings from self-fertilised oxlips would\nhardly be able to exist in a state of nature. I was surprised to find that all\nthe pollen-grains in the first of these seedling oxlips appeared sound; and in\nthe second only a moderate number were bad. These two plants, however, had not\nthe power of producing a proper number of seeds; for though left uncovered and\nsurrounded by pure primroses and cowslips, the capsules were estimated to\ninclude an average of only from fifteen to twenty seeds.\n\nFrom having many experiments in hand, I did not sow the seed obtained by\ncrossing both forms of the primrose and cowslip with both forms of the oxlip,\nwhich I now regret; but I ascertained an interesting point, namely, the\ncharacter of the offspring from oxlips growing in a state of nature near both\nprimroses and cowslips. The oxlips were the same plants which, after their seeds\nhad been collected, were transplanted and experimented on. From the seeds thus\nobtained eight plants were raised, which, when they flowered, might have been\nmistaken for pure primroses; but on close comparison the eye in the centre of\nthe corolla was seen to be of a darker yellow, and the peduncles more elongated.\nAs the season advanced, one of these plants threw up two naked scapes, 7 inches\nin height, which bore umbels of flowers of the same character as before. This\nfact led me to examine the other plants after they had flowered and were dug up;\nand I found that the flower-peduncles of all sprung from an extremely short\ncommon scape, of which no trace can be found in the pure primrose. Hence these\nplants are beautifully intermediate between the oxlip and the primrose,\ninclining rather towards the latter; and we may safely conclude that the parent\noxlips had been fertilised by the surrounding primroses.\n\nFrom the various facts now given, there can be no doubt that the common oxlip is\na hybrid between the cowslip (P. veris, Brit. Fl.) and the primrose (P.\nvulgaris, Brit. Fl.), as has been surmised by several botanists. It is probable\nthat oxlips may be produced either from the cowslip or the primrose as the seed-\nbearer, but oftenest from the latter, as I judge from the nature of the stations\nin which oxlips are generally found (2\/13. See also on this head Hardwicke's\n'Science Gossip' 1867 pages 114, 137.), and from the primrose when crossed by\nthe cowslip being more fertile than, conversely, the cowslip by the primrose.\nThe hybrids themselves are also rather more fertile when crossed with the\nprimrose than with the cowslip. Whichever may be the seed-bearing plant, the\ncross is probably between different forms of the two species; for we have seen\nthat legitimate hybrid unions are more fertile than illegitimate hybrid unions.\nMoreover a friend in Surrey found that 29 oxlips which grew in the neighbourhood\nof his house consisted of 13 long-styled and 16 short-styled plants; now, if the\nparent-plants had been illegitimately united, either the long- or short-styled\nform would have greatly preponderated, as we shall hereafter see good reason to\nbelieve. The case of the oxlip is interesting; for hardly any other instance is\nknown of a hybrid spontaneously arising in such large numbers over so wide an\nextent of country. The common oxlip (not the P. elatior of Jacq.) is found\nalmost everywhere throughout England, where both cowslips and primroses grow. In\nsome districts, as I have seen near Hartfield in Sussex and in parts of Surrey,\nspecimens may be found on the borders of almost every field and small wood. In\nother districts the oxlip is comparatively rare: near my own residence I have\nfound, during the last twenty-five years, not more than five or six plants or\ngroups of plants. It is difficult to conjecture what is the cause of this\ndifference in their number. It is almost necessary that a plant, or several\nplants belonging to the same form, of one parent-species, should grow near the\nopposite form of the other parent-species; and it is further necessary that both\nspecies should be frequented by the same kind of insect, no doubt a moth. The\ncause of the rare appearance of the oxlip in certain districts may be the rarity\nof some moth, which in other districts habitually visits both the primrose and\ncowslip.\n\nFinally, as the cowslip and primrose differ in the various characters above\nspecified,--as they are in a high degree sterile when intercrossed,--as there is\nno trustworthy evidence that either species, when uncrossed, has ever given\nbirth to the other species or to any intermediate form,--and as the intermediate\nforms which are often found in a state of nature have been shown to be more or\nless sterile hybrids of the first or second generation,--we must for the future\nlook at the cowslip and primrose as good and true species.\n\nPrimula elatior, Jacq., or the Bardfield Oxlip, is found in England only in two\nor three of the eastern counties. On the Continent it has a somewhat different\nrange from that of the cowslip and primrose; and it inhabits some districts\nwhere neither of these species live. (2\/14. For England, see Hewett C. Watson\n'Cybele Britannica' volume 2 1849 page 292. For the Continent, see Lecoq\n'Geograph. Botanique de l'Europe' tome 8 1858 page 142. For the Alps see 'Annals\nand Magazine of Natural History' volume 9 1842 pages 156 and 515.) In general\nappearance it differs so much from the common oxlip, that no one accustomed to\nsee both forms in the living state could afterwards confound them; but there is\nscarcely more than a single character by which they can be distinctly defined,\nnamely, their linear-oblong capsules equalling the calyx in length. (2\/15.\nBabington 'Manual of British Botany' 1851 page 258.) The capsules when mature\ndiffer conspicuously, owing to their length, from those of the cowslip and\nprimrose. With respect to the fertility of the two forms when these are united\nin the four possible methods, they behave like the other heterostyled species of\nthe genus, but differ somewhat (see Tables 1.8 and 1.12.) in the smaller\nproportion of the illegitimately fertilised flowers which set capsules. That P.\nelatior is not a hybrid is certain, for when the two forms were legitimately\nunited they yielded the large average of 47.1 seeds, and when illegitimately\nunited 35.5 per capsule; whereas, of the four possible unions (Table 2.14)\nbetween the two forms of the common oxlip which we know to be a hybrid, one\nalone yielded any seed; and in this case the average number was only 11.6 per\ncapsule. Moreover I could not detect a single bad pollen-grain in the anthers of\nthe short-styled P. elatior; whilst in two short-styled plants of the common\noxlip all the grains were bad, as were a large majority in a third plant. As the\ncommon oxlip is a hybrid between the primrose and cowslip, it is not surprising\nthat eight long-styled flowers of the primrose, fertilised by pollen from the\nlong-styled common oxlip, produced eight capsules (Table 1.18), containing,\nhowever, only a low average of seeds; whilst the same number of flowers of the\nprimrose, similarly fertilised by the long-styled Bardfield oxlip, produced only\na single capsule; this latter plant being an altogether distinct species from\nthe primrose. Plants of P. elatior have been propagated by seed in a garden for\ntwenty-five years, and have kept all this time quite constant, excepting that in\nsome cases the flowers varied a little in size and tint. (2\/16. See Mr. H.\nDoubleday in the 'Gardener's Chronicle' 1867 page 435, also Mr. W. Marshall\nibid. page 462.) Nevertheless, according to Mr. H.C. Watson and Dr. Bromfield\n(2\/17. 'Phytologist' volume 1 page 1001 and volume 3 page 695.), plants may be\noccasionally found in a state of nature, in which most of the characters by\nwhich this species can be distinguished from P. veris and vulgaris fail; but\nsuch intermediate forms are probably due to hybridisation; for Kerner states, in\nthe paper before referred to, that hybrids sometimes, though rarely, arise in\nthe Alps between P. elatior and veris.\n\nFinally, although we may freely admit that Primula veris, vulgaris, and elatior,\nas well as all the other species of the genus, are descended from a common\nprimordial form, yet from the facts above given, we must conclude that these\nthree forms are now as fixed in character as are many others which are\nuniversally ranked as true species. Consequently they have as good a right to\nreceive distinct specific names as have, for instance, the ass, quagga, and\nzebra.\n\nMr. Scott has arrived at some interesting results by crossing other heterostyled\nspecies of Primula. (2\/18. 'Journal of the Linnean Society Botany' volume 8 1864\npage 93 to end.) I have already alluded to his statement, that in four instances\n(not to mention others) a species when crossed with a distinct one yielded a\nlarger number of seeds than the same species fertilised illegitimately with its\nown-form pollen, though taken from a distinct plant. It has long been known from\nthe researches of Kolreuter and Gartner, that two species when crossed\nreciprocally sometimes differ as widely as is possible in their fertility: thus\nA when crossed with the pollen of B will yield a large number of seeds, whilst B\nmay be crossed repeatedly with pollen of A, and will never yield a single seed.\nNow Mr. Scott shows in several cases that the same law holds good when two\nheterostyled species of Primula are intercrossed, or when one is crossed with a\nhomostyled species. But the results are much more complicated than with ordinary\nplants, as two heterostyled dimorphic species can be intercrossed in eight\ndifferent ways. I will give one instance from Mr. Scott. The long-styled P.\nhirsuta fertilised legitimately and illegitimately with pollen from the two\nforms of P. auricula, and reciprocally the long-styled P. auricula fertilised\nlegitimately and illegitimately with pollen from the two forms of P. hirsuta,\ndid not produce a single seed. Nor did the short-styled P. hirsuta when\nfertilised legitimately and illegitimately with the pollen of the two forms of\nP. auricula. On the other hand, the short-styled P. auricula fertilised with\npollen from the long-styled P. hirsuta yielded capsules containing on an average\nno less than 56 seeds; and the short-styled P. auricula by pollen of the short-\nstyled P. hirsuta yielded capsules containing on an average 42 seeds per\ncapsule. So that out of the eight possible unions between the two forms of these\ntwo species, six were utterly barren, and two fairly fertile. We have seen also\nthe same sort of extraordinary irregularity in the results of my twenty\ndifferent crosses (Tables 2.14 to 2.18), between the two forms of the oxlip,\nprimrose, and cowslip. Mr. Scott remarks, with respect to the results of his\ntrials, that they are very surprising, as they show us that \"the sexual forms of\na species manifest in their respective powers for conjunction with those of\nanother species, physiological peculiarities which might well entitle them, by\nthe criterion of fertility, to specific distinction.\"\n\nFinally, although P. veris and vulgaris, when crossed legitimately, and\nespecially when their hybrid offspring are crossed in this manner with both\nparent-species, were decidedly more fertile, than when crossed in an\nillegitimate manner, and although the legitimate cross effected by Mr. Scott\nbetween P. auricula and hirsuta was more fertile, in the ratio of 56 to 42, than\nthe illegitimate cross, nevertheless it is very doubtful, from the extreme\nirregularity of the results in the various other hybrid crosses made by Mr.\nScott, whether it can be predicted that two heterostyled species are generally\nmore fertile if crossed legitimately (i.e. when opposite forms are united) than\nwhen crossed illegitimately.\n\nSUPPLEMENTARY NOTE ON SOME WILD HYBRID VERBASCUMS.\n\nIn an early part of this chapter I remarked that few other instances could be\ngiven of a hybrid spontaneously arising in such large numbers, and over so wide\nan extent of country, as that of the common oxlip; but perhaps the number of\nwell-ascertained cases of naturally produced hybrid willows is equally great.\n(2\/19. Max Wichura 'Die Bastardbefruchtung etc. der Weiden' 1865.) Numerous\nspontaneous hybrids between several species of Cistus, found near Narbonne, have\nbeen carefully described by M. Timbal-Lagrave (2\/20. 'Mem. de l'Acad. des\nSciences de Toulouse' 5e serie tome 5 page 28.), and many hybrids between an\nAceras and Orchis have been observed by Dr. Weddell. (2\/21. 'Annales des Sc.\nNat.' 3e serie Bot. tome 18 page 6.) In the genus Verbascum, hybrids are\nsupposed to have often originated in a state of nature (2\/22. See for instance\nthe 'English Flora' by Sir J.E. Smith 1824 volume 1 page 307.); some of these\nundoubtedly are hybrids, and several hybrids have originated in gardens; but\nmost of these cases require, as Gartner remarks, verification. (2\/23. See\nGartner 'Bastarderzeugung' 1849 page 590.) Hence the following case is worth\nrecording, more especially as the two species in question, V. thapsus and\nlychnitis, are perfectly fertile when insects are excluded, showing that the\nstigma of each flower receives its own pollen. Moreover the flowers offer only\npollen to insects, and have not been rendered attractive to them by secreting\nnectar.\n\nI transplanted a young wild plant into my garden for experimental purposes, and\nwhen it flowered it plainly differed from the two species just mentioned and\nfrom a third which grows in this neighbourhood. I thought that it was a strange\nvariety of V. thapsus. It attained the height (by measurement) of 8 feet! It was\ncovered with a net, and ten flowers were fertilised with pollen from the same\nplant; later in the season, when uncovered, the flowers were freely visited by\npollen-collecting bees; nevertheless, although many capsules were produced, not\none contained a single seed. During the following year this same plant was left\nuncovered near plants of V. thapsus and lychnitis; but again it did not produce\na single seed. Four flowers, however, which were repeatedly fertilised with\npollen of V. lychnitis, whilst the plant was temporarily kept under a net,\nproduced four capsules, which contained five, one, two, and two seeds; at the\nsame time three flowers were fertilised with pollen of V. thapsus, and these\nproduced two, two, and three seeds. To show how unproductive these seven\ncapsules were, I may state that a fine capsule from a plant of V. thapsus\ngrowing close by contained above 700 seeds. These facts led me to search the\nmoderately-sized field whence my plant had been removed, and I found in it many\nplants of V. thapsus and lychnitis as well as thirty-three plants intermediate\nin character between these two species. These thirty-three plants differed much\nfrom one another. In the branching of the stem they more closely resembled V.\nlychnitis than V. thapsus, but in height the latter species. In the shape of\ntheir leaves they often closely approached V. lychnitis, but some had leaves\nextremely woolly on the upper surface and decurrent like those of V. thapsus;\nyet the degree of woolliness and of decurrency did not always go together. In\nthe petals being flat and remaining open, and in the manner in which the anthers\nof the longer stamens were attached to the filaments, these plants all took more\nafter V. lychnitis than V. thapsus. In the yellow colour of the corolla they all\nresembled the latter species. On the whole, these plants appeared to take rather\nmore after V. lychnitis than V. thapsus. On the supposition that they were\nhybrids, it is not an anomalous circumstance that they should all have produced\nyellow flowers; for Gartner crossed white and yellow-flowered varieties of\nVerbascum, and the offspring thus produced never bore flowers of an intermediate\ntint, but either pure white or pure yellow flowers, generally of the latter\ncolour. (2\/24. 'Bastardzeugung' page 307.)\n\nMy observations were made in the autumn; so that I was able to collect some\nhalf-matured capsules from twenty of the thirty-three intermediate plants, and\nlikewise capsules of the pure V. lychnitis and thapsus growing in the same\nfield. All the latter were filled with perfect but immature seeds, whilst the\ncapsules of the twenty intermediate plants did not contain one single perfect\nseed. These plants, consequently, were absolutely barren. From this fact,--from\nthe one plant which was transplanted into my garden yielding when artificially\nfertilised with pollen from V. lychnitis and thapsus some seeds, though\nextremely few in number,--from the circumstance of the two pure species growing\nin the same field,--and from the intermediate character of the sterile plants,\nthere can be no doubt that they were hybrids. Judging from the position in which\nthey were chiefly found, I am inclined to believe they were descended from V.\nthapsus as the seed-bearer, and V. lychnitis as the pollen-bearer.\n\nIt is known that many species of Verbascum, when the stem is jarred or struck by\na stick, cast off their flowers. (2\/25. This was first observed by Correa de\nSerra: see Sir J.E. Smith's 'English Flora' 1824 volume 1 page 311; also 'Life\nof Sir J.E. Smith' volume 2 page 210. I was guided to these references by the\nReverend W.A. Leighton, who observed this same phenomenon with V. virgatum.)\nThis occurs with V. thapsus, as I have repeatedly observed. The corolla first\nseparates from its attachment, and then the sepals spontaneously bend inwards so\nas to clasp the ovarium, pushing off the corolla by their movement, in the\ncourse of two or three minutes. Nothing of this kind takes place with young\nbarely expanded flowers. With Verbascum lychnitis and, as I believe, V.\nphoeniceum the corolla is not cast off, however often and severely the stem may\nbe struck. In this curious property the above-described hybrids took after V.\nthapsus; for I observed, to my surprise, that when I pulled off the flower-buds\nround the flowers which I wished to mark with a thread, the slight jar\ninvariably caused the corollas to fall off.\n\nThese hybrids are interesting under several points of view. First, from the\nnumber found in various parts of the same moderately-sized field. That they owed\ntheir origin to insects flying from flower to flower, whilst collecting pollen,\nthere can be no doubt. Although insects thus rob the flowers of a most precious\nsubstance, yet they do great good; for, as I have elsewhere shown, the seedlings\nof V. thapsus raised from flowers fertilised with pollen from another plant, are\nmore vigorous than those raised from self-fertilised flowers. (2\/26. 'The\nEffects of Cross and Self-fertilisation' 1876 page 89.) But in this particular\ninstance the insects did great harm, as they led to the production of utterly\nbarren plants. Secondly, these hybrids are remarkable from differing much from\none another in many of their characters; for hybrids of the first generation, if\nraised from uncultivated plants, are generally uniform in character. That these\nhybrids belonged to the first generation we may safely conclude, from the\nabsolute sterility of all those observed by me in a state of nature and of the\none plant in my garden, excepting when artificially and repeatedly fertilised\nwith pure pollen, and then the number of seeds produced was extremely small. As\nthese hybrids varied so much, an almost perfectly graduated series of forms,\nconnecting together the two widely distinct parent-species, could easily have\nbeen selected. This case, like that of the common oxlip, shows that botanists\nought to be cautious in inferring the specific identity of two forms from the\npresence of intermediate gradations; nor would it be easy in the many cases in\nwhich hybrids are moderately fertile to detect a slight degree of sterility in\nsuch plants growing in a state of nature and liable to be fertilised by either\nparent-species. Thirdly and lastly, these hybrids offer an excellent\nillustration of a statement made by that admirable observer Gartner, namely,\nthat although plants which can be crossed with ease generally produce fairly\nfertile offspring, yet well-pronounced exceptions to this rule occur; and here\nwe have two species of Verbascum which evidently cross with the greatest ease,\nbut produce hybrids which are excessively sterile.\n\n\nCHAPTER III. HETEROSTYLED DIMORPHIC PLANTS--continued.\n\nLinum grandiflorum, long-styled form utterly sterile with own-form pollen.\nLinum perenne, torsion of the pistils in the long-styled form alone.\nHomostyled species of Linum.\nPulmonaria officinalis, singular difference in self-fertility between the\nEnglish and German long-styled plants.\nPulmonaria angustifolia shown to be a distinct species, long-styled form\ncompletely self-sterile.\nPolygonum fagopyrum.\nVarious other heterostyled genera.\nRubiaceae.\nMitchella repens, fertility of the flowers in pairs.\nHoustonia.\nFaramea, remarkable difference in the pollen-grains of the two forms; torsion of\nthe stamens in the short-styled form alone; development not as yet perfect.\nThe heterostyled structure in the several Rubiaceous genera not due to descent\nin common.\n\n(FIGURE 3.4. Linum grandiflorum.\nLeft: Long-styled form.\nRight: Short-styled form.\ns, s: stigmas.)\n\nIt has long been known that several species of Linum present two forms (3\/1.\nTreviranus has shown that this is the case in his review of my original paper\n'Botanische Zeitung' 1863 page 189.), and having observed this fact in L. flavum\nmore than thirty years ago, I was led, after ascertaining the nature of\nheterostylism in Primula, to examine the first species of Linum which I met\nwith, namely, the beautiful L. grandiflorum. This plant exists under two forms,\noccurring in about equal numbers, which differ little in structure, but greatly\nin function. The foliage, corolla, stamens, and pollen-grains (the latter\nexamined both distended with water and dry) are alike in the two forms (Figure\n3.4). The difference is confined to the pistil; in the short-styled form the\nstyles and the stigmas are only about half the length of those in the long-\nstyled. A more important distinction is, that the five stigmas in the short-\nstyled form diverge greatly from one another, and pass out between the filaments\nof the stamens, and thus lie within the tube of the corolla. In the long-styled\nform the elongated stigmas stand nearly upright, and alternate with the anthers.\nIn this latter form the length of the stigmas varies considerably, their upper\nextremities projecting even a little above the anthers, or reaching up only to\nabout their middle. Nevertheless, there is never the slightest difficulty in\ndistinguishing between the two forms; for, besides the difference in the\ndivergence of the stigmas, those of the short-styled form never reach even to\nthe bases of the anthers. In this form the papillae on the stigmatic surfaces\nare shorter, darker-coloured, and more crowded together than in the long-styled\nform; but these differences seem due merely to the shortening of the stigma, for\nin the varieties of the long-styled form with shorter stigmas, the papillae are\nmore crowded and darker-coloured than in those with the longer stigmas.\nConsidering the slight and variable differences between the two forms of this\nLinum, it is not surprising that hitherto they have been overlooked.\n\nIn 1861 I had eleven plants in my garden, eight of which were long-styled, and\nthree short-styled. Two very fine long-styled plants grew in a bed a hundred\nyards off all the others, and separated from them by a screen of evergreens. I\nmarked twelve flowers, and placed on their stigmas a little pollen from the\nshort-styled plants. The pollen of the two forms is, as stated, identical in\nappearance; the stigmas of the long-styled flowers were already thickly covered\nwith their own pollen--so thickly that I could not find one bare stigma, and it\nwas late in the season, namely, September 15th. Altogether, it seemed almost\nchildish to expect any result. Nevertheless from my experiments on Primula, I\nhad faith, and did not hesitate to make the trial, but certainly did not\nanticipate the full result which was obtained. The germens of these twelve\nflowers all swelled, and ultimately six fine capsules (the seed of which\ngerminated on the following year) and two poor capsules were produced; only four\ncapsules shanking off. These same two long-styled plants produced, in the course\nof the summer, a vast number of flowers, the stigmas of which were covered with\ntheir own pollen; but they all proved absolutely barren, and their germens did\nnot even swell.\n\nThe nine other plants, six long-styled and three short-styled, grew not very far\napart in my flower-garden. Four of these long-styled plants produced no seed-\ncapsules; the fifth produced two; and the remaining one grew so close to a\nshort-styled plant that their branches touched, and this produced twelve\ncapsules, but they were poor ones. The case was different with the short-styled\nplants. The one which grew close to the long-styled plant produced ninety-four\nimperfectly fertilised capsules containing a multitude of bad seeds, with a\nmoderate number of good ones. The two other short-styled plants growing together\nwere small, being partly smothered by other plants; they did not stand very\nclose to any long-styled plants, yet they yielded together nineteen capsules.\nThese facts seem to show that the short-styled plants are more fertile with\ntheir own pollen than are the long-styled, and we shall immediately see that\nthis probably is the case. But I suspect that the difference in fertility\nbetween the two forms was in this instance in part due to a distinct cause. I\nrepeatedly watched the flowers, and only once saw a humble-bee momentarily\nalight on one, and then fly away. If bees had visited the several plants, there\ncannot be a doubt that the four long-styled plants, which did not produce a\nsingle capsule, would have borne an abundance. But several times I saw small\ndiptera sucking the flowers; and these insects, though not visiting the flowers\nwith anything like the regularity of bees, would carry a little pollen from one\nform to the other, especially when growing near together; and the stigmas of the\nshort-styled plants, diverging within the tube of the corolla, would be more\nlikely than the upright stigmas of the long-styled plants, to receive a small\nquantity of pollen if brought to them by small insects. Moreover from the\ngreater number of the long-styled than of the short-styled plants in the garden,\nthe latter would be more likely to receive pollen from the long-styled, than the\nlong-styled from the short-styled.\n\nIn 1862 I raised thirty-four plants of this Linum in a hot-bed; and these\nconsisted of seventeen long-styled and seventeen short-styled forms. Seed sown\nlater in the flower-garden yielded seventeen long-styled and twelve short-styled\nforms. These facts justify the statement that the two forms are produced in\nabout equal numbers. The thirty-four plants of the first lot were kept under a\nnet which excluded all insects, except such minute ones as Thrips. I fertilised\nfourteen long-styled flowers legitimately with pollen from the short-styled, and\ngot eleven fine seed-capsules, which contained on an average 8.6 seeds per\ncapsule, but only 5.6 appeared to be good. It may be well to state that ten\nseeds is the maximum production for a capsule, and that our climate cannot be\nvery favourable to this North-African plant. On three occasions the stigmas of\nnearly a hundred flowers were fertilised illegitimately with their own-form\npollen, taken from separate plants, so as to prevent any possible ill effects\nfrom close inter-breeding. Many other flowers were also produced, which, as\nbefore stated, must have received plenty of their own pollen; yet from all these\nflowers, borne by the seventeen long-styled plants, only three capsules were\nproduced. One of these included no seed, and the other two together gave only\nfive good seeds. It is probable that this miserable product of two half-fertile\ncapsules from the seventeen plants, each of which must have produced at least\nfifty or sixty flowers, resulted from their fertilisation with pollen from the\nshort-styled plants by the aid of Thrips; for I made a great mistake in keeping\nthe two forms under the same net, with their branches often interlocking; and it\nis surprising that a greater number of flowers were not accidentally fertilised.\n\nTwelve short-styled flowers were in this instance castrated, and afterwards\nfertilised legitimately with pollen from the long-styled form; and they produced\nseven fine capsules. These included on an average 7.6 seeds, but of apparently\ngood seed only 4.3 per capsule. At three separate times nearly a hundred flowers\nwere fertilised illegitimately with their own-form pollen, taken from separate\nplants; and numerous other flowers were produced, many of which must have\nreceived their own pollen. From all these flowers on the seventeen short-styled\nplants only fifteen capsules were produced, of which only eleven contained any\ngood seed, on an average 4.2 per capsule. As remarked in the case of the long-\nstyled plants, some even of these capsules were perhaps the product of a little\npollen accidentally fallen from the adjoining flowers of the other form on to\nthe stigmas, or transported by Thrips. Nevertheless the short-styled plants seem\nto be slightly more fertile with their own pollen than the long-styled, in the\nproportion of fifteen capsules to three; nor can this difference be accounted\nfor by the short-styled stigmas being more liable to receive their own pollen\nthan the long-styled, for the reverse is the case. The greater self-fertility of\nthe short-styled flowers was likewise shown in 1861 by the plants in my flower-\ngarden, which were left to themselves, and were but sparingly visited by\ninsects.\n\nOn account of the probability of some of the flowers on the plants of both\nforms, which were covered under the same net, having been legitimately\nfertilised in an accidental manner, the relative fertility of the two legitimate\nand two illegitimate unions cannot be compared with certainty; but judging from\nthe number of good seeds per capsule, the difference was at least in the ratio\nof 100 to 7, and probably much greater.\n\nHildebrand tested my results, but only on a single short-styled plant, by\nfertilising many flowers with their own-form pollen; and these did not produce\nany seed. This confirms my suspicion that some of the few capsules produced by\nthe foregoing seventeen short-styled plants were the product of accidental\nlegitimate fertilisation. Other flowers on the same plant were fertilised by\nHildebrand with pollen from the long-styled form, and all produced fruit. (3\/2.\n'Botanische Zeitung' January 1, 1864 page 2.)\n\nThe absolute sterility (judging from the experiments of 1861) of the long-styled\nplants with their own-form pollen led me to examine into its apparent cause; and\nthe results are so curious that they are worth giving in detail. The experiments\nwere tried on plants grown in pots and brought successively into the house.\n\nFIRST.\n\nPollen from a short-styled plant was placed on the five stigmas of a long-styled\nflower, and these, after thirty hours, were found deeply penetrated by a\nmultitude of pollen-tubes, far too numerous to be counted; the stigmas had also\nbecome discoloured and twisted. I repeated this experiment on another flower,\nand in eighteen hours the stigmas were penetrated by a multitude of long pollen-\ntubes. This is what might have been expected, as the union is a legitimate one.\nThe converse experiment was likewise tried, and pollen from a long-styled flower\nwas placed on the stigmas of a short-styled flower, and in twenty-four hours the\nstigmas were discoloured, twisted, and penetrated by numerous pollen-tubes; and\nthis, again, is what might have been expected, as the union was a legitimate\none.\n\nSECONDLY.\n\nPollen from a long-styled flower was placed on all five stigmas of a long-styled\nflower on a separate plant: after nineteen hours the stigmas were dissected, and\nonly a single pollen-grain had emitted a tube, and this was a very short one. To\nmake sure that the pollen was good, I took in this case, and in most of the\nother cases, pollen either from the same anther or from the same flower, and\nproved it to be good by placing it on the stigma of a short-styled plant, and\nfound numerous pollen-tubes emitted.\n\nTHIRDLY.\n\nRepeated last experiment, and placed own-form pollen on all five stigmas of a\nlong-styled flower; after nineteen hours and a half, not one single grain had\nemitted its tube.\n\nFOURTHLY.\n\nRepeated the experiment, with the same result after twenty-four hours.\n\nFIFTHLY.\n\nRepeated last experiment, and, after leaving pollen on for nineteen hours, put\non an additional quantity of own-form pollen on all five stigmas. After an\ninterval of three days, the stigmas were examined, and, instead of being\ndiscoloured and twisted, they were straight and fresh-coloured. Only one grain\nhad emitted a quite short tube, which was drawn out of the stigmatic tissue\nwithout being ruptured.\n\nThe following experiments are more striking:--\n\nSIXTHLY.\n\nI placed own-form pollen on three of the stigmas of a long-styled flower, and\npollen from a short-styled flower on the other two stigmas. After twenty-two\nhours these two stigmas were discoloured, slightly twisted, and penetrated by\nthe tubes of numerous pollen-grains: the other three stigmas, covered with their\nown-form pollen, were fresh, and all the pollen-grains were loose; but I did not\ndissect the whole stigma.\n\nSEVENTHLY.\n\nExperiment repeated in the same manner, with the same result.\n\nEIGHTHLY.\n\nExperiment repeated, but the stigmas were carefully examined after an interval\nof only five hours and a half. The two stigmas with pollen from a short-styled\nflower were penetrated by innumerable tubes, which were as yet short, and the\nstigmas themselves were not at all discoloured. The three stigmas covered with\ntheir own-form pollen were not penetrated by a single pollen-tube.\n\nNINTHLY.\n\nPut pollen of a short-styled flower on a single long-styled stigma, and own-form\npollen on the other four stigmas; after twenty-four hours the one stigma was\nsomewhat discoloured and twisted, and penetrated by many long tubes: the other\nfour stigmas were quite straight and fresh; but on dissecting them I found that\nthree pollen-grains had protruded very short tubes into the tissue.\n\nTENTHLY.\n\nRepeated the experiment, with the same result after twenty-four hours, excepting\nthat only two own-form grains had penetrated the stigmatic tissue with their\ntubes to a very short depth. The one stigma, which was deeply penetrated by a\nmultitude of tubes from the short-styled pollen, presented a conspicuous\ndifference in being much curled, half-shrivelled, and discoloured, in comparison\nwith the other four straight and bright pink stigmas.\n\nI could add other experiments; but those now given amply suffice to show that\nthe pollen-grains of a short-styled flower placed on the stigma of a long-styled\nflower emit a multitude of tubes after an interval of from five to six hours,\nand penetrate the tissue ultimately to a great depth; and that after twenty-four\nhours the stigmas thus penetrated change colour, become twisted, and appear\nhalf-withered. On the other hand, pollen-grains from a long-styled flower placed\non its own stigmas, do not emit their tubes after an interval of a day, or even\nthree days; or at most only three or four grains out of a multitude emit their\ntubes, and these apparently never penetrate the stigmatic tissue deeply, and the\nstigmas themselves do not soon become discoloured and twisted.\n\nThis seems to me a remarkable physiological fact. The pollen-grains of the two\nforms are undistinguishable under the microscope; the stigmas differ only in\nlength, degree of divergence, and in the size, shade of colour, and\napproximation of their papillae, these latter differences being variable and\napparently due merely to the degree of elongation of the stigma. Yet we plainly\nsee that the two kinds of pollen and the two stigmas are widely dissimilar in\ntheir mutual reaction--the stigmas of each form being almost powerless on their\nown pollen, but causing, through some mysterious influence, apparently by simple\ncontact (for I could detect no viscid secretion), the pollen-grains of the\nopposite form to protrude their tubes. It may be said that the two pollens and\nthe two stigmas mutually recognise each other by some means. Taking fertility as\nthe criterion of distinctness, it is no exaggeration to say that the pollen of\nthe long-styled Linum grandiflorum (and conversely that of the other form) has\nbeen brought to a degree of differentiation, with respect to its action on the\nstigma of the same form, corresponding with that existing between the pollen and\nstigma of species belonging to distinct genera.\n\nLinum perenne.\n\nThis species is conspicuously heterostyled, as has been noticed by several\nauthors. The pistil in the long-styled form is nearly twice as long as that of\nthe short-styled. In the latter the stigmas are smaller and, diverging to a\ngreater degree, pass out low down between the filaments. I could detect no\ndifference in the two forms in the size of the stigmatic papillae. In the long-\nstyled form alone the stigmatic surfaces of the mature pistils twist round, so\nas to face the circumference of the flower; but to this point I shall presently\nreturn. Differently from what occurs in L. grandiflorum, the long-styled flowers\nhave stamens hardly more than half the length of those in the short-styled. The\nsize of the pollen-grains is rather variable; after some doubt, I have come to\nthe conclusion that there is no uniform difference between the grains in the two\nforms. The long-stamens in the short-styled form project to some height above\nthe corolla, and their filaments are coloured blue apparently from exposure to\nthe light. The anthers of the longer stamens correspond in height with the lower\npart of the stigmas of the long-styled flowers; and the anthers of the shorter\nstamens of the latter correspond in the same manner in height with the stigmas\nof the short-styled flowers.\n\nI raised from seed twenty-six plants, of which twelve proved to be long-styled\nand fourteen short-styled. They flowered well, but were not large plants. As I\ndid not expect them to flower so soon, I did not transplant them, and they\nunfortunately grew with their branches closely interlocked. All the plants were\ncovered under the same net, excepting one of each form. Of the flowers on the\nlong-styled plants, twelve were illegitimately fertilised with their own-form\npollen, taken in every case from a separate plant; and not one set a seed-\ncapsule: twelve other flowers were legitimately fertilised with pollen from\nshort-styled flowers; and they set nine capsules, each including on an average 7\ngood seeds, ten being the maximum number ever produced. Of the flowers on the\nshort-styled plants, twelve were illegitimately fertilised with own-form pollen,\nand they yielded one capsule, including only 3 good seeds; twelve other flowers\nwere legitimately fertilised with pollen from long-styled flowers, and these\nproduced nine capsules, but one was bad; the eight good capsules contained on an\naverage 8 good seeds each. Judging from the number of seeds per capsule, the\nfertility of the two legitimate to that of the two illegitimate unions is as 100\nto 20.\n\nThe numerous flowers on the eleven long-styled plants under the net, which were\nnot fertilised, produced only three capsules, including 8, 4, and 1 good seeds.\nWhether these three capsules were the product of accidental legitimate\nfertilisation, owing to the branches of the plants of the two forms\ninterlocking, I will not pretend to decide. The single long-styled plant which\nwas left uncovered, and grew close by the uncovered short-styled plant, produced\nfive good pods; but it was a poor and small plant.\n\nThe flowers borne on the thirteen short-styled plants under the net, which were\nnot fertilised, produced twelve capsules, containing on an average 5.6 seeds. As\nsome of these capsules were very fine, and as five were borne on one twig, I\nsuspect that some minute insect had accidentally got under the net and had\nbrought pollen from the other form to the flowers which produced this little\ngroup of capsules. The one uncovered short-styled plant which grew close to the\nuncovered long-styled plant yielded twelve capsules.\n\nFrom these facts we have some reason to believe, as in the case of L.\ngrandiflorum, that the short-styled plants are in a slight degree more fertile\nwith their own pollen than are the long-styled plants. Anyhow we have the\nclearest evidence, that the stigmas of each form require for full fertility that\npollen from the stamens of corresponding height belonging to the opposite form\nshould be brought to them.\n\nHildebrand, in the paper lately referred to, confirms my results. He placed a\nshort-styled plant in his house, and fertilised about 20 flowers with their own\npollen, and about 30 with pollen from another plant belonging to the same form,\nand these 50 flowers did not set a single capsule. On the other hand he\nfertilised about 30 flowers with pollen from the long-styled form, and these,\nwith the exception of two, yielded capsules, containing good seeds.\n\nIt is a singular fact, in contrast with what occurred in the case of L.\ngrandiflorum, that the pollen-grains of both forms of L. perenne, when placed on\ntheir own-form stigmas, emitted their tubes, though this action did not lead to\nthe production of seeds. After an interval of eighteen hours, the tubes\npenetrated the stigmatic tissue, but to what depth I did not ascertain. In this\ncase the impotence of the pollen-grains on their own stigmas must have been due\neither to the tubes not reaching the ovules, or to their not acting properly\nafter reaching them.\n\nThe plants both of L. perenne and grandiflorum, grew, as already stated, with\ntheir branches interlocked, and with scores of flowers of the two forms close\ntogether; they were covered by a rather coarse net, through which the wind, when\nhigh, passed; and such minute insects as Thrips could not, of course, be\nexcluded; yet we have seen that the utmost possible amount of accidental\nfertilisation on seventeen long-styled plants in the one case, and on eleven\nlong-styled plants in the other, resulted in the production, in each case, of\nthree poor capsules; so that when the proper insects are excluded, the wind does\nhardly anything in the way of carrying pollen from plant to plant. I allude to\nthis fact because botanists in speaking of the fertilisation of various flowers,\noften refer to the wind or to insects as if the alternative were indifferent.\nThis view, according to my experience, is entirely erroneous. When the wind is\nthe agent in carrying pollen, either from one sex to the other, or from\nhermaphrodite to hermaphrodite, we can recognise structure as manifestly adapted\nto its action as to that of insects when these are the carriers. We see\nadaptation to the wind in the incoherence of the pollen,--in the inordinate\nquantity produced (as in the Coniferae, Spinage, etc.),--in the dangling anthers\nwell fitted to shake out the pollen,--in the absence or small size of the\nperianth,--in the protrusion of the stigmas at the period of fertilisation,--in\nthe flowers being produced before they are hidden by the leaves,--and in the\nstigmas being downy or plumose (as in the Gramineae, Docks, etc), so as to\nsecure the chance-blown grains. In plants which are fertilised by the wind, the\nflowers do not secrete nectar, their pollen is too incoherent to be easily\ncollected by insects, they have not bright-coloured corollas to serve as guides,\nand they are not, as far as I have seen, visited by insects. When insects are\nthe agents of fertilisation (and this is incomparably the more frequent case\nwith hermaphrodite plants), the wind plays no part, but we see an endless number\nof adaptations to ensure the safe transport of the pollen by the living workers.\nThese adaptations are most easily recognised in irregular flowers; but they are\npresent in regular flowers, of which those of Linum offer a good instance, as I\nwill now endeavour to show.\n\nI have already alluded to the rotation of each separate stigma in the long-\nstyled form of Linum perenne. In both forms of the other heterostyled species\nand in the homostyled species of Linum which I have seen, the stigmatic surfaces\nface the centre of the flower, with the furrowed backs of the stigmas, to which\nthe styles are attached, facing outwards. This is the case with the stigmas of\nthe long-styled flowers of L. perenne whilst in bud. But by the time the flowers\nhave expanded, the five stigmas twist round so as to face the circumference,\nowing to the torsion of that part of the style which lies beneath the stigma. I\nshould state that the five stigmas do not always turn round completely, two or\nthree sometimes facing only obliquely outwards. My observations were made during\nOctober; and it is not improbable that earlier in the season the torsion would\nhave been more complete; for after two or three cold and wet days the movement\nwas very imperfectly performed. The flowers should be examined shortly after\ntheir expansion, as their duration is brief; as soon as they begin to wither,\nthe styles become spirally twisted all together, the original position of the\nparts being thus lost.\n\nHe who will compare the structure of the whole flower in both forms of L.\nperenne and grandiflorum, and, as I may add, of L. flavum, will not doubt about\nthe meaning of this torsion of the styles in the one form alone of L. perenne,\nas well as the meaning of the divergence of the stigmas in the short-styled form\nof all three species. It is absolutely necessary as we know, that insects should\ncarry pollen from the flowers of the one form reciprocally to those of the\nother. Insects are attracted by five drops of nectar, secreted exteriorly at the\nbase of the stamens, so that to reach these drops they must insert their\nproboscides outside the ring of broad filaments, between them and the petals. In\nthe short-styled form of the above three species, the stigmas face the axis of\nthe flower; and had the styles retained their original upright and central\nposition, not only would the stigmas have presented their backs to the insects\nwhich sucked the flowers, but their front and fertile surfaces would have been\nseparated from the entering insects by the ring of broad filaments, and would\nnever have received any pollen. As it is, the styles diverge and pass out\nbetween the filaments. After this movement the short stigmas lie within the tube\nof the corolla; and their papillous surfaces being now turned upwards are\nnecessarily brushed by every entering insect, and thus receive the required\npollen.\n\nIn the long-styled form of L. grandiflorum, the almost parallel or slightly\ndiverging anthers and stigmas project a little above the tube of the somewhat\nconcave flower; and they stand directly over the open space leading to the drops\nof nectar. Consequently when insects visit the flowers of either form (for the\nstamens in this species occupy the same position in both forms), they will get\ntheir foreheads or proboscides well dusted with the coherent pollen. As soon as\nthey visit the flowers of the long-styled form they will necessarily leave\npollen on the proper surface of the elongated stigmas; and when they visit the\nshort-styled flowers, they will leave pollen on the upturned stigmatic surfaces.\nThus the stigmas of both forms will receive indifferently the pollen of both\nforms; but we know that the pollen alone of the opposite form causes\nfertilisation.\n\n(Figure 3.5. Long-styled form of L. perenne var. Austriacum in its early\ncondition before the stigmas have rotated. The petals and calyx have been\nremoved on the near side. (3\/3. I neglected to get drawings made from fresh\nflowers of the two forms. But Mr. Fitch has made the above sketch of a long-\nstyled flower from dried specimens and from published engravings. His well-known\nskill ensures accuracy in the proportional size of the parts.)\n\nIn the case of L. perenne, affairs are arranged more perfectly; for the stamens\nin the two forms stand at different heights, so that pollen from the anthers of\nthe longer stamens will adhere to one part of an insect's body, and will\nafterwards be brushed off by the rough stigmas of the longer pistils; whilst\npollen from the anthers of the shorter stamens will adhere to a different part\nof the insect's body, and will afterwards be brushed off by the stigmas of the\nshorter pistils; and this is what is required for the legitimate fertilisation\nof both forms. The corolla of L. perenne is more expanded than that of L.\ngrandiflorum, and the stigmas of the long-styled form do not diverge greatly\nfrom one another; nor do the stamens of either form. Hence insects, especially\nrather small ones, will not insert their proboscides between the stigmas of the\nlong-styled form, nor between the anthers of either form (Figure 3.5), but will\nstrike against them, at nearly right angles, with the backs of their head or\nthorax. Now, in the long-styled flowers, if each stigma did not rotate on its\naxis, insects in visiting them would strike their heads against the backs of the\nstigmas; as it is, they strike against that surface which is covered with\npapillae, with their heads already charged with pollen from the stamens of\ncorresponding height borne by the flowers of the other form, and legitimate\nfertilisation is thus ensured.\n\nThus we can understand the meaning of the torsion of the styles in the long-\nstyled flowers alone, as well as their divergence in the short-styled flowers.\n\nOne other point is worth notice. In botanical works many flowers are said to be\nfertilised in the bud. This statement generally rests, as far as I can discover,\non the anthers opening in the bud; no evidence being adduced that the stigma is\nat this period mature, or that it is not subsequently acted on by pollen brought\nfrom other flowers. In the case of Cephalanthera grandiflora I have shown that\nprecocious and partial self-fertilisation, with subsequent full fertilisation,\nis the regular course of events. (3\/4. 'Fertilisation of Orchids' page 108; 2nd\nedition 1877 page 84.) The belief that the flowers of many plants are fertilised\nin the bud, that is, are perpetually self-fertilised, is a most effectual bar to\nunderstanding their real structure. I am, however, far from wishing to assert\nthat some flowers, during certain seasons, are not fertilised in the bud; for I\nhave reason to believe that this is the case. A good observer, resting his\nbelief on the usual kind of evidence, states that in Linum Austriacum (which is\nheterostyled, and is considered by Planchon as a variety of L. perenne) the\nanthers open the evening before the expansion of the flowers, and that the\nstigmas are then almost always fertilised. (3\/5. H. Lecoq 'Etudes sur la Geogr.\nBot.' 1856 tome 5 page 325.) Now we know positively that, so far from Linum\nperenne being fertilised by its own pollen in the bud, its own pollen is as\npowerless on the stigma as so much inorganic dust.\n\nLinum flavum.\n\nThe pistil of the long-styled form of this species is nearly twice as long as\nthat of the short-styled; the stigmas are longer and the papillae coarser. In\nthe short-styled form the stigmas diverge and pass out between the filaments, as\nin the previous species. The stamens in the two forms differ in length; and,\nwhat is singular, the anthers of the longer stamens are not so long as those of\nthe other form; so that in the short-styled form both the stigmas and the\nanthers are shorter than in the long-styled form. The pollen-grains of the two\nforms do not differ in size. As this species is propagated by cuttings,\ngenerally all the plants in the same garden belong to the same form. I have\ninquired, but have never heard of its seeding in this country. Certainly my own\nplants never produced a single seed as long as I possessed only one of the two\nforms. After considerable search I procured both forms, but from want of time\nonly a few experiments were made. Two plants of the two forms were planted some\nway apart in my garden, and were not covered by nets. Three flowers on the long-\nstyled plant were legitimately fertilised with pollen from the short-styled\nplant, and one of them set a fine capsule. No other capsules were produced by\nthis plant. Three flowers on the short-styled plant were legitimately fertilised\nwith pollen from the long-styled, and all three produced capsules, containing\nrespectively no less than 8, 9, and 10 seeds. Three other flowers on this plant,\nwhich had not been artificially fertilised, produced capsules containing 5, 1,\nand 5 seeds; and it is quite possible that pollen may have been brought to them\nby insects from the long-styled plant growing in the same garden. Nevertheless,\nas they did not yield half the number of seeds compared with the other flowers\non the same plant which had been artificially and legitimately fertilised, and\nas the short-styled plants of the two previous species apparently evince some\nslight capacity for fertilisation with their own-form pollen, these three\ncapsules may have been the product of self-fertilisation.\n\nBesides the three species now described, the yellow-flowered L. corymbiferum is\ncertainly heterostyled, as is, according to Planchon, L. salsoloides. (3\/6.\nHooker's 'London Journal of Botany' 1848 volume 7 page 174.) This botanist is\nthe only one who seems to have inferred that heterostylism might have some\nimportant functional bearing. Dr. Alefeld, who has made a special study of the\ngenus, says that about half of the sixty-five species known to him are\nheterostyled. (3\/7. 'Botanische Zeitung' September 18, 1863 page 281.) This is\nthe case with L. trigynum, which differs so much from the other species that it\nhas been formed by him into a distinct genus. (3\/8. It is not improbable that\nthe allied genus, Hugonia, is heterostyled, for one species is said by Planchon\n(Hooker's 'London Journal of Botany' 1848 volume 7 page 525) to be provided with\n\"staminibus exsertis;\" another with \"stylis staminibus longioribus,\" and another\nhas \"stamina 5, majora, stylos longe superantia.\") According to the same author,\nnone of the species which inhabit America and the Cape of Good Hope are\nheterostyled.\n\nI have examined only three homostyled species, namely, L. usitatissimum,\nangustifolium, and catharticum. I raised 111 plants of a variety of the first-\nnamed species, and these, when protected under a net, all produced plenty of\nseed. The flowers, according to H. Muller, are frequented by bees and moths.\n(3\/9. 'Die Befruchtung der Blumen' etc. page 168.) With respect to L.\ncatharticum, the same author shows that the flowers are so constructed that they\ncan freely fertilise themselves; but if visited by insects they might be cross-\nfertilised. He has, however, only once seen the flowers thus visited during the\nday; but it may be suspected that they are frequented during the night by small\nmoths for the sake of the five minute drops of nectar secreted. Lastly, L.\nLewisii is said by Planchon to bear on the same plant flowers with stamens and\npistils of the same height, and others with the pistils either longer or shorter\nthan the stamens. This case formerly appeared to me an extraordinary one; but I\nam now inclined to believe that it is one merely of great variability. (3\/10.\nPlanchon in Hooker's 'London Journal of Botany' 1848 volume 7 page 175. See on\nthis subject Asa Gray in 'American Journal of Science' volume 36 September 1863\npage 284.)\n\nPULMONARIA (BORAGINEAE).\n\nPulmonaria officinalis.\n\nHildebrand has published a full account of this heterostyled plant. (3\/11.\n'Botanische Zeitung' 1865 January 13 page 13.) The pistil of the long-styled\nform is twice as long as that of the short-styled; and the stamens differ in a\ncorresponding, though converse, manner. There is no marked difference in the\nshape or state of surface of the stigma in the two forms. The pollen-grains of\nthe short-styled form are to those of the long-styled as 9 to 7, or as 100 to\n78, in length, and as 7 to 6 in breadth. They do not differ in the appearance of\ntheir contents. The corolla of the one form differs in shape from that of the\nother in nearly the same manner as in Primula; but besides this difference the\nflowers of the short-styled are generally the larger of the two. Hildebrand\ncollected on the Siebengebirge, ten wild long-styled and ten short-styled\nplants. The former bore 289 flowers, of which 186 (i.e. 64 per cent) had set\nfruit, yielding 1.88 seed per fruit. The ten short-styled plants bore 373\nflowers, of which 262 (i.e. 70 per cent) had set fruit, yielding 1.86 seed per\nfruit. So that the short-styled plants produced many more flowers, and these set\na rather larger proportion of fruit, but the fruits themselves yielded a\nslightly lower average number of seeds than did the long-styled plants. The\nresults of Hildebrand's experiments on the fertility of the two forms are given\nin Table 3.19.\n\nTABLE 3.19. Pulmonaria officinalis (from Hildebrand).\n\nColumn 1: Nature of the Union.\nColumn 2: Number of Flowers fertilised.\nColumn 3: Number of Fruits produced.\nColumn 4: Average Number of Seeds per Fruit.\n\nLong-styled by pollen of short-styled. Legitimate union :\n14 : 10 : 1.30.\n\nLong-styled 14 by own-pollen, and 16 by pollen of other plant of same form.\nIllegitimate union :\n30 : 0 : 0.\n\nShort-styled by pollen of long-styled. Legitimate union:\n16 : 14 : 1.57.\n\nShort-styled 11 by own-pollen, 14 by pollen of other plant of same form.\nIllegitimate union :\n25 : 0 : 0.\n\nIn the summer of 1864, before I had heard of Hildebrand's experiments, I noticed\nsome long-styled plants of this species (named for me by Dr. Hooker) growing by\nthemselves in a garden in Surrey; and to my surprise about half the flowers had\nset fruit, several of which contained 2, and one contained even 3 seeds. These\nseeds were sown in my garden and eleven seedlings thus raised, all of which\nproved long-styled, in accordance with the usual rule in such cases. Two years\nafterwards the plants were left uncovered, no other plant of the same genus\ngrowing in my garden, and the flowers were visited by many bees. They set an\nabundance of seeds: for instance, I gathered from a single plant rather less\nthan half of the seeds which it had produced, and they numbered 47. Therefore\nthis illegitimately fertilised plant must have produced about 100 seeds; that\nis, thrice as many as one of the wild long-styled plants collected on the\nSiebengebirge by Hildebrand, and which, no doubt, had been legitimately\nfertilised. In the following year one of my plants was covered by a net, and\neven under these unfavourable conditions it produced spontaneously a few seeds.\nIt should be observed that as the flowers stand either almost horizontally or\nhang considerably downwards, pollen from the short stamens would be likely to\nfall on the stigma. We thus see that the English long-styled plants when\nillegitimately fertilised were highly fertile, whilst the German plants\nsimilarly treated by Hildebrand were completely sterile. How to account for this\nwide discordance in our results I know not. Hildebrand cultivated his plants in\npots and kept them for a time in the house, whilst mine were grown out of doors;\nand he thinks that this difference of treatment may have caused the difference\nin our results. But this does not appear to me nearly a sufficient cause,\nalthough his plants were slightly less productive than the wild ones growing on\nthe Siebengbirge. My plants exhibited no tendency to become equal-styled, so as\nto lose their proper long-styled character, as not rarely happens under\ncultivation with several heterostyled species of Primula; but it would appear\nthat they had been greatly affected in function, either by long-continued\ncultivation or by some other cause. We shall see in a future chapter that\nheterostyled plants illegitimately fertilised during several successive\ngenerations sometimes become more self-fertile; and this may have been the case\nwith my stock of the present species of Pulmonaria; but in this case we must\nassume that the long-styled plants were at first sufficiently fertile to yield\nsome seed, instead of being absolutely self-sterile like the German plants.\n\nPulmonaria angustifolia.\n\n(FIGURE 3.6. Pulmonaria angustifolia.\nLeft: Long-styled form.\nRight: Short-styled form.)\n\nSeedlings of this plant, raised from plants growing wild in the Isle of Wight,\nwere named for me by Dr. Hooker. It is so closely allied to the last species,\ndiffering chiefly in the shape and spotting of the leaves, that the two have\nbeen considered by several eminent botanists--for instance, Bentham--as mere\nvarieties. But, as we shall presently see, good evidence can be assigned for\nranking them as distinct. Owing to the doubts on this head, I tried whether the\ntwo would mutually fertilise one another. Twelve short-styled flowers of P.\nangustifolia were legitimately fertilised with pollen from long-styled plants of\nP. officinalis (which, as we have just seen, are moderately self-fertile), but\nthey did not produce a single fruit. Thirty-six long-styled flowers of P.\nangustifolia were also illegitimately fertilised during two seasons with pollen\nfrom the long-styled P. officinalis, but all these flowers dropped off\nunimpregnated. Had the plants been mere varieties of the same species these\nillegitimate crosses would probably have yielded some seeds, judging from my\nsuccess in illegitimately fertilising the long-styled flowers of P. officinalis;\nand the twelve legitimate crosses, instead of yielding no fruit, would almost\ncertainly have yielded a considerable number, namely, about nine, judging from\nthe results given in Table 3.20. Therefore P. officinalis and angustifolia\nappear to be good and distinct species, in conformity with other important\nfunctional differences between them, immediately to be described.\n\nTABLE 3.20.  Pulmonaria angustifolia.\n\nColumn 1: Nature of the Union.\nColumn 2: Number of Flowers fertilised.\nColumn 3: Number of Fruits produced.\nColumn 4: Average Number of Seeds per Fruit.\n\nLong-styled by pollen of short-styled.

Legitimate union:\n18 : 15 : 2.60.\n\nShort-styled by own-form pollen. Illegitimate union :\n12 : 7 : 1.86.\n\nThe long-styled and short-styled flowers of P. angustifolia differ from one\nanother in structure in nearly the same manner as those of P. officinalis. But\nin Figure 3.6 a slight bulging of the corolla in the long-styled form, where the\nanthers are seated, has been overlooked. My son William, who examined a large\nnumber of wild plants in the Isle of Wight, observed that the corolla, though\nvariable in size, was generally larger in the long-styled flowers than in the\nshort-styled; and certainly the largest corollas of all were found on the long-\nstyled plants, and the smallest on the short-styled. Exactly the reverse occurs,\naccording to Hildebrand, with P. officinalis. Both the pistils and stamens of P.\nangustifolia vary much in length; so that in the short-styled form the distance\nbetween the stigma and the anthers varied from 119 to 65 divisions of the\nmicrometer, and in the long-styled from 115 to 112. From an average of seven\nmeasurements of each form the distance between these organs in the long-styled\nis to the same distance in the short-styled form as 100 to 69; so that the\nstigma in the one form does not stand on a level with the anthers in the other.\nThe long-styled pistil is sometimes thrice as long as that of the short-styled;\nbut from an average of ten measurements of both, its length to that of the\nshort-styled was as 100 to 56. The stigma varies in being more or less, though\nslightly, lobed. The anthers also vary much in length in both forms, but in a\ngreater degree in the long-styled than in the short-styled-form; many in the\nformer being from 80 to 63, and in the latter from 80 to 70 divisions of the\nmicrometer in length. From an average of seven measurements, the short-styled\nanthers were to those from the long-styled as 100 to 91 in length. Lastly, the\npollen-grains from the long-styled flowers varied between 13 and 11.5 divisions\nof the micrometer, and those from the short-styled between 15 and 13. The\naverage diameter of 25 grains from the latter, or short-styled form, was to that\nof 20 grains from the long-styled as 100 to 91. We see, therefore, that the\npollen-grains from the smaller anthers of the shorter stamens in the long-styled\nform are, as usual, of smaller size than those in the other form. But what is\nremarkable, a larger proportion of the grains were small, shrivelled, and\nworthless. This could be seen by merely comparing the contents of the anthers\nfrom several distinct plants of each form. But in one instance my son found, by\ncounting, that out of 193 grains from a long-styled flower, 53 were bad, or 27\nper cent; whilst out of 265 grains from a short-styled flower only 18 were bad,\nor 7 per cent. From the condition of the pollen in the long-styled form, and\nfrom the extreme variability of all the organs in both forms, we may perhaps\nsuspect that the plant is undergoing a change, and tending to become dioecious.\n\nMy son collected in the Isle of Wight on two occasions 202 plants, of which 125\nwere long-styled and 77 short-styled; so that the former were the more numerous.\nOn the other hand, out of 18 plants raised by me from seed, only 4 were long-\nstyled and 14 short-styled. The short-styled plants seemed to my son to produce\na greater number of flowers than the long-styled; and he came to this conclusion\nbefore a similar statement had been published by Hildebrand with respect to P.\nofficinalis. My son gathered ten branches from ten different plants of both\nforms, and found the number of flowers of the two forms to be as 100 to 89, 190\nbeing short-styled and 169 long-styled. With P. officinalis the difference,\naccording to Hildebrand, is even greater, namely, as 100 flowers for the short-\nstyled to 77 for the long-styled plants. Table 3.20 shows the results of my\nexperiments.\n\nWe see in Table 3.20 that the fertility of the two legitimate unions to that of\nthe two illegitimate together is as 100 to 35, judged by the proportion of\nflowers which produced fruit; and as 100 to 32, judged by the average number of\nseeds per fruit. But the small number of fruit yielded by the 18 long-styled\nflowers in the first line was probably accidental, and if so, the difference in\nthe proportion of legitimately and illegitimately fertilised flowers which yield\nfruit is really greater than that represented by the ratio of 100 to 35. The 18\nlong-styled flowers illegitimately fertilised yielded no seeds,--not even a\nvestige of one. Two long-styled plants which were placed under a net produced\n138 flowers, besides those which were artificially fertilised, and none of these\nset any fruit; nor did some plants of the same form which were protected during\nthe next summer. Two other long-styled plants were left uncovered (all the\nshort-styled plants having been previously covered up), and humble-bees, which\nhad their foreheads white with pollen, incessantly visited the flowers, so that\ntheir stigmas must have received an abundance of pollen, yet these flowers did\nnot produce a single fruit. We may therefore conclude that the long-styled\nplants are absolutely barren with their own-form pollen, though brought from a\ndistinct plant. In this respect they differ greatly from the long-styled English\nplants of P. officinalis which were found by me to be moderately self-fertile;\nbut they agree in their behaviour with the German plants of P. officinalis\nexperimented on by Hildebrand.\n\nEighteen short-styled flowers legitimately fertilised yielded, as may be seen in\nTable 3.20, 15 fruits, each having on an average 2.6 seeds. Four of these fruits\ncontained the highest possible number of seeds, namely 4, and four other fruits\ncontained each 3 seeds. The 12 illegitimately fertilised short-styled flowers\nyielded 7 fruits, including on an average 1.86 seed; and one of these fruits\ncontained the maximum number of 4 seeds. This result is very surprising in\ncontrast with the absolute barrenness of the long-styled flowers when\nillegitimately fertilised; and I was thus led to attend carefully to the degree\nof self-fertility of the short-styled plants. A plant belonging to this form and\ncovered by a net bore 28 flowers besides those which had been artificially\nfertilised, and of all these only two produced a fruit each including a single\nseed. This high degree of self-sterility no doubt depended merely on the stigmas\nnot receiving any pollen, or not a sufficient quantity. For after carefully\ncovering all the long-styled plants in my garden, several short-styled plants\nwere left exposed to the visits of humble-bees, and their stigmas will thus have\nreceived plenty of short-styled pollen; and now about half the flowers, thus\nillegitimately fertilised, set fruit. I judge of this proportion partly from\nestimation and partly from having examined three large branches, which had borne\n31 flowers, and these produced 16 fruits. Of the fruits produced 233 were\ncollected (many being left ungathered), and these included on an average 1.82\nseed. No less than 16 out of the 233 fruits included the highest possible number\nof seeds, namely 4, and 31 included 3 seeds. So we see how highly fertile these\nshort-styled plants were when illegitimately fertilised with their own-form\npollen by the aid of bees.\n\nThe great difference in the fertility of the long and short-styled flowers, when\nboth are illegitimately fertilised, is a unique case, as far as I have observed\nwith heterostyled plants. The long-styled flowers when thus fertilised are\nutterly barren, whilst about half of the short-styled ones produce capsules, and\nthese include a little above two-thirds of the number of seeds yielded by them\nwhen legitimately fertilised. The sterility of the illegitimately fertilised\nlong-styled flowers is probably increased by the deteriorated condition of their\npollen; nevertheless this pollen was highly efficient when applied to the\nstigmas of the short-styled flowers. With several species of Primula the short-\nstyled flowers are much more sterile than the long-styled, when both are\nillegitimately fertilised; and it is a tempting view, as formerly remarked, that\nthis greater sterility of the short-styled flowers is a special adaptation to\ncheck self-fertilisation, as their stigmas are eminently liable to receive their\nown pollen. This view is even still more tempting in the case of the long-styled\nform of Linum grandiflorum. On the other hand, with Pulmonaria angustifolia, it\nis evident, from the corolla projecting obliquely upwards, that pollen is much\nmore likely to fall on, or to be carried by insects down to the stigma of the\nshort-styled than of the long-styled flowers; yet the short-styled instead of\nbeing more sterile, as a protection against self-fertilisation, are far more\nfertile than the long-styled, when both are illegitimately fertilised.\n\nPulmonaria azurea, according to Hildebrand, is not heterostyled. (3\/12. 'Die\nGeschlechter-Vertheilung bei den Pflanzen' 1867 page 37.)\n\n[From an examination of dried flowers of Amsinckia spectabilis, sent me by\nProfessor Asa Gray, I formerly thought that this plant, a member of the\nBoragineae, was heterostyled. The pistil varies to an extraordinary degree in\nlength, being in some specimens twice as long as in others, and the point of\ninsertion of the stamens likewise varies. But on raising many plants from seed,\nI soon became convinced that the whole case was one of mere variability. The\nfirst-formed flowers are apt to have stamens somewhat arrested in development,\nwith very little pollen in their anthers; and in such flowers the stigma\nprojects above the anthers, whilst generally it stands below and sometimes on a\nlevel with them. I could detect no difference in the size of the pollen-grain or\nin the structure of the stigma in the plants which differed most in the above\nrespects; and all of them, when protected from the access of insects, yielded\nplenty of seeds. Again, from statements made by Vaucher, and from a hasty\ninspection, I thought at first that the allied Anchusa arvensis and Echium\nvulgare were heterostyled, but soon saw my error. From information given me, I\nexamined dried flowers of another member of the Boragineae, Arnebia\nhispidissima, collected from several sites, and though the corolla, together\nwith the included organs, differed much in length, there was no sign of\nheterostylism.]\n\nPolygonum fagopyrum (Polygonaceae).\n\n(FIGURE 3.7. Polygonum fagopyrum. (From H. Muller.)\nUpper figure, the long-styled form; lower figure, the short-styled.\nSome of the anthers have dehisced, others have not.)\n\nHildebrand has shown that this plant, the common Buck-wheat, is heterostyled.\n(3\/13. 'Die Geschlechter-Vertheilung' etc. 1867 page 34.) In the long-styled\nform (Figure 3.7), the three stigmas project considerably above the eight short\nstamens, and stand on a level with the anthers of the eight long stamens in the\nshort-styled form; and so it is conversely with the stigmas and stamens of this\nlatter form. I could perceive no difference in the structure of the stigmas in\nthe two forms. The pollen-grains of the short-styled form are to those of the\nlong-styled as 100 to 82 in diameter. This plant is therefore without doubt\nheterostyled.\n\nI experimented only in an imperfect manner on the relative fertility of the two\nforms. Short-styled flowers were dragged several times over two heads of flowers\non long-styled plants, protected under a net, which were thus legitimately,\nthough not fully, fertilised. They produced 22 seeds, or 11 per flower-head.\n\nThree flower-heads on long-styled plants received pollen in the same manner from\nother long-styled plants, and were thus illegitimately fertilised. They produced\n14 seeds, or only 4.66 per flower-head.\n\nTwo flower-heads on short-styled plants received pollen in like manner from\nlong-styled flowers, and were thus legitimately fertilised. They produced 8\nseeds, or 4 per flower-head.\n\nFour heads on short-styled plants similarly received pollen from other short-\nstyled plants, and were thus illegitimately fertilised. They produced 9 seeds,\nor 2.25 per flower-head.\n\nThe results from fertilising the flower-heads in the above imperfect manner\ncannot be fully trusted; but I may state that the four legitimately fertilised\nflower-heads yielded on an average 7.50 seeds per head; whereas the seven\nillegitimately fertilised heads yielded less than half the number, or on an\naverage only 3.28 seeds. The legitimately crossed seeds from the long-styled\nflowers were finer than those from the illegitimately fertilised flowers on the\nsame plants, in the ratio of 100 to 82, as shown by the weights of an equal\nnumber.\n\nAbout a dozen plants, including both forms, were protected under nets, and early\nin the season they produced spontaneously hardly any seeds, though at this\nperiod the artificially fertilised flowers produced an abundance; but it is a\nremarkable fact that later in the season, during September, both forms became\nhighly self-fertile. They did not, however, produce so many seeds as some\nneighbouring uncovered plants which were visited by insects. Therefore the\nflowers of neither form when left to fertilise themselves late in the season\nwithout the aid of insects, are nearly so sterile as most other heterostyled\nplants. A large number of insects, namely 41 kinds as observed by H. Muller,\nvisit the flowers for the sake of the eight drops of nectar. (3\/14. 'Die\nBefruchtung' etc. page 175 and 'Nature' January 1, 1874 page 166.) He infers\nfrom the structure of the flowers that insects would be apt to fertilise them\nboth illegitimately as well as legitimately; but he is mistaken in supposing\nthat the long-styled flowers cannot spontaneously fertilise themselves.\n\nDifferently to what occurs in the other genera hitherto noticed, Polygonum,\nthough a very large genus, contains, as far as is at present known, only a\nsingle heterostyled species, namely the present one. H. Muller in his\ninteresting description of several other species shows that P. bistorta is so\nstrongly proterandrous (the anthers generally falling off before the stigmas are\nmature) that the flowers must be cross-fertilised by the many insects which\nvisit them. Other species bear much less conspicuous flowers which secrete\nlittle or no nectar, and consequently are rarely visited by insects; these are\nadapted for self-fertilisation, though still capable of cross-fertilisation.\nAccording to Delpino, the Polygonaceae are generally fertilised by the wind,\ninstead of by insects as in the present genus.\n\n[Leucosmia Burnettiana (Thymeliae).\n\nAs Professor Asa Gray has expressed his belief that this species and L.\nacuminata, as well as some species in the allied genus Drymispermum, are\ndimorphic or heterostyled (3\/15. 'American Journal of Science' 1865 page 101 and\nSeemann's 'Journal of Botany' volume 3 1865 page 305.), I procured from Kew,\nthrough the kindness of Dr. Hooker, two dried flowers of the former species, an\ninhabitant of the Friendly Islands in the Pacific. The pistil of the long-styled\nform is to that of the short-styled as 100 to 86 in length; the stigma projects\njust above the throat of the corolla, and is surrounded by five anthers, the\ntips of which reach up almost to its base; and lower down, within the tubular\ncorolla, five other and rather smaller anthers are seated. In the short-styled\nform, the stigma stands some way down the tube of the corolla, nearly on a level\nwith the lower anthers of the other form: it differs remarkably from the stigma\nof the long-styled form, in being more papillose, and in being longer in the\nratio of 100 to 60. The anthers of the upper stamens in the short-styled form\nare supported on free filaments, and project above the throat of the corolla,\nwhilst the anthers of the lower stamens are seated in the throat on a level with\nthe upper stamens of the other form. The diameters of a considerable number of\ngrains from both sets of anthers in both forms were measured, but they did not\ndiffer in any trustworthy degree. The mean diameter of twenty-two grains from\nthe short-styled flower was to that of twenty-four grains from the long-styled,\nas 100 to 99. The anthers of the upper stamens in the short-styled form appeared\nto be poorly developed, and contained a considerable number of shrivelled grains\nwhich were omitted in striking the above average. Notwithstanding the fact of\nthe pollen-grains from the two forms not differing in diameter in any\nappreciable degree, there can hardly be a doubt from the great difference in the\ntwo forms in the length of the pistil, and especially of the stigma, together\nwith its more papillose condition in the short-styled form, that the present\nspecies is truly heterostyled. This case resembles that of Linum grandiflorum,\nin which the sole difference between the two forms consists in the length of the\npistils and stigmas. From the great length of the tubular corolla of Leucosmia,\nit is clear that the flowers are cross-fertilised by large Lepidoptera or by\nhoney-sucking birds, and the position of the stamens in two whorls one beneath\nthe other, which is a character that I have not seen in any other heterostyled\ndimorphic plant, probably serves to smear the inserted organ thoroughly with\npollen.\n\nMenyanthes trifoliata (Gentianeae).\n\nThis plant inhabits marshes: my son William gathered 247 flowers from so many\ndistinct plants, and of these 110 were long-styled, and 137 short-styled. The\npistil of the long-styled form is in length to that of the short-styled in the\nratio of about 3 to 2. The stigma of the former, as my son observed, is\ndecidedly larger than that of the short-styled; but in both forms it varies much\nin size. The stamens of the short-styled are almost double the length of those\nof the long-styled; so that their anthers stand rather above the level of the\nstigma of the long-styled form. The anthers also vary much in size, but seem\noften to be of larger size in the short-styled flowers. My son made with the\ncamera many drawings of the pollen-grains, and those from the short-styled\nflowers were in diameter in nearly the ratio of 100 to 84 to those from the\nlong-styled flowers. I know nothing about the capacity for fertilisation in the\ntwo forms; but short-styled plants, living by themselves in the gardens at Kew,\nhave produced an abundance of capsules, yet the seeds have never germinated; and\nthis looks as if the short-styled form was sterile with its own pollen.\n\nLimnanthemum Indicum (Gentianeae).\n\nThis plant is mentioned by Mr. Thwaites in his Enumeration of the Plants of\nCeylon as presenting two forms; and he was so kind as to send me specimens\npreserved in spirits. The pistil of the long-styled form is nearly thrice as\nlong (i.e. as 14 to 5) as that of the short-styled, and is very much thinner in\nthe ratio of about 3 to 5. The foliaceous stigma is more expanded, and twice as\nlarge as that of the short-styled form. In the latter the stamens are about\ntwice as long as those of the long-styled, and their anthers are larger in the\nratio of 100 to 70. The pollen-grains, after having been long kept in spirits,\nwere of the same shape and size in both forms. The ovules, according to Mr.\nThwaites, are equally numerous (namely from 70 to 80) in the two forms.\n\nVillarsia [sp.?] (Gentianeae).\n\nFritz Muller sent me from South Brazil dried flowers of this aquatic plant,\nwhich is closely allied to Limnanthemum. In the long-styled form the stigma\nstands some way above the anthers, and the whole pistil, together with the\novary, is in length to that of the short-styled form as about 3 to 2. In the\nlatter form the anthers stand above the stigma, and the style is very short and\nthick; but the pistil varies a good deal in length, the stigma being either on a\nlevel with the tips of the sepals or considerably beneath them. The foliaceous\nstigma in the long-styled form is larger, with the expansions running farther\ndown the style, than in the other form. One of the most remarkable differences\nbetween the two forms is that the anthers of the longer stamens in the short-\nstyled flowers are conspicuously longer than those of the shorter stamens in the\nlong-styled flowers. In the former the sub-triangular pollen-grains are larger;\nthe ratio between their breadth (measured from one angle to the middle of the\nopposite side) and that of the grains from the long-styled flowers being about\n100 to 75. Fritz Muller also informs me that the pollen of the short-styled\nflowers has a bluish tint, whilst that of the long-styled is yellow. When we\ntreat of Lythrum salicaria we shall find a strongly marked contrast in the\ncolour of the pollen in two of the forms.\n\nThe three genera, Menyanthes, Limnanthemum, and Villarsia, now described,\nconstitute a well-marked sub-tribe of the Gentianeae. All the species, as far as\nat present known, are heterostyled, and all inhabit aquatic or sub-aquatic\nstations.\n\nForsythia suspensa (Oleaceae).\n\nProfessor Asa Gray states that the plants of this species growing in the Botanic\nGardens at Cambridge, U.S., are short-styled, but that Siebold and Zuccarini\ndescribe the long-styled form, and give figures of two forms; so that there can\nbe little doubt, as he remarks, about the plant being dimorphic. (3\/16. 'The\nAmerican Naturalist' July 1873 page 422.) I therefore applied to Dr. Hooker, who\nsent me a dried flower from Japan, another from China, and another from the\nBotanic Gardens at Kew. The first proved to be long-styled, and the other two\nshort-styled. In the long-styled form, the pistil is in length to that of the\nshort-styled as 100 to 38, the lobes of the stigma being a little longer (as 10\nto 9), but narrower and less divergent. This last character, however, may be\nonly a temporary one. There seems to be no difference in the papillose condition\nof the two stigmas. In the short-styled form, the stamens are in length to those\nof the long-styled as 100 to 66, but the anthers are shorter in the ratio of 87\nto 100; and this is unusual, for when there is any difference in size between\nthe anthers of the two forms, those from the longer stamens of the short-styled\nare generally the longest. The pollen-grains from the short-styled flowers are\ncertainly larger, but only in a slight degree, than those from the long-styled,\nnamely, as 100 to 94 in diameter. The short-styled form, which grows in the\nGardens at Kew, has never there produced fruit.\n\nForsythia viridissima appears likewise to be heterostyled; for Professor Asa\nGray says that although the long-styled form alone grows in the gardens at\nCambridge, U.S., the published figures of this species belong to the short-\nstyled form.\n\nCordia [sp.?] (Cordiaceae).\n\nFritz Muller sent me dried specimens of this shrub, which he believes to be\nheterostyled; and I have not much doubt that this is the case, though the usual\ncharacteristic differences are not well pronounced in the two forms. Linum\ngrandiflorum shows us that a plant may be heterostyled in function in the\nhighest degree, and yet the two forms may have stamens of equal length, and\npollen-grains of equal size. In the present species of Cordia, the stamens of\nboth forms are of nearly equal length, those of the short-styled being rather\nthe longest; and the anthers of both are seated in the mouth of the corolla. Nor\ncould I detect any difference in the size of the pollen-grains, when dry or\nafter being soaked in water. The stigmas of the long-styled form stand clear\nabove the anthers, and the whole pistil is longer than that of the short-styled,\nin about the ratio of 3 to 2.\n\nThe stigmas of the short-styled form are seated beneath the anthers, and they\nare considerably shorter than those of the long-styled form. This latter\ndifference is the most important one of any between the two forms.\n\nGilia (Ipomopsis) pulchella vel aggregata (Polemoniaceae).\n\nProfessor Asa Gray remarks with respect to this plant: \"the tendency to\ndimorphism, of which there are traces, or perhaps rather incipient\nmanifestations in various portions of the genus, is most marked in G.\naggregata.\" (3\/17. 'Proceedings of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.'\nJune 14, 1870 page 275.) He sent me some dried flowers, and I procured others\nfrom Kew. They differ greatly in size, some being nearly twice as long as others\n(namely as 30 to 17), so that it was not possible to compare, except by\ncalculation, the absolute length of the organs from different plants. Moreover,\nthe relative position of the stigmas and anthers is variable: in some long-\nstyled flowers the stigmas and anthers were exserted only just beyond the throat\nof the corolla; whilst in others they were exserted as much as 4\/10 of an inch.\nI suspect also that the pistil goes on growing for some time after the anthers\nhave dehisced. Nevertheless it is possible to class the flowers under two forms.\nIn some of the long-styled, the length of pistil to that of the short-styled was\nas 100 to 82; but this result was gained by reducing the size of the corollas to\nthe same scale. In another pair of flowers the difference in length between the\npistils of the two forms was certainly greater, but they were not actually\nmeasured. In the short-styled flowers whether large or small, the stigma is\nseated low down within the tube of the corolla. The papillae on the long-styled\nstigma are longer than those on the short-styled, in the ratio of 100 to 40. The\nfilaments in some of the short-styled flowers were, to those of the long-styled,\nas 100 to 25 in length, the free, or unattached portion being alone measured;\nbut this ratio cannot be trusted, owing to the great variability of the stamens.\nThe mean diameter of eleven pollen-grains from long-styled flowers, and of\ntwelve from the short-styled, was exactly the same. It follows from these\nseveral statements, that the difference in length and state of surface of the\nstigmas in the flowers is the sole reliable evidence that this species is\nheterostyled; for it would be rash to trust to the difference in the length of\nthe pistils, seeing how variable they are. I should have left the case\naltogether doubtful, had it not been for the observations on the following\nspecies; and these leave little doubt on my mind that the present plant is truly\nheterostyled. Professor Gray informs me that in another species, G.\ncoronopifolia, belonging to the same section of the genus, he can see no sign of\ndimorphism.\n\nGilia (Leptosiphon) micrantha.\n\nA few flowers sent me from Kew had been somewhat injured, so that I cannot say\nanything positively with respect to the position and relative length of the\norgans in the two forms. But their stigmas differed almost exactly in the same\nmanner as in the last species; the papillae on the long-styled stigma being\nlonger than those on the short-styled, in the ratio of 100 to 42. My son\nmeasured nine pollen-grains from the long-styled, and the same number from the\nshort-styled form; and the mean diameter of the former was to that of the latter\nas 100 to 81. Considering this difference, as well as that between the stigmas\nof the two forms, there can be no doubt that this species is heterostyled. So\nprobably is Gilia nudicaulis, which likewise belongs to the Leptosiphon section\nof the genus, for I hear from Professor Asa Gray that in some individuals the\nstyle is very long, with the stigma more or less exserted, whilst in others it\nis deeply included within the tube; the anthers being always seated in the\nthroat of the corolla.\n\nPhlox subulata (Polemoniaceae).\n\nProfessor Asa Gray informs me that the greater number of the species in this\ngenus have a long pistil, with the stigma more or less exserted; whilst several\nother species, especially the annuals, have a short pistil seated low down\nwithin the tube of the corolla. In all the species the anthers are arranged one\nbelow the other, the uppermost just protruding from the throat of the corolla.\nIn Phlox subulata alone he has \"seen both long and short styles; and here the\nshort-styled plant has (irrespective of this character) been described as a\ndistinct species (P. nivalis, P. Hentzii), and is apt to have a pair of ovules\nin each cell, while the long-styled P. subulata rarely shows more than one.\"\n(3\/18. 'Proceedings of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences' June 14, 1870\npage 248.) Some dried flowers of both forms were sent me by him, and I received\nothers from Kew, but I have failed to make out whether the species is\nheterostyled. In two flowers of nearly equal size, the pistil of the long-styled\nform was twice as long as that of the short-styled; but in other cases the\ndifference was not nearly so great. The stigma of the long-styled pistil stands\nnearly in the throat of the corolla; whilst in the short-styled it is placed low\ndown--sometimes very low down in the tube, for it varies greatly in position.\nThe stigma is more papillose, and of greater length (in one instance in the\nratio of 100 to 67), in the short-styled flowers than in the long-styled. My son\nmeasured twenty pollen-grains from a short-styled flower, and nine from a long-\nstyled, and the former were in diameter to the latter as 100 to 93; and this\ndifference accords with the belief that the plant is heterostyled. But the\ngrains from the short-styled varied much in diameter. He afterwards measured ten\ngrains from a distinct long-styled flower, and ten from another plant of the\nsame form, and these grains differed in diameter in the ratio of 100 to 90. The\nmean diameter of these two lots of twenty grains was to that of twelve grains\nfrom another short-styled flower as 100 to 75: here, then, the grains from the\nshort-styled form were considerably smaller than those from the long-styled,\nwhich is the reverse of what occurred in the former instance, and of what is the\ngeneral rule with heterostyled plants. The whole case is perplexing in the\nhighest degree, and will not be understood until experiments are tried on living\nplants. The greater length, and more papillose condition of the stigma in the\nshort-styled than in the long-styled flowers, looks as if the plant was\nheterostyled; for we know that with some species--for instance, Leucosmia and\ncertain Rubiaceae--the stigma is longer and more papillose in the short-styled\nform, though the reverse of this holds good in Gilia, a member of the same\nfamily with Phlox. The similar position of the anthers in the two forms is\nsomewhat opposed to the present species being heterostyled; as is the great\ndifference in the length of the pistil in several short-styled flowers. But the\nextraordinary variability in diameter of the pollen-grains, and the fact that in\none set of flowers the grains from the long-styled flowers were larger than\nthose from the short-styled, is strongly opposed to the belief that Phlox\nsubulata is heterostyled. Possibly this species was once heterostyled, but is\nnow becoming sub-dioecious; the short-styled plants having been rendered more\nfeminine in nature. This would account for their ovaries usually containing more\novules, and for the variable condition of their pollen-grains. Whether the long-\nstyled plants are now changing their nature, as would appear to be the case from\nthe variability of their pollen-grains, and are becoming more masculine, I will\nnot pretend to conjecture; they might remain as hermaphrodites, for the\ncoexistence of hermaphrodite and female plants of the same species is by no\nmeans a rare event.\n\nErythroxylum [sp.?] (Erythroxylidae).\n\n(FIGURE 3.8. Erythroxylon [sp.?]\nLeft: Long-styled form.\nRight: Short-styled form.\nFrom a sketch by Fritz Muller, magnified five times.)\n\nFritz Muller sent me from South Brazil dried flowers of this tree, together with\nthe drawings (Figure 3.8.), which show the two forms, magnified about five\ntimes, with the petals removed. In the long-styled form the stigmas project\nabove the anthers, and the styles are nearly twice as long as those of the\nshort-styled form, in which the stigmas stand beneath the anthers. The stigmas\nin many, but not in all the short-styled flowers are larger than those in the\nlong-styled. The anthers of the short-styled flowers stand on a level with the\nstigmas of the other form; but the stamens are longer by only one-fourth or one-\nfifth of their own length than those of the long-styled. Consequently the\nanthers of the latter do not stand on a level with, but rather above the stigmas\nof the other form. Differently from what occurs in the following closely allied\ngenus, Sethia, the stamens are of nearly equal length in the flowers of the same\nform. The pollen-grains of the short-styled flowers, measured in their dry\nstate, are a little larger than those from the long-styled flowers in about the\nratio of 100 to 93. (3\/19. F. Muller remarks in his letter to me that the\nflowers, of which he carefully examined many specimens, are curiously variable\nin the number of their parts: 5 sepals and petals, 10 stamens and 3 pistils are\nthe prevailing numbers; but the sepals and petals often vary from 5 to 7; the\nstamens from 10 to 14, and the pistils from 3 to 4.)\n\nSethia acuminata (Erythroxylidae).\n\nMr. Thwaites pointed out several years ago that this plant exists under two\nforms, which he designated as forma stylosa et staminea; and the flowers sent to\nme by him are clearly heterostyled. (3\/20. 'Enumeratio Plantarum Zeylaniae' 1864\npage 54.) In the long-styled form the pistil is nearly twice as long, and the\nstamens half as long as the corresponding organs in the short-styled form. The\nstigmas of the long-styled seem rather smaller than those of the short-styled.\nAll the stamens in the short-styled flowers are of nearly equal length, whereas\nin long-styled they differ in length, being alternately a little longer and\nshorter; and this difference in the stamens of the two forms is probably\nrelated, as we shall hereafter see in the case of the short-styled flowers of\nLythrum salicaria, to the manner in which insects can best transport pollen from\nthe long-styled flowers to the stigmas of the short-styled. The pollen-grains\nfrom the short-styled flowers, though variable in size, are to those of the\nlong-styled, as far as I could make out, as 100 to 83 in their longer diameter.\nSethia obtusifolia is heterostyled like S. acuminata.\n\nCratoxylon formosum (Hypericineae).\n\nMr. Thiselton Dyer remarks that this tree, an inhabitant of Malacca and Borneo,\nappears to be heterostyled. (3\/21. 'Journal of Botany' London 1872 page 26.) He\nsent me dried flowers, and the difference between the two forms is conspicuous.\nIn the short-styled form the pistils are in length to those of the short-styled\nas 100 to 40, with their globular stigmas about twice as thick. These stand just\nabove the numerous anthers and a little beneath the tips of the petals. In the\nshort-styled form the anthers project high above the pistils, the stigmas of\nwhich diverge between the three bundles of stamens, and stand only a little\nabove the tips of the sepals. The stamens in this form are to those of the long-\nstyled as 100 to 86 in length; and therefore they do not differ so much in\nlength as do the pistils. Ten pollen-grains from each form were measured, and\nthose from the short-styled were to those from the long-styled as 100 to 86 in\ndiameter. This plant, therefore, is in all respects a well-characterised\nheterostyled species.\n\nAegiphila elata (Verbenaceae).\n\nMr. Bentham was so kind as to send me dried flowers of this species and of Ae.\nmollis, both inhabitants of South America. The two forms differ conspicuously,\nas the deeply bifid stigma of the one, and the anthers of the other project far\nabove the mouth of the corolla. In the long-styled form of the present species,\nthe style is twice and a half as long as that of the short-styled. The divergent\nstigmas of the two forms do not differ much in length, nor as far as I could\nperceive in their papillae. In the long-styled flowers the filaments adhere to\nthe corolla close up to the anthers, which are enclosed some way down within the\ntube. In the short-styled flowers the filaments are free above the point where\nthe anthers are seated in the other form, and they project from the corolla to\nan equal height with that of the stigmas in the long-styled flowers. It is often\ndifficult to measure with accuracy pollen-grains, which have long been dried and\nthen soaked in water; but they here manifestly differed greatly in size. Those\nfrom the short-styled flowers were to those from the long-styled in diameter in\nabout the ratio of 100 to 62. The two forms of Ae. mollis present a like\ndifference in the length of their pistils and stamens.\n\nAegiphila obdurata.\n\nFlowers of this bush were sent me from St. Catharina in Brazil, by Fritz Muller,\nand were named for me at Kew. They appeared at first sight grandly heterostyled,\nas the stigma of the long-styled form projects far out of the corolla, whilst\nthe anthers are seated halfway down within the tube; whereas in the short-styled\nform the anthers project from the corolla and the stigma is enclosed in the tube\nat nearly the same level with the anthers of the other form. The pistil of the\nlong-styled is to that of the short-styled as 100 to 60 in length, and the\nstigmas, taken by themselves, as 100 to 55. Nevertheless, this plant cannot be\nheterostyled. The anthers in the long-styled form are brown, tough, and fleshy,\nand less than half the length of those in the short-styled form, strictly as 44\nto 100; and what is much more important, they were in a rudimentary condition in\nthe two flowers examined by me, and did not contain a single grain of pollen. In\nthe short-styled form, the divided stigma, which as we have seen is much\nshortened, is thicker and more fleshy than the stigma of the long-styled, and is\ncovered with small irregular projections, formed of rather large cells. It had\nthe appearance of having suffered from hyperthrophy, and is probably incapable\nof fertilisation. If this be so the plant is dioecious, and judging from the two\nspecies previously described, it probably was once heterostyled, and has since\nbeen rendered dioecious by the pistil in the one form, and the stamens in the\nother having become functionless and reduced in size. It is, however, possible\nthat the flowers may be in the same state as those of the common thyme and of\nseveral other Labiatae, in which females and hermaphrodites regularly co-exist.\nFritz Muller, who thought that the present plant was heterostyled, as I did at\nfirst, informs me that he found bushes in several places growing quite isolated,\nand that these were completely sterile; whilst two plants growing close together\nwere covered with fruit. This fact agrees better with the belief that the\nspecies is dioecious than that it consists of hermaphrodites and females; for if\nany one of the isolated plants had been an hermaphrodite, it would probably have\nproduced some fruit.]\n\nRUBIACEAE.\n\nThis great natural family contains a much larger number of heterostyled genera\nthan any other one, as yet known.\n\nMitchella repens.\n\nProfessor Asa Gray sent me several living plants collected when out of flower,\nand nearly half of these proved long-styled, and the other half short-styled.\nThe white flowers, which are fragrant and which secrete plenty of nectar, always\ngrow in pairs with their ovaries united, so that the two together produce \"a\nberry-like double drupe.\" (3\/22. A. Gray 'Manual of the Botany of the United\nStates' 1856 page 172.) In my first series of experiments (1864) I did not\nsuppose that this curious arrangement of the flowers would have any influence on\ntheir fertility; and in several instances only one of the two flowers in a pair\nwas fertilised; and a large proportion or all of these failed to produce\nberries. In the ensuing year both flowers of each pair were invariably\nfertilised in the same manner; and the latter experiments alone serve to show\nthe proportion of flowers which yield berries, when legitimately and\nillegitimately fertilised; but for calculating the average number of seeds per\nberry I have used those produced during both seasons.\n\nIn the long-styled flowers the stigma projects just above the bearded throat of\nthe corolla, and the anthers are seated some way down the tube. In the short-\nstyled flowers those organs occupy reversed positions. In this latter form the\nfresh pollen-grains are a little larger and more opaque than those of the long-\nstyled form. The results of my experiments are given in Table 3.21.\n\nTABLE 3.21. Mitchella repens.\n\nColumn 1: Nature of the Union.\nColumn 2: Number of Pairs of Flowers fertilised during the second season.\nColumn 3: Number of Drupes produced during the second season.\nColumn 4: Average Number of good Seeds per Drupe in all the Drupes during the\ntwo Seasons.\n\nLong-styled by pollen of short-styled. Legitimate union :\n9 : 8 : 4.6.\n\nLong-styled by own-form pollen. Illegitimate union :\n8 : 3 : 2.2.\n\nShort-styled by pollen of long-styled. Legitimate union:\n8 : 7 : 4.1.\n\nShort-styled by own-form pollen. Illegitimate union :\n9 : 0 : 2.0.\n\nThe two legitimate unions together :\n17 : 15 : 4.4.\n\nThe two illegitimate unions together :\n17 : 3 : 2.1.\n\nIt follows from this table that 88 per cent of the paired flowers of both forms,\nwhen legitimately fertilised, yielded double berries, nineteen of which\ncontained on an average 4.4 seeds, with a maximum in one of 8 seeds. Of the\nillegitimately fertilised paired flowers only 18 per cent yielded berries, six\nof which contained on an average only 2.1 seeds, with a maximum in one of 4\nseeds. Thus the two legitimate unions are more fertile than the two\nillegitimate, according to the proportion of flowers which yielded berries, in\nthe ratio of 100 to 20; and according to the average number of contained seeds\nas 100 to 47.\n\nThree long-styled and three short-styled plants were protected under separate\nnets, and they produced altogether only 8 berries, containing on an average only\n1.5 seed. Some additional berries were produced which contained no seeds. The\nplants thus treated were therefore excessively sterile, and their slight degree\nof fertility may be attributed in part to the action of the many individuals of\nThrips which haunted the flowers. Mr. J. Scott informs me that a single plant\n(probably a long-styled one), growing in the Botanic Gardens at Edinburgh, which\nno doubt was freely visited by insects, produced plenty of berries, but how many\nof them contained seeds was not observed.\n\nBorreria, nov. sp. near valerianoides (Rubiaceae).\n\nFritz Muller sent me seeds of this plant, which is extremely abundant in St.\nCatharina, in South Brazil; and ten plants were raised, consisting of five long-\nstyled and five short-styled. The pistil of the long-styled flowers projects\njust beyond the mouth of the corolla, and is thrice as long as that of the\nshort-styled, and the divergent stigmas are likewise rather larger. The anthers\nin the long-styled form stand low down within the corolla, and are quite hidden.\nIn the short-styled flowers the anthers project just above the mouth of the\ncorolla, and the stigma stands low down within the tube. Considering the great\ndifference in the length of the pistils in the two forms, it is remarkable that\nthe pollen-grains differ very little in size, and Fritz Muller was struck with\nthe same fact. In a dry state the grains from the short-styled flowers could\njust be perceived to be larger than those from the long-styled, and when both\nwere swollen by immersion in water, the former were to the latter in diameter in\nthe ratio of 100 to 92. In the long-styled flowers beaded hairs almost fill up\nthe mouth of the corolla and project above it; they therefore stand above the\nanthers and beneath the stigma. In the short-styled flowers a similar brush of\nhairs is situated low down within the tubular corolla, above the stigma and\nbeneath the anthers. The presence of these beaded hairs in both forms, though\noccupying such different positions, shows that they are probably of considerable\nfunctional importance. They would serve to guard the stigma of each form from\nits own pollen; but in accordance with Professor Kerner's view their chief use\nprobably is to prevent the copious nectar being stolen by small crawling\ninsects, which could not render any service to the species by carrying pollen\nfrom one form to the other. (3\/23. 'Die Schutzmittel der Bluthen gegen\nunberufene Gaste' 1876 page 37.)\n\nThe flowers are so small and so crowded together that I was not willing to\nexpend time in fertilising them separately; but I dragged repeatedly heads of\nshort-styled flowers over three long-styled flower-heads, which were thus\nlegitimately fertilised; and they produced many dozen fruits, each containing\ntwo good seeds. I fertilised in the same manner three heads on the same long-\nstyled plant with pollen from another long-styled plant, so that these were\nfertilised illegitimately, and they did not yield a single seed. Nor did this\nplant, which was of course protected by a net, bear spontaneously any seeds.\nNevertheless another long-styled plant, which was carefully protected, produced\nspontaneously a very few seeds; so that the long-styled form is not always quite\nsterile with its own pollen.\n\nFaramea [sp.?] (Rubiaceae).\n\n(FIGURE 3.9. Faramea [sp.?]\nLeft: Short-styled form.\nRight: Long-styled form.\nOutlines of flowers from dried specimens. Pollen-grains magnified 180 times, by\nFritz Muller.)\n\nFritz Muller has fully described the two forms of this remarkable plant, an\ninhabitant of South Brazil. (3\/24. 'Botanische Zeitung' September 10, 1869 page\n606.) In the long-styled form the pistil projects above the corolla, and is\nalmost exactly twice as long as that of the short-styled, which is included\nwithin the tube. The former is divided into two rather short and broad stigmas,\nwhilst the short-styled pistil is divided into two long, thin, sometimes much\ncurled stigmas. The stamens of each form correspond in height or length with the\npistils of the other form. The anthers of the short-styled form are a little\nlarger than those of the long-styled; and their pollen-grains are to those of\nthe other form as 100 to 67 in diameter. But the pollen-grains of the two forms\ndiffer in a much more remarkable manner, of which no other instance is known;\nthose from the short-styled flowers being covered with sharp points; the smaller\nones from the long-styled being quite smooth. Fritz Muller remarks that this\ndifference between the pollen-grains of the two forms is evidently of service to\nthe plant; for the grains from the projecting stamens of the short-styled form,\nif smooth, would have been liable to be blown away by the wind, and would thus\nhave been lost; but the little points on their surfaces cause them to cohere,\nand at the same time favour their adhesion to the hairy bodies of insects, which\nmerely brush against the anthers of these stamens whilst visiting the flowers.\nOn the other hand, the smooth grains of the long-styled flowers are safely\nincluded within the tube of the corolla, so that they cannot be blown away, but\nare almost sure to adhere to the proboscis of an entering insect, which is\nnecessarily pressed close against the enclosed anthers.\n\nIt may be remembered that in the long-styled form of Linum perenne each separate\nstigma rotates on its own axis, when the flower is mature, so as to turn its\npapillose surface outwards. There can be no doubt that this movement, which is\nconfined to the long-styled form, is effected in order that the proper surface\nof the stigma should receive pollen brought by insects from the other form. Now\nwith Faramea, as Fritz Muller shows, it is the stamens which rotate on their\naxes in one of the two forms, namely, the short-styled, in order that their\npollen should be brushed off by insects and transported to the stigmas of the\nother form. In the long-styled flowers the anthers of the short enclosed stamens\ndo not rotate on their axes, but dehisce on their inner sides, as is the common\nrule with the Rubiaceae; and this is the best position for the adherence of the\npollen-grains to the proboscis of an entering insect. Fritz Muller therefore\ninfers that as the plant became heterostyled, and as the stamens of the short-\nstyled form increased in length, they gradually acquired the highly beneficial\npower of rotating on their own axes. But he has further shown, by the careful\nexamination of many flowers, that this power has not as yet been perfected; and,\nconsequently, that a certain proportion of the pollen is rendered useless,\nnamely, that from the anthers which do not rotate properly. It thus appears that\nthe development of the plant has not as yet been completed; the stamens have\nindeed acquired their proper length, but not their full and perfect power of\nrotation. (3\/25. Fritz Muller gives another instance of the want of absolute\nperfection in the flowers of another member of the Rubiaceae, namely, Posoqueria\nfragrans, which is adapted in a most wonderful manner for cross-fertilisation by\nthe agency of moths. (See 'Botanische Zeitung' 1866 Number 17.) In accordance\nwith the nocturnal habits of these insects, most of the flowers open only during\nthe night; but some open in the day, and the pollen of such flowers is robbed,\nas Fritz Muller has often seen, by humble-bees and other insects, without any\nbenefit being thus conferred on the plant.)\n\nThe several points of difference in structure between the two forms of Faramea\nare highly remarkable. Until within a recent period, if any one had been shown\ntwo plants which differed in a uniform manner in the length of their stamens and\npistils,--in the form of their stigmas,--in the manner of dehiscence and\nslightly in the size of their anthers,--and to an extraordinary degree in the\ndiameter and structure of their pollen-grains, he would have declared it\nimpossible that the two could have belonged to one and the same species.\n\n[Suteria (species unnamed in the herbarium at Kew.) (Rubiaceae).\n\nI owe to the kindness of Fritz Muller dried flowers of this plant from St.\nCatharina, in Brazil. In the long-styled form the stigma stands in the mouth of\nthe corolla, above the anthers, which latter are enclosed within the tube, but\nonly a short way down. In the short-styled form the anthers are placed in the\nmouth of the corolla above the stigma, which occupies the same position as the\nanthers in the other form, being seated only a short way down the tube.\nTherefore the pistil of the long-styled form does not exceed in length that of\nthe short-styled in nearly so great a degree as in many other Rubiaceae.\nNevertheless there is a considerable difference in the size of the pollen-grains\nin the two forms; for, as Fritz Muller informs me, those of the short-styled are\nto those of the long-styled as 100 to 75 in diameter.\n\nHoustonia coerulea (Rubiaceae).\n\nProfessor Asa Gray has been so kind as to send me an abstract of some\nobservations made by Dr. Rothrock on this plant. The pistil is exserted in the\none form and the stamens in the other, as has long been observed. The stigmas of\nthe long-styled form are shorter, stouter, and far more hispid than in the other\nform. The stigmatic hairs or papillae on the former are .04 millimetres, and on\nthe latter only .023 millimetres in length. In the short-styled form the anthers\nare larger, and the pollen-grains, when distended with water, are to those from\nthe long-styled form as 100 to 72 in diameter.\n\nSelected capsules from some long-styled plants growing in the Botanic Gardens at\nCambridge, U.S., near where plants of the other form grew, contained on an\naverage 13 seeds; but these plants must have been subjected to unfavourable\nconditions, for some long-styled plants in a state of nature yielded an average\nof 21.5 seeds per capsule. Some short-styled plants, which had been planted by\nthemselves in the Botanic Gardens, where it was not likely that they would have\nbeen visited by insects that had previously visited long-styled plants, produced\ncapsules, eleven of which were wholly sterile, but one contained 4, and another\n8 seeds. So that the short-styled form seems to be very sterile with its own\npollen. Professor Asa Gray informs me that the other North American species of\nthis genus are likewise heterostyled.\n\nOldenlandia [sp.?] (Rubiaceae).\n\nMr. J. Scott sent me from India dried flowers of a heterostyled species of this\ngenus, which is closely allied to the last. The pistil in the long-styled\nflowers is longer by about a quarter of its length, and the stamens shorter in\nabout the same proportion, than the corresponding organs in the short-styled\nflowers. In the latter the anthers are longer, and the divergent stigmas\ndecidedly longer and apparently thinner than in the long-styled form. Owing to\nthe state of the specimens, I could not decide whether the stigmatic papillae\nwere longer in the one form than in the other. The pollen-grains, distended with\nwater, from the short-styled flowers were to those from the long-styled as 100\nto 78 in diameter, as deduced from the mean of ten measurements of each kind.\n\nHedyotis [sp.?] (Rubiaceae).\n\nFritz Muller sent me from St. Catharina, in Brazil, dried flowers of a small\ndelicate species, which grows on wet sand near the edges of fresh-water pools.\nIn the long-styled form the stigma projects above the corolla, and stands on a\nlevel with the projecting anthers of the short-styled form; but in the latter\nthe stigmas stand rather beneath the level of the anthers in the other or long-\nstyled form, these being enclosed within the tube of the corolla. The pistil of\nthe long-styled form is nearly thrice as long as that of the short-styled, or,\nspeaking strictly, as 100 to 39; and the papillae on the stigma of the former\nare broader, in the ratio of 4 to 3, but whether longer than those of the short-\nstyled, I could not decide. In the short-styled form, the anthers are rather\nlarger, and the pollen-grains are to those from the long-styled flowers, as 100\nto 88 in diameter. Fritz Muller sent me a second, small-sized species, which is\nlikewise heterostyled.\n\nCoccocypselum [sp.?] (Rubiaceae).\n\nFritz Muller also sent me dried flowers of this plant from St. Catharina, in\nBrazil. The exserted stigma of the long-styled form stands a little above the\nlevel of the exserted anthers of the short-styled form; and the enclosed stigma\nof the latter also stands a little above the level of the enclosed anthers in\nthe long-styled form. The pistil of the long-styled is about twice as long as\nthat of the short-styled, with its two stigmas considerably longer, more\ndivergent, and more curled. Fritz Muller informs me that he could detect no\ndifference in the size of the pollen-grains in the two forms. Nevertheless,\nthere can be no doubt that this plant is heterostyled.\n\nLipostoma [sp.?] (Rubiaceae).\n\nDried flowers of this plant, which grows in small wet ditches in St. Catharina,\nin Brazil, were likewise sent me by Fritz Muller. In the long-styled form the\nexserted stigma stands rather above the level of the exserted anthers of the\nother form; whilst in the short-styled form it stands on a level with the\nanthers of the other form. So that the want of strict correspondence in height\nbetween the stigmas and anthers in the two forms is reversed, compared with what\noccurs in Hedyotis. The long-styled pistil is to that of the short-styled as 100\nto 36 in length; and its divergent stigmas are longer by fully one-third of\ntheir own length than those of the short-styled form. In the latter the anthers\nare a little larger, and the pollen-grains are as 100 to 80 in diameter,\ncompared with those from the long-styled form.\n\nCinchona micrantha (Rubiaceae).\n\nDried specimens of both forms of this plant were sent me from Kew. (3\/26. My\nattention was called to this plant by a drawing copied from Howard's\n'Quinologia' Table 3 given by Mr. Markham in his 'Travels in Peru' page 539.) In\nthe long-styled form the apex of the stigma stands just beneath the bases of the\nhairy lobes of the corolla; whilst the summits of the anthers are seated about\nhalfway down the tube. The pistil is in length as 100 to 38 to that of the\nshort-styled form. In the latter the anthers occupy the same position as the\nstigma of the other form, and they are considerably longer than those of the\nlong-styled form. As the summit of the stigma in the short-styled form stands\nbeneath the bases of the anthers, which are seated halfway down the corolla, the\nstyle has been extremely shortened in this form, its length to that of the long-\nstyled being, in the specimens examined, only as 5.3 to 100! The stigma, also,\nin the short-styled form is very much shorter than that in the long-styled, in\nthe ratio of 57 to 100. The pollen grains from the short-styled flowers, after\nhaving been soaked in water, were rather larger--in about the ratio of 100 to\n91--than those from the long-styled flowers, and they were more triangular, with\nthe angles more prominent. As all the grains from the short-styled flowers were\nthus characterised, and as they had been left in water for three days, I am\nconvinced that this difference in shape in the two sets of grains cannot be\naccounted for by unequal distension with water.\n\nBesides the several Rubiaceous genera already mentioned, Fritz Muller informs me\nthat two or three species of Psychotria and Rudgea eriantha, natives of St.\nCatharina, in Brazil, are heterostyled, as is Manettia bicolor. I may add that I\nformerly fertilised with their own pollen several flowers on a plant of this\nlatter species in my hothouse, but they did not set a single fruit. From Wight\nand Arnott's description, there seems to be little doubt that Knoxia in India is\nheterostyled; and Asa Gray is convinced that this is the case with Diodia and\nSpermacoce in the United States. Lastly, from Mr. W.W. Bailey's description, it\nappears that the Mexican Bouvardia leiantha is heterostyled. (3\/27. 'Bulletin of\nthe Torrey Bot. Club' 1876 page 106.)]\n\nAltogether we now know of 17 heterostyled genera in the great family of the\nRubiaceae; though more information is necessary with respect to some of them,\nmore especially those mentioned in the last paragraph, before we can feel\nabsolutely safe. In the 'Genera Plantarum,' by Bentham and Hooker, the Rubiaceae\nare divided into 25 tribes, containing 337 genera; and it deserves notice that\nthe genera now known to be heterostyled are not grouped in one or two of these\ntribes, but are distributed in no less than eight of them. From this fact we may\ninfer that most of the genera have acquired their heterostyled structure\nindependently of one another; that is, they have not inherited this structure\nfrom some one or even two or three progenitors in common. It further deserves\nnotice that in the homostyled genera, as I am informed by Professor Asa Gray,\nthe stamens are either exserted or are included within the tube of the corolla,\nin a nearly constant manner; so that this character, which is not even of\nspecific value in the heterostyled species, is often of generic value in other\nmembers of the family.\n\n\nCHAPTER IV.\n\nHETEROSTYLED TRIMORPHIC PLANTS.\n\nLythrum salicaria.\nDescription of the three forms.\nTheir power and complex manner of fertilising one another.\nEighteen different unions possible.\nMid-styled form eminently feminine in nature.\nLythrum Graefferi likewise trimorphic.\nL. thymifolia dimorphic.\nL.

Regnelli, the illegitimate unions quite barren.\nO. speciosa.\nO. sensitiva.\nHomostyled species of Oxalis.\nPontederia, the one monocotyledonous genus known to include heterostyled\nspecies.\n\nIn the previous chapters various heterostyled dimorphic plants have been\ndescribed, and now we come to heterostyled trimorphic plants, or those which\npresent three forms. These have been observed in three families, and consist of\nspecies of Lythrum and of the allied genus Nesaea, of Oxalis and Pontederia. In\ntheir manner of fertilisation these plants offer a more remarkable case than can\nbe found in any other plant or animal.\n\nLythrum salicaria.\n\n(FIGURE 4.10. Diagram of the flowers of the three forms of Lythrum salicaria, in\ntheir natural position, with the petals and calyx removed on the near side:\nenlarged six times.\nTop: Long-styled.\nMiddle: Mid-styled.\nBottom: Short-styled.\nThe dotted lines with the arrows show the directions in which pollen must be\ncarried to each stigma to ensure full fertility.)\n\nThe pistil in each form differs from that in either of the other forms, and in\neach there are two sets of stamens different in appearance and function. But one\nset of stamens in each form corresponds with a set in one of the other two\nforms. Altogether this one species includes three females or female organs and\nthree sets of male organs, all as distinct from one another as if they belonged\nto different species; and if smaller functional differences are considered,\nthere are five distinct sets of males. Two of the three hermaphrodites must\ncoexist, and pollen must be carried by insects reciprocally from one to the\nother, in order that either of the two should be fully fertile; but unless all\nthree forms coexist, two sets of stamens will be wasted, and the organisation of\nthe species, as a whole, will be incomplete. On the other hand, when all three\nhermaphrodites coexist, and pollen is carried from one to the other, the scheme\nis perfect; there is no waste of pollen and no false co-adaptation. In short,\nnature has ordained a most complex marriage-arrangement, namely a triple union\nbetween three hermaphrodites,--each hermaphrodite being in its female organ\nquite distinct from the other two hermaphrodites and partially distinct in its\nmale organs, and each furnished with two sets of males.\n\nThe three forms may be conveniently called, from the unequal lengths of their\npistils, the LONG-STYLED, MID-STYLED, and SHORT-STYLED. The stamens also are of\nunequal lengths, and these may be called the LONGEST, MID-LENGTH, and SHORTEST.\nTwo sets of stamens of different length are found in each form. The existence of\nthe three forms was first observed by Vaucher, and subsequently more carefully\nby Wirtgen ; but these botanists, not being guided by any theory or even\nsuspicion of their functional differences, did not perceive some of the most\ncurious points of difference in their structure. (4\/1. Vaucher 'Hist. Phys. des\nPlantes d'Europe' tome 2 1841 page 371. Wirtgen \"Ueber Lythrum salicaria und\ndessen Formen\" 'Verhand. des naturhist. Vereins fur preuss. Rheinl.' 5 Jahrgang\n1848 S. 7.) I will first briefly describe the three forms by the aid of Figure\n4.10, which shows the flowers, six times magnified, in their natural position,\nwith their petals and calyx on the near side removed.\n\nLONG-STYLED FORM.\n\nThis form can be at once recognised by the length of the pistil, which is\n(including the ovarium) fully one-third longer than that of the mid-styled, and\nmore than thrice as long as that of the short-styled form. It is so\ndisproportionately long, that it projects in the bud through the folded petals.\nIt stands out considerably beyond the mid-length stamens; its terminal portion\ndepends a little, but the stigma itself is slightly upturned. The globular\nstigma is considerably larger than that of the other two forms, with the\npapillae on its surface generally longer. The six mid-length stamens project\nabout two-thirds the length of the pistil, and correspond in length with the\npistil of the mid-styled form. Such correspondence in this and the two following\nforms is generally very close; the difference, where there is any, being usually\nin a slight excess of length in the stamens. The six shortest stamens lie\nconcealed within the calyx; their ends are turned up, and they are graduated in\nlength, so as to form a double row. The anthers of these stamens are smaller\nthan those of the mid-length ones. The pollen is of the same yellow colour in\nboth sets. H. Muller measured the pollen-grain in all three forms, and his\nmeasurements are evidently more trustworthy than those which I formerly made, so\nI will give them. (4\/2. 'Die Befruchtung der Blumen' 1873 page 193.) The numbers\nrefer to divisions of the micrometer equalling 1\/300 millimetres. The grains,\ndistended with water, from the mid-length stamens are 7 to 7 1\/2, and those from\nthe shortest stamens 6 to 6 1\/2 in diameter, or as 100 to 86. The capsules of\nthis form contain on an average 93 seeds: how this average was obtained will\npresently be explained. As these seeds, when cleaned, seemed larger than those\nfrom the mid-styled or short-styled forms, 100 of them were placed in a good\nbalance, and by the double method of weighing were found to equal 121 seeds of\nthe mid-styled or 142 of the short-styled; so that five long-styled seeds very\nnearly equal six mid-styled or seven short-styled seeds.\n\nMID-STYLED FORM.\n\nThe pistil occupies the position represented in Figure 4.10, with its extremity\nconsiderably upturned, but to a variable degree; the stigma is seated between\nthe anthers of the longest and the shortest stamens. The six longest stamens\ncorrespond in length with the pistil of the long-styled form; their filaments\nare coloured bright pink; the anthers are dark-coloured, but from containing\nbright-green pollen and from their early dehiscence they appear emerald-green.\nHence in general appearance these stamens are remarkably dissimilar from the\nmid-length stamens of the long-styled form. The six shortest stamens are\nenclosed within the calyx, and resemble in all respects the shortest stamens of\nthe long-styled form; both these sets correspond in length with the short pistil\nof the short-styled form. The green pollen-grains of the longest stamens are 9\nto 10 in diameter, whilst the yellow grains from the shortest stamens are only\n6; or as 100 to 63. But the pollen-grains from different plants appeared to me,\nin this case and others, to be in some degree variable in size. The capsules\ncontain on an average 130 seeds; but perhaps, as we shall see, this is rather\ntoo high an average. The seeds themselves, as before remarked, are smaller than\nthose of the long-styled form.\n\nSHORT-STYLED FORM.\n\nThe pistil is here very short, not one-third of the length of that of the long-\nstyled form. It is enclosed within the calyx, which, differently from that in\nthe other two forms, does not enclose any anthers. The end of the pistil is\ngenerally bent upwards at right angles. The six longest stamens, with their pink\nfilaments and green pollen, resemble the corresponding stamens of the mid-styled\nform. But according to H. Muller, their pollen-grains are a little larger,\nnamely 9 1\/2 to 10 1\/2, instead of 9 to 10 in diameter. The six mid-length\nstamens, with their uncoloured filaments and yellow pollen, resemble in the size\nof their pollen-grains and in all other respects the corresponding stamens of\nthe long-styled form. The difference in diameter between the grains from the two\nsets of anthers in the short-styled form is as 100 to 73. The capsules contain\nfewer seeds on an average than those of either of the preceding forms, namely\n83.5; and the seeds are considerably smaller. In this latter respect, but not in\nnumber, there is a gradation parallel to that in the length of the pistil, the\nlong-styled having the largest seeds, the mid-styled the next in size, and the\nshort-styled the smallest.\n\nWe thus see that this plant exists under three female forms, which differ in the\nlength and curvature of the style, in the size and state of the stigma, and in\nthe number and size of the seed. There are altogether thirty-six males or\nstamens, and these can be divided into three sets of a dozen each, differing\nfrom one another in length, curvature, and colour of the filaments--in the size\nof the anthers, and especially in the colour and diameter of the pollen-grains.\nEach form bears half-a-dozen of one kind of stamens and half-a-dozen of another\nkind, but not all three kinds. The three kinds of stamens correspond in length\nwith the three pistils: the correspondence is always between half of the stamens\nin two of the forms with the pistil of the third form. Table 4.a of the\ndiameters of the pollen-grains, after immersion in water, from both sets of\nstamens in all three forms is copied from H. Muller; they are arranged in the\norder of their size:--\n\nTABLE 4.a. Lythrum salicaria. Diameters of pollen-grains after immersion in\nwater.\n\nColumn 1: Source of Pollen-grains.\nColumn 2: Minimum diameter.\nColumn 3: Maximum diameter.\n\nLongest stamens of short-styled form : 9 1\/2 : 10 1\/2.\nLongest stamens of mid-styled form : 9 : 10.\nMid-length stamens of long-styled form : 7 : 7 1\/2.\nMid-length stamens of short-styled form : 7 : 7 1\/2.\nShortest stamens of long-styled form : 6 : 6 1\/2.\nShortest stamens of mid-styled form : 6 : 6.\n\nWe here see that the largest pollen-grains come from the longest stamens, and\nthe least (smallest) from the shortest; the extreme difference in diameter\nbetween them being as 100 to 60.\n\nThe average number of seeds in the three forms was ascertained by counting them\nin eight fine selected capsules taken from plants growing wild, and the result\nwas, as we have seen, for the long-styled (neglecting decimals) 93, mid-styled\n130, and short-styled 83. I should not have trusted in these ratios had I not\npossessed a number of plants in my garden which, owing to their youth, did not\nyield the full complement of seed, but were of the same age and grew under the\nsame conditions, and were freely visited by bees. I took six fine capsules from\neach, and found the average to be for the long-styled 80, for the mid-styled 97,\nand for the short-styled 61. Lastly, legitimate unions effected by me between\nthe three forms gave, as may be seen in the following tables, for the long-\nstyled an average of 90 seeds, for the mid-styled 117, and for the short-styled\n71. So that we have good concurrent evidence of a difference in the average\nproduction of seed by the three forms. To show that the unions effected by me\noften produced their full effect and may be trusted, I may state that one mid-\nstyled capsule yielded 151 good seeds, which is the same number as in the finest\nwild capsule which I examined. Some artificially fertilised short- and long-\nstyled capsules produced a greater number of seeds than was ever observed by me\nin wild plants of the same forms, but then I did not examine many of the latter.\nThis plant, I may add, offers a remarkable instance, how profoundly ignorant we\nare of the life-conditions of a species. Naturally it grows \"in wet ditches,\nwatery places, and especially on the banks of streams,\" and though it produces\nso many minute seeds, it never spreads on the adjoining land; yet, when planted\nin my garden, on clayey soil lying over chalk, and which is so dry that a rush\ncannot be found, it thrives luxuriantly, grows to above 6 feet in height,\nproduces self-sown seedlings, and (which is a severer test) is as fertile as in\na state of nature. Nevertheless it would be almost a miracle to find this plant\ngrowing spontaneously on such land as that in my garden.\n\nAccording to Vaucher and Wirtgen, the three forms coexist in all parts of\nEurope. Some friends gathered for me in North Wales a number of twigs from\nseparate plants growing near one another, and classified them. My son did the\nsame in Hampshire, and here is the result:--\n\nTABLE 4.22. Lythrum salicaria. Classification according to form of flower.\n\nColumn 1: Place of origin.\nColumn 2: Long-styled.\nColumn 3: Mid-styled.\nColumn 4: Short-styled.\nColumn 5: Total.\n\nNorth Wales : 95 : 97 : 72 : 264.\nHampshire : 53 : 38 : 38 : 129.\nTotal : 148 : 135 : 110 : 393.\n\nIf twice or thrice the number had been collected, the three forms would probably\nhave been found nearly equal; I infer this from considering the above figures,\nand from my son telling me that if he had collected in another spot, he felt\nsure that the mid-styled plants would have been in excess. I several times sowed\nsmall parcels of seed, and raised all three forms; but I neglected to record the\nparent-form, excepting in one instance, in which I raised from short-styled seed\ntwelve plants, of which only one turned out long-styled, four mid-styled, and\nseven short-styled.\n\nTwo plants of each form were protected from the access of insects during two\nsuccessive years, and in the autumn they yielded very few capsules and presented\na remarkable contrast with the adjoining uncovered plants, which were densely\ncovered with capsules. In 1863 a protected long-styled plant produced only five\npoor capsules; two mid-styled plants produced together the same number; and two\nshort-styled plants only a single one. These capsules contained very few seeds;\nyet the plants were fully productive when artificially fertilised under the net.\nIn a state of nature the flowers are incessantly visited for their nectar by\nhive- and other bees, various Diptera and Lepidoptera. (4\/3. H. Muller gives a\nlist of the species 'Die Befruchtung der Blumen' page 196. It appears that one\nbee, the Cilissa melanura, almost confines its visits to this plant.) The nectar\nis secreted all round the base of the ovarium; but a passage is formed along the\nupper and inner side of the flower by the lateral deflection (not represented in\nthe diagram) of the basal portions of the filaments; so that insects invariably\nalight on the projecting stamens and pistil, and insert their proboscides along\nthe upper and inner margin of the corolla. We can now see why the ends of the\nstamens with their anthers, and the ends of the pistils with their stigmas, are\na little upturned, so that they may be brushed by the lower hairy surfaces of\nthe insects' bodies. The shortest stamens which lie enclosed within the calyx of\nthe long- and mid-styled forms can be touched only by the proboscis and narrow\nchin of a bee; hence they have their ends more upturned, and they are graduated\nin length, so as to fall into a narrow file, sure to be raked by the thin\nintruding proboscis. The anthers of the longer stamens stand laterally farther\napart and are more nearly on the same level, for they have to brush against the\nwhole breadth of the insect's body. In very many other flowers the pistil, or\nthe stamens, or both, are rectangularly bent to one side of the flower. This\nbending may be permanent, as with Lythrum and many others, or may be effected,\nas in Dictamnus fraxinella and others, by a temporary movement, which occurs in\nthe case of the stamens when the anthers dehisce, and in the case of the pistil\nwhen the stigma is mature; but these two movements do not always take place\nsimultaneously in the same flower. Now I have found no exception to the rule,\nthat when the stamens and pistil are bent, they bend to that side of the flower\nwhich secretes nectar, even though there be a rudimentary nectary of large size\non the opposite side, as in some species of Corydalis. When nectar is secreted\non all sides, they bend to that side where the structure of the flower allows\nthe easiest access to it, as in Lythrum, various Papilionaceae, and others. The\nrule consequently is, that when the pistils and stamens are curved or bent, the\nstigma and anthers are thus brought into the pathway leading to the nectary.\nThere are a few cases which seem to be exceptions to this rule, but they are not\nso in truth; for instance, in the Gloriosa lily, the stigma of the grotesque and\nrectangularly bent pistil is brought, not into any pathway from the outside\ntowards the nectar-secreting recesses of the flower, but into the circular route\nwhich insects follow in proceeding from one nectary to the other. In\nScrophularia aquatica the pistil is bent downwards from the mouth of the\ncorolla, but it thus strikes the pollen-dusted breast of the wasps which\nhabitually visit these ill-scented flowers. In all these cases we see the\nsupreme dominating power of insects on the structure of flowers, especially of\nthose which have irregular corollas. Flowers which are fertilised by the wind\nmust of course be excepted; but I do not know of a single instance of an\nirregular flower which is thus fertilised.\n\nAnother point deserves notice. In each of the three forms two sets of stamens\ncorrespond in length with the pistils in the other two forms. When bees suck the\nflowers, the anthers of the longest stamens, bearing the green pollen, are\nrubbed against the abdomen and the inner sides of the hind legs, as is likewise\nthe stigma of the long-styled form. The anthers of the mid-length stamens and\nthe stigma of the mid-styled form are rubbed against the under side of the\nthorax and between the front pair of legs. And, lastly, the anthers of the\nshortest stamens and the stigma of the short-styled form are rubbed against the\nproboscis and chin: for the bees in sucking the flowers insert only the front\npart of their heads into the flower. On catching bees, I observed much green\npollen on the inner sides of the hind legs and on the abdomen, and much yellow\npollen on the under side of the thorax. There was also pollen on the chin, and,\nit may be presumed, on the proboscis, but this was difficult to observe. I had,\nhowever, independent proof that pollen is carried on the proboscis; for a small\nbranch of a protected short-styled plant (which produced spontaneously only two\ncapsules) was accidentally left during several days pressing against the net,\nand bees were seen inserting their proboscides through the meshes, and in\nconsequence numerous capsules were formed on this one small branch. From these\nseveral facts it follows that insects will generally carry the pollen of each\nform from the stamens to the pistil of corresponding length; and we shall\npresently see the importance of this adaptation. It must not, however, be\nsupposed that the bees do not get more or less dusted all over with the several\nkinds of pollen; for this could be seen to occur with the green pollen from the\nlongest stamens. Moreover a case will presently be given of a long-styled plant\nproducing an abundance of capsules, though growing quite by itself, and the\nflowers must have been fertilised by their own kinds of pollen; but these\ncapsules contained a very poor average of seed. Hence insects, and chiefly bees,\nact both as general carriers of pollen, and as special carriers of the right\nsort.\n\nWirtgen remarks on the variability of this plant in the branching of the stem,\nin the length of the bracteae, size of the petals, and in several other\ncharacters. (4\/4. 'Verhand. des naturhist. Vereins fur Pr. Rheinl.' 5 Jahrgang\n1848 pages 11, 13.) The plants which grew in my garden had their leaves, which\ndiffered much in shape, arranged oppositely, alternately, or in whorls of three.\nIn this latter case the stems were hexagonal; those of the other plants being\nquadrangular. But we are concerned chiefly, with the reproductive organs: the\nupward bending of the pistil is variable, and especially in the short-styled\nform, in which it is sometimes straight, sometimes slightly curved, but\ngenerally bent at right angles. The stigma of the long-styled pistil frequently\nhas longer papillae or is rougher than that of the mid-styled, and the latter\nthan that of the short-styled; but this character, though fixed and uniform in\nthe two forms of Primula veris, etc., is here variable, for I have seen mid-\nstyled stigmas rougher than those of the long-styled. (4\/5. The plants which I\nobserved grew in my garden, and probably varied rather more than those growing\nin a state of nature. H. Muller has described the stigmas of all three forms\nwith great care, and he appears to have found the stigmatic papillae differing\nconstantly in length and structure in the three forms, being longest in the\nlong-styled form.) The degree to which the longest and mid-length stamens are\ngraduated in length and have their ends upturned is variable; sometimes all are\nequally long. The colour of the green pollen in the longest stamens is variable,\nbeing sometimes pale greenish-yellow; in one short-styled plant it was almost\nwhite. The grains vary a little in size: I examined one short-styled plant with\nthe grains from the mid-length and shortest anthers of the same size. We here\nsee great variability in many important characters; and if any of these\nvariations were of service to the plant, or were correlated with useful\nfunctional differences, the species is in that state in which natural selection\nmight readily do much for its modification.\n\nON THE POWER OF MUTUAL FERTILISATION BETWEEN THE THREE FORMS.\n\nNothing shows more clearly the extraordinary complexity of the reproductive\nsystem of this plant, than the necessity of making eighteen distinct unions in\norder to ascertain the relative fertilising power of the three forms. Thus the\nlong-styled form has to be fertilised with pollen from its own two kinds of\nanthers, from the two in the mid-styled, and from the two in the short-styled\nform. The same process has to be repeated with the mid-styled and short-styled\nforms. It might have been thought sufficient to have tried on each stigma the\ngreen pollen, for instance, from either the mid- or short-styled longest\nstamens, and not from both; but the result proves that this would have been\ninsufficient, and that it was necessary to try all six kinds of pollen on each\nstigma. As in fertilising flowers there will always be some failures, it would\nhave been advisable to have repeated each of the eighteen unions a score of\ntimes; but the labour would have been too great; as it was, I made 223 unions,\ni.e. on an average I fertilised above a dozen flowers in the eighteen different\nmethods. Each flower was castrated; the adjoining buds had to be removed, so\nthat the flowers might be safely marked with thread, wool, etc.; and after each\nfertilisation the stigma was examined with a lens to see that there was\nsufficient pollen on it. Plants of all three forms were protected during two\nyears by large nets on a framework; two plants were used during one or both\nyears, in order to avoid any individual peculiarity in a particular plant. As\nsoon as the flowers had withered, the nets were removed; and in the autumn the\ncapsules were daily inspected and gathered, the ripe seeds being counted under\nthe microscope. I have given these details that confidence may be placed in the\nfollowing tables, and as some excuse for two blunders which, I believe, were\nmade. These blunders are referred to, with their probable cause, in two\nfootnotes to the tables. The erroneous numbers, however, are entered in the\ntables, that it may not be supposed that I have in any one instance tampered\nwith the results.\n\nA few words explanatory of the three tables must be given. Each is devoted to\none of the three forms, and is divided into six compartments. The two upper ones\nin each table show the number of good seeds resulting from the application to\nthe stigma of pollen from the two sets of stamens which correspond in length\nwith the pistil of that form, and which are borne by the other two forms. Such\nunions are of a legitimate nature. The two next lower compartments show the\nresult of the application of pollen from the two sets of stamens, not\ncorresponding in length with the pistil, and which are borne by the other two\nforms. These unions are illegitimate. The two lowest compartments show the\nresult of the application of each form's own two kinds of pollen from the two\nsets of stamens belonging to the same form, and which do not equal the pistil in\nlength. These unions are likewise illegitimate. The term own-form pollen here\nused does not mean pollen from the flower to be fertilised--for this was never\nused--but from another flower on the same plant, or more commonly from a\ndistinct plant of the same form. The figure \"0\" means that no capsule was\nproduced, or if a capsule was produced that it contained no good seed. In some\npart of each row of figures in each compartment, a short horizontal line may be\nseen; the unions above this line were made in 1862, and below it in 1863. It is\nof importance to observe this, as it shows that the same general result was\nobtained during two successive years; but more especially because 1863 was a\nvery hot and dry season, and the plants had occasionally to be watered. This did\nnot prevent the full complement of seed being produced from the more fertile\nunions; but it rendered the less fertile ones even more sterile than they\notherwise would have been. I have seen striking instances of this fact in making\nillegitimate and legitimate unions with Primula; and it is well known that the\nconditions of life must be highly favourable to give any chance of success in\nproducing hybrids between species which are crossed with difficulty.\n\nTABLE 4.23.

In 1863 I tried a much better experiment: a\nlong-styled plant was grown by itself, miles away from any other plant, so that\nthe flowers could have received only their own two kinds of pollen. The flowers\nwere incessantly visited by bees, and their stigmas must have received\nsuccessive applications of pollen on the most favourable days and at the most\nfavourable hours: all who have crossed plants know that this highly favours\nfertilisation. This plant produced an abundant crop of capsules; I took by\nchance 20 capsules, and these contained seeds in number as follows:--\n\n   20   20   35   21   19\n   26   24   12   23   10\n    7   30   27   29   13\n   20   12   29   19   35\n\nThis gives an average of 21.5 seeds per capsule. As we know that the long-styled\nform, when standing near plants of the other two forms and fertilised by\ninsects, produces on an average 93 seeds per capsule, we see that this form,\nfertilised by its own two pollens, yields only between one-fourth and one-fifth\nof the full number of seed. I have spoken as if the plant had received both its\nown kinds of pollen, and this is, of course, possible; but, from the enclosed\nposition of the shortest stamens, it is much more probable that the stigma\nreceived exclusively pollen from the mid-length stamens; and this, as may be\nseen in Table 4.23.5, is the more fertile of the two self-unions.\n\nTABLE 4.24. Lythrum salicaria, mid-styled form.\n\nTABLE 4.24.1. Legitimate union.\n\n12 flowers fertilised by the mid-length stamens of the long-styled.

The flowers to be fertilised by their own longest stamens\nwere first marked by \"white thread,\" and those by the mid-length stamens of the\nlong-styled form by \"white silk;\" a flower fertilised in the later manner would\nhave yielded about 136 seeds, and it may be observed that one such pod is\nmissing, namely at the bottom of Table 4.24.1. Therefore I have hardly any doubt\nthat I fertilised a flower marked with \"white thread\" as if it had been marked\nwith \"white silk.\" With respect to the capsule which yielded 92 seeds, in the\nsame column with that which yielded 136, I do not know what to think. I\nendeavoured to prevent pollen dropping from an upper to a lower flower, and I\ntried to remember to wipe the pincers carefully after each fertilisation; but in\nmaking eighteen different unions, sometimes on windy days, and pestered by bees\nand flies buzzing about, some few errors could hardly be avoided. One day I had\nto keep a third man by me all the time to prevent the bees visiting the\nuncovered plants, for in a few seconds' time they might have done irreparable\nmischief. It was also extremely difficult to exclude minute Diptera from the\nnet. In 1862 I made the great mistake of placing a mid-styled and long-styled\nunder the same huge net: in 1863 I avoided this error.)\n\nExcluding the capsule with 136 seeds, 25 percent of the flowers yielded\ncapsules, and each capsule contained, on an average, 54.6 seeds; or, excluding\ncapsules with less than 20 seeds, the average is 77.5.\n\nTABLE 4.24.6.

Flowers to be thus fertilised were marked with black\nsilk; those with pollen from the mid-length stamens of the short-styled with\nblack thread; and thus probably the mistake arose.)\n\nToo sterile for any average.\n\nBesides the experiments in the table, I fertilised a number of flowers without\nparticular care with their own two kinds of pollen, but they did not produce a\nsingle capsule.\n\nSUMMARY OF THE RESULTS.\n\nLONG-STYLED FORM.\n\nTwenty-six flowers fertilised legitimately by the stamens of corresponding\nlength, borne by the mid-and short-styled forms, yielded 61.5 per cent of\ncapsules, which contained on an average 89.7 seeds.\n\nTwenty-six long-styled flowers fertilised illegitimately by the other stamens of\nthe mid-and short-styled forms yielded only two very poor capsules.\n\nThirty long-styled flowers fertilised illegitimately by their own-form two sets\nof stamens yielded only eight very poor capsules; but long-styled flowers\nfertilised by bees with pollen from their own stamens produced numerous capsules\ncontaining on an average 21.5 seeds.\n\nMID-STYLED FORM.\n\nTwenty-four flowers legitimately fertilised by the stamens of corresponding\nlength, borne by the long and short-styled forms, yielded 96 (probably 100) per\ncent of capsules, which contained (excluding one capsule with 12 seeds) on an\naverage 117.2 seeds.\n\nFifteen mid-styled flowers fertilised illegitimately by the longest stamens of\nthe short-styled form yielded 93 per cent of capsules, which (excluding four\ncapsules with less than 20 seeds) contained on an average 102.8 seeds.\n\nThirteen mid-styled flowers fertilised illegitimately by the mid-length stamens\nof the long-styled form yielded 54 per cent of capsules, which (excluding one\nwith 19 seeds) contained on an average 60.2 seeds.\n\nTwelve mid-styled flowers fertilised illegitimately by their own-form longest\nstamens yielded 25 per cent of capsules, which (excluding one with 9 seeds)\ncontained on an average 77.5 seeds.\n\nTwelve mid-styled flowers fertilised illegitimately by their own-form shortest\nstamens yielded not a single capsule.\n\nSHORT-STYLED FORM.\n\nTwenty-five flowers fertilised legitimately by the stamens of corresponding\nlength, borne by the long and mid-styled forms, yielded 72 per cent of capsules,\nwhich (excluding one capsule with only 9 seeds) contained on an average 70.8\nseeds.\n\nTwenty short-styled flowers fertilised illegitimately by the other stamens of\nthe long and mid-styled forms yielded only two very poor capsules.\n\nTwenty short-styled flowers fertilised illegitimately by their own stamens\nyielded only two poor (or perhaps three) capsules.\n\nIf we take all six legitimate unions together, and all twelve illegitimate\nunions together, we get the following results:\n\nTABLE 4.26.\n\nColumn 1: Nature of union.\nColumn 2: Number of Flowers fertilised.\nColumn 3: Number of Capsules produced.\nColumn 4: Average Number of Seeds per Capsule.\nColumn 5: Average Number of Seeds per Flower fertilised.\n\nThe six legitimate unions : 75 : 56 : 96.29 : 71.89.\nThe twelve illegitimate unions : 146 : 36 : 44.72 : 11.03.\n\nTherefore the fertility of the legitimate unions to that of the illegitimate, as\njudged by the proportion of the fertilised flowers which yielded capsules, is as\n100 to 33; and judged by the average number of seeds per capsule, as 100 to 46.\n\nFrom this summary and the several foregoing tables we see that it is only pollen\nfrom the longest stamens which can fully fertilise the longest pistil; only that\nfrom the mid-length stamens, the mid-length pistil; and only that from the\nshortest stamens, the shortest pistil. And now we can comprehend the meaning of\nthe almost exact correspondence in length between the pistil in each form and a\nset of six stamens in two of the other forms; for the stigma of each form is\nthus rubbed against that part of the insect's body which becomes charged with\nthe proper pollen. It is also evident that the stigma of each form, fertilised\nin three different ways with pollen from the longest, mid-length, and shortest\nstamens, is acted on very differently, and conversely that the pollen from the\ntwelve longest, twelve mid-length, and twelve shortest stamens acts very\ndifferently on each of the three stigmas; so that there are three sets of female\nand of male organs. Moreover, in most cases the six stamens of each set differ\nsomewhat in their fertilising power from the six corresponding ones in one of\nthe other forms. We may further draw the remarkable conclusion that the greater\nthe inequality in length between the pistil and the set of stamens, the pollen\nof which is employed for its fertilisation, by so much is the sterility of the\nunion increased. There are no exceptions to this rule. To understand what\nfollows the reader should look to Tables 4.23, 4.24 and 4.25, and to the diagram\nFigure 4.10. In the long-styled form the short stamens obviously differ in\nlength from the pistil to a greater degree than do the mid-length stamens; and\nthe capsules produced by the use of pollen from the shortest stamens contain\nfewer seeds than those produced by the pollen from the mid-length stamens. The\nsame result follows with the long-styled form, from the use of the pollen of\nshortest stamens of the mid-styled form and of the mid-length stamens of the\nshort-styled form. The same rule also holds good with the mid-styled and short-\nstyled forms, when illegitimately fertilised with pollen from the stamens more\nor less unequal in length to their pistils. Certainly the difference in\nsterility in these several cases is slight; but, as far as we are enabled to\njudge, it always increases with the increasing inequality of length between the\npistil and the stamens which are used in each case.\n\nThe correspondence in length between the pistil in each form and a set of\nstamens in the other two forms, is probably the direct result of adaptation, as\nit is of high service to the species by leading to full and legitimate\nfertilisation. But the rule of the increased sterility of the illegitimate\nunions according to the greater inequality in length between the pistils and\nstamens employed for the union can be of no service. With some heterostyled\ndimorphic plants the difference of fertility between the two illegitimate unions\nappears at first sight to be related to the facility of self-fertilisation; so\nthat when from the position of the parts the liability in one form to self-\nfertilisation is greater than in the other, a union of this kind has been\nchecked by having been rendered the more sterile of the two. But this\nexplanation does not apply to Lythrum; thus the stigma of the long-styled form\nis more liable to be illegitimately fertilised with pollen from its own mid-\nlength stamens, or with pollen from the mid-length stamens of the short-styled\nform, than by its own shortest stamens or those of the mid-styled form; yet the\ntwo former unions, which it might have been expected would have been guarded\nagainst by increased sterility, are much less likely to be effected. The same\nrelation holds good even in a more striking manner with the mid-styled form, and\nwith the short-styled form as far as the extreme sterility of all its\nillegitimate unions allows of any comparison. We are led, therefore, to conclude\nthat the rule of increased sterility in accordance with increased inequality in\nlength between the pistils and stamens, is a purposeless result, incidental on\nthose changes through which the species has passed in acquiring certain\ncharacters fitted to ensure the legitimate fertilisation of the three forms.\n\nAnother conclusion which may be drawn from Tables 4.23, 4.24, and 4.25, even\nfrom a glance at them, is that the mid-styled form differs from both the others\nin its much higher capacity for fertilisation in various ways. Not only did the\ntwenty-four flowers legitimately fertilised by the stamens of corresponding\nlengths, all, or all but one, yield capsules rich in seed; but of the other four\nillegitimate unions, that by the longest stamens of the short-styled form was\nhighly fertile, though less so than the two legitimate unions, and that by the\nmid-length stamens of the long-styled form was fertile to a considerable degree;\nthe remaining two illegitimate unions, namely, with this form's own pollen, were\nsterile, but in different degrees. So that the mid-styled form, when fertilised\nin the six different possible methods, evinces five grades of fertility. By\ncomparing Tables 4.24.3 and 4.24.6 we may see that the action of the pollen from\nthe shortest stamens of the long-styled and mid-styled forms is widely\ndifferent; in the one case above half the fertilised flowers yielded capsules\ncontaining a fair number of seeds; in the other case not one capsule was\nproduced. So, again, the green, large-grained pollen from the longest stamens of\nthe short-styled and mid-styled forms (in Tables 4.24.4 and 4.24.5) is widely\ndifferent. In both these cases the difference in action is so plain that it\ncannot be mistaken, but it can be corroborated. If we look to Table 4.25 to the\nlegitimate action of the shortest stamens of the long- and mid-styled forms on\nthe short-styled form, we again see a similar but slighter difference, the\npollen of the shortest stamens of the mid-styled form yielding a smaller average\nof seed during the two years of 1862 and 1863 than that from the shortest\nstamens of the long-styled form. Again, if we look to Table 4.23, to the\nlegitimate action on the long-styled form of the green pollen of the two sets of\nlongest stamens, we shall find exactly the same result, namely, that the pollen\nfrom the longest stamens of the mid-styled form yielded during both years fewer\nseeds than that from the longest stamens of the short-styled form. Hence it is\ncertain that the two kinds of pollen produced by the mid-styled form are less\npotent than the two similar kinds of pollen produced by the corresponding\nstamens of the other two forms.\n\nIn close connection with the lesser potency of the two kinds of pollen of the\nmid-styled form is the fact that, according to H. Muller, the grains of both are\na little less in diameter than the corresponding grains produced by the other\ntwo forms. Thus the grains from the longest stamens of the mid-styled form are 9\nto 10, whilst those from the corresponding stamens of the short-styled form are\n9 1\/2 to 10 1\/2 in diameter. So, again, the grains from the shortest stamens of\nthe mid-styled are 6, whilst those from the corresponding stamens of the long-\nstyled are 6 to 6 1\/2 in diameter. It would thus appear as if the male organs of\nthe mid-styled form, though not as yet rudimentary, were tending in this\ndirection. On the other hand, the female organs of this form are in an eminently\nefficient state, for the naturally fertilised capsules yielded a considerably\nlarger average number of seeds than those of the other two forms--almost every\nflower which was artificially fertilised in a legitimate manner produced a\ncapsule--and most of the illegitimate unions were highly productive. The mid-\nstyled form thus appears to be highly feminine in nature; and although, as just\nremarked, it is impossible to consider its two well-developed sets of stamens\nwhich produce an abundance of pollen as being in a rudimentary condition, yet we\ncan hardly avoid connecting as balanced the higher efficiency of the female\norgans in this form with the lesser efficiency and lesser size of its two kinds\nof pollen-grains. The whole case appears to me a very curious one.\n\nIt may be observed in Tables 4.23 to 4.25 that some of the illegitimate unions\nyielded during neither year a single seed; but, judging from the long-styled\nplants, it is probable, if such unions were to be effected repeatedly by the aid\nof insects under the most favourable conditions, some few seeds would be\nproduced in every case. Anyhow, it is certain that in all twelve illegitimate\nunions the pollen-tubes penetrated the stigma in the course of eighteen hours.\nAt first I thought that two kinds of pollen placed together on the same stigma\nwould perhaps yield more seed than one kind by itself; but we have seen that\nthis is not so with each form's own two kinds of pollen; nor is it probable in\nany case, as I occasionally got, by the use of a single kind of pollen, fully as\nmany seeds as a capsule naturally fertilised ever produces. Moreover the pollen\nfrom a single anther is far more than sufficient to fertilise fully a stigma;\nhence, in this as with so many other plants, more than twelve times as much of\neach kind of pollen is produced as is necessary to ensure the full fertilisation\nof each form. From the dusted condition of the bodies of the bees which I caught\non the flowers, it is probable that pollen of various kinds is often deposited\non all three stigmas; but from the facts already given with respect to the two\nforms of Primula, there can hardly be a doubt that pollen from the stamens of\ncorresponding length placed on a stigma would be prepotent over any other kind\nof pollen and obliterate its effects,--even if the latter had been placed on the\nstigma some hours previously.\n\nFinally, it has now been shown that Lythrum salicaria presents the extraordinary\ncase of the same species bearing three females, different in structure and\nfunction, and three or even five sets (if minor differences are considered) of\nmales; each set consisting of half-a-dozen, which likewise differ from one\nanother in structure and function.\n\n[Lythrum Graefferi.\n\nI have examined numerous dried flowers of this species, each from a separate\nplant, sent me from Kew. Like L. salicaria, it is trimorphic, and the three\nforms apparently occur in about equal numbers. In the long-styled form the\npistil projects about one-third of the length of the calyx beyond its mouth, and\nis therefore relatively much shorter than in L. salicaria; the globose and\nhirsute stigma is larger than that of the other two forms; the six mid-length\nstamens, which are graduated in length, have their anthers standing close above\nand close beneath the mouth of the calyx; the six shortest stamens rise rather\nabove the middle of the calyx. In the mid-styled form the stigma projects just\nabove the mouth of the calyx, and stands almost on a level with the mid-length\nstamens of the long and short-styled forms; its own longest stamens project well\nabove the mouth of the calyx, and stand a little above the level of the stigma\nof the long-styled form. In short, without entering on further details, there is\na close general correspondence in structure between this species and L.\nsalicaria, but with some differences in the proportional lengths of the parts.\nThe fact of each of the three pistils having two sets of stamens of\ncorresponding lengths, borne by the two other forms, comes out conspicuously. In\nthe mid-styled form the pollen-grains from the longest stamens are nearly double\nthe diameter of those from the shortest stamens; so that there is a greater\ndifference in this respect than in L. salicaria. In the long-styled form, also,\nthe difference in diameter between the pollen-grains of the mid-length and\nshortest stamens is greater than in L. salicaria. These comparisons, however,\nmust be received with caution, as they were made on specimens soaked in water\nafter having been long kept dry.\n\nLythrum thymifolia.\n\nThis form, according to Vaucher, is dimorphic, like Primula, and therefore\npresents only two forms. (4\/8. 'Hist. Phys. des Plantes d'Europe' tome 2 1841\npages 369, 371.) I received two dried flowers from Kew, which consisted of the\ntwo forms; in one the stigma projected far beyond the calyx, in the other it was\nincluded within the calyx; in this latter form the style was only one-fourth of\nthe length of that in the other form. There are only six stamens; these are\nsomewhat graduated in length, and their anthers in the short-styled form stand a\nlittle above the stigma, but yet by no means equal in length the pistil of the\nlong-styled form. In the latter the stamens are rather shorter than those in the\nother form. The six stamens alternate with the petals, and therefore correspond\nhomologically with the longest stamens of L. salicaria and L. Graefferi.\n\nLythrum hyssopifolia.\n\nThis species is said by Vaucher, but I believe erroneously, to be dimorphic. I\nhave examined dried flowers from twenty-two separate plants from various\nlocalities, sent to me by Mr. Hewett C. Watson, Professor Babington, and others.\nThese were all essentially alike, so that the species cannot be heterostyled.\nThe pistil varies somewhat in length, but when unusually long, the stamens are\nlikewise generally long; in the bud the stamens are short; and Vaucher was\nperhaps thus deceived. There are from six to nine stamens, graduated in length.\nThe three stamens, which vary in being either present or absent, correspond with\nthe six shorter stamens of L. salicaria and with the six which are always absent\nin L. thymifolia. The stigma is included within the calyx, and stands in the\nmidst of the anthers, and would generally be fertilised by them; but as the\nstigma and anthers are upturned, and as, according to Vaucher, there is a\npassage left in the upper side of the flower to the nectary, there can hardly be\na doubt that the flowers are visited by insects, and would occasionally be\ncross-fertilised by them, as surely as the flowers of the short-styled L.\nsalicaria, the pistil of which and the corresponding stamens in the other two\nforms closely resemble those of L. hyssopifolia. According to Vaucher and Lecoq,\nthis species, which is an annual, generally grows almost solitarily (4\/9.\n'Geograph. Bot. de l'Europe' tome 6 1857 page 157.), whereas the three preceding\nspecies are social; and this fact alone would almost have convinced me that L.\nhyssopifolia was not heterostyled, as such plants cannot habitually live\nisolated any better than one sex of a dioecious species.\n\nWe thus see that within this genus some species are heterostyled and trimorphic;\none apparently heterostyled and dimorphic, and one homostyled.\n\nNesaea verticillata.\n\nI raised a number of plants from seed sent me by Professor Asa Gray, and they\npresented three forms. These differed from one another in the proportional\nlengths of their organs of fructification and in all respects, in very nearly\nthe same way as the three forms of Lythrum Graefferi. The green pollen-grains\nfrom the longest stamens, measured along their longer axis and not distended\nwith water, were 13\/7000 of an inch in length; those from the mid-length stamens\n9 to 10\/7000, and those from the shortest stamens 8 to 9\/7000 of an inch. So\nthat the largest pollen-grains are to the smallest in diameter as 100 to 65.\nThis plant inhabits swampy ground in the United States. According to Fritz\nMuller, a species of this genus in St. Catharina, in Southern Brazil, is\nhomostyled. (4\/10. 'Botanische Zeitung' 1868 page 112.)\n\nLagerstroemia Indica.\n\nThis plant, a member of the Lythraceae, may perhaps be heterostyled, or may\nformerly have been so. It is remarkable from the extreme variability of its\nstamens. On a plant, growing in my hothouse, the flowers included from nineteen\nto twenty-nine short stamens with yellow pollen, which correspond in position\nwith the shortest stamens of Lythrum; and from one to five (the latter number\nbeing the commonest) very long stamens, with thick flesh-coloured filaments and\ngreen pollen, corresponding in position with the longest stamens of Lythrum. In\none flower, two of the long stamens produced green, while a third produced\nyellow pollen, although the filaments of all three were thick and flesh-\ncoloured. In an anther of another flower, one cell contained green and the other\nyellow pollen. The green and yellow pollen-grains from the stamens of different\nlength are of the same size. The pistil is a little bowed upwards, with the\nstigma seated between the anthers of the short and long stamens, so that this\nplant was mid-styled. Eight flowers were fertilised with green pollen, and six\nwith yellow pollen, but not one set fruit. This latter fact by no means proves\nthat the plant is heterostyled, as it may belong to the class of self-sterile\nspecies. Another plant growing in the Botanic Gardens at Calcutta, as Mr. J.\nScott informs me, was long-styled, and it was equally sterile with its own\npollen; whilst a long-styled plant of L. reginae, though growing by itself,\nproduced fruit. I examined dried flowers from two plants of L. parviflora, both\nof which were long-styled, and they differed from L. Indica in having eight long\nstamens with thick filaments, and a crowd of shorter stamens. Thus the evidence\nwhether L. Indica is heterostyled is curiously conflicting: the unequal number\nof the short and long stamens, their extreme variability, and especially the\nfact of their pollen-grains not differing in size, are strongly opposed to this\nbelief; on the other hand, the difference in length of the pistils in two of the\nplants, their sterility with their own pollen, and the difference in length and\nstructure of the two sets of stamens in the same flower, and in the colour of\ntheir pollen, favour the belief. We know that when plants of any kind revert to\na former condition, they are apt to be highly variable, and the two halves of\nthe same organ sometimes differ much, as in the case of the above-described\nanther of the Lagerstroemia; we may therefore suspect that this species was once\nheterostyled, and that it still retains traces of its former state, together\nwith a tendency to revert more completely to it. It deserves notice, as bearing\non the nature of Lagerstroemia, that in Lythrum hyssopifolia, which is a\nhomostyled species, some of the shorter stamens vary in being either present or\nabsent; and that these same stamens are altogether absent in L. thymifolia. In\nanother genus of the Lythraceae, namely Cuphea, three species raised by me from\nseed certainly were homostyled; nevertheless their stamens consisted of two\nsets, differing in length and in the colour and thickness of their filaments,\nbut not in the size or colour of their pollen-grains; so that they thus far\nresembled the stamens of Lagerstroemia. I found that Cuphea purpurea was highly\nfertile with its own pollen when artificially aided, but sterile when insects\nwere excluded. (4\/11. Mr. Spence informs me that in several species of the genus\nMollia (Tiliaceae) which he collected in South America, the stamens of the five\nouter cohorts have purplish filaments and green pollen, whilst the stamens of\nthe five inner cohorts have yellow pollen. He therefore suspected that these\nspecies might prove to be heterostyled and trimorphic: but he did not notice the\nlength of the pistils. In the allied Luhea the outer purplish stamens are\ndestitute of anthers. I procured some specimens of Mollia lepidota and speciosa\nfrom Kew, but could not make out that their pistils differed in length in\ndifferent plants; and in all those which I examined the stigma stood close\nbeneath the uppermost anthers. The numerous stamens are graduated in length, and\nthe pollen-grains from the longest and shortest ones did not present any marked\ndifference in diameter. Therefore these species do not appear to be\nheterostyled.)]\n\nOxalis (Geraniaceae).\n\n(Figure 4.11. Oxalis speciosa (with the petals removed).\nLeft: Long-styled.\nCentre: Mid-styled.\nRight: Short-styled.\nS, S, S, stigmas. The dotted lines with arrows show which pollen must be carried\nto the stigmas for legitimate fertilisation.)\n\nIn 1863 Mr. Roland Trimen wrote to me from the Cape of Good Hope that he had\nthere found species of Oxalis which presented three forms; and of these he\nenclosed drawings and dried specimens. Of one species he collected 43 flowers\nfrom distinct plants, and they consisted of 10 long-styled, 12 mid-styled, and\n21 short-styled. Of another species he collected 13 flowers, consisting of 3\nlong-styled, 7 mid-styled, and 3 short-styled. In 1866 Professor Hildebrand\nproved by an examination of the specimens in several herbaria that 20 species\nare certainly heterostyled and trimorphic, and 51 others almost certainly so.\n(4\/12. 'Monatsber. der Akad. der Wiss. Berlin' 1866 pages 352, 372. He gives\ndrawings of the three forms at page 42 of his 'Geschlechter-Vertheilung' etc.\n1867.) He also made some interesting observations on living plants belonging to\none form alone; for at that time he did not possess the three forms of any\nliving species. During the years 1864 to 1868 I occasionally experimented on\nOxalis speciosa, but until now have never found time to publish the results. In\n1871 Hildebrand published an admirable paper in which he shows in the case of\ntwo species of Oxalis, that the sexual relations of the three forms are nearly\nthe same as in Lythrum salicaria. (4\/13. 'Botanische Zeitung' 1871 pages 416 and\n432.) I will now give an abstract of his observations, and afterwards of my own\nless complete ones. I may premise that in all the species seen by me, the\nstigmas of the five straight pistils of the long-styled form stand on a level\nwith the anthers of the longest stamens in the two other forms. In the mid-\nstyled form, the stigmas pass out between the filaments of the longest stamens\n(as in the short-styled form of Linum); and they stand rather nearer to the\nupper anthers than to the lower ones. In the short-styled form, the stigmas also\npass out between the filaments nearly on a level with the tips of the sepals.\nThe anthers in this latter form and in the mid-styled rise to the same height as\nthe corresponding stigmas in the other two forms.\n\nOxalis Valdiviana.\n\nThis species, an inhabitant of the west coast of South America, bears yellow\nflowers. Hildebrand states that the stigmas of the three forms do not differ in\nany marked manner, but that the pistil of the short-styled form alone is\ndestitute of hairs. The diameters of the pollen-grains are as follows:--\n\nTable 4.b. Oxalis Valdiviana. Diameters of pollen-grains in divisions of the\nmicrometer.\n\nColumn 1: Source of Pollen-grains.\nColumn 2: Minimum diameter.\nColumn 3: Maximum diameter.\n\nFrom the:\nLongest stamens of short-styled form : 8 to 9.\nMid-length stamens of short-styled form : 7 to 8.\nLongest stamens of mid-styled form : 8.\nShortest stamens of mid-styled form : 8.\nMid-length stamens of long-styled form : 7.\nShortest stamens of long-styled form : 6.\n\nTherefore the extreme difference in diameter is as 8.5 to 6, or as 100 to 71.\nThe results of Hildebrand's experiments are given in Table 4.27, drawn up in\naccordance with my usual plan.\n\nTable 4.27.

Whilst of the 255 illegitimately fertilised flowers, only 6 yielded\ncapsules, which contained 3.83 seeds on an average. Therefore the fertility of\nthe six legitimate to that of the twelve illegitimate unions, as judged by the\nproportion of flowers that yielded capsules, is as 100 to 2, and as judged by\nthe average number of seeds per capsule as 100 to 34. It may be added that some\nplants which were protected by nets did not spontaneously produce any fruit; nor\ndid one which was left uncovered by itself and was visited by bees. On the other\nhand, scarcely a single flower on some uncovered plants of the three forms\ngrowing near together failed to produce fruit.\n\nOxalis Regnelli.\n\nThis species bears white flowers and inhabits Southern Brazil. Hildebrand says\nthat the stigma of the long-styled form is somewhat larger than that of the mid-\nstyled, and this than that of the short-styled. The pistil of the latter is\nclothed with a few hairs, whilst it is very hairy in the other two forms. The\ndiameter of the pollen-grains from both sets of the longest stamens equals 9\ndivisions of the micrometer,--that from the mid-length stamens of the long-\nstyled form between 8 and 9, and of the short-styled 8,--and that from the\nshortest stamens of both sets 7. So that the extreme difference in diameter is\nas 9 to 7 or as 100 to 78. The experiments made by Hildebrand, which are not so\nnumerous as in the last case, are given in Table 4.28 in the same manner as\nbefore.\n\nTABLE 4.28.

Illegitimate union :\n9 : 0 : 0.\n\nShort-styled by pollen of mid-length stamens of long-styled. Illegitimate union:\n1 : 0 : 0.\n\nThe results are nearly the same as in the last case, but more striking; for 41\nflowers belonging to the three forms fertilised legitimately all yielded\ncapsules, containing on an average 10.31 seeds; whilst 39 flowers fertilised\nillegitimately did not yield a single capsule or seed. Therefore the fertility\nof the six legitimate to that of the several illegitimate unions, as judged both\nby the proportion of flowers which yielded capsules and by the average number of\ncontained seeds, is as 100 to 0.\n\nOxalis speciosa.\n\nThis species, which bears pink flowers, was introduced from the Cape of Good\nHope. A sketch of the reproductive organs of the three forms (Figure 4.11) has\nalready been given. The stigma of the long-styled form (with the papillae on its\nsurface included) is twice as large as that of the short-styled, and that of the\nmid-styled intermediate in size. The pollen-grains from the stamens in the three\nforms are in their longer diameters as follows:--\n\nTable 4.c. Oxalis speciosa. Diameters of pollen-grains in divisions of the\nmicrometer.\n\nColumn 1: Source of Pollen-grains.\nColumn 2: Minimum diameter.\nColumn 3: Maximum diameter.\n\nFrom the:\nLongest stamens of short-styled form : 15 to 16.\nMid-length stamens of short-styled form : 12 to 13.\nLongest stamens of mid-styled form : 16.\nShortest stamens of mid-styled form : 11 to 12.\nMid-length stamens of long-styled form : 14.\nShortest stamens of long-styled form : 12.\n\nTherefore the extreme difference in diameter is as 16 to 11, or as 100 to 69;\nbut as the measurements were taken at different times, they are probably only\napproximately accurate. The results of my experiments in fertilising the three\nforms are given in Table 4.29.\n\nTable 4.29.

Illegitimate union:\n10 : 1 : 54.\n\nWe here see that thirty-six flowers on the three forms legitimately fertilised\nyielded 30 capsules, these containing on an average 58.36 seeds. Ninety-five\nflowers illegitimately fertilised yielded 12 capsules, containing on an average\n28.58 seeds. Therefore the fertility of the six legitimate to that of the twelve\nillegitimate unions, as judged by the proportion of flowers which yielded\ncapsules, is as 100 to 15, and judged by the average number of seeds per capsule\nas 100 to 49. This plant, in comparison with the two South American species\npreviously described, produces many more seeds, and the illegitimately\nfertilised flowers are not quite so sterile.\n\nOxalis rosea.\n\nHildebrand possessed in a living state only the long-styled form of this\ntrimorphic Chilian species. (4\/14. 'Monatsber. der Akad. der Wiss. Berlin' 1866\npage 372.) The pollen-grains from the two sets of anthers differ in diameter as\n9 to 7.5, or as 100 to 83. He has further shown that there is an analogous\ndifference between the grains from the two sets of anthers of the same flower in\nfive other species of Oxalis, besides those already described. The present\nspecies differs remarkably from the long-styled form of the three species\npreviously experimented on, in a much larger proportion of the flowers setting\ncapsules when fertilised with their own-form pollen. Hildebrand fertilised 60\nflowers with pollen from the mid-length stamens (of either the same or another\nflower), and they yielded no less than 55 capsules, or 92 per cent. These\ncapsules contained on an average 5.62 seeds; but we have no means of judging how\nnear an approach this average makes to that from flowers legitimately\nfertilised. He also fertilised 45 flowers with pollen from the shortest stamens,\nand these yielded only 17 capsules, or 31 per cent, containing on an average\nonly 2.65 seeds. We thus see that about thrice as many flowers, when fertilised\nwith pollen from the mid-length stamens, produced capsules, and these contained\ntwice as many seeds, as did the flowers fertilised with pollen from the shortest\nstamens. It thus appears (and we find some evidence of the same fact with O.\nspeciosa), that the same rule holds good with Oxalis as with Lythrum salicaria;\nnamely, that in any two unions, the greater the inequality in length between the\npistils and stamens, or, which is the same thing, the greater the distance of\nthe stigma from the anthers, the pollen of which is used for fertilisation, the\nless fertile is the union,--whether judged by the proportion of flowers which\nset capsules, or by the average number of seeds per capsule. The rule cannot be\nexplained in this case any more than in that of Lythrum, by supposing that\nwherever there is greater liability to self-fertilisation, this is checked by\nthe union being rendered more sterile; for exactly the reverse occurs, the\nliability to self-fertilisation being greatest in the unions between the pistils\nand stamens which approach each other the nearest, and these are the more\nfertile. I may add that I also possessed some long-styled plants of this\nspecies: one was covered by a net, and it set spontaneously a few capsules,\nthough extremely few compared with those produced by a plant growing by itself,\nbut exposed to the visits of bees.\n\nWith most of the species of Oxalis the short-styled form seems to be the most\nsterile of the three forms, when these are illegitimately fertilised; and I will\nadd two other cases to those already given. I fertilised 29 short-styled flowers\nof O. compressa with pollen from their own two sets of stamens (the pollen-\ngrains of which differ in diameter as 100 and 83), and not one produced a\ncapsule. I formerly cultivated during several years the short-styled form of a\nspecies purchased under the name of O. Bowii (but I have some doubts whether it\nwas rightly named), and fertilised many flowers with their own two kinds of\npollen, which differ in diameter in the usual manner, but never got a single\nseed. On the other hand, Hildebrand says that the short-styled form of O.\nDeppei, growing by itself, yields plenty of seed; but it is not positively known\nthat this species is heterostyled; and the pollen-grains from the two sets of\nanthers do not differ in diameter.\n\nSome facts communicated to me by Fritz Muller afford excellent evidence of the\nutter sterility of one of the forms of certain trimorphic species of Oxalis,\nwhen growing isolated. He has seen in St. Catharina, in Brazil, a large field of\nyoung sugar-cane, many acres in extent, covered with the red blossoms of one\nform alone, and these did not produce a single seed. His own land is covered\nwith the short-styled form of a white-flowered trimorphic species, and this is\nequally sterile; but when the three forms were planted near together in his\ngarden they seeded freely. With two other trimorphic species he finds that\nisolated plants are always sterile.\n\nFritz Muller formerly believed that a species of Oxalis, which is so abundant in\nSt. Catharina that it borders the roads for miles, was dimorphic instead of\ntrimorphic. Although the pistils and stamens vary greatly in length, as was\nevident in some specimens sent to me, yet the plants can be divided into two\nsets, according to the lengths of these organs. A large proportion of the\nanthers are of a white colour and quite destitute of pollen; others which are\npale yellow contain many bad with some good grains; and others again which are\nbright yellow have apparently sound pollen; but he has never succeeded in\nfinding any fruit on this species. The stamens in some of the flowers are\npartially converted into petals. Fritz Muller after reading my description,\nhereafter to be given, of the illegitimate offspring of various heterostyled\nspecies, suspects that these plants of Oxalis may be the variable and sterile\noffspring of a single form of some trimorphic species, perhaps accidentally\nintroduced into the district, which has since been propagated asexually. It is\nprobable that this kind of propagation would be much aided by there being no\nexpenditure in the production of seed.\n\nOxalis (Biophytum) sensitiva.\n\nThis plant is ranked by many botanists as a distinct genus. Mr. Thwaites sent me\na number of flowers preserved in spirits from Ceylon, and they are clearly\ntrimorphic. The style of the long-styled form is clothed with many scattered\nhairs, both simple and glandular; such hairs are much fewer on the style of the\nmid-styled, and quite absent from that of the short-styled form; so that this\nplant resembles in this respect O. Valdiviana and Regnelli. Calling the length\nof the two lobes of the stigma of the long-styled form 100, that of the mid-\nstyled is 141, and that of the short-styled 164. In all other cases, in which\nthe stigma in this genus differs in size in the three forms, the difference is\nof a reversed nature, the stigma of the long-styled being the largest, and that\nof the short-styled the smallest. The diameter of the pollen-grains from the\nlongest stamens being represented by 100, those from the mid-length stamens are\n91, and those from the shortest stamens 84 in diameter. This plant is\nremarkable, as we shall see in the last chapter of this volume, by producing\nlong-styled, mid-styled, and short-styled cleistogamic flowers.\n\nHOMOSTYLED SPECIES OF OXALIS.\n\nAlthough the majority of the species in the large genus Oxalis seem to be\ntrimorphic, some are homostyled, that is, exist under a single form; for\ninstance the common O. acetosella, and according to Hildebrand two other widely\ndistributed European species, O. stricta and corniculata. Fritz Muller also\ninforms me that a similarly constituted species is found in St. Catharina, and\nthat it is quite fertile with its own pollen when insects are excluded. The\nstigmas of O. stricta and of another homostyled species, namely O.\ntropaeoloides, commonly stand on a level with the upper anthers, and both these\nspecies are likewise quite fertile when insects are excluded.\n\nWith respect to O. acetosella, Hildebrand says that in all the many specimens\nexamined by him the pistil exceeded the longer stamens in length. I procured 108\nflowers from the same number of plants growing in three distant parts of\nEngland; of these 86 had their stigmas projecting considerably above, whilst 22\nhad them nearly on a level with the upper anthers. In one lot of 17 flowers from\nthe same wood, the stigmas in every flower projected fully as much above the\nupper anthers as these stood above the lower anthers. So that these plants might\nfairly be compared with the long-styled form of a heterostyled species; and I at\nfirst thought that O. acetosella was trimorphic. But the case is one merely of\ngreat variability. The pollen-grains from the two sets of anthers, as observed\nby Hildebrand and myself, do not differ in diameter. I fertilised twelve flowers\non several plants with pollen from a distinct plant, choosing those with pistils\nof a different length; and 10 of these (i.e. 83 per cent) produced capsules,\nwhich contained on an average 7.9 seeds. Fourteen flowers were fertilised with\ntheir own pollen, and 11 of these (i.e. 79 per cent) yielded capsules,\ncontaining a larger average of seed, namely 9.2. These plants, therefore, in\nfunction show not the least sign of being heterostyled. I may add that 18\nflowers protected by a net were left to fertilise themselves, and only 10 of\nthese (i.e. 55 per cent) yielded capsules, which contained on an average only\n6.3 seeds. So that the access of insects, or artificial aid in placing pollen on\nthe stigma, increases the fertility of the flowers; and I found that this\napplied especially to those having shorter pistils. It should be remembered that\nthe flowers hang downwards, so that those with short pistils would be the least\nlikely to receive their own pollen, unless they were aided in some manner.\n\nFinally, as Hildebrand has remarked, there is no evidence that any of the\nheterostyled species of Oxalis are tending towards a dioecious condition, as\nZuccarini and Lindley inferred from the differences in the reproductive organs\nof the three forms, the meaning of which they did not understand.\n\nPONTEDERIA [SP.?] (PONTEDERIACEAE).\n\nFritz Muller found this aquatic plant, which is allied to the Liliaceae, growing\nin the greatest profusion on the banks of a river in Southern Brazil. (4\/15.\n\"Ueber den Trimorphismus der Pontederien\" 'Jenaische Zeitschrift' etc. Band 6\n1871 page 74.) But only two forms were found, the flowers of which include three\nlong and three short stamens. The pistil of the long-styled form, in two dried\nflowers which were sent me, was in length as 100 to 32, and its stigma as 100 to\n80, compared with the same organs in the short-styled form. The long-styled\nstigma projects considerably above the upper anthers of the same flower, and\nstands on a level with the upper ones of the short-styled form. In the latter\nthe stigma is seated beneath both its own sets of anthers, and is on a level\nwith the anthers of the shorter stamens in the long-styled form. The anthers of\nthe longer stamens of the short-styled form are to those of the shorter stamens\nof the long-styled form as 100 to 88 in length. The pollen-grains distended with\nwater from the longer stamens of the short-styled form are to those from the\nshorter stamens of the same form as 100 to 87 in diameter, as deduced from ten\nmeasurements of each kind. We thus see that the organs in these two forms differ\nfrom one another and are arranged in an analogous manner, as in the long and\nshort-styled forms of the trimorphic species of Lythrum and Oxalis. Moreover,\nthe longer stamens of the long-styled form of Pontederia, and the shorter ones\nof the short-styled form are placed in a proper position for fertilising the\nstigma of a mid-styled form. But Fritz Muller, although he examined a vast\nnumber of plants, could never find one belonging to the mid-styled form. The\nolder flowers of the long-styled and short-styled plants had set plenty of\napparently good fruit; and this might have been expected, as they could\nlegitimately fertilise one another. Although he could not find the mid-styled\nform of this species, he possessed plants of another species growing in his\ngarden, and all these were mid-styled; and in this case the pollen-grains from\nthe anthers of the longer stamens were to those from the shorter stamens of the\nsame flower as 100 to 86 in diameter, as deduced from ten measurements of each\nkind. These mid-styled plants growing by themselves never produced a single\nfruit.\n\nConsidering these several facts, there can hardly be a doubt that both these\nspecies of Pontederia are heterostyled and trimorphic. This case is an\ninteresting one, for no other Monocotyledonous plant is known to be\nheterostyled. Moreover, the flowers are irregular, and all other heterostyled\nplants have almost symmetrical flowers. The two forms differ somewhat in the\ncolour of their corollas, that of the short-styled being of a darker blue,\nwhilst that of the long-styled tends towards violet, and no other such case is\nknown. Lastly, the three longer stamens alternate with the three shorter ones,\nwhereas in Lythrum and Oxalis the long and short stamens belong to distinct\nwhorls. With respect to the absence of the mid-styled form in the case of the\nPontederia which grows wild in Southern Brazil, this would probably follow if\nonly two forms had been originally introduced there; for, as we shall hereafter\nsee from the observations of Hildebrand, Fritz Muller and myself, when one form\nof Oxalis is fertilised exclusively by either of the other two forms, the\noffspring generally belong to the two parent-forms.\n\nFritz Muller has recently discovered, as he informs me, a third species of\nPontederia, with all three forms growing together in pools in the interior of S.\nBrazil; so that no shadow of doubt can any longer remain about this genus\nincluding trimorphic species. He sent me dried flowers of all three forms. In\nthe long-styled form the stigma stands a little above the tips of the petals,\nand on a level with the anthers of the longest stamens in the other two forms.\nThe pistil is in length to that of the mid-styled as 100 to 56, and to that of\nthe short-styled as 100 to 16. Its summit is rectangularly bent upwards, and the\nstigma is rather broader than that of the mid-styled, and broader in about the\nratio of 7 to 4 than that of the short-styled. In the mid-styled form, the\nstigma is placed rather above the middle of the corolla, and nearly on a level\nwith the mid-length stamens in the other two forms; its summit is a little bent\nupwards. In the short-styled form the pistil is, as we have seen, very short,\nand differs from that in the other two forms in being straight. It stands rather\nbeneath the level of the anthers of the shortest stamens in the long-styled and\nmid-styled forms. The three anthers of each set of stamens, more especially\nthose of the shortest stamens, are placed one beneath the other, and the ends of\nthe filaments are bowed a little upwards, so that the pollen from all the\nanthers would be effectively brushed off by the proboscis of a visiting insect.\nThe relative diameters of the pollen-grains, after having been long soaked in\nwater, are given in Table 4.d, as measured by my son Francis.\n\nTABLE 4.d. Pontederia. Diameters of pollen-grains, after having been long soaked\nin water, in divisions of the micrometer.\n\nColumn 1: Source of Pollen-grains.\nColumn 2: diameter.\n\nLong-styled form, mid-length stamens (Average of 20 measurements): 13.2.\nLong-styled form, shortest stamens (10 measurements): 9.0.\n\nMid-styled form, longest stamens (15 measurements) : 16.4.\nMid-styled form, shortest stamens (20 measurements): 9.1.\n\nShort-styled form, longest stamens (20 measurements): 14.6.\nShort-styled form, mid-length stamens (20 measurements): 12.3.\n\nWe have here the usual rule of the grains from the longer stamens, the tubes of\nwhich have to penetrate the longer pistil, being larger than those from the\nstamens of less length. The extreme difference in diameter between the grains\nfrom the longest stamens of the mid-styled form, and from the shortest stamens\nof the long-styled, is as 16.4 to 9.0, or as 100 to 55; and this is the greatest\ndifference observed by me in any heterostyled plant. It is a singular fact that\nthe grains from the corresponding longest stamens in the two forms differ\nconsiderably in diameter; as do those in a lesser degree from the corresponding\nmid-length stamens in the two forms; whilst those from the corresponding\nshortest stamens in the long- and mid-styled forms are almost exactly equal.\nTheir inequality in the two first cases depends on the grains in both sets of\nanthers in the short-styled form being smaller than those from the corresponding\nanthers in the other two forms; and here we have a case parallel with that of\nthe mid-styled form of Lythrum salicaria. In this latter plant the pollen-grains\nof the mid-styled forms are of smaller size and have less fertilising power than\nthe corresponding ones in the other two forms; whilst the ovarium, however\nfertilised, yields a greater number of seeds; so that the mid-styled form is\naltogether more feminine in nature than the other two forms. In the case of\nPontederia, the ovarium includes only a single ovule, and what the meaning of\nthe difference in size between the pollen-grains from the corresponding sets of\nanthers may be, I will not pretend to conjecture.\n\nThe clear evidence that the species just described is heterostyled and\ntrimorphic is the more valuable as there is some doubt with respect to P.\ncordata, an inhabitant of the United States. Mr. Leggett suspects that it is\neither dimorphic or trimorphic, for the pollen-grains of the longer stamens are\n\"more than twice the diameter or than eight times the mass of the grains of the\nshorter stamens. Though minute, these smaller grains seem as perfect as the\nlarger ones.\" (4\/16. 'Bulletin of the Torrey Botanical Club' 1875 volume 6 page\n62.) On the other hand, he says that in all the mature flowers, \"the style was\nas long at least as the longer stamens;\" \"whilst in the young flowers it was\nintermediate in length between the two sets of stamens;\" and if this be so, the\nspecies can hardly be heterostyled.\n\n\nCHAPTER V.\n\nILLEGITIMATE OFFSPRING OF HETEROSTYLED PLANTS.\n\nIllegitimate offspring from all three forms of Lythrum salicaria.\nTheir dwarfed stature and sterility, some utterly barren, some fertile.\nOxalis, transmission of form to the legitimate and illegitimate seedlings.\nPrimula Sinensis, Illegitimate offspring in some degree dwarfed and infertile.\nEqual-styled varieties of P.

The present chapter will be\ndevoted to the character of their offspring or seedlings. Those raised from\nlegitimately fertilised seeds will be here called LEGITIMATE SEEDLINGS or\nPLANTS, and those from illegitimately fertilised seeds, ILLEGITIMATE SEEDLINGS\nor PLANTS. They differ chiefly in their degree of fertility, and in their powers\nof growth or vigour. I will begin with trimorphic plants, and I must remind the\nreader that each of the three forms can be fertilised in six different ways; so\nthat all three together can be fertilised in eighteen different ways. For\ninstance, a long-styled form can be fertilised legitimately by the longest\nstamens of the mid-styled and short-styled forms, and illegitimately by its own-\nform and mid-length and shortest stamens, also by the mid-length stamens of the\nmid-styled and by the shortest stamens of the short-styled form; so that the\nlong-styled can be fertilised legitimately in two ways and illegitimately in\nfour ways. The same holds good with respect to the mid-styled and short-styled\nforms. Therefore with trimorphic species six of the eighteen unions yield\nlegitimate offspring, and twelve yield illegitimate offspring.\n\nI will give the results of my experiments in detail, partly because the\nobservations are extremely troublesome, and will not probably soon be repeated--\nthus, I was compelled to count under the microscope above 20,000 seeds of\nLythrum salicaria--but chiefly because light is thus indirectly thrown on the\nimportant subject of hybridism.\n\nLythrum salicaria.\n\nOf the twelve illegitimate unions two were completely barren, so that no seeds\nwere obtained, and of course no seedlings could be raised. Seedlings were,\nhowever, raised from seven of the ten remaining illegitimate unions. Such\nillegitimate seedlings when in flower were generally allowed to be freely and\nlegitimately fertilised, through the agency of bees, by other illegitimate\nplants belonging to the two other forms growing close by. This is the fairest\nplan, and was usually followed; but in several cases (which will always be\nstated) illegitimate plants were fertilised with pollen taken from legitimate\nplants belonging to the other two forms; and this, as might have been expected,\nincreased their fertility. Lythrum salicaria is much affected in its fertility\nby the nature of the season; and to avoid error from this source, as far as\npossible, my observations were continued during several years. Some few\nexperiments were tried in 1863. The summer of 1864 was too hot and dry, and,\nthough the plants were copiously watered, some few apparently suffered in their\nfertility, whilst others were not in the least affected. The years 1865 and,\nespecially, 1866, were highly favourable. Only a few observations were made\nduring 1867. The results are arranged in classes according to the parentage of\nthe plants. In each case the average number of seeds per capsule is given,\ngenerally taken from ten capsules, which, according to my experience, is a\nnearly sufficient number. The maximum number of seeds in any one capsule is also\ngiven; and this is a useful point of comparison with the normal standard--that\nis, with the number of seeds produced by legitimate plants legitimately\nfertilised. I will give likewise in each case the minimum number. When the\nmaximum and minimum differ greatly, if no remark is made on the subject, it may\nbe understood that the extremes are so closely connected by intermediate figures\nthat the average is a fair one. Large capsules were always selected for\ncounting, in order to avoid over-estimating the infertility of the several\nillegitimate plants.\n\nIn order to judge of the degree of inferiority in fertility of the several\nillegitimate plants, the following statement of the average and of the maximum\nnumber of seeds produced by ordinary or legitimate plants, when legitimately\nfertilised, some artificially and some naturally, will serve as a standard of\ncomparison, and may in each case be referred to. But I give under each\nexperiment the percentage of seeds produced by the illegitimate plants, in\ncomparison with the standard legitimate number of the same form. For instance,\nten capsules from the illegitimate long-styled plant (Number 10), which was\nlegitimately and naturally fertilised by other illegitimate plants, contained on\nan average 44.2 seeds; whereas the capsules on legitimate long-styled plants,\nlegitimately and naturally fertilised by other legitimate plants, contained on\nan average 93 seeds. Therefore this illegitimate plant yielded only 47 per cent\nof the full and normal complement of seeds.\n\nSTANDARD NUMBER OF SEEDS PRODUCED BY LEGITIMATE PLANTS OF THE THREE FORMS, WHEN\nLEGITIMATELY FERTILISED.\n\nLong-styled form:\nAverage number of seeds in each capsule, 93;\nMaximum number observed out of twenty-three capsules, 159.\n\nMid-styled form:\nAverage number of seeds, 130;\nMaximum number observed out of thirty-one capsules, 151.\n\nShort-styled form:\nAverage number of seeds, 83.5; but we may, for the sake of brevity, say 83;\nMaximum number observed out of twenty-five capsules, 112.\n\nCLASSES 1 AND 2. ILLEGITIMATE PLANTS RAISED FROM LONG-STYLED PARENTS FERTILISED\nWITH POLLEN FROM THE MID-LENGTH OR THE SHORTEST STAMENS OF OTHER PLANTS OF THE\nSAME FORM.\n\nFrom this union I raised at different times three lots of illegitimate\nseedlings, amounting altogether to 56 plants. I must premise that, from not\nforeseeing the result, I did not keep a memorandum whether the eight plants of\nthe first lot were the product of the mid-length or shortest stamens of the same\nform; but I have good reason to believe that they were the product of the\nlatter. These eight plants were much more dwarfed, and much more sterile than\nthose in the other two lots. The latter were raised from a long-styled plant\ngrowing quite isolated, and fertilised by the agency of bees with its own\npollen; and it is almost certain, from the relative position of the organs of\nfructification, that the stigma under these circumstances would receive pollen\nfrom the mid-length stamens.\n\nAll the fifty-six plants in these three lots proved long-styled; now, if the\nparent-plants had been legitimately fertilised by pollen from the longest\nstamens of the mid-styled and short-styled forms, only about one-third of the\nseedlings would have been long-styled, the other two-thirds being mid-styled and\nshort-styled. In some other trimorphic and dimorphic genera we shall find the\nsame curious fact, namely, that the long-styled form, fertilised illegitimately\nby its own-form pollen, produces almost exclusively long-styled seedlings. (5\/1.\nHildebrand first called attention to this fact in the case of Primula Sinensis\n('Botanische Zeitung' January 1, 1864 page 5); but his results were not nearly\nso uniform as mine.)\n\nThe eight plants of the first lot were of low stature: three which I measured\nattained, when fully grown, the heights of only 28, 29, and 47 inches; whilst\nlegitimate plants growing close by were double this height, one being 77 inches.\nThey all betrayed in their general appearance a weak constitution; they flowered\nrather later in the season, and at a later age than ordinary plants. Some did\nnot flower every year; and one plant, behaving in an unprecedented manner, did\nnot flower until three years old. In the two other lots none of the plants grew\nquite to their full and proper height, as could at once be seen by comparing\nthem with the adjoining rows of legitimate plants. In several plants in all\nthree lots, many of the anthers were either shrivelled or contained brown and\ntough, or pulpy matter, without any good pollen-grains, and they never shed\ntheir contents; they were in the state designated by Gartner as contabescent,\nwhich term I will for the future use. (5\/2. 'Beitrage zur Kenntniss der\nBefruchtung' 1844 page 116.) In one flower all the anthers were contabescent\nexcepting two which appeared to the naked eye sound; but under the microscope\nabout two-thirds of the pollen-grains were seen to be small and shrivelled. In\nanother plant, in which all the anthers appeared sound, many of the pollen-\ngrains were shrivelled and of unequal sizes. I counted the seeds produced by\nseven plants (1 to 7) in the first lot of eight plants, probably the product of\nparents fertilised by their own-form shortest stamens, and the seeds produced by\nthree plants in the other two lots, almost certainly the product of parents\nfertilised by their own-form mid-length stamens.\n\n[PLANT 1.\n\nThis long-styled plant was allowed during 1863 to be freely and legitimately\nfertilised by an adjoining illegitimate mid-styled plant, but it did not yield a\nsingle seed-capsule. It was then removed and planted in a remote place close to\na brother long-styled plant Number 2, so that it must have been freely though\nillegitimately fertilised; under these circumstances it did not yield during\n1864 and 1865 a single capsule. I should here state that a legitimate or\nordinary long-styled plant, when growing isolated, and freely though\nillegitimately fertilised by insects with its own pollen, yielded an immense\nnumber of capsules, which contained on an average 21.5 seeds.\n\nPLANT 2.\n\nThis long-styled plant, after flowering during 1863 close to an illegitimate\nmid-styled plant, produced less than twenty capsules, which contained on an\naverage between four and five seeds. When subsequently growing in company with\nNumber 1, by which it will have been illegitimately fertilised, it yielded in\n1866 not a single capsule, but in 1865 it yielded twenty-two capsules: the best\nof these, fifteen in number, were examined; eight contained no seed, and the\nremaining seven contained on an average only three seeds, and these seeds were\nso small and shrivelled that I doubt whether they would have germinated.\n\nPLANTS 3 AND 4.\n\nThese two long-styled plants, after being freely and legitimately fertilised\nduring 1863 by the same illegitimate mid-styled plant as in the last case, were\nas miserably sterile as Number 2.\n\nPLANT 5.\n\nThis long-styled plant, after flowering in 1863 close to an illegitimate mid-\nstyled plant, yielded only four capsules, which altogether included only five\nseeds. During 1864, 1865, and 1866, it was surrounded either by illegitimate or\nlegitimate plants of the other two forms; but it did not yield a single capsule.\nIt was a superfluous experiment, but I likewise artificially fertilised in a\nlegitimate manner twelve flowers; but not one of these produced a capsule; so\nthat this plant was almost absolutely barren.\n\nPLANT 6.\n\nThis long-styled plant, after flowering during the favourable year of 1866,\nsurrounded by illegitimate plants of the other two forms, did not produce a\nsingle capsule.\n\nPLANT 7.\n\nThis long-styled plant was the most fertile of the eight plants of the first\nlot. During 1865 it was surrounded by illegitimate plants of various parentage,\nmany of which were highly fertile, and must thus have been legitimately\nfertilised. It produced a good many capsules, ten of which yielded an average of\n36.1 seeds, with a maximum of 47 and a minimum of 22; so that this plant\nproduced 39 per cent of the full number of seeds. During 1864 it was surrounded\nby legitimate and illegitimate plants of the other two forms; and nine capsules\n(one poor one being rejected) yielded an average of 41.9 seeds, with a maximum\nof 56 and a minimum of 28; so that, under these favourable circumstances, this\nplant, the most fertile of the first lot, did not yield, when legitimately\nfertilised, quite 45 per cent of the full complement of seeds.]\n\nIn the second lot of plants in the present class, descended from the long-styled\nform, almost certainly fertilised with pollen from its own mid-length stamens,\nthe plants, as already stated, were not nearly so dwarfed or so sterile as in\nthe first lot. All produced plenty of capsules. I counted the number of seeds in\nonly three plants, namely Numbers 8, 9, and 10.\n\n[PLANT 8.\n\nThis plant was allowed to be freely fertilised in 1864 by legitimate and\nillegitimate plants of the other two forms, and ten capsules yielded on an\naverage 41.1 seeds, with a maximum of 73 and a minimum of 11. Hence this plant\nproduced only 44 per cent of the full complement of seeds.\n\nPLANT 9.\n\nThis long-styled plant was allowed in 1865 to be freely fertilised by\nillegitimate plants of the other two forms, most of which were moderately\nfertile. Fifteen capsules yielded on an average 57.1 seeds, with a maximum of 86\nand a minimum of 23. Hence the plant yielded 61 per cent of the full complement\nof seeds.\n\nPLANT 10.\n\nThis long-styled plant was freely fertilised at the same time and in the same\nmanner as the last. Ten capsules yielded an average of 44.2 seeds, with a\nmaximum of 69 and a minimum of 25; hence this plant yielded 47 per cent of the\nfull complement of seeds.]\n\nThe nineteen long-styled plants of the third lot, of the same parentage as the\nlast lot, were treated differently; for they flowered during 1867 by themselves\nso that they must have been illegitimately fertilised by one another. It has\nalready been stated that a legitimate long-styled plant, growing by itself and\nvisited by insects, yielded an average of 21.5 seeds per capsule, with a maximum\nof 35; but, to judge fairly of its fertility, it ought to have been observed\nduring successive seasons. We may also infer from analogy that, if several\nlegitimate long-styled plants were to fertilise one another, the average number\nof seeds would be increased; but how much increased I do not know; hence I have\nno perfectly fair standard of comparison by which to judge of the fertility of\nthe three following plants of the present lot, the seeds of which I counted.\n\n[PLANT 11.\n\nThis long-styled plant produced a large crop of capsules, and in this respect\nwas one of the most fertile of the whole lot of nineteen plants. But the average\nfrom ten capsules was only 35.9 seeds, with a maximum of 60 and a minimum of 8.\n\nPLANT 12.\n\nThis long-styled plant produced very few capsules; and ten yielded an average of\nonly 15.4 seeds, with a maximum of 30 and a minimum of 4.\n\nPLANT 13.\n\nThis plant offers an anomalous case; it flowered profusely, yet produced very\nfew capsules; but these contained numerous seeds. Ten capsules yielded an\naverage of 71.9 seeds, with a maximum of 95 and a minimum of 29. Considering\nthat this plant was illegitimate and illegitimately fertilised by its brother\nlong-styled seedlings, the average and the maximum are so remarkably high that I\ncannot at all understand the case. We should remember that the average for a\nlegitimate plant legitimately fertilised is 93 seeds.]\n\nCLASS 3. ILLEGITIMATE PLANTS RAISED FROM A SHORT-STYLED PARENT FERTILISED WITH\nPOLLEN FROM OWN-FORM MID-LENGTH STAMENS.\n\nI raised from this union nine plants, of which eight were short-styled and one\nlong-styled; so that there seems to be a strong tendency in this form to\nreproduce, when self-fertilised, the parent-form; but the tendency is not so\nstrong as with the long-styled. These nine plants never attained the full height\nof legitimate plants growing close to them. The anthers were contabescent in\nmany of the flowers on several plants.\n\n[PLANT 14.\n\nThis short-styled plant was allowed during 1865 to be freely and legitimately\nfertilised by illegitimate plants descended from self-fertilised mid-, long- and\nshort-styled plants. Fifteen capsules yielded an average of 28.3 seeds, with a\nmaximum of 51 and a minimum of 11; hence this plant produced only 33 per cent of\nthe proper number of seeds. The seeds themselves were small and irregular in\nshape. Although so sterile on the female side, none of the anthers were\ncontabescent.\n\nPLANT 15.\n\nThis short-styled plant, treated like the last during the same year, yielded an\naverage, from fifteen capsules, of 27 seeds, with a maximum of 49 and a minimum\nof 7. But two poor capsules may be rejected, and then the average rises to 32.6,\nwith the same maximum of 49 and a minimum of 20; so that this plant attained 38\nper cent of the normal standard of fertility, and was rather more fertile than\nthe last, yet many of the anthers were contabescent.\n\nPLANT 16.\n\nThis short-styled plant, treated like the two last, yielded from ten capsules an\naverage of 77.8 seeds, with a maximum of 97 and a minimum of 60; so that this\nplant produced 94 per cent of the full number of seeds.\n\nPLANT 17.\n\nThis, the one long-styled plant of the same parentage as the last three plants,\nwhen freely and legitimately fertilised in the same manner as the last, yielded\nan average from ten capsules of 76.3 rather poor seeds, with a maximum of 88 and\na minimum of 57. Hence this plant produced 82 per cent of the proper number of\nseeds. Twelve flowers enclosed in a net were artificially and legitimately\nfertilised with pollen from a legitimate short-styled plant; and nine capsules\nyielded an average of 82.5 seeds, with a maximum of 98 and a minimum of 51; so\nthat its fertility was increased by the action of pollen from a legitimate\nplant, but still did not reach the normal standard.]\n\nCLASS 4. ILLEGITIMATE PLANTS RAISED FROM A MID-STYLED PARENT FERTILISED WITH\nPOLLEN FROM OWN-FORM LONGEST STAMENS.\n\nAfter two trials, I succeeded in raising only four plants from this illegitimate\nunion. These proved to be three mid-styled and one long-styled; but from so\nsmall a number we can hardly judge of the tendency in mid-styled plants when\nself-fertilised to reproduce the same form. These four plants never attained\ntheir full and normal height; the long-styled plant had several of its anthers\ncontabescent.\n\n[PLANT 18.\n\nThis mid-styled plant, when freely and legitimately fertilised during 1865 by\nillegitimate plants descended from self-fertilised long-, short-, and mid-styled\nplants, yielded an average from ten capsules of 102.6 seeds, with a maximum of\n131 and a minimum of 63: hence this plant did not produce quite 80 per cent of\nthe normal number of seeds. Twelve flowers were artificially and legitimately\nfertilised with pollen from a legitimate long-styled plant, and yielded from\nnine capsules an average of 116.1 seeds, which were finer than in the previous\ncase, with a maximum of 135 and a minimum of 75; so that, as with Plant 17,\npollen from a legitimate plant increased the fertility, but did not bring it up\nto the full standard.\n\nPLANT 19.\n\nThis mid-styled plant, fertilised in the same manner and at the same period as\nthe last, yielded an average from ten capsules of 73.4 seeds, with a maximum of\n87 and a minimum of 64: hence this plant produced only 56 per cent of the full\nnumber of seeds. Thirteen flowers were artificially and legitimately fertilised\nwith pollen from a legitimate long-styled plant, and yielded ten capsules with\nan average of 95.6 seeds; so that the application of pollen from a legitimate\nplant added, as in the two previous cases, to the fertility, but did not bring\nit up to the proper standard.\n\nPLANT 20.\n\nThis long-styled plant, of the same parentage with the two last mid-styled\nplants, and freely fertilised in the same manner, yielded an average from ten\ncapsules of 69.6 seeds, with a maximum of 83 and a minimum of 52: hence this\nplant produced 75 per cent of the full number of seeds.]\n\nCLASS 5. ILLEGITIMATE PLANTS RAISED FROM A SHORT-STYLED PARENT FERTILISED WITH\nPOLLEN FROM THE MID-LENGTH STAMENS OF THE LONG-STYLED FORM.\n\nIn the four previous classes, plants raised from the three forms fertilised with\npollen from either the longer or shorter stamens of the same form, but generally\nnot from the same plant, have been described. Six other illegitimate unions are\npossible, namely, between the three forms and the stamens in the other two forms\nwhich do not correspond in height with their pistils. But I succeeded in raising\nplants from only three of these six unions. From one of them, forming the\npresent Class 5, twelve plants were raised; these consisted of eight short-\nstyled, and four long-styled plants, with not one mid-styled. These twelve\nplants never attained quite their full and proper height, but by no means\ndeserved to be called dwarfs. The anthers in some of the flowers were\ncontabescent. One plant was remarkable from all the longer stamens in every\nflower and from many of the shorter ones having their anthers in this condition.\nThe pollen of four other plants, in which none of the anthers were contabescent,\nwas examined; in one a moderate number of grains were minute and shrivelled, but\nin the other three they appeared perfectly sound. With respect to the power of\nproducing seed, five plants (Numbers 21 to 25) were observed: one yielded\nscarcely more than half the normal number; a second was slightly infertile; but\nthe three others actually produced a larger average number of seeds, with a\nhigher maximum, than the standard. In my concluding remarks I shall recur to\nthis fact, which at first appears inexplicable.\n\n[PLANT 21.\n\nThis short-styled plant, freely and legitimately fertilised during 1865 by\nillegitimate plants, descended from self-fertilised long-, mid- and short-styled\nparents, yielded an average from ten capsules of 43 seeds, with a maximum of 63\nand a minimum of 26: hence this plant, which was the one with all its longer and\nmany of its shorter stamens contabescent, produced only 52 per cent of the\nproper number of seeds.\n\nPLANT 22.\n\nThis short-styled plant produced perfectly sound pollen, as viewed under the\nmicroscope. During 1866 it was freely and legitimately fertilised by other\nillegitimate plants belonging to the present and the following class, both of\nwhich include many highly fertile plants. Under these circumstances it yielded\nfrom eight capsules an average of 100.5 seeds, with a maximum of 123 and a\nminimum of 86; so that it produced 121 per cent of seeds in comparison with the\nnormal standard. During 1864 it was allowed to be freely and legitimately\nfertilised by legitimate and illegitimate plants, and yielded an average, from\neight capsules, of 104.2 seeds, with a maximum of 125 and a minimum of 90;\nconsequently it exceeded the normal standard, producing 125 per cent of seeds.\nIn this case, as in some previous cases, pollen from legitimate plants added in\na small degree to the fertility of the plant; and the fertility would, perhaps,\nhave been still greater had not the summer of 1864 been very hot and certainly\nunfavourable to some of the plants of Lythrum.\n\nPLANT 23.\n\nThis short-styled plant produced perfectly sound pollen. During 1866 it was\nfreely and legitimately fertilised by the other illegitimate plants specified\nunder the last experiment, and eight capsules yielded an average of 113.5 seeds,\nwith a maximum of 123 and a minimum of 93. Hence this plant exceeded the normal\nstandard, producing no less than 136 per cent of seeds.\n\nPLANT 24.\n\nThis long-styled plant produced pollen which seemed under the microscope sound;\nbut some of the grains did not swell when placed in water. During 1864 it was\nlegitimately fertilised by legitimate and illegitimate plants in the same manner\nas Plant 22, but yielded an average, from ten capsules, of only 55 seeds, with a\nmaximum of 88 and a minimum of 24, thus attaining 59 per cent of the normal\nfertility. This low degree of fertility, I presume, was owing to the\nunfavourable season; for during 1866, when legitimately fertilised by\nillegitimate plants in the manner described under Number 22, it yielded an\naverage, from eight capsules, of 82 seeds, with a maximum of 120 and a minimum\nof 67, thus producing 88 per cent of the normal number of seeds.\n\nPLANT 25.\n\nThe pollen of this long-styled plant contained a moderate number of poor and\nshrivelled grains; and this is a surprising circumstance, as it yielded an\nextraordinary number of seeds. During 1866 it was freely and legitimately\nfertilised by illegitimate plants, as described under Number 22, and yielded an\naverage, from eight capsules, of 122.5 seeds, with a maximum of 149 and a\nminimum of 84. Hence this plant exceeded the normal standard, producing no less\nthan 131 per cent of seeds.]\n\nCLASS 6. ILLEGITIMATE PLANTS RAISED FROM MID-STYLED PARENTS FERTILISED WITH\nPOLLEN FROM THE SHORTEST STAMENS OF THE LONG-STYLED FORM.\n\nI raised from this union twenty-five plants, which proved to be seventeen long-\nstyled and eight mid-styled, but not one short-styled. None of these plants were\nin the least dwarfed. I examined, during the highly favourable season of 1866,\nthe pollen of four plants: in one mid-styled plant, some of the anthers of the\nlongest stamens were contabescent, but the pollen-grains in the other anthers\nwere mostly sound, as they were in all the anthers of the shortest stamens; in\ntwo other mid-styled and in one long-styled plant many of the pollen-grains were\nsmall and shrivelled; and in the latter plant as many as a fifth or sixth part\nappeared to be in this state. I counted the seeds in five plants (Numbers 26 to\n30), of which two were moderately sterile and three fully fertile.\n\n[PLANT 26.\n\nThis mid-styled plant was freely and legitimately fertilised, during the rather\nunfavourable year 1864, by numerous surrounding legitimate and illegitimate\nplants. It yielded an average, from ten capsules, of 83.5 seeds, with a maximum\nof 110 and a minimum of 64, thus attaining 64 per cent of the normal fertility.\nDuring the highly favourable year 1866, it was freely and legitimately\nfertilised by illegitimate plants belonging to the present Class and to Class 5,\nand yielded an average, from eight capsules, of 86 seeds, with a maximum of 109\nand a minimum of 61, and thus attained 66 per cent of the normal fertility. This\nwas the plant with some of the anthers of the longest stamens contabescent as\nabove mentioned.\n\nPLANT 27.\n\nThis mid-styled plant, fertilised during 1864 in the same manner as the last,\nyielded an average, from ten capsules, of 99.4 seeds, with a maximum of 122 and\na minimum of 53, thus attaining to 76 per cent of the normal fertility. If the\nseason had been more favourable, its fertility would probably have been somewhat\ngreater, but, judging from the last experiment, only in a slight degree.\n\nPLANT 28.\n\nThis mid-styled plant, when legitimately fertilised during the favourable season\nof 1866, in the manner described under Number 26, yielded an average, from eight\ncapsules, of 89 seeds, with a maximum of 119 and a minimum of 69, thus producing\n68 per cent of the full number of seeds. In the pollen of both sets of anthers,\nnearly as many grains were small and shrivelled as sound.\n\nPLANT 29.\n\nThis long-styled plant was legitimately fertilised during the unfavourable\nseason of 1864, in the manner described under Number 26, and yielded an average,\nfrom ten capsules, of 84.6 seeds, with a maximum of 132 and a minimum of 47,\nthus attaining to 91 per cent of the normal fertility. During the highly\nfavourable season of 1866, when fertilised in the manner described under Number\n26, it yielded an average, from nine capsules (one poor capsule having been\nexcluded), of 100 seeds, with a maximum of 121 and a minimum of 77. This plant\nthus exceeded the normal standard, and produced 107 per cent of seeds. In both\nsets of anthers there were a good many bad and shrivelled pollen-grains, but not\nso many as in the last-described plant.\n\nPlant 30.\n\nThis long-styled plant was legitimately fertilised during 1866 in the manner\ndescribed under Number 26, and yielded an average, from eight capsules, of 94\nseeds, with a maximum of 106 and a minimum of 66; so that it exceeded the normal\nstandard, yielding 101 per cent of seeds.\n\nPlant 31.\n\nSome flowers on this long-styled plant were artificially and legitimately\nfertilised by one of its brother illegitimate mid-styled plants; and five\ncapsules yielded an average of 90.6 seeds, with a maximum of 97 and a minimum of\n79. Hence, as far as can be judged from so few capsules, this plant attained,\nunder these favourable circumstances, 98 per cent of the normal standard.]\n\nCLASS 7. ILLEGITIMATE PLANTS RAISED FROM MID-STYLED PARENTS FERTILISED WITH\nPOLLEN FROM THE LONGEST STAMENS OF THE SHORT-STYLED FORM.\n\nIt was shown in the last chapter that the union from which these illegitimate\nplants were raised is far more fertile than any other illegitimate union; for\nthe mid-styled parent, when thus fertilised, yielded an average (all very poor\ncapsules being excluded) of 102.8 seeds, with a maximum of 130; and the\nseedlings in the present class likewise have their fertility not at all\nlessened. Forty plants were raised; and these attained their full height and\nwere covered with seed-capsules. Nor did I observe any contabescent anthers. It\ndeserves, also, particular notice that these plants, differently from what\noccurred in any of the previous classes, consisted of all three forms, namely,\neighteen short-styled, fourteen long-styled, and eight mid-styled plants. As\nthese plants were so fertile, I counted the seeds only in the two following\ncases.\n\n[PLANT 32.\n\nThis mid-styled plant was freely and legitimately fertilised during the\nunfavourable year of 1864, by numerous surrounding legitimate and illegitimate\nplants. Eight capsules yielded an average of 127.2 seeds, with a maximum of 144\nand a minimum of 96; so that this plant attained 98 per cent of the normal\nstandard.\n\nPLANT 33.\n\nThis short-styled plant was fertilised in the same manner and at the same time\nwith the last; and ten capsules yielded an average of 113.9, with a maximum of\n137 and a minimum of 90. Hence this plant produced no less than 137 per cent of\nseeds in comparison with the normal standard.]\n\nCONCLUDING REMARKS ON THE ILLEGITIMATE OFFSPRING OF THE THREE FORMS OF Lythrum\nsalicaria.\n\nFrom the three forms occurring in approximately equal numbers in a state of\nnature, and from the results of sowing seed naturally produced, there is reason\nto believe that each form, when legitimately fertilised, reproduces all three\nforms in about equal numbers. Now, we have seen (and the fact is a very singular\none) that the fifty-six plants produced from the long-styled form,\nillegitimately fertilised with pollen from the same form (Class 1 and 2), were\nall long-styled. The short-styled form, when self-fertilised (Class 3), produced\neight short-styled and one long-styled plant; and the mid-styled form, similarly\ntreated (Class 4), produced three mid-styled and one long-styled offspring; so\nthat these two forms, when illegitimately fertilised with pollen from the same\nform, evince a strong, but not exclusive, tendency to reproduce the parent-form.\nWhen the short-styled form was illegitimately fertilised by the long-styled form\n(Class 5), and again when the mid-styled was illegitimately fertilised by the\nlong-styled (Class 6), in each case the two parent-forms alone were reproduced.\nAs thirty-seven plants were raised from these two unions, we may, with much\nconfidence, believe that it is the rule that plants thus derived usually consist\nof both parent-forms, but not of the third form. When, however, the mid-styled\nform was illegitimately fertilised by the longest stamens of the short-styled\n(Class 7), the same rule did not hold good; for the seedlings consisted of all\nthree forms. The illegitimate union from which these latter seedlings were\nraised is, as previously stated, singularly fertile, and the seedlings\nthemselves exhibited no signs of sterility and grew to their full height. From\nthe consideration of these several facts, and from analogous ones to be given\nunder Oxalis, it seems probable that in a state of nature the pistil of each\nform usually receives, through the agency of insects, pollen from the stamens of\ncorresponding height from both the other forms. But the case last given shows\nthat the application of two kinds of pollen is not indispensable for the\nproduction of all three forms. Hildebrand has suggested that the cause of all\nthree forms being regularly and naturally reproduced, may be that some of the\nflowers are fertilised with one kind of pollen, and others on the same plant\nwith the other kind of pollen. Finally, of the three forms, the long-styled\nevinces somewhat the strongest tendency to reappear amongst the offspring,\nwhether both, or one, or neither of the parents are long-styled.\n\n[TABLE 5.30.

Thirty-three plants in the seven classes were\nsubjected to various trials, and the seeds carefully counted. Some of them were\nartificially fertilised, but the far greater number were freely fertilised (and\nthis is the better and natural plan) through the agency of insects, by other\nillegitimate plants. In the right hand, or percentage column, in Table 5.30, a\nwide difference in fertility between the plants in the first four and the last\nthree classes may be perceived. In the first four classes the plants are\ndescended from the three forms illegitimately fertilised with pollen taken from\nthe same form, but only rarely from the same plant. It is necessary to observe\nthis latter circumstance; for, as I have elsewhere shown, most plants, when\nfertilised with their own pollen, or that from the same plant, are in some\ndegree sterile, and the seedlings raised from such unions are likewise in some\ndegree sterile, dwarfed, and feeble. (5\/3. 'The Effects of Cross and Self-\nfertilisation in the Vegetable Kingdom' 1876.) None of the nineteen illegitimate\nplants in the first four classes were completely fertile; one, however, was\nnearly so, yielding 96 per cent of the proper number of seeds. From this high\ndegree of fertility we have many descending gradations, till we reach an\nabsolute zero, when the plants, though bearing many flowers, did not produce,\nduring successive years, a single seed or even seed-capsule. Some of the most\nsterile plants did not even yield a single seed when legitimately fertilised\nwith pollen from legitimate plants. There is good reason to believe that the\nfirst seven plants in Class 1 and 2 were the offspring of a long-styled plant\nfertilised with pollen from its own-form shortest stamens, and these plants were\nthe most sterile of all. The remaining plants in Class 1 and 2 were almost\ncertainly the product of pollen from the mid-length stamens, and although very\nsterile, they were less so than the first set. None of the plants in the first\nfour classes attained their full and proper stature; the first seven, which were\nthe most sterile of all (as already stated), were by far the most dwarfed,\nseveral of them never reaching to half their proper height. These same plants\ndid not flower at so early an age, or at so early a period in the season, as\nthey ought to have done. The anthers in many of their flowers, and in the\nflowers of some other plants in the first six classes, were either contabescent\nor included numerous small and shrivelled pollen-grains. As the suspicion at one\ntime occurred to me that the lessened fertility of the illegitimate plants might\nbe due to the pollen alone having been affected, I may remark that this\ncertainly was not the case; for several of them, when fertilised by sound pollen\nfrom legitimate plants, did not yield the full complement of seeds; hence it is\ncertain that both the female and male reproductive organs were affected. In each\nof the seven classes, the plants, though descended from the same parents, sown\nat the same time and in the same soil, differed much in their average degree of\nfertility.\n\nTurning now to the fifth, sixth, and seventh classes, and looking to the right\nhand column of Table 5.30, we find nearly as many plants with a percentage of\nseeds above the normal standard as beneath it. As with most plants the number of\nseeds produced varies much, it might be thought that the present case was one\nmerely of variability. But this view must be rejected, as far as the less\nfertile plants in these three classes are concerned: first, because none of the\nplants in Class 5 attained their proper height, which shows that they were in\nsome manner affected; and, secondly, because many of the plants in Classes 5 and\n6 produced anthers which were either contabescent or included small and\nshrivelled pollen-grains. And as in these cases the male organs were manifestly\ndeteriorated, it is by far the most probable conclusion that the female organs\nwere in some cases likewise affected, and that this was the cause of the reduced\nnumber of seeds.\n\nWith respect to the six plants in these three classes which yielded a very high\npercentage of seeds, the thought naturally arises that the normal standard of\nfertility for the long-styled and short-styled forms (with which alone we are\nhere concerned) may have been fixed too low, and that the six legitimate plants\nare merely fully fertile. The standard for the long-styled form was deduced by\ncounting the seeds in twenty-three capsules, and for the short-styled form from\ntwenty-five capsules. I do not pretend that this is a sufficient number of\ncapsules for absolute accuracy; but my experience has led me to believe that a\nvery fair result may thus be gained. As, however, the maximum number observed in\nthe twenty-five capsules of the short-styled form was low, the standard in this\ncase may possibly be not quite high enough. But it should be observed, in the\ncase of the illegitimate plants, that in order to avoid over-estimating their\ninfertility, ten very fine capsules were always selected; and the years 1865 and\n1866, during which the plants in the three latter classes were experimented on,\nwere highly favourable for seed-production. Now, if this plan of selecting very\nfine capsules during favourable seasons had been followed for obtaining the\nnormal standards, instead of taking, during various seasons, the first capsules\nwhich came to hand, the standards would undoubtedly have been considerably\nhigher; and thus the fact of the six foregoing plants appearing to yield an\nunnaturally high percentage of seeds may, perhaps, be explained. On this view,\nthese plants are, in fact, merely fully fertile, and not fertile to an abnormal\ndegree. Nevertheless, as characters of all kinds are liable to variation,\nespecially with organisms unnaturally treated, and as in the four first and more\nsterile classes, the plants derived from the same parents and treated in the\nsame manner, certainly did vary much in sterility, it is possible that certain\nplants in the latter and more fertile classes may have varied so as to have\nacquired an abnormal degree of fertility. But it should be noticed that, if my\nstandards err in being too low, the sterility of all the many sterile plants in\nthe several classes will have to be estimated by so much the higher. Finally, we\nsee that the illegitimate plants in the four first classes are all more or less\nsterile, some being absolutely barren, with one alone almost completely fertile;\nin the three latter classes, some of the plants are moderately sterile, whilst\nothers are fully fertile, or possibly fertile in excess.\n\nThe last point which need here be noticed is that, as far as the means of\ncomparison serve, some degree of relationship generally exists between the\ninfertility of the illegitimate union of the several parent-forms and that of\ntheir illegitimate offspring. Thus the two illegitimate unions, from which the\nplants in Classes 6 and 7 were derived, yielded a fair amount of seed, and only\na few of these plants are in any degree sterile. On the other hand, the\nillegitimate unions between plants of the same form always yield very few seeds,\nand their seedlings are very sterile. Long-styled parent-plants when fertilised\nwith pollen from their own-form shortest stamens, appear to be rather more\nsterile than when fertilised with their own-form mid-length stamens; and the\nseedlings from the former union were much more sterile than those from the\nlatter union. In opposition to this relationship, short-styled plants\nillegitimately fertilised with pollen from the mid-length stamens of the long-\nstyled form (Class 5) are very sterile; whereas some of the offspring raised\nfrom this union were far from being highly sterile. It may be added that there\nis a tolerably close parallelism in all the classes between the degree of\nsterility of the plants and their dwarfed stature. As previously stated, an\nillegitimate plant fertilised with pollen from a legitimate plant has its\nfertility slightly increased. The importance of the several foregoing\nconclusions will be apparent at the close of this chapter, when the illegitimate\nunions between the forms of the same species and their illegitimate offspring,\nare compared with the hybrid unions of distinct species and their hybrid\noffspring.\n\nOXALIS.\n\nNo one has compared the legitimate and illegitimate offspring of any trimorphic\nspecies in this genus. Hildebrand sowed illegitimately fertilised seeds of\nOxalis Valdiviana, but they did not germinate (5\/4. 'Botanische Zeitung' 1871\npage 433 footnote.); and this fact, as he remarks, supports my view that an\nillegitimate union resembles a hybrid one between two distinct species, for the\nseeds in this latter case are often incapable of germination.\n\n[The following observations relate to the nature of the forms which appear among\nthe legitimate seedlings of Oxalis Valdiviana. Hildebrand raised, as described\nin the paper just referred to, 211 seedlings from all six legitimate unions, and\nthe three forms appeared among the offspring from each union. For instance,\nlong-styled plants were legitimately fertilised with pollen from the longest\nstamens of the mid-styled form, and the seedlings consisted of 15 long-styled,\n18 mid-styled, and 6 short-styled. We here see that a few short-styled plants\nwere produced, though neither parent was short-styled; and so it was with the\nother legitimate unions. Out of the above 211 seedlings, 173 belonged to the\nsame two forms as their parents, and only 38 belonged to the third form distinct\nfrom either parent. In the case of O. Regnelli, the result, as observed by\nHildebrand, was nearly the same, but more striking: all the offspring from four\nof the legitimate unions consisted of the two parent-forms, whilst amongst the\nseedlings from the other two legitimate unions the third form appeared. Thus, of\nthe 43 seedlings from the six legitimate unions, 35 belonged to the same two\nforms as their parents, and only 8 to the third form. Fritz Muller also raised\nin Brazil seedlings from long-styled plants of O. Regnelli legitimately\nfertilised with pollen from the longest stamens of the mid-styled form, and all\nthese belonged to the two parent-forms. (5\/5. 'Jenaische Zeitschrift' etc. Band\n6 1871 page 75.) Lastly, seedlings were raised by me from long-styled plants of\nO. speciosa legitimately fertilised by the short-styled form, and from the\nlatter reciprocally fertilised by the long-styled; and these consisted of 33\nlong-styled and 26 short-styled plants, with not one mid-styled form. There can,\ntherefore, be no doubt that the legitimate offspring from any two forms of\nOxalis tend to belong to the same two forms as their parents; but that a few\nseedlings belonging to the third form occasionally make their appearance; and\nthis latter fact, as Hildebrand remarks, may be attributed to atavism, as some\nof their progenitors will almost certainly have belonged to the third form.\n\nWhen, however, any one form of Oxalis is fertilised illegitimately with pollen\nfrom the same form, the seedlings appear to belong invariably to this form. Thus\nHildebrand states that long-styled plants of O. rosea growing by themselves have\nbeen propagated in Germany year after year by seed, and have always produced\nlong-styled plants. (5\/6. 'Ueber den Trimorphismus in der Gattung Oxalis:\nMonatsberichte der Akad. der Wissen. zu Berlin' 21 June 1866 page 373 and\n'Botanische Zeitung' 1871 page 435.) Again, 17 seedlings were raised from mid-\nstyled plants of O. hedysaroides growing by themselves, and these were all mid-\nstyled. So that the forms of Oxalis, when illegitimately fertilised with their\nown pollen, behave like the long-styled form of Lythrum salicaria, which when\nthus fertilised always produced with me long-styled offspring.]\n\nPRIMULA.\n\nPrimula Sinensis.\n\nI raised during February 1862, from some long-styled plants illegitimately\nfertilised with pollen from the same form, twenty-seven seedlings. These were\nall long-styled. They proved fully fertile or even fertile in excess; for ten\nflowers, fertilised with pollen from other plants of the same lot, yielded nine\ncapsules, containing on an average 39.75 seeds, with a maximum in one capsule of\n66 seeds. Four other flowers legitimately crossed with pollen from a legitimate\nplant, and four flowers on the latter crossed with pollen from the illegitimate\nseedlings, yielded seven capsules with an average of 53 seeds, with a maximum of\n72. I must here state that I have found some difficulty in estimating the normal\nstandard of fertility for the several unions of this species, as the results\ndiffer much during successive years, and the seeds vary so greatly in size that\nit is hard to decide which ought to be considered good. In order to avoid over-\nestimating the infertility of the several illegitimate unions, I have taken the\nnormal standard as low as possible.\n\nFrom the foregoing twenty-seven illegitimate plants, fertilised with their own-\nform pollen, twenty-five seedling grandchildren were raised; and these were all\nlong-styled; so that from the two illegitimate generations fifty-two plants were\nraised, and all without exception proved long-styled. These grandchildren grew\nvigorously, and soon exceeded in height two other lots of illegitimate seedlings\nof different parentage and one lot of equal-styled seedlings presently to be\ndescribed. Hence I expected that they would have turned out highly ornamental\nplants; but when they flowered, they seemed, as my gardener remarked, to have\ngone back to the wild state; for the petals were pale-coloured, narrow,\nsometimes not touching each other, flat, generally deeply notched in the middle,\nbut not flexuous on the margin, and with the yellow eye or centre conspicuous.\nAltogether these flowers were strikingly different from those of their\nprogenitors; and this I think, can only be accounted for on the principle of\nreversion. Most of the anthers on one plant were contabescent. Seventeen flowers\non the grandchildren were illegitimately fertilised with pollen taken from other\nseedlings of the same lot, and produced fourteen capsules, containing on an\naverage 29.2 seeds; but they ought to have contained about 35 seeds. Fifteen\nflowers legitimately fertilised with pollen from an illegitimate short-styled\nplant (belonging to the lot next to be described) produced fourteen capsules,\ncontaining an average of 46 seeds; they ought to have contained at least 50\nseeds. Hence these grandchildren of illegitimate descent appear to have lost,\nthough only in a very slight degree, their full fertility.\n\nWe will now turn to the short-styled form: from a plant of this kind, fertilised\nwith its own-form pollen, I raised, during February 1862, eight seedlings, seven\nof which were short-styled and one long-styled. They grew slowly, and never\nattained to the full stature of ordinary plants; some of them flowered\nprecociously, and others late in the season. Four flowers on these short-styled\nseedlings and four on the one long-styled seedling were illegitimately\nfertilised with their own-form pollen and produced only three capsules,\ncontaining on an average 23.6 seeds, with a maximum of 29; but we cannot judge\nof their fertility from so few capsules; and I have greater doubts about the\nnormal standard for this union than about any other; but I believe that rather\nabove 25 seeds would be a fair estimate. Eight flowers on these same short-\nstyled plants, and the one long-styled illegitimate plant were reciprocally and\nlegitimately crossed; they produced five capsules, which contained an average of\n28.6 seeds, with a maximum of 36. A reciprocal cross between legitimate plants\nof the two forms would have yielded an average of at least 57 seeds, with a\npossible maximum of 74 seeds; so that these illegitimate plants were sterile\nwhen legitimately crossed.\n\nI succeeded in raising from the above seven short-styled illegitimate plants,\nfertilised with their own-form pollen, only six plants--grandchildren of the\nfirst union. These, like their parents, were of low stature, and had so poor a\nconstitution that four died before flowering. With ordinary plants it has been a\nrare event with me to have more than a single plant die out of a large lot. The\ntwo grandchildren which lived and flowered were short-styled; and twelve of\ntheir flowers were fertilised with their own-form pollen and produced twelve\ncapsules containing an average of 28.2 seeds; so that these two plants, though\nbelonging to so weakly a set, were rather more fertile than their parents, and\nperhaps not in any degree sterile. Four flowers on the same two grandchildren\nwere legitimately fertilised by a long-styled illegitimate plant, and produced\nfour capsules, containing only 32.2 seeds instead of about 64 seeds, which is\nthe normal average for legitimate short-styled plants legitimately crossed.\n\nBy looking back, it will be seen that I raised at first from a short-styled\nplant fertilised with its own-form pollen one long-styled and seven short-styled\nillegitimate seedlings. These seedlings were legitimately intercrossed, and from\ntheir seed fifteen plants were raised, grandchildren of the first illegitimate\nunion, and to my surprise all proved short-styled. Twelve short-styled flowers\nborne by these grandchildren were illegitimately fertilised with pollen taken\nfrom other plants of the same lot, and produced eight capsules which contained\nan average of 21.8 seeds, with a maximum of 35. These figures are rather below\nthe normal standard for such a union. Six flowers were also legitimately\nfertilised with pollen from an illegitimate long-styled plant and produced only\nthree capsules, containing on an average 23.6 seeds, with a maximum of 35. Such\na union in the case of a legitimate plant ought to have yielded an average of 64\nseeds, with a possible maximum of 73 seeds.\n\nSUMMARY ON THE TRANSMISSION OF FORM, CONSTITUTION, AND FERTILITY OF THE\nILLEGITIMATE OFFSPRING OF Primula Sinensis.\n\nIn regard to the long-styled plants, their illegitimate offspring, of which\nfifty-two were raised in the course of two generations, were all long-styled.\n(5\/7. Dr. Hildebrand, who first called attention to this subject 'Botanische\nZeitung' 1864 page 5, raised from a similar illegitimate union seventeen plants,\nof which fourteen were long-styled and three short-styled. From a short-styled\nplant illegitimately fertilised with its own pollen he raised fourteen plants,\nof which eleven were short-styled and three long-styled.) These plants grew\nvigorously; but the flowers in one instance were small, appearing as if they had\nreverted to the wild state. In the first illegitimate generation they were\nperfectly fertile, and in the second their fertility was only very slightly\nimpaired. With respect to the short-styled plants, twenty-four out of twenty-\nfive of their illegitimate offspring were short-styled. They were dwarfed in\nstature, and one lot of grandchildren had so poor a constitution that four out\nof six plants perished before flowering. The two survivors, when illegitimately\nfertilised with their own-form pollen, were rather less fertile than they ought\nto have been; but their loss of fertility was clearly shown in a special and\nunexpected manner, namely, when legitimately fertilised by other illegitimate\nplants: thus altogether eighteen flowers were fertilised in this manner, and\nyielded twelve capsules, which included on an average only 28.5 seeds, with a\nmaximum of 45. Now a legitimate short-styled plant would have yielded, when\nlegitimately fertilised, an average of 64 seeds, with a possible maximum of 74.\nThis particular kind of infertility will perhaps be best appreciated by a\nsimile: we may assume that with mankind six children would be born on an average\nfrom an ordinary marriage; but that only three would be born from an incestuous\nmarriage. According to the analogy of Primula Sinensis, the children of such\nincestuous marriages, if they continued to marry incestuously, would have their\nsterility only slightly increased; but their fertility would not be restored by\na proper marriage; for if two children, both of incestuous origin, but in no\ndegree related to each other, were to marry, the marriage would of course be\nstrictly legitimate, nevertheless they would not give birth to more than half\nthe full and proper number of children.\n\n[EQUAL-STYLED VARIETY OF Primula Sinensis.\n\nAs any variation in the structure of the reproductive organs, combined with\nchanged function, is a rare event, the following cases are worth giving in\ndetail. My attention was first called to the subject by observing, in 1862, a\nlong-styled plant, descended from a self-fertilised long-styled parent, which\nhad some of its flowers in an anomalous state, namely, with the stamens placed\nlow down in the corolla as in the ordinary long-styled form, but with the\npistils so short that the stigmas stood on a level with the anthers. These\nstigmas were nearly as globular and as smooth as in the short-styled form,\ninstead of being elongated and rough as in the long-styled form. Here, then, we\nhave combined in the same flower, the short stamens of the long-styled form with\na pistil closely resembling that of the short-styled form. But the structure\nvaried much even on the same umbel: for in two flowers the pistil was\nintermediate in length between that of the long and that of the short-styled\nform, with the stigma elongated as in the former, and smooth as in the latter;\nand in three other flowers the structure was in all respects like that of the\nlong-styled form. These modifications appeared to me so remarkable that I\nfertilised eight of the flowers with their own pollen, and obtained five\ncapsules, which contained on an average 43 seeds; and this number shows that the\nflowers had become abnormally fertile in comparison with those of ordinary long-\nstyled plants when self-fertilised. I was thus led to examine the plants in\nseveral small collections, and the result showed that the equal-styled variety\nwas not rare.\n\nTABLE 5.31. Primula Sinensis. Preponderance of long-styled over the short-styled\nform.\n\nColumn 1: Name of owner or place.\nColumn 2: Long-styled form.\nColumn 3: Short-styled form.\nColumn 4: equal-styled variety.\n\nMr. Horwood : 0 : 0 : 17.\nMr. Duck : 20 : 0 : 9.\nBaston : 30 : 18 : 15.\nChichester : 12 : 9 : 2.\nHolwood : 42 : 12 : 0.\nHigh Elms : 16 : 0 : 0.\nWesterham : 1 : 5 : 0.\nMy own plants from purchased seeds : 13 : 7 : 0.\nTotal : 134 : 51 : 43.\n\nIn a state of nature the long and short-styled forms would no doubt occur in\nnearly equal numbers, as I infer from the analogy of the other heterostyled\nspecies of Primula, and from having raised the two forms of the present species\nin exactly the same number from flowers which had been LEGITIMATELY crossed. The\npreponderance in Table 5.31 of the long-styled form over the short-styled (in\nthe proportion of 134 to 51) results from gardeners generally collecting seed\nfrom self-fertilised flowers; and the long-styled flowers produce spontaneously\nmuch more seed (as shown in the first chapter) than the short-styled, owing to\nthe anthers of the long-styled form being placed low down in the corolla, so\nthat, when the flowers fall off, the anthers are dragged over the stigma; and we\nnow also know that long-styled plants, when self-fertilised, very generally\nreproduce long-styled offspring. From the consideration of this table, it\noccurred to me in the year 1862, that almost all the plants of the Chinese\nprimrose cultivated in England would sooner or later become long-styled or\nequal-styled; and now, at the close of 1876, I have had five small collections\nof plants examined, and almost all consisted of long-styled, with some more or\nless well-characterised equal-styled plants, but with not one short-styled.\n\nWith respect to the equal-styled plants in the table, Mr. Horwood raised from\npurchased seeds four plants, which he remembered were certainly not long-styled,\nbut either short or equal-styled, probably the latter. These four plants were\nkept separate and allowed to fertilise themselves; from their seed the seventeen\nplants in the table were raised, all of which proved equal-styled. The stamens\nstood low down in the corolla as in the long-styled form; and the stigmas, which\nwere globular and smooth, were either completely surrounded by the anthers, or\nstood close above them. My son William made drawings for me, by the aid of the\ncamera, of the pollen of one of the above equal-styled plants; and, in\naccordance with the position of the stamens, the grains resembled in their small\nsize those of the long-styled form. He also examined pollen from two equal-\nstyled plants at Southampton; and in both of them the grains differed extremely\nin size in the same anthers, a large number being small and shrivelled, whilst\nmany were fully as large as those of the short-styled form and rather more\nglobular. It is probable that the large size of these grains was due, not to\ntheir having assumed the character of the short-styled form, but to monstrosity;\nfor Max Wichura has observed pollen-grains of monstrous size in certain hybrids.\nThe vast number of the small shrivelled grains in the above two cases explains\nthe fact that, though equal-styled plants are generally fertile in a high\ndegree, yet some of them yield few seeds. I may add that my son compared, in\n1875, the grains from two white-flowered plants, in both of which the pistil\nprojected above the anthers, but neither were properly long-styled or equal-\nstyled; and in the one in which the stigma projected most, the grains were in\ndiameter to those in the other plant, in which the stigma projected less, as 100\nto 88; whereas the difference between the grains from perfectly characterised\nlong-styled and short-styled plants is as 100 to 57. So that these two plants\nwere in an intermediate condition. To return to the 17 plants in the first line\nof Table 5.31: from the relative position of their stigmas and anthers, they\ncould hardly fail to fertilise themselves; and accordingly four of them\nspontaneously yielded no less than 180 capsules; of these Mr. Horwood selected\neight fine capsules for sowing; and they included on an average 54.8 seeds, with\na maximum of 72. He gave me thirty other capsules, taken by hazard, of which\ntwenty-seven contained good seeds, averaging 35.5, with a maximum of 70; but if\nsix poor capsules, each with less than 13 seeds, be excluded, the average rises\nto 42.5. These are higher numbers than could be expected from either well-\ncharacterised form if self-fertilised; and this high degree of fertility accords\nwith the view that the male organs belonged to one form, and the female organs\npartially to the other form; so that a self-union in the case of the equal-\nstyled variety is in fact a legitimate union.\n\nThe seed saved from the above seventeen self-fertilised equal-styled plants\nproduced sixteen plants, which all proved equal-styled, and resembled their\nparents in all the above-specified respects. The stamens, however, in one plant\nwere seated higher up the tube of the corolla than in the true long-styled form;\nin another plant almost all the anthers were contabescent. These sixteen plants\nwere the grandchildren of the four original plants, which it is believed were\nequal-styled; so that this abnormal condition was faithfully transmitted,\nprobably through three, and certainly through two generations. The fertility of\none of these grandchildren was carefully observed: six flowers were fertilised\nwith pollen from the same flower, and produced six capsules, containing on an\naverage 68 seeds, with a maximum of 82, and a minimum of 40. Thirteen capsules\nspontaneously self-fertilised yielded an average of 53.2 seeds, with the\nastonishing maximum in one of 97 seeds. In no legitimate union has so high an\naverage as 68 seeds been observed by me, or nearly so high a maximum as 82 and\n97. These plants, therefore, not only have lost their proper heterostyled\nstructure and peculiar functional powers, but have acquired an abnormal grade of\nfertility--unless, indeed, their high fertility may be accounted for by the\nstigmas receiving pollen from the circumjacent anthers at exactly the most\nfavourable period.\n\nWith respect to Mr. Duck's lot in Table 5.31, seed was saved from a single\nplant, of which the form was not observed, and this produced nine equal-styled\nand twenty long-styled plants. The equal-styled resembled in all respects those\npreviously described; and eight of their capsules spontaneously self-fertilised\ncontained on an average 44.4 seeds, with a maximum of 61 and a minimum of 23. In\nregard to the twenty long-styled plants, the pistil in some of the flowers did\nnot project quite so high as in ordinary long-styled flowers; and the stigmas,\nthough properly elongated, were smooth; so that we have here a slight approach\nin structure to the pistil of the short-styled form. Some of these long-styled\nplants also approached the equal-styled in function; for one of them produced no\nless than fifteen spontaneously self-fertilised capsules, and of these eight\ncontained, on an average, 31.7 seeds, with a maximum of 61. This average would\nbe rather low for a long-styled plant artificially fertilised with its own\npollen, but is high for one spontaneously self-fertilised. For instance, thirty-\nfour capsules produced by the illegitimate grandchildren of a long-styled plant,\nspontaneously self-fertilised, contained on an average only 9.1 seeds, with a\nmaximum of 46. Some seeds indiscriminately saved from the foregoing twenty-nine\nequal-styled and long-styled plants produced sixteen seedlings, grandchildren of\nthe original plant belonging to Mr. Duck; and these consisted of fourteen equal-\nstyled and two long-styled plants; and I mention this fact as an additional\ninstance of the transmission of the equal-styled variety.\n\nThe third lot in Table 5.31, namely the Baston plants, are the last which need\nbe mentioned. The long and short-styled plants, and the fifteen equal-styled\nplants, were descended from two distinct stocks. The latter were derived from a\nsingle plant, which the gardener is positive was not long-styled; hence,\nprobably, it was equal-styled. In all these fifteen plants the anthers,\noccupying the same position as in the long-styled form, closely surrounded the\nstigma, which in one instance alone was slightly elongated. Notwithstanding this\nposition of the stigma, the flowers, as the gardener assured me, did not yield\nmany seeds; and this difference from the foregoing cases may perhaps have been\ncaused by the pollen being bad, as in some of the Southampton equal-styled\nplants.]\n\nCONCLUSIONS WITH RESPECT TO THE EQUAL-STYLED VARIETY OF P. Sinensis.\n\nThat this is a variation, and not a third or distinct form, as in the trimorphic\ngenera Lythrum and Oxalis, is clear; for we have seen its first appearance in\none out of a lot of illegitimate long-styled plants; and in the case of Mr.\nDuck's seedlings, long-styled plants, only slightly deviating from the normal\nstate, as well as equal-styled plants were produced from the same self-\nfertilised parent. The position of the stamens in their proper place low down in\nthe tube of the corolla, together with the small size of the pollen-grains,\nshow, firstly, that the equal-styled variety is a modification of the long-\nstyled form, and, secondly, that the pistil is the part which has varied most,\nas indeed was obvious in many of the plants. This variation is of frequent\noccurrence, and is strongly inherited when it has once appeared. It would,\nhowever, have possessed little interest if it had consisted of a mere change of\nstructure; but this is accompanied by modified fertility. Its occurrence\napparently stands in close relation with the illegitimate birth of the parent\nplant; but to this whole subject I shall hereafter recur.\n\n[Primula auricula.\n\nAlthough I made no experiments on the illegitimate offspring of this species, I\nrefer to it for two reasons:--First, because I have observed two equal-styled\nplants in which the pistil resembled in all respects that of the long-styled\nform, whilst the stamens had become elongated as in the short-styled form, so\nthat the stigma was almost surrounded by the anthers. The pollen-grains,\nhowever, of the elongated stamens resembled in their small size those of the\nshorter stamens proper to the long-styled form. Hence these plants have become\nequal-styled by the increased length of the stamens, instead of, as with P.\nSinensis, by the diminished length of the pistil. Mr. J. Scott observed five\nother plants in the same state, and he shows that one of them, when self-\nfertilised, yielded more seed than an ordinary long- or short-styled form would\nhave done when similarly fertilised, but that it was far inferior in fertility\nto either form when legitimately crossed. (5\/8. 'Journal of the Proceedings of\nthe Linnean Society' 8 1864 page 91.) Hence it appears that the male and female\norgans of this equal-styled variety have been modified in some special manner,\nnot only in structure but in functional powers. This, moreover, is shown by the\nsingular fact that both the long-styled and short-styled plants, fertilised with\npollen from the equal-styled variety, yield a lower average of seed than when\nthese two forms are fertilised with their own pollen.\n\nThe second point which deserves notice is that florists always throw away the\nlong-styled plants, and save seed exclusively from the short-styled form.\nNevertheless, as Mr. Scott was informed by a man who raises this species\nextensively in Scotland, about one-fourth of the seedlings appear long-styled;\nso that the short-styled form of the Auricula, when fertilised by its own\npollen, does not reproduce the same form in so large a proportion as in the case\nof P. Sinensis. We may further infer that the short-styled form is not rendered\nquite sterile by a long course of fertilisation with pollen of the same form:\nbut as there would always be some liability to an occasional cross with the\nother form, we cannot tell how long self-fertilisation has been continued.\n\nPrimula farinosa.\n\nMr. Scott says that it is not at all uncommon to find equal-styled plants of\nthis heterostyled species. (5\/9. 'Journal of the Proceedings of the Linnean\nSociety' 8 1864 page 115.) Judging from the size of the pollen-grains, these\nplants owe their structure, as in the case of P. auricula, to the abnormal\nelongation of the stamens of the long-styled form. In accordance with this view,\nthey yield less seed when crossed with the long-styled form than with the short-\nstyled. But they differ in an anomalous manner from the equal-styled plants of\nP. auricula in being extremely sterile with their own pollen.\n\nPrimula elatior.\n\nIt was shown in the first chapter, on the authority of Herr Breitenbach, that\nequal-styled flowers are occasionally found on this species whilst growing in a\nstate of nature; and this is the only instance of such an occurrence known to\nme, with the exception of some wild plants of the Oxlip--a hybrid between P.\nveris and vulgaris--which were equal-styled. Herr Breitenbach's case is\nremarkable in another way; for equal-styled flowers were found in two instances\non plants which bore both long-styled and short-styled flowers. In every other\ninstance these two forms and the equal-styled variety have been produced by\ndistinct plants.]\n\nPrimula vulgaris, BRIT. FL.\n\nVAR. acaulis OF LINN. AND P. acaulis OF JACQ.\n\nVAR. RUBRA.\n\nMr. Scott states that this variety, which grew in the Botanic Garden in\nEdinburgh, was quite sterile when fertilised with pollen from the common\nprimrose, as well as from a white variety of the same species, but that some of\nthe plants, when artificially fertilised with their own pollen, yielded a\nmoderate supply of seed. (5\/10. 'Journal of the Proceedings of the Linnean\nSociety' 8 1864 page 98.) He was so kind as to send me some of these self-\nfertilised seeds, from which I raised the plants immediately to be described. I\nmay premise that the results of my experiments on the seedlings, made on a large\nscale, do not accord with those by Mr. Scott on the parent-plant.\n\nFirst, in regard to the transmission of form and colour. The parent-plant was\nlong-styled, and of a rich purple colour. From the self-fertilised seed 23\nplants were raised; of these 18 were purple of different shades, with two of\nthem a little streaked and freckled with yellow, thus showing a tendency to\nreversion; and 5 were yellow, but generally with a brighter orange centre than\nin the wild flower. All the plants were profuse flowerers. All were long-styled;\nbut the pistil varied a good deal in length even on the same plant, being rather\nshorter, or considerably longer, than in the normal long-styled form; and the\nstigmas likewise varied in shape. It is, therefore, probable that an equal-\nstyled variety of the primrose might be found on careful search; and I have\nreceived two accounts of plants apparently in this condition. The stamens always\noccupied their proper position low down in the corolla; and the pollen-grains\nwere of the small size proper to the long-styled form, but were mingled with\nmany minute and shrivelled grains. The yellow-flowered and the purple-flowered\nplants of this first generation were fertilised under a net with their own\npollen, and the seed separately sown. From the former, 22 plants were raised,\nand all were yellow and long-styled. From the latter or the purple-flowered\nplants, 24 long-styled plants were raised, of which 17 were purple and 7 yellow.\nIn this last case we have an instance of reversion in colour, without the\npossibility of any cross, to the grandparents or more distant progenitors of the\nplants in question. Altogether 23 plants in the first generation and 46 in the\nsecond generation were raised; and the whole of these 69 illegitimate plants\nwere long-styled!\n\nEight purple-flowered and two yellow-flowered plants of the first illegitimate\ngeneration were fertilised in various ways with their own pollen and with that\nof the common primrose; and the seeds were separately counted, but as I could\ndetect no difference in fertility between the purple and yellow varieties, the\nresults are run together in Table 5.32.\n\nTABLE 5.32. Primula vulgaris.\n\nColumn 1: Nature of plant experimented on, and kind of union.\nColumn 2: Number of flowers fertilised.\nColumn 3: Number of capsules produced.\nColumn 4: Average Number of seeds per capsule.\nColumn 5: Maximum Number of seeds in any one capsule.\nColumn 6: Minimum Number of seeds in any one capsule.\n\nPurple- and yellow-flowered illegitimate long-styled plants, ILLEGITIMATELY\nfertilised with pollen from the same plant :\n72 : 11 : 11.5 : 26 : 5.\n\nPurple- and yellow-flowered illegitimate long-styled plants, ILLEGITIMATELY\nfertilised with pollen from the common long-styled primrose :\n72 : 39 : 31.4 : 62 : 3.\n\nOr, if the ten poorest capsules, including less than 15 seeds, be rejected, we\nget:\n72 : 29 : 40.6 : 62 : 18.\n\nPurple- and yellow-flowered illegitimate long-styled plants, LEGITIMATELY\nfertilised with pollen from the common short-styled primrose :\n26 : 18 : 36.4 : 60 : 9.\n\nOr, if the two poorest capsules, including less than 15 seeds, be rejected, we\nget:\n26 : 16 : 41.2 : 60 : 15.\n\nThe long-styled form of the common primrose ILLEGITIMATELY fertilised with\npollen from the long-styled illegitimate purple- and yellow-flowered plants:\n20 : 14 : 15.4 : 46 : 1.\n\nOr, if the three poorest capsules be rejected, we get:\n20 : 11 : 18.9 : 46 : 8.\n\nThe short-styled form of the common primrose LEGITIMATELY fertilised with pollen\nfrom the long-styled illegitimate purple- and yellow-flowered plants:\n10 : 6 : 30.5 : 61 : 6.\n\nIf we compare the figures in this table with those given in the first chapter,\nshowing the normal fertility of the common primrose, we shall see that the\nillegitimate purple- and yellow-flowered varieties are very sterile. For\ninstance, 72 flowers were fertilised with their own pollen and produced only 11\ngood capsules; but by the standard they ought to have produced 48 capsules; and\neach of these ought to have contained on an average 52.2 seeds, instead of only\n11.5 seeds. When these plants were illegitimately and legitimately fertilised\nwith pollen from the common primrose, the average numbers were increased, but\nwere far from attaining the normal standards. So it was when both forms of the\ncommon primrose were fertilised with pollen from these illegitimate plants; and\nthis shows that their male as well as their female organs were in a deteriorated\ncondition. The sterility of these plants was shown in another way, namely, by\ntheir not producing any capsules when the access of all insects (except such\nminute ones as Thrips) was prevented; for under these circumstances the common\nlong-styled primrose produces a considerable number of capsules. There can,\ntherefore, be no doubt that the fertility of these plants was greatly impaired.\nThe loss is not correlated with the colour of the flower; and it was to\nascertain this point that I made so many experiments. As the parent-plant\ngrowing in Edinburgh was found by Mr. Scott to be in a high degree sterile, it\nmay have transmitted a similar tendency to its offspring, independently of their\nillegitimate birth. I am, however, inclined to attribute some weight to the\nillegitimacy of their descent, both from the analogy of other cases, and more\nespecially from the fact that when the plants were LEGITIMATELY fertilised with\npollen of the common primrose they yielded an average, as may be seen in the\ntable, of only 5 more seeds than when ILLEGITIMATELY fertilised with the same\npollen. Now we know that it is eminently characteristic of the illegitimate\noffspring of Primula Sinensis that they yield but few more seeds when\nlegitimately fertilised than when fertilised with their own-form pollen.\n\nPrimula veris, Brit. Fl.\n\nVar. officinalis of Linn., P. officinalis OF Jacq.\n\nSeeds from the short-styled form of the cowslip fertilised with pollen from the\nsame form germinate so badly that I raised from three successive sowings only\nfourteen plants, which consisted of nine short-styled and five long-styled\nplants. Hence the short-styled form of the cowslip, when self-fertilised, does\nnot transmit the same form nearly so truly as does that of P. Sinensis. From the\nlong-styled form, always fertilised with its own-form pollen, I raised in the\nfirst generation three long-styled plants,--from their seed 53 long-styled\ngrandchildren,--from their seed 4 long-styled great-grandchildren,--from their\nseed 20 long-styled great-great-grandchildren,--and lastly, from their seed 8\nlong-styled and 2 short-styled great-great-great-grandchildren. In this last\ngeneration short-styled plants appeared for the first time in the course of the\nsix generations,--the parent long-styled plant which was fertilised with pollen\nfrom another plant of the same form being counted as the first generation. Their\nappearance may be attributed to atavism. From two other long-styled plants,\nfertilised with their own-form pollen, 72 plants were raised, which consisted of\n68 long-styled and 4 short-styled. So that altogether 162 plants were raised\nfrom illegitimately fertilised long-styled cowslips, and these consisted of 156\nlong-styled and 6 short-styled plants.\n\nWe will now turn to the fertility and powers of growth possessed by the\nillegitimate plants. From a short-styled plant, fertilised with its own-form\npollen, one short-styled and two long-styled plants, and from a long-styled\nplant similarly fertilised three long-styled plants were at first raised. The\nfertility of these six illegitimate plants was carefully observed; but I must\npremise that I cannot give any satisfactory standard of comparison as far as the\nnumber of the seeds is concerned; for though I counted the seeds of many\nlegitimate plants fertilised legitimately and illegitimately, the number varied\nso greatly during successive seasons that no one standard will serve well for\nillegitimate unions made during different seasons. Moreover the seeds in the\nsame capsule frequently differ so much in size that it is scarcely possible to\ndecide which ought to be counted as good seed. There remains as the best\nstandard of comparison the proportional number of fertilised flowers which\nproduce capsules containing any seed.\n\nFirst, for the one illegitimate short-styled plant. In the course of three\nseasons 27 flowers were illegitimately fertilised with pollen from the same\nplant, and they yielded only a single capsule, which, however, contained a\nrather large number of seeds for a union of this nature, namely, 23. As a\nstandard of comparison I may state that during the same three seasons 44 flowers\nborne by legitimate short-styled plants were self-fertilised, and yielded 26\ncapsules; so that the fact of the 27 flowers on the illegitimate plant having\nproduced only one capsule proves how sterile it was. To show that the conditions\nof life were favourable, I will add that numerous plants of this and other\nspecies of Primula all produced an abundance of capsules whilst growing close by\nin the same soil with the present and following plants. The sterility of the\nabove illegitimate short-styled plant depended on both the male and female\norgans being in a deteriorated condition. This was manifestly the case with the\npollen; for many of the anthers were shrivelled or contabescent. Nevertheless\nsome of the anthers contained pollen, with which I succeeded in fertilising some\nflowers on the illegitimate long-styled plants immediately to be described. Four\nflowers on this same short-styled plant were likewise LEGITIMATELY fertilised\nwith pollen from one of the following long-styled plants; but only one capsule\nwas produced, containing 26 seeds; and this is a very low number for a\nlegitimate union.\n\nWith respect to the five illegitimate long-styled plants of the first\ngeneration, derived from the above self-fertilised short-styled and long-styled\nparents, their fertility was observed during the same three years. These five\nplants, when self-fertilised, differed considerably from one another in their\ndegree of fertility, as was the case with the illegitimate long-styled plants of\nLythrum salicaria; and their fertility varied much according to the season. I\nmay premise, as a standard of comparison, that during the same years 56 flowers\non legitimate long-styled plants of the same age and grown in the same soil,\nwere fertilised with their own pollen, and yielded 27 capsules; that is, 48 per\ncent. On one of the five illegitimate long-styled plants 36 flowers were self-\nfertilised in the course of the three years, but they did not produce a single\ncapsule. Many of the anthers on this plant were contabescent; but some seemed to\ncontain sound pollen. Nor were the female organs quite impotent; for I obtained\nfrom a LEGITIMATE cross one capsule with good seed. On a second illegitimate\nlong-styled plant 44 flowers were fertilised during the same years with their\nown pollen, but they produced only a single capsule. The third and fourth plants\nwere in a very slight degree more productive. The fifth and last plant was\ndecidedly more fertile; for 42 self-fertilised flowers yielded 11 capsules.\nAltogether, in the course of the three years, no less than 160 flowers on these\nfive illegitimate long-styled plants were fertilised with their own pollen, but\nthey yielded only 22 capsules. According to the standard above given, they ought\nto have yielded 80 capsules. These 22 capsules contained on an average 15.1\nseeds. I believe, subject to the doubts before specified, that with legitimate\nplants the average number from a union of this nature would have been above 20\nseeds. Twenty-four flowers on these same five illegitimate long-styled plants\nwere legitimately fertilised with pollen from the above-described illegitimate\nshort-styled plant, and produced only 9 capsules, which is an extremely small\nnumber for a legitimate union. These 9 capsules, however, contained an average\nof 38 apparently good seeds, which is as large a number as legitimate plants\nsometimes yield. But this high average was almost certainly false; and I mention\nthe case for the sake of showing the difficulty of arriving at a fair result;\nfor this average mainly depended on two capsules containing the extraordinary\nnumbers of 75 and 56 seeds; these seeds, however, though I felt bound to count\nthem, were so poor that, judging from trials made in other cases, I do not\nsuppose that one would have germinated; and therefore they ought not to have\nbeen included. Lastly, 20 flowers were legitimately fertilised with pollen from\na legitimate plant, and this increased their fertility; for they produced 10\ncapsules. Yet this is but a very small proportion for a legitimate union.\n\nThere can, therefore, be no doubt that these five long-styled plants and the one\nshort-styled plant of the first illegitimate generation were extremely sterile.\nTheir sterility was shown, as in the case of hybrids, in another way, namely, by\ntheir flowering profusely, and especially by the long endurance of the flowers.\nFor instance, I fertilised many flowers on these plants, and fifteen days\nafterwards (namely on March 22nd) I fertilised numerous long-styled and short-\nstyled flowers on common cowslips growing close by. These latter flowers, on\nApril 8th, were withered, whilst most of the illegitimate flowers remained quite\nfresh for several days subsequently; so that some of these illegitimate plants,\nafter being fertilised, remained in full bloom for above a month.\n\nWe will now turn to the fertility of the 53 illegitimate long-styled\ngrandchildren, descended from the long-styled plant which was first fertilised\nwith its own pollen. The pollen in two of these plants included a multitude of\nsmall and shrivelled grains. Nevertheless they were not very sterile; for 25\nflowers, fertilised with their own pollen, produced 15 capsules, containing an\naverage of 16.3 seeds. As already stated, the probable average with legitimate\nplants for a union of this nature is rather above 20 seeds. These plants were\nremarkably healthy and vigorous, as long as they were kept under highly\nfavourable conditions in pots in the greenhouse; and such treatment greatly\nincreases the fertility of the cowslip. When these same plants were planted\nduring the next year (which, however, was an unfavourable one), out of doors in\ngood soil, 20 self-fertilised flowers produced only 5 capsules, containing\nextremely few and wretched seeds.\n\nFour long-styled great-grandchildren were raised from the self-fertilised\ngrandchildren, and were kept under the same highly favourable conditions in the\ngreenhouse; 10 of their flowers were fertilised with own-form pollen and yielded\nthe large proportion of 6 capsules, containing on an average 18.7 seeds. From\nthese seeds 20 long-styled great-great-grandchildren were raised, which were\nlikewise kept in the greenhouse. Thirty of their flowers were fertilised with\ntheir own pollen and yielded 17 capsules, containing on an average no less than\n32, mostly fine seeds. It appears, therefore, that the fertility of these plants\nof the fourth illegitimate generation, as long as they were kept under highly\nfavourable conditions, had not decreased, but had rather increased. The result,\nhowever, was widely different when they were planted out of doors in good soil,\nwhere other cowslips grew vigorously and were completely fertile; for these\nillegitimate plants now became much dwarfed in stature and extremely sterile,\nnotwithstanding that they were exposed to the visits of insects, and must have\nbeen legitimately fertilised by the surrounding legitimate plants. A whole row\nof these plants of the fourth illegitimate generation, thus freely exposed and\nlegitimately fertilised, produced only 3 capsules, containing on an average only\n17 seeds. During the ensuing winter almost all these plants died, and the few\nsurvivors were miserably unhealthy, whilst the surrounding legitimate plants\nwere not in the least injured.\n\nThe seeds from the great-great-grandchildren were sown, and 8 long-styled and 2\nshort-styled plants of the fifth illegitimate generation raised. These whilst\nstill in the greenhouse produced smaller leaves and shorter flower-stalks than\nsome legitimate plants with which they grew in competition; but it should be\nobserved that the latter were the product of a cross with a fresh stock,--a\ncircumstance which by itself would have added much to their vigour. (5\/11. For\nfull details of this experiment, see my 'Effects of Cross and Self-\nfertilisation' 1876 page 220.) When these illegitimate plants were transferred\nto fairly good soil out of doors, they became during the two following years\nmuch more dwarfed in stature and produced very few flower-stems; and although\nthey must have been legitimately fertilised by insects, they yielded capsules,\ncompared with those produced by the surrounding legitimate plants, in the ratio\nonly of 5 to 100! It is therefore certain that illegitimate fertilisation,\ncontinued during successive generations, affects the powers of growth and\nfertility of P. veris to an extraordinary degree; more especially when the\nplants are exposed to ordinary conditions of life, instead of being protected in\na greenhouse.\n\n[EQUAL-STYLED RED VARIETY OF Primula veris.\n\nMr. Scott has described a plant of this kind growing in the Botanic Garden of\nEdinburgh. (5\/12. 'Proceedings of the Linnean Society' volume 8 1864 page 105.)\nHe states that it was highly self-fertile, although insects were excluded; and\nhe explains this fact by showing, first, that the anthers and stigma are in\nclose apposition, and that the stamens in length, position and size of their\npollen-grains resemble those of the short-styled form, whilst the pistil\nresembles that of the long-styled form both in length and in the structure of\nthe stigma. Hence the self-union of this variety is, in fact, a legitimate\nunion, and consequently is highly fertile. Mr. Scott further states that this\nvariety yielded very few seeds when fertilised by either the long- or short-\nstyled common cowslip, and, again, that both forms of the latter, when\nfertilised by the equal-styled variety, likewise produced very few seeds. But\nhis experiments with the cowslip were few, and my results do not confirm his in\nany uniform manner.\n\nI raised twenty plants from self-fertilised seed sent me by Mr. Scott; and they\nall produced red flowers, varying slightly in tint. Of these, two were strictly\nlong-styled both in structure and in function; for their reproductive powers\nwere tested by crosses with both forms of the common cowslip. Six plants were\nequal-styled; but on the same plant the pistil varied a good deal in length\nduring different seasons. This was likewise the case, according to Mr. Scott,\nwith the parent-plant. Lastly, twelve plants were in appearance short-styled;\nbut they varied much more in the length of their pistils than ordinary short-\nstyled cowslips, and they differed widely from the latter in their powers of\nreproduction. Their pistils had become short-styled in structure, whilst\nremaining long-styled in function. Short-styled cowslips, when insects are\nexcluded, are extremely barren: for instance, on one occasion six fine plants\nproduced only about 50 seeds (that is, less than the product of two good\ncapsules), and on another occasion not a single capsule. Now, when the above\ntwelve apparently short-styled seedlings were similarly treated, nearly all\nproduced a great abundance of capsules, containing numerous seeds, which\ngerminated remarkably well. Moreover three of these plants, which during the\nfirst year were furnished with quite short pistils, on the following year\nproduced pistils of extraordinary length. The greater number, therefore, of\nthese short-styled plants could not be distinguished in function from the equal-\nstyled variety. The anthers in the six equal-styled and in the apparently twelve\nshort-styled plants were seated high up in the corolla, as in the true short-\nstyled cowslip; and the pollen-grains resembled those of the same form in their\nlarge size, but were mingled with a few shrivelled grains. In function this\npollen was identical with that of the short-styled cowslip; for ten long-styled\nflowers of the common cowslip, legitimately fertilised with pollen from a true\nequal-styled variety, produced six capsules, containing on an average 34.4\nseeds; whilst seven capsules on a short-styled cowslip illegitimately fertilised\nwith pollen from the equal-styled variety, yielded an average of only 14.5\nseeds.\n\nAs the equal-styled plants differ from one another in their powers of\nreproduction, and as this is an important subject, I will give a few details\nwith respect to five of them. First, an equal-styled plant, protected from\ninsects (as was done in all the following cases, with one stated exception),\nspontaneously produced numerous capsules, five of which gave an average of 44.8\nseeds, with a maximum in one capsule of 57. But six capsules, the product of\nfertilisation with pollen from a short-styled cowslip (and this is a legitimate\nunion), gave an average of 28.5 seeds, with a maximum of 49; and this is a much\nlower average than might have been expected. Secondly, nine capsules from\nanother equal-styled plant, which had not been protected from insects, but\nprobably was self-fertilised, gave an average of 45.2 seeds, with a maximum of\n58. Thirdly, another plant which had a very short pistil in 1865, produced\nspontaneously many capsules, six of which contained an average of 33.9 seeds,\nwith a maximum of 38. In 1866 this same plant had a pistil of wonderful length;\nfor it projected quite above the anthers, and the stigma resembled that of the\nlong-styled form. In this condition it produced spontaneously a vast number of\nfine capsules, six of which contained almost exactly the same average number as\nbefore, namely 34.3, with a maximum of 38. Four flowers on this plant,\nlegitimately fertilised with pollen from a short-styled cowslip, yielded\ncapsules with an average of 30.2 seeds. Fourthly another short-styled plant\nspontaneously produced in 1865 an abundance of capsules, ten of which contained\nan average of 35.6 seeds, with a maximum of 54. In 1866 this same plant had\nbecome in all respects long-styled, and ten capsules gave almost exactly the\nsame average as before, namely 35.1 seeds, with a maximum of 47. Eight flowers\non this plant, legitimately fertilised with pollen from a short-styled cowslip,\nproduced six capsules, with the high average of 53 seeds, and the high maximum\nof 67. Eight flowers were also fertilised with pollen from a long-styled cowslip\n(this being an illegitimate union), and produced seven capsules, containing an\naverage of 24.4 seeds, with a maximum of 32. The fifth and last plant remained\nin the same condition during both years: it had a pistil rather longer than that\nof the true short-styled form, with the stigma smooth, as it ought to be in this\nform, but abnormal in shape, like a much-elongated inverted cone. It produced\nspontaneously many capsules, five of which, in 1865, gave an average of only\n15.6 seeds; and in 1866 ten capsules still gave an average only a little higher,\nnamely of 22.1, with a maximum of 30. Sixteen flowers were fertilised with\npollen from a long-styled cowslip, and produced 12 capsules, with an average of\n24.9 seeds, and a maximum of 42. Eight flowers were fertilised with pollen from\na short-styled cowslip, but yielded only two capsules, containing 18 and 23\nseeds. Hence this plant, in function and partially in structure, was in an\nalmost exactly intermediate state between the long-styled and short-styled form,\nbut inclining towards the short-styled; and this accounts for the low average of\nseeds which it produced when spontaneously self-fertilised.\n\nThe foregoing five plants thus differ much from one another in the nature of\ntheir fertility. In two individuals a great difference in the length of the\npistil during two succeeding years made no difference in the number of seeds\nproduced. As all five plants possessed the male organs of the short-styled form\nin a perfect state, and the female organs of the long-styled form in a more or\nless complete state, they spontaneously produced a surprising number of\ncapsules, which generally contained a large average of remarkably fine seeds.\nWith ordinary cowslips LEGITIMATELY FERTILISED, I once obtained from plants\ncultivated in the greenhouse the high average, from seven capsules, of 58.7\nseeds, with a maximum in one capsule of 87 seeds; but from plants grown out of\ndoors I never obtained a higher average than 41 seeds. Now two of the equal-\nstyled plants, grown out of doors and spontaneously SELF-FERTILISED, gave\naverages of 44 and 45 seeds; but this high fertility may perhaps be in part\nattributed to the stigma receiving pollen from the surrounding anthers at\nexactly the right period. Two of these plants, fertilised with pollen from a\nshort-styled cowslip (and this in fact is a legitimate union), gave a lower\naverage than when self-fertilised. On the other hand, another plant, when\nsimilarly fertilised by a cowslip, yielded the unusually high average of 53\nseeds, with a maximum of 67. Lastly, as we have just seen, one of these plants\nwas in an almost exactly intermediate condition in its female organs between the\nlong- and short-styled forms, and consequently, when self-fertilised, yielded a\nlow average of seed. If we add together all the experiments which I made on the\nequal-styled plants, 41 spontaneously self-fertilised capsules (insects having\nbeen excluded) gave an average of 34 seeds, which is exactly the same number as\nthe parent-plant yielded in Edinburgh. Thirty-four flowers, fertilised with\npollen from the short-styled cowslip (and this is an analogous union), produced\n17 capsules, containing an average of 33.8 seeds. It is a rather singular\ncircumstance, for which I cannot account, that 20 flowers, artificially\nfertilised on one occasion with pollen from the same plants yielded only ten\ncapsules, containing the low average of 26.7 seeds.\n\nAs bearing on inheritance, it may be added that 72 seedlings were raised from\none of the red-flowered, strictly equal-styled, self-fertilised plants descended\nfrom the similarly characterised Edinburgh plant. These 72 plants were therefore\ngrandchildren of the Edinburgh plant, and they all bore, as in the first\ngeneration, red flowers, with the exception of one plant, which reverted in\ncolour to the common cowslip. In regard to structure, nine plants were truly\nlong-styled and had their stamens seated low down in the corolla in the proper\nposition; the remaining 63 plants were equal-styled, though the stigma in about\na dozen of them stood a little below the anthers. We thus see that the anomalous\ncombination in the same flower, of the male and female sexual organs which\nproperly exist in the two distinct forms, was inherited with much force. Thirty-\nsix seedlings were also raised from long and short-styled common cowslips,\ncrossed with pollen from the equal-styled variety. Of these plants one alone was\nequal-styled, 20 were short-styled, but with the pistil in three of them rather\ntoo long, and the remaining 15 were long-styled. In this case we have an\nillustration of the difference between simple inheritance and prepotency of\ntransmission; for the equal-styled variety, when self-fertilised, transmits its\ncharacter, as we have just seen, with much force, but when crossed with the\ncommon cowslip cannot withstand the greater power of transmission of the latter.\n\nPULMONARIA.\n\nI have little to say on this genus. I obtained seeds of P. officinalis from a\ngarden where the long-styled form alone grew, and raised 11 seedlings, which\nwere all long-styled. These plants were named for me by Dr. Hooker. They\ndiffered, as has been shown, from the plants belonging to this species which in\nGermany were experimented on by Hildebrand (5\/13. 'Botanische Zeitung' 1865 page\n13.); for he found that the long-styled form was absolutely sterile with its own\npollen, whilst my long-styled seedlings and the parent-plants yielded a fair\nsupply of seed when self-fertilised. Plants of the long-styled form of\nPulmonaria angustifolia were, like Hildebrand's plants, absolutely sterile with\ntheir own pollen, so that I could never procure a single seed. On the other\nhand, the short-styled plants of this species, differently from those of P.\nofficinalis, were fertile with their own pollen in a quite remarkable degree for\na heterostyled plant. From seeds carefully self-fertilised I raised 18 plants,\nof which 13 proved short-styled and 5 long-styled.\n\nPolygonum fagopyrum.\n\nFrom flowers on long-styled plants fertilised illegitimately with pollen from\nthe same plant, 49 seedlings were raised, and these consisted of 45 long-styled\nand 4 short-styled. From flowers on short-styled plants illegitimately\nfertilised with pollen from the same plant 33 seedlings were raised, and these\nconsisted of 20 short-styled and 13 long-styled. So that the usual rule of\nillegitimately fertilised long-styled plants tending much more strongly than\nshort-styled plants to reproduce their own form here holds good. The\nillegitimate plants derived from both forms flowered later than the legitimate,\nand were to the latter in height as 69 to 100. But as these illegitimate plants\nwere descended from parents fertilised with their own pollen, whilst the\nlegitimate plants were descended from parents crossed with pollen from a\ndistinct individual, it is impossible to know how much of their difference in\nheight and period of flowering, is due to the illegitimate birth of the one set,\nand how much to the other set being the product of a cross between distinct\nplants.]\n\nCONCLUDING REMARKS ON THE ILLEGITIMATE OFFSPRING OF HETEROSTYLED TRIMORPHIC AND\nDIMORPHIC PLANTS.\n\nIt is remarkable how closely and in how many points illegitimate unions between\nthe two or three forms of the same heterostyled species, together with their\nillegitimate offspring, resemble hybrid unions between distinct species together\nwith their hybrid offspring. In both cases we meet with every degree of\nsterility, from very slightly lessened fertility to absolute barrenness, when\nnot even a single seed-capsule is produced. In both cases the facility of\neffecting the first union is much influenced by the conditions to which the\nplants are exposed. (5\/14. This has been remarked by many experimentalists in\neffecting crosses between distinct species; and in regard to illegitimate unions\nI have given in the first chapter a striking illustration in the case of Primula\nveris.) Both with hybrids and illegitimate plants the innate degree of sterility\nis highly variable in plants raised from the same mother-plant. In both cases\nthe male organs are more plainly affected than the female; and we often find\ncontabescent anthers enclosing shrivelled and utterly powerless pollen-grains.\nThe more sterile hybrids, as Max Wichura has well shown, are sometimes much\ndwarfed in stature, and have so weak a constitution that they are liable to\npremature death (5\/15. 'Die Bastardbefruchtung im Pflanzenreich' 1865.); and we\nhave seen exactly parallel cases with the illegitimate seedlings of Lythrum and\nPrimula. Many hybrids are the most persistent and profuse flowerers, as are some\nillegitimate plants. When a hybrid is crossed by either pure parent-form, it is\nnotoriously much more fertile than when crossed inter se or by another hybrid;\nso when an illegitimate plant is fertilised by a legitimate plant, it is more\nfertile than when fertilised inter se or by another illegitimate plant. When two\nspecies are crossed and they produce numerous seeds, we expect as a general rule\nthat their hybrid offspring will be moderately fertile; but if the parent\nspecies produce extremely few seeds, we expect that the hybrids will be very\nsterile. But there are marked exceptions, as shown by Gartner, to these rules.\nSo it is with illegitimate unions and illegitimate offspring. Thus the mid-\nstyled form of Lythrum salicaria, when illegitimately fertilised with pollen\nfrom the longest stamens of the short-styled form, produced an unusual number of\nseeds; and their illegitimate offspring were not at all, or hardly at all,\nsterile. On the other hand, the illegitimate offspring from the long-styled\nform, fertilised with pollen from the shortest stamens of the same form, yielded\nfew seeds, and the illegitimate offspring thus produced were very sterile; but\nthey were more sterile than might have been expected relatively to the\ndifficulty of effecting the union of the parent sexual elements. No point is\nmore remarkable in regard to the crossing of species than their unequal\nreciprocity. Thus species A will fertilise B with the greatest ease; but B will\nnot fertilise A after hundreds of trials. We have exactly the same case with\nillegitimate unions; for the mid-styled Lythrum salicaria was easily fertilised\nby pollen from the longest stamens of the short-styled form, and yielded many\nseeds; but the latter form did not yield a single seed when fertilised by the\nlongest stamens of the mid-styled form.\n\nAnother important point is prepotency. Gartner has shown that when a species is\nfertilised with pollen from another species, if it be afterwards fertilised with\nits own pollen, or with that of the same species, this is so prepotent over the\nforeign pollen that the effect of the latter, though placed on the stigma some\ntime previously, is entirely destroyed. Exactly the same thing occurs with the\ntwo forms of a heterostyled species. Thus several long-styled flowers of Primula\nveris were fertilised illegitimately with pollen from another plant of the same\nform, and twenty-four hours afterwards legitimately with pollen from a short-\nstyled dark-red polyanthus which is a variety of P. veris; and the result was\nthat every one of the thirty seedlings thus raised bore flowers more or less\nred, showing plainly how prepotent the legitimate pollen from a short-styled\nplant was over the illegitimate pollen from a long-styled plant.\n\nIn all the several foregoing points the parallelism is wonderfully close between\nthe effects of illegitimate and hybrid fertilisation. It is hardly an\nexaggeration to assert that seedlings from an illegitimately fertilised\nheterostyled plant are hybrids formed within the limits of one and the same\nspecies. This conclusion is important, for we thus learn that the difficulty in\nsexually uniting two organic forms and the sterility of their offspring, afford\nno sure criterion of so-called specific distinctness. If any one were to cross\ntwo varieties of the same form of Lythrum or Primula for the sake of\nascertaining whether they were specifically distinct, and he found that they\ncould be united only with some difficulty, that their offspring were extremely\nsterile, and that the parents and their offspring resembled in a whole series of\nrelations crossed species and their hybrid offspring, he might maintain that his\nvarieties had been proved to be good and true species; but he would be\ncompletely deceived. In the second place, as the forms of the same trimorphic or\ndimorphic heterostyled species are obviously identical in general structure,\nwith the exception of the reproductive organs, and as they are identical in\ngeneral constitution (for they live under precisely the same conditions), the\nsterility of their illegitimate unions and that of their illegitimate offspring,\nmust depend exclusively on the nature of the sexual elements and on their\nincompatibility for uniting in a particular manner. And as we have just seen\nthat distinct species when crossed resemble in a whole series of relations the\nforms of the same species when illegitimately united, we are led to conclude\nthat the sterility of the former must likewise depend exclusively on the\nincompatible nature of their sexual elements, and not on any general difference\nin constitution or structure. We are, indeed, led to this same conclusion by the\nimpossibility of detecting any differences sufficient to account for certain\nspecies crossing with the greatest ease, whilst other closely allied species\ncannot be crossed, or can be crossed only with extreme difficulty. We are led to\nthis conclusion still more forcibly by considering the great difference which\noften exists in the facility of crossing reciprocally the same two species; for\nit is manifest in this case that the result must depend on the nature of the\nsexual elements, the male element of the one species acting freely on the female\nelement of the other, but not so in a reversed direction. And now we see that\nthis same conclusion is independently and strongly fortified by the\nconsideration of the illegitimate unions of trimorphic and dimorphic\nheterostyled plants. In so complex and obscure a subject as hybridism it is no\nslight gain to arrive at a definite conclusion, namely, that we must look\nexclusively to functional differences in the sexual elements, as the cause of\nthe sterility of species when first crossed and of their hybrid offspring. It\nwas this consideration which led me to make the many observations recorded in\nthis chapter, and which in my opinion make them worthy of publication.\n\n\nCHAPTER VI.\nCONCLUDING REMARKS ON HETEROSTYLED PLANTS.\n\nThe essential character of heterostyled plants.\nSummary of the differences in fertility between legitimately and illegitimately\nfertilised plants.\nDiameter of the pollen-grains, size of anthers and structure of stigma in the\ndifferent forms.\nAffinities of the genera which include heterostyled species.\nNature of the advantages derived from heterostylism.\nThe means by which plants became heterostyled.\nTransmission of form.\nEqual-styled varieties of heterostyled plants.\nFinal remarks.\n\nIn the foregoing chapters all the heterostyled plants known to me have been more\nor less fully described. Several other cases have been indicated, especially by\nProfessor Asa Gray and Kuhn, in which the individuals of the same species differ\nin the length of their stamens and pistils (6\/1. Asa Gray 'American Journal of\nScience' 1865 page 101 and elsewhere as already referred to. Kuhn 'Botanische\nZeitung' 1867 page 67.); but as I have been often deceived by this character\ntaken alone, it seems to me the more prudent course not to rank any species as\nheterostyled, unless we have evidence of more important differences between the\nforms, as in the diameter of the pollen-grains, or in the structure of the\nstigma. The individuals of many ordinary hermaphrodite plants habitually\nfertilise one another, owing to their male and female organs being mature at\ndifferent periods, or to the structure of the parts, or to self-sterility, etc.;\nand so it is with many hermaphrodite animals, for instance, land-snails or\nearth-worms; but in all these cases any one individual can fully fertilise or be\nfertilised by any other individual of the same species. This is not so with\nheterostyled plants: a long-styled, mid-styled or short-styled plant cannot\nfully fertilise or be fertilised by any other individual, but only by one\nbelonging to another form. Thus the essential character of plants belonging to\nthe heterostyled class is that the individuals are divided into two or three\nbodies, like the males and females of dioecious plants or of the higher animals,\nwhich exist in approximately equal numbers and are adapted for reciprocal\nfertilisation. The existence, therefore, of two or three bodies of individuals,\ndiffering from one another in the above more important characteristics, offers\nby itself good evidence that the species is heterostyled. But absolutely\nconclusive evidence can be derived only from experiments, and by finding that\npollen must be applied from the one form to the other in order to ensure\ncomplete fertility.\n\nIn order to show how much more fertile each form is when legitimately fertilised\nwith pollen from the other form (or in the case of trimorphic species, with the\nproper pollen from one of the two other forms) than when illegitimately\nfertilised with its own-form pollen, I will append Table 6.33 giving a summary\nof the results in all the cases hitherto ascertained. The fertility of the\nunions may be judged by two standards, namely, by the proportion of flowers\nwhich, when fertilised in the two methods, yield capsules, and by the average\nnumber of seeds per capsule. When there is a dash in the left hand column\nopposite to the name of the species, the proportion of the flowers which yielded\ncapsules was not recorded.\n\nTABLE 6.33. Fertility of the legitimate unions taken together, compared with\nthat of the illegitimate unions together. The fertility of the legitimate\nunions, as judged by both standards, is taken as 100.\n\nColumn 1: Name of species.\nColumn 2: Illegitimate unions : proportional number of flowers which produced\ncapsules.\nColumn 3: Illegitimate unions : average number of seeds per capsule.\n\nPrimula veris : 69 : 65.\n\nPrimula elatior : 27 : 75.\n\nPrimula vulgaris : 60 : 54.\n\nPrimula Sinensis : 84 : 63.\n\nPrimula Sinensis (second trial) : 0 : 53.\n\nPrimula Sinensis (Hildebrand) : 100 : 42.\n\nPrimula auricula (Scott) : 80 : 15.\n\nPrimula Sikkimensis (Scott) : 95 : 31.\n\nPrimula cortusoides (Scott) : 74 : 66.\n\nPrimula involucrata (Scott) : 72 : 48.\n\nPrimula farinosa (Scott) : 71 : 44.\n\nAverage of the nine species of Primula : 88.4 : 69.\n\nHottonia palustris (H.

Nor does the calyx differ, but the corolla\nsometimes differs slightly in shape, owing to the different position of the\nanthers. In Borreria the hairs within the tube of the corolla are differently\nsituated in the long-styled and short-styled forms. In Pulmonaria there is a\nslight difference in the size of the corolla, and in Pontederia in its colour.\nIn the reproductive organs the differences are much greater and more important.\nIn the one form the stamens may be all of the same length, and in the other\ngraduated in length, or alternately longer and shorter. The filaments may differ\nin colour and thickness, and are sometimes nearly thrice as long in the one form\nas in the other. They adhere also for very different proportional lengths to the\ncorolla. The anthers sometimes differ much in size in the two forms. Owing to\nthe rotation of the filaments, the anthers, when mature, dehisce towards the\ncircumference of the flower in one form of Faramea, and towards the centre in\nthe other form. The pollen-grains sometimes differ conspicuously in colour, and\noften to an extraordinary degree in diameter. They differ also somewhat in\nshape, and apparently in their contents, as they are unequally opaque. In the\nshort-styled form of Faramea the pollen-grains are covered with sharp points, so\nas to cohere readily together or to an insect; whilst the smaller grains of the\nlong-styled form are quite smooth.\n\nWith respect to the pistil, the style may be almost thrice as long in the one\nform as in the other. In Oxalis it sometimes differs in hairiness in the three\nforms. In Linum the pistils either diverge and pass out between the filaments,\nor stand nearly upright and parallel to them. The stigmas in the two forms often\ndiffer much in size and shape, and more especially in the length and thickness\nof their papillae; so that the surface may be rough or quite smooth. Owing to\nthe rotation of the styles, the papillose surface of the stigma is turned\noutwards in one form of Linum perenne, and inwards in the other form. In flowers\nof the same age of Primula veris the ovules are larger in the long-styled than\nin the short-styled form. The seeds produced by the two or three forms often\ndiffer in number, and sometimes in size and weight; thus, five seeds from the\nlong-styled form of Lythrum salicaria equal in weight six from the mid-styled\nand seven from the short-styled form. Lastly, short-styled plants of Pulmonaria\nofficinalis bear a larger number of flowers, and these set a larger proportional\nnumber of fruit, which however yield a lower average number of seed, than the\nlong-styled plants. With heterostyled plants we thus see in how many and in what\nimportant characters the forms of the same undoubted species often differ from\none another--characters which with ordinary plants would be amply sufficient to\ndistinguish species of the same genus.\n\nAs the pollen-grains of ordinary species belonging to the same genus generally\nresemble one another closely in all respects, it is worth while to show, in\nTable 6.34, the difference in diameter between the grains from the two or three\nforms of the same heterostyled species in the forty-three cases in which this\nwas ascertained. But it should be observed that some of the following\nmeasurements are only approximately accurate, as only a few grains were\nmeasured. In several cases, also, the grains had been dried and were then soaked\nin water. Whenever they were of an elongated shape their longer diameters were\nmeasured. The grains from the short-styled plants are invariably larger than\nthose from the long-styled, whenever there is any difference between them. The\ndiameter of the former is represented in the table by the number 100.\n\nTABLE 6.34.

The extreme difference is as 100 to 55; and we should bear in mind\nthat in the case of spheres differing to this degree in diameter, their contents\ndiffer in the ratio of six to one. With all the species in which the grains\ndiffer in diameter, there is no exception to the rule that those from the\nanthers of the short-styled form, the tubes of which have to penetrate the\nlonger pistil of the long-styled form, are larger than the grains from the other\nform. This curious relation led Delpino (as it formerly did me) to believe that\nthe larger size of the grains in the short-styled flowers is connected with the\ngreater supply of matter needed for the development of their longer tubes. (6\/2.\n'Sull' Opera, la Distribuzione dei Sessi nelle Piante' etc 1867 page 17.) But\nthe case of Linum, in which the grains of the two forms are of equal size,\nwhilst the pistil of the one is about twice as long as that of the other, made\nme from the first feel very doubtful with respect to this view. My doubts have\nsince been strengthened by the cases of Limnanthemum and Coccocypselum, in which\nthe grains are of equal size in the two forms; whilst in the former genus the\npistil is nearly thrice and in the latter twice as long as in the other form. In\nthose species in which the grains are of unequal size in the two forms, there is\nno close relationship between the degree of their inequality and that of their\npistils. Thus in Pulmonaria officinalis and in Erythroxylum the pistil in the\nlong-styled form is about twice the length of that in the other form, whilst in\nthe former species the pollen-grains are as 100 to 78, and in the latter as 100\nto 93 in diameter. In the two forms of Suteria the pistil differs but little in\nlength, whilst the pollen-grains are as 100 to 75 in diameter. These cases seem\nto prove that the difference in size between the grains in the two forms is not\ndetermined by the length of the pistil, down which the tubes have to grow. That\nwith plants in general there is no close relationship between the size of the\npollen-grains and the length of the pistil is manifest: for instance, I found\nthat the distended grains of Datura arborea were .00243 of an inch in diameter,\nand the pistil no less than 9.25 inches in length; now the pistil in the small\nflowers of Polygonum fagopyrum is very short, yet the larger pollen-grains from\nthe short-styled plants had exactly the same diameter as those from the Datura,\nwith its enormously elongated pistil.\n\nNotwithstanding these several considerations, it is difficult quite to give up\nthe belief that the pollen-grains from the longer stamens of heterostyled plants\nhave become larger in order to allow of the development of longer tubes; and the\nforegoing opposing facts may possibly be reconciled in the following manner. The\ntubes are at first developed from matter contained within the grains, for they\nare sometimes exserted to a considerable length, before the grains have touched\nthe stigma; but botanists believe that they afterwards draw nourishment from the\nconducting tissue of the pistil. It is hardly possible to doubt that this must\noccur in such cases as that of the Datura, in which the tubes have to grow down\nthe whole length of the pistil, and therefore to a length equalling 3,806 times\nthe diameter of the grains (namely, .00243 of an inch) from which they are\nprotruded. I may here remark that I have seen the pollen-grains of a willow,\nimmersed in a very weak solution of honey, protrude their tubes, in the course\nof twelve hours, to a length thirteen times as great as the diameter of the\ngrains. Now if we suppose that the tubes in some heterostyled species are\ndeveloped wholly or almost wholly from matter contained within the grains, while\nin other species from matter yielded by the pistil, we can see that in the\nformer case it would be necessary that the grains of the two forms should differ\nin size relatively to the length of the pistil which the tubes have to\npenetrate, but that in the latter case it would not be necessary that the grains\nshould thus differ. Whether this explanation can be considered satisfactory must\nremain at present doubtful.\n\nThere is another remarkable difference between the forms of several heterostyled\nspecies, namely in the anthers of the short-styled flowers, which contain the\nlarger pollen-grains, being longer than those of the long-styled flowers. This\nis the case with Hottonia palustris in the ratio of 100 to 83. With Limnanthemum\nIndicum the ratio is as 100 to 70. With the allied Menyanthes the anthers of the\nshort-styled form are a little and with Villarsia conspicuously larger than\nthose of the long-styled. With Pulmonaria angustifolia they vary much in size,\nbut from an average of seven measurements of each kind the ratio is as 100 to\n91. In six genera of the Rubiaceae there is a similar difference, either\nslightly or well marked. Lastly, in the trimorphic Pontederia the ratio is 100\nto 88; the anthers from the longest stamens in the short-styled form being\ncompared with those from the shortest stamens in the long-styled form. On the\nother hand, there is a similar and well-marked difference in the length of the\nstamens in the two forms of Forsythia suspensa and of Linum flavum; but in these\ntwo cases the anthers of the short-styled flowers are shorter than those of the\nlong-styled. The relative size of the anthers was not particularly attended to\nin the two forms of the other heterostyled plants, but I believe that they are\ngenerally equal, as is certainly the case with those of the common primrose and\ncowslip.\n\nThe pistil differs in length in the two forms of every heterostyled plant, and\nalthough a similar difference is very general with the stamens, yet in the two\nforms of Linum grandiflorum and of Cordia they are equal. There can hardly be a\ndoubt that the relative length of these organs is an adaptation for the safe\ntransportal by insects of the pollen from the one form to the other. The\nexceptional cases in which these organs do not stand exactly on a level in the\ntwo forms may probably be explained by the manner in which the flowers are\nvisited. With most of the species, if there is any difference in the size of the\nstigma of the two forms, that of the long-styled, whatever its shape may be, is\nlarger than that of the short-styled. But here again there are some exceptions\nto the rule, for in the short-styled form of Leucosmia Burnettiana the stigmas\nare longer and much narrower than those of the long-styled; the ratio between\nthe lengths of the stigmas in the two forms being 100 to 60. In the three\nRubiaceous genera, Faramea, Houstonia and Oldenlandia, the stigmas of the short-\nstyled form are likewise somewhat longer and narrower; and in the three forms of\nOxalis sensitiva the difference is strongly marked, for if the length of the two\nstigmas of the long-styled pistil be taken as 100, it will be represented in the\nmid- and short-styled forms by the numbers 141 and 164. As in all these cases\nthe stigmas of the short-styled pistil are seated low down within a more or less\ntubular corolla, it is probable that they are better fitted by being long and\nnarrow for brushing the pollen off the inserted proboscis of an insect.\n\nWith many heterostyled plants the stigma differs in roughness in the two forms,\nand when this is the case there is no known exception to the rule that the\npapillae on the stigma of the long-styled form are longer and often thicker than\nthose on that of the short-styled. For instance, the papillae on the long-styled\nstigma of Hottonia palustris are more than twice the length of those in the\nother form. This holds good even in the case of Houstonia coerulea, in which the\nstigmas are much shorter and stouter in the long-styled than in the short-styled\nform, for the papillae on the former compared with those on the latter are as\n100 to 58 in length. The length of the pistil in the long-styled form of Linum\ngrandiflorum varies much, and the stigmatic papillae vary in a corresponding\nmanner. From this fact I inferred at first that in all cases the difference in\nlength between the stigmatic papillae in the two forms was one merely of\ncorrelated growth; but this can hardly be the true or general explanation, as\nthe shorter stigmas of the long-styled form of Houstonia have the longer\npapillae. It is a more probable view that the papillae, which render the stigma\nof the long-styled form of various species rough, serve to entangle effectually\nthe large-sized pollen-grains brought by insects from the short-styled form,\nthus ensuring its legitimate fertilisation. This view is supported by the fact\nthat the pollen-grains from the two forms of eight species in Table 6.34 hardly\ndiffer in diameter, and the papillae on their stigmas do not differ in length.\n\nThe species which are at present positively or almost positively known to be\nheterostyled belong, as shown in Table 6.35, to 38 genera, widely distributed\nthroughout the world. These genera are included in fourteen Families, most of\nwhich are very distinct from one another, for they belong to nine of the several\ngreat Series, into which phanerogamic plants have been divided by Bentham and\nHooker.\n\nTABLE 6.35. List of genera including heterostyled species.\n\nDICOTYLEDONS.\n\nHYPERICINEAE:\nCratoxylon.\n\nERYTHROXYLEAE:\nErythroxylum.\nSethia.\n\nGERANIACEAE:\nLinum.\nOxalis.\n\nLYTHRACEAE:\nLythrum.\nNeseae.\n\nRUBIACEAE:\nCinchona.\nBouvardia.\nManettia.\nHedyotis.\nOldenlandia.\nHoustonia.\nCoccocypselum.\nLipostoma.\nKnoxia.\nFaramea.\nPsychotria.\nRudgea.\nSuteria.\nMitchella.\nDiodia.\nBorreria.\nSpermacoce.\n\nPRIMULACEAE:\nPrimula.\nHottonia.\nAndrosace.\n\nOLEACEAE:\nForsythia.\n\nGENTIANACEAE:\nMenyanthes.\nLimnanthemum.\nVillarsia.\n\nPOLEMONIACEAE:\nGilia.\n\nCORDIEAE:\nCordia.\n\nBORAGINEAE:\nPulmonaria.\n\nVERBENACEAE:\nAegiphila.\n\nPOLYGONEAE:\nPolygonum.\n\nTHYMELEAE:\nThymelea.\n\nMONOCOTYLEDONS.\n\nPONTEDERIACEAE:\nPontederia.\n\nIn some of these families the heterostyled condition must have been acquired at\na very remote period. Thus the three closely allied genera, Menyanthes,\nLimnanthemum, and Villarsia, inhabit respectively Europe, India, and South\nAmerica. Heterostyled species of Hedyotis are found in the temperate regions of\nNorth and the tropical regions of South America. Trimorphic species of Oxalis\nlive on both sides of the Cordillera in South America and at the Cape of Good\nHope. In these and some other cases it is not probable that each species\nacquired its heterostyled structure independently of its close allies. If they\ndid not do so, the three closely connected genera of the Menyantheae and the\nseveral trimorphic species of Oxalis must have inherited their structure from a\ncommon progenitor. But an immense lapse of time will have been necessary in all\nsuch cases for the modified descendants of a common progenitor to have spread\nfrom a single centre to such widely remote and separated areas. The family of\nthe Rubiaceae contains not far short of as many heterostyled genera as all the\nother thirteen families together; and hereafter no doubt other Rubiaceous genera\nwill be found to be heterostyled, although a large majority are homostyled.\nSeveral closely allied genera in this family probably owe their heterostyled\nstructure to descent in common; but as the genera thus characterised are\ndistributed in no less than eight of the tribes into which this family has been\ndivided by Bentham and Hooker, it is almost certain that several of them must\nhave become heterostyled independently of one another. What there is in the\nconstitution or structure of the members of this family which favours their\nbecoming heterostyled, I cannot conjecture. Some families of considerable size,\nsuch as the Boragineae and Verbenaceae, include, as far as is at present known,\nonly a single heterostyled genus. Polygonum also is the sole heterostyled genus\nin its family; and though it is a very large genus, no other species except P.\nfagopyrum is thus characterised. We may suspect that it has become heterostyled\nwithin a comparatively recent period, as it seems to be less strongly so in\nfunction than the species in any other genus, for both forms are capable of\nyielding a considerable number of spontaneously self-fertilised seeds. Polygonum\nin possessing only a single heterostyled species is an extreme case; but every\nother genus of considerable size which includes some such species likewise\ncontains homostyled species. Lythrum includes trimorphic, dimorphic, and\nhomostyled species.\n\nTrees, bushes, and herbaceous plants, both large and small, bearing single\nflowers or flowers in dense spikes or heads, have been rendered heterostyled. So\nhave plants which inhabit alpine and lowland sites, dry land, marshes and water.\n(6\/3. Out of the 38 genera known to include heterostyled species, about eight,\nor 21 per cent, are more or less aquatic in their habits. I was at first struck\nwith this fact, for I was not then aware how large a proportion of ordinary\nplants inhabit such stations. Heterostyled plants may be said in one sense to\nhave their sexes separated, as the forms must mutually fertilise one another.\nTherefore it seemed worth while to ascertain what proportion of the genera in\nthe Linnean classes, Monoecia, Dioecia and Polygamia, contained species which\nlive \"in water, marshes, bogs or watery places.\" In Sir W.J. Hooker's 'British\nFlora' 4th edition 1838, these three Linnean classes include 40 genera, 17 of\nwhich (i.e. 43 per cent) contain species inhabiting the just-specified stations.\nSo that 43 per cent of those British plants which have their sexes separated are\nmore or less aquatic in their habits, whereas only 21 per cent of heterostyled\nplants have such habits. I may add that the hermaphrodite classes, from\nMonandria to Gynandria inclusive, contain 447 genera, of which 113 are aquatic\nin the above sense, or only 25 per cent. It thus appears, as far as can be\njudged from such imperfect data, that there is some connection between the\nseparation of the sexes in plants and the watery nature of the sites which they\ninhabit; but that this does not hold good with heterostyled species.)\n\nWhen I first began to experimentise on heterostyled plants it was under the\nimpression that they were tending to become dioecious; but I was soon forced to\nrelinquish this notion, as the long-styled plants of Primula which, from\npossessing a longer pistil, larger stigma, shorter stamens with smaller pollen-\ngrains, seemed to be the more feminine of the two forms, yielded fewer seeds\nthan the short-styled plants which appeared to be in the above respects the more\nmasculine of the two. Moreover, trimorphic plants evidently come under the same\ncategory with dimorphic, and the former cannot be looked at as tending to become\ndioecious. With Lythrum salicaria, however, we have the curious and unique case\nof the mid-styled form being more feminine or less masculine in nature than the\nother two forms. This is shown by the large number of seeds which it yields in\nwhatever manner it may be fertilised, and by its pollen (the grains of which are\nof smaller size than those from the corresponding stamens in the other two\nforms) when applied to the stigma of any form producing fewer seeds than the\nnormal number. If we suppose the process of deterioration of the male organs in\nthe mid-styled form to continue, the final result would be the production of a\nfemale plant; and Lythrum salicaria would then consist of two heterostyled\nhermaphrodites and a female. No such case is known to exist, but it is a\npossible one, as hermaphrodite and female forms of the same species are by no\nmeans rare. Although there is no reason to believe that heterostyled plants are\nregularly becoming dioecious, yet they offer singular facilities, as will\nhereafter be shown, for such conversion; and this appears occasionally to have\nbeen effected.\n\nWe may feel sure that plants have been rendered heterostyled to ensure cross-\nfertilisation, for we now know that a cross between the distinct individuals of\nthe same species is highly important for the vigour and fertility of the\noffspring. The same end is gained by dichogamy or the maturation of the\nreproductive elements of the same flower at different periods,--by\ndioeciousness--self-sterility--the prepotency of pollen from another individual\nover a plant's own pollen,--and lastly, by the structure of the flower in\nrelation to the visits of insects. The wonderful diversity of the means for\ngaining the same end in this case, and in many others, depends on the nature of\nall the previous changes through which the species has passed, and on the more\nor less complete inheritance of the successive adaptations of each part to the\nsurrounding conditions. Plants which are already well adapted by the structure\nof their flowers for cross-fertilisation by the aid of insects often possess an\nirregular corolla, which has been modelled in relation to their visits; and it\nwould have been of little or no use to such plants to have become heterostyled.\nWe can thus understand why it is that not a single species is heterostyled in\nsuch great families as the Leguminosae, Labiatae, Scrophulariaceae, Orchideae,\netc., all of which have irregular flowers. Every known heterostyled plant,\nhowever, depends on insects for its fertilisation, and not on the wind; so that\nit is a rather surprising fact that only one genus, Pontederia, has a plainly\nirregular corolla.\n\nWhy some species are adapted for cross-fertilisation, whilst others within the\nsame genus are not so, or if they once were, have since lost such adaptation and\nin consequence are now usually self-fertilised, I have endeavoured elsewhere to\nexplain to a certain limited extent. (6\/4. 'The Effects of Cross and Self-\nfertilisation' 1876 page 441.) If it be further asked why some species have been\nadapted for this end by being made heterostyled, rather than by any of the above\nspecified means, the answer probably lies in the manner in which heterostylism\noriginated,--a subject immediately to be discussed. Heterostyled species,\nhowever, have an advantage over dichogamous species, as all the flowers on the\nsame heterostyled plant belong to the same form, so that when fertilised\nlegitimately by insects two distinct individuals are sure to intercross. On the\nother hand, with dichogamous plants, early or late flowers on the same\nindividual may intercross; and a cross of this kind does hardly any or no good.\nWhenever it is profitable to a species to produce a large number of seeds and\nthis obviously is a very common case, heterostyled will have an advantage over\ndioecious plants, as all the individuals of the former, whilst only half of the\nlatter, that is the females, yield seeds. On the other hand, heterostyled plants\nseem to have no advantage, as far as cross-fertilisation is concerned, over\nthose which are sterile with their own pollen. They lie indeed under a slight\ndisadvantage, for if two self-sterile plants grow near together and far removed\nfrom all other plants of the same species, they will mutually and perfectly\nfertilise one another, whilst this will not be the case with heterostyled\ndimorphic plants, unless they chance to belong to opposite forms.\n\nIt may be added that species which are trimorphic have one slight advantage over\nthe dimorphic; for if only two individuals of a dimorphic species happen to grow\nnear together in an isolated spot, the chances are even that both will belong to\nthe same form, and in this case they will not produce the full number of\nvigorous and fertile seedlings; all these, moreover, will tend strongly to\nbelong to the same form as their parents. On the other hand, if two plants of\nthe same trimorphic species happen to grow in an isolated spot, the chances are\ntwo to one in favour of their not belonging to the same form; and in this case\nthey will legitimately fertilise one another, and yield the full complement of\nvigorous offspring.\n\nTHE MEANS BY WHICH PLANTS MAY HAVE BEEN RENDERED HETEROSTYLED.\n\nThis is a very obscure subject, on which I can throw little light, but which is\nworthy of discussion. It has been shown that heterostyled plants occur in\nfourteen natural families, dispersed throughout the whole vegetable kingdom, and\nthat even within the family of the Rubiaceae they are dispersed in eight of the\ntribes. We may therefore conclude that this structure has been acquired by\nvarious plants independently of inheritance from a common progenitor, and that\nit can be acquired without any great difficulty--that is, without any very\nunusual combination of circumstances.\n\nIt is probable that the first step towards a species becoming heterostyled is\ngreat variability in the length of the pistil and stamens, or of the pistil\nalone. Such variations are not very rare: with Amsinckia spectabilis and Nolana\nprostrata these organs differ so much in length in different individuals that,\nuntil experimenting on them, I thought both species heterostyled. The stigma of\nGesneria pendulina sometimes protrudes far beyond, and is sometimes seated\nbeneath the anthers; so it is with Oxalis acetosella and various other plants. I\nhave also noticed an extraordinary amount of difference in the length of the\npistil in cultivated varieties of Primula veris and vulgaris.\n\nAs most plants are at least occasionally cross-fertilised by the aid of insects,\nwe may assume that this was the case with our supposed varying plant; but that\nit would have been beneficial to it to have been more regularly cross-\nfertilised. We should bear in mind how important an advantage it has been proved\nto be to many plants, though in different degrees and ways, to be cross-\nfertilised. It might well happen that our supposed species did not vary in\nfunction in the right manner, so as to become either dichogamous or completely\nself-sterile, or in structure so as to ensure cross-fertilisation. If it had\nthus varied, it would never have been rendered heterostyled, as this state would\nthen have been superfluous. But the parent-species of our several existing\nheterostyled plants may have been, and probably were (judging from their present\nconstitution) in some degree self-sterile; and this would have made regular\ncross-fertilisation still more desirable.\n\nNow let us take a highly varying species with most or all of the anthers\nexserted in some individuals, and in others seated low down in the corolla; with\nthe stigma also varying in position in like manner. Insects which visited such\nflowers would have different parts of their bodies dusted with pollen, and it\nwould be a mere chance whether this were left on the stigma of the next flower\nwhich was visited. If all the anthers could have been placed on the same level\nin all the plants, then abundant pollen would have adhered to the same part of\nthe body of the insects which frequented the flowers, and would afterwards have\nbeen deposited without loss on the stigma, if it likewise stood on the same\nunvarying level in all the flowers. But as the stamens and pistils are supposed\nto have already varied much in length and to be still varying, it might well\nhappen that they could be reduced much more easily through natural selection\ninto two sets of different lengths in different individuals, than all to the\nsame length and level in all the individuals. We know from innumerable\ninstances, in which the two sexes and the young of the same species differ, that\nthere is no difficulty in two or more sets of individuals being formed which\ninherit different characters. In our particular case the law of compensation or\nbalancement (which is admitted by many botanists) would tend to cause the pistil\nto be reduced in those individuals in which the stamens were greatly developed,\nand to be increased in length in those which had their stamens but little\ndeveloped.\n\nNow if in our varying species the longer stamens were to be nearly equalised in\nlength in a considerable body of individuals, with the pistil more or less\nreduced; and in another body, the shorter stamens to be similarly equalised,\nwith the pistil more or less increased in length, cross-fertilisation would be\nsecured with little loss of pollen; and this change would be so highly\nbeneficial to the species, that there is no difficulty in believing that it\ncould be effected through natural selection. Our plant would then make a close\napproach in structure to a heterostyled dimorphic species; or to a trimorphic\nspecies, if the stamens were reduced to two lengths in the same flower in\ncorrespondence with that of the pistils in the other two forms. But we have not\nas yet even touched on the chief difficulty in understanding how heterostyled\nspecies could have originated. A completely self-sterile plant or a dichogamous\none can fertilise and be fertilised by any other individual of the same species;\nwhereas the essential character of a heterostyled plant is that an individual of\none form cannot fully fertilise or be fertilised by an individual of the same\nform, but only by one belonging to another form.\n\nH. Muller has suggested that ordinary or homostyled plants may have been\nrendered heterostyled merely through the effects of habit. (6\/5. 'Die\nBefruchtung der Blumen' page 352.) Whenever pollen from one set of anthers is\nhabitually applied to a pistil of particular length in a varying species, he\nbelieves that at last the possibility of fertilisation in any other manner will\nbe nearly or completely lost. He was led to this view by observing that Diptera\nfrequently carried pollen from the long-styled flowers of Hottonia to the stigma\nof the same form, and that this illegitimate union was not nearly so sterile as\nthe corresponding union in other heterostyled species. But this conclusion is\ndirectly opposed by some other cases, for instance by that of Linum\ngrandiflorum; for here the long-styled form is utterly barren with its own-form\npollen, although from the position of the anthers this pollen is invariably\napplied to the stigma. It is obvious that with heterostyled dimorphic plants the\ntwo female and the two male organs differ in power; for if the same kind of\npollen be placed on the stigmas of the two forms, and again if the two kinds of\npollen be placed on the stigmas of the same form, the results are in each case\nwidely different. Nor can we see how this differentiation of the two female and\ntwo male organs could have been effected merely through each kind of pollen\nbeing habitually placed on one of the two stigmas.\n\nAnother view seems at first sight probable, namely, that an incapacity to be\nfertilised in certain ways has been specially acquired by heterostyled plants.\nWe may suppose that our varying species was somewhat sterile (as is often the\ncase) with pollen from its own stamens, whether these were long or short; and\nthat such sterility was transferred to all the individuals with pistils and\nstamens of the same length, so that these became incapable of intercrossing\nfreely; but that such sterility was eliminated in the case of the individuals\nwhich differed in the length of their pistils and stamens. It is, however,\nincredible that so peculiar a form of mutual infertility should have been\nspecially acquired unless it were highly beneficial to the species; and although\nit may be beneficial to an individual plant to be sterile with its own pollen,\ncross-fertilisation being thus ensured, how can it be any advantage to a plant\nto be sterile with half its brethren, that is, with all the individuals\nbelonging to the same form? Moreover, if the sterility of the unions between\nplants of the same form had been a special acquirement, we might have expected\nthat the long-styled form fertilised by the long-styled would have been sterile\nin the same degree as the short-styled fertilised by the short-styled; but this\nis hardly ever the case. On the contrary, there is sometimes the widest\ndifference in this respect, as between the two illegitimate unions of Pulmonaria\nangustifolia and of Hottonia palustris.\n\nIt is a more probable view that the male and female organs in two sets of\nindividuals have been by some means specially adapted for reciprocal action; and\nthat the sterility between the individuals of the same set or form is an\nincidental and purposeless result. The meaning of the term \"incidental\" may be\nillustrated by the greater or less difficulty in grafting or budding together\ntwo plants belonging to distinct species; for as this capacity is quite\nimmaterial to the welfare of either, it cannot have been specially acquired, and\nmust be the incidental result of differences in their vegetative systems. But\nhow the sexual elements of heterostyled plants came to differ from what they\nwere whilst the species was homostyled, and how they became co-adapted in two\nsets of individuals, are very obscure points. We know that in the two forms of\nour existing heterostyled plants the pistil always differs, and the stamens\ngenerally differ in length; so does the stigma in structure, the anthers in\nsize, and the pollen-grains in diameter. It appears, therefore, at first sight\nprobable that organs which differ in such important respects could act on one\nanother only in some manner for which they had been specially adapted. The\nprobability of this view is supported by the curious rule that the greater the\ndifference in length between the pistils and stamens of the trimorphic species\nof Lythrum and Oxalis, the products of which are united for reproduction, by so\nmuch the greater is the infertility of the union. The same rule applies to the\ntwo illegitimate unions of some dimorphic species, namely, Primula vulgaris and\nPulmonaria angustifolia; but it entirely fails in other cases, as with Hottonia\npalustris and Linum grandiflorum. We shall, however, best perceive the\ndifficulty of understanding the nature and origin of the co-adaptation between\nthe reproductive organs of the two forms of heterostyled plants, by considering\nthe case of Linum grandiflorum: the two forms of this plant differ exclusively,\nas far as we can see, in the length of their pistils; in the long-styled form,\nthe stamens equal the pistil in length, but their pollen has no more effect on\nit than so much inorganic dust; whilst this pollen fully fertilises the short\npistil of the other form. Now, it is scarcely credible that a mere difference in\nthe length of the pistil can make a wide difference in its capacity for being\nfertilised. We can believe this the less because with some plants, for instance,\nAmsinckia spectabilis, the pistil varies greatly in length without affecting the\nfertility of the individuals which are intercrossed. So again I observed that\nthe same plants of Primula veris and vulgaris differed to an extraordinary\ndegree in the length of their pistils during successive seasons; nevertheless\nthey yielded during these seasons exactly the same average number of seeds when\nleft to fertilise themselves spontaneously under a net.\n\nWe must therefore look to the appearance of inner or hidden constitutional\ndifferences between the individuals of a varying species, of such a nature that\nthe male element of one set is enabled to act efficiently only on the female\nelement of another set. We need not doubt about the possibility of variations in\nthe constitution of the reproductive system of a plant, for we know that some\nspecies vary so as to be completely self-sterile or completely self-fertile,\neither in an apparently spontaneous manner or from slightly changed conditions\nof life. Gartner also has shown that the individual plants of the same species\nvary in their sexual powers in such a manner that one will unite with a distinct\nspecies much more readily than another. (6\/6. Gartner 'Bastarderzeugung im\nPflanzenreich' 1849 page 165.) But what the nature of the inner constitutional\ndifferences may be between the sets or forms of the same varying species, or\nbetween distinct species, is quite unknown. It seems therefore probable that the\nspecies which have become heterostyled at first varied so that two or three sets\nof individuals were formed differing in the length of their pistils and stamens\nand in other co-adapted characters, and that almost simultaneously their\nreproductive powers became modified in such a manner that the sexual elements in\none set were adapted to act on the sexual elements of another set; and\nconsequently that these elements in the same set or form incidentally became\nill-adapted for mutual interaction, as in the case of distinct species. I have\nelsewhere shown that the sterility of species when first crossed and of their\nhybrid offspring must also be looked at as merely an incidental result,\nfollowing from the special co-adaptation of the sexual elements of the same\nspecies. (6\/7. 'Origin of Species' 6th edition page 247; 'Variation of Animals\nand Plants under Domestication' 2nd edition volume 2 page 169; 'The Effects of\nCross and Self-fertilisation' page 463. It may be well here to remark that,\njudging from the remarkable power with which abruptly changed conditions of life\nact on the reproductive system of most organisms, it is probable that the close\nadaptation of the male to the female elements in the two forms of the same\nheterostyled species, or in all the individuals of the same ordinary species,\ncould be acquired only under long-continued nearly uniform conditions of life.)\nWe can thus understand the striking parallelism, which has been shown to exist\nbetween the effects of illegitimately uniting heterostyled plants and of\ncrossing distinct species. The great difference in the degree of sterility\nbetween the various heterostyled species when illegitimately fertilised, and\nbetween the two forms of the same species when similarly fertilised, harmonises\nwell with the view that the result is an incidental one which follows from\nchanges gradually effected in their reproductive systems, in order that the\nsexual elements of the distinct forms should act perfectly on one another.\n\nTRANSMISSION OF THE TWO FORMS BY HETEROSTYLED PLANTS.\n\nThe transmission of the two forms by heterostyled plants, with respect to which\nmany facts were given in the last chapter, may perhaps be found hereafter to\nthrow some light on their manner of development. Hildebrand observed that\nseedlings from the long-styled form of Primula Sinensis when fertilised with\npollen from the same form were mostly long-styled, and many analogous cases have\nsince been observed by me. All the known cases are given in Tables 6.36 and\n6.37.\n\nTABLE 6.36.

Mid-styled form, fertilised by pollen from longest stamens of\nshort-styled form : 14 : 8 : 18.\n\nOxalis rosea. Long-styled form, fertilised during several generations by own-\nform pollen, produced offspring in the ratio of : 100 : 0 : 0.\n\nOxalis hedysaroides. Mid-styled form, fertilised by own-form pollen : 0 : 17 :\n0.\n\nWe see in these two tables that the offspring from a form illegitimately\nfertilised with pollen from another plant of the same form belong, with a few\nexceptions, to the same form as their parents. For instance, out of 162\nseedlings from long-styled plants of Primula veris fertilised during five\ngenerations in this manner, 156 were long-styled and only 6 short-styled. Of 69\nseedlings from P. vulgaris similarly raised all were long-styled. So it was with\n56 seedlings from the long-styled form of the trimorphic Lythrum salicaria, and\nwith numerous seedlings from the long-styled form of Oxalis rosea. The offspring\nfrom the short-styled forms of dimorphic plants, and from both the mid-styled\nand short-styled forms of trimorphic plants, fertilised with their own-form\npollen, likewise tend to belong to the same form as their parents, but not in so\nmarked a manner as in the case of the long-styled form. There are three cases in\nTable 6.37, in which a form of Lythrum was fertilised illegitimately with pollen\nfrom another form; and in two of these cases all the offspring belonged to the\nsame two forms as their parents, whilst in the third case they belonged to all\nthree forms.\n\nThe cases hitherto given relate to illegitimate unions, but Hildebrand, Fritz\nMuller, and myself found that a very large proportion, or all of the offspring,\nfrom a legitimate union between any two forms of the trimorphic species of\nOxalis belonged to the same two forms. A similar rule therefore holds good with\nunions which are fully fertile, as with those of an illegitimate nature which\nare more or less sterile. When some of the seedlings from a heterostyled plant\nbelong to a different form from that of its parents, Hildebrand accounts for the\nfact by reversion. For instance, the long-styled parent-plant of Primula veris,\nfrom which the 162 illegitimate seedlings in Table 6.36 were derived in the\ncourse of five generations, was itself no doubt derived from the union of a\nlong-styled and a short-styled parent; and the 6 short-styled seedlings may be\nattributed to reversion to their short-styled progenitor. But it is a surprising\nfact in this case, and in other similar ones, that the number of the offspring\nwhich thus reverted was not larger. The fact is rendered still more strange in\nthe particular instance of P. veris, for there was no reversion until four or\nfive generations of long-styled plants had been raised. It may be seen in both\ntables that the long-styled form transmits its form much more faithfully than\ndoes the short-styled, when both are fertilised with their own-form pollen; and\nwhy this should be so it is difficult to conjecture, unless it be that the\naboriginal parent-form of most heterostyled species possessed a pistil which\nexceeded its own stamens considerably in length. (6\/8. It may be suspected that\nthis was the case with Primula, judging from the length of the pistil in several\nallied genera (see Mr. J. Scott 'Journal of the Linnean Society Botany' volume 8\n1864 page 85). Herr Breitenbach found many specimens of Primula elatior growing\nin a state of nature with some flowers on the same plant long-styled, others\nshort-styled and others equal-styled; and the long-styled form greatly\npreponderated in number; there being 61 of this form to 9 of the short-styled\nand 15 of the equal-styled.) I will only add that in a state of nature any\nsingle plant of a trimorphic species no doubt produces all three forms; and this\nmay be accounted for either by its several flowers being separately fertilised\nby both the other forms, as Hildebrand supposes; or by pollen from both the\nother forms being deposited by insects on the stigma of the same flower.\n\nEQUAL-STYLED VARIETIES.\n\nThe tendency of the dimorphic species of Primula to produce equal-styled\nvarieties deserves notice. Cases of this kind have been observed, as shown in\nthe last chapter, in no less than six species, namely, P. veris, vulgaris,\nSinensis, auricula, farinosa, and elatior. In the case of P. veris, the stamens\nresemble in length, position and size of their pollen-grains the stamens of the\nshort-styled form; whilst the pistil closely resembles that of the long-styled,\nbut as it varies much in length, one proper to the short-styled form appears to\nhave been elongated and to have assumed at the same time the functions of a\nlong-styled pistil. Consequently the flowers are capable of spontaneous self-\nfertilisation of a legitimate nature and yield a full complement of seed, or\neven more than the number produced by ordinary flowers legitimately fertilised.\nWith P. Sinensis, on the other hand, the stamens resemble in all respects the\nshorter ones proper to the long-styled form, whilst the pistil makes a near\napproach to that of the short-styled, but as it varies in length, it would\nappear as if a long-styled pistil had been reduced in length and modified in\nfunction. The flowers in this case as in the last are capable of spontaneous\nlegitimate fertilisation, and are rather more productive than ordinary flowers\nlegitimately fertilised. With P. auricula and farinosa the stamens resemble\nthose of the short-styled form in length, but those of the long-styled in the\nsize of their pollen-grains; the pistil also resembles that of the long-styled,\nso that although the stamens and pistil are of nearly equal length, and\nconsequently pollen is spontaneously deposited on the stigma, yet the flowers\nare not legitimately fertilised and yield only a very moderate supply of seed.\nWe thus see, firstly, that equal-styled varieties have originated in various\nways, and, secondly, that the combination of the two forms in the same flower\ndiffers in completeness. With P. elatior some of the flowers on the same plant\nhave become equal-styled, instead of all of them as in the other species.\n\nMr. Scott has suggested that the equal-styled varieties arise through reversion\nto the former homostyled condition of the genus. This view is supported by the\nremarkable fidelity with which the equal-styled variation is transmitted after\nit has once appeared. I have shown in Chapter 13 of my 'Variation of Animals and\nPlants under Domestication,' that any cause which disturbs the constitution\ntends to induce reversion, and it is chiefly the cultivated species of Primula\nwhich become equal-styled. Illegitimate fertilisation, which is an abnormal\nprocess, is likewise an exciting cause; and with illegitimately descended long-\nstyled plants of P. Sinensis, I have observed the first appearance and\nsubsequent stages of this variation. With some other plants of P. Sinensis of\nsimilar parentage the flowers appeared to have reverted to their original wild\ncondition. Again, some hybrids between P. veris and vulgaris were strictly\nequal-styled, and others made a near approach to this structure. All these facts\nsupport the view that this variation results, at least in part, from reversion\nto the original state of the genus, before the species had become heterostyled.\nOn the other hand, some considerations indicate, as previously remarked, that\nthe aboriginal parent-form of Primula had a pistil which exceeded the stamens in\nlength. The fertility of the equal-styled varieties has been somewhat modified,\nbeing sometimes greater and sometimes less than that of a legitimate union.\nAnother view, however, may be taken with respect to the origin of the equal-\nstyled varieties, and their appearance may be compared with that of\nhermaphrodites amongst animals which properly have their sexes separated; for\nthe two sexes are combined in a monstrous hermaphrodite in a somewhat similar\nmanner as the two sexual forms are combined in the same flower of an equal-\nstyled variety of a heterostyled species.\n\nFINAL REMARKS.\n\nThe existence of plants which have been rendered heterostyled is a highly\nremarkable phenomenon, as the two or three forms of the same undoubted species\ndiffer not only in important points of structure, but in the nature of their\nreproductive powers. As far as structure is concerned, the two sexes of many\nanimals and of some plants differ to an extreme degree; and in both kingdoms the\nsame species may consist of males, females, and hermaphrodites. Certain\nhermaphrodite cirripedes are aided in their reproduction by a whole cluster of\nwhat I have called complemental males, which differ wonderfully from the\nordinary hermaphrodite form. With ants we have males and females, and two or\nthree castes of sterile females or workers. With Termites there are, as Fritz\nMuller has shown, both winged and wingless males and females, besides the\nworkers. But in none of these cases is there any reason to believe that the\nseveral males or several females of the same species differ in their sexual\npowers, except in the atrophied condition of the reproductive organs in the\nworkers of social insects. Many hermaphrodite animals must unite for\nreproduction, but the necessity of such union apparently depends solely on their\nstructure. On the other hand, with heterostyled dimorphic species there are two\nfemales and two sets of males, and with trimorphic species three females and\nthree sets of males, which differ essentially in their sexual powers. We shall,\nperhaps, best perceive the complex and extraordinary nature of the marriage\narrangements of a trimorphic plant by the following illustration. Let us suppose\nthat the individuals of the same species of ant always lived in triple\ncommunities; and that in one of these, a large-sized female (differing also in\nother characters) lived with six middle-sized and six small-sized males; in the\nsecond community a middle-sized female lived with six large- and six small-sized\nmales; and in the third, a small-sized female lived with six large- and six\nmiddle-sized males. Each of these three females, though enabled to unite with\nany male, would be nearly sterile with her own two sets of males, and likewise\nwith two other sets of males of the same size with her own which lived in the\nother two communities; but she would be fully fertile when paired with a male of\nher own size. Hence the thirty-six males, distributed by half-dozens in the\nthree communities, would be divided into three sets of a dozen each; and these\nsets, as well as the three females, would differ from one another in their\nreproductive powers in exactly the same manner as do the distinct species of the\nsame genus. But it is a still more remarkable fact that young ants raised from\nany one of the three female ants, illegitimately fertilised by a male of a\ndifferent size would resemble in a whole series of relations the hybrid\noffspring from a cross between two distinct species of ants. They would be\ndwarfed in stature, and more or less, or even utterly barren. Naturalists are so\nmuch accustomed to behold great diversities of structure associated with the two\nsexes, that they feel no surprise at almost any amount of difference; but\ndifferences in sexual nature have been thought to be the very touchstone of\nspecific distinction. We now see that such sexual differences--the greater or\nless power of fertilising and being fertilised--may characterise the co-existing\nindividuals of the same species, in the same manner as they characterise and\nhave kept separate those groups of individuals, produced during the lapse of\nages, which we rank and denominate as distinct species.\n\n\nCHAPTER VII.\nPOLYGAMOUS, DIOECIOUS, AND GYNO-DIOECIOUS PLANTS.\n\nThe conversion in various ways of hermaphrodite into dioecious plants.\nHeterostyled plants rendered dioecious.\nRubiaceae.\nVerbenaceae.\nPolygamous and sub-dioecious plants.\nEuonymus.\nFragaria.\nThe two sub-forms of both sexes of Rhamnus and Epigaea.\nIlex.\nGyno-dioecious plants.\nThymus, difference in fertility of the hermaphrodite and female individuals.\nSatureia.\nManner in which the two forms probably originated.\nScabiosa and other gyno-dioecious plants.\nDifference in the size of the corolla in the forms of polygamous, dioecious, and\ngyno-dioecious plants.\n\nThere are several groups of plants in which all the species are dioecious, and\nthese exhibit no rudiments in the one sex of the organs proper to the other.\nAbout the origin of such plants nothing is known. It is possible that they may\nbe descended from ancient lowly organised forms, which had from the first their\nsexes separated; so that they have never existed as hermaphrodites. There are,\nhowever, many other groups of species and single ones, which from being allied\non all sides to hermaphrodites, and from exhibiting in the female flowers plain\nrudiments of male organs, and conversely in the male flowers rudiments of female\norgans, we may feel sure are descended from plants which formerly had the two\nsexes combined in the same flower. It is a curious and obscure problem how and\nwhy such hermaphrodites have been rendered bisexual.\n\nIf in some individuals of a species the stamens alone were to abort, females and\nhermaphrodites would be left existing, of which many instances occur; and if the\nfemale organs of the hermaphrodite were afterwards to abort, the result would be\na dioecious plant. Conversely, if we imagine the female organs alone to abort in\nsome individuals, males and hermaphrodites would be left; and the hermaphrodites\nmight afterwards be converted into females.\n\nIn other cases, as in that of the common Ash-tree mentioned in the Introduction,\nthe stamens are rudimentary in some individuals, the pistils in others, others\nagain remaining as hermaphrodites. Here the modification of the two sets of\norgans appears to have occurred simultaneously, as far as we can judge from\ntheir equal state of abortion. If the hermaphrodites were supplanted by the\nindividuals having separated sexes, and if these latter were equalised in\nnumber, a strictly dioecious species would be formed.\n\nThere is much difficulty in understanding why hermaphrodite plants should ever\nhave been rendered dioecious. There would be no such conversion, unless pollen\nwas already carried regularly by insects or by the wind from one individual to\nthe other; for otherwise every step towards dioeciousness would lead towards\nsterility. As we must assume that cross-fertilisation was assured before an\nhermaphrodite could be changed into a dioecious plant, we may conclude that the\nconversion has not been effected for the sake of gaining the great benefits\nwhich follow from cross-fertilisation. We can, however, see that if a species\nwere subjected to unfavourable conditions from severe competition with other\nplants, or from any other cause, the production of the male and female elements\nand the maturation of the ovules by the same individual, might prove too great a\nstrain on its powers, and the separation of the sexes would then be highly\nbeneficial. This, however, would be effected only under the contingency of a\nreduced number of seeds, produced by the females alone, being sufficient to keep\nup the stock.\n\nThere is another way of looking at the subject which partially removes a\ndifficulty that appears at first sight insuperable, namely, that during the\nconversion of an hermaphrodite into a dioecious plant, the male organs must\nabort in some individuals and the female organs in others. Yet as all are\nexposed to the same conditions, it might have been expected that those which\nvaried would tend to vary in the same manner. As a general rule only a few\nindividuals of a species vary simultaneously in the same manner; and there is no\nimprobability in the assumption that some few individuals might produce larger\nseeds than the average, better stocked with nourishment. If the production of\nsuch seeds were highly beneficial to a species, and on this head there can be\nlittle doubt, the variety with the large seeds would tend to increase. (7\/1. See\nthe facts given in 'The Effects of Cross and Self-fertilisation' page 353.) But\nin accordance with the law of compensation we might expect that the individuals\nwhich produced such seeds would, if living under severe conditions, tend to\nproduce less and less pollen, so that their anthers would be reduced in size and\nmight ultimately become rudimentary. This view occurred to me owing to a\nstatement by Sir J.E. Smith that there are female and hermaphrodite plants of\nSerratula tinctoria, and that the seeds of the former are larger than those of\nthe hermaphrodite form. (7\/2. 'Transactions of the Linnean Society' volume 8\npage 600.) It may also be worth while to recall the case of the mid-styled form\nof Lythrum salicaria, which produces a larger number of seeds than the other\nforms, and has somewhat smaller pollen-grains which have less fertilising power\nthan those of the corresponding stamens in the other two forms; but whether the\nlarger number of seeds is the indirect cause of the diminished power of the\npollen, or vice versa, I know not. As soon as the anthers in a certain number of\nindividuals became reduced in size in the manner just suggested or from any\nother cause, the other individuals would have to produce a larger supply of\npollen; and such increased development would tend to reduce the female organs\nthrough the law of compensation, so as ultimately to leave them in a rudimentary\ncondition; and the species would then become dioecious.\n\nInstead of the first change occurring in the female organs we may suppose that\nthe male ones first varied, so that some individuals produced a larger supply of\npollen. This would be beneficial under certain circumstances, such as a change\nin the nature of the insects which visited the flowers, or in their becoming\nmore anemophilous, for such plants require an enormous quantity of pollen. The\nincreased action of the male organs would tend to affect through compensation\nthe female organs of the same flower; and the final result would be that the\nspecies would consist of males and hermaphrodites. But it is of no use\nconsidering this case and other analogous ones, for, as stated in the\nIntroduction, the coexistence of male and hermaphrodite plants is excessively\nrare.\n\nIt is no valid objection to the foregoing views that changes of such a nature\nwould be effected with extreme slowness, for we shall presently see good reason\nto believe that various hermaphrodite plants have become or are becoming\ndioecious by many and excessively small steps. In the case of polygamous\nspecies, which exist as males, females and hermaphrodites, the latter would have\nto be supplanted before the species could become strictly dioecious; but the\nextinction of the hermaphrodite form would probably not be difficult, as a\ncomplete separation of the sexes appears often to be in some way beneficial. The\nmales and females would also have to be equalised in number, or produced in some\nfitting proportion for the effectual fertilisation of the females.\n\nThere are, no doubt, many unknown laws which govern the suppression of the male\nor female organs in hermaphrodite plants, quite independently of any tendency in\nthem to become monoecious, dioecious, or polygamous. We see this in those\nhermaphrodites which from the rudiments still present manifestly once possessed\nmore stamens or pistils than they now do,--even twice as many, as a whole\nverticil has often been suppressed. Robert Brown remarks that \"the order of\nreduction or abortion of the stamina in any natural family may with some\nconfidence be predicted,\" by observing in other members of the family, in which\ntheir number is complete, the order of the dehiscence of the anthers (7\/3.\n'Transactions of the Linnean Society' volume 12 page 98 or 'Miscellaneous Works'\nvolume 2 pages 278-81.); for the lesser permanence of an organ is generally\nconnected with its lesser perfection, and he judges of perfection by priority of\ndevelopment. He also states that whenever there is a separation of the sexes in\nan hermaphrodite plant, which bears flowers on a simple spike, it is the females\nwhich expand first; and this he likewise attributes to the female sex being the\nmore perfect of the two, but why the female should be thus valued he does not\nexplain.\n\nPlants under cultivation or changed conditions of life frequently become\nsterile; and the male organs are much oftener affected than the female, though\nthe latter alone are sometimes affected. The sterility of the stamens is\ngenerally accompanied by a reduction in their size; and we may feel sure, from a\nwide-spread analogy, that both the male and female organs would become\nrudimentary in the course of many generations if they failed altogether to\nperform their proper functions. According to Gartner, if the anthers on a plant\nare contabescent (and when this occurs it is always at a very early period of\ngrowth) the female organs are sometimes precociously developed. (7\/4. 'Beitrage\nzur Kenntniss' etc. page 117 et seq. The whole subject of the sterility of\nplants from various causes has been discussed in my 'Variation of Animals and\nPlants under Domestication' chapter 18 2nd edition volume 2 pages 146-56.) I\nmention this case as it appears to be one of compensation. So again is the well-\nknown fact, that plants which increase largely by stolons or other such means\nare often utterly barren, with a large proportion of their pollen-grains in a\nworthless condition.\n\nHildebrand has shown that with hermaphrodite plants which are strongly\nproterandrous, the stamens in the flowers which open first sometimes abort; and\nthis seems to follow from their being useless, as no pistils are then ready to\nbe fertilised. Conversely the pistils in the flowers which open last sometimes\nabort; as when they are ready for fertilisation all the pollen has been shed. He\nfurther shows by means of a series of gradations amongst the Compositae, that a\ntendency from the causes just specified to produce either male or female\nflorets, sometimes spreads to all the florets on the same head, and sometimes\neven to the whole plant (7\/5. 'Ueber die Geschlechtsverhaltnisse bei den\nCompositen' 1869 page 89.); and in this latter case the species becomes\ndioecious. In those rare instances mentioned in the Introduction, in which some\nof the individuals of both monoecious and hermaphrodite plants are\nproterandrous, others being proterogynous, their conversion into a dioecious\ncondition would probably be much facilitated, as they already consist of two\nbodies of individuals, differing to a certain extent in their reproductive\nfunctions.\n\nDimorphic heterostyled plants offer still more strongly marked facilities for\nbecoming dioecious; for they likewise consist of two bodies of individuals in\napproximately equal numbers, and what probably is more important, both the male\nand female organs differ in the two forms, not only in structure but in\nfunction, in nearly the same manner as do the reproductive organs of two\ndistinct species belonging to the same genus. Now if two species are subjected\nto changed conditions, though of the same nature, it is notorious that they are\noften affected very differently; therefore the male organs, for instance, in one\nform of a heterostyled plant might be affected by those unknown causes which\ninduce abortion, differently from the homologous but functionally different\norgans in the other form; and so conversely with the female organs. Thus the\ngreat difficulty before alluded to is much lessened in understanding how any\ncause whatever could lead to the simultaneous reduction and ultimate suppression\nof the male organs in half the individuals of a species, and of the female\norgans in the other half, whilst all were subjected to exactly the same\nconditions of life.\n\nThat such reduction or suppression has occurred in some heterostyled plants is\nalmost certain. The Rubiaceae contain more heterostyled genera than any other\nfamily, and from their wide distribution we may infer that many of them became\nheterostyled at a remote period, so that there will have been ample time for\nsome of the species to have been since rendered dioecious. Asa Gray informs me\nthat Coprosma is dioecious, and that it is closely allied through Nertera to\nMitchella, which as we know is a heterostyled dimorphic species. In the male\nflowers of Coprosma the stamens are exserted, and in the female flowers the\nstigmas; so that, judging from the affinities of the above three genera, it\nseems probable that an ancient short-styled form bearing long stamens with large\nanthers and large pollen-grains (as in the case of several Rubiaceous genera)\nhas been converted into the male Coprosma; and that an ancient long-styled form\nwith short stamens, small anthers and small pollen-grains has been converted\ninto the female form. But according to Mr. Meehan, Mitchella itself is dioecious\nin some districts; for he says that one form has small sessile anthers without a\ntrace of pollen, the pistil being perfect; while in another form the stamens are\nperfect and the pistil rudimentary. (7\/6. 'Proceedings of the Academy of\nSciences of Philadelphia' July 28, 1868 page 183.) He adds that plants may be\nobserved in the autumn bearing an abundant crop of berries, and others without a\nsingle one. Should these statements be confirmed, Mitchella will be proved to be\nheterostyled in one district and dioecious in another.\n\nAsperula is likewise a Rubiaceous genus, and from the published description of\nthe two forms of A. scoparia, an inhabitant of Tasmania, I did not doubt that it\nwas heterostyled; but on examining some flowers sent me by Dr. Hooker they\nproved to be dioecious. The male flowers have large anthers and a very small\novarium, surmounted by a mere vestige of a stigma without any style; whilst the\nfemale flowers possess a large ovarium, the anthers being rudimentary and\napparently quite destitute of pollen. Considering how many Rubiaceous genera are\nheterostyled, it is a reasonable suspicion that this Asperula is descended from\na heterostyled progenitor; but we should be cautious on this head, for there is\nno improbability in a homostyled Rubiaceous plant becoming dioecious. Moreover,\nin an allied plant, Galium cruciatum, the female organs have been suppressed in\nmost of the lower flowers, whilst the upper ones remain hermaphrodite; and here\nwe have a modification of the sexual organs without any connection with\nheterostylism.\n\nMr. Thwaites informs me that in Ceylon various Rubiaceous plants are\nheterostyled; but in the case of Discospermum one of the two forms is always\nbarren, the ovary containing about two aborted ovules in each loculus; whilst in\nthe other form each loculus contains several perfect ovules; so that the species\nappears to be strictly dioecious.\n\nMost of the species of the South American genus Aegiphila, a member of the\nVerbenaceae, apparently are heterostyled; and both Fritz Muller and myself\nthought that this was the case with Ae. obdurata, so closely did its flowers\nresemble those of the heterostyled species. But on examining the flowers, the\nanthers of the long-styled form were found to be entirely destitute of pollen\nand less than half the size of those in the other form, the pistil being\nperfectly developed. On the other hand, in the short-styled form the stigmas are\nreduced to half their proper length, having also an abnormal appearance; whilst\nthe stamens are perfect. This plant therefore is dioecious; and we may, I think,\nconclude that a short-styled progenitor, bearing long stamens exserted beyond\nthe corolla, has been converted into the male; and a long-styled progenitor with\nfully developed stigmas into the female.\n\nFrom the number of bad pollen-grains in the small anthers of the short stamens\nof the long-styled form of Pulmonaria angustifolia, we may suspect that this\nform is tending to become female; but it does not appear that the other or\nshort-styled form is becoming more masculine. Certain appearances countenance\nthe belief that the reproductive system of Phlox subulata is likewise undergoing\na change of some kind.\n\nI have now given the few cases known to me in which heterostyled plants appear\nwith some considerable degree of probability to have been rendered dioecious.\nNor ought we to expect to find many such cases, for the number of heterostyled\nspecies is by no means large, at least in Europe, where they could hardly have\nescaped notice. Therefore the number of dioecious species which owe their origin\nto the transformation of heterostyled plants is probably not so large as might\nhave been anticipated from the facilities which they offer for such conversion.\n\nIn searching for cases like the foregoing ones, I have been led to examine some\ndioecious or sub-dioecious plants, which are worth describing, chiefly as they\nshow by what fine gradations hermaphrodites may pass into polygamous or\ndioecious species.\n\nPOLYGAMOUS, DIOECIOUS, AND SUB-DIOECIOUS PLANTS.\n\nEuonymus Europaeus (CELASTRINEAE).\n\n(Figure 7.12. Euonymus Europaeus\nLeft: Hermaphrodite or male.\nRight: Female.)\n\nThe spindle-tree is described in all the botanical works which I have consulted\nas an hermaphrodite. Asa Gray speaks of the flowers of the American species as\nperfect, whilst those in the allied genus Celastrus are said to be \"polygamo-\ndioecious.\" If a number of bushes of our spindle-tree be examined, about half\nwill be found to have stamens equal in length to the pistil, with well-developed\nanthers; the pistil being likewise to all appearance well developed. The other\nhalf have a perfect pistil, with the stamens short, bearing rudimentary anthers\ndestitute of pollen; so that these bushes are females. All the flowers on the\nsame plant present the same structure. The female corolla is smaller than that\non the polleniferous bushes. The two forms are shown in Figure 7.12.\n\nI did not at first doubt that this species existed under an hermaphrodite and\nfemale form; but we shall presently see that some of the bushes which appear to\nbe hermaphrodites never produce fruit, and these are in fact males. The species,\ntherefore, is polygamous in the sense in which I use the term, and trioecious.\nThe flowers are frequented by many Diptera and some small Hymenoptera for the\nsake of the nectar secreted by the disc, but I did not see a single bee at work;\nnevertheless the other insects sufficed to fertilise effectually female bushes\ngrowing at a distance of even 30 yards from any polleniferous bush.\n\nThe small anthers borne by the short stamens of the female flowers are well\nformed and dehisce properly, but I could never find in them a single grain of\npollen. It is somewhat difficult to compare the length of the pistils in the two\nforms, as they vary somewhat in this respect and continue to grow after the\nanthers are mature. The pistils, therefore, in old flowers on a polleniferous\nplant are often of considerably greater length than in young flowers on a female\nplant. On this account the pistils from five flowers from so many hermaphrodite\nor male bushes were compared with those from five female bushes, before the\nanthers had dehisced and whilst the rudimentary ones were of a pink colour and\nnot at all shrivelled. These two sets of pistils did not differ in length, or if\nthere was any difference those of the polleniferous flowers were rather the\nlongest. In one hermaphrodite plant, which produced during three years very few\nand poor fruit, the pistil much exceeded in length the stamens bearing perfect\nand as yet closed anthers; and I never saw such a case on any female plant. It\nis a surprising fact that the pistil in the male and in the semi-sterile\nhermaphrodite flowers has not been reduced in length, seeing that it performs\nvery poorly or not at all its proper function. The stigmas in the two forms are\nexactly alike; and in some of the polleniferous plants which never produced any\nfruit I found that the surface of the stigma was viscid, so that pollen-grains\nadhered to it and had exserted their tubes. The ovules are of equal size in the\ntwo forms. Therefore the most acute botanist, judging only by structure, would\nnever have suspected that some of the bushes were in function exclusively males.\n\nThirteen bushes growing near one another in a hedge consisted of eight females\nquite destitute of pollen and of five hermaphrodites with well-developed\nanthers. In the autumn the eight females were well covered with fruit, excepting\none, which bore only a moderate number. Of the five hermaphrodites, one bore a\ndozen or two fruits, and the remaining four bushes several dozen; but their\nnumber was as nothing compared with those on the female bushes, for a single\nbranch, between two and three feet in length, from one of the latter, yielded\nmore than any one of the hermaphrodite bushes. The difference in the amount of\nfruit produced by the two sets of bushes is all the more striking, as from the\nsketches above given it is obvious that the stigmas of the polleniferous flowers\ncan hardly fail to receive their own pollen; whilst the fertilisation of the\nfemale flowers depends on pollen being brought to them by flies and the smaller\nHymenoptera, which are far from being such efficient carriers as bees.\n\nI now determined to observe more carefully during successive seasons some bushes\ngrowing in another place about a mile distant. As the female bushes were so\nhighly productive, I marked only two of them with the letters A and B, and five\npolleniferous bushes with the letters C to G. I may premise that the year 1865\nwas highly favourable for the fruiting of all the bushes, especially for the\npolleniferous ones, some of which were quite barren except under such favourable\nconditions. The season of 1864 was unfavourable. In 1863 the female A produced\n\"some fruit;\" in 1864 only 9; and in 1865, 97 fruit. The female B in 1863 was\n\"covered with fruit;\" in 1864 it bore 28; and in 1865 \"innumerable very fine\nfruits.\" I may add, that three other female trees growing close by were\nobserved, but only during 1863, and they then bore abundantly. With respect to\nthe polleniferous bushes, the one marked C did not bear a single fruit during\nthe years 1863 and 1864, but during 1865 it produced no less than 92 fruit,\nwhich, however, were very poor. I selected one of the finest branches with 15\nfruit, and these contained 20 seeds, or on an average 1.33 per fruit. I then\ntook by hazard 15 fruit from an adjoining female bush, and these contained 43\nseeds; that is, more than twice as many, or on an average 2.86 per fruit. Many\nof the fruits from the female bushes included four seeds, and only one had a\nsingle seed; whereas not one fruit from the polleniferous bushes contained four\nseeds. Moreover when the two lots of seeds were compared, it was manifest that\nthose from the female bushes were the larger. The second polleniferous bush, D,\nbore in 1863 about two dozen fruit,--in 1864 only 3 very poor fruit, each\ncontaining a single seed,--and in 1865, 20 equally poor fruit. Lastly, the three\npolleniferous bushes, E, F, and G, did not produce a single fruit during the\nthree years 1863, 1864, and 1865.\n\nWe thus see that the female bushes differ somewhat in their degree of fertility,\nand the polleniferous ones in the most marked manner. We have a perfect\ngradation from the female bush, B, which in 1865 was covered with \"innumerable\nfruits,\"--through the female A, which produced during the same year 97,--through\nthe polleniferous bush C, which produced this year 92 fruits, these, however,\ncontaining a very low average number of seeds of small size,--through the bush\nD, which produced only 20 poor fruit,--to the three bushes, E, F, and G, which\ndid not this year, or during the two previous years, produce a single fruit. If\nthese latter bushes and the more fertile female ones were to supplant the\nothers, the spindle-tree would be as strictly dioecious in function as any plant\nin the world. This case appears to me very interesting, as showing how gradually\nan hermaphrodite plant may be converted into a dioecious one. (7\/7. According to\nFritz Muller 'Botanische Zeitung' 1870 page 151, a Chamissoa (Amaranthaceae) in\nSouthern Brazil is in nearly the same state as our Euonymus. The ovules are\nequally developed in the two forms. In the female the pistil is perfect, whilst\nthe anthers are entirely destitute of pollen. In the polleniferous form, the\npistil is short and the stigmas never separate from one another, so that,\nalthough their surfaces are covered with fairly well-developed papillae, they\ncannot be fertilised, these latter plants do not commonly yield any fruit, and\nare therefore in function males. Nevertheless, on one occasion Fritz Muller\nfound flowers of this kind in which the stigmas had separated, and they produced\nsome fruit.)\n\nSeeing how general it is for organs which are almost or quite functionless to be\nreduced in size, it is remarkable that the pistils of the polleniferous plants\nshould equal or even exceed in length those of the highly fertile female plants.\nThis fact formerly led me to suppose that the spindle-tree had once been\nheterostyled; the hermaphrodite and male plants having been originally long-\nstyled, with the pistils since reduced in length, but with the stamens retaining\ntheir former dimensions; whilst the female plant had been originally short-\nstyled, with the pistil in its present state, but with the stamens since greatly\nreduced and rendered rudimentary. A conversion of this kind is at least\npossible, although it is the reverse of that which appears actually to have\noccurred with some Rubiaceous genera and Aegiphila; for with these plants the\nshort-styled form has become the male, and the long-styled the female. It is,\nhowever, a more simple view that sufficient time has not elapsed for the\nreduction of the pistil in the male and hermaphrodite flowers of our Euonymus;\nthough this view does not account for the pistils in the polleniferous flowers\nbeing sometimes longer than those in the female flowers.\n\nFragaria vesca, Virginiana, chiloensis, etc. (ROSACEAE).\n\nA tendency to the separation of the sexes in the cultivated strawberry seems to\nbe much more strongly marked in the United States than in Europe; and this\nappears to be the result of the direct action of climate on the reproductive\norgans. In the best account which I have seen, it is stated that many of the\nvarieties in the United States consist of three forms, namely, females, which\nproduce a heavy crop of fruit,--of hermaphrodites, which \"seldom produce other\nthan a very scanty crop of inferior and imperfect berries,\"--and of males, which\nproduce none. (7\/8. Mr. Leonard Wray 'Gardener's Chronicle' 1861 page 716.) The\nmost skilful cultivators plant \"seven rows of female plants, then one row of\nhermaphrodites, and so on throughout the field.\" The males bear large, the\nhermaphrodites mid-sized, and the females small flowers. The latter plants\nproduce few runners, whilst the two other forms produce many; consequently, as\nhas been observed both in England and in the United States, the polleniferous\nforms increase rapidly and tend to supplant the females. We may therefore infer\nthat much more vital force is expended in the production of ovules and fruit\nthan in the production of pollen. Another species, the Hautbois strawberry (F.\nelatior), is more strictly dioecious; but Lindley made by selection an\nhermaphrodite stock. (7\/9. For references and further information on this\nsubject, see 'Variation under Domestication' chapter 10 2nd edition volume 1\npage 375.)\n\nRhamnus catharticus (RHAMNEAE).\n\n(FIGURE 7.13. Rhamnus catharticus (from Caspary.)\nLeft: Long-styled male.\nRight: Short-styled male.)\n\n(FIGURE 7.14. Rhamnus catharticus.\nLeft: Long-styled female.\nRight: Short-styled female.)\n\nThis plant is well known to be dioecious. My son William found the two sexes\ngrowing in about equal numbers in the Isle of Wight, and sent me specimens,\ntogether with observations on them. Each sex consists of two sub-forms. The two\nforms of the male differ in their pistils: in some plants it is quite small,\nwithout any distinct stigma; in others the pistil is much more developed, with\nthe papillae on the stigmatic surfaces moderately large. The ovules in both\nkinds of males are in an aborted condition. On my mentioning this case to\nProfessor Caspary, he examined several male plants in the botanic gardens at\nKonigsberg, where there were no females, and sent me the drawings in Figure\n7.13.\n\nIn the English plants the petals are not so greatly reduced as represented in\nthis drawing. My son observed that those males which had their pistils\nmoderately well-developed bore slightly larger flowers, and, what is very\nremarkable, their pollen-grains exceeded by a little in diameter those of the\nmales with greatly reduced pistils. This fact is opposed to the belief that the\npresent species was once heterostyled; for in this case it might have been\nexpected that the shorter-styled plants would have had larger pollen-grains.\n\nIn the female plants the stamens are in an extremely rudimentary condition, much\nmore so than the pistils in the males. The pistil varies considerably in length\nin the female plants, so that they may be divided into two sub-forms according\nto the length of this organ. Both the petals and sepals are decidedly smaller in\nthe females than in the males; and the sepals do not turn downwards, as do those\nof the male flowers when mature. All the flowers on the same male or same female\nbush, though subject to some variability, belong to the same sub-form; and as my\nson never experienced any difficulty in deciding under which class a plant ought\nto be included, he believes that the two sub-forms of the same sex do not\ngraduate into one another. I can form no satisfactory theory how the four forms\nof this plant originated.\n\nRhamnus lanceolatus.\n\nThis plant exists in the United States, as I am informed by Professor Asa Gray,\nunder two hermaphrodite forms. In the one, which may be called the short-styled,\nthe flowers are sub-solitary, and include a pistil about two-thirds or only half\nas long as that in the other form; it has also shorter stigmas. The stamens are\nof equal length in the two forms; but the anthers of the short-styled contain\nrather less pollen, as far as I could judge from a few dried flowers. My son\ncompared the pollen-grains from the two forms, and those from the long-styled\nflowers were to those from the short-styled, on an average from ten\nmeasurements, as 10 to 9 in diameter; so that the two hermaphrodite forms of\nthis species resemble in this respect the two male forms of R. catharticus. The\nlong-styled form is not so common as the short-styled. The latter is said by Asa\nGray to be the more fruitful of the two, as might have been expected from its\nappearing to produce less pollen, and from the grains being of smaller size; it\nis therefore the more highly feminine of the two. The long-styled form produces\na greater number of flowers, which are clustered together instead of being sub-\nsolitary; they yield some fruit, but as just stated are less fruitful than the\nother form, so that this form appears to be the more masculine of the two. On\nthe supposition that we have here an hermaphrodite plant becoming dioecious,\nthere are two points deserving notice; firstly, the greater length of the pistil\nin the incipient male form; and we have met with a nearly similar case in the\nmale and hermaphrodite forms of Euonymus compared with the females. Secondly,\nthe larger size of the pollen-grains in the more masculine flowers, which\nperhaps may be attributed to their having retained their normal size; whilst\nthose in the incipient female flowers have been reduced. The long-styled form of\nR. lanceolatus seems to correspond with the males of R. catharticus which have a\nlonger pistil and larger pollen-grains. Light will perhaps be thrown on the\nnature of the forms in this genus, as soon as the power of both kinds of pollen\non both stigmas is ascertained. Several other species of Rhamnus are said to be\ndioecious or sub-dioecious. (7\/10. Lecoq 'Geogr. Bot.' tome 5 1856 pages 420-\n26.) On the other hand, R. frangula is an ordinary hermaphrodite, for my son\nfound a large number of bushes all bearing an equal profusion of fruit.\n\nEpigaea repens (ERICACEAE).\n\nThis plant appears to be in nearly the same state as Rhamnus catharticus. It is\ndescribed by Asa Gray as existing under four forms. (7\/11. 'American Journal of\nScience' July 1876. Also 'The American Naturalist' 1876 page 490.) (1.) With\nlong style, perfect stigma, and short abortive stamens. (2.) Shorter style, but\nwith stigma equally perfect, short abortive stamens. These two female forms\namounted to 20 per cent of the specimens received from one locality in Maine;\nbut all the fruiting specimens belonged to the first form. (3.) Style long, as\nin Number 1, but with stigma imperfect, stamens perfect. (4.) Style shorter than\nin the last, stigma imperfect, stamens perfect. These two latter forms are\nevidently males. Therefore, as Asa Gray remarks, \"the flowers may be classified\ninto two kinds, each with two modifications; the two main kinds characterised by\nthe nature and perfection of the stigma, along with more or less abortion of the\nstamens; their modifications, by the length of the style.\" Mr. Meehan has\ndescribed the extreme variability of the corolla and calyx in this plant, and\nshows that it is dioecious. (7\/12. \"Variations in Epigaea repens\" 'Proc. Acad.\nNat. Soc. of Philadelphia' May 1868 page 153.) It is much to be wished that the\npollen-grains in the two male forms should be compared, and their fertilising\npower tried on the two female forms.\n\nIlex aquifolium (AQUIFOLIACEAE).\n\nIn the several works which I have consulted, one author alone says that the\nholly is dioecious. (7\/13. Vaucher 'Hist. Phys. des Plantes d'Europe' 1841 tome\n2 page 11.) During several years I have examined many plants, but have never\nfound one that was really hermaphrodite. I mention this genus because the\nstamens in the female flowers, although quite destitute of pollen, are but\nslightly and sometimes not at all shorter than the perfect stamens in the male\nflowers. In the latter the ovary is small and the pistil is almost aborted. The\nfilaments of the perfect stamens adhere for a greater length to the petals than\nin the female flowers. The corolla of the latter is rather smaller than that of\nthe male. The male trees produce a greater number of flowers than the females.\nAsa Gray informs me that I. opaca, which represents in the United States our\ncommon holly, appears (judging from dried flowers) to be in a similar state; and\nso it is, according to Vaucher, with several other but not with all the species\nof the genus.\n\nGYNO-DIOECIOUS PLANTS.\n\nThe plants hitherto described either show a tendency to become dioecious, or\napparently have become so within a recent period. But the species now to be\nconsidered consist of hermaphrodites and females without males, and rarely show\nany tendency to be dioecious, as far as can be judged from their present\ncondition and from the absence of species having separated sexes within the same\ngroups. Species belonging to the present class, which I have called gyno-\ndioecious, are found in various widely distinct families; but are much more\ncommon in the Labiatae (as has long been noticed by botanists) than in any other\ngroup. Such cases have been noticed by myself in Thymus serpyllum and vulgaris,\nSatureia hortensis, Origanum vulgare, and Mentha hirsuta; and by others in\nNepeta glechoma, Mentha vulgaris and aquatica, and Prunella vulgaris. In these\ntwo latter species the female form, according to H. Muller, is infrequent. To\nthese must be added Dracocephalum Moldavicum, Melissa officinalis and\nclinopodium, and Hyssopus officinalis. (7\/14. H. Muller 'Die Befruchtung der\nBlumen' 1873 and 'Nature' 1873 page 161. Vaucher 'Plantes d'Europe' tome 3 page\n611. For Dracocephalum Schimper as quoted by Braun 'Annals and Magazine of\nNatural History' 2nd series volume 18 1856 page 380. Lecoq 'Geographie Bot. de\nl'Europe' tome 8 pages 33, 38, 44, etc. Both Vaucher and Lecoq were mistaken in\nthinking that several of the plants named in the text are dioecious. They appear\nto have assumed that the hermaphrodite form was a male; perhaps they were\ndeceived by the pistil not becoming fully developed and of proper length until\nsome time after the anthers have dehisced.) In the two last-named plants the\nfemale form likewise appears to be rare, for I raised many seedlings of both,\nand all were hermaphrodites. It has already been remarked in the Introduction\nthat andro-dioecious species, as they may be called, or those which consist of\nhermaphrodites and males, are extremely rare, or hardly exist.\n\nThymus serpyllum.\n\nThe hermaphrodite plants present nothing particular in the state of their\nreproductive organs; and so it is in all the following cases. The females of the\npresent species produce rather fewer flowers and have somewhat smaller corollas\nthan the hermaphrodites; so that near Torquay, where this plant abounds, I\ncould, after a little practice, distinguish the two forms whilst walking quickly\npast them. According to Vaucher, the smaller size of the corolla is common to\nthe females of most or all of the above-mentioned Labiatae. The pistil of the\nfemale, though somewhat variable in length, is generally shorter, with the\nmargins of the stigma broader and formed of more lax tissue, than that of the\nhermaphrodite. The stamens in the female vary excessively in length; they are\ngenerally enclosed within the tube of the corolla, and their anthers do not\ncontain any sound pollen; but after long search I found a single plant with the\nstamens moderately exserted, and their anthers contained a very few full-sized\ngrains, together with a multitude of minute empty ones. In some females the\nstamens are extremely short, and their minute anthers, though divided into the\ntwo normal cells or loculi, contained not a trace of pollen: in others again the\nanthers did not exceed in diameter the filaments which supported them, and were\nnot divided into two loculi. Judging from what I have myself seen and from the\ndescriptions of others, all the plants in Britain, Germany, and near Mentone,\nare in the state just described; and I have never found a single flower with an\naborted pistil. It is, therefore, remarkable that, according to Delpino, this\nplant near Florence is generally trimorphic, consisting of males with aborted\npistils, females with aborted stamens, and hermaphrodites. (7\/15. 'Sull' Opera,\nla Distribuzione dei Sessi nelle Piante, etc' 1867 page 7. With respect to\nGermany H. Muller 'Die Befruchtung etc.' page 327.)\n\nI found it very difficult to judge of the proportional number of the two forms\nat Torquay. They often grow mingled together, but with large patches consisting\nof one form alone. At first I thought that the two were nearly equal in number;\nbut on examining every plant which grew close to the edge of a little\noverhanging dry cliff, about 200 yards in length, I found only 12 females; all\nthe rest, some hundreds in number, being hermaphrodites. Again, on an extensive\ngently sloping bank, which was so thickly covered with this plant that, viewed\nfrom the distance of half a mile it appeared of a pink colour, I could not\ndiscover a single female. Therefore the hermaphrodites must greatly exceed in\nnumber the females, at least in the localities examined by me. A very dry\nstation apparently favours the presence of the female form. With some of the\nother above-named Labiatae the nature of the soil or climate likewise seems to\ndetermine the presence of one or both forms; thus with Nepeta glechoma, Mr. Hart\nfound in 1873 that all the plants which he examined near Kilkenny in Ireland\nwere females; whilst all near Bath were hermaphrodites, and near Hertford both\nforms were present, but with a preponderance of hermaphrodites. (7\/16. 'Nature'\nJune 1873 page 162.) It would, however, be a mistake to suppose that the nature\nof the conditions determines the form independently of inheritance; for I sowed\nin the same small bed seeds of T. serpyllum, gathered at Torquay from the female\nalone, and these produced an abundance of both forms. There is every reason to\nbelieve, from large patches consisting of the same form, that the same\nindividual plant, however much it may spread, always retains the same form. In\ntwo distant gardens I found masses of the lemon-thyme (T. citriodorus, a var. of\nT. serpyllum, which I was informed had grown there during many years, and every\nflower was female.\n\nWith respect to the fertility of the two forms, I marked at Torquay a large\nhermaphrodite and a large female plant of nearly equal sizes, and when the seeds\nwere ripe I gathered all the heads. The two heaps were of very nearly equal\nbulk; but the heads from the female plant numbered 160, and their seeds weighed\n8.7 grains; whilst those from the hermaphrodite plant numbered 200, and their\nseeds weighed only 4.9 grains; so that the seeds from the female plant were to\nthose from the hermaphrodite as 100 to 56 in weight. If the relative weight of\nthe seeds from an equal number of flower-heads from the two forms be compared,\nthe ratio is as 100 for the female to 45 for the hermaphrodite form.\n\nThymus vulgaris.\n\n(FIGURE 7.15. Thymus vulgaris (magnified).\nLeft: Hermaphrodite.\nRight: Two females.)\n\nThe common garden thyme resembles in almost every respect T. serpyllum. The same\nslight differences between the stigmas of the two forms could be perceived. In\nthe females the stamens are not generally quite so much reduced as in the same\nform of T. serpyllum. In some specimens sent me from Mentone by Mr. Moggridge,\ntogether with the sketches in Figure 7.15, the anthers of the female, though\nsmall, were well formed, but they contained very little pollen, and not a single\nsound grain could be detected. Eighteen seedlings were raised from purchased\nseed, sown in the same small bed; and these consisted of seven hermaphrodites\nand eleven females. They were left freely exposed to the visits of bees, and no\ndoubt every female flower was fertilised; for on placing under the microscope a\nlarge number of stigmas from female plants, not one could be found to which\npollen-grains of thyme did not adhere. The seeds were carefully collected from\nthe eleven female plants, and they weighed 98.7 grains; and those from the seven\nhermaphrodites 36.5 grains. This gives for an equal number of plants the ratio\nof 100 to 58; and we here see, as in the last case, how much more fertile the\nfemales are than the hermaphrodites. These two lots of seeds were sown\nseparately in two adjoining beds, and the seedlings from both the hermaphrodite\nand female parent-plants consisted of both forms.\n\nSatureia hortensis.\n\nEleven seedlings were raised in separate pots in a hotbed and afterwards kept in\nthe greenhouse. They consisted of ten females and of a single hermaphrodite.\nWhether or not the conditions to which they had been subjected caused the great\nexcess of females I do not know. In the females the pistil is rather longer than\nthat of the hermaphrodite, and the stamens are mere rudiments, with minute\ncolourless anthers destitute of pollen. The windows of the greenhouse were left\nopen, and the flowers were incessantly visited by humble and hive bees. Although\nthe ten females did not produce a single grain of pollen, yet they were all\nthoroughly well fertilised by the one hermaphrodite plant, and this is an\ninteresting fact. It should be added that no other plant of this species grew in\nmy garden. The seeds were collected from the finest female plant, and they\nweighed 78 grains; whilst those from the hermaphrodite, which was a rather\nlarger plant than the female, weighed only 33.2 grains; that is, in the ratio of\n100 to 43. The female form, therefore, is very much more fertile than the\nhermaphrodite, as in the two last cases; but the hermaphrodite was necessarily\nself-fertilised, and this probably diminished its fertility.\n\nWe may now consider the probable means by which so many of the Labiatae have\nbeen separated into two forms, and the advantages thus gained. H. Muller\nsupposes that originally some individuals varied so as to produce more\nconspicuous flowers; and that insects habitually visited these first, and then\ndusted with their pollen visited and fertilised the less conspicuous flowers.\n(7\/17. 'Die Befruchtung der Blumen' pages 319, 326.) The production of pollen by\nthe latter plants would thus be rendered superfluous, and it would be\nadvantageous to the species that their stamens should abort, so as to save\nuseless expenditure. They would thus be converted into females. But another view\nmay be suggested: as the production of a large supply of seeds evidently is of\nhigh importance to many plants, and as we have seen in the three foregoing cases\nthat the females produce many more seeds than the hermaphrodites, increased\nfertility seems to me the more probable cause of the formation and separation of\nthe two forms. From the data above given it follows that ten plants of Thymus\nserpyllum, if half consisted of hermaphrodites and half of females, would yield\nseeds compared with ten hermaphrodite plants in the ratio of 100 to 72. Under\nsimilar circumstances the ratio with Satureia hortensis (subject to the doubt\nfrom the self-fertilisation of the hermaphrodite) would be as 100 to 60. Whether\nthe two forms originated in certain individuals varying and producing more seed\nthan usual, and consequently producing less pollen; or in the stamens of certain\nindividuals tending from some unknown cause to abort, and consequently producing\nmore seed, it is impossible to decide; but in either case, if the tendency to\nthe increased production of seed were steadily favoured, the result would be the\ncomplete abortion of the male organs. I shall presently discuss the cause of the\nsmaller size of the female corolla.\n\n[Scabiosa arvensis (DIPSACEAE).\n\nIt has been shown by H. Muller that this species exists in Germany under an\nhermaphrodite and female form. (7\/18. 'Die Befruchtung der Blumen' page 368. The\ntwo forms occur not only in Germany, but in England and France. Lecoq\n'Geographie Bot.' 1857 tome 6 pages 473, 477, says that male plants as well as\nhermaphrodites and females coexist; it is, however, possible that he may have\nbeen deceived by the flowers being so strongly proterandrous. From what Lecoq\nsays, S. succisa likewise appears to occur under two forms in France.) In my\nneighbourhood (Kent) the female plants do not nearly equal in number the\nhermaphrodites. The stamens of the females vary much in their degree of\nabortion; in some plants they are quite short and produce no pollen; in others\nthey reach to the mouth of the corolla, but their anthers are not half the\nproper size, never dehisce, and contain but few pollen-grains, these being\ncolourless and of small diameter. The hermaphrodite flowers are strongly\nproterandrous, and H. Muller shows that, whilst all the stigmas on the same\nflower-head are mature at nearly the same time, the stamens dehisce one after\nthe other; so that there is a great excess of pollen, which serves to fertilise\nthe female plants. As the production of pollen by one set of plants is thus\nrendered superfluous, their male organs have become more or less completely\naborted. Should it be hereafter proved that the female plants yield, as is\nprobable, more seeds than the hermaphrodites, I should be inclined to extend the\nsame view to this plant as to the Labiatae. I have also observed the existence\nof two forms in our endemic S. succisa, and in the exotic S. atro-purpurea. In\nthe latter plant, differently to what occurs in S. arvensis, the female flowers,\nespecially the larger circumferential ones, are smaller than those of the\nhermaphrodite form. According to Lecoq, the female flower-heads of S. succisa\nare likewise smaller than those of what he calls the male plants, but which are\nprobably hermaphrodites.\n\nEchium vulgare (BORAGINEAE).\n\nThe ordinary hermaphrodite form appears to be proterandrous, and nothing more\nneed be said about it. The female differs in having a much smaller corolla and\nshorter pistil, but a well-developed stigma. The stamens are short; the anthers\ndo not contain any sound pollen-grains, but in their place yellow incoherent\ncells which do not swell in water. Some plants were in an intermediate\ncondition; that is, had one or two or three stamens of proper length with\nperfect anthers, the other stamens being rudimentary. In one such plant half of\none anther contained green perfect pollen-grains, and the other half yellowish-\ngreen imperfect grains. Both forms produced seed, but I neglected to observe\nwhether in equal numbers. As I thought that the state of the anthers might be\ndue to some fungoid growth, I examined them both in the bud and mature state,\nbut could find no trace of mycelium. In 1862 many female plants were found; and\nin 1864, 32 plants were collected in two localities, exactly half of which were\nhermaphrodites, fourteen were females, and two in an intermediate condition. In\n1866, 15 plants were collected in another locality, and these consisted of four\nhermaphrodites and eleven females. I may add that this season was a wet one,\nwhich shows that the abortion of the stamens can hardly be due to the dryness of\nthe sites where the plants grew, as I at one time thought probable. Seeds from\nan hermaphrodite were sown in my garden, and of the 23 seedlings raised, one\nbelonged to the intermediate form, all the others being hermaphrodites, though\ntwo or three of them had unusually short stamens. I have consulted several\nbotanical works, but have found no record of this plant varying in the manner\nhere described.\n\nPlantago lanceolata (PLANTAGINEAE).\n\nDelpino states that this plant presents in Italy three forms, which graduate\nfrom an anemophilous into an entomophilous condition. According to H. Muller,\nthere are only two forms in Germany, neither of which show any special\nadaptation for insect fertilisation, and both appear to be hermaphrodites.\n(7\/19. 'Die Befruchtung' etc. page 342.) But I have found in two localities in\nEngland female and hermaphrodite forms existing together; and the same fact has\nbeen noticed by others. (7\/20. Mr. C.W. Crocker 'The Gardener's Chronicle' 1864\npage 294. Mr. W. Marshall writes to me to the same effect from Ely.) The females\nare less frequent than the hermaphrodites; their stamens are short, and their\nanthers, which are of a brighter green whilst young than those of the other\nform, dehisce properly, yet contain either no pollen, or a small amount of\nimperfect grains of variable size. All the flower-heads on a plant belong to the\nsame form. It is well known that this species is strongly proterogynous, and I\nfound that the protruding stigmas of both the hermaphrodite and female flowers\nwere penetrated by pollen-tubes, whilst their own anthers were immature and had\nnot escaped out of the bud. Plantago media does not present two forms; but it\nappears from Asa Gray's description, that such is the case with four of the\nNorth American species. (7\/21. 'Manual of the Botany of the Northern United\nStates' 2nd edition 1856 page 269. See also 'American Journal of Science'\nNovember 1862 page 419 and 'Proceedings of the American Academy of Science'\nOctober 14, 1862 page 53.) The corolla does not properly expand in the short-\nstamened form of these plants.\n\nCnicus, Serratula, Eriophorum.\n\nIn the Compositae, Cnicus palustris and acaulis are said by Sir J.E. Smith to\nexist as hermaphrodites and females, the former being the more frequent. With\nSerratula tinctoria a regular gradation may be followed from the hermaphrodite\nto the female form; in one of the latter plants the stamens were so tall that\nthe anthers embraced the style as in the hermaphrodites, but they contained only\na few grains of pollen, and these in an aborted condition; in another female, on\nthe other hand, the anthers were much more reduced in size than is usual.\nLastly, Dr. Dickie has shown that with Eriophorum angustifolium (Cyperaceae)\nhermaphrodite and female forms exist in Scotland and the Arctic regions, both of\nwhich yield seed. (7\/22. Sir J.E. Smith 'Transactions of the Linnean Society'\nvolume 13 page 599. Dr. Dickie 'Journal of the Linnean Society Botany' volume 9\n1865 page 161.)]\n\nIt is a curious fact that in all the foregoing polygamous, dioecious, and gyno-\ndioecious plants in which any difference has been observed in the size of the\ncorolla in the two or three forms, it is rather larger in the females, which\nhave their stamens more or less or quite rudimentary, than in the hermaphrodites\nor males. This holds good with Euonymus, Rhamnus catharticus, Ilex, Fragaria,\nall or at least most of the before-named Labiatae, Scabiosa atro-purpurea, and\nEchium vulgare. So it is, according to Von Mohl, with Cardamine amara, Geranium\nsylvaticum, Myosotis, and Salvia. On the other hand, as Von Mohl remarks, when a\nplant produces hermaphrodite flowers and others which are males owing to the\nmore or less complete abortion of the female organs, the corollas of the males\nare not at all increased in size, or only exceptionally and in a slight degree,\nas in Acer. (7\/23. 'Botanische Zeitung' 1863 page 326.) It seems therefore\nprobable that the decreased size of the female corollas in the foregoing cases\nis due to a tendency to abortion spreading from the stamens to the petals. We\nsee how intimately these organs are related in double flowers, in which the\nstamens are readily converted into petals. Indeed some botanists believe that\npetals do not consist of leaves directly metamorphosed, but of metamorphosed\nstamens. That the lessened size of the corolla in the above case is in some\nmanner an indirect result of the modification of the reproductive organs is\nsupported by the fact that in Rhamnus catharticus not only the petals but the\ngreen and inconspicuous sepals of the female have been reduced in size; and in\nthe strawberry the flowers are largest in the males, mid-sized in the\nhermaphrodites, and smallest in the females. These latter cases,--the\nvariability in the size of the corolla in some of the above species, for\ninstance in the common thyme,--together with the fact that it never differs\ngreatly in size in the two forms--make me doubt much whether natural selection\nhas come into play;--that is whether, in accordance with H. Muller's belief, the\nadvantage derived from the polleniferous flowers being visited first by insects\nhas been sufficient to lead to a gradual reduction of the corolla of the female.\nWe should bear in mind that as the hermaphrodite is the normal form, its corolla\nhas probably retained its original size. (7\/24. It does not appear to me that\nKerner's view 'Die Schutzmittel des Pollens' 1873 page 56, can be accepted in\nthe present cases, namely that the larger corolla in the hermaphrodites and\nmales serves to protect their pollen from rain. In the genus Thymus, for\ninstance, the aborted anthers of the female are much better protected than the\nperfect ones of the hermaphrodite.) An objection to the above view should not be\npassed over; namely, that the abortion of the stamens in the females ought to\nhave added through the law of compensation to the size of the corolla; and this\nperhaps would have occurred, had not the expenditure saved by the abortion of\nthe stamens been directed to the female reproductive organs, so as to give to\nthis form increased fertility.\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII.\nCLEISTOGAMIC FLOWERS.\n\nGeneral character of cleistogamic flowers.\nList of the genera producing such flowers, and their distribution in the\nvegetable series.\nViola, description of the cleistogamic flowers in the several species; their\nfertility compared with that of the perfect flowers.\nOxalis acetosella.\nO. sensitiva, three forms of cleistogamic flowers.\nVandellia.\nOnonis.\nImpatiens.\nDrosera.\nMiscellaneous observations on various other cleistogamic plants.\nAnemophilous species producing cleistogamic flowers.\nLeersia, perfect flowers rarely developed.\nSummary and concluding remarks on the origin of cleistogamic flowers.\nThe chief conclusions which may be drawn from the observations in this volume.\n\nIt was known even before the time of Linnaeus that certain plants produced two\nkinds of flowers, ordinary open, and minute closed ones; and this fact formerly\ngave rise to warm controversies about the sexuality of plants. These closed\nflowers have been appropriately named cleistogamic by Dr. Kuhn. (8\/1.\n'Botanische Zeitung' 1867 page 65.) They are remarkable from their small size\nand from never opening, so that they resemble buds; their petals are rudimentary\nor quite aborted; their stamens are often reduced in number, with the anthers of\nvery small size, containing few pollen-grains, which have remarkably thin\ntransparent coats, and generally emit their tubes whilst still enclosed within\nthe anther-cells; and, lastly, the pistil is much reduced in size, with the\nstigma in some cases hardly at all developed. These flowers do not secrete\nnectar or emit any odour; from their small size, as well as from the corolla\nbeing rudimentary, they are singularly inconspicuous. Consequently insects do\nnot visit them; nor if they did, could they find an entrance. Such flowers are\ntherefore invariably self-fertilised; yet they produce an abundance of seed. In\nseveral cases the young capsules bury themselves beneath the ground, and the\nseeds are there matured. These flowers are developed before, or after, or\nsimultaneously with the perfect ones. Their development seems to be largely\ngoverned by the conditions to which the plants are exposed, for during certain\nseasons or in certain localities only cleistogamic or only perfect flowers are\nproduced.\n\nDr. Kuhn, in the article above referred to, gives a list of 44 genera including\nspecies which bear flowers of this kind. To this list I have added some genera,\nand the authorities are appended in a footnote. I have omitted three names, from\nreasons likewise given in the footnote. But it is by no means easy to decide in\nall cases whether certain flowers ought to be ranked as cleistogamic. For\ninstance, Mr. Bentham informs me that in the South of France some of the flowers\non the vine do not fully open and yet set fruit; and I hear from two experienced\ngardeners that this is the case with the vine in our hothouses; but as the\nflowers do not appear to be completely closed it would be imprudent to consider\nthem as cleistogamic. The flowers of some aquatic and marsh plants, for instance\nof Ranunculus aquatalis, Alisma natans, Subularia, Illecebrum, Menyanthes, and\nEuryale, remain closely shut as long as they are submerged, and in this\ncondition fertilise themselves. (8\/2. Delpino 'Sull' Opera, la Distribuzione dei\nSessi nelle Piante' etc. 1867 page 30. Subularia, however, sometimes has its\nflowers fully expanded beneath the water, see Sir J.E. Smith 'English Flora'\nvolume 3 1825 page 157. For the behaviour of Menyanthes in Russia see Gillibert\nin 'Act. Acad. St. Petersb.' 1777 part 2 page 45.--On Euryale 'Gardener's\nChronicle' 1877 page 280.) They behave in this manner, apparently as a\nprotection to their pollen, and produce open flowers when exposed to the air; so\nthat these cases seem rather different from those of true cleistogamic flowers,\nand have not been included in the list. Again, the flowers of some plants which\nare produced very early or very late in the season do not properly expand; and\nthese might perhaps be considered as incipiently cleistogamic; but as they do\nnot present any of the remarkable peculiarities proper to the class, and as I\nhave not found any full record of such cases, they are not entered in the list.\nWhen, however, it is believed on fairly good evidence that the flowers on a\nplant in its native country do not open at any hour of the day or night, and yet\nset seeds capable of germination, these may fairly be considered as\ncleistogamic, notwithstanding that they present no peculiarities of structure. I\nwill now give as complete a list of the genera containing cleistogamic species\nas I have been able to collect.\n\nTABLE 8.38. List of genera including cleistogamic species (chiefly after Kuhn).\n(8\/3. I have omitted Trifolium and Arachis from the list, because Von Mohl says\n'Botanische Zeitung' 1863 page 312, that the flower-stems merely draw the\nflowers beneath the ground, and that these do not appear to be properly\ncleistogamic. Correa de Mello 'Journal of the Linnean Society Botany' volume 11\n1870 page 254, observed plants of Arachis in Brazil, and could never find such\nflowers. Plantago has been omitted because as far as I can discover it produces\nhermaphrodite and female flower-heads, but not cleistogamic flowers.\nKrascheninikowia (vel Stellaria) has been omitted because it seems very doubtful\nfrom Maximowicz' description whether the lower flowers which have no petals or\nvery small ones, and barren stamens or none, are cleistogamic; the upper\nhermaphrodite flowers are said never to produce fruit, and therefore probably\nact as males. Moreover in Stellaria graminea, as Babington remarks 'British\nBotany' 1851 page 51, \"shorter and longer petals accompany an imperfection of\nthe stamens or germen.\"\n\nI have added to the list the following cases:\nSeveral Acanthaceae, for which see J. Scott in 'Journal of Botany' London new\nseries volume 1 1872 page 161.\nWith respect to salvia see Dr. Ascherson in 'Botanische Zeitung' 1871 page 555.\nFor Oxybaphus and Nyctaginia see Asa Gray in 'American Naturalist' November 1873\npage 692.\nFrom Dr. Torrey's account of Hottonia inflata 'Bulletin of the Torrey Botanical\nClub' volume 2 June 1871, it is manifest that this plant produces true\ncleistogamic flowers.\nFor Pavonia see Bouche in 'Sitzungsberichte d. Gesellsch. Natur. Freunde'\nOctober 20, 1874 page 90.\nI have added Thelymitra, as from the account given by Mr. Fitzgerald in his\nmagnificent work on 'Australian Orchids' it appears that the flowers of this\nplant in its native home never open, but they do not appear to be reduced in\nsize. Nor is this the case with the flowers of certain species of Epidendron,\nCattleya, etc. see second edition of my 'Fertilisation of Orchids' page 147,\nwhich without expanding produce capsules. It is therefore doubtful whether these\nOrchideae ought to have been included in the list. From what Duval-Jouve says\nabout Cryptostachys in 'Bulletin of the Soc. Bot. de France' tome 10 1863 page\n195, this plant appears to produce cleistogamic flowers.\nthe other additions to the list are noticed in my text.)\n\nDICOTYLEDONS.\n\nBORAGINEAE:\nEritrichium.\n\nCONVOLVULACEAE:\nCuscuta.\n\nSCROPHULARINEAE:\nScrophularia.\nLinaria.\nVandellia.\n\nACANTHACEAE:\nCryphiacanthus.\nEranthemum.\nDaedalacanthus.\nDipteracanthus.\nAechmanthera.\nRuellia.\n\nLABIATAE:\nLamium.\nSalvia.\n\nNYCTAGINEAE:\nOxybaphus.\nNyctaginia.\n\nASCLEPIADAE:\nStapelia.\n\nCAMPANULACEAE:\nSpecularia.\nCampanula.\n\nPRIMULACEAE:\nHottonia.\n\nCOMPOSITAE:\nAnandria.\n\nCRUCIFERAE:\nHeterocarpaea.\n\nVIOLACEAE:\nViola.\n\nCISTINEAE:\nHelianthemum.\nLechea.\n\nMALVEACEAE:\nPavonia.\n\nMALPIGHIACEAE:\nGaudichaudia.\nAspicarpa.\nCamarea.\nJanusia.\n\nPOLYGALEAE:\nPolygala.\n\nBALSAMINEAE:\nImpatiens.\n\nGERANIACAEA:\nOxalis.\n\nLEGUMINOSAE:\nOnonis.\nParochaetus.\nChapmannia.\nStylosanthus.\nLespedeza.\nVicia.\nLathyrus.\nMartinsia vel Neurocarpum.\nAmphicarpaea.\nGlycine.\nGalactia.\nVoandzeia.\n\nDROSERACEAE:\nDrosera.\n\nMONOCOTYLEDONS.\n\nJUNCEAE:\nJuncus.\n\nGRAMINEAE:\nLeersia.\nHordeum.\nCryptostachys.\n\nCOMMELINEAE:\nCommelina.\n\nPONTEDERACEAE:\nMonochoria.\n\nORCHIDEAE:\nSchomburgkia.\nCattleya.\nEpidendron.\nThelymitra.\n\nThe first point that strikes us in considering this list of 55 genera, is that\nthey are very widely distributed in the vegetable series. They are more common\nin the family of the Leguminosae than in any other, and next in order in that of\nthe Acanthaceae and Malpighiaceae. A large number, but not all the species, of\ncertain genera, as of Oxalis and Viola, bear cleistogamic as well as ordinary\nflowers. A second point which deserves notice is that a considerable proportion\nof the genera produce more or less irregular flowers; this is the case with\nabout 32 out of the 55 genera, but to this subject I shall recur.\n\nI formerly made many observations on cleistogamic flowers, but only a few of\nthem are worth giving, since the appearance of an admirable paper by Hugo Von\nMohl, whose examination was in some respects much more complete than mine. (8\/4.\n'Botanische Zeitung' 1863 page 309-28.) His paper includes also an interesting\nhistory of our knowledge on the subject.\n\nViola canina.\n\nThe calyx of the cleistogamic flowers differs in no respect from that of the\nperfect ones. The petals are reduced to five minute scales; the lower one, which\nrepresents the lower lip, is considerably larger than the others, but with no\ntrace of the spur-like nectary; its margins are smooth, whilst those of the\nother four scale-like petals are papillose. D. Muller of Upsala says that in the\nspecimens which he observed the petals were completely aborted. (8\/5. Ibid. 1857\npage 730. This paper contains the first full and satisfactory account of any\ncleistogamic flower.) The stamens are very small, and only the two lower ones\nare provided with anthers, which do not cohere together as in the perfect\nflowers. The anthers are minute, with the two cells or loculi remarkably\ndistinct; they contain very little pollen in comparison with those of the\nperfect flowers. The connective expands into a membranous hood-like shield which\nprojects above the anther-cells. These two lower stamens have no vestige of the\ncurious appendages which secrete nectar in the perfect flowers. The three other\nstamens are destitute of anthers and have broader filaments, with their terminal\nmembranous expansions flatter or not so hood-like as those of the two\nantheriferous stamens. The pollen-grains have remarkably thin transparent coats;\nwhen exposed to the air they shrivel up quickly; when placed in water they\nswell, and are then 8-10\/7000 of an inch in diameter, and therefore of smaller\nsize than the ordinary pollen-grains similarly treated, which have a diameter of\n13-14\/7000 of an inch. In the cleistogamic flowers, the pollen-grains, as far as\nI could see, never naturally fall out of the anther-cells, but emit their tubes\nthrough a pore at the upper end. I was able to trace the tubes from the grains\nsome way down the stigma. The pistil is very short, with the style hooked, so\nthat its extremity, which is a little enlarged or funnel-shaped and represents\nthe stigma, is directed downwards, being covered by the two membranous\nexpansions of the antheriferous stamens. It is remarkable that there is an open\npassage from the enlarged funnel-shaped extremity to within the ovarium; this\nwas evident, as slight pressure caused a bubble of air, which had been drawn in\nby some accident, to travel freely from one end to the other: a similar passage\nwas observed by Michalet in V. alba. The pistil therefore differs considerably\nfrom that of the perfect flower; for in the latter it is much longer, and\nstraight with the exception of the rectangularly bent stigma; nor is it\nperforated by an open passage.\n\nThe ordinary or perfect flowers have been said by some authors never to produce\ncapsules; but this is an error, though only a small proportion of them do so.\nThis appears to depend in some cases on their anthers not containing even a\ntrace of pollen, but more generally on bees not visiting the flowers. I twice\ncovered with a net a group of flowers, and marked with threads twelve of them\nwhich had not as yet expanded. This precaution is necessary, for though as a\ngeneral rule the perfect flowers appear considerably before the cleistogamic\nones, yet occasionally some of the latter are produced early in the season, and\ntheir capsules might readily be mistaken for those produced by the perfect\nflowers. Not one of the twelve marked perfect flowers yielded a capsule, whilst\nothers under the net which had been artificially fertilised produced five\ncapsules; and these contained exactly the same average number of seeds as some\ncapsules from flowers outside the net which had been fertilised by bees. I have\nrepeatedly seen Bombus hortorum, lapidarius, and a third species, as well as\nhive-bees, sucking the flowers of this violet: I marked six which were thus\nvisited, and four of them produced fine capsules; the two others were gnawed off\nby some animal. I watched Bombus hortorum for some time, and whenever it came to\na flower which did not stand in a convenient position to be sucked, it bit a\nhole through the spur-like nectary. Such ill-placed flowers would not yield any\nseed or leave descendants; and the plants bearing them would thus tend to be\neliminated through natural selection.\n\nThe seeds produced by the cleistogamic and perfect flowers do not differ in\nappearance or number. On two occasions I fertilised several perfect flowers with\npollen from other individuals, and afterwards marked some cleistogamic flowers\non the same plants; and the result was that 14 capsules produced by the perfect\nflowers contained on an average 9.85 seeds; and 17 capsules from the\ncleistogamic ones contained 9.64 seeds,--an amount of difference of no\nsignificance. It is remarkable how much more quickly the capsules from the\ncleistogamic flowers are developed than those from the perfect ones; for\ninstance, several perfect flowers were cross-fertilised on April 14th, 1863, and\na month afterwards (May 15th) eight young cleistogamic flowers were marked with\nthreads; and when the two sets of capsules thus produced were compared on June\n3rd, there was scarcely any difference between them in size.\n\nViola odorata (WHITE-FLOWERED, SINGLE, CULTIVATED VARIETY).\n\nThe petals are represented by mere scales as in the last species; but\ndifferently from in the last, all five stamens are provided with diminutive\nanthers. Small bundles of pollen-tubes were traced from the five anthers into\nthe somewhat distant stigma. The capsules produced by these flowers bury\nthemselves in the soil, if it be loose enough, and there mature themselves.\n(8\/6. Vaucher says 'Hist. Phys. des Plantes d'Europe' tome 3 1844 page 309, that\nV. hirta and collina likewise bury their capsules. See also Lecoq 'Geograph.\nBot.' tome 5 1856 page 180.) Lecoq says that it is only these latter capsules\nwhich possess elastic valves; but I think this must be a misprint, as such\nvalves would obviously be of no use to the buried capsules, but would serve to\nscatter the seeds of the sub-aerial ones, as in the other species of Viola. It\nis remarkable that this plant, according to Delpino, does not produce\ncleistogamic flowers in one part of Liguria, whilst the perfect flowers are\nthere abundantly fertile (8\/7. 'Sull' Opera, la Distribuzione dei Sessi nelle\nPiante' etc. 1867 page 30.); on the other hand, cleistogamic flowers are\nproduced by it near Turin. Another fact is worth giving as an instance of\ncorrelated development: I found on a purple variety, after it had produced its\nperfect double flowers, and whilst the white single variety was bearing its\ncleistogamic flowers, many bud-like bodies which from their position on the\nplant were certainly of a cleistogamic nature. They consisted, as could be seen\non bisecting them, of a dense mass of minute scales closely folded over one\nanother, exactly like a cabbage-head in miniature. I could not detect any\nstamens, and in the place of the ovarium there was a little central column. The\ndoubleness of the perfect flowers had thus spread to the cleistogamic ones,\nwhich therefore were rendered quite sterile.\n\nViola hirta.\n\nThe five stamens of the cleistogamic flowers are provided, as in the last case,\nwith small anthers, from all of which pollen-tubes proceed to the stigma. The\npetals are not quite so much reduced as in V. canina, and the short pistil\ninstead of being hooked is merely bent into a rectangle. Of several perfect\nflowers which I saw visited by hive-and humble-bees, six were marked, but they\nproduced only two capsules, some of the others having been accidentally injured.\nM. Monnier was therefore mistaken in this case as in that of V. odorata, in\nsupposing that the perfect flowers always withered away and aborted. He states\nthat the peduncles of the cleistogamic flowers curve downwards and bury the\novaries beneath the soil. (8\/8. These statements are taken from Professor\nOliver's excellent article in the 'Natural History Review' July 1862 page 238.\nWith respect to the supposed sterility of the perfect flowers in this genus see\nalso Timbal-Lagrave 'Botanische Zeitung' 1854 page 772.) I may here add that\nFritz Muller, as I hear from his brother, has found in the highlands of Southern\nBrazil a white-flowered species of violet which bears subterranean cleistogamic\nflowers.\n\nViola nana.\n\nMr. Scott sent me seeds of this Indian species from the Sikkim Terai, from which\nI raised many plants, and from these other seedlings during several successive\ngenerations. They produced an abundance of cleistogamic flowers during the whole\nof each summer, but never a perfect one. When Mr. Scott wrote to me his plants\nin Calcutta were behaving similarly, though his collector saw the species in\nflower in its native site. This case is valuable as showing that we ought not to\ninfer, as has sometimes been done, that a species does not bear perfect flowers\nwhen growing naturally, because it produces only cleistogamic flowers under\nculture. The calyx of these flowers is sometimes formed of only three sepals;\ntwo being actually suppressed and not merely coherent with the others; this\noccurred with five out of thirty flowers which were examined for this purpose.\nThe petals are represented by extremely minute scales. Of the stamens, two bear\nanthers which are in the same state as in the previous species, but, as far as I\ncould judge, each of the two cells contained only from 20 to 25 delicate\ntransparent pollen-grains. These emitted their tubes in the usual manner. The\nthree other stamens bore very minute rudimentary anthers, one of which was\ngenerally larger than the other two, but none of them contained any pollen. In\none instance, however, a single cell of the larger rudimentary anther included a\nlittle pollen. The style consists of a short flattened tube, somewhat expanded\nat its upper end, and this forms an open channel leading into the ovarium, as\ndescribed under V. canina. It is slightly bent towards the two fertile anthers.\n\nViola Roxburghiana.\n\nThis species bore in my hothouse during two years a multitude of cleistogamic\nflowers, which resembled in all respects those of the last species; but no\nperfect ones were produced. Mr. Scott informs me that in India it bears perfect\nflowers only during the cold season, and that these are quite fertile. During\nthe hot, and more especially during the rainy season, it bears an abundance of\ncleistogamic flowers.\n\nMany other species, besides the five now described, produce cleistogamic\nflowers; this is the case, according to D. Muller, Michalet, Von Mohl, and\nHermann Muller, with V. elatior, lancifolia, sylvatica, palustris, mirabilis,\nbicolor, ionodium, and biflora. But V. tricolor does not produce them.\n\nMichalet asserts that V. palustris produces near Paris only perfect flowers,\nwhich are quite fertile; but that when the plant grows on mountains cleistogamic\nflowers are produced; and so it is with V. biflora. The same author states that\nhe has seen in the case of V. alba flowers intermediate in structure between the\nperfect and cleistogamic ones. According to M. Boisduval, an Italian species, V.\nRuppii, never bears in France \"des fleurs bien apparentes, ce qui ne l'empeche\npas de fructifier.\"\n\nIt is interesting to observe the gradation in the abortion of the parts in the\ncleistogamic flowers of the several foregoing species. It appears from the\nstatements by D. Muller and Von Mohl that in V. mirabilis the calyx does not\nremain quite closed; all five stamens are provided with anthers, and some\npollen-grains probably fall out of the cells on the stigma, instead of\nprotruding their tubes whilst still enclosed, as in the other species. In V.\nhirta all five stamens are likewise antheriferous; the petals are not so much\nreduced and the pistil not so much modified as in the following species. In V.\nnana and elatior only two of the stamens properly bear anthers, but sometimes\none or even two of the others are thus provided. Lastly, in V. canina never more\nthan two of the stamens, as far as I have seen, bear anthers; the petals are\nmuch more reduced than in V. hirta, and according to D. Muller are sometimes\nquite absent.\n\nOxalis acetosella.\n\nThe existence of cleistogamic flowers on this plant was discovered by Michalet.\n(8\/9. 'Bulletin Soc. Bot. de France' tome 7 1860 page 465.) They have been fully\ndescribed by Von Mohl, and I can add hardly anything to his description. In my\nspecimens the anthers of the five longer stamens were nearly on a level with the\nstigmas; whilst the smaller and less plainly bilobed anthers of the five shorter\nstamens stood considerably below the stigmas, so that their tubes had to travel\nsome way upwards. According to Michalet these latter anthers are sometimes quite\naborted. In one case the tubes, which ended in excessively fine points, were\nseen by me stretching upwards from the lower anthers towards the stigmas, which\nthey had not as yet reached. My plants grew in pots, and long after the perfect\nflowers had withered they produced not only cleistogamic but a few minute open\nflowers, which were in an intermediate condition between the two kinds. In one\nof these the pollen-tubes from the lower anthers had reached the stigmas, though\nthe flower was open. The footstalks of the cleistogamic flowers are much shorter\nthan those of the perfect flowers, and are so much bowed downwards that they\ntend, according to Von Mohl, to bury themselves in the moss and dead leaves on\nthe ground. Michalet also says that they are often hypogean. In order to\nascertain the number of seeds produced by these flowers, I marked eight of them;\ntwo failed, one cast its seed abroad, and the remaining five contained on an\naverage 10.0 seeds per capsule. This is rather above the average 9.2, which\neleven capsules from perfect flowers fertilised with their own pollen yielded,\nand considerably above the average 7.9, from the capsules of perfect flowers\nfertilised with pollen from another plant; but this latter result must, I think,\nhave been accidental.\n\nHildebrand, whilst searching various Herbaria, observed that many other species\nof Oxalis besides O. acetosella produce cleistogamic flowers (8\/10.\n'Monatsbericht der Akad. der Wiss. zu Berlin' 1866 page 369.); and I hear from\nhim that this is the case with the heterostyled trimorphic O. incarnata from the\nCape of Good Hope.\n\nOxalis (Biophytum) sensitiva.\n\nThis plant is ranked by many botanists as a distinct genus, but as a sub-genus\nby Bentham and Hooker. Many of the early flowers on a mid-styled plant in my\nhothouse did not open properly, and were in an intermediate condition between\ncleistogamic and perfect. Their petals varied from a rudiment to about half\ntheir proper size; nevertheless they produced capsules. I attributed their state\nto unfavourable conditions, for later in the season fully expanded flowers of\nthe proper size appeared. But Mr. Thwaites afterwards sent me from Ceylon a\nnumber of long-styled, mid-styled, and short-styled flower-stalks preserved in\nspirits; and on the same stalks with the perfect flowers, some of which were\nfully expanded and others still in bud, there were small bud-like bodies\ncontaining mature pollen, but with their calyces closed. These cleistogamic\nflowers do not differ much in structure from the perfect ones of the\ncorresponding form, with the exception that their petals are reduced to\nextremely minute, barely visible scales, which adhere firmly to the rounded\nbases of the shorter stamens. Their stigmas are much less papillose, and smaller\nin about the ratio of 13 to 20 divisions of the micrometer, as measured\ntransversely from apex to apex, than the stigmas of the perfect flowers. The\nstyles are furrowed longitudinally, and are clothed with simple as well as\nglandular hairs, but only in the cleistogamic flowers produced by the long-\nstyled and mid-styled forms. The anthers of the longer stamens are a little\nsmaller than the corresponding ones of the perfect flowers, in about the ratio\nof 11 to 14. They dehisce properly, but do not appear to contain much pollen.\nMany pollen-grains were attached by short tubes to the stigmas; but many others,\nstill adhering to the anthers, had emitted their tubes to a considerable length,\nwithout having come in contact with the stigmas. Living plants ought to be\nexamined, as the stigmas, at least of the long-styled form, project beyond the\ncalyx, and if visited by insects (which, however, is very improbable) might be\nfertilised with pollen from a perfect flower. The most singular fact about the\npresent species is that long-styled cleistogamic flowers are produced by the\nlong-styled plants, and mid-styled as well as short-styled cleistogamic flowers\nby the other two forms; so that there are three kinds of cleistogamic and three\nkinds of perfect flowers produced by this one species! Most of the heterostyled\nspecies of Oxalis are more or less sterile, many absolutely so, if\nillegitimately fertilised with their own-form pollen. It is therefore probable\nthat the pollen of the cleistogamic flowers has been modified in power, so as to\nact on their own stigmas, for they yield an abundance of seeds. We may perhaps\naccount for the cleistogamic flowers consisting of the three forms, through the\nprinciple of correlated growth, by which the cleistogamic flowers of the double\nviolet have been rendered double.\n\nVandellia nummularifolia.\n\nDr. Kuhn has collected all the notices with respect to cleistogamic flowers in\nthis genus, and has described from dried specimens those produced by an\nAbyssinian species. (8\/11. 'Botanische Zeitung' 1867 page 65.) Mr. Scott sent me\nfrom Calcutta seeds of the above common Indian weed, from which many plants were\nsuccessively raised during several years. The cleistogamic flowers are very\nsmall, being when fully mature under 1\/20 of an inch (1.27 millimetres) in\nlength. The calyx does not open, and within it the delicate transparent corolla\nremains closely folded over the ovarium. There are only two anthers instead of\nthe normal number of four, and their filaments adhere to the corolla. The cells\nof the anthers diverge much at their lower ends and are only 5\/700 of an inch\n(.181 millimetres) in their longer diameter. They contain but few pollen-grains,\nand these emit their tubes whilst still within the anther. The pistil is very\nshort, and is surmounted by a bilobed stigma. As the ovary grows the two anthers\ntogether with the shrivelled corolla, all attached by the dried pollen-tubes to\nthe stigma, are torn off and carried upwards in the shape of a little cap. The\nperfect flowers generally appear before the cleistogamic, but sometimes\nsimultaneously with them. During one season a large number of plants produced no\nperfect flowers. It has been asserted that the latter never yield capsules; but\nthis is a mistake, as they do so even when insects are excluded. Fifteen\ncapsules from cleistogamic flowers on plants growing under favourable conditions\ncontained on an average 64.2 seeds, with a maximum of 87; whilst 20 capsules\nfrom plants growing much crowded yielded an average of only 48. Sixteen capsules\nfrom perfect flowers artificially crossed with pollen from another plant\ncontained on an average 93 seeds, with a maximum of 137. Thirteen capsules from\nself-fertilised perfect flowers gave an average of 62 seeds, with a maximum of\n135. Therefore the capsules from the cleistogamic flowers contained fewer seeds\nthan those from perfect flowers when cross-fertilised, and slightly more than\nthose from perfect flowers self-fertilised.\n\nDr. Kuhn believes that the Abyssinian V. sessiflora does not differ specifically\nfrom the foregoing species. But its cleistogamic flowers apparently include four\nanthers instead of two as above described. The plants, moreover, of V.\nsessiflora produce subterranean runners which yield capsules; and I never saw a\ntrace of such runners in V. nummularifolia, although many plants were\ncultivated.\n\nLinaria spuria.\n\nMichalet says that short, thin, twisted branches are developed from the buds in\nthe axils of the lower leaves, and that these bury themselves in the ground.\n(8\/12. 'Bulletin Soc. Bot. de France' tome 7 1860 page 468.) They there produce\nflowers not offering any peculiarity in structure, excepting that their\ncorollas, though properly coloured, are deformed. These flowers may be ranked as\ncleistogamic, as they are developed, and not merely drawn, beneath the ground.\n\nOnonis columnae.\n\nPlants were raised from seeds sent me from Northern Italy. The sepals of the\ncleistogamic flowers are elongated and closely pressed together; the petals are\nmuch reduced in size, colourless, and folded over the interior organs. The\nfilaments of the ten stamens are united into a tube, and this is not the case,\naccording to Von Mohl, with the cleistogamic flowers of other Leguminosae. Five\nof the stamens are destitute of anthers, and alternate with the five thus\nprovided. The two cells of the anthers are minute, rounded and separated from\none another by connective tissue; they contain but few pollen-grains, and these\nhave extremely delicate coats. The pistil is hook-shaped, with a plainly\nenlarged stigma, which is curled down, towards the anthers; it therefore differs\nmuch from that of the perfect flower. During the year 1867 no perfect flowers\nwere produced, but in the following year there were both perfect and\ncleistogamic ones.\n\nOnonis minutissima.\n\nMy plants produced both perfect and cleistogamic flowers; but I did not examine\nthe latter. Some of the former were crossed with pollen from a distinct plant,\nand six capsules thus obtained yielded on an average 3.66 seeds, with a maximum\nof 5 in one. Twelve perfect flowers were marked and allowed to fertilise\nthemselves spontaneously under a net, and they yielded eight capsules,\ncontaining on an average 2.38 seeds, with a maximum of 3 in one. Fifty-three\ncapsules produced by the cleistogamic flowers contained on an average 4.1 seeds,\nso that these were the most productive of all; and the seeds themselves looked\nfiner even than those from the crossed perfect flowers. According to Mr. Bentham\nO. parviflora likewise bears cleistogamic flowers; and he informs me that these\nflowers are produced by all three species early in the spring; whilst the\nperfect ones appear afterwards, and therefore in a reversed order compared with\nthose of Viola and Oxalis. Some of the species, for instance Ononis columnae,\nbear a fresh crop of cleistogamic flowers in the autumn.\n\nLathyrus nissolia.\n\nThis plant apparently offers a case of the first stage in the production of\ncleistogamic flowers, for on plants growing in a state of nature, many of the\nflowers never expand and yet produce fine pods. Some of the buds are so large\nthat they seem on the point of expansion; others are much smaller, but none so\nsmall as the true cleistogamic flowers of the foregoing species. As I marked\nthese buds with thread and examined them daily, there could be no mistake about\ntheir producing fruit without having expanded.\n\nSeveral other Leguminous genera produce cleistogamic flowers, as may be seen in\nTable 8.38; but much does not appear to be known about them. Von Mohl says that\ntheir petals are commonly rudimentary, that only a few of their anthers are\ndeveloped, their filaments are not united into a tube and their pistils are\nhook-shaped. In three of the genera, namely Vicia, Amphicarpaea, and Voandzeia,\nthe cleistogamic flowers are produced on subterranean stems. The perfect flowers\nof Voandzeia, which is a cultivated plant, are said never to produce fruit\n(8\/13. Correa de Mello 'Journal of the Linnean Society Botany' volume 11 1870\npage 254, particularly attended to the flowering and fruiting of this African\nplant, which is sometimes cultivated in Brazil.); but we should remember how\noften fertility is affected by cultivation.\n\nImpatiens fulva.\n\nMr. A.W. Bennett has published an excellent description, with figures, of this\nplant. (8\/14. 'Journal of the Linnean Society Botany' volume 13 1872 page 147.)\nHe shows that the cleistogamic and perfect flowers differ in structure at a very\nearly period of growth, so that the existence of the former cannot be due merely\nto the arrested development of the latter,--a conclusion which indeed follows\nfrom most of the previous descriptions. Mr. Bennett found on the banks of the\nWey that the plants which bore cleistogamic flowers alone were to those bearing\nperfect flowers as 20 to 1; but we should remember that this is a naturalised\nspecies. The perfect flowers are usually barren in England; but Professor Asa\nGray writes to me that after midsummer in the United States some or many of them\nproduce capsules.\n\nImpatiens noli-me-tangere.\n\nI can add nothing of importance to Von Mohl's description, excepting that one of\nthe rudimentary petals shows a vestige of a nectary, as Mr. Bennett likewise\nfound to be the case with I. fulva. As in this latter species all five stamens\nproduce some pollen, though small in amount; a single anther contains, according\nto Von Mohl, not more than 50 grains, and these emit their tubes while still\nenclosed within it. The pollen-grains of the perfect flowers are tied together\nby threads, but not, so far as I could see, those of the cleistogamic flowers;\nand a provision of this kind would here have been useless, as the grains can\nnever be transported by insects. The flowers of I. balsamina are visited by\nhumble-bees (8\/15. H. Muller 'Die Befruchtung' etc. page 170.), and I am almost\nsure that this is the case with the perfect flowers of I. noli-me-tangere. From\nthe perfect flowers of this latter species covered with a net eleven\nspontaneously self-fertilised capsules were produced, and these yielded on an\naverage 3.45 seeds. Some perfect flowers with their anthers still containing an\nabundance of pollen were fertilised with pollen from a distinct plant; and the\nthree capsules thus produced contained, to my surprise, only 2, 2, and 1 seed.\nAs I. balsamina is proterandrous, so probably is the present species; and if so,\ncross-fertilisation was effected by me at too early a period, and this may\naccount for the capsules yielding so few seeds.\n\nDrosera rotundifolia.\n\nThe first flower-stems which were thrown up by some plants in my greenhouse bore\nonly cleistogamic flowers. The petals of small size remained permanently closed\nover the reproductive organs, but their white tips could just be seen between\nthe almost completely closed sepals. The pollen, which was scanty in amount, but\nnot so scanty as in Viola or Oxalis, remained enclosed within the anthers,\nwhence the tubes proceeded and penetrated the stigma. As the ovarium swelled the\nlittle withered corolla was carried upwards in the form of a cap. These\ncleistogamic flowers produced an abundance of seed. Later in the season perfect\nflowers appeared. With plants in a state of nature the flowers open only in the\nearly morning, as I have been informed by Mr. Wallis, who particularly attended\nto the time of their flowering. In the case of D. Anglica, the still folded\npetals on some plants in my greenhouse opened just sufficiently to leave a\nminute aperture; the anthers dehisced properly, but the pollen-grains adhered in\na mass to them, and thence emitted their tubes, which penetrated the stigmas.\nThese flowers, therefore, were in an intermediate condition, and could not be\ncalled either perfect or cleistogamic.\n\nA few miscellaneous observations may be added with respect to some other\nspecies, as throwing light on our subject. Mr. Scott states that Eranthemum\nambiguum bears three kinds of flowers,--large, conspicuous, open ones, which are\nquite sterile,--others of intermediate size, which are open and moderately\nfertile--and lastly small closed or cleistogamic ones, which are perfectly\nfertile. (8\/16. 'Journal of Botany' London new series volume 1 1872 pages 161-\n4.) Ruellia tuberosa, likewise one of the Acanthaceae, produces both open and\ncleistogamic flowers; the latter yield from 18 to 24, whilst the former only\nfrom 8 to 10 seeds; these two kinds of flowers are produced simultaneously,\nwhereas in several other members of the family the cleistogamic ones appear only\nduring the hot season. According to Torrey and Gray, the North American species\nof Helianthemum, when growing in poor soil, produce only cleistogamic flowers.\nThe cleistogamic flowers of Specularia perfoliata are highly remarkable, as they\nare closed by a tympanum formed by the rudimentary corolla, and without any\ntrace of an opening. The stamens vary from 3 to 5 in number, as do the sepals.\n(8\/17. Von Mohl 'Botanische Zeitung' 1863 pages 314 and 323. Dr. Bromfield\n'Phytologist' volume 3 page 530, also remarks that the calyx of the cleistogamic\nflowers is usually only 3-cleft, while that of the perfect flower is mostly 5-\ncleft.) The collecting hairs on the pistil, which play so important a part in\nthe fertilisation of the perfect flowers, are here quite absent. Drs. Hooker and\nThomson state that some of the Indian species of Campanula produce two kinds of\nflowers; the smaller ones being borne on longer peduncles with differently\nformed sepals, and producing a more globose ovary. (8\/18. 'Journal of the\nLinnean Society' volume 2 1857 page 7. See also Professor Oliver in 'Natural\nHistory Review' 1862 page 240.) The flowers are closed by a tympanum like that\nin Specularia. Some of the plants produce both kinds of flowers, others only one\nkind; both yield an abundance of seeds. Professor Oliver adds that he has seen\nflowers on Campanula colorata in an intermediate condition between cleistogamic\nand perfect ones.\n\nThe solitary almost sessile cleistogamic flowers produced by Monochoria\nvaginalis are differently protected from those in any of the previous cases,\nnamely, within \"a short sack formed of the membranous spathe, without any\nopening or fissure.\" There is only a single fertile stamen; the style is almost\nobsolete, with the three stigmatic surfaces directed to one side. Both the\nperfect and cleistogamic flowers produce seeds. (8\/19. Dr. Kirk 'Journal of the\nLinnean Society' volume 8 1864 page 147.)\n\nThe cleistogamic flowers on some of the Malpighiaceae seem to be more profoundly\nmodified than those in any of the foregoing genera. According to A. de Jussieu\nthey are differently situated from the perfect flowers; they contain only a\nsingle stamen, instead of 5 or 6; and it is a strange fact that this particular\nstamen is not developed in the perfect flowers of the same species. (8\/20.\n'Archives du Museum' tome 3 1843 pages 35-38, 82-86, 589, 598.) The style is\nabsent or rudimentary; and there are only two ovaries instead of three. Thus\nthese degraded flowers, as Jussieu remarks, \"laugh at our classifications, for\nthe greater number of the characters proper to the species, to the genus, to the\nfamily, to the class disappear.\" I may add that their calyces are not glandular,\nand as, according to Kerner, the fluid secreted by such glands generally serves\nto protect the flowers from crawling insects, which steal the nectar without\naiding in their cross-fertilisation (8\/21. 'Die Schutzmittel der Bluthen gegen\nunberufene Gaste' 1876 page 25.), the deficiency of the glands in the\ncleistogamic flowers of these plants may perhaps be accounted for by their not\nrequiring any such protection.\n\nAs the Asclepiadous genus Stapelia is said to produce cleistogamic flowers, the\nfollowing case may be worth giving. I have never heard of the perfect flowers of\nHoya carnosa setting seeds in this country, but some capsules were produced in\nMr. Farrer's hothouse; and the gardener detected that they were the product of\nminute bud-like bodies, three or four of which could sometimes be found on the\nsame umbel with the perfect flowers. They were quite closed and hardly thicker\nthan their peduncles. The sepals presented nothing particular, but internally\nand alternating with them, there were five small flattened heart-shaped\npapillae, like rudiments of petals; but the homological nature of which appeared\ndoubtful to Mr. Bentham and Dr. Hooker. No trace of anthers or of stamens could\nbe detected; and I knew from having examined many cleistogamic flowers what to\nlook for. There were two ovaries, full of ovules, quite open at their upper\nends, with their edges festooned, but with no trace of a proper stigma. In all\nthese flowers one of the two ovaries withered and blackened long before the\nother. The one perfect capsule, 3 1\/2 inches in length, which was sent me, had\nlikewise been developed from a single carpel. This capsule contained an\nabundance of plumose seeds, many of which appeared quite sound, but they did not\ngerminate when sown at Kew. Therefore the little bud-like flower which produced\nthis capsule probably was as destitute of pollen as were those which I examined.\n\nJuncus bufonius and Hordeum.\n\nAll the species hitherto mentioned which produce cleistogamic flowers are\nentomophilous; but four genera, Juncus, Hordeum, Cryptostachys, and Leersia are\nanemophilous. Juncus bufonius is remarkable by bearing in parts of Russia only\ncleistogamic flowers, which contain three instead of the six anthers found in\nthe perfect flowers. (8\/22. See Dr. Ascherson's interesting paper in 'Botanische\nZeitung' 1871 page 551.) In the genus Hordeum it has been shown by Delpino that\nthe majority of the flowers are cleistogamic, some of the others expanding and\napparently allowing of cross-fertilisation. (8\/23. 'Bollettini del Comizio\nagrario Parmense.' Marzo e Aprile 1871. An abstract of this valuable paper is\ngiven in 'Botanische Zeitung' 1871 page 537. See also Hildebrand on Hordeum in\n'Monatsbericht d. K. Akad Berlin' October 1872 page 760.) I hear from Fritz\nMuller that there is a grass in Southern Brazil, in which the sheath of the\nuppermost leaf, half a metre in length, envelopes the whole panicle; and this\nsheath never opens until the self-fertilised seeds are ripe. On the roadside\nsome plants had been cut down, whilst the cleistogamic panicles were developing,\nand these plants afterwards produced free or unenclosed panicles of small size,\nbearing perfect flowers.\n\nLeersia oryzoides.\n\nIt has long been known that this plant produces cleistogamic flowers, but these\nwere first described with care by M. Duval-Jouve. (8\/24. 'Bulletin Bot. Soc. de\nFrance' tome 10 1863 page 194.) I procured plants from a stream near Reigate,\nand cultivated them for several years in my greenhouse. The cleistogamic flowers\nare very small, and usually mature their seeds within the sheaths of the leaves.\nThese flowers are said by Duval-Jouve to be filled by slightly viscid fluid; but\nthis was not the case with several that I opened; but there was a thin film of\nfluid between the coats of the glumes, and when these were pressed the fluid\nmoved about, giving a similarly deceptive appearance of the whole inside of the\nflower being thus filled. The stigma is very small and the filaments extremely\nshort; the anthers are less than 1\/50 of an inch in length or about one-third of\nthe length of those in the perfect flowers. One of the three anthers dehisces\nbefore the two others. Can this have any relation with the fact that in some\nother species of Leersia only two stamens are fully developed? (8\/25. Asa Gray\n'Manual of Botany of the United States' 1856 page 540.) The anthers shed their\npollen on the stigma; at least in one instance this was clearly the case, and by\ntearing open the anthers under water the grains were easily detached. Towards\nthe apex of the anther the grains are arranged in a single row and lower down in\ntwo or three rows, so that they could be counted; and there were about 35 in\neach cell, or 70 in the whole anther; and this is an astonishingly small number\nfor an anemophilous plant. The grains have very delicate coats, are spherical\nand about 5\/7000 of an inch (.0181 millimetres), whilst those of the perfect\nflowers are about 7\/7000 of an inch (.0254 millimetres) in diameter.\n\nM. Duval-Jouve states that the panicles very rarely protrude from their sheaths,\nbut that when this does happen the flowers expand and exhibit well-developed\novaries and stigmas, together with full-sized anthers containing apparently\nsound pollen; nevertheless such flowers are invariably quite sterile. Schreiber\nhad previously observed that if a panicle is only half protruded, this half is\nsterile, whilst the still included half is fertile. Some plants which grew in a\nlarge tub of water in my greenhouse behaved on one occasion in a very different\nmanner. They protruded two very large much-branched panicles; but the florets\nnever opened, though these included fully developed stigmas, and stamens\nsupported on long filaments with large anthers that dehisced properly. If these\nflorets had opened for a short time unperceived by me and had then closed again,\nthe empty anthers would have been left dangling outside. Nevertheless they\nyielded on August 17th an abundance of fine ripe seeds. Here then we have a near\napproach to the single case as yet known of this grass producing in a state of\nnature (in Germany) perfect flowers which yielded a copious supply of fruit.\n(8\/26. Dr. Ascherson 'Botanische Zeitung' 1864 page 350.) Seeds from the\ncleistogamic flowers were sent by me to Mr. Scott in Calcutta, who there\ncultivated the plants in various ways, but they never produced perfect flowers.\n\nIn Europe Leersia oryzoides is the sole representative of its genus, and Duval-\nJouve, after examining several exotic species, found that it apparently is the\nsole one which bears cleistogamic flowers. It ranges from Persia to North\nAmerica, and specimens from Pennsylvania resembled the European ones in their\nconcealed manner of fructification. There can therefore be little doubt that\nthis plant generally propagates itself throughout an immense area by\ncleistogamic seeds, and that it can hardly ever be invigorated by cross-\nfertilisation. It resembles in this respect those plants which are now widely\nspread, though they increase solely by asexual generation. (8\/27. I have\ncollected several such cases in my 'Variation under Domestication' chapter 18\n2nd edition volume 2 page 153.)\n\nCONCLUDING REMARKS ON CLEISTOGAMIC FLOWERS.\n\nThat these flowers owe their structure primarily to the arrested development of\nperfect ones, we may infer from such cases as that of the lower rudimentary\npetal in Viola being larger than the others, like the lower lip of the perfect\nflower,--from a vestige of a spur in the cleistogamic flowers of Impatiens,--\nfrom the ten stamens of Ononis being united into a tube,--and other such\nstructures. The same inference may be drawn from the occurrence, in some\ninstances, on the same plant of a series of gradations between the cleistogamic\nand perfect flowers. But that the former owe their origin wholly to arrested\ndevelopment is by no means the case; for various parts have been specially\nmodified, so as to aid in the self-fertilisation of the flowers, and as a\nprotection to the pollen; for instance, the hook-shaped pistil in Viola and in\nsome other genera, by which the stigma is brought close to the fertile anthers,-\n-the rudimentary corolla of Specularia modified into a perfectly closed\ntympanum, and the sheath of Monochoria modified into a closed sack,--the\nexcessively thin coats of the pollen-grains,--the anthers not being all equally\naborted, and other such cases. Moreover Mr. Bennett has shown that the buds of\nthe cleistogamic and perfect flowers of Impatiens differ at a very early period\nof growth.\n\nThe degree to which many of the most important organs in these degraded flowers\nhave been reduced or even wholly obliterated, is one of their most remarkable\npeculiarities, reminding us of many parasitic animals. In some cases only a\nsingle anther is left, and this contains but few pollen-grains of diminished\nsize; in other cases the stigma has disappeared, leaving a simple open passage\ninto the ovarium. It is also interesting to note the complete loss of trifling\npoints in the structure or functions of certain parts, which though of service\nto the perfect flowers, are of none to the cleistogamic; for instance the\ncollecting hairs on the pistil of Specularia, the glands on the calyx of the\nMalpighiaceae, the nectar-secreting appendages to the lower stamens of Viola,\nthe secretion of nectar by other parts, the emission of a sweet odour, and\napparently the elasticity of the valves in the buried capsules of Viola odorata.\nWe here see, as throughout nature, that as soon as any part or character becomes\nsuperfluous it tends sooner or later to disappear.\n\nAnother peculiarity in these flowers is that the pollen-grains generally emit\ntheir tubes whilst still enclosed within the anthers; but this is not so\nremarkable a fact as was formerly thought, when the case of Asclepias was alone\nknown. (8\/28. The case of Asclepias was described by R. Brown. Baillon asserts\n'Adansonia' tome 2 1862 page 58, that with many plants the tubes are emitted\nfrom pollen-grains which have not come into contact with the stigma; and that\nthey may be seen advancing horizontally through the air towards the stigma. I\nhave observed the emission of the tubes from the pollen-masses whilst still\nwithin the anthers, in three widely distinct Orchidean genera namely Aceras,\nMalaxis, and Neottia: see 'The Various Contrivances by which Orchids are\nFertilised' 2nd edition page 258.) It is, however, a wonderful sight to behold\nthe tubes directing themselves in a straight line to the stigma, when this is at\nsome little distance from the anthers. As soon as they reach the stigma or the\nopen passage leading into the ovarium, no doubt they penetrate it, guided by the\nsame means, whatever these may be, as in the case of ordinary flowers. I thought\nthat they might be guided by the avoidance of light: some pollen-grains of a\nwillow were therefore immersed in an extremely weak solution of honey, and the\nvessel was placed so that the light entered only in one direction, laterally or\nfrom below or from above, but the long tubes were in each case protruded in\nevery possible direction.\n\nAs cleistogamic flowers are completely closed they are necessarily self-\nfertilised, not to mention the absence of any attraction to insects; and they\nthus differ widely from the great majority of ordinary flowers. Delpino believes\nthat cleistogamic flowers have been developed in order to ensure the production\nof seeds under climatic or other conditions which tend to prevent the\nfertilisation of the perfect flowers. (8\/29. 'Sull' Opera la Distribuzione dei\nSessi nelle Piante' 1867 page 30.) I do not doubt that this holds good to a\ncertain limited extent, but the production of a large supply of seeds with\nlittle consumption of nutrient matter or expenditure of vital force is probably\na far more efficient motive power. The whole flower is much reduced in size; but\nwhat is much more important, an extremely small quantity of pollen has to be\nformed, as none is lost through the action of insects or the weather; and pollen\ncontains much nitrogen and phosphorus. Von Mohl estimated that a single\ncleistogamic anther-cell of Oxalis acetosella contained from one to two dozen\npollen-grains; we will say 20, and if so the whole flower can have produced at\nmost 400 grains; with Impatiens the whole number may be estimated in the same\nmanner at 250; with Leersia at 210; and with Viola nana at only 100. These\nfigures are wonderfully low compared with the 243,600 pollen-grains produced by\na flower of Leontodon, the 4,863 by an Hibiscus, or the 3,654,000 by a Paeony.\n(8\/30. The authorities for these statements are given in my 'Effects of Cross\nand Self-Fertilisation' page 376.) We thus see that cleistogamic flowers produce\nseeds with a wonderfully small expenditure of pollen; and they produce as a\ngeneral rule quite as many seeds as the perfect flowers.\n\nThat the production of a large number of seeds is necessary or beneficial to\nmany plants needs no evidence. So of course is their preservation before they\nare ready for germination; and it is one of the many remarkable peculiarities of\nthe plants which bear cleistogamic flowers, that an incomparably larger\nproportion of them than of ordinary plants bury their young ovaries in the\nground;--an action which it may be presumed serves to protect them from being\ndevoured by birds or other enemies. But this advantage is accompanied by the\nloss of the power of wide dissemination. No less than eight of the genera in the\nlist at the beginning of this chapter include species which act in this manner,\nnamely, several kinds of Viola, Oxalis, Vandellia, Linaria, Commelina, and at\nleast three genera of Leguminosae. The seeds also of Leersia, though not buried,\nare concealed in the most perfect manner within the sheaths of the leaves.\nCleistogamic flowers possess great facilities for burying their young ovaries or\ncapsules, owing to their small size, pointed shape, closed condition and the\nabsence of a corolla; and we can thus understand how it is that so many of them\nhave acquired this curious habit.\n\nIt has already been shown that in about 32 out of the 55 genera in the list just\nreferred to, the perfect flowers are irregular; and this implies that they have\nbeen specially adapted for fertilisation by insects. Moreover three of the\ngenera with regular flowers are adapted by other means for the same end. Flowers\nthus constructed are liable during certain seasons to be imperfectly fertilised,\nnamely, when the proper insects are scarce; and it is difficult to avoid the\nbelief that the production of cleistogamic flowers, which ensures under all\ncircumstances a full supply of seed, has been in part determined by the perfect\nflowers being liable to fail in their fertilisation. But if this determining\ncause be a real one, it must be of subordinate importance, as four of the genera\nin the list are fertilised by the wind; and there seems no reason why their\nperfect flowers should fail to be fertilised more frequently than those in any\nother anemophilous genus. In contrast with what we here see with respect to the\nlarge proportion of the perfect flowers being irregular, one genus alone out of\nthe 38 heterostyled genera described in the previous chapters bears such\nflowers; yet all these genera are absolutely dependent on insects for their\nlegitimate fertilisation. I know not how to account for this difference in the\nproportion of the plants bearing regular and irregular flowers in the two\nclasses, unless it be that the heterostyled flowers are already so well adapted\nfor cross-fertilisation, through the position of their stamens and pistils and\nthe difference in power of their two or three kinds of pollen, that any\nadditional adaptation, namely, through the flowers being made irregular, has\nbeen rendered superfluous.\n\nAlthough cleistogamic flowers never fail to yield a large number of seeds, yet\nthe plants bearing them usually produce perfect flowers, either simultaneously\nor more commonly at a different period; and these are adapted for or admit of\ncross-fertilisation. From the cases given of the two Indian species of Viola,\nwhich produced in this country during several years only cleistogamic flowers,\nand of the numerous plants of Vandellia and of some plants of Ononis which\nbehaved during one whole season in the same manner, it appears rash to infer\nfrom such cases as that of Salvia cleistogama not having produced perfect\nflowers during five years in Germany (8\/31. Dr. Ascherson 'Botanische Zeitung'\n1871 page 555.), and of an Aspicarpa not having done so during several years in\nParis, that these plants would not bear perfect flowers in their native homes.\nVon Mohl and several other botanists have repeatedly insisted that as a general\nrule the perfect flowers produced by cleistogamic plants are sterile; but it has\nbeen shown under the head of the several species that this is not the case. The\nperfect flowers Viola are indeed sterile unless they are visited by bees; but\nwhen thus visited they yield the full number of seeds. As far as I have been\nable to discover there is only one absolute exception to the rule that the\nperfect flowers are fertile, namely, that of Voandzeia; and in this case we\nshould remember that cultivation often affects injuriously the reproductive\norgans. Although the perfect flowers of Leersia sometimes yield seeds, yet this\noccurs so rarely, as far as hitherto observed, that it practically forms a\nsecond exception to the rule.\n\nAs cleistogamic flowers are invariably fertilised, and as they are produced in\nlarge numbers, they yield altogether a much larger supply of seeds than do the\nperfect flowers on the same plant. But the latter flowers will occasionally be\ncross-fertilised, and their offspring will thus be invigorated, as we may infer\nfrom a wide-spread analogy. But of such invigoration I have only a small amount\nof direct evidence: two crossed seedlings of Ononis minutissima were put into\ncompetition with two seedlings raised from cleistogamic flowers; they were at\nfirst all of equal height; the crossed were then slightly beaten; but on the\nfollowing year they showed the usual superiority of their class, and were to the\nself-fertilised plants of cleistogamic origin as 100 to 88 in mean height. With\nVandellia twenty crossed plants exceeded in height twenty plants raised from\ncleistogamic seeds only by a little, namely, in the ratio of 100 to 94.\n\nIt is a natural inquiry how so many plants belonging to various very distinct\nfamilies first came to have the development of their flowers arrested, so as\nultimately to become cleistogamic. That a passage from the one state to the\nother is far from difficult is shown by the many recorded cases of gradations\nbetween the two states on the same plant, in Viola, Oxalis, Biophytum,\nCampanula, etc. In the several species of Viola the various parts of the flowers\nhave also been modified in very different degrees. Those plants which in their\nown country produce flowers of full or nearly full size, but never expand (as\nwith Thelymitra), and yet set fruit, might easily be rendered cleistogamic.\nLathyrus nissolia seems to be in an incipient transitional state, as does\nDrosera Anglica, the flowers of which are not perfectly closed. There is good\nevidence that flowers sometimes fail to expand and are somewhat reduced in size,\nowing to exposure to unfavourable conditions, but still retain their fertility\nunimpaired. Linnaeus observed in 1753 that the flowers on several plants brought\nfrom Spain and grown at Upsala did not show any corolla and yet produced seeds.\nAsa Gray has seen flowers on exotic plants in the Northern United States which\nnever expanded and yet fruited. With certain English plants, which bear flowers\nduring nearly the whole year, Mr. Bennett found that those produced during the\nwinter season were fertilised in the bud; whilst with other species having fixed\ntimes for flowering, but \"which had been tempted by a mild January to put forth\na few wretched flowers,\" no pollen was discharged from the anthers, and no seed\nwas formed. The flowers of Lysimachia vulgaris if fully exposed to the sun\nexpand properly, while those growing in shady ditches have smaller corollas\nwhich open only slightly; and these two forms graduate into one another in\nintermediate stations. Herr Bouche's observations are of especial interest, for\nhe shows that both temperature and the amount of light affect the size of the\ncorolla; and he gives measurements proving that with some plants the corolla is\ndiminished by the increasing cold and darkness of the changing season, whilst\nwith others it is diminished by the increasing heat and light. (8\/32. For the\nstatement by Linnaeus see Mohl in 'Botanische Zeitung' 1863 page 327. Asa Gray\n'American Journal of Science' 2nd series volume 39 1865 page 105. Bennett in\n'Nature' November 1869 page 11. The Reverend G. Henslow also says 'Gardener's\nChronicle' 1877 page 271, also 'Nature' October 19, 1876 page 543, \"that when\nthe autumn draws on, and habitually in winter for such of our wild flowers as\nblossom at that season\" the flowers are self-fertilised. On Lysimachia H. Muller\n'Nature' September 1873 page 433. Bouche 'Sitzungsbericht der Gesell.\nNaturforsch. Freunde' October 1874 page 90.)\n\nThe belief that the first step towards flowers being rendered cleistogamic was\ndue to the conditions to which they were exposed, is supported by the fact of\nvarious plants belonging to this class either not producing their cleistogamic\nflowers under certain conditions, or, on the other hand, producing them to the\ncomplete exclusion of the perfect ones. Thus some species of Viola do not bear\ncleistogamic flowers when growing on the lowlands or in certain districts. Other\nplants when cultivated have failed to produce perfect flowers during several\nsuccessive years; and this is the case with Juncus bufonius in its native land\nof Russia. Cleistogamic flowers are produced by some species late and by others\nearly in the season; and this agrees with the view that the first step towards\ntheir development was due to climate; though the periods at which the two sorts\nof flowers now appear must since have become much more distinctly defined. We do\nnot know whether too low are too high a temperature or the amount of light acts\nin a direct manner on the size of the corolla, or indirectly through the male\norgans being first affected. However this may be, if a plant were prevented\neither early or late in the season from fully expanding its corolla, with some\nreduction in its size, but with no loss of the power of self-fertilisation, then\nnatural selection might well complete the work and render it strictly\ncleistogamic. The various organs would also, it is probable, be modified by the\npeculiar conditions to which they are subjected within a completely closed\nflower; also by the principle of correlated growth, and by the tendency in all\nreduced organs finally to disappear. The result would be the production of\ncleistogamic flowers such as we now see them; and these are admirably fitted to\nyield a copious supply of seed at a wonderfully small cost to the plant.\n\nI will now sum up very briefly the chief conclusions which seem to follow from\nthe observations given in this volume. Cleistogamic flowers afford, as just\nstated, an abundant supply of seeds with little expenditure; and we can hardly\ndoubt that they have had their structure modified and degraded for this special\npurpose; perfect flowers being still almost always produced so as to allow of\noccasional cross-fertilisation. Hermaphrodite plants have often been rendered\nmonoecious, dioecious or polygamous; but as the separation of the sexes would\nhave been injurious, had not pollen been already transported habitually by\ninsects or by the wind from flower to flower, we may assume that the process of\nseparation did not commence and was not completed for the sake of the advantages\nto be gained from cross-fertilisation. The sole motive for the separation of the\nsexes which occurs to me, is that the production of a great number of seeds\nmight become superfluous to a plant under changed conditions of life; and it\nmight then be highly beneficial to it that the same flower or the same\nindividual should not have its vital powers taxed, under the struggle for life\nto which all organisms are subjected, by producing both pollen and seeds. With\nrespect to the plants belonging to the gyno-dioecious sub-class, or those which\nco-exist as hermaphrodites and females, it has been proved that they yield a\nmuch larger supply of seed than they would have done if they had all remained\nhermaphrodites; and we may feel sure from the large number of seeds produced by\nmany plants that such production is often necessary or advantageous. It is\ntherefore probable that the two forms in this sub-class have been separated or\ndeveloped for this special end.\n\nVarious hermaphrodite plants have become heterostyled, and now exist under two\nor three forms; and we may confidently believe that this has been effected in\norder that cross-fertilisation should be assured. For the full and legitimate\nfertilisation of these plants pollen from the one form must be applied to the\nstigma of another. If the sexual elements belonging to the same form are united\nthe union is an illegitimate one and more or less sterile. With dimorphic\nspecies two illegitimate unions, and with trimorphic species twelve are\npossible. There is reason to believe that the sterility of these unions has not\nbeen specially acquired, but follows as an incidental result from the sexual\nelements of the two or three forms having been adapted to act on one another in\na particular manner, so that any other kind of union is inefficient, like that\nbetween distinct species. Another and still more remarkable incidental result is\nthat the seedlings from an illegitimate union are often dwarfed and more or less\nor completely barren, like hybrids from the union of two widely distinct\nspecies.\n\n\nINDEX.\n\nAcanthaceae.\n\nAcer campestre.\n\nAdoxa.\n\nAegiphila elata.\n--mollis.\n--obdurata.\n\nAlefeld, Dr., on Linum.\n\nAlisma
