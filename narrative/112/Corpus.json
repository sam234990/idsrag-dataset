{"ori_id":"1915f92c4152b867fa9bee83e61b901983f8a3ea","title":"Sylvia's Lovers","context":"Sylvia's Lovers\n The novel begins in the 1790s in the coastal town of Monkshaven (modeled on Whitby, England) against the background of the practice of impressment during the early phases of the Napoleonic Wars. Sylvia Robson lives happily with her parents on a farm, and is passionately loved by her rather dull Quaker cousin Philip. She, however, meets and falls in love with Charlie Kinraid, a dashing sailor on a whaling vessel, and they become secretly engaged. When Kinraid goes back to his ship, he is forcibly enlisted in the Royal Navy by a press gang, a scene witnessed by Philip. Philip does not tell Sylvia of the incident nor relay to her Charlie's parting message and, believing her lover is dead, Sylvia eventually marries her cousin. This act is primarily prompted out of gratefulness for Philip's assistance during a difficult time following her father's imprisonment and subsequent execution for leading a revengeful raid on press-gang collaborators. They have a daughter. Inevitably, Kinraid returns to claim Sylvia and she discovers that Philip knew all the time that he was still alive. Philip leaves her in despair at her subsequent rage and rejection, but she refuses to live with Kinraid because of her child.\nPhilip joins the army under a pseudonym, and ends up fighting in the Napoleonic wars, where he saves Kinraid's life. Kinraid returns to Britain, and marries. His wife, who knows nothing of their history together, informs Sylvia that her husband is a great military leader. Kinraid's marriage suggests to Sylvia that he was not as faithful to her as she had remained to him, and she then realizes she is actually in love with Philip. Philip, meanwhile horribly disfigured by a shipboard explosion, returns to the small Northumbrian village to try to secretly get a glimpse of his child. He ends up staying with the sister of a servant of Sylvia's deceased parents, and rescues his child when she nearly drowns. He is fatally injured while saving his daughter, but his identity then becomes known and he is reconciled with his wife on his deathbed.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg EBook of Sylvia's Lovers -- Complete, by\nElizabeth Cleghorn Gaskell\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

There were, however, but half the number at the end of\nthe last century, and it was at that period that the events narrated\nin the following pages occurred.\n\nMonkshaven was a name not unknown in the history of England, and\ntraditions of its having been the landing-place of a throneless\nqueen were current in the town. At that time there had been a\nfortified castle on the heights above it, the site of which was now\noccupied by a deserted manor-house; and at an even earlier date than\nthe arrival of the queen and coeval with the most ancient remains of\nthe castle, a great monastery had stood on those cliffs, overlooking\nthe vast ocean that blended with the distant sky. Monkshaven itself\nwas built by the side of the Dee, just where the river falls into\nthe German Ocean. The principal street of the town ran parallel to\nthe stream, and smaller lanes branched out of this, and straggled up\nthe sides of the steep hill, between which and the river the houses\nwere pent in. There was a bridge across the Dee, and consequently a\nBridge Street running at right angles to the High Street; and on the\nsouth side of the stream there were a few houses of more pretension,\naround which lay gardens and fields. It was on this side of the town\nthat the local aristocracy lived. And who were the great people of\nthis small town? Not the younger branches of the county families\nthat held hereditary state in their manor-houses on the wild bleak\nmoors, that shut in Monkshaven almost as effectually on the land\nside as ever the waters did on the sea-board. No; these old families\nkept aloof from the unsavoury yet adventurous trade which brought\nwealth to generation after generation of certain families in\nMonkshaven.\n\nThe magnates of Monkshaven were those who had the largest number of\nships engaged in the whaling-trade. Something like the following was\nthe course of life with a Monkshaven lad of this class:--He was\napprenticed as a sailor to one of the great ship-owners--to his own\nfather, possibly--along with twenty other boys, or, it might be,\neven more. During the summer months he and his fellow apprentices\nmade voyages to the Greenland seas, returning with their cargoes in\nthe early autumn; and employing the winter months in watching the\npreparation of the oil from the blubber in the melting-sheds, and\nlearning navigation from some quaint but experienced teacher, half\nschoolmaster, half sailor, who seasoned his instructions by stirring\nnarrations of the wild adventures of his youth. The house of the\nship-owner to whom he was apprenticed was his home and that of his\ncompanions during the idle season between October and March. The\ndomestic position of these boys varied according to the premium\npaid; some took rank with the sons of the family, others were\nconsidered as little better than servants. Yet once on board an\nequality prevailed, in which, if any claimed superiority, it was the\nbravest and brightest. After a certain number of voyages the\nMonkshaven lad would rise by degrees to be captain, and as such\nwould have a share in the venture; all these profits, as well as all\nhis savings, would go towards building a whaling vessel of his own,\nif he was not so fortunate as to be the child of a ship-owner. At\nthe time of which I write, there was but little division of labour\nin the Monkshaven whale fishery. The same man might be the owner of\nsix or seven ships, any one of which he himself was fitted by\neducation and experience to command; the master of a score of\napprentices, each of whom paid a pretty sufficient premium; and the\nproprietor of the melting-sheds into which his cargoes of blubber\nand whalebone were conveyed to be fitted for sale. It was no wonder\nthat large fortunes were acquired by these ship-owners, nor that\ntheir houses on the south side of the river Dee were stately\nmansions, full of handsome and substantial furniture. It was also\nnot surprising that the whole town had an amphibious appearance, to\na degree unusual even in a seaport. Every one depended on the whale\nfishery, and almost every male inhabitant had been, or hoped to be,\na sailor. Down by the river the smell was almost intolerable to any\nbut Monkshaven people during certain seasons of the year; but on\nthese unsavoury 'staithes' the old men and children lounged for\nhours, almost as if they revelled in the odours of train-oil.\n\nThis is, perhaps, enough of a description of the town itself. I have\nsaid that the country for miles all around was moorland; high above\nthe level of the sea towered the purple crags, whose summits were\ncrowned with greensward that stole down the sides of the scaur a\nlittle way in grassy veins. Here and there a brook forced its way\nfrom the heights down to the sea, making its channel into a valley\nmore or less broad in long process of time. And in the moorland\nhollows, as in these valleys, trees and underwood grew and\nflourished; so that, while on the bare swells of the high land you\nshivered at the waste desolation of the scenery, when you dropped\ninto these wooded 'bottoms' you were charmed with the nestling\nshelter which they gave. But above and around these rare and fertile\nvales there were moors for many a mile, here and there bleak enough,\nwith the red freestone cropping out above the scanty herbage; then,\nperhaps, there was a brown tract of peat and bog, uncertain footing\nfor the pedestrian who tried to make a short cut to his destination;\nthen on the higher sandy soil there was the purple ling, or\ncommonest species of heather growing in beautiful wild luxuriance.\nTufts of fine elastic grass were occasionally to be found, on which\nthe little black-faced sheep browsed; but either the scanty food, or\ntheir goat-like agility, kept them in a lean condition that did not\npromise much for the butcher, nor yet was their wool of a quality\nfine enough to make them profitable in that way to their owners. In\nsuch districts there is little population at the present day; there\nwas much less in the last century, before agriculture was\nsufficiently scientific to have a chance of contending with such\nnatural disqualifications as the moors presented, and when there\nwere no facilities of railroads to bring sportsmen from a distance\nto enjoy the shooting season, and make an annual demand for\naccommodation.\n\nThere were old stone halls in the valleys; there were bare\nfarmhouses to be seen on the moors at long distances apart, with\nsmall stacks of coarse poor hay, and almost larger stacks of turf\nfor winter fuel in their farmyards. The cattle in the pasture fields\nbelonging to these farms looked half starved; but somehow there was\nan odd, intelligent expression in their faces, as well as in those\nof the black-visaged sheep, which is seldom seen in the placidly\nstupid countenances of well-fed animals. All the fences were turf\nbanks, with loose stones piled into walls on the top of these.\n\nThere was comparative fertility and luxuriance down below in the\nrare green dales. The narrow meadows stretching along the brookside\nseemed as though the cows could really satisfy their hunger in the\ndeep rich grass; whereas on the higher lands the scanty herbage was\nhardly worth the fatigue of moving about in search of it. Even in\nthese 'bottoms' the piping sea-winds, following the current of the\nstream, stunted and cut low any trees; but still there was rich\nthick underwood, tangled and tied together with brambles, and\nbrier-rose, [sic] and honeysuckle; and if the farmer in these\ncomparatively happy valleys had had wife or daughter who cared for\ngardening, many a flower would have grown on the western or southern\nside of the rough stone house. But at that time gardening was not a\npopular art in any part of England; in the north it is not yet.\nNoblemen and gentlemen may have beautiful gardens; but farmers and\nday-labourers care little for them north of the Trent, which is all\nI can answer for. A few 'berry' bushes, a black currant tree or two\n(the leaves to be used in heightening the flavour of tea, the fruit\nas medicinal for colds and sore throats), a potato ground (and this\nwas not so common at the close of the last century as it is now), a\ncabbage bed, a bush of sage, and balm, and thyme, and marjoram, with\npossibly a rose tree, and 'old man' growing in the midst; a little\nplot of small strong coarse onions, and perhaps some marigolds, the\npetals of which flavoured the salt-beef broth; such plants made up a\nwell-furnished garden to a farmhouse at the time and place to which\nmy story belongs. But for twenty miles inland there was no\nforgetting the sea, nor the sea-trade; refuse shell-fish, seaweed,\nthe offal of the melting-houses, were the staple manure of the\ndistrict; great ghastly whale-jaws, bleached bare and white, were\nthe arches over the gate-posts to many a field or moorland stretch.\nOut of every family of several sons, however agricultural their\nposition might be, one had gone to sea, and the mother looked\nwistfully seaward at the changes of the keen piping moorland winds.\nThe holiday rambles were to the coast; no one cared to go inland to\nsee aught, unless indeed it might be to the great annual horse-fairs\nheld where the dreary land broke into habitation and cultivation.\n\nSomehow in this country sea thoughts followed the thinker far\ninland; whereas in most other parts of the island, at five miles\nfrom the ocean, he has all but forgotten the existence of such an\nelement as salt water. The great Greenland trade of the coasting\ntowns was the main and primary cause of this, no doubt. But there\nwas also a dread and an irritation in every one's mind, at the time\nof which I write, in connection with the neighbouring sea.\n\nSince the termination of the American war, there had been nothing to\ncall for any unusual energy in manning the navy; and the grants\nrequired by Government for this purpose diminished with every year\nof peace. In 1792 this grant touched its minimum for many years. In\n1793 the proceedings of the French had set Europe on fire, and the\nEnglish were raging with anti-Gallican excitement, fomented into\naction by every expedient of the Crown and its Ministers. We had our\nships; but where were our men? The Admiralty had, however, a ready\nremedy at hand, with ample precedent for its use, and with common\n(if not statute) law to sanction its application. They issued 'press\nwarrants,' calling upon the civil power throughout the country to\nsupport their officers in the discharge of their duty. The sea-coast\nwas divided into districts, under the charge of a captain in the\nnavy, who again delegated sub-districts to lieutenants; and in this\nmanner all homeward-bound vessels were watched and waited for, all\nports were under supervision; and in a day, if need were, a large\nnumber of men could be added to the forces of his Majesty's navy.\nBut if the Admiralty became urgent in their demands, they were also\nwilling to be unscrupulous. Landsmen, if able-bodied, might soon be\ntrained into good sailors; and once in the hold of the tender, which\nalways awaited the success of the operations of the press-gang, it\nwas difficult for such prisoners to bring evidence of the nature of\ntheir former occupations, especially when none had leisure to listen\nto such evidence, or were willing to believe it if they did listen,\nor would act upon it for the release of the captive if they had by\npossibility both listened and believed. Men were kidnapped,\nliterally disappeared, and nothing was ever heard of them again. The\nstreet of a busy town was not safe from such press-gang captures, as\nLord Thurlow could have told, after a certain walk he took about\nthis time on Tower Hill, when he, the attorney-general of England,\nwas impressed, when the Admiralty had its own peculiar ways of\ngetting rid of tiresome besiegers and petitioners. Nor yet were\nlonely inland dwellers more secure; many a rustic went to a statute\nfair or 'mop,' and never came home to tell of his hiring; many a\nstout young farmer vanished from his place by the hearth of his\nfather, and was no more heard of by mother or lover; so great was\nthe press for men to serve in the navy during the early years of the\nwar with France, and after every great naval victory of that war.\n\nThe servants of the Admiralty lay in wait for all merchantmen and\ntraders; there were many instances of vessels returning home after\nlong absence, and laden with rich cargo, being boarded within a\nday's distance of land, and so many men pressed and carried off,\nthat the ship, with her cargo, became unmanageable from the loss of\nher crew, drifted out again into the wild wide ocean, and was\nsometimes found in the helpless guidance of one or two infirm or\nignorant sailors; sometimes such vessels were never heard of more.\nThe men thus pressed were taken from the near grasp of parents or\nwives, and were often deprived of the hard earnings of years, which\nremained in the hands of the masters of the merchantman in which\nthey had served, subject to all the chances of honesty or\ndishonesty, life or death. Now all this tyranny (for I can use no\nother word) is marvellous to us; we cannot imagine how it is that a\nnation submitted to it for so long, even under any warlike\nenthusiasm, any panic of invasion, any amount of loyal subservience\nto the governing powers. When we read of the military being called\nin to assist the civil power in backing up the press-gang, of\nparties of soldiers patrolling the streets, and sentries with\nscrewed bayonets placed at every door while the press-gang entered\nand searched each hole and corner of the dwelling; when we hear of\nchurches being surrounded during divine service by troops, while the\npress-gang stood ready at the door to seize men as they came out\nfrom attending public worship, and take these instances as merely\ntypes of what was constantly going on in different forms, we do not\nwonder at Lord Mayors, and other civic authorities in large towns,\ncomplaining that a stop was put to business by the danger which the\ntradesmen and their servants incurred in leaving their houses and\ngoing into the streets, infested by press-gangs.\n\nWhether it was that living in closer neighbourhood to the\nmetropolis--the centre of politics and news--inspired the\ninhabitants of the southern counties with a strong feeling of that\nkind of patriotism which consists in hating all other nations; or\nwhether it was that the chances of capture were so much greater at\nall the southern ports that the merchant sailors became inured to\nthe danger; or whether it was that serving in the navy, to those\nfamiliar with such towns as Portsmouth and Plymouth, had an\nattraction to most men from the dash and brilliancy of the\nadventurous employment--it is certain that the southerners took the\noppression of press-warrants more submissively than the wild\nnorth-eastern people. For with them the chances of profit beyond\ntheir wages in the whaling or Greenland trade extended to the lowest\ndescription of sailor. He might rise by daring and saving to be a\nship-owner himself. Numbers around him had done so; and this very\nfact made the distinction between class and class less apparent; and\nthe common ventures and dangers, the universal interest felt in one\npursuit, bound the inhabitants of that line of coast together with a\nstrong tie, the severance of which by any violent extraneous\nmeasure, gave rise to passionate anger and thirst for vengeance. A\nYorkshireman once said to me, 'My county folk are all alike. Their\nfirst thought is how to resist. Why! I myself, if I hear a man say\nit is a fine day, catch myself trying to find out that it is no such\nthing. It is so in thought; it is so in word; it is so in deed.'\n\nSo you may imagine the press-gang had no easy time of it on the\nYorkshire coast. In other places they inspired fear, but here rage\nand hatred. The Lord Mayor of York was warned on 20th January, 1777,\nby an anonymous letter, that 'if those men were not sent from the\ncity on or before the following Tuesday, his lordship's own\ndwelling, and the Mansion-house also, should be burned to the\nground.'\n\nPerhaps something of the ill-feeling that prevailed on the subject\nwas owing to the fact which I have noticed in other places similarly\nsituated. Where the landed possessions of gentlemen of ancient\nfamily but limited income surround a centre of any kind of\nprofitable trade or manufacture, there is a sort of latent ill-will\non the part of the squires to the tradesman, be he manufacturer,\nmerchant, or ship-owner, in whose hands is held a power of\nmoney-making, which no hereditary pride, or gentlemanly love of\ndoing nothing, prevents him from using. This ill-will, to be sure,\nis mostly of a negative kind; its most common form of manifestation\nis in absence of speech or action, a sort of torpid and genteel\nignoring all unpleasant neighbours; but really the whale-fisheries\nof Monkshaven had become so impertinently and obtrusively prosperous\nof late years at the time of which I write, the Monkshaven\nship-owners were growing so wealthy and consequential, that the\nsquires, who lived at home at ease in the old stone manor-houses\nscattered up and down the surrounding moorland, felt that the check\nupon the Monkshaven trade likely to be inflicted by the press-gang,\nwas wisely ordained by the higher powers (how high they placed these\npowers I will not venture to say), to prevent overhaste in getting\nrich, which was a scriptural fault, and they also thought that they\nwere only doing their duty in backing up the Admiralty warrants by\nall the civil power at their disposal, whenever they were called\nupon, and whenever they could do so without taking too much trouble\nin affairs which did not after all much concern themselves.\n\nThere was just another motive in the minds of some provident parents\nof many daughters. The captains and lieutenants employed on this\nservice were mostly agreeable bachelors, brought up to a genteel\nprofession, at the least they were very pleasant visitors, when they\nhad a day to spare; who knew what might come of it?\n\nIndeed, these brave officers were not unpopular in Monkshaven\nitself, except at the time when they were brought into actual\ncollision with the people. They had the frank manners of their\nprofession; they were known to have served in those engagements, the\nvery narrative of which at this day will warm the heart of a Quaker,\nand they themselves did not come prominently forward in the dirty\nwork which, nevertheless, was permitted and quietly sanctioned by\nthem. So while few Monkshaven people passed the low public-house\nover which the navy blue-flag streamed, as a sign that it was the\nrendezvous of the press-gang, without spitting towards it in sign of\nabhorrence, yet, perhaps, the very same persons would give some\nrough token of respect to Lieutenant Atkinson if they met him in\nHigh Street. Touching their hats was an unknown gesture in those\nparts, but they would move their heads in a droll, familiar kind of\nway, neither a wag nor a nod, but meant all the same to imply\nfriendly regard. The ship-owners, too, invited him to an occasional\ndinner or supper, all the time looking forward to the chances of his\nturning out an active enemy, and not by any means inclined to give\nhim 'the run of the house,' however many unmarried daughters might\ngrace their table. Still as he could tell a rattling story, drink\nhard, and was seldom too busy to come at a short notice, he got on\nbetter than any one could have expected with the Monkshaven folk.\nAnd the principal share of the odium of his business fell on his\nsubordinates, who were one and all regarded in the light of mean\nkidnappers and spies--'varmint,' as the common people esteemed\nthem: and as such they were ready at the first provocation to hunt\nand to worry them, and little cared the press-gang for this.\nWhatever else they were, they were brave and daring. They had law to\nback them, therefore their business was lawful. They were serving\ntheir king and country. They were using all their faculties, and\nthat is always pleasant. There was plenty of scope for the glory and\ntriumph of outwitting; plenty of adventure in their life. It was a\nlawful and loyal employment, requiring sense, readiness, courage,\nand besides it called out that strange love of the chase inherent in\nevery man. Fourteen or fifteen miles at sea lay the _Aurora_, good\nman-of-war; and to her were conveyed the living cargoes of several\ntenders, which were stationed at likely places along the sea-coast.\nOne, the _Lively Lady_, might be seen from the cliffs above\nMonkshaven, not so far away, but hidden by the angle of the high\nlands from the constant sight of the townspeople; and there was\nalways the Randyvow-house (as the public-house with the navy\nblue-flag was called thereabouts) for the crew of the _Lively Lady_\nto lounge about, and there to offer drink to unwary passers-by. At\npresent this was all that the press-gang had done at Monkshaven.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\nHOME FROM GREENLAND\n\n\nOne hot day, early in October of the year 1796, two girls set off\nfrom their country homes to Monkshaven to sell their butter and\neggs, for they were both farmers' daughters, though rather in\ndifferent circumstances; for Molly Corney was one of a large family\nof children, and had to rough it accordingly; Sylvia Robson was an\nonly child, and was much made of in more people's estimation than\nMary's by her elderly parents. They had each purchases to make after\ntheir sales were effected, as sales of butter and eggs were effected\nin those days by the market-women sitting on the steps of the great\nold mutilated cross till a certain hour in the afternoon, after\nwhich, if all their goods were not disposed of, they took them\nunwillingly to the shops and sold them at a lower price. But good\nhousewives did not despise coming themselves to the Butter Cross,\nand, smelling and depreciating the articles they wanted, kept up a\nperpetual struggle of words, trying, often in vain, to beat down\nprices. A housekeeper of the last century would have thought that\nshe did not know her business, if she had not gone through this\npreliminary process; and the farmers' wives and daughters treated it\nall as a matter of course, replying with a good deal of independent\nhumour to the customer, who, once having discovered where good\nbutter and fresh eggs were to be sold, came time after time to\ndepreciate the articles she always ended in taking. There was\nleisure for all this kind of work in those days.\n\nMolly had tied a knot on her pink-spotted handkerchief for each of\nthe various purchases she had to make; dull but important articles\nneeded for the week's consumption at home; if she forgot any one of\nthem she knew she was sure of a good 'rating' from her mother. The\nnumber of them made her pocket-handkerchief look like one of the\nnine-tails of a 'cat;' but not a single thing was for herself, nor,\nindeed, for any one individual of her numerous family. There was\nneither much thought nor much money to spend for any but collective\nwants in the Corney family.\n\nIt was different with Sylvia. She was going to choose her first\ncloak, not to have an old one of her mother's, that had gone down\nthrough two sisters, dyed for the fourth time (and Molly would have\nbeen glad had even this chance been hers), but to buy a bran-new\nduffle cloak all for herself, with not even an elder authority to\ncurb her as to price, only Molly to give her admiring counsel, and\nas much sympathy as was consistent with a little patient envy of\nSylvia's happier circumstances. Every now and then they wandered off\nfrom the one grand subject of thought, but Sylvia, with unconscious\nart, soon brought the conversation round to the fresh consideration\nof the respective merits of gray and scarlet. These girls were\nwalking bare-foot and carrying their shoes and stockings in their\nhands during the first part of their way; but as they were drawing\nnear Monkshaven they stopped, and turned aside along a foot-path\nthat led from the main-road down to the banks of the Dee. There were\ngreat stones in the river about here, round which the waters\ngathered and eddied and formed deep pools. Molly sate down on the\ngrassy bank to wash her feet; but Sylvia, more active (or perhaps\nlighter-hearted with the notion of the cloak in the distance),\nplaced her basket on a gravelly bit of shore, and, giving a long\nspring, seated herself on a stone almost in the middle of the\nstream. Then she began dipping her little rosy toes in the cool\nrushing water and whisking them out with childish glee.\n\n'Be quiet, wi' the', Sylvia? Thou'st splashing me all ower, and my\nfeyther'll noane be so keen o' giving me a new cloak as thine is,\nseemingly.'\n\nSylvia was quiet, not to say penitent, in a moment. She drew up her\nfeet instantly; and, as if to take herself out of temptation, she\nturned away from Molly to that side of her stony seat on which the\ncurrent ran shallow, and broken by pebbles. But once disturbed in\nher play, her thoughts reverted to the great subject of the cloak.\nShe was now as still as a minute before she had been full of frolic\nand gambolling life. She had tucked herself up on the stone, as if\nit had been a cushion, and she a little sultana.\n\nMolly was deliberately washing her feet and drawing on her\nstockings, when she heard a sudden sigh, and her companion turned\nround so as to face her, and said,\n\n'I wish mother hadn't spoken up for t' gray.'\n\n'Why, Sylvia, thou wert saying as we topped t'brow, as she did\nnought but bid thee think twice afore settling on scarlet.'\n\n'Ay! but mother's words are scarce, and weigh heavy. Feyther's liker\nme, and we talk a deal o' rubble; but mother's words are liker to\nhewn stone. She puts a deal o' meaning in 'em. And then,' said\nSylvia, as if she was put out by the suggestion, 'she bid me ask\ncousin Philip for his opinion. I hate a man as has getten an opinion\non such-like things.'\n\n'Well! we shall niver get to Monkshaven this day, either for to sell\nour eggs and stuff, or to buy thy cloak, if we're sittin' here much\nlonger. T' sun's for slanting low, so come along, lass, and let's be\ngoing.'\n\n'But if I put on my stockings and shoon here, and jump back into yon\nwet gravel, I 'se not be fit to be seen,' said Sylvia, in a pathetic\ntone of bewilderment, that was funnily childlike. She stood up, her\nbare feet curved round the curving surface of the stone, her slight\nfigure balancing as if in act to spring.\n\n'Thou knows thou'll have just to jump back barefoot, and wash thy\nfeet afresh, without making all that ado; thou shouldst ha' done it\nat first, like me, and all other sensible folk. But thou'st getten\nno gumption.'\n\nMolly's mouth was stopped by Sylvia's hand. She was already on the\nriver bank by her friend's side.\n\n'Now dunnot lecture me; I'm none for a sermon hung on every peg o'\nwords. I'm going to have a new cloak, lass, and I cannot heed thee\nif thou dost lecture. Thou shall have all the gumption, and I'll\nhave my cloak.'\n\nIt may be doubted whether Molly thought this an equal division.\n\nEach girl wore tightly-fitting stockings, knit by her own hands, of\nthe blue worsted common in that country; they had on neat\nhigh-heeled black leather shoes, coming well over the instep, and\nfastened as well as ornamented with bright steel buckles. They did\nnot walk so lightly and freely now as they did before they were\nshod, but their steps were still springy with the buoyancy of early\nyouth; for neither of them was twenty, indeed I believe Sylvia was\nnot more than seventeen at this time.\n\nThey clambered up the steep grassy path, with brambles catching at\ntheir kilted petticoats, through the copse-wood, till they regained\nthe high road; and then they 'settled themselves,' as they called\nit; that is to say, they took off their black felt hats, and tied up\ntheir clustering hair afresh; they shook off every speck of wayside\ndust; straightened the little shawls (or large neck-kerchiefs, call\nthem which you will) that were spread over their shoulders, pinned\nbelow the throat, and confined at the waist by their apron-strings;\nand then putting on their hats again, and picking up their baskets,\nthey prepared to walk decorously into the town of Monkshaven.\n\nThe next turn of the road showed them the red peaked roofs of the\nclosely packed houses lying almost directly below the hill on which\nthey were. The full autumn sun brought out the ruddy colour of the\ntiled gables, and deepened the shadows in the narrow streets. The\nnarrow harbour at the mouth of the river was crowded with small\nvessels of all descriptions, making an intricate forest of masts.\nBeyond lay the sea, like a flat pavement of sapphire, scarcely a\nripple varying its sunny surface, that stretched out leagues away\ntill it blended with the softened azure of the sky. On this blue\ntrackless water floated scores of white-sailed fishing boats,\napparently motionless, unless you measured their progress by some\nland-mark; but still, and silent, and distant as they seemed, the\nconsciousness that there were men on board, each going forth into\nthe great deep, added unspeakably to the interest felt in watching\nthem. Close to the bar of the river Dee a larger vessel lay to.\nSylvia, who had only recently come into the neighbourhood, looked at\nthis with the same quiet interest as she did at all the others; but\nMolly, as soon as her eye caught the build of it, cried out aloud--\n\n'She's a whaler! she's a whaler home from t' Greenland seas! T'\nfirst this season! God bless her!' and she turned round and shook\nboth Sylvia's hands in the fulness of her excitement. Sylvia's\ncolour rose, and her eyes sparkled out of sympathy.\n\n'Is ta sure?' she asked, breathless in her turn; for though she did\nnot know by the aspect of the different ships on what trade they\nwere bound, yet she was well aware of the paramount interest\nattached to whaling vessels.\n\n'Three o'clock! and it's not high water till five!' said Molly. 'If\nwe're sharp we can sell our eggs, and be down to the staithes before\nshe comes into port. Be sharp, lass!'\n\nAnd down the steep long hill they went at a pace that was almost a\nrun. A run they dared not make it; and as it was, the rate at which\nthey walked would have caused destruction among eggs less carefully\npacked. When the descent was ended, there was yet the long narrow\nstreet before them, bending and swerving from the straight line, as\nit followed the course of the river. The girls felt as if they\nshould never come to the market-place, which was situated at the\ncrossing of Bridge Street and High Street. There the old stone cross\nwas raised by the monks long ago; now worn and mutilated, no one\nesteemed it as a holy symbol, but only as the Butter Cross, where\nmarket-women clustered on Wednesday, and whence the town crier made\nall his proclamations of household sales, things lost or found,\nbeginning with 'Oh! yes, oh! yes, oh! yes!' and ending with 'God\nbless the king and the lord of this manor,' and a very brisk 'Amen,'\nbefore he went on his way and took off the livery-coat, the colours\nof which marked him as a servant of the Burnabys, the family who\nheld manorial rights over Monkshaven.\n\nOf course the much frequented space surrounding the Butter Cross was\nthe favourite centre for shops; and on this day, a fine market day,\njust when good housewives begin to look over their winter store of\nblankets and flannels, and discover their needs betimes, these shops\nought to have had plenty of customers. But they were empty and of\neven quieter aspect than their every-day wont. The three-legged\ncreepie-stools that were hired out at a penny an hour to such\nmarket-women as came too late to find room on the steps were\nunoccupied; knocked over here and there, as if people had passed by\nin haste.\n\nMolly took in all at a glance, and interpreted the signs, though she\nhad no time to explain their meaning, and her consequent course of\naction, to Sylvia, but darted into a corner shop.\n\n'T' whalers is coming home! There's one lying outside t' bar!'\n\nThis was put in the form of an assertion; but the tone was that of\neager cross-questioning.\n\n'Ay!' said a lame man, mending fishing-nets behind a rough deal\ncounter. 'She's come back airly, and she's brought good news o' t'\nothers, as I've heered say. Time was I should ha' been on th'\nstaithes throwing up my cap wit' t' best on 'em; but now it pleases\nt' Lord to keep me at home, and set me to mind other folks' gear.\nSee thee, wench, there's a vast o' folk ha' left their skeps o'\nthings wi' me while they're away down to t' quay side. Leave me your\neggs and be off wi' ye for t' see t' fun, for mebbe ye'll live to be\npalsied yet, and then ye'll be fretting ower spilt milk, and that ye\ndidn't tak' all chances when ye was young. Ay, well! they're out o'\nhearin' o' my moralities; I'd better find a lamiter like mysen to\npreach to, for it's not iverybody has t' luck t' clargy has of\nsaying their say out whether folks likes it or not.'\n\nHe put the baskets carefully away with much of such talk as this\naddressed to himself while he did so. Then he sighed once or twice;\nand then he took the better course and began to sing over his tarry\nwork.\n\nMolly and Sylvia were far along the staithes by the time he got to\nthis point of cheerfulness. They ran on, regardless of stitches and\npains in the side; on along the river bank to where the concourse of\npeople was gathered. There was no great length of way between the\nButter Cross and the harbour; in five minutes the breathless girls\nwere close together in the best place they could get for seeing, on\nthe outside of the crowd; and in as short a time longer they were\npressed inwards, by fresh arrivals, into the very midst of the\nthrong. All eyes were directed to the ship, beating her anchor just\noutside the bar, not a quarter of a mile away. The custom-house\nofficer was just gone aboard of her to receive the captain's report\nof his cargo, and make due examination. The men who had taken him\nout in his boat were rowing back to the shore, and brought small\nfragments of news when they landed a little distance from the crowd,\nwhich moved as one man to hear what was to be told. Sylvia took a\nhard grasp of the hand of the older and more experienced Molly, and\nlistened open-mouthed to the answers she was extracting from a gruff\nold sailor she happened to find near her.\n\n'What ship is she?'\n\n'T' _Resolution_ of Monkshaven!' said he, indignantly, as if any\ngoose might have known that.\n\n'An' a good _Resolution_, and a blessed ship she's been to me,'\npiped out an old woman, close at Mary's elbow. 'She's brought me\nhome my ae' lad--for he shouted to yon boatman to bid him tell me he\nwas well. 'Tell Peggy Christison,' says he (my name is Margaret\nChristison)--'tell Peggy Christison as her son Hezekiah is come back\nsafe and sound.' The Lord's name be praised! An' me a widow as never\nthought to see my lad again!'\n\nIt seemed as if everybody relied on every one else's sympathy in\nthat hour of great joy.\n\n'I ax pardon, but if you'd gie me just a bit of elbow-room for a\nminute like, I'd hold my babby up, so that he might see daddy's\nship, and happen, my master might see him. He's four months old last\nTuesday se'nnight, and his feyther's never clapt eyne on him yet,\nand he wi' a tooth through, an another just breaking, bless him!'\n\nOne or two of the better end of the Monkshaven inhabitants stood a\nlittle before Molly and Sylvia; and as they moved in compliance with\nthe young mother's request, they overheard some of the information\nthese ship-owners had received from the boatman.\n\n'Haynes says they'll send the manifest of the cargo ashore in twenty\nminutes, as soon as Fishburn has looked over the casks. Only eight\nwhales, according to what he says.'\n\n'No one can tell,' said the other, 'till the manifest comes to\nhand.'\n\n'I'm afraid he's right. But he brings a good report of the _Good\nFortune_. She's off St Abb's Head, with something like fifteen\nwhales to her share.'\n\n'We shall see how much is true, when she comes in.'\n\n'That'll be by the afternoon tide to-morrow.'\n\n'That's my cousin's ship,' said Molly to Sylvia. 'He's specksioneer\non board the _Good Fortune_.'\n\nAn old man touched her as she spoke--\n\n'I humbly make my manners, missus, but I'm stone blind; my lad's\naboard yon vessel outside t' bar; and my old woman is bed-fast. Will\nshe be long, think ye, in making t' harbour? Because, if so be as\nshe were, I'd just make my way back, and speak a word or two to my\nmissus, who'll be boiling o'er into some mak o' mischief now she\nknows he's so near. May I be so bold as to ax if t' Crooked Negro is\ncovered yet?'\n\nMolly stood on tip-toe to try and see the black stone thus named;\nbut Sylvia, stooping and peeping through the glimpses afforded\nbetween the arms of the moving people, saw it first, and told the\nblind old man it was still above water.\n\n'A watched pot,' said he, 'ne'er boils, I reckon. It's ta'en a vast\no' watter t' cover that stone to-day. Anyhow, I'll have time to go\nhome and rate my missus for worritin' hersen, as I'll be bound she's\ndone, for all as I bade her not, but to keep easy and content.'\n\n'We'd better be off too,' said Molly, as an opening was made through\nthe press to let out the groping old man. 'Eggs and butter is yet to\nsell, and tha' cloak to be bought.'\n\n'Well, I suppose we had!' said Sylvia, rather regretfully; for,\nthough all the way into Monkshaven her head had been full of the\npurchase of this cloak, yet she was of that impressible nature that\ntakes the tone of feeling from those surrounding; and though she\nknew no one on board the Resolution, she was just as anxious for the\nmoment to see her come into harbour as any one in the crowd who had\na dear relation on board. So she turned reluctantly to follow the\nmore prudent Molly along the quay back to the Butter Cross.\n\nIt was a pretty scene, though it was too familiar to the eyes of all\nwho then saw it for them to notice its beauty. The sun was low\nenough in the west to turn the mist that filled the distant valley\nof the river into golden haze. Above, on either bank of the Dee,\nthere lay the moorland heights swelling one behind the other; the\nnearer, russet brown with the tints of the fading bracken; the more\ndistant, gray and dim against the rich autumnal sky. The red and\nfluted tiles of the gabled houses rose in crowded irregularity on\none side of the river, while the newer suburb was built in more\norderly and less picturesque fashion on the opposite cliff. The\nriver itself was swelling and chafing with the incoming tide till\nits vexed waters rushed over the very feet of the watching crowd on\nthe staithes, as the great sea waves encroached more and more every\nminute. The quay-side was unsavourily ornamented with glittering\nfish-scales, for the hauls of fish were cleansed in the open air,\nand no sanitary arrangements existed for sweeping away any of the\nrelics of this operation.\n\nThe fresh salt breeze was bringing up the lashing, leaping tide from\nthe blue sea beyond the bar. Behind the returning girls there rocked\nthe white-sailed ship, as if she were all alive with eagerness for\nher anchors to be heaved.\n\nHow impatient her crew of beating hearts were for that moment, how\nthose on land sickened at the suspense, may be imagined, when you\nremember that for six long summer months those sailors had been as\nif dead from all news of those they loved; shut up in terrible,\ndreary Arctic seas from the hungry sight of sweethearts and friends,\nwives and mothers. No one knew what might have happened. The crowd\non shore grew silent and solemn before the dread of the possible\nnews of death that might toll in upon their hearts with this\nuprushing tide. The whalers went out into the Greenland seas full of\nstrong, hopeful men; but the whalers never returned as they sailed\nforth. On land there are deaths among two or three hundred men to be\nmourned over in every half-year's space of time. Whose bones had\nbeen left to blacken on the gray and terrible icebergs? Who lay\nstill until the sea should give up its dead? Who were those who\nshould come back to Monkshaven never, no, never more?\n\nMany a heart swelled with passionate, unspoken fear, as the first\nwhaler lay off the bar on her return voyage.\n\nMolly and Sylvia had left the crowd in this hushed suspense. But\nfifty yards along the staithe they passed five or six girls with\nflushed faces and careless attire, who had mounted a pile of timber,\nplaced there to season for ship-building, from which, as from the\nsteps of a ladder or staircase, they could command the harbour. They\nwere wild and free in their gestures, and held each other by the\nhand, and swayed from side to side, stamping their feet in time, as\nthey sang--\n\n  Weel may the keel row, the keel row, the keel row,\n  Weel may the keel row that my laddie's in!\n\n'What for are ye going off, now?' they called out to our two girls.\n'She'll be in in ten minutes!' and without waiting for the answer\nwhich never came, they resumed their song.\n\nOld sailors stood about in little groups, too proud to show their\ninterest in the adventures they could no longer share, but quite\nunable to keep up any semblance of talk on indifferent subjects.\n\nThe town seemed very quiet and deserted as Molly and Sylvia entered\nthe dark, irregular Bridge Street, and the market-place was as empty\nof people as before. But the skeps and baskets and three-legged\nstools were all cleared away.\n\n'Market's over for to-day,' said Molly Corney, in disappointed\nsurprise. 'We mun make the best on't, and sell to t' huxters, and a\nhard bargain they'll be for driving. I doubt mother'll be vexed.'\n\nShe and Sylvia went to the corner shop to reclaim their baskets. The\nman had his joke at them for their delay.\n\n'Ay, ay! lasses as has sweethearts a-coming home don't care much\nwhat price they get for butter and eggs! I dare say, now, there's\nsome un in yon ship that 'ud give as much as a shilling a pound for\nthis butter if he only knowed who churned it!' This was to Sylvia,\nas he handed her back her property.\n\nThe fancy-free Sylvia reddened, pouted, tossed back her head, and\nhardly deigned a farewell word of thanks or civility to the lame\nman; she was at an age to be affronted by any jokes on such a\nsubject. Molly took the joke without disclaimer and without offence.\nShe rather liked the unfounded idea of her having a sweetheart, and\nwas rather surprised to think how devoid of foundation the notion\nwas. If she could have a new cloak as Sylvia was going to have,\nthen, indeed, there might be a chance! Until some such good luck, it\nwas as well to laugh and blush as if the surmise of her having a\nlover was not very far from the truth, and so she replied in\nsomething of the same strain as the lame net-maker to his joke about\nthe butter.\n\n'He'll need it all, and more too, to grease his tongue, if iver he\nreckons to win me for his wife!'\n\nWhen they were out of the shop, Sylvia said, in a coaxing tone,--\n\n'Molly, who is it? Whose tongue 'll need greasing? Just tell me, and\nI'll never tell!'\n\nShe was so much in earnest that Molly was perplexed. She did not\nquite like saying that she had alluded to no one in particular, only\nto a possible sweetheart, so she began to think what young man had\nmade the most civil speeches to her in her life; the list was not a\nlong one to go over, for her father was not so well off as to make\nher sought after for her money, and her face was rather of the\nhomeliest. But she suddenly remembered her cousin, the specksioneer,\nwho had given her two large shells, and taken a kiss from her\nhalf-willing lips before he went to sea the last time. So she smiled\na little, and then said,--\n\n'Well! I dunno. It's ill talking o' these things afore one has made\nup one's mind. And perhaps if Charley Kinraid behaves hissen, I\nmight be brought to listen.'\n\n'Charley Kinraid! who's he?'\n\n'Yon specksioneer cousin o' mine, as I was talking on.'\n\n'And do yo' think he cares for yo'?' asked Sylvia, in a low, tender\ntone, as if touching on a great mystery.\n\nMolly only said, 'Be quiet wi' yo',' and Sylvia could not make out\nwhether she cut the conversation so short because she was offended,\nor because they had come to the shop where they had to sell their\nbutter and eggs.\n\n'Now, Sylvia, if thou'll leave me thy basket, I'll make as good a\nbargain as iver I can on 'em; and thou can be off to choose this\ngrand new cloak as is to be, afore it gets any darker. Where is ta\ngoing to?'\n\n'Mother said I'd better go to Foster's,' answered Sylvia, with a\nshade of annoyance in her face. 'Feyther said just anywhere.'\n\n'Foster's is t' best place; thou canst try anywhere afterwards. I'll\nbe at Foster's in five minutes, for I reckon we mun hasten a bit\nnow. It'll be near five o'clock.'\n\nSylvia hung her head and looked very demure as she walked off by\nherself to Foster's shop in the market-place.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\nBUYING A NEW CLOAK\n\n\nFoster's shop was the shop of Monkshaven. It was kept by two Quaker\nbrothers, who were now old men; and their father had kept it before\nthem; probably his father before that. People remembered it as an\nold-fashioned dwelling-house, with a sort of supplementary shop with\nunglazed windows projecting from the lower story. These openings had\nlong been filled with panes of glass that at the present day would\nbe accounted very small, but which seventy years ago were much\nadmired for their size. I can best make you understand the\nappearance of the place by bidding you think of the long openings in\na butcher's shop, and then to fill them up in your imagination with\npanes about eight inches by six, in a heavy wooden frame. There was\none of these windows on each side the door-place, which was kept\npartially closed through the day by a low gate about a yard high.\nHalf the shop was appropriated to grocery; the other half to\ndrapery, and a little mercery. The good old brothers gave all their\nknown customers a kindly welcome; shaking hands with many of them,\nand asking all after their families and domestic circumstances\nbefore proceeding to business. They would not for the world have had\nany sign of festivity at Christmas, and scrupulously kept their shop\nopen at that holy festival, ready themselves to serve sooner than\ntax the consciences of any of their assistants, only nobody ever\ncame. But on New Year's Day they had a great cake, and wine, ready\nin the parlour behind the shop, of which all who came in to buy\nanything were asked to partake. Yet, though scrupulous in most\nthings, it did not go against the consciences of these good brothers\nto purchase smuggled articles. There was a back way from the\nriver-side, up a covered entry, to the yard-door of the Fosters, and\na peculiar kind of knock at this door always brought out either John\nor Jeremiah, or if not them, their shopman, Philip Hepburn; and the\nsame cake and wine that the excise officer's wife might just have\nbeen tasting, was brought out in the back parlour to treat the\nsmuggler. There was a little locking of doors, and drawing of the\ngreen silk curtain that was supposed to shut out the shop, but\nreally all this was done very much for form's sake. Everybody in\nMonkshaven smuggled who could, and every one wore smuggled goods who\ncould, and great reliance was placed on the excise officer's\nneighbourly feelings.\n\nThe story went that John and Jeremiah Foster were so rich that they\ncould buy up all the new town across the bridge. They had certainly\nbegun to have a kind of primitive bank in connection with their\nshop, receiving and taking care of such money as people did not wish\nto retain in their houses for fear of burglars. No one asked them\nfor interest on the money thus deposited, nor did they give any;\nbut, on the other hand, if any of their customers, on whose\ncharacter they could depend, wanted a little advance, the Fosters,\nafter due inquiries made, and in some cases due security given, were\nnot unwilling to lend a moderate sum without charging a penny for\nthe use of their money. All the articles they sold were as good as\nthey knew how to choose, and for them they expected and obtained\nready money. It was said that they only kept on the shop for their\namusement. Others averred that there was some plan of a marriage\nrunning in the brothers' heads--a marriage between William Coulson,\nMr. Jeremiah's wife's nephew (Mr. Jeremiah was a widower), and Hester\nRose, whose mother was some kind of distant relation, and who served\nin the shop along with William Coulson and Philip Hepburn. Again,\nthis was denied by those who averred that Coulson was no blood\nrelation, and that if the Fosters had intended to do anything\nconsiderable for Hester, they would never have allowed her and her\nmother to live in such a sparing way, ekeing out their small income\nby having Coulson and Hepburn for lodgers. No; John and Jeremiah\nwould leave all their money to some hospital or to some charitable\ninstitution. But, of course, there was a reply to this; when are\nthere not many sides to an argument about a possibility concerning\nwhich no facts are known? Part of the reply turned on this: the old\ngentlemen had, probably, some deep plan in their heads in permitting\ntheir cousin to take Coulson and Hepburn as lodgers, the one a kind\nof nephew, the other, though so young, the head man in the shop; if\neither of them took a fancy to Hester, how agreeably matters could\nbe arranged!\n\nAll this time Hester is patiently waiting to serve Sylvia, who is\nstanding before her a little shy, a little perplexed and distracted,\nby the sight of so many pretty things.\n\nHester was a tall young woman, sparely yet largely formed, of a\ngrave aspect, which made her look older than she really was. Her\nthick brown hair was smoothly taken off her broad forehead, and put\nin a very orderly fashion, under her linen cap; her face was a\nlittle square, and her complexion sallow, though the texture of her\nskin was fine. Her gray eyes were very pleasant, because they looked\nat you so honestly and kindly; her mouth was slightly compressed, as\nmost have it who are in the habit of restraining their feelings; but\nwhen she spoke you did not perceive this, and her rare smile slowly\nbreaking forth showed her white even teeth, and when accompanied, as\nit generally was, by a sudden uplifting of her soft eyes, it made\nher countenance very winning. She was dressed in stuff of sober\ncolours, both in accordance with her own taste, and in unasked\ncompliance with the religious customs of the Fosters; but Hester\nherself was not a Friend.\n\nSylvia, standing opposite, not looking at Hester, but gazing at the\nribbons in the shop window, as if hardly conscious that any one\nawaited the expression of her wishes, was a great contrast; ready to\nsmile or to pout, or to show her feelings in any way, with a\ncharacter as undeveloped as a child's, affectionate, wilful,\nnaughty, tiresome, charming, anything, in fact, at present that the\nchances of an hour called out. Hester thought her customer the\nprettiest creature ever seen, in the moment she had for admiration\nbefore Sylvia turned round and, recalled to herself, began,--\n\n'Oh, I beg your pardon, miss; I was thinking what may the price of\nyon crimson ribbon be?'\n\nHester said nothing, but went to examine the shop-mark.\n\n'Oh! I did not mean that I wanted any, I only want some stuff for a\ncloak. Thank you, miss, but I am very sorry--some duffle, please.'\n\nHester silently replaced the ribbon and went in search of the\nduffle. While she was gone Sylvia was addressed by the very person\nshe most wished to avoid, and whose absence she had rejoiced over on\nfirst entering the shop, her cousin Philip Hepburn.\n\nHe was a serious-looking young man, tall, but with a slight stoop in\nhis shoulders, brought on by his occupation. He had thick hair\nstanding off from his forehead in a peculiar but not unpleasing\nmanner; a long face, with a slightly aquiline nose, dark eyes, and a\nlong upper lip, which gave a disagreeable aspect to a face that\nmight otherwise have been good-looking.\n\n'Good day, Sylvie,' he said; 'what are you wanting? How are all at\nhome? Let me help you!'\n\nSylvia pursed up her red lips, and did not look at him as she\nreplied,\n\n'I'm very well, and so is mother; feyther's got a touch of\nrheumatiz, and there's a young woman getting what I want.'\n\nShe turned a little away from him when she had ended this sentence,\nas if it had comprised all she could possibly have to say to him.\nBut he exclaimed,\n\n'You won't know how to choose,' and, seating himself on the counter,\nhe swung himself over after the fashion of shop-men.\n\nSylvia took no notice of him, but pretended to be counting over her\nmoney.\n\n'What do you want, Sylvie?' asked he, at last annoyed at her\nsilence.\n\n'I don't like to be called \"Sylvie;\" my name is Sylvia; and I'm\nwanting duffle for a cloak, if you must know.'\n\nHester now returned, with a shop-boy helping her to drag along the\ngreat rolls of scarlet and gray cloth.\n\n'Not that,' said Philip, kicking the red duffle with his foot, and\nspeaking to the lad. 'It's the gray you want, is it not, Sylvie?' He\nused the name he had had the cousin's right to call her by since her\nchildhood, without remembering her words on the subject not five\nminutes before; but she did, and was vexed.\n\n'Please, miss, it is the scarlet duffle I want; don't let him take\nit away.'\n\nHester looked up at both their countenances, a little wondering what\nwas their position with regard to each other; for this, then, was\nthe beautiful little cousin about whom Philip had talked to her\nmother, as sadly spoilt, and shamefully ignorant; a lovely little\ndunce, and so forth. Hester had pictured Sylvia Robson, somehow, as\nvery different from what she was: younger, more stupid, not half so\nbright and charming (for, though she was now both pouting and cross,\nit was evident that this was not her accustomed mood). Sylvia\ndevoted her attention to the red cloth, pushing aside the gray.\n\nPhilip Hepburn was vexed at his advice being slighted; and yet he\nurged it afresh.\n\n'This is a respectable, quiet-looking article that will go well with\nany colour; you niver will be so foolish as to take what will mark\nwith every drop of rain.'\n\n'I'm sorry you sell such good-for-nothing things,' replied Sylvia,\nconscious of her advantage, and relaxing a little (as little as she\npossibly could) of her gravity.\n\nHester came in now.\n\n'He means to say that this cloth will lose its first brightness in\nwet or damp; but it will always be a good article, and the colour\nwill stand a deal of wear. Mr. Foster would not have had it in his\nshop else.'\n\nPhilip did not like that even a reasonable peace-making interpreter\nshould come between him and Sylvia, so he held his tongue in\nindignant silence.\n\nHester went on:\n\n'To be sure, this gray is the closer make, and would wear the\nlongest.'\n\n'I don't care,' said Sylvia, still rejecting the dull gray. 'I like\nthis best. Eight yards, if you please, miss.'\n\n'A cloak takes nine yards, at least,' said Philip, decisively.\n\n'Mother told me eight,' said Sylvia, secretly conscious that her\nmother would have preferred the more sober colour; and feeling that\nas she had had her own way in that respect, she was bound to keep to\nthe directions she had received as to the quantity. But, indeed, she\nwould not have yielded to Philip in anything that she could help.\n\nThere was a sound of children's feet running up the street from the\nriver-side, shouting with excitement. At the noise, Sylvia forgot\nher cloak and her little spirit of vexation, and ran to the\nhalf-door of the shop. Philip followed because she went. Hester\nlooked on with passive, kindly interest, as soon as she had\ncompleted her duty of measuring. One of those girls whom Sylvia had\nseen as she and Molly left the crowd on the quay, came quickly up\nthe street. Her face, which was handsome enough as to feature, was\nwhitened with excess of passionate emotion, her dress untidy and\nflying, her movements heavy and free. She belonged to the lowest\nclass of seaport inhabitants. As she came near, Sylvia saw that the\ntears were streaming down her cheeks, quite unconsciously to\nherself. She recognized Sylvia's face, full of interest as it was,\nand stopped her clumsy run to speak to the pretty, sympathetic\ncreature.\n\n'She's o'er t' bar! She's o'er t' bar! I'm boun' to tell mother!'\n\nShe caught at Sylvia's hand, and shook it, and went on breathless\nand gasping.\n\n'Sylvia, how came you to know that girl?' asked Philip, sternly.\n'She's not one for you to be shaking hands with. She's known all\ndown t' quay-side as \"Newcastle Bess.\"'\n\n'I can't help it,' said Sylvia, half inclined to cry at his manner\neven more than his words. 'When folk are glad I can't help being\nglad too, and I just put out my hand, and she put out hers. To think\no' yon ship come in at last! And if yo'd been down seeing all t'\nfolk looking and looking their eyes out, as if they feared they\nshould die afore she came in and brought home the lads they loved,\nyo'd ha' shaken hands wi' that lass too, and no great harm done. I\nnever set eyne upon her till half an hour ago on th' staithes, and\nmaybe I'll niver see her again.'\n\nHester was still behind the counter, but had moved so as to be near\nthe window; so she heard what they were saying, and now put in her\nword:\n\n'She can't be altogether bad, for she thought o' telling her mother\nfirst thing, according to what she said.'\n\nSylvia gave Hester a quick, grateful look. But Hester had resumed\nher gaze out of the window, and did not see the glance.\n\nAnd now Molly Corney joined them, hastily bursting into the shop.\n\n'Hech!' said she. 'Hearken! how they're crying and shouting down on\nt' quay. T' gang's among 'em like t' day of judgment. Hark!'\n\nNo one spoke, no one breathed, I had almost said no heart beat for\nlistening. Not long; in an instant there rose the sharp simultaneous\ncry of many people in rage and despair. Inarticulate at that\ndistance, it was yet an intelligible curse, and the roll, and the\nroar, and the irregular tramp came nearer and nearer.\n\n'They're taking 'em to t' Randyvowse,' said Molly. 'Eh! I wish I'd\nKing George here just to tell him my mind.'\n\nThe girl clenched her hands, and set her teeth.\n\n'It's terrible hard!' said Hester; 'there's mothers, and wives,\nlooking out for 'em, as if they were stars dropt out o' t' lift.'\n\n'But can we do nothing for 'em?' cried Sylvia. 'Let us go into t'\nthick of it and do a bit of help; I can't stand quiet and see 't!'\nHalf crying, she pushed forwards to the door; but Philip held her\nback.\n\n'Sylvie! you must not. Don't be silly; it's the law, and no one can\ndo aught against it, least of all women and lasses.\n\nBy this time the vanguard of the crowd came pressing up Bridge\nStreet, past the windows of Foster's shop. It consisted of wild,\nhalf-amphibious boys, slowly moving backwards, as they were\ncompelled by the pressure of the coming multitude to go on, and yet\nanxious to defy and annoy the gang by insults, and curses half\nchoked with their indignant passion, doubling their fists in the\nvery faces of the gang who came on with measured movement, armed to\nthe teeth, their faces showing white with repressed and determined\nenergy against the bronzed countenances of the half-dozen sailors,\nwho were all they had thought it wise to pick out of the whaler's\ncrew, this being the first time an Admiralty warrant had been used\nin Monkshaven for many years; not since the close of the American\nwar, in fact. One of the men was addressing to his townspeople, in a\nhigh pitched voice, an exhortation which few could hear, for,\npressing around this nucleus of cruel wrong, were women crying\naloud, throwing up their arms in imprecation, showering down abuse\nas hearty and rapid as if they had been a Greek chorus. Their wild,\nfamished eyes were strained on faces they might not kiss, their\ncheeks were flushed to purple with anger or else livid with impotent\ncraving for revenge. Some of them looked scarce human; and yet an\nhour ago these lips, now tightly drawn back so as to show the teeth\nwith the unconscious action of an enraged wild animal, had been soft\nand gracious with the smile of hope; eyes, that were fiery and\nbloodshot now, had been loving and bright; hearts, never to recover\nfrom the sense of injustice and cruelty, had been trustful and glad\nonly one short hour ago.\n\nThere were men there, too, sullen and silent, brooding on remedial\nrevenge; but not many, the greater proportion of this class being\naway in the absent whalers.\n\nThe stormy multitude swelled into the market-place and formed a\nsolid crowd there, while the press-gang steadily forced their way on\ninto High Street, and on to the rendezvous. A low, deep growl went\nup from the dense mass, as some had to wait for space to follow the\nothers--now and then going up, as a lion's growl goes up, into a\nshriek of rage.\n\nA woman forced her way up from the bridge. She lived some little way\nin the country, and had been late in hearing of the return of the\nwhaler after her six months' absence; and on rushing down to the\nquay-side, she had been told by a score of busy, sympathizing\nvoices, that her husband was kidnapped for the service of the\nGovernment.\n\nShe had need pause in the market-place, the outlet of which was\ncrammed up. Then she gave tongue for the first time in such a\nfearful shriek, you could hardly catch the words she said.\n\n'Jamie! Jamie! will they not let you to me?'\n\nThose were the last words Sylvia heard before her own hysterical\nburst of tears called every one's attention to her.\n\nShe had been very busy about household work in the morning, and much\nagitated by all she had seen and heard since coming into Monkshaven;\nand so it ended in this.\n\nMolly and Hester took her through the shop into the parlour\nbeyond--John Foster's parlour, for Jeremiah, the elder brother,\nlived in a house of his own on the other side of the water. It was a\nlow, comfortable room, with great beams running across the ceiling,\nand papered with the same paper as the walls--a piece of elegant\nluxury which took Molly's fancy mightily! This parlour looked out on\nthe dark courtyard in which there grew two or three poplars,\nstraining upwards to the light; and through an open door between the\nbacks of two houses could be seen a glimpse of the dancing, heaving\nriver, with such ships or fishing cobles as happened to be moored in\nthe waters above the bridge.\n\nThey placed Sylvia on the broad, old-fashioned sofa, and gave her\nwater to drink, and tried to still her sobbing and choking. They\nloosed her hat, and copiously splashed her face and clustering\nchestnut hair, till at length she came to herself; restored, but\ndripping wet. She sate up and looked at them, smoothing back her\ntangled curls off her brow, as if to clear both her eyes and her\nintellect.\n\n'Where am I?--oh, I know! Thank you. It was very silly, but somehow\nit seemed so sad!'\n\nAnd here she was nearly going off again, but Hester said--\n\n'Ay, it were sad, my poor lass--if I may call you so, for I don't\nrightly know your name--but it's best not think on it for we can do\nno mak' o' good, and it'll mebbe set you off again. Yo're Philip\nHepburn's cousin, I reckon, and yo' bide at Haytersbank Farm?'\n\n'Yes; she's Sylvia Robson,' put in Molly, not seeing that Hester's\npurpose was to make Sylvia speak, and so to divert her attention\nfrom the subject which had set her off into hysterics. 'And we came\nin for market,' continued Molly, 'and for t' buy t' new cloak as her\nfeyther's going to give her; and, for sure, I thought we was i'\nluck's way when we saw t' first whaler, and niver dreaming as t'\npress-gang 'ud be so marred.'\n\nShe, too, began to cry, but her little whimper was stopped by the\nsound of the opening door behind her. It was Philip, asking Hester\nby a silent gesture if he might come in.\n\nSylvia turned her face round from the light, and shut her eyes. Her\ncousin came close up to her on tip-toe, and looked anxiously at what\nhe could see of her averted face; then he passed his hand so\nslightly over her hair that he could scarcely be said to touch it,\nand murmured--\n\n'Poor lassie! it's a pity she came to-day, for it's a long walk in\nthis heat!'\n\nBut Sylvia started to her feet, almost pushing him along. Her\nquickened senses heard an approaching step through the courtyard\nbefore any of the others were aware of the sound. In a minute\nafterwards, the glass-door at one corner of the parlour was opened\nfrom the outside, and Mr. John stood looking in with some surprise at\nthe group collected in his usually empty parlour.\n\n'It's my cousin,' said Philip, reddening a little; 'she came wi' her\nfriend in to market, and to make purchases; and she's got a turn wi'\nseeing the press-gang go past carrying some of the crew of the\nwhaler to the Randyvowse.\n\n'Ay, ay,' said Mr. John, quickly passing on into the shop on tip-toe,\nas if he were afraid he were intruding in his own premises, and\nbeckoning Philip to follow him there. 'Out of strife cometh strife.\nI guessed something of the sort was up from what I heard on t'\nbridge as I came across fra' brother Jeremiah's.' Here he softly\nshut the door between the parlour and the shop. 'It beareth hard on\nth' expectant women and childer; nor is it to be wondered at that\nthey, being unconverted, rage together (poor creatures!) like the\nvery heathen. Philip,' he said, coming nearer to his 'head young\nman,' 'keep Nicholas and Henry at work in the ware-room upstairs\nuntil this riot be over, for it would grieve me if they were misled\ninto violence.'\n\nPhilip hesitated.\n\n'Speak out, man! Always ease an uneasy heart, and never let it get\nhidebound.'\n\n'I had thought to convoy my cousin and the other young woman home,\nfor the town is like to be rough, and it's getting dark.'\n\n'And thou shalt, my lad,' said the good old man; 'and I myself will\ntry and restrain the natural inclinations of Nicholas and Henry.'\n\nBut when he went to find the shop-boys with a gentle homily on his\nlips, those to whom it should have been addressed were absent. In\nconsequence of the riotous state of things, all the other shops in\nthe market-place had put their shutters up; and Nicholas and Henry,\nin the absence of their superiors, had followed the example of their\nneighbours, and, as business was over, they had hardly waited to put\nthe goods away, but had hurried off to help their townsmen in any\nstruggle that might ensue.\n\nThere was no remedy for it, but Mr. John looked rather discomfited.\nThe state of the counters, and of the disarranged goods, was such\nalso as would have irritated any man as orderly but less\nsweet-tempered. All he said on the subject was: 'The old Adam! the\nold Adam!' but he shook his head long after he had finished\nspeaking.\n\n'Where is William Coulson?' he next asked. 'Oh! I remember. He was\nnot to come back from York till the night closed in.'\n\nPhilip and his master arranged the shop in the exact order the old\nman loved. Then he recollected the wish of his subordinate, and\nturned round and said--\n\n'Now go with thy cousin and her friend. Hester is here, and old\nHannah. I myself will take Hester home, if need be. But for the\npresent I think she had best tarry here, as it isn't many steps to\nher mother's house, and we may need her help if any of those poor\ncreatures fall into suffering wi' their violence.'\n\nWith this, Mr. John knocked at the door of the parlour, and waited\nfor permission to enter. With old-fashioned courtesy he told the two\nstrangers how glad he was that his room had been of service to them;\nthat he would never have made so bold as to pass through it, if he\nhad been aware how it was occupied. And then going to a corner\ncupboard, high up in the wall, he pulled a key out of his pocket and\nunlocked his little store of wine, and cake, and spirits; and\ninsisted that they should eat and drink while waiting for Philip,\nwho was taking some last measures for the security of the shop\nduring the night.\n\nSylvia declined everything, with less courtesy than she ought to\nhave shown to the offers of the hospitable old man. Molly took wine\nand cake, leaving a good half of both, according to the code of\nmanners in that part of the country; and also because Sylvia was\ncontinually urging her to make haste. For the latter disliked the\nidea of her cousin's esteeming it necessary to accompany them home,\nand wanted to escape from him by setting off before he returned. But\nany such plans were frustrated by Philip's coming back into the\nparlour, full of grave content, which brimmed over from his eyes,\nwith the parcel of Sylvia's obnoxious red duffle under his arm;\nanticipating so keenly the pleasure awaiting him in the walk, that\nhe was almost surprised by the gravity of his companions as they\nprepared for it. Sylvia was a little penitent for her rejection of\nMr. John's hospitality, now she found out how unavailing for its\npurpose such rejection had been, and tried to make up by a modest\nsweetness of farewell, which quite won his heart, and made him\npraise her up to Hester in a way to which she, observant of all,\ncould not bring herself fully to respond. What business had the\npretty little creature to reject kindly-meant hospitality in the\npettish way she did, thought Hester. And, oh! what business had she\nto be so ungrateful and to try and thwart Philip in his thoughtful\nwish of escorting them through the streets of the rough, riotous\ntown? What did it all mean?\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\nPHILIP HEPBURN\n\n\nThe coast on that part of the island to which this story refers is\nbordered by rocks and cliffs. The inland country immediately\nadjacent to the coast is level, flat, and bleak; it is only where\nthe long stretch of dyke-enclosed fields terminates abruptly in a\nsheer descent, and the stranger sees the ocean creeping up the sands\nfar below him, that he is aware on how great an elevation he has\nbeen. Here and there, as I have said, a cleft in the level land\n(thus running out into the sea in steep promontories) occurs--what\nthey would call a 'chine' in the Isle of Wight; but instead of the\nsoft south wind stealing up the woody ravine, as it does there, the\neastern breeze comes piping shrill and clear along these northern\nchasms, keeping the trees that venture to grow on the sides down to\nthe mere height of scrubby brushwood. The descent to the shore\nthrough these 'bottoms' is in most cases very abrupt, too much so\nfor a cartway, or even a bridle-path; but people can pass up and\ndown without difficulty, by the help of a few rude steps hewn here\nand there out of the rock.\n\nSixty or seventy years ago (not to speak of much later times) the\nfarmers who owned or hired the land which lay directly on the summit\nof these cliffs were smugglers to the extent of their power, only\npartially checked by the coast-guard distributed, at pretty nearly\nequal interspaces of eight miles, all along the north-eastern\nseaboard. Still sea-wrack was a good manure, and there was no law\nagainst carrying it up in great osier baskets for the purpose of\ntillage, and many a secret thing was lodged in hidden crevices in\nthe rocks till the farmer sent trusty people down to the shore for a\ngood supply of sand and seaweed for his land.\n\nOne of the farms on the cliff had lately been taken by Sylvia's\nfather. He was a man who had roamed about a good deal--been sailor,\nsmuggler, horse-dealer, and farmer in turns; a sort of fellow\npossessed by a spirit of adventure and love of change, which did him\nand his own family more harm than anybody else. He was just the kind\nof man that all his neighbours found fault with, and all his\nneighbours liked. Late in life (for such an imprudent man as he, was\none of a class who generally wed, trusting to chance and luck for\nthe provision for a family), farmer Robson married a woman whose\nonly want of practical wisdom consisted in taking him for a husband.\nShe was Philip Hepburn's aunt, and had had the charge of him until\nshe married from her widowed brother's house. He it was who had let\nher know when Haytersbank Farm had been to let; esteeming it a\nlikely piece of land for his uncle to settle down upon, after a\nsomewhat unprosperous career of horse-dealing. The farmhouse lay in\nthe shelter of a very slight green hollow scarcely scooped out of\nthe pasture field by which it was surrounded; the short crisp turf\ncame creeping up to the very door and windows, without any attempt\nat a yard or garden, or any nearer enclosure of the buildings than\nthe stone dyke that formed the boundary of the field itself. The\nbuildings were long and low, in order to avoid the rough violence of\nthe winds that swept over that wild, bleak spot, both in winter and\nsummer. It was well for the inhabitants of that house that coal was\nextremely cheap; otherwise a southerner might have imagined that\nthey could never have survived the cutting of the bitter gales that\npiped all round, and seemed to seek out every crevice for admission\ninto the house.\n\nBut the interior was warm enough when once you had mounted the long\nbleak lane, full of round rough stones, enough to lame any horse\nunaccustomed to such roads, and had crossed the field by the little\ndry, hard footpath, which tacked about so as to keep from directly\nfacing the prevailing wind. Mrs. Robson was a Cumberland woman, and\nas such, was a cleaner housewife than the farmers' wives of that\nnorth-eastern coast, and was often shocked at their ways, showing it\nmore by her looks than by her words, for she was not a great talker.\nThis fastidiousness in such matters made her own house extremely\ncomfortable, but did not tend to render her popular among her\nneighbours. Indeed, Bell Robson piqued herself on her housekeeping\ngenerally, and once in-doors in the gray, bare stone house, there\nwere plenty of comforts to be had besides cleanliness and warmth.\nThe great rack of clap-bread hung overhead, and Bell Robson's\npreference of this kind of oat-cake over the leavened and partly\nsour kind used in Yorkshire was another source of her unpopularity.\nFlitches of bacon and 'hands' (_i.e._, shoulders of cured pork, the\nlegs or hams being sold, as fetching a better price) abounded; and\nfor any visitor who could stay, neither cream nor finest wheaten\nflour was wanting for 'turf cakes' and 'singing hinnies,' with which\nit is the delight of the northern housewives to regale the honoured\nguest, as he sips their high-priced tea, sweetened with dainty\nsugar.\n\nThis night farmer Robson was fidgeting in and out of his house-door,\nclimbing the little eminence in the field, and coming down\ndisappointed in a state of fretful impatience. His quiet, taciturn\nwife was a little put out by Sylvia's non-appearance too; but she\nshowed her anxiety by being shorter than usual in her replies to his\nperpetual wonders as to where the lass could have been tarrying, and\nby knitting away with extra diligence.\n\n'I've a vast o' mind to go down to Monkshaven mysen, and see after\nt' child. It's well on for seven.'\n\n'No, Dannel,' said his wife; 'thou'd best not. Thy leg has been\npaining thee this week past, and thou'rt not up to such a walk. I'll\nrouse Kester, and send him off, if thou think'st there's need on\nit.'\n\n'A'll noan ha' Kester roused. Who's to go afield betimes after t'\nsheep in t' morn, if he's ca'ed up to-neet? He'd miss t' lass, and\nfind a public-house, a reckon,' said Daniel, querulously.\n\n'I'm not afeard o' Kester,' replied Bell. 'He's a good one for\nknowing folk i' th' dark. But if thou'd rather, I'll put on my hood\nand cloak and just go to th' end o' th' lane, if thou'lt have an eye\nto th' milk, and see as it does na' boil o'er, for she canna stomach\nit if it's bishopped e'er so little.'\n\nBefore Mrs. Robson, however, had put away her knitting, voices were\nheard at a good distance down the lane, but coming nearer every\nmoment, and once more Daniel climbed the little brow to look and to\nlisten.\n\n'It's a' reet!' said he, hobbling quickly down. 'Niver fidget\ntheesel' wi' gettin' ready to go search for her. I'll tak' thee a\nbet it's Philip Hepburn's voice, convoying her home, just as I said\nhe would, an hour sin'.'\n\nBell did not answer, as she might have done, that this probability\nof Philip's bringing Sylvia home had been her own suggestion, set\naside by her husband as utterly unlikely. Another minute and the\ncountenances of both parents imperceptibly and unconsciously relaxed\ninto pleasure as Sylvia came in.\n\nShe looked very rosy from the walk, and the October air, which began\nto be frosty in the evenings; there was a little cloud over her face\nat first, but it was quickly dispersed as she met the loving eyes of\nhome. Philip, who followed her, had an excited, but not altogether\npleased look about him. He received a hearty greeting from Daniel,\nand a quiet one from his aunt.\n\n'Tak' off thy pan o' milk, missus, and set on t' kettle. Milk may do\nfor wenches, but Philip and me is for a drop o' good Hollands and\nwatter this cold night. I'm a'most chilled to t' marrow wi' looking\nout for thee, lass, for t' mother was in a peck o' troubles about\nthy none coining home i' t' dayleet, and I'd to keep hearkening out\non t' browhead.'\n\nThis was entirely untrue, and Bell knew it to be so; but her husband\ndid not. He had persuaded himself now, as he had done often before,\nthat what he had in reality done for his own pleasure or\nsatisfaction, he had done in order to gratify some one else.\n\n'The town was rough with a riot between the press-gang and the\nwhaling folk; and I thought I'd best see Sylvia home.'\n\n'Ay, ay, lad; always welcome, if it's only as an excuse for t'\nliquor. But t' whalers, say'st ta? Why, is t' whalers in? There was\nnone i' sight yesterday, when I were down on t' shore. It's early\ndays for 'em as yet. And t' cursed old press-gang's agate again,\ndoing its devil's work!'\n\nHis face changed as he ended his speech, and showed a steady passion\nof old hatred.\n\n'Ay, missus, yo' may look. I wunnot pick and choose my words,\nnoather for yo' nor for nobody, when I speak o' that daumed gang.\nI'm none ashamed o' my words. They're true, and I'm ready to prove\n'em. Where's my forefinger? Ay! and as good a top-joint of a thumb\nas iver a man had? I wish I'd kept 'em i' sperits, as they done\nthings at t' 'potticary's, just to show t' lass what flesh and bone\nI made away wi' to get free. I ups wi' a hatchet when I saw as I\nwere fast a-board a man-o'-war standing out for sea--it were in t'\ntime o' the war wi' Amerikay, an' I could na stomach the thought o'\nbeing murdered i' my own language--so I ups wi' a hatchet, and I\nsays to Bill Watson, says I, \"Now, my lad, if thou'll do me a\nkindness, I'll pay thee back, niver fear, and they'll be glad enough\nto get shut on us, and send us to old England again. Just come down\nwith a will.\" Now, missus, why can't ye sit still and listen to me,\n'stead o' pottering after pans and what not?' said he, speaking\ncrossly to his wife, who had heard the story scores of times, and,\nit must be confessed, was making some noise in preparing bread and\nmilk for Sylvia's supper.\n\nBell did not say a word in reply, but Sylvia tapped his shoulder\nwith a pretty little authoritative air.\n\n'It's for me, feyther. I'm just keen-set for my supper. Once let me\nget quickly set down to it, and Philip there to his glass o' grog,\nand you'll never have such listeners in your life, and mother's mind\nwill be at ease too.'\n\n'Eh! thou's a wilfu' wench,' said the proud father, giving her a\ngreat slap on her back. 'Well! set thee down to thy victual, and be\nquiet wi' thee, for I want to finish my tale to Philip. But,\nperhaps, I've telled it yo' afore?' said he, turning round to\nquestion Hepburn.\n\nHepburn could not say that he had not heard it, for he piqued\nhimself on his truthfulness. But instead of frankly and directly\nowning this, he tried to frame a formal little speech, which would\nsoothe Daniel's mortified vanity; and, of course, it had the\ndirectly opposite effect. Daniel resented being treated like a\nchild, and yet turned his back on Philip with all the wilfulness of\none. Sylvia did not care for her cousin, but hated the discomfort of\nhaving her father displeased; so she took up her tale of adventure,\nand told her father and mother of her afternoon's proceedings.\nDaniel pretended not to listen at first, and made ostentatious\nnoises with his spoon and glass; but by-and-by he got quite warm and\nexcited about the doings of the press-gang, and scolded both Philip\nand Sylvia for not having learnt more particulars as to what was the\ntermination of the riot.\n\n'I've been whaling mysel',' said he; 'and I've heerd tell as whalers\nwear knives, and I'd ha' gi'en t' gang a taste o' my whittle, if I'd\nbeen cotched up just as I'd set my foot a-shore.'\n\n'I don't know,' said Philip; 'we're at war wi' the French, and we\nshouldn't like to be beaten; and yet if our numbers are not equal to\ntheirs, we stand a strong chance of it.'\n\n'Not a bit on't--so be d--d!' said Daniel Robson, bringing down his\nfist with such violence on the round deal table, that the glasses\nand earthenware shook again. 'Yo'd not strike a child or a woman,\nfor sure! yet it 'ud be like it, if we did na' give the Frenchies\nsome 'vantages--if we took 'em wi' equal numbers. It's not fair\nplay, and that's one place where t' shoe pinches. It's not fair play\ntwo ways. It's not fair play to cotch up men as has no call for\nfightin' at another man's biddin', though they've no objection to\nfight a bit on their own account and who are just landed, all keen\nafter bread i'stead o' biscuit, and flesh-meat i'stead o' junk, and\nbeds i'stead o' hammocks. (I make naught o' t' sentiment side, for I\nwere niver gi'en up to such carnal-mindedness and poesies.) It's\nnoane fair to cotch 'em up and put 'em in a stifling hole, all lined\nwith metal for fear they should whittle their way out, and send 'em\noff to sea for years an' years to come. And again it's no fair play\nto t' French. Four o' them is rightly matched wi' one o' us; and if\nwe go an' fight 'em four to four it's like as if yo' fell to beatin'\nSylvie there, or little Billy Croxton, as isn't breeched. And that's\nmy mind. Missus, where's t' pipe?'\n\nPhilip did not smoke, so took his turn at talking, a chance he\nseldom had with Daniel, unless the latter had his pipe between his\nlips. So after Daniel had filled it, and used Sylvia's little finger\nas a stopper to ram down the tobacco--a habit of his to which she\nwas so accustomed that she laid her hand on the table by him, as\nnaturally as she would have fetched him his spittoon when he began\nto smoke--Philip arranged his arguments, and began--\n\n'I'm for fair play wi' the French as much as any man, as long as we\ncan be sure o' beating them; but, I say, make sure o' that, and then\ngive them ivery advantage. Now I reckon Government is not sure as\nyet, for i' the papers it said as half th' ships i' th' Channel\nhadn't got their proper complement o' men; and all as I say is, let\nGovernment judge a bit for us; and if they say they're hampered for\nwant o' men, why we must make it up somehow. John and Jeremiah\nFoster pay in taxes, and Militiaman pays in person; and if sailors\ncannot pay in taxes, and will not pay in person, why they must be\nmade to pay; and that's what th' press-gang is for, I reckon. For my\npart, when I read o' the way those French chaps are going on, I'm\nthankful to be governed by King George and a British Constitution.'\n\nDaniel took his pipe out of his mouth at this.\n\n'And when did I say a word again King George and the Constitution? I\nonly ax 'em to govern me as I judge best, and that's what I call\nrepresentation. When I gived my vote to Measter Cholmley to go up to\nt' Parliament House, I as good as said, 'Now yo' go up theer, sir,\nand tell 'em what I, Dannel Robson, think right, and what I, Dannel\nRobson, wish to have done.' Else I'd be darned if I'd ha' gi'en my\nvote to him or any other man. And div yo' think I want Seth Robson (\nas is my own brother's son, and mate to a collier) to be cotched up\nby a press-gang, and ten to one his wages all unpaid? Div yo' think\nI'd send up Measter Cholmley to speak up for that piece o' work? Not\nI.' He took up his pipe again, shook out the ashes, puffed it into a\nspark, and shut his eyes, preparatory to listening.\n\n'But, asking pardon, laws is made for the good of the nation, not\nfor your good or mine.'\n\nDaniel could not stand this. He laid down his pipe, opened his eyes,\nstared straight at Philip before speaking, in order to enforce his\nwords, and then said slowly--\n\n'Nation here! nation theere! I'm a man and yo're another, but\nnation's nowheere. If Measter Cholmley talked to me i' that fashion,\nhe'd look long for another vote frae me. I can make out King George,\nand Measter Pitt, and yo' and me, but nation! nation, go hang!'\n\nPhilip, who sometimes pursued an argument longer than was politic\nfor himself, especially when he felt sure of being on the conquering\nside, did not see that Daniel Robson was passing out of the\nindifference of conscious wisdom into that state of anger which\nensues when a question becomes personal in some unspoken way. Robson\nhad contested this subject once or twice before, and had the\nremembrance of former disputes to add to his present vehemence. So\nit was well for the harmony of the evening that Bell and Sylvia\nreturned from the kitchen to sit in the house-place. They had been\nto wash up the pans and basins used for supper; Sylvia had privately\nshown off her cloak, and got over her mother's shake of the head at\nits colour with a coaxing kiss, at the end of which her mother had\nadjusted her cap with a 'There! there! ha' done wi' thee,' but had\nno more heart to show her disapprobation; and now they came back to\ntheir usual occupations until it should please their visitor to go;\nthen they would rake the fire and be off to bed; for neither\nSylvia's spinning nor Bell's knitting was worth candle-light, and\nmorning hours are precious in a dairy.\n\nPeople speak of the way in which harp-playing sets off a graceful\nfigure; spinning is almost as becoming an employment. A woman stands\nat the great wool-wheel, one arm extended, the other holding the\nthread, her head thrown back to take in all the scope of her\noccupation; or if it is the lesser spinning-wheel for flax--and it\nwas this that Sylvia moved forwards to-night--the pretty sound of\nthe buzzing, whirring motion, the attitude of the spinner, foot and\nhand alike engaged in the business--the bunch of gay coloured\nribbon that ties the bundle of flax on the rock--all make it into a\npicturesque piece of domestic business that may rival harp-playing\nany day for the amount of softness and grace which it calls out.\n\nSylvia's cheeks were rather flushed by the warmth of the room after\nthe frosty air. The blue ribbon with which she had thought it\nnecessary to tie back her hair before putting on her hat to go to\nmarket had got rather loose, and allowed her disarranged curls to\nstray in a manner which would have annoyed her extremely, if she had\nbeen upstairs to look at herself in the glass; but although they\nwere not set in the exact fashion which Sylvia esteemed as correct,\nthey looked very pretty and luxuriant. Her little foot, placed on\nthe 'traddle', was still encased in its smartly buckled shoe--not\nslightly to her discomfort, as she was unaccustomed to be shod in\nwalking far; only as Philip had accompanied them home, neither she\nnor Molly had liked to go barefoot. Her round mottled arm and ruddy\ntaper hand drew out the flax with nimble, agile motion, keeping time\nto the movement of the wheel. All this Philip could see; the greater\npart of her face was lost to him as she half averted it, with a shy\ndislike to the way in which she knew from past experience that\ncousin Philip always stared at her. And avert it as she would she\nheard with silent petulance the harsh screech of Philip's chair as\nhe heavily dragged it on the stone floor, sitting on it all the\nwhile, and felt that he was moving round so as to look at her as\nmuch as was in his power, without absolutely turning his back on\neither her father or mother. She got herself ready for the first\nopportunity of contradiction or opposition.\n\n'Well, wench! and has ta bought this grand new cloak?'\n\n'Yes, feyther. It's a scarlet one.'\n\n'Ay, ay! and what does mother say?'\n\n'Oh, mother's content,' said Sylvia, a little doubting in her heart,\nbut determined to defy Philip at all hazards.\n\n'Mother 'll put up with it if it does na spot would be nearer fact,\nI'm thinking,' said Bell, quietly.\n\n'I wanted Sylvia to take the gray,' said Philip.\n\n'And I chose the red; it's so much gayer, and folk can see me the\nfarther off. Feyther likes to see me at first turn o' t' lane, don't\nyo', feyther? and I'll niver turn out when it's boun' for to rain,\nso it shall niver get a spot near it, mammy.'\n\n'I reckoned it were to wear i' bad weather,' said Bell. 'Leastways\nthat were the pretext for coaxing feyther out o' it.'\n\nShe said it in a kindly tone, though the words became a prudent\nrather than a fond mother. But Sylvia understood her better than\nDaniel did as it appeared.\n\n'Hou'd thy tongue, mother. She niver spoke a pretext at all.'\n\nHe did not rightly know what a 'pretext' was: Bell was a touch\nbetter educated than her husband, but he did not acknowledge this,\nand made a particular point of differing from her whenever she used\na word beyond his comprehension.\n\n'She's a good lass at times; and if she liked to wear a\nyellow-orange cloak she should have it. Here's Philip here, as\nstands up for laws and press-gangs, I'll set him to find us a law\nagain pleasing our lass; and she our only one. Thou dostn't think on\nthat, mother!\n\nBell did think of that often; oftener than her husband, perhaps, for\nshe remembered every day, and many times a day, the little one that\nhad been born and had died while its father was away on some long\nvoyage. But it was not her way to make replies.\n\nSylvia, who had more insight into her mother's heart than Daniel,\nbroke in with a new subject.\n\n'Oh! as for Philip, he's been preaching up laws all t' way home. I\nsaid naught, but let Molly hold her own; or else I could ha' told a\ntale about silks an' lace an' things.'\n\nPhilip's face flushed. Not because of the smuggling; every one did\nthat, only it was considered polite to ignore it; but he was annoyed\nto perceive how quickly his little cousin had discovered that his\npractice did not agree with his preaching, and vexed, too, to see\nhow delighted she was to bring out the fact. He had some little\nidea, too, that his uncle might make use of his practice as an\nargument against the preaching he had lately been indulging in, in\nopposition to Daniel; but Daniel was too far gone in his\nHollands-and-water to do more than enunciate his own opinions, which\nhe did with hesitating and laboured distinctness in the following\nsentence:\n\n'What I think and say is this. Laws is made for to keep some folks\nfra' harming others. Press-gangs and coast-guards harm me i' my\nbusiness, and keep me fra' getting what I want. Theerefore, what I\nthink and say is this: Measter Cholmley should put down press-gangs\nand coast-guards. If that theere isn't reason I ax yo' to tell me\nwhat is? an' if Measter Cholmley don't do what I ax him, he may go\nwhistle for my vote, he may.'\n\nAt this period in his conversation, Bell Robson interfered; not in\nthe least from any feeling of disgust or annoyance, or dread of what\nhe might say or do if he went on drinking, but simply as a matter of\nhealth. Sylvia, too, was in no way annoyed; not only with her\nfather, but with every man whom she knew, excepting her cousin\nPhilip, was it a matter of course to drink till their ideas became\nconfused. So she simply put her wheel aside, as preparatory to going\nto bed, when her mother said, in a more decided tone than that which\nshe had used on any other occasion but this, and similar ones--\n\n'Come, measter, you've had as much as is good for you.'\n\n'Let a' be! Let a' be,' said he, clutching at the bottle of spirits,\nbut perhaps rather more good-humoured with what he had drunk than he\nwas before; he jerked a little more into his glass before his wife\ncarried it off, and locked it up in the cupboard, putting the key in\nher pocket, and then he said, winking at Philip--\n\n'Eh! my man. Niver gie a woman t' whip hand o'er yo'! Yo' seen what\nit brings a man to; but for a' that I'll vote for Cholmley, an'\nd----t' press-gang!'\n\nHe had to shout out the last after Philip, for Hepburn, really\nanxious to please his aunt, and disliking drinking habits himself by\nconstitution, was already at the door, and setting out on his return\nhome, thinking, it must be confessed, far more of the character of\nSylvia's shake of the hand than of the parting words of either his\nuncle or aunt.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\nSTORY OF THE PRESS-GANG\n\n\nFor a few days after the evening mentioned in the last chapter the\nweather was dull. Not in quick, sudden showers did the rain come\ndown, but in constant drizzle, blotting out all colour from the\nsurrounding landscape, and filling the air with fine gray mist,\nuntil people breathed more water than air. At such times the\nconsciousness of the nearness of the vast unseen sea acted as a\ndreary depression to the spirits; but besides acting on the nerves\nof the excitable, such weather affected the sensitive or ailing in\nmaterial ways. Daniel Robson's fit of rheumatism incapacitated him\nfrom stirring abroad; and to a man of his active habits, and\nsomewhat inactive mind, this was a great hardship. He was not\nill-tempered naturally, but this state of confinement made him more\nill-tempered than he had ever been before in his life. He sat in the\nchimney-corner, abusing the weather and doubting the wisdom or\ndesirableness of all his wife saw fit to do in the usual daily\nhousehold matters. The 'chimney-corner' was really a corner at\nHaytersbank. There were two projecting walls on each side of the\nfire-place, running about six feet into the room, and a stout wooden\nsettle was placed against one of these, while opposite was the\ncircular-backed 'master's chair,' the seat of which was composed of\na square piece of wood judiciously hollowed out, and placed with one\ncorner to the front. Here, in full view of all the operations going\non over the fire, sat Daniel Robson for four live-long days,\nadvising and directing his wife in all such minor matters as the\nboiling of potatoes, the making of porridge, all the work on which\nshe specially piqued herself, and on which she would have taken\nadvice--no! not from the most skilled housewife in all the three\nRidings. But, somehow, she managed to keep her tongue quiet from\ntelling him, as she would have done any woman, and any other man, to\nmind his own business, or she would pin a dish-clout to his tail.\nShe even checked Sylvia when the latter proposed, as much for fun as\nfor anything else, that his ignorant directions should be followed,\nand the consequences brought before his eyes and his nose.\n\n'Na, na!' said Bell, 'th' feyther's feyther, and we mun respect him.\nBut it's dree work havin' a man i' th' house, nursing th' fire, an'\nsuch weather too, and not a soul coming near us, not even to fall\nout wi' him; for thee and me must na' do that, for th' Bible's sake,\ndear; and a good stand-up wordy quarrel would do him a power of\ngood; stir his blood like. I wish Philip would turn up.'\n\nBell sighed, for in these four days she had experienced somewhat of\nMadame de Maintenon's difficulty (and with fewer resources to meet\nit) of trying to amuse a man who was not amusable. For Bell, good\nand sensible as she was, was not a woman of resources. Sylvia's\nplan, undutiful as it was in her mother's eyes, would have done\nDaniel more good, even though it might have made him angry, than his\nwife's quiet, careful monotony of action, which, however it might\nconduce to her husband's comfort when he was absent, did not amuse\nhim when present.\n\nSylvia scouted the notion of cousin Philip coming into their\nhousehold in the character of an amusing or entertaining person,\ntill she nearly made her mother angry at her ridicule of the good\nsteady young fellow, to whom Bell looked up as the pattern of all\nthat early manhood should be. But the moment Sylvia saw she had been\ngiving her mother pain, she left off her wilful little jokes, and\nkissed her, and told her she would manage all famously, and ran out\nof the back-kitchen, in which mother and daughter had been scrubbing\nthe churn and all the wooden implements of butter-making. Bell\nlooked at the pretty figure of her little daughter, as, running past\nwith her apron thrown over her head, she darkened the window beneath\nwhich her mother was doing her work. She paused just for a moment,\nand then said, almost unawares to herself, 'Bless thee, lass,'\nbefore resuming her scouring of what already looked almost\nsnow-white.\n\nSylvia scampered across the rough farmyard in the wetting, drizzling\nrain to the place where she expected to find Kester; but he was not\nthere, so she had to retrace her steps to the cow-house, and, making\nher way up a rough kind of ladder-staircase fixed straight against\nthe wall, she surprised Kester as he sat in the wool-loft, looking\nover the fleeces reserved for the home-spinning, by popping her\nbright face, swathed round with her blue woollen apron, up through\nthe trap-door, and thus, her head the only visible part, she\naddressed the farm-servant, who was almost like one of the family.\n\n'Kester, feyther's just tiring hissel' wi' weariness an' vexation,\nsitting by t' fireside wi' his hands afore him, an' nought to do.\nAn' mother and me can't think on aught as 'll rouse him up to a bit\nof a laugh, or aught more cheerful than a scolding. Now, Kester,\nthou mun just be off, and find Harry Donkin th' tailor, and bring\nhim here; it's gettin' on for Martinmas, an' he'll be coming his\nrounds, and he may as well come here first as last, and feyther's\nclothes want a deal o' mending up, and Harry's always full of his\nnews, and anyhow he'll do for feyther to scold, an' be a new person\ntoo, and that's somewhat for all on us. Now go, like a good old\nKester as yo' are.'\n\nKester looked at her with loving, faithful admiration. He had set\nhimself his day's work in his master's absence, and was very\ndesirous of finishing it, but, somehow, he never dreamed of\nresisting Sylvia, so he only stated the case.\n\n'T' 'ool's a vast o' muck in 't, an' a thowt as a'd fettle it, an'\ndo it up; but a reckon a mun do yo'r biddin'.'\n\n'There's a good old Kester,' said she, smiling, and nodding her\nmuffled head at him; then she dipped down out of his sight, then\nrose up again (he had never taken his slow, mooney eyes from the\nspot where she had disappeared) to say--'Now, Kester, be wary and\ndeep--thou mun tell Harry Donkin not to let on as we've sent for\nhim, but just to come in as if he were on his round, and took us\nfirst; and he mun ask feyther if there is any work for him to do;\nand I'll answer for 't, he'll have a welcome and a half. Now, be\ndeep and fause, mind thee!'\n\n'A'se deep an' fause enow wi' simple folk; but what can a do i'\nDonkin be as fause as me--as happen he may be?'\n\n'Ga way wi' thee! I' Donkin be Solomon, thou mun be t' Queen o'\nSheba; and I'se bound for to say she outwitted him at last!'\n\nKester laughed so long at the idea of his being the Queen of Sheba,\nthat Sylvia was back by her mother's side before the cachinnation\nended.\n\nThat night, just as Sylvia was preparing to go to bed in her little\ncloset of a room, she heard some shot rattling at her window. She\nopened the little casement, and saw Kester standing below. He\nrecommenced where he left off, with a laugh--\n\n'He, he, he! A's been t' queen! A'se ta'en Donkin on t' reet side,\nan' he'll coom in to-morrow, just permiskus, an' ax for work, like\nas if 't were a favour; t' oud felley were a bit cross-grained at\nstartin', for he were workin' at farmer Crosskey's up at t' other\nside o' t' town, wheer they puts a strike an' a half of maut intil\nt' beer, when most folk put nobbut a strike, an t' made him ill to\nconvince: but he'll coom, niver fear!'\n\nThe honest fellow never said a word of the shilling he had paid out\nof his own pocket to forward Sylvia's wishes, and to persuade the\ntailor to leave the good beer. All his anxiety now was to know if he\nhad been missed, and if it was likely that a scolding awaited him in\nthe morning.\n\n'T' oud measter didn't set up his back, 'cause a didn't coom in t'\nsupper?'\n\n'He questioned a bit as to what thou were about, but mother didn't\nknow, an' I held my peace. Mother carried thy supper in t' loft for\nthee.'\n\n'A'll gang after 't, then, for a'm like a pair o' bellowses wi' t'\nwind out; just two flat sides wi' nowt betwixt.'\n\nThe next morning, Sylvia's face was a little redder than usual when\nHarry Donkin's bow-legs were seen circling down the path to the\nhouse door.\n\n'Here's Donkin, for sure!' exclaimed Bell, when she caught sight of\nhim a minute after her daughter. 'Well, I just call that lucky! for\nhe'll be company for thee while Sylvia and me has to turn th'\ncheeses.'\n\nThis was too original a remark for a wife to make in Daniel's\nopinion, on this especial morning, when his rheumatism was twinging\nhim more than usual, so he replied with severity--\n\n'That's all t' women know about it. Wi' them it's \"coompany,\ncoompany, coompany,\" an' they think a man's no better than\ntheirsels. A'd have yo' to know a've a vast o' thoughts in myself',\nas I'm noane willing to lay out for t' benefit o' every man. A've\nniver gotten time for meditation sin' a were married; leastways,\nsin' a left t' sea. Aboard ship, wi' niver a woman wi'n leagues o'\nhail, and upo' t' masthead, in special, a could.'\n\n'Then I'd better tell Donkin as we've no work for him,' said Sylvia,\ninstinctively managing her father by agreeing with him, instead of\nreasoning with or contradicting him.\n\n'Now, theere you go!' wrenching himself round, for fear Sylvia\nshould carry her meekly made threat into execution. 'Ugh! ugh!' as\nhis limb hurt him. 'Come in, Harry, come in, and talk a bit o' sense\nto me, for a've been shut up wi' women these four days, and a'm\na'most a nateral by this time. A'se bound for 't, they'll find yo'\nsome wark, if 't's nought but for to save their own fingers.'\n\nSo Harry took off his coat, and seated himself professional-wise on\nthe hastily-cleared dresser, so that he might have all the light\nafforded by the long, low casement window. Then he blew in his\nthimble, sucked his finger, so that they might adhere tightly\ntogether, and looked about for a subject for opening conversation,\nwhile Sylvia and her mother might be heard opening and shutting\ndrawers and box-lids before they could find the articles that needed\nrepair, or that were required to mend each other.\n\n'Women's well enough i' their way,' said Daniel, in a philosophizing\ntone, 'but a man may have too much on 'em. Now there's me, leg-fast\nthese four days, and a'll make free to say to yo', a'd rather a deal\nha' been loading dung i' t' wettest weather; an' a reckon it's th'\nbeing wi' nought but women as tires me so: they talk so foolish it\ngets int' t' bones like. Now thou know'st thou'rt not called much of\na man oather, but bless yo', t' ninth part's summut to be thankful\nfor, after nought but women. An' yet, yo' seen, they were for\nsending yo' away i' their foolishness! Well! missus, and who's to\npay for t' fettling of all them clothes?' as Bell came down with her\narms full. She was going to answer her husband meekly and literally\naccording to her wont, but Sylvia, already detecting the increased\ncheerfulness of his tone, called out from behind her mother--\n\n'I am, feyther. I'm going for to sell my new cloak as I bought\nThursday, for the mending on your old coats and waistcoats.'\n\n'Hearken till her,' said Daniel, chuckling. 'She's a true wench.\nThree days sin' noane so full as she o' t' new cloak that now she's\nfain t' sell.'\n\n'Ay, Harry. If feyther won't pay yo' for making all these old\nclothes as good as new, I'll sell my new red cloak sooner than yo'\nshall go unpaid.'\n\n'A reckon it's a bargain,' said Harry, casting sharp, professional\neyes on the heap before him, and singling out the best article as to\ntexture for examination and comment.\n\n'They're all again these metal buttons,' said he. 'Silk weavers has\nbeen petitioning Ministers t' make a law to favour silk buttons; and\nI did hear tell as there were informers goin' about spyin' after\nmetal buttons, and as how they could haul yo' before a justice for\nwearing on 'em.'\n\n'A were wed in 'em, and a'll wear 'em to my dyin' day, or a'll wear\nnoane at a'. They're for making such a pack o' laws, they'll be for\nmeddling wi' my fashion o' sleeping next, and taxing me for ivery\nsnore a give. They've been after t' winders, and after t' vittle,\nand after t' very saut to 't; it's dearer by hauf an' more nor it\nwere when a were a boy: they're a meddlesome set o' folks,\nlaw-makers is, an' a'll niver believe King George has ought t' do\nwi' 't. But mark my words; I were wed wi' brass buttons, and brass\nbuttons a'll wear to my death, an' if they moither me about it, a'll\nwear brass buttons i' my coffin!'\n\nBy this time Harry had arranged a certain course of action with Mrs\nRobson, conducting the consultation and agreement by signs. His\nthread was flying fast already, and the mother and daughter felt\nmore free to pursue their own business than they had done for\nseveral days; for it was a good sign that Daniel had taken his pipe\nout of the square hollow in the fireside wall, where he usually kept\nit, and was preparing to diversify his remarks with satisfying\ninterludes of puffing.\n\n'Why, look ye; this very baccy had a run for 't. It came ashore\nsewed up neatly enough i' a woman's stays, as was wife to a\nfishing-smack down at t' bay yonder. She were a lean thing as iver\nyou saw, when she went for t' see her husband aboard t' vessel; but\nshe coom back lustier by a deal, an' wi' many a thing on her, here\nand theere, beside baccy. An' that were i' t' face o' coast-guard\nand yon tender, an' a'. But she made as though she were tipsy, an'\nso they did nought but curse her, an' get out on her way.'\n\n'Speaking of t' tender, there's been a piece o' wark i' Monkshaven\nthis week wi' t' press-gang,' said Harry.\n\n'Ay! ay! our lass was telling about 't; but, Lord bless ye! there's\nno gettin' t' rights on a story out on a woman--though a will say\nthis for our Sylvie, she's as bright a lass as iver a man looked\nat.'\n\nNow the truth was, that Daniel had not liked to demean himself, at\nthe time when Sylvia came back so full of what she had seen at\nMonkshaven, by evincing any curiosity on the subject. He had then\nthought that the next day he would find some business that should\ntake him down to the town, when he could learn all that was to be\nlearnt, without flattering his womankind by asking questions, as if\nanything they might say could interest him. He had a strong notion\nof being a kind of domestic Jupiter.\n\n'It's made a deal o' wark i' Monkshaven. Folk had gotten to think\nnought o' t' tender, she lay so still, an' t' leftenant paid such a\ngood price for all he wanted for t' ship. But o' Thursday t'\n_Resolution_, first whaler back this season, came in port, and t'\npress-gang showed their teeth, and carried off four as good\nable-bodied seamen as iver I made trousers for; and t' place were\nall up like a nest o' wasps, when yo've set your foot in t' midst.\nThey were so mad, they were ready for t' fight t' very pavin'\nstones.'\n\n'A wish a'd been theere! A just wish a had! A've a score for t'\nreckon up wi' t' press-gang!'\n\nAnd the old man lifted up his right hand--his hand on which the\nforefinger and thumb were maimed and useless--partly in\ndenunciation, and partly as a witness of what he had endured to\nescape from the service, abhorred because it was forced. His face\nbecame a totally different countenance with the expression of\nsettled and unrelenting indignation, which his words called out.\n\n'G'on, man, g'on,' said Daniel, impatient with Donkin for the little\ndelay occasioned by the necessity of arranging his work more fully.\n\n'Ay! ay! all in good time; for a've a long tale to tell yet; an' a\nmun have some 'un to iron me out my seams, and look me out my bits,\nfor there's none here fit for my purpose.'\n\n'Dang thy bits! Here, Sylvie! Sylvie! come and be tailor's man, and\nlet t' chap get settled sharp, for a'm fain t' hear his story.'\n\nSylvia took her directions, and placed her irons in the fire, and\nran upstairs for the bundle which had been put aside by her careful\nmother for occasions like the present. It consisted of small pieces\nof various coloured cloth, cut out of old coats and waistcoats, and\nsimilar garments, when the whole had become too much worn for use,\nyet when part had been good enough to be treasured by a thrifty\nhousewife. Daniel grew angry before Donkin had selected his patterns\nand settled the work to his own mind.\n\n'Well,' said he at last; 'a mought be a young man a-goin' a wooin',\nby t' pains thou'st taken for t' match my oud clothes. I don't care\nif they're patched wi' scarlet, a tell thee; so as thou'lt work away\nat thy tale wi' thy tongue, same time as thou works at thy needle\nwi' thy fingers.'\n\n'Then, as a were saying, all Monkshaven were like a nest o' wasps,\nflyin' hither and thither, and makin' sich a buzzin' and a talkin'\nas niver were; and each wi' his sting out, ready for t' vent his\nvenom o' rage and revenge. And women cryin' and sobbin' i' t'\nstreets--when, Lord help us! o' Saturday came a worse time than\niver! for all Friday there had been a kind o' expectation an' dismay\nabout t' _Good Fortune_, as t' mariners had said was off St Abb's\nHead o' Thursday, when t' _Resolution_ came in; and there was wives\nand maids wi' husbands an' sweethearts aboard t' _Good Fortune_\nready to throw their eyes out on their heads wi' gazin', gazin'\nnor'ards over t'sea, as were all one haze o' blankness wi' t' rain;\nand when t' afternoon tide comed in, an' niver a line on her to be\nseen, folk were oncertain as t' whether she were holding off for\nfear o' t' tender--as were out o' sight, too--or what were her mak'\no' goin' on. An' t' poor wet draggled women folk came up t' town,\nsome slowly cryin', as if their hearts was sick, an' others just\nbent their heads to t' wind, and went straight to their homes,\nnother looking nor speaking to ony one; but barred their doors, and\nstiffened theirsels up for a night o' waiting. Saturday morn--yo'll\nmind Saturday morn, it were stormy and gusty, downreet dirty\nweather--theere stood t' folk again by daylight, a watching an' a\nstraining, and by that tide t' _Good Fortune_ came o'er t' bar. But\nt' excisemen had sent back her news by t' boat as took 'em there.\nThey'd a deal of oil, and a vast o' blubber. But for all that her\nflag was drooping i' t' rain, half mast high, for mourning and\nsorrow, an' they'd a dead man aboard--a dead man as was living and\nstrong last sunrise. An' there was another as lay between life an'\ndeath, and there was seven more as should ha' been theere as wasn't,\nbut was carried off by t' gang. T' frigate as we 'n a' heard tell\non, as lying off Hartlepool, got tidings fra' t' tender as captured\nt' seamen o' Thursday: and t' _Aurora_, as they ca'ed her, made off\nfor t' nor'ard; and nine leagues off St Abb's Head, t' _Resolution_\nthinks she were, she see'd t' frigate, and knowed by her build she\nwere a man-o'-war, and guessed she were bound on king's kidnapping.\nI seen t' wounded man mysen wi' my own eyes; and he'll live! he'll\nlive! Niver a man died yet, wi' such a strong purpose o' vengeance\nin him. He could barely speak, for he were badly shot, but his\ncolour coome and went, as t' master's mate an' t' captain telled me\nand some others how t' _Aurora_ fired at 'em, and how t' innocent\nwhaler hoisted her colours, but afore they were fairly run up,\nanother shot coome close in t' shrouds, and then t' Greenland ship\nbeing t' windward, bore down on t' frigate; but as they knew she\nwere an oud fox, and bent on mischief, Kinraid (that's he who lies\na-dying, only he'll noane die, a'se bound), the specksioneer, bade\nt' men go down between decks, and fasten t' hatches well, an' he'd\nstand guard, he an' captain, and t' oud master's mate, being left\nupo' deck for t' give a welcome just skin-deep to t' boat's crew\nfra' t' _Aurora_, as they could see coming t'wards them o'er t'\nwatter, wi' their reg'lar man-o'-war's rowing----'\n\n'Damn 'em!' said Daniel, in soliloquy, and under his breath.\n\nSylvia stood, poising her iron, and listening eagerly, afraid to\ngive Donkin the hot iron for fear of interrupting the narrative,\nunwilling to put it into the fire again, because that action would\nperchance remind him of his work, which now the tailor had\nforgotten, so eager was he in telling his story.\n\n'Well! they coome on over t' watters wi' great bounds, and up t'\nsides they coome like locusts, all armed men; an' t' captain says he\nsaw Kinraid hide away his whaling knife under some tarpaulin', and\nhe knew he meant mischief, an' he would no more ha' stopped him wi'\na word nor he would ha' stopped him fra' killing a whale. And when\nt' _Aurora_'s men were aboard, one on 'em runs to t' helm; and at\nthat t' captain says, he felt as if his wife were kissed afore his\nface; but says he, \"I bethought me on t' men as were shut up below\nhatches, an' I remembered t' folk at Monkshaven as were looking out\nfor us even then; an' I said to mysel', I would speak fair as long\nas I could, more by token o' the whaling-knife, as I could see\nglinting bright under t' black tarpaulin.\" So he spoke quite fair\nand civil, though he see'd they was nearing t' _Aurora_, and t'\n_Aurora_ was nearing them. Then t' navy captain hailed him thro' t'\ntrumpet, wi' a great rough blast, and, says he, \"Order your men to\ncome on deck.\" And t' captain of t' whaler says his men cried up\nfrom under t' hatches as they'd niver be gi'en up wi'out bloodshed,\nand he sees Kinraid take out his pistol, and look well to t'\npriming; so he says to t' navy captain, \"We're protected\nGreenland-men, and you have no right t' meddle wi' us.\" But t' navy\ncaptain only bellows t' more, \"Order your men t' come on deck. If\nthey won't obey you, and you have lost the command of your vessel, I\nreckon you're in a state of mutiny, and you may come aboard t'\n_Aurora_ and such men as are willing t' follow you, and I'll fire\nint' the rest.\" Yo' see, that were t' depth o' the man: he were for\npretending and pretexting as t' captain could na manage his own\nship, and as he'd help him. But our Greenland captain were noane so\npoor-spirited, and says he, \"She's full of oil, and I ware you of\nconsequences if you fire into her. Anyhow, pirate, or no pirate\"\n(for t' word pirate stuck in his gizzard), \"I'm a honest Monkshaven\nman, an' I come fra' a land where there's great icebergs and many a\ndeadly danger, but niver a press-gang, thank God! and that's what\nyou are, I reckon.\" Them's the words he told me, but whether he\nspoke 'em out so bold at t' time, I'se not so sure; they were in his\nmind for t' speak, only maybe prudence got t' better on him, for he\nsaid he prayed i' his heart to bring his cargo safe to t' owners,\ncome what might. Well, t' _Aurora_'s men aboard t' _Good Fortune_\ncried out \"might they fire down t' hatches, and bring t' men out\nthat a way?\" and then t' specksioneer, he speaks, an' he says he\nstands ower t' hatches, and he has two good pistols, and summut\nbesides, and he don't care for his life, bein' a bachelor, but all\nbelow are married men, yo' see, and he'll put an end to t' first two\nchaps as come near t' hatches. An' they say he picked two off as\nmade for t' come near, and then, just as he were stooping for t'\nwhaling knife, an' it's as big as a sickle----'\n\n'Teach folk as don't know a whaling knife,' cried Daniel. 'I were a\nGreenland-man mysel'.'\n\n'They shot him through t' side, and dizzied him, and kicked him\naside for dead; and fired down t' hatches, and killed one man, and\ndisabled two, and then t' rest cried for quarter, for life is sweet,\ne'en aboard a king's ship; and t' _Aurora_ carried 'em off, wounded\nmen, an' able men, an' all: leaving Kinraid for dead, as wasn't\ndead, and Darley for dead, as was dead, an' t' captain and master's\nmate as were too old for work; and t' captain, as loves Kinraid like\na brother, poured rum down his throat, and bandaged him up, and has\nsent for t' first doctor in Monkshaven for to get t' slugs out; for\nthey say there's niver such a harpooner in a' t' Greenland seas; an'\nI can speak fra' my own seeing he's a fine young fellow where he\nlies theere, all stark and wan for weakness and loss o' blood. But\nDarley's dead as a door-nail; and there's to be such a burying of\nhim as niver was seen afore i' Monkshaven, come Sunday. And now gi'\nus t' iron, wench, and let's lose no more time a-talking.'\n\n'It's noane loss o' time,' said Daniel, moving himself heavily in\nhis chair, to feel how helpless he was once more. 'If a were as\nyoung as once a were--nay, lad, if a had na these sore rheumatics,\nnow--a reckon as t' press-gang 'ud find out as t' shouldn't do such\nthings for nothing. Bless thee, man! it's waur nor i' my youth i'\nth' Ameriky war, and then 't were bad enough.'\n\n'And Kinraid?' said Sylvia, drawing a long breath, after the effort\nof realizing it all; her cheeks had flushed up, and her eyes had\nglittered during the progress of the tale.\n\n'Oh! he'll do. He'll not die. Life's stuff is in him yet.'\n\n'He'll be Molly Corney's cousin, I reckon,' said Sylvia, bethinking\nher with a blush of Molly Corney's implication that he was more than\na cousin to her, and immediately longing to go off and see Molly,\nand hear all the little details which women do not think it beneath\nthem to give to women. From that time Sylvia's little heart was bent\non this purpose. But it was not one to be openly avowed even to\nherself. She only wanted sadly to see Molly, and she almost believed\nherself that it was to consult her about the fashion of her cloak;\nwhich Donkin was to cut out, and which she was to make under his\ndirections; at any rate, this was the reason she gave to her mother\nwhen the day's work was done, and a fine gleam came out upon the\npale and watery sky towards evening.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\nTHE SAILOR'S FUNERAL\n\n\nMoss Brow, the Corney's house, was but a disorderly, comfortless\nplace. You had to cross a dirty farmyard, all puddles and dungheaps,\non stepping-stones, to get to the door of the house-place. That\ngreat room itself was sure to have clothes hanging to dry at the\nfire, whatever day of the week it was; some one of the large\nirregular family having had what is called in the district a\n'dab-wash' of a few articles, forgotten on the regular day. And\nsometimes these articles lay in their dirty state in the untidy\nkitchen, out of which a room, half parlour, half bedroom, opened on\none side, and a dairy, the only clean place in the house, at the\nopposite. In face of you, as you entered the door, was the entrance\nto the working-kitchen, or scullery. Still, in spite of disorder\nlike this, there was a well-to-do aspect about the place; the\nCorneys were rich in their way, in flocks and herds as well as in\nchildren; and to them neither dirt nor the perpetual bustle arising\nfrom ill-ordered work detracted from comfort. They were all of an\neasy, good-tempered nature; Mrs. Corney and her daughters gave every\none a welcome at whatever time of the day they came, and would just\nas soon sit down for a gossip at ten o'clock in the morning, as at\nfive in the evening, though at the former time the house-place was\nfull of work of various kinds which ought to be got out of hand and\ndone with: while the latter hour was towards the end of the day,\nwhen farmers' wives and daughters were usually--'cleaned' was the\nword then, 'dressed' is that in vogue now. Of course in such a\nhousehold as this Sylvia was sure to be gladly received. She was\nyoung, and pretty, and bright, and brought a fresh breeze of\npleasant air about her as her appropriate atmosphere. And besides,\nBell Robson held her head so high that visits from her daughter were\nrather esteemed as a favour, for it was not everywhere that Sylvia\nwas allowed to go.\n\n'Sit yo' down, sit yo' down!' cried Dame Corney, dusting a chair\nwith her apron; 'a reckon Molly 'll be in i' no time. She's nobbut\ngone int' t' orchard, to see if she can find wind-falls enough for\nt' make a pie or two for t' lads. They like nowt so weel for supper\nas apple-pies sweetened wi' treacle, crust stout and leathery, as\nstands chewing, and we hannot getten in our apples yet.'\n\n'If Molly is in t' orchard, I'll go find her,' said Sylvia.\n\n'Well! yo' lasses will have your conks' (private talks), 'a know;\nsecrets 'bout sweethearts and such like,' said Mrs. Corney, with a\nknowing look, which made Sylvia hate her for the moment. 'A've not\nforgotten as a were young mysen. Tak' care; there's a pool o' mucky\nwatter just outside t' back-door.'\n\nBut Sylvia was half-way across the back-yard--worse, if possible,\nthan the front as to the condition in which it was kept--and had\npassed through the little gate into the orchard. It was full of old\ngnarled apple-trees, their trunks covered with gray lichen, in which\nthe cunning chaffinch built her nest in spring-time. The cankered\nbranches remained on the trees, and added to the knotted\ninterweaving overhead, if they did not to the productiveness; the\ngrass grew in long tufts, and was wet and tangled under foot. There\nwas a tolerable crop of rosy apples still hanging on the gray old\ntrees, and here and there they showed ruddy in the green bosses of\nuntrimmed grass. Why the fruit was not gathered, as it was evidently\nripe, would have puzzled any one not acquainted with the Corney\nfamily to say; but to them it was always a maxim in practice, if not\nin precept, 'Do nothing to-day that you can put off till to-morrow,'\nand accordingly the apples dropped from the trees at any little gust\nof wind, and lay rotting on the ground until the 'lads' wanted a\nsupply of pies for supper.\n\nMolly saw Sylvia, and came quickly across the orchard to meet her,\ncatching her feet in knots of grass as she hurried along.\n\n'Well, lass!' said she, 'who'd ha' thought o' seeing yo' such a day\nas it has been?'\n\n'But it's cleared up now beautiful,' said Sylvia, looking up at the\nsoft evening sky, to be seen through the apple boughs. It was of a\ntender, delicate gray, with the faint warmth of a promising sunset\ntinging it with a pink atmosphere. 'Rain is over and gone, and I\nwanted to know how my cloak is to be made; for Donkin 's working at\nour house, and I wanted to know all about--the news, yo' know.'\n\n'What news?' asked Molly, for she had heard of the affair between\nthe _Good Fortune_ and the _Aurora_ some days before; and, to tell\nthe truth, it had rather passed out of her head just at this moment.\n\n'Hannot yo' heard all about t' press-gang and t' whaler, and t'\ngreat fight, and Kinraid, as is your cousin, acting so brave and\ngrand, and lying on his death-bed now?'\n\n'Oh!' said Molly, enlightened as to Sylvia's 'news,' and half\nsurprised at the vehemence with which the little creature spoke;\n'yes; a heerd that days ago. But Charley's noane on his death-bed,\nhe's a deal better; an' mother says as he's to be moved up here next\nweek for nursin' and better air nor he gets i' t' town yonder.'\n\n'Oh! I am so glad,' said Sylvia, with all her heart. 'I thought he'd\nmaybe die, and I should niver see him.'\n\n'A'll promise yo' shall see him; that's t' say if a' goes on well,\nfor he's getten an ugly hurt. Mother says as there's four blue marks\non his side as'll last him his life, an' t' doctor fears bleeding i'\nhis inside; and then he'll drop down dead when no one looks for 't.'\n\n'But you said he was better,' said Sylvia, blanching a little at\nthis account.\n\n'Ay, he's better, but life's uncertain, special after gun-shot\nwounds.'\n\n'He acted very fine,' said Sylvia, meditating.\n\n'A allays knowed he would. Many's the time a've heerd him say\n\"honour bright,\" and now he's shown how bright his is.'\n\nMolly did not speak sentimentally, but with a kind of proprietorship\nin Kinraid's honour, which confirmed Sylvia in her previous idea of\na mutual attachment between her and her cousin. Considering this\nnotion, she was a little surprised at Molly's next speech.\n\n'An' about yer cloak, are you for a hood or a cape? a reckon that's\nthe question.'\n\n'Oh, I don't care! tell me more about Kinraid. Do yo' really think\nhe'll get better?'\n\n'Dear! how t' lass takes on about him. A'll tell him what a deal of\ninterest a young woman taks i' him!'\n\nFrom that time Sylvia never asked another question about him. In a\nsomewhat dry and altered tone, she said, after a little pause--\n\n'I think on a hood. What do you say to it?'\n\n'Well; hoods is a bit old-fashioned, to my mind. If 't were mine,\nI'd have a cape cut i' three points, one to tie on each shoulder,\nand one to dip down handsome behind. But let yo' an' me go to\nMonkshaven church o' Sunday, and see Measter Fishburn's daughters,\nas has their things made i' York, and notice a bit how they're made.\nWe needn't do it i' church, but just scan 'em o'er i' t' churchyard,\nand there'll be no harm done. Besides, there's to be this grand\nburryin' o' t' man t' press-gang shot, and 't will be like killing\ntwo birds at once.'\n\n'I should like to go,' said Sylvia. 'I feel so sorry like for the\npoor sailors shot down and kidnapped just as they was coming home,\nas we see'd 'em o' Thursday last. I'll ask mother if she'll let me\ngo.'\n\n'Ay, do. I know my mother 'll let me, if she doesn't go hersen; for\nit 'll be a sight to see and to speak on for many a long year, after\nwhat I've heerd. And Miss Fishburns is sure to be theere, so I'd\njust get Donkin to cut out cloak itsel', and keep back yer mind fra'\nfixing o' either cape or hood till Sunday's turn'd.'\n\n'Will yo' set me part o' t' way home?' said Sylvia, seeing the dying\ndaylight become more and more crimson through the blackening trees.\n\n'No; I can't. A should like it well enough, but somehow, there's a\ndeal o' work to be done yet, for t' hours slip through one's fingers\nso as there's no knowing. Mind yo', then, o' Sunday. A'll be at t'\nstile one o'clock punctual; and we'll go slowly into t' town, and\nlook about us as we go, and see folk's dresses; and go to t' church,\nand say wer prayers, and come out and have a look at t' funeral.'\n\nAnd with this programme of proceedings settled for the following\nSunday, the girls whom neighbourhood and parity of age had forced\ninto some measure of friendship parted for the time.\n\nSylvia hastened home, feeling as if she had been absent long; her\nmother stood on the little knoll at the side of the house watching\nfor her, with her hand shading her eyes from the low rays of the\nsetting sun: but as soon as she saw her daughter in the distance,\nshe returned to her work, whatever that might be. She was not a\nwoman of many words, or of much demonstration; few observers would\nhave guessed how much she loved her child; but Sylvia, without any\nreasoning or observation, instinctively knew that her mother's heart\nwas bound up in her.\n\nHer father and Donkin were going on much as when she had left them;\ntalking and disputing, the one compelled to be idle, the other\nstitching away as fast as he talked. They seemed as if they had\nnever missed Sylvia; no more did her mother for that matter, for she\nwas busy and absorbed in her afternoon dairy-work to all appearance.\nBut Sylvia had noted the watching not three minutes before, and many\na time in her after life, when no one cared much for her out-goings\nand in-comings, the straight, upright figure of her mother, fronting\nthe setting sun, but searching through its blinding rays for a sight\nof her child, rose up like a sudden-seen picture, the remembrance of\nwhich smote Sylvia to the heart with a sense of a lost blessing, not\nduly valued while possessed.\n\n'Well, feyther, and how's a' wi' you?' asked Sylvia, going to the\nside of his chair, and laying her hand on his shoulder.\n\n'Eh! harkee till this lass o' mine. She thinks as because she's gone\ngalraverging, I maun ha' missed her and be ailing. Why, lass, Donkin\nand me has had t' most sensible talk a've had this many a day. A've\ngi'en him a vast o' knowledge, and he's done me a power o' good.\nPlease God, to-morrow a'll tak' a start at walking, if t' weather\nholds up.'\n\n'Ay!' said Donkin, with a touch of sarcasm in his voice; 'feyther\nand me has settled many puzzles; it's been a loss to Government as\nthey hannot been here for profiting by our wisdom. We've done away\nwi' taxes and press-gangs, and many a plague, and beaten t'\nFrench--i' our own minds, that's to say.'\n\n'It's a wonder t' me as those Lunnon folks can't see things clear,'\nsaid Daniel, all in good faith.\n\nSylvia did not quite understand the state of things as regarded\npolitics and taxes--and politics and taxes were all one in her mind,\nit must be confessed--but she saw that her innocent little scheme of\ngiving her father the change of society afforded by Donkin's coming\nhad answered; and in the gladness of her heart she went out and ran\nround the corner of the house to find Kester, and obtain from him\nthat sympathy in her success which she dared not ask from her\nmother.\n\n'Kester, Kester, lad!' said she, in a loud whisper; but Kester was\nsuppering the horses, and in the clamp of their feet on the round\nstable pavement, he did not hear her at first. She went a little\nfarther into the stable. 'Kester! he's a vast better, he'll go out\nto-morrow; it's all Donkin's doing. I'm beholden to thee for\nfetching him, and I'll try and spare thee waistcoat fronts out o' t'\nstuff for my new red cloak. Thou'll like that, Kester, won't ta?'\n\nKester took the notion in slowly, and weighed it.\n\n'Na, lass,' said he, deliberately, after a pause. 'A could na' bear\nto see thee wi' thy cloak scrimpit. A like t' see a wench look bonny\nand smart, an' a tak' a kind o' pride in thee, an should be a'most\nas much hurt i' my mind to see thee i' a pinched cloak as if old\nMoll's tail here were docked too short. Na, lass, a'se niver got a\nmirroring glass for t' see mysen in, so what's waistcoats to me?\nKeep thy stuff to thysen, theere's a good wench; but a'se main and\nglad about t' measter. Place isn't like itsen when he's shut up and\ncranky.'\n\nHe took up a wisp of straw and began rubbing down the old mare, and\nhissing over his work as if he wished to consider the conversation\nas ended. And Sylvia, who had strung herself up in a momentary\nfervour of gratitude to make the generous offer, was not sorry to\nhave it refused, and went back planning what kindness she could show\nto Kester without its involving so much sacrifice to herself. For\ngiving waistcoat fronts to him would deprive her of the pleasant\npower of selecting a fashionable pattern in Monkshaven churchyard\nnext Sunday.\n\nThat wished-for day seemed long a-coming, as wished-for days most\nfrequently do. Her father got better by slow degrees, and her mother\nwas pleased by the tailor's good pieces of work; showing the\nneatly-placed patches with as much pride as many matrons take in new\nclothes now-a-days. And the weather cleared up into a dim kind of\nautumnal fineness, into anything but an Indian summer as far as\nregarded gorgeousness of colouring, for on that coast the mists and\nsea fogs early spoil the brilliancy of the foliage. Yet, perhaps,\nthe more did the silvery grays and browns of the inland scenery\nconduce to the tranquillity of the time,--the time of peace and rest\nbefore the fierce and stormy winter comes on. It seems a time for\ngathering up human forces to encounter the coming severity, as well\nas of storing up the produce of harvest for the needs of winter. Old\npeople turn out and sun themselves in that calm St. Martin's summer,\nwithout fear of 'the heat o' th' sun, or the coming winter's rages,'\nand we may read in their pensive, dreamy eyes that they are weaning\nthemselves away from the earth, which probably many may never see\ndressed in her summer glory again.\n\nMany such old people set out betimes, on the Sunday afternoon to\nwhich Sylvia had been so looking forward, to scale the long flights\nof stone steps--worn by the feet of many generations--which led up\nto the parish church, placed on a height above the town, on a great\ngreen area at the summit of the cliff, which was the angle where the\nriver and the sea met, and so overlooking both the busy crowded\nlittle town, the port, the shipping, and the bar on the one hand,\nand the wide illimitable tranquil sea on the other--types of life\nand eternity. It was a good situation for that church.\nHomeward-bound sailors caught sight of the tower of St Nicholas, the\nfirst land object of all. They who went forth upon the great deep\nmight carry solemn thoughts with them of the words they had heard\nthere; not conscious thoughts, perhaps--rather a distinct if dim\nconviction that buying and selling, eating and marrying, even life\nand death, were not all the realities in existence. Nor were the\nwords that came up to their remembrance words of sermons preached\nthere, however impressive. The sailors mostly slept through the\nsermons; unless, indeed, there were incidents such as were involved\nin what were called 'funeral discourses' to be narrated. They did\nnot recognize their daily faults or temptations under the grand\naliases befitting their appearance from a preacher's mouth. But they\nknew the old, oft-repeated words praying for deliverance from the\nfamiliar dangers of lightning and tempest; from battle, murder, and\nsudden death; and nearly every man was aware that he left behind him\nsome one who would watch for the prayer for the preservation of\nthose who travel by land or by water, and think of him, as\nGod-protected the more for the earnestness of the response then\ngiven.\n\nThere, too, lay the dead of many generations; for St. Nicholas had\nbeen the parish church ever since Monkshaven was a town, and the\nlarge churchyard was rich in the dead. Masters, mariners,\nship-owners, seamen: it seemed strange how few other trades were\nrepresented in that great plain so full of upright gravestones. Here\nand there was a memorial stone, placed by some survivor of a large\nfamily, most of whom perished at sea:--'Supposed to have perished\nin the Greenland seas,' 'Shipwrecked in the Baltic,' 'Drowned off\nthe coast of Iceland.' There was a strange sensation, as if the cold\nsea-winds must bring with them the dim phantoms of those lost\nsailors, who had died far from their homes, and from the hallowed\nground where their fathers lay.\n\nEach flight of steps up to this churchyard ended in a small flat\nspace, on which a wooden seat was placed. On this particular Sunday,\nall these seats were filled by aged people, breathless with the\nunusual exertion of climbing. You could see the church stair, as it\nwas called, from nearly every part of the town, and the figures of\nthe numerous climbers, diminished by distance, looked like a busy\nant-hill, long before the bell began to ring for afternoon service.\nAll who could manage it had put on a bit of black in token of\nmourning; it might be very little; an old ribbon, a rusty piece of\ncrape; but some sign of mourning was shown by every one down to the\nlittle child in its mother's arms, that innocently clutched the\npiece of rosemary to be thrown into the grave 'for remembrance.'\nDarley, the seaman shot by the press-gang, nine leagues off St.\nAbb's Head, was to be buried to-day, at the accustomed time for the\nfunerals of the poorer classes, directly after evening service, and\nthere were only the sick and their nurse-tenders who did not come\nforth to show their feeling for the man whom they looked upon as\nmurdered. The crowd of vessels in harbour bore their flags half-mast\nhigh; and the crews were making their way through the High Street.\nThe gentlefolk of Monkshaven, full of indignation at this\ninterference with their ships, full of sympathy with the family who\nhad lost their son and brother almost within sight of his home, came\nin unusual numbers--no lack of patterns for Sylvia; but her\nthoughts were far otherwise and more suitably occupied. The unwonted\nsternness and solemnity visible on the countenances of all whom she\nmet awed and affected her. She did not speak in reply to Molly's\nremarks on the dress or appearance of those who struck her. She felt\nas if these speeches jarred on her, and annoyed her almost to\nirritation; yet Molly had come all the way to Monkshaven Church in\nher service, and deserved forbearance accordingly. The two mounted\nthe steps alongside of many people; few words were exchanged, even\nat the breathing places, so often the little centres of gossip.\nLooking over the sea there was not a sail to be seen; it seemed\nbared of life, as if to be in serious harmony with what was going on\ninland.\n\nThe church was of old Norman architecture; low and massive outside:\ninside, of vast space, only a quarter of which was filled on\nordinary Sundays. The walls were disfigured by numerous tablets of\nblack and white marble intermixed, and the usual ornamentation of\nthat style of memorial as erected in the last century, of weeping\nwillows, urns, and drooping figures, with here and there a ship in\nfull sail, or an anchor, where the seafaring idea prevalent through\nthe place had launched out into a little originality. There was no\nwood-work, the church had been stripped of that, most probably when\nthe neighbouring monastery had been destroyed. There were large\nsquare pews, lined with green baize, with the names of the families\nof the most flourishing ship-owners painted white on the doors;\nthere were pews, not so large, and not lined at all, for the farmers\nand shopkeepers of the parish; and numerous heavy oaken benches\nwhich, by the united efforts of several men, might be brought within\nearshot of the pulpit. These were being removed into the most\nconvenient situations when Molly and Sylvia entered the church, and\nafter two or three whispered sentences they took their seats on one\nof these.\n\nThe vicar of Monkshaven was a kindly, peaceable old man, hating\nstrife and troubled waters above everything. He was a vehement Tory\nin theory, as became his cloth in those days. He had two bugbears to\nfear--the French and the Dissenters. It was difficult to say of\nwhich he had the worst opinion and the most intense dread. Perhaps\nhe hated the Dissenters most, because they came nearer in contact\nwith him than the French; besides, the French had the excuse of\nbeing Papists, while the Dissenters might have belonged to the\nChurch of England if they had not been utterly depraved. Yet in\npractice Dr Wilson did not object to dine with Mr. Fishburn, who was\na personal friend and follower of Wesley, but then, as the doctor\nwould say, 'Wesley was an Oxford man, and that makes him a\ngentleman; and he was an ordained minister of the Church of England,\nso that grace can never depart from him.' But I do not know what\nexcuse he would have alleged for sending broth and vegetables to old\nRalph Thompson, a rabid Independent, who had been given to abusing\nthe Church and the vicar, from a Dissenting pulpit, as long as ever\nhe could mount the stairs. However, that inconsistency between Dr\nWilson's theories and practice was not generally known in\nMonkshaven, so we have nothing to do with it.\n\nDr Wilson had had a very difficult part to play, and a still more\ndifficult sermon to write, during this last week. The Darley who had\nbeen killed was the son of the vicar's gardener, and Dr Wilson's\nsympathies as a man had been all on the bereaved father's side. But\nthen he had received, as the oldest magistrate in the neighbourhood,\na letter from the captain of the _Aurora_, explanatory and\nexculpatory. Darley had been resisting the orders of an officer in\nhis Majesty's service. What would become of due subordination and\nloyalty, and the interests of the service, and the chances of\nbeating those confounded French, if such conduct as Darley's was to\nbe encouraged? (Poor Darley! he was past all evil effects of human\nencouragement now!)\n\nSo the vicar mumbled hastily over a sermon on the text, 'In the\nmidst of life we are in death'; which might have done as well for a\nbaby cut off in a convulsion-fit as for the strong man shot down\nwith all his eager blood hot within him, by men as hot-blooded as\nhimself. But once when the old doctor's eye caught the up-turned,\nstraining gaze of the father Darley, seeking with all his soul to\nfind a grain of holy comfort in the chaff of words, his conscience\nsmote him. Had he nothing to say that should calm anger and revenge\nwith spiritual power? no breath of the comforter to soothe repining\ninto resignation? But again the discord between the laws of man and\nthe laws of Christ stood before him; and he gave up the attempt to\ndo more than he was doing, as beyond his power. Though the hearers\nwent away as full of anger as they had entered the church, and some\nwith a dull feeling of disappointment as to what they had got there,\nyet no one felt anything but kindly towards the old vicar. His\nsimple, happy life led amongst them for forty years, and open to all\nmen in its daily course; his sweet-tempered, cordial ways; his\npractical kindness, made him beloved by all; and neither he nor they\nthought much or cared much for admiration of his talents. Respect\nfor his office was all the respect he thought of; and that was\nconceded to him from old traditional and hereditary association. In\nlooking back to the last century, it appears curious to see how\nlittle our ancestors had the power of putting two things together,\nand perceiving either the discord or harmony thus produced. Is it\nbecause we are farther off from those times, and have, consequently,\na greater range of vision? Will our descendants have a wonder about\nus, such as we have about the inconsistency of our forefathers, or a\nsurprise at our blindness that we do not perceive that, holding such\nand such opinions, our course of action must be so and so, or that\nthe logical consequence of particular opinions must be convictions\nwhich at present we hold in abhorrence? It seems puzzling to look\nback on men such as our vicar, who almost held the doctrine that the\nKing could do no wrong, yet were ever ready to talk of the glorious\nRevolution, and to abuse the Stuarts for having entertained the same\ndoctrine, and tried to put it in practice. But such discrepancies\nran through good men's lives in those days. It is well for us that\nwe live at the present time, when everybody is logical and\nconsistent. This little discussion must be taken in place of Dr\nWilson's sermon, of which no one could remember more than the text\nhalf an hour after it was delivered. Even the doctor himself had the\nrecollection of the words he had uttered swept out of his mind, as,\nhaving doffed his gown and donned his surplice, he came out of the\ndusk of his vestry and went to the church-door, looking into the\nbroad light which came upon the plain of the church-yard on the\ncliffs; for the sun had not yet set, and the pale moon was slowly\nrising through the silvery mist that obscured the distant moors.\nThere was a thick, dense crowd, all still and silent, looking away\nfrom the church and the vicar, who awaited the bringing of the dead.\nThey were watching the slow black line winding up the long steps,\nresting their heavy burden here and there, standing in silent groups\nat each landing-place; now lost to sight as a piece of broken,\noverhanging ground intervened, now emerging suddenly nearer; and\noverhead the great church bell, with its mediaeval inscription,\nfamiliar to the vicar, if to no one else who heard it, I to the\ngrave do summon all, kept on its heavy booming monotone, with which\nno other sound from land or sea, near or distant, intermingled,\nexcept the cackle of the geese on some far-away farm on the moors,\nas they were coming home to roost; and that one noise from so great\na distance seemed only to deepen the stillness. Then there was a\nlittle movement in the crowd; a little pushing from side to side, to\nmake a path for the corpse and its bearers--an aggregate of the\nfragments of room.\n\nWith bent heads and spent strength, those who carried the coffin\nmoved on; behind came the poor old gardener, a brown-black funeral\ncloak thrown over his homely dress, and supporting his wife with\nsteps scarcely less feeble than her own. He had come to church that\nafternoon, with a promise to her that he would return to lead her to\nthe funeral of her firstborn; for he felt, in his sore perplexed\nheart, full of indignation and dumb anger, as if he must go and hear\nsomething which should exorcize the unwonted longing for revenge\nthat disturbed his grief, and made him conscious of that great blank\nof consolation which faithfulness produces. And for the time he was\nfaithless. How came God to permit such cruel injustice of man?\nPermitting it, He could not be good. Then what was life, and what\nwas death, but woe and despair? The beautiful solemn words of the\nritual had done him good, and restored much of his faith. Though he\ncould not understand why such sorrow had befallen him any more than\nbefore, he had come back to something of his childlike trust; he\nkept saying to himself in a whisper, as he mounted the weary steps,\n'It is the Lord's doing'; and the repetition soothed him\nunspeakably. Behind this old couple followed their children, grown\nmen and women, come from distant place or farmhouse service; the\nservants at the vicarage, and many a neighbour, anxious to show\ntheir sympathy, and most of the sailors from the crews of the\nvessels in port, joined in procession, and followed the dead body\ninto the church.\n\nThere was too great a crowd immediately within the door for Sylvia\nand Molly to go in again, and they accordingly betook themselves to\nthe place where the deep grave was waiting, wide and hungry, to\nreceive its dead. There, leaning against the headstones all around,\nwere many standing--looking over the broad and placid sea, and\nturned to the soft salt air which blew on their hot eyes and rigid\nfaces; for no one spoke of all that number. They were thinking of\nthe violent death of him over whom the solemn words were now being\nsaid in the gray old church, scarcely out of their hearing, had not\nthe sound been broken by the measured lapping of the tide far\nbeneath.\n\nSuddenly every one looked round towards the path from the churchyard\nsteps. Two sailors were supporting a ghastly figure that, with\nfeeble motions, was drawing near the open grave.\n\n'It's t' specksioneer as tried to save him! It's him as was left for\ndead!' the people murmured round.\n\n'It's Charley Kinraid, as I'm a sinner!' said Molly, starting\nforward to greet her cousin.\n\nBut as he came on, she saw that all his strength was needed for the\nmere action of walking. The sailors, in their strong sympathy, had\nyielded to his earnest entreaty, and carried him up the steps, in\norder that he might see the last of his messmate. They placed him\nnear the grave, resting against a stone; and he was hardly there\nbefore the vicar came forth, and the great crowd poured out of the\nchurch, following the body to the grave.\n\nSylvia was so much wrapt up in the solemnity of the occasion, that\nshe had no thought to spare at the first moment for the pale and\nhaggard figure opposite; much less was she aware of her cousin\nPhilip, who now singling her out for the first time from among the\ncrowd, pressed to her side, with an intention of companionship and\nprotection.\n\nAs the service went on, ill-checked sobs rose from behind the two\ngirls, who were among the foremost in the crowd, and by-and-by the\ncry and the wail became general. Sylvia's tears rained down her\nface, and her distress became so evident that it attracted the\nattention of many in that inner circle. Among others who noticed it,\nthe specksioneer's hollow eyes were caught by the sight of the\ninnocent blooming childlike face opposite to him, and he wondered if\nshe were a relation; yet, seeing that she bore no badge of mourning,\nhe rather concluded that she must have been a sweetheart of the dead\nman.\n\nAnd now all was over: the rattle of the gravel on the coffin; the\nlast long, lingering look of friends and lovers; the rosemary sprigs\nhad been cast down by all who were fortunate enough to have brought\nthem--and oh! how much Sylvia wished she had remembered this last\nact of respect--and slowly the outer rim of the crowd began to\nslacken and disappear.\n\nNow Philip spoke to Sylvia.\n\n'I never dreamt of seeing you here. I thought my aunt always went to\nKirk Moorside.'\n\n'I came with Molly Corney,' said Sylvia. 'Mother is staying at home\nwith feyther.'\n\n'How's his rheumatics?' asked Philip.\n\nBut at the same moment Molly took hold of Sylvia's hand, and said--\n\n'A want t' get round and speak to Charley. Mother 'll be main and\nglad to hear as he's getten out; though, for sure, he looks as\nthough he'd ha' been better in 's bed. Come, Sylvia.'\n\nAnd Philip, fain to keep with Sylvia, had to follow the two girls\nclose up to the specksioneer, who was preparing for his slow\nlaborious walk back to his lodgings. He stopped on seeing his\ncousin.\n\n'Well, Molly,' said he, faintly, putting out his hand, but his eye\npassing her face to look at Sylvia in the background, her\ntear-stained face full of shy admiration of the nearest approach to\na hero she had ever seen.\n\n'Well, Charley, a niver was so taken aback as when a saw yo' theere,\nlike a ghost, a-standin' agin a gravestone. How white and wan yo' do\nlook!'\n\n'Ay!' said he, wearily, 'wan and weak enough.'\n\n'But I hope you're getting better, sir,' said Sylvia, in a low\nvoice, longing to speak to him, and yet wondering at her own\ntemerity.\n\n'Thank you, my lass. I'm o'er th' worst.'\n\nHe sighed heavily.\n\nPhilip now spoke.\n\n'We're doing him no kindness a-keeping him standing here i' t'\nnight-fall, and him so tired.' And he made as though he would turn\naway. Kinraid's two sailor friends backed up Philip's words with\nsuch urgency, that, somehow, Sylvia thought they had been to blame\nin speaking to him, and blushed excessively with the idea.\n\n'Yo'll come and be nursed at Moss Brow, Charley,' said Molly; and\nSylvia dropped her little maidenly curtsey, and said, 'Good-by;'\nand went away, wondering how Molly could talk so freely to such a\nhero; but then, to be sure, he was a cousin, and probably a\nsweetheart, and that would make a great deal of difference, of\ncourse.\n\nMeanwhile her own cousin kept close by her side.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\nTETE-A-TETE.--THE WILL\n\n\n'And now tell me all about th' folk at home?' said Philip, evidently\npreparing to walk back with the girls. He generally came to\nHaytersbank every Sunday afternoon, so Sylvia knew what she had to\nexpect the moment she became aware of his neighbourhood in the\nchurchyard.\n\n'My feyther's been sadly troubled with his rheumatics this week\npast; but he's a vast better now, thank you kindly.' Then,\naddressing herself to Molly, she asked, 'Has your cousin a doctor to\nlook after him?'\n\n'Ay, for sure!' said Molly, quickly; for though she knew nothing\nabout the matter, she was determined to suppose that her cousin had\neverything becoming an invalid as well as a hero. 'He's well-to-do,\nand can afford everything as he needs,' continued she. 'His\nfeyther's left him money, and he were a farmer out up in\nNorthumberland, and he's reckoned such a specksioneer as never,\nnever was, and gets what wage he asks for and a share on every whale\nhe harpoons beside.'\n\n'I reckon he'll have to make himself scarce on this coast for\nawhile, at any rate,' said Philip.\n\n'An' what for should he?' asked Molly, who never liked Philip at the\nbest of times, and now, if he was going to disparage her cousin in\nany way, was ready to take up arms and do battle.\n\n'Why, they do say as he fired the shot as has killed some o' the\nmen-o'-war's men, and, of course, if he has, he'll have to stand his\ntrial if he's caught.'\n\n'What lies people do say!' exclaimed Molly. 'He niver killed nought\nbut whales, a'll be bound; or, if he did, it were all right and\nproper as he should, when they were for stealing him an' all t'\nothers, and did kill poor Darley as we come fra' seemin' buried. A\nsuppose, now yo're such a Quaker that, if some one was to break\nthrough fra' t' other side o' this dyke and offer for to murder\nSylvia and me, yo'd look on wi' yo'r hands hanging by yo'r side.'\n\n'But t' press-gang had law on their side, and were doing nought but\nwhat they'd warrant for.'\n\n'Th' tender's gone away, as if she were ashamed o' what she'd done,'\nsaid Sylvia, 'and t' flag's down fra' o'er the Randyvowse. There 'll\nbe no more press-ganging here awhile.'\n\n'No; feyther says,' continued Molly, 'as they've made t' place too\nhot t' hold 'em, coming so strong afore people had getten used to\ntheir ways o' catchin' up poor lads just come fra' t' Greenland\nseas. T' folks ha' their blood so up they'd think no harm o'\nfighting 'em i' t' streets--ay, and o' killing 'em, too, if they\nwere for using fire-arms, as t' _Aurora_'s men did.'\n\n'Women is so fond o' bloodshed,' said Philip; 'for t' hear you talk,\nwho'd ha' thought you'd just come fra' crying ower the grave of a\nman who was killed by violence? I should ha' thought you'd seen\nenough of what sorrow comes o' fighting. Why, them lads o' t'\n_Aurora_ as they say Kinraid shot down had fathers and mothers,\nmaybe, a looking out for them to come home.'\n\n'I don't think he could ha' killed them,' said Sylvia; 'he looked so\ngentle.'\n\nBut Molly did not like this half-and-half view of the case.\n\n'A dare say he did kill 'em dead; he's not one to do things by\nhalves. And a think he served 'em reet, that's what a do.'\n\n'Is na' this Hester, as serves in Foster's shop?' asked Sylvia, in a\nlow voice, as a young woman came through a stile in the stone wall\nby the roadside, and suddenly appeared before them.\n\n'Yes,' said Philip. 'Why, Hester, where have you been?' he asked, as\nthey drew near.\n\nHester reddened a little, and then replied, in her slow, quiet way--\n\n'I've been sitting with Betsy Darley--her that is bed-ridden. It\nwere lonesome for her when the others were away at the burying.'\n\nAnd she made as though she would have passed; but Sylvia, all her\nsympathies alive for the relations of the murdered man, wanted to\nask more questions, and put her hand on Hester's arm to detain her a\nmoment. Hester suddenly drew back a little, reddened still more, and\nthen replied fully and quietly to all Sylvia asked.\n\nIn the agricultural counties, and among the class to which these\nfour persons belonged, there is little analysis of motive or\ncomparison of characters and actions, even at this present day of\nenlightenment. Sixty or seventy years ago there was still less. I do\nnot mean that amongst thoughtful and serious people there was not\nmuch reading of such books as _Mason_ on _Self-Knowledge_ and _Law's\nSerious Call_, or that there were not the experiences of the\nWesleyans, that were related at class-meeting for the edification of\nthe hearers. But, taken as a general ride, it may be said that few\nknew what manner of men they were, compared to the numbers now who\nare fully conscious of their virtues, qualities, failings, and\nweaknesses, and who go about comparing others with themselves--not\nin a spirit of Pharisaism and arrogance, but with a vivid\nself-consciousness that more than anything else deprives characters\nof freshness and originality.\n\nTo return to the party we left standing on the high-raised footway\nthat ran alongside of the bridle-road to Haytersbank. Sylvia had\nleisure in her heart to think 'how good Hester is for sitting with\nthe poor bed-ridden sister of Darley!' without having a pang of\nself-depreciation in the comparison of her own conduct with that she\nwas capable of so fully appreciating. She had gone to church for the\nends of vanity, and remained to the funeral for curiosity and the\npleasure of the excitement. In this way a modern young lady would\nhave condemned herself, and therefore lost the simple, purifying\npleasure of admiration of another.\n\nHester passed onwards, going down the hill towards the town. The\nother three walked slowly on. All were silent for a few moments,\nthen Sylvia said--\n\n'How good she is!'\n\nAnd Philip replied with ready warmth,--\n\n'Yes, she is; no one knows how good but us, who live in the same\nhouse wi' her.'\n\n'Her mother is an old Quakeress, bean't she?' Molly inquired.\n\n'Alice Rose is a Friend, if that is what you mean,' said Philip.\n\n'Well, well! some folk's so particular. Is William Coulson a Quaker,\nby which a mean a Friend?'\n\n'Yes; they're all on 'em right-down good folk.'\n\n'Deary me! What a wonder yo' can speak to such sinners as Sylvia and\nme, after keepin' company with so much goodness,' said Molly, who\nhad not yet forgiven Philip for doubting Kinraid's power of killing\nmen. 'Is na' it, Sylvia?'\n\nBut Sylvia was too highly strung for banter. If she had not been one\nof those who went to mock, but remained to pray, she had gone to\nchurch with the thought of the cloak-that-was-to-be uppermost in her\nmind, and she had come down the long church stair with life and\ndeath suddenly become real to her mind, the enduring sea and hills\nforming a contrasting background to the vanishing away of man. She\nwas full of a solemn wonder as to the abiding-place of the souls of\nthe dead, and a childlike dread lest the number of the elect should\nbe accomplished before she was included therein. How people could\never be merry again after they had been at a funeral, she could not\nimagine; so she answered gravely, and slightly beside the question:\n\n'I wonder if I was a Friend if I should be good?'\n\n'Gi' me your red cloak, that's all, when yo' turn Quaker; they'll\nnone let thee wear scarlet, so it 'll be of no use t' thee.'\n\n'I think thou'rt good enough as thou art,' said Philip, tenderly--at\nleast as tenderly as he durst, for he knew by experience that it did\nnot do to alarm her girlish coyness. Either one speech or the other\nmade Sylvia silent; neither was accordant to her mood of mind; so\nperhaps both contributed to her quietness.\n\n'Folk say William Coulson looks sweet on Hester Rose,' said Molly,\nalways up in Monkshaven gossip. It was in the form of an assertion,\nbut was said in the tone of a question, and as such Philip replied\nto it.\n\n'Yes, I think he likes her a good deal; but he's so quiet, I never\nfeel sure. John and Jeremiah would like the match, I've a notion.'\n\nAnd now they came to the stile which had filled Philip's eye for\nsome minutes past, though neither of the others had perceived they\nwere so near it; the stile which led to Moss Brow from the road into\nthe fields that sloped down to Haystersbank. Here they would leave\nMolly, and now would begin the delicious _tete-a-tete_ walk, which\nPhilip always tried to make as lingering as possible. To-day he was\nanxious to show his sympathy with Sylvia, as far as he could read\nwhat was passing in her mind; but how was he to guess the multitude\nof tangled thoughts in that unseen receptacle? A resolution to be\ngood, if she could, and always to be thinking on death, so that what\nseemed to her now as simply impossible, might come true--that she\nmight 'dread the grave as little as her bed'; a wish that Philip\nwere not coming home with her; a wonder if the specksioneer really\nhad killed a man, an idea which made her shudder; yet from the awful\nfascination about it, her imagination was compelled to dwell on the\ntall, gaunt figure, and try to recall the wan countenance; a hatred\nand desire of revenge on the press-gang, so vehement that it sadly\nmilitated against her intention of trying to be good; all these\nnotions, and wonders, and fancies, were whirling about in Sylvia's\nbrain, and at one of their promptings she spoke,--\n\n'How many miles away is t' Greenland seas?--I mean, how long do they\ntake to reach?'\n\n'I don't know; ten days or a fortnight, or more, maybe. I'll ask.'\n\n'Oh! feyther 'll tell me all about it. He's been there many a time.'\n\n'I say, Sylvie! My aunt said I were to give you lessons this winter\ni' writing and ciphering. I can begin to come up now, two evenings,\nmaybe, a week. T' shop closes early after November comes in.'\n\nSylvia did not like learning, and did not want him for her teacher;\nso she answered in a dry little tone,--\n\n'It'll use a deal o' candle-light; mother 'll not like that. I can't\nsee to spell wi'out a candle close at my elbow.'\n\n'Niver mind about candles. I can bring up a candle wi' me, for I\nshould be burning one at Alice Rose's.'\n\nSo that excuse would not do. Sylvia beat her brains for another.\n\n'Writing cramps my hand so, I can't do any sewing for a day after;\nand feyther wants his shirts very bad.'\n\n'But, Sylvia, I'll teach you geography, and ever such a vast o' fine\nthings about t' countries, on t' map.'\n\n'Is t' Arctic seas down on t' map?' she asked, in a tone of greater\ninterest.\n\n'Yes! Arctics, and tropics, and equator, and equinoctial line; we'll\ntake 'em turn and turn about; we'll do writing and ciphering one\nnight, and geography t' other.'\n\nPhilip spoke with pleasure at the prospect, but Sylvia relaxed into\nindifference.\n\n'I'm no scholard; it's like throwing away labour to teach me, I'm\nsuch a dunce at my book. Now there's Betsy Corney, third girl, her\nas is younger than Molly, she'd be a credit to you. There niver was\nsuch a lass for pottering ower books.'\n\nIf Philip had had his wits about him, he would have pretended to\nlisten to this proposition of a change of pupils, and then possibly\nSylvia might have repented making it. But he was too much mortified\nto be diplomatic.\n\n'My aunt asked me to teach _you_ a bit, not any neighbour's lass.'\n\n'Well! if I mun be taught, I mun; but I'd rayther be whipped and ha'\ndone with it,' was Sylvia's ungracious reply.\n\nA moment afterwards, she repented of her little spirit of\nunkindness, and thought that she should not like to die that night\nwithout making friends. Sudden death was very present in her\nthoughts since the funeral. So she instinctively chose the best\nmethod of making friends again, and slipped her hand into his, as he\nwalked a little sullenly at her side. She was half afraid, however,\nwhen she found it firmly held, and that she could not draw it away\nagain without making what she called in her own mind a 'fuss.' So,\nhand in hand, they slowly and silently came up to the door of\nHaytersbank Farm; not unseen by Bell Robson, who sate in the\nwindow-seat, with her Bible open upon her knee. She had read her\nchapter aloud to herself, and now she could see no longer, even if\nshe had wished to read more; but she gazed out into the darkening\nair, and a dim look of contentment came like moonshine over her face\nwhen she saw the cousins approach.\n\n'That's my prayer day and night,' said she to herself.\n\nBut there was no unusual aspect of gladness on her face, as she\nlighted the candle to give them a more cheerful welcome.\n\n'Wheere's feyther?' said Sylvia, looking round the room for Daniel.\n\n'He's been to Kirk Moorside Church, for t' see a bit o' th' world,\nas he ca's it. And sin' then he's gone out to th' cattle; for\nKester's ta'en his turn of playing hissel', now that father's\nbetter.'\n\n'I've been talking to Sylvia,' said Philip, his head still full of\nhis pleasant plan, his hand still tingling from the touch of hers,\n'about turning schoolmaster, and coming up here two nights a week for\nt' teach her a bit o' writing and ciphering.'\n\n'And geography,' put in Sylvia; 'for,' thought she, 'if I'm to learn\nthem things I don't care a pin about, anyhow I'll learn what I do\ncare to know, if it 'll tell me about t' Greenland seas, and how far\nthey're off.'\n\nThat same evening, a trio alike in many outward circumstances sate\nin a small neat room in a house opening out of a confined court on\nthe hilly side of the High Street of Monkshaven--a mother, her only\nchild, and the young man who silently loved that daughter, and was\nfavoured by Alice Rose, though not by Hester.\n\nWhen the latter returned from her afternoon's absence, she stood for\na minute or two on the little flight of steep steps, whitened to a\nsnowy whiteness; the aspect of the whole house partook of the same\ncharacter of irreproachable cleanliness. It was wedged up into a\nspace which necessitated all sorts of odd projections and\nirregularities in order to obtain sufficient light for the interior;\nand if ever the being situated in a dusky, confined corner might\nhave been made an excuse for dirt, Alice Rose's house had that\napology. Yet the small diamond panes of glass in the casement window\nwere kept so bright and clear that a great sweet-scented-leaved\ngeranium grew and flourished, though it did not flower profusely.\nThe leaves seemed to fill the air with fragrance as soon as Hester\nsummoned up energy enough to open the door. Perhaps that was because\nthe young Quaker, William Coulson, was crushing one between his\nfinger and thumb, while waiting to set down Alice's next words. For\nthe old woman, who looked as if many years of life remained in her\nyet, was solemnly dictating her last will and testament.\n\nIt had been on her mind for many months; for she had something to\nleave beyond the mere furniture of the house. Something--a few\npounds--in the hands of John and Jeremiah Foster, her cousins: and\nit was they who had suggested the duty on which she was engaged. She\nhad asked William Coulson to write down her wishes, and he had\nconsented, though with some fear and trepidation; for he had an idea\nthat he was infringing on a lawyer's prerogative, and that, for\naught he knew, he might be prosecuted for making a will without a\nlicence, just as a man might be punished for selling wine and\nspirits without going through the preliminary legal forms that give\npermission for such a sale. But to his suggestion that Alice should\nemploy a lawyer, she had replied--\n\n'That would cost me five pounds sterling; and thee canst do it as\nwell, if thee'll but attend to my words.'\n\nSo he had bought, at her desire, a black-edged sheet of fine-wove\npaper, and a couple of good pens, on the previous Saturday; and\nwhile waiting for her to begin her dictation, and full serious\nthought himself, he had almost unconsciously made the grand flourish\nat the top of the paper which he had learnt at school, and which was\nthere called a spread-eagle.\n\n'What art thee doing there?' asked Alice, suddenly alive to his\nproceedings.\n\nWithout a word he showed her his handiwork.\n\n'It's a vanity,' said she, 'and 't may make t' will not stand. Folk\nmay think I were na in my right mind, if they see such fly-legs and\ncob-webs a-top. Write, \"This is my doing, William Coulson, and none\nof Alice Rose's, she being in her sound mind.\"'\n\n'I don't think it's needed,' said William. Nevertheless he wrote\ndown the words.\n\n'Hast thee put that I'm in my sound mind and seven senses? Then make\nthe sign of the Trinity, and write, \"In the name of the Father, the\nSon, and the Holy Ghost.\"'\n\n'Is that the right way o' beginning a will?' said Coulson, a little\nstartled.\n\n'My father, and my father's father, and my husband had it a-top of\ntheirs, and I'm noane going for to cease fra' following after them,\nfor they were godly men, though my husband were o' t' episcopal\npersuasion.'\n\n'It's done,' said William.\n\n'Hast thee dated it?' asked Alice.\n\n'Nay.'\n\n'Then date it third day, ninth month. Now, art ready?'\n\nCoulson nodded.\n\n'I, Alice Rose, do leave my furniture (that is, my bed and chest o'\ndrawers, for thy bed and things is thine, and not mine), and settle,\nand saucepans, and dresser, and table, and kettle, and all the rest\nof my furniture, to my lawful and only daughter, Hester Rose. I\nthink that's safe for her to have all, is 't not, William?'\n\n'I think so, too,' said he, writing on all the time.\n\n'And thee shalt have t' roller and paste-board, because thee's so\nfond o' puddings and cakes. It 'll serve thy wife after I'm gone,\nand I trust she'll boil her paste long enough, for that's been t'\nsecret o' mine, and thee'll noane be so easy t' please.'\n\n'I din't reckon on marriage,' said William.\n\n'Thee'll marry,' said Alice. 'Thee likes to have thy victuals hot\nand comfortable; and there's noane many but a wife as'll look after\nthat for t' please thee.'\n\n'I know who could please me,' sighed forth William, 'but I can't\nplease her.'\n\nAlice looked sharply at him from over her spectacles, which she had\nput on the better to think about the disposal of her property.\n\n'Thee art thinking on our Hester,' said she, plainly out.\n\nHe started a little, but looked up at her and met her eyes.\n\n'Hester cares noane for me,' said he, dejectedly.\n\n'Bide a while, my lad,' said Alice, kindly. 'Young women don't\nalways know their own minds. Thee and her would make a marriage\nafter my own heart; and the Lord has been very good to me hitherto,\nand I think He'll bring it t' pass. But don't thee let on as thee\ncares for her so much. I sometimes think she wearies o' thy looks\nand thy ways. Show up thy manly heart, and make as though thee had\nmuch else to think on, and no leisure for to dawdle after her, and\nshe'll think a deal more on thee. And now mend thy pen for a fresh\nstart. I give and bequeath--did thee put \"give and bequeath,\" at th'\nbeginning?'\n\n'Nay,' said William, looking back. 'Thee didst not tell me \"give and\nbequeath!\"'\n\n'Then it won't be legal, and my bit o' furniture 'll be taken to\nLondon, and put into chancery, and Hester will have noane on it.'\n\n'I can write it over,' said William.\n\n'Well, write it clear then, and put a line under it to show those\nare my special words. Hast thee done it? Then now start afresh. I\ngive and bequeath my book o' sermons, as is bound in good calfskin,\nand lies on the third shelf o' corner cupboard at the right hand o'\nt' fire-place, to Philip Hepburn; for I reckon he's as fond o'\nreading sermons as thee art o' light, well-boiled paste, and I'd be\nglad for each on ye to have somewhat ye like for to remember me by.\nIs that down? There; now for my cousins John and Jeremiah. They are\nrich i' world's gear, but they'll prize what I leave 'em if I could\nonly onbethink me what they would like. Hearken! Is na' that our\nHester's step? Put it away, quick! I'm noane for grieving her wi'\ntelling her what I've been about. We'll take a turn at t' will next\nFirst Day; it will serve us for several Sabbaths to come, and maybe\nI can think on something as will suit cousin John and cousin\nJeremiah afore then.'\n\nHester, as was mentioned, paused a minute or two before lifting the\nlatch of the door. When she entered there was no unusual sign of\nwriting about; only Will Coulson looking very red, and crushing and\nsmelling at the geranium leaf.\n\nHester came in briskly, with the little stock of enforced\ncheerfulness she had stopped at the door to acquire. But it faded\naway along with the faint flush of colour in her cheeks; and the\nmother's quick eye immediately noted the wan heavy look of care.\n\n'I have kept t' pot in t' oven; it'll have a'most got a' t' goodness\nout of t' tea by now, for it'll be an hour since I made it. Poor\nlass, thou look'st as if thou needed a good cup o' tea. It were dree\nwork sitting wi' Betsy Darley, were it? And how does she look on her\naffliction?'\n\n'She takes it sore to heart,' said Hester, taking off her hat, and\nfolding and smoothing away her cloak, before putting them in the\ngreat oak chest (or 'ark,' as it was called), in which they were\nlaid from Sunday to Sunday.\n\nAs she opened the lid a sweet scent of dried lavender and\nrose-leaves came out. William stepped hastily forwards to hold up\nthe heavy lid for her. She lifted up her head, looked at him full\nwith her serene eyes, and thanked him for his little service. Then\nshe took a creepie-stool and sate down on the side of the\nfire-place, having her back to the window.\n\nThe hearth was of the same spotless whiteness as the steps; all that\nwas black about the grate was polished to the utmost extent; all\nthat was of brass, like the handle of the oven, was burnished\nbright. Her mother placed the little black earthenware teapot, in\nwhich the tea had been stewing, on the table, where cups and saucers\nwere already set for four, and a large plate of bread and butter\ncut. Then they sate round the table, bowed their heads, and kept\nsilence for a minute or two.\n\nWhen this grace was ended, and they were about to begin, Alice said,\nas if without premeditation, but in reality with a keen shrinking of\nheart out of sympathy with her child--\n\n'Philip would have been in to his tea by now, I reckon, if he'd been\ncoming.'\n\nWilliam looked up suddenly at Hester; her mother carefully turned\nher head another way. But she answered quite quietly--\n\n'He'll be gone to his aunt's at Haytersbank. I met him at t' top o'\nt' Brow, with his cousin and Molly Corney.'\n\n'He's a deal there,' said William.\n\n'Yes,' said Hester. 'It's likely; him and his aunt come from\nCarlisle-way, and must needs cling together in these strange parts.'\n\n'I saw him at the burying of yon Darley,' said William.\n\n'It were a vast o' people went past th' entry end,' said Alice. 'It\nwere a'most like election time; I were just come back fra' meeting\nwhen they were all going up th' church steps. I met yon sailor as,\nthey say, used violence and did murder; he looked like a ghost,\nthough whether it were his bodily wounds, or the sense of his sins\nstirring within him, it's not for me to say. And by t' time I was\nback here and settled to my Bible, t' folk were returning, and it\nwere tramp, tramp, past th' entry end for better nor a quarter of an\nhour.'\n\n'They say Kinraid has getten slugs and gun-shot in his side,' said\nHester.\n\n'He's niver one Charley Kinraid, for sure, as I knowed at\nNewcastle,' said William Coulson, roused to sudden and energetic\ncuriosity.\n\n'I don't know,' replied Hester; 'they call him just Kinraid; and\nBetsy Darley says he's t' most daring specksioneer of all that go\noff this coast to t' Greenland seas. But he's been in Newcastle, for\nI mind me she said her poor brother met with him there.'\n\n'How didst thee come to know him?' inquired Alice.\n\n'I cannot abide him if it is Charley,' said William. 'He kept\ncompany with my poor sister as is dead for better nor two year, and\nthen he left off coming to see her and went wi' another girl, and it\njust broke her heart.'\n\n'He don't look now as if he iver could play at that game again,'\nsaid Alice; 'he has had a warning fra' the Lord. Whether it be a\ncall no one can tell. But to my eyne he looks as if he had been\ncalled, and was going.'\n\n'Then he'll meet my sister,' said William, solemnly; 'and I hope the\nLord will make it clear to him, then, how he killed her, as sure as\nhe shot down yon sailors; an' if there's a gnashing o' teeth for\nmurder i' that other place, I reckon he'll have his share on't. He's\na bad man yon.'\n\n'Betsy said he were such a friend to her brother as niver was; and\nhe's sent her word and promised to go and see her, first place he\ngoes out to.\n\nBut William only shook his head, and repeated his last words,--\n\n'He's a bad man, he is.'\n\nWhen Philip came home that Sunday night, he found only Alice up to\nreceive him. The usual bedtime in the household was nine o'clock,\nand it was but ten minutes past the hour; but Alice looked\ndispleased and stern.\n\n'Thee art late, lad,' said she, shortly.\n\n'I'm sorry; it's a long way from my uncle's, and I think clocks are\ndifferent,' said he, taking out his watch to compare it with the\nround moon's face that told the time to Alice.\n\n'I know nought about thy uncle's, but thee art late. Take thy\ncandle, and begone.'\n\nIf Alice made any reply to Philip's 'good-night,' he did not hear\nit.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\nATTRACTION AND REPULSION\n\n\nA fortnight had passed over and winter was advancing with rapid\nstrides. In bleak northern farmsteads there was much to be done\nbefore November weather should make the roads too heavy for half-fed\nhorses to pull carts through. There was the turf, pared up on the\ndistant moors, and left out to dry, to be carried home and stacked;\nthe brown fern was to be stored up for winter bedding for the\ncattle; for straw was scarce and dear in those parts; even for\nthatching, heather (or rather ling) was used. Then there was meat to\nsalt while it could be had; for, in default of turnips and\nmangold-wurzel, there was a great slaughtering of barren cows as\nsoon as the summer herbage failed; and good housewives stored up\ntheir Christmas piece of beef in pickle before Martinmas was over.\nCorn was to be ground while yet it could be carried to the distant\nmill; the great racks for oat-cake, that swung at the top of the\nkitchen, had to be filled. And last of all came the pig-killing,\nwhen the second frost set in. For up in the north there is an idea\nthat the ice stored in the first frost will melt, and the meat cured\nthen taint; the first frost is good for nothing but to be thrown\naway, as they express it.\n\nThere came a breathing-time after this last event. The house had had\nits last autumn cleaning, and was neat and bright from top to\nbottom, from one end to another. The turf was led; the coal carted\nup from Monkshaven; the wood stored; the corn ground; the pig\nkilled, and the hams and head and hands lying in salt. The butcher\nhad been glad to take the best parts of a pig of Dame Robson's\ncareful feeding; but there was unusual plenty in the Haytersbank\npantry; and as Bell surveyed it one morning, she said to her husband--\n\n'I wonder if yon poor sick chap at Moss Brow would fancy some o' my\nsausages. They're something to crack on, for they are made fra' an\nold Cumberland receipt, as is not known i' Yorkshire yet.'\n\n'Thou's allays so set upo' Cumberland ways!' said her husband, not\ndispleased with the suggestion, however. 'Still, when folk's sick\nthey han their fancies, and maybe Kinraid 'll be glad o' thy\nsausages. I ha' known sick folk tak' t' eating snails.'\n\nThis was not complimentary, perhaps. But Daniel went on to say that\nhe did not mind if he stepped over with the sausages himself, when\nit was too late to do anything else. Sylvia longed to offer to\naccompany her father; but, somehow, she did not like to propose it.\nTowards dusk she came to her mother to ask for the key of the great\nbureau that stood in the house-place as a state piece of furniture,\nalthough its use was to contain the family's best wearing apparel,\nand stores of linen, such as might be supposed to be more needed\nupstairs.\n\n'What for do yo' want my keys?' asked Bell.\n\n'Only just to get out one of t' damask napkins.'\n\n'The best napkins, as my mother span?'\n\n'Yes!' said Sylvia, her colour heightening. 'I thought as how it\nwould set off t' sausages.'\n\n'A good clean homespun cloth will serve them better,' said Bell,\nwondering in her own mind what was come over the girl, to be\nthinking of setting off sausages that were to be eaten, not to be\nlooked at like a picture-book. She might have wondered still more,\nif she had seen Sylvia steal round to the little flower border she\nhad persuaded Kester to make under the wall at the sunny side of the\nhouse, and gather the two or three Michaelmas daisies, and the one\nbud of the China rose, that, growing against the kitchen chimney,\nhad escaped the frost; and then, when her mother was not looking,\nsoftly open the cloth inside of the little basket that contained the\nsausages and a fresh egg or two, and lay her autumn blossoms in one\nof the folds of the towel.\n\nAfter Daniel, now pretty clear of his rheumatism, had had his\nafternoon meal (tea was a Sunday treat), he prepared to set out on\nhis walk to Moss Brow; but as he was taking his stick he caught the\nlook on Sylvia's face; and unconsciously interpreted its dumb\nwistfulness.\n\n'Missus,' said he, 't' wench has nought more t' do, has she? She may\nas well put on her cloak and step down wi' me, and see Molly a bit;\nshe'll be company like.'\n\nBell considered.\n\n'There's t' yarn for thy stockings as is yet to spin; but she can\ngo, for I'll do a bit at 't mysel', and there's nought else agate.'\n\n'Put on thy things in a jiffy, then, and let's be off,' said Daniel.\n\nAnd Sylvia did not need another word. Down she came in a twinkling,\ndressed in her new red cloak and hood, her face peeping out of the\nfolds of the latter, bright and blushing.\n\n'Thou should'st na' ha' put on thy new cloak for a night walk to\nMoss Brow,' said Bell, shaking her head.\n\n'Shall I go take it off, and put on my shawl?' asked Sylvia, a\nlittle dolefully.\n\n'Na, na, come along! a'm noane goin' for t' wait o' women's chops\nand changes. Come along; come, Lassie!' (this last to his dog).\n\nSo Sylvia set off with a dancing heart and a dancing step, that had\nto be restrained to the sober gait her father chose. The sky above\nwas bright and clear with the light of a thousand stars, the grass\nwas crisping under their feet with the coming hoar frost; and as\nthey mounted to the higher ground they could see the dark sea\nstretching away far below them. The night was very still, though now\nand then crisp sounds in the distant air sounded very near in the\nsilence. Sylvia carried the basket, and looked like little Red\nRiding Hood. Her father had nothing to say, and did not care to make\nhimself agreeable; but Sylvia enjoyed her own thoughts, and any\nconversation would have been a disturbance to her. The long\nmonotonous roll of the distant waves, as the tide bore them in, the\nmultitudinous rush at last, and then the retreating rattle and\ntrickle, as the baffled waters fell back over the shingle that\nskirted the sands, and divided them from the cliffs; her father's\nmeasured tread, and slow, even movement; Lassie's pattering--all\nlulled Sylvia into a reverie, of which she could not have given\nherself any definite account. But at length they arrived at Moss\nBrow, and with a sudden sigh she quitted the subjects of her dreamy\nmeditations, and followed her father into the great house-place. It\nhad a more comfortable aspect by night than by day. The fire was\nalways kept up to a wasteful size, and the dancing blaze and the\npartial light of candles left much in shadow that was best ignored\nin such a disorderly family. But there was always a warm welcome to\nfriends, however roughly given; and after the words of this were\nspoken, the next rose up equally naturally in the mind of Mrs\nCorney.\n\n'And what will ye tak'? Eh! but t' measter 'll be fine and vexed at\nyour comin' when he's away. He's off to Horncastle t' sell some\ncolts, and he'll not be back till to-morrow's neet. But here's\nCharley Kinraid as we've getten to nurse up a bit, and' t' lads 'll\nbe back fra' Monkshaven in a crack o' no time.'\n\nAll this was addressed to Daniel, to whom she knew that none but\nmasculine company would be acceptable. Amongst uneducated\npeople--whose range of subjects and interest do not extend beyond\ntheir daily life--it is natural that when the first blush and hurry\nof youth is over, there should be no great pleasure in the\nconversation of the other sex. Men have plenty to say to men, which\nin their estimation (gained from tradition and experience) women\ncannot understand; and farmers of a much later date than the one of\nwhich I am writing, would have contemptuously considered it as a\nloss of time to talk to women; indeed, they were often more\ncommunicative to the sheep-dog that accompanied them through all the\nday's work, and frequently became a sort of dumb confidant. Farmer\nRobson's Lassie now lay down at her master's feet, placed her nose\nbetween her paws, and watched with attentive eyes the preparations\ngoing on for refreshments--preparations which, to the\ndisappointment of her canine heart, consisted entirely of tumblers\nand sugar.\n\n'Where's t' wench?' said Robson, after he had shaken hands with\nKinraid, and spoken a few words to him and to Mrs. Corney. 'She's\ngetten' a basket wi' sausages in 'em, as my missus has made, and\nshe's a rare hand at sausages; there's noane like her in a' t' three\nRidings, I'll be bound!'\n\nFor Daniel could praise his wife's powers in her absence, though he\ndid not often express himself in an appreciative manner when she was\nby to hear. But Sylvia's quick sense caught up the manner in which\nMrs. Corney would apply the way in which her mother's housewifery had\nbeen exalted, and stepping forwards out of the shadow, she said,--\n\n'Mother thought, maybe, you hadn't killed a pig yet, and sausages is\nalways a bit savoury for any one who is na' well, and----'\n\nShe might have gone on but that she caught Kinraid's eyes looking at\nher with kindly admiration. She stopped speaking, and Mrs. Corney\ntook up the word--\n\n'As for sausages, I ha' niver had a chance this year, else I stand\nagain any one for t' making of 'em. Yorkshire hams 's a vast thought\non, and I'll niver let another county woman say as she can make\nbetter sausages nor me. But, as I'm saying, I'd niver a chance; for\nour pig, as I were sa fond on, and fed mysel', and as would ha' been\nfourteen stone by now if he were an ounce, and as knew me as well as\nany Christian, and a pig, as I may say, that I just idolized, went\nand took a fit a week after Michaelmas Day, and died, as if it had\nbeen to spite me; and t' next is na' ready for killing, nor wunnot\nbe this six week. So I'm much beholden to your missus, and so's\nCharley, I'm sure; though he's ta'en a turn to betterin' sin' he\ncame out here to be nursed.'\n\n'I'm a deal better,' said Kinraid; 'a'most ready for t' press-gang\nto give chase to again.'\n\n'But folk say they're gone off this coast for one while,' added\nDaniel.\n\n'They're gone down towards Hull, as I've been told,' said Kinraid.\n'But they're a deep set, they'll be here before we know where we\nare, some of these days.'\n\n'See thee here!' said Daniel, exhibiting his maimed hand; 'a reckon\na served 'em out time o' t' Ameriky war.' And he began the story\nSylvia knew so well; for her father never made a new acquaintance\nbut what he told him of his self-mutilation to escape the\npress-gang. It had been done, as he would himself have owned, to\nspite himself as well as them; for it had obliged him to leave a\nsea-life, to which, in comparison, all life spent on shore was worse\nthan nothing for dulness. For Robson had never reached that rank\naboard ship which made his being unable to run up the rigging, or to\nthrow a harpoon, or to fire off a gun, of no great consequence; so\nhe had to be thankful that an opportune legacy enabled him to turn\nfarmer, a great degradation in his opinion. But his blood warmed, as\nhe told the specksioneer, towards a sailor, and he pressed Kinraid\nto beguile the time when he was compelled to be ashore, by coming\nover to see him at Haytersbank, whenever he felt inclined.\n\nSylvia, appearing to listen to Molly's confidences, was hearkening\nin reality to all this conversation between her father and the\nspecksioneer; and at this invitation she became especially\nattentive.\n\nKinraid replied,--\n\n'I'm much obliged to ye, I'm sure; maybe I can come and spend an\nev'ning wi' you; but as soon as I'm got round a bit, I must go see\nmy own people as live at Cullercoats near Newcastle-upo'-Tyne.'\n\n'Well, well!' said Daniel, rising to take leave, with unusual\nprudence as to the amount of his drink. 'Thou'lt see, thou'lt see! I\nshall be main glad to see thee; if thou'lt come. But I've na' lads\nto keep thee company, only one sprig of a wench. Sylvia, come here,\nan let's show thee to this young fellow!'\n\nSylvia came forwards, ruddy as any rose, and in a moment Kinraid\nrecognized her as the pretty little girl he had seen crying so\nbitterly over Darley's grave. He rose up out of true sailor's\ngallantry, as she shyly approached and stood by her father's side,\nscarcely daring to lift her great soft eyes, to have one fair gaze\nat his face. He had to support himself by one hand rested on the\ndresser, but she saw he was looking far better--younger, less\nhaggard--than he had seemed to her before. His face was short and\nexpressive; his complexion had been weatherbeaten and bronzed,\nthough now he looked so pale; his eyes and hair were dark,--the\nformer quick, deep-set, and penetrating; the latter curly, and\nalmost in ringlets. His teeth gleamed white as he smiled at her, a\npleasant friendly smile of recognition; but she only blushed the\ndeeper, and hung her head.\n\n'I'll come, sir, and be thankful. I daresay a turn'll do me good, if\nthe weather holds up, an' th' frost keeps on.'\n\n'That's right, my lad,' said Robson, shaking him by the hand, and\nthen Kinraid's hand was held out to Sylvia, and she could not avoid\nthe same friendly action.\n\nMolly Corney followed her to the door, and when they were fairly\noutside, she held Sylvia back for an instant to say,--\n\n'Is na' he a fine likely man? I'm so glad as yo've seen him, for\nhe's to be off next week to Newcastle and that neighbourhood.'\n\n'But he said he'd come to us some night?' asked Sylvia, half in a\nfright.\n\n'Ay, I'll see as he does; never fear. For I should like yo' for to\nknow him a bit. He's a rare talker. I'll mind him o' coming to yo'.'\n\nSomehow, Sylvia felt as if this repeated promise of reminding\nKinraid of his promise to come and see her father took away part of\nthe pleasure she had anticipated from his visit. Yet what could be\nmore natural than that Molly Corney should wish her friend to be\nacquainted with the man whom Sylvia believed to be all but Molly's\nengaged lover?\n\nPondering these thoughts, the walk home was as silent as that going\nto Moss Brow had been. The only change seemed to be that now they\nfaced the brilliant northern lights flashing up the sky, and that\neither this appearance or some of the whaling narrations of Kinraid\nhad stirred up Daniel Robson's recollections of a sea ditty, which\nhe kept singing to himself in a low, unmusical voice, the burden of\nwhich was, 'for I loves the tossin' say!' Bell met them at the door.\n\n'Well, and here ye are at home again! and Philip has been, Sylvie,\nto give thee thy ciphering lesson; and he stayed awhile, thinking\nthou'd be coming back.'\n\n'I'm very sorry,' said Sylvia, more out of deference to her mother's\ntone of annoyance, than because she herself cared either for her\nlesson or her cousin's disappointment.\n\n'He'll come again to-morrow night, he says. But thou must take care,\nand mind the nights he says he'll come, for it's a long way to come\nfor nought.'\n\nSylvia might have repeated her 'I'm very sorry' at this announcement\nof Philip's intentions; but she restrained herself, inwardly and\nfervently hoping that Molly would not urge the fulfilment of the\nspecksioneer's promise for to-morrow night, for Philip's being there\nwould spoil all; and besides, if she sate at the dresser at her\nlesson, and Kinraid at the table with her father, he might hear all,\nand find out what a dunce she was.\n\nShe need not have been afraid. With the next night Hepburn came; and\nKinraid did not. After a few words to her mother, Philip produced\nthe candles he had promised, and some books and a quill or two.\n\n'What for hast thou brought candles?' asked Bell, in a\nhalf-affronted tone.\n\nHepburn smiled.\n\n'Sylvia thought it would take a deal of candlelight, and was for\nmaking it into a reason not to learn. I should ha' used t' candles\nif I'd stayed at home, so I just brought them wi' me.'\n\n'Then thou may'st just take them back again,' said Bell, shortly,\nblowing out that which he had lighted, and placing one of her own on\nthe dresser instead.\n\nSylvia caught her mother's look of displeasure, and it made her\ndocile for the evening, although she owed her cousin a grudge for\nher enforced good behaviour.\n\n'Now, Sylvia, here's a copy-book wi' t' Tower o' London on it, and\nwe'll fill it wi' as pretty writing as any in t' North Riding.'\n\nSylvia sate quite still, unenlivened by this prospect.\n\n'Here's a pen as 'll nearly write of itsel',' continued Philip,\nstill trying to coax her out her sullenness of manner.\n\nThen he arranged her in the right position.\n\n'Don't lay your head down on your left arm, you'll ne'er see to\nwrite straight.'\n\nThe attitude was changed, but not a word was spoken. Philip began to\ngrow angry at such determined dumbness.\n\n'Are you tired?' asked he, with a strange mixture of crossness and\ntenderness.\n\n'Yes, very,' was her reply.\n\n'But thou ought'st not to be tired,' said Bell, who had not yet got\nover the offence to her hospitality; who, moreover, liked her\nnephew, and had, to boot, a great respect for the learning she had\nnever acquired.\n\n'Mother!' said Sylvia, bursting out, 'what's the use on my writing\n\"Abednego,\" \"Abednego,\" \"Abednego,\" all down a page? If I could see\nt' use on 't, I'd ha' axed father to send me t' school; but I'm none\nwanting to have learning.'\n\n'It's a fine thing, tho', is learning. My mother and my grandmother\nhad it: but th' family came down i' the world, and Philip's mother\nand me, we had none of it; but I ha' set my heart on thy having it,\nchild.'\n\n'My fingers is stiff,' pleaded Sylvia, holding up her little hand\nand shaking it.\n\n'Let us take a turn at spelling, then,' said Philip.\n\n'What's t' use on't?' asked captious Sylvia.\n\n'Why, it helps one i' reading an' writing.'\n\n'And what does reading and writing do for one?'\n\nHer mother gave her another of the severe looks that, quiet woman as\nshe was, she could occasionally bestow upon the refractory, and\nSylvia took her book and glanced down the column Philip pointed out\nto her; but, as she justly considered, one man might point out the\ntask, but twenty could not make her learn it, if she did not choose;\nand she sat herself down on the edge of the dresser, and idly gazed\ninto the fire. But her mother came round to look for something in\nthe drawers of the dresser, and as she passed her daughter she said\nin a low voice--\n\n'Sylvie, be a good lass. I set a deal o' store by learning, and\nfather 'ud never send thee to school, as has stuck by me sore.'\n\nIf Philip, sitting with his back to them, heard these words he was\ndiscreet enough not to show that he heard. And he had his reward;\nfor in a very short time, Sylvia stood before him with her book in\nher hand, prepared to say her spelling. At which he also stood up by\ninstinct, and listened to her slow succeeding letters; helping her\nout, when she looked up at him with a sweet childlike perplexity in\nher face: for a dunce as to book-learning poor Sylvia was and was\nlikely to remain; and, in spite of his assumed office of\nschoolmaster, Philip Hepburn could almost have echoed the words of\nthe lover of Jess MacFarlane--\n\n  I sent my love a letter,\n  But, alas! she canna read,\n  And I lo'e her a' the better.\n\nStill he knew his aunt's strong wish on the subject, and it was very\ndelightful to stand in the relation of teacher to so dear and\npretty, if so wilful, a pupil.\n\nPerhaps it was not very flattering to notice Sylvia's great joy when\nher lessons were over, sadly shortened as they were by Philip's\ndesire not to be too hard upon her. Sylvia danced round to her\nmother, bent her head back, and kissed her face, and then said\ndefyingly to Philip,--\n\n'If iver I write thee a letter it shall just be full of nothing but\n\"Abednego! Abednego! Abednego!\"'\n\nBut at this moment her father came in from a distant expedition on\nthe moors with Kester to look after the sheep he had pasturing there\nbefore the winter set fairly in. He was tired, and so was Lassie,\nand so, too, was Kester, who, lifting his heavy legs one after the\nother, and smoothing down his hair, followed his master into the\nhouse-place, and seating himself on a bench at the farther end of\nthe dresser, patiently awaited the supper of porridge and milk which\nhe shared with his master. Sylvia, meanwhile, coaxed Lassie--poor\nfootsore dog--to her side, and gave her some food, which the\ncreature was almost too tired to eat. Philip made as though he would\nbe going, but Daniel motioned to him to be quiet.\n\n'Sit thee down, lad. As soon as I've had my victual, I want t' hear\na bit o' news.'\n\nSylvia took her sewing and sat at the little round table by her\nmother, sharing the light of the scanty dip-candle. No one spoke.\nEvery one was absorbed in what they were doing. What Philip was\ndoing was, gazing at Sylvia--learning her face off by heart.\n\nWhen every scrap of porridge was cleared out of the mighty bowl,\nKester yawned, and wishing good-night, withdrew to his loft over the\ncow-house. Then Philip pulled out the weekly York paper, and began\nto read the latest accounts of the war then raging. This was giving\nDaniel one of his greatest pleasures; for though he could read\npretty well, yet the double effort of reading and understanding what\nhe read was almost too much for him. He could read, or he could\nunderstand what was read aloud to him; reading was no pleasure, but\nlistening was.\n\nBesides, he had a true John Bullish interest in the war, without\nvery well knowing what the English were fighting for. But in those\ndays, so long as they fought the French for any cause, or for no\ncause at all, every true patriot was satisfied. Sylvia and her\nmother did not care for any such far-extended interest; a little bit\nof York news, the stealing of a few apples out of a Scarborough\ngarden that they knew, was of far more interest to them than all the\nbattles of Nelson and the North.\n\nPhilip read in a high-pitched and unnatural tone of voice, which\ndeprived the words of their reality; for even familiar expressions\ncan become unfamiliar and convey no ideas, if the utterance is\nforced or affected. Philip was somewhat of a pedant; yet there was a\nsimplicity in his pedantry not always to be met with in those who\nare self-taught, and which might have interested any one who cared\nto know with what labour and difficulty he had acquired the\nknowledge which now he prized so highly; reading out Latin\nquotations as easily as if they were English, and taking a pleasure\nin rolling polysyllables, until all at once looking askance at\nSylvia, he saw that her head had fallen back, her pretty rosy lips\nopen, her eyes fast shut; in short, she was asleep.\n\n'Ay,' said Farmer Robson, 'and t' reading has a'most sent me off.\nMother 'd look angry now if I was to tell yo' yo' had a right to a\nkiss; but when I was a young man I'd ha' kissed a pretty girl as I\nsaw asleep, afore yo'd said Jack Robson.'\n\nPhilip trembled at these words, and looked at his aunt. She gave him\nno encouragement, standing up, and making as though she had never\nheard her husband's speech, by extending her hand, and wishing him\n'good-night.' At the noise of the chairs moving over the flag floor,\nSylvia started up, confused and annoyed at her father's laughter.\n\n'Ay, lass; it's iver a good time t' fall asleep when a young fellow\nis by. Here's Philip here as thou'rt bound t' give a pair o' gloves\nto.'\n\nSylvia went like fire; she turned to her mother to read her face.\n\n'It's only father's joke, lass,' said she. 'Philip knows manners too\nwell.'\n\n'He'd better,' said Sylvia, flaming round at him. 'If he'd a touched\nme, I'd niver ha' spoken to him no more.' And she looked even as it\nwas as if she was far from forgiving him.\n\n'Hoots, lass! wenches are brought up sa mim, now-a-days; i' my time\nthey'd ha' thought na' such great harm of a kiss.'\n\n'Good-night, Philip,' said Bell Robson, thinking the conversation\nunseemly.\n\n'Good-night, aunt, good-night, Sylvie!' But Sylvia turned her back\non him, and he could hardly say 'good-night' to Daniel, who had\ncaused such an unpleasant end to an evening that had at one time\nbeen going on so well.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\nTHE SPECKSIONEER\n\n\nA few days after, Farmer Robson left Haytersbank betimes on a\nlongish day's journey, to purchase a horse. Sylvia and her mother\nwere busied with a hundred household things, and the early winter's\nevening closed in upon them almost before they were aware. The\nconsequences of darkness in the country even now are to gather the\nmembers of a family together into one room, and to make them settle\nto some sedentary employment; and it was much more the case at the\nperiod of my story, when candles were far dearer than they are at\npresent, and when one was often made to suffice for a large family.\n\nThe mother and daughter hardly spoke at all when they sat down at\nlast. The cheerful click of the knitting-needles made a pleasant\nhome-sound; and in the occasional snatches of slumber that overcame\nher mother, Sylvia could hear the long-rushing boom of the waves,\ndown below the rocks, for the Haytersbank gulley allowed the sullen\nroar to come up so far inland. It might have been about eight\no'clock--though from the monotonous course of the evening it seemed\nmuch later--when Sylvia heard her father's heavy step cranching down\nthe pebbly path. More unusual, she heard his voice talking to some\ncompanion.\n\nCurious to see who it could be, with a lively instinctive advance\ntowards any event which might break the monotony she had begun to\nfind somewhat dull, she sprang up to open the door. Half a glance\ninto the gray darkness outside made her suddenly timid, and she drew\nback behind the door as she opened it wide to admit her father and\nKinraid.\n\nDaniel Robson came in bright and boisterous. He was pleased with his\npurchase, and had had some drink to celebrate his bargain. He had\nridden the new mare into Monkshaven, and left her at the smithy\nthere until morning, to have her feet looked at, and to be new shod.\nOn his way from the town he had met Kinraid wandering about in\nsearch of Haytersbank Farm itself, so he had just brought him along\nwith him; and here they were, ready for bread and cheese, and aught\nelse the mistress would set before them.\n\nTo Sylvia the sudden change into brightness and bustle occasioned by\nthe entrance of her father and the specksioneer was like that which\nyou may effect any winter's night, when you come into a room where a\ngreat lump of coal lies hot and slumbering on the fire; just break\nit up with a judicious blow from the poker, and the room, late so\ndark, and dusk, and lone, is full of life, and light, and warmth.\n\nShe moved about with pretty household briskness, attending to all\nher father's wants. Kinraid's eye watched her as she went backwards\nand forwards, to and fro, into the pantry, the back-kitchen, out of\nlight into shade, out of the shadow into the broad firelight where\nhe could see and note her appearance. She wore the high-crowned\nlinen cap of that day, surmounting her lovely masses of golden brown\nhair, rather than concealing them, and tied firm to her head by a\nbroad blue ribbon. A long curl hung down on each side of her neck--her\nthroat rather, for her neck was concealed by a little spotted\nhandkerchief carefully pinned across at the waist of her brown stuff\ngown.\n\nHow well it was, thought the young girl, that she had doffed her\nbed-gown and linsey-woolsey petticoat, her working-dress, and made\nherself smart in her stuff gown, when she sate down to work with her\nmother.\n\nBy the time she could sit down again, her father and Kinraid had\ntheir glasses filled, and were talking of the relative merits of\nvarious kinds of spirits; that led on to tales of smuggling, and the\ndifferent contrivances by which they or their friends had eluded the\npreventive service; the nightly relays of men to carry the goods\ninland; the kegs of brandy found by certain farmers whose horses had\ngone so far in the night, that they could do no work the next day;\nthe clever way in which certain women managed to bring in prohibited\ngoods; in fact, that when a woman did give her mind to smuggling,\nshe was more full of resources, and tricks, and impudence, and\nenergy than any man. There was no question of the morality of the\naffair; one of the greatest signs of the real progress we have made\nsince those times seems to be that our daily concerns of buying and\nselling, eating and drinking, whatsoever we do, are more tested by\nthe real practical standard of our religion than they were in the\ndays of our grandfathers. Neither Sylvia nor her mother was in\nadvance of their age. Both listened with admiration to the ingenious\ndevices, and acted as well as spoken lies, that were talked about as\nfine and spirited things. Yet if Sylvia had attempted one tithe of\nthis deceit in her every-day life, it would have half broken her\nmother's heart. But when the duty on salt was strictly and cruelly\nenforced, making it penal to pick up rough dirty lumps containing\nsmall quantities that might be thrown out with the ashes of the\nbrine-houses on the high-roads; when the price of this necessary was\nso increased by the tax upon it as to make it an expensive,\nsometimes an unattainable, luxury to the working man, Government did\nmore to demoralise the popular sense of rectitude and uprightness\nthan heaps of sermons could undo. And the same, though in smaller\nmeasure, was the consequence of many other taxes. It may seem\ncurious to trace up the popular standard of truth to taxation; but I\ndo not think the idea would be so very far-fetched.\n\nFrom smuggling adventures it was easy to pass on to stories of what\nhad happened to Robson, in his youth a sailor in the Greenland seas,\nand to Kinraid, now one of the best harpooners in any whaler that\nsailed off the coast.\n\n'There's three things to be afeared on,' said Robson,\nauthoritatively: 'there's t' ice, that's bad; there's dirty weather,\nthat's worse; and there's whales theirselves, as is t' worst of all;\nleastways, they was i' my days; t' darned brutes may ha' larnt\nbetter manners sin'. When I were young, they could niver be got to\nlet theirsels be harpooned wi'out flounderin' and makin' play wi'\ntheir tales and their fins, till t' say were all in a foam, and t'\nboats' crews was all o'er wi' spray, which i' them latitudes is a\nkind o' shower-bath not needed.'\n\n'Th' whales hasn't mended their manners, as you call it,' said\nKinraid; 'but th' ice is not to be spoken lightly on. I were once in\nth' ship _John_ of Hull, and we were in good green water, and were\nkeen after whales; and ne'er thought harm of a great gray iceberg as\nwere on our lee-bow, a mile or so off; it looked as if it had been\nthere from the days of Adam, and were likely to see th' last man\nout, and it ne'er a bit bigger nor smaller in all them thousands and\nthousands o' years. Well, the fast-boats were out after a fish, and\nI were specksioneer in one; and we were so keen after capturing our\nwhale, that none on us ever saw that we were drifting away from them\nright into deep shadow o' th' iceberg. But we were set upon our\nwhale, and I harpooned it; and as soon as it were dead we lashed its\nfins together, and fastened its tail to our boat; and then we took\nbreath and looked about us, and away from us a little space were th'\nother boats, wi' two other fish making play, and as likely as not to\nbreak loose, for I may say as I were th' best harpooner on board the\n_John_, wi'out saying great things o' mysel'. So I says, \"My lads,\none o' you stay i' th' boat by this fish,\"--the fins o' which, as I\nsaid, I'd reeved a rope through mysel', and which was as dead as\nNoah's grandfather--\"and th' rest on us shall go off and help th'\nother boats wi' their fish.\" For, you see, we had another boat close\nby in order to sweep th' fish. (I suppose they swept fish i' your\ntime, master?)'\n\n'Ay, ay!' said Robson; 'one boat lies still holding t' end o' t'\nline; t' other makes a circuit round t' fish.'\n\n'Well! luckily for us we had our second boat, for we all got into\nit, ne'er a man on us was left i' th' fast-boat. And says I, \"But\nwho's to stay by t' dead fish?\" And no man answered, for they were\nall as keen as me for to go and help our mates; and we thought as we\ncould come back to our dead fish, as had a boat for a buoy, once we\nhad helped our mates. So off we rowed, every man Jack on us, out o'\nthe black shadow o' th' iceberg, as looked as steady as th'\npole-star. Well! we had na' been a dozen fathoms away fra' th' boat\nas we had left, when crash! down wi' a roaring noise, and then a\ngulp of the deep waters, and then a shower o' blinding spray; and\nwhen we had wiped our eyes clear, and getten our hearts down agen\nfra' our mouths, there were never a boat nor a glittering belly o'\ne'er a great whale to be seen; but th' iceberg were there, still and\ngrim, as if a hundred ton or more had fallen off all in a mass, and\ncrushed down boat, and fish, and all, into th' deep water, as goes\nhalf through the earth in them latitudes. Th' coal-miners round\nabout Newcastle way may come upon our good boat if they mine deep\nenough, else ne'er another man will see her. And I left as good a\nclasp-knife in her as ever I clapt eyes on.'\n\n'But what a mercy no man stayed in her,' said Bell.\n\n'Why, mistress, I reckon we a' must die some way; and I'd as soon go\ndown into the deep waters as be choked up wi' moulds.'\n\n'But it must be so cold,' said Sylvia, shuddering and giving a\nlittle poke to the fire to warm her fancy.\n\n'Cold!' said her father, 'what do ye stay-at-homes know about cold,\na should like to know? If yo'd been where a were once, north\nlatitude 81, in such a frost as ye ha' niver known, no, not i' deep\nwinter, and it were June i' them seas, and a whale i' sight, and a\nwere off in a boat after her: an' t' ill-mannered brute, as soon as\nshe were harpooned, ups wi' her big awkward tail, and struck t' boat\ni' her stern, and chucks me out into t' watter. That were cold, a\ncan tell the'! First, I smarted all ower me, as if my skin were\nsuddenly stript off me: and next, ivery bone i' my body had getten\nt' toothache, and there were a great roar i' my ears, an' a great\ndizziness i' my eyes; an' t' boat's crew kept throwin' out their\noars, an' a kept clutchin' at 'em, but a could na' make out where\nthey was, my eyes dazzled so wi' t' cold, an' I thought I were bound\nfor \"kingdom come,\" an' a tried to remember t' Creed, as a might die\na Christian. But all a could think on was, \"What is your name, M or\nN?\" an' just as a were giving up both words and life, they heaved me\naboard. But, bless ye, they had but one oar; for they'd thrown a' t'\nothers after me; so yo' may reckon, it were some time afore we could\nreach t' ship; an' a've heerd tell, a were a precious sight to look\non, for my clothes was just hard frozen to me, an' my hair a'most as\nbig a lump o' ice as yon iceberg he was a-telling us on; they rubbed\nme as missus theere were rubbing t' hams yesterday, and gav' me\nbrandy; an' a've niver getten t' frost out o' my bones for a' their\nrubbin', and a deal o' brandy as I 'ave ta'en sin'. Talk o' cold!\nit's little yo' women known o' cold!'\n\n'But there's heat, too, i' some places,' said Kinraid. I was once a\nvoyage i' an American. They goes for th' most part south, to where\nyou come round to t' cold again; and they'll stay there for three\nyear at a time, if need be, going into winter harbour i' some o' th'\nPacific Islands. Well, we were i' th' southern seas, a-seeking for\ngood whaling-ground; and, close on our larboard beam, there were a\ngreat wall o' ice, as much as sixty feet high. And says our\ncaptain--as were a dare-devil, if ever a man were--\"There'll be an\nopening in yon dark gray wall, and into that opening I'll sail, if I\ncoast along it till th' day o' judgment.\" But, for all our sailing,\nwe never seemed to come nearer to th' opening. The waters were\nrocking beneath us, and the sky were steady above us; and th' ice\nrose out o' the waters, and seemed to reach up into the sky. We\nsailed on, and we sailed on, for more days nor I could count. Our\ncaptain were a strange, wild man, but once he looked a little pale\nwhen he came upo' deck after his turn-in, and saw the green-gray ice\ngoing straight up on our beam. Many on us thought as the ship were\nbewitched for th' captain's words; and we got to speak low, and to\nsay our prayers o' nights, and a kind o' dull silence came into th'\nvery air; our voices did na' rightly seem our own. And we sailed on,\nand we sailed on. All at once, th' man as were on watch gave a cry:\nhe saw a break in the ice, as we'd begun to think were everlasting;\nand we all gathered towards the bows, and the captain called to th'\nman at the helm to keep her course, and cocked his head, and began\nto walk the quarter-deck jaunty again. And we came to a great cleft\nin th' long weary rock of ice; and the sides o' th' cleft were not\njagged, but went straight sharp down into th' foaming waters. But we\ntook but one look at what lay inside, for our captain, with a loud\ncry to God, bade the helmsman steer nor'ards away fra' th' mouth o'\nHell. We all saw wi' our own eyes, inside that fearsome wall o'\nice--seventy miles long, as we could swear to--inside that gray,\ncold ice, came leaping flames, all red and yellow wi' heat o' some\nunearthly kind out o' th' very waters o' the sea; making our eyes\ndazzle wi' their scarlet blaze, that shot up as high, nay, higher\nthan th' ice around, yet never so much as a shred on 't was melted.\nThey did say that some beside our captain saw the black devils dart\nhither and thither, quicker than the very flames themselves; anyhow,\nhe saw them. And as he knew it were his own daring as had led him to\nhave that peep at terrors forbidden to any on us afore our time, he\njust dwined away, and we hadn't taken but one whale afore our\ncaptain died, and first mate took th' command. It were a prosperous\nvoyage; but, for all that, I'll never sail those seas again, nor\never take wage aboard an American again.'\n\n'Eh, dear! but it's awful t' think o' sitting wi' a man that has\nseen th' doorway into hell,' said Bell, aghast.\n\nSylvia had dropped her work, and sat gazing at Kinraid with\nfascinated wonder.\n\nDaniel was just a little annoyed at the admiration which his own\nwife and daughter were bestowing on the specksioneer's wonderful\nstories, and he said--\n\n'Ay, ay. If a'd been a talker, ye'd ha' thought a deal more on me\nnor ye've iver done yet. A've seen such things, and done such\nthings.'\n\n'Tell us, father!' said Sylvia, greedy and breathless.\n\n'Some on 'em is past telling,' he replied, 'an some is not to be had\nfor t' asking, seeing as how they might bring a man into trouble.\nBut, as a said, if a had a fancy to reveal all as is on my mind a\ncould make t' hair on your heads lift up your caps--well, we'll say\nan inch, at least. Thy mother, lass, has heerd one or two on 'em.\nThou minds the story o' my ride on a whale's back, Bell? That'll\nmaybe be within this young fellow's comprehension o' t' danger;\nthou's heerd me tell it, hastn't ta?'\n\n'Yes,' said Bell; 'but it's a long time ago; when we was courting.'\n\n'An' that's afore this young lass were born, as is a'most up to\nwoman's estate. But sin' those days a ha' been o'er busy to tell\nstories to my wife, an' as a'll warrant she's forgotten it; an' as\nSylvia here niver heerd it, if yo'll fill your glass, Kinraid, yo'\nshall ha' t' benefit o't.\n\n'A were a specksioneer mysel, though, after that, a rayther directed\nmy talents int' t' smuggling branch o' my profession; but a were\nonce a whaling aboord t' _Ainwell_ of Whitby. An' we was anchored\noff t' coast o' Greenland one season, an' we'd getten a cargo o'\nseven whale; but our captain he were a keen-eyed chap, an' niver\nabove doin' any man's work; an' once seein' a whale he throws\nhimself int' a boat an' goes off to it, makin' signals to me, an'\nanother specksioneer as were off for diversion i' another boat, for\nto come after him sharp. Well, afore we comes alongside, captain had\nharpooned t' fish; an' says he, \"Now, Robson, all ready! give into\nher again when she comes to t' top;\" an' I stands up, right leg\nforemost, harpoon all ready, as soon as iver I cotched a sight o' t'\nwhale, but niver a fin could a see. 'Twere no wonder, for she were\nright below t' boat in which a were; and when she wanted to rise,\nwhat does t' great ugly brute do but come wi' her head, as is like\ncast iron, up bang again t' bottom o' t' boat. I were thrown up in\nt' air like a shuttlecock, me an' my line an' my harpoon--up we\ngoes, an' many a good piece o' timber wi' us, an' many a good fellow\ntoo; but a had t' look after mysel', an a were up high i' t' air,\nafore I could say Jack Robinson, an' a thowt a were safe for another\ndive int' saut water; but i'stead a comes down plump on t' back o'\nt' whale. Ay! yo' may stare, master, but theere a were, an' main an'\nslippery it were, only a sticks my harpoon intil her an' steadies\nmysel', an' looks abroad o'er t' vast o' waves, and gets sea-sick in\na manner, an' puts up a prayer as she mayn't dive, and it were as\ngood a prayer for wishin' it might come true as iver t' clargyman\nan' t' clerk too puts up i' Monkshaven church. Well, a reckon it\nwere heerd, for all a were i' them north latitudes, for she keeps\nsteady, an' a does my best for t' keep steady; an' 'deed a was too\nsteady, for a was fast wi' t' harpoon line, all knotted and tangled\nabout me. T' captain, he sings out for me to cut it; but it's easy\nsingin' out, and it's noane so easy fumblin' for your knife i' t'\npocket o' your drawers, when yo've t' hold hard wi' t' other hand on\nt' back of a whale, swimmin' fourteen knots an hour. At last a\nthinks to mysel' a can't get free o' t' line, and t' line is fast to\nt' harpoon, and t' harpoon is fast to t' whale; and t' whale may go\ndown fathoms deep wheniver t' maggot stirs i' her head; an' t'\nwatter's cold, an noane good for drownin' in; a can't get free o' t'\nline, and a connot get my knife out o' my breeches pocket though t'\ncaptain should ca' it mutiny to disobey orders, and t' line's fast\nto t' harpoon--let's see if t' harpoon's fast to t' whale. So a\ntugged, and a lugged, and t' whale didn't mistake it for ticklin',\nbut she cocks up her tail, and throws out showers o' water as were\nice or iver it touched me; but a pulls on at t' shank, an' a were\nonly afeard as she wouldn't keep at t' top wi' it sticking in her;\nbut at last t' harpoon broke, an' just i' time, for a reckon she was\nnear as tired o' me as a were on her, and down she went; an' a had\nhard work to make for t' boats as was near enough to catch me; for\nwhat wi' t' whale's being but slippery an' t' watter being cold, an'\nme hampered wi' t' line an' t' piece o' harpoon, it's a chance,\nmissus, as thou had stopped an oud maid.'\n\n'Eh dear a' me!' said Bell, 'how well I mind yo'r telling me that\ntale! It were twenty-four year ago come October. I thought I never\ncould think enough on a man as had rode on a whale's back!'\n\n'Yo' may learn t' way of winnin' t' women,' said Daniel, winking at\nthe specksioneer.\n\nAnd Kinraid immediately looked at Sylvia. It was no premeditated\naction; it came as naturally as wakening in the morning when his\nsleep was ended; but Sylvia coloured as red as any rose at his\nsudden glance,--coloured so deeply that he looked away until he\nthought she had recovered her composure, and then he sat gazing at\nher again. But not for long, for Bell suddenly starting up, did all\nbut turn him out of the house. It was late, she said, and her master\nwas tired, and they had a hard day before them next day; and it was\nkeeping Ellen Corney up; and they had had enough to drink,--more\nthan was good for them, she was sure, for they had both been taking\nher in with their stories, which she had been foolish enough to\nbelieve. No one saw the real motive of all this almost inhospitable\nhaste to dismiss her guest, how the sudden fear had taken possession\nof her that he and Sylvia were 'fancying each other'. Kinraid had\nsaid early in the evening that he had come to thank her for her\nkindness in sending the sausages, as he was off to his own home near\nNewcastle in a day or two. But now he said, in reply to Daniel\nRobson, that he would step in another night before long and hear\nsome more of the old man's yarns.\n\nDaniel had just had enough drink to make him very good-tempered, or\nelse his wife would not have dared to have acted as she did; and\nthis maudlin amiability took the shape of hospitable urgency that\nKinraid should come as often as he liked to Haytersbank; come and\nmake it his home when he was in these parts; stay there altogether,\nand so on, till Bell fairly shut the outer door to, and locked it\nbefore the specksioneer had well got out of the shadow of their\nroof.\n\nAll night long Sylvia dreamed of burning volcanoes springing out of\nicy southern seas. But, as in the specksioneer's tale the flames\nwere peopled with demons, there was no human interest for her in the\nwondrous scene in which she was no actor, only a spectator. With\ndaylight came wakening and little homely every-day wonders. Did\nKinraid mean that he was going away really and entirely, or did he\nnot? Was he Molly Corney's sweetheart, or was he not? When she had\nargued herself into certainty on one side, she suddenly wheeled\nabout, and was just of the opposite opinion. At length she settled\nthat it could not be settled until she saw Molly again; so, by a\nstrong gulping effort, she resolutely determined to think no more\nabout him, only about the marvels he had told. She might think a\nlittle about them when she sat at night, spinning in silence by the\nhousehold fire, or when she went out in the gloaming to call the\ncattle home to be milked, and sauntered back behind the patient,\nslow-gaited creatures; and at times on future summer days, when, as\nin the past, she took her knitting out for the sake of the freshness\nof the faint sea-breeze, and dropping down from ledge to ledge of\nthe rocks that faced the blue ocean, established herself in a\nperilous nook that had been her haunt ever since her parents had\ncome to Haytersbank Farm. From thence she had often seen the distant\nships pass to and fro, with a certain sort of lazy pleasure in\nwatching their swift tranquillity of motion, but no thought as to\nwhere they were bound to, or what strange places they would\npenetrate to before they turned again, homeward bound.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\nA REFRACTORY PUPIL\n\n\nSylvia was still full of the specksioneer and his stories, when\nHepburn came up to give her the next lesson. But the prospect of a\nlittle sensible commendation for writing a whole page full of\nflourishing 'Abednegos,' had lost all the slight charm it had ever\npossessed. She was much more inclined to try and elicit some\nsympathy in her interest in the perils and adventures of the\nnorthern seas, than to bend and control her mind to the right\nformation of letters. Unwisely enough, she endeavoured to repeat one\nof the narratives that she had heard from Kinraid; and when she\nfound that Hepburn (if, indeed, he did not look upon the whole as a\nsilly invention) considered it only as an interruption to the real\nbusiness in hand, to which he would try to listen as patiently as he\ncould, in the hope of Sylvia's applying herself diligently to her\ncopy-book when she had cleared her mind, she contracted her pretty\nlips, as if to check them from making any further appeals for\nsympathy, and set about her writing-lesson in a very rebellious\nframe of mind, only restrained by her mother's presence from spoken\nmutiny.\n\n'After all,' said she, throwing down her pen, and opening and\nshutting her weary, cramped hand, 'I see no good in tiring myself\nwi' learning for t' write letters when I'se never got one in a' my\nlife. What for should I write answers, when there's niver a one\nwrites to me? and if I had one, I couldn't read it; it's bad enough\nwi' a book o' print as I've niver seen afore, for there's sure to be\nnew-fangled words in 't. I'm sure I wish the man were farred who\nplagues his brains wi' striking out new words. Why can't folks just\nha' a set on 'em for good and a'?'\n\n'Why! you'll be after using two or three hundred yoursel' every day\nas you live, Sylvie; and yet I must use a great many as you never\nthink on about t' shop; and t' folks in t' fields want their set,\nlet alone the high English that parsons and lawyers speak.'\n\n'Well, it's weary work is reading and writing. Cannot you learn me\nsomething else, if we mun do lessons?'\n\n'There's sums--and geography,' said Hepburn, slowly and gravely.\n\n'Geography!' said Sylvia, brightening, and perhaps not pronouncing\nthe word quite correctly, 'I'd like yo' to learn me geography.\nThere's a deal o' places I want to hear all about.'\n\n'Well, I'll bring up a book and a map next time. But I can tell you\nsomething now. There's four quarters in the globe.'\n\n'What's that?' asked Sylvia.\n\n'The globe is the earth; the place we live on.'\n\n'Go on. Which quarter is Greenland?'\n\n'Greenland is no quarter. It is only a part of one.'\n\n'Maybe it's a half quarter.'\n\n'No, not so much as that.'\n\n'Half again?'\n\n'No!' he replied, smiling a little.\n\nShe thought he was making it into a very small place in order to\ntease her; so she pouted a little, and then said,--\n\n'Greenland is all t' geography I want to know. Except, perhaps,\nYork. I'd like to learn about York, because of t' races, and London,\nbecause King George lives there.'\n\n'But if you learn geography at all, you must learn 'bout all places:\nwhich of them is hot, and which is cold, and how many inhabitants is\nin each, and what's the rivers, and which is the principal towns.'\n\n'I'm sure, Sylvie, if Philip will learn thee all that, thou'lt be\nsuch a sight o' knowledge as ne'er a one o' th' Prestons has been\nsin' my great-grandfather lost his property. I should be main proud\no' thee; 'twould seem as if we was Prestons o' Slaideburn once\nmore.'\n\n'I'd do a deal to pleasure yo', mammy; but weary befa' riches and\nland, if folks that has 'em is to write \"Abednegos\" by t' score, and\nto get hard words int' their brains, till they work like barm, and\nend wi' cracking 'em.'\n\nThis seemed to be Sylvia's last protest against learning for the\nnight, for after this she turned docile, and really took pains to\nunderstand all that Philip could teach her, by means of the not\nunskilful, though rude, map which he drew for her with a piece of\ncharred wood on his aunt's dresser. He had asked his aunt's leave\nbefore beginning what Sylvia called his 'dirty work;' but by-and-by\neven she became a little interested in starting from a great black\nspot called Monkshaven, and in the shaping of land and sea around\nthat one centre. Sylvia held her round chin in the palms of her\nhands, supporting her elbows on the dresser; looking down at the\nprogress of the rough drawing in general, but now and then glancing\nup at him with sudden inquiry. All along he was not so much absorbed\nin his teaching as to be unconscious of her sweet proximity. She was\nin her best mood towards him; neither mutinous nor saucy; and he was\nstriving with all his might to retain her interest, speaking better\nthan ever he had done before (such brightness did love call\nforth!)--understanding what she would care to hear and to know;\nwhen, in the middle of an attempt at explaining the cause of the\nlong polar days, of which she had heard from her childhood, he felt\nthat her attention was no longer his; that a discord had come in\nbetween their minds; that she had passed out of his power. This\ncertainty of intuition lasted but for an instant; he had no time to\nwonder or to speculate as to what had affected her so adversely to\nhis wishes before the door opened and Kinraid came in. Then Hepburn\nknew that she must have heard his coming footsteps, and recognized\nthem.\n\nHe angrily stiffened himself up into coldness of demeanour. Almost\nto his surprise, Sylvia's greeting to the new comer was as cold as\nhis own. She stood rather behind him; so perhaps she did not see the\nhand which Kinraid stretched out towards her, for she did not place\nher own little palm in it, as she had done to Philip an hour ago.\nAnd she hardly spoke, but began to pore over the rough black map, as\nif seized with strong geographical curiosity, or determined to\nimpress Philip's lesson deep on her memory.\n\nStill Philip was dismayed by seeing the warm welcome which Kinraid\nreceived from the master of the house, who came in from the back\npremises almost at the same time as the specksioneer entered at the\nfront. Hepburn was uneasy, too, at finding Kinraid take his seat by\nthe fireside, like one accustomed to the ways of the house. Pipes\nwere soon produced. Philip disliked smoking. Possibly Kinraid did so\ntoo, but he took a pipe at any rate, and lighted it, though he\nhardly used it at all, but kept talking to farmer Robson on sea\naffairs. He had the conversation pretty much to himself. Philip sat\ngloomily by; Sylvia and his aunt were silent, and old Robson smoked\nhis long clay pipe, from time to time taking it out of his mouth to\nspit into the bright copper spittoon, and to shake the white ashes\nout of the bowl. Before he replaced it, he would give a short laugh\nof relishing interest in Kinraid's conversation; and now and then he\nput in a remark. Sylvia perched herself sideways on the end of the\ndresser, and made pretence to sew; but Philip could see how often\nshe paused in her work to listen.\n\nBy-and-by, his aunt spoke to him, and they kept up a little side\nconversation, more because Bell Robson felt that her nephew, her own\nflesh and blood, was put out, than for any special interest they\neither of them felt in what they were saying. Perhaps, also, they\nneither of them disliked showing that they had no great faith in the\nstories Kinraid was telling. Mrs. Robson, at any rate, knew so little\nas to be afraid of believing too much.\n\nPhilip was sitting on that side of the fire which was nearest to the\nwindow and to Sylvia, and opposite to the specksioneer. At length he\nturned to his cousin and said in a low voice--\n\n'I suppose we can't go on with our spell at geography till that\nfellow's gone?'\n\nThe colour came into Sylvia's cheek at the words 'that fellow'; but\nshe only replied with a careless air--\n\n'Well, I'm one as thinks enough is as good as a feast; and I've had\nenough of geography this one night, thank you kindly all the same.'\n\nPhilip took refuge in offended silence. He was maliciously pleased\nwhen his aunt made so much noise with her preparation for supper as\nquite to prevent the sound of the sailor's words from reaching\nSylvia's ears. She saw that he was glad to perceive that her efforts\nto reach the remainder of the story were baulked! this nettled her,\nand, determined not to let him have his malicious triumph, and still\nmore to put a stop to any attempt at private conversation, she began\nto sing to herself as she sat at her work; till, suddenly seized\nwith a desire to help her mother, she dexterously slipped down from\nher seat, passed Hepburn, and was on her knees toasting cakes right\nin front of the fire, and just close to her father and Kinraid. And\nnow the noise that Hepburn had so rejoiced in proved his foe. He\ncould not hear the little merry speeches that darted backwards and\nforwards as the specksioneer tried to take the toasting-fork out of\nSylvia's hand.\n\n'How comes that sailor chap here?' asked Hepburn of his aunt. 'He's\nnone fit to be where Sylvia is.'\n\n'Nay, I dunnot know,' said she; 'the Corneys made us acquaint first,\nand my master is quite fain of his company.'\n\n'And do you like him, too, aunt?' asked Hepburn, almost wistfully;\nhe had followed Mrs. Robson into the dairy on pretence of helping\nher.\n\n'I'm none fond on him; I think he tells us traveller's tales, by way\no' seeing how much we can swallow. But the master and Sylvia think\nthat there never was such a one.'\n\n'I could show them a score as good as he down on the quayside.'\n\n'Well, laddie, keep a calm sough. Some folk like some folk and\nothers don't. Wherever I am there'll allays be a welcome for thee.'\n\nFor the good woman thought that he had been hurt by the evident\nabsorption of her husband and daughter with their new friend, and\nwished to make all easy and straight. But do what she would, he did\nnot recover his temper all evening: he was uncomfortable, put out,\nnot enjoying himself, and yet he would not go. He was determined to\nassert his greater intimacy in that house by outstaying Kinraid. At\nlength the latter got up to go; but before he went, he must needs\nbend over Sylvia and say something to her in so low a tone that\nPhilip could not hear it; and she, seized with a sudden fit of\ndiligence, never looked up from her sewing; only nodded her head by\nway of reply. At last he took his departure, after many a little\ndelay, and many a quick return, which to the suspicious Philip\nseemed only pretences for taking stolen glances at Sylvia. As soon\nas he was decidedly gone, she folded up her work, and declared that\nshe was so much tired that she must go to bed there and then. Her\nmother, too, had been dozing for the last half-hour, and was only\ntoo glad to see signs that she might betake herself to her natural\nplace of slumber.\n\n'Take another glass, Philip,' said farmer Robson.\n\nBut Hepburn refused the offer rather abruptly. He drew near to\nSylvia instead. He wanted to make her speak to him, and he saw that\nshe wished to avoid it. He took up the readiest pretext. It was an\nunwise one as it proved, for it deprived him of his chances of\noccasionally obtaining her undivided attention.\n\n'I don't think you care much for learning geography, Sylvie?'\n\n'Not much to-night,' said she, making a pretence to yawn, yet\nlooking timidly up at his countenance of displeasure.\n\n'Nor at any time,' said he, with growing anger; 'nor for any kind of\nlearning. I did bring some books last time I came, meaning to teach\nyou many a thing--but now I'll just trouble you for my books; I put\nthem on yon shelf by the Bible.'\n\nHe had a mind that she should bring them to him; that, at any rate,\nhe should have the pleasure of receiving them out of her hands.\n\nSylvia did not reply, but went and took down the books with a\nlanguid, indifferent air.\n\n'And so you won't learn any more geography,' said Hepburn.\n\nSomething in his tone struck her, and she looked up in his face.\nThere were marks of stern offence upon his countenance, and yet in\nit there was also an air of wistful regret and sadness that touched\nher.\n\n'Yo're niver angry with me, Philip? Sooner than vex yo', I'll try\nand learn. Only, I'm just stupid; and it mun be such a trouble to\nyou.'\n\nHepburn would fain have snatched at this half proposal that the\nlessons should be continued, but he was too stubborn and proud to\nsay anything. He turned away from the sweet, pleading face without a\nword, to wrap up his books in a piece of paper. He knew that she was\nstanding quite still by his side, though he made as if he did not\nperceive her. When he had done he abruptly wished them all\n'good-night,' and took his leave.\n\nThere were tears in Sylvia's eyes, although the feeling in her heart\nwas rather one of relief. She had made a fair offer, and it had been\ntreated with silent contempt. A few days afterwards, her father came\nin from Monkshaven market, and dropped out, among other pieces of\nnews, that he had met Kinraid, who was bound for his own home at\nCullercoats. He had desired his respects to Mrs. Robson and her\ndaughter; and had bid Robson say that he would have come up to\nHaytersbank to wish them good-by, but that as he was pressed for\ntime, he hoped they would excuse him. But Robson did not think it\nworth while to give this long message of mere politeness. Indeed, as\nit did not relate to business, and was only sent to women, Robson\nforgot all about it, pretty nearly as soon as it was uttered. So\nSylvia went about fretting herself for one or two days, at her\nhero's apparent carelessness of those who had at any rate treated\nhim more like a friend than an acquaintance of only a few weeks'\nstanding; and then, her anger quenching her incipient regard, she\nwent about her daily business pretty much as though he had never\nbeen. He had gone away out of her sight into the thick mist of\nunseen life from which he had emerged--gone away without a word, and\nshe might never see him again. But still there was a chance of her\nseeing him when he came to marry Molly Corney. Perhaps she should be\nbridesmaid, and then what a pleasant merry time the wedding-day\nwould be! The Corneys were all such kind people, and in their family\nthere never seemed to be the checks and restraints by which her own\nmother hedged her round. Then there came an overwhelming\nself-reproaching burst of love for that 'own mother'; a humiliation\nbefore her slightest wish, as penance for the moment's unspoken\ntreason; and thus Sylvia was led to request her cousin Philip to\nresume his lessons in so meek a manner, that he slowly and\ngraciously acceded to a request which he was yearning to fulfil all\nthe time.\n\nDuring the ensuing winter, all went on in monotonous regularity at\nHaytersbank Farm for many weeks. Hepburn came and went, and thought\nSylvia wonderfully improved in docility and sobriety; and perhaps\nalso he noticed the improvement in her appearance. For she was at\nthat age when a girl changes rapidly, and generally for the better.\nSylvia shot up into a tall young woman; her eyes deepened in colour,\nher face increased in expression, and a sort of consciousness of\nunusual good looks gave her a slight tinge of coquettish shyness\nwith the few strangers whom she ever saw. Philip hailed her interest\nin geography as another sign of improvement. He had brought back his\nbook of maps to the farm; and there he sat on many an evening\nteaching his cousin, who had strange fancies respecting the places\nabout which she wished to learn, and was coolly indifferent to the\nvery existence of other towns, and countries, and seas far more\nfamous in story. She was occasionally wilful, and at times very\ncontemptuous as to the superior knowledge of her instructor; but, in\nspite of it all, Philip went regularly on the appointed evenings to\nHaytersbank--through keen black east wind, or driving snow, or\nslushing thaw; for he liked dearly to sit a little behind her, with\nhis arm on the back of her chair, she stooping over the outspread\nmap, with her eyes,--could he have seen them,--a good deal fixed on\none spot in the map, not Northumberland, where Kinraid was spending\nthe winter, but those wild northern seas about which he had told\nthem such wonders.\n\nOne day towards spring, she saw Molly Corney coming towards the\nfarm. The companions had not met for many weeks, for Molly had been\nfrom home visiting her relations in the north. Sylvia opened the\ndoor, and stood smiling and shivering on the threshold, glad to see\nher friend again. Molly called out, when a few paces off,--\n\n'Why, Sylvia, is that thee! Why, how thou'rt growed, to be sure!\nWhat a bonny lass thou is!'\n\n'Dunnot talk nonsense to my lass,' said Bell Robson, hospitably\nleaving her ironing and coming to the door; but though the mother\ntried to look as if she thought it nonsense, she could hardly keep\ndown the smile that shone out of her eyes, as she put her hand on\nSylvia's shoulder, with a fond sense of proprietorship in what was\nbeing praised.\n\n'Oh! but she is,' persisted Molly. 'She's grown quite a beauty sin'\nI saw her. And if I don't tell her so, the men will.'\n\n'Be quiet wi' thee,' said Sylvia, more than half offended, and\nturning away in a huff at the open barefaced admiration.\n\n'Ay; but they will,' persevered Molly. 'Yo'll not keep her long,\nMistress Robson. And as mother says, yo'd feel it a deal more to\nhave yer daughters left on hand.'\n\n'Thy mother has many, I have but this one,' said Mrs. Robson, with\nsevere sadness; for now Molly was getting to talk as she disliked.\nBut Molly's purpose was to bring the conversation round to her own\naffairs, of which she was very full.\n\n'Yes! I tell mother that wi' so many as she has, she ought to be\nthankful to t' one as gets off quickest.'\n\n'Who? which is it?' asked Sylvia, a little eagerly, seeing that\nthere was news of a wedding behind the talk.\n\n'Why! who should it be but me?' said Molly, laughing a good deal,\nand reddening a little. 'I've not gone fra' home for nought; I'se\npicked up a measter on my travels, leastways one as is to be.'\n\n'Charley Kinraid,' said Sylvia smiling, as she found that now she\nmight reveal Molly's secret, which hitherto she had kept sacred.\n\n'Charley Kinraid be hung!' said Molly, with a toss of her head.\n'Whatten good's a husband who's at sea half t' year? Ha ha, my\nmeaster is a canny Newcassel shopkeeper, on t' Side. A reckon a've\ndone pretty well for mysel', and a'll wish yo' as good luck, Sylvia.\nFor yo' see,' (turning to Bell Robson, who, perhaps, she thought\nwould more appreciate the substantial advantages of her engagement\nthan Sylvia,) 'though Measter Brunton is near upon forty if he's a\nday, yet he turns over a matter of two hundred pound every year; an\nhe's a good-looking man of his years too, an' a kind, good-tempered\nfeller int' t' bargain. He's been married once, to be sure; but his\nchilder are dead a' 'cept one; an' I don't mislike childer either;\nan' a'll feed 'em well, an' get 'em to bed early, out o' t' road.'\n\nMrs. Robson gave her her grave good wishes; but Sylvia was silent.\nShe was disappointed; it was a coming down from the romance with the\nspecksioneer for its hero. Molly laughed awkwardly, understanding\nSylvia's thoughts better than the latter imagined.\n\n'Sylvia's noane so well pleased. Why, lass! it's a' t' better for\nthee. There's Charley to t' fore now, which if a'd married him, he'd\nnot ha' been; and he's said more nor once what a pretty lass yo'd\ngrow into by-and-by.'\n\nMolly's prosperity was giving her an independence and fearlessness\nof talk such as had seldom appeared hitherto; and certainly never\nbefore Mrs. Robson. Sylvia was annoyed at Molly's whole tone and\nmanner, which were loud, laughing, and boisterous; but to her mother\nthey were positively repugnant. She said shortly and gravely,--\n\n'Sylvia's none so set upo' matrimony; she's content to bide wi' me\nand her father. Let a be such talking, it's not i' my way.'\n\nMolly was a little subdued; but still her elation at the prospect of\nbeing so well married kept cropping out of all the other subjects\nwhich were introduced; and when she went away, Mrs. Robson broke out\nin an unwonted strain of depreciation.\n\n'That's the way wi' some lasses. They're like a cock on a dunghill,\nwhen they've teased a silly chap into wedding 'em. It's\ncock-a-doodle-do, I've cotched a husband, cock-a-doodle-doo, wi'\n'em. I've no patience wi' such like; I beg, Sylvie, thou'lt not get\ntoo thick wi' Molly. She's not pretty behaved, making such an ado\nabout men-kind, as if they were two-headed calves to be run after.'\n\n'But Molly's a good-hearted lass, mother. Only I never dreamt but\nwhat she was troth-plighted wi' Charley Kinraid,' said Sylvia,\nmeditatively.\n\n'That wench 'll be troth-plight to th' first man as 'll wed her and\nkeep her i' plenty; that's a' she thinks about,' replied Bell,\nscornfully.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI\n\nVISIONS OF THE FUTURE\n\n\nBefore May was out, Molly Corney was married and had left the\nneighbourhood for Newcastle. Although Charley Kinraid was not the\nbridegroom, Sylvia's promise to be bridesmaid was claimed. But the\nfriendship brought on by the circumstances of neighbourhood and\nparity of age had become very much weakened in the time that elapsed\nbetween Molly's engagement and wedding. In the first place, she\nherself was so absorbed in her preparations, so elated by her good\nfortune in getting married, and married, too, before her elder\nsister, that all her faults blossomed out full and strong. Sylvia\nfelt her to be selfish; Mrs. Robson thought her not maidenly. A year\nbefore she would have been far more missed and regretted by Sylvia;\nnow it was almost a relief to the latter to be freed from the\nperpetual calls upon her sympathy, from the constant demands upon\nher congratulations, made by one who had no thought or feeling to\nbestow on others; at least, not in these weeks of 'cock-a-doodle-dooing,'\nas Mrs. Robson persisted in calling it. It was seldom that Bell\nwas taken with a humorous idea; but this once having hatched a\nsolitary joke, she was always clucking it into notice--to go on\nwith her own poultry simile.\n\nEvery time during that summer that Philip saw his cousin, he thought\nher prettier than she had ever been before; some new touch of\ncolour, some fresh sweet charm, seemed to have been added, just as\nevery summer day calls out new beauty in the flowers. And this was\nnot the addition of Philip's fancy. Hester Rose, who met Sylvia on\nrare occasions, came back each time with a candid, sad\nacknowledgement in her heart that it was no wonder that Sylvia was\nso much admired and loved.\n\nOne day Hester had seen her sitting near her mother in the\nmarket-place; there was a basket by her, and over the clean cloth\nthat covered the yellow pounds of butter, she had laid the\nhedge-roses and honeysuckles she had gathered on the way into\nMonkshaven; her straw hat was on her knee, and she was busy placing\nsome of the flowers in the ribbon that went round it. Then she held\nit on her hand, and turned it round about, putting her head on one\nside, the better to view the effect; and all this time, Hester,\npeeping at her through the folds of the stuffs displayed in Foster's\nwindows, saw her with admiring, wistful eyes; wondering, too, if\nPhilip, at the other counter, were aware of his cousin's being\nthere, so near to him. Then Sylvia put on her hat, and, looking up\nat Foster's windows, caught Hester's face of interest, and smiled\nand blushed at the consciousness of having been watched over her\nlittle vanities, and Hester smiled back, but rather sadly. Then a\ncustomer came in, and she had to attend to her business, which, on\nthis as on all market days, was great. In the midst she was aware of\nPhilip rushing bare-headed out of the shop, eager and delighted at\nsomething he saw outside. There was a little looking-glass hung\nagainst the wall on Hester's side, placed in that retired corner, in\norder that the good women who came to purchase head-gear of any kind\nmight see the effect thereof before they concluded their bargain. In\na pause of custom, Hester, half-ashamed, stole into this corner, and\nlooked at herself in the glass. What did she see? a colourless face,\ndark soft hair with no light gleams in it, eyes that were melancholy\ninstead of smiling, a mouth compressed with a sense of\ndissatisfaction. This was what she had to compare with the bright\nbonny face in the sunlight outside. She gave a gulp to check the\nsigh that was rising, and came back, even more patient than she had\nbeen before this disheartening peep, to serve all the whims and\nfancies of purchasers.\n\nSylvia herself had been rather put out by Philip's way of coming to\nher. 'It made her look so silly,' she thought; and 'what for must he\nmake a sight of himself, coming among the market folk in\nthat-a-way'; and when he took to admiring her hat, she pulled out\nthe flowers in a pet, and threw them down, and trampled them under\nfoot.\n\n'What for art thou doing that, Sylvie?' said her mother. 'The\nflowers is well enough, though may-be thy hat might ha' been\nstained.'\n\n'I don't like Philip to speak to me so,' said Sylvia, pouting.\n\n'How?' asked her mother.\n\nBut Sylvia could not repeat his words. She hung her head, and looked\nred and pre-occupied, anything but pleased. Philip had addressed his\nfirst expression of personal admiration at an unfortunate tune.\n\nIt just shows what different views different men and women take of\ntheir fellow-creatures, when I say that Hester looked upon Philip as\nthe best and most agreeable man she had ever known. He was not one\nto speak of himself without being questioned on the subject, so his\nHaytersbank relations, only come into the neighborhood in the last\nyear or two, knew nothing of the trials he had surmounted, or the\ndifficult duties he had performed. His aunt, indeed, had strong\nfaith in him, both from partial knowledge of his character, and\nbecause he was of her own tribe and kin; but she had never learnt\nthe small details of his past life. Sylvia respected him as her\nmother's friend, and treated him tolerably well as long as he\npreserved his usual self-restraint of demeanour, but hardly ever\nthought of him when he was absent.\n\nNow Hester, who had watched him daily for all the years since he had\nfirst come as an errand-boy into Foster's shop--watching with quiet,\nmodest, yet observant eyes--had seen how devoted he was to his\nmaster's interests, had known of his careful and punctual\nministration to his absent mother's comforts, as long as she was\nliving to benefit by his silent, frugal self-denial.\n\nHis methodical appropriation of the few hours he could call his own\nwas not without its charms to the equally methodical Hester; the way\nin which he reproduced any lately acquired piece of\nknowledge--knowledge so wearisome to Sylvia--was delightfully\ninstructive to Hester--although, as she was habitually silent, it\nwould have required an observer more interested in discovering her\nfeelings than Philip was to have perceived the little flush on the\npale cheek, and the brightness in the half-veiled eyes whenever he\nwas talking. She had not thought of love on either side. Love was a\nvanity, a worldliness not to be spoken about, or even thought about.\nOnce or twice before the Robsons came into the neighbourhood, an\nidea had crossed her mind that possibly the quiet, habitual way in\nwhich she and Philip lived together, might drift them into matrimony\nat some distant period; and she could not bear the humble advances\nwhich Coulson, Philip's fellow-lodger, sometimes made. They seemed\nto disgust her with him.\n\nBut after the Robsons settled at Haytersbank, Philip's evenings were\nso often spent there that any unconscious hopes Hester might,\nunawares, have entertained, died away. At first she had felt a pang\nakin to jealousy when she heard of Sylvia, the little cousin, who\nwas passing out of childhood into womanhood. Once--early in those\ndays--she had ventured to ask Philip what Sylvia was like. Philip\nhad not warmed up at the question, and had given rather a dry\ncatalogue of her features, hair, and height, but Hester, almost to\nher own surprise, persevered, and jerked out the final question.\n\n'Is she pretty?'\n\nPhilip's sallow cheek grew deeper by two or three shades; but he\nanswered with a tone of indifference,--\n\n'I believe some folks think her so.'\n\n'But do you?' persevered Hester, in spite of her being aware that he\nsomehow disliked the question.\n\n'There's no need for talking o' such things,' he answered, with\nabrupt displeasure.\n\nHester silenced her curiosity from that time. But her heart was not\nquite at ease, and she kept on wondering whether Philip thought his\nlittle cousin pretty until she saw her and him together, on that\noccasion of which we have spoken, when Sylvia came to the shop to\nbuy her new cloak; and after that Hester never wondered whether\nPhilip thought his cousin pretty or no, for she knew quite well.\nBell Robson had her own anxieties on the subject of her daughter's\nincreasing attractions. She apprehended the dangers consequent upon\ncertain facts, by a mental process more akin to intuition than\nreason. She was uncomfortable, even while her motherly vanity was\nflattered, at the admiration Sylvia received from the other sex.\nThis admiration was made evident to her mother in many ways. When\nSylvia was with her at market, it might have been thought that the\ndoctors had prescribed a diet of butter and eggs to all the men\nunder forty in Monkshaven. At first it seemed to Mrs. Robson but a\nnatural tribute to the superior merit of her farm produce; but by\ndegrees she perceived that if Sylvia remained at home, she stood no\nbetter chance than her neighbours of an early sale. There were more\ncustomers than formerly for the fleeces stored in the wool-loft;\ncomely young butchers came after the calf almost before it had been\ndecided to sell it; in short, excuses were seldom wanting to those\nwho wished to see the beauty of Haytersbank Farm. All this made Bell\nuncomfortable, though she could hardly have told what she dreaded.\nSylvia herself seemed unspoilt by it as far as her home relations\nwere concerned. A little thoughtless she had always been, and\nthoughtless she was still; but, as her mother had often said, 'Yo'\ncanna put old heads on young shoulders;' and if blamed for her\ncarelessness by her parents, Sylvia was always as penitent as she\ncould be for the time being. To be sure, it was only to her father\nand mother that she remained the same as she had been when an\nawkward lassie of thirteen. Out of the house there were the most\ncontradictory opinions of her, especially if the voices of women\nwere to be listened to. She was 'an ill-favoured, overgrown thing';\n'just as bonny as the first rose i' June, and as sweet i' her nature\nas t' honeysuckle a-climbing round it;' she was 'a vixen, with a\ntongue sharp enough to make yer very heart bleed;' she was 'just a\nbit o' sunshine wheriver she went;' she was sulky, lively, witty,\nsilent, affectionate, or cold-hearted, according to the person who\nspoke about her. In fact, her peculiarity seemed to be this--that\nevery one who knew her talked about her either in praise or blame;\nin church, or in market, she unconsciously attracted attention; they\ncould not forget her presence, as they could that of other girls\nperhaps more personally attractive. Now all this was a cause of\nanxiety to her mother, who began to feel as if she would rather have\nhad her child passed by in silence than so much noticed. Bell's\nopinion was, that it was creditable to a woman to go through life in\nthe shadow of obscurity,--never named except in connexion with good\nhousewifery, husband, or children. Too much talking about a girl,\neven in the way of praise, disturbed Mrs. Robson's opinion of her;\nand when her neighbours told her how her own daughter was admired,\nshe would reply coldly, 'She's just well enough,' and change the\nsubject of conversation. But it was quite different with her\nhusband. To his looser, less-restrained mind, it was agreeable to\nhear of, and still more to see, the attention which his daughter's\nbeauty received. He felt it as reflecting consequence on himself. He\nhad never troubled his mind with speculations as to whether he\nhimself was popular, still less whether he was respected. He was\npretty welcome wherever he went, as a jovial good-natured man, who\nhad done adventurous and illegal things in his youth, which in some\nmeasure entitled him to speak out his opinions on life in general in\nthe authoritative manner he generally used; but, of the two, he\npreferred consorting with younger men, to taking a sober stand of\nrespectability with the elders of the place; and he perceived,\nwithout reasoning upon it, that the gay daring spirits were more\ndesirous of his company when Sylvia was by his side than at any\nother time. One or two of these would saunter up to Haytersbank on a\nSunday afternoon, and lounge round his fields with the old farmer.\nBell kept herself from the nap which had been her weekly solace for\nyears, in order to look after Sylvia, and on such occasions she\nalways turned as cold a shoulder to the visitors as her sense of\nhospitality and of duty to her husband would permit. But if they did\nnot enter the house, old Robson would always have Sylvia with him\nwhen he went the round of his land. Bell could see them from the\nupper window: the young men standing in the attitudes of listeners,\nwhile Daniel laid down the law on some point, enforcing his words by\npantomimic actions with his thick stick; and Sylvia, half turning\naway as if from some too admiring gaze, was possibly picking flowers\nout of the hedge-bank. These Sunday afternoon strolls were the\nplague of Bell's life that whole summer. Then it took as much of\nartifice as was in the simple woman's nature to keep Daniel from\ninsisting on having Sylvia's company every time he went down to\nMonkshaven. And here, again, came a perplexity, the acknowledgement\nof which in distinct thought would have been an act of disloyalty,\naccording to Bell's conscience. If Sylvia went with her father, he\nnever drank to excess; and that was a good gain to health at any\nrate (drinking was hardly a sin against morals in those days, and in\nthat place); so, occasionally, she was allowed to accompany him to\nMonkshaven as a check upon his folly; for he was too fond and proud\nof his daughter to disgrace her by any open excess. But one Sunday\nafternoon early in November, Philip came up before the time at which\nhe usually paid his visits. He looked grave and pale; and his aunt\nbegan,--\n\n'Why, lad! what's been ado? Thou'rt looking as peaked and pined as a\nMethody preacher after a love-feast, when he's talked hisself to\nDeath's door. Thee dost na' get good milk enow, that's what it\nis,--such stuff as Monkshaven folks put up wi'!'\n\n'No, aunt; I'm quite well. Only I'm a bit put out--vexed like at\nwhat I've heerd about Sylvie.'\n\nHis aunt's face changed immediately.\n\n'And whatten folk say of her, next thing?'\n\n'Oh,' said Philip, struck by the difference of look and manner in\nhis aunt, and subdued by seeing how instantly she took alarm. 'It\nwere only my uncle;--he should na' take a girl like her to a public.\nShe were wi' him at t' \"Admiral's Head\" upo' All Souls' Day--that\nwere all. There were many a one there beside,--it were statute fair;\nbut such a one as our Sylvie ought not to be cheapened wi' t' rest.'\n\n'And he took her there, did he?' said Bell, in severe meditation. 'I\nhad never no opinion o' th' wenches as 'll set theirselves to be\nhired for servants i' th' fair; they're a bad lot, as cannot find\nplaces for theirselves--'bout going and stannin' to be stared at by\nfolk, and grinnin' wi' th' plough-lads when no one's looking; it's a\nbad look-out for t' missus as takes one o' these wenches for a\nservant; and dost ta mean to say as my Sylvie went and demeaned\nhersel' to dance and marlock wi' a' th' fair-folk at th' \"Admiral's\nHead?\"'\n\n'No, no, she did na' dance; she barely set foot i' th' room; but it\nwere her own pride as saved her; uncle would niver ha' kept her from\nit, for he had fallen in wi' Hayley o' Seaburn and one or two\nothers, and they were having a glass i' t' bar, and Mrs. Lawson, t'\nlandlady, knew how there was them who would come and dance among\nparish 'prentices if need were, just to get a word or a look wi'\nSylvie! So she tempts her in, saying that the room were all\nsmartened and fine wi' flags; and there was them in the room as told\nme that they never were so startled as when they saw our Sylvie's\nface peeping in among all t' flustered maids and men, rough and red\nwi' weather and drink; and Jem Macbean, he said she were just like a\nbit o' apple-blossom among peonies; and some man, he didn't know\nwho, went up and spoke to her; an' either at that, or at some o' t'\nwords she heard--for they'd got a good way on afore that time--she\nwent quite white and mad, as if fire were coming out of her eyes,\nand then she turned red and left the room, for all t' landlady tried\nto laugh it off and keep her in.'\n\n'I'll be down to Monkshaven before I'm a day older, and tell\nMargaret Lawson some on my mind as she'll not forget in a hurry.'\n\nBell moved as though she would put on her cloak and hood there and\nthen.\n\n'Nay, it's not in reason as a woman i' that line o' life shouldn't\ntry to make her house agreeable,' said Philip.\n\n'Not wi' my wench,' said Bell, in a determined voice.\n\nPhilip's information had made a deeper impression on his aunt than\nhe intended. He himself had been annoyed more at the idea that\nSylvia would be spoken of as having been at a rough piece of rustic\ngaiety--a yearly festival for the lower classes of Yorkshire\nservants, out-door as well as in-door--than at the affair itself,\nfor he had learnt from his informant how instantaneous her\nappearance had been. He stood watching his aunt's troubled face, and\nalmost wishing that he had not spoken. At last she heaved a deep\nsigh, and stirring the fire, as if by this little household\noccupation to compose her mind, she said--\n\n'It's a pity as wenches aren't lads, or married folk. I could ha'\nwished--but it were the Lord's will--It would ha' been summut to\nlook to, if she'd had a brother. My master is so full on his own\nthoughts, yo' see, he's no mind left for thinking on her, what wi'\nth' oats, and th' wool, and th' young colt, and his venture i' th'\n_Lucky Mary_.'\n\nShe really believed her husband to have the serious and important\noccupation for his mind that she had been taught to consider\nbefitting the superior intellect of the masculine gender; she would\nhave taxed herself severely, if, even in thought, she had blamed\nhim, and Philip respected her feelings too much to say that Sylvia's\nfather ought to look after her more closely if he made such a pretty\ncreature so constantly his companion; yet some such speech was only\njust pent within Philip's closed lips. Again his aunt spoke--\n\n'I used to think as she and yo' might fancy one another, but thou'rt\ntoo old-fashioned like for her; ye would na' suit; and it's as well,\nfor now I can say to thee, that I would take it very kindly if thou\nwould'st look after her a bit.'\n\nPhilip's countenance fell into gloom. He had to gulp down certain\nfeelings before he could make answer with discretion.\n\n'How can I look after her, and me tied to the shop more and more\nevery day?'\n\n'I could send her on a bit of an errand to Foster's, and then, for\nsure, yo' might keep an eye upon her when she's in th' town; and\njust walk a bit way with her when she's in th' street, and keep t'\nother fellows off her--Ned Simpson, t' butcher, in 'special, for\nfolks do say he means no good by any girl he goes wi'--and I'll ask\nfather to leave her a bit more wi' me. They're coming down th' brow,\nand Ned Simpson wi' them. Now, Philip, I look to thee to do a\nbrother's part by my wench, and warn off all as isn't fit.'\n\nThe door opened, and the coarse strong voice of Simpson made itself\nheard. He was a stout man, comely enough as to form and feature, but\nwith a depth of colour in his face that betokened the coming on of\nthe habits of the sot. His Sunday hat was in his hand, and he\nsmoothed the long nap of it, as he said, with a mixture of shyness\nand familiarity--\n\n'Sarvant, missus. Yo'r measter is fain that I should come in an'\nhave a drop; no offence, I hope?'\n\nSylvia passed quickly through the house-place, and went upstairs\nwithout speaking to her cousin Philip or to any one. He sat on,\ndisliking the visitor, and almost disliking his hospitable uncle for\nhaving brought Simpson into the house, sympathizing with his aunt in\nthe spirit which prompted her curt answers, and in the intervals of\nall these feelings wondering what ground she had for speaking as if\nshe had now given up all thought of Sylvia and him ever being\nmarried, and in what way he was too 'old-fashioned.'\n\nRobson would gladly have persuaded Philip to join him and Simpson in\ntheir drink, but Philip was in no sociable mood, and sate a little\naloof, watching the staircase down which sooner or later Sylvia must\ncome; for, as perhaps has been already said, the stairs went up\nstraight out of the kitchen. And at length his yearning watch was\nrewarded; first, the little pointed toe came daintily in sight, then\nthe trim ankle in the tight blue stocking, the wool of which was\nspun and the web of which was knitted by her mother's careful hands;\nthen the full brown stuff petticoat, the arm holding the petticoat\nback in decent folds, so as not to encumber the descending feet; the\nslender neck and shoulders hidden under the folded square of fresh\nwhite muslin; the crowning beauty of the soft innocent face radiant\nin colour, and with the light brown curls clustering around. She\nmade her way quickly to Philip's side; how his heart beat at her\napproach! and even more when she entered into a low-voiced\n_tete-a-tete_.\n\n'Isn't he gone yet?' said she. 'I cannot abide him; I could ha'\npinched father when he asked him for t' come in.'\n\n'Maybe, he'll not stay long,' said Philip, hardly understanding the\nmeaning of what he said, so sweet was it to have her making her\nwhispered confidences to him.\n\nBut Simpson was not going to let her alone in the dark corner\nbetween the door and the window. He began paying her some coarse\ncountry compliments--too strong in their direct flattery for even\nher father's taste, more especially as he saw by his wife's set lips\nand frowning brow how much she disapproved of their visitor's style\nof conversation.\n\n'Come, measter, leave t' lass alone; she's set up enough a'ready,\nher mother makes such a deal on her. Yo' an' me's men for sensible\ntalk at our time o' life. An', as I was saying, t' horse was a\nweaver if iver one was, as any one could ha' told as had come within\na mile on him.'\n\nAnd in this way the old farmer and the bluff butcher chatted on\nabout horses, while Philip and Sylvia sate together, he turning over\nall manner of hopes and projects for the future, in spite of his\naunt's opinion that he was too 'old-fashioned' for her dainty,\nblooming daughter. Perhaps, too, Mrs. Robson saw some reason for\nchanging her mind on this head as she watched Sylvia this night, for\nshe accompanied Philip to the door, when the time came for him to\nstart homewards, and bade him 'good-night' with unusual fervour,\nadding--\n\n'Thou'st been a deal o' comfort to me, lad--a'most as one as if thou\nwert a child o' my own, as at times I could welly think thou art to\nbe. Anyways, I trust to thee to look after the lile lass, as has no\nbrother to guide her among men--and men's very kittle for a woman to\ndeal wi; but if thou'lt have an eye on whom she consorts wi', my\nmind 'll be easier.'\n\nPhilip's heart beat fast, but his voice was as calm as usual when he\nreplied--\n\n'I'd just keep her a bit aloof from Monkshaven folks; a lass is\nalways the more thought on for being chary of herself; and as for t'\nrest, I'll have an eye to the folks she goes among, and if I see\nthat they don't befit her, I'll just give her a warning, for she's\nnot one to like such chaps as yon Simpson there; she can see what's\nbecoming in a man to say to a lass, and what's not.'\n\nPhilip set out on his two-mile walk home with a tumult of happiness\nin his heart. He was not often carried away by delusions of his own\ncreating; to-night he thought he had good ground for believing that\nby patient self-restraint he might win Sylvia's love. A year ago he\nhad nearly earned her dislike by obtruding upon her looks and words\nbetokening his passionate love. He alarmed her girlish coyness, as\nwell as wearied her with the wish he had then felt that she should\ntake an interest in his pursuits. But, with unusual wisdom, he had\nperceived his mistake; it was many months now since he had betrayed,\nby word or look, that she was anything more to him than a little\ncousin to be cared for and protected when need was. The consequence\nwas that she had become tamed, just as a wild animal is tamed; he\nhad remained tranquil and impassive, almost as if he did not\nperceive her shy advances towards friendliness. These advances were\nmade by her after the lessons had ceased. She was afraid lest he was\ndispleased with her behaviour in rejecting his instructions, and was\nnot easy till she was at peace with him; and now, to all appearance,\nhe and she were perfect friends, but nothing more. In his absence\nshe would not allow her young companions to laugh at his grave\nsobriety of character, and somewhat prim demeanour; she would even\ngo against her conscience, and deny that she perceived any\npeculiarity. When she wanted it, she sought his advice on such small\nsubjects as came up in her daily life; and she tried not to show\nsigns of weariness when he used more words--and more difficult\nwords--than were necessary to convey his ideas. But her ideal\nhusband was different from Philip in every point, the two images\nnever for an instant merged into one. To Philip she was the only\nwoman in the world; it was the one subject on which he dared not\nconsider, for fear that both conscience and judgment should decide\nagainst him, and that he should be convinced against his will that\nshe was an unfit mate for him, that she never would be his, and that\nit was waste of time and life to keep her shrined in the dearest\nsanctuary of his being, to the exclusion of all the serious and\nreligious aims which, in any other case, he would have been the\nfirst to acknowledge as the object he ought to pursue. For he had\nbeen brought up among the Quakers, and shared in their austere\ndistrust of a self-seeking spirit; yet what else but self-seeking\nwas his passionate prayer, 'Give me Sylvia, or else, I die?' No\nother vision had ever crossed his masculine fancy for a moment; his\nwas a rare and constant love that deserved a better fate than it met\nwith. At this time his hopes were high, as I have said, not merely\nas to the growth of Sylvia's feelings towards him, but as to the\nprobability of his soon being in a position to place her in such\ncomfort, as his wife, as she had never enjoyed before.\n\nFor the brothers Foster were thinking of retiring from business, and\nrelinquishing the shop to their two shopmen, Philip Hepburn and\nWilliam Coulson. To be sure, it was only by looking back for a few\nmonths, and noticing chance expressions and small indications, that\nthis intention of theirs could be discovered. But every step they\ntook tended this way, and Philip knew their usual practice of\ndeliberation too well to feel in the least impatient for the quicker\nprogress of the end which he saw steadily approaching. The whole\natmosphere of life among the Friends at this date partook of this\ncharacter of self-repression, and both Coulson and Hepburn shared in\nit. Coulson was just as much aware of the prospect opening before\nhim as Hepburn; but they never spoke together on the subject,\nalthough their mutual knowledge might be occasionally implied in\ntheir conversation on their future lives. Meanwhile the Fosters were\nimparting more of the background of their business to their\nsuccessors. For the present, at least, the brothers meant to retain\nan interest in the shop, even after they had given up the active\nmanagement; and they sometimes thought of setting up a separate\nestablishment as bankers. The separation of the business,--the\nintroduction of their shopmen to the distant manufacturers who\nfurnished their goods (in those days the system of 'travellers' was\nnot so widely organized as it is at present),--all these steps were\nin gradual progress; and already Philip saw himself in imagination\nin the dignified position of joint master of the principal shop in\nMonkshaven, with Sylvia installed as his wife, with certainly a silk\ngown, and possibly a gig at her disposal. In all Philip's visions of\nfuture prosperity, it was Sylvia who was to be aggrandized by them;\nhis own life was to be spent as it was now, pretty much between the\nfour shop walls.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII\n\nNEW YEAR'S FETE\n\n\nAll this enlargement of interest in the shop occupied Philip fully\nfor some months after the period referred to in the preceding\nchapter. Remembering his last conversation with his aunt, he might\nhave been uneasy at his inability to perform his promise and look\nafter his pretty cousin, but that about the middle of November Bell\nRobson had fallen ill of a rheumatic fever, and that her daughter\nhad been entirely absorbed in nursing her. No thought of company or\ngaiety was in Sylvia's mind as long as her mother's illness lasted;\nvehement in all her feelings, she discovered in the dread of losing\nher mother how passionately she was attached to her. Hitherto she\nhad supposed, as children so often do, that her parents would live\nfor ever; and now when it was a question of days, whether by that\ntime the following week her mother might not be buried out of her\nsight for ever, she clung to every semblance of service to be\nrendered, or affection shown, as if she hoped to condense the love\nand care of years into the few days only that might remain. Mrs.\nRobson lingered on, began slowly to recover, and before Christmas\nwas again sitting by the fireside in the house-place, wan and pulled\ndown, muffled up with shawls and blankets, but still there once\nmore, where not long before Sylvia had scarcely expected to see her\nagain. Philip came up that evening and found Sylvia in wild spirits.\nShe thought that everything was done, now that her mother had once\ncome downstairs again; she laughed with glee; she kissed her mother;\nshe shook hands with Philip, she almost submitted to a speech of\nmore than usual tenderness from him; but, in the midst of his words,\nher mother's pillows wanted arranging and she went to her chair,\npaying no more heed to his words than if they had been addressed to\nthe cat, that lying on the invalid's knee was purring out her\nwelcome to the weak hand feebly stroking her back. Robson himself\nsoon came in, looking older and more subdued since Philip had seen\nhim last. He was very urgent that his wife should have some spirits\nand water; but on her refusal, almost as if she loathed the thought\nof the smell, he contented himself with sharing her tea, though he\nkept abusing the beverage as 'washing the heart out of a man,' and\nattributing all the degeneracy of the world, growing up about him in\nhis old age, to the drinking of such slop. At the same time, his\nlittle self-sacrifice put him in an unusually good temper; and,\nmingled with his real gladness at having his wife once more on the\nway to recovery, brought back some of the old charm of tenderness\ncombined with light-heartedness, which had won the sober Isabella\nPreston long ago. He sat by her side, holding her hand, and talking\nof old times to the young couple opposite; of his adventures and\nescapes, and how he had won his wife. She, faintly smiling at the\nremembrance of those days, yet half-ashamed at having the little\ndetails of her courtship revealed, from time to time kept saying,--\n\n'For shame wi' thee, Dannel--I never did,' and faint denials of a\nsimilar kind.\n\n'Niver believe her, Sylvie. She were a woman, and there's niver a\nwoman but likes to have a sweetheart, and can tell when a chap's\ncastin' sheep's-eyes at her; ay, an' afore he knows what he's about\nhissen. She were a pretty one then, was my old 'ooman, an' liked\nthem as thought her so, though she did cock her head high, as bein'\na Preston, which were a family o' standin' and means i' those parts\naforetime. There's Philip there, I'll warrant, is as proud o' bein'\nPreston by t' mother's side, for it runs i' t' blood, lass. A can\ntell when a child of a Preston tak's to being proud o' their kin, by\nt' cut o' their nose. Now Philip's and my missus's has a turn beyond\ncommon i' their nostrils, as if they was sniffin' at t' rest of us\nworld, an' seein' if we was good enough for 'em to consort wi'. Thee\nan' me, lass, is Robsons--oat-cake folk, while they's pie-crust.\nLord! how Bell used to speak to me, as short as though a wasn't a\nChristian, an' a' t' time she loved me as her very life, an' well a\nknew it, tho' a'd to mak' as tho' a didn't. Philip, when thou goes\ncourtin', come t' me, and a'll give thee many a wrinkle. A've shown,\ntoo, as a know well how t' choose a good wife by tokens an' signs,\nhannot a, missus? Come t' me, my lad, and show me t' lass, an' a'll\njust tak' a squint at her, an' tell yo' if she'll do or not; an' if\nshe'll do, a'll teach yo' how to win her.'\n\n'They say another o' yon Corney girls is going to be married,' said\nMrs. Robson, in her faint deliberate tones.\n\n'By gosh, an' it's well thou'st spoke on 'em; a was as clean\nforgettin' it as iver could be. A met Nanny Corney i' Monkshaven\nlast neet, and she axed me for t' let our Sylvia come o' New Year's\nEve, an' see Molly an' her man, that 'n as is wed beyond Newcassel,\nthey'll be over at her feyther's, for t' New Year, an' there's to be\na merry-making.'\n\nSylvia's colour came, her eyes brightened, she would have liked to\ngo; but the thought of her mother came across her, and her features\nfell. Her mother's eye caught the look and the change, and knew what\nboth meant as well as if Sylvia had spoken out.\n\n'Thursday se'nnight,' said she. 'I'll be rare and strong by then,\nand Sylvie shall go play hersen; she's been nurse-tending long\nenough.'\n\n'You're but weakly yet,' said Philip shortly; he did not intend to\nsay it, but the words seemed to come out in spite of himself.\n\n'A said as our lass should come, God willin', if she only came and\nwent, an' thee goin' on sprightly, old 'ooman. An' a'll turn\nnurse-tender mysen for t' occasion, 'special if thou can stand t'\ngood honest smell o' whisky by then. So, my lass, get up thy smart\nclothes, and cut t' best on 'em out, as becomes a Preston. Maybe,\na'll fetch thee home, an' maybe Philip will convoy thee, for Nanny\nCorney bade thee to t' merry-making, as well. She said her measter\nwould be seem' thee about t' wool afore then.'\n\n'I don't think as I can go,' said Philip, secretly pleased to know\nthat he had the opportunity in his power; 'I'm half bound to go Wi'\nHester Rose and her mother to t' watch-night.'\n\n'Is Hester a Methodee?' asked Sylvia in surprise.\n\n'No! she's neither a Methodee, nor a Friend, nor a Church person;\nbut she's a turn for serious things, choose wherever they're found.'\n\n'Well, then,' said good-natured farmer Robson, only seeing the\nsurface of things, 'a'll make shift to fetch Sylvie back fra' t'\nmerry-making, and thee an' thy young woman can go to t'\nprayer-makin'; it's every man to his taste, say I.'\n\nBut in spite of his half-promise, nay against his natural\ninclination, Philip was lured to the Corneys' by the thought of\nmeeting Sylvia, of watching her and exulting in her superiority in\npretty looks and ways to all the other girls likely to be assembled.\nBesides (he told his conscience) he was pledged to his aunt to watch\nover Sylvia like a brother. So in the interval before New Year's\nEve, he silently revelled as much as any young girl in the\nanticipation of the happy coming time.\n\nAt this hour, all the actors in this story having played out their\nparts and gone to their rest, there is something touching in\nrecording the futile efforts made by Philip to win from Sylvia the\nlove he yearned for. But, at the time, any one who had watched him\nmight have been amused to see the grave, awkward, plain young man\nstudying patterns and colours for a new waistcoat, with his head a\nlittle on one side, after the meditative manner common to those who\nare choosing a new article of dress. They might have smiled could\nthey have read in his imagination the frequent rehearsals of the\ncoming evening, when he and she should each be dressed in their gala\nattire, to spend a few hours under a bright, festive aspect, among\npeople whose company would oblige them to assume a new demeanour\ntowards each other, not so familiar as their every-day manner, but\nallowing more scope for the expression of rustic gallantry. Philip\nhad so seldom been to anything of the kind, that, even had Sylvia\nnot been going, he would have felt a kind of shy excitement at the\nprospect of anything so unusual. But, indeed, if Sylvia had not been\ngoing, it is very probable that Philip's rigid conscience might have\nbeen aroused to the question whether such parties did not savour too\nmuch of the world for him to form one in them.\n\nAs it was, however, the facts to him were simply these. He was going\nand she was going. The day before, he had hurried off to Haytersbank\nFarm with a small paper parcel in his pocket--a ribbon with a little\nbriar-rose pattern running upon it for Sylvia. It was the first\nthing he had ever ventured to give her--the first thing of the kind\nwould, perhaps, be more accurate; for when he had first begun to\nteach her any lessons, he had given her Mavor's Spelling-book, but\nthat he might have done, out of zeal for knowledge, to any dunce of\na little girl of his acquaintance. This ribbon was quite a different\nkind of present; he touched it tenderly, as if he were caressing it,\nwhen he thought of her wearing it; the briar-rose (sweetness and\nthorns) seemed to be the very flower for her; the soft, green ground\non which the pink and brown pattern ran, was just the colour to show\noff her complexion. And she would in a way belong to him: her\ncousin, her mentor, her chaperon, her lover! While others only\nadmired, he might hope to appropriate; for of late they had been\nsuch happy friends! Her mother approved of him, her father liked\nhim. A few months, perhaps only a few weeks more of self-restraint,\nand then he might go and speak openly of his wishes, and what he had\nto offer. For he had resolved, with the quiet force of his\ncharacter, to wait until all was finally settled between him and his\nmasters, before he declared himself to either Sylvia or her parents.\nThe interval was spent in patient, silent endeavours to recommend\nhimself to her.\n\nHe had to give his ribbon to his aunt in charge for Sylvia, and that\nwas a disappointment to his fancy, although he tried to reason\nhimself into thinking that it was better so. He had not time to wait\nfor her return from some errand on which she had gone, for he was\ndaily more and more occupied with the affairs of the shop.\n\nSylvia made many a promise to her mother, and more to herself, that\nshe would not stay late at the party, but she might go as early as\nshe liked; and before the December daylight had faded away, Sylvia\npresented herself at the Corneys'. She was to come early in order to\nhelp to set out the supper, which was arranged in the large old\nflagged parlour, which served as best bed-room as well. It opened\nout of the house-place, and was the sacred room of the house, as\nchambers of a similar description are still considered in retired\nfarmhouses in the north of England. They are used on occasions like\nthe one now described for purposes of hospitality; but in the state\nbed, overshadowing so large a portion of the floor, the births and,\nas far as may be, the deaths, of the household take place. At the\nCorneys', the united efforts of some former generation of the family\nhad produced patchwork curtains and coverlet; and patchwork was\npatchwork in those days, before the early Yates and Peels had found\nout the secret of printing the parsley-leaf. Scraps of costly Indian\nchintzes and palempours were intermixed with commoner black and red\ncalico in minute hexagons; and the variety of patterns served for\nthe useful purpose of promoting conversation as well as the more\nobvious one of displaying the work-woman 's taste. Sylvia, for\ninstance, began at once to her old friend, Molly Brunton, who had\naccompanied her into this chamber to take off her hat and cloak,\nwith a remark on one of the chintzes. Stooping over the counterpane,\nwith a face into which the flush would come whether or no, she said\nto Molly,--\n\n'Dear! I never seed this one afore--this--for all t' world like th'\neyes in a peacock's tail.'\n\n'Thou's seen it many a time and oft, lass. But weren't thou\nsurprised to find Charley here? We picked him up at Shields, quite\nby surprise like; and when Brunton and me said as we was comin'\nhere, nought would serve him but comin' with us, for t' see t' new\nyear in. It's a pity as your mother's ta'en this time for t' fall\nill and want yo' back so early.'\n\nSylvia had taken off her hat and cloak by this time, and began to\nhelp Molly and a younger unmarried sister in laying out the\nsubstantial supper.\n\n'Here,' continued Mrs. Brunton; 'stick a bit o' holly i' yon pig's\nmouth, that's the way we do things i' Newcassel; but folks is so\nbehindhand in Monkshaven. It's a fine thing to live in a large town,\nSylvia; an' if yo're looking out for a husband, I'd advise yo' to\ntak' one as lives in a town. I feel as if I were buried alive comin'\nback here, such an out-o'-t'-way place after t' Side, wheere there's\nmany a hundred carts and carriages goes past in a day. I've a great\nmind for t' tak yo' two lassies back wi' me, and let yo' see a bit\no' t' world; may-be, I may yet.\n\nHer sister Bessy looked much pleased with this plan, but Sylvia was\nrather inclined to take offence at Molly's patronizing ways, and\nreplied,--\n\n'I'm none so fond o' noise and bustle; why, yo'll not be able to\nhear yoursels speak wi' all them carts and carriages. I'd rayther\nbide at home; let alone that mother can't spare me.'\n\nIt was, perhaps, a rather ungracious way of answering Molly\nBrunton's speech, and so she felt it to be, although her invitation\nhad been none of the most courteously worded. She irritated Sylvia\nstill further by repeating her last words,--\n\n'\"Mother can't spare me;\" why, mother 'll have to spare thee\nsometime, when t' time for wedding comes.'\n\n'I'm none going to be wed,' said Sylvia; 'and if I were, I'd niver\ngo far fra' mother.'\n\n'Eh! what a spoilt darling it is. How Brunton will laugh when I tell\nhim about yo'; Brunton's a rare one for laughin'. It's a great thing\nto have got such a merry man for a husband. Why! he has his joke for\nevery one as comes into t' shop; and he'll ha' something funny to\nsay to everything this evenin'.'\n\nBessy saw that Sylvia was annoyed, and, with more delicacy than her\nsister, she tried to turn the conversation.\n\n'That's a pretty ribbon in thy hair, Sylvia; I'd like to have one o'\nt' same pattern. Feyther likes pickled walnuts stuck about t' round\no' beef, Molly.'\n\n'I know what I'm about,' replied Mrs. Brunton, with a toss of her\nmarried head.\n\nBessy resumed her inquiry.\n\n'Is there any more to be had wheere that come fra', Sylvia?'\n\n'I don't know,' replied Sylvia. 'It come fra' Foster's, and yo' can\nask.'\n\n'What might it cost?' said Betsy, fingering an end of it to test its\nquality.\n\n'I can't tell,' said Sylvia, 'it were a present.'\n\n'Niver mak' ado about t' price,' said Molly; 'I'll gi'e thee enough\non 't to tie up thy hair, just like Sylvia's. Only thou hastn't such\nwealth o' curls as she has; it'll niver look t' same i' thy straight\nlocks. And who might it be as give it thee, Sylvia?' asked the\nunscrupulous, if good-natured Molly.\n\n'My cousin Philip, him as is shopman at Foster's,' said Sylvia,\ninnocently. But it was far too good an opportunity for the exercise\nof Molly's kind of wit for her to pass over.\n\n'Oh, oh! our cousin Philip, is it? and he'll not be living so far\naway from your mother? I've no need be a witch to put two and two\ntogether. He's a coming here to-night, isn't he, Bessy?'\n\n'I wish yo' wouldn't talk so, Molly,' said Sylvia; 'me and Philip is\ngood enough friends, but we niver think on each other in that way;\nleastways, I don't.'\n\n'(Sweet butter! now that's my mother's old-fashioned way; as if\nfolks must eat sweet butter now-a-days, because her mother did!)\nThat way,' continued Molly, in the manner that annoyed Sylvia so\nmuch, repeating her words as if for the purpose of laughing at them.\n'\"That way?\" and pray what is t' way yo're speaking on? I niver said\nnought about marrying, did I, that yo' need look so red and\nshamefaced about yo'r cousin Philip? But, as Brunton says, if t' cap\nfits yo', put it on. I'm glad he's comin' to-night tho', for as I'm\ndone makin' love and courtin', it's next best t' watch other folks;\nan' yo'r face, Sylvia, has letten me into a secret, as I'd some\nglimpses on afore I was wed.'\n\nSylvia secretly determined not to speak a word more to Philip than\nshe could help, and wondered how she could ever have liked Molly at\nall, much less have made a companion of her. The table was now laid\nout, and nothing remained but to criticize the arrangement a little.\n\nBessy was full of admiration.\n\n'Theere, Molly!' said she. 'Yo' niver seed more vittle brought\ntogether i' Newcassel, I'll be bound; there'll be above half a\nhundredweight o' butcher's meat, beside pies and custards. I've\neaten no dinner these two days for thinking on 't; it's been a weary\nburden on my mind, but it's off now I see how well it looks. I told\nmother not to come near it till we'd spread it all out, and now I'll\ngo fetch her.'\n\nBessy ran off into the house-place.\n\n'It's well enough in a country kind o' way,' said Molly, with the\nfaint approbation of condescension. 'But if I'd thought on, I'd ha'\nbrought 'em down a beast or two done i' sponge-cake, wi' currants\nfor his eyes to give t' table an air.'\n\nThe door was opened, and Bessy came in smiling and blushing with\nproud pleasure. Her mother followed her on tip-toe, smoothing down\nher apron, and with her voice subdued to a whisper:--\n\n'Ay, my lass, it _is_ fine! But dunnot mak' an ado about it, let 'em\nthink it's just our common way. If any one says aught about how good\nt' vittle is, tak' it calm, and say we'n better i' t' house,--it'll\nmak' 'em eat wi' a better appetite, and think the more on us.\nSylvie, I'm much beholden t' ye for comin' so early, and helpin' t'\nlasses, but yo' mun come in t' house-place now, t' folks is\ngatherin', an' yo'r cousin's been asking after yo' a'ready.'\n\nMolly gave her a nudge, which made Sylvia's face go all aflame with\nangry embarrassment. She was conscious that the watching which Molly\nhad threatened her with began directly; for Molly went up to her\nhusband, and whispered something to him which set him off in a\nchuckling laugh, and Sylvia was aware that his eyes followed her\nabout with knowing looks all the evening. She would hardly speak to\nPhilip, and pretended not to see his outstretched hand, but passed\non to the chimney-corner, and tried to shelter herself behind the\nbroad back of farmer Corney, who had no notion of relinquishing his\ncustomary place for all the young people who ever came to the\nhouse,--or for any old people either, for that matter. It was his\nhousehold throne, and there he sat with no more idea of abdicating\nin favour of any comer than King George at St James's. But he was\nglad to see his friends; and had paid them the unwonted compliment\nof shaving on a week-day, and putting on his Sunday coat. The united\nefforts of wife and children had failed to persuade him to make any\nfarther change in his attire; to all their arguments on this head he\nhad replied,--\n\n'Them as doesn't like t' see me i' my work-a-day wescut and breeches\nmay bide away.'\n\nIt was the longest sentence he said that day, but he repeated it\nseveral times over. He was glad enough to see all the young people,\nbut they were not 'of his kidney,' as he expressed it to himself,\nand he did not feel any call upon himself to entertain them. He left\nthat to his bustling wife, all smartness and smiles, and to his\ndaughters and son-in-law. His efforts at hospitality consisted in\nsitting still, smoking his pipe; when any one came, he took it out\nof his mouth for an instant, and nodded his head in a cheerful\nfriendly way, without a word of speech; and then returned to his\nsmoking with the greater relish for the moment's intermission. He\nthought to himself:--\n\n'They're a set o' young chaps as thinks more on t' lasses than on\nbaccy;--they'll find out their mistake in time; give 'em time, give\n'em time.'\n\nAnd before eight o'clock, he went as quietly as a man of twelve\nstone can upstairs to bed, having made a previous arrangement with\nhis wife that she should bring him up about two pounds of spiced\nbeef, and a hot tumbler of stiff grog. But at the beginning of the\nevening he formed a good screen for Sylvia, who was rather a\nfavourite with the old man, for twice he spoke to her.\n\n'Feyther smokes?'\n\n'Yes,' said Sylvia.\n\n'Reach me t' baccy-box, my lass.'\n\nAnd that was all the conversation that passed between her and her\nnearest neighbour for the first quarter of an hour after she came\ninto company.\n\nBut, for all her screen, she felt a pair of eyes were fixed upon her\nwith a glow of admiration deepening their honest brightness.\nSomehow, look in what direction she would, she caught the glance of\nthose eyes before she could see anything else. So she played with\nher apron-strings, and tried not to feel so conscious. There were\nanother pair of eyes,--not such beautiful, sparkling\neyes,--deep-set, earnest, sad, nay, even gloomy, watching her every\nmovement; but of this she was not aware. Philip had not recovered\nfrom the rebuff she had given him by refusing his offered hand, and\nwas standing still, in angry silence, when Mrs. Corney thrust a young\nwoman just arrived upon his attention.\n\n'Come, Measter Hepburn, here's Nancy Pratt wi'out ev'n a soul to\nspeak t' her, an' yo' mopin' theere. She says she knows yo' by sight\nfra' having dealt at Foster's these six year. See if yo' can't find\nsummut t' say t' each other, for I mun go pour out tea. Dixons, an'\nWalkers, an' Elliotts, an' Smiths is come,' said she, marking off\nthe families on her fingers, as she looked round and called over\ntheir names; 'an' there's only Will Latham an' his two sisters, and\nRoger Harbottle, an' Taylor t' come; an' they'll turn up afore tea's\nended.'\n\nSo she went off to her duty at the one table, which, placed\nalongside of the dresser, was the only article of furniture left in\nthe middle of the room: all the seats being arranged as close to the\nfour walls as could be managed. The candles of those days gave but a\nfaint light compared to the light of the immense fire, which it was\na point of hospitality to keep at the highest roaring, blazing\npitch; the young women occupied the seats, with the exception of two\nor three of the elder ones, who, in an eager desire to show their\ncapability, insisted on helping Mrs. Corney in her duties, very much\nto her annoyance, as there were certain little contrivances for\neking out cream, and adjusting the strength of the cups of tea to\nthe worldly position of the intended drinkers, which she did not\nlike every one to see. The young men,--whom tea did not embolden,\nand who had as yet had no chance of stronger liquor,--clustered in\nrustic shyness round the door, not speaking even to themselves,\nexcept now and then, when one, apparently the wag of the party, made\nsome whispered remark, which set them all off laughing; but in a\nminute they checked themselves, and passed the back of their hands\nacross their mouths to compose that unlucky feature, and then some\nwould try to fix their eyes on the rafters of the ceiling, in a\nmanner which was decorous if rather abstracted from the business in\nhand. Most of these were young farmers, with whom Philip had nothing\nin common, and from whom, in shy reserve, he had withdrawn himself\nwhen he first came in. But now he wished himself among them sooner\nthan set to talk to Nancy Pratt, when he had nothing to say. And yet\nhe might have had a companion less to his mind, for she was a decent\nyoung woman of a sober age, less inclined to giggle than many of the\nyounger ones. But all the time that he was making commonplace\nremarks to her he was wondering if he had offended Sylvia, and why\nshe would not shake hands with him, and this pre-occupation of his\nthoughts did not make him an agreeable companion. Nancy Pratt, who\nhad been engaged for some years to a mate of a whaling-ship,\nperceived something of his state of mind, and took no offence at it;\non the contrary, she tried to give him pleasure by admiring Sylvia.\n\n'I've often heerd tell on her,' said she, 'but I niver thought she's\nbe so pretty, and so staid and quiet-like too. T' most part o' girls\nas has looks like hers are always gape-gazing to catch other folks's\neyes, and see what is thought on 'em; but she looks just like a\nchild, a bit flustered wi' coming into company, and gettin' into as\ndark a corner and bidin' as still as she can.\n\nJust then Sylvia lifted up her long, dark lashes, and catching the\nsame glance which she had so often met before--Charley Kinraid was\nstanding talking to Brunton on the opposite side of the\nfire-place--she started back into the shadow as if she had not\nexpected it, and in so doing spilt her tea all over her gown. She\ncould almost have cried, she felt herself so awkward, and as if\neverything was going wrong with her; she thought that every one\nwould think she had never been in company before, and did not know\nhow to behave; and while she was thus fluttered and crimson, she saw\nthrough her tearful eyes Kinraid on his knees before her, wiping her\ngown with his silk pocket handkerchief, and heard him speaking\nthrough all the buzz of commiserating voices.\n\n'Your cupboard handle is so much i' th' way--I hurt my elbow\nagainst it only this very afternoon.'\n\nSo perhaps it was no clumsiness of hers,--as they would all know,\nnow, since he had so skilfully laid the blame somewhere else; and\nafter all it turned out that her accident had been the means of\nbringing him across to her side, which was much more pleasant than\nhaving him opposite, staring at her; for now he began to talk to\nher, and this was very pleasant, although she was rather embarrassed\nat their _tete-a-tete_ at first.\n\n'I did not know you again when I first saw you,' said he, in a tone\nwhich implied a good deal more than was uttered in words.\n\n'I knowed yo' at once,' she replied, softly, and then she blushed\nand played with her apron-string, and wondered if she ought to have\nconfessed to the clearness of her recollection.\n\n'You're grown up into--well, perhaps it's not manners to say what\nyou're grown into--anyhow, I shan't forget yo' again.'\n\nMore playing with her apron-string, and head hung still lower down,\nthough the corners of her mouth would go up in a shy smile of\npleasure. Philip watched it all as greedily as if it gave him\ndelight.\n\n'Yo'r father, he'll be well and hearty, I hope?' asked Charley.\n\n'Yes,' replied Sylvia, and then she wished she could originate some\nremark; he would think her so stupid if she just kept on saying such\nlittle short bits of speeches, and if he thought her stupid he might\nperhaps go away again to his former place.\n\nBut he was quite far enough gone in love of her beauty, and pretty\nmodest ways, not to care much whether she talked or no, so long as\nshe showed herself so pleasingly conscious of his close\nneighbourhood.\n\n'I must come and see the old gentleman; and your mother, too,' he\nadded more slowly, for he remembered that his visits last year had\nnot been quite so much welcomed by Bell Robson as by her husband;\nperhaps it was because of the amount of drink which he and Daniel\nmanaged to get through of an evening. He resolved this year to be\nmore careful to please the mother of Sylvia.\n\nWhen tea was ended there was a great bustle and shifting of places,\nwhile Mrs. Corney and her daughters carried out trays full of used\ncups, and great platters of uneaten bread and butter into the\nback-kitchen, to be washed up after the guests were gone. Just\nbecause she was so conscious that she did not want to move, and\nbreak up the little conversation between herself and Kinraid, Sylvia\nforced herself to be as active in the service going on as became a\nfriend of the house; and she was too much her mother's own daughter\nto feel comfortable at leaving all the things in the disorder which\nto the Corney girls was second nature.\n\n'This milk mun go back to t' dairy, I reckon,' said she, loading\nherself with milk and cream.\n\n'Niver fash thysel' about it,' said Nelly Corney, 'Christmas comes\nbut onest a year, if it does go sour; and mother said she'd have a\ngame at forfeits first thing after tea to loosen folks's tongues,\nand mix up t' lads and lasses, so come along.'\n\nBut Sylvia steered her careful way to the cold chill of the dairy,\nand would not be satisfied till she had carried away all the unused\nprovision into some fresher air than that heated by the fires and\novens used for the long day's cooking of pies and cakes and much\nroast meat.\n\nWhen they came back a round of red-faced 'lads,' as young men up to\nfive-and-thirty are called in Lancashire and Yorkshire if they are\nnot married before, and lasses, whose age was not to be defined,\nwere playing at some country game, in which the women were\napparently more interested than the men, who looked shamefaced, and\nafraid of each other's ridicule. Mrs. Corney, however, knew how to\nremedy this, and at a sign from her a great jug of beer was brought\nin. This jug was the pride of her heart, and was in the shape of a\nfat man in white knee-breeches, and a three-cornered hat; with one\narm he supported the pipe in his broad, smiling mouth, and the other\nwas placed akimbo and formed the handle. There was also a great\nchina punch-bowl filled with grog made after an old ship-receipt\ncurrent in these parts, but not too strong, because if their\nvisitors had too much to drink at that early part of the evening 'it\nwould spoil t' fun,' as Nelly Corney had observed. Her father,\nhowever, after the notions of hospitality prevalent at that time in\nhigher circles, had stipulated that each man should have 'enough'\nbefore he left the house; enough meaning in Monkshaven parlance the\nliberty of getting drunk, if they thought fit to do it.\n\nBefore long one of the lads was seized with a fit of admiration for\nToby--the name of the old gentleman who contained liquor--and went\nup to the tray for a closer inspection. He was speedily followed by\nother amateurs of curious earthenware; and by-and-by Mr. Brunton (who\nhad been charged by his mother-in-law with the due supplying of\nliquor--by his father-in-law that every man should have his fill,\nand by his wife and her sisters that no one should have too much, at\nany rate at the beginning of the evening,) thought fit to carry out\nToby to be replenished; and a faster spirit of enjoyment and mirth\nbegan to reign in the room.\n\nKinraid was too well seasoned to care what amount of liquor he\ndrank; Philip had what was called a weak head, and disliked muddling\nhimself with drink because of the immediate consequence of intense\nfeelings of irritability, and the more distant one of a racking\nheadache next day; so both these two preserved very much the same\ndemeanour they had held at the beginning of the evening.\n\nSylvia was by all acknowledged and treated as the belle. When they\nplayed at blind-man's-buff go where she would, she was always\ncaught; she was called out repeatedly to do what was required in any\ngame, as if all had a pleasure in seeing her light figure and deft\nways. She was sufficiently pleased with this to have got over her\nshyness with all except Charley. When others paid her their rustic\ncompliments she tossed her head, and made her little saucy\nrepartees; but when he said something low and flattering, it was too\nhoney-sweet to her heart to be thrown off thus. And, somehow, the\nmore she yielded to this fascination the more she avoided Philip. He\ndid not speak flatteringly--he did not pay compliments--he watched\nher with discontented, longing eyes, and grew more inclined every\nmoment, as he remembered his anticipation of a happy evening, to cry\nout in his heart _vanitas vanitatum_.\n\nAnd now came crying the forfeits. Molly Brunton knelt down, her face\nburied in her mother's lap; the latter took out the forfeits one by\none, and as she held them up, said the accustomed formula,--\n\n'A fine thing and a very fine thing, what must he (or she) do who\nowns this thing.'\n\nOne or two had been told to kneel to the prettiest, bow to the\nwittiest, and kiss those they loved best; others had had to bite an\ninch off the poker, or such plays upon words. And now came Sylvia's\npretty new ribbon that Philip had given her (he almost longed to\nsnatch it out of Mrs. Corney's hands and burn it before all their\nfaces, so annoyed was he with the whole affair.)\n\n'A fine thing and a very fine thing--a most particular fine\nthing--choose how she came by it. What must she do as owns this\nthing?'\n\n'She must blow out t' candle and kiss t' candlestick.'\n\nIn one instant Kinraid had hold of the only candle within reach, all\nthe others had been put up high on inaccessible shelves and other\nplaces. Sylvia went up and blew out the candle, and before the\nsudden partial darkness was over he had taken the candle into his\nfingers, and, according to the traditional meaning of the words, was\nin the place of the candlestick, and as such was to be kissed. Every\none laughed at innocent Sylvia's face as the meaning of her penance\ncame into it, every one but Philip, who almost choked.\n\n'I'm candlestick,' said Kinraid, with less of triumph in his voice\nthan he would have had with any other girl in the room.\n\n'Yo' mun kiss t' candlestick,' cried the Corneys, 'or yo'll niver\nget yo'r ribbon back.'\n\n'And she sets a deal o' store by that ribbon,' said Molly Brunton,\nmaliciously.\n\n'I'll none kiss t' candlestick, nor him either,' said Sylvia, in a\nlow voice of determination, turning away, full of confusion.\n\n'Yo'll not get yo'r ribbon if yo' dunnot,' cried one and all.\n\n'I don't care for t' ribbon,' said she, flashing up with a look at\nher tormentors, now her back was turned to Kinraid. 'An' I wunnot\nplay any more at such like games,' she added, with fresh indignation\nrising in her heart as she took her old place in the corner of the\nroom a little away from the rest.\n\nPhilip's spirits rose, and he yearned to go to her and tell her how\nhe approved of her conduct. Alas, Philip! Sylvia, though as modest a\ngirl as ever lived, was no prude, and had been brought up in simple,\nstraightforward country ways; and with any other young man,\nexcepting, perhaps, Philip's self, she would have thought no more of\nmaking a rapid pretence of kissing the hand or cheek of the\ntemporary 'candlestick', than our ancestresses did in a much higher\nrank on similar occasions. Kinraid, though mortified by his public\nrejection, was more conscious of this than the inexperienced Philip;\nhe resolved not to be baulked, and watched his opportunity. For the\ntime he went on playing as if Sylvia's conduct had not affected him\nin the least, and as if he was hardly aware of her defection from\nthe game. As she saw others submitting, quite as a matter of course,\nto similar penances, she began to be angry with herself for having\nthought twice about it, and almost to dislike herself for the\nstrange consciousness which had made it at the time seem impossible\nto do what she was told. Her eyes kept filling with tears as her\nisolated position in the gay party, the thought of what a fool she\nhad made of herself, kept recurring to her mind; but no one saw her,\nshe thought, thus crying; and, ashamed to be discovered when the\nparty should pause in their game, she stole round behind them into\nthe great chamber in which she had helped to lay out the supper,\nwith the intention of bathing her eyes, and taking a drink of water.\nOne instant Charley Kinraid was missing from the circle of which he\nwas the life and soul; and then back he came with an air of\nsatisfaction on his face, intelligible enough to those who had seen\nhis game; but unnoticed by Philip, who, amidst the perpetual noise\nand movements around him, had not perceived Sylvia's leaving the\nroom, until she came back at the end of about a quarter of an hour,\nlooking lovelier than ever, her complexion brilliant, her eyes\ndrooping, her hair neatly and freshly arranged, tied with a brown\nribbon instead of that she was supposed to have forfeited. She\nlooked as if she did not wish her return to be noticed, stealing\nsoftly behind the romping lads and lasses with noiseless motions,\nand altogether such a contrast to them in her cool freshness and\nmodest neatness, that both Kinraid and Philip found it difficult to\nkeep their eyes off her. But the former had a secret triumph in his\nheart which enabled him to go on with his merry-making as if it\nabsorbed him; while Philip dropped out of the crowd and came up to\nwhere she was standing silently by Mrs. Corney, who, arms akimbo, was\nlaughing at the frolic and fun around her. Sylvia started a little\nwhen Philip spoke, and kept her soft eyes averted from him after the\nfirst glance; she answered him shortly, but with unaccustomed\ngentleness. He had only asked her when she would like him to take\nher home; and she, a little surprised at the idea of going home when\nto her the evening seemed only beginning, had answered--\n\n'Go home? I don't know! It's New Year's eve!'\n\n'Ay! but yo'r mother 'll lie awake till yo' come home, Sylvie!'\n\nBut Mrs. Corney, having heard his question, broke in with all sorts\nof upbraidings. 'Go home! Not see t' New Year in! Why, what should\ntake 'em home these six hours? Wasn't there a moon as clear as day?\nand did such a time as this come often? And were they to break up\nthe party before the New Year came in? And was there not supper,\nwith a spiced round of beef that had been in pickle pretty nigh sin'\nMartinmas, and hams, and mince-pies, and what not? And if they\nthought any evil of her master's going to bed, or that by that early\nretirement he meant to imply that he did not bid his friends\nwelcome, why he would not stay up beyond eight o'clock for King\nGeorge upon his throne, as he'd tell them soon enough, if they'd\nonly step upstairs and ask him. Well; she knowed what it was to want\na daughter when she was ailing, so she'd say nought more, but hasten\nsupper.\n\nAnd this idea now took possession of Mrs. Corney's mind, for she\nwould not willingly allow one of her guests to leave before they had\ndone justice to her preparations; and, cutting her speech short, she\nhastily left Sylvia and Philip together.\n\nHis heart beat fast; his feeling towards her had never been so\nstrong or so distinct as since her refusal to kiss the\n'candlestick.' He was on the point of speaking, of saying something\nexplicitly tender, when the wooden trencher which the party were\nusing at their play, came bowling between him and Sylvia, and spun\nout its little period right betwixt them. Every one was moving from\nchair to chair, and when the bustle was over Sylvia was seated at\nsome distance from him, and he left standing outside the circle, as\nif he were not playing. In fact, Sylvia had unconsciously taken his\nplace as actor in the game while he remained spectator, and, as it\nturned out, an auditor of a conversation not intended for his ears.\nHe was wedged against the wall, close to the great eight-day clock,\nwith its round moon-like smiling face forming a ludicrous contrast\nto his long, sallow, grave countenance, which was pretty much at the\nsame level above the sanded floor. Before him sat Molly Brunton and\none of her sisters, their heads close together in too deep talk to\nattend to the progress of the game. Philip's attention was caught by\nthe words--\n\n'I'll lay any wager he kissed her when he ran off into t' parlour.'\n\n'She's so coy she'd niver let him,' replied Bessy Corney.\n\n'She couldn't help hersel'; and for all she looks so demure and prim\nnow' (and then both heads were turned in the direction of Sylvia),\n'I'm as sure as I'm born that Charley is not t' chap to lose his\nforfeit; and yet yo' see he says nought more about it, and she's\nleft off being 'feared of him.'\n\nThere was something in Sylvia's look, ay, and in Charley Kinraid's,\ntoo, that shot conviction into Philip's mind. He watched them\nincessantly during the interval before supper; they were intimate,\nand yet shy with each other, in a manner that enraged while it\nbewildered Philip. What was Charley saying to her in that whispered\nvoice, as they passed each other? Why did they linger near each\nother? Why did Sylvia look so dreamily happy, so startled at every\ncall of the game, as if recalled from some pleasant idea? Why did\nKinraid's eyes always seek her while hers were averted, or downcast,\nand her cheeks all aflame? Philip's dark brow grew darker as he\ngazed. He, too, started when Mrs. Corney, close at his elbow, bade\nhim go in to supper along with some of the elder ones, who were not\nplaying; for the parlour was not large enough to hold all at once,\neven with the squeezing and cramming, and sitting together on\nchairs, which was not at all out of etiquette at Monkshaven. Philip\nwas too reserved to express his disappointment and annoyance at\nbeing thus arrested in his painful watch over Sylvia; but he had no\nappetite for the good things set before him, and found it hard work\nto smile a sickly smile when called upon by Josiah Pratt for\napplause at some country joke. When supper was ended, there was some\nlittle discussion between Mrs. Corney and her son-in-law as to\nwhether the different individuals of the company should be called\nupon for songs or stories, as was the wont at such convivial\nmeetings. Brunton had been helping his mother-in-law in urging\npeople to eat, heaping their plates over their shoulders with\nunexpected good things, filling the glasses at the upper end of the\ntable, and the mugs which supplied the deficiency of glasses at the\nlower. And now, every one being satisfied, not to say stuffed to\nrepletion, the two who had been attending to their wants stood\nstill, hot and exhausted.\n\n'They're a'most stawed,' said Mrs. Corney, with a pleased smile.\n'It'll be manners t' ask some one as knows how to sing.'\n\n'It may be manners for full men, but not for fasting,' replied\nBrunton. 'Folks in t' next room will be wanting their victual, and\nsinging is allays out o' tune to empty bellies.'\n\n'But there's them here as 'll take it ill if they're not asked. I\nheerd Josiah Pratt a-clearing his throat not a minute ago, an' he\nthinks as much on his singin' as a cock does on his crowin'.'\n\n'If one sings I'm afeard all on 'em will like to hear their own\npipes.'\n\nBut their dilemma was solved by Bessy Corney, who opened the door to\nsee if the hungry ones outside might not come in for their share of\nthe entertainment; and in they rushed, bright and riotous, scarcely\ngiving the first party time to rise from their seats ere they took\ntheir places. One or two young men, released from all their previous\nshyness, helped Mrs. Corney and her daughters to carry off such\ndishes as were actually empty. There was no time for changing or\nwashing of plates; but then, as Mrs. Corney laughingly observed,--\n\n'We're a' on us friends, and some on us mayhap sweethearts; so no\nneed to be particular about plates. Them as gets clean ones is\nlucky; and them as doesn't, and cannot put up wi' plates that has\nbeen used, mun go without.'\n\nIt seemed to be Philip's luck this night to be pent up in places;\nfor again the space between the benches and the wall was filled up\nby the in-rush before he had time to make his way out; and all he\ncould do was to sit quiet where he was. But between the busy heads\nand over-reaching arms he could see Charley and Sylvia, sitting\nclose together, talking and listening more than eating. She was in a\nnew strange state of happiness not to be reasoned about, or\naccounted for, but in a state of more exquisite feeling than she had\never experienced before; when, suddenly lifting her eyes, she caught\nPhilip's face of extreme displeasure.\n\n'Oh,' said she, 'I must go. There's Philip looking at me so.'\n\n'Philip!' said Kinraid, with a sudden frown upon his face.\n\n'My cousin,' she replied, instinctively comprehending what had\nflashed into his mind, and anxious to disclaim the suspicion of\nhaving a lover. 'Mother told him to see me home, and he's noan one\nfor staying up late.'\n\n'But you needn't go. I'll see yo' home.'\n\n'Mother's but ailing,' said Sylvia, a little conscience-smitten at\nhaving so entirely forgotten everything in the delight of the\npresent, 'and I said I wouldn't be late.'\n\n'And do you allays keep to your word?' asked he, with a tender\nmeaning in his tone.\n\n'Allays; leastways I think so,' replied she, blushing.\n\n'Then if I ask you not to forget me, and you give me your word, I\nmay be sure you'll keep it.'\n\n'It wasn't I as forgot you,' said Sylvia, so softly as not to be\nheard by him.\n\nHe tried to make her repeat what she had said, but she would not,\nand he could only conjecture that it was something more tell-tale\nthan she liked to say again, and that alone was very charming to\nhim.\n\n'I shall walk home with you,' said he, as Sylvia at last rose to\ndepart, warned by a further glimpse of Philip's angry face.\n\n'No!' said she, hastily, 'I can't do with yo''; for somehow she felt\nthe need of pacifying Philip, and knew in her heart that a third\nperson joining their _tete-a-tete_ walk would only increase his\ndispleasure.\n\n'Why not?' said Charley, sharply.\n\n'Oh! I don't know, only please don't!'\n\nBy this time her cloak and hood were on, and she was slowly making\nher way down her side of the room followed by Charley, and often\ninterrupted by indignant remonstrances against her departure, and\nthe early breaking-up of the party. Philip stood, hat in hand, in\nthe doorway between the kitchen and parlour, watching her so\nintently that he forgot to be civil, and drew many a jest and gibe\nupon him for his absorption in his pretty cousin.\n\nWhen Sylvia reached him, he said,--\n\n'Yo're ready at last, are yo'?'\n\n'Yes,' she replied, in her little beseeching tone. 'Yo've not been\nwanting to go long, han yo'? I ha' but just eaten my supper.'\n\n'Yo've been so full of talk, that's been the reason your supper\nlasted so long. That fellow's none going wi' us?' said he sharply,\nas he saw Kinraid rummaging for his cap in a heap of men's clothes,\nthrown into the back-kitchen.\n\n'No,' said Sylvia, in affright at Philip's fierce look and\npassionate tone. 'I telled him not.'\n\nBut at that moment the heavy outer door was opened by Daniel Robson\nhimself--bright, broad, and rosy, a jolly impersonation of Winter.\nHis large drover's coat was covered with snow-flakes, and through\nthe black frame of the doorway might be seen a white waste world of\nsweeping fell and field, with the dark air filled with the pure\ndown-fall. Robson stamped his snow-laden feet and shook himself\nwell, still standing on the mat, and letting a cold frosty current\nof fresh air into the great warm kitchen. He laughed at them all\nbefore he spoke.\n\n'It's a coud new year as I'm lettin' in though it's noan t' new year\nyet. Yo'll a' be snowed up, as sure as my name s Dannel, if yo' stop\nfor twel' o'clock. Yo'd better mak' haste and go whoam. Why,\nCharley, my lad! how beest ta? who'd ha' thought o' seeing thee i'\nthese parts again! Nay, missus, nay, t' new year mun find its way\nint' t' house by itsel' for me; for a ha' promised my oud woman to\nbring Sylvie whoam as quick as may-be; she's lyin' awake and\nfrettin' about t' snow and what not. Thank yo' kindly, missus, but\na'll tak' nought to eat; just a drop o' somethin' hot to keep out\ncoud, and wish yo' a' the compliments o' the season. Philip, my man,\nyo'll not be sorry to be spared t' walk round by Haytersbank such a\nneet. My missus were i' such a way about Sylvie that a thought a'd\njust step off mysel', and have a peep at yo' a', and bring her some\nwraps. Yo'r sheep will be a' folded, a reckon, Measter Pratt, for\nthere'll niver be a nibble o' grass to be seen this two month,\naccordin' to my readin'; and a've been at sea long enough, and on\nland long enough t' know signs and wonders. It's good stuff that,\nany way, and worth comin' for,' after he had gulped down a\ntumblerful of half-and-half grog. 'Kinraid, if ta doesn't come and\nsee me afore thou'rt many days ouder, thee and me'll have words.\nCome, Sylvie, what art ta about, keepin' me here? Here's Mistress\nCorney mixin' me another jorum. Well, this time a'll give \"T'\nmarried happy, and t' single wed!\"'\n\nSylvia was all this while standing by her father quite ready for\ndeparture, and not a little relieved by his appearance as her convoy\nhome.\n\n'I'm ready to see Haytersbank to-night, master!' said Kinraid, with\neasy freedom--a freedom which Philip envied, but could not have\nimitated, although he was deeply disappointed at the loss of his\nwalk with Sylvia, when he had intended to exercise the power his\naunt had delegated to him of remonstrance if her behaviour had been\nlight or thoughtless, and of warning if he saw cause to disapprove\nof any of her associates.\n\nAfter the Robsons had left, a blank fell upon both Charley and\nPhilip. In a few minutes, however, the former, accustomed to prompt\ndecision, resolved that she and no other should be his wife.\nAccustomed to popularity among women, and well versed in the\nincipient signs of their liking for him, he anticipated no\ndifficulty in winning her. Satisfied with the past, and pleasantly\nhopeful about the future, he found it easy to turn his attention to\nthe next prettiest girl in the room, and to make the whole gathering\nbright with his ready good temper and buoyant spirit.\n\nMrs. Corney had felt it her duty to press Philip to stay, now that,\nas she said, he had no one but himself to see home, and the new year\nso near coming in. To any one else in the room she would have added\nthe clinching argument, 'A shall take it very unkind if yo' go now';\nbut somehow she could not say this, for in truth Philip's look\nshowed that he would be but a wet blanket on the merriment of the\nparty. So, with as much civility as could be mustered up between\nthem, he took leave. Shutting the door behind him, he went out into\nthe dreary night, and began his lonesome walk back to Monkshaven.\nThe cold sleet almost blinded him as the sea-wind drove it straight\nin his face; it cut against him as it was blown with drifting force.\nThe roar of the wintry sea came borne on the breeze; there was more\nlight from the whitened ground than from the dark laden sky above.\nThe field-paths would have been a matter of perplexity, had it not\nbeen for the well-known gaps in the dyke-side, which showed the\nwhitened land beyond, between the two dark stone walls. Yet he went\nclear and straight along his way, having unconsciously left all\nguidance to the animal instinct which co-exists with the human soul,\nand sometimes takes strange charge of the human body, when all the\nnobler powers of the individual are absorbed in acute suffering. At\nlength he was in the lane, toiling up the hill, from which, by day,\nMonkshaven might be seen. Now all features of the landscape before\nhim were lost in the darkness of night, against which the white\nflakes came closer and nearer, thicker and faster. On a sudden, the\nbells of Monkshaven church rang out a welcome to the new year, 1796.\nFrom the direction of the wind, it seemed as if the sound was flung\nwith strength and power right into Philip's face. He walked down the\nhill to its merry sound--its merry sound, his heavy heart. As he\nentered the long High Street of Monkshaven he could see the watching\nlights put out in parlour, chamber, or kitchen. The new year had\ncome, and expectation was ended. Reality had begun.\n\nHe turned to the right, into the court where he lodged with Alice\nRose. There was a light still burning there, and cheerful voices\nwere heard. He opened the door; Alice, her daughter, and Coulson\nstood as if awaiting him. Hester's wet cloak hung on a chair before\nthe fire; she had her hood on, for she and Coulson had been to the\nwatch-night.\n\nThe solemn excitement of the services had left its traces upon her\ncountenance and in her mind. There was a spiritual light in her\nusually shadowed eyes, and a slight flush on her pale cheek. Merely\npersonal and self-conscious feelings were merged in a loving\ngood-will to all her fellow-creatures. Under the influence of this\nlarge charity, she forgot her habitual reserve, and came forward as\nPhilip entered to meet him with her new year's wishes--wishes that\nshe had previously interchanged with the other two.\n\n'A happy new year to you, Philip, and may God have you in his\nkeeping all the days thereof!'\n\nHe took her hand, and shook it warmly in reply. The flush on her\ncheek deepened as she withdrew it. Alice Rose said something curtly\nabout the lateness of the hour and her being much tired; and then\nshe and her daughter went upstairs to the front chamber, and Philip\nand Coulson to that which they shared at the back of the house.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII\n\nPERPLEXITIES\n\n\nCoulson and Philip were friendly, but not intimate. They never had\nhad a dispute, they never were confidential with each other; in\ntruth, they were both reserved and silent men, and, probably,\nrespected each other the more for being so self-contained. There was\na private feeling in Coulson's heart which would have made a less\namiable fellow dislike Philip. But of this the latter was\nunconscious: they were not apt to exchange many words in the room\nwhich they occupied jointly.\n\nCoulson asked Philip if he had enjoyed himself at the Corneys', and\nPhilip replied,--\n\n'Not much; such parties are noane to my liking.'\n\n'And yet thou broke off from t' watch-night to go there.'\n\nNo answer; so Coulson went on, with a sense of the duty laid upon\nhim, to improve the occasion--the first that had presented itself\nsince the good old Methodist minister had given his congregation the\nsolemn warning to watch over the opportunities of various kinds\nwhich the coming year would present.\n\n'Jonas Barclay told us as the pleasures o' this world were like\napples o' Sodom, pleasant to look at, but ashes to taste.'\n\nCoulson wisely left Philip to make the application for himself. If\nhe did he made no sign, but threw himself on his bed with a heavy\nsigh.\n\n'Are yo' not going to undress?' said Coulson, as he covered him up\nin bed.\n\nThere had been a long pause of silence. Philip did not answer him,\nand he thought he had fallen asleep. But he was roused from his\nfirst slumber by Hepburn's soft movements about the room. Philip had\nthought better of it, and, with some penitence in his heart for his\ngruffness to the unoffending Coulson, was trying not to make any\nnoise while he undressed.\n\nBut he could not sleep. He kept seeing the Corneys' kitchen and the\nscenes that had taken place in it, passing like a pageant before his\nclosed eyes. Then he opened them in angry weariness at the recurring\nvision, and tried to make out the outlines of the room and the\nfurniture in the darkness. The white ceiling sloped into the\nwhitewashed walls, and against them he could see the four\nrush-bottomed chairs, the looking-glass hung on one side, the old\ncarved oak-chest (his own property, with the initials of forgotten\nancestors cut upon it), which held his clothes; the boxes that\nbelonged to Coulson, sleeping soundly in the bed in the opposite\ncorner of the room; the casement window in the roof, through which\nthe snowy ground on the steep hill-side could be plainly seen; and\nwhen he got so far as this in the catalogue of the room, he fell\ninto a troubled feverish sleep, which lasted two or three hours; and\nthen he awoke with a start, and a consciousness of uneasiness,\nthough what about he could not remember at first.\n\nWhen he recollected all that had happened the night before, it\nimpressed him much more favourably than it had done at the time. If\nnot joy, hope had come in the morning; and, at any rate, he could be\nup and be doing, for the late wintry light was stealing down the\nhill-side, and he knew that, although Coulson lay motionless in his\nsleep, it was past their usual time of rising. Still, as it was new\nyear's Day, a time of some licence, Philip had mercy on his\nfellow-shopman, and did not waken him till just as he was leaving\nthe room.\n\nCarrying his shoes in his hand, he went softly downstairs for he\ncould see from the top of the flight that neither Alice nor her\ndaughter was down yet, as the kitchen shutters were not unclosed. It\nwas Mrs. Rose's habit to rise early, and have all bright and clean\nagainst her lodgers came down; but then, in general, she went to\nrest before nine o'clock, whereas the last night she had not gone\ntill past twelve. Philip went about undoing the shutters, and trying\nto break up the raking coal, with as little noise as might be, for\nhe had compassion on the tired sleepers. The kettle had not been\nfilled, probably because Mrs. Rose had been unable to face the storm\nof the night before, in taking it to the pump just at the entrance\nof the court. When Philip came back from filling it, he found Alice\nand Hester both in the kitchen, and trying to make up for lost time\nby hastening over their work. Hester looked busy and notable with\nher gown pinned up behind her, and her hair all tucked away under a\nclean linen cap; but Alice was angry with herself for her late\nsleeping, and that and other causes made her speak crossly to\nPhilip, as he came in with his snowy feet and well-filled kettle.\n\n'Look the' there! droppin' and drippin' along t' flags as was\ncleaned last night, and meddlin' wi' woman's work as a man has no\nbusiness wi'.'\n\nPhilip was surprised and annoyed. He had found relief from his own\nthoughts in doing what he believed would help others. He gave up the\nkettle to her snatching hands, and sate down behind the door in\nmomentary ill-temper. But the kettle was better filled, and\nconsequently heavier than the old woman expected, and she could not\nmanage to lift it to the crook from which it generally hung\nsuspended. She looked round for Hester, but she was gone into the\nback-kitchen. In a minute Philip was at her side, and had heaved it\nto its place for her. She looked in his face for a moment wistfully,\nbut hardly condescended to thank him; at least the sound of the\nwords did not pass the lips that formed them. Rebuffed by her\nmanner, he went back to his old seat, and mechanically watched the\npreparations for breakfast; but his thoughts went back to the night\nbefore, and the comparative ease of his heart was gone. The first\nstir of a new day had made him feel as if he had had no sufficient\ncause for his annoyance and despondency the previous evening; but\nnow, condemned to sit quiet, he reviewed looks and words, and saw\njust reason for his anxiety. After some consideration he resolved to\ngo that very night to Haytersbank, and have some talk with either\nSylvia or her mother; what the exact nature of this purposed\nconversation should be, he did not determine; much would depend on\nSylvia's manner and mood, and on her mother's state of health; but\nat any rate something would be learnt.\n\nDuring breakfast something was learnt nearer home; though not all\nthat a man less unconscious and more vain than Philip might have\ndiscovered. He only found out that Mrs. Rose was displeased with him\nfor not having gone to the watch-night with Hester, according to the\nplan made some weeks before. But he soothed his conscience by\nremembering that he had made no promise; he had merely spoken of his\nwish to be present at the service, about which Hester was speaking;\nand although at the time and for a good while afterwards, he had\nfully intended going, yet as there had been William Coulson to\naccompany her, his absence could not have been seriously noticed.\nStill he was made uncomfortable by Mrs. Rose's change of manner; once\nor twice he said to himself that she little knew how miserable he\nhad been during his 'gay evening,' as she would persist in calling\nit, or she would not talk at him with such persevering bitterness\nthis morning. Before he left for the shop, he spoke of his intention\nof going to see how his aunt was, and of paying her a new year's day\nvisit.\n\nHepburn and Coulson took it in turns week and week about to go first\nhome to dinner; the one who went first sate down with Mrs. Rose and\nher daughter, instead of having his portion put in the oven to keep\nwarm for him. To-day it was Hepburn's turn to be last. All morning\nthe shop was full with customers, come rather to offer good wishes\nthan to buy, and with an unspoken remembrance of the cake and wine\nwhich the two hospitable brothers Foster made a point of offering to\nall comers on new year's day. It was busy work for all--for Hester\non her side, where caps, ribbons, and women's gear were exclusively\nsold--for the shopmen and boys in the grocery and drapery\ndepartment. Philip was trying to do his business with his mind far\naway; and the consequence was that his manner was not such as to\nrecommend him to the customers, some of whom recollected it as very\ndifferent, courteous and attentive, if grave and sedate. One buxom\nfarmer's wife noticed the change to him. She had a little girl with\nher, of about five years old, that she had lifted up on the counter,\nand who was watching Philip with anxious eyes, occasionally\nwhispering in her mother's ear, and then hiding her face against her\ncloak.\n\n'She's thought a deal o' coming to see yo', and a dunnot think as\nyo' mind her at all. My pretty, he's clean forgotten as how he said\nlast new year's day, he'd gi' thee a barley-sugar stick, if thou'd\nhem him a handkercher by this.'\n\nThe child's face was buried in the comfortable breadth of duffle at\nthese words, while the little outstretched hand held a small square\nof coarse linen.\n\n'Ay, she's noane forgotten it, and has done her five stitches a day,\nbless her; and a dunnot believe as yo' know her again. She's Phoebe\nMoorsom, and a'm Hannah, and a've dealt at t' shop reg'lar this\nfifteen year.'\n\n'I'm very sorry,' said Philip. 'I was up late last night, and I'm a\nbit dazed to-day. Well! this is nice work, Phoebe, and I'm sure I'm\nvery much beholden to yo'. And here's five sticks o' barley-sugar,\none for every stitch, and thank you kindly, Mrs. Moorsom, too.'\n\nPhilip took the handkerchief and hoped he had made honourable amends\nfor his want of recognition. But the wee lassie refused to be lifted\ndown, and whispered something afresh into her mother's ear, who\nsmiled and bade her be quiet. Philip saw, however, that there was\nsome wish ungratified on the part of the little maiden which he was\nexpected to inquire into, and, accordingly, he did his duty.\n\n'She's a little fool; she says yo' promised to gi'e her a kiss, and\nt' make her yo'r wife.'\n\nThe child burrowed her face closer into her mother's neck, and\nrefused to allow the kiss which Philip willingly offered. All he\ncould do was to touch the back of the little white fat neck with his\nlips. The mother carried her off only half satisfied, and Philip\nfelt that he must try and collect his scattered wits, and be more\nalive to the occasion.\n\nTowards the dinner-hour the crowd slackened; Hester began to\nreplenish decanters and bottles, and to bring out a fresh cake\nbefore she went home to dinner; and Coulson and Philip looked over\nthe joint present they always made to her on this day. It was a silk\nhandkerchief of the prettiest colours they could pick out of the\nshop, intended for her to wear round her neck. Each tried to\npersuade the other to give it to her, for each was shy of the act of\npresentation. Coulson was, however, the most resolute; and when she\nreturned from the parlour the little parcel was in Philip's hands.\n\n'Here, Hester,' said he, going round the counter to her, just as she\nwas leaving the shop. 'It's from Coulson and me; a handkerchief for\nyo' to wear; and we wish yo' a happy New Year, and plenty on 'em;\nand there's many a one wishes the same.'\n\nHe took her hand as he said this. She went a little paler, and her\neyes brightened as though they would fill with tears as they met\nhis; she could not have helped it, do what she would. But she only\nsaid, 'Thank yo' kindly,' and going up to Coulson she repeated the\nwords and action to him; and then they went off together to dinner.\n\nThere was a lull of business for the next hour. John and Jeremiah\nwere dining like the rest of the world. Even the elder errand-boy\nhad vanished. Philip rearranged disorderly goods; and then sate down\non the counter by the window; it was the habitual place for the one\nwho stayed behind; for excepting on market-day there was little or\nno custom during the noon-hour. Formerly he used to move the drapery\nwith which the window was ornamented, and watch the passers-by with\ncareless eye. But now, though he seemed to gaze abroad, he saw\nnothing but vacancy. All the morning since he got up he had been\ntrying to fight through his duties--leaning against a hope--a hope\nthat first had bowed, and then had broke as soon as he really tried\nits weight. There was not a sign of Sylvia's liking for him to be\ngathered from the most careful recollection of the past evening. It\nwas of no use thinking that there was. It was better to give it up\naltogether and at once. But what if he could not? What if the\nthought of her was bound up with his life; and that once torn out by\nhis own free will, the very roots of his heart must come also?\n\nNo; he was resolved he would go on; as long as there was life there\nwas hope; as long as Sylvia remained unpledged to any one else,\nthere was a chance for him. He would remodel his behaviour to her.\nHe could not be merry and light-hearted like other young men; his\nnature was not cast in that mould; and the early sorrows that had\nleft him a lonely orphan might have matured, but had not enlivened,\nhis character. He thought with some bitterness on the power of easy\ntalking about trifles which some of those he had met with at the\nCorneys' had exhibited. But then he felt stirring within him a force\nof enduring love which he believed to be unusual, and which seemed\nas if it must compel all things to his wish in the end. A year or so\nago he had thought much of his own cleverness and his painfully\nacquired learning, and he had imagined that these were the qualities\nwhich were to gain Sylvia. But now, whether he had tried them and\nhad failed to win even her admiration, or whether some true instinct\nhad told him that a woman's love may be gained in many ways sooner\nthan by mere learning, he was only angry with himself for his past\nfolly in making himself her school--nay, her taskmaster. To-night,\nthough, he would start off on a new tack. He would not even upbraid\nher for her conduct the night before; he had shown her his\ndispleasure at the time; but she should see how tender and forgiving\nhe could be. He would lure her to him rather than find fault with\nher. There had perhaps been too much of that already.\n\nWhen Coulson came back Philip went to his solitary dinner. In\ngeneral he was quite alone while eating it; but to-day Alice Rose\nchose to bear him company. She watched him with cold severe eye for\nsome time, until he had appeased his languid appetite. Then she\nbegan with the rebuke she had in store for him; a rebuke the motives\nto which were not entirely revealed even to herself.\n\n'Thou 're none so keen after thy food as common,' she began. 'Plain\nvictuals goes ill down after feastin'.'\n\nPhilip felt the colour mount to his face; he was not in the mood for\npatiently standing the brunt of the attack which he saw was coming,\nand yet he had a reverent feeling for woman and for age. He wished\nshe would leave him alone; but he only said--'I had nought but a\nslice o' cold beef for supper, if you'll call that feasting.'\n\n'Neither do godly ways savour delicately after the pleasures of the\nworld,' continued she, unheeding his speech. 'Thou wert wont to seek\nthe house of the Lord, and I thought well on thee; but of late\nthou'st changed, and fallen away, and I mun speak what is in my\nheart towards thee.'\n\n'Mother,' said Philip, impatiently (both he and Coulson called Alice\n'mother' at times), 'I don't think I am fallen away, and any way I\ncannot stay now to be--it's new year's Day, and t' shop is throng.'\n\nBut Alice held up her hand. Her speech was ready, and she must\ndeliver it.\n\n'Shop here, shop there. The flesh and the devil are gettin' hold on\nyo', and yo' need more nor iver to seek t' ways o' grace. New year's\nday comes and says, \"Watch and pray,\" and yo' say, \"Nay, I'll seek\nfeasts and market-places, and let times and seasons come and go\nwithout heedin' into whose presence they're hastening me.\" Time was,\nPhilip, when thou'd niver ha' letten a merry-making keep thee fra'\nt' watch-night, and t' company o' the godly.'\n\n'I tell yo' it was no merry-making to me,' said Philip, with\nsharpness, as he left the house.\n\nAlice sat down on the nearest seat, and leant her head on her\nwrinkled hand.\n\n'He's tangled and snared,' said she; 'my heart has yearned after\nhim, and I esteemed him as one o' the elect. And more nor me yearns\nafter him. O Lord, I have but one child! O Lord, spare her! But o'er\nand above a' I would like to pray for his soul, that Satan might not\nhave it, for he came to me but a little lad.'\n\nAt that moment Philip, smitten by his conscience for his hard manner\nof speech, came back; but Alice did not hear or see him till he was\nclose by her, and then he had to touch her to recall her attention.\n\n'Mother,' said he, 'I was wrong. I'm fretted by many things. I\nshouldn't ha' spoken so. It was ill-done of me.'\n\n'Oh, my lad!' said she, looking up and putting her thin arm on his\nshoulder as he stooped, 'Satan is desiring after yo' that he may\nsift yo' as wheat. Bide at whoam, bide at whoam, and go not after\nthem as care nought for holy things. Why need yo' go to Haytersbank\nthis night?'\n\nPhilip reddened. He could not and would not give it up, and yet it\nwas difficult to resist the pleading of the usually stern old woman.\n\n'Nay,' said he, withdrawing himself ever so little from her hold;\n'my aunt is but ailing, they're my own flesh and blood, and as good\nfolks as needs be, though they mayn't be o' our--o' your way o'\nthinking in a' things.'\n\n'Our ways--your ways o' thinking, says he, as if they were no longer\nhis'n. And as good folks as need be,' repeated she, with returning\nseverity. 'Them's Satan's words, tho' yo' spoke 'em, Philip. I can\ndo nought again Satan, but I can speak to them as can; an' we'll see\nwhich pulls hardest, for it'll be better for thee to be riven and\nrent i' twain than to go body and soul to hell.'\n\n'But don't think, mother,' said Philip, his last words of\nconciliation, for the clock had given warning for two, 'as I'm boun'\nfor hell, just because I go t' see my own folks, all I ha' left o'\nkin.' And once more, after laying his hand with as much of a caress\nas was in his nature on hers, he left the house.\n\nProbably Alice would have considered the first words that greeted\nPhilip on his entrance into the shop as an answer to her prayer, for\nthey were such as put a stop to his plan of going to see Sylvia that\nevening; and if Alice had formed her inchoate thoughts into words,\nSylvia would have appeared as the nearest earthly representative of\nthe spirit of temptation whom she dreaded for Philip.\n\nAs he took his place behind the counter, Coulson said to him in a\nlow voice,--\n\n'Jeremiah Foster has been round to bid us to sup wi' him to-night.\nHe says that he and John have a little matter o' business to talk\nover with us.'\n\nA glance from his eyes to Philip told the latter that Coulson\nbelieved the business spoken of had something to do with the\npartnership, respecting which there had been a silent intelligence\nfor some time between the shopmen.\n\n'And what did thou say?' asked Philip, doggedly unwilling, even yet,\nto give up his purposed visit.\n\n'Say! why, what could a say, but that we'd come? There was summat\nup, for sure; and summat as he thought we should be glad on. I could\ntell it fra' t' look on his face.'\n\n'I don't think as I can go,' said Philip, feeling just then as if\nthe long-hoped-for partnership was as nothing compared to his plan.\nIt was always distasteful to him to have to give up a project, or to\ndisarrange an intended order of things, such was his nature; but\nto-day it was absolute pain to yield his own purpose.\n\n'Why, man alive?' said Coulson, in amaze at his reluctance.\n\n'I didn't say I mightn't go,' said Philip, weighing consequences,\nuntil called off to attend to customers.\n\nIn the course of the afternoon, however, he felt himself more easy\nin deferring his visit to Haytersbank till the next evening. Charley\nKinraid entered the shop, accompanied by Molly Brunton and her\nsisters; and though they all went towards Hester's side of the shop,\nand Philip and Coulson had many people to attend to, yet Hepburn's\nsharpened ears caught much of what the young women were saying. From\nthat he gathered that Kinraid had promised them new year's gifts,\nfor the purchase of which they were come; and after a little more\nlistening he learnt that Kinraid was returning to Shields the next\nday, having only come over to spend a holiday with his relations,\nand being tied with ship's work at the other end. They all talked\ntogether lightly and merrily, as if his going or staying was almost\na matter of indifference to himself and his cousins. The principal\nthought of the young women was to secure the articles they most\nfancied; Charley Kinraid was (so Philip thought) especially anxious\nthat the youngest and prettiest should be pleased. Hepburn watched\nhim perpetually with a kind of envy of his bright, courteous manner,\nthe natural gallantry of the sailor. If it were but clear that\nSylvia took as little thought of him as he did of her, to all\nappearance, Philip could even have given him praise for manly good\nlooks, and a certain kind of geniality of disposition which made him\nready to smile pleasantly at all strangers, from babies upwards.\n\nAs the party turned to leave the shop they saw Philip, the guest of\nthe night before; and they came over to shake hands with him across\nthe counter; Kinraid's hand was proffered among the number. Last\nnight Philip could not have believed it possible that such a\ndemonstration of fellowship should have passed between them; and\nperhaps there was a slight hesitation of manner on his part, for\nsome idea or remembrance crossed Kinraid's mind which brought a keen\nsearching glance into the eyes which for a moment were fastened on\nPhilip's face. In spite of himself, and during the very action of\nhand-shaking, Philip felt a cloud come over his face, not altering\nor moving his features, but taking light and peace out of his\ncountenance.\n\nMolly Brunton began to say something, and he gladly turned to look\nat her. She was asking him why he went away so early, for they had\nkept it up for four hours after he left, and last of all, she added\n(turning to Kinraid), her cousin Charley had danced a hornpipe among\nthe platters on the ground.\n\nPhilip hardly knew what he said in reply, the mention of that pas\nseul lifted such a weight off his heart. He could smile now, after\nhis grave fashion, and would have shaken hands again with Kinraid\nhad it been required; for it seemed to him that no one, caring ever\nso little in the way that he did for Sylvia, could have borne four\nmortal hours of a company where she had been, and was not; least of\nall could have danced a hornpipe, either from gaiety of heart, or\neven out of complaisance. He felt as if the yearning after the\nabsent one would have been a weight to his legs, as well as to his\nspirit; and he imagined that all men were like himself.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV\n\nPARTNERSHIP\n\n\nAs darkness closed in, and the New Year's throng became scarce,\nPhilip's hesitation about accompanying Coulson faded away. He was\nmore comfortable respecting Sylvia, and his going to see her might\nbe deferred; and, after all, he felt that the wishes of his masters\nought to be attended to, and the honour of an invitation to the\nprivate house of Jeremiah not to be slighted for anything short of a\npositive engagement. Besides, the ambitious man of business existed\nstrongly in Philip. It would never do to slight advances towards the\nsecond great earthly object in his life; one also on which the first\ndepended.\n\nSo when the shop was closed, the two set out down Bridge Street to\ncross the river to the house of Jeremiah Foster. They stood a moment\non the bridge to breathe the keen fresh sea air after their busy\nday. The waters came down, swollen full and dark, with rapid rushing\nspeed from the snow-fed springs high up on the moorland above. The\nclose-packed houses in the old town seemed a cluster of white roofs\nirregularly piled against the more unbroken white of the hill-side.\nLights twinkled here and there in the town, and were slung from\nstern and bow of the ships in the harbour. The air was very still,\nsettling in for a frost; so still that all distant sounds seemed\nnear: the rumble of a returning cart in the High Street, the voices\non board ship, the closing of shutters and barring of doors in the\nnew town to which they were bound. But the sharp air was filled, as\nit were, with saline particles in a freezing state; little pungent\ncrystals of sea salt burning lips and cheeks with their cold\nkeenness. It would not do to linger here in the very centre of the\nvalley up which passed the current of atmosphere coming straight\nwith the rushing tide from the icy northern seas. Besides, there was\nthe unusual honour of a supper with Jeremiah Foster awaiting them.\nHe had asked each of them separately to a meal before now; but they\nhad never gone together, and they felt that there was something\nserious in the conjuncture.\n\nThey began to climb the steep heights leading to the freshly-built\nrows of the new town of Monkshaven, feeling as if they were rising\ninto aristocratic regions where no shop profaned the streets.\nJeremiah Foster's house was one of six, undistinguished in size, or\nshape, or colour; but noticed in the daytime by all passers-by for\nits spotless cleanliness of lintel and doorstep, window and window\nframe. The very bricks seemed as though they came in for the daily\nscrubbing which brightened handle, knocker, all down to the very\nscraper.\n\nThe two young men felt as shy of the interview with their master\nunder such unusual relations of guest and host, as a girl does of\nher first party. Each rather drew back from the decided step of\nknocking at the door; but with a rebuffing shake at his own folly,\nPhilip was the one to give a loud single rap. As if they had been\nwaited for, the door flew open, and a middle-aged servant stood\nbehind, as spotless and neat as the house itself; and smiled a\nwelcome to the familiar faces.\n\n'Let me dust yo' a bit, William,' said she, suiting the action to\nthe word. 'You've been leanin' again some whitewash, a'll be bound.\nAy, Philip,' continued she, turning him round with motherly freedom,\n'yo'll do if yo'll but gi' your shoon a polishin' wipe on yon other\nmat. This'n for takin' t' roughest mud off. Measter allays polishes\non that.'\n\nIn the square parlour the same precise order was observed. Every\narticle of furniture was free from speck of dirt or particle of\ndust; and everything was placed either in a parallel line, or at\nexact right-angles with every other. Even John and Jeremiah sat in\nsymmetry on opposite sides of the fire-place; the very smiles on\ntheir honest faces seemed drawn to a line of exactitude.\n\nSuch formality, however admirable, was not calculated to promote\nease: it was not until after supper--until a good quantity of\nYorkshire pie had been swallowed, and washed down, too, with the\nbest and most generous wine in Jeremiah's cellar--that there was the\nleast geniality among them, in spite of the friendly kindness of the\nhost and his brother. The long silence, during which mute thanks for\nthe meal were given, having come to an end, Jeremiah called for\npipes, and three of the party began to smoke.\n\nPolitics in those days were tickle subjects to meddle with, even in\nthe most private company. The nation was in a state of terror\nagainst France, and against any at home who might be supposed to\nsympathise with the enormities she had just been committing. The\noppressive act against seditious meetings had been passed the year\nbefore; and people were doubtful to what extremity of severity it\nmight be construed. Even the law authorities forgot to be impartial,\nbut either their alarms or their interests made too many of them\nvehement partisans instead of calm arbiters, and thus destroyed the\npopular confidence in what should have been considered the supreme\ntribunal of justice. Yet for all this, there were some who dared to\nspeak of reform of Parliament, as a preliminary step to fair\nrepresentation of the people, and to a reduction of the heavy\nwar-taxation that was imminent, if not already imposed. But these\npioneers of 1830 were generally obnoxious. The great body of the\npeople gloried in being Tories and haters of the French, with whom\nthey were on tenter-hooks to fight, almost unaware of the rising\nreputation of the young Corsican warrior, whose name would be used\nere a dozen years had passed to hush English babies with a terror\nsuch as that of Marlborough once had for the French.\n\nAt such a place as Monkshaven all these opinions were held in\nexcess. One or two might, for the mere sake of argument, dispute on\ncertain points of history or government; but they took care to be\nvery sure of their listeners before such arguments touched on\nanything of the present day; for it had been not unfrequently found\nthat the public duty of prosecuting opinions not your own overrode\nthe private duty of respecting confidence. Most of the Monkshaven\npoliticians confined themselves, therefore, to such general\nquestions as these: 'Could an Englishman lick more than four\nFrenchmen at a time?' 'What was the proper punishment for members of\nthe Corresponding Society (correspondence with the French\ndirectory), hanging and quartering, or burning?' 'Would the\nforthcoming child of the Princess of Wales be a boy or a girl? If a\ngirl, would it be more loyal to call it Charlotte or Elizabeth?'\n\nThe Fosters were quite secure enough of their guests this evening to\nhave spoken freely on politics had they been so inclined. And they\ndid begin on the outrages which had been lately offered to the king\nin crossing St James's Park to go and open the House of Lords; but\nsoon, so accustomed were their minds to caution and restraint, the\ntalk dropped down to the high price of provisions. Bread at 1_s_.\n3_d_. the quartern loaf, according to the London test. Wheat at\n120_s_. per quarter, as the home-baking northerners viewed the\nmatter; and then the conversation died away to an ominous silence.\nJohn looked at Jeremiah, as if asking him to begin. Jeremiah was the\nhost, and had been a married man. Jeremiah returned the look with\nthe same meaning in it. John, though a bachelor, was the elder\nbrother. The great church bell, brought from the Monkshaven\nmonastery centuries ago, high up on the opposite hill-side, began to\nring nine o'clock; it was getting late. Jeremiah began:\n\n'It seems a bad time for starting any one on business, wi' prices\nand taxes and bread so dear; but John and I are getting into years,\nand we've no children to follow us: yet we would fain draw out of\nsome of our worldly affairs. We would like to give up the shop, and\nstick to banking, to which there seemeth a plain path. But first\nthere is the stock and goodwill of the shop to be disposed on.'\n\nA dead pause. This opening was not favourable to the hopes of the\ntwo moneyless young men who had been hoping to succeed their masters\nby the more gradual process of partnership. But it was only the kind\nof speech that had been agreed upon by the two brothers with a view\nof impressing on Hepburn and Coulson the great and unusual\nresponsibility of the situation into which the Fosters wished them\nto enter. In some ways the talk of many was much less simple and\nstraightforward in those days than it is now. The study of effect\nshown in the London diners-out of the last generation, who prepared\ntheir conversation beforehand, was not without its parallel in\nhumbler spheres, and for different objects than self-display. The\nbrothers Foster had all but rehearsed the speeches they were about\nto make this evening. They were aware of the youth of the parties to\nwhom they were going to make a most favourable proposal; and they\ndreaded that if that proposal was too lightly made, it would be too\nlightly considered, and the duties involved in it too carelessly\nentered upon. So the _role_ of one brother was to suggest, that of\nthe other to repress. The young men, too, had their reserves. They\nforesaw, and had long foreseen, what was coming that evening. They\nwere impatient to hear it in distinct words; and yet they had to\nwait, as if unconscious, during all the long preamble. Do age and\nyouth never play the same parts now? To return. John Foster replied\nto his brother:\n\n'The stock and goodwill! That would take much wealth. And there will\nbe fixtures to be considered. Philip, canst thee tell me the exact\namount of stock in the shop at present?'\n\nIt had only just been taken; Philip had it at his fingers' ends.\n'One thousand nine hundred and forty-one pounds, thirteen shillings\nand twopence.'\n\nCoulson looked at him in a little dismay, and could not repress a\nsigh. The figures put into words and spoken aloud seemed to indicate\nso much larger an amount of money than when quickly written down in\nnumerals. But Philip read the countenances, nay, by some process of\nwhich he was not himself aware, he read the minds of the brothers,\nand felt no dismay at what he saw there.\n\n'And the fixtures?' asked John Foster.\n\n'The appraiser valued them at four hundred and thirty-five pounds\nthree and sixpence when father died. We have added to them since,\nbut we will reckon them at that. How much does that make with the\nvalue of the stock?'\n\n'Two thousand one hundred and seventy-six pounds, sixteen shillings\nand eightpence,' said Philip.\n\nCoulson had done the sum quicker, but was too much disheartened by\nthe amount to speak.\n\n'And the goodwill?' asked the pitiless John. 'What dost thee set\nthat at?'\n\n'I think, brother, that that would depend on who came forward with\nthe purchase-money of the stock and fixtures. To some folks we might\nmake it sit easy, if they were known to us, and those as we wished\nwell to. If Philip and William here, for instance, said they'd like\nto purchase the business, I reckon thee and me would not ask 'em so\nmuch as we should ask Millers' (Millers was an upstart petty rival\nshop at the end of the bridge in the New Town).\n\n'I wish Philip and William was to come after us,' said John. 'But\nthat's out of the question,' he continued, knowing all the while\nthat, far from being out of the question, it was the very question,\nand that it was as good as settled at this very time.\n\nNo one spoke. Then Jeremiah went on:\n\n'It's out of the question, I reckon?'\n\nHe looked at the two young men. Coulson shook his head. Philip more\nbravely said,--\n\n'I have fifty-three pounds seven and fourpence in yo'r hands, Master\nJohn, and it's all I have i' the world.'\n\n'It's a pity,' said John, and again they were silent. Half-past nine\nstruck. It was time to be beginning to make an end. 'Perhaps,\nbrother, they have friends who could advance 'em the money. We might\nmake it sit light to them, for the sake of their good service?'\n\nPhilip replied,--\n\n'There's no one who can put forwards a penny for me: I have but few\nkin, and they have little to spare beyond what they need.'\n\nCoulson said--\n\n'My father and mother have nine on us.'\n\n'Let alone, let alone!' said John, relenting fast; for he was weary\nof his part of cold, stern prudence. 'Brother, I think we have\nenough of this world's goods to do what we like wi' our own.'\n\nJeremiah was a little scandalized at the rapid melting away of\nassumed character, and took a good pull at his pipe before he\nreplied--\n\n'Upwards of two thousand pounds is a large sum to set on the\nwell-being and well-doing of two lads, the elder of whom is not\nthree-and-twenty. I fear we must look farther a-field.'\n\n'Why, John,' replied Jeremiah, 'it was but yesterday thee saidst\nthee would rather have Philip and William than any men o' fifty that\nthee knowed. And now to bring up their youth again them.'\n\n'Well, well! t' half on it is thine, and thou shall do even as thou\nwilt. But I think as I must have security for my moiety, for it's a\nrisk--a great risk. Have ye any security to offer? any expectations?\nany legacies, as other folk have a life-interest in at present?'\n\nNo; neither of them had. So Jeremiah rejoined--\n\n'Then, I suppose, I mun do as thee dost, John, and take the security\nof character. And it's a great security too, lads, and t' best o'\nall, and one that I couldn't ha' done without; no, not if yo'd pay\nme down five thousand for goodwill, and stock, and fixtures. For\nJohn Foster and Son has been a shop i' Monkshaven this eighty years\nand more; and I dunnot think there's a man living--or dead, for that\nmatter--as can say Fosters wronged him of a penny, or gave short\nmeasure to a child or a Cousin Betty.'\n\nThey all four shook hands round with the same heartiness as if it\nhad been a legal ceremony necessary to the completion of the\npartnership. The old men's faces were bright with smiles; the eyes\nof the young ones sparkled with hope.\n\n'But, after all,' said Jeremiah, 'we've not told you particulars.\nYo're thanking us for a pig in a poke; but we had more forethought,\nand we put all down on a piece o' paper.'\n\nHe took down a folded piece of paper from the mantel-shelf, put on\nhis horn spectacles, and began to read aloud, occasionally peering\nover his glasses to note the effect on the countenances of the young\nmen. The only thing he was in the habit of reading aloud was a\nchapter in the Bible daily to his housekeeper servant; and, like\nmany, he reserved a peculiar tone for that solemn occupation--a tone\nwhich he unconsciously employed for the present enumeration of\npounds, shillings, and pence.\n\n'Average returns of the last three years, one hundred and\ntwenty-seven pounds, three shillings, and seven penny and one-sixth\na week. Profits thereupon thirty-four per cent.--as near as may be.\nClear profits of the concern, after deducting all expenses except\nrent--for t' house is our own--one thousand two hundred and two\npound a year.'\n\nThis was far more than either Hepburn or Coulson had imagined it to\nbe; and a look of surprise, almost amounting to dismay, crept over\ntheir faces, in spite of their endeavour to keep simply motionless\nand attentive.\n\n'It's a deal of money, lads, and the Lord give you grace to guide\nit,' said Jeremiah, putting down his paper for a minute.\n\n'Amen,' said John, shaking his head to give effect to his word.\n\n'Now what we propose is this,' continued Jeremiah, beginning afresh\nto refer to his paper: 'We will call t' value of stock and fixtures\ntwo thousand one hundred and fifty. You may have John Holden,\nappraiser and auctioneer, in to set a price on them if yo' will; or\nyo' may look over books and bills; or, better still, do both, and so\ncheck one again t'other; but for t' sake o' making the ground o' the\nbargain, I state the sum as above; and I reckon it so much capital\nleft in yo'r hands for the use o' which yo're bound to pay us five\nper cent. quarterly--that's one hundred and seven pound ten per\nannum at least for t' first year; and after it will be reduced by\nthe gradual payment on our money, which must be at the rate of\ntwenty per cent., thus paying us our principal back in five years.\nAnd the rent, including all back yards, right of wharfage,\nwarehouse, and premises, is reckoned by us to be sixty-five pound\nper annum. So yo' will have to pay us, John and Jeremiah Foster,\nbrothers, six hundred and twelve pound ten out of the profits of the\nfirst year, leaving, at the present rate of profits, about five\nhundred and eighty-nine pound ten, for the share to be divided\nbetween yo'.'\n\nThe plan had, in all its details, been carefully arranged by the two\nbrothers. They were afraid lest Hepburn and Coulson should be\ndazzled by the amount of profits, and had so arranged the\nsliding-scale of payment as to reduce the first year's income to\nwhat the elder men thought a very moderate sum, but what to the\nyounger ones appeared an amount of wealth such as they, who had\nneither of them ever owned much more than fifty pounds, considered\nalmost inexhaustible. It was certainly a remarkable instance of\nprosperity and desert meeting together so early in life.\n\nFor a moment or two the brothers were disappointed at not hearing\nany reply from either of them. Then Philip stood up, for he felt as\nif anything he could say sitting down would not be sufficiently\nexpressive of gratitude, and William instantly followed his example.\nHepburn began in a formal manner, something the way in which he had\nread in the York newspapers that honourable members returned thanks\nwhen their health was given.\n\n'I can hardly express my feelings' (Coulson nudged him) 'his\nfeelings, too--of gratitude. Oh, Master John! Master Jeremiah, I\nthought it might come i' time; nay, I've thought it might come afore\nlong; but I niver thought as it would be so much, or made so easy.\nWe've got good kind friends--we have, have we not, William?--and\nwe'll do our best, and I hope as we shall come up to their wishes.'\n\nPhilip's voice quivered a little, as some remembrance passed across\nhis mind; at this unusual moment of expansion out it came. 'I wish\nmother could ha' seen this day.'\n\n'She shall see a better day, my lad, when thy name and William's is\npainted over t' shop-door, and J. and J. Foster blacked out.'\n\n'Nay, master,' said William, 'that mun never be. I'd a'most sooner\nnot come in for the business. Anyhow, it must be 'late J. and J.\nFoster,' and I'm not sure as I can stomach that.'\n\n'Well, well, William,' said John Foster, highly gratified, 'there be\ntime enough to talk over that. There was one thing more to be said,\nwas there not, brother Jeremiah? We do not wish to have this talked\nover in Monkshaven until shortly before the time when yo' must enter\non the business. We have our own arrangements to make wi' regard to\nthe banking concern, and there'll be lawyer's work to do, after\nyo've examined books and looked over stock again together; may-be\nwe've overstated it, or t' fixtures aren't worth so much as we said.\nAnyhow yo' must each on yo' give us yo'r word for to keep fra'\nnaming this night's conversation to any one. Meantime, Jeremiah and\nI will have to pay accounts, and take a kind of farewell of the\nmerchants and manufacturers with whom Fosters have had dealings this\nseventy or eighty year; and when and where it seems fitting to us we\nwill take one of yo' to introduce as our successors and friends. But\nall that's to come. But yo' must each give us yo'r word not to name\nwhat has passed here to any one till further speech on the subject\nhas passed between us.'\n\nCoulson immediately gave the promise. Philip's assent came lagging.\nHe had thought of Sylvia living, almost as much as of the dead\nmother, whose last words had been a committal of her child to the\nFather of the friendless; and now that a short delay was placed\nbetween the sight of the cup and his enjoyment of it, there was an\nimpatient chafing in the mind of the composed and self-restrained\nPhilip; and then repentance quick as lightning effaced the feeling,\nand he pledged himself to the secrecy which was enjoined. Some few\nmore details as to their mode of procedure--of verifying the\nFosters' statements, which to the younger men seemed a perfectly\nunnecessary piece of business--of probable journeys and\nintroductions, and then farewell was bidden, and Hepburn and Coulson\nwere in the passage donning their wraps, and rather to their\nindignation being assisted therein by Martha, who was accustomed to\nthe office with her own master. Suddenly they were recalled into the\nparlour.\n\nJohn Foster was fumbling with the papers a little nervously:\nJeremiah spoke--\n\n'We have not thought it necessary to commend Hester Rose to you; if\nshe had been a lad she would have had a third o' the business along\nwi' yo'. Being a woman, it's ill troubling her with a partnership;\nbetter give her a fixed salary till such time as she marries.'\n\nHe looked a little knowingly and curiously at the faces of the young\nmen he addressed. William Coulson seemed sheepish and uncomfortable,\nbut said nothing, leaving it as usual to Philip to be spokesman.\n\n'If we hadn't cared for Hester for hersel', master, we should ha'\ncared for her as being forespoken by yo'. Yo' and Master John shall\nfix what we ought t' pay her; and I think I may make bold to say\nthat, as our income rises, hers shall too--eh, Coulson?' (a sound of\nassent quite distinct enough); 'for we both look on her as a sister\nand on Alice like a mother, as I told her only this very day.'\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV\n\nA DIFFICULT QUESTION\n\n\nPhilip went to bed with that kind of humble penitent gratitude in\nhis heart, which we sometimes feel after a sudden revulsion of\nfeeling from despondency to hope. The night before it seemed as if\nall events were so arranged as to thwart him in his dearest wishes;\nhe felt now as if his discontent and repining, not twenty-four hours\nbefore, had been almost impious, so great was the change in his\ncircumstances for the better. Now all seemed promising for the\nfulfilment of what he most desired. He was almost convinced that he\nwas mistaken in thinking that Kinraid had had anything more than a\nsailor's admiration for a pretty girl with regard to Sylvia; at any\nrate, he was going away to-morrow, in all probability not to return\nfor another year (for Greenland ships left for the northern seas as\nsoon as there was a chance of the ice being broken up), and ere then\nhe himself might speak out openly, laying before her parents all his\nfortunate prospects, and before her all his deep passionate love.\n\nSo this night his prayers were more than the mere form that they had\nbeen the night before; they were a vehement expression of gratitude\nto God for having, as it were, interfered on his behalf, to grant\nhim the desire of his eyes and the lust of his heart. He was like\ntoo many of us, he did not place his future life in the hands of\nGod, and only ask for grace to do His will in whatever circumstances\nmight arise; but he yearned in that terrible way after a blessing\nwhich, when granted under such circumstances, too often turns out to\nbe equivalent to a curse. And that spirit brings with it the\nmaterial and earthly idea that all events that favour our wishes are\nanswers to our prayer; and so they are in one sense, but they need\nprayer in a deeper and higher spirit to keep us from the temptation\nto evil which such events invariably bring with them.\n\nPhilip little knew how Sylvia's time had been passed that day. If he\nhad, he would have laid down this night with even a heavier heart\nthan he had done on the last.\n\nCharley Kinraid accompanied his cousins as far as the spot where the\npath to Haytersbank Farm diverged. Then he stopped his merry talk,\nand announced his intention of going to see farmer Robson. Bessy\nCorney looked disappointed and a little sulky; but her sister Molly\nBrunton laughed, and said,--\n\n'Tell truth, lad! Dannel Robson 'd niver have a call fra' thee if he\nhadn't a pretty daughter.'\n\n'Indeed, but he would,' replied Charley, rather annoyed; 'when I've\nsaid a thing, I do it. I promised last night to go see him; besides,\nI like the old man.'\n\n'Well! when shall we tell mother yo're comin' whoam?'\n\n'Toward eight o'clock--may-be sooner.'\n\n'Why it's bare five now! bless t' lad, does he think o' staying\ntheere a' neet, and they up so late last night, and Mrs. Robson\nailing beside? Mother 'll not think it kind on yo' either, will she,\nBess?'\n\n'I dunno. Charley mun do as he likes; I daresay no one'll miss him\nif he does bide away till eight.'\n\n'Well, well! I can't tell what I shall do; but yo'd best not stop\nlingering here, for it's getting on, and there'll be a keen frost by\nt' look o' the stars.'\n\nHaytersbank was closed for the night as far as it ever was closed;\nthere were no shutters to the windows, nor did they care to draw the\ninside curtains, so few were the passers-by. The house door was\nfastened; but the shippen door a little on in the same long low\nblock of building stood open, and a dim light made an oblong upon\nthe snowy ground outside. As Kinraid drew near he heard talking\nthere, and a woman's voice; he threw a passing glance through the\nwindow into the fire-lit house-place, and seeing Mrs. Robson asleep\nby the fireside in her easy-chair, he went on.\n\nThere was the intermittent sound of the sharp whistling of milk into\nthe pail, and Kester, sitting on a three-legged stool, cajoling a\ncapricious cow into letting her fragrant burden flow. Sylvia stood\nnear the farther window-ledge, on which a horn lantern was placed,\npretending to knit at a gray worsted stocking, but in reality\nlaughing at Kester's futile endeavours, and finding quite enough to\ndo with her eyes, in keeping herself untouched by the whisking tail,\nor the occasional kick. The frosty air was mellowed by the warm and\nodorous breath of the cattle--breath that hung about the place in\nfaint misty clouds. There was only a dim light; such as it was, it\nwas not dearly defined against the dark heavy shadow in which the\nold black rafters and manger and partitions were enveloped.\n\nAs Charley came to the door, Kester was saying, 'Quiet wi' thee,\nwench! Theere now, she's a beauty, if she'll stand still. There's\nniver sich a cow i' t' Riding; if she'll only behave hersel'. She's\na bonny lass, she is; let down her milk, theere's a pretty!'\n\n'Why, Kester,' laughed Sylvia, 'thou'rt asking her for her milk wi'\nas many pretty speeches as if thou wert wooing a wife!'\n\n'Hey, lass!' said Kester, turning a bit towards her, and shutting\none eye to cock the other the better upon her; an operation which\npuckered up his already wrinkled face into a thousand new lines and\nfolds. 'An' how does thee know how a man woos a wife, that thee\ntalks so knowin' about it? That's tellin'. Some un's been tryin' it\non thee.'\n\n'There's niver a one been so impudent,' said Sylvia, reddening and\ntossing her head a little; 'I'd like to see 'em try me!'\n\n'Well, well!' said Kester, wilfully misunderstanding her meaning,\n'thou mun be patient, wench; and if thou's a good lass, may-be thy\nturn 'll come and they 'll try it.'\n\n'I wish thou'd talk of what thou's some knowledge on, Kester,\ni'stead of i' that silly way,' replied Sylvia.\n\n'Then a mun talk no more 'bout women, for they're past knowin', an'\ndruv e'en King Solomon silly.'\n\nAt this moment Charley stepped in. Sylvia gave a little start and\ndropped her ball of worsted. Kester made as though absorbed in his\ntask of cajoling Black Nell; but his eyes and ears were both\nvigilant.\n\n'I was going into the house, but I saw yo'r mother asleep, and I\ndidn't like to waken her, so I just came on here. Is yo'r father to\nthe fore?'\n\n'No,' said Sylvia, hanging down her head a little, wondering if he\ncould have heard the way in which she and Kester had been talking,\nand thinking over her little foolish jokes with anger against\nherself. 'Father is gone to Winthrop about some pigs as he's heerd\non. He'll not be back till seven o'clock or so.'\n\nIt was but half-past five, and Sylvia in the irritation of the\nmoment believed that she wished Kinraid would go. But she would have\nbeen extremely disappointed if he had. Kinraid himself seemed to\nhave no thought of the kind. He saw with his quick eyes, not\nunaccustomed to women, that his coming so unexpectedly had fluttered\nSylvia, and anxious to make her quite at her ease with him, and not\nunwilling to conciliate Kester, he addressed his next speech to him,\nwith the same kind of air of interest in the old man's pursuit that\na young man of a different class sometimes puts on when talking to\nthe chaperone of a pretty girl in a ball-room.\n\n'That's a handsome beast yo've just been milking, master.'\n\n'Ay; but handsome is as handsome does. It were only yesterday as she\naimed her leg right at t' pail wi' t' afterings in. She knowed it\nwere afterings as well as any Christian, and t' more t' mischief t'\nbetter she likes it; an' if a hadn't been too quick for her, it\nwould have a' gone swash down i' t' litter. This'n 's a far better\ncow i' t' long run, she's just a steady goer,' as the milky\ndown-pour came musical and even from the stall next to Black Nell's.\n\nSylvia was knitting away vigorously, thinking all the while that it\nwas a great pity she had not put on a better gown, or even a cap\nwith brighter ribbon, and quite unconscious how very pretty she\nlooked standing against the faint light, her head a little bent\ndown; her hair catching bright golden touches, as it fell from under\nher little linen cap; her pink bed-gown, confined by her\napron-string, giving a sort of easy grace to her figure; her dark\nfull linsey petticoat short above her trim ancles, looking far more\nsuitable to the place where she was standing than her long gown of\nthe night before would have done. Kinraid was wanting to talk to\nher, and to make her talk, but was uncertain how to begin. In the\nmeantime Kester went on with the subject last spoken about.\n\n'Black Nell's at her fourth calf now, so she ought to ha' left off\nher tricks and turned sober-like. But bless yo', there's some cows\nas 'll be skittish till they're fat for t' butcher. Not but what a\nlike milking her better nor a steady goer; a man has allays summat\nto be watchin' for; and a'm kind o' set up when a've mastered her at\nlast. T' young missus theere, she's mighty fond o' comin' t' see\nBlack Nell at her tantrums. She'd niver come near me if a' cows were\nlike this'n.'\n\n'Do you often come and see the cows milked?' asked Kinraid,\n\n'Many a time,' said Sylvia, smiling a little. 'Why, when we're\nthrong, I help Kester; but now we've only Black Nell and Daisy\ngiving milk. Kester knows as I can milk Black Nell quite easy,' she\ncontinued, half vexed that Kester had not named this accomplishment.\n\n'Ay! when she's in a good frame o' mind, as she is sometimes. But t'\ndifficulty is to milk her at all times.'\n\n'I wish I'd come a bit sooner. I should like t' have seen you milk\nBlack Nell,' addressing Sylvia.\n\n'Yo'd better come to-morrow e'en, and see what a hand she'll mak' on\nher,' said Kester.\n\n'To-morrow night I shall be far on my road back to Shields.'\n\n'To-morrow!' said Sylvia, suddenly looking up at him, and then\ndropping her eyes, as she found he had been watching for the effect\nof his intelligence on her.\n\n'I mun be back at t' whaler, where I'm engaged,' continued he.\n'She's fitting up after a fresh fashion, and as I've been one as\nwanted new ways, I mun be on the spot for t' look after her. Maybe I\nshall take a run down here afore sailing in March. I'm sure I shall\ntry.'\n\nThere was a good deal meant and understood by these last few words.\nThe tone in which they were spoken gave them a tender intensity not\nlost upon either of the hearers. Kester cocked his eye once more,\nbut with as little obtrusiveness as he could, and pondered the\nsailor's looks and ways. He remembered his coming about the place\nthe winter before, and how the old master had then appeared to have\ntaken to him; but at that time Sylvia had seemed to Kester too\nlittle removed from a child to have either art or part in Kinraid's\nvisits; now, however, the case was different. Kester in his\nsphere--among his circle of acquaintance, narrow though it was--had\nheard with much pride of Sylvia's bearing away the bell at church\nand at market, wherever girls of her age were congregated. He was a\nnorth countryman, so he gave out no further sign of his feelings\nthan his mistress and Sylvia's mother had done on a like occasion.\n\n'T' lass is weel enough,' said he; but he grinned to himself, and\nlooked about, and listened to the hearsay of every lad, wondering\nwho was handsome, and brave, and good enough to be Sylvia's mate.\nNow, of late, it had seemed to the canny farm-servant pretty clear\nthat Philip Hepburn was 'after her'; and to Philip, Kester had an\ninstinctive objection, a kind of natural antipathy such as has\nexisted in all ages between the dwellers in a town and those in the\ncountry, between agriculture and trade. So, while Kinraid and Sylvia\nkept up their half-tender, half-jesting conversation, Kester was\nmaking up his slow persistent mind as to the desirability of the\nyoung man then present as a husband for his darling, as much from\nhis being other than Philip in every respect, as from the individual\ngood qualities he possessed. Kester's first opportunity of favouring\nKinraid's suit consisted in being as long as possible over his\nmilking; so never were cows that required such 'stripping,' or were\nexpected to yield such 'afterings', as Black Nell and Daisy that\nnight. But all things must come to an end; and at length Kester got\nup from his three-legged stool, on seeing what the others did\nnot--that the dip-candle in the lantern was coming to an end--and\nthat in two or three minutes more the shippen would be in darkness,\nand so his pails of milk be endangered. In an instant Sylvia had\nstarted out of her delicious dreamland, her drooping eyes were\nraised, and recovered their power of observation; her ruddy arms\nwere freed from the apron in which she had enfolded them, as a\nprotection from the gathering cold, and she had seized and adjusted\nthe wooden yoke across her shoulders, ready to bear the brimming\nmilk-pails to the dairy.\n\n'Look yo' at her!' exclaimed Kester to Charley, as he adjusted the\nfragrant pails on the yoke. 'She thinks she's missus a ready, and\nshe's allays for carrying in t' milk since t' rhumatiz cotched my\nshouther i' t' back end; and when she says \"Yea,\" it's as much as my\nheed's worth to say \"Nay.\"'\n\nAnd along the wall, round the corner, down the round slippery stones\nof the rambling farmyard, behind the buildings, did Sylvia trip,\nsafe and well-poised, though the ground wore all one coating of\nwhite snow, and in many places was so slippery as to oblige Kinraid\nto linger near Kester, the lantern-bearer. Kester did not lose his\nopportunity, though the cold misty night air provoked his asthmatic\ncough when-ever he breathed, and often interrupted his words.\n\n'She's a good wench--a good wench as iver was--an come on a good\nstock, an' that's summat, whether in a cow or a woman. A've known\nher from a baby; she's a reet down good un.'\n\nBy this time they had reached the back-kitchen door, just as Sylvia\nhad unladen herself, and was striking a light with flint and tinder.\nThe house seemed warm and inviting after the piercing outer air,\nalthough the kitchen into which they entered contained only a raked\nand slumbering fire at one end, over which, on a crook, hung the\nimmense pan of potatoes cooking for the evening meal of the pigs. To\nthis pan Kester immediately addressed himself, swinging it round\nwith ease, owing to the admirable simplicity of the old-fashioned\nmachinery. Kinraid stood between Kester and the door into the dairy,\nthrough which Sylvia had vanished with the milk. He half wished to\nconciliate Kester by helping him, but he seemed also attracted, by a\nforce which annihilated his will, to follow her wherever she went.\nKester read his mind.\n\n'Let alone, let alone,' said he; 'pigs' vittle takes noan such\ndainty carryin' as milk. A may set it down an' niver spill a drop;\nshe's noan fit for t' serve swine, nor yo' other, mester; better\nhelp her t' teem t' milk.'\n\nSo Kinraid followed the light--his light--into the icy chill of the\ndairy, where the bright polished tin cans were quickly dimmed with\nthe warm, sweet-smelling milk, that Sylvia was emptying out into the\nbrown pans. In his haste to help her, Charley took up one of the\npails.\n\n'Eh? that'n 's to be strained. Yo' have a' the cow's hair in.\nMother's very particular, and cannot abide a hair.'\n\nSo she went over to her awkward dairymaid, and before she--but not\nbefore he--was aware of the sweet proximity, she was adjusting his\nhappy awkward arms to the new office of holding a milk-strainer over\nthe bowl, and pouring the white liquid through it.\n\n'There!' said she, looking up for a moment, and half blushing; 'now\nyo'll know how to do it next time.'\n\n'I wish next time was to come now,' said Kinraid; but she had\nreturned to her own pail, and seemed not to hear him. He followed\nher to her side of the dairy. 'I've but a short memory, can yo' not\nshow me again how t' hold t' strainer?'\n\n'No,' said she, half laughing, but holding her strainer fast in\nspite of his insinuating efforts to unlock her fingers. 'But there's\nno need to tell me yo've getten a short memory.'\n\n'Why? what have I done? how dun you know it?'\n\n'Last night,' she began, and then she stopped, and turned away her\nhead, pretending to be busy in her dairy duties of rinsing and such\nlike.\n\n'Well!' said he, half conjecturing her meaning, and flattered by it,\nif his conjecture were right. 'Last night--what?'\n\n'Oh, yo' know!' said she, as if impatient at being both literally\nand metaphorically followed about, and driven into a corner.\n\n'No; tell me,' persisted he.\n\n'Well,' said she, 'if yo' will have it, I think yo' showed yo'd but\na short memory when yo' didn't know me again, and yo' were five\ntimes at this house last winter, and that's not so long sin'. But I\nsuppose yo' see a vast o' things on yo'r voyages by land or by sea,\nand then it's but natural yo' should forget.' She wished she could\ngo on talking, but could not think of anything more to say just\nthen; for, in the middle of her sentence, the flattering\ninterpretation he might put upon her words, on her knowing so\nexactly the number of times he had been to Haytersbank, flashed upon\nher, and she wanted to lead the conversation a little farther\nafield--to make it a little less personal. This was not his wish,\nhowever. In a tone which thrilled through her, even in her own\ndespite, he said,--\n\n'Do yo' think that can ever happen again, Sylvia?'\n\nShe was quite silent; almost trembling. He repeated the question as\nif to force her to answer. Driven to bay, she equivocated.\n\n'What happen again? Let me go, I dunno what yo're talking about, and\nI'm a'most numbed wi' cold.'\n\nFor the frosty air came sharp in through the open lattice window,\nand the ice was already forming on the milk. Kinraid would have\nfound a ready way of keeping his cousins, or indeed most young\nwomen, warm; but he paused before he dared put his arm round Sylvia;\nshe had something so shy and wild in her look and manner; and her\nvery innocence of what her words, spoken by another girl, might lead\nto, inspired him with respect, and kept him in check. So he\ncontented himself with saying,--\n\n'I'll let yo' go into t' warm kitchen if yo'll tell me if yo' think\nI can ever forget yo' again.'\n\nShe looked up at him defiantly, and set her red lips firm. He\nenjoyed her determination not to reply to this question; it showed\nshe felt its significance. Her pure eyes looked steadily into his;\nnor was the expression in his such as to daunt her or make her\nafraid. They were like two children defying each other; each\ndetermined to conquer. At last she unclosed her lips, and nodding\nher head as if in triumph, said, as she folded her arms once more in\nher check apron,--\n\n'Yo'll have to go home sometime.'\n\n'Not for a couple of hours yet,' said he; 'and yo'll be frozen\nfirst; so yo'd better say if I can ever forget yo' again, without\nmore ado.'\n\nPerhaps the fresh voices breaking on the silence,--perhaps the tones\nwere less modulated than they had been before, but anyhow Bell\nRobson's voice was heard calling Sylvia through the second door,\nwhich opened from the dairy to the house-place, in which her mother\nhad been till this moment asleep. Sylvia darted off in obedience to\nthe call; glad to leave him, as at the moment Kinraid resentfully\nimagined. Through the open door he heard the conversation between\nmother and daughter, almost unconscious of its meaning, so difficult\ndid he find it to wrench his thoughts from the ideas he had just\nbeen forming with Sylvia's bright lovely face right under his eyes.\n\n'Sylvia!' said her mother, 'who's yonder?' Bell was sitting up in\nthe attitude of one startled out of slumber into intensity of\nlistening; her hands on each of the chair-arms, as if just going to\nrise. 'There's a fremd man i' t' house. I heerd his voice!'\n\n'It's only--it's just Charley Kinraid; he was a-talking to me i' t'\ndairy.'\n\n'I' t' dairy, lass! and how com'd he i' t' dairy?'\n\n'He com'd to see feyther. Feyther asked him last night,' said\nSylvia, conscious that he could overhear every word that was said,\nand a little suspecting that he was no great favourite with her\nmother.\n\n'Thy feyther's out; how com'd he i' t' dairy?' persevered Bell.\n\n'He com'd past this window, and saw yo' asleep, and didn't like for\nt' waken yo'; so he com'd on to t' shippen, and when I carried t'\nmilk in---'\n\nBut now Kinraid came in, feeling the awkwardness of his situation a\nlittle, yet with an expression so pleasant and manly in his open\nface, and in his exculpatory manner, that Sylvia lost his first\nwords in a strange kind of pride of possession in him, about which\nshe did not reason nor care to define the grounds. But her mother\nrose from her chair somewhat formally, as if she did not intend to\nsit down again while he stayed, yet was too weak to be kept in that\nstanding attitude long.\n\n'I'm afeared, sir, Sylvie hasn't told yo' that my master's out, and\nnot like to be in till late. He'll be main and sorry to have missed\nyo'.'\n\nThere was nothing for it after this but to go. His only comfort was\nthat on Sylvia's rosy face he could read unmistakable signs of\nregret and dismay. His sailor's life, in bringing him suddenly face\nto face with unexpected events, had given him something of that\nself-possession which we consider the attribute of a gentleman; and\nwith an apparent calmness which almost disappointed Sylvia, who\nconstrued it into a symptom of indifference as to whether he went or\nstayed, he bade her mother good-night, and only said, in holding her\nhand a minute longer than was absolutely necessary,--\n\n'I'm coming back ere I sail; and then, may-be, you'll answer yon\nquestion.'\n\nHe spoke low, and her mother was rearranging herself in her chair,\nelse Sylvia would have had to repeat the previous words. As it was,\nwith soft thrilling ideas ringing through her, she could get her\nwheel, and sit down to her spinning by the fire; waiting for her\nmother to speak first, Sylvia dreamt her dreams.\n\nBell Robson was partly aware of the state of things, as far as it\nlay on the surface. She was not aware how deep down certain feelings\nhad penetrated into the girl's heart who sat on the other side of\nthe fire, with a little sad air diffused over her face and figure.\nBell looked upon Sylvia as still a child, to be warned off forbidden\nthings by threats of danger. But the forbidden thing was already\ntasted, and possible danger in its full acquisition only served to\nmake it more precious-sweet.\n\nBell sat upright in her chair, gazing into the fire. Her milk-white\nlinen mob-cap fringed round and softened her face, from which the\nusual apple-red was banished by illness, and the features, from the\nsame cause, rendered more prominent and stern. She had a clean buff\nkerchief round her neck, and stuffed into the bosom of her Sunday\nwoollen gown of dark blue,--if she had been in working-trim she\nwould have worn a bedgown like Sylvia's. Her sleeves were pinned\nback at the elbows, and her brown arms and hard-working hands lay\ncrossed in unwonted idleness on her check apron. Her knitting was by\nher side; and if she had been going through any accustomed\ncalculation or consideration she would have had it busily clinking\nin her fingers. But she had something quite beyond common to think\nabout, and, perhaps, to speak about; and for the minute she was not\nequal to knitting.\n\n'Sylvie,' she began at length, 'did I e'er tell thee on Nancy\nHartley as I knew when I were a child? I'm thinking a deal on her\nto-night; may-be it's because I've been dreaming on yon old times.\nShe was a bonny lass as ever were seen, I've heerd folk say; but\nthat were afore I knew her. When I knew her she were crazy, poor\nwench; wi' her black hair a-streaming down her back, and her eyes,\nas were a'most as black, allays crying out for pity, though never a\nword she spoke but \"He once was here.\" Just that o'er and o'er\nagain, whether she were cold or hot, full or hungry, \"He once was\nhere,\" were all her speech. She had been farm-servant to my mother's\nbrother--James Hepburn, thy great-uncle as was; she were a poor,\nfriendless wench, a parish 'prentice, but honest and gaum-like, till\na lad, as nobody knowed, come o'er the hills one sheep-shearing fra'\nWhitehaven; he had summat to do wi' th' sea, though not rightly to\nbe called a sailor: and he made a deal on Nancy Hartley, just to\nbeguile the time like; and he went away and ne'er sent a thought\nafter her more. It's the way as lads have; and there's no holding\n'em when they're fellows as nobody knows--neither where they come\nfro', nor what they've been doing a' their lives, till they come\nathwart some poor wench like Nancy Hartley. She were but a softy\nafter all: for she left off doing her work in a proper manner. I've\nheerd my aunt say as she found out as summat was wrong wi' Nancy as\nsoon as th' milk turned bingy, for there ne'er had been such a clean\nlass about her milk-cans afore that; and from bad it grew to worse,\nand she would sit and do nothing but play wi' her fingers fro' morn\ntill night, and if they asked her what ailed her, she just said, \"He\nonce was here;\" and if they bid her go about her work, it were a'\nthe same. And when they scolded her, and pretty sharp too, she would\nstand up and put her hair from her eyes, and look about her like a\ncrazy thing searching for her wits, and ne'er finding them, for all\nshe could think on was just, \"He once was here.\" It were a caution\nto me again thinking a man t' mean what he says when he's a-talking\nto a young woman.'\n\n'But what became on poor Nancy?' asked Sylvia.\n\n'What should become on her or on any lass as gives hersel' up to\nthinking on a man who cares nought for her?' replied her mother, a\nlittle severely. 'She were crazed, and my aunt couldn't keep her\non, could she? She did keep her a long weary time, thinking as she\nwould, may-be, come to hersel', and, anyhow, she were a motherless\nwench. But at length she had for t' go where she came fro'--back to\nKeswick workhouse: and when last I heerd on her she were chained to\nth' great kitchen dresser i' t' workhouse; they'd beaten her till\nshe were taught to be silent and quiet i' th' daytime, but at night,\nwhen she were left alone, she would take up th' oud cry, till it\nwrung their heart, so they'd many a time to come down and beat her\nagain to get any peace. It were a caution to me, as I said afore, to\nkeep fro' thinking on men as thought nought on me.'\n\n'Poor crazy Nancy!' sighed Sylvia. The mother wondered if she had\ntaken the 'caution' to herself, or was only full of pity for the mad\ngirl, dead long before.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI\n\nTHE ENGAGEMENT\n\n\n'As the day lengthens so the cold strengthens.' It was so that year;\nthe hard frost which began on new year's eve lasted on and on into\nlate February, black and bitter, but welcome enough to the farmers,\nas it kept back the too early growth of autumn-sown wheat, and gave\nthem the opportunity of leading manure. But it did not suit invalids\nas well, and Bell Robson, though not getting worse, did not make any\nprogress towards amendment. Sylvia was kept very busy,\nnotwithstanding that she had the assistance of a poor widow-woman in\nthe neighbourhood on cleaning, or washing, or churning days. Her\nlife was quiet and monotonous, although hard-working; and while her\nhands mechanically found and did their accustomed labour, the\nthoughts that rose in her head always centred on Charley Kinraid,\nhis ways, his words, his looks, whether they all meant what she\nwould fain believe they did, and whether, meaning love at the time,\nsuch a feeling was likely to endure. Her mother's story of crazy\nNancy had taken hold of her; but not as a 'caution,' rather as a\nparallel case to her own. Like Nancy, and borrowing the poor girl's\nown words, she would say softly to herself, 'He once was here'; but\nall along she believed in her heart he would come back again to her,\nthough it touched her strangely to imagine the agonies of forsaken\nlove.\n\nPhilip knew little of all this. He was very busy with facts and\nfigures, doggedly fighting through the necessary business, and only\nnow and then allowing himself the delicious relaxation of going to\nHaytersbank in an evening, to inquire after his aunt's health, and\nto see Sylvia; for the two Fosters were punctiliously anxious to\nmake their shopmen test all their statements; insisting on an\nexamination of the stock, as if Hepburn and Coulson were strangers\nto the shop; having the Monkshaven auctioneer in to appraise the\nfixtures and necessary furniture; going over the shop books for the\nlast twenty years with their successors, an employment which took up\nevening after evening; and not unfrequently taking one of the young\nmen on the long commercial journeys which were tediously made in a\ngig. By degrees both Hepburn and Coulson were introduced to distant\nmanufacturers and wholesale dealers. They would have been willing to\ntake the Fosters' word for every statement the brothers had made on\nnew year's day; but this, it was evident, would not have satisfied\ntheir masters, who were scrupulous in insisting that whatever\nadvantage there was should always fall on the side of the younger\nmen.\n\nWhen Philip saw Sylvia she was always quiet and gentle; perhaps more\nsilent than she had been a year ago, and she did not attend so\nbriskly to what was passing around her. She was rather thinner and\npaler; but whatever change there was in her was always an\nimprovement in Philip's eyes, so long as she spoke graciously to\nhim. He thought she was suffering from long-continued anxiety about\nher mother, or that she had too much to do; and either cause was\nenough to make him treat her with a grave regard and deference which\nhad a repressed tenderness in it, of which she, otherwise occupied,\nwas quite unaware. She liked him better, too, than she had done a\nyear or two before, because he did not show her any of the eager\nattention which teased her then, although its meaning was not fully\nunderstood.\n\nThings were much in this state when the frost broke, and milder\nweather succeeded. This was the time so long looked forward to by\nthe invalid and her friends, as favouring the doctor's\nrecommendation of change of air. Her husband was to take her to\nspend a fortnight with a kindly neighbour, who lived near the farm\nthey had occupied, forty miles or so inland, before they came to\nHaytersbank. The widow-woman was to come and stay in the house, to\nkeep Sylvia company, during her mother's absence. Daniel, indeed,\nwas to return home after conveying his wife to her destination; but\nthere was so much to be done on the land at this time of the year,\nthat Sylvia would have been alone all day had it not been for the\narrangement just mentioned.\n\nThere was active stirring in Monkshaven harbour as well as on shore.\nThe whalers were finishing their fittings-out for the Greenland\nseas. It was a 'close' season, that is to say, there would be\ndifficulty in passing the barrier of ice which lay between the ships\nand the whaling-grounds; and yet these must be reached before June,\nor the year's expedition would be of little avail. Every\nblacksmith's shop rung with the rhythmical clang of busy hammers,\nbeating out old iron, such as horseshoes, nails or stubs, into the\ngreat harpoons; the quays were thronged with busy and important\nsailors, rushing hither and thither, conscious of the demand in\nwhich they were held at this season of the year. It was war time,\ntoo. Many captains unable to procure men in Monkshaven would have to\ncomplete their crews in the Shetlands. The shops in the town were\nequally busy; stores had to be purchased by the whaling-masters,\nwarm clothing of all sorts to be provided. These were the larger\nwholesale orders; but many a man, and woman, too, brought out their\nsmall hoards to purchase extra comforts, or precious keepsakes for\nsome beloved one. It was the time of the great half-yearly traffic\nof the place; another impetus was given to business when the whalers\nreturned in the autumn, and the men were flush of money, and full of\ndelight at once more seeing their homes and their friends.\n\nThere was much to be done in Fosters' shop, and later hours were\nkept than usual. Some perplexity or other was occupying John and\nJeremiah Foster; their minds were not so much on the alert as usual,\nbeing engaged on some weighty matter of which they had as yet spoken\nto no one. But it thus happened that they did not give the prompt\nassistance they were accustomed to render at such times; and Coulson\nhad been away on some of the new expeditions devolving on him and\nPhilip as future partners. One evening after the shop was closed,\nwhile they were examining the goods, and comparing the sales with\nthe entries in the day-book, Coulson suddenly inquired--\n\n'By the way, Hester, does thee know where the parcel of best\nbandanas is gone? There was four left, as I'm pretty sure, when I\nset off to Sandsend; and to-day Mark Alderson came in, and would\nfain have had one, and I could find none nowhere.'\n\n'I sold t' last to-day, to yon sailor, the specksioneer, who fought\nthe press-gang same time as poor Darley were killed. He took it, and\nthree yards of yon pink ribbon wi' t' black and yellow crosses on\nit, as Philip could never abide. Philip has got 'em i' t' book, if\nhe'll only look.'\n\n'Is he here again?' said Philip; 'I didn't see him. What brings him\nhere, where he's noan wanted?'\n\n'T' shop were throng wi' folk,' said Hester, 'and he knew his own\nmind about the handkercher, and didn't tarry long. Just as he was\nleaving, his eye caught on t' ribbon, and he came back for it. It\nwere when yo' were serving Mary Darby and there was a vast o' folk\nabout yo'.'\n\n'I wish I'd seen him,' said Coulson. 'I'd ha' gi'en him a word and a\nlook he'd not ha' forgotten in a hurry.'\n\n'Why, what's up?' said Philip, surprised at William's unusual\nmanner, and, at the same time, rather gratified to find a reflection\nof his own feelings about Kinraid. Coulson's face was pale with\nanger, but for a moment or two he seemed uncertain whether he would\nreply or not.\n\n'Up!' said he at length. 'It's just this: he came after my sister\nfor better nor two year; and a better lass--no, nor a prettier i' my\neyes--niver broke bread. And then my master saw another girl, that\nhe liked better'--William almost choked in his endeavour to keep\ndown all appearance of violent anger, and then went on, 'and that\nhe played t' same game wi', as I've heerd tell.'\n\n'And how did thy sister take it?' asked Philip, eagerly.\n\n'She died in a six-month,' said William; '_she_ forgived him, but\nit's beyond me. I thought it were him when I heerd of t' work about\nDarley; Kinraid--and coming fra' Newcassel, where Annie lived\n'prentice--and I made inquiry, and it were t' same man. But I'll\nsay no more about him, for it stirs t' old Adam more nor I like, or\nis fitting.'\n\nOut of respect to him, Philip asked no more questions although there\nwere many things that he fain would have known. Both Coulson and he\nwent silently and grimly through the remainder of their day's work.\nIndependent of any personal interest which either or both of them\nhad or might have in Kinraid's being a light o' love, this fault of\nhis was one with which the two grave, sedate young men had no\nsympathy. Their hearts were true and constant, whatever else might\nbe their failings; and it is no new thing to 'damn the faults we\nhave no mind to.' Philip wished that it was not so late, or that\nvery evening he would have gone to keep guard over Sylvia in her\nmother's absence--nay, perhaps he might have seen reason to give her\na warning of some kind. But, if he had done so, it would have been\nlocking the stable-door after the steed was stolen. Kinraid had\nturned his steps towards Haytersbank Farm as soon as ever he had\ncompleted his purchases. He had only come that afternoon to\nMonkshaven, and for the sole purpose of seeing Sylvia once more\nbefore he went to fulfil his engagement as specksioneer in the\n_Urania_, a whaling-vessel that was to sail from North Shields on\nThursday morning, and this was Monday.\n\nSylvia sat in the house-place, her back to the long low window, in\norder to have all the light the afternoon hour afforded for her\nwork. A basket of her father's unmended stockings was on the little\nround table beside her, and one was on her left hand, which she\nsupposed herself to be mending; but from time to time she made long\npauses, and looked in the fire; and yet there was but little motion\nof flame or light in it out of which to conjure visions. It was\n'redd up' for the afternoon; covered with a black mass of coal, over\nwhich the equally black kettle hung on the crook. In the\nback-kitchen Dolly Reid, Sylvia's assistant during her mother's\nabsence, chanted a lugubrious ditty, befitting her condition as a\nwidow, while she cleaned tins, and cans, and milking-pails. Perhaps\nthese bustling sounds prevented Sylvia from hearing approaching\nfootsteps coming down the brow with swift advance; at any rate, she\nstarted and suddenly stood up as some one entered the open door. It\nwas strange she should be so much startled, for the person who\nentered had been in her thoughts all during those long pauses.\nCharley Kinraid and the story of crazy Nancy had been the subjects\nfor her dreams for many a day, and many a night. Now he stood there,\nbright and handsome as ever, with just that much timidity in his\nface, that anxiety as to his welcome, which gave his accost an added\ncharm, could she but have perceived it. But she was so afraid of\nherself, so unwilling to show what she felt, and how much she had\nbeen thinking of him in his absence, that her reception seemed cold\nand still. She did not come forward to meet him; she went crimson to\nthe very roots of her hair; but that, in the waning light, he could\nnot see; and she shook so that she felt as if she could hardly\nstand; but the tremor was not visible to him. She wondered if he\nremembered the kiss that had passed between them on new year's\neve--the words that had been spoken in the dairy on new year's day;\nthe tones, the looks, that had accompanied those words. But all she\nsaid was--\n\n'I didn't think to see yo'. I thought yo'd ha' sailed.'\n\n'I told yo' I should come back, didn't I?' said he, still standing,\nwith his hat in his hand, waiting to be asked to sit down; and she,\nin her bashfulness, forgetting to give the invitation, but, instead,\npretending to be attentively mending the stocking she held. Neither\ncould keep quiet and silent long. She felt his eyes were upon her,\nwatching every motion, and grew more and more confused in her\nexpression and behaviour. He was a little taken aback by the nature\nof his reception, and was not sure at first whether to take the\ngreat change in her manner, from what it had been when last he saw\nher, as a favourable symptom or otherwise. By-and-by, luckily for\nhim, in some turn of her arm to reach the scissors on the table, she\ncaught the edge of her work-basket, and down it fell. She stooped to\npick up the scattered stockings and ball of worsted, and so did he;\nand when they rose up, he had fast hold of her hand, and her face\nwas turned away, half ready to cry.\n\n'What ails yo' at me?' said he, beseechingly. 'Yo' might ha'\nforgotten me; and yet I thought we made a bargain against forgetting\neach other.' No answer. He went on: 'Yo've never been out o' my\nthoughts, Sylvia Robson; and I'm come back to Monkshaven for nought\nbut to see you once and again afore I go away to the northern seas.\nIt's not two hour sin' I landed at Monkshaven, and I've been near\nneither kith nor kin as yet; and now I'm here you won't speak to\nme.'\n\n'I don't know what to say,' said she, in a low, almost inaudible\ntone. Then hardening herself, and resolving to speak as if she did\nnot understand his only half-expressed meaning, she lifted up her\nhead, and all but looking at him--while she wrenched her hand out of\nhis--she said: 'Mother's gone to Middleham for a visit, and\nfeyther's out i' t' plough-field wi' Kester; but he'll be in afore\nlong.'\n\nCharley did not speak for a minute or so. Then he said--\n\n'Yo're not so dull as to think I'm come all this way for t' see\neither your father or your mother. I've a great respect for 'em\nboth; but I'd hardly ha' come all this way for to see 'em, and me\nbound to be back i' Shields, if I walk every step of the way, by\nWednesday night. It's that yo' won't understand my meaning, Sylvia;\nit's not that yo' don't, or that yo' can't.' He made no effort to\nrepossess himself of her hand. She was quite silent, but in spite of\nherself she drew long hard breaths. 'I may go back to where I came\nfrom,' he went on. 'I thought to go to sea wi' a blessed hope to\ncheer me up, and a knowledge o' some one as loved me as I'd left\nbehind; some one as loved me half as much as I did her; for th'\nmeasure o' my love toward her is so great and mighty, I'd be content\nwi' half as much from her, till I'd taught her to love me more. But\nif she's a cold heart and cannot care for a honest sailor, why,\nthen, I'd best go back at once.'\n\nHe made for the door. He must have been pretty sure from some sign\nor other, or he would never have left it to her womanly pride to\ngive way, and for her to make the next advance. He had not taken two\nsteps when she turned quickly towards him, and said something--the\necho of which, rather than the words themselves, reached him.\n\n'I didn't know yo' cared for me; yo' niver said so.' In an instant\nhe was back at her side, his arm round her in spite of her short\nstruggle, and his eager passionate voice saying, 'Yo' never knowed I\nloved you, Sylvia? say it again, and look i' my face while yo' say\nit, if yo' can. Why, last winter I thought yo'd be such a woman when\nyo'd come to be one as my een had never looked upon, and this year,\never sin' I saw yo' i' the kitchen corner sitting crouching behind\nmy uncle, I as good as swore I'd have yo' for wife, or never wed at\nall. And it was not long ere yo' knowed it, for all yo' were so coy,\nand now yo' have the face--no, yo' have not the face--come, my\ndarling, what is it?' for she was crying; and on his turning her wet\nblushing face towards him the better to look at it, she suddenly hid\nit in his breast. He lulled and soothed her in his arms, as if she\nhad been a weeping child and he her mother; and then they sat down\non the settle together, and when she was more composed they began to\ntalk. He asked her about her mother; not sorry in his heart at Bell\nRobson's absence. He had intended if necessary to acknowledge his\nwishes and desires with regard to Sylvia to her parents; but for\nvarious reasons he was not sorry that circumstances had given him\nthe chance of seeing her alone, and obtaining her promise to marry\nhim without being obliged to tell either her father or her mother at\npresent. 'I ha' spent my money pretty free,' he said, 'and I've\nne'er a penny to the fore, and yo'r parents may look for something\nbetter for yo', my pretty: but when I come back fro' this voyage I\nshall stand a chance of having a share i' th' _Urania_, and may-be I\nshall be mate as well as specksioneer; and I can get a matter of\nfrom seventy to ninety pound a voyage, let alone th' half-guineas\nfor every whale I strike, and six shilling a gallon on th' oil; and\nif I keep steady wi' Forbes and Company, they'll make me master i'\ntime, for I've had good schooling, and can work a ship as well as\nany man; an' I leave yo' wi' yo'r parents, or take a cottage for yo'\nnigh at hand; but I would like to have something to the fore, and\nthat I shall have, please God, when we come back i' th' autumn. I\nshall go to sea happy, now, thinking I've yo'r word. Yo're not one\nto go back from it, I'm sure, else it's a long time to leave such a\npretty girl as yo', and ne'er a chance of a letter reaching yo' just\nto tell yo' once again how I love yo', and to bid yo' not forget\nyo'r true love.'\n\n'There'll be no need o' that,' murmured Sylvia.\n\nShe was too dizzy with happiness to have attended much to his\ndetails of his worldly prospects, but at the sound of his tender\nwords of love her eager heart was ready to listen.\n\n'I don't know,' said he, wanting to draw her out into more\nconfession of her feelings. 'There's many a one ready to come after\nyo'; and yo'r mother is not o'er captivated wi' me; and there's yon\ntall fellow of a cousin as looks black at me, for if I'm not\nmista'en he's a notion of being sweet on yo' hisself.'\n\n'Not he,' said Sylvia, with some contempt in her tone. 'He's so full\no' business and t' shop, and o' makin' money, and gettin' wealth.'\n\n'Ay, ay; but perhaps when he gets a rich man he'll come and ask my\nSylvia to be his wife, and what will she say then?'\n\n'He'll niver come asking such a foolish question,' said she, a\nlittle impatiently; 'he knows what answer he'd get if he did.'\n\nKinraid said, almost as if to himself, 'Yo'r mother favours him\nthough.' But she, weary of a subject she cared nothing about, and\neager to identify herself with all his interests, asked him about\nhis plans almost at the same time that he said these last words; and\nthey went on as lovers do, intermixing a great many tender\nexpressions with a very little conversation relating to facts.\n\nDolly Reid came in, and went out softly, unheeded by them. But\nSylvia's listening ears caught her father's voice, as he and Kester\nreturned homewards from their day's work in the plough-field; and\nshe started away, and fled upstairs in shy affright, leaving Charley\nto explain his presence in the solitary kitchen to her father.\n\nHe came in, not seeing that any one was there at first; for they had\nnever thought of lighting a candle. Kinraid stepped forward into the\nfirelight; his purpose of concealing what he had said to Sylvia\nquite melted away by the cordial welcome her father gave him the\ninstant that he recognized him.\n\n'Bless thee, lad! who'd ha' thought o' seein' thee? Why, if iver a\nthought on thee at all, it were half way to Davis' Straits. To be\nsure, t' winter's been a dree season, and thou'rt, may-be, i' t'\nreet on 't to mak' a late start. Latest start as iver I made was\nninth o' March, an' we struck thirteen whales that year.'\n\n'I have something to say to you,' said Charley, in a hesitating\nvoice, so different to his usual hearty way, that Daniel gave him a\nkeen look of attention before he began to speak. And, perhaps, the\nelder man was not unprepared for the communication that followed. At\nany rate, it was not unwelcome. He liked Kinraid, and had strong\nsympathy not merely with what he knew of the young sailor's\ncharacter, but with the life he led, and the business he followed.\nRobson listened to all he said with approving nods and winks, till\nCharley had told him everything he had to say; and then he turned\nand struck his broad horny palm into Kinraid's as if concluding a\nbargain, while he expressed in words his hearty consent to their\nengagement. He wound up with a chuckle, as the thought struck him\nthat this great piece of business, of disposing of their only child,\nhad been concluded while his wife was away.\n\n'A'm noan so sure as t' missus 'll like it,' said he; 'tho'\nwhativer she'll ha' to say again it, mischief only knows. But she's\nnoan keen on matterimony; though a have made her as good a man as\nthere is in a' t' Ridings. Anyhow, a'm master, and that she knows.\nBut may-be, for t' sake o' peace an' quietness--tho' she's niver a\nscolding tongue, that a will say for her--we'n best keep this matter\nto ourselves till thou comes int' port again. T' lass upstairs 'll\nlike nought better than t' curl hersel' round a secret, and purr\no'er it, just as t' oud cat does o'er her blind kitten. But thou'll\nbe wanting to see t' lass, a'll be bound. An oud man like me isn't\nas good company as a pretty lass.' Laughing a low rich laugh over\nhis own wit, Daniel went to the bottom of the stairs, and called,\n'Sylvie, Sylvie! come down, lass! a's reet; come down!'\n\nFor a time there was no answer. Then a door was unbolted, and Sylvia\nsaid,\n\n'I can't come down again. I'm noan comin' down again to-night.'\n\nDaniel laughed the more at this, especially when he caught Charley's\nlook of disappointment.\n\n'Hearken how she's bolted her door. She'll noane come near us this\nnight. Eh! but she's a stiff little 'un; she's been our only one, and\nwe'n mostly let her have her own way. But we'll have a pipe and a\nglass; and that, to my thinking, is as good company as iver a woman\nin Yorkshire.'\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII\n\nREJECTED WARNINGS\n\n\nThe post arrived at Monkshaven three times in the week; sometimes,\nindeed, there were not a dozen letters in the bag, which was brought\nthither by a man in a light mail-cart, who took the better part of a\nday to drive from York; dropping private bags here and there on the\nmoors, at some squire's lodge or roadside inn. Of the number of\nletters that arrived in Monkshaven, the Fosters, shopkeepers and\nbankers, had the largest share.\n\nThe morning succeeding the day on which Sylvia had engaged herself\nto Kinraid, the Fosters seemed unusually anxious to obtain their\nletters. Several times Jeremiah came out of the parlour in which his\nbrother John was sitting in expectant silence, and, passing through\nthe shop, looked up and down the market-place in search of the old\nlame woman, who was charitably employed to deliver letters, and who\nmust have been lamer than ever this morning, to judge from the\nlateness of her coming. Although none but the Fosters knew the cause\nof their impatience for their letters, yet there was such tacit\nsympathy between them and those whom they employed, that Hepburn,\nCoulson, and Hester were all much relieved when the old woman at\nlength appeared with her basket of letters.\n\nOne of these seemed of especial consequence to the good brothers.\nThey each separately looked at the direction, and then at one\nanother; and without a word they returned with it unread into the\nparlour, shutting the door, and drawing the green silk curtain\nclose, the better to read it in privacy.\n\nBoth Coulson and Philip felt that something unusual was going on,\nand were, perhaps, as full of consideration as to the possible\ncontents of this London letter, as of attention to their more\nimmediate business. But fortunately there was little doing in the\nshop. Philip, indeed, was quite idle when John Foster opened the\nparlour-door, and, half doubtfully, called him into the room. As the\ndoor of communication shut the three in, Coulson felt himself a\nlittle aggrieved. A minute ago Philip and he were on a level of\nignorance, from which the former was evidently going to be raised.\nBut he soon returned to his usual state of acquiescence in things as\nthey were, which was partly constitutional, and partly the result of\nhis Quaker training.\n\nIt was apparently by John Foster's wish that Philip had been\nsummoned. Jeremiah, the less energetic and decided brother, was\nstill discussing the propriety of the step when Philip entered.\n\n'No need for haste, John; better not call the young man till we have\nfurther considered the matter.'\n\nBut the young man was there in presence; and John's will carried the\nday.\n\nIt seemed from his account to Philip (explanatory of what he, in\nadvance of his brother's slower judgment, thought to be a necessary\nstep), that the Fosters had for some time received anonymous\nletters, warning them, with distinct meaning, though in ambiguous\nterms, against a certain silk-manufacturer in Spitalfields, with\nwhom they had had straightforward business dealings for many years;\nbut to whom they had latterly advanced money. The letters hinted at\nthe utter insolvency of this manufacturer. They had urged their\ncorrespondent to give them his name in confidence, and this\nmorning's letter had brought it; but the name was totally unknown to\nthem, though there seemed no reason to doubt the reality of either\nit or the address, the latter of which was given in full. Certain\ncircumstances were mentioned regarding the transactions between the\nFosters and this manufacturer, which could be known only to those\nwho were in the confidence of one or the other; and to the Fosters\nthe man was, as has been said, a perfect stranger. Probably, they\nwould have been unwilling to incur the risk they had done on this\nmanufacturer Dickinson's account, if it had not been that he\nbelonged to the same denomination as themselves, and was publicly\ndistinguished for his excellent and philanthropic character; but\nthese letters were provocative of anxiety, especially since this\nmorning's post had brought out the writer's full name, and various\nparticulars showing his intimate knowledge of Dickinson's affairs.\n\nAfter much perplexed consultation, John had hit upon the plan of\nsending Hepburn to London to make secret inquiries respecting the\ntrue character and commercial position of the man whose creditors,\nnot a month ago, they had esteemed it an honour to be.\n\nEven now Jeremiah was ashamed of their want of confidence in one so\ngood; he believed that the information they had received would all\nprove a mistake, founded on erroneous grounds, if not a pure\ninvention of an enemy; and he had only been brought partially to\nconsent to the sending of Hepburn, by his brother's pledging himself\nthat the real nature of Philip's errand should be unknown to any\nhuman creature, save them three.\n\nAs all this was being revealed to Philip, he sat apparently unmoved\nand simply attentive. In fact, he was giving all his mind to\nunderstanding the probabilities of the case, leaving his own\nfeelings in the background till his intellect should have done its\nwork. He said little; but what he did say was to the point, and\nsatisfied both brothers. John perceived that his messenger would\nexercise penetration and act with energy; while Jeremiah was soothed\nby Philip's caution in not hastily admitting the probability of any\ncharge against Dickinson, and in giving full weight to his previous\ngood conduct and good character.\n\nPhilip had the satisfaction of feeling himself employed on a mission\nwhich would call out his powers, and yet not exceed them. In his own\nmind he forestalled the instructions of his masters, and was\nsilently in advance of John Foster's plans and arrangements, while\nhe appeared to listen to all that was said with quiet business-like\nattention.\n\nIt was settled that the next morning he was to make his way\nnorthwards to Hartlepool, whence he could easily proceed either by\nland or sea to Newcastle, from which place smacks were constantly\nsailing to London. As to his personal conduct and behaviour there,\nthe brothers overwhelmed him with directions and advice; nor did\nthey fail to draw out of the strong box in the thick wall of their\ncounting-house a more than sufficient sum of money for all possible\nexpenses. Philip had never had so much in his hands before, and\nhesitated to take it, saying it was more than he should require; but\nthey repeated, with fresh urgency, their warnings about the terrible\nhigh prices of London, till he could only resolve to keep a strict\naccount, and bring back all that he did not expend, since nothing\nbut his taking the whole sum would satisfy his employers.\n\nWhen he was once more behind the counter, he had leisure enough for\nconsideration as far as Coulson could give it him. The latter was\nsilent, brooding over the confidence which Philip had apparently\nreceived, but which was withheld from him. He did not yet know of\nthe culminating point--of Philip's proposed journey to London; that\ngreat city of London, which, from its very inaccessibility fifty\nyears ago, loomed so magnificent through the mist of men's\nimaginations. It is not to be denied that Philip felt exultant at\nthe mere fact of 'going to London.' But then again, the thought of\nleaving Sylvia; of going out of possible daily reach of her; of not\nseeing her for a week--a fortnight; nay, he might be away for a\nmonth,--for no rash hurry was to mar his delicate negotiation,--gnawed\nat his heart, and spoilt any enjoyment he might have anticipated\nfrom gratified curiosity, or even from the consciousness of\nbeing trusted by those whose trust and regard he valued. The\nsense of what he was leaving grew upon him the longer he thought on\nthe subject; he almost wished that he had told his masters earlier\nin the conversation of his unwillingness to leave Monkshaven for so\nlong a time; and then again he felt that the gratitude he owed them\nquite prohibited his declining any task they might impose,\nespecially as they had more than once said that it would not do for\nthem to appear in the affair, and yet that to no one else could they\nentrust so difficult and delicate a matter. Several times that day,\nas he perceived Coulson's jealous sullenness, he thought in his\nheart that the consequence of the excessive confidence for which\nCoulson envied him was a burden from which he would be thankful to\nbe relieved.\n\nAs they all sat at tea in Alice Rose's house-place, Philip announced\nhis intended journey; a piece of intelligence he had not\ncommunicated earlier to Coulson because he had rather dreaded the\nincrease of dissatisfaction it was sure to produce, and of which he\nknew the expression would be restrained by the presence of Alice\nRose and her daughter.\n\n'To Lunnon!' exclaimed Alice.\n\nHester said nothing.\n\n'Well! some folks has the luck!' said Coulson.\n\n'Luck!' said Alice, turning sharp round on him. 'Niver let me hear\nsuch a vain word out o' thy mouth, laddie, again. It's the Lord's\ndoing, and luck's the devil's way o' putting it. Maybe it's to try\nPhilip he's sent there; happen it may be a fiery furnace to him; for\nI've heerd tell it's full o' temptations, and he may fall into\nsin--and then where'd be the \"luck\" on it? But why art ta going? and\nthe morning, say'st thou? Why, thy best shirt is in t' suds, and no\ntime for t' starch and iron it. Whatten the great haste as should\ntake thee to Lunnon wi'out thy ruffled shirt?'\n\n'It's none o' my doing,' said Philip; 'there's business to be done,\nand John Foster says I'm to do it; and I'm to start to-morrow.'\n\n'I'll not turn thee out wi'out thy ruffled shirt, if I sit up a'\nneet,' said Alice, resolutely.\n\n'Niver fret thyself, mother, about t' shirt,' said Philip. 'If I\nneed a shirt, London's not what I take it for if I can't buy mysel'\none ready-made.'\n\n'Hearken to him!' said Alice. 'He speaks as if buying o' ready-made\nshirts were nought to him, and he wi' a good half-dozen as I made\nmysel'. Eh, lad? but if that's the frame o' mind thou'rt in, Lunnon\nis like for to be a sore place o' temptation. There's pitfalls for\nmen, and traps for money at ivery turn, as I've heerd say. It would\nha' been better if John Foster had sent an older man on his\nbusiness, whativer it be.'\n\n'They seem to make a deal o' Philip all on a sudden,' said Coulson.\n'He's sent for, and talked to i' privacy, while Hester and me is\nleft i' t' shop for t' bear t' brunt o' t' serving.'\n\n'Philip knows,' said Hester, and then, somehow, her voice failed her\nand she stopped.\n\nPhilip paid no attention to this half-uttered sentence; he was eager\nto tell Coulson, as far as he could do so without betraying his\nmaster's secret, how many drawbacks there were to his proposed\njourney, in the responsibility which it involved, and his\nunwillingness to leave Monkshaven: he said--\n\n'Coulson, I'd give a deal it were thou that were going, and not me.\nAt least, there is many a time I'd give a deal. I'll not deny but at\nother times I'm pleased at the thought on't. But, if I could I'd\nchange places wi' thee at this moment.'\n\n'It's fine talking,' said Coulson, half mollified, and yet not\ncaring to show it. 'I make no doubt it were an even chance betwixt\nus two at first, which on us was to go; but somehow thou got the\nstart and thou'st stuck to it till it's too late for aught but to\nsay thou's sorry.'\n\n'Nay, William,' said Philip, rising, 'it's an ill look-out for the\nfuture, if thee and me is to quarrel, like two silly wenches, o'er\neach bit of pleasure, or what thou fancies to be pleasure, as falls\nin t' way of either on us. I've said truth to thee, and played thee\nfair, and I've got to go to Haytersbank for to wish 'em good-by, so\nI'll not stay longer here to be misdoubted by thee.'\n\nHe took his cap and was gone, not heeding Alice's shrill inquiry as\nto his clothes and his ruffled shirt. Coulson sat still, penitent\nand ashamed; at length he stole a look at Hester. She was playing\nwith her teaspoon, but he could see that she was choking down her\ntears; he could not choose but force her to speak with an ill-timed\nquestion.\n\n'What's to do, Hester?' said he.\n\nShe lifted up those eyes, usually so soft and serene; now they were\nfull of the light of indignation shining through tears.\n\n'To do!' she said; 'Coulson, I'd thought better of thee, going and\ndoubting and envying Philip, as niver did thee an ill turn, or said\nan ill word, or thought an ill thought by thee; and sending him away\nout o' t' house this last night of all, may-be, wi' thy envyings and\njealousy.'\n\nShe hastily got up and left the room. Alice was away, looking up\nPhilip's things for his journey. Coulson remained alone, feeling\nlike a guilty child, but dismayed by Hester's words, even more than\nby his own regret at what he had said.\n\nPhilip walked rapidly up the hill-road towards Haytersbank. He was\nchafed and excited by Coulson's words, and the events of the day. He\nhad meant to shape his life, and now it was, as it were, being\nshaped for him, and yet he was reproached for the course it was\ntaking, as much as though he were an active agent; accused of taking\nadvantage over Coulson, his intimate companion for years; he who\nesteemed himself above taking an unfair advantage over any man! His\nfeeling on the subject was akin to that of Hazael, 'Is thy servant a\ndog that he should do this thing?'\n\nHis feelings, disturbed on this one point, shook his judgment off\nits balance on another. The resolution he had deliberately formed of\nnot speaking to Sylvia on the subject of his love till he could\nannounce to her parents the fact of his succession to Fosters'\nbusiness, and till he had patiently, with long-continuing and deep\naffection, worked his way into her regard, was set aside during the\npresent walk. He would speak to her of his passionate attachment,\nbefore he left, for an uncertain length of time, and the certain\ndistance of London. And all the modification on this point which his\njudgment could obtain from his impetuous and excited heart was, that\nhe would watch her words and manner well when he announced his\napproaching absence, and if in them he read the slightest token of\ntender regretful feeling, he would pour out his love at her feet,\nnot even urging the young girl to make any return, or to express the\nfeelings of which he hoped the germ was already budding in her. He\nwould be patient with her; he could not be patient himself. His\nheart beating, his busy mind rehearsing the probable coming scene,\nhe turned into the field-path that led to Haytersbank. Coming along\nit, and so meeting him, advanced Daniel Robson, in earnest talk with\nCharley Kinraid. Kinraid, then, had been at the farm: Kinraid had\nbeen seeing Sylvia, her mother away. The thought of poor dead Annie\nCoulson flashed into Philip's mind. Could he be playing the same\ngame with Sylvia? Philip set his teeth and tightened his lips at the\nthought of it. They had stopped talking; they had seen him already,\nor his impulse would have been to dodge behind the wall and avoid\nthem; even though one of his purposes in going to Haytersbank had\nbeen to bid his uncle farewell.\n\nKinraid took him by surprise from the hearty greeting he gave him,\nand which Philip would fain have avoided. But the specksioneer was\nfull of kindliness towards all the world, especially towards all\nSylvia's friends, and, convinced of her great love towards himself,\nhad forgotten any previous jealousy of Philip. Secure and exultant,\nhis broad, handsome, weather-bronzed face was as great a contrast to\nPhilip's long, thoughtful, sallow countenance, as his frank manner\nwas to the other's cold reserve. It was some minutes before Hepburn\ncould bring himself to tell the great event that was about to befall\nhim before this third person whom he considered as an intrusive\nstranger. But as Kinraid seemed to have no idea of going on, and as\nthere really was no reason why he and all the world should not know\nof Philip's intentions, he told his uncle that he was bound for\nLondon the next day on business connected with the Fosters.\n\nDaniel was deeply struck with the fact that he was talking to a man\nsetting off for London at a day's notice.\n\n'Thou'll niver tell me this hasn't been brewin' longer nor twelve\nhours; thou's a sly close chap, and we hannot seen thee this\nse'nnight; thou'll ha' been thinkin' on this, and cogitating it,\nmay-be, a' that time.'\n\n'Nay,' said Philip, 'I knew nought about it last night; it's none o'\nmy doing, going, for I'd liefer ha' stayed where I am.'\n\n'Yo'll like it when once yo're there,' said Kinraid, with a\ntravelled air of superiority, as Philip fancied.\n\n'No, I shan't,' he replied, shortly. 'Liking has nought to do with\nit.'\n\n'Ah' yo' knew nought about it last neet,' continued Daniel,\nmusingly. 'Well, life's soon o'er; else when I were a young fellow,\nfolks made their wills afore goin' to Lunnon.'\n\n'Yet I'll be bound to say yo' niver made a will before going to\nsea,' said Philip, half smiling.\n\n'Na, na; but that's quite another mak' o' thing; going' to sea comes\nnatteral to a man, but goin' to Lunnon,--I were once there, and were\nnear deafened wi' t' throng and t' sound. I were but two hours i' t'\nplace, though our ship lay a fortneet off Gravesend.'\n\nKinraid now seemed in a hurry; but Philip was stung with curiosity\nto ascertain his movements, and suddenly addressed him:\n\n'I heard yo' were i' these parts. Are you for staying here long?'\n\nThere was a certain abruptness in Philip's tone, if not in his\nwords, which made Kinraid look in his face with surprise, and answer\nwith equal curtness.\n\n'I'm off i' th' morning; and sail for the north seas day after.'\n\nHe turned away, and began to whistle, as if he did not wish for any\nfurther conversation with his interrogator. Philip, indeed, had\nnothing more to say to him: he had learned all he wanted to know.\n\n'I'd like to bid good-by to Sylvie. Is she at home?' he asked of her\nfather.\n\n'A'm thinking thou'll not find her. She'll be off to Yesterbarrow t'\nsee if she'd get a settin' o' their eggs; her grey speckled hen is\ncluckin', and nought 'll serve our Sylvia but their eggs to set her\nupon. But, for a' that, she mayn't be gone yet. Best go on and see\nfor thysel'.'\n\nSo they parted; but Philip had not gone many steps before his uncle\ncalled him back, Kinraid slowly loitering on meanwhile. Robson was\nfumbling among some dirty papers he had in an old leather case,\nwhich he had produced out of his pocket.\n\n'Fact is, Philip, t' pleugh's in a bad way, gearin' and a', an' folk\nis talkin' on a new kind o' mak'; and if thou's bound for York---'\n\n'I'm not going by York; I'm going by a Newcastle smack.'\n\n'Newcassel--Newcassel--it's pretty much t' same. Here, lad, thou can\nread print easy; it's a bit as was cut out on a papper; there's\nNewcassel, and York, and Durham, and a vast more towns named, wheere\nfolk can learn a' about t' new mak' o' pleugh.'\n\n'I see,' said Philip: '\"Robinson, Side, Newcastle, can give all\nrequisite information.\"'\n\n'Ay, ay,' said Robson; 'thou's hit t' marrow on t' matter. Now, if\nthou'rt i' Newcassel, thou can learn all about it; thou'rt little\nbetter nor a woman, for sure, bein' mainly acquaint wi' ribbons, but\nthey'll tell thee--they'll tell thee, lad; and write down what they\nsayn, and what's to be t' price, and look sharp as to what kind o'\nfolk they are as sells 'em, an' write and let me know. Thou'll be i'\nNewcassel to-morrow, may-be? Well, then, I'll reckon to hear fro'\nthee in a week, or, mayhap, less,--for t' land is backward, and I'd\nlike to know about t' pleughs. I'd a month's mind to write to\nBrunton, as married Molly Corney, but writin' is more i' thy way an'\nt' parson's nor mine; and if thou sells ribbons, Brunton sells\ncheese, and that's no better.'\n\nPhilip promised to do his best, and to write word to Robson, who,\nsatisfied with his willingness to undertake the commission, bade him\ngo on and see if he could not find the lass. Her father was right in\nsaying that she might not have set out for Yesterbarrow. She had\ntalked about it to Kinraid and her father in order to cover her\nregret at her lover's accompanying her father to see some new kind\nof harpoon about which the latter had spoken. But as soon as they\nhad left the house, and she had covertly watched them up the brow in\nthe field, she sate down to meditate and dream about her great\nhappiness in being beloved by her hero, Charley Kinraid. No gloomy\ndread of his long summer's absence; no fear of the cold, glittering\nicebergs bearing mercilessly down on the _Urania_, nor shuddering\nanticipation of the dark waves of evil import, crossed her mind. He\nloved her, and that was enough. Her eyes looked, trance-like, into a\ndim, glorious future of life; her lips, still warm and reddened by\nhis kiss, were just parted in a happy smile, when she was startled\nby the sound of an approaching footstep--a footstep quite familiar\nenough for her to recognize it, and which was unwelcome now, as\ndisturbing her in the one blessed subject of thought in which alone\nshe cared to indulge.\n\n'Well, Philip! an' what brings _yo'_ here?' was her rather\nungracious greeting.\n\n'Why, Sylvie, are yo' sorry to see me?' asked Philip, reproachfully.\nBut she turned it off with assumed lightness.\n\n'Oh, yes,' said she. 'I've been wanting yo' this week past wi' t'\nmatch to my blue ribbon yo' said yo'd get and bring me next time yo'\ncame.'\n\n'I've forgotten it, Sylvie. It's clean gone out of my mind,' said\nPhilip, with true regret. 'But I've had a deal to think on,' he\ncontinued, penitently, as if anxious to be forgiven. Sylvia did not\nwant his penitence, did not care for her ribbon, was troubled by his\nearnestness of manner--but he knew nothing of all that; he only knew\nthat she whom he loved had asked him to do something for her, and he\nhad neglected it; so, anxious to be excused and forgiven, he went on\nwith the apology she cared not to hear.\n\nIf she had been less occupied with her own affairs, less engrossed\nwith deep feeling, she would have reproached him, if only in jest,\nfor his carelessness. As it was, she scarcely took in the sense of\nhis words.\n\n'You see, Sylvie, I've had a deal to think on; before long I intend\ntelling yo' all about it; just now I'm not free to do it. And when a\nman's mind is full o' business, most particular when it's other\nfolk's as is trusted to him, he seems to lose count on the very\nthings he'd most care for at another time.' He paused a little.\n\nSylvia's galloping thoughts were pulled suddenly up by his silence;\nshe felt that he wanted her to say something, but she could think of\nnothing besides an ambiguous--\n\n'Well?'\n\n'And I'm off to London i' t' morning,' added he, a little wistfully,\nalmost as if beseeching her to show or express some sorrow at a\njourney, the very destination of which showed that he would be\nabsent for some time.\n\n'To Lunnon!' said she, with some surprise. 'Yo're niver thinking o'\ngoing to live theere, for sure!'\n\nSurprise, and curiosity, and wonder; nothing more, as Philip's\ninstinct told him. But he reasoned that first correct impression\naway with ingenious sophistry.\n\n'Not to live there: only to stay for some time. I shall be back, I\nreckon, in a month or so.'\n\n'Oh! that's nought of a going away,' said she, rather petulantly.\n'Them as goes to t' Greenland seas has to bide away for six months\nand more,' and she sighed.\n\nSuddenly a light shone down into Philip's mind. His voice was\nchanged as he spoke next.\n\n'I met that good-for-nothing chap, Kinraid, wi' yo'r father just\nnow. He'll ha' been here, Sylvie?'\n\nShe stooped for something she had dropped, and came up red as a\nrose.\n\n'To be sure; what then?' And she eyed him defiantly, though in her\nheart she trembled, she knew not why.\n\n'What then? and yo'r mother away. He's no company for such as thee,\nat no time, Sylvie.'\n\n'Feyther and me chooses our own company, without iver asking leave\no' yo',' said Sylvia, hastily arranging the things in the little\nwooden work-box that was on the table, preparatory to putting it\naway. At the time, in his agitation, he saw, but did not affix any\nmeaning to it, that the half of some silver coin was among the\ncontents thus turned over before the box was locked.\n\n'But thy mother wouldn't like it, Sylvie; he's played false wi'\nother lasses, he'll be playing thee false some o' these days, if\nthou lets him come about thee. He went on wi' Annie Coulson,\nWilliam's sister, till he broke her heart; and sin then he's been on\nwi' others.'\n\n'I dunnot believe a word on 't,' said Sylvia, standing up, all\naflame.\n\n'I niver telled a lie i' my life,' said Philip, almost choking with\ngrief at her manner to him, and the regard for his rival which she\nbetrayed. 'It were Willie Coulson as telled me, as solemn and\nserious as one man can speak to another; and he said it weren't the\nfirst nor the last time as he had made his own game with young\nwomen.'\n\n'And how dare yo' come here to me wi' yo'r backbiting tales?' said\nSylvia, shivering all over with passion.\n\nPhilip tried to keep calm, and to explain.\n\n'It were yo'r own mother, Sylvia, as knowed yo' had no brother, or\nany one to see after yo'; and yo' so pretty, so pretty, Sylvia,' he\ncontinued, shaking his head, sadly, 'that men run after yo' against\ntheir will, as one may say; and yo'r mother bade me watch o'er ye\nand see what company yo' kept, and who was following after yo', and\nto warn yo', if need were.'\n\n'My mother niver bade yo' to come spying after me, and blaming me\nfor seeing a lad as my feyther thinks well on. An' I don't believe a\nword about Annie Coulson; an' I'm not going to suffer yo' to come\nwi' yo'r tales to me; say 'em out to his face, and hear what he'll\nsay to yo'.'\n\n'Sylvie, Sylvie,' cried poor Philip, as his offended cousin rushed\npast him, and upstairs to her little bedroom, where he heard the\nsound of the wooden bolt flying into its place. He could hear her\nfeet pacing quickly about through the unceiled rafters. He sate\nstill in despair, his head buried in his two hands. He sate till it\ngrew dusk, dark; the wood fire, not gathered together by careful\nhands, died out into gray ashes. Dolly Reid had done her work and\ngone home. There were but Philip and Sylvia in the house. He knew he\nought to be going home, for he had much to do, and many arrangements\nto make. Yet it seemed as though he could not stir. At length he\nraised his stiffened body, and stood up, dizzy. Up the little wooden\nstairs he went, where he had never been before, to the small square\nlanding, almost filled up with the great chest for oat-cake. He\nbreathed hard for a minute, and then knocked at the door of Sylvia's\nroom.\n\n'Sylvie! I'm going away; say good-by.' No answer. Not a sound heard.\n'Sylvie!' (a little louder, and less hoarsely spoken). There was no\nreply. 'Sylvie! I shall be a long time away; perhaps I may niver\ncome back at all'; here he bitterly thought of an unregarded death.\n'Say good-by.' No answer. He waited patiently. Can she be wearied\nout, and gone to sleep, he wondered. Yet once again--'Good-by,\nSylvie, and God bless yo'! I'm sorry I vexed yo'.'\n\nNo reply.\n\nWith a heavy, heavy heart he creaked down the stairs, felt for his\ncap, and left the house.\n\n'She's warned, any way,' thought he. Just at that moment the little\ncasement window of Sylvia's room was opened, and she said--\n\n'Good-by, Philip!'\n\nThe window was shut again as soon as the words were spoken. Philip\nknew the uselessness of remaining; the need for his departure; and\nyet he stood still for a little time like one entranced, as if his\nwill had lost all power to compel him to leave the place. Those two\nwords of hers, which two hours before would have been so far beneath\nhis aspirations, had now power to re-light hope, to quench reproach\nor blame.\n\n'She's but a young lassie,' said he to himself; 'an' Kinraid has\nbeen playing wi' her, as such as he can't help doing, once they get\namong the women. An' I came down sudden on her about Annie Coulson,\nand touched her pride. Maybe, too, it were ill advised to tell her\nhow her mother was feared for her. I couldn't ha' left the place\nto-morrow if he'd been biding here; but he's off for half a year or\nso, and I'll be home again as soon as iver I can. In half a year\nsuch as he forgets, if iver he's thought serious about her; but in\na' my lifetime, if I live to fourscore, I can niver forget. God\nbless her for saying, \"Good-by, Philip.\"' He repeated the words\naloud in fond mimicry of her tones: 'Good-by, Philip.'\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII\n\nEDDY IN LOVE'S CURRENT\n\n\nThe next morning shone bright and clear, if ever a March morning\ndid. The beguiling month was coming in like a lamb, with whatever\nstorms it might go raging out. It was long since Philip had tasted\nthe freshness of the early air on the shore, or in the country, as\nhis employment at the shop detained him in Monkshaven till the\nevening. And as he turned down the quays (or staithes) on the north\nside of the river, towards the shore, and met the fresh sea-breeze\nblowing right in his face, it was impossible not to feel bright and\nelastic. With his knapsack slung over his shoulder, he was prepared\nfor a good stretch towards Hartlepool, whence a coach would take him\nto Newcastle before night. For seven or eight miles the level sands\nwere as short and far more agreeable a road than the up and down\nland-ways. Philip walked on pretty briskly, unconsciously enjoying\nthe sunny landscape before him; the crisp curling waves rushing\nalmost up to his feet, on his right hand, and then swishing back\nover the fine small pebbles into the great swelling sea. To his left\nwere the cliffs rising one behind another, having deep gullies here\nand there between, with long green slopes upward from the land, and\nthen sudden falls of brown and red soil or rock deepening to a yet\ngreater richness of colour at their base towards the blue ocean\nbefore him. The loud, monotonous murmur of the advancing and\nreceding waters lulled him into dreaminess; the sunny look of\neverything tinged his day-dreams with hope. So he trudged merrily\nover the first mile or so; not an obstacle to his measured pace on\nthe hard, level pavement; not a creature to be seen since he had\nleft the little gathering of bare-legged urchins dabbling in the\nsea-pools near Monkshaven. The cares of land were shut out by the\nglorious barrier of rocks before him. There were some great masses\nthat had been detached by the action of the weather, and lay half\nembedded in the sand, draperied over by the heavy pendent\nolive-green seaweed. The waves were nearer at this point; the\nadvancing sea came up with a mighty distant length of roar; here and\nthere the smooth swell was lashed by the fret against unseen rocks\ninto white breakers; but otherwise the waves came up from the German\nOcean upon that English shore with a long steady roll that might\nhave taken its first impetus far away, in the haunt of the\nsea-serpent on the coast of 'Norroway over the foam.' The air was\nsoft as May; right overhead the sky was blue, but it deadened into\ngray near the sea lines. Flocks of seagulls hovered about the edge\nof the waves, slowly rising and turning their white under-plumage to\nglimmer in the sunlight as Philip approached. The whole scene was so\npeaceful, so soothing, that it dispelled the cares and fears (too\nwell founded in fact) which had weighed down on his heart during the\ndark hours of the past night.\n\nThere was Haytersbank gully opening down its green entrance among\nthe warm brown bases of the cliffs. Below, in the sheltered\nbrushwood, among the last year's withered leaves, some primroses\nmight be found. He half thought of gathering Sylvia a posy of them,\nand rushing up to the farm to make a little farewell peace-offering.\nBut on looking at his watch, he put all thoughts of such an action\nout of his head; it was above an hour later than he had supposed,\nand he must make all haste on to Hartlepool. Just as he was\napproaching this gully, a man came dashing down, and ran out some\nway upon the sand with the very force of his descent; then he turned\nto the left and took the direction of Hartlepool a hundred yards or\nso in advance of Philip. He never stayed to look round him, but went\nswiftly and steadily on his way. By the peculiar lurch in his\nwalk--by everything--Philip knew it was the specksioneer, Kinraid.\n\nNow the road up Haytersbank gully led to the farm, and nowhere else.\nStill any one wishing to descend to the shore might do so by first\ngoing up to the Robsons' house, and skirting the walls till they\ncame to the little slender path down to the shore. But by the farm,\nby the very house-door they must of necessity pass. Philip slackened\nhis pace, keeping under the shadow of the rock. By-and-by Kinraid,\nwalking on the sunlight open sands, turned round and looked long and\nearnestly towards Haytersbank gully. Hepburn paused when he paused,\nbut as intently as he looked at some object above, so intently did\nHepburn look at him. No need to ascertain by sight towards whom his\nlooks, his thoughts were directed. He took off his hat and waved it,\ntouching one part of it as if with particular meaning. When he\nturned away at last, Hepburn heaved a heavy sigh, and crept yet more\ninto the cold dank shadow of the cliffs. Each step was now a heavy\ntask, his sad heart tired and weary. After a while he climbed up a\nfew feet, so as to mingle his form yet more completely with the\nstones and rocks around. Stumbling over the uneven and often jagged\npoints, slipping on the sea-weed, plunging into little pools of\nwater left by the ebbing tide in some natural basins, he yet kept\nhis eyes fixed as if in fascination on Kinraid, and made his way\nalmost alongside of him. But the last hour had pinched Hepburn's\nfeatures into something of the wan haggardness they would wear when\nhe should first be lying still for ever.\n\nAnd now the two men were drawing near a creek, about eight miles\nfrom Monkshaven. The creek was formed by a beck (or small stream)\nthat came flowing down from the moors, and took its way to the sea\nbetween the widening rocks. The melting of the snows and running of\nthe flooded water-springs above made this beck in the early\nspring-time both deep and wide. Hepburn knew that here they both\nmust take a path leading inland to a narrow foot-bridge about a\nquarter of a mile up the stream; indeed from this point, owing to\nthe jutting out of the rocks, the land path was the shortest; and\nthis way lay by the water-side at an angle right below the cliff to\nwhich Hepburn's steps were leading him. He knew that on this long\nlevel field path he might easily be seen by any one following; nay,\nif he followed any one at a short distance, for it was full of\nturnings; and he resolved, late as he was, to sit down for a while\ntill Kinraid was far enough in advance for him to escape being seen.\nHe came up to the last rock behind which he could be concealed;\nseven or eight feet above the stream he stood, and looked cautiously\nfor the specksioneer. Up by the rushing stream he looked, then right\nbelow.\n\n'It is God's providence,' he murmured. 'It is God's providence.'\n\nHe crouched down where he had been standing and covered his face\nwith his hands. He tried to deafen as well as to blind himself, that\nhe might neither hear nor see anything of the coming event of which\nhe, an inhabitant of Monkshaven at that day, well understood the\nbetokening signs.\n\nKinraid had taken the larger angle of the sands before turning up\ntowards the bridge. He came along now nearing the rocks. By this\ntime he was sufficiently buoyant to whistle to himself. It steeled\nPhilip's heart to what was coming to hear his rival whistling, 'Weel\nmay the keel row,' so soon after parting with Sylvia.\n\nThe instant Kinraid turned the corner of the cliff, the ambush was\nupon him. Four man-of-war's men sprang on him and strove to pinion\nhim.\n\n'In the King's name!' cried they, with rough, triumphant jeers.\n\nTheir boat was moored not a dozen yards above; they were sent by the\ntender of a frigate lying off Hartlepool for fresh water. The tender\nwas at anchor just beyond the jutting rocks in face.\n\nThey knew that fishermen were in the habit of going to and from\ntheir nets by the side of the creek; but such a prize as this\nactive, strong, and evidently superior sailor, was what they had not\nhoped for, and their endeavours to secure him were in proportion to\nthe value of the prize.\n\nAlthough taken by surprise, and attacked by so many, Kinraid did not\nlose his wits. He wrenched himself free, crying out loud:\n\n'Avast, I'm a protected whaler. I claim my protection. I've my\npapers to show, I'm bonded specksioneer to the _Urania_ whaler,\nDonkin captain, North Shields port.'\n\nAs a protected whaler, the press-gang had, by the 17th section of\nAct 26 Geo. III. no legal right to seize him, unless he had failed\nto return to his ship by the 10th March following the date of his\nbond. But of what use were the papers he hastily dragged out of his\nbreast; of what use were laws in those days of slow intercourse with\nsuch as were powerful enough to protect, and in the time of popular\npanic against a French invasion?\n\n'D--n your protection,' cried the leader of the press-gang; 'come\nand serve his Majesty, that's better than catching whales.'\n\n'Is it though?' said the specksioneer, with a motion of his hand,\nwhich the swift-eyed sailor opposed to him saw and interpreted\nrightly.\n\n'Thou wilt, wilt thou? Close with him, Jack; and ware the cutlass.'\n\nIn a minute his cutlass was forced from him, and it became a\nhand-to-hand struggle, of which, from the difference in numbers, it\nwas not difficult to foretell the result. Yet Kinraid made desperate\nefforts to free himself; he wasted no breath in words, but fought,\nas the men said, 'like a very devil.'\n\nHepburn heard loud pants of breath, great thuds, the dull struggle\nof limbs on the sand, the growling curses of those who thought to\nhave managed their affair more easily; the sudden cry of some one\nwounded, not Kinraid he knew, Kinraid would have borne any pain in\nsilence at such a moment; another wrestling, swearing, infuriated\nstrife, and then a strange silence. Hepburn sickened at the heart;\nwas then his rival dead? had he left this bright world? lost his\nlife--his love? For an instant Hepburn felt guilty of his death; he\nsaid to himself he had never wished him dead, and yet in the\nstruggle he had kept aloof, and now it might be too late for ever.\nPhilip could not bear the suspense; he looked stealthily round the\ncorner of the rock behind which he had been hidden, and saw that\nthey had overpowered Kinraid, and, too exhausted to speak, were\nbinding him hand and foot to carry him to their boat.\n\nKinraid lay as still as any hedgehog: he rolled when they pushed\nhim; he suffered himself to be dragged without any resistance, any\nmotion; the strong colour brought into his face while fighting was\ngone now, his countenance was livid pale; his lips were tightly held\ntogether, as if it cost him more effort to be passive, wooden, and\nstiff in their hands than it had done to fight and struggle with all\nhis might. His eyes seemed the only part about him that showed\ncognizance of what was going on. They were watchful, vivid, fierce\nas those of a wild cat brought to bay, seeking in its desperate\nquickened brain for some mode of escape not yet visible, and in all\nprobability never to become visible to the hopeless creature in its\nsupreme agony.\n\nWithout a motion of his head, he was perceiving and taking in\neverything while he lay bound at the bottom of the boat. A sailor\nsat by his side, who had been hurt by a blow from him. The man held\nhis head in his hand, moaning; but every now and then he revenged\nhimself by a kick at the prostrate specksioneer, till even his\ncomrades stopped their cursing and swearing at their prisoner for\nthe trouble he had given them, to cry shame on their comrade. But\nKinraid never spoke, nor shrank from the outstretched foot.\n\nOne of his captors, with the successful insolence of victory,\nventured to jeer him on the supposed reason for his vehement and\nhopeless resistance.\n\nHe might have said yet more insolent things; the kicks might have\nhit harder; Kinraid did not hear or heed. His soul was beating\nitself against the bars of inflexible circumstance; reviewing in one\nterrible instant of time what had been, what might have been, what\nwas. Yet while these thoughts thus stabbed him, he was still\nmechanically looking out for chances. He moved his head a little, so\nas to turn towards Haytersbank, where Sylvia must be quickly, if\nsadly, going about her simple daily work; and then his quick eye\ncaught Hepburn's face, blanched with excitement rather than fear,\nwatching eagerly from behind the rock, where he had sat breathless\nduring the affray and the impressment of his rival.\n\n'Come here, lad!' shouted the specksioneer as soon as he saw Philip,\nheaving and writhing his body the while with so much vigour that the\nsailors started away from the work they were engaged in about the\nboat, and held him down once more, as if afraid he should break the\nstrong rope that held him like withes of green flax. But the bound\nman had no such notion in his head. His mighty wish was to call\nHepburn near that he might send some message by him to Sylvia. 'Come\nhere, Hepburn,' he cried again, falling back this time so weak and\nexhausted that the man-of-war's men became sympathetic.\n\n'Come down, peeping Tom, and don't be afeared,' they called out.\n\n'I'm not afeared,' said Philip; 'I'm no sailor for yo' t' impress\nme: nor have yo' any right to take that fellow; he's a Greenland\nspecksioneer, under protection, as I know and can testify.'\n\n'Yo' and yo'r testify go hang. Make haste, man and hear what this\ngem'man, as was in a dirty blubbery whale-ship, and is now in his\nMajesty's service, has got to say. I dare say, Jack,' went on the\nspeaker, 'it's some message to his sweetheart, asking her to come\nfor to serve on board ship along with he, like Billy Taylor's young\nwoman.'\n\nPhilip was coming towards them slowly, not from want of activity,\nbut because he was undecided what he should be called upon to do or\nto say by the man whom he hated and dreaded, yet whom just now he\ncould not help admiring.\n\nKinraid groaned with impatience at seeing one, free to move with\nquick decision, so slow and dilatory.\n\n'Come on then,' cried the sailors, 'or we'll take you too on board,\nand run you up and down the main-mast a few times. Nothing like life\naboard ship for quickening a land-lubber.'\n\n'Yo'd better take him and leave me,' said Kinraid, grimly. 'I've\nbeen taught my lesson; and seemingly he has his yet to learn.'\n\n'His Majesty isn't a schoolmaster to need scholars; but a jolly good\ncaptain to need men,' replied the leader of the gang, eyeing Philip\nnevertheless, and questioning within himself how far, with only two\nother available men, they durst venture on his capture as well as\nthe specksioneer's. It might be done, he thought, even though there\nwas this powerful captive aboard, and the boat to manage too; but,\nrunning his eye over Philip's figure, he decided that the tall\nstooping fellow was never cut out for a sailor, and that he should\nget small thanks if he captured him, to pay him for the possible\nrisk of losing the other. Or else the mere fact of being a landsman\nwas of as little consequence to the press-gang, as the protecting\npapers which Kinraid had vainly showed.\n\n'Yon fellow wouldn't have been worth his grog this many a day, and\nbe d--d to you,' said he, catching Hepburn by the shoulder, and\ngiving him a push. Philip stumbled over something in this, his\nforced run. He looked down; his foot had caught in Kinraid's hat,\nwhich had dropped off in the previous struggle. In the band that\nwent round the low crown, a ribbon was knotted; a piece of that same\nribbon which Philip had chosen out, with such tender hope, to give\nto Sylvia for the Corneys' party on new year's eve. He knew every\ndelicate thread that made up the briar-rose pattern; and a spasm of\nhatred towards Kinraid contracted his heart. He had been almost\nrelenting into pity for the man captured before his eyes; now he\nabhorred him.\n\nKinraid did not speak for a minute or two. The sailors, who had\nbegun to take him into favour, were all agog with curiosity to hear\nthe message to his sweetheart, which they believed he was going to\nsend. Hepburn's perceptions, quickened with his vehement agitation\nof soul, were aware of this feeling of theirs; and it increased his\nrage against Kinraid, who had exposed the idea of Sylvia to be the\nsubject of ribald whispers. But the specksioneer cared little what\nothers said or thought about the maiden, whom he yet saw before his\nclosed eyelids as she stood watching him, from the Haytersbank\ngully, waving her hands, her handkerchief, all in one passionate\nfarewell.\n\n'What do yo' want wi' me?' asked Hepburn at last in a gloomy tone.\nIf he could have helped it, he would have kept silence till Kinraid\nspoke first; but he could no longer endure the sailors' nudges, and\nwinks, and jests among themselves.\n\n'Tell Sylvia,' said Kinraid----\n\n'There's a smart name for a sweetheart,' exclaimed one of the men;\nbut Kinraid went straight on,--\n\n'What yo've seen; how I've been pressed by this cursed gang.'\n\n'Civil words, messmate, if you please. Sylvia can't abide cursing\nand swearing, I'm sure. We're gentlemen serving his Majesty on board\nthe _Alcestis_, and this proper young fellow shall be helped on to\nmore honour and glory than he'd ever get bobbing for whales. Tell\nSylvia this, with my love; Jack Carter's love, if she's anxious\nabout my name.'\n\nOne of the sailors laughed at this rude humour; another bade Carter\nhold his stupid tongue. Philip hated him in his heart. Kinraid\nhardly heard him. He was growing faint with the heavy blows he had\nreceived, the stunning fall he had met with, and the reaction from\nhis dogged self-control at first.\n\nPhilip did not speak nor move.\n\n'Tell her,' continued Kinraid, rousing himself for another effort,\n'what yo've seen. Tell her I'll come back to her. Bid her not forget\nthe great oath we took together this morning; she's as much my wife\nas if we'd gone to church;--I'll come back and marry her afore\nlong.'\n\nPhilip said something inarticulately.\n\n'Hurra!' cried Carter, 'and I'll be best man. Tell her, too that\nI'll have an eye on her sweetheart, and keep him from running after\nother girls.'\n\n'Yo'll have yo'r hands full, then,' muttered Philip, his passion\nboiling over at the thought of having been chosen out from among all\nmen to convey such a message as Kinraid's to Sylvia.\n\n'Make an end of yo'r d--d yarns, and be off,' said the man who had\nbeen hurt by Kinraid, and who had sate apart and silent till now.\n\nPhilip turned away; Kinraid raised himself and cried after him,--\n\n'Hepburn, Hepburn! tell her---' what he added Philip could not hear,\nfor the words were lost before they reached him in the outward noise\nof the regular splash of the oars and the rush of the wind down the\ngully, with which mingled the closer sound that filled his ears of\nhis own hurrying blood surging up into his brain. He was conscious\nthat he had said something in reply to Kinraid's adjuration that he\nwould deliver his message to Sylvia, at the very time when Carter\nhad stung him into fresh anger by the allusion to the possibility of\nthe specksioneer's 'running after other girls,' for, for an instant,\nHepburn had been touched by the contrast of circumstances. Kinraid\nan hour or two ago,--Kinraid a banished man; for in those days, an\nimpressed sailor might linger out years on some foreign station, far\nfrom those he loved, who all this time remained ignorant of his\ncruel fate.\n\nBut Hepburn began to wonder what he himself had said--how much of a\npromise he had made to deliver those last passionate words of\nKinraid's. He could not recollect how much, how little he had said;\nhe knew he had spoken hoarsely and low almost at the same time as\nCarter had uttered his loud joke. But he doubted if Kinraid had\ncaught his words.\n\nAnd then the dread Inner Creature, who lurks in each of our hearts,\narose and said, 'It is as well: a promise given is a fetter to the\ngiver. But a promise is not given when it has not been received.'\n\nAt a sudden impulse, he turned again towards the shore when he had\ncrossed the bridge, and almost ran towards the verge of the land.\nThen he threw himself down on the soft fine turf that grew on the\nmargin of the cliffs overhanging the sea, and commanding an extent\nof view towards the north. His face supported by his hands, he\nlooked down upon the blue rippling ocean, flashing here and there,\ninto the sunlight in long, glittering lines. The boat was still in\nthe distance, making her swift silent way with long regular bounds\nto the tender that lay in the offing.\n\nHepburn felt insecure, as in a nightmare dream, so long as the boat\ndid not reach her immediate destination. His contracted eyes could\nsee four minute figures rowing with ceaseless motion, and a fifth\nsate at the helm. But he knew there was a sixth, unseen, lying,\nbound and helpless, at the bottom of the boat; and his fancy kept\nexpecting this man to start up and break his bonds, and overcome all\nthe others, and return to the shore free and triumphant.\n\nIt was by no fault of Hepburn's that the boat sped well away; that\nshe was now alongside the tender, dancing on the waves; now emptied\nof her crew; now hoisted up to her place. No fault of his! and yet\nit took him some time before he could reason himself into the belief\nthat his mad, feverish wishes not an hour before--his wild prayer to\nbe rid of his rival, as he himself had scrambled onward over the\nrocks alongside of Kinraid's path on the sands--had not compelled\nthe event.\n\n'Anyhow,' thought he, as he rose up, 'my prayer is granted. God be\nthanked!'\n\nOnce more he looked out towards the ship. She had spread her\nbeautiful great sails, and was standing out to sea in the glittering\npath of the descending sun.\n\nHe saw that he had been delayed on his road, and had lingered long.\nHe shook his stiffened limbs, shouldered his knapsack, and prepared\nto walk on to Hartlepool as swiftly as he could.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX\n\nAN IMPORTANT MISSION\n\n\nPhilip was too late for the coach he had hoped to go by, but there\nwas another that left at night, and which reached Newcastle in the\nforenoon, so that, by the loss of a night's sleep, he might overtake\nhis lost time. But, restless and miserable, he could not stop in\nHartlepool longer than to get some hasty food at the inn from which\nthe coach started. He acquainted himself with the names of the towns\nthrough which it would pass, and the inns at which it would stop,\nand left word that the coachman was to be on the look-out for him\nand pick him up at some one of these places.\n\nHe was thoroughly worn out before this happened--too much tired to\ngain any sleep in the coach. When he reached Newcastle, he went to\nengage his passage in the next London-bound smack, and then directed\nhis steps to Robinson's, in the Side, to make all the inquiries he\ncould think of respecting the plough his uncle wanted to know about.\n\nSo it was pretty late in the afternoon, indeed almost evening,\nbefore he arrived at the small inn on the quay-side, where he\nintended to sleep. It was but a rough kind of place, frequented\nprincipally by sailors; he had been recommended to it by Daniel\nRobson, who had known it well in former days. The accommodation in\nit was, however, clean and homely, and the people keeping it were\nrespectable enough in their way.\n\nStill Hepburn was rather repelled by the appearance of the sailors\nwho sate drinking in the bar, and he asked, in a low voice, if there\nwas not another room. The woman stared in surprise, and only shook\nher head. Hepburn went to a separate table, away from the roaring\nfire, which on this cold March evening was the great attraction, and\ncalled for food and drink. Then seeing that the other men were\neyeing him with the sociable idea of speaking to him, he asked for\npen and ink and paper, with the intention of defeating their purpose\nby pre-occupation on his part. But when the paper came, the new pen,\nthe unused thickened ink, he hesitated long before he began to\nwrite; and at last he slowly put down the words,--\n\n'DEAR AND HONOURED UNCLE,'----\n\nThere was a pause; his meal was brought and hastily swallowed. Even\nwhile he was eating it, he kept occasionally touching up the letters\nof these words. When he had drunk a glass of ale he began again to\nwrite: fluently this time, for he was giving an account of the\nplough. Then came another long stop; he was weighing in his own mind\nwhat he should say about Kinraid. Once he thought for a second of\nwriting to Sylvia herself, and telling her---how much? She might\ntreasure up her lover's words like grains of gold, while they were\nlighter than dust in their meaning to Philip's mind; words which\nsuch as the specksioneer used as counters to beguile and lead astray\nsilly women. It was for him to prove his constancy by action; and\nthe chances of his giving such proof were infinitesimal in Philip's\nestimation. But should the latter mention the bare fact of Kinraid's\nimpressment to Robson? That would have been the natural course of\nthings, remembering that the last time Philip had seen either, they\nwere in each other's company. Twenty times he put his pen to the\npaper with the intention of relating briefly the event that had\nbefallen Kinraid; and as often he stopped, as though the first word\nwould be irrevocable. While he thus sate pen in hand, thinking\nhimself wiser than conscience, and looking on beyond the next step\nwhich she bade him take into an indefinite future, he caught some\nfragments of the sailors' talk at the other end of the room, which\nmade him listen to their words. They were speaking of that very\nKinraid, the thought of whom filled his own mind like an actual\npresence. In a rough, careless way they spoke of the specksioneer,\nwith admiration enough for his powers as a sailor and harpooner; and\nfrom that they passed on to jesting mention of his power amongst\nwomen, and one or two girls' names were spoken of in connection with\nhim. Hepburn silently added Annie Coulson and Sylvia Robson to this\nlist, and his cheeks turned paler as he did so. Long after they had\ndone speaking about Kinraid, after they had paid their shot, and\ngone away, he sate in the same attitude, thinking bitter thoughts.\n\nThe people of the house prepared for bed. Their silent guest took no\nheed of their mute signs. At length the landlord spoke to him, and\nhe started, gathered his wits together with an effort, and prepared\nto retire with the rest. But before he did so, he signed and\ndirected the letter to his uncle, leaving it still open, however, in\ncase some sudden feeling should prompt him to add a postscript. The\nlandlord volunteered the information that the letter his guest had\nbeen writing must be posted early the next morning if it was going\nsouth; as the mails in that direction only left Newcastle every\nother day.\n\nAll night long Hepburn wearied himself with passionate tossings,\nprompted by stinging recollection. Towards morning he fell into a\ndead sound sleep. He was roused by a hasty knocking at the door. It\nwas broad full daylight; he had overslept himself, and the smack was\nleaving by the early tide. He was even now summoned on board. He\ndressed, wafered his letter, and rushed with it to the neighbouring\npost-office; and, without caring to touch the breakfast for which he\npaid, he embarked. Once on board, he experienced the relief which it\nalways is to an undecided man, and generally is at first to any one\nwho has been paltering with duty, when circumstances decide for him.\nIn the first case, it is pleasant to be relieved from the burden of\ndecision; in the second, the responsibility seems to be shifted on\nto impersonal events.\n\nAnd so Philip sailed out of the mouth of the Tyne on to the great\nopen sea. It would be a week before the smack reached London, even\nif she pursued a tolerably straight course, but she had to keep a\nsharp look-out after possible impressment of her crew; and it was\nnot until after many dodges and some adventures that, at the end of\na fortnight from the time of his leaving Monkshaven, Philip found\nhimself safely housed in London, and ready to begin the delicate\npiece of work which was given him to do.\n\nHe felt himself fully capable of unravelling each clue to\ninformation, and deciding on the value of the knowledge so gained.\nBut during the leisure of the voyage he had wisely determined to\ncommunicate everything he learnt about Dickinson, in short, every\nstep he took in the matter, by letter to his employers. And thus his\nmind both in and out of his lodgings might have appeared to have\nbeen fully occupied with the concerns of others.\n\nBut there were times when the miserable luxury of dwelling upon his\nown affairs was his--when he lay down in his bed till he fell into\nrestless sleep--when the point to which his steps tended in his\nwalks was ascertained. Then he gave himself up to memory, and regret\nwhich often deepened into despair, and but seldom was cheered by\nhope.\n\nHe grew so impatient of the ignorance in which he was kept--for in\nthose days of heavy postage any correspondence he might have had on\nmere Monkshaven intelligence was very limited--as to the affairs at\nHaytersbank, that he cut out an advertisement respecting some new\nkind of plough, from a newspaper that lay in the chop-house where he\nusually dined, and rising early the next morning he employed the\ntime thus gained in going round to the shop where these new ploughs\nwere sold.\n\nThat night he wrote another letter to Daniel Robson, with a long\naccount of the merits of the implements he had that day seen. With a\nsick heart and a hesitating hand, he wound up with a message of\nregard to his aunt and to Sylvia; an expression of regard which he\ndared not make as warm as he wished, and which, consequently, fell\nbelow the usual mark attained by such messages, and would have\nappeared to any one who cared to think about it as cold and formal.\n\nWhen this letter was despatched, Hepburn began to wonder what he had\nhoped for in writing it. He knew that Daniel could write--or rather\nthat he could make strange hieroglyphics, the meaning of which\npuzzled others and often himself; but these pen-and-ink signs were\nseldom employed by Robson, and never, so far as Philip knew, for the\npurpose of letter-writing. But still he craved so for news of\nSylvia--even for a sight of paper which she had seen, and perhaps\ntouched--that he thought all his trouble about the plough (to say\nnothing of the one-and-twopence postage which he had prepaid in\norder to make sure of his letter's reception in the frugal household\nat Haytersbank) well lost for the mere chance of his uncle's caring\nenough for the intelligence to write in reply, or even to get some\nfriend to write an answer; for in such case, perhaps, Philip might\nsee her name mentioned in some way, even though it was only that she\nsent her duty to him.\n\nBut the post-office was dumb; no letter came from Daniel Robson.\nPhilip heard, it is true, from his employers pretty frequently on\nbusiness; and he felt sure they would have named it, if any ill had\nbefallen his uncle's family, for they knew of the relationship and\nof his intimacy there. They generally ended their formal letters\nwith as formal a summary of Monkshaven news; but there was never a\nmention of the Robsons, and that of itself was well, but it did not\nsoothe Philip's impatient curiosity. He had never confided his\nattachment to his cousin to any one, it was not his way; but he\nsometimes thought that if Coulson had not taken his present\nappointment to a confidential piece of employment so ill, he would\nhave written to him and asked him to go up to Haytersbank Farm, and\nlet him know how they all were.\n\nAll this time he was transacting the affair on which he had been\nsent, with great skill; and, indeed, in several ways, he was quietly\nlaying the foundation for enlarging the business in Monkshaven.\nNaturally grave and quiet, and slow to speak, he impressed those who\nsaw him with the idea of greater age and experience than he really\npossessed. Indeed, those who encountered him in London, thought he\nwas absorbed in the business of money-making. Yet before the time\ncame when he could wind up affairs and return to Monkshaven, he\nwould have given all he possessed for a letter from his uncle,\ntelling him something about Sylvia. For he still hoped to hear from\nRobson, although he knew that he hoped against reason. But we often\nconvince ourselves by good argument that what we wish for need never\nhave been expected; and then, at the end of our reasoning, find that\nwe might have saved ourselves the trouble, for that our wishes are\nuntouched, and are as strong enemies to our peace of mind as ever.\nHepburn's baulked hope was the Mordecai sitting in Haman's gate; all\nhis success in his errand to London, his well-doing in worldly\naffairs, was tasteless, and gave him no pleasure, because of this\nblank and void of all intelligence concerning Sylvia.\n\nAnd yet he came back with a letter from the Fosters in his pocket,\ncurt, yet expressive of deep gratitude for his discreet services in\nLondon; and at another time--in fact, if Philip's life had been\nordered differently to what it was--it might have given this man a\nnot unworthy pleasure to remember that, without a penny of his own,\nsimply by diligence, honesty, and faithful quick-sightedness as to\nthe interests of his masters, he had risen to hold the promise of\nbeing their successor, and to be ranked by them as a trusted friend.\n\nAs the Newcastle smack neared the shore on her voyage home, Hepburn\nlooked wistfully out for the faint gray outline of Monkshaven Priory\nagainst the sky, and the well-known cliffs; as if the masses of\ninanimate stone could tell him any news of Sylvia.\n\nIn the streets of Shields, just after landing, he encountered a\nneighbour of the Robsons, and an acquaintance of his own. By this\nhonest man, he was welcomed as a great traveller is welcomed on his\nreturn from a long voyage, with many hearty good shakes of the hand,\nmuch repetition of kind wishes, and offers to treat him to drink.\nYet, from some insurmountable feeling, Philip avoided all mention of\nthe family who were the principal bond between the honest farmer and\nhimself. He did not know why, but he could not bear the shock of\nfirst hearing her name in the open street, or in the rough\npublic-house. And thus he shrank from the intelligence he craved to\nhear.\n\nThus he knew no more about the Robsons when he returned to\nMonkshaven, than he had done on the day when he had last seen them;\nand, of course, his first task there was to give a long _viva voce_\naccount of all his London proceedings to the two brothers Foster,\nwho, considering that they had heard the result of everything by\nletter, seemed to take an insatiable interest in details.\n\nHe could hardly tell why, but even when released from the Fosters'\nparlour, he was unwilling to go to Haytersbank Farm. It was late, it\nis true, but on a May evening even country people keep up till eight\nor nine o'clock. Perhaps it was because Hepburn was still in his\ntravel-stained dress; having gone straight to the shop on his\narrival in Monkshaven. Perhaps it was because, if he went this night\nfor the short half-hour intervening before bed-time, he would have\nno excuse for paying a longer visit on the following evening. At any\nrate, he proceeded straight to Alice Rose's, as soon as he had\nfinished his interview with his employers.\n\nBoth Hester and Coulson had given him their welcome home in the\nshop, which they had, however, left an hour or two before him.\n\nYet they gave him a fresh greeting, almost one in which surprise was\nblended, when he came to his lodgings. Even Alice seemed gratified\nby his spending this first evening with them, as if she had thought\nit might have been otherwise. Weary though he was, he exerted\nhimself to talk and to relate what he had done and seen in London,\nas far as he could without breaking confidence with his employers.\nIt was something to see the pleasure he gave to his auditors,\nalthough there were several mixed feelings in their minds to produce\nthe expression of it which gratified him. Coulson was sorry for his\nformer ungenerous reception of the news that Philip was going to\nLondon; Hester and her mother each secretly began to feel as if this\nevening was like more happy evenings of old, before the Robsons came\nto Haytersbank Farm; and who knows what faint delicious hopes this\nresemblance may not have suggested?\n\nWhile Philip, restless and excited, feeling that he could not sleep,\nwas glad to pass away the waking hours that must intervene before\nto-morrow night, at times, he tried to make them talk of what had\nhappened in Monkshaven during his absence, but all had gone on in an\neventless manner, as far as he could gather; if they knew of\nanything affecting the Robsons, they avoided speaking of it to him;\nand, indeed, how little likely were they ever to have heard their\nnames while he was away?\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX\n\nLOVED AND LOST\n\n\nPhilip walked towards the Robsons' farm like a man in a dream, who\nhas everything around him according to his wish, and yet is\nconscious of a secret mysterious inevitable drawback to his\nenjoyment. Hepburn did not care to think--would not realize what\nthis drawback, which need not have been mysterious in his case, was.\n\nThe May evening was glorious in light and shadow. The crimson sun\nwarmed up the chilly northern air to a semblance of pleasant heat.\nThe spring sights and sounds were all about; the lambs were bleating\nout their gentle weariness before they sank to rest by the side of\ntheir mothers; the linnets were chirping in every bush of golden\ngorse that grew out of the stone walls; the lark was singing her\ngood-night in the cloudless sky, before she dropped down to her nest\nin the tender green wheat; all spoke of brooding peace--but Philip's\nheart was not at peace.\n\nYet he was going to proclaim his good fortune. His masters had that\nday publicly announced that Coulson and he were to be their\nsuccessors, and he had now arrived at that longed-for point in his\nbusiness, when he had resolved to openly speak of his love to\nSylvia, and might openly strive to gain her love. But, alas! the\nfulfilment of that wish of his had lagged sadly behind. He was\nplaced as far as he could, even in his most sanguine moments, have\nhoped to be as regarded business, but Sylvia was as far from his\nattainment as ever--nay, farther. Still the great obstacle was\nremoved in Kinraid's impressment. Philip took upon himself to decide\nthat, with such a man as the specksioneer, absence was equivalent to\nfaithless forgetfulness. He thought that he had just grounds for\nthis decision in the account he had heard of Kinraid's behaviour to\nAnnie Coulson; to the other nameless young girl, her successor in\nhis fickle heart; in the ribald talk of the sailors in the Newcastle\npublic-house. It would be well for Sylvia if she could forget as\nquickly; and, to promote this oblivion, the name of her lover should\nnever be brought up, either in praise or blame. And Philip would be\npatient and enduring; all the time watching over her, and labouring\nto win her reluctant love.\n\nThere she was! He saw her as he stood at the top of the little\nhill-path leading down to the Robsons' door. She was out of doors,\nin the garden, which, at some distance from the house, sloped up the\nbank on the opposite side of the gully; much too far off to be\nspoken to--not too far off to be gazed at by eyes that caressed her\nevery movement. How well Philip knew that garden; placed long ago by\nsome tenant of the farm on a southern slope; walled in with rough\nmoorland stones; planted with berry-bushes for use, and southernwood\nand sweet-briar for sweetness of smell. When the Robsons had first\ncome to Haytersbank, and Sylvia was scarcely more than a pretty\nchild, how well he remembered helping her with the arrangement of\nthis garden; laying out his few spare pence in hen-and-chicken\ndaisies at one time, in flower-seeds at another; again in a\nrose-tree in a pot. He knew how his unaccustomed hands had laboured\nwith the spade at forming a little primitive bridge over the beck in\nthe hollow before winter streams should make it too deep for\nfording; how he had cut down branches of the mountain-ash and\ncovered them over, yet decked with their scarlet berries, with sods\nof green turf, beyond which the brilliancy crept out; but now it was\nmonths and years since he had been in that garden, which had lost\nits charm for Sylvia, as she found the bleak sea-winds came up and\nblighted all endeavours at cultivating more than the most useful\nthings--pot-herbs, marigolds, potatoes, onions, and such-like. Why\ndid she tarry there now, standing quite motionless up by the highest\nbit of wall, looking over the sea, with her hand shading her eyes?\nQuite motionless; as if she were a stone statue. He began to wish\nshe would move--would look at him--but any way that she would move,\nand not stand gazing thus over that great dreary sea.\n\nHe went down the path with an impatient step, and entered the\nhouse-place. There sat his aunt spinning, and apparently as well as\never. He could hear his uncle talking to Kester in the neighbouring\nshippen; all was well in the household. Why was Sylvia standing in\nthe garden in that strange quiet way?\n\n'Why, lad! thou'rt a sight for sair een!' said his aunt, as she\nstood up to welcome him back. 'An' when didst ta come, eh?--but thy\nuncle will be glad to see thee, and to hear thee talk about yon\npleughs; he's thought a deal o' thy letters. I'll go call him in.'\n\n'Not yet,' said Philip, stopping her in her progress towards the\ndoor. 'He's busy talking to Kester. I'm in no haste to be gone. I\ncan stay a couple of hours. Sit down, and tell me how you are\nyoursel'--and how iverything is. And I've a deal to tell you.'\n\n'To be sure--to be sure. To think thou's been in Lunnon sin' I saw\nthee!--well to be sure! There's a vast o' coming and going i' this\nworld. Thou'll mind yon specksioneer lad, him as was cousin to t'\nCorneys--Charley Kinraid?'\n\nMind him! As if he could forget him.\n\n'Well! he's dead and gone.'\n\n'Dead! Who told you? I don't understand,' said Philip, in strange\nbewilderment. Could Kinraid have tried to escape after all, and been\nwounded, killed in the attempt? If not, how should they know he was\ndead? Missing he might be, though how this should be known was\nstrange, as he was supposed to be sailing to the Greenland seas. But\ndead! What did they mean? At Philip's worst moment of hatred he had\nhardly dared to wish him dead.\n\n'Dunnot yo' mention it afore our Sylvie; we niver speak on him to\nher, for she takes it a deal to heart, though I'm thinkin' it were a\ngood thing for her; for he'd got a hold of her--he had on Bessy\nCorney, too, as her mother telled me;--not that I iver let on to\nthem as Sylvia frets after him, so keep a calm sough, my lad. It's a\ngirl's fancy--just a kind o' calf-love; let it go by; and it's well\nfor her he's dead, though it's hard to say so on a drowned man.'\n\n'Drowned!' said Philip. 'How do yo' know?' half hoping that the poor\ndrenched swollen body might have been found, and thus all questions\nand dilemmas solved. Kinraid might have struggled overboard with\nropes or handcuffs on, and so have been drowned.\n\n'Eh, lad! there's no misdoubtin' it. He were thought a deal on by t'\ncaptain o' t' _Urania_; and when he niver come back on t' day when\nshe ought for to have sailed, he sent to Kinraid's people at\nCullercoats, and they sent to Brunton's i' Newcassel, and they knew\nhe'd been here. T' captain put off sailing for two or three days,\nthat he might ha' that much law; but when he heard as Kinraid were\nnot at Corneys', but had left 'em a'most on to a week, he went off\nto them Northern seas wi' t' next best specksioneer he could find.\nFor there's no use speaking ill on t' dead; an' though I couldn't\nabear his coming for iver about t' house, he were a rare good\nspecksioneer, as I've been told.'\n\n'But how do you know he was drowned?' said Philip, feeling guiltily\ndisappointed at his aunt's story.\n\n'Why, lad! I'm a'most ashamed to tell thee, I were sore put out\nmysel'; but Sylvia were so broken-hearted like I couldn't cast it up\nto her as I should ha' liked: th' silly lass had gone and gi'en him\na bit o' ribbon, as many a one knowed, for it had been a vast\nnoticed and admired that evenin' at th' Corneys'--new year's eve I\nthink it were--and t' poor vain peacock had tied it on his hat, so\nthat when t' tide----hist! there's Sylvie coming in at t' back-door;\nnever let on,' and in a forced made-up voice she inquired aloud, for\nhitherto she had been speaking almost in a whisper,--\n\n'And didst ta see King George an' Queen Charlotte?'\n\nPhilip could not answer--did not hear. His soul had gone out to meet\nSylvia, who entered with quiet slowness quite unlike her former\nself. Her face was wan and white; her gray eyes seemed larger, and\nfull of dumb tearless sorrow; she came up to Philip, as if his being\nthere touched her with no surprise, and gave him a gentle greeting\nas if he were a familiar indifferent person whom she had seen but\nyesterday. Philip, who had recollected the quarrel they had had, and\nabout Kinraid too, the very last time they had met, had expected\nsome trace of this remembrance to linger in her looks and speech to\nhim. But there was no such sign; her great sorrow had wiped away all\nanger, almost all memory. Her mother looked at her anxiously, and\nthen said in the same manner of forced cheerfulness which she had\nused before,--\n\n'Here's Philip, lass, a' full o' Lunnon; call thy father in, an\nwe'll hear a' about t' new-fangled pleughs. It'll be rare an' nice\na' sitting together again.'\n\nSylvia, silent and docile, went out to the shippen to obey her\nmother's wish. Bell Robson leant forward towards Philip,\nmisinterpreting the expression on his face, which was guilt as much\nas sympathy, and checked the possible repentance which might have\nurged him on at that moment to tell all he knew, by saying, 'Lad!\nit's a' for t' best. He were noane good enough for her; and I\nmisdoubt me he were only playin' wi' her as he'd done by others. Let\nher a-be, let her a-be; she'll come round to be thankful.'\n\nRobson bustled in with loud welcome; all the louder and more\ntalkative because he, like his wife, assumed a cheerful manner\nbefore Sylvia. Yet he, unlike his wife, had many a secret regret\nover Kinraid's fate. At first, while merely the fact of his\ndisappearance was known, Daniel Robson had hit on the truth, and had\nstuck to his opinion that the cursed press-gang were at the bottom\nof it. He had backed his words by many an oath, and all the more\nbecause he had not a single reason to give that applied to the\npresent occasion. No one on the lonely coast had remarked any sign\nof the presence of the men-of-war, or the tenders that accompanied\nthem, for the purpose of impressment on the king's ships. At\nShields, and at the mouth of the Tyne, where they lay in greedy\nwait, the owners of the _Urania_ had caused strict search to be made\nfor their skilled and protected specksioneer, but with no success.\nAll this positive evidence in contradiction to Daniel Robson's\nopinion only made him cling to it the more; until the day when the\nhat was found on the shore with Kinraid's name written out large and\nfair in the inside, and the tell-tale bit of ribbon knotted in the\nband. Then Daniel, by a sudden revulsion, gave up every hope; it\nnever entered his mind that it could have fallen off by any\naccident. No! now Kinraid was dead and drowned, and it was a bad\njob, and the sooner it could be forgotten the better for all\nparties; and it was well no one knew how far it had gone with\nSylvia, especially now since Bessy Corney was crying her eyes out as\nif he had been engaged to her. So Daniel said nothing to his wife\nabout the mischief that had gone on in her absence, and never spoke\nto Sylvia about the affair; only he was more than usually tender to\nher in his rough way, and thought, morning, noon, and night, on what\nhe could do to give her pleasure, and drive away all recollection of\nher ill-starred love.\n\nTo-night he would have her sit by him while Philip told his stories,\nor heavily answered questions put to him. Sylvia sat on a stool by\nher father's knee, holding one of his hands in both of hers; and\npresently she laid down her head upon them, and Philip saw her sad\neyes looking into the flickering fire-light with long unwinking\nstare, showing that her thoughts were far distant. He could hardly\ngo on with his tales of what he had seen, and what done, he was so\nfull of pity for her. Yet, for all his pity, he had now resolved\nnever to soothe her with the knowledge of what he knew, nor to\ndeliver the message sent by her false lover. He felt like a mother\nwithholding something injurious from the foolish wish of her\nplaining child.\n\nBut he went away without breathing a word of his good fortune in\nbusiness. The telling of such kind of good fortune seemed out of\nplace this night, when the thought of death and the loss of friends\nseemed to brood over the household, and cast its shadow there,\nobscuring for the time all worldly things.\n\nAnd so the great piece of news came out in the ordinary course of\ngossip, told by some Monkshaven friend to Robson the next market\nday. For months Philip had been looking forward to the sensation\nwhich the intelligence would produce in the farm household, as a\npreliminary to laying his good fortune at Sylvia's feet. And they\nheard of it, and he away, and all chance of his making use of it in\nthe manner he had intended vanished for the present.\n\nDaniel was always curious after other people's affairs, and now was\nmore than ever bent on collecting scraps of news which might\npossibly interest Sylvia, and rouse her out of the state of\nindifference as to everything into which she had fallen. Perhaps he\nthought that he had not acted altogether wisely in allowing her to\nengage herself to Kinraid, for he was a man apt to judge by results;\nand moreover he had had so much reason to repent of the\nencouragement which he had given to the lover whose untimely end had\nso deeply affected his only child, that he was more unwilling than\never that his wife should know of the length to which the affair had\ngone during her absence. He even urged secrecy upon Sylvia as a\npersonal favour; unwilling to encounter the silent blame which he\nopenly affected to despise.\n\n'We'll noane fret thy mother by lettin' on how oft he came and went.\nShe'll, may-be, be thinkin' he were for speakin' to thee, my poor\nlass; an' it would put her out a deal, for she's a woman of a stern\nmind towards matteremony. And she'll be noane so strong till\nsummer-weather comes, and I'd be loath to give her aught to worrit\nhersel' about. So thee and me 'll keep our own counsel.'\n\n'I wish mother had been here, then she'd ha' known all, without my\ntelling her.'\n\n'Cheer up, lass; it's better as it is. Thou'll get o'er it sooner\nfor havin' no one to let on to. A myself am noane going to speak\non't again.'\n\nNo more he did; but there was a strange tenderness in his tones when\nhe spoke to her; a half-pathetic way of seeking after her, if by any\nchance she was absent for a minute from the places where he expected\nto find her; a consideration for her, about this time, in his way of\nbringing back trifling presents, or small pieces of news that he\nthought might interest her, which sank deep into her heart.\n\n'And what dun yo' think a' t' folks is talkin' on i' Monkshaven?'\nasked he, almost before he had taken off his coat, on the day when\nhe had heard of Philip's promotion in the world. 'Why, missus, thy\nnephew, Philip Hepburn, has got his name up i' gold letters four\ninch long o'er Fosters' door! Him and Coulson has set up shop\ntogether, and Fosters is gone out!'\n\n'That's t' secret of his journey t' Lunnon,' said Bell, more\ngratified than she chose to show.\n\n'Four inch long if they're theere at all! I heerd on it at t' Bay\nHorse first; but I thought yo'd niver be satisfied 'bout I seed it\nwi' my own eyes. They do say as Gregory Jones, t' plumber, got it\ndone i' York, for that nought else would satisfy old Jeremiah. It'll\nbe a matter o' some hundreds a year i' Philip's pocket.'\n\n'There'll be Fosters i' th' background, as one may say, to take t'\nbiggest share on t' profits,' said Bell.\n\n'Ay, ay, that's but as it should be, for I reckon they'll ha' to\nfind t' brass the first, my lass!' said he, turning to Sylvia. 'A'm\nfain to tak' thee in to t' town next market-day, just for thee t'\nsee 't. A'll buy thee a bonny ribbon for thy hair out o' t' cousin's\nown shop.'\n\nSome thought of another ribbon which had once tied up her hair, and\nafterwards been cut in twain, must have crossed Sylvia's mind, for\nshe answered, as if she shrank from her father's words,--\n\n'I cannot go, I'm noane wantin' a ribbon; I'm much obliged, father,\na' t' same.'\n\nHer mother read her heart clearly, and suffered with her, but never\nspoke a word of sympathy. But she went on rather more quickly than\nshe would otherwise have done to question her husband as to all he\nknew about this great rise of Philip's. Once or twice Sylvia joined\nin with languid curiosity; but presently she became tired and went\nto bed. For a few moments after she left, her parents sate silent.\nThen Daniel, in a tone as if he were justifying his daughter, and\ncomforting himself as well as his wife, observed that it was almost\non for nine; the evenings were light so long now. Bell said nothing\nin reply, but gathered up her wool, and began to arrange the things\nfor night.\n\nBy-and-by Daniel broke the silence by saying,--\n\n'A thowt at one time as Philip had a fancy for our Sylvie.'\n\nFor a minute or two Bell did not speak. Then, with deeper insight\ninto her daughter's heart than her husband, in spite of his greater\nknowledge of the events that had happened to affect it, she said,--\n\n'If thou's thinking on a match between 'em, it 'll be a long time\nafore th' poor sad wench is fit t' think on another man as\nsweetheart.'\n\n'A said nought about sweethearts,' replied he, as if his wife had\nreproached him in some way. 'Woman's allays so full o' sweethearts\nand matteremony. A only said as a'd thowt once as Philip had a fancy\nfor our lass, and a think so still; and he'll be worth his two\nhunder a year afore long. But a niver said nought about\nsweethearts.'\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI\n\nA REJECTED SUITOR\n\n\nThere were many domestic arrangements to be made in connection with\nthe new commercial ones which affected Hepburn and Coulson.\n\nThe Fosters, with something of the busybodiness which is apt to\nmingle itself with kindly patronage, had planned in their own minds\nthat the Rose household should be removed altogether to the house\nbelonging to the shop; and that Alice, with the assistance of the\ncapable servant, who, at present, managed all John's domestic\naffairs, should continue as mistress of the house, with Philip and\nCoulson for her lodgers.\n\nBut arrangements without her consent did not suit Alice at any time,\nand she had very good reasons for declining to accede to this. She\nwas not going to be uprooted at her time of life, she said, nor\nwould she consent to enter upon a future which might be so\nuncertain. Why, Hepburn and Coulson were both young men, she said,\nand they were as likely to marry as not; and then the bride would be\nsure to wish to live in the good old-fashioned house at the back of\nthe shop.\n\nIt was in vain she was told by every one concerned, that, in case of\nsuch an event, the first married partner should take a house of his\nown, leaving her in undisputed possession. She replied, with\napparent truth, that both might wish to marry, and surely the wife\nof one ought to take possession of the house belonging to the\nbusiness; that she was not going to trust herself to the fancies of\nyoung men, who were always, the best of them, going and doing the\nvery thing that was most foolish in the way of marriage; of which\nstate, in fact, she spoke with something of acrimonious contempt and\ndislike, as if young people always got mismatched, yet had not the\nsense to let older and wiser people choose for them.\n\n'Thou'll not have been understanding why Alice Rose spoke as she did\nthis morning,' said Jeremiah Foster to Philip, on the afternoon\nsucceeding the final discussion of this plan. 'She was a-thinking of\nher youth, I reckon, when she was a well-favoured young woman, and\nour John was full of the thought of marrying her. As he could not\nhave her, he has lived a bachelor all his days. But if I am not a\nvast mistaken, all that he has will go to her and to Hester, for all\nthat Hester is the child of another man. Thee and Coulson should\nhave a try for Hester, Philip. I have told Coulson this day of\nHester's chances. I told him first because he is my wife's nephew;\nbut I tell thee now, Philip. It would be a good thing for the shop\nif one of ye was married.'\n\nPhilip reddened. Often as the idea of marriage had come into his\nmind, this was the first time it had been gravely suggested to him\nby another. But he replied quietly enough.\n\n'I don't think Hester Rose has any thought of matrimony.'\n\n'To be sure not; it is for thee, or for William Coulson, to make her\nthink. She, may-be, remembers enough of her mother's life with her\nfather to make her slow to think on such things. But it's in her to\nthink on matrimony; it's in all of us.'\n\n'Alice's husband was dead before I knew her,' said Philip, rather\nevading the main subject.\n\n'It was a mercy when he were taken. A mercy to them who were left, I\nmean. Alice was a bonny young woman, with a smile for everybody,\nwhen he wed her--a smile for every one except our John, who never\ncould do enough to try and win one from her. But, no! she would have\nnone of him, but set her heart on Jack Rose, a sailor in a\nwhale-ship. And so they were married at last, though all her own\nfolks were against it. And he was a profligate sinner, and went\nafter other women, and drank, and beat her. She turned as stiff and\nas grey as thou seest her now within a year of Hester's birth. I\nbelieve they'd have perished for want and cold many a time if it had\nnot been for John. If she ever guessed where the money came from, it\nmust have hurt her pride above a bit, for she was always a proud\nwoman. But mother's love is stronger than pride.'\n\nPhilip fell to thinking; a generation ago something of the same kind\nhad been going on as that which he was now living through, quick\nwith hopes and fears. A girl beloved by two--nay, those two so\nidentical in occupation as he and Kinraid were--Rose identical even\nin character with what he knew of the specksioneer; a girl choosing\nthe wrong lover, and suffering and soured all her life in\nconsequence of her youth's mistake; was that to be Sylvia's\nlot?--or, rather, was she not saved from it by the event of the\nimpressment, and by the course of silence he himself had resolved\nupon? Then he went on to wonder if the lives of one generation were\nbut a repetition of the lives of those who had gone before, with no\nvariation but from the internal cause that some had greater capacity\nfor suffering than others. Would those very circumstances which made\nthe interest of his life now, return, in due cycle, when he was dead\nand Sylvia was forgotten?\n\nPerplexed thoughts of this and a similar kind kept returning into\nPhilip's mind whenever he had leisure to give himself up to\nconsideration of anything but the immediate throng of business. And\nevery time he dwelt on this complication and succession of similar\nevents, he emerged from his reverie more and more satisfied with the\ncourse he had taken in withholding from Sylvia all knowledge of her\nlover's fate.\n\nIt was settled at length that Philip was to remove to the house\nbelonging to the shop, Coulson remaining with Alice and her\ndaughter. But in the course of the summer the latter told his\npartner that he had offered marriage to Hester on the previous day,\nand been refused. It was an awkward affair altogether, as he lived\nin their house, and was in daily companionship with Hester, who,\nhowever, seemed to preserve her gentle calmness, with only a tinge\nmore of reserve in her manner to Coulson.\n\n'I wish yo' could find out what she has again' me, Philip,' said\nCoulson, about a fortnight after he had made the proposal. The poor\nyoung man thought that Hester's composure of manner towards him\nsince the event argued that he was not distasteful to her; and as he\nwas now on very happy terms with Philip, he came constantly to him,\nas if the latter could interpret the meaning of all the little\noccurrences between him and his beloved. 'I'm o' right age, not two\nmonths betwixt us; and there's few in Monkshaven as would think on\nher wi' better prospects than me; and she knows my folks; we're kind\no' cousins, in fact; and I'd be like a son to her mother; and\nthere's noane i' Monkshaven as can speak again' my character.\nThere's nought between yo' and her, is there, Philip?'\n\n'I ha' telled thee many a time that she and me is like brother and\nsister. She's no more thought on me nor I have for her. So be\ncontent wi't, for I'se not tell thee again.'\n\n'Don't be vexed, Philip; if thou knew what it was to be in love,\nthou'd be always fancying things, just as I am.'\n\n'I might be,' said Philip; 'but I dunnut think I should be always\ntalking about my fancies.'\n\n'I wunnot talk any more after this once, if thou'll just find out\nfra' thysel', as it were, what it is she has again' me. I'd go to\nchapel for iver with her, if that's what she wants. Just ask her,\nPhilip.'\n\n'It's an awkward thing for me to be melling wi',' said Hepburn,\nreluctantly.\n\n'But thou said thee and she were like brother and sister; and a\nbrother would ask a sister, and niver think twice about it.'\n\n'Well, well,' replied Philip, 'I'll see what I can do; but, lad, I\ndunnot think she'll have thee. She doesn't fancy thee, and fancy is\nthree parts o' love, if reason is t' other fourth.'\n\nBut somehow Philip could not begin on the subject with Hester. He\ndid not know why, except that, as he said, 'it was so awkward.' But\nhe really liked Coulson so much as to be anxious to do what the\nlatter wished, although he was almost convinced that it would be of\nno use. So he watched his opportunity, and found Alice alone and at\nleisure one Sunday evening.\n\nShe was sitting by the window, reading her Bible, when he went in.\nShe gave him a curt welcome, hearty enough for her, for she was\nalways chary in her expressions of pleasure or satisfaction. But she\ntook off her horn spectacles and placed them in the book to keep her\nplace; and then turning more fully round on her chair, so as to face\nhim, she said,--\n\n'Well, lad! and how does it go on? Though it's not a day for t' ask\nabout worldly things. But I niver see thee now but on Sabbath day,\nand rarely then. Still we munnot speak o' such things on t' Lord's\nday. So thee mun just say how t' shop is doing, and then we'll leave\nsuch vain talk.'\n\n'T' shop is doing main an' well, thank ye, mother. But Coulson could\ntell yo' o' that any day.'\n\n'I'd a deal rayther hear fra' thee, Philip. Coulson doesn't know how\nt' manage his own business, let alone half the business as it took\nJohn and Jeremiah's heads--ay, and tasked 'em, too--to manage. I've\nno patience with Coulson.'\n\n'Why? he's a decent young fellow as ever there is in Monkshaven.'\n\n'He may be. He's noane cut his wisdom-teeth yet. But, for that\nmatter, there's other folks as far fra' sense as he is.'\n\n'Ay, and farther. Coulson mayn't be so bright at all times as he\nmight be, but he's a steady-goer, and I'd back him again' any chap\no' his age i' Monkshaven.'\n\n'I know who I'd sooner back in many a thing, Philip!' She said it\nwith so much meaning that he could not fail to understand that he\nhimself was meant, and he replied, ingenuously enough,--\n\n'If yo' mean me, mother, I'll noane deny that in a thing or two I\nmay be more knowledgeable than Coulson. I've had a deal o' time on\nmy hands i' my youth, and I'd good schooling as long as father\nlived.'\n\n'Lad! it's not schooling, nor knowledge, nor book-learning as\ncarries a man through t' world. It's mother-wit. And it's noane\nschooling, nor knowledge, nor book-learning as takes a young woman.\nIt's summat as cannot be put into words.'\n\n'That's just what I told Coulson!' said Philip, quickly. 'He were\nsore put about because Hester had gi'en him the bucket, and came to\nme about it.'\n\n'And what did thou say?' asked Alice, her deep eyes gleaming at him\nas if to read his face as well as his words. Philip, thinking he\ncould now do what Coulson had begged of him in the neatest manner,\nwent on,--\n\n'I told him I'd help him all as I could---'\n\n'Thou did, did thou? Well, well, there's nought sa queer as folks,\nthat a will say,' muttered Alice, between her teeth.\n\n'--but that fancy had three parts to do wi' love,' continued Philip,\n'and it would be hard, may-be, to get a reason for her not fancying\nhim. Yet I wish she'd think twice about it; he so set upon having\nher, I think he'll do himself a mischief wi' fretting, if it goes on\nas it is.'\n\n'It'll noane go on as it is,' said Alice, with gloomy oracularness.\n\n'How not?' asked Philip. Then, receiving no answer, he went on, 'He\nloves her true, and he's within a month or two on her age, and his\ncharacter will bear handling on a' sides; and his share on t' shop\nwill be worth hundreds a year afore long.'\n\nAnother pause. Alice was trying to bring down her pride to say\nsomething, which she could not with all her efforts.\n\n'Maybe yo'll speak a word for him, mother,' said Philip, annoyed at\nher silence.\n\n'I'll do no such thing. Marriages are best made wi'out melling. How\ndo I know but what she likes some one better?'\n\n'Our Hester's not th' lass to think on a young man unless he's been\na-wooing on her. And yo' know, mother, as well as I do--and Coulson\ndoes too--she's niver given any one a chance to woo her; living half\nher time here, and t' other half in t' shop, and niver speaking to\nno one by t' way.'\n\n'I wish thou wouldn't come here troubling me on a Sabbath day wi'\nthy vanity and thy worldly talk. I'd liefer by far be i' that world\nwheere there's neither marrying nor giving in marriage, for it's all\na moithering mess here.' She turned to the closed Bible lying on the\ndresser, and opened it with a bang. While she was adjusting her\nspectacles on her nose, with hands trembling with passion, she heard\nPhilip say,--\n\n'I ask yo'r pardon, I'm sure. I couldn't well come any other day.'\n\n'It's a' t' same--I care not. But thou might as well tell truth.\nI'll be bound thou's been at Haytersbank Farm some day this week?'\n\nPhilip reddened; in fact, he had forgotten how he had got to\nconsider his frequent visits to the farm as a regular piece of\noccupation. He kept silence.\n\nAlice looked at him with a sharp intelligence that read his silence\nthrough.\n\n'I thought so. Next time thou thinks to thyself, 'I'm more\nknowledgeable than Coulson,' just remember Alice Rose's words, and\nthey are these:--If Coulson's too thick-sighted to see through a\nboard, thou'rt too blind to see through a window. As for comin' and\nspeakin' up for Coulson, why he'll be married to some one else afore\nt' year's out, for all he thinks he's so set upon Hester now. Go thy\nways, and leave me to my Scripture, and come no more on Sabbath days\nwi' thy vain babbling.'\n\nSo Philip returned from his mission rather crestfallen, but quite as\nfar as ever from 'seeing through a glass window.'\n\nBefore the year was out, Alice's prophecy was fulfilled. Coulson,\nwho found the position of a rejected lover in the same house with\nthe girl who had refused him, too uncomfortable to be endured, as\nsoon as he was convinced that his object was decidedly out of his\nreach, turned his attention to some one else. He did not love his\nnew sweetheart as he had done Hester: there was more of reason and\nless of fancy in his attachment. But it ended successfully; and\nbefore the first snow fell, Philip was best man at his partner's\nwedding.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXII\n\nDEEPENING SHADOWS\n\n\nBut before Coulson was married, many small events happened--small\nevents to all but Philip. To him they were as the sun and moon. The\ndays when he went up to Haytersbank and Sylvia spoke to him, the\ndays when he went up and she had apparently no heart to speak to any\none, but left the room as soon as he came, or never entered it at\nall, although she must have known that he was there--these were his\nalternations from happiness to sorrow.\n\nFrom her parents he always had a welcome. Oppressed by their\ndaughter's depression of spirits, they hailed the coming of any\nvisitor as a change for her as well as for themselves. The former\nintimacy with the Corneys was in abeyance for all parties, owing to\nBessy Corney's out-spoken grief for the loss of her cousin, as if\nshe had had reason to look upon him as her lover, whereas Sylvia's\nparents felt this as a slur upon their daughter's cause of grief.\nBut although at this time the members of the two families ceased to\nseek after each other's society, nothing was said. The thread of\nfriendship might be joined afresh at any time, only just now it was\nbroken; and Philip was glad of it. Before going to Haytersbank he\nsought each time for some little present with which to make his\ncoming welcome. And now he wished even more than ever that Sylvia\nhad cared for learning; if she had he could have taken her many a\npretty ballad, or story-book, such as were then in vogue. He did try\nher with the translation of the _Sorrows of Werther_, so popular at\nthe time that it had a place in all pedlars' baskets, with Law's\n_Serious Call_, the _Pilgrim's Progress_, Klopstock's _Messiah_, and\n_Paradise Lost_. But she could not read it for herself; and after\nturning the leaves languidly over, and smiling a little at the\npicture of Charlotte cutting bread and butter in a left-handed\nmanner, she put it aside on the shelf by the _Complete Farrier_; and\nthere Philip saw it, upside down and untouched, the next time he\ncame to the farm.\n\nMany a time during that summer did he turn to the few verses in\nGenesis in which Jacob's twice seven years' service for Rachel is\nrelated, and try and take fresh heart from the reward which came to\nthe patriarch's constancy at last. After trying books, nosegays,\nsmall presents of pretty articles of dress, such as suited the\nnotions of those days, and finding them all received with the same\nlanguid gratitude, he set himself to endeavour to please her in some\nother way. It was time that he should change his tactics; for the\ngirl was becoming weary of the necessity for thanking him, every\ntime he came, for some little favour or other. She wished he would\nlet her alone and not watch her continually with such sad eyes. Her\nfather and mother hailed her first signs of impatient petulance\ntowards him as a return to the old state of things before Kinraid\nhad come to disturb the tenour of their lives; for even Daniel had\nturned against the specksioneer, irritated by the Corneys' loud\nmoans over the loss of the man to whom their daughter said that she\nwas attached. If Daniel wished for him to be alive again, it was\nmainly that the Corneys might be convinced that his last visit to\nthe neighbourhood of Monkshaven was for the sake of the pale and\nsilent Sylvia, and not for that of Bessy, who complained of\nKinraid's untimely death rather as if by it she had been cheated of\na husband than for any overwhelming personal love towards the\ndeceased.\n\n'If he were after her he were a big black scoundrel, that's what he\nwere; and a wish he were alive again to be hung. But a dunnot\nbelieve it; them Corney lasses were allays a-talkin' an' a-thinking\non sweethearts, and niver a man crossed t' threshold but they tried\nhim on as a husband. An' their mother were no better: Kinraid has\nspoken civil to Bessy as became a lad to a lass, and she makes an\nado over him as if they'd been to church together not a week sin'.'\n\n'I dunnot uphold t' Corneys; but Molly Corney--as is Molly Brunton\nnow--used to speak on this dead man to our Sylvie as if he were her\nsweetheart in old days. Now there's no smoke without fire, and I'm\nthinking it's likely enough he were one of them fellows as is always\nafter some lass or another, and, as often as not, two or three at a\ntime. Now look at Philip, what a different one he is! He's niver\nthought on a woman but our Sylvie, I'll be bound. I wish he wern't\nso old-fashioned and faint-hearted.'\n\n'Ay! and t' shop's doin' a vast o' business, I've heard say. He's a\ndeal better company, too, 'n or he used to be. He'd a way o'\npreaching wi' him as a couldn't abide; but now he tak's his glass,\nan' holds his tongue, leavin' room for wiser men to say their say.'\n\nSuch was a conjugal colloquy about this time. Philip was gaining\nground with Daniel, and that was something towards winning Sylvia's\nheart; for she was unaware of her father's change of feeling towards\nKinraid, and took all his tenderness towards herself as if they were\nmarks of his regard for her lost lover and his sympathy in her loss,\ninstead of which he was rather feeling as if it might be a good\nthing after all that the fickle-hearted sailor was dead and drowned.\nIn fact, Daniel was very like a child in all the parts of his\ncharacter. He was strongly affected by whatever was present, and apt\nto forget the absent. He acted on impulse, and too often had reason\nto be sorry for it; but he hated his sorrow too much to let it teach\nhim wisdom for the future. With all his many faults, however, he had\nsomething in him which made him be dearly loved, both by the\ndaughter whom he indulged, and the wife who was in fact superior to\nhim, but whom he imagined that he ruled with a wise and absolute\nsway.\n\nLove to Sylvia gave Philip tact. He seemed to find out that to\nplease the women of the household he must pay all possible attention\nto the man; and though he cared little in comparison for Daniel, yet\nthis autumn he was continually thinking of how he could please him.\nWhen he had said or done anything to gratify or amuse her father,\nSylvia smiled and was kind. Whatever he did was right with his aunt;\nbut even she was unusually glad when her husband was pleased. Still\nhis progress was slow towards his object; and often he sighed\nhimself to sleep with the words, 'seven years, and maybe seven years\nmore'. Then in his dreams he saw Kinraid again, sometimes\nstruggling, sometimes sailing towards land, the only one on board a\nswift advancing ship, alone on deck, stern and avenging; till Philip\nawoke in remorseful terror.\n\nSuch and similar dreams returned with the greater frequency when, in\nthe November of that year, the coast between Hartlepool and\nMonkshaven was overshadowed by the presence of guard-ships, driven\nsouth from their station at North Shields by the resolution which\nthe sailors of that port had entered into to resist the press-gang,\nand the energy with which they had begun to carry out their\ndetermination. For on a certain Tuesday evening yet remembered by\nold inhabitants of North Shields, the sailors in the merchant\nservice met together and overpowered the press-gang, dismissing them\nfrom the town with the highest contempt, and with their jackets\nreversed. A numerous mob went with them to Chirton Bar; gave them\nthree cheers at parting, but vowed to tear them limb from limb\nshould they seek to re-enter North Shields. But a few days\nafterwards some fresh cause of irritation arose, and five hundred\nsailors, armed with such swords and pistols as they could collect,\nparaded through the town in the most riotous manner, and at last\nattempted to seize the tender Eleanor, on some pretext of the\nill-treatment of the impressed men aboard. This endeavour failed,\nhowever, owing to the energetic conduct of the officers in command.\nNext day this body of sailors set off for Newcastle; but learning,\nbefore they reached the town, that there was a strong military and\ncivil force prepared to receive them there, they dispersed for the\ntime; but not before the good citizens had received a great fright,\nthe drums of the North Yorkshire militia beating to arms, and the\nterrified people rushing out into the streets to learn the reason of\nthe alarm, and some of them seeing the militia, under the command of\nthe Earl of Fauconberg, marching from the guard-house adjoining New\nGate to the house of rendezvous for impressed seamen in the Broad\nChase.\n\nBut a few weeks after, the impressment service took their revenge\nfor the insults they had been subjected to in North Shields. In the\ndead of night a cordon was formed round that town by a regiment\nstationed at Tynemouth barracks; the press-gangs belonging to armed\nvessels lying off Shields harbour were let loose; no one within the\ncircle could escape, and upwards of two hundred and fifty men,\nsailors, mechanics, labourers of every description, were forced on\nboard the armed ships. With that prize they set sail, and wisely\nleft the place, where deep passionate vengeance was sworn against\nthem. Not all the dread of an invasion by the French could reconcile\nthe people of these coasts to the necessity of impressment. Fear and\nconfusion prevailed after this to within many miles of the\nsea-shore. A Yorkshire gentleman of rank said that his labourers\ndispersed like a covey of birds, because a press-gang was reported\nto have established itself so far inland as Tadcaster; and they only\nreturned to work on the assurance from the steward of his master's\nprotection, but even then begged leave to sleep on straw in the\nstables or outhouses belonging to their landlord, not daring to\nsleep at their own homes. No fish was caught, for the fishermen\ndared not venture out to sea; the markets were deserted, as the\npress-gangs might come down on any gathering of men; prices were\nraised, and many were impoverished; many others ruined. For in the\ngreat struggle in which England was then involved, the navy was\nesteemed her safeguard; and men must be had at any price of money,\nor suffering, or of injustice. Landsmen were kidnapped and taken to\nLondon; there, in too many instances, to be discharged without\nredress and penniless, because they were discovered to be useless\nfor the purpose for which they had been taken.\n\nAutumn brought back the whaling-ships. But the period of their\nreturn was full of gloomy anxiety, instead of its being the annual\ntime of rejoicing and feasting; of gladdened households, where brave\nsteady husbands or sons returned; of unlimited and reckless\nexpenditure, and boisterous joviality among those who thought that\nthey had earned unbounded licence on shore by their six months of\ncompelled abstinence. In other years this had been the time for new\nand handsome winter clothing; for cheerful if humble hospitality;\nfor the shopkeepers to display their gayest and best; for the\npublic-houses to be crowded; for the streets to be full of blue\njackets, rolling along with merry words and open hearts. In other\nyears the boiling-houses had been full of active workers, the\nstaithes crowded with barrels, the ship-carpenters' yards thronged\nwith seamen and captains; now a few men, tempted by high wages, went\nstealthily by back lanes to their work, clustering together, with\nsinister looks, glancing round corners, and fearful of every\napproaching footstep, as if they were going on some unlawful\nbusiness, instead of true honest work. Most of them kept their\nwhaling-knives about them ready for bloody defence if they were\nattacked. The shops were almost deserted; there was no unnecessary\nexpenditure by the men; they dared not venture out to buy lavish\npresents for the wife or sweetheart or little children. The\npublic-houses kept scouts on the look-out; while fierce men drank\nand swore deep oaths of vengeance in the bar--men who did not\nmaunder in their cups, nor grow foolishly merry, but in whom liquor\ncalled forth all the desperate, bad passions of human nature.\n\nIndeed, all along the coast of Yorkshire, it seemed as if a blight\nhung over the land and the people. Men dodged about their daily\nbusiness with hatred and suspicion in their eyes, and many a curse\nwent over the sea to the three fatal ships lying motionless at\nanchor three miles off Monkshaven. When first Philip had heard in\nhis shop that these three men-of-war might be seen lying fell and\nstill on the gray horizon, his heart sank, and he scarcely dared to\nask their names. For if one should be the _Alcestis_; if Kinraid\nshould send word to Sylvia; if he should say he was living, and\nloving, and faithful; if it should come to pass that the fact of the\nundelivered message sent by her lover through Philip should reach\nSylvia's ears: what would be the position of the latter, not merely\nin her love--that, of course, would be hopeless--but in her esteem?\nAll sophistry vanished; the fear of detection awakened Philip to a\nsense of guilt; and, besides, he found out, that, in spite of all\nidle talk and careless slander, he could not help believing that\nKinraid was in terrible earnest when he uttered those passionate\nwords, and entreated that they might be borne to Sylvia. Some\ninstinct told Philip that if the specksioneer had only flirted with\ntoo many, yet that for Sylvia Robson his love was true and vehement.\nThen Philip tried to convince himself that, from all that was said\nof his previous character, Kinraid was not capable of an enduring\nconstant attachment; and with such poor opiate to his conscience as\nhe could obtain from this notion Philip was obliged to remain\ncontent, until, a day or two after the first intelligence of the\npresence of those three ships, he learned, with some trouble and\npains, that their names were the _Megoera_, the _Bellerophon_, and\nthe _Hanover_.\n\nThen he began to perceive how unlikely it was that the _Alcestis_\nshould have been lingering on this shore all these many months. She\nwas, doubtless, gone far away by this time; she had, probably,\njoined the fleet on the war station. Who could tell what had become\nof her and her crew? she might have been in battle before now, and\nif so---\n\nSo his previous fancies shrank to nothing, rebuked for their\nimprobability, and with them vanished his self-reproach. Yet there\nwere times when the popular attention seemed totally absorbed by the\ndread of the press-gang; when no other subject was talked about--hardly,\nin fact, thought about. At such flows of panic, Philip had his\nown private fears lest a flash of light should come upon Sylvia,\nand she should suddenly see that Kinraid's absence might be\naccounted for in another way besides death. But when he reasoned,\nthis seemed unlikely. No man-of-war had been seen off the coast, or,\nif seen, had never been spoken about, at the time of Kinraid's\ndisappearance. If he had vanished this winter time, every one would\nhave been convinced that the press-gang had seized upon him. Philip\nhad never heard any one breathe the dreaded name of the _Alcestis_.\nBesides, he went on to think, at the farm they are out of hearing of\nthis one great weary subject of talk. But it was not so, as he\nbecame convinced one evening. His aunt caught him a little aside\nwhile Sylvia was in the dairy, and her husband talking in the\nshippen with Kester.\n\n'For good's sake, Philip, dunnot thee bring us talk about t'\npress-gang. It's a thing as has got hold on my measter, till thou'd\nthink him possessed. He's speaking perpetual on it i' such a way,\nthat thou'd think he were itching to kill 'em a' afore he tasted\nbread again. He really trembles wi' rage and passion; an' a' night\nit's just as bad. He starts up i' his sleep, swearing and cursing at\n'em, till I'm sometimes afeard he'll mak' an end o' me by mistake.\nAnd what mun he do last night but open out on Charley Kinraid, and\ntell Sylvie he thought m'appen t' gang had got hold on him. It might\nmake her cry a' her saut tears o'er again.'\n\nPhilip spoke, by no wish of his own, but as if compelled to speak.\n\n'An' who knows but what it's true?'\n\nThe instant these words had come out of his lips he could have\nbitten his tongue off. And yet afterwards it was a sort of balm to\nhis conscience that he had so spoken.\n\n'What nonsense, Philip!' said his aunt; 'why, these fearsome ships\nwere far out o' sight when he went away, good go wi' him, and Sylvie\njust getting o'er her trouble so nicely, and even my master went on\nfor to say if they'd getten hold on him, he were not a chap to stay\nwi' 'em; he'd gi'en proofs on his hatred to 'em, time on. He either\nha' made off--an' then sure enough we should ha' heerd on him\nsomehow--them Corneys is full on him still and they've a deal to wi'\nhis folk beyond Newcassel--or, as my master says, he were just t'\nchap to hang or drown hissel, sooner nor do aught against his will.'\n\n'What did Sylvie say?' asked Philip, in a hoarse low voice.\n\n'Say? why, a' she could say was to burst out crying, and after a\nbit, she just repeated her feyther's words, and said anyhow he was\ndead, for he'd niver live to go to sea wi' a press-gang. She knowed\nhim too well for that. Thou sees she thinks a deal on him for a\nspirited chap, as can do what he will. I belie' me she first began\nto think on him time o' t' fight aboard th' _Good Fortune_, when\nDarley were killed, and he would seem tame-like to her if he\ncouldn't conquer press-gangs, and men-o'-war. She's sooner think on\nhim drowned, as she's ne'er to see him again.'\n\n'It's best so,' said Philip, and then, to calm his unusually excited\naunt, he promised to avoid the subject of the press-gang as much as\npossible.\n\nBut it was a promise very difficult of performance, for Daniel\nRobson was, as his wife said, like one possessed. He could hardly\nthink of anything else, though he himself was occasionally weary of\nthe same constantly recurring idea, and would fain have banished it\nfrom his mind. He was too old a man to be likely to be taken by\nthem; he had no son to become their victim; but the terror of them,\nwhich he had braved and defied in his youth, seemed to come back and\ntake possession of him in his age; and with the terror came\nimpatient hatred. Since his wife's illness the previous winter he\nhad been a more sober man until now. He was never exactly drunk, for\nhe had a strong, well-seasoned head; but the craving to hear the\nlast news of the actions of the press-gang drew him into Monkshaven\nnearly every day at this dead agricultural season of the year; and a\npublic-house is generally the focus from which gossip radiates; and\nprobably the amount of drink thus consumed weakened Robson's power\nover his mind, and caused the concentration of thought on one\nsubject. This may be a physiological explanation of what afterwards\nwas spoken of as a supernatural kind of possession, leading him to\nhis doom.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIII\n\nRETALIATION\n\n\nThe public-house that had been chosen by the leaders of the\npress-gang in Monkshaven at this time, for their rendezvous (or\n'Randyvowse', as it was generally pronounced), was an inn of poor\nrepute, with a yard at the back which opened on to the staithe or\nquay nearest to the open sea. A strong high stone wall bounded this\ngrass-grown mouldy yard on two sides; the house, and some unused\nout-buildings, formed the other two. The choice of the place was\ngood enough, both as to situation, which was sufficiently isolated,\nand yet near to the widening river; and as to the character of the\nlandlord, John Hobbs was a failing man, one who seemed as if doomed\nto be unfortunate in all his undertakings, and the consequence of\nall this was that he was envious of the more prosperous, and willing\nto do anything that might bring him in a little present success in\nlife. His household consisted of his wife, her niece, who acted as\nservant, and an out-of-doors man, a brother of Ned Simpson, the\nwell-doing butcher, who at one time had had a fancy for Sylvia. But\nthe one brother was prosperous, the other had gone on sinking in\nlife, like him who was now his master. Neither Hobbs nor his man\nSimpson were absolutely bad men; if things had gone well with them\nthey might each have been as scrupulous and conscientious as their\nneighbours, and even now, supposing the gain in money to be equal,\nthey would sooner have done good than evil; but a very small sum was\nenough to turn the balance. And in a greater degree than in most\ncases was the famous maxim of Rochefoucault true with them; for in\nthe misfortunes of their friends they seemed to see some\njustification of their own. It was blind fate dealing out events,\nnot that the events themselves were the inevitable consequences of\nfolly or misconduct. To such men as these the large sum offered by\nthe lieutenant of the press-gang for the accommodation of the\nMariners' Arms was simply and immediately irresistible. The best\nroom in the dilapidated house was put at the service of the\ncommanding officer of the impress service, and all other\narrangements made at his desire, irrespective of all the former\nunprofitable sources of custom and of business. If the relatives\nboth of Hobbs and of Simpson had not been so well known and so\nprosperous in the town, they themselves would have received more\nmarks of popular ill opinion than they did during the winter the\nevents of which are now being recorded. As it was, people spoke to\nthem when they appeared at kirk or at market, but held no\nconversation with them; no, not although they each appeared better\ndressed than they had either of them done for years past, and\nalthough their whole manner showed a change, inasmuch as they had\nbeen formerly snarling and misanthropic, and were now civil almost\nto deprecation.\n\nEvery one who was capable of understanding the state of feeling in\nMonkshaven at this time must have been aware that at any moment an\nexplosion might take place; and probably there were those who had\njudgment enough to be surprised that it did not take place sooner\nthan it did. For until February there were only occasional cries and\ngrowls of rage, as the press-gang made their captures first here,\nthen there; often, apparently, tranquil for days, then heard of at\nsome distance along the coast, then carrying off a seaman from the\nvery heart of the town. They seemed afraid of provoking any general\nhostility, such as that which had driven them from Shields, and\nwould have conciliated the inhabitants if they could; the officers\non the service and on board the three men-of-war coming often into\nthe town, spending largely, talking to all with cheery friendliness,\nand making themselves very popular in such society as they could\nobtain access to at the houses of the neighbouring magistrates or at\nthe rectory. But this, however agreeable, did not forward the object\nthe impress service had in view; and, accordingly, a more decided\nstep was taken at a time when, although there was no apparent\nevidence as to the fact, the town was full of the Greenland mariners\ncoming quietly in to renew their yearly engagements, which, when\ndone, would legally entitle them to protection from impressment. One\nnight--it was on a Saturday, February 23rd, when there was a bitter\nblack frost, with a north-east wind sweeping through the streets,\nand men and women were close shut in their houses--all were startled\nin their household content and warmth by the sound of the fire-bell\nbusily swinging, and pealing out for help. The fire-bell was kept in\nthe market-house where High Street and Bridge Street met: every one\nknew what it meant. Some dwelling, or maybe a boiling-house was on\nfire, and neighbourly assistance was summoned with all speed, in a\ntown where no water was laid on, nor fire-engines kept in readiness.\nMen snatched up their hats, and rushed out, wives following, some\nwith the readiest wraps they could lay hands on, with which to\nclothe the over-hasty husbands, others from that mixture of dread\nand curiosity which draws people to the scene of any disaster. Those\nof the market people who were making the best of their way\nhomewards, having waited in the town till the early darkness\nconcealed their path, turned back at the sound of the ever-clanging\nfire-bell, ringing out faster and faster as if the danger became\nevery instant more pressing.\n\nAs men ran against or alongside of each other, their breathless\nquestion was ever, 'Where is it?' and no one could tell; so they\npressed onwards into the market-place, sure of obtaining the\ninformation desired there, where the fire-bell kept calling out with\nits furious metal tongue.\n\nThe dull oil-lamps in the adjoining streets only made darkness\nvisible in the thronged market-place, where the buzz of many men's\nunanswered questions was rising louder and louder. A strange feeling\nof dread crept over those nearest to the closed market-house. Above\nthem in the air the bell was still clanging; but before them was a\ndoor fast shut and locked; no one to speak and tell them why they\nwere summoned--where they ought to be. They were at the heart of the\nmystery, and it was a silent blank! Their unformed dread took shape\nat the cry from the outside of the crowd, from where men were still\ncoming down the eastern side of Bridge Street. 'The gang! the gang!'\nshrieked out some one. 'The gang are upon us! Help! help!' Then the\nfire-bell had been a decoy; a sort of seething the kid in its\nmother's milk, leading men into a snare through their kindliest\nfeelings. Some dull sense of this added to utter dismay, and made\nthem struggle and strain to get to all the outlets save that in\nwhich a fight was now going on; the swish of heavy whips, the thud\nof bludgeons, the groans, the growls of wounded or infuriated men,\ncoming with terrible distinctness through the darkness to the\nquickened ear of fear.\n\nA breathless group rushed up the blackness of a narrow entry to\nstand still awhile, and recover strength for fresh running. For a\ntime nothing but heavy pants and gasps were heard amongst them. No\none knew his neighbour, and their good feeling, so lately abused and\npreyed upon, made them full of suspicion. The first who spoke was\nrecognized by his voice.\n\n'Is it thee, Daniel Robson?' asked his neighbour, in a low tone.\n\n'Ay! Who else should it be?'\n\n'A dunno.'\n\n'If a am to be any one else, I'd like to be a chap of nobbut eight\nstun. A'm welly done for!'\n\n'It were as bloody a shame as iver I heerd on. Who's to go t' t'\nnext fire, a'd like to know!'\n\n'A tell yo' what, lads,' said Daniel, recovering his breath, but\nspeaking in gasps. 'We were a pack o' cowards to let 'em carry off\nyon chaps as easy as they did, a'm reckoning!'\n\n'A think so, indeed,' said another voice.\n\nDaniel went on--\n\n'We was two hunder, if we was a man; an' t' gang has niver numbered\nabove twelve.'\n\n'But they was armed. A seen t' glitter on their cutlasses,' spoke\nout a fresh voice.\n\n'What then!' replied he who had latest come, and who stood at the\nmouth of the entry. 'A had my whalin' knife wi' me i' my pea-jacket\nas my missus threw at me, and a'd ha' ripped 'em up as soon as\nwinkin', if a could ha' thought what was best to do wi' that d----d\nbell makin' such a din reet above us. A man can but die onest, and\nwe was ready to go int' t' fire for t' save folks' lives, and yet\nwe'd none on us t' wit to see as we might ha' saved yon poor chaps\nas screeched out for help.'\n\n'They'll ha' getten 'em to t' Randyvowse by now,' said some one.\n\n'They cannot tak' 'em aboard till morning; t' tide won't serve,'\nsaid the last speaker but one.\n\nDaniel Robson spoke out the thought that was surging up into the\nbrain of every one there.\n\n'There's a chance for us a'. How many be we?' By dint of touching\neach other the numbers were counted. Seven. 'Seven. But if us seven\nturns out and rouses t' town, there'll be many a score ready to gang\nt' Mariners' Arms, and it'll be easy work reskyin' them chaps as is\npressed. Us seven, each man jack on us, go and seek up his friends,\nand get him as well as he can to t' church steps; then, mebbe,\nthere'll be some theere as'll not be so soft as we was, lettin' them\npoor chaps be carried off from under our noses, just becase our ears\nwas busy listenin' to yon confounded bell, whose clip-clappin'\ntongue a'll tear out afore this week is out.'\n\nBefore Daniel had finished speaking, those nearest to the entrance\nmuttered their assent to his project, and had stolen off, keeping to\nthe darkest side of the streets and lanes, which they threaded in\ndifferent directions; most of them going straight as sleuth-hounds\nto the haunts of the wildest and most desperate portion of the\nseafaring population of Monkshaven. For, in the breasts of many,\nrevenge for the misery and alarm of the past winter took a deeper\nand more ferocious form than Daniel had thought of when he made his\nproposal of a rescue. To him it was an adventure like many he had\nbeen engaged in in his younger days; indeed, the liquor he had drunk\nhad given him a fictitious youth for the time; and it was more in\nthe light of a rough frolic of which he was to be the leader, that\nhe limped along ( always lame from old attacks of rheumatism),\nchuckling to himself at the apparent stillness of the town, which\ngave no warning to the press-gang at the Rendezvous of anything in\nthe wind. Daniel, too, had his friends to summon; old hands like\nhimself, but 'deep uns', also, like himself, as he imagined.\n\nIt was nine o'clock when all who were summoned met at the church\nsteps; and by nine o'clock, Monkshaven, in those days, was more\nquiet and asleep than many a town at present is at midnight. The\nchurch and churchyard above them were flooded with silver light, for\nthe moon was high in the heavens: the irregular steps were here and\nthere in pure white clearness, here and there in blackest shadow.\nBut more than half way up to the top, men clustered like bees; all\npressing so as to be near enough to question those who stood nearest\nto the planning of the attack. Here and there, a woman, with wild\ngestures and shrill voice, that no entreaty would hush down to the\nwhispered pitch of the men, pushed her way through the crowd--this\none imploring immediate action, that adjuring those around her to\nsmite and spare not those who had carried off her 'man',--the\nfather, the breadwinner. Low down in the darkened silent town were\nmany whose hearts went with the angry and excited crowd, and who\nwould bless them and caress them for that night's deeds. Daniel soon\nfound himself a laggard in planning, compared to some of those\naround him. But when, with the rushing sound of many steps and but\nfew words, they had arrived at the blank, dark, shut-up Mariners'\nArms, they paused in surprise at the uninhabited look of the whole\nhouse: it was Daniel once more who took the lead.\n\n'Speak 'em fair,' said he; 'try good words first. Hobbs 'll mebbe\nlet 'em out quiet, if we can catch a word wi' him. A say, Hobbs,'\nsaid he, raising his voice, 'is a' shut up for t' neet; for a'd be\nglad of a glass. A'm Dannel Robson, thou knows.'\n\nNot one word in reply, any more than from the tomb; but his speech\nhad been heard nevertheless. The crowd behind him began to jeer and\nto threaten; there was no longer any keeping down their voices,\ntheir rage, their terrible oaths. If doors and windows had not of\nlate been strengthened with bars of iron in anticipation of some\nsuch occasion, they would have been broken in with the onset of the\nfierce and now yelling crowd who rushed against them with the force\nof a battering-ram, to recoil in baffled rage from the vain assault.\nNo sign, no sound from within, in that breathless pause.\n\n'Come away round here! a've found a way to t' back o' behint, where\nbelike it's not so well fenced,' said Daniel, who had made way for\nyounger and more powerful men to conduct the assault, and had\nemployed his time meanwhile in examining the back premises. The men\nrushed after him, almost knocking him down, as he made his way into\nthe lane into which the doors of the outbuildings belonging to the\ninn opened. Daniel had already broken the fastening of that which\nopened into a damp, mouldy-smelling shippen, in one corner of which\na poor lean cow shifted herself on her legs, in an uneasy, restless\nmanner, as her sleeping-place was invaded by as many men as could\ncram themselves into the dark hold. Daniel, at the end farthest from\nthe door, was almost smothered before he could break down the rotten\nwooden shutter, that, when opened, displayed the weedy yard of the\nold inn, the full clear light defining the outline of each blade of\ngrass by the delicate black shadow behind.\n\nThis hole, used to give air and light to what had once been a\nstable, in the days when horse travellers were in the habit of\ncoming to the Mariners' Arms, was large enough to admit the passage\nof a man; and Daniel, in virtue of its discovery, was the first to\nget through. But he was larger and heavier than he had been; his\nlameness made him less agile, and the impatient crowd behind him\ngave him a helping push that sent him down on the round stones with\nwhich the yard was paved, and for the time disabled him so much that\nhe could only just crawl out of the way of leaping feet and heavy\nnailed boots, which came through the opening till the yard was\nfilled with men, who now set up a fierce, derisive shout, which, to\ntheir delight, was answered from within. No more silence, no more\ndead opposition: a living struggle, a glowing, raging fight; and\nDaniel thought he should be obliged to sit there still, leaning\nagainst the wall, inactive, while the strife and the action were\ngoing on in which he had once been foremost.\n\nHe saw the stones torn up; he saw them used with good effect on the\nunguarded back-door; he cried out in useless warning as he saw the\nupper windows open, and aim taken among the crowd; but just then the\ndoor gave way, and there was an involuntary forward motion in the\nthrong, so that no one was so disabled by the shots as to prevent\nhis forcing his way in with the rest. And now the sounds came veiled\nby the walls as of some raging ravening beast growling over his\nprey; the noise came and went--once utterly ceased; and Daniel\nraised himself with difficulty to ascertain the cause, when again\nthe roar came clear and fresh, and men poured into the yard again,\nshouting and rejoicing over the rescued victims of the press-gang.\nDaniel hobbled up, and shouted, and rejoiced, and shook hands with\nthe rest, hardly caring to understand that the lieutenant and his\ngang had quitted the house by a front window, and that all had\npoured out in search of them; the greater part, however, returning\nto liberate the prisoners, and then glut their vengeance on the\nhouse and its contents.\n\nFrom all the windows, upper and lower, furniture was now being\nthrown into the yard. The smash of glass, the heavier crash of wood,\nthe cries, the laughter, the oaths, all excited Daniel to the\nutmost; and, forgetting his bruises, he pressed forwards to lend a\nhelping hand. The wild, rough success of his scheme almost turned\nhis head. He hurraed at every flagrant piece of destruction; he\nshook hands with every one around him, and, at last, when the\ndestroyers inside paused to take breath, he cried out,--\n\n'If a was as young as onest a was, a'd have t' Randyvowse down, and\nmak' a bonfire on it. We'd ring t' fire-bell then t' some purpose.'\n\nNo sooner said than done. Their excitement was ready to take the\nslightest hint of mischief; old chairs, broken tables, odd drawers,\nsmashed chests, were rapidly and skilfully heaped into a pyramid,\nand one, who at the first broaching of the idea had gone for live\ncoals the speedier to light up the fire, came now through the crowd\nwith a large shovelful of red-hot cinders. The rioters stopped to\ntake breath and look on like children at the uncertain flickering\nblaze, which sprang high one moment, and dropped down the next only\nto creep along the base of the heap of wreck, and make secure of its\nfuture work. Then the lurid blaze darted up wild, high, and\nirrepressible; and the men around gave a cry of fierce exultation,\nand in rough mirth began to try and push each other in. In one of\nthe pauses of the rushing, roaring noise of the flames, the moaning\nlow and groan of the poor alarmed cow fastened up in the shippen\ncaught Daniel's ear, and he understood her groans as well as if they\nhad been words. He limped out of the yard through the now deserted\nhouse, where men were busy at the mad work of destruction, and found\nhis way back to the lane into which the shippen opened. The cow was\ndancing about at the roar, and dazzle, and heat of the fire; but\nDaniel knew how to soothe her, and in a few minutes he had a rope\nround her neck, and led her gently out from the scene of her alarm.\nHe was still in the lane when Simpson, the man-of-all-work at the\nMariners' Arms, crept out of some hiding-place in the deserted\noutbuilding, and stood suddenly face to face with Robson.\n\nThe man was white with fear and rage.\n\n'Here, tak' thy beast, and lead her wheere she'll noane hear yon\ncries and shouts. She's fairly moithered wi' heat an' noise.'\n\n'They're brennin' ivery rag I have i' t' world,' gasped out Simpson:\n'I niver had much, and now I'm a beggar.'\n\n'Well! thou shouldn't ha' turned again' thine own town-folks, and\nharboured t' gang. Sarves thee reet. A'd noane be here leadin'\nbeasts if a were as young as a were; a'd be in t' thick on it.'\n\n'It was thee set 'm on--a heerd thee--a see'd thee a helping on 'em\nt' break in; they'd niver ha' thought on attackin' t' house, and\nsettin' fire to yon things, if thou hadn't spoken on it.' Simpson\nwas now fairly crying. But Daniel did not realize what the loss of\nall the small property he had in the world was to the poor fellow\n(rapscallion though he was, broken down, unprosperous\nne'er-do-weel!) in his pride at the good work he believed he had set\non foot.\n\n'Ay,' said he; 'it's a great thing for folk to have a chap for t'\nlead 'em wi' a head on his shouthers. A misdoubt me if there were a\nfelly theere as would ha' thought o' routling out yon wasps' nest;\nit tak's a deal o' mother-wit to be up to things. But t' gang'll\nniver harbour theere again, one while. A only wish we'd cotched 'em.\nAn' a should like t' ha' gi'en Hobbs a bit o' my mind.'\n\n'He's had his sauce,' said Simpson, dolefully. 'Him and me is\nruined.'\n\n'Tut, tut, thou's got thy brother, he's rich enough. And Hobbs 'll\ndo a deal better; he's had his lesson now, and he'll stick to his\nown side time to come. Here, tak' thy beast an' look after her, for\nmy bones is achin'. An' mak' thysel' scarce, for some o' them fellys\nhas getten their blood up, an' wunnot be for treating thee o'er well\nif they fall in wi' thee.'\n\n'Hobbs ought to be served out; it were him as made t' bargain wi'\nlieutenant; and he's off safe wi' his wife and his money bag, and\na'm left a beggar this neet i' Monkshaven street. My brother and me\nhas had words, and he'll do nought for me but curse me. A had three\ncrown-pieces, and a good pair o' breeches, and a shirt, and a dare\nsay better nor two pair o' stockings. A wish t' gang, and thee, and\nHobbs and them mad folk up yonder, were a' down i' hell, a do.'\n\n'Coom, lad,' said Daniel, noways offended at his companion's wish on\nhis behalf. 'A'm noane flush mysel', but here's half-a-crown and\ntuppence; it's a' a've getten wi' me, but it'll keep thee and t'\nbeast i' food and shelter to-neet, and get thee a glass o' comfort,\ntoo. A had thought o' takin' one mysel', but a shannot ha' a penny\nleft, so a'll just toddle whoam to my missus.'\n\nDaniel was not in the habit of feeling any emotion at actions not\ndirectly affecting himself; or else he might have despised the poor\nwretch who immediately clutched at the money, and overwhelmed that\nman with slobbery thanks whom he had not a minute before been\ncursing. But all Simpson's stronger passions had been long ago used\nup; now he only faintly liked and disliked, where once he loved and\nhated; his only vehement feeling was for himself; that cared for,\nother men might wither or flourish as best suited them.\n\nMany of the doors which had been close shut when the crowd went down\nthe High Street, were partially open as Daniel slowly returned; and\nlight streamed from them on the otherwise dark road. The news of the\nsuccessful attempt at rescue had reached those who had sate in\nmourning and in desolation an hour or two ago, and several of these\npressed forwards as from their watching corner they recognized\nDaniel's approach; they pressed forward into the street to shake him\nby the hand, to thank him (for his name had been bruited abroad as\none of those who had planned the affair), and at several places he\nwas urged to have a dram--urgency that he was loath for many reasons\nto refuse, but his increasing uneasiness and pain made him for once\nabstinent, and only anxious to get home and rest. But he could not\nhelp being both touched and flattered at the way in which those who\nformed his 'world' looked upon him as a hero; and was not\ninsensible to the words of blessing which a wife, whose husband had\nbeen impressed and rescued this night, poured down upon him as he\npassed.\n\n'Theere, theere,--dunnot crack thy throat wi' blessin'. Thy man\nwould ha' done as much for me, though mebbe he mightn't ha' shown so\nmuch gumption and capability; but them's gifts, and not to be proud\non.'\n\nWhen Daniel reached the top of the hill on the road home, he turned\nto look round; but he was lame and bruised, he had gone along\nslowly, the fire had pretty nearly died out, only a red hue in the\nair about the houses at the end of the long High Street, and a hot\nlurid mist against the hill-side beyond where the Mariners' Arms had\nstood, were still left as signs and token of the deed of violence.\n\nDaniel looked and chuckled. 'That comes o' ringin' t' fire-bell,'\nsaid he to himself; 'it were shame for it to be tellin' a lie, poor\noud story-teller.'\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIV\n\nBRIEF REJOICING\n\n\nDaniel's unusually late absence from home disturbed Bell and Sylvia\nnot a little. He was generally at home between eight and nine on\nmarket days. They expected to see him the worse for liquor at such\ntimes; but this did not shock them; he was no worse than most of his\nneighbours, indeed better than several, who went off once or twice a\nyear, or even oftener, on drinking bouts of two or three days'\nduration, returning pale, sodden, and somewhat shame-faced, when all\ntheir money was gone; and, after the conjugal reception was well\nover, settling down into hard-working and decently sober men until\nthe temptation again got power over them. But, on market days, every\nman drank more than usual; every bargain or agreement was ratified\nby drink; they came from greater or less distances, either afoot or\non horseback, and the 'good accommodation for man and beast' (as the\nold inn-signs expressed it) always included a considerable amount of\nliquor to be drunk by the man.\n\nDaniel's way of announcing his intention of drinking more than\nordinary was always the same. He would say at the last moment,\n'Missus, I've a mind to get fuddled to-neet,' and be off,\ndisregarding her look of remonstrance, and little heeding the\ninjunctions she would call after him to beware of such and such\ncompanions, or to attend to his footsteps on his road home.\n\nBut this night he had given no such warning. Bell and Sylvia put the\ncandle on the low window-seat at the usual hour to guide him through\nthe fields--it was a habit kept up even on moonlight nights like\nthis--and sate on each side of the fire, at first scarcely caring to\nlisten, so secure were they of his return. Bell dozed, and Sylvia\nsate gazing at the fire with abstracted eyes, thinking of the past\nyear and of the anniversary which was approaching of the day when\nshe had last seen the lover whom she believed to be dead, lying\nsomewhere fathoms deep beneath the surface of that sunny sea on\nwhich she looked day by day without ever seeing his upturned face\nthrough the depths, with whatsoever heart-sick longing for just one\nmore sight she yearned and inwardly cried. If she could set her eyes\non his bright, handsome face, that face which was fading from her\nmemory, overtasked in the too frequent efforts to recall it; if she\ncould but see him once again, coming over the waters beneath which\nhe lay with supernatural motion, awaiting her at the stile, with the\nevening sun shining ruddy into his bonny eyes, even though, after\nthat one instant of vivid and visible life, he faded into mist; if\nshe could but see him now, sitting in the faintly flickering\nfire-light in the old, happy, careless way, on a corner of the\ndresser, his legs dangling, his busy fingers playing with some of\nher woman's work;--she wrung her hands tight together as she\nimplored some, any Power, to let her see him just once again--just\nonce--for one minute of passionate delight. Never again would she\nforget that dear face, if but once more she might set her eyes upon\nit.\n\nHer mother's head fell with a sudden jerk, and she roused herself\nup; and Sylvia put by her thought of the dead, and her craving after\nhis presence, into that receptacle of her heart where all such are\nkept closed and sacred from the light of common day.\n\n'Feyther's late,' said Bell.\n\n'It's gone eight,' replied Sylvia.\n\n'But our clock is better nor an hour forrard,' answered Bell.\n\n'Ay, but t' wind brings Monkshaven bells clear to-night. I heerd t'\neight o'clock bell ringing not five minutes ago.'\n\nIt was the fire-bell, but she had not distinguished the sound.\n\nThere was another long silence; both wide awake this time.\n\n'He'll have his rheumatics again,' said Bell.\n\n'It's cold for sartin,' said Sylvia. 'March weather come afore its\ntime. But I'll make him a treacle-posset, it's a famous thing for\nkeeping off hoasts.'\n\nThe treacle-posset was entertainment enough for both while it was\nbeing made. But once placed in a little basin in the oven, there was\nagain time for wonder and anxiety.\n\n'He said nought about having a bout, did he, mother?' asked Sylvia\nat length.\n\n'No,' said Bell, her face a little contracting. After a while she\nadded, 'There's many a one as has husbands that goes off drinking\nwithout iver saying a word to their wives. My master is none o' that\nmak'.'\n\n'Mother,' broke in Sylvia again, 'I'll just go and get t' lantern\nout of t' shippen, and go up t' brow, and mebbe to t' ash-field\nend.'\n\n'Do, lass,' said her mother. 'I'll get my wraps and go with thee.'\n\n'Thou shall do niver such a thing,' said Sylvia. 'Thou's too frail\nto go out i' t' night air such a night as this.'\n\n'Then call Kester up.'\n\n'Not I. I'm noane afraid o' t' dark.'\n\n'But of what thou mayst meet i' t' dark, lass?'\n\nSylvia shivered all over at the sudden thought, suggested by this\nspeech of her mother's, that the idea that had flashed into her own\nmind of going to look for her father might be an answer to the\ninvocation to the Powers which she had made not long ago, that she\nmight indeed meet her dead lover at the ash-field stile; but though\nshe shivered as this superstitious fancy came into her head, her\nheart beat firm and regular; not from darkness nor from the spirits\nof the dead was she going to shrink; her great sorrow had taken away\nall her girlish nervous fear.\n\nShe went; and she came back. Neither man nor spirit had she seen;\nthe wind was blowing on the height enough to sweep all creatures\nbefore it; but no one was coming.\n\nSo they sate down again to keep watch. At length his step was heard\nclose to the door; and it startled them even in their state of\nexpectation.\n\n'Why, feyther!' cried Sylvia as he entered; while his wife stood up\ntrembling, but not saying a word.\n\n'A'm a'most done up,' said he, sitting heavily down on the chair\nnearest the door.\n\n'Poor old feyther!' said Sylvia, stooping to take off his heavy\nclogged shoes; while Bell took the posset out of the oven.\n\n'What's this? posset? what creatures women is for slops,' said he;\nbut he drank it all the same, while Sylvia fastened the door, and\nbrought the flaring candle from the window-seat. The fresh\narrangement of light displayed his face blackened with smoke, and\nhis clothes disarranged and torn.\n\n'Who's been melling wi' thee?' asked Bell.\n\n'No one has melled wi' me; but a've been mellin' wi' t' gang at\nlast.'\n\n'Thee: they niver were for pressing thee!' exclaimed both the women\nat once.\n\n'No! they knowed better. They'n getten their belly-full as it is.\nNext time they try it on, a reckon they'll ax if Daniel Robson is\nwi'in hearin'. A've led a resky this neet, and saved nine or ten\nhonest chaps as was pressed, and carried off to t' Randyvowse. Me\nand some others did it. And Hobbs' things and t' lieutenant's is a'\nburnt; and by this time a reckon t' Randyvowse is pretty nigh four\nwalls, ready for a parish-pound.'\n\n'Thou'rt niver for saying thou burnt it down wi' t' gang in it, for\nsure?' asked Bell.\n\n'Na, na, not this time. T' 'gang fled up t' hill like coneys; and\nHobbs and his folks carried off a bag o' money; but t' oud\ntumbledown place is just a heap o' brick and mortar; an' t'\nfurniture is smoulderin' int' ashes; and, best of a', t' men is\nfree, and will niver be cotched wi' a fire-bell again.'\n\nAnd so he went on to tell of the ruse by which they had been enticed\ninto the market-place; interrupted from time to time by their eager\nquestions, and interrupting himself every now and then with\nexclamations of weariness and pain, which made him at last say,--\n\n'Now a'm willing to tell yo' a' about it to-morrow, for it's not\nivery day a man can do such great things; but to-neet a mun go to\nbed, even if King George were wantin' for to know how a managed it\na'.'\n\nHe went wearily upstairs, and wife and daughter both strove their\nbest to ease his aching limbs, and make him comfortable. The\nwarming-pan, only used on state occasions, was taken down and\nunpapered for his service; and as he got between the warm sheets, he\nthanked Sylvia and her mother in a sleepy voice, adding,--\n\n'It's a vast o' comfort to think on yon poor lads as is sleepin' i'\ntheir own homes this neet,' and then slumber fell upon him, and he\nwas hardly roused by Bell's softly kissing his weather-beaten cheek,\nand saying low,--\n\n'God bless thee, my man! Thou was allays for them that was down and\nput upon.'\n\nHe murmured some monosyllabic reply, unheard by his wife, who stole\naway to undress herself noiselessly, and laid herself down on her\nside of the bed as gently as her stiffened limbs would permit.\n\nThey were late in rising the next morning. Kester was long since up\nand at his work among the cattle before he saw the house-door open\nto admit the fresh chill morning air; and even then Sylvia brushed\nsoftly, and went about almost on tip-toe. When the porridge was\nready, Kester was called in to his breakfast, which he took sitting\nat the dresser with the family. A large wooden platter stood in the\nmiddle; and each had a bowl of the same material filled with milk.\nThe way was for every one to dip his pewter spoon into the central\ndish, and convey as much or as little as he liked at a time of the\nhot porridge into his pure fresh milk. But to-day Bell told Kester\nto help himself all at once, and to take his bowl up to the master's\nroom and keep him company. For Daniel was in bed, resting from his\nweariness, and bemoaning his painful bruises whenever he thought of\nthem. But his mind was still so much occupied with the affair of the\nprevious night, that Bell judged rightly that a new listener would\ngive ease to his body as well as to his mind, and her proposal of\nKester's carrying up his breakfast had been received by Daniel with\nsatisfaction.\n\nSo Kester went up slowly, carrying his over-full basin tenderly, and\nseated himself on the step leading down into the bed-room (for\nlevels had not been calculated when the old house was built) facing\nhis master, who, half sitting up in the blue check bed, not\nunwillingly began his relation again; to which Kester listened so\nattentively, that his spoon was often arrested in its progress from\nthe basin to his mouth, open ready to receive it, while he gazed\nwith unwinking eyes at Daniel narrating his exploits.\n\nBut after Daniel had fought his battle o'er again to every auditor\nwithin his reach, he found the seclusion of his chamber rather\noppressive, without even the usual week-days' noises below; so after\ndinner, though far from well, he came down and wandered about the\nstable and the fields nearest to the house, consulting with Kester\nas to crops and manure for the most part; but every now and then\nbreaking out into an episodical chuckle over some part of last\nnight's proceedings. Kester enjoyed the day even more than his\nmaster, for he had no bruises to remind him that, although a hero,\nhe was also flesh and blood.\n\nWhen they returned to the house they found Philip there, for it was\nalready dusk. It was Kester's usual Sunday plan to withdraw to bed\nat as early an hour as he could manage to sleep, often in winter\nbefore six; but now he was too full of interest in what Philip might\nhave to tell of Monkshaven news to forego his Sabbath privilege of\nspending the evening sitting on the chair at the end of the dresser\nbehind the door.\n\nPhilip was as close to Sylvia as he could possibly get without\ngiving her offence, when they came in. Her manner was listless and\ncivil; she had lost all that active feeling towards him which made\nhim positively distasteful, and had called out her girlish\nirritation and impertinence. She now was rather glad to see him than\notherwise. He brought some change into the heavy monotony of her\nlife--monotony so peaceful until she had been stirred by passion out\nof that content with the small daily events which had now become\nburdensome recurrences. Insensibly to herself she was becoming\ndependent on his timid devotion, his constant attention; and he,\nlover-like, once so attracted, in spite of his judgment, by her\nliveliness and piquancy, now doted on her languor, and thought her\nsilence more sweet than words.\n\nHe had only just arrived when master and man came in. He had been to\nafternoon chapel; none of them had thought of going to the distant\nchurch; worship with them was only an occasional duty, and this day\ntheir minds had been too full of the events of the night before.\nDaniel sate himself heavily down in his accustomed chair, the\nthree-cornered arm-chair in the fireside corner, which no one\nthought of anybody else ever occupying on any occasion whatever. In\na minute or two he interrupted Philip's words of greeting and\ninquiry by breaking out into the story of the rescue of last night.\nBut to the mute surprise of Sylvia, the only one who noticed it,\nPhilip's face, instead of expressing admiration and pleasant wonder,\nlengthened into dismay; once or twice he began to interrupt, but\nstopped himself as if he would consider his words again. Kester was\nnever tired of hearing his master talk; by long living together they\nunderstood every fold of each other's minds, and small expressions\nhad much significance to them. Bell, too, sate thankful that her\nhusband should have done such deeds. Only Sylvia was made uneasy by\nPhilip's face and manner. When Daniel had ended there was a great\nsilence, instead of the questions and compliments he looked to\nreceive. He became testy, and turning to Bell, said,--\n\n'My nephew looks as though he was a-thinking more on t' little\nprofit he has made on his pins an' bobs, than as if he was heeding\nhow honest men were saved from being haled out to yon tender, an'\ncarried out o' sight o' wives and little 'uns for iver. Wives an'\nlittle 'uns may go t' workhouse or clem for aught he cares.\n\nPhilip went very red, and then more sallow than usual. He had not\nbeen thinking of Charley Kinraid, but of quite another thing, while\nDaniel had told his story; but this last speech of the old man's\nbrought up the remembrance that was always quick, do what he would\nto smother or strangle it. He did not speak for a moment or two,\nthen he said,--\n\n'To-day has not been like Sabbath in Monkshaven. T' rioters, as\nfolks call 'em, have been about all night. They wanted to give\nbattle to t' men-o'-war's men; and it were taken up by th' better\nend, and they've sent to my Lord Malton for t' militia; and they're\ncome into t' town, and they're hunting for a justice for t' read th'\nact; folk do say there'll be niver a shop opened to-morrow.'\n\nThis was rather a more serious account of the progress of the affair\nthan any one had calculated upon. They looked grave upon it awhile,\nthen Daniel took heart and said,--\n\n'A think we'd done a'most enough last neet; but men's not to be\nstopped wi' a straw when their blood is up; still it's hard lines to\ncall out t' sojers, even if they be but militia. So what we seven\nhatched in a dark entry has ta'en a lord to put a stop to 't!'\ncontinued he, chuckling a little, but more faintly this time.\n\nPhilip went on, still graver than before, boldly continuing to say\nwhat he knew would be discordant to the family he loved so well.\n\n'I should ha' telled yo' all about it; I thought on it just as a bit\no' news; I'd niver thought on such a thing as uncle there having\nbeen in it, and I'm main sorry to hear on it, I am.'\n\n'Why?' said Sylvia, breathlessly.\n\n'It's niver a thing to be sorry on. I'm proud and glad,' said Bell.\n\n'Let-a-be, let-a-be,' said Daniel, in much dudgeon. 'A were a fool\nto tell him o' such-like doings, they're noane i' his line; we'll\ntalk on yard measures now.\n\nPhilip took no notice of this poor attempt at sarcasm: he seemed as\nif lost in thought, then he said,--\n\n'I'm vexed to plague yo', but I'd best say all I've got i' my mind.\nThere was a vast o' folk at our chapel speaking about it--last\nnight's doings and this morning's work--and how them as set it afoot\nwas assured o' being clapt int' prison and tried for it; and when I\nheered uncle say as he was one, it like ran through me; for they say\nas t' justices will be all on t' Government side, and mad for\nvengeance.'\n\nFor an instant there was dead silence. The women looked at each\nother with blank eyes, as if they were as yet unable to take in the\nnew idea that the conduct which had seemed to them a subject for\nsuch just pride could be regarded by any one as deserving of\npunishment or retribution. Daniel spoke before they had recovered\nfrom their amazement.\n\n'A'm noane sorry for what a did, an' a'd do it again to-neet, if\nneed were. So theere's for thee. Thou may tell t' justices fra' me\nthat a reckon a did righter nor them, as letten poor fellys be\ncarried off i' t' very midst o' t' town they're called justices\nfor.'\n\nPerhaps Philip had better have held his tongue; but he believed in\nthe danger, which he was anxious to impress upon his uncle, in order\nthat, knowing what was to be apprehended, the latter might take some\npains to avert it.\n\nHe went on.\n\n'But they're making a coil about the Randyvowse being all\ndestroyed!'\n\nDaniel had taken down his pipe from the shelf in the chimney corner,\nand was stuffing tobacco into the bowl. He went on pretending to do\nthis a little while after it was filled; for, to tell the truth, he\nwas beginning to feel uncomfortable at the new view of his conduct\npresented to him. Still he was not going to let this appear, so\nlifting up his head with an indifferent air he lighted the pipe,\nblew into it, took it out and examined it as something were wrong\nabout it, and until that was put to rights he was unable to attend\nto anything else; all the while the faithful three who hung upon his\nwell-being, gazing, breathless, at his proceedings, and anxious for\nhis reply.\n\n'Randyvowse!' said he at length, 'it were a good job it were brenned\ndown, for such a harbour for vermin a never seed: t' rats ran across\nt' yard by hunders an' thousands; an' it were no man's property as\na've heerd tell, but belonged to Chancery, up i' Lunnon; so wheere's\nt' harm done, my fine felly?'\n\nPhilip was silent. He did not care to brave any further his uncle's\nangry frown and contracted eye. If he had only known of Daniel\nRobson's part in the riot before he had left the town, he would have\ntaken care to have had better authority for the reality of the\ndanger which he had heard spoken about, and in which he could not\nhelp believing. As it was, he could only keep quiet until he had\nascertained what was the legal peril overhanging the rioters, and\nhow far his uncle had been recognized.\n\nDaniel went on puffing angrily. Kester sighed audibly, and then was\nsorry he had done so, and began to whistle. Bell, full of her new\nfear, yet desirous to bring all present into some kind of harmony,\nsaid,--\n\n'It'll ha' been a loss to John Hobbs--all his things burnt, or\ntrampled on. Mebbe he desarved it all, but one's a kind o' tender\nfeeling to one's tables and chairs, special if one's had t'\nbees-waxing on 'em.'\n\n'A wish he'd been burnt on t' top on 'em, a do,' growled out Daniel,\nshaking the ash out of his pipe.\n\n'Don't speak so ill o' thysel',' said his wife. 'Thou'd ha' been t'\nfirst t' pluck him down if he'd screeched out.'\n\n'An' a'll warrant if they come about wi' a paper asking for\nfeyther's name to make up for what Hobbs has lost by t' fire,\nfeyther 'll be for giving him summut,' said Sylvia.\n\n'Thou knows nought about it,' said Daniel. 'Hold thy tongue next\ntime till thou's axed to speak, my wench.'\n\nHis sharp irritated way of speaking was so new to Sylvia, that the\ntears sprang to her eyes, and her lip quivered. Philip saw it all,\nand yearned over her. He plunged headlong into some other subject to\ntry and divert attention from her; but Daniel was too ill at ease to\ntalk much, and Bell was obliged to try and keep up the semblance of\nconversation, with an occasional word or two from Kester, who seemed\ninstinctively to fall into her way of thinking, and to endeavour to\nkeep the dark thought in the background.\n\nSylvia stole off to bed; more concerned at her father's angry way of\nspeaking than at the idea of his being amenable to law for what he\nhad done; the one was a sharp present evil, the other something\ndistant and unlikely. Yet a dim terror of this latter evil hung over\nher, and once upstairs she threw herself on her bed and sobbed.\nPhilip heard her where he sate near the bottom of the short steep\nstaircase, and at every sob the cords of love round his heart seemed\ntightened, and he felt as if he must there and then do something to\nconsole her.\n\nBut, instead, he sat on talking of nothings, a conversation in which\nDaniel joined with somewhat of surliness, while Bell, grave and\nanxious, kept wistfully looking from one to the other, desirous of\ngleaning some further information on the subject, which had begun to\ntrouble her mind. She hoped some chance would give her the\nopportunity of privately questioning Philip, but it seemed to be\nequally her husband's wish to thwart any such intention of hers. He\nremained in the house-place, till after Philip had left, although he\nwas evidently so much fatigued as to give some very distinct, though\nunintentional, hints to his visitor to be gone.\n\nAt length the house-door was locked on Philip, and then Daniel\nprepared to go to bed. Kester had left for his loft above the\nshippen more than an hour before. Bell had still to rake the fire,\nand then she would follow her husband upstairs.\n\nAs she was scraping up the ashes, she heard, intermixed with the\nnoise she was making, the sound of some one rapping gently at the\nwindow. In her then frame of mind she started a little; but on\nlooking round, she saw Kester's face pressed against the glass, and,\nreassured, she softly opened the door. There he stood in the dusk\nouter air, distinct against the gray darkness beyond, and in his\nhand something which she presently perceived was a pitchfork.\n\n'Missus!' whispered he, 'a've watched t' maister t' bed; an' now a'd\nbe greatly beholden to yo' if yo'd let me just lay me down i' t'\nhouse-place. A'd warrant niver a constable i' a' Monkshaven should\nget sight o' t' maister, an' me below t' keep ward.'\n\nBell shivered a little.\n\n'Nay, Kester,' she said, patting her hand kindly on his shoulder;\n'there's nought for t' fear. Thy master is not one for t' hurt\nnobody; and I dunnot think they can harm him for setting yon poor\nchaps free, as t' gang catched i' their wicked trap.'\n\nKester stood still; then he shook his head slowly.\n\n'It's t' work at t' Randyvowse as a'm afeared on. Some folks thinks\nsuch a deal o' a bonfire. Then a may lay me down afore t' fire,\nmissus?' said he, beseechingly.\n\n'Nay, Kester--' she began; but suddenly changing, she said, 'God\nbless thee, my man; come in and lay thee down on t' settle, and I'll\ncover thee up wi' my cloak as hangs behind t' door. We're not many\non us that love him, an' we'll be all on us under one roof, an'\nniver a stone wall or a lock betwixt us.'\n\nSo Kester took up his rest in the house-place that night, and none\nknew of it besides Bell.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXV\n\nCOMING TROUBLES\n\n\nThe morning brought more peace if it did not entirely dissipate\nfear. Daniel seemed to have got over his irritability, and was\nunusually kind and tender to wife and daughter, especially striving\nby silent little deeds to make up for the sharp words he had said\nthe night before to the latter.\n\nAs if by common consent, all allusion to the Saturday night's\nproceedings was avoided. They spoke of the day's work before them;\nof the crops to be sown; of the cattle; of the markets; but each one\nwas conscious of a wish to know more distinctly what were the\nchances of the danger that, to judge from Philip's words, hung over\nthem, falling upon them and cutting them off from all these places\nfor the coming days.\n\nBell longed to send Kester down into Monkshaven as a sort of spy to\nsee how the land lay; but she dared not manifest her anxiety to her\nhusband, and could not see Kester alone. She wished that she had\ntold him to go to the town, when she had had him to herself in the\nhouse-place the night before; now it seemed as though Daniel were\nresolved not to part from him, and as though both had forgotten that\nany peril had been anticipated. Sylvia and her mother, in like\nmanner, clung together, not speaking of their fears, yet each\nknowing that it was ever present in the other's mind.\n\nSo things went on till twelve o'clock--dinner-time. If at any time\nthat morning they had had the courage to speak together on the\nthought which was engrossing all their minds, it is possible that\nsome means might have been found to avert the calamity that was\ncoming towards them with swift feet. But among the uneducated--the\npartially educated--nay, even the weakly educated--the feeling\nexists which prompted the futile experiment of the well-known\nostrich. They imagine that, by closing their own eyes to apprehended\nevil, they avert it. The expression of fear is supposed to\naccelerate the coming of its cause. Yet, on the other hand, they\nshrink from acknowledging the long continuance of any blessing, in\nthe idea that when unusual happiness is spoken about, it disappears.\nSo, although perpetual complaints of past or present grievances and\nsorrows are most common among this class, they shrink from embodying\napprehensions for the future in words, as if it then took shape and\ndrew near.\n\nThey all four sate down to dinner, but not one of them was inclined\nto eat. The food was scarcely touched on their plates, yet they were\ntrying to make talk among themselves as usual; they seemed as though\nthey dared not let themselves be silent, when Sylvia, sitting\nopposite to the window, saw Philip at the top of the brow, running\nrapidly towards the farm. She had been so full of the anticipation\nof some kind of misfortune all the morning that she felt now as if\nthis was the very precursive circumstance she had been expecting;\nshe stood up, turning quite white, and, pointing with her finger,\nsaid,--\n\n'There he is!'\n\nEvery one at table stood up too. An instant afterwards, Philip,\nbreathless, was in the room.\n\nHe gasped out, 'They're coming! the warrant is out. You must go. I\nhoped you were gone.'\n\n'God help us!' said Bell, and sate suddenly down, as if she had\nreceived a blow that made her collapse into helplessness; but she\ngot up again directly.\n\nSylvia flew for her father's hat. He really seemed the most unmoved\nof the party.\n\n'A'm noane afeared,' said he. 'A'd do it o'er again, a would; an'\na'll tell 'em so. It's a fine time o' day when men's to be trapped\nand carried off, an' them as lays traps to set 'em free is to be put\ni' t' lock-ups for it.'\n\n'But there was rioting, beside the rescue; t' house was burnt,'\ncontinued eager, breathless Philip.\n\n'An' a'm noane goin' t' say a'm sorry for that, neyther; tho',\nmebbe, a wouldn't do it again.'\n\nSylvia had his hat on his head by this time; and Bell, wan and\nstiff, trembling all over, had his over-coat, and his leather purse\nwith the few coins she could muster, ready for him to put on.\n\nHe looked at these preparations, at his wife and daughter, and his\ncolour changed from its ruddy brown.\n\n'A'd face lock-ups, an' a fair spell o' jail, but for these,' said\nhe, hesitating.\n\n'Oh!' said Philip, 'for God's sake, lose no time, but be off.'\n\n'Where mun he go?' asked Bell, as if Philip must decide all.\n\n'Anywhere, anywhere, out of this house--say Haverstone. This\nevening, I'll go and meet him there and plan further; only be off\nnow.' Philip was so keenly eager, he hardly took note at the time of\nSylvia's one vivid look of unspoken thanks, yet he remembered it\nafterwards.\n\n'A'll dang 'em dead,' said Kester, rushing to the door, for he saw\nwhat the others did not--that all chance of escape was over; the\nconstables were already at the top of the little field-path not\ntwenty yards off.\n\n'Hide him, hide him,' cried Bell, wringing her hands in terror; for\nshe, indeed they all, knew that flight would now be impossible.\nDaniel was heavy, rheumatic, and, moreover, had been pretty severely\nbruised on that unlucky night.\n\nPhilip, without another word, pushed Daniel before him upstairs,\nfeeling that his own presence at Haytersbank Farm at that hour of\nthe day would be a betrayal. They had just time to shut themselves\nup in the larger bed-room, before they heard a scuffle and the\nconstables' entry down-stairs.\n\n'They're in,' said Philip, as Daniel squeezed himself under the bed;\nand then they held quite still, Philip as much concealed by the\nscanty, blue-check curtain as he could manage to be. They heard a\nconfusion of voices below, a hasty moving of chairs, a banging of\ndoors, a further parley, and then a woman's scream, shrill and\npitiful; then steps on the stairs.\n\n'That screech spoiled all,' sighed Philip.\n\nIn one instant the door was opened, and each of the hiders was\nconscious of the presence of the constables, although at first the\nlatter stood motionless, surveying the apparently empty room with\ndisappointment. Then in another moment they had rushed at Philip's\nlegs, exposed as these were. They drew him out with violence, and\nthen let him go.\n\n'Measter Hepburn!' said one in amaze. But immediately they put two\nand two together; for in so small a place as Monkshaven every one's\nrelationships and connexions, and even likings, were known; and the\nmotive of Philip's coming out to Haytersbank was perfectly clear to\nthese men.\n\n'T' other 'll not be far off,' said the other constable. 'His plate\nwere down-stairs, full o' victual; a seed Measter Hepburn a-walking\nbriskly before me as a left Monkshaven.'\n\n'Here he be, here he be,' called out the other man, dragging Daniel\nout by his legs, 'we've getten him.'\n\nDaniel kicked violently, and came out from his hiding-place in a\nless ignominious way than by being pulled out by his heels.\n\nHe shook himself, and then turned, facing his captors.\n\n'A wish a'd niver hidden mysel'; it were his doing,' jerking his\nthumb toward Philip: 'a'm ready to stand by what a've done. Yo've\ngetten a warrant a'll be bound, for them justices is grand at\nwritin' when t' fight's over.'\n\nHe was trying to carry it off with bravado, but Philip saw that he\nhad received a shock, from his sudden look of withered colour and\nshrunken feature.\n\n'Don't handcuff him,' said Philip, putting money into the\nconstable's hand. 'You'll be able to guard him well enough without\nthem things.'\n\nDaniel turned round sharp at this whisper.\n\n'Let-a-be, let-a-be, my lad,' he said. 'It 'll be summut to think on\ni' t' lock-up how two able-bodied fellys were so afeared on t' chap\nas reskyed them honest sailors o' Saturday neet, as they mun put him\ni' gyves, and he sixty-two come Martinmas, and sore laid up wi' t'\nrheumatics.'\n\nBut it was difficult to keep up this tone of bravado when he was led\na prisoner through his own house-place, and saw his poor wife\nquivering and shaking all over with her efforts to keep back all\nsigns of emotion until he was gone; and Sylvia standing by her\nmother, her arm round Bell's waist and stroking the poor shrunken\nfingers which worked so perpetually and nervously in futile\nunconscious restlessness. Kester was in a corner of the room,\nsullenly standing.\n\nBell quaked from head to foot as her husband came down-stairs a\nprisoner. She opened her lips several times with an uneasy motion,\nas if she would fain say something, but knew not what. Sylvia's\npassionate swollen lips and her beautiful defiant eyes gave her face\nquite a new aspect; she looked a helpless fury.\n\n'A may kiss my missus, a reckon,' said Daniel, coming to a\nstandstill as he passed near her.\n\n'Oh, Dannel, Dannel!' cried she, opening her arms wide to receive\nhim. 'Dannel, Dannel, my man!' and she shook with her crying, laying\nher head on his shoulder, as if he was all her stay and comfort.\n\n'Come, missus! come, missus!' said he, 'there couldn't be more ado\nif a'd been guilty of murder, an' yet a say again, as a said afore,\na'm noane ashamed o' my doings. Here, Sylvie, lass, tak' thy mother\noff me, for a cannot do it mysel', it like sets me off.' His voice\nwas quavering as he said this. But he cheered up a little and said,\n'Now, good-by, oud wench' (kissing her), 'and keep a good heart,\nand let me see thee lookin' lusty and strong when a come back.\nGood-by, my lass; look well after mother, and ask Philip for\nguidance if it's needed.'\n\nHe was taken out of his home, and then arose the shrill cries of the\nwomen; but in a minute or two they were checked by the return of one\nof the constables, who, cap in hand at the sight of so much grief,\nsaid,--\n\n'He wants a word wi' his daughter.'\n\nThe party had come to a halt about ten yards from the house. Sylvia,\nhastily wiping her tears on her apron, ran out and threw her arms\nround her father, as if to burst out afresh on his neck.\n\n'Nay, nay, my wench, it's thee as mun be a comfort to mother: nay,\nnay, or thou'll niver hear what a've got to say. Sylvie, my lass,\na'm main and sorry a were so short wi' thee last neet; a ax thy\npardon, lass, a were cross to thee, and sent thee to thy bed wi' a\nsore heart. Thou munnot think on it again, but forgie me, now a'm\nleavin' thee.'\n\n'Oh, feyther! feyther!' was all Sylvia could say; and at last they\nhad to make as though they would have used force to separate her\nfrom their prisoner. Philip took her hand, and softly led her back\nto her weeping mother.\n\nFor some time nothing was to be heard in the little farmhouse\nkitchen but the sobbing and wailing of the women. Philip stood by\nsilent, thinking, as well as he could, for his keen sympathy with\ntheir grief, what had best be done next. Kester, after some growls\nat Sylvia for having held back the uplifted arm which he thought\nmight have saved Daniel by a well-considered blow on his captors as\nthey entered the house, went back into his shippen--his cell for\nmeditation and consolation, where he might hope to soothe himself\nbefore going out to his afternoon's work; labour which his master\nhad planned for him that very morning, with a strange foresight, as\nKester thought, for the job was one which would take him two or\nthree days without needing any further directions than those he had\nreceived, and by the end of that time he thought that his master\nwould be at liberty again. So he--so they all thought in their\nignorance and inexperience.\n\nAlthough Daniel himself was unreasoning, hasty, impulsive--in a\nword, often thinking and acting very foolishly--yet, somehow, either\nfrom some quality in his character, or from the loyalty of nature in\nthose with whom he had to deal in his every-day life, he had made\nhis place and position clear as the arbiter and law-giver of his\nhousehold. On his decision, as that of husband, father, master,\nperhaps superior natures waited. So now that he was gone and had\nleft them in such strange new circumstances so suddenly, it seemed\nas though neither Bell nor Sylvia knew exactly what to do when their\ngrief was spent, so much had every household action and plan been\nregulated by the thought of him. Meanwhile Philip had slowly been\narriving at the conclusion that he was more wanted at Monkshaven to\nlook after Daniel's interests, to learn what were the legal\nprobabilities in consequence of the old man's arrest, and to arrange\nfor his family accordingly, than standing still and silent in the\nHaytersbank kitchen, too full of fellow-feeling and heavy foreboding\nto comfort, awkwardly unsympathetic in appearance from the very\naching of his heart.\n\nSo when his aunt, with instinctive sense of regularity and\npropriety, began to put away the scarcely tasted dinner, and Sylvia,\nblinded with crying, and convulsively sobbing, was yet trying to\nhelp her mother, Philip took his hat, and brushing it round and\nround with the sleeve of his coat, said,--\n\n'I think I'll just go back, and see how matters stand.' He had a\nmore distinct plan in his head than these words implied, but it\ndepended on so many contingencies of which he was ignorant that he\nsaid only these few words; and with a silent resolution to see them\nagain that day, but a dread of being compelled to express his fears,\nso far beyond theirs, he went off without saying anything more. Then\nSylvia lifted up her voice with a great cry. Somehow she had\nexpected him to do something--what, she did not know; but he was\ngone, and they were left without stay or help.\n\n'Hush thee, hush thee,' said her mother, trembling all over herself;\n'it's for the best. The Lord knows.'\n\n'But I niver thought he'd leave us,' moaned Sylvia, half in her\nmother's arms, and thinking of Philip. Her mother took the words as\napplied to Daniel.\n\n'And he'd niver ha' left us, my wench, if he could ha' stayed.'\n\n'Oh, mother, mother, it's Philip as has left us, and he could ha'\nstayed.'\n\n'He'll come back, or mebbe send, I'll be bound. Leastways he'll be\ngone to see feyther, and he'll need comfort most on all, in a fremd\nplace--in Bridewell--and niver a morsel of victual or a piece o'\nmoney.' And now she sate down, and wept the dry hot tears that come\nwith such difficulty to the eyes of the aged. And so--first one\ngrieving, and then the other, and each draining her own heart of\nevery possible hope by way of comfort, alternately trying to cheer\nand console--the February afternoon passed away; the continuous rain\nclosing in the daylight even earlier than usual, and adding to the\ndreariness, with the natural accompaniments of wailing winds, coming\nwith long sweeps over the moors, and making the sobbings at the\nwindows that always sound like the gasps of some one in great agony.\nMeanwhile Philip had hastened back to Monkshaven. He had no\numbrella, he had to face the driving rain for the greater part of\nthe way; but he was thankful to the weather, for it kept men\nindoors, and he wanted to meet no one, but to have time to think and\nmature his plans. The town itself was, so to speak, in mourning. The\nrescue of the sailors was a distinctly popular movement; the\nsubsequent violence (which had, indeed, gone much further than has\nbeen described, after Daniel left it) was, in general, considered as\nonly a kind of due punishment inflicted in wild justice on the\npress-gang and their abettors. The feeling of the Monkshaven people\nwas, therefore, in decided opposition to the vigorous steps taken by\nthe county magistrates, who, in consequence of an appeal from the\nnaval officers in charge of the impressment service, had called out\nthe militia (from a distant and inland county) stationed within a\nfew miles, and had thus summarily quenched the riots that were\ncontinuing on the Sunday morning after a somewhat languid fashion;\nthe greater part of the destruction of property having been\naccomplished during the previous night. Still there was little doubt\nbut that the violence would have been renewed as evening drew on,\nand the more desperate part of the population and the enraged\nsailors had had the Sabbath leisure to brood over their wrongs, and\nto encourage each other in a passionate attempt at redress, or\nrevenge. So the authorities were quite justified in the decided\nsteps they had taken, both in their own estimation then, and now, in\nours, looking back on the affair in cold blood. But at the time\nfeeling ran strongly against them; and all means of expressing\nitself in action being prevented, men brooded sullenly in their own\nhouses. Philip, as the representative of the family, the head of\nwhich was now suffering for his deeds in the popular cause, would\nhave met with more sympathy, ay, and more respect than he imagined,\nas he went along the streets, glancing from side to side, fearful of\nmeeting some who would shy him as the relation of one who had been\nignominiously taken to Bridewell a few hours before. But in spite of\nthis wincing of Philip's from observation and remark, he never\ndreamed of acting otherwise than as became a brave true friend. And\nthis he did, and would have done, from a natural faithfulness and\nconstancy of disposition, without any special regard for Sylvia.\n\nHe knew his services were needed in the shop; business which he had\nleft at a moment's warning awaited him, unfinished; but at this time\nhe could not bear the torture of giving explanations, and alleging\nreasons to the languid intelligence and slow sympathies of Coulson.\n\nHe went to the offices of Mr. Donkin, the oldest established and most\nrespected attorney in Monkshaven--he who had been employed to draw\nup the law papers and deeds of partnership consequent on Hepburn and\nCoulson succeeding to the shop of John and Jeremiah Foster,\nBrothers.\n\nMr. Donkin knew Philip from this circumstance. But, indeed, nearly\nevery one in Monkshaven knew each other; if not enough to speak to,\nat least enough to be acquainted with the personal appearance and\nreputation of most of those whom they met in the streets. It so\nhappened that Mr. Donkin had a favourable opinion of Philip; and\nperhaps for this reason the latter had a shorter time to wait before\nhe obtained an interview with the head of the house, than many of\nthe clients who came for that purpose from town or country for many\nmiles round.\n\nPhilip was ushered in. Mr. Donkin sate with his spectacles pushed up\non his forehead, ready to watch his countenance and listen to his\nwords.\n\n'Good afternoon, Mr. Hepburn!'\n\n'Good afternoon, sir.' Philip hesitated how to begin. Mr. Donkin\nbecame impatient, and tapped with the fingers of his left hand on\nhis desk. Philip's sensitive nerves felt and rightly interpreted the\naction.\n\n'Please, sir, I'm come to speak to you about Daniel Robson, of\nHaytersbank Farm.'\n\n'Daniel Robson?' said Mr. Donkin, after a short pause, to try and\ncompel Philip into speed in his story.\n\n'Yes, sir. He's been taken up on account of this affair, sir, about\nthe press-gang on Saturday night.'\n\n'To be sure! I thought I knew the name.' And Mr. Donkin's face became\ngraver, and the expression more concentrated. Looking up suddenly at\nPhilip, he said, 'You are aware that I am the clerk to the\nmagistrates?'\n\n'No, sir,' in a tone that indicated the unexpressed 'What then?'\n\n'Well, but I am. And so of course, if you want my services or advice\nin favour of a prisoner whom they have committed, or are going to\ncommit, you can't have them, that's all.'\n\n'I am very sorry--very!' said Philip; and then he was again silent\nfor a period; long enough to make the busy attorney impatient.\n\n'Well, Mr. Hepburn, have you anything else to say to me?'\n\n'Yes, sir. I've a deal to ask of you; for you see I don't rightly\nunderstand what to do; and yet I'm all as Daniel's wife and daughter\nhas to look to; and I've their grief heavy on my heart. You could\nnot tell me what is to be done with Daniel, could you, sir?'\n\n'He'll be brought up before the magistrates to-morrow morning for\nfinal examination, along with the others, you know, before he's sent\nto York Castle to take his trial at the spring assizes.'\n\n'To York Castle, sir?'\n\nMr. Donkin nodded, as if words were too precious to waste.\n\n'And when will he go?' asked poor Philip, in dismay.\n\n'To-morrow: most probably as soon as the examination is over. The\nevidence is clear as to his being present, aiding and\nabetting,--indicted on the 4th section of 1 George I., statute 1,\nchapter 5. I'm afraid it's a bad look-out. Is he a friend of yours,\nMr. Hepburn?'\n\n'Only an uncle, sir,' said Philip, his heart getting full; more from\nMr. Donkin's manner than from his words. 'But what can they do to\nhim, sir?'\n\n'Do?' Mr. Donkin half smiled at the ignorance displayed. 'Why, hang\nhim, to be sure; if the judge is in a hanging mood. He's been either\na principal in the offence, or a principal in the second degree,\nand, as such, liable to the full punishment. I drew up the warrant\nmyself this morning, though I left the exact name to be filled up by\nmy clerk.'\n\n'Oh, sir! can you do nothing for me?' asked Philip, with sharp\nbeseeching in his voice. He had never imagined that it was a capital\noffence; and the thought of his aunt's and Sylvia's ignorance of the\npossible fate awaiting him whom they so much loved, was like a stab\nto his heart.\n\n'No, my good fellow. I'm sorry; but, you see, it's my duty to do all\nI can to bring criminals to justice.'\n\n'My uncle thought he was doing such a fine deed.'\n\n'Demolishing and pulling down, destroying and burning\ndwelling-houses and outhouses,' said Mr. Donkin. 'He must have some\npeculiar notions.'\n\n'The people is so mad with the press-gang, and Daniel has been at\nsea hisself; and took it so to heart when he heard of mariners and\nseafaring folk being carried off, and just cheated into doing what\nwas kind and helpful--leastways, what would have been kind and\nhelpful, if there had been a fire. I'm against violence and riots\nmyself, sir, I'm sure; but I cannot help thinking as Daniel had a\ndeal to justify him on Saturday night, sir.'\n\n'Well; you must try and get a good lawyer to bring out all that side\nof the question. There's a good deal to be said on it; but it's my\nduty to get up all the evidence to prove that he and others were\npresent on the night in question; so, as you'll perceive, I can give\nyou no help in defending him.'\n\n'But who can, sir? I came to you as a friend who, I thought, would\nsee me through it. And I don't know any other lawyer; leastways, to\nspeak to.'\n\nMr. Donkin was really more concerned for the misguided rioters than\nhe was aware; and he was aware of more interest than he cared to\nexpress. So he softened his tone a little, and tried to give the\nbest advice in his power.\n\n'You'd better go to Edward Dawson on the other side of the river; he\nthat was articled clerk with me two years ago, you know. He's a\nclever fellow, and has not too much practice; he'll do the best he\ncan for you. He'll have to be at the court-house, tell him,\nto-morrow morning at ten, when the justices meet. He'll watch the\ncase for you; and then he'll give you his opinion, and tell you what\nto do. You can't do better than follow his advice. I must do all I\ncan to collect evidence for a conviction, you know.'\n\nPhilip stood up, looked at his hat, and then came forward and laid\ndown six and eightpence on the desk in a blushing, awkward way.\n\n'Pooh! pooh!' said Mr. Donkin, pushing the money away. 'Don't be a\nfool; you'll need it all before the trial's over. I've done nothing,\nman. It would be a pretty thing for me to be feed by both parties.'\n\nPhilip took up the money, and left the room. In an instant he came\nback again, glanced furtively at Mr. Donkin's face, and then, once\nmore having recourse to brushing his hat, he said, in a low voice--\n\n'You'll not be hard upon him, sir, I hope?'\n\n'I must do my duty,' replied Mr. Donkin, a little sternly, 'without\nany question of hardness.'\n\nPhilip, discomfited, left the room; an instant of thought and Mr\nDonkin had jumped up, and hastening to the door he opened it and\ncalled after Philip.\n\n'Hepburn--Hepburn--I say, he'll be taken to York as soon as may be\nto-morrow morning; if any one wants to see him before then, they'd\nbetter look sharp about it.'\n\nPhilip went quickly along the streets towards Mr. Dawson's, pondering\nupon the meaning of all that he had heard, and what he had better\ndo. He had made his plans pretty clearly out by the time he arrived\nat Mr. Dawson's smart door in one of the new streets on the other\nside of the river. A clerk as smart as the door answered Philip's\nhesitating knock, and replied to his inquiry as to whether Mr. Dawson\nwas at home, in the negative, adding, after a moment's pause--\n\n'He'll be at home in less than an hour; he's only gone to make Mrs\nDawson's will--Mrs. Dawson, of Collyton--she's not expected to get\nbetter.'\n\nProbably the clerk of an older-established attorney would not have\ngiven so many particulars as to the nature of his master's\nemployment; but, as it happened it was of no consequence, the\nunnecessary information made no impression on Philip's mind; he\nthought the matter over and then said--\n\n'I'll be back in an hour, then. It's gone a quarter to four; I'll be\nback before five, tell Mr. Dawson.'\n\nHe turned on his heel and went back to the High Street as fast as he\ncould, with a far more prompt and decided step than before. He\nhastened through the streets, emptied by the bad weather, to the\nprincipal inn of the town, the George--the sign of which was\nfastened to a piece of wood stretched across the narrow street; and\ngoing up to the bar with some timidity (for the inn was frequented\nby the gentry of Monkshaven and the neighbourhood, and was\nconsidered as a touch above such customers as Philip), he asked if\nhe could have a tax-cart made ready in a quarter of an hour, and\nsent up to the door of his shop.\n\n'To be sure he could; how far was it to go?'\n\nPhilip hesitated before he replied--\n\n'Up the Knotting Lane, to the stile leading down to Haytersbank\nFarm; they'll have to wait there for some as are coming.'\n\n'They must not wait long such an evening as this; standing in such\nrain and wind as there'll be up there, is enough to kill a horse.'\n\n'They shan't wait long,' said Philip, decisively: 'in a quarter of\nan hour, mind.'\n\nHe now went back to the shop, beating against the storm, which was\nincreasing as the tide came in and the night hours approached.\n\nCoulson had no word for him, but he looked reproachfully at his\npartner for his long, unexplained absence. Hester was putting away\nthe ribbons and handkerchiefs, and bright-coloured things which had\nbeen used to deck the window; for no more customers were likely to\ncome this night through the blustering weather to a shop dimly\nlighted by two tallow candles and an inefficient oil-lamp. Philip\ncame up to her, and stood looking at her with unseeing eyes; but the\nstrange consciousness of his fixed stare made her uncomfortable, and\ncalled the faint flush to her pale cheeks, and at length compelled\nher, as it were, to speak, and break the spell of the silence. So,\ncuriously enough, all three spoke at once. Hester asked (without\nlooking at Philip)--\n\n'Yo're sadly wet, I'm feared?'\n\nCoulson said--\n\n'Thou might have a bit o' news to tell one after being on the gad\nall afternoon.'\n\nPhilip whispered to Hester--\n\n'Wilt come into t' parlour? I want a word wi' thee by oursel's.'\n\nHester quietly finished rolling up the ribbon she had in her hands\nwhen he spoke, and then followed him into the room behind the shop\nbefore spoken of.\n\nPhilip set down on the table the candle which he had brought out of\nthe shop, and turning round to Hester, took her trembling hand into\nboth of his, and gripping it nervously, said--\n\n'Oh! Hester, thou must help me--thou will, will not thou?'\n\nHester gulped down something that seemed to rise in her throat and\nchoke her, before she answered.\n\n'Anything, thou knows, Philip.'\n\n'Yes, yes, I know. Thou sees the matter is this: Daniel Robson--he\nwho married my aunt--is taken up for yon riot on Saturday night at\nt' Mariners' Arms----'\n\n'They spoke on it this afternoon; they said the warrant was out,'\nsaid Hester, filling up the sentence as Philip hesitated, lost for\nan instant in his own thoughts.\n\n'Ay! the warrant is out, and he's in t' lock-up, and will be carried\nto York Castle to-morrow morn; and I'm afeared it will go bad with\nhim; and they at Haytersbank is not prepared, and they must see him\nagain before he goes. Now, Hester, will thou go in a tax-cart as\nwill be here in less than ten minutes from t' George, and bring them\nback here, and they must stay all night for to be ready to see him\nto-morrow before he goes? It's dree weather for them, but they'll\nnot mind that.'\n\nHe had used words as if he was making a request to Hester; but he\ndid not seem to await her answer, so sure was he that she would go.\nShe noticed this, and noticed also that the rain was spoken of in\nreference to them, not to her. A cold shadow passed over her heart,\nthough it was nothing more than she already knew--that Sylvia was\nthe one centre of his thoughts and his love.\n\n'I'll go put on my things at once,' said she, gently.\n\nPhilip pressed her hand tenderly, a glow of gratitude overspread\nhim.\n\n'Thou's a real good one, God bless thee!' said he. 'Thou must take\ncare of thyself, too,' continued he; 'there's wraps and plenty i'\nth' house, and if there are not, there's those i' the shop as 'll be\nnone the worse for once wearing at such a time as this; and wrap\nthee well up, and take shawls and cloaks for them, and mind as they\nput 'em on. Thou'll have to get out at a stile, I'll tell t' driver\nwhere; and thou must get over t' stile and follow t' path down two\nfields, and th' house is right before ye, and bid 'em make haste and\nlock up th' house, for they mun stay all night here. Kester 'll look\nafter things.'\n\nAll this time Hester was hastily putting on her hat and cloak, which\nshe had fetched from the closet where they usually hung through the\nday; now she stood listening, as it were, for final directions.\n\n'But suppose they will not come,' said she; 'they dunnot know me,\nand mayn't believe my words.'\n\n'They must,' said he, impatiently. 'They don't know what awaits\n'em,' he continued. 'I'll tell thee, because thou 'll not let out,\nand it seems as if I mun tell some one--it were such a shock--he's\nto be tried for 's life. They know not it's so serious; and,\nHester,' said he, going on in his search after sympathy, 'she's\nlike as if she was bound up in her father.'\n\nHis lips quivered as he looked wistfully into Hester's face at these\nwords. No need to tell her who was _she_. No need to put into words\nthe fact, told plainer than words could have spoken it, that his\nheart was bound up in Sylvia.\n\nHester's face, instead of responding to his look, contracted a\nlittle, and, for the life of her, she could not have helped\nsaying,--\n\n'Why don't yo' go yourself, Philip?'\n\n'I can't, I can't,' said he, impatiently. 'I'd give the world to go,\nfor I might be able to comfort her; but there's lawyers to see, and\niver so much to do, and they've niver a man friend but me to do it\nall. You'll tell her,' said Philip, insinuatingly, as if a fresh\nthought had struck him, 'as how I would ha' come. I would fain ha'\ncome for 'em, myself, but I couldn't, because of th' lawyer,--mind\nyo' say because of th' lawyer. I'd be loath for her to think I was\nminding any business of my own at this time; and, whatever yo' do,\nspeak hopeful, and, for t' life of yo', don't speak of th' hanging,\nit's likely it's a mistake o' Donkin's; and anyhow--there's t'\ncart--anyhow I should perhaps not ha' telled thee, but it's a comfort\nto make a clean breast to a friend at times. God bless thee, Hester. I\ndon't know what I should ha' done without thee,' said he, as he\nwrapped her well up in the cart, and placed the bundles of cloaks\nand things by her side.\n\nAlong the street, in the jolting cart, as long as Hester could see\nthe misty light streaming out of the shop door, so long was Philip\nstanding bareheaded in the rain looking after her. But she knew that\nit was not her own poor self that attracted his lingering gaze. It\nwas the thought of the person she was bound to.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVI\n\nA DREARY VIGIL\n\n\nThrough the dark rain, against the cold wind, shaken over the rough\nstones, went Hester in the little tax-cart. Her heart kept rising\nagainst her fate; the hot tears came unbidden to her eyes. But\nrebellious heart was soothed, and hot tears were sent back to their\nsource before the time came for her alighting.\n\nThe driver turned his horse in the narrow lane, and shouted after\nher an injunction to make haste as, with her head bent low, she\nstruggled down to the path to Haytersbank Farm. She saw the light in\nthe window from the top of the brow, and involuntarily she slackened\nher pace. She had never seen Bell Robson, and would Sylvia recollect\nher? If she did not how awkward it would be to give the explanation\nof who she was, and what her errand was, and why she was sent.\nNevertheless, it must be done; so on she went, and standing within\nthe little porch, she knocked faintly at the door; but in the\nbluster of the elements the sound was lost. Again she knocked, and\nnow the murmur of women's voices inside was hushed, and some one\ncame quickly to the door, and opened it sharply.\n\nIt was Sylvia. Although her face was completely in shadow, of course\nHester knew her well; but she, if indeed she would have recognized\nHester less disguised, did not know in the least who the woman,\nmuffled up in a great cloak, with her hat tied down with a silk\nhandkerchief, standing in the porch at this time of night, could be.\nNor, indeed, was she in a mood to care or to inquire. She said\nhastily, in a voice rendered hoarse and arid with grief:\n\n'Go away. This is no house for strangers to come to. We've enough on\nour own to think on;' and she hastily shut the door in Hester's\nface, before the latter could put together the right words in which\nto explain her errand. Hester stood outside in the dark, wet porch\ndiscomfited, and wondering how next to obtain a hearing through the\nshut and bolted door. Not long did she stand, however; some one was\nagain at the door, talking in a voice of distress and remonstrance,\nand slowly unbarring the bolts. A tall, thin figure of an elderly\nwoman was seen against the warm fire-light inside as soon as the\ndoor was opened; a hand was put out, like that which took the dove\ninto the ark, and Hester was drawn into the warmth and the light,\nwhile Bell's voice went on speaking to Sylvia before addressing the\ndripping stranger--\n\n'It's not a night to turn a dog fra' t' door; it's ill letting our\ngrief harden our hearts. But oh! missus (to Hester), yo' mun forgive\nus, for a great sorrow has fallen upon us this day, an' we're like\nbeside ourselves wi' crying an' plaining.'\n\nBell sate down, and threw her apron over her poor worn face, as if\ndecently to shield the signs of her misery from a stranger's gaze.\nSylvia, all tear-swollen, and looking askance and almost fiercely at\nthe stranger who had made good her intrusion, was drawn, as it were,\nto her mother's side, and, kneeling down by her, put her arms round\nher waist, and almost lay across her lap, still gazing at Hester\nwith cold, distrustful eyes, the expression of which repelled and\ndaunted that poor, unwilling messenger, and made her silent for a\nminute or so after her entrance. Bell suddenly put down her apron.\n\n'Yo're cold and drenched,' said she. 'Come near to t' fire and warm\nyo'rsel'; yo' mun pardon us if we dunnot think on everything at\nonest.'\n\n'Yo're very kind, very kind indeed,' said Hester, touched by the\npoor woman's evident effort to forget her own grief in the duties of\nhospitality, and loving Bell from that moment.\n\n'I'm Hester Rose,' she continued, half addressing Sylvia, who she\nthought might remember the name, 'and Philip Hepburn has sent me in\na tax-cart to t' stile yonder, to fetch both on yo' back to\nMonkshaven.' Sylvia raised her head and looked intently at Hester.\nBell clasped her hands tight together and leant forwards.\n\n'It's my master as wants us?' said she, in an eager, questioning\ntone.\n\n'It's for to see yo'r master,' said Hester. 'Philip says he'll be\nsent to York to-morrow, and yo'll be fain to see him before he goes;\nand if yo'll come down to Monkshaven to-night, yo'll be on t' spot\nagain' the time comes when t' justices will let ye.'\n\nBell was up and about, making for the place where she kept her\nout-going things, almost before Hester had begun to speak. She\nhardly understood about her husband's being sent to York, in the\npossession of the idea that she might go and see him. She did not\nunderstand or care how, in this wild night, she was to get to\nMonkshaven; all she thought of was, that she might go and see her\nhusband. But Sylvia took in more points than her mother, and, almost\nsuspiciously, began to question Hester.\n\n'Why are they sending him to York? What made Philip leave us? Why\ndidn't he come hissel'?'\n\n'He couldn't come hissel', he bade me say; because he was bound to\nbe at the lawyer's at five, about yo'r father's business. I think\nyo' might ha' known he would ha' come for any business of his own;\nand, about York, it's Philip as telled me, and I never asked why. I\nnever thought on yo'r asking me so many questions. I thought yo'd be\nready to fly on any chance o' seeing your father.' Hester spoke out\nthe sad reproach that ran from her heart to her lips. To distrust\nPhilip! to linger when she might hasten!\n\n'Oh!' said Sylvia, breaking out into a wild cry, that carried with\nit more conviction of agony than much weeping could have done. 'I\nmay be rude and hard, and I may ask strange questions, as if I cared\nfor t' answers yo' may gi' me; an', in my heart o' hearts, I care\nfor nought but to have father back wi' us, as love him so dear. I\ncan hardly tell what I say, much less why I say it. Mother is so\npatient, it puts me past mysel', for I could fight wi' t' very\nwalls, I'm so mad wi' grieving. Sure, they'll let him come back wi'\nus to-morrow, when they hear from his own sel' why he did it?'\n\nShe looked eagerly at Hester for an answer to this last question,\nwhich she had put in a soft, entreating tone, as if with Hester\nherself the decision rested. Hester shook her head. Sylvia came up\nto her and took her hands, almost fondling them.\n\n'Yo' dunnot think they'll be hard wi' him when they hear all about\nit, done yo'? Why, York Castle's t' place they send a' t' thieves\nand robbers to, not honest men like feyther.'\n\nHester put her hand on Sylvia's shoulder with a soft, caressing\ngesture.\n\n'Philip will know,' she said, using Philip's name as a kind of\nspell--it would have been so to her. 'Come away to Philip,' said she\nagain, urging Sylvia, by her looks and manner, to prepare for the\nlittle journey. Sylvia moved away for this purpose, saying to\nherself,--\n\n'It's going to see feyther: he will tell me all.'\n\nPoor Mrs. Robson was collecting a few clothes for her husband with an\neager, trembling hand, so trembling that article after article fell\nto the floor, and it was Hester who picked them up; and at last,\nafter many vain attempts by the grief-shaken woman, it was Hester\nwho tied the bundle, and arranged the cloak, and fastened down the\nhood; Sylvia standing by, not unobservant, though apparently\nabsorbed in her own thoughts.\n\nAt length, all was arranged, and the key given over to Kester. As\nthey passed out into the storm, Sylvia said to Hester,--\n\n'Thou's a real good wench. Thou's fitter to be about mother than me.\nI'm but a cross-patch at best, an' now it's like as if I was no good\nto nobody.'\n\nSylvia began to cry, but Hester had no time to attend to her, even\nhad she the inclination: all her care was needed to help the hasty,\ntottering steps of the wife who was feebly speeding up the wet and\nslippery brow to her husband. All Bell thought of was that 'he' was\nat the end of her toil. She hardly understood when she was to see\nhim; her weary heart and brain had only received one idea--that each\nstep she was now taking was leading her to him. Tired and exhausted\nwith her quick walk up hill, battling all the way with wind and\nrain, she could hardly have held up another minute when they reached\nthe tax-cart in the lane, and Hester had almost to lift her on to\nthe front seat by the driver. She covered and wrapped up the poor\nold woman, and afterwards placed herself in the straw at the back of\nthe cart, packed up close by the shivering, weeping Sylvia. Neither\nof them spoke a word at first; but Hester's tender conscience smote\nher for her silence before they had reached Monkshaven. She wanted\nto say some kind word to Sylvia, and yet knew not how to begin.\nSomehow, without knowing why, or reasoning upon it, she hit upon\nPhilip's message as the best comfort in her power to give. She had\ndelivered it before, but it had been apparently little heeded.\n\n'Philip bade me say it was business as kept him from fetchin' yo'\nhissel'--business wi' the lawyer, about--about yo'r father.'\n\n'What do they say?' said Sylvia, suddenly, lifting her bowed head,\nas though she would read her companion's face in the dim light.\n\n'I dunnot know,' said Hester, sadly. They were now jolting over the\npaved streets, and not a word could be spoken. They were now at\nPhilip's door, which was opened to receive them even before they\narrived, as if some one had been watching and listening. The old\nservant, Phoebe, the fixture in the house, who had belonged to it\nand to the shop for the last twenty years, came out, holding a\ncandle and sheltering it in her hand from the weather, while Philip\nhelped the tottering steps of Mrs. Robson as she descended behind. As\nHester had got in last, so she had now to be the first to move. Just\nas she was moving, Sylvia's cold little hand was laid on her arm.\n\n'I am main and thankful to yo'. I ask yo'r pardon for speaking\ncross, but, indeed, my heart's a'most broken wi' fear about\nfeyther.'\n\nThe voice was so plaintive, so full of tears, that Hester could not\nbut yearn towards the speaker. She bent over and kissed her cheek,\nand then clambered unaided down by the wheel on the dark side of the\ncart. Wistfully she longed for one word of thanks or recognition\nfrom Philip, in whose service she had performed this hard task; but\nhe was otherwise occupied, and on casting a further glance back as\nshe turned the corner of the street, she saw Philip lifting Sylvia\ncarefully down in his arms from her footing on the top of the wheel,\nand then they all went into the light and the warmth, the door was\nshut, the lightened cart drove briskly away, and Hester, in rain,\nand cold, and darkness, went homewards with her tired sad heart.\n\nPhilip had done all he could, since his return from lawyer Dawson's,\nto make his house bright and warm for the reception of his beloved.\nHe had a strong apprehension of the probable fate of poor Daniel\nRobson; he had a warm sympathy with the miserable distress of the\nwife and daughter; but still at the back of his mind his spirits\ndanced as if this was to them a festal occasion. He had even taken\nunconscious pleasure in Phoebe's suspicious looks and tones, as he\nhad hurried and superintended her in her operations. A fire blazed\ncheerily in the parlour, almost dazzling to the travellers brought\nin from the darkness and the rain; candles burned--two candles, much\nto Phoebe's discontent. Poor Bell Robson had to sit down almost as\nsoon as she entered the room, so worn out was she with fatigue and\nexcitement; yet she grudged every moment which separated her, as she\nthought, from her husband.\n\n'I'm ready now,' said she, standing up, and rather repulsing\nSylvia's cares; 'I'm ready now,' said she, looking eagerly at\nPhilip, as if for him to lead the way.\n\n'It's not to-night,' replied he, almost apologetically. 'You can't\nsee him to-night; it's to-morrow morning before he goes to York; it\nwas better for yo' to be down here in town ready; and beside I\ndidn't know when I sent for ye that he was locked up for the night.'\n\n'Well-a-day, well-a-day,' said Bell, rocking herself backwards and\nforwards, and trying to soothe herself with these words. Suddenly\nshe said,--\n\n'But I've brought his comforter wi' me--his red woollen comforter as\nhe's allays slept in this twelvemonth past; he'll get his rheumatiz\nagain; oh, Philip, cannot I get it to him?'\n\n'I'll send it by Phoebe,' said Philip, who was busy making tea,\nhospitable and awkward.\n\n'Cannot I take it mysel'?' repeated Bell. 'I could make surer nor\nanybody else; they'd maybe not mind yon woman--Phoebe d'ye call\nher?'\n\n'Nay, mother,' said Sylvia, 'thou's not fit to go.'\n\n'Shall I go?' asked Philip, hoping she would say 'no', and be\ncontent with Phoebe, and leave him where he was.\n\n'Oh, Philip, would yo'?' said Sylvia, turning round.\n\n'Ay,' said Bell, 'if thou would take it they'd be minding yo'.'\n\nSo there was nothing for it but for him to go, in the first flush of\nhis delightful rites of hospitality.\n\n'It's not far,' said he, consoling himself rather than them. 'I'll\nbe back in ten minutes, the tea is maskit, and Phoebe will take yo'r\nwet things and dry 'em by t' kitchen fire; and here's the stairs,'\nopening a door in the corner of the room, from which the stairs\nimmediately ascended. 'There's two rooms at the top; that to t' left\nis all made ready, t' other is mine,' said he, reddening a little as\nhe spoke. Bell was busy undoing her bundle with trembling fingers.\n\n'Here,' said she; 'and oh, lad, here's a bit o' peppermint cake;\nhe's main and fond on it, and I catched sight on it by good luck\njust t' last minute.'\n\nPhilip was gone, and the excitement of Bell and Sylvia flagged once\nmore, and sank into wondering despondency. Sylvia, however, roused\nherself enough to take off her mother's wet clothes, and she took\nthem timidly into the kitchen and arranged them before Phoebe's\nfire.\n\nPhoebe opened her lips once or twice to speak in remonstrance, and\nthen, with an effort, gulped her words down; for her sympathy, like\nthat of all the rest of the Monkshaven world, was in favour of\nDaniel Robson; and his daughter might place her dripping cloak this\nnight wherever she would, for Phoebe.\n\nSylvia found her mother still sitting on the chair next the door,\nwhere she had first placed herself on entering the room.\n\n'I'll gi'e you some tea, mother,' said she, struck with the shrunken\nlook of Bell's face.\n\n'No, no' said her mother. 'It's not manners for t' help oursel's.'\n\n'I'm sure Philip would ha' wished yo' for to take it,' said Sylvia,\npouring out a cup.\n\nJust then he returned, and something in his look, some dumb\nexpression of delight at her occupation, made her blush and hesitate\nfor an instant; but then she went on, and made a cup of tea ready,\nsaying something a little incoherent all the time about her mother's\nneed of it. After tea Bell Robson's weariness became so extreme,\nthat Philip and Sylvia urged her to go to bed. She resisted a\nlittle, partly out of 'manners,' and partly because she kept\nfancying, poor woman, that somehow or other her husband might send\nfor her. But about seven o'clock Sylvia persuaded her to come\nupstairs. Sylvia, too, bade Philip good-night, and his look followed\nthe last wave of her dress as she disappeared up the stairs; then\nleaning his chin on his hand, he gazed at vacancy and thought\ndeeply--for how long he knew not, so intent was his mind on the\nchances of futurity.\n\nHe was aroused by Sylvia's coming down-stairs into the sitting-room\nagain. He started up.\n\n'Mother is so shivery,' said she. 'May I go in there,' indicating\nthe kitchen, 'and make her a drop of gruel?'\n\n'Phoebe shall make it, not you,' said Philip, eagerly preventing\nher, by going to the kitchen door and giving his orders. When he\nturned round again, Sylvia was standing over the fire, leaning her\nhead against the stone mantel-piece for the comparative coolness.\nShe did not speak at first, or take any notice of him. He watched\nher furtively, and saw that she was crying, the tears running down\nher cheeks, and she too much absorbed in her thoughts to wipe them\naway with her apron.\n\nWhile he was turning over in his mind what he could best say to\ncomfort her (his heart, like hers, being almost too full for words),\nshe suddenly looked him full in the face, saying,--\n\n'Philip! won't they soon let him go? what can they do to him?' Her\nopen lips trembled while awaiting his answer, the tears came up and\nfilled her eyes. It was just the question he had most dreaded; it\nled to the terror that possessed his own mind, but which he had\nhoped to keep out of hers. He hesitated. 'Speak, lad!' said she,\nimpatiently, with a little passionate gesture. 'I can see thou\nknows!'\n\nHe had only made it worse by consideration; he rushed blindfold at a\nreply.\n\n'He's ta'en up for felony.'\n\n'Felony,' said she. 'There thou're out; he's in for letting yon men\nout; thou may call it rioting if thou's a mind to set folks again'\nhim, but it's too bad to cast such hard words at him as\nyon--felony,' she repeated, in a half-offended tone.\n\n'It's what the lawyers call it,' said Philip, sadly; 'it's no word\no' mine.'\n\n'Lawyers is allays for making the worst o' things,' said she, a\nlittle pacified, 'but folks shouldn't allays believe them.'\n\n'It's lawyers as has to judge i' t' long run.'\n\n'Cannot the justices, Mr. Harter and them as is no lawyers, give him\na sentence to-morrow, wi'out sending him to York?'\n\n'No!' said Philip, shaking his head. He went to the kitchen door and\nasked if the gruel was not ready, so anxious was he to stop the\nconversation at this point; but Phoebe, who held her young master in\nbut little respect, scolded him for a stupid man, who thought, like\nall his sex, that gruel was to be made in a minute, whatever the\nfire was, and bade him come and make it for himself if he was in\nsuch a hurry.\n\nHe had to return discomfited to Sylvia, who meanwhile had arranged\nher thoughts ready to return to the charge.\n\n'And say he's sent to York, and say he's tried theere, what's t'\nworst they can do again' him?' asked she, keeping down her agitation\nto look at Philip the more sharply. Her eyes never slackened their\npenetrating gaze at his countenance, until he replied, with the\nutmost unwillingness, and most apparent confusion,--\n\n'They may send him to Botany Bay.'\n\nHe knew that he held back a worse contingency, and he was mortally\nafraid that she would perceive this reserve. But what he did say was\nso much beyond her utmost apprehension, which had only reached to\nvarious terms of imprisonment, that she did not imagine the dark\nshadow lurking behind. What he had said was too much for her. Her\neyes dilated, her lips blanched, her pale cheeks grew yet paler.\nAfter a minute's look into his face, as if fascinated by some\nhorror, she stumbled backwards into the chair in the chimney comer,\nand covered her face with her hands, moaning out some inarticulate\nwords.\n\nPhilip was on his knees by her, dumb from excess of sympathy,\nkissing her dress, all unfelt by her; he murmured half-words, he\nbegan passionate sentences that died away upon his lips; and\nshe--she thought of nothing but her father, and was possessed and\nrapt out of herself by the dread of losing him to that fearful\ncountry which was almost like the grave to her, so all but\nimpassable was the gulf. But Philip knew that it was possible that\nthe separation impending might be that of the dark, mysterious\ngrave--that the gulf between the father and child might indeed be\nthat which no living, breathing, warm human creature can ever cross.\n\n'Sylvie, Sylvie!' said he,--and all their conversation had to be\ncarried on in low tones and whispers, for fear of the listening ears\nabove,--'don't,--don't, thou'rt rending my heart. Oh, Sylvie,\nhearken. There's not a thing I'll not do; there's not a penny I've\ngot,--th' last drop of blood that's in me,--I'll give up my life for\nhis.'\n\n'Life,' said she, putting down her hands, and looking at him as if\nher looks could pierce his soul; 'who talks o' touching his life?\nThou're going crazy, Philip, I think;' but she did not think so,\nalthough she would fain have believed it. In her keen agony she read\nhis thoughts as though they were an open page; she sate there,\nupright and stony, the conviction creeping over her face like the\ngrey shadow of death. No more tears, no more trembling, almost no\nmore breathing. He could not bear to see her, and yet she held his\neyes, and he feared to make the effort necessary to move or to turn\naway, lest the shunning motion should carry conviction to her heart.\nAlas! conviction of the probable danger to her father's life was\nalready there: it was that that was calming her down, tightening her\nmuscles, bracing her nerves. In that hour she lost all her early\nyouth.\n\n'Then he may be hung,' said she, low and solemnly, after a long\npause. Philip turned away his face, and did not utter a word. Again\ndeep silence, broken only by some homely sound in the kitchen.\n'Mother must not know on it,' said Sylvia, in the same tone in which\nshe had spoken before.\n\n'It's t' worst as can happen to him,' said Philip. 'More likely\nhe'll be transported: maybe he'll be brought in innocent after all.'\n\n'No,' said Sylvia, heavily, as one without hope--as if she were\nreading some dreadful doom in the tablets of the awful future.\n'They'll hang him. Oh, feyther! feyther!' she choked out, almost\nstuffing her apron into her mouth to deaden the sound, and catching\nat Philip's hand, and wringing it with convulsive force, till the\npain that he loved was nearly more than he could bear. No words of\nhis could touch such agony; but irrepressibly, and as he would have\ndone it to a wounded child, he bent over her, and kissed her with a\ntender, trembling kiss. She did not repulse it, probably she did not\neven perceive it.\n\nAt that moment Phoebe came in with the gruel. Philip saw her, and\nknew, in an instant, what the old woman's conclusion must needs be;\nbut Sylvia had to be shaken by the now standing Philip, before she\ncould be brought back to the least consciousness of the present\ntime. She lifted up her white face to understand his words, then she\nrose up like one who slowly comes to the use of her limbs.\n\n'I suppose I mun go,' she said; 'but I'd sooner face the dead. If\nshe asks me, Philip, what mun I say?'\n\n'She'll not ask yo',' said he, 'if yo' go about as common. She's\nnever asked yo' all this time, an' if she does, put her on to me.\nI'll keep it from her as long as I can; I'll manage better nor I've\ndone wi' thee, Sylvie,' said he, with a sad, faint smile, looking\nwith fond penitence at her altered countenance.\n\n'Thou mustn't blame thysel',' said Sylvia, seeing his regret. 'I\nbrought it on me mysel'; I thought I would ha' t' truth, whativer\ncame on it, and now I'm not strong enough to stand it, God help me!'\nshe continued, piteously.\n\n'Oh, Sylvie, let me help yo'! I cannot do what God can,--I'm not\nmeaning that, but I can do next to Him of any man. I have loved yo'\nfor years an' years, in a way it's terrible to think on, if my love\ncan do nought now to comfort yo' in your sore distress.'\n\n'Cousin Philip,' she replied, in the same measured tone in which she\nhad always spoken since she had learnt the extent of her father's\ndanger, and the slow stillness of her words was in harmony with the\nstony look of her face, 'thou's a comfort to me, I couldn't bide my\nlife without thee; but I cannot take in the thought o' love, it\nseems beside me quite; I can think on nought but them that is quick\nand them that is dead.'\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVII\n\nGLOOMY DAYS\n\n\nPhilip had money in the Fosters' bank, not so much as it might have\nbeen if he had not had to pay for the furniture in his house. Much\nof this furniture was old, and had belonged to the brothers Foster,\nand they had let Philip have it at a very reasonable rate; but still\nthe purchase of it had diminished the amount of his savings. But on\nthe sum which he possessed he drew largely--he drew all--nay, he\noverdrew his account somewhat, to his former masters' dismay,\nalthough the kindness of their hearts overruled the harder arguments\nof their heads.\n\nAll was wanted to defend Daniel Robson at the approaching York\nassizes. His wife had handed over to Philip all the money or money's\nworth she could lay her hands upon. Daniel himself was not one to be\nmuch beforehand with the world; but to Bell's thrifty imagination\nthe round golden guineas, tied up in the old stocking-foot against\nrent-day, seemed a mint of money on which Philip might draw\ninfinitely. As yet she did not comprehend the extent of her\nhusband's danger. Sylvia went about like one in a dream, keeping\nback the hot tears that might interfere with the course of life she\nhad prescribed for herself in that terrible hour when she first\nlearnt all. Every penny of money either she or her mother could save\nwent to Philip. Kester's hoard, too, was placed in Hepburn's hands\nat Sylvia's earnest entreaty; for Kester had no great opinion of\nPhilip's judgment, and would rather have taken his money straight\nhimself to Mr. Dawson, and begged him to use it for his master's\nbehoof.\n\nIndeed, if anything, the noiseless breach between Kester and Philip\nhad widened of late. It was seed-time, and Philip, in his great\nanxiety for every possible interest that might affect Sylvia, and\nalso as some distraction from his extreme anxiety about her father,\nhad taken to study agriculture of an evening in some old books which\nhe had borrowed--_The Farmer's Complete Guide_, and such like; and\nfrom time to time he came down upon the practical dogged Kester with\ndirections gathered from the theories in his books. Of course the\ntwo fell out, but without many words. Kester persevered in his old\nways, making light of Philip and his books in manner and action,\ntill at length Philip withdrew from the contest. 'Many a man may\nlead a horse to water, but there's few can make him drink,' and\nPhilip certainly was not one of those few. Kester, indeed, looked\nupon him with jealous eyes on many accounts. He had favoured Charley\nKinraid as a lover of Sylvia's; and though he had no idea of the\ntruth--though he believed in the drowning of the specksioneer as\nmuch as any one--yet the year which had elapsed since Kinraid's\nsupposed death was but a very short while to the middle-aged man,\nwho forgot how slowly time passes with the young; and he could often\nhave scolded Sylvia, if the poor girl had been a whit less heavy at\nheart than she was, for letting Philip come so much about her--come,\nthough it was on her father's business. For the darkness of their\ncommon dread drew them together, occasionally to the comparative\nexclusion of Bell and Kester, which the latter perceived and\nresented. Kester even allowed himself to go so far as to wonder what\nPhilip could want with all the money, which to him seemed\nunaccountable; and once or twice the ugly thought crossed his mind,\nthat shops conducted by young men were often not so profitable as\nwhen guided by older heads, and that some of the coin poured into\nPhilip's keeping might have another destination than the defence of\nhis master. Poor Philip! and he was spending all his own, and more\nthan all his own money, and no one ever knew it, as he had bound\ndown his friendly bankers to secrecy.\n\nOnce only Kester ventured to speak to Sylvia on the subject of\nPhilip. She had followed her cousin to the field just in front of\ntheir house, just outside the porch, to ask him some question she\ndared not put in her mother's presence--(Bell, indeed, in her\nanxiety, usually absorbed all the questions when Philip came)--and\nstood, after Philip had bid her good-by, hardly thinking about him\nat all, but looking unconsciously after him as he ascended the brow;\nand at the top he had turned to take a last glance at the place his\nlove inhabited, and, seeing her, he had waved his hat in gratified\nfarewell. She, meanwhile, was roused from far other thoughts than of\nhim, and of his now acknowledged love, by the motion against the\nsky, and was turning back into the house when she heard Kester's low\nhoarse call, and saw him standing at the shippen door.\n\n'Come hither, wench,' said he, indignantly; 'is this a time for\ncourtin'?'\n\n'Courting?' said she, drawing up her head, and looking back at him\nwith proud defiance.\n\n'Ay, courtin'! what other mak' o' thing is't when thou's gazin'\nafter yon meddlesome chap, as if thou'd send thy eyes after him, and\nhe making marlocks back at thee? It's what we ca'ed courtin' i' my\nyoung days anyhow. And it's noane a time for a wench to go courtin'\nwhen her feyther's i' prison,' said he, with a consciousness as he\nuttered these last words that he was cruel and unjust and going too\nfar, yet carried on to say them by his hot jealousy against Philip.\n\nSylvia continued looking at him without speaking: she was too much\noffended for expression.\n\n'Thou may glower an' thou may look, lass,' said he, 'but a'd thought\nbetter on thee. It's like last week thy last sweetheart were\ndrowned; but thou's not one to waste time i' rememberin' them as is\ngone--if, indeed, thou iver cared a button for yon Kinraid--if it\nwasn't a make-believe.'\n\nHer lips were contracted and drawn up, showing her small glittering\nteeth, which were scarcely apart as she breathed out--\n\n'Thou thinks so, does thou, that I've forgetten _him_? Thou'd better\nhave a care o' thy tongue.'\n\nThen, as if fearful that her self-command might give way, she turned\ninto the house; and going through the kitchen like a blind person,\nshe went up to her now unused chamber, and threw herself, face\ndownwards, flat on her bed, almost smothering herself.\n\nEver since Daniel's committal, the decay that had imperceptibly\nbegun in his wife's bodily and mental strength during her illness of\nthe previous winter, had been making quicker progress. She lost her\nreticence of speech, and often talked to herself. She had not so\nmuch forethought as of old; slight differences, it is true, but\nwhich, with some others of the same description, gave foundation for\nthe homely expression which some now applied to Bell, 'She'll never\nbe t' same woman again.\n\nThis afternoon she had cried herself to sleep in her chair after\nPhilip's departure. She had not heard Sylvia's sweeping passage\nthrough the kitchen; but half an hour afterwards she was startled up\nby Kester's abrupt entry.\n\n'Where's Sylvie?' asked he.\n\n'I don't know,' said Bell, looking scared, and as if she was ready\nto cry. 'It's no news about him?' said she, standing up, and\nsupporting herself on the stick she was now accustomed to use.\n\n'Bless yo', no, dunnot be afeared, missus; it's only as a spoke\nhasty to t' wench, an' a want t' tell her as a'm sorry,' said\nKester, advancing into the kitchen, and looking round for Sylvia.\n\n'Sylvie, Sylvie!' shouted he; 'she mun be i' t' house.'\n\nSylvia came slowly down the stairs, and stood before him. Her face\nwas pale, her mouth set and determined; the light of her eyes veiled\nin gloom. Kester shrank from her look, and even more from her\nsilence.\n\n'A'm come to ax pardon,' said he, after a little pause.\n\nShe was still silent.\n\n'A'm noane above axing pardon, though a'm fifty and more, and thee's\nbut a silly wench, as a've nursed i' my arms. A'll say before thy\nmother as a ought niver to ha' used them words, and as how a'm sorry\nfor 't.'\n\n'I don't understand it all,' said Bell, in a hurried and perplexed\ntone. 'What has Kester been saying, my lass?' she added, turning to\nSylvia.\n\nSylvia went a step or two nearer to her mother, and took hold of her\nhand as if to quieten her; then facing once more round, she said\ndeliberately to Kester,--\n\n'If thou wasn't Kester, I'd niver forgive thee. Niver,' she added,\nwith bitterness, as the words he had used recurred to her mind.\n'It's in me to hate thee now, for saying what thou did; but thou're\ndear old Kester after all, and I can't help mysel', I mun needs\nforgive thee,' and she went towards him. He took her little head\nbetween his horny hands and kissed it. She looked up with tears in\nher eyes, saying softly,--\n\n'Niver say things like them again. Niver speak on----'\n\n'A'll bite my tongue off first,' he interrupted.\n\nHe kept his word.\n\nIn all Philip's comings and goings to and from Haytersbank Farm at\nthis time, he never spoke again of his love. In look, words, manner,\nhe was like a thoughtful, tender brother; nothing more. He could be\nnothing more in the presence of the great dread which loomed larger\nupon him after every conversation with the lawyer.\n\nFor Mr. Donkin had been right in his prognostication. Government took\nup the attack on the Rendezvous with a high and heavy hand. It was\nnecessary to assert authority which had been of late too often\nbraved. An example must be made, to strike dismay into those who\nopposed and defied the press-gang; and all the minor authorities who\nheld their powers from Government were in a similar manner severe\nand relentless in the execution of their duty. So the attorney, who\nwent over to see the prisoner in York Castle, told Philip. He added\nthat Daniel still retained his pride in his achievement, and could\nnot be brought to understand the dangerous position in which he was\nplaced; that when pressed and questioned as to circumstances that\nmight possibly be used in his defence, he always wandered off to\naccounts of previous outrages committed by the press-gang, or to\npassionate abuse of the trick by which men had been lured from their\nhomes on the night in question to assist in putting out an imaginary\nfire, and then seized and carried off. Some of this very natural\nindignation might possibly have some effect on the jury; and this\nseemed the only ground of hope, and was indeed a slight one, as the\njudge was likely to warn the jury against allowing their natural\nsympathy in such a case to divert their minds from the real\nquestion.\n\nSuch was the substance of what Philip heard, and heard repeatedly,\nduring his many visits to Mr. Dawson. And now the time of trial drew\nnear; for the York assizes opened on March the twelfth; not much\nabove three weeks since the offence was committed which took Daniel\nfrom his home and placed him in peril of death.\n\nPhilip was glad that, the extremity of his danger never having been\nhinted to Bell, and travelling some forty miles being a most unusual\nexertion at that time to persons of her class, the idea of going to\nsee her husband at York had never suggested itself to Bell's mind.\nHer increasing feebleness made this seem a step only to be taken in\ncase of the fatal extreme necessity; such was the conclusion that\nboth Sylvia and he had come to; and it was the knowledge of this\nthat made Sylvia strangle her own daily longing to see her father.\nNot but that her hopes were stronger than her fears. Philip never\ntold her the causes for despondency; she was young, and she, like\nher father, could not understand how fearful sometimes is the\nnecessity for prompt and severe punishment of rebellion against\nauthority.\n\nPhilip was to be in York during the time of the assizes; and it was\nunderstood, almost without words, that if the terrible worst\noccurred, the wife and daughter were to come to York as soon as\nmight be. For this end Philip silently made all the necessary\narrangements before leaving Monkshaven. The sympathy of all men was\nwith him; it was too large an occasion for Coulson to be anything\nbut magnanimous. He urged Philip to take all the time requisite; to\nleave all business cares to him. And as Philip went about pale and\nsad, there was another cheek that grew paler still, another eye that\nfilled with quiet tears as his heaviness of heart became more and\nmore apparent. The day for opening the assizes came on. Philip was\nin York Minster, watching the solemn antique procession in which the\nhighest authority in the county accompanies the judges to the House\nof the Lord, to be there admonished as to the nature of their\nduties. As Philip listened to the sermon with a strained and beating\nheart, his hopes rose higher than his fears for the first time, and\nthat evening he wrote his first letter to Sylvia.\n\n\n'DEAR SYLVIA,\n\n'It will be longer first than I thought for. Mr. Dawson says Tuesday\nin next week. But keep up your heart. I have been hearing the sermon\nto-day which is preached to the judges; and the clergyman said so\nmuch in it about mercy and forgiveness, I think they cannot fail to\nbe lenient this assize. I have seen uncle, who looks but thin, but\nis in good heart: only he will keep saying he would do it over again\nif he had the chance, which neither Mr. Dawson nor I think is wise in\nhim, in especial as the gaoler is by and hears every word as is\nsaid. He was very fain of hearing all about home; and wants you to\nrear Daisy's calf, as he thinks she will prove a good one. He bade\nme give his best love to you and my aunt, and his kind duty to\nKester.\n\n'Sylvia, will you try and forget how I used to scold you about your\nwriting and spelling, and just write me two or three lines. I think\nI would rather have them badly spelt than not, because then I shall\nbe sure they are yours. And never mind about capitals; I was a fool\nto say such a deal about them, for a man does just as well without\nthem. A letter from you would do a vast to keep me patient all these\ndays till Tuesday. Direct--\n\n'Mr. Philip Hepburn,\n\n  'Care of Mr. Fraser, Draper,\n  'Micklegate, York.\n  'My affectionate duty to my aunt.\n  'Your respectful cousin and servant,\n  'PHILIP HEPBURN.\n\n'P.S. The sermon was grand. The text was Zechariah vii. 9, \"Execute\ntrue judgment and show mercy.\" God grant it may have put mercy into\nthe judge's heart as is to try my uncle.'\n\n\nHeavily the days passed over. On Sunday Bell and Sylvia went to\nchurch, with a strange, half-superstitious feeling, as if they could\npropitiate the Most High to order the events in their favour by\npaying Him the compliment of attending to duties in their time of\nsorrow which they had too often neglected in their prosperous days.\n\nBut He 'who knoweth our frame, and remembereth that we are dust,'\ntook pity upon His children, and sent some of His blessed peace into\ntheir hearts, else they could scarce have endured the agony of\nsuspense of those next hours. For as they came slowly and wearily\nhome from church, Sylvia could no longer bear her secret, but told\nher mother of the peril in which Daniel stood. Cold as the March\nwind blew, they had not felt it, and had sate down on a hedge bank\nfor Bell to rest. And then Sylvia spoke, trembling and sick for\nfear, yet utterly unable to keep silence any longer. Bell heaved up\nher hands, and let them fall down on her knees before she replied.\n\n'The Lord is above us,' said she, solemnly. 'He has sent a fear o'\nthis into my heart afore now. I niver breathed it to thee, my\nlass----'\n\n'And I niver spoke on it to thee, mother, because----'\n\nSylvia choked with crying, and laid her head on her mother's lap,\nfeeling that she was no longer the strong one, and the protector,\nbut the protected. Bell went on, stroking her head,\n\n'The Lord is like a tender nurse as weans a child to look on and to\nlike what it lothed once. He has sent me dreams as has prepared me\nfor this, if so be it comes to pass.\n\n'Philip is hopeful,' said Sylvia, raising her head and looking\nthrough her tears at her mother.\n\n'Ay, he is. And I cannot tell, but I think it's not for nought as\nthe Lord has ta'en away all fear o' death out o' my heart. I think\nHe means as Daniel and me is to go hand-in-hand through the\nvalley--like as we walked up to our wedding in Crosthwaite Church. I\ncould never guide th' house without Daniel, and I should be feared\nhe'd take a deal more nor is good for him without me.'\n\n'But me, mother, thou's forgetting me,' moaned out Sylvia. 'Oh,\nmother, mother, think on me!'\n\n'Nay, my lass, I'm noane forgetting yo'. I'd a sore heart a' last\nwinter a-thinking on thee, when that chap Kinraid were hanging about\nthee. I'll noane speak ill on the dead, but I were uneasylike. But\nsin' Philip and thee seem to ha' made it up----'\n\nSylvia shivered, and opened her mouth to speak, but did not say a\nword.\n\n'And sin' the Lord has been comforting me, and talking to me many a\ntime when thou's thought I were asleep, things has seemed to redd\ntheirselves up, and if Daniel goes, I'm ready to follow. I could\nniver stand living to hear folks say he'd been hung; it seems so\nunnatural and shameful.'\n\n'But, mother, he won't!--he shan't be hung!' said Sylvia, springing\nto her feet. 'Philip says he won't.'\n\nBell shook her head. They walked on, Sylvia both disheartened and\nalmost irritated at her mother's despondency. But before they went\nto bed at night Bell said things which seemed as though the\nmorning's feelings had been but temporary, and as if she was\nreferring every decision to the period of her husband's return.\n'When father comes home,' seemed a sort of burden at the beginning\nor end of every sentence, and this reliance on his certain coming\nback to them was almost as great a trial to Sylvia as the absence of\nall hope had been in the morning. But that instinct told her that\nher mother was becoming incapable of argument, she would have asked\nher why her views were so essentially changed in so few hours. This\ninability of reason in poor Bell made Sylvia feel very desolate.\n\nMonday passed over--how, neither of them knew, for neither spoke of\nwhat was filling the thoughts of both. Before it was light on\nTuesday morning, Bell was astir.\n\n'It's very early, mother,' said weary, sleepy Sylvia, dreading\nreturning consciousness.\n\n'Ay, lass!' said Bell, in a brisk, cheerful tone; 'but he'll, maybe,\nbe home to-night, and I'se bound to have all things ready for him.'\n\n'Anyhow,' said Sylvia, sitting up in bed, 'he couldn't come home\nto-night.'\n\n'Tut, lass! thou doesn't know how quick a man comes home to wife and\nchild. I'll be a' ready at any rate.'\n\nShe hurried about in a way which Sylvia wondered to see; till at\nlength she fancied that perhaps her mother did so to drive away\nthought. Every place was cleaned; there was scarce time allowed for\nbreakfast; till at last, long before mid-day, all the work was done,\nand the two sat down to their spinning-wheels. Sylvia's spirits sank\nlower and lower at each speech of her mother's, from whose mind all\nfear seemed to have disappeared, leaving only a strange restless\nkind of excitement.\n\n'It's time for t' potatoes,' said Bell, after her wool had snapped\nmany a time from her uneven tread.\n\n'Mother,' said Sylvia, 'it's but just gone ten!'\n\n'Put 'em on,' said Bell, without attending to the full meaning of\nher daughter's words. 'It'll, maybe, hasten t' day on if we get\ndinner done betimes.'\n\n'But Kester is in t' Far Acre field, and he'll not be home till\nnoon.'\n\nThis seemed to settle matters for a while; but then Bell pushed her\nwheel away, and began searching for her hood and cloak. Sylvia found\nthem for her, and then asked sadly--\n\n'What does ta want 'em for, mother?'\n\n'I'll go up t' brow and through t' field, and just have a look down\nt' lane.'\n\n'I'll go wi' thee,' said Sylvia, feeling all the time the\nuselessness of any looking for intelligence from York so early in\nthe day. Very patiently did she wait by her mother's side during the\nlong half-hour which Bell spent in gazing down the road for those\nwho never came.\n\nWhen they got home Sylvia put the potatoes on to boil; but when\ndinner was ready and the three were seated at the dresser, Bell\npushed her plate away from her, saying it was so long after dinner\ntime that she was past eating. Kester would have said something\nabout its being only half-past twelve, but Sylvia gave him a look\nbeseeching silence, and he went on with his dinner without a word,\nonly brushing away the tears from his eyes with the back of his hand\nfrom time to time.\n\n'A'll noane go far fra' home t' rest o' t' day,' said he, in a\nwhisper to Sylvia, as he went out.\n\n'Will this day niver come to an end?' cried Bell, plaintively.\n\n'Oh, mother! it'll come to an end some time, never fear. I've heerd\nsay--\n\"Be the day weary or be the day long,\nAt length it ringeth to even-song.\"'\n\n'To even-song--to even-song,' repeated Bell. 'D'ye think now that\neven-song means death, Sylvie?'\n\n'I cannot tell--I cannot bear it. Mother,' said Sylvia, in despair,\n'I'll make some clap-bread: that's a heavy job, and will while away\nt' afternoon.'\n\n'Ay, do!' replied the mother. 'He'll like it fresh--he'll like it\nfresh.'\n\nMurmuring and talking to herself, she fell into a doze, from which\nSylvia was careful not to disturb her.\n\nThe days were now getting long, although as cold as ever; and at\nHaytersbank Farm the light lingered, as there was no near horizon to\nbring on early darkness. Sylvia had all ready for her mother's tea\nagainst she wakened; but she slept on and on, the peaceful sleep of\na child, and Sylvia did not care to waken her. Just after the sun\nhad set, she saw Kester outside the window making signs to her to\ncome out. She stole out on tip-toe by the back-kitchen, the door of\nwhich was standing open. She almost ran against Philip, who did not\nperceive her, as he was awaiting her coming the other way round the\ncorner of the house, and who turned upon her a face whose import she\nread in an instant. 'Philip!' was all she said, and then she fainted\nat his feet, coming down with a heavy bang on the round paving\nstones of the yard.\n\n'Kester! Kester!' he cried, for she looked like one dead, and with\nall his strength the wearied man could not lift her and carry her\ninto the house.\n\nWith Kester's help she was borne into the back-kitchen, and Kester\nrushed to the pump for some cold water to throw over her.\n\nWhile Philip, kneeling at her head, was partly supporting her in his\narms, and heedless of any sight or sound, the shadow of some one\nfell upon him. He looked up and saw his aunt; the old dignified,\nsensible expression on her face, exactly like her former self,\ncomposed, strong, and calm.\n\n'My lass,' said she, sitting down by Philip, and gently taking her\nout of his arms into her own. 'Lass, bear up! we mun bear up, and be\nagait on our way to him, he'll be needing us now. Bear up, my lass!\nthe Lord will give us strength. We mun go to him; ay, time's\nprecious; thou mun cry thy cry at after!'\n\nSylvia opened her dim eyes, and heard her mother's voice; the ideas\ncame slowly into her mind, and slowly she rose up, standing still,\nlike one who has been stunned, to regain her strength; and then,\ntaking hold of her mother's arm, she said, in a soft, strange\nvoice--\n\n'Let's go. I'm ready.'\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVIII\n\nTHE ORDEAL\n\n\nIt was the afternoon of an April day in that same year, and the sky\nwas blue above, with little sailing white clouds catching the\npleasant sunlight. The earth in that northern country had scarcely\nyet put on her robe of green. The few trees grew near brooks running\ndown from the moors and the higher ground. The air was full of\npleasant sounds prophesying of the coming summer. The rush, and\nmurmur, and tinkle of the hidden watercourses; the song of the lark\npoised high up in the sunny air; the bleat of the lambs calling to\ntheir mothers--everything inanimate was full of hope and gladness.\n\nFor the first time for a mournful month the front door of\nHaytersbank Farm was open; the warm spring air might enter, and\ndisplace the sad dark gloom, if it could. There was a newly-lighted\nfire in the unused grate; and Kester was in the kitchen, with his\nclogs off his feet, so as not to dirty the spotless floor, stirring\nhere and there, and trying in his awkward way to make things look\nhome-like and cheerful. He had brought in some wild daffodils which\nhe had been to seek in the dawn, and he placed them in a jug on the\ndresser. Dolly Reid, the woman who had come to help Sylvia during\nher mother's illness a year ago, was attending to something in the\nback-kitchen, making a noise among the milk-cans, and singing a\nballad to herself as she worked; yet every now and then she checked\nherself in her singing, as if a sudden recollection came upon her\nthat this was neither the time nor the place for songs. Once or\ntwice she took up the funeral psalm which is sung by the bearers of\nthe body in that country--\n\nOur God, our help in ages past.\n\nBut it was of no use: the pleasant April weather out of doors, and\nperhaps the natural spring in the body, disposed her nature to\ncheerfulness, and insensibly she returned to her old ditty.\n\nKester was turning over many things in his rude honest mind as he\nstood there, giving his finishing touches every now and then to the\naspect of the house-place, in preparation for the return of the\nwidow and daughter of his old master.\n\nIt was a month and more since they had left home; more than a\nfortnight since Kester, with three halfpence in his pocket, had set\nout after his day's work to go to York--to walk all night long, and\nto wish Daniel Robson his last farewell.\n\nDaniel had tried to keep up and had brought out one or two familiar,\nthread-bare, well-worn jokes, such as he had made Kester chuckle\nover many a time and oft, when the two had been together afield or\nin the shippen at the home which he should never more see. But no\n'Old Grouse in the gunroom' could make Kester smile, or do anything\nexcept groan in but a heart-broken sort of fashion, and presently\nthe talk had become more suitable to the occasion, Daniel being up\nto the last the more composed of the two; for Kester, when turned\nout of the condemned cell, fairly broke down into the heavy sobbing\nhe had never thought to sob again on earth. He had left Bell and\nSylvia in their lodging at York, under Philip's care; he dared not\ngo to see them; he could not trust himself; he had sent them his\nduty, and bade Philip tell Sylvia that the game-hen had brought out\nfifteen chickens at a hatch.\n\nYet although Kester sent this message through Philip--although he\nsaw and recognized all that Philip was doing in their behalf, in the\nbehalf of Daniel Robson, the condemned felon, his honoured master--he\nliked Hepburn not a whit better than he had done before all this\nsorrow had come upon them.\n\nPhilip had, perhaps, shown a want of tact in his conduct to Kester.\nAcute with passionate keenness in one direction, he had a sort of\ndull straightforwardness in all others. For instance, he had\nreturned Kester the money which the latter had so gladly advanced\ntowards the expenses incurred in defending Daniel. Now the money\nwhich Philip gave him back was part of an advance which Foster\nBrothers had made on Philip's own account. Philip had thought that\nit was hard on Kester to lose his savings in a hopeless cause, and\nhad made a point of repaying the old man; but Kester would far\nrather have felt that the earnings of the sweat of his brow had gone\nin the attempt to save his master's life than have had twice ten\ntimes as many golden guineas.\n\nMoreover, it seemed to take his action in lending his hoard out of\nthe sphere of love, and make it but a leaden common loan, when it\nwas Philip who brought him the sum, not Sylvia, into whose hands he\nhad given it.\n\nWith these feelings Kester felt his heart shut up as he saw the\nlong-watched-for two coming down the little path with a third\nperson; with Philip holding up the failing steps of poor Bell\nRobson, as, loaded with her heavy mourning, and feeble from the\nillness which had detained her in York ever since the day of her\nhusband's execution, she came faltering back to her desolate home.\nSylvia was also occupied in attending to her mother; one or twice,\nwhen they paused a little, she and Philip spoke, in the familiar way\nin which there is no coyness nor reserve. Kester caught up his\nclogs, and went quickly out through the back-kitchen into the\nfarm-yard, not staying to greet them, as he had meant to do; and yet\nit was dull-sighted of him not to have perceived that whatever might\nbe the relations between Philip and Sylvia, he was sure to have\naccompanied them home; for, alas! he was the only male protector of\ntheir blood remaining in the world. Poor Kester, who would fain have\ntaken that office upon himself, chose to esteem himself cast off,\nand went heavily about the farmyard, knowing that he ought to go in\nand bid such poor welcome as he had to offer, yet feeling too much\nto like to show himself before Philip.\n\nIt was long, too, before any one had leisure to come and seek him.\nBell's mind had flashed up for a time, till the fatal day, only to\nbe reduced by her subsequent illness into complete and hopeless\nchildishness. It was all Philip and Sylvia could do to manage her in\nthe first excitement of returning home; her restless inquiry for him\nwho would never more be present in the familiar scene, her feverish\nweariness and uneasiness, all required tender soothing and most\npatient endurance of her refusals to be satisfied with what they\nsaid or did.\n\nAt length she took some food, and, refreshed by it, and warmed by\nthe fire, she sank asleep in her chair. Then Philip would fain have\nspoken with Sylvia before the hour came at which he must return to\nMonkshaven, but she eluded him, and went in search of Kester, whose\npresence she had missed.\n\nShe had guessed some of the causes which kept him from greeting them\non their first return. But it was not as if she had shaped these\ncauses into the definite form of words. It is astonishing to look\nback and find how differently constituted were the minds of most\npeople fifty or sixty years ago; they felt, they understood, without\ngoing through reasoning or analytic processes, and if this was the\ncase among the more educated people, of course it was still more so\nin the class to which Sylvia belonged. She knew by some sort of\nintuition that if Philip accompanied them home (as, indeed, under\nthe circumstances, was so natural as to be almost unavoidable), the\nold servant and friend of the family would absent himself; and so\nshe slipped away at the first possible moment to go in search of\nhim. There he was in the farm-yard, leaning over the gate that\nopened into the home-field, apparently watching the poultry that\nscratched and pecked at the new-springing grass with the utmost\nrelish. A little farther off were the ewes with their new-dropped\nlambs, beyond that the great old thorn-tree with its round fresh\nclusters of buds, again beyond that there was a glimpse of the vast\nsunny rippling sea; but Sylvia knew well that Kester was looking at\nnone of these things. She went up to him and touched his arm. He\nstarted from his reverie, and turned round upon her with his dim\neyes full of unshed tears. When he saw her black dress, her deep\nmourning, he had hard work to keep from breaking out, but by dint of\na good brush of his eyes with the back of his hand, and a moment's\npause, he could look at her again with tolerable calmness.\n\n'Why, Kester: why didst niver come to speak to us?' said Sylvia,\nfinding it necessary to be cheerful if she could.\n\n'A dun know; niver ax me. A say, they'n gi'en Dick Simpson' (whose\nevidence had been all material against poor Daniel Robson at the\ntrial) 'a' t' rotten eggs and fou' things they could o' Saturday,\nthey did,' continued he, in a tone of satisfaction; 'ay, and they\nniver stopped t' see whether t' eggs were rotten or fresh when their\nblood was up--nor whether stones was hard or soft,' he added, in a\nlower tone, and chuckling a little.\n\nSylvia was silent. He looked at her now, chuckling still. Her face\nwas white, her lips tightened, her eyes a-flame. She drew a long\nbreath.\n\n'I wish I'd been theere! I wish I could do him an ill turn,' sighed\nshe, with some kind of expression on her face that made Kester quail\na little.\n\n'Nay, lass! he'll get it fra' others. Niver fret thysel' about sich\nrubbish. A'n done ill to speak on him.'\n\n'No! thou hasn't. Then as was friends o' father's I'll love for iver\nand iver; them as helped for t' hang him' (she shuddered from head\nto foot--a sharp irrepressible shudder!) 'I'll niver\nforgive--niver!'\n\n'Niver's a long word,' said Kester, musingly. 'A could horsewhip\nhim, or cast stones at him, or duck him mysel'; but, lass! niver's a\nlong word!'\n\n'Well! niver heed if it is--it's me as said it, and I'm turned\nsavage late days. Come in, Kester, and see poor mother.'\n\n'A cannot,' said he, turning his wrinkled puckered face away, that\nshe might not see the twitchings of emotion on it. 'There's kine to\nbe fetched up, and what not, and he's theere, isn't he, Sylvie?'\nfacing round upon her with inquisitiveness. Under his peering eyes\nshe reddened a little.\n\n'Yes, if it's Philip thou means; he's been all we've had to look to\nsin'.' Again the shudder.\n\n'Well, now he'll be seein' after his shop, a reckon?'\n\nSylvia was calling to the old mare nibbling tufts of early-springing\ngrass here and there, and half unconsciously coaxing the creature to\ncome up to the gate to be stroked. But she heard Kester's words well\nenough, and so he saw, although she made this excuse not to reply.\nBut Kester was not to be put off.\n\n'Folks is talkin' about thee and him; thou'll ha' to mind lest thee\nand him gets yo'r names coupled together.'\n\n'It's right down cruel on folks, then,' said she, crimsoning from\nsome emotion. 'As if any man as was a man wouldn't do all he could\nfor two lone women at such a time--and he a cousin, too! Tell me who\nsaid so,' continued she, firing round at Kester, 'and I'll niver\nforgive 'em--that's all.'\n\n'Hoots!' said Kester, a little conscious that he himself was the\nprincipal representative of that name of multitude folk. 'Here's a\npretty lass; she's' got \"a'll niver forgi'e\" at her tongue's end wi'\na vengeance.'\n\nSylvia was a little confused.\n\n'Oh, Kester, man,' said she, 'my heart is sore again' every one, for\nfeyther's sake.'\n\nAnd at length the natural relief of plentiful tears came; and\nKester, with instinctive wisdom, let her weep undisturbed; indeed,\nhe cried not a little himself. They were interrupted by Philip's\nvoice from the back-door.\n\n'Sylvie, your mother's awake, and wants you!'\n\n'Come, Kester, come,' and taking hold of him she drew him with her\ninto the house.\n\nBell rose as they came in, holding by the arms of the chair. At\nfirst she received Kester as though he had been a stranger.\n\n'I'm glad to see yo', sir; t' master's out, but he'll be in afore\nlong. It'll be about t' lambs yo're come, mebbe?'\n\n'Mother!' said Sylvia, 'dunnot yo' see? it's Kester,--Kester, wi'\nhis Sunday clothes on.'\n\n'Kester! ay, sure it is; my eyes have getten so sore and dim of\nlate; just as if I'd been greeting. I'm sure, lad, I'm glad to see\nthee! It's a long time I've been away, but it were not\npleasure-seeking as took me, it were business o' some mak'--tell\nhim, Sylvie, what it were, for my head's clean gone. I only know I\nwouldn't ha' left home if I could ha' helped it; for I think I\nshould ha' kept my health better if I'd bided at home wi' my master.\nI wonder as he's not comed in for t' bid me welcome? Is he far\nafield, think ye, Kester?'\n\nKester looked at Sylvia, mutely imploring her to help him out in the\ndilemma of answering, but she was doing all she could to help\ncrying. Philip came to the rescue.\n\n'Aunt,' said he, 'the clock has stopped; can you tell me where t'\nfind t' key, and I'll wind it up.'\n\n'T' key,' said she, hurriedly, 't' key, it's behind th' big Bible on\nyon shelf. But I'd rayther thou wouldn't touch it, lad; it's t'\nmaster's work, and he distrusts folk meddling wi' it.'\n\nDay after day there was this constant reference to her dead husband.\nIn one sense it was a blessing; all the circumstances attendant on\nhis sad and untimely end were swept out of her mind along with the\nrecollection of the fact itself. She referred to him as absent, and\nhad always some plausible way of accounting for it, which satisfied\nher own mind; and, accordingly they fell into the habit of humouring\nher, and speaking of him as gone to Monkshaven, or afield, or\nwearied out, and taking a nap upstairs, as her fancy led her to\nbelieve for the moment. But this forgetfulness, though happy for\nherself, was terrible for her child. It was a constant renewing of\nSylvia's grief, while her mother could give her no sympathy, no\nhelp, or strength in any circumstances that arose out of this grief.\nShe was driven more and more upon Philip; his advice and his\naffection became daily more necessary to her.\n\nKester saw what would be the end of all this more clearly than\nSylvia did herself; and, impotent to hinder what he feared and\ndisliked, he grew more and more surly every day. Yet he tried to\nlabour hard and well for the interests of the family, as if they\nwere bound up in his good management of the cattle and land. He was\nout and about by the earliest dawn, working all day long with might\nand main. He bought himself a pair of new spectacles, which might,\nhe fancied, enable him to read the _Farmer's Complete Guide_, his\ndead master's _vade-mecum_. But he had never learnt more than his\ncapital letters, and had forgotten many of them; so the spectacles\ndid him but little good. Then he would take the book to Sylvia, and\nask her to read to him the instructions he needed; instructions, be\nit noted, that he would formerly have despised as mere\nbook-learning: but his present sense of responsibility had made him\nhumble.\n\nSylvia would find the place with all deliberation: and putting her\nfinger under the line to keep the exact place of the word she was\nreading, she would strive in good earnest to read out the directions\ngiven; but when every fourth word had to be spelt, it was rather\nhopeless work, especially as all these words were unintelligible to\nthe open-mouthed listener, however intent he might be. He had\ngenerally to fall back on his own experience; and, guided by that,\nthings were not doing badly in his estimation, when, one day, Sylvia\nsaid to him, as they were in the hay-field, heaping up the hay into\ncocks with Dolly Reid's assistance--\n\n'Kester--I didn't tell thee--there were a letter from Measter Hall,\nLord Malton's steward, that came last night and that Philip read\nme.'\n\nShe stopped for a moment.\n\n'Ay, lass! Philip read it thee, and whatten might it say?'\n\n'Only that he had an offer for Haytersbank Farm, and would set\nmother free to go as soon as t' crops was off t' ground.'\n\nShe sighed a little as she said this.\n\n\"'Only!\" sayst ta? Whatten business has he for to go an' offer to\nlet t' farm afore iver he were told as yo' wished to leave it?'\nobserved Kester, in high dudgeon.\n\n'Oh!' replied Sylvia, throwing down her rake, as if weary of life.\n'What could we do wi' t' farm and land? If it were all dairy I might\nha' done, but wi' so much on it arable.'\n\n'And if 'tis arable is not I allays to t' fore?'\n\n'Oh, man, dunnot find fault wi' me! I'm just fain to lie down and\ndie, if it were not for mother.'\n\n'Ay! thy mother will be sore unsettled if thou's for quitting\nHaytersbank,' said merciless Kester.\n\n'I cannot help it; I cannot help it! What can I do? It would take\ntwo pair o' men's hands to keep t' land up as Measter Hall likes it;\nand beside----'\n\n'Beside what?' said Kester, looking up at her with his sudden odd\nlook, one eye shut, the other open: there she stood, her two hands\nclasped tight together, her eyes filling with tears, her face pale\nand sad. 'Beside what?' he asked again, sharply.\n\n'T' answer's sent to Measter Hall--Philip wrote it last night; so\nthere's no use planning and fretting, it were done for t' best, and\nmun be done.' She stooped and picked up her rake, and began tossing\nthe hay with energy, the tears streaming down her cheeks unheeded.\nIt was Kester's turn to throw down his rake. She took no notice, he\ndid not feel sure that she had observed his action. He began to walk\ntowards the field-gate; this movement did catch her eye, for in a\nminute her hand was on his arm, and she was stooping forward to look\ninto his face. It was working and twitching with emotion. 'Kester!\noh, man! speak out, but dunnot leave me a this-ns. What could I ha'\ndone? Mother is gone dateless wi' sorrow, and I am but a young lass,\ni' years I mean; for I'm old enough wi' weeping.'\n\n'I'd ha' put up for t' farm mysel', sooner than had thee turned\nout,' said Kester, in a low voice; then working himself up into a\npassion, as a new suspicion crossed his mind, he added, 'An' what\nfor didn't yo' tell me on t' letter? Yo' were in a mighty hurry to\nsettle it a', and get rid on t' oud place.'\n\n'Measter Hall had sent a notice to quit on Midsummer day; but Philip\nhad answered it hisself. Thou knows I'm not good at reading writing,\n'special when a letter's full o' long words, and Philip had ta'en it\nin hand to answer.'\n\n'Wi'out asking thee?'\n\nSylvia went on without minding the interruption.\n\n'And Measter Hall makes a good offer, for t' man as is going to come\nin will take t' stock and a' t' implements; and if mother--if we--if\nI--like, th' furniture and a'----'\n\n'Furniture!' said Kester, in grim surprise. 'What's to come o' t'\nmissus and thee, that yo'll not need a bed to lie on, or a pot to\nboil yo'r vittel in?'\n\nSylvia reddened, but kept silence.\n\n'Cannot yo' speak?'\n\n'Oh, Kester, I didn't think thou'd turn again' me, and me so\nfriendless. It's as if I'd been doin' something wrong, and I have so\nstriven to act as is best; there's mother as well as me to be\nthought on.'\n\n'Cannot yo' answer a question?' said Kester, once more. 'Whatten's\nup that t' missus and yo'll not need bed and table, pots and pans?'\n\n'I think I'm going to marry Philip,' said Sylvia, in so low a tone,\nthat if Kester had not suspected what her answer was to be, he could\nnot have understood it.\n\nAfter a moment's pause he recommenced his walk towards the\nfield-gate. But she went after him and held him tight by the arm,\nspeaking rapidly.\n\n'Kester, what could I do? What can I do? He's my cousin, and mother\nknows him, and likes him; and he's been so good to us in a' this\ntime o' trouble and heavy grief, and he'll keep mother in comfort\nall t' rest of her days.'\n\n'Ay, and thee in comfort. There's a deal in a well-filled purse in a\nwench's eyes, or one would ha' thought it weren't so easy forgettin'\nyon lad as loved thee as t' apple on his eye.'\n\n'Kester, Kester,' she cried, 'I've niver forgotten Charley; I think\non him, I see him ivery night lying drowned at t' bottom o' t' sea.\nForgetten him! Man! it's easy talking!' She was like a wild creature\nthat sees its young, but is unable to reach it without a deadly\nspring, and yet is preparing to take that fatal leap. Kester himself\nwas almost startled, and yet it was as if he must go on torturing\nher.\n\n'An' who telled thee so sure and certain as he were drowned? He\nmight ha' been carried off by t' press-gang as well as other men.'\n\n'Oh! if I were but dead that I might know all!' cried she, flinging\nherself down on the hay.\n\nKester kept silence. Then she sprang up again, and looking with\neager wistfulness into his face, she said,--\n\n'Tell me t' chances. Tell me quick! Philip's very good, and kind,\nand he says he shall die if I will not marry him, and there's no\nhome for mother and me,--no home for her, for as for me I dunnot\ncare what becomes on me; but if Charley's alive I cannot marry\nPhilip--no, not if he dies for want o' me--and as for mother, poor\nmother, Kester, it's an awful strait; only first tell me if there's\na chance, just one in a thousand, only one in a hundred thousand, as\nCharley were ta'en by t' gang?' She was breathless by this time,\nwhat with her hurried words, and what with the beating of her heart.\nKester took time to answer. He had spoken before too hastily, this\ntime he weighed his words.\n\n'Kinraid went away from this here place t' join his ship. An' he\nniver joined it no more; an' t' captain an' all his friends at\nNewcassel as iver were, made search for him, on board t' king's\nships. That's more nor fifteen month ago, an' nought has iver been\nheerd on him by any man. That's what's to be said on one side o' t'\nmatter. Then on t' other there's this as is known. His hat were cast\nup by t' sea wi' a ribbon in it, as there's reason t' think as he'd\nnot ha' parted wi' so quick if he'd had his own will.'\n\n'But yo' said as he might ha' been carried off by t' gang--yo' did,\nKester, tho' now yo're a' for t' other side.'\n\n'My lass, a'd fain have him alive, an' a dunnot fancy Philip for thy\nhusband; but it's a serious judgment as thou's put me on, an' a'm\ntrying it fair. There's allays one chance i' a thousand as he's\nalive, for no man iver saw him dead. But t' gang were noane about\nMonkshaven then: there were niver a tender on t' coast nearer than\nShields, an' those theere were searched.'\n\nHe did not say any more, but turned back into the field, and took up\nhis hay-making again.\n\nSylvia stood quite still, thinking, and wistfully longing for some\nkind of certainty.\n\nKester came up to her.\n\n'Sylvie, thou knows Philip paid me back my money, and it were eight\npound fifteen and three-pence; and t' hay and stock 'll sell for\nsummat above t' rent; and a've a sister as is a decent widow-woman,\ntho' but badly off, livin' at Dale End; and if thee and thy mother\n'll go live wi' her, a'll give thee well on to all a can earn, and\nit'll be a matter o' five shilling a week. But dunnot go and marry a\nman as thou's noane taken wi', and another as is most like for t' be\ndead, but who, mebbe, is alive, havin' a pull on thy heart.'\n\nSylvia began to cry as if her heart was broken. She had promised\nherself more fully to Philip the night before than she had told\nKester; and, with some pains and much patience, her cousin, her\nlover, alas! her future husband, had made the fact clear to the\nbewildered mind of her poor mother, who had all day long shown that\nher mind and heart were full of the subject, and that the\ncontemplation of it was giving her as much peace as she could ever\nknow. And now Kester's words came to call up echoes in the poor\ngirl's heart. Just as she was in this miserable state, wishing that\nthe grave lay open before her, and that she could lie down, and be\ncovered up by the soft green turf from all the bitter sorrows and\ncarking cares and weary bewilderments of this life; wishing that her\nfather was alive, that Charley was once more here; that she had not\nrepeated the solemn words by which she had promised herself to\nPhilip only the very evening before, she heard a soft, low whistle,\nand, looking round unconsciously, there was her lover and affianced\nhusband, leaning on the gate, and gazing into the field with\npassionate eyes, devouring the fair face and figure of her, his\nfuture wife.\n\n'Oh, Kester,' said she once more, 'what mun I do? I'm pledged to him\nas strong as words can make it, and mother blessed us both wi' more\nsense than she's had for weeks. Kester, man, speak! Shall I go and\nbreak it all off?--say.'\n\n'Nay, it's noane for me t' say; m'appen thou's gone too far. Them\nabove only knows what is best.'\n\nAgain that long, cooing whistle. 'Sylvie!'\n\n'He's been very kind to us all,' said Sylvia, laying her rake down\nwith slow care, 'and I'll try t' make him happy.'\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIX\n\nWEDDING RAIMENT\n\n\nPhilip and Sylvia were engaged. It was not so happy a state of\nthings as Philip had imagined. He had already found that out,\nalthough it was not twenty-four hours since Sylvia had promised to\nbe his. He could not have defined why he was dissatisfied; if he had\nbeen compelled to account for his feeling, he would probably have\nalleged as a reason that Sylvia's manner was so unchanged by her new\nposition towards him. She was quiet and gentle; but no shyer, no\nbrighter, no coyer, no happier, than she had been for months before.\nWhen she joined him at the field-gate, his heart was beating fast,\nhis eyes were beaming out love at her approach. She neither blushed\nnor smiled, but seemed absorbed in thought of some kind. But she\nresisted his silent effort to draw her away from the path leading to\nthe house, and turned her face steadily homewards. He murmured soft\nwords, which she scarcely heard. Right in their way was the stone\ntrough for the fresh bubbling water, that, issuing from a roadside\nspring, served for all the household purposes of Haytersbank Farm.\nBy it were the milk-cans, glittering and clean. Sylvia knew she\nshould have to stop for these, and carry them back home in readiness\nfor the evening's milking; and at this time, during this action, she\nresolved to say what was on her mind.\n\nThey were there. Sylvia spoke.\n\n'Philip, Kester has been saying as how it might ha' been----'\n\n'Well!' said Philip.\n\nSylvia sate down on the edge of the trough, and dipped her hot\nlittle hand in the water. Then she went on quickly, and lifting her\nbeautiful eyes to Philip's face, with a look of inquiry--'He thinks\nas Charley Kinraid may ha' been took by t' press-gang.'\n\nIt was the first time she had named the name of her former lover to\nher present one since the day, long ago now, when they had\nquarrelled about him; and the rosy colour flushed her all over; but\nher sweet, trustful eyes never flinched from their steady,\nunconscious gaze.\n\nPhilip's heart stopped beating; literally, as if he had come to a\nsudden precipice, while he had thought himself securely walking on\nsunny greensward. He went purple all over from dismay; he dared not\ntake his eyes away from that sad, earnest look of hers, but he was\nthankful that a mist came before them and drew a veil before his\nbrain. He heard his own voice saying words he did not seem to have\nframed in his own mind.\n\n'Kester's a d--d fool,' he growled.\n\n'He says there's mebbe but one chance i' a hundred,' said Sylvia,\npleading, as it were, for Kester; 'but oh! Philip, think yo' there's\njust that one chance?'\n\n'Ay, there's a chance, sure enough,' said Philip, in a kind of\nfierce despair that made him reckless what he said or did. 'There's\na chance, I suppose, for iverything i' life as we have not seen with\nour own eyes as it may not ha' happened. Kester may say next as\nthere's a chance as your father is not dead, because we none on us\nsaw him----'\n\n'Hung,' he was going to have said, but a touch of humanity came back\ninto his stony heart. Sylvia sent up a little sharp cry at his\nwords. He longed at the sound to take her in his arms and hush her\nup, as a mother hushes her weeping child. But the very longing,\nhaving to be repressed, only made him more beside himself with\nguilt, anxiety, and rage. They were quite still now. Sylvia looking\nsadly down into the bubbling, merry, flowing water: Philip glaring\nat her, wishing that the next word were spoken, though it might stab\nhim to the heart. But she did not speak.\n\nAt length, unable to bear it any longer, he said, 'Thou sets a deal\no' store on that man, Sylvie.'\n\nIf 'that man' had been there at the moment, Philip would have\ngrappled with him, and not let go his hold till one or the other\nwere dead. Sylvia caught some of the passionate meaning of the\ngloomy, miserable tone of Philip's voice as he said these words. She\nlooked up at him.\n\n'I thought yo' knowed that I cared a deal for him.'\n\nThere was something so pleading and innocent in her pale, troubled\nface, so pathetic in her tone, that Philip's anger, which had been\nexcited against her, as well as against all the rest of the world,\nmelted away into love; and once more he felt that have her for his\nown he must, at any cost. He sate down by her, and spoke to her in\nquite a different manner to that which he had used before, with a\nready tact and art which some strange instinct or tempter 'close at\nhis ear' supplied.\n\n'Yes, darling, I knew yo' cared for him. I'll not say ill of him\nthat is--dead--ay, dead and drowned--whativer Kester may\nsay--before now; but if I chose I could tell tales.'\n\n'No! tell no tales; I'll not hear them,' said she, wrenching herself\nout of Philip's clasping arm. 'They may misca' him for iver, and\nI'll not believe 'em.'\n\n'I'll niver miscall one who is dead,' said Philip; each new\nunconscious sign of the strength of Sylvia's love for her former\nlover only making him the more anxious to convince her that he was\ndead, only rendering him more keen at deceiving his own conscience\nby repeating to it the lie that long ere this Kinraid was in all\nprobability dead--killed by either the chances of war or tempestuous\nsea; that, even if not, he was as good as dead to her; so that the\nword 'dead' might be used in all honest certainty, as in one of its\nmeanings Kinraid was dead for sure.\n\n'Think yo' that if he were not dead he wouldn't ha' written ere this\nto some one of his kin, if not to thee? Yet none of his folk\nNewcassel-way but believe him dead.'\n\n'So Kester says,' sighed Sylvia.\n\nPhilip took heart. He put his arm softly round her again, and\nmurmured--\n\n'My lassie, try not to think on them as is gone, as is dead, but t'\nthink a bit more on him as loves yo' wi' heart, and soul, and might,\nand has done iver sin' he first set eyes on yo'. Oh, Sylvie, my love\nfor thee is just terrible.'\n\nAt this moment Dolly Reid was seen at the back-door of the\nfarmhouse, and catching sight of Sylvia, she called out--\n\n'Sylvia, thy mother is axing for thee, and I cannot make her mind\neasy.'\n\nIn a moment Sylvia had sprung up from her seat, and was running in\nto soothe and comfort her mother's troubled fancies.\n\nPhilip sate on by the well-side, his face buried in his two hands.\nPresently he lifted himself up, drank some water eagerly out of his\nhollowed palm, sighed, and shook himself, and followed his cousin\ninto the house. Sometimes he came unexpectedly to the limits of his\ninfluence over her. In general she obeyed his expressed wishes with\ngentle indifference, as if she had no preferences of her own; once\nor twice he found that she was doing what he desired out of the\nspirit of obedience, which, as her mother's daughter, she believed\nto be her duty towards her affianced husband. And this last motive\nfor action depressed her lover more than anything. He wanted the old\nSylvia back again; captious, capricious, wilful, haughty, merry,\ncharming. Alas! that Sylvia was gone for ever.\n\nBut once especially his power, arising from whatever cause, was\nstopped entirely short--was utterly of no avail.\n\nIt was on the occasion of Dick Simpson's mortal illness. Sylvia and\nher mother kept aloof from every one. They had never been intimate\nwith any family but the Corneys, and even this friendship had\nconsiderably cooled since Molly's marriage, and most especially\nsince Kinraid's supposed death, when Bessy Corney and Sylvia had\nbeen, as it were, rival mourners. But many people, both in\nMonkshaven and the country round about, held the Robson family in\ngreat respect, although Mrs. Robson herself was accounted 'high' and\n'distant;' and poor little Sylvia, in her heyday of beautiful youth\nand high spirits, had been spoken of as 'a bit flighty,' and 'a\nset-up lassie.' Still, when their great sorrow fell upon them, there\nwere plenty of friends to sympathize deeply with them; and, as\nDaniel had suffered in a popular cause, there were even more who,\nscarcely knowing them personally, were ready to give them all the\nmarks of respect and friendly feeling in their power. But neither\nBell nor Sylvia were aware of this. The former had lost all\nperception of what was not immediately before her; the latter shrank\nfrom all encounters of any kind with a sore heart, and sensitive\navoidance of everything that could make her a subject of remark. So\nthe poor afflicted people at Haytersbank knew little of Monkshaven\nnews. What little did come to their ears came through Dolly Reid,\nwhen she returned from selling the farm produce of the week; and\noften, indeed, even then she found Sylvia too much absorbed in other\ncares or thoughts to listen to her gossip. So no one had ever named\nthat Simpson was supposed to be dying till Philip began on the\nsubject one evening. Sylvia's face suddenly flashed into glow and\nlife.\n\n'He's dying, is he? t' earth is well rid on such a fellow!'\n\n'Eh, Sylvie, that's a hard speech o' thine!' said Philip; 'it gives\nme but poor heart to ask a favour of thee!'\n\n'If it's aught about Simpson,' replied she, and then she interrupted\nherself. 'But say on; it were ill-mannered in me for t' interrupt\nyo'.'\n\n'Thou would be sorry to see him, I think, Sylvie. He cannot get over\nthe way, t' folk met him, and pelted him when he came back fra'\nYork,--and he's weak and faint, and beside himself at times; and\nhe'll lie a dreaming, and a-fancying they're all at him again,\nhooting, and yelling, and pelting him.'\n\n'I'm glad on 't,' said Sylvia; 'it's t' best news I've heered for\nmany a day,--he, to turn again' feyther, who gave him money fo t'\nget a lodging that night, when he'd no place to go to. It were his\nevidence as hung feyther; and he's rightly punished for it now.'\n\n'For a' that,--and he's done a vast o' wrong beside, he's dying now,\nSylvie!'\n\n'Well! let him die--it's t' best thing he could do!'\n\n'But he's lying i' such dree poverty,--and niver a friend to go near\nhim,--niver a person to speak a kind word t' him.'\n\n'It seems as yo've been speaking wi' him, at any rate,' said Sylvia,\nturning round on Philip.\n\n'Ay. He sent for me by Nell Manning, th' old beggar-woman, who\nsometimes goes in and makes his bed for him, poor wretch,--he's\nlying in t' ruins of th' cow-house of th' Mariners' Arms, Sylvie.'\n\n'Well!' said she, in the same hard, dry tone.\n\n'And I went and fetched th' parish doctor, for I thought he'd ha'\ndied before my face,--he was so wan, and ashen-grey, so thin, too,\nhis eyes seem pushed out of his bony face.'\n\n'That last time--feyther's eyes were starting, wild-like, and as if\nhe couldn't meet ours, or bear the sight on our weeping.'\n\nIt was a bad look-out for Philip's purpose; but after a pause he\nwent bravely on.\n\n'He's a poor dying creature, anyhow. T' doctor said so, and told him\nhe hadn't many hours, let alone days, to live.'\n\n'And he'd shrink fra' dying wi' a' his sins on his head?' said\nSylvia, almost exultingly.\n\nPhilip shook his head. 'He said this world had been too strong for\nhim, and men too hard upon him; he could niver do any good here, and\nhe thought he should, maybe, find folks i' t' next place more\nmerciful.'\n\n'He'll meet feyther theere,' said Sylvia, still hard and bitter.\n\n'He's a poor ignorant creature, and doesn't seem to know rightly who\nhe's like to meet; only he seems glad to get away fra' Monkshaven\nfolks; he were really hurt, I am afeared, that night, Sylvie,--and\nhe speaks as if he'd had hard times of it ever since he were a\nchild,--and he talks as if he were really grieved for t' part t'\nlawyers made him take at th' trial,--they made him speak, against\nhis will, he says.'\n\n'Couldn't he ha' bitten his tongue out?' asked Sylvia. 'It's fine\ntalking o' sorrow when the thing is done!'\n\n'Well, anyhow he's sorry now; and he's not long for to live. And,\nSylvie, he bid me ask thee, if, for the sake of all that is dear to\nthee both here, and i' th' world to come, thou'd go wi' me, and just\nsay to him that thou forgives him his part that day.'\n\n'He sent thee on that errand, did he? And thou could come and ask\nme? I've a mind to break it off for iver wi' thee, Philip.' She kept\ngasping, as if she could not say any more. Philip watched and waited\ntill her breath came, his own half choked.\n\n'Thee and me was niver meant to go together. It's not in me to\nforgive,--I sometimes think it's not in me to forget. I wonder,\nPhilip, if thy feyther had done a kind deed--and a right deed--and a\nmerciful deed--and some one as he'd been good to, even i' t' midst\nof his just anger, had gone and let on about him to th' judge, as\nwas trying to hang him,--and had getten him hanged,--hanged dead, so\nthat his wife were a widow, and his child fatherless for\nivermore,--I wonder if thy veins would run milk and water, so that\nthou could go and make friends, and speak soft wi' him as had caused\nthy feyther's death?'\n\n'It's said in t' Bible, Sylvie, that we're to forgive.'\n\n'Ay, there's some things as I know I niver forgive; and there's\nothers as I can't--and I won't, either.'\n\n'But, Sylvie, yo' pray to be forgiven your trespasses, as you\nforgive them as trespass against you.'\n\n'Well, if I'm to be taken at my word, I'll noane pray at all, that's\nall. It's well enough for them as has but little to forgive to use\nthem words; and I don't reckon it's kind, or pretty behaved in yo',\nPhilip, to bring up Scripture again' me. Thou may go about thy\nbusiness.'\n\n'Thou'rt vexed with me, Sylvie; and I'm not meaning but that it\nwould go hard with thee to forgive him; but I think it would be\nright and Christian-like i' thee, and that thou'd find thy comfort\nin thinking on it after. If thou'd only go, and see his wistful\neyes--I think they'd plead wi' thee more than his words, or mine\neither.'\n\n'I tell thee my flesh and blood wasn't made for forgiving and\nforgetting. Once for all, thou must take my word. When I love I\nlove, and when I hate I hate; and him as has done hard to me, or to\nmine, I may keep fra' striking or murdering, but I'll niver forgive.\nI should be just a monster, fit to be shown at a fair, if I could\nforgive him as got feyther hanged.'\n\nPhilip was silent, thinking what more he could urge.\n\n'Yo'd better be off,' said Sylvia, in a minute or two. 'Yo' and me\nhas got wrong, and it'll take a night's sleep to set us right. Yo've\nsaid all yo' can for him; and perhaps it's not yo' as is to blame,\nbut yo'r nature. But I'm put out wi' thee, and want thee out o' my\nsight for awhile.'\n\nOne or two more speeches of this kind convinced him that it would be\nwise in him to take her at her word. He went back to Simpson, and\nfound him, though still alive, past the understanding of any words\nof human forgiveness. Philip had almost wished he had not troubled\nor irritated Sylvia by urging the dying man's request: the\nperformance of this duty seemed now to have been such a useless\noffice.\n\nAfter all, the performance of a duty is never a useless office,\nthough we may not see the consequences, or they may be quite\ndifferent to what we expected or calculated on. In the pause of\nactive work, when daylight was done, and the evening shades came on,\nSylvia had time to think; and her heart grew sad and soft, in\ncomparison to what it had been when Philip's urgency had called out\nall her angry opposition. She thought of her father--his sharp\npassions, his frequent forgiveness, or rather his forgetfulness that\nhe had even been injured. All Sylvia's persistent or enduring\nqualities were derived from her mother, her impulses from her\nfather. It was her dead father whose example filled her mind this\nevening in the soft and tender twilight. She did not say to herself\nthat she would go and tell Simpson that she forgave him; but she\nthought that if Philip asked her again that she should do so.\n\nBut when she saw Philip again he told her that Simpson was dead; and\npassed on from what he had reason to think would be an unpleasant\nsubject to her. Thus he never learnt how her conduct might have been\nmore gentle and relenting than her words--words which came up into\nhis memory at a future time, with full measure of miserable\nsignificance.\n\nIn general, Sylvia was gentle and good enough; but Philip wanted her\nto be shy and tender with him, and this she was not. She spoke to\nhim, her pretty eyes looking straight and composedly at him. She\nconsulted him like the family friend that he was: she met him\nquietly in all the arrangements for the time of their marriage,\nwhich she looked upon more as a change of home, as the leaving of\nHaytersbank, as it would affect her mother, than in any more\ndirectly personal way. Philip was beginning to feel, though not as\nyet to acknowledge, that the fruit he had so inordinately longed for\nwas but of the nature of an apple of Sodom.\n\nLong ago, lodging in widow Rose's garret, he had been in the habit\nof watching some pigeons that were kept by a neighbour; the flock\ndisported themselves on the steep tiled roofs just opposite to the\nattic window, and insensibly Philip grew to know their ways, and one\npretty, soft little dove was somehow perpetually associated in his\nmind with his idea of his cousin Sylvia. The pigeon would sit in one\nparticular place, sunning herself, and puffing out her feathered\nbreast, with all the blue and rose-coloured lights gleaming in the\nmorning rays, cooing softly to herself as she dressed her plumage.\nPhilip fancied that he saw the same colours in a certain piece of\nshot silk--now in the shop; and none other seemed to him so suitable\nfor his darling's wedding-dress. He carried enough to make a gown,\nand gave it to her one evening, as she sate on the grass just\noutside the house, half attending to her mother, half engaged in\nknitting stockings for her scanty marriage outfit. He was glad that\nthe sun was not gone down, thus allowing him to display the changing\ncolours in fuller light. Sylvia admired it duly; even Mrs. Robson was\npleased and attracted by the soft yet brilliant hues. Philip\nwhispered to Sylvia--(he took delight in whispers,--she, on the\ncontrary, always spoke to him in her usual tone of voice)--\n\n'Thou'lt look so pretty in it, sweetheart,--o' Thursday fortnight!'\n\n'Thursday fortnight. On the fourth yo're thinking on. But I cannot\nwear it then,--I shall be i' black.'\n\n'Not on that day, sure!' said Philip.\n\n'Why not? There's nought t' happen on that day for t' make me forget\nfeyther. I couldn't put off my black, Philip,--no, not to save my\nlife! Yon silk is just lovely, far too good for the likes of\nme,--and I'm sure I'm much beholden to yo'; and I'll have it made up\nfirst of any gown after last April come two years,--but, oh, Philip,\nI cannot put off my mourning!'\n\n'Not for our wedding-day!' said Philip, sadly.\n\n'No, lad, I really cannot. I'm just sorry about it, for I see\nthou'rt set upon it; and thou'rt so kind and good, I sometimes think\nI can niver be thankful enough to thee. When I think on what would\nha' become of mother and me if we hadn't had thee for a friend i'\nneed, I'm noane ungrateful, Philip; tho' I sometimes fancy thou'rt\nthinking I am.'\n\n'I don't want yo' to be grateful, Sylvie,' said poor Philip,\ndissatisfied, yet unable to explain what he did want; only knowing\nthat there was something he lacked, yet fain would have had.\n\nAs the marriage-day drew near, all Sylvia's care seemed to be for\nher mother; all her anxiety was regarding the appurtenances of the\nhome she was leaving. In vain Philip tried to interest her in\ndetails of his improvements or contrivances in the new home to which\nhe was going to take her. She did not tell him; but the idea of the\nhouse behind the shop was associated in her mind with two times of\ndiscomfort and misery. The first time she had gone into the parlour\nabout which Philip spoke so much was at the time of the press-gang\nriot, when she had fainted from terror and excitement; the second\nwas on that night of misery when she and her mother had gone in to\nMonkshaven, to bid her father farewell before he was taken to York;\nin that room, on that night, she had first learnt something of the\nfatal peril in which he stood. She could not show the bright shy\ncuriosity about her future dwelling that is common enough with girls\nwho are going to be married. All she could do was to restrain\nherself from sighing, and listen patiently, when he talked on the\nsubject. In time he saw that she shrank from it; so he held his\npeace, and planned and worked for her in silence,--smiling to\nhimself as he looked on each completed arrangement for her pleasure\nor comfort; and knowing well that her happiness was involved in what\nfragments of peace and material comfort might remain to her mother.\n\nThe wedding-day drew near apace. It was Philip's plan that after\nthey had been married in Kirk Moorside church, he and his Sylvia,\nhis cousin, his love, his wife, should go for the day to Robin\nHood's Bay, returning in the evening to the house behind the shop in\nthe market-place. There they were to find Bell Robson installed in\nher future home; for Haytersbank Farm was to be given up to the new\ntenant on the very day of the wedding. Sylvia would not be married\nany sooner; she said that she must stay there till the very last;\nand had said it with such determination that Philip had desisted\nfrom all urgency at once.\n\nHe had told her that all should be settled for her mother's comfort\nduring their few hours' absence; otherwise Sylvia would not have\ngone at all. He told her he should ask Hester, who was always so\ngood and kind--who never yet had said him nay, to go to church with\nthem as bridesmaid--for Sylvia would give no thought or care to\nanything but her mother--and that they would leave her at\nHaytersbank as they returned from church; she would manage Mrs\nRobson's removal--she would do this--do that--do everything. Such\nfriendly confidence had Philip in Hester's willingness and tender\nskill. Sylvia acquiesced at length, and Philip took upon himself to\nspeak to Hester on the subject.\n\n'Hester,' said he, one day when he was preparing to go home after\nthe shop was closed; 'would yo' mind stopping a bit? I should like\nto show yo' the place now it's done up; and I've a favour to ask on\nyo' besides.' He was so happy he did not see her shiver all over.\nShe hesitated just a moment before she answered,--\n\n'I'll stay, if thou wishes it, Philip. But I'm no judge o' fashions\nand such like.'\n\n'Thou'rt a judge o' comfort, and that's what I've been aiming at. I\nwere niver so comfortable in a' my life as when I were a lodger at\nthy house,' said he, with brotherly tenderness in his tone. 'If my\nmind had been at ease I could ha' said I niver were happier in all\nmy days than under thy roof; and I know it were thy doing for the\nmost part. So come along, Hester, and tell me if there's aught more\nI can put in for Sylvie.'\n\nIt might not have been a very appropriate text, but such as it was\nthe words, 'From him that would ask of thee turn not thou away,'\nseemed the only source of strength that could have enabled her to go\npatiently through the next half-hour. As it was, she unselfishly\nbrought all her mind to bear upon the subject; admired this, thought\nand decided upon that, as one by one Philip showed her all his\nalterations and improvements. Never was such a quiet little bit of\nunconscious and unrecognized heroism. She really ended by such a\nconquest of self that she could absolutely sympathize with the proud\nexpectant lover, and had quenched all envy of the beloved, in\nsympathy with the delight she imagined Sylvia must experience when\nshe discovered all these proofs of Philip's fond consideration and\ncare. But it was a great strain on the heart, that source of life;\nand when Hester returned into the parlour, after her deliberate\nsurvey of the house, she felt as weary and depressed in bodily\nstrength as if she had gone through an illness of many days. She\nsate down on the nearest chair, and felt as though she never could\nrise again. Philip, joyous and content, stood near her talking.\n\n'And, Hester,' said he, 'Sylvie has given me a message for thee--she\nsays thou must be her bridesmaid--she'll have none other.'\n\n'I cannot,' said Hester, with sudden sharpness.\n\n'Oh, yes, but yo' must. It wouldn't be like my wedding if thou\nwasn't there: why I've looked upon thee as a sister iver since I\ncame to lodge with thy mother.'\n\nHester shook her head. Did her duty require her not to turn away\nfrom this asking, too? Philip saw her reluctance, and, by intuition\nrather than reason, he knew that what she would not do for gaiety or\npleasure she would consent to, if by so doing she could render any\nservice to another. So he went on.\n\n'Besides, Sylvie and me has planned to go for our wedding jaunt to\nRobin Hood's Bay. I ha' been to engage a shandry this very morn,\nbefore t' shop was opened; and there's no one to leave wi' my aunt.\nTh' poor old body is sore crushed with sorrow; and is, as one may\nsay, childish at times; she's to come down here, that we may find\nher when we come back at night; and there's niver a one she'll come\nwith so willing and so happy as with thee, Hester. Sylvie and me has\nboth said so.'\n\nHester looked up in his face with her grave honest eyes.\n\n'I cannot go to church wi' thee, Philip; and thou must not ask me\nany further. But I'll go betimes to Haytersbank Farm, and I'll do my\nbest to make the old lady happy, and to follow out thy directions in\nbringing her here before nightfall.'\n\nPhilip was on the point of urging her afresh to go with them to\nchurch; but something in her eyes brought a thought across his mind,\nas transitory as a breath passes over a looking-glass, and he\ndesisted from his entreaty, and put away his thought as a piece of\nvain coxcombry, insulting to Hester. He passed rapidly on to all the\ncareful directions rendered necessary by her compliance with the\nlatter part of his request, coupling Sylvia's name with his\nperpetually; so that Hester looked upon her as a happy girl, as\neager in planning all the details of her marriage as though no heavy\nshameful sorrow had passed over her head not many months ago.\n\nHester did not see Sylvia's white, dreamy, resolute face, that\nanswered the solemn questions of the marriage service in a voice\nthat did not seem her own. Hester was not with them to notice the\nheavy abstraction that made the bride as if unconscious of her\nhusband's loving words, and then start and smile, and reply with a\nsad gentleness of tone. No! Hester's duty lay in conveying the poor\nwidow and mother down from Haytersbank to the new home in\nMonkshaven; and for all Hester's assistance and thoughtfulness, it\nwas a dreary, painful piece of work--the poor old woman crying like\na child, with bewilderment at the confused bustle which, in spite of\nall Sylvia's careful forethought, could not be avoided on this final\nday, when her mother had to be carried away from the homestead over\nwhich she had so long presided. But all this was as nothing to the\ndistress which overwhelmed poor Bell Robson when she entered\nPhilip's house; the parlour--the whole place so associated with the\nkeen agony she had undergone there, that the stab of memory\npenetrated through her deadened senses, and brought her back to\nmisery. In vain Hester tried to console her by telling her the fact\nof Sylvia's marriage with Philip in every form of words that\noccurred to her. Bell only remembered her husband's fate, which\nfilled up her poor wandering mind, and coloured everything; insomuch\nthat Sylvia not being at hand to reply to her mother's cry for her,\nthe latter imagined that her child, as well as her husband, was in\ndanger of trial and death, and refused to be comforted by any\nendeavour of the patient sympathizing Hester. In a pause of Mrs\nRobson's sobs, Hester heard the welcome sound of the wheels of the\nreturning shandry, bearing the bride and bridegroom home. It stopped\nat the door--an instant, and Sylvia, white as a sheet at the sound\nof her mother's wailings, which she had caught while yet at a\ndistance, with the quick ears of love, came running in; her mother\nfeebly rose and tottered towards her, and fell into her arms,\nsaying, 'Oh! Sylvie, Sylvie, take me home, and away from this cruel\nplace!'\n\nHester could not but be touched with the young girl's manner to her\nmother--as tender, as protecting as if their relation to each other\nhad been reversed, and she was lulling and tenderly soothing a\nwayward, frightened child. She had neither eyes nor ears for any one\ntill her mother was sitting in trembling peace, holding her\ndaughter's hand tight in both of hers, as if afraid of losing sight\nof her: then Sylvia turned to Hester, and, with the sweet grace\nwhich is a natural gift to some happy people, thanked her; in common\nwords enough she thanked her, but in that nameless manner, and with\nthat strange, rare charm which made Hester feel as if she had never\nbeen thanked in all her life before; and from that time forth she\nunderstood, if she did not always yield to, the unconscious\nfascination which Sylvia could exercise over others at times.\n\nDid it enter into Philip's heart to perceive that he had wedded his\nlong-sought bride in mourning raiment, and that the first sounds\nwhich greeted them as they approached their home were those of\nweeping and wailing?\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXX\n\nHAPPY DAYS\n\n\nAnd now Philip seemed as prosperous as his heart could desire. The\nbusiness flourished, and money beyond his moderate wants came in. As\nfor himself he required very little; but he had always looked\nforward to placing his idol in a befitting shrine; and means for\nthis were now furnished to him. The dress, the comforts, the\nposition he had desired for Sylvia were all hers. She did not need\nto do a stroke of household work if she preferred to 'sit in her\nparlour and sew up a seam'. Indeed Phoebe resented any interference\nin the domestic labour, which she had performed so long, that she\nlooked upon the kitchen as a private empire of her own. 'Mrs\nHepburn' (as Sylvia was now termed) had a good dark silk gown-piece\nin her drawers, as well as the poor dove-coloured, against the day\nwhen she chose to leave off mourning; and stuff for either gray or\nscarlet cloaks was hers at her bidding.\n\nWhat she cared for far more were the comforts with which it was in\nher power to surround her mother. In this Philip vied with her; for\nbesides his old love, and new pity for his aunt Bell, he never\nforgot how she had welcomed him to Haytersbank, and favoured his\nlove to Sylvia, in the yearning days when he little hoped he should\never win his cousin to be his wife. But even if he had not had these\ngrateful and affectionate feelings towards the poor woman, he would\nhave done much for her if only to gain the sweet, rare smiles which\nhis wife never bestowed upon him so freely as when she saw him\nattending to 'mother,' for so both of them now called Bell. For her\ncreature comforts, her silk gowns, and her humble luxury, Sylvia did\nnot care; Philip was almost annoyed at the indifference she often\nmanifested to all his efforts to surround her with such things. It\nwas even a hardship to her to leave off her country dress, her\nuncovered hair, her linsey petticoat, and loose bed-gown, and to don\na stiff and stately gown for her morning dress. Sitting in the dark\nparlour at the back of the shop, and doing 'white work,' was much\nmore wearying to her than running out into the fields to bring up\nthe cows, or spinning wool, or making up butter. She sometimes\nthought to herself that it was a strange kind of life where there\nwere no out-door animals to look after; the 'ox and the ass' had\nhitherto come into all her ideas of humanity; and her care and\ngentleness had made the dumb creatures round her father's home into\nmute friends with loving eyes, looking at her as if wistful to speak\nin words the grateful regard that she could read without the poor\nexpression of language.\n\nShe missed the free open air, the great dome of sky above the\nfields; she rebelled against the necessity of 'dressing' (as she\ncalled it) to go out, although she acknowledged that it was a\nnecessity where the first step beyond the threshold must be into a\npopulous street.\n\nIt is possible that Philip was right at one time when he had thought\nto win her by material advantages; but the old vanities had been\nburnt out of her by the hot iron of acute suffering. A great deal of\npassionate feeling still existed, concealed and latent; but at this\nperiod it appeared as though she were indifferent to most things,\nand had lost the power of either hoping or fearing much. She was\nstunned into a sort of temporary numbness on most points; those on\nwhich she was sensitive being such as referred to the injustice and\noppression of her father's death, or anything that concerned her\nmother.\n\nShe was quiet even to passiveness in all her dealings with Philip;\nhe would have given not a little for some of the old bursts of\nimpatience, the old pettishness, which, naughty as they were, had\ngone to form his idea of the former Sylvia. Once or twice he was\nalmost vexed with her for her docility; he wanted her so much to\nhave a will of her own, if only that he might know how to rouse her\nto pleasure by gratifying it. Indeed he seldom fell asleep at nights\nwithout his last thoughts being devoted to some little plan for the\nmorrow, that he fancied she would like; and when he wakened in the\nearly dawn he looked to see if she were indeed sleeping by his side,\nor whether it was not all a dream that he called Sylvia 'wife.'\n\nHe was aware that her affection for him was not to be spoken of in\nthe same way as his for her, but he found much happiness in only\nbeing allowed to love and cherish her; and with the patient\nperseverance that was one remarkable feature in his character, he\nwent on striving to deepen and increase her love when most other men\nwould have given up the endeavour, made themselves content with half\na heart, and turned to some other object of attainment. All this\ntime Philip was troubled by a dream that recurred whenever he was\nover-fatigued, or otherwise not in perfect health. Over and over\nagain in this first year of married life he dreamt this dream;\nperhaps as many as eight or nine times, and it never varied. It was\nalways of Kinraid's return; Kinraid was full of life in Philip's\ndream, though in his waking hours he could and did convince himself\nby all the laws of probability that his rival was dead. He never\nremembered the exact sequence of events in that terrible dream after\nhe had roused himself, with a fight and a struggle, from his\nfeverish slumbers. He was generally sitting up in bed when he found\nhimself conscious, his heart beating wildly, with a conviction of\nKinraid's living presence somewhere near him in the darkness.\nOccasionally Sylvia was disturbed by his agitation, and would\nquestion him about his dreams, having, like most of her class at\nthat time, great faith in their prophetic interpretation; but Philip\nnever gave her any truth in his reply.\n\nAfter all, and though he did not acknowledge it even to himself, the\nlong-desired happiness was not so delicious and perfect as he had\nanticipated. Many have felt the same in their first year of married\nlife; but the faithful, patient nature that still works on, striving\nto gain love, and capable itself of steady love all the while, is a\ngift not given to all.\n\nFor many weeks after their wedding, Kester never came near them: a\nchance word or two from Sylvia showed Philip that she had noticed\nthis and regretted it; and, accordingly, he made it his business at\nthe next leisure opportunity to go to Haytersbank (never saying a\nword to his wife of his purpose), and seek out Kester.\n\nAll the whole place was altered! It was new white-washed, new\nthatched: the patches of colour in the surrounding ground were\nchanged with altered tillage; the great geraniums were gone from the\nwindow, and instead, was a smart knitted blind. Children played\nbefore the house-door; a dog lying on the step flew at Philip; all\nwas so strange, that it was even the strangest thing of all for\nKester to appear where everything else was so altered!\n\nPhilip had to put up with a good deal of crabbed behaviour on the\npart of the latter before he could induce Kester to promise to come\ndown into the town and see Sylvia in her new home.\n\nSomehow, the visit when paid was but a failure; at least, it seemed\nso at the time, though probably it broke the ice of restraint which\nwas forming over the familiar intercourse between Kester and Sylvia.\nThe old servant was daunted by seeing Sylvia in a strange place, and\nstood, sleeking his hair down, and furtively looking about him,\ninstead of seating himself on the chair Sylvia had so eagerly\nbrought forward for him.\n\nThen his sense of the estrangement caused by their new positions\ninfected her, and she began to cry pitifully, saying,--\n\n'Oh, Kester! Kester! tell me about Haytersbank! Is it just as it\nused to be in feyther's days?'\n\n'Well, a cannot say as it is,' said Kester, thankful to have a\nsubject started. 'They'n pleughed up t' oud pasture-field, and are\nsettin' it for 'taters. They're not for much cattle, isn't\nHigginses. They'll be for corn in t' next year, a reckon, and\nthey'll just ha' their pains for their payment. But they're allays\nso pig-headed, is folk fra' a distance.'\n\nSo they went on discoursing on Haytersbank and the old days, till\nBell Robson, having finished her afternoon nap, came slowly\ndown-stairs to join them; and after that the conversation became so\nbroken up, from the desire of the other two to attend and reply as\nbest they could to her fragmentary and disjointed talk, that Kester\ntook his leave before long; falling, as he did so, into the formal\nand unnaturally respectful manner which he had adopted on first\ncoming in.\n\nBut Sylvia ran after him, and brought him back from the door.\n\n'To think of thy going away, Kester, without either bit or drink;\nnay, come back wi' thee, and taste wine and cake.'\n\nKester stood at the door, half shy, half pleased, while Sylvia, in\nall the glow and hurry of a young housekeeper's hospitality, sought\nfor the decanter of wine, and a wine-glass in the corner cupboard,\nand hastily cut an immense wedge of cake, which she crammed into his\nhand in spite of his remonstrances; and then she poured him out an\noverflowing glass of wine, which Kester would far rather have gone\nwithout, as he knew manners too well to suppose that he might taste\nit without having gone through the preliminary ceremony of wishing\nthe donor health and happiness. He stood red and half smiling, with\nhis cake in one hand, his wine in the other, and then began,--\n\n  'Long may ye live,\n  Happy may ye he,\n  And blest with a num'rous\n  Pro-ge-ny.'\n\n'Theere, that's po'try for yo' as I larnt i' my youth. But there's a\ndeal to be said as cannot be put int' po'try, an' yet a cannot say\nit, somehow. It 'd tax a parson t' say a' as a've getten i' my mind.\nIt's like a heap o' woo' just after shearin' time; it's worth a\ndeal, but it tak's a vast o' combin', an' cardin', an' spinnin'\nafore it can be made use on. If a were up to t' use o' words, a\ncould say a mighty deal; but somehow a'm tongue-teed when a come to\nwant my words most, so a'll only just mak' bold t' say as a think\nyo've done pretty well for yo'rsel', getten a house-full o'\nfurniture' (looking around him as he said this), 'an' vittle an'\nclothin' for t' axing, belike, an' a home for t' missus in her time\no' need; an' mebbe not such a bad husband as a once thought yon man\n'ud mak'; a'm not above sayin' as he's, mebbe, better nor a took him\nfor;--so here's to ye both, and wishin' ye health and happiness, ay,\nand money to buy yo' another, as country folk say.'\n\nHaving ended his oration, much to his own satisfaction, Kester\ntossed off his glass of wine, smacked his lips, wiped his mouth with\nthe back of his hand, pocketed his cake, and made off.\n\nThat night Sylvia spoke of his visit to her husband. Philip never\nsaid how he himself had brought it to pass, nor did he name the fact\nthat he had heard the old man come in just as he himself had\nintended going into the parlour for tea, but had kept away, as he\nthought Sylvia and Kester would most enjoy their interview\nundisturbed. And Sylvia felt as if her husband's silence was\nunsympathizing, and shut up the feelings that were just beginning to\nexpand towards him. She sank again into the listless state of\nindifference from which nothing but some reference to former days,\nor present consideration for her mother, could rouse her.\n\nHester was almost surprised at Sylvia's evident liking for her. By\nslow degrees Hester was learning to love the woman, whose position\nas Philip's wife she would have envied so keenly had she not been so\ntruly good and pious. But Sylvia seemed as though she had given\nHester her whole affection all at once. Hester could not understand\nthis, while she was touched and melted by the trust it implied. For\none thing Sylvia remembered and regretted--her harsh treatment of\nHester the rainy, stormy night on which the latter had come to\nHaytersbank to seek her and her mother, and bring them into\nMonkshaven to see the imprisoned father and husband. Sylvia had been\nstruck with Hester's patient endurance of her rudeness, a rudeness\nwhich she was conscious that she herself should have immediately and\nvehemently resented. Sylvia did not understand how a totally\ndifferent character from hers might immediately forgive the anger\nshe could not forget; and because Hester had been so meek at the\ntime, Sylvia, who knew how passing and transitory was her own anger,\nthought that all was forgotten; while Hester believed that the\nwords, which she herself could not have uttered except under deep\nprovocation, meant much more than they did, and admired and wondered\nat Sylvia for having so entirely conquered her anger against her.\n\nAgain, the two different women were divergently affected by the\nextreme fondness which Bell had shown towards Hester ever since\nSylvia's wedding-day. Sylvia, who had always received more love from\nothers than she knew what to do with, had the most entire faith in\nher own supremacy in her mother's heart, though at times Hester\nwould do certain things more to the poor old woman's satisfaction.\nHester, who had craved for the affection which had been withheld\nfrom her, and had from that one circumstance become distrustful of\nher own power of inspiring regard, while she exaggerated the delight\nof being beloved, feared lest Sylvia should become jealous of her\nmother's open display of great attachment and occasional preference\nfor Hester. But such a thought never entered Sylvia's mind. She was\nmore thankful than she knew how to express towards any one who made\nher mother happy; as has been already said, the contributing to Bell\nRobson's pleasures earned Philip more of his wife's smiles than\nanything else. And Sylvia threw her whole heart into the words and\ncaresses she lavished on Hester whenever poor Mrs. Robson spoke of\nthe goodness and kindness of the latter. Hester attributed more\nvirtue to these sweet words and deeds of gratitude than they\ndeserved; they did not imply in Sylvia any victory over evil\ntemptation, as they would have done in Hester.\n\nIt seemed to be Sylvia's fate to captivate more people than she\ncared to like back again. She turned the heads of John and Jeremiah\nFoster, who could hardly congratulate Philip enough on his choice of\na wife.\n\nThey had been prepared to be critical on one who had interfered with\ntheir favourite project of a marriage between Philip and Hester;\nand, though full of compassion for the cruelty of Daniel Robson's\nfate, they were too completely men of business not to have some\napprehension that the connection of Philip Hepburn with the daughter\nof a man who was hanged, might injure the shop over which both his\nand their name appeared. But all the possible proprieties demanded\nthat they should pay attention to the bride of their former shopman\nand present successor; and the very first visitors whom Sylvia had\nreceived after her marriage had been John and Jeremiah Foster, in\ntheir sabbath-day clothes. They found her in the parlour (so\nfamiliar to both of them!) clear-starching her mother's caps, which\nhad to be got up in some particular fashion that Sylvia was afraid\nof dictating to Phoebe.\n\nShe was a little disturbed at her visitors discovering her at this\nemployment; but she was on her own ground, and that gave her\nself-possession; and she welcomed the two old men so sweetly and\nmodestly, and looked so pretty and feminine, and, besides, so\nnotable in her handiwork, that she conquered all their prejudices at\none blow; and their first thought on leaving the shop was how to do\nher honour, by inviting her to a supper party at Jeremiah Foster's\nhouse.\n\nSylvia was dismayed when she was bidden to this wedding feast, and\nPhilip had to use all his authority, though tenderly, to make her\nconsent to go at all. She had been to merry country parties like the\nCorneys', and to bright haymaking romps in the open air; but never\nto a set stately party at a friend's house.\n\nShe would fain have made attendance on her mother an excuse; but\nPhilip knew he must not listen to any such plea, and applied to\nHester in the dilemma, asking her to remain with Mrs. Robson while he\nand Sylvia went out visiting; and Hester had willingly, nay, eagerly\nconsented--it was much more to her taste than going out.\n\nSo Philip and Sylvia set out, arm-in-arm, down Bridge Street, across\nthe bridge, and then clambered up the hill. On the way he gave her\nthe directions she asked for about her behaviour as bride and most\nhonoured guest; and altogether succeeded, against his intention and\nwill, in frightening her so completely as to the grandeur and\nimportance of the occasion, and the necessity of remembering certain\nset rules, and making certain set speeches and attending to them\nwhen the right time came, that, if any one so naturally graceful\ncould have been awkward, Sylvia would have been so that night.\n\nAs it was, she sate, pale and weary-looking, on the very edge of her\nchair; she uttered the formal words which Philip had told her were\nappropriate to the occasion, and she heartily wished herself safe at\nhome and in bed. Yet she left but one unanimous impression on the\ncompany when she went away, namely, that she was the prettiest and\nbest-behaved woman they had ever seen, and that Philip Hepburn had\ndone well in choosing her, felon's daughter though she might be.\n\nBoth the hosts had followed her into the lobby to help Philip in\ncloaking her, and putting on her pattens. They were full of\nold-fashioned compliments and good wishes; one speech of theirs came\nup to her memory in future years:--\n\n'Now, Sylvia Hepburn,' said Jeremiah, 'I've known thy husband long,\nand I don't say but what thou hast done well in choosing him; but if\nhe ever neglects or ill-uses thee, come to me, and I'll give him a\nsound lecture on his conduct. Mind, I'm thy friend from this day\nforrards, and ready to take thy part against him!'\n\nPhilip smiled as if the day would never come when he should neglect\nor ill-use his darling; Sylvia smiled a little, without much\nattending to, or caring for, the words that were detaining her,\ntired as she was; John and Jeremiah chuckled over the joke; but the\nwords came up again in after days, as words idly spoken sometimes\ndo.\n\nBefore the end of that first year, Philip had learnt to be jealous\nof his wife's new love for Hester. To the latter, Sylvia gave the\nfree confidence on many things which Philip fancied she withheld\nfrom him. A suspicion crossed his mind, from time to time, that\nSylvia might speak of her former lover to Hester. It would be not\nunnatural, he thought, if she did so, believing him to be dead; but\nthe idea irritated him.\n\nHe was entirely mistaken, however; Sylvia, with all her apparent\nfrankness, kept her deep sorrows to herself. She never mentioned her\nfather's name, though he was continually present to her mind. Nor\ndid she speak of Kinraid to human being, though, for his sake, her\nvoice softened when, by chance, she spoke to a passing sailor; and\nfor his sake her eyes lingered on such men longer than on others,\ntrying to discover in them something of the old familiar gait; and\npartly for his dead sake, and partly because of the freedom of the\noutlook and the freshness of the air, she was glad occasionally to\nescape from the comfortable imprisonment of her 'parlour', and the\nclose streets around the market-place, and to mount the cliffs and\nsit on the turf, gazing abroad over the wide still expanse of the\nopen sea; for, at that height, even breaking waves only looked like\nbroken lines of white foam on the blue watery plain.\n\nShe did not want any companion on these rambles, which had somewhat\nof the delight of stolen pleasures; for all the other respectable\nmatrons and town-dwellers whom she knew were content to have always\na business object for their walk, or else to stop at home in their\nown households; and Sylvia was rather ashamed of her own yearnings\nfor solitude and open air, and the sight and sound of the\nmother-like sea. She used to take off her hat, and sit there, her\nhands clasping her knees, the salt air lifting her bright curls,\ngazing at the distant horizon over the sea, in a sad dreaminess of\nthought; if she had been asked on what she meditated, she could not\nhave told you.\n\nBut, by-and-by, the time came when she was a prisoner in the house;\na prisoner in her room, lying in bed with a little baby by her\nside--her child, Philip's child. His pride, his delight knew no\nbounds; this was a new fast tie between them; this would reconcile\nher to the kind of life that, with all its respectability and\ncomfort, was so different from what she had lived before, and which\nPhilip had often perceived that she felt to be dull and restraining.\nHe already began to trace in the little girl, only a few days old,\nthe lovely curves that he knew so well by heart in the mother's\nface. Sylvia, too, pale, still, and weak, was very happy; yes,\nreally happy for the first time since her irrevocable marriage. For\nits irrevocableness had weighed much upon her with a sense of dull\nhopelessness; she felt all Philip's kindness, she was grateful to\nhim for his tender regard towards her mother, she was learning to\nlove him as well as to like and respect him. She did not know what\nelse she could have done but marry so true a friend, and she and her\nmother so friendless; but, at the same time, it was like lead on her\nmorning spirits when she awoke and remembered that the decision was\nmade, the dead was done, the choice taken which comes to most people\nbut once in their lives. Now the little baby came in upon this state\nof mind like a ray of sunlight into a gloomy room.\n\nEven her mother was rejoiced and proud; even with her crazed brain\nand broken heart, the sight of sweet, peaceful infancy brought light\nto her. All the old ways of holding a baby, of hushing it to sleep,\nof tenderly guarding its little limbs from injury, came back, like\nthe habits of her youth, to Bell; and she was never so happy or so\neasy in her mind, or so sensible and connected in her ideas, as when\nshe had Sylvia's baby in her arms.\n\nIt was a pretty sight to see, however familiar to all of us such\nthings may be--the pale, worn old woman, in her quaint,\nold-fashioned country dress, holding the little infant on her knees,\nlooking at its open, unspeculative eyes, and talking the little\nlanguage to it as though it could understand; the father on his\nknees, kept prisoner by a small, small finger curled round his\nstrong and sinewy one, and gazing at the tiny creature with\nwondering idolatry; the young mother, fair, pale, and smiling,\npropped up on pillows in order that she, too, might see the\nwonderful babe; it was astonishing how the doctor could come and go\nwithout being drawn into the admiring vortex, and look at this baby\njust as if babies came into the world every day.\n\n'Philip,' said Sylvia, one night, as he sate as still as a mouse in\nher room, imagining her to be asleep. He was by her bed-side in a\nmoment.\n\n'I've been thinking what she's to be called. Isabella, after mother;\nand what were yo'r mother's name?'\n\n'Margaret,' said he.\n\n'Margaret Isabella; Isabella Margaret. Mother's called Bell. She\nmight be called Bella.'\n\n'I could ha' wished her to be called after thee.'\n\nShe made a little impatient movement.\n\n'Nay; Sylvia's not a lucky name. Best be called after thy mother and\nmine. And I want for to ask Hester to be godmother.'\n\n'Anything thou likes, sweetheart. Shall we call her Rose, after\nHester Rose?'\n\n'No, no!' said Sylvia; 'she mun be called after my mother, or thine,\nor both. I should like her to be called Bella, after mother, because\nshe's so fond of baby.'\n\n'Anything to please thee, darling.'\n\n'Don't say that as if it didn't signify; there's a deal in having a\npretty name,' said Sylvia, a little annoyed. 'I ha' allays hated\nbeing called Sylvia. It were after father's mother, Sylvia Steele.'\n\n'I niver thought any name in a' the world so sweet and pretty as\nSylvia,' said Philip, fondly; but she was too much absorbed in her\nown thoughts to notice either his manner or his words.\n\n'There, yo'll not mind if it is Bella, because yo' see my mother is\nalive to be pleased by its being named after her, and Hester may be\ngodmother, and I'll ha' t' dove-coloured silk as yo' gave me afore\nwe were married made up into a cloak for it to go to church in.'\n\n'I got it for thee,' said Philip, a little disappointed. 'It'll be\ntoo good for the baby.'\n\n'Eh! but I'm so careless, I should be spilling something on it? But\nif thou got it for me I cannot find i' my heart for t' wear it on\nbaby, and I'll have it made into a christening gown for mysel'. But\nI'll niver feel at my ease in it, for fear of spoiling it.'\n\n'Well! an' if thou does spoil it, love, I'll get thee another. I\nmake account of riches only for thee; that I may be able to get thee\nwhativer thou's a fancy for, for either thysel', or thy mother.'\n\nShe lifted her pale face from her pillow, and put up her lips to\nkiss him for these words.\n\nPerhaps on that day Philip reached the zenith of his life's\nhappiness.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXI\n\nEVIL OMENS\n\n\nThe first step in Philip's declension happened in this way. Sylvia\nhad made rapid progress in her recovery; but now she seemed at a\nstationary point of weakness; wakeful nights succeeding to languid\ndays. Occasionally she caught a little sleep in the afternoons, but\nshe usually awoke startled and feverish.\n\nOne afternoon Philip had stolen upstairs to look at her and his\nchild; but the efforts he made at careful noiselessness made the\ndoor creak on its hinges as he opened it. The woman employed to\nnurse her had taken the baby into another room that no sound might\nrouse her from her slumber; and Philip would probably have been\nwarned against entering the chamber where his wife lay sleeping had\nhe been perceived by the nurse. As it was, he opened the door, made\na noise, and Sylvia started up, her face all one flush, her eyes\nwild and uncertain; she looked about her as if she did not know\nwhere she was; pushed the hair off her hot forehead; all which\nactions Philip saw, dismayed and regretful. But he kept still,\nhoping that she would lie down and compose herself. Instead she\nstretched out her arms imploringly, and said, in a voice full of\nyearning and tears,--\n\n'Oh! Charley! come to me--come to me!' and then as she more fully\nbecame aware of the place where she was, her actual situation, she\nsank back and feebly began to cry. Philip's heart boiled within him;\nany man's would under the circumstances, but he had the sense of\nguilty concealment to aggravate the intensity of his feelings. Her\nweak cry after another man, too, irritated him, partly through his\nanxious love, which made him wise to know how much physical harm she\nwas doing herself. At this moment he stirred, or unintentionally\nmade some sound: she started up afresh, and called out,--\n\n'Oh, who's theere? Do, for God's sake, tell me who yo' are!'\n\n'It's me,' said Philip, coming forwards, striving to keep down the\nmiserable complication of love and jealousy, and remorse and anger,\nthat made his heart beat so wildly, and almost took him out of\nhimself. Indeed, he must have been quite beside himself for the\ntime, or he could never have gone on to utter the unwise, cruel\nwords he did. But she spoke first, in a distressed and plaintive\ntone of voice.\n\n'Oh, Philip, I've been asleep, and yet I think I was awake! And I\nsaw Charley Kinraid as plain as iver I see thee now, and he wasn't\ndrowned at all. I'm sure he's alive somewheere; he were so clear and\nlife-like. Oh! what shall I do? what shall I do?'\n\nShe wrung her hands in feverish distress. Urged by passionate\nfeelings of various kinds, and also by his desire to quench the\nagitation which was doing her harm, Philip spoke, hardly knowing\nwhat he said.\n\n'Kinraid's dead, I tell yo', Sylvie! And what kind of a woman are\nyo' to go dreaming of another man i' this way, and taking on so\nabout him, when yo're a wedded wife, with a child as yo've borne to\nanother man?'\n\nIn a moment he could have bitten out his tongue. She looked at him\nwith the mute reproach which some of us see (God help us!) in the\neyes of the dead, as they come before our sad memories in the\nnight-season; looked at him with such a solemn, searching look,\nnever saying a word of reply or defence. Then she lay down,\nmotionless and silent. He had been instantly stung with remorse for\nhis speech; the words were not beyond his lips when an agony had\nentered his heart; but her steady, dilated eyes had kept him dumb\nand motionless as if by a spell.\n\nNow he rushed to the bed on which she lay, and half knelt, half\nthrew himself upon it, imploring her to forgive him; regardless for\nthe time of any evil consequences to her, it seemed as if he must\nhave her pardon--her relenting--at any price, even if they both died\nin the act of reconciliation. But she lay speechless, and, as far as\nshe could be, motionless, the bed trembling under her with the\nquivering she could not still.\n\nPhilip's wild tones caught the nurse's ears, and she entered full of\nthe dignified indignation of wisdom.\n\n'Are yo' for killing yo'r wife, measter?' she asked. 'She's noane so\nstrong as she can bear flytin' and scoldin', nor will she be for\nmany a week to come. Go down wi' ye, and leave her i' peace if yo're\na man as can be called a man!'\n\nHer anger was rising as she caught sight of Sylvia's averted face.\nIt was flushed crimson, her eyes full of intense emotion of some\nkind, her lips compressed; but an involuntary twitching\novermastering her resolute stillness from time to time. Philip, who\ndid not see the averted face, nor understand the real danger in\nwhich he was placing his wife, felt as though he must have one word,\none responsive touch of the hand which lay passive in his, which was\nnot even drawn away from the kisses with which he covered it, any\nmore than if it had been an impassive stone. The nurse had fairly to\ntake him by the shoulders, and turn him out of the room.\n\nIn half an hour the doctor had to be summoned. Of course, the nurse\ngave him her version of the events of the afternoon, with much\n_animus_ against Philip; and the doctor thought it his duty to have\nsome very serious conversation with him.\n\n'I do assure you, Mr. Hepburn, that, in the state your wife has been\nin for some days, it was little less than madness on your part to\nspeak to her about anything that could give rise to strong emotion.'\n\n'It was madness, sir!' replied Philip, in a low, miserable tone of\nvoice. The doctor's heart was touched, in spite of the nurse's\naccusations against the scolding husband. Yet the danger was now too\nserious for him to mince matters.\n\n'I must tell you that I cannot answer for her life, unless the\ngreatest precautions are taken on your part, and unless the measures\nI shall use have the effect I wish for in the next twenty-four\nhours. She is on the verge of a brain fever. Any allusion to the\nsubject which has been the final cause of the state in which she now\nis must be most cautiously avoided, even to a chance word which may\nbring it to her memory.'\n\nAnd so on; but Philip seemed to hear only this: then he might not\nexpress contrition, or sue for pardon, he must go on unforgiven\nthrough all this stress of anxiety; and even if she recovered the\ndoctor warned him of the undesirableness of recurring to what had\npassed!\n\nHeavy miserable times of endurance and waiting have to be passed\nthrough by all during the course of their lives; and Philip had had\nhis share of such seasons, when the heart, and the will, and the\nspeech, and the limbs, must be bound down with strong resolution to\npatience.\n\nFor many days, nay, for weeks, he was forbidden to see Sylvia, as\nthe very sound of his footstep brought on a recurrence of the fever\nand convulsive movement. Yet she seemed, from questions she feebly\nasked the nurse, to have forgotten all that had happened on the day\nof her attack from the time when she dropped off to sleep. But how\nmuch she remembered of after occurrences no one could ascertain. She\nwas quiet enough when, at length, Philip was allowed to see her. But\nhe was half jealous of his child, when he watched how she could\nsmile at it, while she never changed a muscle of her face at all he\ncould do or say.\n\nAnd of a piece with this extreme quietude and reserve was her\nbehaviour to him when at length she had fully recovered, and was\nable to go about the house again. Philip thought many a time of the\nwords she had used long before--before their marriage. Ominous words\nthey were.\n\n'It's not in me to forgive; I sometimes think it's not in me to\nforget.'\n\nPhilip was tender even to humility in his conduct towards her. But\nnothing stirred her from her fortress of reserve. And he knew she\nwas so different; he knew how loving, nay, passionate, was her\nnature--vehement, demonstrative--oh! how could he stir her once more\ninto expression, even if the first show or speech she made was of\nanger? Then he tried being angry with her himself; he was sometimes\nunjust to her consciously and of a purpose, in order to provoke her\ninto defending herself, and appealing against his unkindness. He\nonly seemed to drive her love away still more.\n\nIf any one had known all that was passing in that household, while\nyet the story of it was not ended, nor, indeed, come to its crisis,\ntheir hearts would have been sorry for the man who lingered long at\nthe door of the room in which his wife sate cooing and talking to\nher baby, and sometimes laughing back to it, or who was soothing the\nquerulousness of failing age with every possible patience of love;\nsorry for the poor listener who was hungering for the profusion of\ntenderness thus scattered on the senseless air, yet only by stealth\ncaught the echoes of what ought to have been his.\n\nIt was so difficult to complain, too; impossible, in fact.\nEverything that a wife could do from duty she did; but the love\nseemed to have fled, and, in such cases, no reproaches or complaints\ncan avail to bring it back. So reason outsiders, and are convinced\nof the result before the experiment is made. But Philip could not\nreason, or could not yield to reason; and so he complained and\nreproached. She did not much answer him; but he thought that her\neyes expressed the old words,--\n\n'It's not in me to forgive; I sometimes think it's not in me to\nforget.'\n\nHowever, it is an old story, an ascertained fact, that, even in the\nmost tender and stable masculine natures, at the supremest season of\ntheir lives, there is room for other thoughts and passions than such\nas are connected with love. Even with the most domestic and\naffectionate men, their emotions seem to be kept in a cell distinct\nand away from their actual lives. Philip had other thoughts and\nother occupations than those connected with his wife during all this\ntime.\n\nAn uncle of his mother's, a Cumberland 'statesman', of whose\nexistence he was barely conscious, died about this time, leaving to\nhis unknown great-nephew four or five hundred pounds, which put him\nat once in a different position with regard to his business.\nHenceforward his ambition was roused,--such humble ambition as\nbefitted a shop-keeper in a country town sixty or seventy years ago.\nTo be respected by the men around him had always been an object with\nhim, and was, perhaps, becoming more so than ever now, as a sort of\nrefuge from his deep, sorrowful mortification in other directions.\nHe was greatly pleased at being made a sidesman; and, in preparation\nfor the further honour of being churchwarden, he went regularly\ntwice a day to church on Sundays. There was enough religious feeling\nin him to make him disguise the worldly reason for such conduct from\nhimself. He believed that he went because he thought it right to\nattend public worship in the parish church whenever it was offered\nup; but it may be questioned of him, as of many others, how far he\nwould have been as regular in attendance in a place where he was not\nknown. With this, however, we have nothing to do. The fact was that\nhe went regularly to church, and he wished his wife to accompany him\nto the pew, newly painted, with his name on the door, where he sate\nin full sight of the clergyman and congregation.\n\nSylvia had never been in the habit of such regular church-going, and\nshe felt it as a hardship, and slipped out of the duty as often as\never she could. In her unmarried days, she and her parents had gone\nannually to the mother-church of the parish in which Haytersbank was\nsituated: on the Monday succeeding the Sunday next after the Romish\nSaint's Day, to whom the church was dedicated, there was a great\nfeast or wake held; and, on the Sunday, all the parishioners came to\nchurch from far and near. Frequently, too, in the course of the\nyear, Sylvia would accompany one or other of her parents to Scarby\nMoorside afternoon service,--when the hay was got in, and the corn\nnot ready for cutting, or the cows were dry and there was no\nafternoon milking. Many clergymen were languid in those days, and\ndid not too curiously inquire into the reasons which gave them such\nsmall congregations in country parishes.\n\nNow she was married, this weekly church-going which Philip seemed to\nexpect from her, became a tie and a small hardship, which connected\nitself with her life of respectability and prosperity. 'A crust of\nbread and liberty' was much more accordant to Sylvia's nature than\nplenty of creature comforts and many restraints. Another wish of\nPhilip's, against which she said no word, but constantly rebelled in\nthought and deed, was his desire that the servant he had engaged\nduring the time of her illness to take charge of the baby, should\nalways carry it whenever it was taken out for a walk. Sylvia often\nfelt, now she was strong, as if she would far rather have been\nwithout the responsibility of having this nursemaid, of whom she\nwas, in reality, rather afraid. The good side of it was that it set\nher at liberty to attend to her mother at times when she would have\nbeen otherwise occupied with her baby; but Bell required very little\nfrom any one: she was easily pleased, unexacting, and methodical\neven in her dotage; preserving the quiet, undemonstrative habits of\nher earlier life now that the faculty of reason, which had been at\nthe basis of the formation of such habits, was gone. She took great\ndelight in watching the baby, and was pleased to have it in her care\nfor a short time; but she dozed so much that it prevented her having\nany strong wish on the subject.\n\nSo Sylvia contrived to get her baby as much as possible to herself,\nin spite of the nursemaid; and, above all, she would carry it out,\nsoftly cradled in her arms, warm pillowed on her breast, and bear it\nto the freedom and solitude of the sea-shore on the west side of the\ntown where the cliffs were not so high, and there was a good space\nof sand and shingle at all low tides.\n\nOnce here, she was as happy as she ever expected to be in this\nworld. The fresh sea-breeze restored something of the colour of\nformer days to her cheeks, the old buoyancy to her spirits; here she\nmight talk her heart-full of loving nonsense to her baby; here it\nwas all her own; no father to share in it, no nursemaid to dispute\nthe wisdom of anything she did with it. She sang to it, she tossed\nit; it crowed and it laughed back again, till both were weary; and\nthen she would sit down on a broken piece of rock, and fall to\ngazing on the advancing waves catching the sunlight on their crests,\nadvancing, receding, for ever and for ever, as they had done all her\nlife long--as they did when she had walked with them that once by\nthe side of Kinraid; those cruel waves that, forgetful of the happy\nlovers' talk by the side of their waters, had carried one away, and\ndrowned him deep till he was dead. Every time she sate down to look\nat the sea, this process of thought was gone through up to this\npoint; the next step would, she knew, bring her to the question she\ndared not, must not ask. He was dead; he must be dead; for was she\nnot Philip's wife? Then came up the recollection of Philip's speech,\nnever forgotten, only buried out of sight: 'What kind of a woman are\nyo' to go on dreaming of another man, and yo' a wedded wife?' She\nused to shudder as if cold steel had been plunged into her warm,\nliving body as she remembered these words; cruel words, harmlessly\nprovoked. They were too much associated with physical pains to be\ndwelt upon; only their memory was always there. She paid for these\nhappy rambles with her baby by the depression which awaited her on\nher re-entrance into the dark, confined house that was her home; its\nvery fulness of comfort was an oppression. Then, when her husband\nsaw her pale and fatigued, he was annoyed, and sometimes upbraided\nher for doing what was so unnecessary as to load herself with her\nchild. She knew full well it was not that that caused her weariness.\nBy-and-by, when he inquired and discovered that all these walks were\ntaken in one direction, out towards the sea, he grew jealous of her\nlove for the inanimate ocean. Was it connected in her mind with the\nthought of Kinraid? Why did she so perseveringly, in wind or cold,\ngo out to the sea-shore; the western side, too, where, if she went\nbut far enough, she would come upon the mouth of the Haytersbank\ngully, the point at which she had last seen Kinraid? Such fancies\nhaunted Philip's mind for hours after she had acknowledged the\ndirection of her walks. But he never said a word that could\ndistinctly tell her he disliked her going to the sea, otherwise she\nwould have obeyed him in this, as in everything else; for absolute\nobedience to her husband seemed to be her rule of life at this\nperiod--obedience to him who would so gladly have obeyed her\nsmallest wish had she but expressed it! She never knew that Philip\nhad any painful association with the particular point on the\nsea-shore that she instinctively avoided, both from a consciousness\nof wifely duty, and also because the sight of it brought up so much\nsharp pain.\n\nPhilip used to wonder if the dream that preceded her illness was the\nsuggestive cause that drew her so often to the shore. Her illness\nconsequent upon that dream had filled his mind, so that for many\nmonths he himself had had no haunting vision of Kinraid to disturb\nhis slumbers. But now the old dream of Kinraid's actual presence by\nPhilip's bedside began to return with fearful vividness. Night after\nnight it recurred; each time with some new touch of reality, and\nclose approach; till it was as if the fate that overtakes all men\nwere then, even then, knocking at his door.\n\nIn his business Philip prospered. Men praised him because he did\nwell to himself. He had the perseverance, the capability for\nhead-work and calculation, the steadiness and general forethought\nwhich might have made him a great merchant if he had lived in a\nlarge city. Without any effort of his own, almost, too, without\nCoulson's being aware of it, Philip was now in the position of\nsuperior partner; the one to suggest and arrange, while Coulson only\ncarried out the plans that emanated from Philip. The whole work of\nlife was suited to the man: he did not aspire to any different\nposition, only to the full development of the capabilities of that\nwhich he already held. He had originated several fresh schemes with\nregard to the traffic of the shop; and his old masters, with all\ntheir love of tried ways, and distrust of everything new, had been\ncandid enough to confess that their successors' plans had resulted\nin success. 'Their successors.' Philip was content with having the\npower when the exercise of it was required, and never named his own\nimportant share in the new improvements. Possibly, if he had,\nCoulson's vanity might have taken the alarm, and he might not have\nbeen so acquiescent for the future. As it was, he forgot his own\nsubordinate share, and always used the imperial 'we', 'we thought',\n'it struck us,' &c.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXII\n\nRESCUED FROM THE WAVES\n\n\nMeanwhile Hester came and went as usual; in so quiet and methodical\na way, with so even and undisturbed a temper, that she was almost\nforgotten when everything went well in the shop or household. She\nwas a star, the brightness of which was only recognized in times of\ndarkness. She herself was almost surprised at her own increasing\nregard for Sylvia. She had not thought she should ever be able to\nlove the woman who had been such a laggard in acknowledging Philip's\nmerits; and from all she had ever heard of Sylvia before she came to\nknow her, from the angry words with which Sylvia had received her\nwhen she had first gone to Haytersbank Farm, Hester had intended to\nremain on friendly terms, but to avoid intimacy. But her kindness to\nBell Robson had won both the mother's and daughter's hearts; and in\nspite of herself, certainly against her own mother's advice, she had\nbecome the familiar friend and welcome guest of the household.\n\nNow the very change in Sylvia's whole manner and ways, which grieved\nand vexed Philip, made his wife the more attractive to Hester.\nBrought up among Quakers, although not one herself, she admired and\nrespected the staidness and outward peacefulness common amongst the\nyoung women of that sect. Sylvia, whom she had expected to find\nvolatile, talkative, vain, and wilful, was quiet and still, as if\nshe had been born a Friend: she seemed to have no will of her own;\nshe served her mother and child for love; she obeyed her husband in\nall things, and never appeared to pine after gaiety or pleasure. And\nyet at times Hester thought, or rather a flash came across her mind,\nas if all things were not as right as they seemed. Philip looked\nolder, more care-worn; nay, even Hester was obliged to allow to\nherself that she had heard him speak to his wife in sharp, aggrieved\ntones. Innocent Hester! she could not understand how the very\nqualities she so admired in Sylvia were just what were so foreign to\nher nature that the husband, who had known her from a child, felt\nwhat an unnatural restraint she was putting upon herself, and would\nhave hailed petulant words or wilful actions with an unspeakable\nthankfulness for relief.\n\nOne day--it was in the spring of 1798--Hester was engaged to stay to\ntea with the Hepburns, in order that after that early meal she might\nset to again in helping Philip and Coulson to pack away the winter\ncloths and flannels, for which there was no longer any use. The\ntea-time was half-past four; about four o'clock a heavy April shower\ncame on, the hail pattering against the window-panes so as to awaken\nMrs. Robson from her afternoon's nap. She came down the corkscrew\nstairs, and found Phoebe in the parlour arranging the tea-things.\n\nPhoebe and Mrs. Robson were better friends than Phoebe and her young\nmistress; and so they began to talk a little together in a\ncomfortable, familiar way. Once or twice Philip looked in, as if he\nwould be glad to see the tea-table in readiness; and then Phoebe\nwould put on a spurt of busy bustle, which ceased almost as soon as\nhis back was turned, so eager was she to obtain Mrs. Robson's\nsympathy in some little dispute that had occurred between her and\nthe nurse-maid. The latter had misappropriated some hot water,\nprepared and required by Phoebe, to the washing of the baby's\nclothes; it was a long story, and would have tired the patience of\nany one in full possession of their senses; but the details were\njust within poor Bell's comprehension, and she was listening with\nthe greatest sympathy. Both the women were unaware of the lapse of\ntime; but it was of consequence to Philip, as the extra labour was\nnot to be begun until after tea, and the daylight hours were\nprecious.\n\nAt a quarter to five Hester and he came in, and then Phoebe began to\nhurry. Hester went up to sit by Bell and talk to her. Philip spoke\nto Phoebe in the familiar words of country-folk. Indeed, until his\nmarriage, Phoebe had always called him by his Christian name, and\nhad found it very difficult to change it into 'master.'\n\n'Where's Sylvie?' said he.\n\n'Gone out wi' t' babby,' replied Phoebe.\n\n'Why can't Nancy carry it out?' asked Philip.\n\nIt was touching on the old grievance: he was tired, and he spoke\nwith sharp annoyance. Phoebe might easily have told him the real\nstate of the case; Nancy was busy at her washing, which would have\nbeen reason enough. But the nursemaid had vexed her, and she did not\nlike Philip's sharpness, so she only said,--\n\n'It's noane o' my business; it's yo' t' look after yo'r own wife and\nchild; but yo'r but a lad after a'.'\n\nThis was not conciliatory speech, and just put the last stroke to\nPhilip's fit of ill-temper.\n\n'I'm not for my tea to-night,' said he, to Hester, when all was\nready. 'Sylvie's not here, and nothing is nice, or as it should be.\nI'll go and set to on t' stock-taking. Don't yo' hurry, Hester; stop\nand chat a bit with th' old lady.'\n\n'Nay, Philip,' said Hester, 'thou's sadly tired; just take this cup\no' tea; Sylvia 'll be grieved if yo' haven't something.'\n\n'Sylvia doesn't care whether I'm full or fasting,' replied he,\nimpatiently putting aside the cup. 'If she did she'd ha' taken care\nto be in, and ha' seen to things being as I like them.'\n\nNow in general Philip was the least particular of men about meals;\nand to do Sylvia justice, she was scrupulously attentive to every\nhousehold duty in which old Phoebe would allow her to meddle, and\nalways careful to see after her husband's comforts. But Philip was\ntoo vexed at her absence to perceive the injustice of what he was\nsaying, nor was he aware how Bell Robson had been attending to what\nhe said. But she was sadly discomfited by it, understanding just\nenough of the grievance in hand to think that her daughter was\nneglectful of those duties which she herself had always regarded as\nparamount to all others; nor could Hester convince her that Philip\nhad not meant what he said; neither could she turn the poor old\nwoman's thoughts from the words which had caused her distress.\n\nPresently Sylvia came in, bright and cheerful, although breathless\nwith hurry.\n\n'Oh,' said she, taking off her wet shawl, 'we've had to shelter from\nsuch a storm of rain, baby and me--but see! she's none the worse for\nit, as bonny as iver, bless her.'\n\nHester began some speech of admiration for the child in order to\nprevent Bell from delivering the lecture she felt sure was coming\ndown on the unsuspecting Sylvia; but all in vain.\n\n'Philip's been complaining on thee, Sylvie,' said Bell, in the way\nin which she had spoken to her daughter when she was a little child;\ngrave and severe in tone and look, more than in words. 'I forget\njustly what about, but he spoke on thy neglecting him continual.\nIt's not right, my lass, it's not right; a woman should--but my\nhead's very tired, and all I can think on to say is, it's not\nright.'\n\n'Philip been complaining of me, and to mother!' said Sylvia, ready\nto burst into tears, so grieved and angry was she.\n\n'No!' said Hester, 'thy mother has taken it a little too strong; he\nwere vexed like at his tea not being ready.'\n\nSylvia said no more, but the bright colour faded from her cheek, and\nthe contraction of care returned to her brow. She occupied herself\nwith taking off her baby's walking things. Hester lingered, anxious\nto soothe and make peace; she was looking sorrowfully at Sylvia,\nwhen she saw tears dropping on the baby's cloak, and then it seemed\nas if she must speak a word of comfort before going to the\nshop-work, where she knew she was expected by both Philip and\nCoulson. She poured out a cup of tea, and coming close up to Sylvia,\nand kneeling down by her, she whispered,--\n\n'Just take him this into t' ware-room; it'll put all to rights if\nthou'll take it to him wi' thy own hands.'\n\nSylvia looked up, and Hester then more fully saw how she had been\ncrying. She whispered in reply, for fear of disturbing her mother,--\n\n'I don't mind anything but his speaking ill on me to mother. I know\nI'm for iver trying and trying to be a good wife to him, an' it's\nvery dull work; harder than yo' think on, Hester,--an' I would ha'\nbeen home for tea to-night only I was afeared of baby getting wet\nwi' t' storm o' hail as we had down on t' shore; and we sheltered\nunder a rock. It's a weary coming home to this dark place, and to\nfind my own mother set against me.'\n\n'Take him his tea, like a good lassie. I'll answer for it he'll be\nall right. A man takes it hardly when he comes in tired, a-thinking\nhis wife 'll be there to cheer him up a bit, to find her off, and\nniver know nought of t' reason why.'\n\n'I'm glad enough I've getten a baby,' said Sylvia, 'but for aught\nelse I wish I'd niver been married, I do!'\n\n'Hush thee, lass!' said Hester, rising up indignant; 'now that is a\nsin. Eh! if thou only knew the lot o' some folk. But let's talk no\nmore on that, that cannot be helped; go, take him his tea, for it's\na sad thing to think on him fasting all this time.'\n\nHester's voice was raised by the simple fact of her change of\nposition; and the word fasting caught Mrs. Robson's ear, as she sate\nat her knitting by the chimney-corner.\n\n'Fasting? he said thou didn't care if he were full or fasting.\nLassie! it's not right in thee, I say; go, take him his tea at\nonce.'\n\nSylvia rose, and gave up the baby, which she had been suckling, to\nNancy, who having done her washing, had come for her charge, to put\nit to bed. Sylvia kissed it fondly, making a little moan of sad,\npassionate tenderness as she did so. Then she took the cup of tea;\nbut she said, rather defiantly, to Hester,--\n\n'I'll go to him with it, because mother bids me, and it'll ease her\nmind.'\n\nThen louder to her mother, she added,--\n\n'Mother, I'll take him his tea, though I couldn't help the being\nout.'\n\nIf the act itself was conciliatory, the spirit in which she was\ngoing to do it was the reverse. Hester followed her slowly into the\nware-room, with intentional delay, thinking that her presence might\nbe an obstacle to their mutually understanding one another. Sylvia\nheld the cup and plate of bread and butter out to Philip, but\navoided meeting his eye, and said not a word of explanation, or\nregret, or self-justification. If she had spoken, though ever so\ncrossly, Philip would have been relieved, and would have preferred\nit to her silence. He wanted to provoke her to speech, but did not\nknow how to begin.\n\n'Thou's been out again wandering on that sea-shore!' said he. She\ndid not answer him. 'I cannot think what's always taking thee there,\nwhen one would ha' thought a walk up to Esdale would be far more\nsheltered, both for thee and baby in such weather as this. Thou'll\nbe having that baby ill some of these days.'\n\nAt this, she looked up at him, and her lips moved as though she were\ngoing to say something. Oh, how he wished she would, that they might\ncome to a wholesome quarrel, and a making friends again, and a\ntender kissing, in which he might whisper penitence for all his\nhasty words, or unreasonable vexation. But she had come resolved not\nto speak, for fear of showing too much passion, too much emotion.\nOnly as she was going away she turned and said,--\n\n'Philip, mother hasn't many more years to live; dunnot grieve her,\nand set her again' me by finding fault wi' me afore her. Our being\nwed were a great mistake; but before t' poor old widow woman let us\nmake as if we were happy.'\n\n'Sylvie! Sylvie!' he called after her. She must have heard, but she\ndid not turn. He went after her, and seized her by the arm rather\nroughly; she had stung him to the heart with her calm words, which\nseemed to reveal a long-formed conviction.\n\n'Sylvie!' said he, almost fiercely, 'what do yo' mean by what you've\nsaid? Speak! I will have an answer.'\n\nHe almost shook her: she was half frightened by his vehemence of\nbehaviour, which she took for pure anger, while it was the outburst\nof agonized and unrequited love.\n\n'Let me go! Oh, Philip, yo' hurt me!'\n\nJust at this moment Hester came up; Philip was ashamed of his\npassionate ways in her serene presence, and loosened his grasp of\nhis wife, and she ran away; ran into her mother's empty room, as to\na solitary place, and there burst into that sobbing, miserable\ncrying which we instinctively know is too surely lessening the\nlength of our days on earth to be indulged in often.\n\nWhen she had exhausted that first burst and lay weak and quiet for a\ntime, she listened in dreading expectation of the sound of his\nfootstep coming in search of her to make friends. But he was\ndetained below on business, and never came. Instead, her mother came\nclambering up the stairs; she was now in the habit of going to bed\nbetween seven and eight, and to-night she was retiring at even an\nearlier hour.\n\nSylvia sprang up and drew down the window-blind, and made her face\nand manner as composed as possible, in order to soothe and comfort\nher mother's last waking hours. She helped her to bed with gentle\npatience; the restraint imposed upon her by her tender filial love\nwas good for her, though all the time she was longing to be alone to\nhave another wild outburst. When her mother was going off to sleep,\nSylvia went to look at her baby, also in a soft sleep. Then she\ngazed out at the evening sky, high above the tiled roofs of the\nopposite houses, and the longing to be out under the peaceful\nheavens took possession of her once more.\n\n'It's my only comfort,' said she to herself; 'and there's no earthly\nharm in it. I would ha' been at home to his tea, if I could; but\nwhen he doesn't want me, and mother doesn't want me, and baby is\neither in my arms or asleep; why, I'll go any cry my fill out under\nyon great quiet sky. I cannot stay in t' house to be choked up wi'\nmy tears, nor yet to have him coming about me either for scolding or\npeace-making.'\n\nSo she put on her things and went out again; this time along the\nHigh Street, and up the long flights of steps towards the parish\nchurch, and there she stood and thought that here she had first met\nKinraid, at Darley's burying, and she tried to recall the very look\nof all the sad, earnest faces round the open grave--the whole scene,\nin fact; and let herself give way to the miserable regrets she had\nso often tried to control. Then she walked on, crying bitterly,\nalmost unawares to herself; on through the high, bleak fields at the\nsummit of the cliffs; fields bounded by loose stone fences, and far\nfrom all sight of the habitation of man. But, below, the sea rose\nand raged; it was high water at the highest tide, and the wind blew\ngustily from the land, vainly combating the great waves that came\ninvincibly up with a roar and an impotent furious dash against the\nbase of the cliffs below.\n\nSylvia heard the sound of the passionate rush and rebound of many\nwaters, like the shock of mighty guns, whenever the other sound of\nthe blustering gusty wind was lulled for an instant. She was more\nquieted by this tempest of the elements than she would have been had\nall nature seemed as still as she had imagined it to be while she\nwas yet in-doors and only saw a part of the serene sky.\n\nShe fixed on a certain point, in her own mind, which she would\nreach, and then turn back again. It was where the outline of the\nland curved inwards, dipping into a little bay. Here the field-path\nshe had hitherto followed descended somewhat abruptly to a cluster\nof fishermen's cottages, hardly large enough to be called a village;\nand then the narrow roadway wound up the rising ground till it again\nreached the summit of the cliffs that stretched along the coast for\nmany and many a mile.\n\nSylvia said to herself that she would turn homewards when she came\nwithin sight of this cove,--Headlington Cove, they called it. All\nthe way along she had met no one since she had left the town, but\njust as she had got over the last stile, or ladder of\nstepping-stones, into the field from which the path descended, she\ncame upon a number of people--quite a crowd, in fact; men moving\nforward in a steady line, hauling at a rope, a chain, or something\nof that kind; boys, children, and women holding babies in their\narms, as if all were fain to come out and partake in some general\ninterest.\n\nThey kept within a certain distance from the edge of the cliff, and\nSylvia, advancing a little, now saw the reason why. The great cable\nthe men held was attached to some part of a smack, which could now\nbe seen by her in the waters below, half dismantled, and all but a\nwreck, yet with her deck covered with living men, as far as the\nwaning light would allow her to see. The vessel strained to get free\nof the strong guiding cable; the tide was turning, the wind was\nblowing off shore, and Sylvia knew without being told, that almost\nparallel to this was a line of sunken rocks that had been fatal to\nmany a ship before now, if she had tried to take the inner channel\ninstead of keeping out to sea for miles, and then steering in\nstraight for Monkshaven port. And the ships that had been thus lost\nhad been in good plight and order compared to this vessel, which\nseemed nothing but a hull without mast or sail.\n\nBy this time, the crowd--the fishermen from the hamlet down below,\nwith their wives and children--all had come but the bedridden--had\nreached the place where Sylvia stood. The women, in a state of wild\nexcitement, rushed on, encouraging their husbands and sons by words,\neven while they hindered them by actions; and, from time to time,\none of them would run to the edge of the cliff and shout out some\nbrave words of hope in her shrill voice to the crew on the deck\nbelow. Whether these latter heard it or not, no one could tell; but\nit seemed as if all human voice must be lost in the tempestuous stun\nand tumult of wind and wave. It was generally a woman with a child\nin her arms who so employed herself. As the strain upon the cable\nbecame greater, and the ground on which they strove more uneven,\nevery hand was needed to hold and push, and all those women who were\nunencumbered held by the dear rope on which so many lives were\ndepending. On they came, a long line of human beings, black against\nthe ruddy sunset sky. As they came near Sylvia, a woman cried out,--\n\n'Dunnot stand idle, lass, but houd on wi' us; there's many a bonny\nlife at stake, and many a mother's heart a-hangin' on this bit o'\nhemp. Tak' houd, lass, and give a firm grip, and God remember thee\ni' thy need.'\n\nSylvia needed no second word; a place was made for her, and in an\ninstant more the rope was pulling against her hands till it seemed\nas though she was holding fire in her bare palms. Never a one of\nthem thought of letting go for an instant, though when all was over\nmany of their hands were raw and bleeding. Some strong, experienced\nfishermen passed a word along the line from time to time, giving\ndirections as to how it should be held according to varying\noccasions; but few among the rest had breath or strength enough to\nspeak. The women and children that accompanied them ran on before,\nbreaking down the loose stone fences, so as to obviate delay or\nhindrance; they talked continually, exhorting, encouraging,\nexplaining. From their many words and fragmentary sentences, Sylvia\nlearnt that the vessel was supposed to be a Newcastle smack sailing\nfrom London, that had taken the dangerous inner channel to save\ntime, and had been caught in the storm, which she was too crazy to\nwithstand; and that if by some daring contrivance of the fishermen\nwho had first seen her the cable had not been got ashore, she would\nhave been cast upon the rocks before this, and 'all on board\nperished'.\n\n'It were dayleet then,' quoth one woman; 'a could see their faces,\nthey were so near. They were as pale as dead men, an' one was\nprayin' down on his knees. There was a king's officer aboard, for I\nsaw t' gowd about him.'\n\n'He'd maybe come from these hom'ard parts, and be comin' to see his\nown folk; else it's no common for king's officers to sail in aught\nbut king's ships.'\n\n'Eh! but it's gettin' dark! See there's t' leeghts in t' houses in\nt' New Town! T' grass is crispin' wi' t' white frost under out feet.\nIt'll be a hard tug round t' point, and then she'll be gettin' into\nstill waters.'\n\nOne more great push and mighty strain, and the danger was past; the\nvessel--or what remained of her--was in the harbour, among the\nlights and cheerful sounds of safety. The fishermen sprang down the\ncliff to the quay-side, anxious to see the men whose lives they had\nsaved; the women, weary and over-excited, began to cry. Not Sylvia,\nhowever; her fount of tears had been exhausted earlier in the day:\nher principal feeling was of gladness and high rejoicing that they\nwere saved who had been so near to death not half an hour before.\n\nShe would have liked to have seen the men, and shaken hands with\nthem all round. But instead she must go home, and well would it be\nwith her if she was in time for her husband's supper, and escaped\nany notice of her absence. So she separated herself from the groups\nof women who sate on the grass in the churchyard, awaiting the\nreturn of such of their husbands as could resist the fascinations of\nthe Monkshaven public houses. As Sylvia went down the church steps,\nshe came upon one of the fishermen who had helped to tow the vessel\ninto port.\n\n'There was seventeen men and boys aboard her, and a navy-lieutenant\nas had comed as passenger. It were a good job as we could manage\nher. Good-neet to thee, thou'll sleep all t' sounder for havin' lent\na hand.'\n\nThe street air felt hot and close after the sharp keen atmosphere of\nthe heights above; the decent shops and houses had all their\nshutters put up, and were preparing for their early bed-time.\nAlready lights shone here and there in the upper chambers, and\nSylvia scarcely met any one.\n\nShe went round up the passage from the quay-side, and in by the\nprivate door. All was still; the basins of bread and milk that she\nand her husband were in the habit of having for supper stood in the\nfender before the fire, each with a plate upon them. Nancy had gone\nto bed, Phoebe dozed in the kitchen; Philip was still in the\nware-room, arranging goods and taking stock along with Coulson, for\nHester had gone home to her mother.\n\nSylvia was not willing to go and seek out Philip, after the manner\nin which they had parted. All the despondency of her life became\npresent to her again as she sate down within her home. She had\nforgotten it in her interest and excitement, but now it came back\nagain.\n\nStill she was hungry, and youthful, and tired. She took her basin\nup, and was eating her supper when she heard a cry of her baby\nupstairs, and ran away to attend to it. When it had been fed and\nhushed away to sleep, she went in to see her mother, attracted by\nsome unusual noise in her room.\n\nShe found Mrs. Robson awake, and restless, and ailing; dwelling much\non what Philip had said in his anger against Sylvia. It was really\nnecessary for her daughter to remain with her; so Sylvia stole out,\nand went quickly down-stairs to Philip--now sitting tired and worn\nout, and eating his supper with little or no appetite--and told him\nshe meant to pass the night with her mother.\n\nHis answer of acquiescence was so short and careless, or so it\nseemed to her, that she did not tell him any more of what she had\ndone or seen that evening, or even dwell upon any details of her\nmother's indisposition.\n\nAs soon as she had left the room, Philip set down his half-finished\nbasin of bread and milk, and sate long, his face hidden in his\nfolded arms. The wick of the candle grew long and black, and fell,\nand sputtered, and guttered; he sate on, unheeding either it or the\npale gray fire that was dying out--dead at last.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIII\n\nAN APPARITION\n\n\nMrs. Robson was very poorly all night long. Uneasy thoughts seemed\nto haunt and perplex her brain, and she neither slept nor woke, but\nwas restless and uneasy in her talk and movements.\n\nSylvia lay down by her, but got so little sleep, that at length she\npreferred sitting in the easy-chair by the bedside. Here she dropped\noff to slumber in spite of herself; the scene of the evening before\nseemed to be repeated; the cries of the many people, the heavy roar\nand dash of the threatening waves, were repeated in her ears; and\nsomething was said to her through all the conflicting noises,--what\nit was she could not catch, though she strained to hear the hoarse\nmurmur that, in her dream, she believed to convey a meaning of the\nutmost importance to her.\n\nThis dream, that mysterious, only half-intelligible sound, recurred\nwhenever she dozed, and her inability to hear the words uttered\ndistressed her so much, that at length she sate bolt upright,\nresolved to sleep no more. Her mother was talking in a\nhalf-conscious way; Philip's speech of the evening before was\nevidently running in her mind.\n\n'Sylvie, if thou're not a good wife to him, it'll just break my\nheart outright. A woman should obey her husband, and not go her own\ngait. I never leave the house wi'out telling father, and getting his\nleave.'\n\nAnd then she began to cry pitifully, and to say unconnected things,\ntill Sylvia, to soothe her, took her hand, and promised never to\nleave the house without asking her husband's permission, though in\nmaking this promise, she felt as if she were sacrificing her last\npleasure to her mother's wish; for she knew well enough that Philip\nwould always raise objections to the rambles which reminded her of\nher old free open-air life.\n\nBut to comfort and cherish her mother she would have done anything;\nyet this very morning that was dawning, she must go and ask his\npermission for a simple errand, or break her word.\n\nShe knew from experience that nothing quieted her mother so well as\nbalm-tea; it might be that the herb really possessed some sedative\npower; it might be only early faith, and often repeated experience,\nbut it had always had a tranquillizing effect; and more than once,\nduring the restless hours of the night, Mrs. Robson had asked for it;\nbut Sylvia's stock of last year's dead leaves was exhausted. Still\nshe knew where a plant of balm grew in the sheltered corner of\nHaytersbank Farm garden; she knew that the tenants who had succeeded\nthem in the occupation of the farm had had to leave it in\nconsequence of a death, and that the place was unoccupied; and in\nthe darkness she had planned that if she could leave her mother\nafter the dawn came, and she had attended to her baby, she would\nwalk quickly to the old garden, and gather the tender sprigs which\nshe was sure to find there.\n\nNow she must go and ask Philip; and till she held her baby to her\nbreast, she bitterly wished that she were free from the duties and\nchains of matrimony. But the touch of its waxen fingers, the hold of\nits little mouth, made her relax into docility and gentleness. She\ngave it back to Nancy to be dressed, and softly opened the door of\nPhilip's bed-room.\n\n'Philip!' said she, gently. 'Philip!'\n\nHe started up from dreams of her; of her, angry. He saw her there,\nrather pale with her night's watch and anxiety, but looking meek,\nand a little beseeching.\n\n'Mother has had such a bad night! she fancied once as some balm-tea\nwould do her good--it allays used to: but my dried balm is all gone,\nand I thought there'd be sure to be some in t' old garden at\nHaytersbank. Feyther planted a bush just for mother, wheere it\nallays came up early, nigh t' old elder-tree; and if yo'd not mind,\nI could run theere while she sleeps, and be back again in an hour,\nand it's not seven now.'\n\n'Thou's not wear thyself out with running, Sylvie,' said Philip,\neagerly; 'I'll get up and go myself, or, perhaps,' continued he,\ncatching the shadow that was coming over her face, 'thou'd rather go\nthyself: it's only that I'm so afraid of thy tiring thyself.'\n\n'It'll not tire me,' said Sylvia. 'Afore I was married, I was out\noften far farther than that, afield to fetch up t' kine, before my\nbreakfast.'\n\n'Well, go if thou will,' said Philip. 'But get somewhat to eat\nfirst, and don't hurry; there's no need for that.'\n\nShe had got her hat and shawl, and was off before he had finished\nhis last words.\n\nThe long High Street was almost empty of people at that early hour;\none side was entirely covered by the cool morning shadow which lay\non the pavement, and crept up the opposite houses till only the\ntopmost story caught the rosy sunlight. Up the hill-road, through\nthe gap in the stone wall, across the dewy fields, Sylvia went by\nthe very shortest path she knew.\n\nShe had only once been at Haytersbank since her wedding-day. On that\noccasion the place had seemed strangely and dissonantly changed by\nthe numerous children who were diverting themselves before the open\ndoor, and whose playthings and clothes strewed the house-place, and\nmade it one busy scene of confusion and untidiness, more like the\nCorneys' kitchen in former times, than her mother's orderly and\nquiet abode. Those little children were fatherless now; and the\nhouse was shut up, awaiting the entry of some new tenant. There were\nno shutters to shut; the long low window was blinking in the rays of\nthe morning sun; the house and cow-house doors were closed, and no\npoultry wandered about the field in search of stray grains of corn,\nor early worms. It was a strange and unfamiliar silence, and struck\nsolemnly on Sylvia's mind. Only a thrush in the old orchard down in\nthe hollow, out of sight, whistled and gurgled with continual shrill\nmelody.\n\nSylvia went slowly past the house and down the path leading to the\nwild, deserted bit of garden. She saw that the last tenants had had\na pump sunk for them, and resented the innovation, as though the\nwell she was passing could feel the insult. Over it grew two\nhawthorn trees; on the bent trunk of one of them she used to sit,\nlong ago: the charm of the position being enhanced by the possible\ndanger of falling into the well and being drowned. The rusty unused\nchain was wound round the windlass; the bucket was falling to pieces\nfrom dryness. A lean cat came from some outhouse, and mewed\npitifully with hunger; accompanying Sylvia to the garden, as if glad\nof some human companionship, yet refusing to allow itself to be\ntouched. Primroses grew in the sheltered places, just as they\nformerly did; and made the uncultivated ground seem less deserted\nthan the garden, where the last year's weeds were rotting away, and\ncumbering the ground.\n\nSylvia forced her way through the berry bushes to the herb-plot, and\nplucked the tender leaves she had come to seek; sighing a little all\nthe time. Then she retraced her steps; paused softly before the\nhouse-door, and entered the porch and kissed the senseless wood.\n\nShe tried to tempt the poor gaunt cat into her arms, meaning to\ncarry it home and befriend it; but it was scared by her endeavour\nand ran back to its home in the outhouse, making a green path across\nthe white dew of the meadow. Then Sylvia began to hasten home,\nthinking, and remembering--at the stile that led into the road she\nwas brought short up.\n\nSome one stood in the lane just on the other side of the gap; his\nback was to the morning sun; all she saw at first was the uniform of\na naval officer, so well known in Monkshaven in those days.\n\nSylvia went hurrying past him, not looking again, although her\nclothes almost brushed his, as he stood there still. She had not\ngone a yard--no, not half a yard--when her heart leaped up and fell\nagain dead within her, as if she had been shot.\n\n'Sylvia!' he said, in a voice tremulous with joy and passionate\nlove. 'Sylvia!'\n\nShe looked round; he had turned a little, so that the light fell\nstraight on his face. It was bronzed, and the lines were\nstrengthened; but it was the same face she had last seen in\nHaytersbank Gully three long years ago, and had never thought to see\nin life again.\n\nHe was close to her and held out his fond arms; she went fluttering\ntowards their embrace, as if drawn by the old fascination; but when\nshe felt them close round her, she started away, and cried out with\na great pitiful shriek, and put her hands up to her forehead as if\ntrying to clear away some bewildering mist.\n\nThen she looked at him once more, a terrible story in her eyes, if\nhe could but have read it.\n\nTwice she opened her stiff lips to speak, and twice the words were\noverwhelmed by the surges of her misery, which bore them back into\nthe depths of her heart.\n\nHe thought that he had come upon her too suddenly, and he attempted\nto soothe her with soft murmurs of love, and to woo her to his\noutstretched hungry arms once more. But when she saw this motion of\nhis, she made a gesture as though pushing him away; and with an\ninarticulate moan of agony she put her hands to her head once more,\nand turning away began to run blindly towards the town for\nprotection.\n\nFor a minute or so he was stunned with surprise at her behaviour;\nand then he thought it accounted for by the shock of his accost, and\nthat she needed time to understand the unexpected joy. So he\nfollowed her swiftly, ever keeping her in view, but not trying to\novertake her too speedily.\n\n'I have frightened my poor love,' he kept thinking. And by this\nthought he tried to repress his impatience and check the speed he\nlonged to use; yet he was always so near behind that her quickened\nsense heard his well-known footsteps following, and a mad notion\nflashed across her brain that she would go to the wide full river,\nand end the hopeless misery she felt enshrouding her. There was a\nsure hiding-place from all human reproach and heavy mortal woe\nbeneath the rushing waters borne landwards by the morning tide.\n\nNo one can tell what changed her course; perhaps the thought of her\nsucking child; perhaps her mother; perhaps an angel of God; no one\non earth knows, but as she ran along the quay-side she all at once\nturned up an entry, and through an open door.\n\nHe, following all the time, came into a quiet dark parlour, with a\ncloth and tea-things on the table ready for breakfast; the change\nfrom the bright sunny air out of doors to the deep shadow of this\nroom made him think for the first moment that she had passed on, and\nthat no one was there, and he stood for an instant baffled, and\nhearing no sound but the beating of his own heart; but an\nirrepressible sobbing gasp made him look round, and there he saw her\ncowered behind the door, her face covered tight up, and sharp\nshudders going through her whole frame.\n\n'My love, my darling!' said he, going up to her, and trying to raise\nher, and to loosen her hands away from her face. 'I've been too\nsudden for thee: it was thoughtless in me; but I have so looked\nforward to this time, and seeing thee come along the field, and go\npast me, but I should ha' been more tender and careful of thee. Nay!\nlet me have another look of thy sweet face.'\n\nAll this he whispered in the old tones of manoeuvring love, in that\nvoice she had yearned and hungered to hear in life, and had not\nheard, for all her longing, save in her dreams.\n\nShe tried to crouch more and more into the corner, into the hidden\nshadow--to sink into the ground out of sight.\n\nOnce more he spoke, beseeching her to lift up her face, to let him\nhear her speak.\n\nBut she only moaned.\n\n'Sylvia!' said he, thinking he could change his tactics, and pique\nher into speaking, that he would make a pretence of suspicion and\noffence.\n\n'Sylvia! one would think you weren't glad to see me back again at\nlength. I only came in late last night, and my first thought on\nwakening was of you; it has been ever since I left you.'\n\nSylvia took her hands away from her face; it was gray as the face of\ndeath; her awful eyes were passionless in her despair.\n\n'Where have yo' been?' she asked, in slow, hoarse tones, as if her\nvoice were half strangled within her.\n\n'Been!' said he, a red light coming into his eyes, as he bent his\nlooks upon her; now, indeed, a true and not an assumed suspicion\nentering his mind.\n\n'Been!' he repeated; then, coming a step nearer to her, and taking\nher hand, not tenderly this time, but with a resolution to be\nsatisfied.\n\n'Did not your cousin--Hepburn, I mean--did not he tell you?--he saw\nthe press-gang seize me,--I gave him a message to you--I bade you\nkeep true to me as I would be to you.'\n\nBetween every clause of this speech he paused and gasped for her\nanswer; but none came. Her eyes dilated and held his steady gaze\nprisoner as with a magical charm--neither could look away from the\nother's wild, searching gaze. When he had ended, she was silent for\na moment, then she cried out, shrill and fierce,--\n\n'Philip!' No answer.\n\nWilder and shriller still, 'Philip!' she cried.\n\nHe was in the distant ware-room completing the last night's work\nbefore the regular shop hours began; before breakfast, also, that\nhis wife might not find him waiting and impatient.\n\nHe heard her cry; it cut through doors, and still air, and great\nbales of woollen stuff; he thought that she had hurt herself, that\nher mother was worse, that her baby was ill, and he hastened to the\nspot whence the cry proceeded.\n\nOn opening the door that separated the shop from the sitting-room,\nhe saw the back of a naval officer, and his wife on the ground,\nhuddled up in a heap; when she perceived him come in, she dragged\nherself up by means of a chair, groping like a blind person, and\ncame and stood facing him.\n\nThe officer turned fiercely round, and would have come towards\nPhilip, who was so bewildered by the scene that even yet he did not\nunderstand who the stranger was, did not perceive for an instant\nthat he saw the realization of his greatest dread.\n\nBut Sylvia laid her hand on Kinraid's arm, and assumed to herself\nthe right of speech. Philip did not know her voice, it was so\nchanged.\n\n'Philip,' she said, 'this is Kinraid come back again to wed me. He\nis alive; he has niver been dead, only taken by t' press-gang. And\nhe says yo' saw it, and knew it all t' time. Speak, was it so?'\n\nPhilip knew not what to say, whither to turn, under what refuge of\nwords or acts to shelter.\n\nSylvia's influence was keeping Kinraid silent, but he was rapidly\npassing beyond it.\n\n'Speak!' he cried, loosening himself from Sylvia's light grasp, and\ncoming towards Philip, with a threatening gesture. 'Did I not bid\nyou tell her how it was? Did I not bid you say how I would be\nfaithful to her, and she was to be faithful to me? Oh! you damned\nscoundrel! have you kept it from her all that time, and let her\nthink me dead, or false? Take that!'\n\nHis closed fist was up to strike the man, who hung his head with\nbitterest shame and miserable self-reproach; but Sylvia came swift\nbetween the blow and its victim.\n\n'Charley, thou shan't strike him,' she said. 'He is a damned\nscoundrel' (this was said in the hardest, quietest tone) 'but he is\nmy husband.'\n\n'Oh! thou false heart!' exclaimed Kinraid, turning sharp on her. 'If\never I trusted woman, I trusted you, Sylvia Robson.'\n\nHe made as though throwing her from him, with a gesture of contempt\nthat stung her to life.\n\n'Oh, Charley!' she cried, springing to him, 'dunnot cut me to the\nquick; have pity on me, though he had none. I did so love thee; it\nwas my very heart-strings as gave way when they told me thou was\ndrowned--feyther, and th' Corneys, and all, iverybody. Thy hat and\nt' bit o' ribbon I gave thee were found drenched and dripping wi'\nsea-water; and I went mourning for thee all the day long--dunnot\nturn away from me; only hearken this once, and then kill me dead,\nand I'll bless yo',--and have niver been mysel' since; niver ceased\nto feel t' sun grow dark and th' air chill and dreary when I thought\non t' time when thou was alive. I did, my Charley, my own love! And\nI thought thou was dead for iver, and I wished I were lying beside\nthee. Oh, Charley! Philip, theere, where he stands, could tell yo'\nthis was true. Philip, wasn't it so?'\n\n'Would God I were dead!' moaned forth the unhappy, guilty man. But\nshe had turned to Kinraid, and was speaking again to him, and\nneither of them heard or heeded him--they were drawing closer and\ncloser together--she, with her cheeks and eyes aflame, talking\neagerly.\n\n'And feyther was taken up, and all for setting some free as t'\npress-gang had gotten by a foul trick; and he were put i' York\nprison, and tried, and hung!--hung! Charley!--good kind feyther was\nhung on a gallows; and mother lost her sense and grew silly in\ngrief, and we were like to be turned out on t' wide world, and poor\nmother dateless--and I thought yo' were dead--oh! I thought yo' were\ndead, I did--oh, Charley, Charley!'\n\nBy this time they were in each other's arms, she with her head on\nhis shoulder, crying as if her heart would break.\n\nPhilip came forwards and took hold of her to pull her away; but\nCharley held her tight, mutely defying Philip. Unconsciously she was\nPhilip's protection, in that hour of danger, from a blow which might\nhave been his death if strong will could have aided it to kill.\n\n'Sylvie!' said he, grasping her tight. 'Listen to me. He didn't love\nyo' as I did. He had loved other women. I, yo'--yo' alone. He loved\nother girls before yo', and had left off loving 'em. I--I wish God\nwould free my heart from the pang; but it will go on till I die,\nwhether yo' love me or not. And then--where was I? Oh! that very\nnight that he was taken, I was a-thinking on yo' and on him; and I\nmight ha' given yo' his message, but I heard them speaking of him as\nknew him well; talking of his false fickle ways. How was I to know\nhe would keep true to thee? It might be a sin in me, I cannot say;\nmy heart and my sense are gone dead within me. I know this, I've\nloved yo' as no man but me ever loved before. Have some pity and\nforgiveness on me, if it's only because I've been so tormented with\nmy love.'\n\nHe looked at her with feverish eager wistfulness; it faded away into\ndespair as she made no sign of having even heard his words. He let\ngo his hold of her, and his arm fell loosely by his side.\n\n'I may die,' he said, 'for my life is ended!'\n\n'Sylvia!' spoke out Kinraid, bold and fervent, 'your marriage is no\nmarriage. You were tricked into it. You are my wife, not his. I am\nyour husband; we plighted each other our troth. See! here is my half\nof the sixpence.'\n\nHe pulled it out from his bosom, tied by a black ribbon round his\nneck.\n\n'When they stripped me and searched me in th' French prison, I\nmanaged to keep this. No lies can break the oath we swore to each\nother. I can get your pretence of a marriage set aside. I'm in\nfavour with my admiral, and he'll do a deal for me, and back me out.\nCome with me; your marriage shall be set aside, and we'll be married\nagain, all square and above-board. Come away. Leave that damned\nfellow to repent of the trick he played an honest sailor; we'll be\ntrue, whatever has come and gone. Come, Sylvia.'\n\nHis arm was round her waist, and he was drawing her towards the\ndoor, his face all crimson with eagerness and hope. Just then the\nbaby cried.\n\n'Hark!' said she, starting away from Kinraid, 'baby's crying for me.\nHis child--yes, it is his child--I'd forgotten that--forgotten all.\nI'll make my vow now, lest I lose mysel' again. I'll never forgive\nyon man, nor live with him as his wife again. All that's done and\nended. He's spoilt my life,--he's spoilt it for as long as iver I\nlive on this earth; but neither yo' nor him shall spoil my soul. It\ngoes hard wi' me, Charley, it does indeed. I'll just give yo' one\nkiss--one little kiss--and then, so help me God, I'll niver see nor\nhear till--no, not that, not that is needed--I'll niver see--sure\nthat's enough--I'll never see yo' again on this side heaven, so help\nme God! I'm bound and tied, but I've sworn my oath to him as well as\nyo': there's things I will do, and there's things I won't. Kiss me\nonce more. God help me, he's gone!'\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIV\n\nA RECKLESS RECRUIT\n\n\nShe lay across a chair, her arms helplessly stretched out, her face\nunseen. Every now and then a thrill ran through her body: she was\ntalking to herself all the time with incessant low incontinence of\nwords.\n\nPhilip stood near her, motionless: he did not know whether she was\nconscious of his presence; in fact, he knew nothing but that he and\nshe were sundered for ever; he could only take in that one idea, and\nit numbed all other thought.\n\nOnce more her baby cried for the comfort she alone could give.\n\nShe rose to her feet, but staggered when she tried to walk; her\nglazed eyes fell upon Philip as he instinctively made a step to hold\nher steady. No light came into her eyes any more than if she had\nlooked upon a perfect stranger; not even was there the contraction\nof dislike. Some other figure filled her mind, and she saw him no\nmore than she saw the inanimate table. That way of looking at him\nwithered him up more than any sign of aversion would have done.\n\nHe watched her laboriously climb the stairs, and vanish out of\nsight; and sat down with a sudden feeling of extreme bodily\nweakness.\n\nThe door of communication between the parlour and the shop was\nopened. That was the first event of which Philip took note; but\nPhoebe had come in unawares to him, with the intention of removing\nthe breakfast things on her return from market, and seeing them\nunused, and knowing that Sylvia had sate up all night with her\nmother, she had gone back to the kitchen. Philip had neither seen\nnor heard her.\n\nNow Coulson came in, amazed at Hepburn's non-appearance in the shop.\n\n'Why! Philip, what's ado? How ill yo' look, man!' exclaimed he,\nthoroughly alarmed by Philip's ghastly appearance. 'What's the\nmatter?'\n\n'I!' said Philip, slowly gathering his thoughts. 'Why should there\nbe anything the matter?'\n\nHis instinct, quicker to act than his reason, made him shrink from\nhis misery being noticed, much more made any subject for explanation\nor sympathy.\n\n'There may be nothing the matter wi' thee,' said Coulson, 'but\nthou's the look of a corpse on thy face. I was afeared something was\nwrong, for it's half-past nine, and thee so punctual!'\n\nHe almost guarded Philip into the shop, and kept furtively watching\nhim, and perplexing himself with Philip's odd, strange ways.\n\nHester, too, observed the heavy broken-down expression on Philip's\nashen face, and her heart ached for him; but after that first\nglance, which told her so much, she avoided all appearance of\nnoticing or watching. Only a shadow brooded over her sweet, calm\nface, and once or twice she sighed to herself.\n\nIt was market-day, and people came in and out, bringing their store\nof gossip from the country, or the town--from the farm or the\nquay-side.\n\nAmong the pieces of news, the rescue of the smack the night before\nfurnished a large topic; and by-and-by Philip heard a name that\nstartled him into attention.\n\nThe landlady of a small public-house much frequented by sailors was\ntalking to Coulson.\n\n'There was a sailor aboard of her as knowed Kinraid by sight, in\nShields, years ago; and he called him by his name afore they were\nwell out o' t' river. And Kinraid was no ways set up, for all his\nlieutenant's uniform (and eh! but they say he looks handsome in\nit!); but he tells 'm all about it--how he was pressed aboard a\nman-o'-war, an' for his good conduct were made a warrant officer,\nboatswain, or something!'\n\nAll the people in the shop were listening now; Philip alone seemed\nengrossed in folding up a piece of cloth, so as to leave no possible\nchance of creases in it; yet he lost not a syllable of the good\nwoman's narration.\n\nShe, pleased with the enlarged audience her tale had attracted, went\non with fresh vigour.\n\n'An' there's a gallant captain, one Sir Sidney Smith, and he'd a\nnotion o' goin' smack into a French port, an' carryin' off a vessel\nfrom right under their very noses; an' says he, \"Which of yo'\nBritish sailors 'll go along with me to death or glory?\" So Kinraid\nstands up like a man, an' \"I'll go with yo', captain,\" he says. So\nthey, an' some others as brave, went off, an' did their work, an'\nchoose whativer it was, they did it famously; but they got caught by\nthem French, an' were clapped into prison i' France for iver so\nlong; but at last one Philip--Philip somethin' (he were a Frenchman,\nI know)--helped 'em to escape, in a fishin'-boat. But they were\nwelcomed by th' whole British squadron as was i' t' Channel for t'\npiece of daring they'd done i' cuttin' out t' ship from a French\nport; an' Captain Sir Sidney Smith was made an admiral, an' him as\nwe used t' call Charley Kinraid, the specksioneer, is made a\nlieutenant, an' a commissioned officer i' t' King's service; and is\ncome to great glory, and slep in my house this very blessed night as\nis just past!'\n\nA murmur of applause and interest and rejoicing buzzed all around\nPhilip. All this was publicly known about Kinraid,--and how much\nmore? All Monkshaven might hear tomorrow--nay, to-day--of Philip's\ntreachery to the hero of the hour; how he had concealed his fate,\nand supplanted him in his love.\n\nPhilip shrank from the burst of popular indignation which he knew\nmust follow. Any wrong done to one who stands on the pinnacle of the\npeople's favour is resented by each individual as a personal injury;\nand among a primitive set of country-folk, who recognize the wild\npassion in love, as it exists untamed by the trammels of reason and\nself-restraint, any story of baulked affections, or treachery in\nsuch matters, spreads like wildfire.\n\nPhilip knew this quite well; his doom of disgrace lay plain before\nhim, if only Kinraid spoke the word. His head was bent down while he\nthus listened and reflected. He half resolved on doing something; he\nlifted up his head, caught the reflection of his face in the little\nstrip of glass on the opposite side, in which the women might look\nat themselves in their contemplated purchases, and quite resolved.\n\nThe sight he saw in the mirror was his own long, sad, pale face,\nmade plainer and grayer by the heavy pressure of the morning's\nevents. He saw his stooping figure, his rounded shoulders, with\nsomething like a feeling of disgust at his personal appearance as he\nremembered the square, upright build of Kinraid; his fine uniform,\nwith epaulette and sword-belt; his handsome brown face; his dark\neyes, splendid with the fire of passion and indignation; his white\nteeth, gleaming out with the terrible smile of scorn.\n\nThe comparison drove Philip from passive hopelessness to active\ndespair.\n\nHe went abruptly from the crowded shop into the empty parlour, and\non into the kitchen, where he took up a piece of bread, and heedless\nof Phoebe's look and words, began to eat it before he even left the\nplace; for he needed the strength that food would give; he needed it\nto carry him out of the sight and the knowledge of all who might\nhear what he had done, and point their fingers at him.\n\nHe paused a moment in the parlour, and then, setting his teeth tight\ntogether, he went upstairs.\n\nFirst of all he went into the bit of a room opening out of theirs,\nin which his baby slept. He dearly loved the child, and many a time\nwould run in and play a while with it; and in such gambols he and\nSylvia had passed their happiest moments of wedded life.\n\nThe little Bella was having her morning slumber; Nancy used to tell\nlong afterwards how he knelt down by the side of her cot, and was so\nstrange she thought he must have prayed, for all it was nigh upon\neleven o'clock, and folk in their senses only said their prayers\nwhen they got up, and when they went to bed.\n\nThen he rose, and stooped over, and gave the child a long,\nlingering, soft, fond kiss. And on tip-toe he passed away into the\nroom where his aunt lay; his aunt who had been so true a friend to\nhim! He was thankful to know that in her present state she was safe\nfrom the knowledge of what was past, safe from the sound of the\nshame to come.\n\nHe had not meant to see Sylvia again; he dreaded the look of her\nhatred, her scorn, but there, outside her mother's bed, she lay,\napparently asleep. Mrs. Robson, too, was sleeping, her face towards\nthe wall. Philip could not help it; he went to have one last look at\nhis wife. She was turned towards her mother, her face averted from\nhim; he could see the tear-stains, the swollen eyelids, the lips yet\nquivering: he stooped down, and bent to kiss the little hand that\nlay listless by her side. As his hot breath neared that hand it was\ntwitched away, and a shiver ran through the whole prostrate body.\nAnd then he knew that she was not asleep, only worn out by her\nmisery,--misery that he had caused.\n\nHe sighed heavily; but he went away, down-stairs, and away for ever.\nOnly as he entered the parlour his eyes caught on two silhouettes,\none of himself, one of Sylvia, done in the first month of their\nmarriage, by some wandering artist, if so he could be called. They\nwere hanging against the wall in little oval wooden frames; black\nprofiles, with the lights done in gold; about as poor semblances of\nhumanity as could be conceived; but Philip went up, and after\nlooking for a minute or so at Sylvia's, he took it down, and\nbuttoned his waistcoat over it.\n\nIt was the only thing he took away from his home.\n\nHe went down the entry on to the quay. The river was there, and\nwaters, they say, have a luring power, and a weird promise of rest\nin their perpetual monotony of sound. But many people were there, if\nsuch a temptation presented itself to Philip's mind; the sight of\nhis fellow-townsmen, perhaps of his acquaintances, drove him up\nanother entry--the town is burrowed with such--back into the High\nStreet, which he straightway crossed into a well-known court, out of\nwhich rough steps led to the summit of the hill, and on to the fells\nand moors beyond.\n\nHe plunged and panted up this rough ascent. From the top he could\nlook down on the whole town lying below, severed by the bright\nshining river into two parts. To the right lay the sea, shimmering\nand heaving; there were the cluster of masts rising out of the\nlittle port; the irregular roofs of the houses; which of them,\nthought he, as he carried his eye along the quay-side to the\nmarket-place, which of them was his? and he singled it out in its\nunfamiliar aspect, and saw the thin blue smoke rising from the\nkitchen chimney, where even now Phoebe was cooking the household\nmeal that he never more must share.\n\nUp at that thought and away, he knew not nor cared not whither. He\nwent through the ploughed fields where the corn was newly springing;\nhe came down upon the vast sunny sea, and turned his back upon it\nwith loathing; he made his way inland to the high green pastures;\nthe short upland turf above which the larks hung poised 'at heaven's\ngate'. He strode along, so straight and heedless of briar and bush,\nthat the wild black cattle ceased from grazing, and looked after him\nwith their great blank puzzled eyes.\n\nHe had passed all enclosures and stone fences now, and was fairly on\nthe desolate brown moors; through the withered last year's ling and\nfern, through the prickly gorse, he tramped, crushing down the\ntender shoots of this year's growth, and heedless of the startled\nplover's cry, goaded by the furies. His only relief from thought,\nfrom the remembrance of Sylvia's looks and words, was in violent\nbodily action.\n\nSo he went on till evening shadows and ruddy evening lights came out\nupon the wild fells.\n\nHe had crossed roads and lanes, with a bitter avoidance of men's\ntracks; but now the strong instinct of self-preservation came out,\nand his aching limbs, his weary heart, giving great pants and beats\nfor a time, and then ceasing altogether till a mist swam and\nquivered before his aching eyes, warned him that he must find some\nshelter and food, or lie down to die. He fell down now, often;\nstumbling over the slightest obstacle. He had passed the cattle\npastures; he was among the black-faced sheep; and they, too, ceased\nnibbling, and looked after him, and somehow, in his poor wandering\nimagination, their silly faces turned to likenesses of Monkshaven\npeople--people who ought to be far, far away.\n\n'Thou'll be belated on these fells, if thou doesn't tak' heed,'\nshouted some one.\n\nPhilip looked abroad to see whence the voice proceeded.\n\nAn old stiff-legged shepherd, in a smock-frock, was within a couple\nof hundred yards. Philip did not answer, but staggered and stumbled\ntowards him.\n\n'Good lork!' said the man, 'wheere hast ta been? Thou's seen Oud\nHarry, I think, thou looks so scared.'\n\nPhilip rallied himself, and tried to speak up to the old standard of\nrespectability; but the effort was pitiful to see, had any one been\nby, who could have understood the pain it caused to restrain cries\nof bodily and mental agony.\n\n'I've lost my way, that's all.'\n\n''Twould ha' been enough, too, I'm thinkin', if I hadn't come out\nafter t' ewes. There's t' Three Griffins near at hand: a sup o'\nHollands 'll set thee to reeghts.'\n\nPhilip followed faintly. He could not see before him, and was guided\nby the sound of footsteps rather than by the sight of the figure\nmoving onwards. He kept stumbling; and he knew that the old shepherd\nswore at him; but he also knew such curses proceeded from no\nill-will, only from annoyance at the delay in going and 'seem' after\nt' ewes.' But had the man's words conveyed the utmost expression of\nhatred, Philip would neither have wondered at them, nor resented\nthem.\n\nThey came into a wild mountain road, unfenced from the fells. A\nhundred yards off, and there was a small public-house, with a broad\nruddy oblong of firelight shining across the tract.\n\n'Theere!' said the old man. 'Thee cannot well miss that. A dunno\ntho', thee bees sich a gawby.'\n\nSo he went on, and delivered Philip safely up to the landlord.\n\n'Here's a felly as a fund on t' fell side, just as one as if he were\ndrunk; but he's sober enough, a reckon, only summat's wrong i' his\nhead, a'm thinkin'.'\n\n'No!' said Philip, sitting down on the first chair he came to. 'I'm\nright enough; just fairly wearied out: lost my way,' and he fainted.\n\nThere was a recruiting sergeant of marines sitting in the\nhouse-place, drinking. He, too, like Philip, had lost his way; but\nwas turning his blunder to account by telling all manner of\nwonderful stories to two or three rustics who had come in ready to\ndrink on any pretence; especially if they could get good liquor\nwithout paying for it.\n\nThe sergeant rose as Philip fell back, and brought up his own mug of\nbeer, into which a noggin of gin had been put (called in Yorkshire\n'dog's-nose'). He partly poured and partly spilt some of this\nbeverage on Philip's face; some drops went through the pale and\nparted lips, and with a start the worn-out man revived.\n\n'Bring him some victual, landlord,' called out the recruiting\nsergeant. 'I'll stand shot.'\n\nThey brought some cold bacon and coarse oat-cake. The sergeant asked\nfor pepper and salt; minced the food fine and made it savoury, and\nkept administering it by teaspoonfuls; urging Philip to drink from\ntime to time from his own cup of dog's-nose.\n\nA burning thirst, which needed no stimulant from either pepper or\nsalt, took possession of Philip, and he drank freely, scarcely\nrecognizing what he drank. It took effect on one so habitually\nsober; and he was soon in that state when the imagination works\nwildly and freely.\n\nHe saw the sergeant before him, handsome, and bright, and active, in\nhis gay red uniform, without a care, as it seemed to Philip, taking\nlife lightly; admired and respected everywhere because of his cloth.\n\nIf Philip were gay, and brisk, well-dressed like him, returning with\nmartial glory to Monkshaven, would not Sylvia love him once more?\nCould not he win her heart? He was brave by nature, and the prospect\nof danger did not daunt him, if ever it presented itself to his\nimagination.\n\nHe thought he was cautious in entering on the subject of enlistment\nwith his new friend, the sergeant; but the latter was twenty times\nas cunning as he, and knew by experience how to bait his hook.\n\nPhilip was older by some years than the regulation age; but, at that\ntime of great demand for men, the question of age was lightly\nentertained. The sergeant was profuse in statements of the\nadvantages presented to a man of education in his branch of the\nservice; how such a one was sure to rise; in fact, it would have\nseemed from the sergeant's account, as though the difficulty\nconsisted in remaining in the ranks.\n\nPhilip's dizzy head thought the subject over and over again, each\ntime with failing power of reason.\n\nAt length, almost, as it would seem, by some sleight of hand, he\nfound the fatal shilling in his palm, and had promised to go before\nthe nearest magistrate to be sworn in as one of his Majesty's\nmarines the next morning. And after that he remembered nothing more.\n\nHe wakened up in a little truckle-bed in the same room as the\nsergeant, who lay sleeping the sleep of full contentment; while\ngradually, drop by drop, the bitter recollections of the day before\ncame, filling up Philip's cup of agony.\n\nHe knew that he had received the bounty-money; and though he was\naware that he had been partly tricked into it, and had no hope, no\ncare, indeed, for any of the advantages so liberally promised him\nthe night before, yet he was resigned, with utterly despondent\npassiveness, to the fate to which he had pledged himself. Anything\nwas welcome that severed him from his former life, that could make\nhim forget it, if that were possible; and also welcome anything\nwhich increased the chances of death without the sinfulness of his\nown participation in the act. He found in the dark recess of his\nmind the dead body of his fancy of the previous night; that he might\ncome home, handsome and glorious, to win the love that had never\nbeen his.\n\nBut he only sighed over it, and put it aside out of his sight--so\nfull of despair was he. He could eat no breakfast, though the\nsergeant ordered of the best. The latter kept watching his new\nrecruit out of the corner of his eye, expecting a remonstrance, or\ndreading a sudden bolt.\n\nBut Philip walked with him the two or three miles in the most\nsubmissive silence, never uttering a syllable of regret or\nrepentance; and before Justice Cholmley, of Holm-Fell Hall, he was\nsworn into his Majesty's service, under the name of Stephen Freeman.\nWith a new name, he began a new life. Alas! the old life lives for\never!\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXV\n\nTHINGS UNUTTERABLE\n\n\nAfter Philip had passed out of the room, Sylvia lay perfectly still,\nfrom very exhaustion. Her mother slept on, happily unconscious of\nall the turmoil that had taken place; yes, happily, though the heavy\nsleep was to end in death. But of this her daughter knew nothing,\nimagining that it was refreshing slumber, instead of an ebbing of\nlife. Both mother and daughter lay motionless till Phoebe entered\nthe room to tell Sylvia that dinner was on the table.\n\nThen Sylvia sate up, and put back her hair, bewildered and uncertain\nas to what was to be done next; how she should meet the husband to\nwhom she had discarded all allegiance, repudiated the solemn promise\nof love and obedience which she had vowed.\n\nPhoebe came into the room, with natural interest in the invalid,\nscarcely older than herself.\n\n'How is t' old lady?' asked she, in a low voice.\n\nSylvia turned her head round to look; her mother had never moved,\nbut was breathing in a loud uncomfortable manner, that made her\nstoop over her to see the averted face more nearly.\n\n'Phoebe!' she cried, 'come here! She looks strange and odd; her eyes\nare open, but don't see me. Phoebe! Phoebe!'\n\n'Sure enough, she's in a bad way!' said Phoebe, climbing stiffly on\nto the bed to have a nearer view. 'Hold her head a little up t' ease\nher breathin' while I go for master; he'll be for sendin' for t'\ndoctor, I'll be bound.'\n\nSylvia took her mother's head and laid it fondly on her breast,\nspeaking to her and trying to rouse her; but it was of no avail: the\nhard, stertorous breathing grew worse and worse.\n\nSylvia cried out for help; Nancy came, the baby in her arms. They\nhad been in several times before that morning; and the child came\nsmiling and crowing at its mother, who was supporting her own dying\nparent.\n\n'Oh, Nancy!' said Sylvia; 'what is the matter with mother? yo' can\nsee her face; tell me quick!'\n\nNancy set the baby on the bed for all reply, and ran out of the\nroom, crying out,\n\n'Master! master! Come quick! T' old missus is a-dying!'\n\nThis appeared to be no news to Sylvia, and yet the words came on her\nwith a great shock, but for all that she could not cry; she was\nsurprised herself at her own deadness of feeling.\n\nHer baby crawled to her, and she had to hold and guard both her\nmother and her child. It seemed a long, long time before any one\ncame, and then she heard muffled voices, and a heavy tramp: it was\nPhoebe leading the doctor upstairs, and Nancy creeping in behind to\nhear his opinion.\n\nHe did not ask many questions, and Phoebe replied more frequently to\nhis inquiries than did Sylvia, who looked into his face with a\nblank, tearless, speechless despair, that gave him more pain than\nthe sight of her dying mother.\n\nThe long decay of Mrs. Robson's faculties and health, of which he was\nwell aware, had in a certain manner prepared him for some such\nsudden termination of the life whose duration was hardly desirable,\nalthough he gave several directions as to her treatment; but the\nwhite, pinched face, the great dilated eye, the slow comprehension\nof the younger woman, struck him with alarm; and he went on asking\nfor various particulars, more with a view of rousing Sylvia, if even\nit were to tears, than for any other purpose that the information\nthus obtained could answer.\n\n'You had best have pillows propped up behind her--it will not be\nfor long; she does not know that you are holding her, and it is only\ntiring you to no purpose!'\n\nSylvia's terrible stare continued: he put his advice into action,\nand gently tried to loosen her clasp, and tender hold. This she\nresisted; laying her cheek against her poor mother's unconscious\nface.\n\n'Where is Hepburn?' said he. 'He ought to be here!'\n\nPhoebe looked at Nancy, Nancy at Phoebe. It was the latter who\nreplied,\n\n'He's neither i' t' house nor i' t' shop. A seed him go past t'\nkitchen window better nor an hour ago; but neither William Coulson\nor Hester Rose knows where he's gone to.\n\nDr Morgan's lips were puckered up into a whistle, but he made no\nsound.\n\n'Give me baby!' he said, suddenly. Nancy had taken her up off the\nbed where she had been sitting, encircled by her mother's arm. The\nnursemaid gave her to the doctor. He watched the mother's eye, it\nfollowed her child, and he was rejoiced. He gave a little pinch to\nthe baby's soft flesh, and she cried out piteously; again the same\naction, the same result. Sylvia laid her mother down, and stretched\nout her arms for her child, hushing it, and moaning over it.\n\n'So far so good!' said Dr Morgan to himself. 'But where is the\nhusband? He ought to be here.' He went down-stairs to make inquiry\nfor Philip; that poor young creature, about whose health he had\nnever felt thoroughly satisfied since the fever after her\nconfinement, was in an anxious condition, and with an inevitable\nshock awaiting her. Her husband ought to be with her, and supporting\nher to bear it.\n\nDr Morgan went into the shop. Hester alone was there. Coulson had\ngone to his comfortable dinner at his well-ordered house, with his\ncommon-place wife. If he had felt anxious about Philip's looks and\nstrange disappearance, he had also managed to account for them in\nsome indifferent way.\n\nHester was alone with the shop-boy; few people came in during the\nuniversal Monkshaven dinner-hour. She was resting her head on her\nhand, and puzzled and distressed about many things--all that was\nimplied by the proceedings of the evening before between Philip and\nSylvia; and that was confirmed by Philip's miserable looks and\nstrange abstracted ways to-day. Oh! how easy Hester would have found\nit to make him happy! not merely how easy, but what happiness it\nwould have been to her to merge her every wish into the one great\nobject of fulfiling his will. To her, an on-looker, the course of\nmarried life, which should lead to perfect happiness, seemed to\nplain! Alas! it is often so! and the resisting forces which make all\nsuch harmony and delight impossible are not recognized by the\nbystanders, hardly by the actors. But if these resisting forces are\nonly superficial, or constitutional, they are but the necessary\ndiscipline here, and do not radically affect the love which will\nmake all things right in heaven.\n\nSome glimmering of this latter comforting truth shed its light on\nHester's troubled thoughts from time to time. But again, how easy\nwould it have been to her to tread the maze that led to Philip's\nhappiness; and how difficult it seemed to the wife he had chosen!\n\nShe was aroused by Dr Morgan's voice.\n\n'So both Coulson and Hepburn have left the shop to your care,\nHester. I want Hepburn, though; his wife is in a very anxious state.\nWhere is he? can you tell me?'\n\n'Sylvia in an anxious state! I've not seen her to-day, but last\nnight she looked as well as could be.'\n\n'Ay, ay; but many a thing happens in four-and-twenty hours. Her\nmother is dying, may be dead by this time; and her husband should be\nthere with her. Can't you send for him?'\n\n'I don't know where he is,' said Hester. 'He went off from here all\non a sudden, when there was all the market-folks in t' shop; I\nthought he'd maybe gone to John Foster's about th' money, for they\nwas paying a deal in. I'll send there and inquire.'\n\nNo! the messenger brought back word that he had not been seen at\ntheir bank all morning. Further inquiries were made by the anxious\nHester, by the doctor, by Coulson; all they could learn was that\nPhoebe had seen him pass the kitchen window about eleven o'clock,\nwhen she was peeling the potatoes for dinner; and two lads playing\non the quay-side thought they had seen him among a group of sailors;\nbut these latter, as far as they could be identified, had no\nknowledge of his appearance among them.\n\nBefore night the whole town was excited about his disappearance.\nBefore night Bell Robson had gone to her long home. And Sylvia still\nlay quiet and tearless, apparently more unmoved than any other\ncreature by the events of the day, and the strange vanishing of her\nhusband.\n\nThe only thing she seemed to care for was her baby; she held it\ntight in her arms, and Dr Morgan bade them leave it there, its touch\nmight draw the desired tears into her weary, sleepless eyes, and\ncharm the aching pain out of them.\n\nThey were afraid lest she should inquire for her husband, whose\nnon-appearance at such a time of sorrow to his wife must (they\nthought) seem strange to her. And night drew on while they were all\nin this state. She had gone back to her own room without a word when\nthey had desired her to do so; caressing her child in her arms, and\nsitting down on the first chair she came to, with a heavy sigh, as\nif even this slight bodily exertion had been too much for her. They\nsaw her eyes turn towards the door every time it was opened, and\nthey thought it was with anxious expectation of one who could not be\nfound, though many were seeking for him in all probable places.\n\nWhen night came some one had to tell her of her husband's\ndisappearance; and Dr Morgan was the person who undertook this.\n\nHe came into her room about nine o'clock; her baby was sleeping in\nher arms; she herself pale as death, still silent and tearless,\nthough strangely watchful of gestures and sounds, and probably\ncognizant of more than they imagined.\n\n'Well, Mrs. Hepburn,' said he, as cheerfully as he could, 'I should\nadvise your going to bed early; for I fancy your husband won't come\nhome to-night. Some journey or other, that perhaps Coulson can\nexplain better than I can, will most likely keep him away till\nto-morrow. It's very unfortunate that he should be away at such a\nsad time as this, as I'm sure he'll feel when he returns; but we\nmust make the best of it.'\n\nHe watched her to see the effect of his words.\n\nShe sighed, that was all. He still remained a little while. She\nlifted her head up a little and asked,\n\n'How long do yo' think she was unconscious, doctor? Could she hear\nthings, think yo', afore she fell into that strange kind o'\nslumber?'\n\n'I cannot tell,' said he, shaking his head. 'Was she breathing in\nthat hard snoring kind of way when you left her this morning?'\n\n'Yes, I think so; I cannot tell, so much has happened.'\n\n'When you came back to her, after your breakfast, I think you said\nshe was in much the same position?'\n\n'Yes, and yet I may be telling yo' lies; if I could but think: but\nit's my head as is aching so; doctor, I wish yo'd go, for I need\nbeing alone, I'm so mazed.'\n\n'Good-night, then, for you're a wise woman, I see, and mean to go to\nbed, and have a good night with baby there.'\n\nBut he went down to Phoebe, and told her to go in from time to time,\nand see how her mistress was.\n\nHe found Hester Rose and the old servant together; both had been\ncrying, both were evidently in great trouble about the death and the\nmystery of the day.\n\nHester asked if she might go up and see Sylvia, and the doctor gave\nhis leave, talking meanwhile with Phoebe over the kitchen fire.\nHester came down again without seeing Sylvia. The door of the room\nwas bolted, and everything quiet inside.\n\n'Does she know where her husband is, think you?' asked the doctor at\nthis account of Hester's. 'She's not anxious about him at any rate:\nor else the shock of her mother's death has been too much for her.\nWe must hope for some change in the morning; a good fit of crying,\nor a fidget about her husband, would be more natural. Good-night to\nyou both,' and off he went.\n\nPhoebe and Hester avoided looking at each other at these words. Both\nwere conscious of the probability of something having gone seriously\nwrong between the husband and wife. Hester had the recollection of\nthe previous night, Phoebe the untasted breakfast of to-day to go\nupon.\n\nShe spoke first.\n\n'A just wish he'd come home to still folks' tongues. It need niver\nha' been known if t' old lady hadn't died this day of all others.\nIt's such a thing for t' shop t' have one o' t' partners missin',\nan' no one for t' know what's comed on him. It niver happened i'\nFosters' days, that's a' I know.'\n\n'He'll maybe come back yet,' said Hester. 'It's not so very late.'\n\n'It were market day, and a',' continued Phoebe, 'just as if\niverything mun go wrong together; an' a' t' country customers'll go\nback wi' fine tale i' their mouths, as Measter Hepburn was strayed\nan' missin' just like a beast o' some kind.'\n\n'Hark! isn't that a step?' said Hester suddenly, as a footfall\nsounded in the now quiet street; but it passed the door, and the\nhope that had arisen on its approach fell as the sound died away.\n\n'He'll noane come to-night,' said Phoebe, who had been as eager a\nlistener as Hester, however. 'Thou'd best go thy ways home; a shall\nstay up, for it's not seemly for us a' t' go to our beds, an' a\ncorpse in t' house; an' Nancy, as might ha' watched, is gone to her\nbed this hour past, like a lazy boots as she is. A can hear, too, if\nt' measter does come home; tho' a'll be bound he wunnot; choose\nwheere he is, he'll be i' bed by now, for it's well on to eleven.\nI'll let thee out by t' shop-door, and stand by it till thou's close\nat home, for it's ill for a young woman to be i' t' street so late.'\n\nSo she held the door open, and shaded the candle from the flickering\nouter air, while Hester went to her home with a heavy heart.\n\nHeavily and hopelessly did they all meet in the morning. No news of\nPhilip, no change in Sylvia; an unceasing flow of angling and\nconjecture and gossip radiating from the shop into the town.\n\nHester could have entreated Coulson on her knees to cease from\nrepeating the details of a story of which every word touched on a\nraw place in her sensitive heart; moreover, when they talked\ntogether so eagerly, she could not hear the coming footsteps on the\npavement without.\n\nOnce some one hit very near the truth in a chance remark.\n\n'It seems strange,' she said, 'how as one man turns up, another just\ndisappears. Why, it were but upo' Tuesday as Kinraid come back, as\nall his own folk had thought to be dead; and next day here's Measter\nHepburn as is gone no one knows wheere!'\n\n'That's t' way i' this world,' replied Coulson, a little\nsententiously. 'This life is full o' changes o' one kind or another;\nthem that's dead is alive; and as for poor Philip, though he was\nalive, he looked fitter to be dead when he came into t' shop o'\nWednesday morning.'\n\n'And how does she take it?' nodding to where Sylvia was supposed to\nbe.\n\n'Oh! she's not herself, so to say. She were just stunned by finding\nher mother was dying in her very arms when she thought as she were\nonly sleeping; yet she's never been able to cry a drop; so that t'\nsorrow's gone inwards on her brain, and from all I can hear, she\ndoesn't rightly understand as her husband is missing. T' doctor says\nif she could but cry, she'd come to a juster comprehension of\nthings.'\n\n'And what do John and Jeremiah Foster say to it all?'\n\n'They're down here many a time in t' day to ask if he's come back,\nor how she is; for they made a deal on 'em both. They're going t'\nattend t' funeral to-morrow, and have given orders as t' shop is to\nbe shut up in t' morning.'\n\nTo the surprise of every one, Sylvia, who had never left her room\nsince the night of her mother's death, and was supposed to be almost\nunconscious of all that was going on in the house, declared her\nintention of following her mother to the grave. No one could do more\nthan remonstrate: no one had sufficient authority to interfere with\nher. Dr Morgan even thought that she might possibly be roused to\ntears by the occasion; only he begged Hester to go with her, that\nshe might have the solace of some woman's company.\n\nShe went through the greater part of the ceremony in the same hard,\nunmoved manner in which she had received everything for days past.\n\nBut on looking up once, as they formed round the open grave, she saw\nKester, in his Sunday clothes, with a bit of new crape round his\nhat, crying as if his heart would break over the coffin of his good,\nkind mistress.\n\nHis evident distress, the unexpected sight, suddenly loosed the\nfountain of Sylvia's tears, and her sobs grew so terrible that\nHester feared she would not be able to remain until the end of the\nfuneral. But she struggled hard to stay till the last, and then she\nmade an effort to go round by the place where Kester stood.\n\n'Come and see me,' was all she could say for crying: and Kester only\nnodded his head--he could not speak a word.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVI\n\nMYSTERIOUS TIDINGS\n\n\nThat very evening Kester came, humbly knocking at the kitchen-door.\nPhoebe opened it. He asked to see Sylvia.\n\n'A know not if she'll see thee,' said Phoebe. 'There's no makin' her\nout; sometimes she's for one thing, sometimes she's for another.'\n\n'She bid me come and see her,' said Kester. 'Only this mornin', at\nmissus' buryin', she telled me to come.'\n\nSo Phoebe went off to inform Sylvia that Kester was there; and\nreturned with the desire that he would walk into the parlour. An\ninstant after he was gone, Phoebe heard him return, and carefully\nshut the two doors of communication between the kitchen and\nsitting-room.\n\nSylvia was in the latter when Kester came in, holding her baby close\nto her; indeed, she seldom let it go now-a-days to any one else,\nmaking Nancy's place quite a sinecure, much to Phoebe's indignation.\n\nSylvia's face was shrunk, and white, and thin; her lovely eyes alone\nretained the youthful, almost childlike, expression. She went up to\nKester, and shook his horny hand, she herself trembling all over.\n\n'Don't talk to me of her,' she said hastily. 'I cannot stand it.\nIt's a blessing for her to be gone, but, oh----'\n\nShe began to cry, and then cheered herself up, and swallowed down\nher sobs.\n\n'Kester,' she went on, hastily, 'Charley Kinraid isn't dead; dost ta\nknow? He's alive, and he were here o' Tuesday--no, Monday, was it? I\ncannot tell--but he were here!'\n\n'A knowed as he weren't dead. Every one is a-speaking on it. But a\ndidn't know as thee'd ha' seen him. A took comfort i' thinkin' as\nthou'd ha' been wi' thy mother a' t' time as he were i' t' place.'\n\n'Then he's gone?' said Sylvia.\n\n'Gone; ay, days past. As far as a know, he but stopped a' neet. A\nthought to mysel' (but yo' may be sure a said nought to nobody),\nhe's heerd as our Sylvia were married, and has put it in his pipe,\nand ta'en hissel' off to smoke it.'\n\n'Kester!' said Sylvia, leaning forwards, and whispering. 'I saw him.\nHe was here. Philip saw him. Philip had known as he wasn't dead a'\nthis time!'\n\nKester stood up suddenly.\n\n'By goom, that chap has a deal t' answer for.'\n\nA bright red spot was on each of Sylvia's white cheeks; and for a\nminute or so neither of them spoke.\n\nThen she went on, still whispering out her words.\n\n'Kester, I'm more afeared than I dare tell any one: can they ha'\nmet, think yo'? T' very thought turns me sick. I told Philip my\nmind, and took a vow again' him--but it would be awful to think on\nharm happening to him through Kinraid. Yet he went out that morning,\nand has niver been seen or heard on sin'; and Kinraid were just fell\nagain' him, and as for that matter, so was I; but----'\n\nThe red spot vanished as she faced her own imagination.\n\nKester spoke.\n\n'It's a thing as can be easy looked into. What day an' time were it\nwhen Philip left this house?'\n\n'Tuesday--the day she died. I saw him in her room that morning\nbetween breakfast and dinner; I could a'most swear to it's being\nclose after eleven. I mind counting t' clock. It was that very morn\nas Kinraid were here.'\n\n'A'll go an' have a pint o' beer at t' King's Arms, down on t'\nquay-side; it were theere he put up at. An' a'm pretty sure as he\nonly stopped one night, and left i' t' morning betimes. But a'll go\nsee.'\n\n'Do,' said Sylvia, 'and go out through t' shop; they're all watching\nand watching me to see how I take things; and daren't let on about\nt' fire as is burning up my heart. Coulson is i' t' shop, but he'll\nnot notice thee like Phoebe.'\n\nBy-and-by Kester came back. It seemed as though Sylvia had never\nstirred; she looked eagerly at him, but did not speak.\n\n'He went away i' Rob Mason's mail-cart, him as tak's t' letters to\nHartlepool. T' lieutenant (as they ca' him down at t' King's Arms;\nthey're as proud on his uniform as if it had been a new-painted sign\nto swing o'er their doors), t' lieutenant had reckoned upo' stayin'\nlonger wi' 'em; but he went out betimes o' Tuesday morn', an' came\nback a' ruffled up, an paid his bill--paid for his breakfast, though\nhe touched noane on it--an' went off i' Rob postman's mail-cart, as\nstarts reg'lar at ten o'clock. Corneys has been theere askin' for\nhim, an' makin' a piece o' work, as he niver went near em; and they\nbees cousins. Niver a one among 'em knows as he were here as far as\na could mak' out.'\n\n'Thank yo', Kester,' said Sylvia, falling back in her chair, as if\nall the energy that had kept her stiff and upright was gone now that\nher anxiety was relieved.\n\nShe was silent for a long time; her eyes shut, her cheek laid on her\nchild's head. Kester spoke next.\n\n'A think it's pretty clear as they'n niver met. But it's a' t' more\nwonder where thy husband's gone to. Thee and him had words about it,\nand thou telled him thy mind, thou said?'\n\n'Yes,' said Sylvia, not moving. 'I'm afeared lest mother knows what\nI said to him, there, where she's gone to--I am-' the tears filled\nher shut eyes, and came softly overflowing down her cheeks; 'and yet\nit were true, what I said, I cannot forgive him; he's just spoilt my\nlife, and I'm not one-and-twenty yet, and he knowed how wretched,\nhow very wretched, I were. A word fra' him would ha' mended it a';\nand Charley had bid him speak the word, and give me his faithful\nlove, and Philip saw my heart ache day after day, and niver let on\nas him I was mourning for was alive, and had sent me word as he'd\nkeep true to me, as I were to do to him.'\n\n'A wish a'd been theere; a'd ha' felled him to t' ground,' said\nKester, clenching his stiff, hard hand with indignation.\n\nSylvia was silent again: pale and weary she sate, her eyes still\nshut.\n\nThen she said,\n\n'Yet he were so good to mother; and mother loved him so. Oh,\nKester!' lifting herself up, opening her great wistful eyes, 'it's\nwell for folks as can die; they're spared a deal o' misery.'\n\n'Ay!' said he. 'But there's folk as one 'ud like to keep fra'\nshirkin' their misery. Think yo' now as Philip is livin'?'\n\nSylvia shivered all over, and hesitated before she replied.\n\n'I dunnot know. I said such things; he deserved 'em all----'\n\n'Well, well, lass!' said Kester, sorry that he had asked the\nquestion which was producing so much emotion of one kind or another.\n'Neither thee nor me can tell; we can neither help nor hinder,\nseein' as he's ta'en hissel' off out on our sight, we'd best not\nthink on him. A'll try an' tell thee some news, if a can think on it\nwi' my mind so full. Thou knows Haytersbank folk ha' flitted, and t'\noud place is empty?'\n\n'Yes!' said Sylvia, with the indifference of one wearied out with\nfeeling.\n\n'A only telled yo' t' account like for me bein' at a loose end i'\nMonkshaven. My sister, her as lived at Dale End an' is a widow, has\ncomed int' town to live; an' a'm lodging wi' her, an' jobbin' about.\nA'm gettin' pretty well to do, an' a'm noane far t' seek, an' a'm\ngoing now: only first a just wanted for t' say as a'm thy oldest\nfriend, a reckon, and if a can do a turn for thee, or go an errand,\nlike as a've done to-day, or if it's any comfort to talk a bit to\none who's known thy life from a babby, why yo've only t' send for\nme, an' a'd come if it were twenty mile. A'm lodgin' at Peggy\nDawson's, t' lath and plaster cottage at t' right hand o' t' bridge,\na' among t' new houses, as they're thinkin' o' buildin' near t' sea:\nno one can miss it.'\n\nHe stood up and shook hands with her. As he did so, he looked at her\nsleeping baby.\n\n'She's liker yo' than him. A think a'll say, God bless her.'\n\nWith the heavy sound of his out-going footsteps, baby awoke. She\nought before this time to have been asleep in her bed, and the\ndisturbance made her cry fretfully.\n\n'Hush thee, darling, hush thee!' murmured her mother; 'there's no\none left to love me but thee, and I cannot stand thy weeping, my\npretty one. Hush thee, my babe, hush thee!'\n\nShe whispered soft in the little one's ear as she took her upstairs\nto bed.\n\nAbout three weeks after the miserable date of Bell Robson's death\nand Philip's disappearance, Hester Rose received a letter from him.\nShe knew the writing on the address well; and it made her tremble so\nmuch that it was many minutes before she dared to open it, and make\nherself acquainted with the facts it might disclose.\n\nBut she need not have feared; there were no facts told, unless the\nvague date of 'London' might be something to learn. Even that much\nmight have been found out by the post-mark, only she had been too\nmuch taken by surprise to examine it.\n\nIt ran as follows:--\n\n\n'DEAR HESTER,--\n\n'Tell those whom it may concern, that I have left Monkshaven for\never. No one need trouble themselves about me; I am provided for.\nPlease to make my humble apologies to my kind friends, the Messrs\nFoster, and to my partner, William Coulson. Please to accept of my\nlove, and to join the same to your mother. Please to give my\nparticular and respectful duty and kind love to my aunt Isabella\nRobson. Her daughter Sylvia knows what I have always felt, and shall\nalways feel, for her better than I can ever put into language, so I\nsend her no message; God bless and keep my child. You must all look\non me as one dead; as I am to you, and maybe shall soon be in\nreality.\n\n'Your affectionate and obedient friend to command,\n\n'PHILIP HEPBURN.\n\n'P.S.--Oh, Hester! for God's sake and mine, look\nafter ('my wife,' scratched out) Sylvia and my child. I think\nJeremiah Foster will help you to be a friend to them. This is the\nlast solemn request of P. H. She is but very young.'\n\n\nHester read this letter again and again, till her heart caught the\necho of its hopelessness, and sank within her. She put it in her\npocket, and reflected upon it all the day long as she served in the\nshop.\n\nThe customers found her as gentle, but far more inattentive than\nusual. She thought that in the evening she would go across the\nbridge, and consult with the two good old brothers Foster. But\nsomething occurred to put off the fulfilment of this plan.\n\nThat same morning Sylvia had preceded her, with no one to consult,\nbecause consultation would have required previous confidence, and\nconfidence would have necessitated such a confession about Kinraid\nas it was most difficult for Sylvia to make. The poor young wife yet\nfelt that some step must be taken by her; and what it was to be she\ncould not imagine.\n\nShe had no home to go to; for as Philip was gone away, she remained\nwhere she was only on sufferance; she did not know what means of\nlivelihood she had; she was willing to work, nay, would be thankful\nto take up her old life of country labour; but with her baby, what\ncould she do?\n\nIn this dilemma, the recollection of the old man's kindly speech and\noffer of assistance, made, it is true, half in joke, at the end of\nher wedding visit, came into her mind; and she resolved to go and\nask for some of the friendly counsel and assistance then offered.\n\nIt would be the first time of her going out since her mother's\nfuneral, and she dreaded the effort on that account. More even than\non that account did she shrink from going into the streets again.\nShe could not get over the impression that Kinraid must be lingering\nnear; and she distrusted herself so much that it was a positive\nterror to think of meeting him again. She felt as though, if she but\ncaught a sight of him, the glitter of his uniform, or heard his\nwell-known voice in only a distant syllable of talk, her heart would\nstop, and she should die from very fright of what would come next.\nOr rather so she felt, and so she thought before she took her baby\nin her arms, as Nancy gave it to her after putting on its\nout-of-door attire.\n\nWith it in her arms she was protected, and the whole current of her\nthoughts was changed. The infant was wailing and suffering with its\nteething, and the mother's heart was so occupied in soothing and\nconsoling her moaning child, that the dangerous quay-side and the\nbridge were passed almost before she was aware; nor did she notice\nthe eager curiosity and respectful attention of those she met who\nrecognized her even through the heavy veil which formed part of the\ndraping mourning provided for her by Hester and Coulson, in the\nfirst unconscious days after her mother's death.\n\nThough public opinion as yet reserved its verdict upon Philip's\ndisappearance--warned possibly by Kinraid's story against hasty\ndecisions and judgments in such times as those of war and general\ndisturbance--yet every one agreed that no more pitiful fate could\nhave befallen Philip's wife.\n\nMarked out by her striking beauty as an object of admiring interest\neven in those days when she sate in girlhood's smiling peace by her\nmother at the Market Cross--her father had lost his life in a\npopular cause, and ignominious as the manner of his death might be,\nhe was looked upon as a martyr to his zeal in avenging the wrongs of\nhis townsmen; Sylvia had married amongst them too, and her quiet\ndaily life was well known to them; and now her husband had been\ncarried off from her side just on the very day when she needed his\ncomfort most.\n\nFor the general opinion was that Philip had been 'carried off'--in\nseaport towns such occurrences were not uncommon in those\ndays--either by land-crimps or water-crimps.\n\nSo Sylvia was treated with silent reverence, as one sorely\nafflicted, by all the unheeded people she met in her faltering walk\nto Jeremiah Foster's.\n\nShe had calculated her time so as to fall in with him at his dinner\nhour, even though it obliged her to go to his own house rather than\nto the bank where he and his brother spent all the business hours of\nthe day.\n\nSylvia was so nearly exhausted by the length of her walk and the\nweight of her baby, that all she could do when the door was opened\nwas to totter into the nearest seat, sit down, and begin to cry.\n\nIn an instant kind hands were about her, loosening her heavy cloak,\noffering to relieve her of her child, who clung to her all the more\nfirmly, and some one was pressing a glass of wine against her lips.\n\n'No, sir, I cannot take it! wine allays gives me th' headache; if I\nmight have just a drink o' water. Thank you, ma'am' (to the\nrespectable-looking old servant), 'I'm well enough now; and perhaps,\nsir, I might speak a word with yo', for it's that I've come for.'\n\n'It's a pity, Sylvia Hepburn, as thee didst not come to me at the\nbank, for it's been a long toil for thee all this way in the heat,\nwith thy child. But if there's aught I can do or say for thee, thou\nhast but to name it, I am sure. Martha! wilt thou relieve her of her\nchild while she comes with me into the parlour?'\n\nBut the wilful little Bella stoutly refused to go to any one, and\nSylvia was not willing to part with her, tired though she was.\n\nSo the baby was carried into the parlour, and much of her after-life\ndepended on this trivial fact.\n\nOnce installed in the easy-chair, and face to face with Jeremiah,\nSylvia did not know how to begin.\n\nJeremiah saw this, and kindly gave her time to recover herself, by\npulling out his great gold watch, and letting the seal dangle before\nthe child's eyes, almost within reach of the child's eager little\nfingers.\n\n'She favours you a deal,' said he, at last. 'More than her father,'\nhe went on, purposely introducing Philip's name, so as to break the\nice; for he rightly conjectured she had come to speak to him about\nsomething connected with her husband.\n\nStill Sylvia said nothing; she was choking down tears and shyness,\nand unwillingness to take as confidant a man of whom she knew so\nlittle, on such slight ground (as she now felt it to be) as the\nlittle kindly speech with which she had been dismissed from that\nhouse the last time that she entered it.\n\n'It's no use keeping yo', sir,' she broke out at last. 'It's about\nPhilip as I comed to speak. Do yo' know any thing whatsomever about\nhim? He niver had a chance o' saying anything, I know; but maybe\nhe's written?'\n\n'Not a line, my poor young woman!' said Jeremiah, hastily putting an\nend to that vain idea.\n\n'Then he's either dead or gone away for iver,' she whispered. 'I mun\nbe both feyther and mother to my child.'\n\n'Oh! thee must not give it up,' replied he. 'Many a one is carried\noff to the wars, or to the tenders o' men-o'-war; and then they turn\nout to be unfit for service, and are sent home. Philip 'll come back\nbefore the year's out; thee'll see that.'\n\n'No; he'll niver come back. And I'm not sure as I should iver wish\nhim t' come back, if I could but know what was gone wi' him. Yo'\nsee, sir, though I were sore set again' him, I shouldn't like harm\nto happen him.'\n\n'There is something behind all this that I do not understand. Can\nthee tell me what it is?'\n\n'I must, sir, if yo're to help me wi' your counsel; and I came up\nhere to ask for it.'\n\nAnother long pause, during which Jeremiah made a feint of playing\nwith the child, who danced and shouted with tantalized impatience at\nnot being able to obtain possession of the seal, and at length\nstretched out her soft round little arms to go to the owner of the\ncoveted possession. Surprise at this action roused Sylvia, and she\nmade some comment upon it.\n\n'I niver knew her t' go to any one afore. I hope she'll not be\ntroublesome to yo', sir?'\n\nThe old man, who had often longed for a child of his own in days\ngone by, was highly pleased by this mark of baby's confidence, and\nalmost forgot, in trying to strengthen her regard by all the winning\nwiles in his power, how her poor mother was still lingering over\nsome painful story which she could not bring herself to tell.\n\n'I'm afeared of speaking wrong again' any one, sir. And mother were\nso fond o' Philip; but he kept something from me as would ha' made\nme a different woman, and some one else, happen, a different man. I\nwere troth-plighted wi' Kinraid the specksioneer, him as was cousin\nto th' Corneys o' Moss Brow, and comed back lieutenant i' t' navy\nlast Tuesday three weeks, after ivery one had thought him dead and\ngone these three years.'\n\nShe paused.\n\n'Well?' said Jeremiah, with interest; although his attention\nappeared to be divided between the mother's story and the eager\nplayfulness of the baby on his knee.\n\n'Philip knew he were alive; he'd seen him taken by t' press-gang,\nand Charley had sent a message to me by Philip.'\n\nHer white face was reddening, her eyes flashing at this point of her\nstory.\n\n'And he niver told me a word on it, not when he saw me like to break\nmy heart in thinking as Kinraid were dead; he kept it a' to hissel';\nand watched me cry, and niver said a word to comfort me wi' t'\ntruth. It would ha' been a great comfort, sir, only t' have had his\nmessage if I'd niver ha' been to see him again. But Philip niver let\non to any one, as I iver heared on, that he'd seen Charley that\nmorning as t' press-gang took him. Yo' know about feyther's death,\nand how friendless mother and me was left? and so I married him; for\nhe were a good friend to us then, and I were dazed like wi' sorrow,\nand could see naught else to do for mother. He were allays very\ntender and good to her, for sure.'\n\nAgain a long pause of silent recollection, broken by one or two deep\nsighs.\n\n'If I go on, sir, now, I mun ask yo' to promise as yo'll niver tell.\nI do so need some one to tell me what I ought to do, and I were led\nhere, like, else I would ha' died wi' it all within my teeth. Yo'll\npromise, sir?'\n\nJeremiah Foster looked in her face, and seeing the wistful, eager\nlook, he was touched almost against his judgment into giving the\npromise required; she went on.\n\n'Upon a Tuesday morning, three weeks ago, I think, tho' for t'\nmatter o' time it might ha' been three years, Kinraid come home;\ncome back for t' claim me as his wife, and I were wed to Philip! I\nmet him i' t' road at first; and I couldn't tell him theere. He\nfollowed me into t' house--Philip's house, sir, behind t' shop--and\nsomehow I told him all, how I were a wedded wife to another. Then he\nup and said I'd a false heart--me false, sir, as had eaten my daily\nbread in bitterness, and had wept t' nights through, all for sorrow\nand mourning for his death! Then he said as Philip knowed all t'\ntime he were alive and coming back for me; and I couldn't believe\nit, and I called Philip, and he come, and a' that Charley had said\nwere true; and yet I were Philip's wife! So I took a mighty oath,\nand I said as I'd niver hold Philip to be my lawful husband again,\nnor iver forgive him for t' evil he'd wrought us, but hold him as a\nstranger and one as had done me a heavy wrong.'\n\nShe stopped speaking; her story seemed to her to end there. But her\nlistener said, after a pause,\n\n'It were a cruel wrong, I grant thee that; but thy oath were a sin,\nand thy words were evil, my poor lass. What happened next?'\n\n'I don't justly remember,' she said, wearily. 'Kinraid went away,\nand mother cried out; and I went to her. She were asleep, I thought,\nso I lay down by her, to wish I were dead, and to think on what\nwould come on my child if I died; and Philip came in softly, and I\nmade as if I were asleep; and that's t' very last as I've iver seen\nor heared of him.'\n\nJeremiah Foster groaned as she ended her story. Then he pulled\nhimself up, and said, in a cheerful tone of voice,\n\n'He'll come back, Sylvia Hepburn. He'll think better of it: never\nfear!'\n\n'I fear his coming back!' said she. 'That's what I'm feared on; I\nwould wish as I knew on his well-doing i' some other place; but him\nand me can niver live together again.'\n\n'Nay,' pleaded Jeremiah. 'Thee art sorry what thee said; thee were\nsore put about, or thee wouldn't have said it.'\n\nHe was trying to be a peace-maker, and to heal over conjugal\ndifferences; but he did not go deep enough.\n\n'I'm not sorry,' said she, slowly. 'I were too deeply wronged to be\n\"put about\"; that would go off wi' a night's sleep. It's only the\nthought of mother (she's dead and happy, and knows nought of all\nthis, I trust) that comes between me and hating Philip. I'm not\nsorry for what I said.'\n\nJeremiah had never met with any one so frank and undisguised in\nexpressions of wrong feeling, and he scarcely knew what to say.\n\nHe looked extremely grieved, and not a little shocked. So pretty and\ndelicate a young creature to use such strong relentless language!\n\nShe seemed to read his thoughts, for she made answer to them.\n\n'I dare say you think I'm very wicked, sir, not to be sorry. Perhaps\nI am. I can't think o' that for remembering how I've suffered; and\nhe knew how miserable I was, and might ha' cleared my misery away\nwi' a word; and he held his peace, and now it's too late! I'm sick\no' men and their cruel, deceitful ways. I wish I were dead.'\n\nShe was crying before she had ended this speech, and seeing her\ntears, the child began to cry too, stretching out its little arms to\ngo back to its mother. The hard stony look on her face melted away\ninto the softest, tenderest love as she clasped the little one to\nher, and tried to soothe its frightened sobs.\n\nA bright thought came into the old man's mind.\n\nHe had been taking a complete dislike to her till her pretty way\nwith her baby showed him that she had a heart of flesh within her.\n\n'Poor little one!' said he, 'thy mother had need love thee, for\nshe's deprived thee of thy father's love. Thou'rt half-way to being\nan orphan; yet I cannot call thee one of the fatherless to whom God\nwill be a father. Thou'rt a desolate babe, thou may'st well cry;\nthine earthly parents have forsaken thee, and I know not if the Lord\nwill take thee up.'\n\nSylvia looked up at him affrighted; holding her baby tighter to her,\nshe exclaimed.\n\n'Don't speak so, sir! it's cursing, sir! I haven't forsaken her! Oh,\nsir! those are awful sayings.'\n\n'Thee hast sworn never to forgive thy husband, nor to live with him\nagain. Dost thee know that by the law of the land, he may claim his\nchild; and then thou wilt have to forsake it, or to be forsworn?\nPoor little maiden!' continued he, once more luring the baby to him\nwith the temptation of the watch and chain.\n\nSylvia thought for a while before speaking. Then she said,\n\n'I cannot tell what ways to take. Whiles I think my head is crazed.\nIt were a cruel turn he did me!'\n\n'It was. I couldn't have thought him guilty of such baseness.'\n\nThis acquiescence, which was perfectly honest on Jeremiah's part,\nalmost took Sylvia by surprise. Why might she not hate one who had\nbeen both cruel and base in his treatment of her? And yet she\nrecoiled from the application of such hard terms by another to\nPhilip, by a cool-judging and indifferent person, as she esteemed\nJeremiah to be. From some inscrutable turn in her thoughts, she\nbegan to defend him, or at least to palliate the harsh judgment\nwhich she herself had been the first to pronounce.\n\n'He were so tender to mother; she were dearly fond on him; he niver\nspared aught he could do for her, else I would niver ha' married\nhim.'\n\n'He was a good and kind-hearted lad from the time he was fifteen.\nAnd I never found him out in any falsehood, no more did my brother.'\n\n'But it were all the same as a lie,' said Sylvia, swiftly changing\nher ground, 'to leave me to think as Charley were dead, when he\nknowed all t' time he were alive.'\n\n'It was. It was a self-seeking lie; putting thee to pain to get his\nown ends. And the end of it has been that he is driven forth like\nCain.'\n\n'I niver told him to go, sir.'\n\n'But thy words sent him forth, Sylvia.'\n\n'I cannot unsay them, sir; and I believe as I should say them\nagain.'\n\nBut she said this as one who rather hopes for a contradiction.\n\nAll Jeremiah replied, however, was, 'Poor wee child!' in a pitiful\ntone, addressed to the baby.\n\nSylvia's eyes filled with tears.\n\n'Oh, sir, I'll do anything as iver yo' can tell me for her. That's\nwhat I came for t' ask yo'. I know I mun not stay theere, and Philip\ngone away; and I dunnot know what to do: and I'll do aught, only I\nmust keep her wi' me. Whativer can I do, sir?'\n\nJeremiah thought it over for a minute or two. Then he replied,\n\n'I must have time to think. I must talk it over with brother John.'\n\n'But you've given me yo'r word, sir!' exclaimed she.\n\n'I have given thee my word never to tell any one of what has passed\nbetween thee and thy husband, but I must take counsel with my\nbrother as to what is to be done with thee and thy child, now that\nthy husband has left the shop.'\n\nThis was said so gravely as almost to be a reproach, and he got up,\nas a sign that the interview was ended.\n\nHe gave the baby back to its mother; but not without a solemn\nblessing, so solemn that, to Sylvia's superstitious and excited\nmind, it undid the terrors of what she had esteemed to be a curse.\n\n'The Lord bless thee and keep thee! The Lord make His face to shine\nupon thee!'\n\nAll the way down the hill-side, Sylvia kept kissing the child, and\nwhispering to its unconscious ears,--\n\n'I'll love thee for both, my treasure, I will. I'll hap thee round\nwi' my love, so as thou shall niver need a feyther's.'\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVII\n\nBEREAVEMENT\n\n\nHester had been prevented by her mother's indisposition from taking\nPhilip's letter to the Fosters, to hold a consultation with them\nover its contents.\n\nAlice Rose was slowly failing, and the long days which she had to\nspend alone told much upon her spirits, and consequently upon her\nhealth.\n\nAll this came out in the conversation which ensued after reading\nHepburn's letter in the little parlour at the bank on the day after\nSylvia had had her confidential interview with Jeremiah Foster.\n\nHe was a true man of honour, and never so much as alluded to her\nvisit to him; but what she had then told him influenced him very\nmuch in the formation of the project which he proposed to his\nbrother and Hester.\n\nHe recommended her remaining where she was, living still in the\nhouse behind the shop; for he thought within himself that she might\nhave exaggerated the effect of her words upon Philip; that, after\nall, it might have been some cause totally disconnected with them,\nwhich had blotted out her husband's place among the men of\nMonkshaven; and that it would be so much easier for both to resume\ntheir natural relations, both towards each other and towards the\nworld, if Sylvia remained where her husband had left her--in an\nexpectant attitude, so to speak.\n\nJeremiah Foster questioned Hester straitly about her letter: whether\nshe had made known its contents to any one. No, not to any one.\nNeither to her mother nor to William Coulson? No, to neither.\n\nShe looked at him as she replied to his inquiries, and he looked at\nher, each wondering if the other could be in the least aware that a\nconjugal quarrel might be at the root of the dilemma in which they\nwere placed by Hepburn's disappearance.\n\nBut neither Hester, who had witnessed the misunderstanding between\nthe husband and wife on the evening, before the morning on which\nPhilip went away, nor Jeremiah Foster, who had learnt from Sylvia\nthe true reason of her husband's disappearance, gave the slightest\nreason to the other to think that they each supposed they had a clue\nto the reason of Hepburn's sudden departure.\n\nWhat Jeremiah Foster, after a night's consideration, had to propose\nwas this; that Hester and her mother should come and occupy the\nhouse in the market-place, conjointly with Sylvia and her child.\nHester's interest in the shop was by this time acknowledged.\nJeremiah had made over to her so much of his share in the business,\nthat she had a right to be considered as a kind of partner; and she\nhad long been the superintendent of that department of goods which\nwere exclusively devoted to women. So her daily presence was\nrequisite for more reasons than one.\n\nYet her mother's health and spirits were such as to render it\nunadvisable that the old woman should be too much left alone; and\nSylvia's devotion to her own mother seemed to point her out as the\nvery person who could be a gentle and tender companion to Alice Rose\nduring those hours when her own daughter would necessarily be\nengaged in the shop.\n\nMany desirable objects seemed to be gained by this removal of Alice:\nan occupation was provided for Sylvia, which would detain her in the\nplace where her husband had left her, and where (Jeremiah Foster\nfairly expected in spite of his letter) he was likely to come back\nto find her; and Alice Rose, the early love of one of the brothers,\nthe old friend of the other, would be well cared for, and under her\ndaughter's immediate supervision during the whole of the time that\nshe was occupied in the shop.\n\nPhilip's share of the business, augmented by the money which he had\nput in from the legacy of his old Cumberland uncle, would bring in\nprofits enough to support Sylvia and her child in ease and comfort\nuntil that time, which they all anticipated, when he should return\nfrom his mysterious wandering--mysterious, whether his going forth\nhad been voluntary or involuntary.\n\nThus far was settled; and Jeremiah Foster went to tell Sylvia of the\nplan.\n\nShe was too much a child, too entirely unaccustomed to any\nindependence of action, to do anything but leave herself in his\nhands. Her very confession, made to him the day before, when she\nsought his counsel, seemed to place her at his disposal. Otherwise,\nshe had had notions of the possibility of a free country life once\nmore--how provided for and arranged she hardly knew; but Haytersbank\nwas to let, and Kester disengaged, and it had just seemed possible\nthat she might have to return to her early home, and to her old\nlife. She knew that it would take much money to stock the farm\nagain, and that her hands were tied from much useful activity by the\nlove and care she owed to her baby. But still, somehow, she hoped\nand she fancied, till Jeremiah Foster's measured words and\ncarefully-arranged plan made her silently relinquish her green,\nbreezy vision.\n\nHester, too, had her own private rebellion--hushed into submission\nby her gentle piety. If Sylvia had been able to make Philip happy,\nHester could have felt lovingly and almost gratefully towards her;\nbut Sylvia had failed in this.\n\nPhilip had been made unhappy, and was driven forth a wanderer into\nthe wide world--never to come back! And his last words to Hester,\nthe postscript of his letter, containing the very pith of it, was to\nask her to take charge and care of the wife whose want of love\ntowards him had uprooted him from the place where he was valued and\nhonoured.\n\nIt cost Hester many a struggle and many a self-reproach before she\ncould make herself feel what she saw all along--that in everything\nPhilip treated her like a sister. But even a sister might well be\nindignant if she saw her brother's love disregarded and slighted,\nand his life embittered by the thoughtless conduct of a wife! Still\nHester fought against herself, and for Philip's sake she sought to\nsee the good in Sylvia, and she strove to love her as well as to\ntake care of her.\n\nWith the baby, of course, the case was different. Without thought or\nstruggle, or reason, every one loved the little girl. Coulson and\nhis buxom wife, who were childless, were never weary of making much\nof her. Hester's happiest hours were spent with that little child.\nJeremiah Foster almost looked upon her as his own from the day when\nshe honoured him by yielding to the temptation of the chain and\nseal, and coming to his knee; not a customer to the shop but knew\nthe smiling child's sad history, and many a country-woman would save\na rosy-cheeked apple from out her store that autumn to bring it on\nnext market-day for 'Philip Hepburn's baby, as had lost its father,\nbless it.'\n\nEven stern Alice Rose was graciously inclined towards the little\nBella; and though her idea of the number of the elect was growing\nnarrower and narrower every day, she would have been loth to exclude\nthe innocent little child, that stroked her wrinkled cheeks so\nsoftly every night in return for her blessing, from the few that\nshould be saved. Nay, for the child's sake, she relented towards the\nmother; and strove to have Sylvia rescued from the many castaways\nwith fervent prayer, or, as she phrased it, 'wrestling with the\nLord'.\n\nAlice had a sort of instinct that the little child, so tenderly\nloved by, so fondly loving, the mother whose ewe-lamb she was, could\nnot be even in heaven without yearning for the creature she had\nloved best on earth; and the old woman believed that this was the\nprincipal reason for her prayers for Sylvia; but unconsciously to\nherself, Alice Rose was touched by the filial attentions she\nconstantly received from the young mother, whom she believed to be\nforedoomed to condemnation.\n\nSylvia rarely went to church or chapel, nor did she read her Bible;\nfor though she spoke little of her ignorance, and would fain, for\nher child's sake, have remedied it now it was too late, she had lost\nwhat little fluency of reading she had ever had, and could only make\nout her words with much spelling and difficulty. So the taking her\nBible in hand would have been a mere form; though of this Alice Rose\nknew nothing.\n\nNo one knew much of what was passing in Sylvia; she did not know\nherself. Sometimes in the nights she would waken, crying, with a\nterrible sense of desolation; every one who loved her, or whom she\nhad loved, had vanished out of her life; every one but her child,\nwho lay in her arms, warm and soft.\n\nBut then Jeremiah Foster's words came upon her; words that she had\ntaken for cursing at the time; and she would so gladly have had some\nclue by which to penetrate the darkness of the unknown region from\nwhence both blessing and cursing came, and to know if she had indeed\ndone something which should cause her sin to be visited on that\nsoft, sweet, innocent darling.\n\nIf any one would teach her to read! If any one would explain to her\nthe hard words she heard in church or chapel, so that she might find\nout the meaning of sin and godliness!--words that had only passed\nover the surface of her mind till now! For her child's sake she\nshould like to do the will of God, if she only knew what that was,\nand how to be worked out in her daily life.\n\nBut there was no one she dared confess her ignorance to and ask\ninformation from. Jeremiah Foster had spoken as if her child, sweet\nlittle merry Bella, with a loving word and a kiss for every one, was\nto suffer heavily for the just and true words her wronged and\nindignant mother had spoken. Alice always spoke as if there were no\nhope for her; and blamed her, nevertheless, for not using the means\nof grace that it was not in her power to avail herself of.\n\nAnd Hester, that Sylvia would fain have loved for her uniform\ngentleness and patience with all around her, seemed so cold in her\nunruffled and undemonstrative behaviour; and moreover, Sylvia felt\nthat Hester blamed her perpetual silence regarding Philip's absence\nwithout knowing how bitter a cause Sylvia had for casting him off.\n\nThe only person who seemed to have pity upon her was Kester; and his\npity was shown in looks rather than words; for when he came to see\nher, which he did from time to time, by a kind of mutual tacit\nconsent, they spoke but little of former days.\n\nHe was still lodging with his sister, widow Dobson, working at odd\njobs, some of which took him into the country for weeks at a time.\nBut on his returns to Monkshaven he was sure to come and see her and\nthe little Bella; indeed, when his employment was in the immediate\nneighbourhood of the town, he never allowed a week to pass away\nwithout a visit.\n\nThere was not much conversation between him and Sylvia at such\ntimes. They skimmed over the surface of the small events in which\nboth took an interest; only now and then a sudden glance, a checked\nspeech, told each that there were deeps not forgotten, although they\nwere never mentioned.\n\nTwice Sylvia--below her breath--had asked Kester, just as she was\nholding the door open for his departure, if anything had ever been\nheard of Kinraid since his one night's visit to Monkshaven: each\ntime (and there was an interval of some months between the\ninquiries) the answer had been simply, no.\n\nTo no one else would Sylvia ever have named his name. But indeed she\nhad not the chance, had she wished it ever so much, of asking any\nquestions about him from any one likely to know. The Corneys had\nleft Moss Brow at Martinmas, and gone many miles away towards\nHorncastle. Bessy Corney, it is true was married and left behind in\nthe neighbourhood; but with her Sylvia had never been intimate; and\nwhat girlish friendship there might have been between them had\ncooled very much at the time of Kinraid's supposed death three years\nbefore.\n\nOne day before Christmas in this year, 1798, Sylvia was called into\nthe shop by Coulson, who, with his assistant, was busy undoing the\nbales of winter goods supplied to them from the West Riding, and\nother places. He was looking at a fine Irish poplin dress-piece when\nSylvia answered to his call.\n\n'Here! do you know this again?' asked he, in the cheerful tone of\none sure of giving pleasure.\n\n'No! have I iver seen it afore?'\n\n'Not this, but one for all t' world like it.'\n\nShe did not rouse up to much interest, but looked at it as if trying\nto recollect where she could have seen its like.\n\n'My missus had one on at th' party at John Foster's last March, and\nyo' admired it a deal. And Philip, he thought o' nothing but how he\ncould get yo' just such another, and he set a vast o' folk agait for\nto meet wi' its marrow; and what he did just the very day afore he\nwent away so mysterious was to write through Dawson Brothers, o'\nWakefield, to Dublin, and order that one should be woven for yo'.\nJemima had to cut a bit off hers for to give him t' exact colour.'\n\nSylvia did not say anything but that it was very pretty, in a low\nvoice, and then she quickly left the shop, much to Coulson's\ndispleasure.\n\nAll the afternoon she was unusually quiet and depressed.\n\nAlice Rose, sitting helpless in her chair, watched her with keen\neyes.\n\nAt length, after one of Sylvia's deep, unconscious sighs, the old\nwoman spoke:\n\n'It's religion as must comfort thee, child, as it's done many a one\nafore thee.'\n\n'How?' said Sylvia, looking up, startled to find herself an object\nof notice.\n\n'How?' (The answer was not quite so ready as the precept had been.)\n'Read thy Bible, and thou wilt learn.'\n\n'But I cannot read,' said Sylvia, too desperate any longer to\nconceal her ignorance.\n\n'Not read! and thee Philip's wife as was such a great scholar! Of a\nsurety the ways o' this life are crooked! There was our Hester, as\ncan read as well as any minister, and Philip passes over her to go\nand choose a young lass as cannot read her Bible.'\n\n'Was Philip and Hester----'\n\nSylvia paused, for though a new curiosity had dawned upon her, she\ndid not know how to word her question.\n\n'Many a time and oft have I seen Hester take comfort in her Bible\nwhen Philip was following after thee. She knew where to go for\nconsolation.'\n\n'I'd fain read,' said Sylvia, humbly, 'if anybody would learn me;\nfor perhaps it might do me good; I'm noane so happy.'\n\nHer eyes, as she looked up at Alice's stern countenance, were full\nof tears.\n\nThe old woman saw it, and was touched, although she did not\nimmediately show her sympathy. But she took her own time, and made\nno reply.\n\nThe next day, however, she bade Sylvia come to her, and then and\nthere, as if her pupil had been a little child, she began to teach\nSylvia to read the first chapter of Genesis; for all other reading\nbut the Scriptures was as vanity to her, and she would not\ncondescend to the weakness of other books. Sylvia was now, as ever,\nslow at book-learning; but she was meek and desirous to be taught,\nand her willingness in this respect pleased Alice, and drew her\nsingularly towards one who, from being a pupil, might become a\nconvert.\n\nAll this time Sylvia never lost the curiosity that had been excited\nby the few words Alice had let drop about Hester and Philip, and by\ndegrees she approached the subject again, and had the idea then\nstarted confirmed by Alice, who had no scruple in using the past\nexperience of her own, of her daughter's, or of any one's life, as\nan instrument to prove the vanity of setting the heart on anything\nearthly.\n\nThis knowledge, unsuspected before, sank deep into Sylvia's\nthoughts, and gave her a strange interest in Hester--poor Hester,\nwhose life she had so crossed and blighted, even by the very\nblighting of her own. She gave Hester her own former passionate\nfeelings for Kinraid, and wondered how she herself should have felt\ntowards any one who had come between her and him, and wiled his love\naway. When she remembered Hester's unfailing sweetness and kindness\ntowards herself from the very first, she could better bear the\ncomparative coldness of her present behaviour.\n\nShe tried, indeed, hard to win back the favour she had lost; but the\nvery means she took were blunders, and only made it seem to her as\nif she could never again do right in Hester's eyes.\n\nFor instance, she begged her to accept and wear the pretty poplin\ngown which had been Philip's especial choice; feeling within herself\nas if she should never wish to put it on, and as if the best thing\nshe could do with it was to offer it to Hester. But Hester rejected\nthe proffered gift with as much hardness of manner as she was\ncapable of assuming; and Sylvia had to carry it upstairs and lay it\nby for the little daughter, who, Hester said, might perhaps learn to\nvalue things that her father had given especial thought to.\n\nYet Sylvia went on trying to win Hester to like her once more; it\nwas one of her great labours, and learning to read from Hester's\nmother was another.\n\nAlice, indeed, in her solemn way, was becoming quite fond of Sylvia;\nif she could not read or write, she had a deftness and gentleness of\nmotion, a capacity for the household matters which fell into her\ndepartment, that had a great effect on the old woman, and for her\ndear mother's sake Sylvia had a stock of patient love ready in her\nheart for all the aged and infirm that fell in her way. She never\nthought of seeking them out, as she knew that Hester did; but then\nshe looked up to Hester as some one very remarkable for her\ngoodness. If only she could have liked her!\n\nHester tried to do all she could for Sylvia; Philip had told her to\ntake care of his wife and child; but she had the conviction that\nSylvia had so materially failed in her duties as to have made her\nhusband an exile from his home--a penniless wanderer, wifeless and\nchildless, in some strange country, whose very aspect was\nfriendless, while the cause of all lived on in the comfortable home\nwhere he had placed her, wanting for nothing--an object of interest\nand regard to many friends--with a lovely little child to give her\njoy for the present, and hope for the future; while he, the poor\noutcast, might even lie dead by the wayside. How could Hester love\nSylvia?\n\nYet they were frequent companions that ensuing spring. Hester was\nnot well; and the doctors said that the constant occupation in the\nshop was too much for her, and that she must, for a time at least,\ntake daily walks into the country.\n\nSylvia used to beg to accompany her; she and the little girl often\nwent with Hester up the valley of the river to some of the nestling\nfarms that were hidden in the more sheltered nooks--for Hester was\nbidden to drink milk warm from the cow; and to go into the familiar\nhaunts about a farm was one of the few things in which Sylvia seemed\nto take much pleasure. She would let little Bella toddle about while\nHester sate and rested: and she herself would beg to milk the cow\ndestined to give the invalid her draught.\n\nOne May evening the three had been out on some such expedition; the\ncountry side still looked gray and bare, though the leaves were\nshowing on the willow and blackthorn and sloe, and by the tinkling\nrunnels, making hidden music along the copse side, the pale delicate\nprimrose buds were showing amid their fresh, green, crinkled leaves.\nThe larks had been singing all the afternoon, but were now dropping\ndown into their nests in the pasture fields; the air had just the\nsharpness in it which goes along with a cloudless evening sky at\nthat time of the year.\n\nBut Hester walked homewards slowly and languidly, speaking no word.\nSylvia noticed this at first without venturing to speak, for Hester\nwas one who disliked having her ailments noticed. But after a while\nHester stood still in a sort of weary dreamy abstraction; and Sylvia\nsaid to her,\n\n'I'm afeared yo're sadly tired. Maybe we've been too far.'\n\nHester almost started.\n\n'No!' said she, 'it's only my headache which is worse to-night. It\nhas been bad all day; but since I came out it has felt just as if\nthere were great guns booming, till I could almost pray 'em to be\nquiet. I am so weary o' th' sound.'\n\nShe stepped out quickly towards home after she had said this, as if\nshe wished for neither pity nor comment on what she had said.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVIII\n\nTHE RECOGNITION\n\n\nFar away, over sea and land, over sunny sea again, great guns were\nbooming on that 7th of May, 1799.\n\nThe Mediterranean came up with a long roar on a beach glittering\nwhite with snowy sand, and the fragments of innumerable sea-shells,\ndelicate and shining as porcelain. Looking at that shore from the\nsea, a long ridge of upland ground, beginning from an inland depth,\nstretched far away into the ocean on the right, till it ended in a\ngreat mountainous bluff, crowned with the white buildings of a\nconvent sloping rapidly down into the blue water at its base.\n\nIn the clear eastern air, the different characters of the foliage\nthat clothed the sides of that sea-washed mountain might be\ndiscerned from a long distance by the naked eye; the silver gray of\nthe olive-trees near its summit; the heavy green and bossy forms of\nthe sycamores lower down; broken here and there by a solitary\nterebinth or ilex tree, of a deeper green and a wider spread; till\nthe eye fell below on the maritime plain, edged with the white\nseaboard and the sandy hillocks; with here and there feathery\npalm-trees, either isolated or in groups--motionless and distinct\nagainst the hot purple air.\n\nLook again; a little to the left on the sea-shore there are the\nwhite walls of a fortified town, glittering in sunlight, or black in\nshadow.\n\nThe fortifications themselves run out into the sea, forming a port\nand a haven against the wild Levantine storms; and a lighthouse\nrises out of the waves to guide mariners into safety.\n\nBeyond this walled city, and far away to the left still, there is\nthe same wide plain shut in by the distant rising ground, till the\nupland circuit comes closing in to the north, and the great white\nrocks meet the deep tideless ocean with its intensity of blue\ncolour.\n\nAbove, the sky is literally purple with heat; and the pitiless light\nsmites the gazer's weary eye as it comes back from the white shore.\nNor does the plain country in that land offer the refuge and rest of\nour own soft green. The limestone rock underlies the vegetation, and\ngives a glittering, ashen hue to all the bare patches, and even to\nthe cultivated parts which are burnt up early in the year. In\nspring-time alone does the country look rich and fruitful; then the\ncorn-fields of the plain show their capability of bearing, 'some\nfifty, some an hundred fold'; down by the brook Kishon, flowing not\nfar from the base of the mountainous promontory to the south, there\ngrow the broad green fig-trees, cool and fresh to look upon; the\norchards are full of glossy-leaved cherry-trees; the tall amaryllis\nputs forth crimson and yellow glories in the fields, rivalling the\npomp of King Solomon; the daisies and the hyacinths spread their\nmyriad flowers; the anemones, scarlet as blood, run hither and\nthither over the ground like dazzling flames of fire.\n\nA spicy odour lingers in the heated air; it comes from the multitude\nof aromatic flowers that blossom in the early spring. Later on they\nwill have withered and faded, and the corn will have been gathered,\nand the deep green of the eastern foliage will have assumed a kind\nof gray-bleached tint.\n\nEven now in May, the hot sparkle of the everlasting sea, the\nterribly clear outline of all objects, whether near or distant, the\nfierce sun right overhead, the dazzling air around, were\ninexpressibly wearying to the English eyes that kept their skilled\nwatch, day and night, on the strongly-fortified coast-town that lay\nout a little to the northward of where the British ships were\nanchored.\n\nThey had kept up a flanking fire for many days in aid of those\nbesieged in St Jean d'Acre; and at intervals had listened,\nimpatient, to the sound of the heavy siege guns, or the sharper\nrattle of the French musketry.\n\nIn the morning, on the 7th of May, a man at the masthead of the\n_Tigre_ sang out that he saw ships in the offing; and in reply to\nthe signal that was hastily run up, he saw the distant vessels hoist\nfriendly flags. That May morning was a busy time. The besieged Turks\ntook heart of grace; the French outside, under the command of their\ngreat general, made hasty preparations for a more vigorous assault\nthan all many, both vigorous and bloody, that had gone before (for\nthe siege was now at its fifty-first day), in hopes of carrying the\ntown by storm before the reinforcement coming by sea could arrive;\nand Sir Sidney Smith, aware of Buonaparte's desperate intention,\nordered all the men, both sailors and marines, that could be spared\nfrom the necessity of keeping up a continual flanking fire from the\nships upon the French, to land, and assist the Turks and the British\nforces already there in the defence of the old historic city.\n\nLieutenant Kinraid, who had shared his captain's daring adventure\noff the coast of France three years before, who had been a prisoner\nwith him and Westley Wright, in the Temple at Paris, and had escaped\nwith them, and, through Sir Sidney's earnest recommendation, been\npromoted from being a warrant officer to the rank of lieutenant,\nreceived on this day the honour from his admiral of being appointed\nto an especial post of danger. His heart was like a war-horse, and\nsaid, Ha, ha! as the boat bounded over the waves that were to land\nhim under the ancient machicolated walls where the Crusaders made\ntheir last stand in the Holy Land. Not that Kinraid knew or cared\none jot about those gallant knights of old: all he knew was, that\nthe French, under Boney, were trying to take the town from the\nTurks, and that his admiral said they must not, and so they should\nnot.\n\nHe and his men landed on that sandy shore, and entered the town by\nthe water-port gate; he was singing to himself his own country\nsong,--\n\n  Weel may the keel row, the keel row, &C.\n\nand his men, with sailors' aptitude for music, caught up the air,\nand joined in the burden with inarticulate sounds.\n\nSo, with merry hearts, they threaded the narrow streets of Acre,\nhemmed in on either side by the white walls of Turkish houses, with\nsmall grated openings high up, above all chance of peeping\nintrusion.\n\nHere and there they met an ample-robed and turbaned Turk going along\nwith as much haste as his stately self-possession would allow. But\nthe majority of the male inhabitants were gathered together to\ndefend the breach, where the French guns thundered out far above the\nheads of the sailors.\n\nThey went along none the less merrily for the sound to Djezzar\nPacha's garden, where the old Turk sate on his carpet, beneath the\nshade of a great terebinth tree, listening to the interpreter, who\nmade known to him the meaning of the eager speeches of Sir Sidney\nSmith and the colonel of the marines.\n\nAs soon as the admiral saw the gallant sailors of H.M.S. _Tigre_, he\ninterrupted the council of war without much ceremony, and going to\nKinraid, he despatched them, as before arranged, to the North\nRavelin, showing them the way with rapid, clear directions.\n\nOut of respect to him, they had kept silent while in the strange,\ndesolate garden; but once more in the streets, the old Newcastle\nsong rose up again till the men were, perforce, silenced by the\nhaste with which they went to the post of danger.\n\nIt was three o'clock in the afternoon. For many a day these very men\nhad been swearing at the terrific heat at this hour--even when at\nsea, fanned by the soft breeze; but now, in the midst of hot smoke,\nwith former carnage tainting the air, and with the rush and whizz of\ndeath perpetually whistling in their ears, they were uncomplaining\nand light-hearted. Many an old joke, and some new ones, came brave\nand hearty, on their cheerful voices, even though the speaker was\nveiled from sight in great clouds of smoke, cloven only by the\nbright flames of death.\n\nA sudden message came; as many of the crew of the _Tigre_ as were\nunder Lieutenant Kinraid's command were to go down to the Mole, to\nassist the new reinforcements (seen by the sailor from the masthead\nat day-dawn), under command of Hassan Bey, to land at the Mole,\nwhere Sir Sidney then was.\n\nOff they went, almost as bright and thoughtless as before, though\ntwo of their number lay silent for ever at the North\nRavelin--silenced in that one little half-hour. And one went along\nwith the rest, swearing lustily at his ill-luck in having his right\narm broken, but ready to do good business with his left.\n\nThey helped the Turkish troops to land more with good-will than\ntenderness; and then, led by Sir Sidney, they went under the shelter\nof English guns to the fatal breach, so often assailed, so gallantly\ndefended, but never so fiercely contested as on this burning\nafternoon. The ruins of the massive wall that here had been broken\ndown by the French, were used by them as stepping stones to get on a\nlevel with the besieged, and so to escape the heavy stones which the\nlatter hurled down; nay, even the dead bodies of the morning's\ncomrades were made into ghastly stairs.\n\nWhen Djezzar Pacha heard that the British sailors were defending the\nbreach, headed by Sir Sidney Smith, he left his station in the\npalace garden, gathered up his robes in haste, and hurried to the\nbreach; where, with his own hands, and with right hearty good-will,\nhe pulled the sailors down from the post of danger, saying that if\nhe lost his English friends he lost all!\n\nBut little recked the crew of the _Tigre_ of the one old man--Pacha\nor otherwise--who tried to hold them back from the fight; they were\nup and at the French assailants clambering over the breach in an\ninstant; and so they went on, as if it were some game at play\ninstead of a deadly combat, until Kinraid and his men were called\noff by Sir Sidney, as the reinforcement of Turkish troops under\nHassan Bey were now sufficient for the defence of that old breach in\nthe walls, which was no longer the principal object of the French\nattack; for the besiegers had made a new and more formidable breach\nby their incessant fire, knocking down whole streets of the city\nwalls.\n\n'Fight your best Kinraid!' said Sir Sidney; 'for there's Boney on\nyonder hill looking at you.'\n\nAnd sure enough, on a rising ground, called Richard Coeur de Lion's\nMount, there was a half-circle of French generals, on horseback, all\ndeferentially attending to the motions, and apparently to the words,\nof a little man in their centre; at whose bidding the aide-de-camp\ngalloped swift with messages to the more distant French camp.\n\nThe two ravelins which Kinraid and his men had to occupy, for the\npurpose of sending a flanking fire upon the enemy, were not ten\nyards from that enemy's van.\n\nBut at length there was a sudden rush of the French to that part of\nthe wall where they imagined they could enter unopposed.\n\nSurprised at this movement, Kinraid ventured out of the shelter of\nthe ravelin to ascertain the cause; he, safe and untouched during\nthat long afternoon of carnage, fell now, under a stray musket-shot,\nand lay helpless and exposed upon the ground undiscerned by his men,\nwho were recalled to help in the hot reception which had been\nplanned for the French; who, descending the city walls into the\nPacha's garden, were attacked with sabre and dagger, and lay\nheadless corpses under the flowering rose-bushes, and by the\nfountain side.\n\nKinraid lay beyond the ravelins, many yards outside the city walls.\n\nHe was utterly helpless, for the shot had broken his leg. Dead\nbodies of Frenchmen lay strewn around him; no Englishman had\nventured out so far.\n\nAll the wounded men that he could see were French; and many of\nthese, furious with pain, gnashed their teeth at him, and cursed him\naloud, till he thought that his best course was to assume the\nsemblance of death; for some among these men were still capable of\ndragging themselves up to him, and by concentrating all their\nfailing energies into one blow, put him to a speedy end.\n\nThe outlying pickets of the French army were within easy rifle shot;\nand his uniform, although less conspicuous in colour than that of\nthe marines, by whose sides he had been fighting, would make him a\nsure mark if he so much as moved his arm. Yet how he longed to turn,\nif ever so slightly, so that the cruel slanting sun might not beat\nfull into his aching eyes. Fever, too, was coming upon him; the pain\nin his leg was every moment growing more severe; the terrible thirst\nof the wounded, added to the heat and fatigue of the day, made his\nlips and tongue feel baked and dry, and his whole throat seemed\nparched and wooden. Thoughts of other days, of cool Greenland seas,\nwhere ice abounded, of grassy English homes, began to make the past\nmore real than the present.\n\nWith a great effort he brought his wandering senses back; he knew\nwhere he was now, and could weigh the chances of his life, which\nwere but small; the unwonted tears came to his eyes as he thought of\nthe newly-made wife in her English home, who might never know how he\ndied thinking of her.\n\nSuddenly he saw a party of English marines advance, under shelter of\nthe ravelin, to pick up the wounded, and bear them within the walls\nfor surgical help. They were so near he could see their faces, could\nhear them speak; yet he durst not make any sign to them when he lay\nwithin range of the French picket's fire.\n\nFor one moment he could not resist raising his head, to give himself\na chance for life; before the unclean creatures that infest a camp\ncame round in the darkness of the night to strip and insult the dead\nbodies, and to put to death such as had yet the breath of life\nwithin them. But the setting sun came full into his face, and he saw\nnothing of what he longed to see.\n\nHe fell back in despair; he lay there to die.\n\nThat strong clear sunbeam had wrought his salvation.\n\nHe had been recognized as men are recognized when they stand in the\nred glare of a house on fire; the same despair of help, of hopeless\nfarewell to life, stamped on their faces in blood-red light.\n\nOne man left his fellows, and came running forwards, forwards in\namong the enemy's wounded, within range of their guns; he bent down\nover Kinraid; he seemed to understand without a word; he lifted him\nup, carrying him like a child; and with the vehement energy that is\nmore from the force of will than the strength of body, he bore him\nback to within the shelter of the ravelin--not without many shots\nbeing aimed at them, one of which hit Kinraid in the fleshy part of\nhis arm.\n\nKinraid was racked with agony from his dangling broken leg, and his\nvery life seemed leaving him; yet he remembered afterwards how the\nmarine recalled his fellows, and how, in the pause before they\nreturned, his face became like one formerly known to the sick senses\nof Kinraid; yet it was too like a dream, too utterly improbable to\nbe real.\n\nYet the few words this man said, as he stood breathless and alone by\nthe fainting Kinraid, fitted in well with the belief conjured up by\nhis personal appearance. He panted out,--\n\n'I niver thought you'd ha' kept true to her!'\n\nAnd then the others came up; and while they were making a sling of\ntheir belts, Kinraid fainted utterly away, and the next time that he\nwas fully conscious, he was lying in his berth in the _Tigre_, with\nthe ship surgeon setting his leg. After that he was too feverish for\nseveral days to collect his senses. When he could first remember,\nand form a judgment upon his recollections, he called the man\nespecially charged to attend upon him, and bade him go and make\ninquiry in every possible manner for a marine named Philip Hepburn,\nand, when he was found, to entreat him to come and see Kinraid.\n\nThe sailor was away the greater part of the day, and returned\nunsuccessful in his search; he had been from ship to ship, hither\nand thither; he had questioned all the marines he had met with, no\none knew anything of any Philip Hepburn.\n\nKinraid passed a miserably feverish night, and when the doctor\nexclaimed the next morning at his retrogression, he told him, with\nsome irritation, of the ill-success of his servant; he accused the\nman of stupidity, and wished fervently that he were able to go\nhimself.\n\nPartly to soothe him, the doctor promised that he would undertake\nthe search for Hepburn, and he engaged faithfully to follow all\nKinraid's eager directions; not to be satisfied with men's careless\nwords, but to look over muster-rolls and ships' books.\n\nHe, too, brought the same answer, however unwillingly given.\n\nHe had set out upon the search so confident of success, that he felt\ndoubly discomfited by failure. However, he had persuaded himself\nthat the lieutenant had been partially delirious from the effects of\nhis wound, and the power of the sun shining down just where he lay.\nThere had, indeed, been slight symptoms of Kinraid's having received\na sun-stroke; and the doctor dwelt largely on these in his endeavour\nto persuade his patient that it was his imagination which had endued\na stranger with the lineaments of some former friend.\n\nKinraid threw his arms out of bed with impatience at all this\nplausible talk, which was even more irritating than the fact that\nHepburn was still undiscovered.\n\n'The man was no friend of mine; I was like to have killed him when\nlast I saw him. He was a shopkeeper in a country town in England. I\nhad seen little enough of him; but enough to make me able to swear\nto him anywhere, even in a marine's uniform, and in this sweltering\ncountry.'\n\n'Faces once seen, especially in excitement, are apt to return upon\nthe memory in cases of fever,' quoth the doctor, sententiously.\n\nThe attendant sailor, reinstalled to some complacency by the failure\nof another in the search in which he himself had been unsuccessful,\nnow put in his explanation.\n\n'Maybe it was a spirit. It's not th' first time as I've heared of a\nspirit coming upon earth to save a man's life i' time o' need. My\nfather had an uncle, a west-country grazier. He was a-coming over\nDartmoor in Devonshire one moonlight night with a power o' money as\nhe'd got for his sheep at t' fair. It were stowed i' leather bags\nunder th' seat o' th' gig. It were a rough kind o' road, both as a\nroad and in character, for there'd been many robberies there of\nlate, and th' great rocks stood convenient for hiding-places. All at\nonce father's uncle feels as if some one were sitting beside him on\nth' empty seat; and he turns his head and looks, and there he sees\nhis brother sitting--his brother as had been dead twelve year and\nmore. So he turns his head back again, eyes right, and never say a\nword, but wonders what it all means. All of a sudden two fellows\ncome out upo' th' white road from some black shadow, and they\nlooked, and they let th' gig go past, father's uncle driving hard,\nI'll warrant him. But for all that he heard one say to t' other,\n\"By----, there's _two_ on 'em!\" Straight on he drove faster than\never, till he saw th' far lights of some town or other. I forget its\nname, though I've heared it many a time; and then he drew a long\nbreath, and turned his head to look at his brother, and ask him how\nhe'd managed to come out of his grave i' Barum churchyard, and th'\nseat was as empty as it had been when he set out; and then he knew\nthat it were a spirit come to help him against th' men who thought\nto rob him, and would likely enough ha' murdered him.'\n\nKinraid had kept quiet through this story. But when the sailor began\nto draw the moral, and to say, 'And I think I may make bold to say,\nsir, as th' marine who carried you out o' th' Frenchy's gun-shot was\njust a spirit come to help you,' he exclaimed impatiently, swearing\na great oath as he did so, 'It was no spirit, I tell you; and I was\nin my full senses. It was a man named Philip Hepburn. He said words\nto me, or over me, as none but himself would have said. Yet we hated\neach other like poison; and I can't make out why he should be there\nand putting himself in danger to save me. But so it was; and as you\ncan't find him, let me hear no more of your nonsense. It was him,\nand not my fancy, doctor. It was flesh and blood, and not a spirit,\nJack. So get along with you, and leave me quiet.'\n\nAll this time Stephen Freeman lay friendless, sick, and shattered,\non board the _Theseus_.\n\nHe had been about his duty close to some shells that were placed on\nher deck; a gay young midshipman was thoughtlessly striving to get\nthe fusee out of one of these by a mallet and spike-nail that lay\nclose at hand; and a fearful explosion ensued, in which the poor\nmarine, cleaning his bayonet near, was shockingly burnt and\ndisfigured, the very skin of all the lower part of his face being\nutterly destroyed by gunpowder. They said it was a mercy that his\neyes were spared; but he could hardly feel anything to be a mercy,\nas he lay tossing in agony, burnt by the explosion, wounded by\nsplinters, and feeling that he was disabled for life, if life itself\nwere preserved. Of all that suffered by that fearful accident (and\nthey were many) none was so forsaken, so hopeless, so desolate, as\nthe Philip Hepburn about whom such anxious inquiries were being made\nat that very time.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIX\n\nCONFIDENCES\n\n\nIt was a little later on in that same summer that Mrs. Brunton came\nto visit her sister Bessy.\n\nBessy was married to a tolerably well-to-do farmer who lived at an\nalmost equal distance between Monkshaven and Hartswell; but from old\nhabit and convenience the latter was regarded as the Dawsons'\nmarket-town; so Bessy seldom or never saw her old friends in\nMonkshaven.\n\nBut Mrs. Brunton was far too flourishing a person not to speak out\nher wishes, and have her own way. She had no notion, she said, of\ncoming such a long journey only to see Bessy and her husband, and\nnot to have a sight of her former acquaintances at Monkshaven. She\nmight have added, that her new bonnet and cloak would be as good as\nlost if it was not displayed among those who, knowing her as Molly\nCorney, and being less fortunate in matrimony than she was, would\nlook upon it with wondering admiration, if not with envy.\n\nSo one day farmer Dawson's market-cart deposited Mrs. Brunton in all\nher bravery at the shop in the market-place, over which Hepburn and\nCoulson's names still flourished in joint partnership.\n\nAfter a few words of brisk recognition to Coulson and Hester, Mrs\nBrunton passed on into the parlour and greeted Sylvia with\nboisterous heartiness.\n\nIt was now four years and more since the friends had met; and each\nsecretly wondered how they had ever come to be friends. Sylvia had a\ncountry, raw, spiritless look to Mrs. Brunton's eye; Molly was loud\nand talkative, and altogether distasteful to Sylvia, trained in\ndaily companionship with Hester to appreciate soft slow speech, and\ngrave thoughtful ways.\n\nHowever, they kept up the forms of their old friendship, though\ntheir hearts had drifted far apart. They sat hand in hand while each\nlooked at the other with eyes inquisitive as to the changes which\ntime had made. Molly was the first to speak.\n\n'Well, to be sure! how thin and pale yo've grown, Sylvia! Matrimony\nhasn't agreed wi' yo' as well as it's done wi me. Brunton is allays\nsaying (yo' know what a man he is for his joke) that if he'd ha'\nknown how many yards o' silk I should ha' ta'en for a gown, he'd ha'\nthought twice afore he'd ha' married me. Why, I've gained a matter\no' thirty pound o' flesh sin' I were married!'\n\n'Yo' do look brave and hearty!' said Sylvia, putting her sense of\nher companion's capacious size and high colour into the prettiest\nwords she could.\n\n'Eh! Sylvia! but I know what it is,' said Molly, shaking her head.\n'It's just because o' that husband o' thine as has gone and left\nthee; thou's pining after him, and he's not worth it. Brunton said,\nwhen he heared on it--I mind he was smoking at t' time, and he took\nhis pipe out of his mouth, and shook out t' ashes as grave as any\njudge--\"The man,\" says he, \"as can desert a wife like Sylvia Robson\nas was, deserves hanging!\" That's what he says! Eh! Sylvia, but\nspeakin' o' hanging I was so grieved for yo' when I heared of yo'r\npoor feyther! Such an end for a decent man to come to! Many a one\ncome an' called on me o' purpose to hear all I could tell 'em about\nhim!'\n\n'Please don't speak on it!' said Sylvia, trembling all over.\n\n'Well, poor creature, I wunnot. It is hard on thee, I grant. But to\ngive t' devil his due, it were good i' Hepburn to marry thee, and so\nsoon after there was a' that talk about thy feyther. Many a man\nwould ha' drawn back, choose howiver far they'd gone. I'm noane so\nsure about Charley Kinraid. Eh, Sylvia! only think on his being\nalive after all. I doubt if our Bessy would ha' wed Frank Dawson if\nshe'd known as he wasn't drowned. But it's as well she did, for\nDawson's a man o' property, and has getten twelve cows in his\ncow-house, beside three right down good horses; and Kinraid were\nallays a fellow wi' two strings to his bow. I've allays said and do\nmaintain, that he went on pretty strong wi' yo', Sylvie; and I will\nsay I think he cared more for yo' than for our Bessy, though it were\nonly yesterday at e'en she were standing out that he liked her\nbetter than yo'. Yo'll ha' heared on his grand marriage?'\n\n'No!' said Sylvia, with eager painful curiosity.\n\n'No! It was in all t' papers! I wonder as yo' didn't see it. Wait a\nminute! I cut it out o' t' _Gentleman's Magazine_, as Brunton bought\no' purpose, and put it i' my pocket-book when I were a-coming here:\nI know I've got it somewheere.'\n\nShe took out her smart crimson pocket-book, and rummaged in the\npocket until she produced a little crumpled bit of printed paper,\nfrom which she read aloud,\n\n'On January the third, at St Mary Redcliffe, Bristol, Charles\nKinraid, Esq., lieutenant Royal Navy, to Miss Clarinda Jackson, with\na fortune of 10,000_l_.'\n\n'Theere!' said she, triumphantly, 'it's something as Brunton says,\nto be cousin to that.'\n\n'Would yo' let me see it?' said Sylvia, timidly.\n\nMrs. Brunton graciously consented; and Sylvia brought her newly\nacquired reading-knowledge, hitherto principally exercised on the\nOld Testament, to bear on these words.\n\nThere was nothing wonderful in them, nothing that she might not have\nexpected; and yet the surprise turned her giddy for a moment or two.\nShe never thought of seeing him again, never. But to think of his\ncaring for another woman as much as he had done for her, nay,\nperhaps more!\n\nThe idea was irresistibly forced upon her that Philip would not have\nacted so; it would have taken long years before he could have been\ninduced to put another on the throne she had once occupied. For the\nfirst time in her life she seemed to recognize the real nature of\nPhilip's love.\n\nBut she said nothing but 'Thank yo',' when she gave the scrap of\npaper back to Molly Brunton. And the latter continued giving her\ninformation about Kinraid's marriage.\n\n'He were down in t' west, Plymouth or somewheere, when he met wi'\nher. She's no feyther; he'd been in t' sugar-baking business; but\nfrom what Kinraid wrote to old Turner, th' uncle as brought him up\nat Cullercoats, she's had t' best of edications: can play on t'\ninstrument and dance t' shawl dance; and Kinraid had all her money\nsettled on her, though she said she'd rayther give it all to him,\nwhich I must say, being his cousin, was very pretty on her. He's\nleft her now, having to go off in t' _Tigre_, as is his ship, to t'\nMediterranean seas; and she's written to offer to come and see old\nTurner, and make friends with his relations, and Brunton is going to\ngi'e me a crimson satin as soon as we know for certain when she's\ncoming, for we're sure to be asked out to Cullercoats.'\n\n'I wonder if she's very pretty?' asked Sylvia, faintly, in the first\npause in this torrent of talk.\n\n'Oh! she's a perfect beauty, as I understand. There was a traveller\nas come to our shop as had been at York, and knew some of her\ncousins theere that were in t' grocery line--her mother was a York\nlady--and they said she was just a picture of a woman, and iver so\nmany gentlemen had been wantin' to marry her, but she just waited\nfor Charley Kinraid, yo' see!'\n\n'Well, I hope they'll be happy; I'm sure I do!' said Sylvia.\n\n'That's just luck. Some folks is happy i' marriage, and some isn't.\nIt's just luck, and there's no forecasting it. Men is such\nunaccountable animals, there's no prophesyin' upon 'em. Who'd ha'\nthought of yo'r husband, him as was so slow and sure--steady Philip,\nas we lasses used to ca' him--makin' a moonlight flittin', and\nleavin' yo' to be a widow bewitched?'\n\n'He didn't go at night,' said Sylvia, taking the words 'moonlight\nflitting' in their literal sense.\n\n'No! Well, I only said \"moonlight flittin'\" just because it come\nuppermost and I knowed no better. Tell me all about it, Sylvie, for\nI can't mak' it out from what Bessy says. Had he and yo' had\nwords?--but in course yo' had.'\n\nAt this moment Hester came into the room; and Sylvia joyfully\navailed herself of the pretext for breaking off the conversation\nthat had reached this painful and awkward point. She detained Hester\nin the room for fear lest Mrs. Brunton should repeat her inquiry as\nto how it all happened that Philip had gone away; but the presence\nof a third person seemed as though it would be but little restraint\nupon the inquisitive Molly, who repeatedly bore down upon the same\nquestions till she nearly drove Sylvia distracted, between her\nastonishment at the news of Kinraid's marriage; her wish to be alone\nand quiet, so as to realize the full meaning of that piece of\nintelligence; her desire to retain Hester in the conversation; her\nefforts to prevent Molly's recurrence to the circumstances of\nPhilip's disappearance, and the longing--more vehement every\nminute--for her visitor to go away and leave her in peace. She\nbecame so disturbed with all these thoughts and feelings that she\nhardly knew what she was saying, and assented or dissented to\nspeeches without there being either any reason or truth in her\nwords.\n\nMrs. Brunton had arranged to remain with Sylvia while the horse\nrested, and had no compunction about the length of her visit. She\nexpected to be asked to tea, as Sylvia found out at last, and this\nshe felt would be the worst of all, as Alice Rose was not one to\ntolerate the coarse, careless talk of such a woman as Mrs. Brunton\nwithout uplifting her voice in many a testimony against it. Sylvia\nsate holding Hester's gown tight in order to prevent her leaving the\nroom, and trying to arrange her little plans so that too much\ndiscordance should not arise to the surface. Just then the door\nopened, and little Bella came in from the kitchen in all the pretty,\nsturdy dignity of two years old, Alice following her with careful\nsteps, and protecting, outstretched arms, a slow smile softening the\nsternness of her grave face; for the child was the unconscious\ndarling of the household, and all eyes softened into love as they\nlooked on her. She made straight for her mother with something\ngrasped in her little dimpled fist; but half-way across the room she\nseemed to have become suddenly aware of the presence of a stranger,\nand she stopped short, fixing her serious eyes full on Mrs. Brunton,\nas if to take in her appearance, nay, as if to penetrate down into\nher very real self, and then, stretching out her disengaged hand,\nthe baby spoke out the words that had been hovering about her\nmother's lips for an hour past.\n\n'Do away!' said Bella, decisively.\n\n'What a perfect love!' said Mrs. Brunton, half in real admiration,\nhalf in patronage. As she spoke, she got up and went towards the\nchild, as if to take her up.\n\n'Do away! do away!' cried Bella, in shrill affright at this\nmovement.\n\n'Dunnot,' said Sylvia; 'she's shy; she doesn't know strangers.'\n\nBut Mrs. Brunton had grasped the struggling, kicking child by this\ntime, and her reward for this was a vehement little slap in the\nface.\n\n'Yo' naughty little spoilt thing!' said she, setting Bella down in a\nhurry. 'Yo' deserve a good whipping, yo' do, and if yo' were mine\nyo' should have it.'\n\nSylvia had no need to stand up for the baby who had run to her arms,\nand was soothing herself with sobbing on her mother's breast; for\nAlice took up the defence.\n\n'The child said, as plain as words could say, \"go away,\" and if thou\nwouldst follow thine own will instead of heeding her wish, thou mun\nput up with the wilfulness of the old Adam, of which it seems to me\nthee hast getten thy share at thirty as well as little Bella at\ntwo.'\n\n'Thirty!' said Mrs. Brunton, now fairly affronted. 'Thirty! why,\nSylvia, yo' know I'm but two years older than yo'; speak to that\nwoman an' tell her as I'm only four-and-twenty. Thirty, indeed!'\n\n'Molly's but four-and-twenty,' said Sylvia, in a pacificatory tone.\n\n'Whether she be twenty, or thirty, or forty, is alike to me,' said\nAlice. 'I meant no harm. I meant but for t' say as her angry words\nto the child bespoke her to be one of the foolish. I know not who\nshe is, nor what her age may be.'\n\n'She's an old friend of mine,' said Sylvia. 'She's Mrs. Brunton now,\nbut when I knowed her she was Molly Corney.'\n\n'Ay! and yo' were Sylvia Robson, and as bonny and light-hearted a\nlass as any in a' t' Riding, though now yo're a poor widow\nbewitched, left wi' a child as I mustn't speak a word about, an'\nliving wi' folk as talk about t' old Adam as if he wasn't dead and\ndone wi' long ago! It's a change, Sylvia, as makes my heart ache for\nyo', to think on them old days when yo' were so thought on yo' might\nhave had any man, as Brunton often says; it were a great mistake as\nyo' iver took up wi' yon man as has run away. But seven year 'll\nsoon be past fro' t' time he went off, and yo'll only be\nsix-and-twenty then; and there'll be a chance of a better husband\nfor yo' after all, so keep up yo'r heart, Sylvia.'\n\nMolly Brunton had put as much venom as she knew how into this\nspeech, meaning it as a vengeful payment for the supposition of her\nbeing thirty, even more than for the reproof for her angry words\nabout the child. She thought that Alice Rose must be either mother\nor aunt to Philip, from the serious cast of countenance that was\nremarkable in both; and she rather exulted in the allusion to a\nhappier second marriage for Sylvia, with which she had concluded her\nspeech. It roused Alice, however, as effectually as if she had been\nreally a blood relation to Philip; but for a different reason. She\nwas not slow to detect the intentional offensiveness to herself in\nwhat had been said; she was indignant at Sylvia for suffering the\nwords spoken to pass unanswered; but in truth they were too much in\nkeeping with Molly Brunton's character to make as much impression on\nSylvia as they did on a stranger; and besides, she felt as if the\nless reply Molly received, the less likely would it be that she\nwould go on in the same strain. So she coaxed and chattered to her\nchild and behaved like a little coward in trying to draw out of the\nconversation, while at the same time listening attentively.\n\n'As for Sylvia Hepburn as was Sylvia Robson, she knows my mind,'\nsaid Alice, in grim indignation. 'She's humbling herself now, I\ntrust and pray, but she was light-minded and full of vanity when\nPhilip married her, and it might ha' been a lift towards her\nsalvation in one way; but it pleased the Lord to work in a different\nway, and she mun wear her sackcloth and ashes in patience. So I'll\nsay naught more about her. But for him as is absent, as thee hast\nspoken on so lightly and reproachfully, I'd have thee to know he\nwere one of a different kind to any thee ever knew, I reckon. If he\nwere led away by a pretty face to slight one as was fitter for him,\nand who had loved him as the apple of her eye, it's him as is\nsuffering for it, inasmuch as he's a wanderer from his home, and an\noutcast from wife and child.'\n\nTo the surprise of all, Molly's words of reply were cut short even\nwhen they were on her lips, by Sylvia. Pale, fire-eyed, and excited,\nwith Philip's child on one arm, and the other stretched out, she\nsaid,--\n\n'Noane can tell--noane know. No one shall speak a judgment 'twixt\nPhilip and me. He acted cruel and wrong by me. But I've said my\nwords to him hissel', and I'm noane going to make any plaint to\nothers; only them as knows should judge. And it's not fitting, it's\nnot' (almost sobbing), 'to go on wi' talk like this afore me.'\n\nThe two--for Hester, who was aware that her presence had only been\ndesired by Sylvia as a check to an unpleasant _tete-a-tete_\nconversation, had slipped back to her business as soon as her mother\ncame in--the two looked with surprise at Sylvia; her words, her\nwhole manner, belonged to a phase of her character which seldom came\nuppermost, and which had not been perceived by either of them\nbefore.\n\nAlice Rose, though astonished, rather approved of Sylvia's speech;\nit showed that she had more serious thought and feeling on the\nsubject than the old woman had given her credit for; her general\nsilence respecting her husband's disappearance had led Alice to\nthink that she was too childish to have received any deep impression\nfrom the event. Molly Brunton gave vent to her opinion on Sylvia's\nspeech in the following words:--\n\n'Hoighty-toighty! That tells tales, lass. If yo' treated steady\nPhilip to many such looks an' speeches as yo'n given us now, it's\neasy t' see why he took hisself off. Why, Sylvia, I niver saw it in\nyo' when yo' was a girl; yo're grown into a regular little vixen,\ntheere wheere yo' stand!'\n\nIndeed she did look defiant, with the swift colour flushing her\ncheeks to crimson on its return, and the fire in her eyes not yet\ndied away. But at Molly's jesting words she sank back into her usual\nlook and manner, only saying quietly,--\n\n'It's for noane to say whether I'm vixen or not, as doesn't know th'\npast things as is buried in my heart. But I cannot hold them as my\nfriends as go on talking on either my husband or me before my very\nface. What he was, I know; and what I am, I reckon he knows. And now\nI'll go hurry tea, for yo'll be needing it, Molly!'\n\nThe last clause of this speech was meant to make peace; but Molly\nwas in twenty minds as to whether she should accept the olive-branch\nor not. Her temper, however, was of that obtuse kind which is not\neasily ruffled; her mind, stagnant in itself, enjoyed excitement\nfrom without; and her appetite was invariably good, so she stayed,\nin spite of the inevitable _tete-a-tete_ with Alice. The latter,\nhowever, refused to be drawn into conversation again; replying to\nMrs. Brunton's speeches with a curt yes or no, when, indeed, she\nreplied at all.\n\nWhen all were gathered at tea, Sylvia was quite calm again; rather\npaler than usual, and very attentive and subduced in her behaviour\nto Alice; she would evidently fain have been silent, but as Molly\nwas her own especial guest, that could not be, so all her endeavours\nwent towards steering the conversation away from any awkward points.\nBut each of the four, let alone little Bella, was thankful when the\nmarket-cart drew up at the shop door, that was to take Mrs. Brunton\nback to her sister's house.\n\nWhen she was fairly off, Alice Rose opened her mouth in strong\ncondemnation; winding up with--\n\n'And if aught in my words gave thee cause for offence, Sylvia, it\nwas because my heart rose within me at the kind of talk thee and she\nhad been having about Philip; and her evil and light-minded counsel\nto thee about waiting seven years, and then wedding another.'\n\nHard as these words may seem when repeated, there was something of a\nnearer approach to an apology in Mrs. Rose's manner than Sylvia had\never seen in it before. She was silent for a few moments, then she\nsaid,--\n\n'I ha' often thought of telling yo' and Hester, special-like, when\nyo've been so kind to my little Bella, that Philip an' me could\nniver come together again; no, not if he came home this very\nnight----'\n\nShe would have gone on speaking, but Hester interrupted her with a\nlow cry of dismay.\n\nAlice said,--\n\n'Hush thee, Hester. It's no business o' thine. Sylvia Hepburn,\nthou'rt speaking like a silly child.'\n\n'No. I'm speaking like a woman; like a woman as finds out she's been\ncheated by men as she trusted, and as has no help for it. I'm noane\ngoing to say any more about it. It's me as has been wronged, and as\nhas to bear it: only I thought I'd tell yo' both this much, that yo'\nmight know somewhat why he went away, and how I said my last word\nabout it.'\n\nSo indeed it seemed. To all questions and remonstrances from Alice,\nSylvia turned a deaf ear. She averted her face from Hester's sad,\nwistful looks; only when they were parting for the night, at the top\nof the little staircase, she turned, and putting her arms round\nHester's neck she laid her head on her neck, and whispered,--\n\n'Poor Hester--poor, poor Hester! if yo' an' he had but been married\ntogether, what a deal o' sorrow would ha' been spared to us all!'\n\nHester pushed her away as she finished these words; looked\nsearchingly into her face, her eyes, and then followed Sylvia into\nher room, where Bella lay sleeping, shut the door, and almost knelt\ndown at Sylvia's feet, clasping her, and hiding her face in the\nfolds of the other's gown.\n\n'Sylvia, Sylvia,' she murmured, 'some one has told you--I thought no\none knew--it's no sin--it's done away with now--indeed it is--it was\nlong ago--before yo' were married; but I cannot forget. It was a\nshame, perhaps, to have thought on it iver, when he niver thought o'\nme; but I niver believed as any one could ha' found it out. I'm just\nfit to sink into t' ground, what wi' my sorrow and my shame.'\n\nHester was stopped by her own rising sobs, immediately she was in\nSylvia's arms. Sylvia was sitting on the ground holding her, and\nsoothing her with caresses and broken words.\n\n'I'm allays saying t' wrong things,' said she. 'It seems as if I\nwere all upset to-day; and indeed I am;' she added, alluding to the\nnews of Kinraid's marriage she had yet to think upon.\n\n'But it wasn't yo', Hester: it were nothing yo' iver said, or did,\nor looked, for that matter. It were yo'r mother as let it out.'\n\n'Oh, mother! mother!' wailed out Hester; 'I niver thought as any one\nbut God would ha' known that I had iver for a day thought on his\nbeing more to me than a brother.'\n\nSylvia made no reply, only went on stroking Hester's smooth brown\nhair, off which her cap had fallen. Sylvia was thinking how strange\nlife was, and how love seemed to go all at cross purposes; and was\nlosing herself in bewilderment at the mystery of the world; she was\nalmost startled when Hester rose up, and taking Sylvia's hands in\nboth of hers, and looking solemnly at her, said,--\n\n'Sylvia, yo' know what has been my trouble and my shame, and I'm\nsure yo're sorry for me--for I will humble myself to yo', and own\nthat for many months before yo' were married, I felt my\ndisappointment like a heavy burden laid on me by day and by night;\nbut now I ask yo', if yo've any pity for me for what I went through,\nor if yo've any love for me because of yo'r dead mother's love for\nme, or because of any fellowship, or daily breadliness between us\ntwo,--put the hard thoughts of Philip away from out yo'r heart; he\nmay ha' done yo' wrong, anyway yo' think that he has; I niver knew\nhim aught but kind and good; but if he comes back from wheriver in\nth' wide world he's gone to (and there's not a night but I pray God\nto keep him, and send him safe back), yo' put away the memory of\npast injury, and forgive it all, and be, what yo' can be, Sylvia, if\nyou've a mind to, just the kind, good wife he ought to have.'\n\n'I cannot; yo' know nothing about it, Hester.'\n\n'Tell me, then,' pleaded Hester.\n\n'No!' said Sylvia, after a moment's hesitation; 'I'd do a deal for\nyo', I would, but I daren't forgive Philip, even if I could; I took\na great oath again' him. Ay, yo' may look shocked at me, but it's\nhim as yo' ought for to be shocked at if yo' knew all. I said I'd\nniver forgive him; I shall keep to my word.'\n\n'I think I'd better pray for his death, then,' said Hester,\nhopelessly, and almost bitterly, loosing her hold of Sylvia's hands.\n\n'If it weren't for baby theere, I could think as it were my death as\n'ud be best. Them as one thinks t' most on, forgets one soonest.'\n\nIt was Kinraid to whom she was alluding; but Hester did not\nunderstand her; and after standing for a moment in silence, she\nkissed her, and left her for the night.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XL\n\nAN UNEXPECTED MESSENGER\n\n\nAfter this agitation, and these partial confidences, no more was\nsaid on the subject of Philip for many weeks. They avoided even the\nslightest allusion to him; and none of them knew how seldom or how\noften he might be present in the minds of the others.\n\nOne day the little Bella was unusually fractious with some slight\nchildish indisposition, and Sylvia was obliged to have recourse to a\nnever-failing piece of amusement; namely, to take the child into the\nshop, when the number of new, bright-coloured articles was sure to\nbeguile the little girl out of her fretfulness. She was walking\nalong the high terrace of the counter, kept steady by her mother's\nhand, when Mr. Dawson's market-cart once more stopped before the\ndoor. But it was not Mrs. Brunton who alighted now; it was a very\nsmartly-dressed, very pretty young lady, who put one dainty foot\nbefore the other with care, as if descending from such a primitive\nvehicle were a new occurrence in her life. Then she looked up at the\nnames above the shop-door, and after ascertaining that this was\nindeed the place she desired to find, she came in blushing.\n\n'Is Mrs. Hepburn at home?' she asked of Hester, whose position in the\nshop brought her forwards to receive the customers, while Sylvia\ndrew Bella out of sight behind some great bales of red flannel.\n\n'Can I see her?' the sweet, south-country voice went on, still\naddressing Hester. Sylvia heard the inquiry, and came forwards, with\na little rustic awkwardness, feeling both shy and curious.\n\n'Will yo' please walk this way, ma'am?' said she, leading her\nvisitor back into her own dominion of the parlour, and leaving Bella\nto Hester's willing care.\n\n'You don't know me!' said the pretty young lady, joyously. 'But I\nthink you knew my husband. I am Mrs. Kinraid!'\n\nA sob of surprise rose to Sylvia's lips--she choked it down,\nhowever, and tried to conceal any emotion she might feel, in placing\na chair for her visitor, and trying to make her feel welcome,\nalthough, if the truth must be told, Sylvia was wondering all the\ntime why her visitor came, and how soon she would go.\n\n'You knew Captain Kinraid, did you not?' said the young lady, with\ninnocent inquiry; to which Sylvia's lips formed the answer, 'Yes,'\nbut no clear sound issued therefrom.\n\n'But I know your husband knew the captain; is he at home yet? Can I\nspeak to him? I do so want to see him.'\n\nSylvia was utterly bewildered; Mrs. Kinraid, this pretty, joyous,\nprosperous little bird of a woman, Philip, Charley's wife, what\ncould they have in common? what could they know of each other? All\nshe could say in answer to Mrs. Kinraid's eager questions, and still\nmore eager looks, was, that her husband was from home, had been long\nfrom home: she did not know where he was, she did not know when he\nwould come back.\n\nMrs. Kinraid's face fell a little, partly from her own real\ndisappointment, partly out of sympathy with the hopeless,\nindifferent tone of Sylvia's replies.\n\n'Mrs. Dawson told me he had gone away rather suddenly a year ago, but\nI thought he might be come home by now. I am expecting the captain\nearly next month. Oh! how I should have liked to see Mr. Hepburn, and\nto thank him for saving the captain's life!'\n\n'What do yo' mean?' asked Sylvia, stirred out of all assumed\nindifference. 'The captain! is that' (not 'Charley', she could not\nuse that familiar name to the pretty young wife before her) 'yo'r\nhusband?'\n\n'Yes, you knew him, didn't you? when he used to be staying with Mr\nCorney, his uncle?'\n\n'Yes, I knew him; but I don't understand. Will yo' please to tell me\nall about it, ma'am?' said Sylvia, faintly.\n\n'I thought your husband would have told you all about it; I hardly\nknow where to begin. You know my husband is a sailor?'\n\nSylvia nodded assent, listening greedily, her heart beating thick\nall the time.\n\n'And he's now a Commander in the Royal Navy, all earned by his own\nbravery! Oh! I am so proud of him!'\n\nSo could Sylvia have been if she had been his wife; as it was, she\nthought how often she had felt sure that he would be a great man\nsome day.\n\n'And he has been at the siege of Acre.'\n\nSylvia looked perplexed at these strange words, and Mrs. Kinraid\ncaught the look.\n\n'St Jean d'Acre, you know--though it's fine saying \"you know\", when\nI didn't know a bit about it myself till the captain's ship was\nordered there, though I was the head girl at Miss Dobbin's in the\ngeography class--Acre is a seaport town, not far from Jaffa, which\nis the modern name for Joppa, where St Paul went to long ago; you've\nread of that, I'm sure, and Mount Carmel, where the prophet Elijah\nwas once, all in Palestine, you know, only the Turks have got it\nnow?'\n\n'But I don't understand yet,' said Sylvia, plaintively; 'I daresay\nit's all very true about St Paul, but please, ma'am, will yo' tell\nme about yo'r husband and mine--have they met again?'\n\n'Yes, at Acre, I tell you,' said Mrs. Kinraid, with pretty petulance.\n'The Turks held the town, and the French wanted to take it; and we,\nthat is the British Fleet, wouldn't let them. So Sir Sidney Smith, a\ncommodore and a great friend of the captain's, landed in order to\nfight the French; and the captain and many of the sailors landed\nwith him; and it was burning hot; and the poor captain was wounded,\nand lay a-dying of pain and thirst within the enemy's--that is the\nFrench--fire; so that they were ready to shoot any one of his own\nside who came near him. They thought he was dead himself, you see,\nas he was very near; and would have been too, if your husband had\nnot come out of shelter, and taken him up in his arms or on his back\n(I couldn't make out which), and carried him safe within the walls.'\n\n'It couldn't have been Philip,' said Sylvia, dubiously.\n\n'But it was. The captain says so; and he's not a man to be mistaken.\nI thought I'd got his letter with me; and I would have read you a\npart of it, but I left it at Mrs. Dawson's in my desk; and I can't\nsend it to you,' blushing as she remembered certain passages in\nwhich 'the captain' wrote very much like a lover, 'or else I would.\nBut you may be quite sure it was your husband that ventured into all\nthat danger to save his old friend's life, or the captain would not\nhave said so.'\n\n'But they weren't--they weren't--not to call great friends.'\n\n'I wish I'd got the letter here; I can't think how I could be so\nstupid; I think I can almost remember the very words, though--I've\nread them over so often. He says, \"Just as I gave up all hope, I saw\none Philip Hepburn, a man whom I had known at Monkshaven, and whom I\nhad some reason to remember well\"--(I'm sure he says so--\"remember\nwell\"), \"he saw me too, and came at the risk of his life to where I\nlay. I fully expected he would be shot down; and I shut my eyes not\nto see the end of my last chance. The shot rained about him, and I\nthink he was hit; but he took me up and carried me under cover.\" I'm\nsure he says that, I've read it over so often; and he goes on and\nsays how he hunted for Mr. Hepburn all through the ships, as soon as\never he could; but he could hear nothing of him, either alive or\ndead. Don't go so white, for pity's sake!' said she, suddenly\nstartled by Sylvia's blanching colour. 'You see, because he couldn't\nfind him alive is no reason for giving him up as dead; because his\nname wasn't to be found on any of the ships' books; so the captain\nthinks he must have been known by a different name to his real one.\nOnly he says he should like to have seen him to have thanked him;\nand he says he would give a deal to know what has become of him; and\nas I was staying two days at Mrs. Dawson's, I told them I must come\nover to Monkshaven, if only for five minutes, just to hear if your\ngood husband was come home, and to shake his hands, that helped to\nsave my own dear captain.'\n\n'I don't think it could have been Philip,' reiterated Sylvia.\n\n'Why not?' asked her visitor; 'you say you don't know where he is;\nwhy mightn't he have been there where the captain says he was?'\n\n'But he wasn't a sailor, nor yet a soldier.'\n\n'Oh! but he was. I think somewhere the captain calls him a marine;\nthat's neither one nor the other, but a little of both. He'll be\ncoming home some day soon; and then you'll see!'\n\nAlice Rose came in at this minute, and Mrs. Kinraid jumped to the\nconclusion that she was Sylvia's mother, and in her overflowing\ngratitude and friendliness to all the family of him who had 'saved\nthe captain' she went forward, and shook the old woman's hand in\nthat pleasant confiding way that wins all hearts.\n\n'Here's your daughter, ma'am!' said she to the half-astonished,\nhalf-pleased Alice. 'I'm Mrs. Kinraid, the wife of the captain that\nused to be in these parts, and I'm come to bring her news of her\nhusband, and she don't half believe me, though it's all to his\ncredit, I'm sure.'\n\nAlice looked so perplexed that Sylvia felt herself bound to explain.\n\n'She says he's either a soldier or a sailor, and a long way off at\nsome place named in t' Bible.'\n\n'Philip Hepburn led away to be a soldier!' said she, 'who had once\nbeen a Quaker?'\n\n'Yes, and a very brave one too, and one that it would do my heart\ngood to look upon,' exclaimed Mrs. Kinraid. 'He's been saving my\nhusband's life in the Holy Land, where Jerusalem is, you know.'\n\n'Nay!' said Alice, a little scornfully. 'I can forgive Sylvia for\nnot being over keen to credit thy news. Her man of peace becoming a\nman of war; and suffered to enter Jerusalem, which is a heavenly and\na typical city at this time; while me, as is one of the elect, is\nobliged to go on dwelling in Monkshaven, just like any other body.'\n\n'Nay, but,' said Mrs. Kinraid, gently, seeing she was touching on\ndelicate ground, 'I did not say he had gone to Jerusalem, but my\nhusband saw him in those parts, and he was doing his duty like a\nbrave, good man; ay, and more than his duty; and, you may take my\nword for it, he'll be at home some day soon, and all I beg is that\nyou'll let the captain and me know, for I'm sure if we can, we'll\nboth come and pay our respects to him. And I'm very glad I've seen\nyou,' said she, rising to go, and putting out her hand to shake that\nof Sylvia; 'for, besides being Hepburn's wife, I'm pretty sure I've\nheard the captain speak of you; and if ever you come to Bristol I\nhope you'll come and see us on Clifton Downs.'\n\nShe went away, leaving Sylvia almost stunned by the new ideas\npresented to her. Philip a soldier! Philip in a battle, risking his\nlife. Most strange of all, Charley and Philip once more meeting\ntogether, not as rivals or as foes, but as saviour and saved! Add to\nall this the conviction, strengthened by every word that happy,\nloving wife had uttered, that Kinraid's old, passionate love for\nherself had faded away and vanished utterly: its very existence\napparently blotted out of his memory. She had torn up her love for\nhim by the roots, but she felt as if she could never forget that it\nhad been.\n\nHester brought back Bella to her mother. She had not liked to\ninterrupt the conversation with the strange lady before; and now she\nfound her mother in an obvious state of excitement; Sylvia quieter\nthan usual.\n\n'That was Kinraid's wife, Hester! Him that was th' specksioneer as\nmade such a noise about t' place at the time of Darley's death. He's\nnow a captain--a navy captain, according to what she says. And she'd\nfain have us believe that Philip is abiding in all manner of\nScripture places; places as has been long done away with, but the\nsimilitude whereof is in the heavens, where the elect shall one day\nsee them. And she says Philip is there, and a soldier, and that he\nsaved her husband's life, and is coming home soon. I wonder what\nJohn and Jeremiah 'll say to his soldiering then? It'll noane be to\ntheir taste, I'm thinking.'\n\nThis was all very unintelligible to Hester, and she would dearly\nhave liked to question Sylvia; but Sylvia sate a little apart, with\nBella on her knee, her cheek resting on her child's golden curls,\nand her eyes fixed and almost trance-like, as if she were seeing\nthings not present.\n\nSo Hester had to be content with asking her mother as many\nelucidatory questions as she could; and after all did not gain a\nvery clear idea of what had really been said by Mrs. Kinraid, as her\nmother was more full of the apparent injustice of Philip's being\nallowed the privilege of treading on holy ground--if, indeed, that\nholy ground existed on this side heaven, which she was inclined to\ndispute--than to confine herself to the repetition of words, or\nnarration of facts.\n\nSuddenly Sylvia roused herself to a sense of Hester's deep interest\nand balked inquiries, and she went over the ground rapidly.\n\n'Yo'r mother says right--she is his wife. And he's away fighting;\nand got too near t' French as was shooting and firing all round him;\nand just then, according to her story, Philip saw him, and went\nstraight into t' midst o' t' shots, and fetched him out o' danger.\nThat's what she says, and upholds.'\n\n'And why should it not be?' asked Hester, her cheek flushing.\n\nBut Sylvia only shook her head, and said,\n\n'I cannot tell. It may be so. But they'd little cause to be friends,\nand it seems all so strange--Philip a soldier, and them meeting\ntheere after all!'\n\nHester laid the story of Philip's bravery to her heart--she fully\nbelieved in it. Sylvia pondered it more deeply still; the causes for\nher disbelief, or, at any rate, for her wonder, were unknown to\nHester! Many a time she sank to sleep with the picture of the event\nnarrated by Mrs. Kinraid as present to her mind as her imagination or\nexperience could make it: first one figure prominent, then another.\nMany a morning she wakened up, her heart beating wildly, why, she\nknew not, till she shuddered at the remembrance of the scenes that\nhad passed in her dreams: scenes that might be acted in reality that\nvery day; for Philip might come back, and then?\n\nAnd where was Philip all this time, these many weeks, these heavily\npassing months?\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLI\n\nTHE BEDESMAN OF ST SEPULCHRE\n\n\nPhilip lay long ill on board the hospital ship. If his heart had\nbeen light, he might have rallied sooner; but he was so depressed he\ndid not care to live. His shattered jaw-bone, his burnt and\nblackened face, his many injuries of body, were torture to both his\nphysical frame, and his sick, weary heart. No more chance for him,\nif indeed there ever had been any, of returning gay and gallant, and\nthus regaining his wife's love. This had been his poor, foolish\nvision in the first hour of his enlistment; and the vain dream had\nrecurred more than once in the feverish stage of excitement which\nthe new scenes into which he had been hurried as a recruit had\ncalled forth. But that was all over now. He knew that it was the\nmost unlikely thing in the world to have come to pass; and yet those\nwere happy days when he could think of it as barely possible. Now\nall he could look forward to was disfigurement, feebleness, and the\nbare pittance that keeps pensioners from absolute want.\n\nThose around him were kind enough to him in their fashion, and\nattended to his bodily requirements; but they had no notion of\nlistening to any revelations of unhappiness, if Philip had been the\nman to make confidences of that kind. As it was, he lay very still\nin his berth, seldom asking for anything, and always saying he was\nbetter, when the ship-surgeon came round with his daily inquiries.\nBut he did not care to rally, and was rather sorry to find that his\ncase was considered so interesting in a surgical point of view, that\nhe was likely to receive a good deal more than the average amount of\nattention. Perhaps it was owing to this that he recovered at all.\nThe doctors said it was the heat that made him languid, for that his\nwounds and burns were all doing well at last; and by-and-by they\ntold him they had ordered him 'home'. His pulse sank under the\nsurgeon's finger at the mention of the word; but he did not say a\nword. He was too indifferent to life and the world to have a will;\notherwise they might have kept their pet patient a little longer\nwhere he was.\n\nSlowly passing from ship to ship as occasion served; resting here\nand there in garrison hospitals, Philip at length reached Portsmouth\non the evening of a September day in 1799. The transport-ship in\nwhich he was, was loaded with wounded and invalided soldiers and\nsailors; all who could manage it in any way struggled on deck to\ncatch the first view of the white coasts of England. One man lifted\nhis arm, took off his cap, and feebly waved it aloft, crying, 'Old\nEngland for ever!' in a faint shrill voice, and then burst into\ntears and sobbed aloud. Others tried to pipe up 'Rule Britannia',\nwhile more sate, weak and motionless, looking towards the shores\nthat once, not so long ago, they never thought to see again. Philip\nwas one of these; his place a little apart from the other men. He\nwas muffled up in a great military cloak that had been given him by\none of his officers; he felt the September breeze chill after his\nsojourn in a warmer climate, and in his shattered state of health.\n\nAs the ship came in sight of Portsmouth harbour, the signal flags\nran up the ropes; the beloved Union Jack floated triumphantly over\nall. Return signals were made from the harbour; on board all became\nbustle and preparation for landing; while on shore there was the\nevident movement of expectation, and men in uniform were seen\npressing their way to the front, as if to them belonged the right of\nreception. They were the men from the barrack hospital, that had\nbeen signalled for, come down with ambulance litters and other marks\nof forethought for the sick and wounded, who were returning to the\ncountry for which they had fought and suffered.\n\nWith a dash and a great rocking swing the vessel came up to her\nappointed place, and was safely moored. Philip sat still, almost as\nif he had no part in the cries of welcome, the bustling care, the\nloud directions that cut the air around him, and pierced his nerves\nthrough and through. But one in authority gave the order; and\nPhilip, disciplined to obedience, rose to find his knapsack and\nleave the ship. Passive as he seemed to be, he had his likings for\nparticular comrades; there was one especially, a man as different\nfrom Philip as well could be, to whom the latter had always attached\nhimself; a merry fellow from Somersetshire, who was almost always\ncheerful and bright, though Philip had overheard the doctors say he\nwould never be the man he was before he had that shot through the\nside. This marine would often sit making his fellows laugh, and\nlaughing himself at his own good-humoured jokes, till so terrible a\nfit of coughing came on that those around him feared he would die in\nthe paroxysm. After one of these fits he had gasped out some words,\nwhich led Philip to question him a little; and it turned out that in\nthe quiet little village of Potterne, far inland, nestled beneath\nthe high stretches of Salisbury Plain, he had a wife and a child, a\nlittle girl, just the same age even to a week as Philip's own little\nBella. It was this that drew Philip towards the man; and this that\nmade Philip wait and go ashore along with the poor consumptive\nmarine.\n\nThe litters had moved off towards the hospital, the sergeant in\ncharge had given his words of command to the remaining invalids, who\ntried to obey them to the best of their power, falling into\nsomething like military order for their march; but soon, very soon,\nthe weakest broke step, and lagged behind; and felt as if the rough\nwelcomes and rude expressions of sympathy from the crowd around were\nalmost too much for them. Philip and his companion were about\nmidway, when suddenly a young woman with a child in her arms forced\nherself through the people, between the soldiers who kept pressing\non either side, and threw herself on the neck of Philip's friend.\n\n'Oh, Jem!' she sobbed, 'I've walked all the road from Potterne. I've\nnever stopped but for food and rest for Nelly, and now I've got you\nonce again, I've got you once again, bless God for it!'\n\nShe did not seem to see the deadly change that had come over her\nhusband since she parted with him a ruddy young labourer; she had\ngot him once again, as she phrased it, and that was enough for her;\nshe kissed his face, his hands, his very coat, nor would she be\nrepulsed from walking beside him and holding his hand, while her\nlittle girl ran along scared by the voices and the strange faces,\nand clinging to her mammy's gown.\n\nJem coughed, poor fellow! he coughed his churchyard cough; and\nPhilip bitterly envied him--envied his life, envied his approaching\ndeath; for was he not wrapped round with that woman's tender love,\nand is not such love stronger than death? Philip had felt as if his\nown heart was grown numb, and as though it had changed to a cold\nheavy stone. But at the contrast of this man's lot to his own, he\nfelt that he had yet the power of suffering left to him.\n\nThe road they had to go was full of people, kept off in some measure\nby the guard of soldiers. All sorts of kindly speeches, and many a\ncurious question, were addressed to the poor invalids as they walked\nalong. Philip's jaw, and the lower part of his face, were bandaged\nup; his cap was slouched down; he held his cloak about him, and\nshivered within its folds.\n\nThey came to a standstill from some slight obstacle at the corner of\na street. Down the causeway of this street a naval officer with a\nlady on his arm was walking briskly, with a step that told of health\nand a light heart. He stayed his progress though, when he saw the\nconvoy of maimed and wounded men; he said something, of which Philip\nonly caught the words, 'same uniform,' 'for his sake,' to the young\nlady, whose cheek blanched a little, but whose eyes kindled. Then\nleaving her for an instant, he pressed forward; he was close to\nPhilip,--poor sad Philip absorbed in his own thoughts,--so absorbed\nthat he noticed nothing till he heard a voice at his ear, having the\nNorthumbrian burr, the Newcastle inflections which he knew of old,\nand that were to him like the sick memory of a deadly illness; and\nthen he turned his muffled face to the speaker, though he knew well\nenough who it was, and averted his eyes after one sight of the\nhandsome, happy man,--the man whose life he had saved once, and\nwould save again, at the risk of his own, but whom, for all that, he\nprayed that he might never meet more on earth.\n\n'Here, my fine fellow, take this,' forcing a crown piece into\nPhilip's hand. 'I wish it were more; I'd give you a pound if I had\nit with me.'\n\nPhilip muttered something, and held out the coin to Captain Kinraid,\nof course in vain; nor was there time to urge it back upon the\ngiver, for the obstacle to their progress was suddenly removed, the\ncrowd pressed upon the captain and his wife, the procession moved\non, and Philip along with it, holding the piece in his hand, and\nlonging to throw it far away. Indeed he was on the point of dropping\nit, hoping to do so unperceived, when he bethought him of giving it\nto Jem's wife, the footsore woman, limping happily along by her\nhusband's side. They thanked him, and spoke in his praise more than\nhe could well bear. It was no credit to him to give that away which\nburned his fingers as long as he kept it.\n\nPhilip knew that the injuries he had received in the explosion on\nboard the _Theseus_ would oblige him to leave the service. He also\nbelieved that they would entitle him to a pension. But he had little\ninterest in his future life; he was without hope, and in a depressed\nstate of health. He remained for some little time stationary, and\nthen went through all the forms of dismissal on account of wounds\nreceived in service, and was turned out loose upon the world,\nuncertain where to go, indifferent as to what became of him.\n\nIt was fine, warm October weather as he turned his back upon the\ncoast, and set off on his walk northwards. Green leaves were yet\nupon the trees; the hedges were one flush of foliage and the wild\nrough-flavoured fruits of different kinds; the fields were tawny\nwith the uncleared-off stubble, or emerald green with the growth of\nthe aftermath. The roadside cottage gardens were gay with hollyhocks\nand Michaelmas daisies and marigolds, and the bright panes of the\nwindows glittered through a veil of China roses.\n\nThe war was a popular one, and, as a natural consequence, soldiers\nand sailors were heroes everywhere. Philip's long drooping form, his\narm hung in a sling, his face scarred and blackened, his jaw bound\nup with a black silk handkerchief; these marks of active service\nwere reverenced by the rustic cottagers as though they had been\ncrowns and sceptres. Many a hard-handed labourer left his seat by\nthe chimney corner, and came to his door to have a look at one who\nhad been fighting the French, and pushed forward to have a grasp of\nthe stranger's hand as he gave back the empty cup into the good\nwife's keeping, for the kind homely women were ever ready with milk\nor homebrewed to slake the feverish traveller's thirst when he\nstopped at their doors and asked for a drink of water.\n\nAt the village public-house he had had a welcome of a more\ninterested character, for the landlord knew full well that his\ncircle of customers would be large that night, if it was only known\nthat he had within his doors a soldier or a sailor who had seen\nservice. The rustic politicians would gather round Philip, and smoke\nand drink, and then question and discuss till they were drouthy\nagain; and in their sturdy obtuse minds they set down the extra\nglass and the supernumerary pipe to the score of patriotism.\n\nAltogether human nature turned its sunny side out to Philip just\nnow; and not before he needed the warmth of brotherly kindness to\ncheer his shivering soul. Day after day he drifted northwards,\nmaking but the slow progress of a feeble man, and yet this short\ndaily walk tired him so much that he longed for rest--for the\nmorning to come when he needed not to feel that in the course of an\nhour or two he must be up and away.\n\nHe was toiling on with this longing at his heart when he saw that he\nwas drawing near a stately city, with a great old cathedral in the\ncentre keeping solemn guard. This place might be yet two or three\nmiles distant; he was on a rising ground looking down upon it. A\nlabouring man passing by, observed his pallid looks and his languid\nattitude, and told him for his comfort, that if he turned down a\nlane to the left a few steps farther on, he would find himself at\nthe Hospital of St Sepulchre, where bread and beer were given to all\ncomers, and where he might sit him down and rest awhile on the old\nstone benches within the shadow of the gateway. Obeying these\ndirections, Philip came upon a building which dated from the time of\nHenry the Fifth. Some knight who had fought in the French wars of\nthat time, and had survived his battles and come home to his old\nhalls, had been stirred up by his conscience, or by what was\nequivalent in those days, his confessor, to build and endow a\nhospital for twelve decayed soldiers, and a chapel wherein they were\nto attend the daily masses he ordained to be said till the end of\nall time (which eternity lasted rather more than a century, pretty\nwell for an eternity bespoken by a man), for his soul and the souls\nof those whom he had slain. There was a large division of the\nquadrangular building set apart for the priest who was to say these\nmasses; and to watch over the well-being of the bedesmen. In process\nof years the origin and primary purpose of the hospital had been\nforgotten by all excepting the local antiquaries; and the place\nitself came to be regarded as a very pleasant quaint set of\nalmshouses; and the warden's office (he who should have said or sung\nhis daily masses was now called the warden, and read daily prayers\nand preached a sermon on Sundays) an agreeable sinecure.\n\nAnother legacy of old Sir Simon Bray was that of a small croft of\nland, the rent or profits of which were to go towards giving to all\nwho asked for it a manchet of bread and a cup of good beer. This\nbeer was, so Sir Simon ordained, to be made after a certain receipt\nwhich he left, in which ground ivy took the place of hops. But the\nreceipt, as well as the masses, was modernized according to the\nprogress of time.\n\nPhilip stood under a great broad stone archway; the back-door into\nthe warden's house was on the right side; a kind of buttery-hatch\nwas placed by the porter's door on the opposite side. After some\nconsideration, Philip knocked at the closed shutter, and the signal\nseemed to be well understood. He heard a movement within; the hatch\nwas drawn aside, and his bread and beer were handed to him by a\npleasant-looking old man, who proved himself not at all disinclined\nfor conversation.\n\n'You may sit down on yonder bench,' said he. 'Nay, man! sit i' the\nsun, for it's a chilly place, this, and then you can look through\nthe grate and watch th' old fellows toddling about in th' quad.'\n\nPhilip sat down where the warm October sun slanted upon him, and\nlooked through the iron railing at the peaceful sight.\n\nA great square of velvet lawn, intersected diagonally with broad\nflag-paved walks, the same kind of walk going all round the\nquadrangle; low two-storied brick houses, tinted gray and yellow by\nage, and in many places almost covered with vines, Virginian\ncreepers, and monthly roses; before each house a little plot of\ngarden ground, bright with flowers, and evidently tended with the\nutmost care; on the farther side the massive chapel; here and there\nan old or infirm man sunning himself, or leisurely doing a bit of\ngardening, or talking to one of his comrades--the place looked as if\ncare and want, and even sorrow, were locked out and excluded by the\nponderous gate through which Philip was gazing.\n\n'It's a nice enough place, bean't it?' said the porter, interpreting\nPhilip's looks pretty accurately. 'Leastways, for them as likes it.\nI've got a bit weary on it myself; it's so far from th' world, as a\nman may say; not a decent public within a mile and a half, where one\ncan hear a bit o' news of an evening.'\n\n'I think I could make myself very content here,' replied Philip.\n'That's to say, if one were easy in one's mind.'\n\n'Ay, ay, my man. That's it everywhere. Why, I don't think that I\ncould enjoy myself--not even at th' White Hart, where they give you\nas good a glass of ale for twopence as anywhere i' th' four\nkingdoms--I couldn't, to say, flavour my ale even there, if my old\nwoman lay a-dying; which is a sign as it's the heart, and not the\nale, as makes the drink.'\n\nJust then the warden's back-door opened, and out came the warden\nhimself, dressed in full clerical costume.\n\nHe was going into the neighbouring city, but he stopped to speak to\nPhilip, the wounded soldier; and all the more readily because his\nold faded uniform told the warden's experienced eye that he had\nbelonged to the Marines.\n\n'I hope you enjoy the victual provided for you by the founder of St\nSepulchre,' said he, kindly. 'You look but poorly, my good fellow,\nand as if a slice of good cold meat would help your bread down.'\n\n'Thank you, sir!' said Philip. 'I'm not hungry, only weary, and glad\nof a draught of beer.'\n\n'You've been in the Marines, I see. Where have you been serving?'\n\n'I was at the siege of Acre, last May, sir.'\n\n'At Acre! Were you, indeed? Then perhaps you know my boy Harry? He\nwas in the----th.'\n\n'It was my company,' said Philip, warming up a little. Looking back\nupon his soldier's life, it seemed to him to have many charms,\nbecause it was so full of small daily interests.\n\n'Then, did you know my son, Lieutenant Pennington?'\n\n'It was he that gave me this cloak, sir, when they were sending me\nback to England. I had been his servant for a short time before I\nwas wounded by the explosion on board the _Theseus_, and he said I\nshould feel the cold of the voyage. He's very kind; and I've heard\nsay he promises to be a first-rate officer.'\n\n'You shall have a slice of roast beef, whether you want it or not,'\nsaid the warden, ringing the bell at his own back-door. 'I recognize\nthe cloak now--the young scamp! How soon he has made it shabby,\nthough,' he continued, taking up a corner where there was an immense\ntear not too well botched up. 'And so you were on board the\n_Theseus_ at the time of the explosion? Bring some cold meat here\nfor the good man--or stay! Come in with me, and then you can tell\nMrs. Pennington and the young ladies all you know about Harry,--and\nthe siege,--and the explosion.'\n\nSo Philip was ushered into the warden's house and made to eat roast\nbeef almost against his will; and he was questioned and\ncross-questioned by three eager ladies, all at the same time, as it\nseemed to him. He had given all possible details on the subjects\nabout which they were curious; and was beginning to consider how he\ncould best make his retreat, when the younger Miss Pennington went\nup to her father--who had all this time stood, with his hat on,\nholding his coat-tails over his arms, with his back to the fire. He\nbent his ear down a very little to hear some whispered suggestion of\nhis daughter's, nodded his head, and then went on questioning\nPhilip, with kindly inquisitiveness and patronage, as the rich do\nquestion the poor.\n\n'And where are you going to now?'\n\nPhilip did not answer directly. He wondered in his own mind where he\nwas going. At length he said,\n\n'Northwards, I believe. But perhaps I shall never reach there.'\n\n'Haven't you friends? Aren't you going to them?'\n\nThere was again a pause; a cloud came over Philip's countenance. He\nsaid,\n\n'No! I'm not going to my friends. I don't know that I've got any\nleft.'\n\nThey interpreted his looks and this speech to mean that he had\neither lost his friends by death, or offended them by enlisting.\n\nThe warden went on,\n\n'I ask, because we've got a cottage vacant in the mead. Old Dobson,\nwho was with General Wolfe at the taking of Quebec, died a fortnight\nago. With such injuries as yours, I fear you'll never be able to\nwork again. But we require strict testimonials as to character,' he\nadded, with as penetrating a look as he could summon up at Philip.\n\nPhilip looked unmoved, either by the offer of the cottage, or the\nillusion to the possibility of his character not being satisfactory.\nHe was grateful enough in reality, but too heavy at heart to care\nvery much what became of him.\n\nThe warden and his family, who were accustomed to consider a\nsettlement at St Sepulchre's as the sum of all good to a worn-out\nsoldier, were a little annoyed at Philip's cool way of receiving the\nproposition. The warden went on to name the contingent advantages.\n\n'Besides the cottage, you would have a load of wood for firing on\nAll Saints', on Christmas, and on Candlemas days--a blue gown and\nsuit of clothes to match every Michaelmas, and a shilling a day to\nkeep yourself in all other things. Your dinner you would have with\nthe other men, in hall.'\n\n'The warden himself goes into hall every day, and sees that\neverything is comfortable, and says grace,' added the warden's lady.\n\n'I know I seem stupid,' said Philip, almost humbly, 'not to be more\ngrateful, for it's far beyond what I iver expected or thought for\nagain, and it's a great temptation, for I'm just worn out with\nfatigue. Several times I've thought I must lie down under a hedge,\nand just die for very weariness. But once I had a wife and a child\nup in the north,' he stopped.\n\n'And are they dead?' asked one of the young ladies in a soft\nsympathizing tone. Her eyes met Philip's, full of dumb woe. He tried\nto speak; he wanted to explain more fully, yet not to reveal the\ntruth.\n\n'Well!' said the warden, thinking he perceived the real state of\nthings, 'what I propose is this. You shall go into old Dobson's\nhouse at once, as a kind of probationary bedesman. I'll write to\nHarry, and get your character from him. Stephen Freeman I think you\nsaid your name was? Before I can receive his reply you'll have been\nable to tell how you'd like the kind of life; and at any rate you'll\nhave the rest you seem to require in the meantime. You see, I take\nHarry's having given you that cloak as a kind of character,' added\nhe, smiling kindly. 'Of course you'll have to conform to rules just\nlike all the rest,--chapel at eight, dinner at twelve, lights out at\nnine; but I'll tell you the remainder of our regulations as we walk\nacross quad to your new quarters.'\n\nAnd thus Philip, almost in spite of himself, became installed in a\nbedesman's house at St Sepulchre.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLII\n\nA FABLE AT FAULT\n\n\nPhilip took possession of the two rooms which had belonged to the\ndead Sergeant Dobson. They were furnished sufficiently for every\ncomfort by the trustees of the hospital. Some little fragments of\nornament, some small articles picked up in distant countries, a few\ntattered books, remained in the rooms as legacies from their former\noccupant.\n\nAt first the repose of the life and the place was inexpressibly\ngrateful to Philip. He had always shrunk from encountering\nstrangers, and displaying his blackened and scarred countenance to\nthem, even where such disfigurement was most regarded as a mark of\nhonour. In St Sepulchre's he met none but the same set day after\nday, and when he had once told the tale of how it happened and\nsubmitted to their gaze, it was over for ever, if he so minded. The\nslight employment his garden gave him--there was a kitchen-garden\nbehind each house, as well as the flower-plot in front--and the\ndaily arrangement of his parlour and chamber were, at the beginning\nof his time of occupation, as much bodily labour as he could manage.\nThere was something stately and utterly removed from all Philip's\nprevious existence in the forms observed at every day's dinner, when\nthe twelve bedesmen met in the large quaint hall, and the warden\ncame in his college-cap and gown to say the long Latin grace which\nwound up with something very like a prayer for the soul of Sir Simon\nBray. It took some time to get a reply to ship letters in those\ntimes when no one could exactly say where the fleet might be found.\n\nAnd before Dr Pennington had received the excellent character of\nStephen Freeman, which his son gladly sent in answer to his father's\ninquiries, Philip had become restless and uneasy in the midst of all\nthis peace and comfort.\n\nSitting alone over his fire in the long winter evenings, the scenes\nof his past life rose before him; his childhood; his aunt Robson's\ncare of him; his first going to Foster's shop in Monkshaven;\nHaytersbank Farm, and the spelling lessons in the bright warm\nkitchen there; Kinraid's appearance; the miserable night of the\nCorneys' party; the farewell he had witnessed on Monkshaven sands;\nthe press-gang, and all the long consequences of that act of\nconcealment; poor Daniel Robson's trial and execution; his own\nmarriage; his child's birth; and then he came to that last day at\nMonkshaven: and he went over and over again the torturing details,\nthe looks of contempt and anger, the words of loathing indignation,\ntill he almost brought himself, out of his extreme sympathy with\nSylvia, to believe that he was indeed the wretch she had considered\nhim to be.\n\nHe forgot his own excuses for having acted as he had done; though\nthese excuses had at one time seemed to him to wear the garb of\nreasons. After long thought and bitter memory came some wonder. What\nwas Sylvia doing now? Where was she? What was his child like--his\nchild as well as hers? And then he remembered the poor footsore wife\nand the little girl she carried in her arms, that was just the age\nof Bella; he wished he had noticed that child more, that a clear\nvision of it might rise up when he wanted to picture Bella.\n\nOne night he had gone round this mill-wheel circle of ideas till he\nwas weary to the very marrow of his bones. To shake off the\nmonotonous impression he rose to look for a book amongst the old\ntattered volumes, hoping that he might find something that would\nsufficiently lay hold of him to change the current of his thoughts.\nThere was an old volume of _Peregrine Pickle_; a book of sermons;\nhalf an army list of 1774, and the _Seven Champions of Christendom_.\nPhilip took up this last, which he had never seen before. In it he\nread how Sir Guy, Earl of Warwick, went to fight the Paynim in his\nown country, and was away for seven long years; and when he came\nback his own wife Phillis, the countess in her castle, did not know\nthe poor travel-worn hermit, who came daily to seek his dole of\nbread at her hands along with many beggars and much poor. But at\nlast, when he lay a-dying in his cave in the rock, he sent for her\nby a secret sign known but to them twain. And she came with great\nspeed, for she knew it was her lord who had sent for her; and they\nhad many sweet and holy words together before he gave up the ghost,\nhis head lying on her bosom.\n\nThe old story known to most people from their childhood was all new\nand fresh to Philip. He did not quite believe in the truth of it,\nbecause the fictitious nature of the histories of some of the other\nChampions of Christendom was too patent. But he could not help\nthinking that this one might be true; and that Guy and Phillis might\nhave been as real flesh and blood, long, long ago, as he and Sylvia\nhad even been. The old room, the quiet moonlit quadrangle into which\nthe cross-barred casement looked, the quaint aspect of everything\nthat he had seen for weeks and weeks; all this predisposed Philip to\ndwell upon the story he had just been reading as a faithful legend\nof two lovers whose bones were long since dust. He thought that if\nhe could thus see Sylvia, himself unknown, unseen--could live at her\ngates, so to speak, and gaze upon her and his child--some day too,\nwhen he lay a-dying, he might send for her, and in soft words of\nmutual forgiveness breathe his life away in her arms. Or perhaps--and\nso he lost himself, and from thinking, passed on to dreaming.\nAll night long Guy and Phillis, Sylvia and his child, passed in and\nout of his visions; it was impossible to make the fragments of his\ndreams cohere; but the impression made upon him by them was not the\nless strong for this. He felt as if he were called to Monkshaven,\nwanted at Monkshaven, and to Monkshaven he resolved to go; although\nwhen his reason overtook his feeling, he knew perfectly how unwise\nit was to leave a home of peace and tranquillity and surrounding\nfriendliness, to go to a place where nothing but want and\nwretchedness awaited him unless he made himself known; and if he\ndid, a deeper want, a more woeful wretchedness, would in all\nprobability be his portion.\n\nIn the small oblong of looking-glass hung against the wall, Philip\ncaught the reflection of his own face, and laughed scornfully at the\nsight. The thin hair lay upon his temples in the flakes that betoken\nlong ill-health; his eyes were the same as ever, and they had always\nbeen considered the best feature in his face; but they were sunk in\ntheir orbits, and looked hollow and gloomy. As for the lower part of\nhis face, blackened, contracted, drawn away from his teeth, the\noutline entirely changed by the breakage of his jaw-bone, he was\nindeed a fool if he thought himself fit to go forth to win back that\nlove which Sylvia had forsworn. As a hermit and a beggar, he must\nreturn to Monkshaven, and fall perforce into the same position which\nGuy of Warwick had only assumed. But still he should see his\nPhillis, and might feast his sad hopeless eyes from time to time\nwith the sight of his child. His small pension of sixpence a day\nwould keep him from absolute want of necessaries.\n\nSo that very day he went to the warden and told him he thought of\ngiving up his share in the bequest of Sir Simon Bray. Such a\nrelinquishment had never occurred before in all the warden's\nexperience; and he was very much inclined to be offended.\n\n'I must say that for a man not to be satisfied as a bedesman of St\nSepulchre's argues a very wrong state of mind, and a very ungrateful\nheart.'\n\n'I'm sure, sir, it's not from any ingratitude, for I can hardly feel\nthankful to you and to Sir Simon, and to madam, and the young\nladies, and all my comrades in the hospital, and I niver expect to\nbe either so comfortable or so peaceful again, but----'\n\n'But? What can you have to say against the place, then? Not but what\nthere are always plenty of applicants for every vacancy; only I\nthought I was doing a kindness to a man out of Harry's company. And\nyou'll not see Harry either; he's got his leave in March!'\n\n'I'm very sorry. I should like to have seen the lieutenant again.\nBut I cannot rest any longer so far away from--people I once knew.'\n\n'Ten to one they're dead, or removed, or something or other by this\ntime; and it'll serve you right if they are. Mind! no one can be\nchosen twice to be a bedesman of St Sepulchre's.'\n\nThe warden turned away; and Philip, uneasy at staying, disheartened\nat leaving, went to make his few preparations for setting out once\nmore on his journey northwards. He had to give notice of his change\nof residence to the local distributor of pensions; and one or two\nfarewells had to be taken, with more than usual sadness at the\nnecessity; for Philip, under his name of Stephen Freeman, had\nattached some of the older bedesmen a good deal to him, from his\nunselfishness, his willingness to read to them, and to render them\nmany little services, and, perhaps, as much as anything, by his\nhabitual silence, which made him a convenient recipient of all their\ngarrulousness. So before the time for his departure came, he had the\nopportunity of one more interview with the warden, of a more\nfriendly character than that in which he gave up his bedesmanship.\nAnd so far it was well; and Philip turned his back upon St\nSepulchre's with his sore heart partly healed by his four months'\nresidence there.\n\nHe was stronger, too, in body, more capable of the day-after-day\nwalks that were required of him. He had saved some money from his\nallowance as bedesman and from his pension, and might occasionally\nhave taken an outside place on a coach, had it not been that he\nshrank from the first look of every stranger upon his disfigured\nface. Yet the gentle, wistful eyes, and the white and faultless\nteeth always did away with the first impression as soon as people\nbecame a little acquainted with his appearance.\n\nIt was February when Philip left St Sepulchre's. It was the first\nweek in April when he began to recognize the familiar objects\nbetween York and Monkshaven. And now he began to hang back, and to\nquestion the wisdom of what he had done--just as the warden had\nprophesied that he would. The last night of his two hundred mile\nwalk he slept at the little inn at which he had been enlisted nearly\ntwo years before. It was by no intention of his that he rested at\nthat identical place. Night was drawing on; and, in making, as he\nthought, a short cut, he had missed his way, and was fain to seek\nshelter where he might find it. But it brought him very straight\nface to face with his life at that time, and ever since. His mad,\nwild hopes--half the result of intoxication, as he now knew--all\ndead and gone; the career then freshly opening shut up against him\nnow; his youthful strength and health changed into premature\ninfirmity, and the home and the love that should have opened wide\nits doors to console him for all, why in two years Death might have\nbeen busy, and taken away from him his last feeble chance of the\nfaint happiness of seeing his beloved without being seen or known of\nher. All that night and all the next day, the fear of Sylvia's\npossible death overclouded his heart. It was strange that he had\nhardly ever thought of this before; so strange, that now, when the\nterror came, it took possession of him, and he could almost have\nsworn that she must be lying dead in Monkshaven churchyard. Or was\nit little Bella, that blooming, lovely babe, whom he was never to\nsee again? There was the tolling of mournful bells in the distant\nair to his disturbed fancy, and the cry of the happy birds, the\nplaintive bleating of the new-dropped lambs, were all omens of evil\nimport to him.\n\nAs well as he could, he found his way back to Monkshaven, over the\nwild heights and moors he had crossed on that black day of misery;\nwhy he should have chosen that path he could not tell--it was as if\nhe were led, and had no free will of his own.\n\nThe soft clear evening was drawing on, and his heart beat thick, and\nthen stopped, only to start again with fresh violence. There he was,\nat the top of the long, steep lane that was in some parts a literal\nstaircase leading down from the hill-top into the High Street,\nthrough the very entry up which he had passed when he shrank away\nfrom his former and his then present life. There he stood, looking\ndown once more at the numerous irregular roofs, the many stacks of\nchimneys below him, seeking out that which had once been his own\ndwelling--who dwelt there now?\n\nThe yellower gleams grew narrower; the evening shadows broader, and\nPhilip crept down the lane a weary, woeful man. At every gap in the\nclose-packed buildings he heard the merry music of a band, the\ncheerful sound of excited voices. Still he descended slowly,\nscarcely wondering what it could be, for it was not associated in\nhis mind with the one pervading thought of Sylvia.\n\nWhen he came to the angle of junction between the lane and the High\nStreet, he seemed plunged all at once into the very centre of the\nbustle, and he drew himself up into a corner of deep shadow, from\nwhence he could look out upon the street.\n\nA circus was making its grand entry into Monkshaven, with all the\npomp of colour and of noise that it could muster. Trumpeters in\nparti-coloured clothes rode first, blaring out triumphant discord.\nNext came a gold-and-scarlet chariot drawn by six piebald horses,\nand the windings of this team through the tortuous narrow street\nwere pretty enough to look upon. In the chariot sate kings and\nqueens, heroes and heroines, or what were meant for such; all the\nlittle boys and girls running alongside of the chariot envied them;\nbut they themselves were very much tired, and shivering with cold in\ntheir heroic pomp of classic clothing. All this Philip might have\nseen; did see, in fact; but heeded not one jot. Almost opposite to\nhim, not ten yards apart, standing on the raised step at the\nwell-known shop door, was Sylvia, holding a child, a merry dancing\nchild, up in her arms to see the show. She too, Sylvia, was laughing\nfor pleasure, and for sympathy with pleasure. She held the little\nBella aloft that the child might see the gaudy procession the better\nand the longer, looking at it herself with red lips apart and white\nteeth glancing through; then she turned to speak to some one behind\nher--Coulson, as Philip saw the moment afterwards; his answer made\nher laugh once again. Philip saw it all; her bonny careless looks,\nher pretty matronly form, her evident ease of mind and prosperous\noutward circumstances. The years that he had spent in gloomy sorrow,\namongst wild scenes, on land or by sea, his life in frequent peril\nof a bloody end, had gone by with her like sunny days; all the more\nsunny because he was not there. So bitterly thought the poor\ndisabled marine, as, weary and despairing, he stood in the cold\nshadow and looked upon the home that should have been his haven, the\nwife that should have welcomed him, the child that should have been\nhis comfort. He had banished himself from his home; his wife had\nforsworn him; his child was blossoming into intelligence unwitting\nof any father. Wife, and child, and home, were all doing well\nwithout him; what madness had tempted him thither? an hour ago, like\na fanciful fool, he had thought she might be dead--dead with sad\npenitence for her cruel words at her heart--with mournful wonder at\nthe unaccounted-for absence of her child's father preying on her\nspirits, and in some measure causing the death he had apprehended.\nBut to look at her there where she stood, it did not seem as if she\nhad had an hour's painful thought in all her blooming life.\n\nAy! go in to the warm hearth, mother and child, now the gay\ncavalcade has gone out of sight, and the chill of night has\nsucceeded to the sun's setting. Husband and father, steal out into\nthe cold dark street, and seek some poor cheap lodging where you may\nrest your weary bones, and cheat your more weary heart into\nforgetfulness in sleep. The pretty story of the Countess Phillis,\nwho mourned for her husband's absence so long, is a fable of old\ntimes; or rather say Earl Guy never wedded his wife, knowing that\none she loved better than him was alive all the time she had\nbelieved him to be dead.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLIII\n\nTHE UNKNOWN\n\n\nA few days before that on which Philip arrived at Monkshaven, Kester\nhad come to pay Sylvia a visit. As the earliest friend she had, and\nalso as one who knew the real secrets of her life, Sylvia always\ngave him the warm welcome, the cordial words, and the sweet looks in\nwhich the old man delighted. He had a sort of delicacy of his own\nwhich kept him from going to see her too often, even when he was\nstationary at Monkshaven; but he looked forward to the times when he\nallowed himself this pleasure as a child at school looks forward to\nits holidays. The time of his service at Haytersbank had, on the\nwhole, been the happiest in all his long monotonous years of daily\nlabour. Sylvia's father had always treated him with the rough\nkindness of fellowship; Sylvia's mother had never stinted him in his\nmeat or grudged him his share of the best that was going; and once,\nwhen he was ill for a few days in the loft above the cow-house, she\nhad made him possets, and nursed him with the same tenderness which\nhe remembered his mother showing to him when he was a little child,\nbut which he had never experienced since then. He had known Sylvia\nherself, as bud, and sweet promise of blossom; and just as she was\nopening into the full-blown rose, and, if she had been happy and\nprosperous, might have passed out of the narrow circle of Kester's\ninterests, one sorrow after another came down upon her pretty\ninnocent head, and Kester's period of service to Daniel Robson, her\nfather, was tragically cut short. All this made Sylvia the great\ncentre of the faithful herdsman's affection; and Bella, who reminded\nhim of what Sylvia was when first Kester knew her, only occupied the\nsecond place in his heart, although to the child he was much more\ndemonstrative of his regard than to the mother.\n\nHe had dressed himself in his Sunday best, and although it was only\nThursday, had forestalled his Saturday's shaving; he had provided\nhimself with a paper of humbugs for the child--'humbugs' being the\nnorth-country term for certain lumps of toffy, well-flavoured with\npeppermint--and now he sat in the accustomed chair, as near to the\ndoor as might be, in Sylvia's presence, coaxing the little one, who\nwas not quite sure of his identity, to come to him, by opening the\npaper parcel, and letting its sweet contents be seen.\n\n'She's like thee--and yet she favours her feyther,' said he; and the\nmoment he had uttered the incautious words he looked up to see how\nSylvia had taken the unpremeditated, unusual reference to her\nhusband. His stealthy glance did not meet her eye; but though he\nthought she had coloured a little, she did not seem offended as he\nhad feared. It was true that Bella had her father's grave,\nthoughtful, dark eyes, instead of her mother's gray ones, out of\nwhich the childlike expression of wonder would never entirely pass\naway. And as Bella slowly and half distrustfully made her way\ntowards the temptation offered her, she looked at Kester with just\nher father's look.\n\nSylvia said nothing in direct reply; Kester almost thought she could\nnot have heard him. But, by-and-by, she said,--\n\n'Yo'll have heared how Kinraid--who's a captain now, and a grand\nofficer--has gone and got married.'\n\n'Nay!' said Kester, in genuine surprise. 'He niver has, for sure!'\n\n'Ay, but he has,' said Sylvia. 'And I'm sure I dunnot see why he\nshouldn't.'\n\n'Well, well!' said Kester, not looking up at her, for he caught the\ninflections in the tones of her voice. 'He were a fine stirrin'\nchap, yon; an' he were allays for doin' summut; an' when he fund as\nhe couldn't ha' one thing as he'd set his mind on, a reckon he\nthought he mun put up wi' another.'\n\n'It 'ud be no \"putting up,\"' said Sylvia. 'She were staying at Bessy\nDawson's, and she come here to see me--she's as pretty a young lady\nas yo'd see on a summer's day; and a real lady, too, wi' a fortune.\nShe didn't speak two words wi'out bringing in her husband's\nname,--\"the captain\", as she called him.'\n\n'An' she come to see thee?' said Kester, cocking his eye at Sylvia\nwith the old shrewd look. 'That were summut queer, weren't it?'\n\nSylvia reddened a good deal.\n\n'He's too fause to have spoken to her on me, in t' old way,--as he\nused for t' speak to me. I were nought to her but Philip's wife.'\n\n'An' what t' dickins had she to do wi' Philip?' asked Kester, in\nintense surprise; and so absorbed in curiosity that he let the\nhumbugs all fall out of the paper upon the floor, and the little\nBella sat down, plump, in the midst of treasures as great as those\nfabled to exist on Tom Tiddler's ground.\n\nSylvia was again silent; but Kester, knowing her well, was sure that\nshe was struggling to speak, and bided his time without repeating\nhis question.\n\n'She said--and I think her tale were true, though I cannot get to t'\nrights on it, think on it as I will--as Philip saved her husband's\nlife somewheere nearabouts to Jerusalem. She would have it that t'\ncaptain--for I think I'll niver ca' him Kinraid again--was in a\ngreat battle, and were near upon being shot by t' French, when\nPhilip--our Philip--come up and went right into t' fire o' t' guns,\nand saved her husband's life. And she spoke as if both she and t'\ncaptain were more beholden to Philip than words could tell. And she\ncome to see me, to try and get news on him.\n\n'It's a queer kind o' story,' said Kester, meditatively. 'A should\nha' thought as Philip were more likely to ha' gi'en him a shove into\nt' thick on it, than t' help him out o' t' scrape.'\n\n'Nay!' said Sylvia, suddenly looking straight at Kester; 'yo're out\ntheere. Philip had a deal o' good in him. And I dunnot think as he'd\nha' gone and married another woman so soon, if he'd been i'\nKinraid's place.'\n\n'An' yo've niver heared on Philip sin' he left?' asked Kester, after\na while.\n\n'Niver; nought but what she told me. And she said that t' captain\nmade inquiry for him right and left, as soon after that happened as\nmight be, and could hear niver a word about him. No one had seen\nhim, or knowed his name.'\n\n'Yo' niver heared of his goin' for t' be a soldier?' persevered\nKester.\n\n'Niver. I've told yo' once. It were unlike Philip to think o' such a\nthing.'\n\n'But thou mun ha' been thinkin' on him at times i' a' these years.\nBad as he'd behaved hissel', he were t' feyther o' thy little un.\nWhat did ta think he had been agait on when he left here?'\n\n'I didn't know. I were noane so keen a-thinking on him at first. I\ntried to put him out o' my thoughts a'together, for it made me like\nmad to think how he'd stood between me and--that other. But I'd\nbegun to wonder and to wonder about him, and to think I should like\nto hear as he were doing well. I reckon I thought he were i' London,\nwheere he'd been that time afore, yo' know, and had allays spoke as\nif he'd enjoyed hissel' tolerable; and then Molly Brunton told me on\nt' other one's marriage; and, somehow, it gave me a shake in my\nheart, and I began for to wish I hadn't said all them words i' my\npassion; and then that fine young lady come wi' her story--and I've\nthought a deal on it since,--and my mind has come out clear.\nPhilip's dead, and it were his spirit as come to t' other's help in\nhis time o' need. I've heard feyther say as spirits cannot rest i'\ntheir graves for trying to undo t' wrongs they've done i' their\nbodies.'\n\n'Them's my conclusions,' said Kester, solemnly. 'A was fain for to\nhear what were yo'r judgments first; but them's the conclusions I\ncomed to as soon as I heard t' tale.'\n\n'Let alone that one thing,' said Sylvia, 'he were a kind, good man.'\n\n'It were a big deal on a \"one thing\", though,' said Kester. 'It just\nspoilt yo'r life, my poor lass; an' might ha' gone near to spoilin'\nCharley Kinraid's too.'\n\n'Men takes a deal more nor women to spoil their lives,' said Sylvia,\nbitterly.\n\n'Not a' mak' o' men. I reckon, lass, Philip's life were pretty well\non for bein' spoilt at after he left here; and it were, mebbe, a\ngood thing he got rid on it so soon.'\n\n'I wish I'd just had a few kind words wi' him, I do,' said Sylvia,\nalmost on the point of crying.\n\n'Come, lass, it's as ill moanin' after what's past as it 'ud be for\nme t' fill my eyes wi' weepin' after t' humbugs as this little wench\no' thine has grubbed up whilst we'n been talkin'. Why, there's not\none on 'em left!'\n\n'She's a sad spoilt little puss!' said Sylvia, holding out her arms\nto the child, who ran into them, and began patting her mother's\ncheeks, and pulling at the soft brown curls tucked away beneath the\nmatronly cap. 'Mammy spoils her, and Hester spoils her----'\n\n'Granny Rose doesn't spoil me,' said the child, with quick,\nintelligent discrimination, interrupting her mother's list.\n\n'No; but Jeremiah Foster does above a bit. He'll come in fro' t'\nBank, Kester, and ask for her, a'most ivery day. And he'll bring her\nthings in his pocket; and she's so fause, she allays goes straight\nto peep in, and then he shifts t' apple or t' toy into another. Eh!\nbut she's a little fause one,'--half devouring the child with her\nkisses. 'And he comes and takes her a walk oftentimes, and he goes\nas slow as if he were quite an old man, to keep pace wi' Bella's\nsteps. I often run upstairs and watch 'em out o' t' window; he\ndoesn't care to have me with 'em, he's so fain t' have t' child all\nto hisself.'\n\n'She's a bonny un, for sure,' said Kester; 'but not so pretty as\nthou was, Sylvie. A've niver tell'd thee what a come for tho', and\nit's about time for me t' be goin'. A'm off to t' Cheviots to-morrow\nmorn t' fetch home some sheep as Jonas Blundell has purchased. It'll\nbe a job o' better nor two months a reckon.'\n\n'It'll be a nice time o' year,' said Sylvia, a little surprised at\nKester's evident discouragement at the prospect of the journey or\nabsence; he had often been away from Monkshaven for a longer time\nwithout seeming to care so much about it.\n\n'Well, yo' see it's a bit hard upon me for t' leave my sister--she\nas is t' widow-woman, wheere a put up when a'm at home. Things is\nmain an' dear; four-pound loaves is at sixteenpence; an' there's a\ndeal o' talk on a famine i' t' land; an' whaten a paid for my\nvictual an' t' bed i' t' lean-to helped t' oud woman a bit,--an'\nshe's sadly down i' t' mouth, for she cannot hear on a lodger for t'\ntak' my place, for a' she's moved o'er to t' other side o' t' bridge\nfor t' be nearer t' new buildings, an' t' grand new walk they're\nmakin' round t' cliffs, thinkin' she'd be likelier t' pick up a\nlabourer as would be glad on a bed near his work. A'd ha' liked to\nha' set her agait wi' a 'sponsible lodger afore a'd ha' left, for\nshe's just so soft-hearted, any scamp may put upon her if he nobbut\ngets houd on her blind side.'\n\n'Can I help her?' said Sylvia, in her eager way. 'I should be so\nglad; and I've a deal of money by me---'\n\n'Nay, my lass,' said Kester, 'thou munnot go off so fast; it were\njust what I were feared on i' tellin' thee. I've left her a bit o'\nmoney, and I'll mak' shift to send her more; it's just a kind word,\nt' keep up her heart when I'm gone, as I want. If thou'd step in and\nsee her fra' time to time, and cheer her up a bit wi' talkin' to her\non me, I'd tak' it very kind, and I'd go off wi' a lighter heart.'\n\n'Then I'm sure I'll do it for yo', Kester. I niver justly feel like\nmysel' when yo're away, for I'm lonesome enough at times. She and I\nwill talk a' t' better about yo' for both on us grieving after yo'.'\n\nSo Kester took his leave, his mind set at ease by Sylvia's promise\nto go and see his sister pretty often during his absence in the\nNorth.\n\nBut Sylvia's habits were changed since she, as a girl at\nHaytersbank, liked to spend half her time in the open air, running\nout perpetually without anything on to scatter crumbs to the\npoultry, or to take a piece of bread to the old cart-horse, to go up\nto the garden for a handful of herbs, or to clamber to the highest\npoint around to blow the horn which summoned her father and Kester\nhome to dinner. Living in a town where it was necessary to put on\nhat and cloak before going out into the street, and then to walk in\na steady and decorous fashion, she had only cared to escape down to\nthe freedom of the sea-shore until Philip went away; and after that\ntime she had learnt so to fear observation as a deserted wife, that\nnothing but Bella's health would have been a sufficient motive to\ntake her out of doors. And, as she had told Kester, the necessity of\ngiving the little girl a daily walk was very much lightened by the\ngreat love and affection which Jeremiah Foster now bore to the\nchild. Ever since the day when the baby had come to his knee,\nallured by the temptation of his watch, he had apparently considered\nher as in some sort belonging to him; and now he had almost come to\nthink that he had a right to claim her as his companion in his walk\nback from the Bank to his early dinner, where a high chair was\nalways placed ready for the chance of her coming to share his meal.\nOn these occasions he generally brought her back to the shop-door\nwhen he returned to his afternoon's work at the Bank. Sometimes,\nhowever, he would leave word that she was to be sent for from his\nhouse in the New Town, as his business at the Bank for that day was\nended. Then Sylvia was compelled to put on her things, and fetch\nback her darling; and excepting for this errand she seldom went out\nat all on week-days.\n\nAbout a fortnight after Kester's farewell call, this need for her\nvisit to Jeremiah Foster's arose; and it seemed to Sylvia that there\ncould not be a better opportunity of fulfilling her promise and\ngoing to see the widow Dobson, whose cottage was on the other side\nof the river, low down on the cliff-side, just at the bend and rush\nof the full stream into the open sea. She set off pretty early in\norder to go there first. She found the widow with her house-place\ntidied up after the midday meal, and busy knitting at the open\ndoor--not looking at her rapid-clicking needles, but gazing at the\nrush and recession of the waves before her; yet not seeing them\neither,--rather seeing days long past.\n\nShe started into active civility as soon as she recognized Sylvia,\nwho was to her as a great lady, never having known Sylvia Robson in\nher wild childish days. Widow Dobson was always a little scandalized\nat her brother Christopher's familiarity with Mrs. Hepburn.\n\nShe dusted a chair which needed no dusting, and placed it for\nSylvia, sitting down herself on a three-legged stool to mark her\nsense of the difference in their conditions, for there was another\nchair or two in the humble dwelling; and then the two fell into\ntalk--first about Kester, whom his sister would persist in calling\nChristopher, as if his dignity as her elder brother was compromised\nby any familiar abbreviation; and by-and-by she opened her heart a\nlittle more.\n\n'A could wish as a'd learned write-of-hand,' said she; 'for a've\nthat for to tell Christopher as might set his mind at ease. But yo'\nsee, if a wrote him a letter he couldn't read it; so a just comfort\nmysel' wi' thinkin' nobody need learn writin' unless they'n got\nfriends as can read. But a reckon he'd ha' been glad to hear as a've\ngetten a lodger.' Here she nodded her head in the direction of the\ndoor opening out of the house-place into the 'lean-to', which Sylvia\nhad observed on drawing near the cottage, and the recollection of\nthe mention of which by Kester had enabled her to identify widow\nDobson's dwelling. 'He's a-bed yonder,' the latter continued,\ndropping her voice. 'He's a queer-lookin' tyke, but a don't think as\nhe's a bad un.'\n\n'When did he come?' said Sylvia, remembering Kester's account of his\nsister's character, and feeling as though it behoved her, as\nKester's confidante on this head, to give cautious and prudent\nadvice.\n\n'Eh! a matter of a s'ennight ago. A'm noane good at mindin' time;\nhe's paid me his rent twice, but then he were keen to pay aforehand.\nHe'd comed in one night, an' sate him down afore he could speak, he\nwere so done up; he'd been on tramp this many a day, a reckon. \"Can\nyo' give me a bed?\" says he, panting like, after a bit. \"A chap as a\nmet near here says as yo've a lodging for t' let.\" \"Ay,\" says a, \"a\nha' that; but yo' mun pay me a shilling a week for 't.\" Then my mind\nmisgive me, for a thought he hadn't a shilling i' t' world, an' yet\nif he hadn't, a should just ha' gi'en him t' bed a' t' same: a'm not\none as can turn a dog out if he comes t' me wearied o' his life. So\nhe outs wi' a shillin', an' lays it down on t' table, 'bout a word.\n\"A'll not trouble yo' long,\" says he. \"A'm one as is best out o' t'\nworld,\" he says. Then a thought as a'd been a bit hard upon him. An'\nsays I, \"A'm a widow-woman, and one as has getten but few friends:\"\nfor yo' see a were low about our Christopher's goin' away north; \"so\na'm forced-like to speak hard to folk; but a've made mysel' some\nstirabout for my supper; and if yo'd like t' share an' share about\nwi' me, it's but puttin' a sup more watter to 't, and God's blessing\n'll be on 't, just as same as if 't were meal.\" So he ups wi' his\nhand afore his e'en, and says not a word. At last he says, \"Missus,\"\nsays he, \"can God's blessing be shared by a sinner--one o' t'\ndevil's children?\" says he. \"For the Scriptur' says he's t' father\no' lies.\" So a were puzzled-like; an' at length a says, \"Thou mun\nask t' parson that; a'm but a poor faint-hearted widow-woman; but\na've allays had God's blessing somehow, now a bethink me, an' a'll\nshare it wi' thee as far as my will goes.\" So he raxes his hand\nacross t' table, an' mutters summat, as he grips mine. A thought it\nwere Scriptur' as he said, but a'd needed a' my strength just then\nfor t' lift t' pot off t' fire--it were t' first vittle a'd tasted\nsin' morn, for t' famine comes down like stones on t' head o' us\npoor folk: an' a' a said were just \"Coom along, chap, an' fa' to;\nan' God's blessing be on him as eats most.\" An' sin' that day him\nand me's been as thick as thieves, only he's niver telled me nought\nof who he is, or wheere he comes fra'. But a think he's one o' them\npoor colliers, as has getten brunt i' t' coal-pits; for, t' be sure,\nhis face is a' black wi' fire-marks; an' o' late days he's ta'en t'\nhis bed, an' just lies there sighing,--for one can hear him plain as\ndayleet thro' t' bit partition wa'.'\n\nAs a proof of this, a sigh--almost a groan--startled the two women\nat this very moment.\n\n'Poor fellow!' said Sylvia, in a soft whisper. 'There's more sore\nhearts i' t' world than one reckons for!' But after a while, she\nbethought her again of Kester's account of his sister's 'softness';\nand she thought that it behoved her to give some good advice. So she\nadded, in a sterner, harder tone--'Still, yo' say yo' know nought\nabout him; and tramps is tramps a' t' world over; and yo're a widow,\nand it behoves yo' to be careful. I think I'd just send him off as\nsoon as he's a bit rested. Yo' say he's plenty o' money?'\n\n'Nay! A never said that. A know nought about it. He pays me\naforehand; an' he pays me down for whativer a've getten for him; but\nthat's but little; he's noane up t' his vittle, though a've made him\nsome broth as good as a could make 'em.'\n\n'I wouldn't send him away till he was well again, if I were yo; but\nI think yo'd be better rid on him,' said Sylvia. 'It would be\ndifferent if yo'r brother were in Monkshaven.' As she spoke she rose\nto go.\n\nWidow Dobson held her hand in hers for a minute, then the humble\nwoman said,--\n\n'Yo'll noane be vexed wi' me, missus, if a cannot find i' my heart\nt' turn him out till he wants to go hissel'? For a wouldn't like to\nvex yo', for Christopher's sake; but a know what it is for t' feel\nfor friendless folk, an' choose what may come on it, I cannot send\nhim away.'\n\n'No!' said Sylvia. 'Why should I be vexed? it's no business o' mine.\nOnly I should send him away if I was yo'. He might go lodge wheere\nthere was men-folk, who know t' ways o' tramps, and are up to them.'\n\nInto the sunshine went Sylvia. In the cold shadow the miserable\ntramp lay sighing. She did not know that she had been so near to him\ntowards whom her heart was softening, day by day.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLIV\n\nFIRST WORDS\n\n\nIt was the spring of 1800. Old people yet can tell of the hard\nfamine of that year. The harvest of the autumn before had failed;\nthe war and the corn laws had brought the price of corn up to a\nfamine rate; and much of what came into the market was unsound, and\nconsequently unfit for food, yet hungry creatures bought it eagerly,\nand tried to cheat disease by mixing the damp, sweet, clammy flour\nwith rice or potato meal. Rich families denied themselves pastry and\nall unnecessary and luxurious uses of wheat in any shape; the duty\non hair-powder was increased; and all these palliatives were but as\ndrops in the ocean of the great want of the people.\n\nPhilip, in spite of himself, recovered and grew stronger; and as he\ngrew stronger hunger took the place of loathing dislike to food. But\nhis money was all spent; and what was his poor pension of sixpence a\nday in that terrible year of famine? Many a summer's night he walked\nfor hours and hours round the house which once was his, which might\nbe his now, with all its homely, blessed comforts, could he but go\nand assert his right to it. But to go with authority, and in his\npoor, maimed guise assert that right, he had need be other than\nPhilip Hepburn. So he stood in the old shelter of the steep, crooked\nlane opening on to the hill out of the market-place, and watched the\nsoft fading of the summer's eve into night; the closing of the once\nfamiliar shop; the exit of good, comfortable William Coulson, going\nto his own home, his own wife, his comfortable, plentiful supper.\nThen Philip--there were no police in those days, and scarcely an old\nwatchman in that primitive little town--would go round on the shady\nsides of streets, and, quickly glancing about him, cross the bridge,\nlooking on the quiet, rippling stream, the gray shimmer foretelling\nthe coming dawn over the sea, the black masts and rigging of the\nstill vessels against the sky; he could see with his wistful, eager\neyes the shape of the windows--the window of the very room in which\nhis wife and child slept, unheeding of him, the hungry,\nbroken-hearted outcast. He would go back to his lodging, and softly\nlift the latch of the door; still more softly, but never without an\nunspoken, grateful prayer, pass by the poor sleeping woman who had\ngiven him a shelter and her share of God's blessing--she who, like\nhim, knew not the feeling of satisfied hunger; and then he laid him\ndown on the narrow pallet in the lean-to, and again gave Sylvia\nhappy lessons in the kitchen at Haytersbank, and the dead were\nalive; and Charley Kinraid, the specksioneer, had never come to\ntrouble the hopeful, gentle peace.\n\nFor widow Dobson had never taken Sylvia's advice. The tramp known to\nher by the name of Freeman--that in which he received his\npension--lodged with her still, and paid his meagre shilling in\nadvance, weekly. A shilling was meagre in those hard days of\nscarcity. A hungry man might easily eat the produce of a shilling in\na day.\n\nWidow Dobson pleaded this to Sylvia as an excuse for keeping her\nlodger on; to a more calculating head it might have seemed a reason\nfor sending him away.\n\n'Yo' see, missus,' said she, apologetically, to Sylvia, one evening,\nas the latter called upon the poor widow before going to fetch\nlittle Bella (it was now too hot for the child to cross the bridge\nin the full heat of the summer sun, and Jeremiah would take her up\nto her supper instead)--'Yo' see, missus, there's not a many as 'ud\ntake him in for a shillin' when it goes so little way; or if they\ndid, they'd take it out on him some other way, an' he's not getten\nmuch else, a reckon. He ca's me granny, but a'm vast mista'en if\nhe's ten year younger nor me; but he's getten a fine appetite of his\nown, choose how young he may be; an' a can see as he could eat a\ndeal more nor he's getten money to buy, an' it's few as can mak'\nvictual go farther nor me. Eh, missus, but yo' may trust me a'll\nsend him off when times is better; but just now it would be sendin'\nhim to his death; for a ha' plenty and to spare, thanks be to God\nan' yo'r bonny face.'\n\nSo Sylvia had to be content with the knowledge that the money she\ngladly gave to Kester's sister went partly to feed the lodger who\nwas neither labourer nor neighbour, but only just a tramp, who, she\nfeared, was preying on the good old woman. Still the cruel famine\ncut sharp enough to penetrate all hearts; and Sylvia, an hour after\nthe conversation recorded above, was much touched, on her return\nfrom Jeremiah Foster's with the little merry, chattering Bella, at\nseeing the feeble steps of one, whom she knew by description must be\nwidow Dobson's lodger, turn up from the newly-cut road which was to\nlead to the terrace walk around the North Cliff, a road which led to\nno dwelling but widow Dobson's. Tramp, and vagrant, he might be in\nthe eyes of the law; but, whatever his character, Sylvia could see\nhim before her in the soft dusk, creeping along, over the bridge,\noften stopping to rest and hold by some support, and then going on\nagain towards the town, to which she and happy little Bella were\nwending.\n\nA thought came over her: she had always fancied that this unknown\nman was some fierce vagabond, and had dreaded lest in the lonely bit\nof road between widow Dobson's cottage and the peopled highway, he\nshould fall upon her and rob her if he learnt that she had money\nwith her; and several times she had gone away without leaving the\nlittle gift she had intended, because she imagined that she had seen\nthe door of the small chamber in the 'lean-to' open softly while she\nwas there, as if the occupant (whom widow Dobson spoke of as never\nleaving the house before dusk, excepting once a week) were listening\nfor the chink of the coin in her little leathern purse. Now that she\nsaw him walking before her with heavy languid steps, this fear gave\nplace to pity; she remembered her mother's gentle superstition which\nhad prevented her from ever sending the hungry empty away, for fear\nlest she herself should come to need bread.\n\n'Lassie,' said she to little Bella, who held a cake which Jeremiah's\nhousekeeper had given her tight in her hand, 'yon poor man theere is\nhungry; will Bella give him her cake, and mother will make her\nanother to-morrow twice as big?'\n\nFor this consideration, and with the feeling of satisfaction which a\ngood supper not an hour ago gives even to the hungry stomach of a\nchild of three years old, Bella, after some thought, graciously\nassented to the sacrifice.\n\nSylvia stopped, the cake in her hand, and turned her back to the\ntown, and to the slow wayfarer in front. Under the cover of her\nshawl she slipped a half-crown deep into the crumb of the cake, and\nthen restoring it to little Bella, she gave her her directions.\n\n'Mammy will carry Bella; and when Bella goes past the poor man, she\nshall give him the cake over mammy's shoulder. Poor man is so\nhungry; and Bella and mammy have plenty to eat, and to spare.'\n\nThe child's heart was touched by the idea of hunger, and her little\narm was outstretched ready for the moment her mother's hurried steps\ntook her brushing past the startled, trembling Philip.\n\n'Poor man, eat this; Bella not hungry.'\n\nThey were the first words he had ever heard his child utter. The\nechoes of them rang in his ears as he stood endeavouring to hide his\ndisfigured face by looking over the parapet of the bridge down upon\nthe stream running away towards the ocean, into which his hot tears\nslowly fell, unheeded by the weeper. Then he changed the intention\nwith which he had set out upon his nightly walk, and turned back to\nhis lodging.\n\nOf course the case was different with Sylvia; she would have\nforgotten the whole affair very speedily, if it had not been for\nlittle Bella's frequent recurrence to the story of the hungry man,\nwhich had touched her small sympathies with the sense of an\nintelligible misfortune. She liked to act the dropping of the bun\ninto the poor man's hand as she went past him, and would take up any\narticle near her in order to illustrate the gesture she had used.\nOne day she got hold of Hester's watch for this purpose, as being of\nthe same round shape as the cake; and though Hester, for whose\nbenefit the child was repeating the story in her broken language for\nthe third or fourth time, tried to catch the watch as it was\nintended that she should (she being the representative of the\n'hungry man' for the time being), it went to the ground with a smash\nthat frightened the little girl, and she began to cry at the\nmischief she had done.\n\n'Don't cry, Bella,' said Hester. 'Niver play with watches again. I\ndidn't see thee at mine, or I'd ha' stopped thee in time. But I'll\ntake it to old Darley's on th' quay-side, and maybe he'll soon set\nit to rights again. Only Bella must niver play with watches again.'\n\n'Niver no more!' promised the little sobbing child. And that evening\nHester took her watch down to old Darley's.\n\nThis William Darley was the brother of the gardener at the rectory;\nthe uncle to the sailor who had been shot by the press-gang years\nbefore, and to his bed-ridden sister. He was a clever mechanician,\nand his skill as a repairer of watches and chronometers was great\namong the sailors, with whom he did a very irregular sort of\ntraffic, conducted, often without much use of money, but rather on\nthe principle of barter, they bringing him foreign coins and odd\ncuriosities picked up on their travels in exchange for his services\nto their nautical instruments or their watches. If he had ever had\ncapital to extend his business, he might have been a rich man; but\nit is to be doubted whether he would have been as happy as he was\nnow in his queer little habitation of two rooms, the front one being\nboth shop and workshop, the other serving the double purpose of\nbedroom and museum.\n\nThe skill of this odd-tempered, shabby old man was sometimes sought\nby the jeweller who kept the more ostentatious shop in the High\nStreet; but before Darley would undertake any 'tickle' piece of\ndelicate workmanship for the other, he sneered at his ignorance, and\ntaunted and abused him well. Yet he had soft places in his heart,\nand Hester Rose had found her way to one by her patient, enduring\nkindness to his bed-ridden niece. He never snarled at her as he did\nat too many; and on the few occasions when she had asked him to do\nanything for her, he had seemed as if she were conferring the favour\non him, not he on her, and only made the smallest possible charge.\n\nShe found him now sitting where he could catch the most light for\nhis work, spectacles on nose, and microscope in hand.\n\nHe took her watch, and examined it carefully without a word in reply\nto her. Then he began to open it and take it to pieces, in order to\nascertain the nature of the mischief.\n\nSuddenly he heard her catch her breath with a checked sound of\nsurprise. He looked at her from above his spectacles; she was\nholding a watch in her hand which she had just taken up off the\ncounter.\n\n'What's amiss wi' thee now?' said Darley. 'Hast ta niver seen a\nwatch o' that mak' afore? or is it them letters on t' back, as is so\nwonderful?'\n\nYes, it was those letters--that interlaced, old-fashioned cipher.\nThat Z. H. that she knew of old stood for Zachary Hepburn, Philip's\nfather. She knew how Philip valued this watch. She remembered having\nseen it in his hands the very day before his disappearance, when he\nwas looking at the time in his annoyance at Sylvia's detention in\nher walk with baby. Hester had no doubt that he had taken this watch\nas a matter of course away with him. She felt sure that he would not\npart with this relic of his dead father on any slight necessity.\nWhere, then, was Philip?--by what chance of life or death had this,\nhis valued property, found its way once more to Monkshaven?\n\n'Where did yo' get this?' she asked, in as quiet a manner as she\ncould assume, sick with eagerness as she was.\n\nTo no one else would Darley have answered such a question. He made a\nmystery of most of his dealings; not that he had anything to\nconceal, but simply because he delighted in concealment. He took it\nout of her hands, looked at the number marked inside, and the\nmaker's name--'Natteau Gent, York'--and then replied,--\n\n'A man brought it me yesterday, at nightfall, for t' sell it. It's a\nmatter o' forty years old. Natteau Gent has been dead and in his\ngrave pretty nigh as long as that. But he did his work well when he\nwere alive; and so I gave him as brought it for t' sell about as\nmuch as it were worth, i' good coin. A tried him first i' t'\nbartering line, but he wouldn't bite; like enough he wanted\nfood,--many a one does now-a-days.'\n\n'Who was he?' gasped Hester.\n\n'Bless t' woman! how should I know?'\n\n'What was he like?--how old?--tell me.'\n\n'My lass, a've summut else to do wi' my eyes than go peering into\nmen's faces i' t' dusk light.'\n\n'But yo' must have had light for t' judge about the watch.'\n\n'Eh! how sharp we are! A'd a candle close to my nose. But a didn't\ntak' it up for to gaze int' his face. That wouldn't be manners, to\nmy thinking.'\n\nHester was silent. Then Darley's heart relented.\n\n'If yo're so set upo' knowing who t' fellow was, a could, mebbe, put\nyo' on his tracks.'\n\n'How?' said Hester, eagerly. 'I do want to know. I want to know very\nmuch, and for a good reason.'\n\n'Well, then, a'll tell yo'. He's a queer tyke, that one is. A'll be\nbound he were sore pressed for t' brass; yet he out's wi' a good\nhalf-crown, all wrapped up i' paper, and he axes me t' make a hole\nin it. Says I, \"It's marring good king's coin, at after a've made a\nhole in't, it'll never pass current again.\" So he mumbles, and\nmumbles, but for a' that it must needs be done; and he's left it\nhere, and is t' call for 't to-morrow at e'en.'\n\n'Oh, William Darley!' said Hester, clasping her hands tight\ntogether. 'Find out who he is, where he is--anything--everything\nabout him--and I will so bless yo'.'\n\nDarley looked at her sharply, but with some signs of sympathy on his\ngrave face. 'My woman,' he said 'a could ha' wished as you'd niver\nseen t' watch. It's poor, thankless work thinking too much on one o'\nGod's creatures. But a'll do thy bidding,' he continued, in a\nlighter and different tone. 'A'm a 'cute old badger when need be.\nCome for thy watch in a couple o' days, and a'll tell yo' all as\na've learnt.'\n\nSo Hester went away, her heart beating with the promise of knowing\nsomething about Philip,--how much, how little, in these first\nmoments, she dared not say even to herself. Some sailor newly landed\nfrom distant seas might have become possessed of Philip's watch in\nfar-off latitudes; in which case, Philip would be dead. That might\nbe. She tried to think that this was the most probable way of\naccounting for the watch. She could be certain as to the positive\nidentity of the watch--being in William Darley's possession. Again,\nit might be that Philip himself was near at hand--was here in this\nvery place--starving, as too many were, for insufficiency of means\nto buy the high-priced food. And then her heart burnt within her as\nshe thought of the succulent, comfortable meals which Sylvia\nprovided every day--nay, three times a day--for the household in the\nmarket-place, at the head of which Philip ought to have been; but\nhis place knew him not. For Sylvia had inherited her mother's talent\nfor housekeeping, and on her, in Alice's decrepitude and Hester's\nother occupations in the shop, devolved the cares of due provision\nfor the somewhat heterogeneous family.\n\nAnd Sylvia! Hester groaned in heart over the remembrance of Sylvia's\nwords, 'I can niver forgive him the wrong he did to me,' that night\nwhen Hester had come, and clung to her, making the sad, shameful\nconfession of her unreturned love.\n\nWhat could ever bring these two together again? Could Hester\nherself--ignorant of the strange mystery of Sylvia's heart, as those\nwho are guided solely by obedience to principle must ever be of the\nclue to the actions of those who are led by the passionate ebb and\nflow of impulse? Could Hester herself? Oh! how should she speak, how\nshould she act, if Philip were near--if Philip were sad and in\nmiserable estate? Her own misery at this contemplation of the case\nwas too great to bear; and she sought her usual refuge in the\nthought of some text, some promise of Scripture, which should\nstrengthen her faith.\n\n'With God all things are possible,' said she, repeating the words as\nthough to lull her anxiety to rest.\n\nYes; with God all things are possible. But ofttimes He does his work\nwith awful instruments. There is a peacemaker whose name is Death.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLV\n\nSAVED AND LOST\n\n\nHester went out on the evening of the day after that on which the\nunknown owner of the half-crown had appointed to call for it again\nat William Darley's. She had schooled herself to believe that time\nand patience would serve her best. Her plan was to obtain all the\nknowledge about Philip that she could in the first instance; and\nthen, if circumstances allowed it, as in all probability they would,\nto let drop by drop of healing, peacemaking words and thoughts fall\non Sylvia's obdurate, unforgiving heart. So Hester put on her\nthings, and went out down towards the old quay-side on that evening\nafter the shop was closed.\n\nPoor little Sylvia! She was unforgiving, but not obdurate to the full\nextent of what Hester believed. Many a time since Philip went away\nhad she unconsciously missed his protecting love; when folks spoke\nshortly to her, when Alice scolded her as one of the non-elect, when\nHester's gentle gravity had something of severity in it; when her\nown heart failed her as to whether her mother would have judged that\nshe had done well, could that mother have known all, as possibly she\ndid by this time. Philip had never spoken otherwise than tenderly to\nher during the eighteen months of their married life, except on the\ntwo occasions before recorded: once when she referred to her dream\nof Kinraid's possible return, and once again on the evening of the\nday before her discovery of his concealment of the secret of\nKinraid's involuntary disappearance.\n\nAfter she had learnt that Kinraid was married, her heart had still\nmore strongly turned to Philip; she thought that he had judged\nrightly in what he had given as the excuse for his double dealing;\nshe was even more indignant at Kinraid's fickleness than she had any\nreason to be; and she began to learn the value of such enduring love\nas Philip's had been--lasting ever since the days when she first\nbegan to fancy what a man's love for a woman should be, when she had\nfirst shrunk from the tone of tenderness he put into his especial\nterm for her, a girl of twelve--'Little lassie,' as he was wont to\ncall her.\n\nBut across all this relenting came the shadow of her vow--like the\nchill of a great cloud passing over a sunny plain. How should she\ndecide? what would be her duty, if he came again, and once more\ncalled her 'wife'? She shrank from such a possibility with all the\nweakness and superstition of her nature; and this it was which made\nher strengthen herself with the re-utterance of unforgiving words;\nand shun all recurrence to the subject on the rare occasion when\nHester had tried to bring it back, with a hope of softening the\nheart which to her appeared altogether hardened on this one point.\n\nNow, on this bright summer evening, while Hester had gone down to\nthe quay-side, Sylvia stood with her out-of-door things on in the\nparlour, rather impatiently watching the sky, full of hurrying\nclouds, and flushing with the warm tints of the approaching sunset.\nShe could not leave Alice: the old woman had grown so infirm that\nshe was never left by her daughter and Sylvia at the same time; yet\nSylvia had to fetch her little girl from the New Town, where she had\nbeen to her supper at Jeremiah Foster's. Hester had said that she\nshould not be away more than a quarter of an hour; and Hester was\ngenerally so punctual that any failure of hers, in this respect,\nappeared almost in the light of an injury on those who had learnt to\nrely upon her. Sylvia wanted to go and see widow Dobson, and learn\nwhen Kester might be expected home. His two months were long past;\nand Sylvia had heard through the Fosters of some suitable and\nprofitable employment for him, of which she thought he would be glad\nto know as soon as possible. It was now some time since she had been\nable to get so far as across the bridge; and, for aught she knew,\nKester might already be come back from his expedition to the\nCheviots. Kester was come back. Scarce five minutes had elapsed\nafter these thoughts had passed through her mind before his hasty\nhand lifted the latch of the kitchen-door, his hurried steps brought\nhim face to face with her. The smile of greeting was arrested on her\nlips by one look at him: his eyes staring wide, the expression on\nhis face wild, and yet pitiful.\n\n'That's reet,' said he, seeing that her things were already on.\n'Thou're wanted sore. Come along.'\n\n'Oh! dear God! my child!' cried Sylvia, clutching at the chair near\nher; but recovering her eddying senses with the strong fact before\nher that whatever the terror was, she was needed to combat it.\n\n'Ay; thy child!' said Kester, taking her almost roughly by the arm,\nand drawing her away with him out through the open doors on to the\nquay-side.\n\n'Tell me!' said Sylvia, faintly, 'is she dead?'\n\n'She's safe now,' said Kester. 'It's not her--it's him as saved her\nas needs yo', if iver husband needed a wife.'\n\n'He?--who? O Philip! Philip! is it yo' at last?'\n\nUnheeding what spectators might see her movements, she threw up her\narms and staggered against the parapet of the bridge they were then\ncrossing.\n\n'He!--Philip!--saved Bella? Bella, our little Bella, as got her\ndinner by my side, and went out wi' Jeremiah, as well as could be. I\ncannot take it in; tell me, Kester.' She kept trembling so much in\nvoice and in body, that he saw she could not stir without danger of\nfalling until she was calmed; as it was, her eyes became filmy from\ntime to time, and she drew her breath in great heavy pants, leaning\nall the while against the wall of the bridge.\n\n'It were no illness,' Kester began. 'T' little un had gone for a\nwalk wi' Jeremiah Foster, an' he were drawn for to go round t' edge\no' t' cliff, wheere they's makin' t' new walk reet o'er t' sea. But\nit's but a bit on a pathway now; an' t' one was too oud, an' t'\nother too young for t' see t' water comin' along wi' great leaps;\nit's allays for comin' high up again' t' cliff, an' this spring-tide\nit's comin' in i' terrible big waves. Some one said as they passed\nt' man a-sittin' on a bit on a rock up above--a dunnot know, a only\nknow as a heared a great fearful screech i' t' air. A were just\na-restin' me at after a'd comed in, not half an hour i' t' place.\nA've walked better nor a dozen mile to-day; an' a ran out, an' a\nlooked, an' just on t' walk, at t' turn, was t' swish of a wave\nrunnin' back as quick as t' mischief int' t' sea, an' oud Jeremiah\nstandin' like one crazy, lookin' o'er int' t' watter; an' like a\nstroke o' leeghtnin' comes a man, an' int' t' very midst o' t' great\nwaves like a shot; an' then a knowed summut were in t' watter as\nwere nearer death than life; an' a seemed to misdoubt me that it\nwere our Bella; an' a shouts an' a cries for help, an' a goes mysel'\nto t' very edge o' t' cliff, an' a bids oud Jeremiah, as was like\none beside hissel', houd tight on me, for he were good for nought\nelse; an' a bides my time, an' when a sees two arms houdin' out a\nlittle drippin' streamin' child, a clutches her by her waist-band,\nan' hauls her to land. She's noane t' worse for her bath, a'll be\nbound.'\n\n'I mun go--let me,' said Sylvia, struggling with his detaining hand,\nwhich he had laid upon her in the fear that she would slip down to\nthe ground in a faint, so ashen-gray was her face. 'Let me,--Bella,\nI mun go see her.'\n\nHe let go, and she stood still, suddenly feeling herself too weak to\nstir.\n\n'Now, if you'll try a bit to be quiet, a'll lead yo' along; but yo'\nmun be a steady and brave lass.'\n\n'I'll be aught if yo' only let me see Bella,' said Sylvia, humbly.\n\n'An' yo' niver ax at after him as saved her,' said Kester,\nreproachfully.\n\n'I know it's Philip,' she whispered, 'and yo' said he wanted me; so\nI know he's safe; and, Kester, I think I'm 'feared on him, and I'd\nlike to gather courage afore seeing him, and a look at Bella would\ngive me courage. It were a terrible time when I saw him last, and I\ndid say--'\n\n'Niver think on what thou did say; think on what thou will say to\nhim now, for he lies a-dyin'! He were dashed again t' cliff an'\nbruised sore in his innards afore t' men as come wi' a boat could\npick him up.'\n\nShe did not speak; she did not even tremble now; she set her teeth\ntogether, and, holding tight by Kester, she urged him on; but when\nthey came to the end of the bridge, she seemed uncertain which way\nto turn.\n\n'This way,' said Kester. 'He's been lodgin' wi' Sally this nine\nweek, an' niver a one about t' place as knowed him; he's been i' t'\nwars an' getten his face brunt.'\n\n'And he was short o' food,' moaned Sylvia, 'and we had plenty, and I\ntried to make yo'r sister turn him out, and send him away. Oh! will\nGod iver forgive me?'\n\nMuttering to herself, breaking her mutterings with sharp cries of\npain, Sylvia, with Kester's help, reached widow Dobson's house. It\nwas no longer a quiet, lonely dwelling. Several sailors stood about\nthe door, awaiting, in silent anxiety, for the verdict of the\ndoctor, who was even now examining Philip's injuries. Two or three\nwomen stood talking eagerly, in low voices, in the doorway.\n\nBut when Sylvia drew near the men fell back; and the women moved\naside as though to allow her to pass, all looking upon her with a\ncertain amount of sympathy, but perhaps with rather more of\nantagonistic wonder as to how she was taking it--she who had been\nliving in ease and comfort while her husband's shelter was little\nbetter than a hovel, her husband's daily life a struggle with\nstarvation; for so much of the lodger at widow Dobson's was\npopularly known; and any distrust of him as a stranger and a tramp\nwas quite forgotten now.\n\nSylvia felt the hardness of their looks, the hardness of their\nsilence; but it was as nothing to her. If such things could have\ntouched her at this moment, she would not have stood still right in\nthe midst of their averted hearts, and murmured something to Kester.\nHe could not hear the words uttered by that hoarse choked voice,\nuntil he had stooped down and brought his ear to the level of her\nmouth.\n\n'We'd better wait for t' doctors to come out,' she said again. She\nstood by the door, shivering all over, almost facing the people in\nthe road, but with her face turned a little to the right, so that\nthey thought she was looking at the pathway on the cliff-side, a\nhundred yards or so distant, below which the hungry waves still\nlashed themselves into high ascending spray; while nearer to the\ncottage, where their force was broken by the bar at the entrance to\nthe river, they came softly lapping up the shelving shore.\n\nSylvia saw nothing of all this, though it was straight before her\neyes. She only saw a blurred mist; she heard no sound of waters,\nthough it filled the ears of those around. Instead she heard low\nwhispers pronouncing Philip's earthly doom.\n\nFor the doctors were both agreed; his internal injury was of a\nmortal kind, although, as the spine was severely injured above the\nseat of the fatal bruise, he had no pain in the lower half of his\nbody.\n\nThey had spoken in so low a tone that John Foster, standing only a\nfoot or so away, had not been able to hear their words. But Sylvia\nheard each syllable there where she stood outside, shivering all\nover in the sultry summer evening. She turned round to Kester.\n\n'I mun go to him, Kester; thou'll see that noane come in to us, when\nt' doctors come out.'\n\nShe spoke in a soft, calm voice; and he, not knowing what she had\nheard, made some easy conditional promise. Then those opposite to\nthe cottage door fell back, for they could see the grave doctors\ncoming out, and John Foster, graver, sadder still, following them.\nWithout a word to them,--without a word even of inquiry--which many\noutside thought and spoke of as strange--white-faced, dry-eyed\nSylvia slipped into the house out of their sight.\n\nAnd the waves kept lapping on the shelving shore.\n\nThe room inside was dark, all except the little halo or circle of\nlight made by a dip candle. Widow Dobson had her back to the\nbed--her bed--on to which Philip had been borne in the hurry of\nterror as to whether he was alive or whether he was dead. She was\ncrying--crying quietly, but the tears down-falling fast, as, with\nher back to the lowly bed, she was gathering up the dripping clothes\ncut off from the poor maimed body by the doctors' orders. She only\nshook her head as she saw Sylvia, spirit-like, steal in--white,\nnoiseless, and upborne from earth.\n\nBut noiseless as her step might be, he heard, he recognized, and\nwith a sigh he turned his poor disfigured face to the wall, hiding\nit in the shadow.\n\nHe knew that she was by him; that she had knelt down by his bed;\nthat she was kissing his hand, over which the languor of approaching\ndeath was stealing. But no one spoke.\n\nAt length he said, his face still averted, speaking with an effort.\n\n'Little lassie, forgive me now! I cannot live to see the morn!'\n\nThere was no answer, only a long miserable sigh, and he felt her\nsoft cheek laid upon his hand, and the quiver that ran through her\nwhole body.\n\n'I did thee a cruel wrong,' he said, at length. 'I see it now. But\nI'm a dying man. I think that God will forgive me--and I've sinned\nagainst Him; try, lassie--try, my Sylvie--will not thou forgive me?'\n\nHe listened intently for a moment. He heard through the open window\nthe waves lapping on the shelving shore. But there came no word from\nher; only that same long shivering, miserable sigh broke from her\nlips at length.\n\n'Child,' said he, once more. 'I ha' made thee my idol; and if I\ncould live my life o'er again I would love my God more, and thee\nless; and then I shouldn't ha' sinned this sin against thee. But\nspeak one word of love to me--one little word, that I may know I\nhave thy pardon.'\n\n'Oh, Philip! Philip!' she moaned, thus adjured.\n\nThen she lifted her head, and said,\n\n'Them were wicked, wicked words, as I said; and a wicked vow as I\nvowed; and Lord God Almighty has ta'en me at my word. I'm sorely\npunished, Philip, I am indeed.'\n\nHe pressed her hand, he stroked her cheek. But he asked for yet\nanother word.\n\n'I did thee a wrong. In my lying heart I forgot to do to thee as I\nwould have had thee to do to me. And I judged Kinraid in my heart.'\n\n'Thou thought as he was faithless and fickle,' she answered quickly;\n'and so he were. He were married to another woman not so many weeks\nat after thou went away. Oh, Philip, Philip! and now I have thee\nback, and--'\n\n'Dying' was the word she would have said, but first the dread of\ntelling him what she believed he did not know, and next her\npassionate sobs, choked her.\n\n'I know,' said he, once more stroking her cheek, and soothing her\nwith gentle, caressing hand. 'Little lassie!' he said, after a while\nwhen she was quiet from very exhaustion, 'I niver thought to be so\nhappy again. God is very merciful.'\n\nShe lifted up her head, and asked wildly, 'Will He iver forgive me,\nthink yo'? I drove yo' out fra' yo'r home, and sent yo' away to t'\nwars, wheere yo' might ha' getten yo'r death; and when yo' come\nback, poor and lone, and weary, I told her for t' turn yo' out, for\na' I knew yo' must be starving in these famine times. I think I\nshall go about among them as gnash their teeth for iver, while yo'\nare wheere all tears are wiped away.'\n\n'No!' said Philip, turning round his face, forgetful of himself in\nhis desire to comfort her. 'God pities us as a father pities his\npoor wandering children; the nearer I come to death the clearer I\nsee Him. But you and me have done wrong to each other; yet we can\nsee now how we were led to it; we can pity and forgive one another.\nI'm getting low and faint, lassie; but thou must remember this: God\nknows more, and is more forgiving than either you to me, or me to\nyou. I think and do believe as we shall meet together before His\nface; but then I shall ha' learnt to love thee second to Him; not\nfirst, as I have done here upon the earth.'\n\nThen he was silent--very still. Sylvia knew--widow Dobson had\nbrought it in--that there was some kind of medicine, sent by the\nhopeless doctors, lying upon the table hard by, and she softly rose\nand poured it out and dropped it into the half-open mouth. Then she\nknelt down again, holding the hand feebly stretched out to her, and\nwatching the faint light in the wistful loving eyes. And in the\nstillness she heard the ceaseless waves lapping against the shelving\nshore.\n\nSomething like an hour before this time, which was the deepest\nmidnight of the summer's night, Hester Rose had come hurrying up the\nroad to where Kester and his sister sate outside the open door,\nkeeping their watch under the star-lit sky, all others having gone\naway, one by one, even John and Jeremiah Foster having returned to\ntheir own house, where the little Bella lay, sleeping a sound and\nhealthy slumber after her perilous adventure.\n\nHester had heard but little from William Darley as to the owner of\nthe watch and the half-crown; but he was chagrined at the failure of\nall his skilful interrogations to elicit the truth, and promised her\nfurther information in a few days, with all the more vehemence\nbecause he was unaccustomed to be baffled. And Hester had again\nwhispered to herself 'Patience! Patience!' and had slowly returned\nback to her home to find that Sylvia had left it, why she did not at\nonce discover. But, growing uneasy as the advancing hours neither\nbrought Sylvia nor little Bella to their home, she had set out for\nJeremiah Foster's as soon as she had seen her mother comfortably\nasleep in her bed; and then she had learnt the whole story, bit by\nbit, as each person who spoke broke in upon the previous narration\nwith some new particular. But from no one did she clearly learn\nwhether Sylvia was with her husband, or not; and so she came\nspeeding along the road, breathless, to where Kester sate in\nwakeful, mournful silence, his sister's sleeping head lying on his\nshoulder, the cottage door open, both for air and that there might\nbe help within call if needed; and the dim slanting oblong of the\ninterior light lying across the road.\n\nHester came panting up, too agitated and breathless to ask how much\nwas truth of the fatal, hopeless tale which she had heard. Kester\nlooked at her without a word. Through this solemn momentary silence\nthe lapping of the ceaseless waves was heard, as they came up close\non the shelving shore.\n\n'He? Philip?' said she. Kester shook his head sadly.\n\n'And his wife--Sylvia?' said Hester.\n\n'In there with him, alone,' whispered Kester.\n\nHester turned away, and wrung her hands together.\n\n'Oh, Lord God Almighty!' said she, 'was I not even worthy to bring\nthem together at last?' And she went away slowly and heavily back to\nthe side of her sleeping mother. But 'Thy will be done' was on her\nquivering lips before she lay down to her rest.\n\nThe soft gray dawn lightens the darkness of a midsummer night soon\nafter two o'clock. Philip watched it come, knowing that it was his\nlast sight of day,--as we reckon days on earth.\n\nHe had been often near death as a soldier; once or twice, as when he\nrushed into fire to save Kinraid, his chances of life had been as\none to a hundred; but yet he had had a chance. But now there was the\nnew feeling--the last new feeling which we shall any of us\nexperience in this world--that death was not only close at hand,\nbut inevitable.\n\nHe felt its numbness stealing up him--stealing up him. But the head\nwas clear, the brain more than commonly active in producing vivid\nimpressions.\n\nIt seemed but yesterday since he was a little boy at his mother's\nknee, wishing with all the earnestness of his childish heart to be\nlike Abraham, who was called the friend of God, or David, who was\nsaid to be the man after God's own heart, or St John, who was called\n'the Beloved.' As very present seemed the day on which he made\nresolutions of trying to be like them; it was in the spring, and\nsome one had brought in cowslips; and the scent of those flowers was\nin his nostrils now, as he lay a-dying--his life ended, his battles\nfought, his time for 'being good' over and gone--the opportunity,\nonce given in all eternity, past.\n\nAll the temptations that had beset him rose clearly before him; the\nscenes themselves stood up in their solid materialism--he could have\ntouched the places; the people, the thoughts, the arguments that\nSatan had urged in behalf of sin, were reproduced with the vividness\nof a present time. And he knew that the thoughts were illusions, the\narguments false and hollow; for in that hour came the perfect vision\nof the perfect truth: he saw the 'way to escape' which had come\nalong with the temptation; now, the strong resolve of an ardent\nboyhood, with all a life before it to show the world 'what a\nChristian might be'; and then the swift, terrible now, when his\nnaked, guilty soul shrank into the shadow of God's mercy-seat, out\nof the blaze of His anger against all those who act a lie.\n\nHis mind was wandering, and he plucked it back. Was this death in\nvery deed? He tried to grasp at the present, the earthly present,\nfading quick away. He lay there on the bed--on Sally Dobson's bed in\nthe house-place, not on his accustomed pallet in the lean-to. He\nknew that much. And the door was open into the still, dusk night;\nand through the open casement he could hear the lapping of the waves\non the shelving shore, could see the soft gray dawn over the sea--he\nknew it was over the sea--he saw what lay unseen behind the poor\nwalls of the cottage. And it was Sylvia who held his hand tight in\nher warm, living grasp; it was his wife whose arm was thrown around\nhim, whose sobbing sighs shook his numbed frame from time to time.\n\n'God bless and comfort my darling,' he said to himself. 'She knows\nme now. All will be right in heaven--in the light of God's mercy.'\n\nAnd then he tried to remember all that he had ever read about, God,\nand all that the blessed Christ--that bringeth glad tidings of great\njoy unto all people, had said of the Father, from whom He came.\nThose sayings dropped like balm down upon his troubled heart and\nbrain. He remembered his mother, and how she had loved him; and he\nwas going to a love wiser, tenderer, deeper than hers.\n\nAs he thought this, he moved his hands as if to pray; but Sylvia\nclenched her hold, and he lay still, praying all the same for her,\nfor his child, and for himself. Then he saw the sky redden with the\nfirst flush of dawn; he heard Kester's long-drawn sigh of weariness\noutside the open door.\n\nHe had seen widow Dobson pass through long before to keep the\nremainder of her watch on the bed in the lean-to, which had been his\nfor many and many a sleepless and tearful night. Those nights were\nover--he should never see that poor chamber again, though it was\nscarce two feet distant. He began to lose all sense of the\ncomparative duration of time: it seemed as long since kind Sally\nDobson had bent over him with soft, lingering look, before going\ninto the humble sleeping-room--as long as it was since his boyhood,\nwhen he stood by his mother dreaming of the life that should be his,\nwith the scent of the cowslips tempting him to be off to the\nwoodlands where they grew. Then there came a rush and an eddying\nthrough his brain--his soul trying her wings for the long flight.\nAgain he was in the present: he heard the waves lapping against the\nshelving shore once again.\n\nAnd now his thoughts came back to Sylvia. Once more he spoke aloud,\nin a strange and terrible voice, which was not his. Every sound came\nwith efforts that were new to him.\n\n'My wife! Sylvie! Once more--forgive me all.'\n\nShe sprang up, she kissed his poor burnt lips; she held him in her\narms, she moaned, and said,\n\n'Oh, wicked me! forgive me--me--Philip!'\n\nThen he spoke, and said, 'Lord, forgive us our trespasses as we\nforgive each other!' And after that the power of speech was\nconquered by the coming death. He lay very still, his consciousness\nfast fading away, yet coming back in throbs, so that he knew it was\nSylvia who touched his lips with cordial, and that it was Sylvia who\nmurmured words of love in his ear. He seemed to sleep at last, and\nso he did--a kind of sleep, but the light of the red morning sun\nfell on his eyes, and with one strong effort he rose up, and turned\nso as once more to see his wife's pale face of misery.\n\n'In heaven,' he cried, and a bright smile came on his face, as he\nfell back on his pillow.\n\nNot long after Hester came, the little Bella scarce awake in her\narms, with the purpose of bringing his child to see him ere yet he\npassed away. Hester had watched and prayed through the livelong\nnight. And now she found him dead, and Sylvia, tearless and almost\nunconscious, lying by him, her hand holding his, her other thrown\naround him.\n\nKester, poor old man, was sobbing bitterly; but she not at all.\n\nThen Hester bore her child to her, and Sylvia opened wide her\nmiserable eyes, and only stared, as if all sense was gone from her.\nBut Bella suddenly rousing up at the sight of the poor, scarred,\npeaceful face, cried out,--\n\n'Poor man who was so hungry. Is he not hungry now?'\n\n'No,' said Hester, softly. 'The former things are passed away--and\nhe is gone where there is no more sorrow, and no more pain.'\n\nBut then she broke down into weeping and crying. Sylvia sat up and\nlooked at her.\n\n'Why do yo' cry, Hester?' she said. 'Yo' niver said that yo'\nwouldn't forgive him as long as yo' lived. Yo' niver broke the heart\nof him that loved yo', and let him almost starve at yo'r very door.\nOh, Philip! my Philip, tender and true.'\n\nThen Hester came round and closed the sad half-open eyes; kissing\nthe calm brow with a long farewell kiss. As she did so, her eye fell\non a black ribbon round his neck. She partly lifted it out; to it\nwas hung a half-crown piece.\n\n'This is the piece he left at William Darley's to be bored,' said\nshe, 'not many days ago.'\n\nBella had crept to her mother's arms as a known haven in this\nstrange place; and the touch of his child loosened the fountains of\nher tears. She stretched out her hand for the black ribbon, put it\nround her own neck; after a while she said,\n\n'If I live very long, and try hard to be very good all that time, do\nyo' think, Hester, as God will let me to him where he is?'\n\n      *      *      *      *      *\n\nMonkshaven is altered now into a rising bathing place. Yet, standing\nnear the site of widow Dobson's house on a summer's night, at the\nebb of a spring-tide, you may hear the waves come lapping up the\nshelving shore with the same ceaseless, ever-recurrent sound as that\nwhich Philip listened to in the pauses between life and death.\n\nAnd so it will be until 'there shall be no more sea'.\n\nBut the memory of man fades away. A few old people can still tell\nyou the tradition of the man who died in a cottage somewhere about\nthis spot,--died of starvation while his wife lived in hard-hearted\nplenty not two good stone-throws away. This is the form into which\npopular feeling, and ignorance of the real facts, have moulded the\nstory. Not long since a lady went to the 'Public Baths', a handsome\nstone building erected on the very site of widow Dobson's cottage,\nand finding all the rooms engaged she sat down and had some talk\nwith the bathing woman; and, as it chanced, the conversation fell on\nPhilip Hepburn and the legend of his fate.\n\n'I knew an old man when I was a girl,' said the bathing woman, 'as\ncould niver abide to hear t' wife blamed. He would say nothing\nagain' th' husband; he used to say as it were not fit for men to be\njudging; that she had had her sore trial, as well as Hepburn\nhisself.'\n\nThe lady asked, 'What became of the wife?'\n\n'She was a pale, sad woman, allays dressed in black. I can just\nremember her when I was a little child, but she died before her\ndaughter was well grown up; and Miss Rose took t' lassie, as had\nalways been like her own.'\n\n'Miss Rose?'\n\n'Hester Rose! have yo' niver heared of Hester Rose, she as founded\nt' alms-houses for poor disabled sailors and soldiers on t'\nHorncastle road? There's a piece o' stone in front to say that \"This\nbuilding is erected in memory of P. H.\"--and some folk will have it\nP. H. stands for t' name o' th' man as was starved to death.'\n\n'And the daughter?'\n\n'One o' th' Fosters, them as founded t' Old Bank, left her a vast o'\nmoney; and she were married to distant cousin of theirs, and went\noff to settle in America many and many a year ago.'\n\n\n\n\nTHE END.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Sylvia's Lovers -- Complete, by\nElizabeth Cleghorn Gaskell\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK SYLVIA'S LOVERS -- COMPLETE ***\n\n***** This file should be named 4537.txt or 4537.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/4\/5\/3\/4537\/\n\nProduced by Charles Aldarondo.

General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":112,"split":"train"}
